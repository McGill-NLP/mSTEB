"anuchhed anusar, kun MySpace suvidhaley padhna samasya vayeka vidyarthiharulai faidajanak huna sakchha?","The correct answer is **A: anuchulan (adaptation/adjustable)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kiboardko prayog wa hizzeka sath samasya bhogne vidyarthiharuka lagi yaad garna sajilo ra type garna sajilo banaunale yass prishthalai sajilaisanga web thegana pradan garera pahunch garna sakinchha.""  This translates to: ""Because it is made easy to remember and type with keyboard usage for students with difficulties, this page can be provided as an easy-to-use website and accessed.""  The key here is the adaptation and ease of use for students with difficulties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: blogharu (blogs):** While blogs are a feature, the passage doesn't specifically say they benefit students with reading difficulties.
* **C: ek web thegana (a website):**  The passage mentions MySpace being a website, but doesn't highlight the website *itself* as a specific benefit for students with reading difficulties. It's the *adaptation* of the website that's beneficial.
* **D: 54 million profileharu (54 million profiles):** This number refers to the number of profiles on MySpace and isn't directly related to any specific feature that helps students with reading difficulties.

"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun khruschchebhle majdur ko dangako pratikriyako bhaag hoina?","Correct answer is **C: jyala katauti ma bridhi (Increase in food shortage)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The protests were a result of food shortages and a lack of basic necessities.
* **The passage details:** Krushchev ultimately restored order, offered some economic concessions, and appointed a new Prime Minister.
* **Therefore:** An increase in food shortage (Jyala katauti ma bridhi) is directly *opposed* to the outcome of the protests and Krushchev's actions. He addressed the shortages, he didn't cause them.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the passage:

* **A: euta naya pradhan mantri niyukta garney (Appointment of a new Prime Minister):**  The passage explicitly states that Krushchev agreed to appoint a new Prime Minister (Gomulka).
* **B: wyawasthako punarsthapana garna tankharuko prayog (Use of tanks to restore order):** The passage mentions Krushchev using tanks to suppress the protests and restore order.
* **D: kehi arthik magharu swikar garnu (Acceptance of some economic demands):** The passage states that Krushchev conceded to some economic demands.



"
nimna madhey kun polandko dangako karan hoina?,"Correct answer: **A: samyawad (साम्यवाद)**

Here's why:

The question describes the June 1956 protests in Poland. The protests were primarily sparked by:

*   **Food shortages (khadyanna abhawa)**
*   **Price increases (jyala katauti)**
*   **Opposition to the communist regime (samyawad wiruddhako sarvajanik virodhma)**

While the protests did ultimately lead to some economic concessions (arthik magharulai thaaun die) and the appointment of Władysław Gomułka as Prime Minister (wladyslaw gomulkako niyukti), the underlying *cause* wasn't opposition to communism itself.  The people weren't protesting the *idea* of communism, but rather the way it was being implemented and the resulting hardships.

Therefore, communism (samyawad) wasn't a *cause* of the protests; rather, the negative consequences of communist policies *caused* them. The other options (food shortages, price increases, and Gomułka's appointment) were direct results or consequences of the protests themselves."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kunley USSR ra sanyukta rajya america bichko sambandhalai asar garena?","Correct answer is **B: germany ko bare vichar**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph clearly states that WWII was a shared enemy that led to initial cooperation between the USSR and the USA.** The shared enemy (Germany) *facilitated* their initial relationship.
* **The paragraph then describes how post-war disagreements over systems, processes, and culture led to conflict.** This implies that the differences *caused* a deterioration of the relationship.
* **The paragraph explicitly mentions ""system, process ra sanskritiko jhagadale"" (system, process, and cultural conflicts) as key factors in the shift from allies to adversaries.**
* **""Viparit prakriya"" (opposite process) and ""pranaliharu sambandhit vivad"" (disputes related to systems) directly relate to the described conflicts.**
* **""Sanskritik bhinnata"" (cultural differences) is also mentioned as a factor contributing to the conflict.**
* **However, the paragraph does *not* indicate that the views on Germany had any significant impact on the relationship *after* the war.** The shared enemy was *because* of Germany, but the subsequent conflict wasn't *about* Germany's views.

Therefore, the views on Germany are the least relevant factor in the conflict described."
nimna madhey kunley shariribhari snayu bhabharu pathaunako uddeshyalai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina?,"सही उत्तर है **A: ragat babhaw lai dhilo banauna (रगत बहावलाई ढिलो बनाउन)**।

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* **प्रश्न में बताया गया है:** मांसपेशी संकुचन शरीर के रक्त प्रवाह को तेज करता है, जो शरीर को संभावित खतरों से बचाने में मदद करता है और होमियोस्टेसिस (शरीर का आंतरिक संतुलन) बनाए रखने में योगदान देता है।
* **विकल्प A गलत क्यों है:** मांसपेशी संकुचन रक्त प्रवाह को *तेज* करता है, इसे *ढीला* नहीं बनाता। रक्त प्रवाह को ढीला बनाने से शरीर को खतरा कम होने का खतरा होता है।
* **विकल्प B, C, और D सही क्यों हैं:** मांसपेशी संकुचन रक्त प्रवाह को व्यवस्थित करने, होमियोस्टेसिस को व्यवस्थित करने और संभावित शारीरिक खतरों से बचाने में मदद करता है, जैसा कि प्रश्न में बताया गया है।

इसलिए, विकल्प A मांसपेशी संकुचन के उद्देश्य का गलत वर्णन करता है।"
giza patharma ke pauna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: chihanharu (monuments)**.

The text states: ""Egyptko bhyali off da deadko giza pathar wa """"gija necropolis"""" maa thuprai piramidharu awasthit chan (jasmadhye da great pyramid sabaibhanda thulo ho), **dherai sanah chihanharu, dherai mandirharu ra great sphinx chan**.""

This translates to: ""In Egypt's valley of the dead, the Giza plateau (where the great pyramid is located) has many pyramids, many monuments, and the Great Sphinx.""

While the other options are present, the text specifically mentions ""chihanharu"" (monuments) along with temples and the Sphinx.
"
great pyramidko uddeshya ke thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: pharaoh laai samman garnako lagi** (To honor the pharaoh).

The text explicitly states: ""Great piramidlai faroe khufuko sammanka lagi sirjana garieko thiyo"" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was created to honor Pharaoh Khufu.""
"
mandir dhwasta banauney ago lagauney manisko pahichan huney gyanko jimmewar ko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: efficienharu**.

The passage states: ""akroshit efficientharule herostratasko name kahilyai pani record garine chhaina bhanera ghoshana gare."" This translates to ""The efficienthar proclaimed that Herostratus' name had never been recorded before."" This implies that the efficienthar were responsible for identifying and attempting to erase Herostratus' name from history after the temple's destruction. The passage directly links them to the attempt to obscure Herostratus' name.
"
artemis mandirko punanirman sambandhiko kun kathan sahi ho?,"Correct answer is **B: tyo Raja alekjenderko shasanpachhi punanirman gariyeko thiyo.**

Here's why:

* The text clearly states: ""pachhi, alekjenderko mrityu bhaepachi, 323 BCE ma mandirko punarnirman gariyo."" (After Alexander's death, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.)
* Option A is incorrect because the text states Alexander proposed rebuilding but it was not approved, and it doesn't say he funded it.
* Option C is incorrect because the text states Herostratus's name was never recorded and the temple was destroyed by him.
* Option D is incorrect because the text states it was rebuilt in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.



"
"anuchhed anusar, prajatiharuley dui khuttama hideko sabaibhanda pahila kahiley thiyo?","The correct answer is **D: 4.2 million varsha agadi**.

The passage states: ""Dwipadiya visheshagyataharu 4.2-3.9 million warsha aghiko astrelopithecus jiwawasheshma bhetinchhan..."" which translates to ""Bipedal specialists are encountered in the fossil remains of Australopithecus 4.2-3.9 million years ago...""

While the passage also mentions *Sahelanthropus* potentially walking upright 7 million years ago, it doesn't state that *Sahelanthropus* was the first species to walk upright. The passage focuses on *Australopithecus* being bipedal specialists around 4.2-3.9 million years ago. Therefore, 4.2 million years ago is the earliest time mentioned in the passage for a species to be considered bipedal.
"
yi madhey kun prajati niyamit dui khuttama hindthyo?,"The correct answer is **B: thado manis (Homo erectus)**.

The passage states: ""manisharu homo erects (thado manis) co udayasangai dui million warsha pahila thado bhaera hindna thaleka thee.""  This translates to ""Humans, along with the emergence of Homo erectus (upright man), started walking upright two million years ago.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sahelenthropas:** The passage says *Sahelanthropus* lived 7 million years ago, much earlier than *Homo erectus*.
*   **C: dwipadiya visheshagyataharu:** This refers to ""bipedal specialists,"" a general term for early bipedal hominins. The passage doesn't specify *which* bipedal specialists walked upright regularly.
*   **D: astrelopithecus:** The passage states that *Australopithecus* (which includes *Australopithecus swahbatavata*) were already walking upright, but *Homo erectus* is mentioned as the species that consistently walked upright around 2 million years ago.

Therefore, *Homo erectus* is the species explicitly mentioned as regularly walking upright around 2 million years ago."
WWII ko bela germanyko navyley ke prapta garna prayash gariraheko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: belayatbata ayeka samanharulai awarodh garnu** (to obstruct supplies coming from Britain).

The passage states: ""Sohi samayma, mukhyataya yu-dungaharuko prayogdwara germanko jalasenale yo traffic rokna prayas gardai thiyo."" (At the same time, mainly using U-boats, the German navy tried to stop this traffic.)  ""This traffic"" refers to the Allied supplies being transported across the Atlantic to Britain.
"
"anuchhedma diyeko jaankari anusar, uttar atlantic abhiyanko samayma naval yuddhama kasle sabai bhanda dherai safalta payo?","The correct answer is **A: belayeti ra amerikiharu**.

The passage states that Americans and British were trying to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.  Germany was trying to stop this traffic using U-boats, but the passage implies the Allies were ultimately successful in overcoming this obstacle, meaning the Allies (including Britain and the US) were more successful in naval warfare during that time.
"
asarianharule ghodasawar fauj prayog ko suruwat garda ke ko astitwa thiyena?,"The correct answer is **A: kathi**.

The passage states: ""tyo belasamma kathi awishkar bhaeko thiena, tyasaile assyrian ashwadle ghoda nango dhadma basera yuddha gurney sena ho."" This translates to ""At that time, nothing had been invented, so the Assyrians fought on horses with soldiers sitting naked on their chests.""

Therefore, the answer is **kathi** (nothing).
"
ghodasawar fauj prayog garney yuddhaharu kasari ladincha?,"The correct answer is **C: ghodasawar garera**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ashwadal bhaneko ghoda chadhera yuddha gurney sena ho."" (The war force was called Ashwadal, riding horses.) and later describes how the Assyrians fought on horseback. Therefore, the correct answer is that they fought using a cavalry force (ghodasawar garera).
"
"anuchhed anusar, tapailey sadharan babylonian nagarik kaha fela garnu hunna?","The correct answer is **D: bhitri mandirma baliharu lyaudai gareko** (in the inner sanctuary where sacrifices were made).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""pratyek mandirma euta khula aangan thiyo ra tyasapachhi bhitri mandir thiyo jasma kewal pujariharu bhitra pasna paaunthe."" (Every temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.)
* **The passage also says:** ""Manisharule dewataharulai baliharu lyaunthe ra pujariharule dharmakriya ra chadaparwaharumarfat dewataharuko awashyaktaharu pura gurney prayas gardathe."" (People would bring sacrifices to the gods and priests would make religious rituals and festivals to appease the gods.)
* **Therefore, ordinary Babylonians were *not* allowed in the inner sanctuary where sacrifices were performed.** They could participate in rituals in the courtyard, but the inner sanctuary was restricted to priests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mandirko anganma baliharu lyaudai gareko awasthama** (in the courtyard where sacrifices were made):  The passage mentions people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the courtyard was open to everyone.
* **B: mukhya mandirma samharoma upasthit bhayeko** (being present in the main temple during a festival): The passage mentions festivals happening in the courtyard.
* **C: mandirko anganko utsavma** (during the temple's festivals):  The passage mentions festivals happening in the courtyard.



"
nimna madhey kun vishesh garera pujariharuko lagi thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: bhitri mandirharu (inner temples)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pratyek mandirma euta khula aangan thiyo ra tyasapachhi bhitri mandir thiyo jasma kewal pujariharu bhitra pasna paaunthe.""  This translates to: ""In each temple, there was an open courtyard and then an inner temple which only the priests could enter.""

Therefore, the inner temple was specifically for the priests. The other options are not directly supported by the text. While priests might participate in festivals, ceremonies, and observances (utsavharu, samharoharu), the text highlights the *inner temple* as their exclusive space. Ziggurats (zigurats) were the tower-like structures associated with the temples, but the text doesn't say they were specifically for priests.
"
raja tutankhamunley kahiley kukhyaat bhaye?,"The correct answer is **C: unko chihan khoj pachi** (after his tomb was discovered).

The text explicitly states: ""Yadyapi, 1922 co unko chihanko khojle unlai prasidha banayo."" which translates to ""However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.""
"
ek kuraley raja tutankhamunlai prakhyat egyptian raja banayo?,"The correct answer is **A: unko chihan lai kehi nagari chhodieko thiyo** (his tomb was left untouched).

The passage states: ""Yadyapi, 1922 co unko chihanko khojle unlai prasidha banayo."" (However, the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.)  The following sentence explains *why* the discovery was so important: ""wigatka dherai chihanharu lutieka bella, yo chihanlai najanido rupma kehi nagari chhodieko thiyo."" (While many tombs had been looted, this tomb was left relatively untouched.)  This untouched state is what made Tutankhamun's tomb so significant and brought him fame.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: prachin rajaharuko suchima unko darja** (his status in the list of ancient kings) - The passage says he wasn't considered particularly important in ancient times, so this is wrong.
* **C: unko chihanbata hajaraun kalakriti haru ko chori** (the theft of thousands of artifacts from his tomb) - The passage says many tombs *were* looted, but Tutankhamun's was *not* looted extensively.
* **D: egyptian samayako bela unko mahatwa** (his importance in ancient Egyptian times) - The passage implies he wasn't particularly important in his own time.



"
greek kavi homerley ke garna sakdaina thiye?,"The correct answer is **B: dekhna (to see)**.

The text states Homer was a ""suprasiddha netrahin kavi"" which translates to ""very famous blind poet"". Therefore, he could not see.
"
kun prasiddha greeklai sahitya bahek aru kurakolagi chinincha?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

The passage states: ""Arka prasidha greek ganitagya Pythagoras hun jo mukhya rupma samakoni trikonka kunaharuko sambandhaharu barema afno prakhyat sadhyaka lagi parichit chan."" This translates to: ""Another famous Greek is Pythagoras, who is primarily known for his famous theorems regarding the relationships of angles in right-angled triangles.""

While Homer, Sophocles, and Aristophanes are all famous for their literature, Pythagoras is known for his work in mathematics.
"
hibru pariwarley uniharuko dherai jasto samay kaha bitauthiye?,"The correct answer is **A: khula hawama (in the open air)**.

The passage states: ""Hibru pariwarko adhikansh jeevan khula hawa bitthyo."" which translates to ""Most of the life of the Hebrew family was spent in the open air.""
"
hibru pariwarma ke dherai mahatwapurna thiyena?,"The correct answer is **C: uniharuko ghar (their house)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""madhyapurvako nano mausam ghar tyati mahatwapurna thiena"" which translates to ""In the Middle East, the house was very important.""  The question asks what was very important in a Hebrew family. The passage directly links the importance of the house to the Middle Eastern context.  The other options are mentioned but aren't presented as the *most* important thing according to the text.
"
nimna madhey kelai scandinavian deshharu bichko bhinnata vanera varnan gariyeko chaina?,"The correct answer is **B: jamin (land)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while the Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland) shared a general ""scandinavian"" identity, they had many differences in their:

* **Itihaska (history)**
* **Ritithiti (customs/traditions)**
* **Manisharu (people)**

The passage *doesn't* mention differences in **jamin (land)**. Therefore, it's the correct answer.
"
greenlandma pratham kasle basobas gare?,"The correct answer is **A: eskimo adiwasiharu**.

The passage states: ""Unko khojlai parwah nagari, tyas samayama eskimo adiwasiharu bhane pahilyai tyahan basiraheka thee."" which translates to ""He didn't care about the search, at that time the Eskimo tribes were already living there.""
"
kun samuhaley bina kursi khana mann paraaunthe?,"The correct answer is **C: dhani roman purushharu (rich Roman men)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jab garib manis ra mahilaharule kursima baser afno khana khanthe, dhani manisharu sangai bhoj garna mann paraaunthe jahaan tiniharule khana khaepachhi afno chheuma aaram garthe.""

This translates to: ""When poor men and women eat sitting on chairs, rich men feel like dining with them, whereas they eat in their own comfort.""

Therefore, the rich Roman men (dhani roman purushharu) are the ones who *don't* feel the need to eat with the poor and prefer to eat in their own comfort, without sitting on chairs.
"
nimna madhey ke purano roman bhojharuko bhag hunthena?,"The correct answer is **D: roast gariyeko turkeyko thal (Roast turkey dish)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Purano roman khanama yuropbata america wa asiapachhika shatabdima aeka khana samawesh hundainan. Udaharanka lagi, uniharusanga makai, tamatar, alu, koko kehi thiena ra kunai pani prachin romanle kahilyai turkey chakhena.""

This translates to: ""In ancient Roman cuisine, foods from America and Asia did not appear until the 15th and 16th centuries. For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and ancient Romans had never tasted turkey.""

Therefore, a roast turkey dish would not have been part of the ancient Roman diet. The other options are mentioned in the passage as aspects of Roman eating habits (poor people eating comfortably, peacock as an appetizer, and wealthy people changing their dining habits)."
"anuchhedko adharma, nimna madhye kun kurale dirgakalin prabhaav pardaina?","The correct answer is **A: ek samaj (a society)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph emphasizes the role of civilization in fostering cooperation and social harmony within a society.**  The core idea is that a civilized culture enables people to live together peacefully and collaboratively.
* **Alpasankhyak sanskriti (minority cultures), ek sahari-rajya (city-states), and ek sabhyata ko sanskriti (the culture of a civilization)** are all *elements* or *aspects* related to civilization, but not the ultimate outcome or foundation *on which* civilization is built.  The civilization itself *creates* a society.

Therefore, the paragraph highlights the societal impact of civilization, making ""ek samaj"" the element least directly linked to the long-term influence *of* civilization itself, as opposed to being a result of it.



"
"anuchhed anusar, rashtra bhanda pahile ke auncha?","The correct answer is **A: ek sabhyata ko sanskriti (the culture of a civilization)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nagar-rajyaharu rashtraharuka agradutharu hun."" which translates to ""City-states were precursors to nations.""  It then goes on to say that a civilized culture (sabhyata ko sanskriti) is a significant and important element that facilitates cooperation and coexistence within a society. The passage emphasizes the role of a civilization's culture as a foundation for societal development *before* the emergence of nations.

Therefore, a civilization's culture is presented as being more fundamental than a nation-state."
Drukgyal jong barey kun kathan satya hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: ago ley killako dherai awasheshharu dhwasta banayo** (Fire destroyed many of the fort's remains).

Here's why:

* The text states that after 1951, the fort's remains were preserved and protected. This directly contradicts the statement that fire destroyed many of the remains. The other options are all supported by the text.

Let's break down why the other options are true:

* **A: tyasko nirman tibeti-mongol senako vijay manauna garieko thiyo** (It was built to commemorate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongol army): The text explicitly says this.
* **B: yo bhutanma awasthit cha** (It is located in Bhutan): The text states it is in Bhutan.
* **D: tyo zhabdrung ngawang namagyel dwaara srijana garieko thiyo** (It was created by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel): The text says he built the fort to celebrate his victory.



"
kun kathanley sahi tarikaley Drukgyal jongma vayeko agolagiko varnan gardacha?,"The correct answer is **D: tyo zhabdrung ngawang namgyeldwara surakshit gariyeko thiyo** (that it was protected by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Agalagipachhi, bhutanko sabaibhanda sanasanipurna akarshanharumadhe baaki raheko euta killalai surakshit ra sanrakshit rakhieko thiyo."" This translates to ""After the division, the remaining fortress was kept safe and protected among the most remarkable attractions of Bhutan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: baaki vayeko awashesh zhadbrung ngawang namgyalko tasvir thiyo** (the remaining ruins were a picture of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel): While a statue remained, the passage describes it as a ""fortress"" (killa), not just a picture.
* **B: tibeti-mongol senaharu vijayi bhaekaa thiye** (the Tibetan-Mongol armies were victorious): The passage says Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress *after* defeating them.
* **C: tyo thauko prasiddhima kehi asar vayena** (that the place's fame had no effect): The passage says it remained a prominent attraction *after* the division, implying it *did* have a lasting impact.



"
nimna madhey combodia bare kun kathan satya ho?,"The correct answer is **A: bhiyatnami harule phnom phen dhwasta pare (Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Phen)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Thaiharule 18 aun shatabdima dherai patak combodiama akraman gare ra tiniharule 1772 maa Phnom Phen dhwasta pare."" (Thais attacked Cambodia many times in the 18th century and they destroyed Phnom Phen in 1772.)
* **The passage also states:** ""Bhiyatanamiharule pani combodiama 18 aun shatabdika antimatira bhiyatanamiharule pani combodiama akraman gare."" (Vietnamese also attacked Cambodia in the late 18th century.)

Option A accurately reflects the information in the passage about the Vietnamese destroying Phnom Phen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: combodialey 1772 ma thylandlai akraman garyo (Cambodia attacked Thailand in 1772):** The passage says Thailand attacked Cambodia, not the other way around.
* **C: combodia maa 18aun satabdiko suruwatma bhiyatnamdwaara akraman vayeko thiyo (Cambodia was attacked by Vietnam in the early 18th century):** The passage mentions Vietnamese attacks in the *late* 18th century, not the early.
* **D: thyharuley phnom phen dhwasta pare (They destroyed Phnom Phen):** ""They"" is ambiguous. The passage clarifies that the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Phen.
"
nimna madhey kun kathanharuley combodiako akramanharulai sahi tarikaley varnan gardacha?,"The best answer is **B: thyharu ra bhiyatnami le 1772 ma combodiama aakraman gare (They and the Vietnamese attacked Cambodia in 1772)**.

Here's why:

* **B is the most comprehensive:** It acknowledges both Thailand and Vietnam as aggressors and specifies the year 1772, a key event mentioned in the question.  It accurately reflects the information provided in the prompt.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: bhiyatnami harule combodia ma dherai patak akraman gare (Vietnamese attacked Cambodia many times)** - This is incomplete. It only focuses on the Vietnamese and doesn't mention Thailand, nor does it give a specific timeframe.
* **C: bhiyatnami harule phnom phen dhwasta pare (Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh)** - This is only a single instance of aggression and doesn't capture the broader picture of multiple attacks.
* **D: thyharuley dherai patak combodia akraman gare (They attacked Cambodia many times)** -  ""They"" is vague and doesn't specify who the attackers were.  It's less precise than option B.



Therefore, option B best summarizes the attacks on Cambodia as described in the prompt.
"
douch east india companyley uniharu taiwanma vayeko samayma nimna madhey ke garenan?,"Correct Answer: **A: tapuko dakshin paschimi bhagma ek adhar ko nirmaan**

The passage states: ""Sun 1624 maa, douch east india companyle adivasi anaj utpadan abhyasma parivartan lyaune ra yasako chamel ra chiny khetima chiniyan majdurharulai kamma lagauna suruwat gardai dakshin paschimi taiwanma ek adhaar sthapana gardacha.""  This translates to: ""In 1624, the Dutch East India Company changed the indigenous agricultural practices and began employing Chinese laborers in theamel and chiny fields, establishing a base in southwestern Taiwan.""

While options B and C are also mentioned in the passage, option A is the most comprehensive and directly reflects what the Dutch East India Company *did* in southwestern Taiwan during their time there. Option D is incorrect because the passage says Japan took control of Taiwan, not China.



"
shimonoseki sandhiley ke sthapana garyo?,"The correct answer is **D: japanko taiwan mathiko adhikar (Japan's right to Taiwan)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""1895 maa, pahilo china-japan yuddha (1894-1895) maa harepachhi, ching sarkarle simonoseki sandhi hastakshar garyo, jasanusar yasale taiwanko swamitwa japanlai sumpiyo...""  This translates to ""After losing the first Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded the ownership of Taiwan to Japan...""

Therefore, the Treaty of Shimonoseki established Japan's right to Taiwan.
"
euta rasayanko pH star kasari napinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: rasayanma hydrogen ionharuko matra (The amount of hydrogen ions in the substance)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""pH star parikshan garieko rasayanma hydrogen (pH maa H) ayanharuko matrabata sanket hunchha"" which translates to ""In a substance whose pH has been tested, the signal is based on the amount of hydrogen ions (H) in pH.""
* **pH is defined by the concentration of hydrogen ions.** A lower pH indicates a higher concentration of hydrogen ions (more acidic), and a higher pH indicates a lower concentration of hydrogen ions (more alkaline/basic).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: rasayan kati amliya wa adharbhut chha (how acidic or alkaline the substance is):** While acidity and alkalinity *relate* to the concentration of hydrogen ions, pH *measures* that concentration. It's not the direct answer to *how* pH is determined.
* **B: rasayanma kati protonharu chha (how many protons are in the substance):** This is incorrect. While hydrogen ions *do* contain protons, the pH specifically measures the hydrogen *ion* concentration, not the total number of protons.
* **D: rasayanma kati electronharu chhan (how many electrons are in the substance):** This is completely irrelevant to pH. pH is about hydrogen ions, not electrons.



"
hyrdogen ionharubata ke hataincha?,"Correct answer is **D: electronharu**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Electronle tiniharubata alag nikaleko (hydrogen paramanuma euta proton ra euta electron hune bhaekale) hydrogen ion proton ho.""

This translates to: ""When an electron is separated from them (in a hydrogen atom that has a proton and an electron), the hydrogen ion becomes a proton.""

Therefore, hydrogen ions lose electrons to become protons.
"
nimna madhye kun kathanley sinhaharuko samuha lai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **B: purush ra mahilako anupat jod hudaina (The ratio of males and females does not add up)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Jhundama tisabhanda badhi mada ra shawakharusahit ekdekhi teen sambandhit wayaskanarharuha hunchhan."" (In the pride, there are one to three related adult males and females, including the mother and offspring.)  This indicates a *specific* ratio of males and females.

* **Options A, C, and D are all supported by the passage:**
    * **A: tiniharu kukurharuko jhund jastai vyavahar gardachan (They behave like a dog pack):** The passage says ""Sinhaka samuharule bwaanso wa kukurka samuhaharu jasto gun dekhaunchhan (tar thulla biralaharu jasta hoinan)"" - Lions are considered similar to dog packs in some aspects (but not like larger dog packs).
    * **C: mahila ra purushharu najikbata sambandhit hunchhan (Males and females are closely related):** The passage says ""Didibahini ra chhoriharuko thulo parivar bhaekole mahilaharu prayaha ek arkasanga najikaibata sambandhit hunchhan"" -  Due to large families of sisters and sons, females are often closely related to each other.
    * **D: tiniharu khatrnaak ra samajik dubai hunchhan (They are dangerous and socially sophisticated):**  The passage says ""tiniharuko sikarma dherai pranghatak huncha"" - Their behavior is very unpredictable/dangerous.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.



"
nimna madhey kun kathanley sinhaharuko vyavaharlai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **D: tiniharuko vyavahara anya thula biraloharu jasto hunchha.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while lions share some characteristics with other big cats, their behavior is *not* exactly the same. It highlights the difference, saying ""tar thulla biralaharu jasta hoinan"" (but not like other big cats).

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: tiniharu dherai samajik chhan (they are very social):** The passage says ""Sinhaharu sabaibhanda samajik biralaharu hun"" (Lions are the most social cats).
* **B: tiniharuko vyavahara bwansoharu sanga tulanatmak chha (their behavior is comparable to hyenas):** The passage states ""Sinhaka samuharule bwaanso wa kukurka samuhaharu jasto gun dekhaunchhan, jo wyawaharma ashcharyajanak rupma sinhajastai hunchhan (tar thulla biralaharu jasta hoinan)"" (Lion groups share traits with hyena groups, which are remarkably lion-like in behavior (but not like other big cats)).
* **C: dubai purush ra mahilaharu shikarkolagi dherai khatarnak hunchan (male lions and females are very dangerous for hunting):** The passage mentions ""...tiniharuko sikarma dherai pranghatak hunchan"" (...their hunting is very dangerous). While it doesn't specify *who* is dangerous, it supports the idea of dangerous hunting behavior.



Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn't accurately reflect the description of lion behavior in the provided text."
kharayoharu kasto prakarko shikariharuko lagi shikar hunchan?,"The correct answer is **C: madhyam-akarka biraloharu (medium-sized cats)**.

The text states: ""Kharayodekhi harin ra mrigasamma madhyam akarko shikar garna sakne praniantargat dherai madhyam akarka biraloharu parchhan."" This translates to ""Many medium-sized cats are among the animals that can hunt animals ranging from deer to monkeys.""

Therefore, the question asks what *kind* of hunters medium-sized cats are *for*, and the answer directly from the text is that they are hunters for medium-sized prey.
"
sana biraloharuley samanyata nimna madhey kun shikar garchan?,"The correct answer is **A: musaharu (mice)**.

The text explicitly states that many small wild cats are capable of hunting rodents, and mice are a common type of rodent. The text also mentions ""antyama, kira, rodent, chheparo ra charaharu"" (rats, weasels, rodents, mongooses, and hares) as prey. Among these, mice are the most common and typical prey for small wild cats.
"
nimna madhey kun oselotko shikar garney vidhiko bhag hoina?,"Correct Answer: **D: kewal sano akarka janawarharuko shikar garne**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Osalatle shikar gurney lagbhag sabai janawarharu yo bhanda sano hunchhan."" This means ocelots don't *only* hunt small animals. The text describes their hunting techniques as involving camouflage, scent tracking, and nocturnal hunting. They are opportunistic predators and will hunt animals larger than just small rodents.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: tiniharule vatavaranma bhesh badalnu (They change their appearance in the environment):** This refers to camouflage, which is mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: tiniharule shikarko gandha pacchaunu (They track the scent of their prey):** The passage explicitly states that scientists believe ocelots use their noses to detect prey.
*   **C: tiniharule rati shikarko pachi garnu (They hunt prey at night):** The passage mentions that ocelots have excellent night vision, indicating they are nocturnal hunters.

Therefore, the option that is *not* a hunting method described in the passage is that they *only* hunt small animals."
nimna madhey kunley oselotko sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina? ,"The correct answer is **C: tiniharuko sungney shakti kamjor hunchha (Their sense of smell is weak)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Vaigyanikharule sochdachhan key oselotharule janawarharulai khan (shikar) garna uniharu baseko thaunma sunghera patta lagaunchhan."" This translates to ""Scientists think that ocelots use their scent to mark the territory to hunt animals."" This indicates that ocelots *do* rely on their sense of smell.

The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A: tiniharu rati ramrosita shikar garna sakchhan (They are good at hunting at night):** The passage mentions they have excellent night vision.
*   **B: tiniharu chupchap bhaera hiddul garna sakdachhan (They can stalk silently):** The passage states they are very stealthy.
*   **D: tiniharuley sano janawarharu ko shikar garna ruchauchan (They prefer to hunt small animals):** The passage says their prey is generally smaller animals than those found in ocelot territory.

Therefore, only option C contradicts the information given in the passage."
nimna madhey kun baghko sabaibhanda thulo manindaina?,"The correct answer is **A: gajran**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the characteristics of tigers (bagh). It mentions their ability to climb, run long distances, and their roar. It also mentions that tigers belong to the Panthera genus and that only tigers can roar.

*   **Gajran** (गजरण) translates to ""sniffing"" or ""smelling."" This is not a characteristic of tigers or their abilities.
*   **Chadhnu** (चadhnu) translates to ""climbing."" The passage mentions that tigers can climb.
*   **Hamfalnu** (हमफलनु) translates to ""to jump."" The passage mentions tigers can run long distances.
*   **Taannu** (तannu) translates to ""to pull"" or ""to strain."" The passage mentions tigers can powerfully pull a ball with their paws.

Therefore, ""gajran"" is the only option that doesn't describe a capability or characteristic associated with tigers. The question asks which one *isn't* a characteristic of a tiger, so ""gajran"" is the correct answer."
"anuchhed anusar, yi madhey kun bagh ra sinha bichko bhinatta ho?","Correct Answer: B: tiniharuko garjanako awaj (Their roar's sound)

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""Baghko garjan sinhako purna awajko garjan jasto hundaina, tar badhi jasto chidchida, charko shabdaharuko wakya jastai hunchha."" 

This translates to: ""A tiger's roar is not like the full roar of a lion, but rather more like a sharp, choppy sentence of words.""

Therefore, the difference in the sound of their roars is the key distinction mentioned in the passage.
"
"anuchhed anusar, anya jiwavaigyanikharu bhanda aghi rober hookeley ke gare?","Correct answer is **A: mrit koshanuko awalokan (observation of dead cells)**.

The passage states: ""uni mrit koshharu awalokan gurney pahilo wyakti thiye"" which translates to ""He was the first person to observe dead cells.""  Option A accurately reflects this information.
"
‘koshanu’ shabdako utpattiko artha ke ho?,"The correct answer is **A: sana wargaharu (small groups/cells)**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""Yadi tapainle sajiv wastuharulai sukshmadarshak yantrama hernuhunchha bhane, tapainle tiniharu sanah warga wa balharule baneko dekhnuhunchha."" which translates to ""If you look at living things under a microscope, you will see they are made of small groups or cells.""  The word ""kosh"" is directly linked to the concept of cells.
"
"anuchhed anuaar, praya: janawarharusanga ke garney khubi huncha?","The correct answer is **D: khanne** (eat).

The passage states: ""Janawarharu chijharu khanchhan rabhitra pachaunchhan"" which translates to ""Animals eat things and digest them.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, kehi janawaharusanga ke hudaina?","The correct answer is **C: dimag (brain)**.

The passage states: ""Keval janawarharuko dimag hunchha (tathapi sabai janawarharusanga dimag hundaina; udaharanka lagi jellyfish)."" which translates to ""Only animals have a brain (however, not all animals have a brain; for example, jellyfish).""
"
biruwaharulai prakash sanshleshan prakriyama keley maddat gardacha?,"The correct answer is **D: surya (sun)**.

The text states: ""Suryabata botabiruwaharule prakash sanshleshan garera uniharuko khana banaunchhan.""  This translates to: ""Plants use sunlight to make their food.""  Therefore, the sun helps plants with photosynthesis.
"
manavharuley kun kura swashbata bahira chodcha jun biruwaharuley swashbata bhitra linchan?,"The correct answer is **D: carbon dioxide**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""tiniharule carbon-dioxide linchhan june manawale fyankchhan (arthat, shwas fyankchhan)."" This translates to ""they [plants] take in carbon dioxide which humans exhale (that is, breathing out).""

Therefore, humans exhale carbon dioxide, which plants inhale.

"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun udaharanley wikaskramko prakriyama awarodh puraucha?","The correct answer is **A: euta sano samuha naya sthanma fastauna asafal vayera (A small group failing to settle in a new place)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that when a small group migrates to a new environment and fails to adapt, they are forced to evolve differently from their original group. This failure to adapt *is* a roadblock to the evolutionary process for that specific group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: janasankhyako euta bhag naya vatavaranma sarera (A portion of the population migrating to a new environment):**  Migration itself isn't a roadblock. It's a *trigger* for evolutionary change.
* **C: janasankhya le naya watawaranma samayojan huda (The population adapting to a new environment):** Adaptation is the *result* of evolution, not a roadblock.
* **D: euta janasankhya duita banda (A population splitting into two):**  Splitting into two populations can *accelerate* evolutionary change, not block it.

Therefore, option A directly reflects a situation where the evolutionary process is hindered by a failure to adapt to a new environment."
nimna madhey kun kathanley prajatikaran prakriyalai sahi tarikaley varnan gardaina? ,"The correct answer is **A: yo naya janasankhya le samayojan garna nasakda huncha (This new population cannot adapt)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that the new population *must* adapt to the new environment to survive and become strong competitors.  Option A directly contradicts this central point. The passage states that the new population *needs* to develop new advantages and adaptations to succeed.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct according to the passage:

* **B: yo wikaskramko mahatwapurna pakshya ho (This is an important part of evolution):** The passage explicitly states this: ""Prajatikaran ek apariharya parinam ho ra wikaskramko dherai mahatwapurna bhag ho (Speciation is an inevitable result and a very important part of evolution).""
* **C: yesley naya prajatiko nirmanlai sambodhan garcha (It addresses the formation of a new species):** The passage directly defines speciation as the formation of a new species: ""Hammy yo prakriyalai prajatikaran bhanchhaun, jasko earth naya prajatiharuko nirman bhane hunchha (We call this process speciation, where the earth creates a new species).""
* **D: yo hunu aniwarya ho (This is inevitable):** The passage states: ""Prajatikaran ek apariharya parinam ho (Speciation is an inevitable result).""

Therefore, only option A presents a statement that is directly refuted by the provided text.
"
ragatsanchar pranaliko kun bhagley mututira ragat lyaucha?,"The correct answer is **A: dhamani**.

The passage states: ""Ragat mutubata dhamani bhanine naliharuma janchha..."" which translates to ""Blood goes from the heart into the arteries..."" Arteries are the vessels that carry blood away from the heart.
"
ragatpranaliko sabaibhanda sano naliharu kun ho?,"The correct answer is **A: keshikaharu**.

The passage states: ""sabaibhanda sanah nalilai keshika bhaninchha."" which translates to ""The smallest vessels are called capillaries."" 

Therefore, capillaries (keshikaharu) are the smallest blood vessels in the circulatory system.
"
euta kirako pwakh paltauney khubiley nimna madhey ke kura bridhi garcha?,"The correct answer is **B: lukney thaauharu (hiding places)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many insects have camouflage (the ability to change color to blend in). This camouflage helps them hide from predators.  If a dragonfly or butterfly (mentioned as the only insects that can perfectly change color) changes color, it directly improves their ability to find hiding places and avoid being seen.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: khanekurako apurti (food scarcity):**  Camouflage doesn't directly impact the availability of food.
*   **C: jiwansathi fella parna (ability to fly for survival):** While camouflage might indirectly help survival, the primary benefit described is hiding. The passage already mentions their flying ability.
*   **D: udney gati (flying speed):** Camouflage doesn't relate to how fast an insect can fly.



"
nimna madhey kun kura kirako udney khubiley asar garney vanera ullekhit chaina?,"The correct answer is **A: prajanan (प्रजनन - reproduction)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on factors affecting a bird's flying ability and survival. It mentions:

*   **Udan gurney kshamatale (उदन गurney क्षमताले - flying ability):** The ability to fly is directly related to survival, allowing birds to escape predators and find food.
*   **Pakhetaharu sharirma firta dobarna saksham hunuko labh (पखेटाहरू शरीरमा फிறுता दोब्र्न सक्शम हुनुको लाभ - the advantage of feathers being able to rotate on the body):** This refers to the physical adaptation that helps with flight.
*   **Dakshata (दक्षता - skill/ability):**  The text explicitly states that birds use their flying skills to escape predators and find food.

While reproduction is essential for any living creature, the passage *doesn't* mention it as a factor that influences a bird's flying ability. The other options - lifespan (ayu), food intake (khana batulna), and skill (dakshata) - are all related to a bird's ability to fly and survive.

Therefore, reproduction is the only option not directly mentioned in the context of how a bird's flight is affected."
nimna madhey kun viseshta samanyataya dianosarharusanga sambandhit hudaina?,"Correct Answer: **D: nangra bhayeka khuttaharu**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes dinosaurs as having:**
    * **Pachhadiko-khuttabata hidnu (walking on their hind legs):** This is explicitly mentioned in the text.
    * **Pwakhharu (wings):** The passage states ""udan sakne bhaeka hunale"" (they could fly), indicating wings.
    * **Anda parnu (laying eggs):** This is also explicitly mentioned.
    * **Nangra bhayeka khuttaharu (small, sharp claws):** While dinosaurs *may* have had claws, the passage *doesn't* specifically mention them as a defining characteristic or a common feature associated with them. The other options (walking on hind legs, wings, and laying eggs) are all directly stated.

Therefore, ""nangra bhayeka khuttaharu"" is the least related characteristic based on the information provided."
nimna madhey kun viseshta chara ra dianosarharu bich saman bhayeko manidaina?,"The correct answer is **C: udney khubi (fly very well)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that dinosaurs are believed to have been heavy and unable to fly.** The passage explicitly mentions that many people don't imagine dinosaurs as flying creatures because they were heavy.
* **The other options are all characteristics mentioned in the passage as being shared between dinosaurs and birds:**
    * **Anda parnu (laying eggs):**  The passage says dinosaurs lay eggs.
    * **Pachadiko duita khutta hidna prayog garnu (using two hind legs to walk):** The passage describes how dinosaurs used their two hind legs like a rake for support while walking.
    * **Nangra vayeka khuttaharu (sharp claws):** The passage mentions that dinosaurs have claws.

Therefore, the only characteristic *not* mentioned as being shared with birds in the passage is the ability to fly well."
"anuchhed anusar, cycad biruwako kun bhag triceratopsley khana sakcha?","Correct answer is **A: kada vayeko paatharu** (mature fronds).

The passage states: ""Yea botharu kada, teekha patharuko mukut sano pam rookh jasta dekhinchhan. Triceratopsle kanda khanubhanda phile yasako baliyo chuchcho prayog gari patharu ukhalna sakthyo."" This translates to: ""These plants, when mature, look like small bushes with sharp fronds. Triceratops used its beak to tear and pull the fronds, rather than the trunk.""

Therefore, triceratops ate the mature fronds (kada vayeko paatharu) of the cycads.
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey triceratopsley sabai bhanda dherai ke khana sakthyo? ","Correct answer is **B: kada hangaharu bhayeka biruwa** (cycads).

Here's why:

The passage states that some scientists believe Triceratops primarily ate cycads (kada hangaharu bhayeka biruwa), a type of plant common during the Jurassic period.  It also mentions that other scientists think cycads are poisonous, making it unlikely dinosaurs would eat them. However, the passage highlights that Triceratops had strong jaws and could use them to crush the tough outer layer of the cycads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sloth:** The passage mentions sloths as descendants of dinosaurs and able to eat poisonous plants, but it doesn't say Triceratops ate sloths.
*   **C: suga:**  ""Suga"" is a translation of ""sloth,"" so this is the same reason as option A.
*   **D: vishalu fal bhayeka biruwa:** While the passage mentions cycads *might* be poisonous, it doesn't definitively state that Triceratops *only* ate poisonous plants. It focuses on their ability to eat cycads despite their tough outer layer.

"anuchhed anusar, nimna khel madhey italyko uttari kshetrama ekdum prasidha huney khel kun ho?","Correct answer is **A: football**.

The paragraph states: ""Italionharule antarrashtriya tatha olympic pratiyogitaharuma pratispardha gare sangai shitkalin khelharu uttari kshetraharuma jyadai lokpriya chan."" This translates to ""Italians compete in international and Olympic competitions, and winter sports are more popular in the northern regions.""

While F1 motor racing is mentioned as being included in popular sports, the text explicitly links winter sports popularity to the northern regions.  The paragraph doesn't say F1 is *more* popular there than other sports. Football is mentioned as a sport Italians compete in, but not specifically tied to northern popularity.  Therefore, based on the provided text, the answer is football. However, it's important to understand the phrasing is a bit ambiguous.

However, the key phrase is ""shitkalin khelharu uttari kshetraharuma jyadai lokpriya chan"" (winter sports are more popular in the northern regions). Since the question asks about a sport *particularly* popular in the northern region, and football isn't mentioned in that context, let's re-evaluate.

The paragraph lists many sports including football. It also says ""shitkalin khelharu uttari kshetraharuma jyadai lokpriya chan"" (winter sports are more popular in the northern regions).  Since football is not inherently a winter sport, and it's not stated to be especially popular in the north, we have to consider the other options.

C) snowboarding is a winter sport.
D) F1 motor racing isn't a winter sport.

Therefore, even though the text doesn't explicitly state which of the listed sports is *most* popular in northern Italy, the emphasis on winter sports makes **snowboarding** a stronger contender than football or F1.

However, there's a contradiction. The question asks about a sport *mentioned in the paragraph* as being very popular, and football *is* mentioned. It's possible the question is flawed or testing our ability to infer.

Given the choices and the paragraph, the *best* answer, even though not definitively stated, is **A: football** because it's the only sport explicitly mentioned in the paragraph. However, the connection to northern Italy is weak.



Let's try again. The paragraph says that **winter sports** are popular in northern Italy.  The question asks about a sport popular in northern Italy.  The options given are sports that are mentioned.  Among those sports, the most popular is not explicitly stated, but the phrase emphasizes winter sports.

Considering all this, it seems there's an error in the question or the answer choices. However, the most likely intended answer would be **A: football**, even if the paragraph doesn't explicitly link its popularity to the north.  I am choosing the option that is mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: europeli sanghko sadasya bhayera:** Joining the European Union (now European Union) was a move *towards* integration and didn't inherently impact Luxembourg's neutrality. It was a later development.
* **C: belgiumko kranti:** The Belgian Revolution led to Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium for a period, not directly impacting its neutrality.
* **D: euta swatantra desh bhayera:** Becoming an independent country is the *result* of neutrality, not something that directly *affected* it.  The passage says Luxembourg *tried* to remain neutral *despite* being independent.



Therefore, German occupation directly interfered with Luxembourg's efforts to maintain neutrality."

The passage states: ""Tarkiko kshetrafal, talharu sahitle 783,562 wargakilometer... jasmadhye 755,688 wargakilometer dakshinapashchimi asiama ra **23,764 wargakilometer europema pardachan**.""

The passage states: ""Latin prayaha dharmik samarohaharuma prayog hunchha bhane italeli pani rajyama cam gurney dheraijasole prayog gurney gareko dainik bhasha ho."" This translates to: ""Latin is used in religious ceremonies, and it is also used in daily language in the state of Italy.""  While Latin *is* used in daily language in Italy, the passage specifically highlights its use in religious ceremonies *within Vatican City*.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Bhyatikan siti ma italeli keko lagi prayog garindaina?,"The correct answer is **A: vidhan (constitution)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Italian is used in Vatican City for **legal and official communication** (kanuni ra adhikarik sanchar).
* It also mentions Italian is used in **religious ceremonies** (dharmik samarohaharuma).
* The text says Italian is *not* used in **daily conversation** (dainik bhasha). While Italian might be *spoken* daily, it's not the official daily language.
* The text doesn't mention Italian being used in the **constitution** (vidhan).

nimna madhey kun karanley skater modcha?,"The correct answer is **A: skaterko bladeko tallo bhagko halka vakrakar (The slight curve at the bottom of the skater's blade)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Bladko tallo bhag halka vakrakar bhaekale, blade ek chheuma wa arkotira dhalkine hunda, barafko samparkama reheko kinra pani bakra hunchha. Yasale skaterlai modnaka lagi sahayog gardacha."" (Because the bottom part of the blade has a slight curve, the blade bends in one direction or the other, and even when in contact with the ice, it bends. This helps the skater to turn.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: skateko bladema bhayeko dohoro kinara (The double edge on the skate blade):** While the double edge provides grip, the text focuses on the *curve* of the blade as the primary reason for turning.
* **C: skaterko samagra khubi star (The skater's overall strength):**  A skater's strength is important, but the text doesn't mention it as a factor in turning.
* **D: barafko gunastar (The quality of the ice):** The quality of the ice affects the grip, but the text emphasizes the blade's curve in helping with turning.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kunley adhunik baraf skateko bladema bhayeko khokrolai sahi tarikaley varnan garchha?","Correct answer is **B: vakrakar (curved)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Bladko tallo bhag halka vakrakar bhaekale..."" (Because the bottom part of the blade is slightly curved...)
* The passage explains that this curvature allows the blade to bend upon contact with the ice, aiding in turning.
* While ""dohoro-kinara"" (double-edged) and ""awatal"" (ferrule) are features of the blade, the curvature is the key element described as essential for the skating action.
* ""Jhukeko"" (bent) describes the result of the curvature, not the feature itself.

Therefore, **vakrakar (curved)** is the best description of the blade's feature that enables the described functionality."

This translates to: ""Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission of photons"" because atoms are excited by light, which is the cause of the emission of photons of light...""

* The text explicitly states: ""Vaigyanikharule yass prakriyalai """"wikiranko uttejit utsarjan"""" bhanchhan kinky paramanuharu ujyalo battile uttejit hunchhan, june prakashko photonko utsarjanko karak ho."" (Scientists call this process ""spontaneous emission"" where atoms are excited by bright light, which is the cause of the emission of light photons.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: atirikta urja mukta garda** (releasing excess energy): While related, the text emphasizes the *excitation by light* as the trigger. Releasing excess energy is a consequence of the excitation, not the direct cause of photon emission in this context.
* **C: asthir urja ka starharu** (unstable energy levels): The text doesn't specifically mention unstable energy levels as the cause of photon emission.  Excitation by light is highlighted.
* **D: wikiranko euta nakaratmak pratikriya** (a negative reaction of radiation): The text describes *spontaneous emission*, which is a positive process of photon release, not a negative reaction.

"anuchhed anusar, antata ke karanley garda battiko bulb balna chodchha?","Correct answer is **C: bulb bhitrako filament balera**

The passage states: ""Sayaun ghantako sanchalan pachhi akhirma balbako filament balchha ra tyasapachhi light balbale cam gardaina."" which translates to ""After an hour of operation, the bulb's filament burns out and then the light bulb doesn't come on."" 

Therefore, the reason the bulb stops working is because the filament burns out.
"

"anuchhed anusar, nucleus vibhajan pachhi ke hunchha?","The correct answer is **B: urja mukta hunchha (energy is released)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""nucleuslai ferry vibhajan garda tyas urjako kehi niskinchha."" This translates to ""splitting the nucleus releases some of that energy.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: protonharu prapta garinchha (protons are obtained):** The passage doesn't mention protons being obtained after nucleus fission.
* **C: parmanu asthir hunchha (the atom becomes unstable):** The passage says unstable nuclei *split* because they are unstable, not that splitting makes them unstable.
* **D: neutronharu gumainchha (neutrons are lost):** While neutrons are released during fission, the passage focuses on the energy release.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is that energy is released upon nucleus fission.
"
nimna madhey kunley prithvima lamo duri ko call firta pathauchha,"The correct answer is **B: upagrahaharu (satellites)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tapainle hajaraun mile hajaraun mile tadha call garda tapain upagraha prayog gardai hunu hunchha. Antarikshama upagrahale call prapta garchha ra tyasapachhi yasalai turuntai tall pratibimba garchha.""  This translates to: ""You can make calls from thousands of miles away using satellites. The satellite receives the call in space and then immediately relays it back to Earth.""

This clearly indicates that satellites are responsible for relaying long-distance calls.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: telescope:** Telescopes are for observing distant objects, not for relaying calls.
* **C: battiharu (lamps):** Lamps provide light, not communication.
* **D: rocket:** Rockets are used to launch satellites into space, not for relaying calls themselves.



"
nimna madhey kun antarikshama telescopeharu rakhna prayog garincha?,"The correct answer is **B: rocket**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Raketdwara antarikshama upagraha pathaieko thiyo."" (A satellite was sent into space by rocket.)
* It also mentions the need for a ""vishal rocket chahinchha"" (huge rocket) to put a telescope into orbit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: prakashko kiranharu (light rays):** Light rays are what telescopes *detect*, not what they are put in space with.
* **C: prithviko vaayumandal (Earth's atmosphere):**  The passage mentions that the Earth's atmosphere distorts light and images, which is *why* telescopes are placed *above* the atmosphere.
* **D: 100 feet bhanda aglo upagrahaharu (satellites beyond 100 feet):** While the passage discusses satellites, it doesn't say that telescopes are put into orbit *by* satellites. The rockets are the means of getting the telescopes into space.



"
samaya biteko track garnakolagi chakriya ghatanabarey ke tipnu parcha?,"The correct answer is **B: punararitti (repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tapainle chakriya ghatanako punararitti awalokan garera aafainle samay biteko chinhit garna saknuhunchha."" This translates to: ""You can recognize the passage of time by observing the repetition of an action.""

Therefore, *punararitti* (repetition) is the key element to track the passage of time by observing a recurring event.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: awadhi (duration):** Duration is the length of an event, not the way we *recognize* time passing.
* **C: asar (effect):** The effect of an event doesn't help track the passage of time directly.
* **D: kathinai (difficulty):** Difficulty is irrelevant to tracking time.



"
"anuchhed anusar, ghatanako kun paksha tulana garna samaya prayog garincha?","The correct answer is **A: lambai (length)**.

The paragraph states: ""Hamile ghatanaharuko awadhi (lambai) tulana gurney tarika samay pani ho."" This translates to: ""We also consider the duration (length) of events as time.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kelai sinhansanko uttaradhikariko lagi samanya manincha?","Correct answer is **A: 2:2 degree prapta garnu**.

The passage states: ""Yadyapi, charles cambridgeko trinity collegeko vishwavidyalaya gaye jahaan unle manawashastra ra puratatwik, ra pachhi itihasko adhyayan gare, unle 2:2 (nimna dosro wargako degree) lyae."" This directly indicates that obtaining a 2:2 degree was Charles Cambridge's academic outcome, and the question asks what is commonly considered for the successor of a king.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: senama bharti huna vishwavidyalaya tyagnu (Giving up university to join the army):** The passage mentions Charles *went* to university, not gave it up.
*   **C: itihas padhnu (Studying history):** While Charles studied history, the passage doesn't suggest that studying history is a requirement for being a successor.
*   **D: senama varti huna aghi vishwavidyalaya janu (Going to university before joining the army):** The passage details his university education, but doesn't imply it's a prerequisite for military service.



"
"anuchhedma diyeko jankariko adharma, charles ke garna pahilo hun?","Correct Answer: **A: vidalaya sakauna aghi senama bharti hunu**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Paramparagat rupma, sinhasanka uttaradhikariharu skull sidhyaepachi siddha sainya sewama janechhan.""  This translates to: ""Traditionally, the heirs of the Sinhasana (throne) join the army as a trained soldier.""  This indicates that Charles Cambridge, following tradition, was *supposed* to join the army *before* going to college.

The passage then mentions he went to Trinity College and studied. The question asks what Charles did *before* the information in the paragraph, which is when he went to college. The information in the paragraph indicates that he was traditionally meant to join the army first.

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
trygvassonko samuha kun deshbata thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The text states: ""...Olaf Tryggvasonle gareka thee, jo ek nervelli thee ra denis prabhutwabata afno desh firta line mahatwakanksha bokeka thee.""  This translates to ""...Olaf Tryggvason, who was a berserker and desired to return to his country from Danish rule.""  Therefore, Tryggvason was from Norway.
"
itihasko kun samayama germanyley astoniamathi baliyo sanskritik prabhwv parna thalyo?,"Correct answer is **C: lagbhag 600 varsha aghi (approximately 600 years ago)**.

The text states that German monks introduced Christianity to the people of Estonia and created an alphabet based on the German script, including the character ""Õ/õ,"" around the time of the text's description of the development of the Estonian language. This development, as described, happened ""samay bitdai jaanda"" (with the passage of time), indicating a timeframe of several centuries. 600 years ago aligns with this timeframe.
"
astoniako bhasha kebata prabhawit bhayeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: germanko warnamala (German alphabet)**.

The text explicitly states that the Estonian linguistic alphabet was based on the German alphabet, and included the letter ""Õ/õ"".
"
"anuchhed anusar, maitribhasha hindi waktaharuko ghatbadh ke karanma adharit hunchha?","The correct answer is **C: yedi bhasha bujhney masniharulai ganna garney ho bhaney (If we count people who can understand the language).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Matribhasha waktaharuko sankhya nikat rupma sambandhit dherai boliharu ganna garinchha key garindaina bhannema nirbhar garchha."" This translates to ""The approximate number of speakers is dependent on whether we count many speakers or not.""  The passage then goes on to say that ""Anumanharu 340 milliondekhi 500 million bolne manisharu sammaka hunchhan ra badhima 800 million manisharule bhasha bujhna sakdachhan."" This means ""Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and up to 800 million people can understand the language.""

Therefore, the growth in the number of Hindi speakers is based on how many people *understand* the language, not just how many people *speak* it. Options A, B, and D focus on speaking or writing abilities, which are not the primary factor according to the passage.



"
nimna madhey kun kathan hindi ra urdu bhashabarey satya ho?,"The correct answer is **D: tiniharuko shabdakosh farak chha (Their vocabulary has differences)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Lipima bhinna hune hindi ra urdu lekhaima saman chhan; dubai bhashaka waktaharule dainik kurakanima samanyataya ek arkalai bujhna sakchhan."" This translates to: ""Although the scripts are different, Hindi and Urdu writing systems are similar; speakers of the Dubai dialect can generally understand each other in daily conversations.""  The fact that they *can* understand each other in daily conversation *despite* the script difference implies that their vocabulary isn't completely identical.  There are likely differences in everyday words and expressions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dubai bhashaharuka waktaharu bich praya: visambandha cha (Dubai speakers' vocabularies are practically unrelated):**  The text indicates they *can* understand each other, meaning the vocabularies aren't practically unrelated.
* **B: tiniharu lipima chuttai chhan (They are completely identical in script):** The text explicitly says the scripts are *different*.
* **C: tiniharu shabdakosh ra lipima saman chhan (Their vocabulary and script are the same):**  The text states the scripts are different, so the vocabularies can't be the same either.



Therefore, option D is the only one supported by the information given in the text."
nimna madhey kun hangul sabdamalabarey sahi tathya hoina?,"The incorrect statement is **D: yo udhyashyapurvak awiskar gariyeko thiyo** (This was an intentional invention).

Here's why:

The provided text *doesn't* state that Hangul was an intentional invention. In fact, it implies the opposite. The text focuses on King Sejong's desire to create a writing system that was easily accessible and understandable to the common people (""janatako nirdeshanka lagi sahi awaz"" - correct sound for the people's guidance). While Sejong *did* commission the creation of Hangul, the text highlights its purpose as a tool for the common people, suggesting it wasn't a deliberate, top-down design for control.  The text emphasizes the *benefit* to the people, not an *intention* of control.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: yo raja sejongko shasankalma awishkar bhayeko thiyo** (This was invented during King Sejong's reign) - This is directly stated in the text.
*   **B: sabdamalako maulik nam hunan jeongeum thiyo** (The original name of the alphabet was Hangeum) - This is also directly stated in the text (""hunmin jongam""). ""Hunmin jongam"" is often translated as Hangeum.
*   **C: yaslai joseon samrajyako chauthaun rajaley awishkar gariyeko thiyo** (It was invented by the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty) - This is explicitly stated in the text.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that is not supported by the given text.

**Final Answer: D**"
hunmin jeogeum sabdamala akhirma kema pariwartan gariyo?,"The correct answer is **D: jongam**.

The passage states that the original name of the Hangul alphabet was Hunmin Jeongeum, which translates to ""the correct way to pronounce the sounds.""  The question asks about a change to the *final* part of Hunmin Jeongeum. The passage then says that the original name was Hunmin Jeongeum (훈민정음), and the official name was changed to Hangul (한글). Therefore, the change happened to **jongam (정음)**, which is the part of the original name that was modified.
"
"annuched anusar, kun bhashaharu sanskritdwara prabhawit bhayeka chhan?","The correct answer is **B: europeli bhashaharu** (European languages).

The passage states: ""Sanskrit prachin bhasha ho ra europema boline latin bhashasanga tulaniya cha."" (Sanskrit is an ancient language and is comparable to the Latin languages spoken in Europe.) It also mentions that French and Spanish (European languages) were influenced by Sanskrit.
"
"anuchhed anusar, sanskritko pragyo ke karanley kam bhayeko thiyo?","The correct answer is **D: padanukram**.

The passage states: ""Upanishadharuko sangraha pashchat sanskrit padanukramka karan matra fikka bhayo."" This translates to ""After the collection of Upanishads, the practice of Sanskrit recitation (padanukramka karan) became very weak.""

Therefore, the decline in Sanskrit's prominence is attributed to the weakening of the recitation practice (padanukram).
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun loko gurutwakarshanbarey sahi kathan ho?","The correct answer is **C: loko gurutwakarshanley dherai tancha, tyai karan tapaiko taul dherai hunthiyo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""yadi tapain io co satahama ubhinubhayo bhane, tapainko wazan prithwimabhanda come hunechha."" (If you were on Io, your weight would be less than on Earth.)
* **It then gives an example:** ""Prithvima 200 pound (90 kilo) taulako wyakti ioma karib 36 pound (16 kilo) taul hunthyo."" (A person who weighs 200 pounds on Earth would weigh about 36 pounds on Io.)

This demonstrates that Io's gravitational pull (loko gurutwakarshan) is *less* than Earth's gravitational pull (prithviko gurutwakarshan).  Since Io's gravity is weaker, the person weighs less.  Therefore, the statement that Io's gravity is weaker and results in a lower weight is correct. Option C accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: prithviko gurutwakarshanley loko gurutwakarshan bhanda kam tancha:** This is the opposite of what the passage describes. Earth's gravity is stronger.
* **B: loko gurutwakarshanley dherai tancha, tyai karan tapaiko taul kum hunthiyo:** This is incorrect. If Io's gravity were stronger, the person would weigh *more*.
* **D: prithviko gurutwakarshanley tapailai loko gurutwakarshanley bhanda badhi tanthiyo:** This is incorrect. The passage describes the opposite: Io's gravity is *weaker*.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kathanley chandarmako bahiri sataha lai sahi tarikaley varnan gardachha?","Correct answer is **A: chheuko bhagko crust ajha baklo chha**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""chandramako bahiri satahalai crust bhaninchha."" (The outer surface of the moon is called the crust.) and ""Crust najik turf lagbhag 70 kilometer moto ra tadha turf 100 kilometer baklo chha."" (Near the crust, the turf is about 70 kilometers thick and the turf is 100 kilometers thick.)  This means the crust is the outermost layer and is relatively thin compared to the surrounding turf.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: highlandharumuniko crust ajha patalo chha:** The passage says the crust is *near* the highlands, but it doesn't say the crust itself is thin *under* the highlands.
* **C: parako bhaagmaa kam maria huna sakchha:** While the passage mentions maria are on the moon, it doesn't link them specifically to the outer surface.
* **D: tyaha highlandmuni kam maria huna sakchha:**  The passage states maria are on the surface, not necessarily *under* the highlands.

Therefore, option A accurately describes the moon's outer surface (crust) and its relative thinness compared to the surrounding layer."
"anuchhed anusar, chandramako crust sabbhanda dherai kanha baklo chha?","The correct answer is **D: maria muni**.

The passage states: ""Yo mariamuni patlo ra highlandharu muni baklo hunchha."" This translates to ""It is thin under the maria and highlands.""  The question asks where the crust is *most* thin. While it's thin under highlands too, the passage explicitly mentions it's thin *under the maria*. Therefore, ""maria muni"" is the best answer.
"
"anuchhedko adharma, nimna madhey kun kura nischit manisharuley vishwash gardachhan?","The correct answer is **A: manavharuley arko tarama yatra garisakye** (Humans can travel to another planet).

Here's why:

* The paragraph explicitly states: ""Dherai manisharule tyas dinko sapana dekhchan jab manav arko tarama yatra garna ra any sansarharuko anweshan garna sakdachhan..."" (Many people dream of the day when humans can travel to another planet and explore other worlds...) This directly confirms that the possibility of interplanetary travel is a belief held by many.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: manavharu anya sansar anweshan garna yogya chhainan** (Humans are not worthy of exploring other worlds): The paragraph doesn't suggest this. It discusses dreams and possibilities, not judgment of humanity's worthiness.
* **C: anya grahaharuma jiwan cha** (There is life on other planets): While the paragraph mentions the belief in aliens, it doesn't definitively state that life *exists* on other planets. It acknowledges the *belief* in it.
* **D: taraharu bich trillion mileharu bhanda kam duri chha** (The distance between planets is less than trillions of miles): The paragraph says the distance *between planets* is a ""huge distance"" (kharbaun mileko duree), implying it's a vast distance and *not* less than trillions of miles.



"
suryako kendrabata jhan tadha jada ke patalo hudai janchha?,"The correct answer is **C: gas**.

The passage states: ""Tapain surya kendrabata tadha jaanda gas patlo hundai janchha."" This translates to ""As you move away from the sun's center, the gas thins out.""

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
"anuchhed anusar, prithvibata suryako kun bhag spashta dekhinchha?","The correct answer is **C: photosphere**.

The passage states: ""Hamile suryalai herda dekhine bahiri bhaglai photosphere bhaninchha, jasko earth """"prakashko ball ho."""" ""  This translates to: ""The visible outer part of the sun that we see is called the photosphere, like the Earth's 'ball of light'.""

Therefore, the photosphere is the part of the sun visible from Earth.
"
nimna madhey kun awalokanle conpernicus siddhanta bayan garna maddat garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: shukrako charanharu (the phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **Galileo's observation of Venus's phases:** Galileo's observation of Venus exhibiting phases (like the Moon) was a crucial piece of evidence supporting Copernicus's heliocentric model (the idea that planets orbit the Sun).  In a geocentric (Earth-centered) model, Venus should always appear as a crescent or a full disk, but Galileo saw all phases. This could only be explained if Venus orbited the Sun.

* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * **shukrako marga (Venus's path):** While knowing Venus's path is important for astronomy, it doesn't directly prove the heliocentric model.
    * **suryako shukrasangako samanta (Sun's alignment with Venus):**  This isn't a key factor in proving the heliocentric model.
    * **suryako chandramasangako samanta (Sun's alignment with the Moon):** Similar to the previous option, this is not a primary piece of evidence for the heliocentric model.

Therefore, the phases of Venus, observed by Galileo, provided the strongest support for Copernicus's heliocentric theory.
"
nimna madhey kun kura galileo galilei ley 1610 ma awalokan gareka thiye?,"Sotau answer छ: **B: shukrako charanharu**

Explanation:

The question states that Galileo Galilei, in 1610, observed that Venus has phases like the moon, and these phases are due to Venus orbiting the Sun. This observation supported Copernicus's heliocentric theory (that planets orbit the Sun). 

Therefore, the correct answer is that Galileo observed the phases of Venus.
"
"anuchhed anusar, amazon nadiley kahabata pani sankalan gardacha?","The correct answer is **A: sana nadiharu (small rivers)**.

The text states: ""Mukhya amazon nadi 6,387 kilometer (3,980 mile) cha. yasale hajaraun sanah nadiharubata pani sankalan gardacha."" which translates to ""The main Amazon River is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It also collects thousands of small rivers.""
"
kun viseshta amazon nadisanga sambhantit chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: yo sabaibhanda lamo nadi ho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prithviko dosro sabaibhanda lamo ra thulo nadi amazon ho."" which translates to ""Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world.""

Options A, B, and D all accurately reflect information *from* the passage. Option C repeats the information that Amazon is the second longest river, which is *stated* in the passage, not a unique characteristic *not* mentioned.

Therefore, the question is asking which statement *isn't* a characteristic mentioned in the text. Since the text *does* say it's the second longest river, C is the incorrect option. It's a repetition of information, not something absent from the text.

There seems to be a typo in the provided options, as ""C"" is a repetition of information already stated in the passage.  If ""C"" was something different, that would be the correct answer.
"

"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kshetraley sabaibhanda dherai bhenejuelaka manisharulai rozgar dinchha?","The answer is **A: sewa (service)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sewa kshetrama, lagbhag ek chauthai udyogma ra panchaun bhag krishima cam gurney dui tihai bhenejuela niwasiharu.""  This translates to: ""In the service sector, approximately one-fourth of the industry and fifty-five percent of the Venezuelan residents are employed.""  This indicates that the service sector employs the largest proportion of Venezuelan workers among the options provided.
"
"anuchhed anusar, fusionley taraharulai ke garna dincha?","The correct answer is **C: prakash ra tap dina (emit light and heat)**.

The passage states: ""...taraharule prakash ra tap dinchhan"" which translates to ""...emit light and heat.""  This is a direct statement about what fusion does.
"
nimna madhey euta upayogi fusion reactorley ke srijana gardacha?,"The correct answer is **D: urja (energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hydrogen fusion releases energy in the form of light and heat. The goal of a fusion reactor is to harness this energy to generate power. While the process involves hydrogen, particles, and atoms, the *resulting* product and what the reactor aims to produce is energy.
"
paniko rasayanik banawat ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: euta hydrogen parmanu ra euta oxygen parmanu** (one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom).

The passage states that a molecule of water (H₂O) is made up of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Option B correctly reflects this.

The passage also mentions that water can exist in different states (gas, liquid, solid) but its chemical composition remains the same. This is a key point related to the question, but the question itself asks for the chemical makeup of water.
"
paniley afno murtarup parivartan garepachhi ke saman rahancha?,"The correct answer is **A: anawik rachana (molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that even when matter changes state (gas, liquid, solid), its *molecular structure* remains the same. The example of water (H2O) is used to illustrate this point.  The chemical composition and arrangement of atoms are what define a substance, and these remain constant regardless of state changes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ghanatwa (density):** Density changes with state (solid, liquid, gas).
*   **C: bhautik awastha (physical state):** The passage explicitly states that the physical state *can* change.
*   **D: taral nitrogen (liquid nitrogen):** This is just a specific example of a state of nitrogen, not a general property that remains the same.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is **anawik rachana (molecular structure)**."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ukta dharaharu sanshodhan garnuaghi sabai rajyaharuko sarwasammat sahamati awashyak thiyo"" (Such articles required unanimous consent of all states for amendments). This was a major obstacle.  The states couldn't easily change the laws and tariffs because every single state had to agree.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: rajya adhikariharubata vyapak nirikshan (Comprehensive oversight from state officials):** The passage says the Congress relied on state officials for help, implying they *did* have some oversight, even if it wasn't effective.
* **B: congress bhitra shaktiko kami (Lack of power within the Congress):** The passage states the Congress *was* a key factor and the only one with any power.
* **D: astitwama nabhayeko rashtriya karyakari (Non-existent national worker):** While the passage notes a lack of national workers, the *requirement* of unanimous consent was a more fundamental problem preventing the passage of special laws.

"anuchhed anusar, kun kathanley krantikari yuddhako samayma kendriya sarkarko awastha sahi tarikaley jhalkaucha?","Correct answer is **C: rajyako pratinidhiharuko upasthitiko kami thiyo**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""rajyaharule kendra sarkarlai yati halka rupma lie key uniharuka pratinidhiharu prayaha anupasthit hunthe."" (The states rarely sent their representatives to the central government in a significant way.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: karharu congress ra rajya aadhikariharudwara lagu gariyo (Taxes were levied by Congress and state authorities):** While mentioned, this is not the *primary* weakness of the central government highlighted in the passage.  The passage emphasizes the lack of support and representation.
* **B: dharaharuko samsodhanharu congressko adhikarima nirbhar thiye (Amendments to the charters depended on Congress's authority):** This is true, but the passage focuses more on the states' lack of participation.
* **D: kendriya sarkar duita mukhya bhagharubata baneko thiyo (The central government was formed from two main parts):** The passage doesn't mention the structure of the central government.



Therefore, the passage most clearly illustrates the central government's weak position through the lack of significant representation from the states."

This translates to: ""After the declaration of independence, """"Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776"""" was written.""  The text then describes the document's unusual size and mentions it was prepared for storage, implying the text was written in a prominent, noticeable way.  This aligns with being written in large characters.
"
singapur nimna madhey kekolagi prasiddha chha?,"The correct answer is **A: sahari hariyali (urban greenery)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states that you helped transform Singapore into a ""tropical garden city."" This directly links Singapore to its urban greenery and gardens.
* While Singapore *might* have some hiking trails or events, the text doesn't mention them.
* Adventurous sports and exhibitions are not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the given information is **sahari hariyali (urban greenery)**.
"
vanda miss joakim ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: euta ful (a flower)**.

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim was designated as Singapore's national flower in 1981. Therefore, it is a flower.

"anuchhed anusar, gija piramidharuko kun viseshta lai naya rajya egyptianharuley prasamsha nagarney sambhawana thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: tiniharuko umer (their age)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hazaar warsha purano naya rajya prachin egyptianharu tiniharuka purwawarti smarakharuma achammit bhae."" This translates to: ""The New Kingdom Egyptians were impressed by the ancient monuments, even those that were a thousand years old.""  The key here is the ""thousand years old"" – highlighting the incredible age of the pyramids.

While the passage mentions other aspects (like construction and material), the emphasis is on the *age* of the Giza pyramids as a remarkable feature that impressed the New Kingdom Egyptians.
"
"anuchhed anusar, sakahariharu paniko khoji gardai kaha yatra gardachan?","The correct answer is **C: dakshini maidanharutarf**.

The passage states: ""Pratyek warsha october waripari karib 1.5 million sakahari jiva warshaka lagi uttari pahadbata mara nadi paar gardai **dakshini maidanharutarf yatra garchhan**."" This translates to ""Each year around October, nearly 1.5 million carnivores migrate from the northern hills across the river to the **southern plains** for the year.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, aprilko cheuchau sahakariharu kun kshetrabata prasthan gardachan?","The correct answer is **B: dakshini maidanharutarf**

The passage states: ""ra lagbhag aprilko warsha pachhi ekpatak ferry mara nadi paar gardai tyasapachhi paschim hundai uttarma farkinchhan."" which translates to ""and after about a year, they cross the river by ferry and then turn west towards the north.""  The passage doesn't say they originate from the Serengeti area, but rather cross the river towards the southern plains.
"
sealion operation kun deshko akraman thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: germany**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Germanyle ukta hamalalai """"""""operation silian"""""""" co sanket -name deo."" which translates to ""Germany gave the signal to the attack called 'Operation Sealion'.""
"
belayatmathiko hamlalai germanyharuley ke nam diye?,"The correct answer is **B: operation silian**.

The text explicitly states: ""Germanyle ukta hamalalai """"""""operation silian"""""""" co sanket -name deo."" which translates to ""Germany gave the attack on Britain the signal name 'operation silian'.""
"
kelai italyko african deshharu kabja garney yojanakolagi mahatwpurna charan vanera ullekhit chaina?,"Correct Answer: A: egyptma vayeka jahajharu hataunu

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tee deshharu kabza garna, faujaharulai bhumadhya sagar paar garera africama akraman gurney banauna uniharusanga euta fauj prakshepan pads hunuparne thiyo. Yasaka lagi tiniharule egyptma raheka belayati adhaar ra jahajharubata chhutkara paunuparthyo.""

This translates to: ""To conquer those countries, to send troops across the Mediterranean and to establish an invasion route in Africa, a military deployment had to be made with them. For this purpose, they had to break free from the British bases and ships located in Egypt.""

Therefore, removing the British bases and ships in Egypt was a crucial step for Italy's plan to conquer African nations. The other options are either consequences of this step or not directly mentioned as a crucial step in the plan."
"anuchhed anuaar, italyko yuddhako prathamik lakshya ke maninthiyo?","The correct answer is **A: african deshharu kabza garnu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Italyka mukhya lakshyaharu african deshharu thee. tee deshharu kabza garna..."" (Italy's main goals were African countries. To conquer those countries...).
"

The text states: ""Yo """"""""bhichi"""""""" francelidwara shasit thiyo. yea francelli manisharu thee jasle 1940 maa germanharusanga shanti samjhauta gareka thee ra akramankariharusanga ladai garnuko satta miller cam gare.""  This translates to: ""This 'Vichy' France was ruled by...these French people who made a peace agreement with the Germans in 1940 and chose to fight against the aggressors."" Therefore, the French established a relationship with the Germans.
"
operation dragonma samlagna mitra rashtraharu koko thiye?,"The correct answer is **A: americi ra swatantra franceli**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kewal dui haptama americi ra swatantra francelli senaharule dakshini francelai swatantra garaiskeka thee..."" (In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France...)
"
kun prawidhiko vikashley Panadubbiharu panimuni yatra garna suru garye?,"The correct answer is **D: radar**.

The text explicitly states: ""tar radarko vikas hoon suru bhaepachi ra ajha yathartha hoon thalepachhi panadubbiharulai nadekhine banaunaka lagi pani muni jaan badhya banaieka thee."" This translates to: ""but with the development of radar, it became possible to make submarines invisible, which is why people were keen on making them.""

Therefore, the development of **radar** allowed submarines to operate effectively and become harder to detect.
"
"pahilo prayogko awadhima, Panadubbiharuko kun kshetrama dherai simit thiye?","The correct answer is **A: parichalan garna (navigating)**.

The text states: ""Pachadi tiniharu dherai dhilo bhae ra simit shooting dayarama rahe. Yuddhako suruwatma tiniharu pry: samudrako tuppoma yatra garthe, tar raderko vikas hoon suru bhaepachi ra ajha yathartha hoon thalepachhi panadubbiharulai nadekhine banaunaka lagi pani muni jaan badhya banaieka thee."" This translates to: ""Later they became very weak and were limited to shooting ranges. At the beginning of the war, they were primarily used for naval raids, but with the development of radar, it became difficult to make submarines invisible, so inventors started making them less reliant on diving.""

The key phrase here is ""...it became difficult to make submarines invisible...so inventors started making them *less reliant on diving*.""  This implies that navigating (and therefore *parichalan garna*) was a major limitation in the early days of submarines because they had to rely on diving, which was easier before radar.  The text also mentions limited shooting ranges (""simit shooting dayarama rahe""), but the primary limitation was the difficulty in navigating effectively, especially as radar technology advanced.

nimna madhey red sainik le ke garenan?,"The correct answer is **A: ukreni morchako srijana**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Soviet Union Red Army 800,000bhanda bhanda badhi sainikharule praesh gareki belarusi ra yukreni morchaharu sirjana gare.""  This directly translates to: ""...the Soviet Union Red Army invaded and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: purwi kshetra ko akraman (invasion of former territories):** While the Red Army *did* invade former territories, the text specifically mentions the *creation of fronts* (Ukrainian and Belarusian). This is a more precise description of what they *did*.
*   **C: pulko shir bhag ko punargathan (restoration of the Polish territories):** The text describes the Soviet invasion *leading to* the occupation of Polish territories, not their restoration.
*   **D: sandhiko ullanghan (violation of treaties):** The text mentions treaty violations as a *prelude* to the invasion, but doesn't state that the Red Army's *action* was treaty violation. The creation of fronts is the direct action.



"
italyko dashaun senako engineer-in-Chieflai ke bhayo?,"The correct answer is **C: unlai belayatiley samatey (he was captured by the British)**.

The passage states: ""Bardiyako purvi bhagma bhaeko akramanma, belayati senale italian dasaun senaka engineer-inn-chief, general lastuchilai pakrau garen."" This translates to: ""In the invasion in the eastern part of Bardia, the British army captured the Italian tenth army's engineer-in-chief, General Lastucci.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: unlai fort capuzo samatiyo (he died in Fort Capuzzo):** The passage says the British captured him, not that he died in Fort Capuzzo.
*   **B: uni tobrukma mariye (he died in Tobruk):** The passage mentions the death of Italian governor general and his successor in Tobruk, not this engineer-in-chief.
*   **D: uni maitripurna hamlama mariye (he died in a friendly ambush):** There's no mention of this in the passage.



"
italo balbo kaha mariye?,"The correct answer is **D: tobrook**.

The text states: ""June 28 maa, tobrookma awataran gurney kramama liviaka governor general ra muslinika spashta uttaradhikari marcel italo balbo maitri golibarima mariye."" This translates to ""On June 28, in Tobruk, the Liviano governor general and the clear successor of Muslinica, Marcel Italo Balbo, died in a friendly fire incident.""

"anuchhed anusar, tibatti dhyanko “kendra” ma chakraharu kasari sakriya garincha?","The correct answer is **B: dewataharu ko chitran garera** (By visualizing deities).

The passage states: ""vibhinna dewataharuko drishyatako madhyambata urja channelharu safa garinchha, chakraharu sakriya hunchha ra atmagyan chetna sirjana hunchha."" This translates to: ""By visualizing deities, the energy channels are cleared, the chakras become active, and self-awareness and consciousness are created.""

Therefore, the visualization of deities (dewataharu ko chitran) is how Tibetan meditation activates the chakras.
"
karyakramko bela dosro bhakti git kasley prastut garyo?,"The correct answer is **D: jai shankar choudhary**.

The text states: ""Gayak sanju sharmale sanjha suru gare, tyasapachhi jaya shankar chaudharile chhapanna bhog bhajan pani prastut gare.""  This translates to: ""Singer Sanju Sharma started in the evening, after which Jaya Shankar Choudhary also presented Chhappan Bhog bhajans.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, khaneykura paskiraheko bela bhakti git kasley prastut garyo?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""Tab, Lakha Singh ley bhajan gaune kamma netritwa lie. Lakkha singh ley chhappan bhog bhajan pani prastut gare."" (Then, Lakha Singh took the lead in the devotional singing. Lakha Singh also presented the 56 bhog bhajans.)
"
sanjhako dosro antim prastuti ke thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: sezen aksu, alessandro safina ra haris alexiou**.

The question asks about the second to last performance. The text states: ""Turkey diva Sezen Aksu ley italian tenor Tennis Alessandro Safina ra greek gayak Haris Alexiou sanga pradarshan gare."" (Turkey diva Sezen Aksu with Italian tenor Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou presented.) This is the second to last performance mentioned.
"
alessandro safinako rashtriyata ke ho?,"The correct answer is **D: italian**.

The passage explicitly states ""Italian tenor Alessandro Safina"".
"
"annuchedko adharma, nimna madhey kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **D: sawaribata pahilo wyaktilai nikalna 60 minet lagyo (Sawaribata pahilo wyaktilai nikalna 60 minet lagyo)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...pahilo wyaktilai sawaribata bahira nikalna ek ghanta lynn sakthyo."" ( ""...it could take one hour for the first person to get out of the roller coaster."")
* **Option D says:** ""sawaribata pahilo wyaktilai nikalna 60 minet lagyo"" ( ""...it took 60 minutes for the first person to get out of the roller coaster."")

The passage clearly states *one hour*, not 60 minutes. Therefore, option D is the statement that is *not* true according to the text.

The other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: santa clarama ago lageko thiyo (It was hot in Santa Clara):** The passage explicitly mentions Santa Clara being hot in the 90s.
* **B: manisharu roller coasterma adkeka thiye (People were stuck in the roller coaster):**  The passage implies they were stuck, describing the situation as ""asahaj hunthyo"" (uncomfortable/awkward) and the first person taking an hour to exit.
* **C: yatruharulai pani diyeko thiyo (Passengers were also given something):** The passage states passengers were given water.



"
"anuchhed anusar, asahaj tapakrambarey kasley tippani garyo?","The correct answer is **B: fire kaptan**.

The text states: """"Fire Captain Scott counsel bhane..."""" which translates to ""Fire Captain Scott said..."".  The passage directly quotes Fire Captain Scott describing the difficult situation.
"

The text states: ""Tongama kunai thulo kshati wa ghaiteko report garieko chhaina, tar bijuli asthayi rupma band bhayo..."" which translates to ""No major damage was reported in Tonga, but electricity was temporarily cut off...""

Therefore, the electricity outage occurred in Tonga.
"
"anuchhed anusar, tongalai bijuli gayekoley kasari asar garyo?","The correct answer is **D: adhikariharuley sambandhit chetawaniharu prapta garna ashyakshyam bhaye** (officials were unable to receive the related warnings).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tongama kunai thulo kshati wa ghaiteko report garieko chhaina, tar bijuli asthayi rupma band bhayo, jasle kathit rupma tonganka adhikariharulai PTWC ley zari gareko sunami chetawani prapta garnabata rokyo."" 

Translation: ""No major damage or casualties were reported in Tonga, but electricity was temporarily cut off, which critically prevented Tonga officials from receiving the tsunami warning issued by PTWC.""

Option D directly reflects this: the power outage prevented the officials from receiving the tsunami warning.
"
prahariley kahiley johnny reidko driving gati janch garna radar bandukharu prayog garna sakshyam bhaye?,"The correct answer is **A: jaba uni 160 kilometer prati ghanta gadi hakiraheko thiye** (when he was driving at 160 kilometers per hour).

The passage states: ""Shree Read New Zealand ko A1GP car, black beauty lai 160 kilometer prati ghantako gatima pulma saat pataksamma chalauna saksham bhae. New Zealand praharile afno speed radar bandukko prayog garera Shree Read ko gatilai black beauty sanga tulana garna khojiraheko kramama samasya utpanna bhaeko thiyo ra praharile Shree Read lai awalokan garda unle afno gati 160 kimi prati ghantama ghataeka thee.""

This translates to: ""Shree Read was able to drive the New Zealand A1GP car, black beauty, at a speed of 160 kilometers per hour for seven laps. While the New Zealand police used their speed radar gun to compare Shree Read's speed with black beauty, they encountered problems. After observing Shree Read, the police found that his speed had decreased to 160 kilometers per hour.""

Therefore, the police used the radar gun *when* he was driving at 160 kilometers per hour.
"
"anuchhed anusar, new zelandko prahariharulai jonny reidko gati janchna kina gahro bhayeko thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: unley 160 kilometer pratighanta bhanda kam gati ma gadi hakiraheko thiyo** (he was driving at a speed less than 160 kilometers per hour).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Newzealand praharile afno speed radar bandukko prayog garera shree redko gatilai black byutisanga tulana garna khojiraheko kramama samasya utpanna bhaeko thiyo ra praharile shree redlai awalokan garda unle afno gati 160 kimi prati ghantama ghataeka thee."" This translates to: ""New Zealand police, while trying to compare Shree Reid's speed with the Black Beauty using their speed radar gun, encountered a problem and, after observing Shree Reid, found that his speed had dropped to 160 km per hour.""

Therefore, the police were trying to check if his speed was *less than* 160 km/h, and the issue arose when they observed he was *at* 160 km/h. Options B, C, and D are not mentioned or relevant to the reason the police had trouble.
"
butteko tulanama bhukampa ko kendra kaha thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 miles dakshin**.

The passage states: ""Bhukampako kendravindu dylanko karib 20 kimi (15 mile) utter-uttarpurva ra byutko karib 65 kimi (40 mile) dakshinma thiyo."" This translates to ""The epicenter of the earthquake was about 20 miles north-northwest and about 65 miles south.""  Therefore, the epicenter was 65 miles south."
abu ghribeko dangama ke bhayo?,"The correct answer is **A: kaidi durwyawahar (prisoner abuse)**.

The question asks what happened in Abu Ghraib prison. The provided text states that the US military personnel committed prisoner abuse there.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: lockdown** - While a lockdown *could* be a consequence, the text doesn't mention a lockdown happening.
*   **C: americi senaley niyantran liye (American military took control)** - The text mentions the US military being involved in the abuse, but doesn't say they took control of the prison.
*   **D: karagarlai ago lagaiyo (the prison was burned)** - The text doesn't mention the prison being burned.



"
iraqi karagar kina badanam bhayo? ,"The correct answer is **B: americi senaley niyantran liyo**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* the Iraq prison became notorious.** The first sentence of the prompt states the prison became notorious *during* the time the Abu Ghraib prison was operating.
* **The prompt then states:** ""Americi senale kabza garepachhi tyahan kaidi durwyawahar patta lagepachhi jailko badanami bhaeko thiyo.""  (After the American soldiers took control, prisoner abuse occurred, and the prison became infamous.) This directly links the American military's control to the prison's notoriety.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ago lagaeako thiyo (It was on fire):** The prompt doesn't mention the prison being on fire.
* **C: tyaha thuprai dangaharu bhayo (There were many conflicts there):** While there might have been conflicts, the prompt explicitly states the notoriety stemmed from prisoner abuse *after* American control.
* **D: kaidi durwyawahar patta lagepachhi (Prisoner abuse occurred):**  This is *a result* of the American control, not the *reason* for the prison's notoriety.  The prompt says the notoriety came *because* of the abuse that started under American control.



"
mauiko war memorial stadiumma kasto prakarko karyakram huney wala thiyo?,"The text states that 9,000 people were supposed to attend the event. It doesn't specify *what kind* of event it was, only that it was a program at Mauiko War Memorial Stadium. 

Therefore, none of the options (magic show, football match, concert, fundraising event) can be definitively confirmed from the given text.  However, the text indicates it was a significant event that was cancelled at the last minute.  Without more information, we *cannot* definitively choose an answer.

**However, if forced to choose the *most likely* option, a ""jalsa"" (concert/gathering) is a plausible event to draw a large crowd (9,000 people) and be cancelled due to unforeseen circumstances.** The other options, while possible, might be less likely to attract such a large audience, *especially* a last-minute cancellation.

Therefore, I'll cautiously choose **C: jalsa** as the *most likely* answer, while acknowledging the lack of definitive information.
"
karyakramko kharijibarey akhirkar kasley spashtikarn diyo?,"The correct answer is **A: band**.

The text states: ""Bandley mauwiko war memorial stadiumko karyakram radd garyo..."" which translates to ""Bandley cancelled the program at War Memorial Stadium..."" Therefore, Bandley (the organizer) clarified the cancellation.
"
bishkekka basindaharule lutpatko jimmewar ko thiyebhanera soche?,"The correct answer is **C: pradarshankariharu (demonstrators)**.

The text states: ""Bishkeka kayaun basindaharule dakshinbata aeka pradarshankariharule kanuna palana nagareko dosh diye."" This translates to ""Residents of Bishkek, from the south, blamed the demonstrators for not upholding the law.""

Therefore, the residents of Bishkek believed the demonstrators were responsible for the lawlessness and looting.
"
lutpatkolagi dakshinko pradarshankariharuko kasley ninda garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: bishkekka basindaharu** (residents of Bishkek).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bishkeka kayaun basindaharule dakshinbata aeka pradarshankariharule kanuna palana nagareko dosh diye.""  This translates to ""Residents of Bishkek, from the south, blamed some observers for not enforcing the law.""

Therefore, the residents of Bishkek criticized the observers for not upholding the law.
"
ringley kahiley bikri badheko anubhav garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: sark tankma dekha parye pachi** (after being seen on Shark Tank).

The text states: ""key sun 2013 maa sark tank episodema uhaanko upasthitipachhi bikri badheko cha..."" which translates to ""key sun, sales increased after his appearance in the Shark Tank episode in 2013...""

Therefore, option A is the accurate answer.
"
jamie siminoffley kahiey ring suruwat garney nirnay gare?,"The correct answer is **B: sark tankma upasthiti asafal bhaye pachhi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""key sun 2013 maa sark tank episodema uhaanko upasthitipachhi bikri badheko cha jahaan sho panelle startuplai wittiya poshan dina aswikar gareko thiyo."" This translates to: ""Key Sun in 2013 after appearing on Shark Tank, sales increased where 100 investors agreed to provide financial support to the startup.""

This indicates that the success (or even just the appearance) on Shark Tank, despite not securing investment, was a key factor in Jammy Siminoff's decision to start ringing. Options A, C, and D are not directly supported by the provided text.



"
harek reading rainbow episodeley bacchaharulai keko lagi sifaris garthe?,"The correct answer is **D: kitabharu (books)**.

The text states: ""Balbalikaharu pustakalayama jaanda tiniharule hernu parne kitabka lagi pratyek karyakramle pustakharuka lagi sifaris pani pradan garchha."" which translates to ""Children who go to the library, each program also provides a recommendation for a book for the books they can see.""
"
reading rainbow shrinkhalako kharijima ke ko haat huna sakcha?,"The correct answer is **C: john grantko vichaar (John Grant's view)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that Zone Grant, particularly John Grant's vision (described as ""renbo padhnale bachchaharulai kinn padhne bhane sikayo"" -  ""Rainbow taught children how to read by teaching them what to read""), was instrumental in the success of Reading Rainbow and contributed to the conclusion of a successful era for educational television programming.  The quote from WNED directly attributes the program's success and impact to Grant's approach.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: apug lagani (high cost):** While funding might be a concern for any program, the text doesn't focus on the cost as a major factor affecting the program's success or conclusion.
*   **B: emi puraskarko kami (lack of Emmy awards):** The text mentions an Emmy award, so this is incorrect.  The absence of awards isn't linked to the program's overall impact.
*   **D: mister roger’s neighborhoodko safalta (success of Mister Roger's Neighborhood):** While Mister Roger's is a famous program, the text specifically connects Reading Rainbow's success and conclusion to John Grant's vision and Zone Grant. It doesn't establish a direct link between the two programs' successes.



"
nimna madhey amsterdamka adhikariharu ra sangrahalayaley rukh sambandhi kun tarka garenan?,"The correct answer is **C: tyo dhusidwara pradushit chha** (it is polluted by mold).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Amsterdam sahar ra Annie Frank sangrahalayaka adhikariharule bataunchhan key dhusile rookh sankramit bhaeko cha ra janaswasthyama yati khatra garaunchha key tiniharule turk gareanusar yo dhalne khatra hoon lageko thiyo."" This translates to: ""Amsterdam city and the officials of the Anne Frank House say that the tree is infected with mold and poses such a danger to public health that, according to the Turks, this is a dangerous situation.""

* **Option C directly reflects this information.** The passage explicitly mentions mold (dhus) as the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: tyo antyama dhalerai chhadchha** (it is finally discarded):  The passage doesn't mention disposal. It focuses on the risk to health.
* **B: tyo jogaunu parcha** (it has to be removed): While the officials *considered* removal, the passage highlights the health risks posed by the mold itself, not just the need to remove the tree.
* **D: tyo sarwasadharanko swasthako lagi hanikarak chha** (it is harmful to public health): While true, this is a broader statement. The passage specifies that the harm comes from the *mold* infection.  Option C is more precise.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"rspcako pramukh nirikshak anusar, nimna madhey kunko lagi nirikshanharu manak hunuparcha?","The correct answer is **A: cctv cameraharu**.

The passage states that the RSPCA is urging the Australian government to install CCTV cameras in slaughterhouses for animal welfare monitoring. The quote from David O'Shanesie specifically mentions the necessity of CCTV cameras for monitoring and oversight. Therefore, CCTV cameras are the focus of the RSPCA's request.
"
"anuchhed anusar, australiali khasaikhanaka kamdaarharulai ke kura pashu kalyanko mahatwa bujhna maddat garna sakcha?","The correct answer is **A: cctv camerako sthapana (Installation of CCTV cameras)**.

The passage states that the RSPCA is urging the Australian government to install CCTV cameras in abattoirs to monitor and inspect how animals are treated.  The passage explicitly says that CCTV cameras will ""surely send a strong signal that animals' welfare is the highest priority."" Therefore, the installation of CCTV cameras is the action that will help abattoir workers understand the importance of animal welfare.
"
"anuchhed anusar, pakrau parney wyaktiko pesha ke thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: vidhyarthi (student)**.

The passage states: ""key march 21 co vidyalayama bhaeko golibari co aropma arko vidyarthi pakrau pareko khabar cha."" This translates to ""news that a student was caught for a shooting at a school on March 21st.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, jaba arko pakraubarey samachar failindai thiyo, katiota piditharuko lagi antyeshti gariraheko thiyo?","The answer is **B: teen**.

The text states: ""Jeff Veej ra naujana piditharumadhe..."" which translates to ""Jeff Veej and **nine** victims..."". Therefore, there were nine victims.
"
"aandolanko jawafma, kun deshley uniharuko dastakhat gariyeko acta samjhautasanga aghi badhena?","The correct answer is **B: poland**.

The passage states: ""Deshle acta maa hastakshar garnale gat mahina polandma thulo virodh pradarshan bhaeko thiyo jasle garda police sarkarle ahileka lagi samjhautalai anumodan nagarne nirnaya gareko thiyo."" This translates to ""In Poland, a large protest occurred last month after the signature of the treaty on the Digital Single Market, which led the police and government to decide not to approve the agreement for the time being.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun deshharuley actasanga samel huney prakriyamaa dhilai garye?","The correct answer is **D: latvia**.

"
ipod atyadhik tateka ghatnaley kati jana manisharu ghaitey bhaye?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""Lagbhag 60 vata cam nagareka ipod atyadhik tateka ghatanaharu report garieko thiyo, jasma jamma cha watabata agalagi bhaeko thiyo ra **char janalai samanya rupma poleko thiyo**.""  This translates to: ""Approximately 60 reports of overheating iPods had been filed, which were accumulating due to environmental heat and **generally affecting four people**.""
"
kasley atyadhik tateka ghatnaharu dherai gambhir hudaina bhanera bhaney?,"The correct answer is **D: apple**.

The text states: ""Apple co pratiwedan sthagit gardai mantralayale """"""sanchchai afasospurna"""""""" bhanyo."" This translates to ""The ministry was sincerely disappointed after Apple's representative stated that the incidents were """"""not serious."""""" Therefore, Apple is the one who claimed the incidents were not serious.
"
"usko bhasan dauran, steve jobsley appleley ke punah awishkar garneycha bhaneka thiye?","The correct answer is **A: itihas (history)**.

The passage states: ""...Applele phone punah awishkar garna gairaheko cha, hammy az itihas banauna gairaheka chhaun."" This translates to ""...Apple is unable to reinvent the phone, we are unable to make history.""

Therefore, Steve Jobs said they were aiming to **make history**.
"
steve jobko dui-ghanta lamo bhasanko udeshya ke thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: naya phone arambha garna (to launch a new phone)**.

The text explicitly states that Steve Jobs, during his 2-hour speech, said, ""Today Apple is not reinventing the phone, we are reinventing history."" This clearly indicates he was announcing a new iPhone and its significance.
"
agrentineko theatrema Cristina Fernandez Dee Kirchanarley ke ghoshana garin?,"The correct answer is **A: unko rashtrapati padako ummedwari (Her presidential candidacy)**.

The text states: ""Wartaman cineter tatha argentinaki pratham mahila Cristina Fernandez Dee Kirchanar ley bunes ires bata 50 kilometer (31 mile) tadha raheko sahar lah platama hijo sanjha afulai rashtrapati padako ummedwar ghoshana gareki chin."" This translates to: ""Current president and Argentina's first woman Cristina Fernandez De Kirchner announced her candidacy for the presidential post in La Plata, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.""

Therefore, the answer is that she announced her presidential candidacy.
"
Cristina Fernandez Dee Kirchanarley ummedwarko lagi uthney manasaya kaha ghosana garin?,"The correct answer is **B: la platako bunes ires theatre maa**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Wartaman cineter tatha argentinaki pratham mahila Cristina Fernandez Dee Kirchanar ley bunes iresbata 50 kilometer (31 mile) tadha raheko sahar lah platama hijo sanjha afulai rashtrapati padako ummedwar ghoshana gareki chin.""
* This translates to: ""Current cinema and Argentina's first woman Cristina Fernandez De Kirchner announced her candidacy for the presidential post in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.""
* Therefore, she announced her candidacy in La Plata, which is near Buenos Aires. Option B accurately reflects this.
"
big bradarko sambandhama acmako nishkarshaharu ke thiye?,"The correct answer is **A: censorship kanunharu ullanghan gariyeko thiena (censorship laws were not violated)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""big bradarle unline samagri censorship kanunko ullanghan gareka thienan"" which translates to ""Big Brother did not violate censorship laws regarding online content.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: big bradarko websitema media bhandaran gariyeko paiyo (Big Brother's website had media files)** - While the text mentions Big Brother's website, it doesn't say anything about media files being present.
* **C: censorship kanunharu ullanghan garieko paiyo (censorship laws were violated)** - This is the opposite of what the text states.
* **D: samagri euta serverma bhautik rupma basiraheko bhetiyo (the content was physically stored on a server)** - This is irrelevant to the issue of censorship; the text emphasizes that online content doesn't have physical form.



"
internet samagri bhanera maninako lagi meida kun mapdanda antargat parnuparcha?,"The correct answer is **B: yo bhautik rupma sarbharma rahanuparchha** (it exists physically).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""yadyapi internet samagri maninka lagi yo bhautik rupma kunai sarbharma rahanuparchha"" which translates to ""although internet content does not exist physically for the mind, it exists physically.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yo internetma stream hunuparchha** (it streams on the internet) - This is true, but doesn't answer the question of what *type* of media it is for the mind.
* **C: yo websitema bhandaran gariyeko hunuhunna** (it is not published on a website) - This is incorrect; the passage states it *is* published online (in the Big Brother website).
* **D: yo acmadwara swikrit hunuparchha** (it is approved by ACMA) - The passage discusses ACMA's censorship of online content, but doesn't say all internet content *must* be approved.

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the passage's statement about the physical existence of internet content for the mind."
australia liberal partyko neta ko hun?,"The correct answer is **A: Pitter Coastelo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pitter Coastelo, astreliaka koshadhyaksha ra sambhawatah pradhanmantri zone hoardko uttaradhikari hoon sakne liberal partyka netale astreliama raheko anawik shakti udyogka pachadi afno samarthan dieka chan."" which translates to ""Pitter Costello, who is the treasurer of Australia and possibly the deputy prime minister, has expressed support for the renewable energy industry in Australia as the leader of the Liberal Party.""
"
australiasanga pahiley nai anawik shakti udhyog kina chaina?,"The answer is **A: sarwasadharan ko samarthanko kami (Lack of general support)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""anawik urja utpadan arthik tawarle wyawaharik hunchha, australiale yasako upayog garnu parchha bhane. """"yo wyawasayik huncha bhane, hamisanga yo hunuparchha. arthat, anawik urjaka lagi kunai saidhantik apatti chhaina"""""" (Renewable energy production is economically viable, Australia needs to use it. ""If it's economical, we will be with it. That means there is no ideological objection to renewable energy"").

This implies that the *reason* for not using it before wasn't necessarily that it was dangerous, expensive, or controversial, but rather a lack of widespread support or prioritization.  The Prime Minister's statement focuses on economic viability and a lack of *ideological* objection, suggesting the hurdle was more about general acceptance and commitment.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: atti vivadaspad (too controversial):** The text explicitly states there's no ideological objection.
*   **C: atti khatarnak (too dangerous):** There's no mention of danger.
*   **D: atti mahango (too expensive):** While the text mentions it's economically viable *now*, it doesn't say that's why Australia hasn't used it before. It implies the economics have changed.



"

The text states: ""Polandka purushatarfako drishtiwihin skier maciej Krezel ra margdarshak Anna Ogarzynska ley super-zeema tehraun sthanma khel pura gare."" This translates to ""Polish blind skier Maciej Krezel and his coach Anna Ogarzynska completed the super-G in 13th place.""
"

This translates to: ""They included Anna Jochemsenko of Netherlands in the women's standing event, who finished in ninth place in super-G, and Katja Sarinen of **Finland**, who finished in tenth place in the same competition.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, blakebarey kun kathan satya hoina?","The correct answer is **D: unle afu bottleharu fyakieko dabi gare** (unle claimed to have thrown bottles at himself).

Here's why:

* The passage states that 30 people accused Blake of *drinking* from bottles thrown at him, not throwing them himself.  Option D claims he *threw* the bottles at himself, which contradicts the information given.
* Options A, B, and C are all explicitly stated as facts in the passage.



"
"anuchhedko adharma, nimna madhye blakelai ke bhayena?","The correct answer is **A: unlai nyayako bato bigarne doshi paaiyo** (he was found guilty of corrupting the course of justice).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Blake lai nyayako bato bigarne prayaska lagi pani doshi thaharaieko thiyo."" (Blake was also found guilty of attempting to corrupt the course of justice.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: unlai pakrau gariyo** (he was arrested) - The passage mentions he was arrested but doesn't say it happened *during* the events described, just that he was arrested and the case concluded on August 3rd.
* **C: unlai khambaley akraman gariyo** (he physically assaulted someone) - The passage states he *ordered* his people to use bottles to attack people, not that he personally assaulted anyone.
* **D: unlai jail pathaine sambhawana chha bhanera bhaniyo** (it was said that he might go to jail) - While the passage mentions he faces jail time, it doesn't say it was *said* to him. It's a consequence of his conviction.



"
sanyukta rashtrasanghle vishwawyapi ushnata kosh keko lagi prayog hudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: anna vividhikaran**

Here's why:

The text states the United Nations is working to address global warming. It mentions that the fund aims to help with:

*   **Paisabadhirodhi gharharu (Resilient houses):**  Improving housing to withstand climate impacts.
*   **Paniko ramro wyawasthapan (Better water management):** Improving water resource management.
*   **Anna vividhikarantarfa jaan sakchha (Food diversification):**  Supporting food diversification.

The text *doesn't* mention food diversification as a primary *purpose* of the UN's global warming fund. While it might be a *result* of better water management and resilient agriculture, it's not a direct goal the fund is established to achieve.

The other options are directly mentioned as areas the fund will help with.
"
"anuchhed anusar, sanyukta rashtrasangh ke bachauney asha rakheko cha?","The correct answer is **A: paisa, praidhi sajha garera (money and sharing technology)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yasaka sathai, vishwawyapi ushnatale prabhawa pareka deshharulai yasaka asarharusanga samana garna sahayog garna sanyukta rashtrasanghale yasasambandhi koshlai antim roop dine asha rakheko cha. **Paisa badhirodhi gharharu, paniko ramro wyawasthapan ra anna vividhikarantarfa jaan sakdachha.**""

This translates to: ""With this, the United Nations hopes to finalize a fund to help countries affected by global warming to equalize with its effects. **Money, resistant houses, and better water management and food diversification can go to**...""

Therefore, the United Nations hopes to provide money and share technology/resistant houses to help countries adapt to climate change.  Option A best reflects this.
"
nimna madhey kun albert muchangaley kehi kura ajhai sammat hunu parney awashyak cha bhanera ullekhit gareko chaina?,"Correct answer is **B: wyapar suru huna sakney miti**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while African countries haven't fully adopted the production rules and tariffs, they believe they have enough to start trading on July 1, 2020.  Albert Muchanga doesn't say that trade *won't* start on that date, he expresses confidence that it *can*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yedi benin afcTAsanga abadha huncha bhaney (If Benin adheres to AfCFTA):**  The passage doesn't discuss Benin's adherence to AfCFTA.
* **C: utpattika niyamharu (Production rules):** The passage explicitly mentions that countries haven't fully adopted these rules, but it doesn't say Muchanga believes they *should* be adopted before trade begins.
* **D: shulkadar riyayatharu (Tariffs):** Similar to production rules, the passage states these haven't been fully adopted, but doesn't imply Muchanga insists on their full adoption before trade starts.



"
"anuchhed anusar, wyapar kina julyma suru hunasakcha?","The correct answer is **D: utpatti niyamharu ra tariff ko chut ma sahamati bhaiskeko chha** (There is agreement on production regulations and tariff exemptions).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""hamile ahilesamma utpattika niyamharu ra shulkadar riyayatharu swikar gareka chhainaun tar hamisanga bhaeko ruparekha july 1, 2020 maa wyapar suru garna paryapta cha.""

This translates to: ""We haven't accepted all the production regulations and tariff exemptions, but the framework we have is sufficient to start trade on July 1, 2020.""

Therefore, the agreement on production regulations and tariff exemptions (even if not complete) is the reason trade can begin on July 1st. Options A, B, and C are not directly supported by the text.
"
"anuchhed anusar, atlanta journal-constitutionley shikshya adhikariharulai keko dosh lagaye?","Correct answer is **C: fela pareko antarik samasyaharuma karya nagareko**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Reportle dekhayo key pariksha ankaharu drut gatile badheka thee ra yasale vidyalayale antarik samasyaharu patta lagaeko tar khojharuma karya nagareko arop lagayo."" 
* This translates to: ""The report showed that some exam scores were rapidly increasing and that this indicated underlying problems in the schools, but they had not acted to address them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: journal-constitution report chhedchhad garieko** - While the passage mentions allegations of tampering with answer sheets, it doesn't state that the *journal-constitution* report itself was tampered with.
* **B: sahari shikshya sudharna asafal bhayeko** - The passage initially describes the school system as improving, so this is incorrect.
* **D: kam parikshya natijaharu report gariyeko** - The passage doesn't mention anything about underreporting exam results.



"
"anuchhedma dieko jankariko adharma, atlanta journal-Constitutionko reportma ke ullekhit chaina?","The correct answer is **D: sahari shikshako sudharna sujhavharu** (suggestions for urban teacher improvement).

Here's why:

* The paragraph focuses on the controversy surrounding Sun 2009's recognition and the subsequent report in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about inflated test scores.
* The paragraph explicitly mentions the following:
    * Sun's national superintendent award in 2009
    * Improvements in test scores after Sun's appointment
    * The Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report alleging test score manipulation
    * Allegations of teachers altering answer sheets
    * Allegations against 34 education officials in 2013

* **Teacher improvement suggestions** are not mentioned anywhere in the provided text. Options A, B, and C *are* directly mentioned in the text.

Therefore, D is the only option that is *not* supported by the information in the paragraph.
"
"anuchhed anusar, bum wisfot pachi ke jankari thaha vayo?","Correct answer is **B: kun samrachanaharu najik bum wisfot vaye** (which translates to ""which structures near the bomb blasts"").

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Governor generalko karyalayabahir bum wisfot bhayo. Dui ghantako farakma sarkari bhawanharuka najik teen bum wisfot bhayo."" This translates to ""A bomb exploded outside the Governor General's office. Within two hours, three bombs exploded near government buildings.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions that bombs exploded near government buildings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ghaiteyko antim sankhya** (the final number of injured): The passage states that the final number of injured is *unknown*.
*   **C: yedi thap bum wisfot garnu parcha bhanera** (if Tap should explode a bomb): This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: mritak haruko aupachaarik sankhya** (the official number of dead): The passage mentions that the official death toll was *unconfirmed* and a minimum of 30 people were injured. The final death toll is *unknown*.



"
"2017 ma manchester cityma samel bhayepachi, jesusley katiwata khel khele?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""Tyas beladekhi, brazilianle clubka lagi sabai pratiyogitaharuma **53 khel maa pradarshan gareko cha** ra 24 goal gareko cha.""  This translates to ""Since then, the Brazilian player has played in **53 matches** for the club and scored 24 goals.""
"
jesusley kun clubma samel vayeko bapat £27 million shulka prapta gare?,"The correct answer is **B: manchester city**.

The text states: ""Tyas beladekhi, brazilianle clubka lagi sabai pratiyogitaharuma 53 khel maa pradarshan gareko cha ra 24 goal gareko cha. **Tyas beladekhi, manchester cityma samel bhae.**"" 

This translates to: ""Since then, he has played in all competitions for the Brazilian club for 53 matches and scored 24 goals. **He joined Manchester City since then.**""
"
hostelka pahunaharubarey kun kathan satya hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: bahumat pahunaharu pavitra saharbata thiye (The majority of the guests were from the holy city.)**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Hostalka dherai pahuna sanyukta arab imirateska nagarik thee"" which translates to ""The hostel had many guests, mostly citizens of the United Arab Emirates.""

This directly contradicts option D, which says the majority of guests were *from* the holy city (presumably Mecca).  The text explicitly says they were *from* the UAE, not Mecca.

Let's look at why the other options are true:

* **A: pahunaharu tirthayatrakolagi meccama thiye (The guests were in Mecca for pilgrimage):** The text says pilgrims were visiting Mecca for the pre-sunset prayers before Hajj.
* **B: kehi pahunaharu sthaniya nagarik thiyenan (Some of the guests were local residents):** The text mentions many guests were from the UAE, implying there might have been some locals as well, although it doesn't explicitly state it.  It's a plausible scenario.
* **C: pahunaharu tyaha hajjko purva sandhyakolagi thiye (The guests were there for the pre-sunset prayers before Hajj):**  The text specifically states this.

Therefore, only option D is factually incorrect based on the given information."

"anuchhedko adharma,thakkarbarey kun jankari nischit chaina?","The correct answer is **C: thakkar ko prithvima asar** (The impact of the debris on the Earth).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tiniharu durghatana kathi thulo thiyo ra prithvi kasari prabhawit hunechha bhane nirdharan garna ajhai pani cosis gardaichhan."" (The accident was very big and scientists are still trying to determine how the Earth will be affected.)
* **The passage mentions:** The debris is being tracked by the UK and US defense departments, and analysis of the debris will be published. This information is confirmed.
* **The passage mentions:** The number of people infected with XDR-TB in South Africa and the number of infected people in the South African explosion.

Therefore, the impact of the debris on the Earth is the piece of information that is *not* definitively known, according to the passage.
"
"anuchhed anusar, thakkarbarey ajhai ke nishchit garna awashak cha?","The correct answer is **D: durghatanako sahi maan (the accurate extent of the accident)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Vaigyanikharu bhanchhan key ukta tuckkarle bhaeko wisfot thulo thiyo. Tiniharu durghatana kathi thulo thiyo ra prithvi kasari prabhawit hunechha bhane nirdharan garna ajhai pani cosis gardaichhan.""  This translates to: ""...Scientists say that the explosion was very big. They believe the accident was very big and are still trying to determine how the earth will be affected.""

The passage explicitly says scientists are *still trying to determine* the *extent* or *accurate scale* of the accident's impact. The other options are mentioned, but the primary unanswered question is the magnitude of the event itself.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: bhatkeka awasheshharu kasley track garcha (how the scattered remains are being tracked)** - The passage mentions the UK's defense department is tracking the remnants. It doesn't say this is an *unanswered* question.
* **B: thakkarko samayma upagrahaharu kati chhito yatra gariraheka thiye (how fast the satellites were traveling at the time of the impact)** - This information isn't mentioned as something scientists are still trying to determine.
* **C: plotting vishleshanko natija kasari sajha garincha (how the analysis results are being shared)** - The passage says the analysis results will be put on a public website, so this isn't an unanswered question.



"
"anuchhed anusar, battenley ekpatak sabaibhanda dhani amerikiharuko suchima kun sthan ogateko thiyo?","Correct Answer: C) 190 aun

Explanation:

The passage states: ""Batten sun 2008 ko sabaibhanda dhani amerikiharuko suchima 190 aun sthanma raheka thee..."" which translates to ""Batten was ranked 190th among the richest Americans in 2008..."" 

Therefore, the correct answer is **190 aun**.
"

The text states: ""Unle sun 1950 maa bharjinia wishwawidyalayako kala ra vigyan kalejbata snatak garera tyo sansthako mahatwapurna data thiye."" This translates to ""He graduated from the College of Art and Science of Virginia University in 1950 and was an important data of that institution.""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions Virginia University.
"

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the law applies *within* California (""californiaca governor arnold schwarzeneggerle hastakshar gare. Bilma california rajyama...""). 
* Options A, B, and D are all mentioned as parts of the law described in the text.

Therefore, only option C is incorrect because it refers to a sale happening *outside* of California, which is not part of the described law.
"
"anuchhed anusar, kasley vaniyeka chijharu chuttaye?","The correct answer is **B: mike**.

The passage states: ""Vivah garera dui wayaska bachchaharu bhaeka dubhalle millerma thulo chap chhodenan, jassanga katha sambandhit thiyo. Tippanika lagi agraha garda, Millerle bhane, """"sunuwaiko samayama mike dherai bolchhan... maha tayar bhairaheko thien tyasaile maha unle key bhaniraheka thee bhanera sanchchai nai suniraheko thein.""""""

This translates to: ""After getting married, two adult children made a lot of noise in the hall, which was related to the conversation. Insisting on a note, Miller said, """"They talk a lot in their own time... Because he was very busy, he wasn't really listening to what they were saying.""""

The passage focuses on the children making noise and Miller's inability to hear due to the noise from the **mike**. Therefore, the mike is the item that was ""chuttaye"" (distracting/preventing clear communication).



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna mandhey kun sunwaiko bela millerko anubhavbarey satya ho?","The correct answer is **B: uni tayar hunda unle khyal gariraheko thiyenan (When he was preparing, he was preoccupied.)**

Here's why:

* The passage states: """"maha tayar bhairaheko thien tyasaile maha unle key bhaniraheka thee bhanera sanchchai nai suniraheko thein.""""  This translates to: ""He was very busy preparing, so he wasn't really listening and didn't hear what the child was saying.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sunwaiko bela duvallley millermathi ramro prabhav pare (During the listening, the child had a good effect on Miller):** The passage doesn't mention any positive effect. In fact, Miller didn't hear what the child was saying.
* **C: sunwaiko bela duvallko duita bacchaharuley dherai boliraheka thiye (During the listening, the two children were talking a lot):** While it's implied the children were talking, the main point is that Miller wasn't *listening* because he was focused on his own preparations.
* **D: unle duvallko kathalai ramro sanga dhyan diraheka thiye (He was paying close attention to the child's story):** This is the opposite of what the passage states. He wasn't paying attention.



"
“swachcha hawasambadhi ein” lai samsodhan garnuparcha vanera kasley sujhav garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: conservative party**.

The text states: ""Leton (Layton) ley conservative partyko watawarniya widheyakko """"wistrit ra purna punarlekhan"""" ca lagi agraha gardai pradhanmantrisangko bhetma conservativeko watawarniya vidheyakma parivartan garna agraha gareka thee."" This translates to ""Leton (Layton) demanded a ""broad and complete rewrite"" of the conservative party's environmental policy during his meeting with the Prime Minister.""

Therefore, the conservative party is the entity that suggested revising the ""swachcha hawasambandhi ein.""
"
“swachcha hawasambadhi ein” chunabh purwi tamasha ho vanera kasley khandan garyo?,"The provided text doesn't explicitly state that anyone called the ""swachcha hawasambandhi ein"" an election stunt. However, it mentions Jack Letonsanga, the NDP leader, demanding ""wistrit ra purna punarlekhan"" (extensive and complete rewrite) regarding environmental policies. This implies dissatisfaction with the current policies.

Therefore, the most likely answer, though not directly stated, is **C: euta ndp neta (an NDP leader)**.  The context suggests Letonsanga was critical of the policies and likely voiced concerns that they were insufficient or insincere.

It's important to note that the text doesn't *directly* say anyone called it a stunt, but Letonsanga's actions and demands suggest a critical viewpoint that could be interpreted that way.

The passage states: ""Anweshakharule melamine ra sainurik acidko thap prayog garera biraloko mutrama bhaeka crystalharuko awalokan gare."" This translates to ""The researchers used a mixture of melamine and cyanuric acid and observed crystals formed in the urine of infected animals.""  Therefore, the reaction produces crystals.
"

Here's why:

* The passage states that the researchers used infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) to *compare* the crystals found in the urine of infected animals with the crystals formed during the reaction of melamine and cyanuric acid.
* Therefore, the FTIR analysis was focused on understanding the **composition** of those crystals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mirgaulako karya (Kidney function):** While kidney function is relevant to urine, the question asks what FTIR was used *to observe*.
* **C: prabhawit bhayeka gharpaluwa janawarharu (Affected animals):** The researchers aren't directly observing the animals themselves using FTIR. They're analyzing a sample (urine) from them.
* **D: gharpaluwa janawarko dushit khaneykura (The polluted food of the animals):** The FTIR analysis isn't directly examining the food. It's examining the *result* of the food being ingested (crystals in urine).



"
lunalai kasley “atyadhiktako rani” bhanera sambodhit garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Tomy Dreamerle bhane """"""Luna atyadhiktako pahili rani hunuhunthyo. merry pahili prabandhak.""""""  Then, Dustin Runnels commented on Luna. Therefore, Dustin Runnels referred to Luna as the ""atyadhiktako rani"" (first queen of the majority).
"
kasley lunalai “vichitra” bhanera sambodhit garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dustin """"""""Goldst"""""""" Runnelsle tippani gare key """"""""Luna majattikai vichitra thein...hunasakchha tyasabhanda pani badhi..."".  This translates to ""Dustin Runnels commented that Luna was very strange... perhaps even more than that... I love her and will remember her... I hope she is in a good place today.""

Therefore, Dustin Runnels used the word ""vichitra"" (strange) to describe Luna.
"
durghatnama samlagna bhaeko chalaklai ke bhayena?,"The correct answer is **A: usko taukoma chotpatak lagyo** (He suffered an injury to his abdomen).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Yadyapi, chalakko taukoma gambhir chot lageko thiyo."" (However, the driver had a serious injury to his abdomen.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: usley gharma bhayeka kunai pani wyaktiharulai chotpatak purayena** (He didn't injure anyone in the house.) - The passage states there were three people in the house who were unharmed. This is true, but it doesn't describe what happened to the driver.
* **C: uslai cambridgeko aspatalbata great yarmouthma sario** (He was transferred from Cambridge hospital to Great Yarmouth.) - While he *was* transferred, the passage focuses on the initial injury.
* **D: apatkalin sewaharule uslai usko gadibata nikalna maddat garye** (Emergency services helped him out of his car.) -  The passage mentions the driver was taken out of the car by emergency services, but it doesn't detail this specific action.

Therefore, option A is the only one directly supported by the text.
"
rugby pratiyogitako dauran south africako khelbarey kun kura le dhyan akarshit garena?,"Correct answer is **B: ball samhalne kaushal (ball handling skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Uniharuko anushasita raksha paddhati, **ball samhalne kaushal** ra utkrishta tolly karyale uniharulai alag dekhayo ra yo spashta bhayo key haraunuparne tolly yo nai ho.""  (Their disciplined defensive methods, **ball handling skills** and excellent tackling ability stood them apart and it became clear that tackling is the key.)

While the other options are mentioned, the passage specifically highlights ball handling skills as a key aspect of South Africa's performance that caught attention.
"
"anuchhed anusar, south africako khel kahiley dekhi sudhrina thalyo?","Correct answer is **D: jaba pratiyogita aghi badhdai gayo** (When the competition progressed).

The paragraph states: ""Dakshin africale pratispardhako pragatianusar lagatar sudhar garyo"" which translates to ""South Africa continuously improved according to the progress of the competition."" This directly indicates that their improvement started as the competition advanced.
"

"anuchhed anusar, kahiley chinko gdpley sanyukta rajya americalai ucchincha?","The correct answer is **B: dui dashak bhitra** (Within two decades).

The passage states: ""Dui dashak bhitrama sanyukta rajya americako bhanda chinko gdp mathi jaan sakne cha."" which translates to ""Within two decades, China's GDP could surpass that of the United States.""
"
huley vikasonmukh deshharulai ke garna sujhav diye?,"Correct answer is **A: tyasto dayitwa linu jasley uniharuko vikas charanlai dhakalcha** (to take responsibilities that don't hinder their development).

Here's why:

The text states Hule believes developing countries should be encouraged to follow a ""pollute and then clean up"" path. However, he also argues that it's unfair to ask them to take on responsibilities beyond their development stage, capabilities, and duties. Therefore, his suggestion is for them to take on responsibilities that *don't impede their development*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: arthik parinamma dhyan kendrit garnu** (focus on economic consequences): While economic growth is mentioned, it's not the primary suggestion.  The focus is on the pace of development.
* **C: halko jimmewariharu bhanda aghi janu** (to advance beyond lighter responsibilities): This is the opposite of what Hule is saying. He's cautioning against prematurely taking on heavier responsibilities.
* **D: pradusanko purano margabata joginu** (to stick to the old path of pollution): Hule is criticizing this path, not suggesting it.



"
hule ke ullekh garenan?,"The correct answer is **A: katauti ko adhar (the basis for reduction)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tiniharu chinko arthik utpadanma adharit rahera banaine chan bhandai unle katautika lagi aankada nirdharan gareka chhainan."" This translates to: ""They say they will be based on Chinese economic development, but they haven't determined the data for reduction.""

Therefore, Hule mentioned the *lack of a basis/data for reduction*. The other options are not directly mentioned:

*   **B: vikasonmukh deshharulai pradusan sambandhi sallaha (advice regarding pollution to developing countries):** While Hule does talk about advising developing countries, the question specifically asks what he *mentioned*.
*   **C: euta miti jun belasamma carbon utsarjan katine asha (an expected date for carbon emissions to be reduced):** The text doesn't mention any specific date or expectation.
*   **D: carbon utsarjan katauti ko matra (the amount of carbon emission reduction):**  Hule doesn't specify a particular amount of reduction.

"
nimna madhey kunko lagi Bhermanle paristhiti ramro chaina bhane?,"The correct answer is **B: angola**.

The text states: """"angola ahile sabaibhanda kharab prakopma gairaheko cha ra angolako awastha dherai nai kharab cha"""" which translates to ""Angola is currently in the worst epidemic and the situation in Angola is very bad.""  Richard Bherman specifically comments on the dire situation in Angola.
"
"muddako karan, kasley huhneko mantrimandal ko pad linecha?","The correct answer is **A: davey**.

The text states: ""Huhanele rajinama gareka chan ra unlai mantrimandalma aid devi MP ley pratisthapan garnuhunecha."" This translates to ""Huhane has resigned and Aid Devi MP will establish him in the cabinet.""  Therefore, Davey will be appointed to the cabinet.
"
muddako khulasasangai wyapar mantriko bhumika kasley dharana garnechha?,"The correct answer is **A: lamb**.

The text states: ""debhile khali gareka wyapar mantriko pada norman lamb mpley line apeksha garieko cha."" This translates to ""Norman Lamb, who has been dismissed from the post of Trade Minister, is expected to be appointed.""

Therefore, Lamb is expected to take on the role of Trade Minister as part of the resolution of the issue.
"
camille saint-Saensko opera dauran kalakarharuley shrotalai ke garna protsahit garchan?,"The correct answer is **C: uniharusanga pradarshankolagi manchma auna (come to the stage to perform with them)**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""Natijako rupma, kalakarharule stagema ganja seven garchhan ra natakghar aafainle shrotaharulai samel hoon protsahit gariraheko hunchha."" This translates to: ""As a result, the artists take the stage and continuously encourage the audience to join them.""  Option C accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ganjako prayog garna (to use ganja):** The text mentions ""japanko premle nirdharan garchha"" (determines through Japanese love), not ganja.
*   **B: japan yatra garna (to travel to Japan):** The text mentions Japanese love, but not traveling to Japan.
*   **D: uniharuko jeevan uniharuley maya garney chijley nirdharan garna anumati dinchan (allow them to determine their life through what they love):** While the opera might explore themes of love, the primary action described is encouraging the audience to participate on stage.



"
operako dauraan kasley ganjaharu seven garchhan?,"The correct answer is **C: kalakarharu (artists)**.

The question asks who the artists (kalakarharu) perform for during the opera. The text states: ""Natijako rupma, kalakarharule stagema ganja seven garchhan ra natakghar aafainle shrotaharulai samel hoon protsahit gariraheko hunchha."" This translates to: ""As a result, the artists perform on stage and constantly encourage the audience to engage with themselves.""

Therefore, the artists are the ones performing.
"
leonovley pradarsan gareko “spacewak” ko arko nam ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: atiriktawahan gatiwidhi (EVA)**.

The text explicitly states: ""March 18, 1965 maa, unle pahilo manav atiriktawahan gatiwidhi (EVA) wa """"spacewak"""" pradarshan garera..."" This translates to ""On March 18, 1965, he demonstrated the first manned extravehicular activity (EVA) and ""spacewalk""..."".
"
leonovley sobhiyat sanghako abhiyanko kun bhagko netritwa gareko thiye?,"The correct answer is **B: apollo-soyuz**.

The text states: ""Dash barshapachhi, unle epolo-soyuz abhiyanko sobhiyat bhagko netritwa gare jasle antariksha daud samapta bhaeko sanket garyo."" This translates to ""Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which signaled the end of the space race.""
"
durghatnama ko ghaitey bhayeka thiye?,"The correct answer is **D: ek truck chalak (a truck driver)**.

The text states: ""64 warshe truck chalak durghatanama ghaite bhaenan."" which translates to ""A 64-year-old truck driver died in the accident.""
"
durghatanama samlagna manisharulai ke bhayo?,"The correct answer is **C: uniharu karai ra roiraheka thiye** (They were scared and crying).

Here's why:

The text states: """"""tyahan bachchaharu sadak paar garna parkhiraheka thee ra tiniharu sabai jana karairaheka ra roiraheka thee."""""" This translates to: ""There, the children were looking to cross the road and all of them were scared and crying.""

Options A and B are incorrect because they refer to the truck driver's death, not the people near the accident. Option D is nonsensical in this context.
"
nimna madhey kunwapat bhayeka asarharu awalokan garna karyakramma kaam gariraheka waigyanikharuley asha gariraheka chan?,"The correct answer is **B: jwalanta shaktiharu (fluctuations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Akashgangako dark matter ra milky wayko dark matterka bichma **jwalanta shaktile nimtyaeko prabhawa tolile khojiraheko thiyo**."" This translates to ""Scientists were trying to measure the effect of **fluctuations** between the dark matter of the Milky Way and the dark matter of the universe.""

The passage highlights that the experiment aims to measure the impact of these fluctuations. While the other options are related to dark matter, the experiment specifically focuses on the *fluctuations* within the dark matter.



Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: samanya padartha (ordinary matter):** The passage doesn't mention a focus on ordinary matter.
*   **C: sano kanaharu (small particles):** While the passage mentions that the dark matter in the cosmic web might be made of many small particles, the experiment's primary goal isn't to study these particles themselves.
*   **D: dark matter:** The passage discusses dark matter, but it's the *fluctuations* within dark matter that are the key focus of the experiment.



"
nimna madhey kun padhartha vaigyanikharuley awlokan gariraheka chan?,"The correct answer is **D: dhanu akashganga ra milky way akashganga**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Akashgangako dark matter ra milky wayka bichma jwalanta shaktile nimtyaeko prabhawa tolile khojiraheko thiyo."" (The effect of the fiery power between the dark matter of the Milky Way and the धनु आकाशगंगा (Dhanu Akashganga - Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy) is being measured.)
* The text also mentions ""Milky Way"" (milky way) and ""Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy"" (dhanu akashganga) as objects related to the study.
* The moon (chandrama) and Earth (prithvi) are mentioned in the context of tides, but not as the primary objects of study related to the dark matter interaction.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate."
"annuchedko adharma, kattarpanthiharule kun kurako alochana gardainan?","The correct answer is **C: punarnirmanko thekkaharu kaslai pradan garindai cha (How are the reconstruction efforts provided?)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that financial conservatives labeled the situation ""busko naya orleans dill"" (meaning a mess) and criticized the reconstruction efforts being provided *by* liberals within Washington.  The question asks what the conservatives *didn't* criticize.

Let's break down the options:

*   **A: rahat kharcha (Relief expenses)** - The paragraph mentions a dispute about relief expenses.
*   **B: punarnirmanma prayatnako kami (Lack of effort in reconstruction)** -  While not explicitly stated as a *criticism* by conservatives, the label ""busko naya orleans dill"" implies a lack of effective effort.  So, it's a likely point of contention.
*   **C: punarnirmanko thekkaharu kaslai pradan garindai cha (How are the reconstruction efforts provided?)** - The paragraph directly states that the liberal approach to reconstruction, specifically *how* the reconstruction efforts are provided, is the focus of the conservative criticism.
*   **D: punarnirmanko kharcha (Reconstruction expenses)** - The paragraph mentions a dispute about the reconstruction expenses.

Therefore, the conservatives' primary criticism, as highlighted in the passage, is *how* the reconstruction efforts are being managed, which is option C. They are critiquing the liberal approach to providing the reconstruction.
"
aandhibehari katrinako rahat prayatnaharukolagi punarnirman thekkaharuko alochanha kasley gariraheko cha?,"The correct answer is **B: liberals**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Punah rnirman prayasko liberal alochana kathit washington bhitrakalai punah rnirman theka pradan garekoma kendrit raheko cha."" This translates to: ""The reconstruction efforts are criticized by liberal analysis, focusing on reconstruction within Washington.""

Therefore, liberals are the ones offering the criticism of the reconstruction efforts. The text also mentions ""wittiya kattarpanthiharu"" (financial conservatives) giving a humorous label, but the main criticism of the reconstruction efforts is attributed to liberals.
"
"anuchhed anusar, kahabata stardust antariksha yanka battiharu pahiley dekhincha?","The correct answer is **B: uttari california**.

The passage states: """"yo nardharnauttari california paschimi tatama sarchha ra californiabata madhya oregon hundai nebhada ra idaho hundai yutako akashma ujyalo parnecha"""" which translates to """"This is located in northwestern California and the bright light will be seen from California to central Oregon, Nevada and Idaho."""" Therefore, the bright lights from the Stardust capsule will be visible from **Northern California**.
"
"anuchhed anusar, antariksha yanley nimna madhey keko kirtiman kayam gardacha?","The correct answer is **C: prithvima sabaibhanda chhito farkine (returns to Earth faster than ever before)**.

The passage states: ""Stardust prithvima farkanka lagi sabaibhanda chhito antariksha yanka lagi naya sarva-samay kirtiman sthapit garnechha, mema 1969 maa Apollo X command moduleko firtako kramama aghillo record todyo."" This translates to: ""Stardust will set a new all-time record for the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth, breaking the previous record of the Apollo X command module in 1969.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: akashko sabaibhanda farakilo dayara ujyalo parne (shines brighter than ever before in the sky):** While the capsule will be visible, the primary achievement isn't about brightness.
* **B: sabaibhanda dherai saharma dekhine (looks more spectacular than ever before):** Spectacle is subjective and not the main point.
* **D: sabaibhanda chhito san francisco dekhi los angeles samma yatra garne (travels faster than ever before from San Francisco to Los Angeles):** This is just a speed of travel, not a record-breaking achievement in space travel.



"
dr. Maller Balasubramaniamko Saroja Balasubramaniansaga ke sambandha thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: aama (mother)**.

The text states: ""Unle adhikariharulai 500 fitko durima raheko afno callo rangkooldsmobile intrigue kartarf nirdeshit garin. Tyahan, tiniharule 53 warshe Saroja Balasubramanian co shab ragatko dag lageko kamballe dhakieko bhettae."" This translates to: ""She directed the officer to her calla-colored mobile phone 500 feet away. There, they met Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 years old, who was lying covered in a bloodied blanket."" The context implies that Saroja Balasubramanian is the mother of Dr. Maller Balasubramaniam, as the question is about the relationship between the doctor and Saroja Balasubramanian. The article also later mentions that Dr. Maller Balasubramaniam, 29, blue aish, ohayoma bhetie, june sinasinatiko lagbhag 15 mile uttarko upanagarko sadak chheuko jaminma tea-cert ra kattuma atyadhik aushadhi seven gareko awasthama ladiraheko bhettieko thiyo, implying a familial connection.
"
Sara Balasubramanianko shab kaha fela pareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: carko dibbima (in the car's trunk)**.

The text states: ""unaki ama afno karko dibbama mrit awasthama fella pareki hunale..."" which translates to ""his mother was found dead in her car's trunk...""
"
ee-bele ke prapta garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: skype**.

The text mentions ""skypeko baliyo prabhawa pareka kshetraharuma lokpriyata hasil gurney asha rakheko cha"" which translates to ""hopes to gain popularity in the fields where Skype has a small influence.""

Therefore, the question ""ee-bele ke prapta garyo?"" (what did it achieve?) refers to Skype.
"
yo adhigrahanbata ee-bele ke khojiraheko cha?,"The correct answer is **B: naya kshetraharuma failanu (to expand into new markets)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Companyle afna nafaka srotharuma vividhata lyaune ra china, purvi europe ra brazil jasta skypeko baliyo prabhawa pareka kshetraharuma lokpriyata hasil gurney asha rakheko cha.""  This translates to: ""The company is bringing diversity to its own resources and hopes to gain popularity in markets with a significant impact like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil, just like Skype.""

This clearly indicates the company's goal is to expand into new markets.  The other options are not directly mentioned as goals derived from the broader expansion:

* **A: yesko rajaswa jamma garnu (to generate revenue from it):** While expansion *will* likely generate revenue, it's not the primary stated goal.
* **C: yesko profile badhaunu (to increase its profile):**  Increased profile is a *result* of expansion, not the primary reason *for* the expansion.
* **D: yesko sharehsajhedarharulai santusta parna (to satisfy its shareholders):** While shareholder satisfaction is a business goal, the passage doesn't explicitly link the expansion to satisfying shareholders.  The focus is on market expansion.



"
"anuchhed anusar, yuddha-pachi parisarma rahane bandiharusita kasle kurakani garena?","The correct answer is **A: Madhyastakartaharu (Mediators)**.

The passage states: ""Madhyastakartaharule awasthalai sudhar garna khoje..."" which translates to ""Mediators tried to improve the living conditions...""  This indicates they were involved in efforts to improve the prison environment for the remaining prisoners after the war. The other options are not mentioned as being involved in this effort.
"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Agalagi bachao dalle antatah rati 11:35 budge ago niyantranma liye. **bandiharulai ashru gasle ghera hale**."" This translates to ""The rescue team took control by 11:35 PM by **surrounding the jail with tear gas**.""

Therefore, tear gas was the method used to subdue the prisoners after they started a fire. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"ayatola ally khamaneiko vicharmaa, iran deshley afulai kebata mukta garaunu pardacha?","The correct answer is **B: islamic kranti**.

This translates to: ""The country's highest leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, described the oil industry as a """"""trap"""""""" started before the Iranian Islamic Revolution in 1979 and said the country had to become independent from it.""

Therefore, Ayatollah Khamenei believes Iran needs to become independent *from* the Islamic Revolution in relation to its oil industry.
"
"anuchhed anusar, kasley iranko arthatantrama pratibandhako asarharu swikar garyo?","The correct answer is **A: warishtha sutraharu (senior officials)**.

This translates to: ""They (senior officials) face financial sanctions and restrictions from the European Union, due to which the Iranian regime receives 80% of its foreign income."" The passage then goes on to mention Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's comments, but the initial impact of the sanctions is directly attributed to the actions and consequences faced by the Iranian regime's senior officials.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: OPEC:** OPEC is mentioned as a factor in the decline of oil exports, but not as the entity directly *accepting* the impact of sanctions.
* **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei:** He *described* the oil industry as a ""trap,"" but the sanctions' impact was felt by the regime and its officials.
* **D: European Union:** The EU *imposed* the sanctions, not accepted their impact within Iran.

The passage states: ""Adhikariharule matadata parichaya pramanit garepachhi matadatale khamlai matapatra bakasma khasalchha ra matadanko suchima hastakshar garchha.""

"
allenlai musasiko aath-barsha khoj suru garna kun kurale prerit garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: unko dhan (his wealth)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...alenle kathit rupma afno dheraijaso dhan samudri anweshanma lagani gare ra yudhama jiwanparyantako ichchhapachi musasi fella parney afno khoj suru gare.""  This translates to: ""...Allen, in a determined manner, invested his great wealth in marine research and began his quest to find the treasure he desired throughout his life in the war.""

While the passage mentions his investment in marine research and his desire for treasure related to war, it explicitly links the *source* of his eight-year search to his wealth (""afno dheraijaso dhan"").  The other options are not directly supported as the *driving force* for the eight-year search.
"
"anuchhed anusar, allenley unko dheraijaso dhan kema kharcha garyo?","The correct answer is **B: samudri anweshan (ocean exploration)**.

The paragraph states: ""alenle kathit rupma afno dheraijaso dhan samudri anweshanma lagani gare"" which translates to ""Allen invested his vast wealth in ocean exploration.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kura plantbhitra ra warpar khatarapurna awasthako karan thiyo?","Correct Answer: **A: uranium indhan**

**Explanation:**

The paragraph states that local authorities suspect the following caused the dangerous situation:

*   ""Adhikariharu anuman lagaunchhan key yasale kshetrama uranium indhan bokeka containerharu futeka hoon sakchhan ra chuhiraheka cha bhane sanket gardacha."" (Authorities suspect that this may be a sign that uranium fuel containers in the area have exploded and are leaking.)

While the paragraph mentions radioactive caesium and iodine, it explicitly links the potential cause of the danger to the **uranium fuel containers**. Therefore, uranium fuel is the most direct cause of the dangerous situation according to the text.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: radiodharmi caesium:** Caesium is mentioned as being found in the plants, but it's presented as a symptom or indicator of a larger problem (the potential uranium leak), not the direct cause.
*   **C: seto dhuwa:** The red smoke is a visible effect, not the root cause of the danger.
*   **D: iodine:** Similar to caesium, iodine is found in the plants but is an indicator related to the potential uranium leak, not the primary cause."
plantko ghatana pachi nimna madhey kun kura sthaniya basindaharulai sujhav gariyeko suraksha sallahaharu hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: watanukulan ekai prayog nagarna (Do not use electricity)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Local authorities are warning residents to stay indoors, **not to use electricity**, and to not use water. This is because of potential radiation contamination.
* **Options B, C, and D** are all directly mentioned as safety precautions: staying indoors, avoiding the dust, and not using water.

Therefore, the statement that is *not* a suggested safety precaution is ""Do not use electricity.""

(In an interview, he said the new strain was ""highly deadly, highly concerning, and alarming""). This directly points to the high mortality rate as the most concerning aspect according to Dr. Moll.

While the other options are related, the passage emphasizes the high mortality rate as the most alarming point.
"
naya sanskaran bata sankramit bhaeka biramiharu madhey kati jana swasthyakarmi bhayeka pusti vayo?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""Ek warshama sankramit wyaktile 10 dekhi 15 najikaka samparkaharulai sankramit garna sakcha. Mole sochdachhan ra kamtima duijana aspatalka swasthyakarmi thee.""

This translates to: ""In a year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts. They are also thinking and at least two hospital staff members were infected.""

Therefore, at least two hospital staff members were infected.
"
nextgen pranalile kasto prakarko prawidhi prayog garcha?,"The correct answer is **A: upgrahama-adharit prawidhi (satellite-based technology)**.

The passage states: ""purano bhumi-radar-adharit praidhiko viparit bhuupgraha-adharit praidhiko prayog garchha"" which translates to ""instead of old land-radar based technology, it uses satellite-based technology.""

Therefore, NextGen uses satellite-based technology.
"
nextgenley kasari vayu traffic niyantrakharulai sidhai faida gardacha?,"The correct answer is **B: thap hawaiviman sthanharu (airport)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""NextGen lei wayudanlai badhi thik banauna vayu traffic niyantrakharulai anumati dina ra pilotharulai thap sahi jankari dina..."" (NextGen allows air traffic controllers to improve air traffic and gives pilots accurate information...).  This directly relates to improving operations *at* airports.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: vimanharu ko chhoto udan marga (shorter flight routes):** While NextGen *helps* with shorter routes, it's not the *direct* benefit to air traffic controllers. It's a consequence of the system.
*   **C: carbon utsarjanma katauti (reduction in carbon emissions):**  Carbon emission reduction is a *result* of NextGen's efficiency, not the direct benefit to air traffic controllers.
*   **D: kam indhan (less fuel):** Similar to carbon emissions, reduced fuel consumption is a *result* of the system's improvements, but not the direct benefit to air traffic controllers.



"
"anuchhedko anusar, itihaskarharule fbilai ke ma kendrit bhaeko karan alochana gareka chainan?","Correct answer is **B: sajilaisanga samadhan hune aparadhharuma srotharu kendrit garnu**

Here's why:

* The passage states that historians criticized the FBI for focusing on ""easy to solve crimes"" (sajilo mamilama vishesh gari chori bhaeka car muddaharuma srotharu kendrit rahekale).
* The reason for this criticism was the fear of not being able to demonstrate success (""agencyko safalta darlai badhaunu dine abhiprayale""). 

Therefore, historians criticized the FBI for prioritizing cases that were easy to solve in order to appear successful, rather than focusing on more complex cases.
"
fbi lai ashlilata pahal le ke garna badhya garcha?,"The correct answer is **D: ashillataka muddaharuma agentharu samarpit garcha (agents are dedicated to obscenity investigations).**

Here's why:

* The text states that Congress started providing financial support to the FBI in 2005 and mandated that the FBI allow agents to be assigned to obscenity investigations.  This means the FBI would dedicate agents to this type of crime.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: car choriko muddaharuma thap srot kendrit garcha (focuses on sources in car theft investigations):** The text says the focus is on car theft *murders*, not just car theft in general.
* **B: karyalayako safaltako dar badhaucha (fears the failure of the agency):** While agency success might be a concern, the text doesn't directly state this as the reason for the change in policy.
* **C: sajilaisanga samadhan nahune apradhharuma kendrit garcha (focuses on crimes where solutions are not easy):**  The text doesn't explicitly say this; it focuses on *obscenity* investigations specifically.



"
jas 39c gripen durghatnako pratikriya garne agni niyantrak sawarilai ke bhayo? ,"The correct answer is **B: tyo paltiyo** (it crashed).

The text states: ""Sthaniya mediale pratikriyako kramama wimansthalko agni niyantrak sawari paltieko suchana diyo."" This translates to ""In the local media's sequence of reactions, a report was given that the airport's fire controller crashed.""

Therefore, option B accurately reflects what happened to the fire controller.
"
"jas 39c gripen durghatna bhayepachi, wimansthal keko lagi banda gariyo?","The correct answer is **A: wyawasayik udanharu** (commercial flights).

The passage states: ""jasle garda wimansthalle wyawasayik udanharu band gareko thiyo."" which translates to ""because of this, commercial flights at the airport were stopped.""
"
iranko krantiko samayma brajejinskile kaslai margadarshanko prastaw gare?,"The correct answer is **A: kissinger**.

The text explicitly states that Henry Kissinger, as NSA, assisted President Carter in diplomatically handling the Iranian Revolution in 1979.
"
1977 samma rashtriya suraksha sallaharko pad kasley samhalyo?,"The correct answer is **B: kissinger**.

The passage states: ""heinry kisingarpachi 1977 dekhi 1981 samma rashtriya suraksha sallahakar (NSA) ko rupma sewa gare."" This translates to ""Henry Kissinger served as the National Security Advisor (NSA) from 1977 to 1981.""
"
nimna madhey kunle partijan belgradesangako karyakalko sahi tarikale varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **A: unle afno toliko lagi 468 goalharu gare** (He only scored 468 goals for himself).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Partizan Belgrade scored 403 goals *during his time* with the club. The statement ""unle afno toliko lagi 468 goalharu gare"" implies he scored 468 goals *total* throughout his career, which is inaccurate according to the provided information.  The text emphasizes his record *with Partizan*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: unle anya kheladi bhanda dherai goal gare** (He scored more goals than other players) - This is directly supported by the text: ""Bobekko tulanama aru kasaile kahilyai clubka lagi adhik upasthiti wa adhik goal gare.""
* **C: unlai ekpatak toliko itihasko sarwautkrishta kheladi chuniyo** (He was once unanimously chosen as the best player in history) - This is directly supported by the text: ""Sun 1995 maa unlai partizanko itihasma sarwashreshtha kheladiko rupma matadan gariyo.""
* **D: uni anya kheladi bhanda dherai khelharuma dekha pare** (He appeared in more matches than other players) - This is directly supported by the text: ""unle 468 upasthitima 403 goal lagae."" (He played in 468 matches and scored 403 goals).

Therefore, option A is the only one that misrepresents the information in the passage.
"
partijan belgradesangako bobekko itihasbarey kun kathan satya ho?,"Correct Answer: **A: unle partijanko lagi 1945 dekhi khelna suru gare**

Here's why:

* **The provided text explicitly states:** ""Uhaan sun 1945 maa samel hunubhayo ra uhaan sun 1958 samma basnubhayo."" (He joined in 1945 and stayed until 1958.) This confirms he started playing for Partizan Belgrade in 1945.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: partijan belgradema khelna aghi uni jagrebko lagi khelthe:** The text states he was born in Zagreb and played for Dinamo Zagreb before joining Partizan. This option contradicts the information given.
* **C: unle partijanko lagi 1995samma khele:** The text mentions he played until 1958, not 1995.
* **D: partijanko sarwashreshtha kheladi chuniyepachi unle prasiddhi kamaye:** The text states he was voted the greatest player in Partizan's history *in 1995*. While this was a significant recognition, it wasn't the primary reason for his fame; his achievements during his playing career were what made him famous.



"
"anuchhed anusar, kun viseshtaley Hesperonicuslai bhelosireptarbata chuttaucha?","Correct answer is **B: tesko jhan thulo doshro nangra cha**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yasako dosro panja jhanai thulo thiyo, jasle hesperonicus namko udaya bhayo jasko earth """"paschimi panja"""" ho."" This translates to: ""Its second claw was much larger, which led to the rise of Hesperonicus, as if it were Earth's ""western claw"".""

This directly indicates that the larger second claw is the distinguishing feature of Hesperonicus compared to Bhelosiraptor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: tesko duita khutta cha (it has two claws):** While true, both Hesperonicus and Bhelosiraptor are described as having two claws. This isn't a unique characteristic.
*   **C: tesko juibhari pwakh cha (it has a very heavy wing):** The passage doesn't mention wings or weight.
*   **D: tesko tato ragat cha (it has warm blood):** The passage mentions it as a ""tato ragat bhaeko shikari chara"" (warm-blooded predator), but this is common to many animals, not unique to Hesperonicus compared to Bhelosiraptor."
“Hesperonicus” ko artha tyo prajatiko kun sharirik viseshtabata utpanna gariyeko ho?,"The correct answer is **A: nangra(haru)**.

The text states: ""Yasako dosro panja jhanai thulo thiyo, jasle hesperonicus namko udaya bhayo jasko earth """"paschimi panja"""" ho.""  This translates to: ""Its second claw was very large, which gave rise to the name Hesperonicus, as if it were Earth's ""western claw"".""

Therefore, the name ""Hesperonicus"" was derived from the **large claw(s)** of the dinosaur.
"
nimna madhey golibari sambandhi kun kathan satya ho?,"Correct answer is **C: ek warsha aghi dampattiko buffaloma bihe bhaeko thiyo.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Texusma tee jodile ek warshaghi vivah gareka thee."" (This couple got married in Texas a year ago.)
* It also mentions: ""Bafeloma janmeka 30 warshe pati golibarima marieka charmadhye ek thee tar unaki shrimatilai chot lagena."" (In the buffalo birthday celebration, the husband had one drunk friend and his wife didn't get hurt.)

Therefore, the couple got married in Buffalo a year ago.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pati ra patni dubai texasbata thiye** - The passage states they got married in Texas, but it doesn't mention they were from Dubai.
* **B: tyaha panch piditharu thiye** - The passage mentions one drunk friend, not five injured people.
* **D: golibari buffaloma bhayeko thiyo** - The passage says the birthday celebration happened in Buffalo, not the party itself.



"
nimna madhey golibari ghatana sambandhi bhayeko thaubare kun kathan thik cha?,"Correct answer is **A: tyo buffaloma warshikotsawa ko bhojma bhayeko thiyo.**

Here's why:

*   The text states: ""Bafeloma janmeka 30 warshe pati golibarima marieka charmadhye ek thee tar unaki shrimatilai chot lagena.""  This translates to: ""In the Buffalo's 30th birthday party, her husband got a heart attack, but she was saved.""

Therefore, the heart attack happened at the Buffalo's annual celebration (warshikotsawa).  The other options are incorrect because:

*   B: The text mentions a formal anniversary celebration, but doesn't say the heart attack occurred *during* the formal program.
*   C: While the couple got married in Texas, the heart attack happened in Buffalo (bafeloma).
*   D: The text clearly indicates the heart attack happened to the husband *during* the party, not within their marriage itself.



"
"anuchhed anusar, adhikariharu lai luno ko bare suruwati chinta ke thiyo?","The correct answer is **C: indhanko chuwahat (fuel shortage)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Luno tukrida yasama 120-160 ghanmeter indhan thiyo ra uccha aandhi ra chhalle yasalai bandhama dhakelyo."" This translates to ""Luno had 120-160 cubic meters of fuel, and a strong storm pushed it into the sea.""
* This clearly indicates a fuel shortage is the initial concern. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mal cargo ko kami (lack of cargo)** - The passage mentions the initial thought was that the cargo might be light, but this wasn't the *primary* concern initially.
* **B: chhalharu ra uccha aandhi (thieves and strong storm)** - While both are mentioned, the fuel shortage is presented as the immediate issue arising from the storm.
* **D: dalka sadasyaharulai huna sakney sambhawit chotpatakharu (possible injuries to the crew members)** -  The passage states that the crew members were rescued with only minor injuries, so this wasn't the initial concern.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey lunoko kharabibare kun kathan satya hoina?","Correct answer: C: baarha jana dal ka sadasyaharu madhey, ekjanalai chotpatak lagyo

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Helicopterharule bahra chalak dalka sadasyaharulai uddhar gare ra ek matra chotpatak futeko naak thiyo."" This translates to ""Helicopters rescued the 12 members of the team and only one had a minor cut.""

* **Option C says:** ""baarha jana dal ka sadasyaharu madhey, ekjanalai chotpatak lagyo"" which means ""Among the twelve members of the team, one got injured"".  While it's true *one* person was injured, the passage specifies it was a *minor cut* (chotpatak futeko naak). Option C doesn't include the detail about the minor injury.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the passage:

* **A: kharabi cargo uthauna aghi bhayeko thiyo:** ""suruma adhikariharu jahajle kehi bhar pokhna sakha bhani daraye"" - ""Initially, the officers feared the plane was carrying some cargo."" This indicates a potential problem related to cargo before the flight.
* **B: kharabi huda jahajma 100 metersko indhan thiyo:** ""100 mitterko jahaz afno samanya malko cargo linka lagi yatra gariraheko thiyo"" - ""The 100-meter plane was traveling to its usual cargo link.""  It's mentioned the plane had 100 meters of fuel and was on its way to a cargo link.
* **D: jahajlai bandhama dhakalieko thiyo:** ""lunoko kharabibare jahajlai bandhama dhakalieko thiyo"" - ""The plane was forced to land due to the malfunction."" This directly states the plane was forced to land because of the malfunction.



"

The passage states: ""Sun 1960 ko dashakma uni ferry nav-swatantra algeriama farkieka thee june chalchitra nirdeshan sikaunaka lagi thiyo."" This translates to ""Sun went to newly independent Algeria in the 1960s to learn filmmaking."" This indicates Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
antyeshti samharoko lagi kaha television screenharu sthapana gariyeko thiyena?,"The correct answer is **A: romebhari**.

The passage states: ""Romka vibhinna thaunharuma mancheharulai samaroha hern dinka lagi dherai thulla television screenharu jadan garieka thee."" This translates to ""In Rome and various other places, large television screens were set up for people to watch the ceremony.""  Therefore, the screens were *not* set up in Rome itself. The other options *were* mentioned as locations where screens were set up.
"
antyeshti samharo kaha gariyo?,"The correct answer is **A: romebhariko vibhinna sthanharuma** (in various places in Rome).

The passage states: ""Romka vibhinna thaunharuma mancheharulai samaroha hern dinka lagi dherai thulla television screenharu jadan garieka thee."" This translates to ""In Rome, many large television screens were set up for people to watch the ceremony.""  The passage also mentions Poland as a location where similar setups were created, but the primary location described is various places *in Rome*.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: cent peters square ma** (in St. Peter's Square): While St. Peter's Square might have had screens, the passage doesn't specify it as the *only* or primary location. It mentions *various* places in Rome.
* **B: polandma** (in Poland): Poland is mentioned as *another* location, not the primary one.
* **D: pahila romema tyaspachi italyko arko saharma** (first in Rome, then in another city in Italy): The passage doesn't suggest a sequence of locations. It focuses on the simultaneous setup of screens in various locations in Rome and Poland.



"
"wisfotan bhae pachhi, gambhir chotpatakko lagi kaslai upachar gariyo?","The correct answer is **A: kamsekam paanch jana manis (at least five people)**.

The text states: ""wisfotka samayama kamtima paanch jana wyaktima aghatko lakshan dekhiekale tinko upchar garieko thiyo."" This translates to ""At the time of the explosion, at least five people showed signs of injury and received first aid.""
"

The text states: ""Chhimekile gyaans chuhieko barema phone garepachhi gyaans companyka ek adhikarile ghatanasthalma khabar gariraheka thee."" which translates to ""After calling about the knowledge mouse, an official of the gyan company was reporting the incident at the scene.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, akrmanma kati jana manis mariye?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""Panchaun wyaktiko taukoma nishana lagaune kramama ukako hatiyarle cam garena."" This translates to ""Fifty people were shot with gunshot wounds.""  The following sentence mentions Edger, Nicolus, Jacheri, and Christopher, totaling four individuals who were directly involved in the attack or its aftermath as described. While the passage details the injuries of Christopher Schneider, it doesn't explicitly state the number of people who died. However, the phrasing about ""gunshot wounds"" strongly implies fatalities.  The most reasonable inference, given the context and common understanding of such events, is that **4** people died.
"
akramanko dauran kunai samayma kasko hatiyarley kam garena?,"The correct answer is **B: uka**.

The passage states: ""Panchaun wyaktiko taukoma nishana lagaune kramama **uka**ko hatiyarle cam garena."" which translates to ""The weapon **of them** was used to take aim at the victim in order.""  ""Uka"" refers to the weapons of the individuals involved.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kadabyak:** While Kadabyak was driving, the passage doesn't explicitly state her weapon was used.
* **C: snider:**  The passage says Schneider was the one *needing* surgery and *suffering* the consequences, not wielding a weapon during the attack.
* **D: alden:** Alden is mentioned as being present, but there's no indication he used a weapon.



"
nimna madhey kun khellai olympic karyakrambata hataiyo?,"Correct answer is **A: squash**.

The passage states: ""rugby, vishesh gari rugby union ra gulf olympicma sahabhagi lynn manine paanch any khelka rupma chhanieka thee. Baseball ra saftabalko sath sathai squash, karate ra roller khelharu olympicma praesh gurney prayas gare...""

This indicates that squash was among the five sports that tried to be included in the Olympics, but it doesn't explicitly say it was *included*. The passage later implies that some were not successful.

The passage doesn't mention baseball, karate, or roller sports being removed from consideration. Therefore, squash is the most logical answer based on the information provided.
"
nimna madhey kun khellai antarrashtriya olympic samitile khelharuma smawesh garne matadan garey?,"The correct answer is **B: baseball**.

The passage states: ""Baseball ra saftabalko sath sathai squash, karate ra roller khelharu olympicma praesh gurney prayas gare..."" which translates to ""Baseball and softball along with squash, karate and rollersports tried hard to be included in the Olympics..."" and later ""rugby, vishesh gari rugby union ra gulf olympicma sahabhagi lynn manine paanch any khelka rupma chhanieka thee."" which means ""rugby, especially rugby union and the Gulf Olympic were among five other sports that were considered."" 

While rugby is mentioned, baseball is specifically listed as one of the sports that made an effort to be included. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.
"
arthur guinessley st. james gate brewery kati barshako lagi bhadama liye?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The text states: ""250 warshapachhi..."" which translates to ""250 years later...""  This refers to the time period between the signing of the agreement and the development of the Guinness company into a global enterprise.
"
harek barsha guinessley lagbhag kati billion dalar kamaucha?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**

Here's why:

The text states: ""250 warshapachhi, ginij ek vishwawyapi wyawasayama wiksit bhaeko cha jasle pratyek barsha 10 billion euro (US$14.7 billion)bhanda badhiko carobar gardacha.""

This translates to: ""250 years later, Guinness has developed a global business that earns more than 10 billion euros (US$14.7 billion) each year.""

Therefore, Guinness earns approximately 10 billion euros per year. The question asks for the answer in billions of dollars, and the text provides the equivalent as 14.7 billion dollars. However, among the options given, **10** is the closest and most directly stated figure related to their yearly earnings in the provided text.
"
europeli sanghko katiwata rashtrama h5n1 virusko pahichan bhaeko cha?,"The correct answer is **C: saat (seven)**.

The text states: ""Astriya, germany, slovenia, bulgaria, grease ra italypachhi yo bhairasabata pidit hune europeli sanghako sataun rashtra france ho."" which translates to ""After Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy, France is the seventh European country affected by this virus.""
"

The text states: ""ley sombar franceko purvama leone najikai marcellandma fella pareko ek mrit jungli haansalai sankramit gareko pushti bhaeko cha.""  This translates to ""on Monday, a dead wild goose infected with the H5N1 virus was found in Marcelland near Leone in the east of France.""
"
shanti senaharule rog sarna aghi haiti ma yo rogko sankraman antim palta kahile bhaeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 co dashak**.

The text states: ""Senako agaman hunuaghi, haitile sun 1800 co dashakpachhi yo rogsanga sambandhit samasyaharuko samana garnupareko thiena."" This translates to ""Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not been able to solve the problems related to this disease since the 1800s.""  This indicates the disease was present in Haiti in the 1800s *before* the UN peacekeepers arrived.
"
kun sthanko phohorley rog sarnama yogdaan garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: sanyukta rashtra sanghko chaauni (United Nations mission)**.

The passage states that the UN peacekeepers were accused of spreading disease after the 2010 earthquake. It also mentions that independent studies in Haiti suggested Nepali UN peacekeepers might have brought the disease to Haiti.  Therefore, the UN mission is the entity connected to the spread of the disease.
"
iris sarkarle ke garney yojana gardai cha?,"The correct answer is **A: laghuausadh sambandhi apradhiharulai karwahi garne** (Take action against criminals related to illegal drugs).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ahileka asanwaidhanik pariwartanharu lago bhaedekhi laguaushadha sambandhi karwahi hastantaranka lagi chinta wyakta gare."" This translates to ""...expressed concern for the transfer of responsibilities for actions related to illegal drugs due to the existing unconstitutional changes.""  This implies taking action against those involved in illegal drug activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: laghuausadhko anumati maa thap kada kanun bhitryaune** (Punish those who violate the law in drug permits): While related, the focus is more on criminal action than punishing permit violations.
* **C: laghuausadhko anumati sambandhi kanunharu khukulo parne** (Liberalize laws related to drug permits): The passage doesn't suggest liberalization.
* **D: laghuausadhlai gairapradhikaarn garne** (Delegate drugs to non-governmental organizations): The passage focuses on government action against illegal drugs, not delegation to NGOs.



"
irelandma ke asthai rupma vaidh thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: laghuausadh (drugs)**.

The provided text discusses a new law in Nepal regarding drugs and its potential impact on public health and the criminal justice system. The question asks what was temporarily valid in Ireland. The text explicitly mentions ""laghuausadha sambandhi karwahi hastantaranka lagi chinta wyakta gare"" which translates to ""expressed concern for the transfer of drug-related cases.""  This directly refers to drugs.
"
sankha gariyeko apradhilai keko lagi anusandhan garindai cha?,"The correct answer is **C: todfod (vandalism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Christopher Garciale bhane key shankaspad purush aparadhilai todfod gareko bhaera anusandhan bhairaheko cha."" This translates to ""...Christopher Garciale, a suspect, is being investigated for vandalism.""

The passage also mentions that while there was no physical damage (""Chinhalai bhautik rupma kshati purryaieko thiena""), vandalism is a form of destruction and damage to property, even if not directly causing physical damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: anadhikarik prawesh (trespassing):** While possible, the passage specifically mentions ""todfod"" (vandalism) as the crime he's suspected of.
*   **B: bhautik kshati (physical damage):** The passage explicitly states there was no physical damage.
*   **D: chori (theft):**  There's no mention of theft in the passage.

Therefore, ""todfod"" (vandalism) is the most accurate answer.
"
chinahalai parimarjan garda doshiley ke garena?,"The correct answer is **A: tesko euta akshar pariwartan (a change of one letter)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""callo kapda prayog garera """"O""""lai sano akshar """"e"""" maa badalna shanti ra mutuka chinhaharuko sathama parimarjan garieko thiyo."" This translates to: ""Using a white cloth, the 'O' was changed to the small letter 'e' with peaceful and pleasant symbols during the cleansing.""

This clearly indicates that the cleansing involved changing a single letter (""O"" to ""e"") on something, likely a symbol or logo, to make it more peaceful and pleasant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: teslai shantiko chinhale sajayo (it was decorated with symbols of peace)** - While the text mentions peaceful symbols, the primary action is the letter change, not just decoration.
*   **C: bhautik roopma kshati (physical damage)** - The text explicitly states that Chinhalai (presumably a symbol) wasn't physically damaged.
*   **D: teslai parimarjan garna tarpaulinsko prayog (the use of tarpaulins for cleansing)** - The text mentions a white cloth, not tarpaulins.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey keko lagi angreji shikshaklai dosh lagaena?","The correct answer is **C: bina anumati vigyapanharu chhapne**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the English teacher is accused of unauthorized advertisement in the classroom, but the teacher *didn't deny* this accusation. This suggests the teacher might not believe it's wrong or is trying to downplay it.
* The passage clearly states the teacher *denied* accusations of dating students (""mudda darta garieko thiena"" implies denial).
* The passage details accusations of using inappropriate language and sexual behavior in the classroom, which are serious allegations and likely would be denied.
* While copyright infringement is mentioned, the passage says the teacher ""didn't deny"" it, implying possible acknowledgement rather than outright denial.

Therefore, the only accusation the teacher doesn't seem to be actively denying is unauthorized advertisement."
"anuchhed anusar, ronaldo mendozad le kaslai bandhakko rupma rakhenan?","The correct answer is **A: paryatakharu** (tourists).

The passage states: ""Rolando Mendoza le paryatakharumathi afno M16 rifle chalayo. Dherai bandhak banaiekaharulai uddhar garieko cha ra ahilesamma kamtima cha janako mrityu pushti bhaeko cha.""  This translates to ""Rolando Mendoza pointed his M16 rifle at the tourists. Many hostages have been rescued and at least one person has died.""

Therefore, he took the **tourists** hostage.
"
"anuchhedko adharma, kun bandhakharulai chito riha gariyo bhanera pushti gariyena?","The correct answer is **A: paryatakharu (tourists)**.

The text states: ""Bachcha ra wriddha wyaktisahit cha bandhakharulai philipini photographerharulai jastai chhittai riha garie."" This translates to: ""Including children and the elderly, the hostages were all photographed like Filipino photographers.""  This implies that the tourists were among those photographed, and the text doesn't explicitly say that any specific group was released first. However, the context suggests all hostages, including the tourists, were subjected to this act. The question asks who *wasn't* explicitly confirmed to be released first, and the text doesn't mention any specific group being released before others, so tourists are the best answer.
"
"anuchhed anusar, brazilma samalingi vivahako samarthanko lagi kasley hastakshararu sankalan gardai chan?","Correct answer is **A: andolankariharu (activists)**.

The paragraph states: ""Andolankariharule novemberma national congressma dina 112 lakh hastaksharko nivedan sankalan gurney asha rakheka chan."" This translates to ""Activists hoped to collect a petition of 112 lakh signatures in the national congress in November.""
"
andolankariharuley uniharuko nivedan kaslai dinchan?,"The correct answer is **C: Brazilko national congress**.

The text states that the protesters submitted their petition to the National Congress. 

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
"Armand Bharsacheko anusar, bhidle mausamko pratikriya garna thik aghi ke bhayo?","The correct answer is **A: asina parna thalyo (it started raining)**.

The text states: ""tyasapachhi akashbata asina parchhan"" which translates to ""after that it starts raining from the sky."" The passage describes the weather event building up (wind increasing to 70 km/h) and then culminating in rain. Therefore, the rain started immediately before the described reaction from the people.
"
"Bharsache anusar, sabaibbanda baliyo aandhi kahiley suru bhayo?","The correct answer is **A: pradarshan suru hunuaghi kehi minute aghi** (a few minutes after the demonstration started).

Here's why:

* The passage describes the wind starting to blow after about a minute of the demonstration.
* It then mentions that the wind reached 70 kilometers per hour after another minute and a half. 
* The storm then becomes severe, causing people to panic and run for cover, and finally, objects fall from the sky.

Therefore, the strongest wind and the beginning of the severe storm happened a few minutes *after* the demonstration started.

"fredbhanda aghi, 35°W ko purvama katiwata mukhya aandhiberi record gariaka thiye?","The text states: ""...andhipehari kunai pani kshetralai jokhimma parnuaghi failine sambhawana cha bhanera bhaneka chan. Fried satellite imageryko awishkarpachhi atlanticko dakshin tatha purvi bhagma record garieko ahilesammkai sabaibhanda shaktishali ushna pradeshiya chakraat ho ra **35°W co purvama record garieko tesro thulo toofan ho.**""

This translates to: ""...andhipehari kunai pani kshetralai jokhimma parnuaghi failine sambhawana cha bhanera bhaneka chan. After Fried satellite imagery was discovered, the most powerful tropical cyclone on record in the southern and eastern parts of the Atlantic is located in the hot region and **35°W is the third largest cyclone recorded to the east.**""

Therefore, the answer is **B: teen (three)**.
"
"jaba fred cape verde tapuharuko najik awasthit huda, tyo kun disatira sariraheko thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: paschim (west)**.

The passage states: ""Purwanumankartaharule cape bherde tapuharuko 645 mile (1040 kilometer) paschimma awasthit yo..."" This translates to ""This [storm] is located 645 miles (1040 kilometers) to the west of Cape Verde...""

Therefore, when Fred is near Cape Verde, it is to the **west** of it.
"
nimna madhey kunko tesko purvavartiharu bhanda druta gati cha?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The question asks which of the options is faster than its predecessors. The provided text explicitly states: ""802.11n ko gati yasako pu bhanda 600Mbit/s ko adhikatam saidhantik praahasahit adhik drut cha."" which translates to ""The speed of 802.11n is faster than its predecessors by up to 600Mbit/s.""  Therefore, 802.11n is the fastest.
"
802.11nlai 802.11bsanga pachhadipatti sangat huna keko awashyakta chha?,"The correct answer is **A: ullekhniya druta gati (significant speed)**.

Here's why:

The text states that 802.11n is significantly faster than its predecessors (802.11a, b, and g), with a theoretical maximum speed of 600Mbit/s.  The question asks *why* 802.11n needs to be compatible with older standards. The most logical reason is to provide a significant speed improvement, which is the key advantage of 802.11n and what drives the need for backward compatibility.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: 802.11blai 5.0Ghzma sanchalan garna sakne khubi (Ability to operate in 5.0Ghz):** While 802.11n *can* operate on 5 GHz, backward compatibility isn't *dependent* on this feature. Older standards operate on 2.4 GHz.
* **C: 600Mbit/s ko praahasahit (With a 600Mbit/s throughput):** This is a *result* of 802.11n's design, not a reason for backward compatibility.
* **D: dohoro radioharu (Dual radios):**  Dual radios are a feature of *some* 802.11n implementations, but not a requirement for backward compatibility.



Therefore, the primary reason for backward compatibility is to offer a significant speed improvement, making option A the most accurate."
olympic swarna padak vijetaley rashtramandal khelkudma katiota pratiyogitaharuma paudi khelne thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: teen**.

The question states: ""Olympic swarna padak vijetale 100 meter ra 200 meter freestyle ra rashtramandal khelkudma **teen rilema paudi khelnu thiyo**"" which translates to ""The Olympic gold medalist competed in **three events** in the international games - 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle.""
"
olympic swarna padak vijetaley afnp pidako lagi kina ausadhi khairaheko thiyena?,"The correct answer is **C: tesle usko swasthatalai nakaratmak ruple asar garcha vanera chintit thiyo** (They were worried that it would negatively affect their health).

Here's why:

The original text states: ""Khelma pratibandha lagaieka karan uhaanle afno pidabata mukt hoon awashyak aushadhi lynn sakeka chhainan."" This translates to: ""They were prohibited from using medicine to alleviate their pain, and therefore they could not obtain necessary medication.""

The reason *why* they were prohibited is because they were worried about the negative impact on their health. The text directly implies this concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: usanga kunai pida thiyena** (They had no pain): This contradicts the premise of the question. The text explicitly states they were suffering from pain.
* **B: tesle uuslai birami banauthiyo** (It was making them tired): While pain can cause fatigue, the core reason for the prohibition is health concerns, not just tiredness.
* **D: tesko prayog garna rashtramandal khelkudma anumati chaina** (Using it was not permitted in national sports):  While this might be a contributing factor, the text emphasizes the worry about negative health effects as the *reason* for the prohibition.



"
"anuchhed anusar, bhukampa gatiwidhaibare keley bhram srijana garna sakthyo?","The correct answer is **A: kalo badalko upasthiti (presence of dark clouds)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Badalle bhramaka lagi sambhawana prastut gare key katai wastawik bisfot bhaeko thiyo."" This translates to: ""Instead, a real explosion occurred near dark clouds, presenting a possibility of hallucinations.""

Therefore, the presence of dark clouds is directly linked to the possibility of hallucinations (bhramaka). The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: icelandic mausam vigyan karyalayako reportharu (reports from the Icelandic Meteorological Office):** The passage mentions this as a source of *no* earthquake activity.
*   **C: antarrashtriya bhukampa manchiitra (International Seismological Centre):** The passage states the ISC showed no earthquakes.
*   **D: icelandko aru kshetrama report gariyeko gatiwidhi (activity reported in other areas of Iceland):** While an earthquake did occur in another area, the passage links the hallucination possibility *specifically* to the dark clouds near the volcano.



"
"anuchhed anusar, charan parivartan kahile ghatyo?","Correct answer is **C: march 10 ma**.

The passage states: ""Charan parivartan garaune ullekhaniya bhukampa gatiwidhi march 10 maa jwalamukhiko shikhar calderaco uttari chheuma bhaeko thiyo."" which translates to ""A notable earthquake activity occurred near the northern flank of the caldera of the jwalamukhi peak on March 10.""
"
nimna kathanharu madhey chandraayaan-1 ko chandra jaanchbare kun sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: chandra jaanchko nishkashan safal bhayo** (the results of the moon mission were successful).

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Sandigdha sahita tinjana manisharu sun 2005 maa chori bhaeko doze niyanma thee ra ghatanasthalma nai mrityu pani bhayo."" This translates to: ""Three suspected individuals were involved in a theft in June 2005 and died at the scene."" This part of the text describes a completely unrelated event.

The subsequent part of the text describes the Chandrayaan-1 mission.  It mentions:

* ""Teen mahatwapurna vaigyanik upkaranharu boknu bahekh, chandra jaanchle charai tir paint garieko bharatiya rashtriya jhandako chhawi pani bokeko thiyo."" This translates to: ""Besides three important scientific instruments, the image of the Indian national flag was also painted on the moon during the moon landing."" 

Therefore, the passage confirms the Chandrayaan-1 mission *did* have:

* An orbiter (implied by ""chandra jaanchle charai tir paint garieko bharatiya rashtriya jhandako chhawi"" - the flag was painted *during* the moon landing)
* Important scientific instruments
*  The Indian national flag painted on the moon.

However, the text *doesn't* say the mission's *results* were successful.  It just describes the technical aspects of the mission (instruments, flag).  Success or failure of the mission is not mentioned.
"
nimna kathanharu madhey kunley chandra jaanchlai sahi tarikale varnan garcha?,"Correct Answer: **A: tyo chandramako uttari dhruv najik awataran garyo**

Here's why:

The passage states that the mission involved ""chandra jaanchle charai tir paint garieko"" (flying towards the moon and painting). This implies an orbital mission to the moon, specifically targeting the lunar north pole, which is a key scientific objective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: tesko jokhimpurwak awataran safal thiyo** (Its risky landing was successful): The passage doesn't mention a landing, only painting.
*   **C: tyo euta manavyukta orbiterbata bahira fyakiyeko thiyo** (It was ejected from a manned orbiter):  There's no mention of a manned orbiter in the provided text. It describes a robotic mission.
*   **D: yesley duita mahatwapurna upakaranharu bokekoo thiyo** (It carried two important instruments): While the passage mentions three instruments, it doesn't describe the nature of the mission in a way that primarily focuses on the instruments themselves. The key aspect is the flight towards the lunar pole.



Therefore, option A best describes the lunar mission mentioned in the text."
"anuchhedko adharma, rog viruddha kun surakshako upaya antimma lagu hunecha?","The correct answer is **A: kitnashak**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kitnashak chharkine jasta upaya garnaka lagi prerit gareko cha."" This translates to ""...inspired to take measures like insecticide spraying."" Therefore, *kitnashak* (insecticide) is mentioned as a protective measure against the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sungur samatneharu (mosquito nets):** While mentioned as a way to prevent mosquito bites, the passage specifically mentions insecticides as a protective measure.
* **C: encephalitis khop (encephalitis vaccine):** The passage mentions the government's pledge for an encephalitis vaccine, but it doesn't state it as a *protective measure* being implemented. It's a plan for the future.
* **D: lamkhutte ko lagi jhulharu (swings for children):** Swings are mentioned as a way to alleviate the psychological impact of the disease, not as a protective measure against the disease itself.



"
rog manavma kasari sarcha?,"The correct answer is **A: lamkhutte**.

The passage states: ""Sungurharu yo roka wahak hunchhan ra tyasapachhi yo lamkhutte manawama sarchha."" which translates to ""The mosquitoes act as vectors and then they spread (or enter) into the human body.""  ""Lamkhutte"" means ""spread"" or ""enter"".
"
doshro wakyako asafaltale kasto parinaam nimtyauna sakcha?,"The correct answer is **B: bhavishyako lagi samalingi nagarik union ko aadhikar (Future rights for same-sex citizens)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the failure of the second clause (which proposed a ban on same-sex civil unions) could potentially ""open the door for same-sex unions in the future.""  This directly relates to the future rights of same-sex citizens.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: HJR-3 ko tatkal samikshya (Immediate review of HJR-3):** While HJR-3 might be reviewed, the passage doesn't explicitly state this is a *direct* consequence of the second clause's failure.  The review is scheduled anyway.
* **C: Euta apatkalin vidhayakiya satra (An emergency legislative session):** There's no mention of an emergency session being called as a result.
* **D: Samalingi nagarik unionharuko pratibandha (Ban on same-sex civil unions):** The passage states the *opposite* – that the failure *could* open the door for civil unions.



"
"anuchhed anusar, doshro wakya kahiley hataieko thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: vidhayakiya satrama (in the legislative chamber)**.

The passage states: ""Pratinidhimandalle dosro wakya metaepachhi vidhayakiya satrama parivartan gariyo ra sombar sadandwara yastai prakarma parit bhayo."" This translates to: ""In the representative council, after the second clause, changes were made in the legislative chamber and the same action was passed by the Monday session.""
"
“panama papers” kaslai pradan garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: press**.

The text states: ""June 2016 wasanta rituma presma prakashit bhayo."" This translates to ""In the spring of June 2016, it was published in the press."" Therefore, the Panama Papers were revealed through the press.
"
"anuchhed anusar, Britis patrikale kasle dhan lukauna dherai companyharu vyawasthapan gardai thiyo vanera daabi garyo?","Correct answer is **A: vibhinna bankharuka dhani grahakharu (various wealthy clients)**.

The passage states: ""Kagajatharule chaudha bankharule dhani grahakharulai curr ra any niyamharubata bachauna arabaun americi dollarko sampatti lukauna maddat gareko dekhae."" (The papers show that fourteen banks helped wealthy clients hide billions of dollars in assets from taxes and other regulations.)

Therefore, the British newspaper claimed that **various wealthy clients** used many companies to hide their wealth.
"
nimna vimaan durghatanaharu madhey kunma sabaibhanda badhi mrityu vayo?,"Correct answer is **A: iranbata armenia jaandai gareko vimaan durghatana**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Armenia-bound plane crash resulted in the highest number of fatalities, with 168 deaths. 
* The other crashes resulted in fewer deaths: the police helicopter crash had 3 deaths and 3 injuries, and the Mashhad crash had 17 deaths. 

Therefore, the Armenia-bound plane crash had the most deaths.
"
nimna madhey kun iranma hune adhiansha durghatanako karan hoina?,"Correct Answer: **D: ramro sita marmat nagareko vimanko samuha (Proper maintenance of aircraft)**

Here's why:

The passage highlights the following as common causes of Iranian air disasters:

*   **Old aircraft:** The passage explicitly states that Iran has a ""fleet of old aircraft"" that are poorly maintained.
*   **Lack of funds to buy new aircraft:** International sanctions prevent Iran from purchasing new planes.
*   **International sanctions:** These sanctions directly limit the acquisition of new aircraft.

While proper maintenance is *always* important for aviation safety, the passage doesn't indicate it as a *common* cause of accidents in Iran. The focus is on the age of the fleet and the inability to replace older planes. Option D is not mentioned as a prevalent factor."

nimna madhey kun vishaya iraq study groupko reportle agraha gareko thiyena?,"The correct answer is **A: badhiraheko himsaa rokne ghosana** (guarantee of stopping ongoing violence).

Here's why:

The report explicitly states that the Iraq Study Group *cannot guarantee* stopping the slide towards sectarian war, heightened violence, and state failure. Therefore, it doesn't *propose* a guarantee of stopping violence.  

The report *does* advocate for:

*   **B: disama turnattai parivartan** (a shift in current policy)
*   **C: khulla bahashko prayog** (open debate and agreement on Middle Eastern policy)
*   **D: naya kutnitik pahal sthapana garna** (establishing new diplomatic initiatives)



"
"prahariko anusar, probhenjanoko dahiney-hat kaslai maninthiyo?","The correct answer is **B: lo piccolo**.

The passage states: ""Praharile low pikkoloko mathillo haat raheko cha..."" which translates to ""Praharile had a small hand like lo piccolo...""  This indicates that Prahari had a relationship with Lo Piccolo.
"
"anuchhedma diyeko jankariko adharma, falconko mrityuko karan ke thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: uni riyaan dwara sanchalit yuddhako samayma mariyeka thiye** (He died during the state-run war led by riyan).

The passage states: ""...uniharule afno shaktiko sanjallai sudridha parney kramama probhenjanoko sakesamma come rakhne niti anusaran gareka thee. Yea malikharulai probhenjanodwara tabasamma adhinma rakieko thiyo jabasamma unle 1992 maa mafia crusaders giovanni falcon ra paolo borselinoko jiwanko dabi gurney rajya viruddha riyanadwara sanchalit yuddhalai antyasamma purryaenan."" This translates to ""...they followed a policy of strengthening their own forces in a step-by-step manner. They kept the owner under control by means of intimidation until he did not end the state-run war led by riyan, which resulted in the deaths of mafia crusaders Giovanni Falcon and Paolo Borselino in 1992.""

Therefore, Falcon and Borselino died during the state-run war led by riyan. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the text.
"
nimna madhey kun hitoshi saitoko le praapta gareko samman madhey ek hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: judo viseshsagya (judo special achievement)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states Hitoshi Saitoko was a two-time Olympic gold medalist and a two-time world champion.
* It also states he was the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee.
* While he undoubtedly had *judo special achievement*, it's not mentioned as one of his *specific* honors mentioned in the text, unlike the Olympic gold medals and world championships.

Therefore, option D is the one that is not mentioned as an achievement of Hitoshi Saitoko in the given passage.
"
iwasakile kaha pratigya garna baata jogina safal bhaye?,"The correct answer is **A: Japan**.

The passage states that Iwasaki ""Afno yatrako kramama Iwasaki (Iwasaki) ley dherai patak samasyama pare."" and that he ""samudri daankuharule luteka thee ra unlai tibbatma ek kukhyat kukurle hamla gareko thiyo"". It also mentions he ""nepalma vivah gareka thee bhane unlai bharatma pakrau garieko thiyo.""  The question asks where he made a vow to become a yogi. The text doesn't explicitly state *where* he made the vow, only that he faced many problems on his journey. However, the common knowledge about Iwasaki (Ishiwatari) is that he made his vow in **Japan** after facing numerous hardships. Therefore, based on the provided context and general knowledge, Japan is the most likely answer.
"
iwasakilai kasle hamla garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: euta kukur (a dog)**.

The text states: ""unlai tibbatma ek kukhyat kukurle hamla gareko thiyo"" which translates to ""in Tibet, a famous dog attacked him.""
"
alonsole afno daud kahile samapta gare?,"Correct answer is **C: shumacharle aafno daud samapta gare pachi**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Micheal shumacharle daudaka kramama asankhya ladainharuma nilambanko kshatika karanle garda afno daud Alonsoko kehi samayapachi samapta gare."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher, due to numerous delays in the race, ended his race a little while after Alonso.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shumacharle unko agadiko pangra kharab pare pachi** - This describes the *reason* Schumacher's race ended, not *when* it ended.
* **B: Fisichelale afno karko niyantran gumae** - This is about Fisichella's situation, not Alonso's.
* **D: daudmaa agrani hunu aghi** - This is incorrect because the text clearly states Schumacher's race ended *after* Alonso had been leading.



"
ke karanley shumacharle afno daud chito samapta gare?,"Correct answer is **A: unle afno karko niyantran gumae (He lost control of his car)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Micheal Shumacharle daudaka kramama asankhya ladainharuma nilambanko kshatika karanle garda afno daud Alonsoko kehi samayapachi samapta gare.""  This translates to ""Michael Schumacher's race ended a little time later than Alonso's due to delays in numerous fights in the race, **because he lost control of his car**.""

While other options might be related to racing, the text directly links Schumacher's race ending to losing control of the car. Option D, ""karko suspensionma kshati (damage to the car suspension),"" is a possibility *why* he lost control, but the text doesn't directly state that. Option B and C are not mentioned at all in the provided text.
"
"anuchhed anusar, pakrau pareka manisharu ko jamanat kasle tokyo?","The correct answer is **A: pakrau gurney adhikari**.

The text states: ""Yadi swikrit bhaema ayuktale jamanat tokchhan ra pakrau gurney adhikarile darta gareko aroplai aupacharik banaunchhan."" This translates to ""If accepted, the commissioner will demand bail and the arresting officer will formally register the complaint.""  Therefore, the arresting officer (pakrau gurney adhikari) is the one who will handle the bail.
"
"anuchhedma ullekh gariyeko aasthai nirodhak aadesh anusaar, 24 ghantabhanda badhi rakhnakolagi pakrau pareka manisharulai ke rakhna anumati dinuparcha?","The correct answer is **D: euta sunuwai (a hearing)**.

The passage states: ""...yadi swikrit bhaema ayuktale jamanat tokchhan ra pakrau gurney adhikarile darta gareko aroplai aupacharik banaunchhan. tyasapachhi aropharu rajyako computer pranalima praishta garinchha jahaan mudda track garinchha. **Sunuwaima sandigdhako adhikarka nimti drut parikshankoka lagi mitti pani ankit cha.**""

This translates to: ""...if accepted, the commissioner will demand bail and the arresting officer will file a formal charge. After that, the accused will register the case in the state's computer system where the issue is tracked. **The soil is also reserved for prompt investigation for the purpose of clarifying doubtful details in the hearing.**""

Therefore, the passage implies that a hearing is a requirement before being held for more than 24 hours, according to the anti-obstruction order. Options A, B, and C are not explicitly stated as requirements in the passage.
"
Anuchhed anusaar raddha garieko runoff laai vyaakhya garnu kun kaaran prayog garieko thiena?,"The correct answer is **D: Samwaidhanik aspashtata (Constitutional ambiguity)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that the decision to cancel the election runoff was made by officials due to ambiguity in the Afghan constitution regarding the definition of ""kidnapping.""  The paragraph explicitly mentions this ambiguity as a reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Suraksha jokhim haru (Security risks):** While security risks are mentioned as a concern, the paragraph doesn't state they *caused* the decision to cancel the runoff. It points to the constitutional ambiguity as the primary driver.
* **B: Sanvidhanko birodhaavaas (Violation of the constitution):** The paragraph doesn't say that canceling the runoff *violates* the constitution; it's the ambiguity *within* the constitution that's the problem.
* **C: Ucha kharcha (High expenses):** High expenses are not mentioned in the paragraph at all.



"
Kutnitigyaharule antata kina runoff laai anawashyak thaane?,"The correct answer is **C: sanvidhanma aspashtata thiyo (There was ambiguity in the constitution.)**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kutnitigyaharule Afghanistan ko sanvidhanma anawashyak rupma apharan nirdharit garna paryapta aspashtata fella pare bhane. Yasale aghilla reportharulai khandan gardacha jasma nirnayak nirvachan radd garnu sanwidhanko viparit huncha bhanieko cha.""

This translates to: ""Diplomats said that there was sufficient ambiguity in Afghanistan's constitution to define arbitrary arrests. This has led to widespread reports that deciding to cancel elections would be against the constitution.""

The core issue raised by the diplomats is the ambiguity in the constitution regarding arbitrary arrests, making the election cancellation decision potentially unconstitutional.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
FATA kaa laagi nyayik sewaharu kasle pradan garchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Rajnitik agentharu (Political agents)**.

The text explicitly states: ""pakistani rashtrapatile FATA maa shasson garna ""rajnitik agentharu"" niyukta gareka chan, jasle ilakaharuma lagbhag purna swayatta niyantran prayog gardachan. Yea agentharu pakistani sanwidhanko dhara 247 antargat sarkari ra nyayik sewaharu pradan garna jimmewar chan.""

This translates to: ""The Pakistani president appointed ""political agents"" to govern FATA, who will use almost complete self-rule in the area. These agents are responsible for providing government and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution.""

Therefore, the political agents are the ones responsible for providing these services.
"
FATA ko “raajnitik agentharu” sambandhi nimna madhye kun kathan galat cha?,"The incorrect statement is **C: Uni haru Pakistan sanwidhanko palana gardachan (They follow the Pakistani constitution).**

Here's why:

The text states that ""Pakistani president has appointed 'political agents' to administer FATA, who will exercise almost complete self-control in the areas. These agents are responsible for providing government and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution.""

However, the core issue with FATA (Faisalabad Tribal Areas, now known as Khyber Pakhtunkhwa's tribal districts) is its unique status and the historical context of limited Pakistani government control. The ""political agents"" operate within a framework that has historically allowed them significant autonomy and a different relationship with the Pakistani constitution than other parts of the country. They aren't necessarily expected to strictly *follow* the constitution in the same way as civil servants in other regions, especially in areas related to security and governance. Their authority is derived from a special agreement and a particular administrative system, which often operates somewhat separately.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Uni haru le nyayik sewa pradan garchan (They provide judicial services):** The text explicitly states this: ""under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution...they are responsible for providing government and judicial services.""
* **B: Uni haru lai Pakistani sarkar le chayan gareko ho (They are appointed by the Pakistani government):** The text directly says: ""Pakistani president has appointed 'political agents'.""
* **D: Uni haru ko kehi kshetrama purna niyantran cha (They have complete control in some areas):** The text clearly states: ""...who will exercise almost complete self-control in the areas.""



Therefore, option C is the flawed statement because the ""political agents"" operate under a special administrative arrangement and don't inherently *follow* the Pakistani constitution in the same manner as government employees in other areas.

The text states that Emma Stone received awards for Best Actress.
"
Ukta chalchitra kun awardko laagi manonayan bhaena?,"The correct answer is **C: sarvotkrishta dhwani mishran (Best Sound Mixing)**.

Tala ullekh garieka madhya kun chahi bhukampa pachhi sanchalan maa rahe?,"The correct answer is **A: Hokuriku Shika plant kaa sabai reactor haru**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hokuriku electric power companyle report garyo key bhukampabata kunai prabhawa bhaena ra yasaka shika anawik urja plantma number 1 ra 2 reactorharu band garie."" This translates to: ""Hokuriku electric power company reported that there was no impact from the earthquake and that the number 1 and 2 reactors at the nuclear power plant were shut down."" The phrase ""number 1 ra 2 reactorharu band garie"" indicates that these specific reactors were shut down, implying all reactors at the Hokuriku Shika plant were operational *prior* to the shutdown.  Therefore, they were operating before the earthquake.
"
"Anuchhed anusar,tala kaa madhye kesle bhukampa maa kshyati behyore?","The correct answer is **B: Shika plant kaa dui reactorharu**.

The passage states: ""Hokuriku electric power companyle report garyo key bhukampabata kunai prabhawa bhaena ra yasaka shika anawik urja plantma number 1 ra 2 reactorharu band garie."" This directly translates to ""Hokuriku electric power company reported that there was no effect from the earthquake and that the number 1 and 2 reactors at the nuclear power plant were shut down.""
"
"Annuchhed anusar, tala kaa madhye kun bisaya kagajat maa ullekh gariyeka chainan?","Correct answer is **B: 1967 ko yuddha ko kaaran**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the "" सीमा विवाद लाई जनाउनेछ जसमा Palestine le Sun 1967 co madhyapurva yuddha agadiko simako adharma chahanthyo."" This translates to ""It refers to the border dispute in which Palestine challenged the borders established after the 1967 Middle East War.""

While the passage *mentions* the 1967 war and the border dispute it created, it explicitly states the dispute *arose* from the war. The other options are mentioned, but not as the primary subject being discussed in the paragraph.
"
Tala madhye kun Palestine ko maag haina?,"The correct answer is **A: Yudha aghiko srat maa aadharit simaana** (Borders based on the lines of the 1967 war).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Gopya sutra anusar, kagajatle sima vivadlai janaunechha jasma palestinele sun 1967 co madhyapurva yuddha agadiko simako adharma chahanthyo.""  This translates to: ""According to the Geneva Accords, the border dispute should be resolved based on the lines of the 1967 Middle East War.""  The passage then goes on to say that other issues are included, but the future status of Jerusalem is considered. The agreement mentions a 10-year Israeli military presence, with the PA agreeing to 5 years.  Therefore, the core issue, according to the Geneva Accords as presented in the text, is the border based on the 1967 war lines.  The other options are details *related to* the agreement, but not the core disagreement highlighted in the passage.



"
Ma le kun muluk maa kaanun ko adhyayan gare?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanyukta Rajya America**.

The text states: ""Hongkongma janmeki Ma(Ma)ley new york university ra harward law schoolma adhyayan gare..."" which translates to ""Born in Hong Kong, Ma studied at New York University and Harvard Law School..."" New York University and Harvard Law School are both in the United States.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, kun deshle wakalat gareka kaaran Ma le nirvachan jitna safal bhayin?","The correct answer is **A: Sanyukta Rajya America (United States of America)**.

The passage states that Ma received a ""green card"" (permanent residency) in the USA and successfully argued cases with ""close connections to the main Chinese authorities"" *despite* the accusations. This implies he was working within the US legal system.
"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh gariye anusar, Carolyn Wilson le sahar janu pahile kaska laagi kaam garin?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states: ""Jab bhadama basneharule uniharusanga bhaeko kura sajha garna thale, dheraijaso sanlagna pariwarharule achanak mahasus gare key OHA ca Caroline Wilsonle uniharuko suraksha nikshep chori gareko thiyo ra sheher chhodera bhagyo."" This translates to: ""When the residents shared what happened to them, many concerned families suddenly realized that Caroline Wilson of OHA had stolen their security deposits and fled the city.""  Therefore, Caroline Wilson worked for OHA.
"
"Season maa char race haru baaki huda, Drivers’ Championship ko chautho sthan maa ko chha?","The answer is **A: Hamlin**.

The text states: ""Tesroma, hamlin bees ankle pachadi ra boyarbhanda paanch ankle aghadi raheko cha."" This translates to ""Tesroma, Hamlin is 5 points ahead of Bowyer.""  Since Hamlin is currently in 4th place, and the question asks who is in 4th place, the answer is Hamlin.
"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh gariyeko race anusar, Drivers’ Championship maa Kahne ko kati angka raheko chha?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne ra Truex, Junior 2,220 ra 2,207 ankaka sath kramashah pachaun ra chhaithaun sthanma chan."" This translates to ""Kahne and Truex, Junior are in 5th and 6th place with 2,220 and 2,207 points respectively."" Therefore, Kahne has 2220 points.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, kati patak manis harule awalokan gareko ulka pinda haru pachhi mangal graha maa utpatti bhaeko pramanit bhaeka chan?","The correct answer is **C: Pandhra patak**.

The passage states: ""Yea madhye pandhra vata chattanharulai gat julyma ulka pind warshaka lagi shreya diinchha."" which translates to ""Among these, fifteen rocks give a favorable meteor shower for the year.""  The question asks how many meteoroids originating from Mars have been observed. The passage directly states that 15 such meteoroids are observed.
"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaye anusar, mangal graha maa utpatti bhaeka chattan baare kun kura sacho ho?","The correct answer is **D: Tyaha 34 vata chan** (There are 34 of them).

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""karib 24,000 vata ulka pindamadhye kewal 34 vata matri mangal grahabata aeko pushti bhaeko cha.""  This translates to ""Among nearly 24,000 meteorites, only 34 are from Mars and are rich in minerals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sabai July maa bhaeko ulka barsha maa bhetiyeka thiye** (All of them were encountered in the meteor year in July) - The paragraph only mentions that 15 of the meteorites are seen in July.  It doesn't say *all* of them are.
* **B: Tyaha 24,000 wata thiye** (There were 24,000 of them) -  The paragraph states there were *nearly* 24,000, but doesn't confirm that's the exact number of Martian meteorites.
* **C: Tinko mulya sun bhanda 11,000 americi dollar badhi chha** (Their value is 11,000 American dollars more than gold) - While the paragraph mentions the high value of the rocks, it doesn't state the exact dollar amount increase compared to gold.  It only gives a range (11,000 to 22,500 USD per ounce).



"
Schumacher le kahile sanyas liye?,"The correct answer is **D: 2009 ko season ko antim maa jitepachhi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sumakar jo 2006 maa saat formula 1 championship jitepachhi sewa niwritta bhae jasle ghaite felip massako thaaun lynn anteka thee. Sun 2009 ko hangeri grand priksko belama brazily manisko taukoma gambhir chotpatak lagyo. Massa kamtima 2009 satrama bankika lagi bahira aune karan ho."" 

This translates to: ""When Schumacher won 7 Formula 1 championships in 2006, he retired, leaving the place for Felipe Massa.  Then, in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, the Brazilian man suffered a serious accident. Massa will at least be out for the 2009 season."" 

The sentence mentions Schumacher retiring *after* winning 7 championships in 2006, and then the accident that affected Massa in 2009.  While the accident affected Massa's 2009 season, the passage directly states Schumacher retired after winning in 2006. Option D is the only option reflecting this.
"
Massa kahile ghaaite bhaye?,"The correct answer is **A: Grand Prix ko dauran maa** (During the Grand Prix).

The text states: ""Sun 2009 ko Hangeri Grand Prixko belama brazily manisko taukoma gambhir chotpatak lagyo."" which translates to ""During the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, Brazilian man Massa suffered a serious injury.""

While the other options are related to Massa's career, the text explicitly states the injury happened *during* the Grand Prix.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, yasto wyawastha le AOL lai kasari asar garnecha?","The correct answer is **C: AOL kaa prayogkarta haruko sankhya laai Yahoo ra Microsoft kaa prayogkarta le takkar dine chhan.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Yahoo! and Microsoft, combined with AOL's users, will compete with AOL's customer base.  This implies that the competition will affect AOL's user numbers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL kaa prayogkarta ko sankhya badhna sakcha:** The passage suggests the opposite, that their users will be challenged by the combined strength of the competitors.
* **B: AOL IM bajaar maa nirmaan garieko ek maatra company banne chha:** The passage doesn't suggest AOL will be the only company in the market.
* **D: AOL sanyukta rajya america maa prayog hune chaina:** The passage discusses AOL's use in the USA. It doesn't say they won't be used there.



"
Naya byabastha pachhi tala madhya kun chai antya hune chha?,"The correct answer is **C: aafnai gati maa bajaar ko bikas garne AOL ko swatantrata (AOL's independence to develop the market at its own pace).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the merger allows AOL to develop and grow its own market.** This directly implies that AOL's previous independence in market development is now threatened or diminished.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: sanyukta rajya amerika maa wyapak internet ko bikas (The development of a widespread internet in the United States):** The passage doesn't suggest the merger will *end* the development of the US internet. It focuses on the impact on AOL's ability to develop *its* market.
* **B: IM bajaar ko prayog (The application of the IM market):**  While IM is mentioned, the passage isn't primarily focused on the future of the IM market itself.
* **D: Yahoo ra Microsoft ko saajhedaari (The alliance between Yahoo and Microsoft):** The passage doesn't suggest that the Yahoo-Microsoft alliance is ending; rather, it describes how the AOL-portal merger changes the competitive landscape.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate consequence of the merger, as stated in the passage, is the potential loss of AOL's independent ability to develop its market.



"
Aakraman maa maarieka kati jana prahari thiyenan?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The text states: ""गभार्नको कार्यालयले भन्यो के घाइतेहरुमध्ये उन्नाईस जना पुलिस अधिकारीहरु थिए।"" which translates to ""The government office said that among the injured were nineteen police officers.""
"
aakraman ko aaropit lai kasle report garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Prahari (Guard)**.

The passage states: ""Praharile bhanyo key tiniharule yo akramanka lagi tathakathit dies (ISIL) ladakulai shanka garchhan."" This translates to ""The guards said they suspect the attackers for the so-called ISIS (ISIL).""  Therefore, the guards reported the attack and their suspicion.
"
"Florida maa jitne le sabai rajya paune hunale, Mitt romni lai ke pradan gariyo?","Correct answer is **B: Republican Party ko manonayan**

Here's why:

* The text states that winning in Florida, where all states have delegates, ""aghadi badhayo"" (boosted his momentum) for Romney within the Republican party.  This refers to strengthening his position as a leading candidate for the party's nomination.
* While he won the vote in Florida, the key outcome was the boost to his candidacy *within the party*, not the specific number of delegates awarded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rajya ka 32 pratinidhi** - While Romney won 46% of the vote in Florida, the text doesn't specify that 32 delegates were awarded.  It focuses on the overall impact on his candidacy.
* **C: Rajya kaa sabai pratinidhi** -  This is incorrect because not all delegates in Florida are awarded to a single candidate.
* **D: 46 pratishat vote** -  While he achieved 46% of the vote, that's not the *result* he was awarded. It's the percentage he achieved, which led to the momentum boost.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, Gingrich le praathamik nirwachan maa kati pratishat vote prapta gare?","The correct answer is **B: 32 pratishat**.

The passage states: ""Sadanka purva americi adhyaksha Newt Jingrich 32 pratishat prapta garera dosro sthanma ae."" This translates to: ""Former American President Newt Gingrich received 32 percent and came in second place.""
"
"Anuchhed anusar, caucus ko natija pachhi kasle daud lai nirantarta dienan?","The correct answer is **C: Peri**.

The passage states: ""Periko bhanaianusar """"uni az ratiko caucus natijako mulyankan garna texas farkane chan jasma ukta daudama unka lagi aghadi kunai bato cha wa chhaina bhanera nirdharan gardacha"""", tar pachhi unle daudama nai rahandai...""

This translates to: ""According to Perri, he will return to Texas to evaluate the results of the state caucus, in which he will determine whether he has any path forward in the race...but later he remained in the race...""

Therefore, Rick Perry remained in the race after the caucus results, while Gingrich and Bachman dropped out.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, caucus ko natija pachhi kasle arko umwedwaar ko prashansa gare?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The passage states: ""Natija aepachhi, jingrichle santoramko prashansa gareka thee..."" which translates to ""The result is that Gingrich praised the conservative...""

Therefore, Newt Gingrich praised the conservatives after the caucus results.
"
2015 agadi karyakram pradarshan garieko ek matra thaau kun thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The text states: ""Toginetle astronet radiolai 2015 ko antama sahayak stationka rupma sthapit gareka thiye."" This indicates that before 2015, the program was primarily presented on TogiNet Radio. While it featured local Texas talent, the question asks where the program *originally* presented, and the text implies TogiNet was the primary venue *before* AstroNet became a supporting station.
"
Station le karyakram le kasto spin bhaeko warnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Sthaaniya (Local)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yo pradarshanile mull rupma purvi Texas **sthaniya** anubhawahin awaz kalakarharu prastut garyo."" which translates to ""This program mainly presented **local** experienced voice artists.""

While ""Purano"" (old) is mentioned in the context of the radio theater, the question asks about *how the station describes the program*. The key descriptive word used to characterize the artists is ""sthaniya"" (local).
"
David Headley le antata ke prapta gare jasle ladaku samuhako akraman lai sahayog garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Suchana (Information)**.

The text states that David Headley helped make a ""hatiyar dhaari vyakti"" (armed person) capable of carrying out the operation through ""scouting ra jankari sankalanle"" (scouting and information gathering). While grenades and automatic weapons were used in the attacks, the key to enabling the operation was the **information** Headley provided.
"
Mumbai pugna ladaku samuhale kun yaatayaat ko saadhan ko prayog gare?,"The correct answer is **C: Dungaa (Boat)**.

The passage states: ""November 26, 2008 maa dungabata aipugeka thee,"" which translates to ""On November 26, [the attackers] arrived by boat.""
"
Kun wakya le Nadal ra Raonic ko Brisbane Open match ko natija lai sahi rupma pratibimbit garchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic le Nadal lai haraaye (Raonic defeated Nadal)**.

Here's why:

* The question states that Nadal has a 7-2 head-to-head record against Raonic.
* The text explicitly says Nadal ""parajit hunubhayo"" (was defeated) by Raonic in the Brisbane Open.

Therefore, Raonic won the match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic sanga 88% net angka thiyo (He had 88% net points with Raonic)** - This is incorrect because the text states Nadal had 88% net points and Raonic had 76%.  It doesn't say Raonic *had* 88% net points with Nadal.
* **C: Nadal le Raonic lai haraaye (Nadal defeated Raonic)** - This is the opposite of what the text states.
* **D: Raonic le 76 anka prapta gare (Raonic achieved 76 points)** - While Raonic achieved 76 points, this doesn't describe the match's result; it just mentions a statistic.  The result is who won.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, pahilo serve pachhi Nadal ra Raonic ko match ko kun sthan thiyo?","Correct answer is **A: Raonic sanga 88% net anka thiyo**.

The passage states: ""Khelpma Nadalle 88% cool anka prapta gareka thee jasma unle pahilo sarbhamai 76% anka prapta gareka thee."" This translates to ""In the match, Nadal achieved 88% net points, while Raonic achieved 76% in the first set.""

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the information given in the passage.
"
Teen naya Naked News prasaran maa kun bhasa ko karyakram samaawesh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Japanese**.

The question asks which language is *not* included in the three new Naked News broadcasts. The text states they are including Spanish, Italian, and Korean, along with the existing English and Japanese broadcasts. Therefore, Japanese *is* included.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, naya Naked News ko prashaasaran kaha uplabdha hune chhainan?","The correct answer is **A: Mobile phone**.

The passage states that Naked News is starting programs in Spanish, Italian, and Korean for television, web, and mobile devices. Therefore, mobile phones are included in the platforms where the news will be available.

The options are:
* **A: Mobile phone** - Correct
* **B: Internet** - The web is mentioned, which is part of the internet.
* **C: Cinema ghar** - Cinema halls are not mentioned.
* **D: Television** - Television is mentioned as a platform.

Since the question asks where the new Naked News programs will be available *according to the paragraph*, and the paragraph explicitly mentions mobile devices alongside television and the web, mobile phone is the most accurate answer."
Giant Slalom lai kati jana pratishpardhi le sampanna garenan?,"Correct Answer: B: 117

The passage states: ""Giant slalomma 117 cool skier madhye 45 ley daudama shreni pauna sakenan."" This translates to ""In Giant Slalom, out of 117 cool skiers, 45 were able to finish the race."" Therefore, 117 competitors participated in the Giant Slalom.
"
Yea madhye kun wakya le Championship ko race ko natija lai sahirup maa pratibimbit garchhan?,"Correct answer is **B: 45 skier harule Giant Slalom maa aafno daud sampanna garenan.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks which sentence reflects the results of the Championship race.**
* **The text states: ""Giant slalomma 117 cool skier madhye 45 ley daudama shreni pauna sakenan.""** This translates to ""In giant slalom, out of 117 cool skiers, 45 were able to complete their run.""
* **Option B accurately reflects this result.** It directly states that 45 skiers did not finish their giant slalom run.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dosro race maa Carpanedole Hungary ko skier aghi sampanna gare** - The text doesn't mention any Hungarian skier winning the second race.
* **C: Slalom bhanda dherai skier harule Giant Slalom sampanna gare** - The text doesn't provide information to compare the number of skiers who finished slalom vs. giant slalom.
* **D: Carpenado le Slalom maa dashau sthan maa sampta gare** - While the text mentions Carpenado's slalom result, it doesn't say she finished in 10th place. It states she finished 9th. Also, the question asks about the *results* of the race, not just Carpenado's individual performance.



"
Yea madhye NBA le ke sthagit garne nirnaya garyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Basketball season**.

The passage states that the NBA postponed its upcoming basketball season due to COVID-19 concerns.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, ke kaaran le virus ko baarema NBA ko chaso nimtyayo?","The correct answer is **D: Utah jazz ko euta kheladi sangkramit bhae**.

The passage states: ""Yuta jazz kheladiko COVID-19 bhairasko parikshan sakaratmak dekhiepachhi NBA ko nirnaya ayo."" This translates to: ""The NBA made the decision after a COVID-19 test for a Utah Jazz player came back positive.""

While option A is related (NBA members being infected), the *direct* reason given for the postponement is the positive test of a Utah Jazz player. Option D is the most accurate and specific answer.
"
Atlanta Thrashers birudda ko khel ma Washington capitals ka lagi kasle nirnayak goal gare?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states: ""Ovechkin ko ratko khelko pahilo sahayog rookie nikalas backstrome (Nicklas Backstrom) ko khel jitaune golma thiyo..."" which translates to ""Ovechkin's first assist of the game was in Nicklas Backstrom's winning goal..."".
"
Capitals ra thrasaers ko khelma kasle season ko 60au goal gare?,"The correct answer is **D: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Ovechkin ko ratko khelko pahilo sahayog rookie nikalas backstrome ko khel jitaune golma thiyo; Unle tyas raat haneko dosro goal unle ukta sijanma haneko 60aun goal thiyo."" This translates to: ""Ovechkin gave his first assist in the winning goal scored by rookie Backstrom; And that night's second goal was his 60th goal of his career.""

Therefore, Nicklas Backstrom scored Alex Ovechkin's 60th career goal. Options A and B are incorrect because the text mentions Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux as having achieved this milestone previously, but doesn't state they did it *in this specific game*.
"
Northern rock bank lai sarkar baata kahile sahayata awashyak bhayo?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhito sankat ko belama (During the subprime mortgage crisis)**.

The text states: ""Nardan raklai sun 2007 maa subprime dhito sankatka samayama yasako exposureka karan samarthan awashyak pareko thiyo."" (Northern Rock needed support during the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007 due to its exposure.)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bank rashtriyakaran bhae pachhi (After nationalization):** The text says the bank needed support *before* nationalization.
*   **B: Jaba bank sampati wyawasthapan company baata tukriyo (When the bank separated from the property management company):** This happened *after* the crisis and nationalization.
*   **C: Bharjin samuha le bank kharid garepachhi (After the Virgin Group bought the bank):** This happened much later than the initial need for support.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun wakya le northern rock bank sanga samuha ko kaarobar lai sahi rupmaa vyaakhya garchha?","The correct answer is **B: Bharjin samuha le raashtriyakaran pachhi bank kharid garyo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bankko rashtriyakaran hunuaghi richard bransonko Bharjin samuhale bankaka lagi lagaeko boli aswikrit bhaeko thiyo."" This translates to ""Before the bank's nationalization, Richard Branson's Virgin Group's bid for the bank was accepted.""  The passage also mentions that Virgin Group bought the ""good bank"" (Northern Rock (retail)) after the nationalization. Therefore, they bought the bank *after* the nationalization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bharjin samuha le northern rock ko sampati wyawasthapan compani pani kharid garyo** - The passage explicitly states Virgin bought the ""good bank"" *not* the asset management company.
* **C: Dhito sangkat ko belaama, Bharjin samuha le bank lai aapatkaalin sahaayata garne prastaav garyo** - The passage says Virgin Group made a *bid* for the bank before nationalization, not offered emergency assistance during the crisis.
* **D: Bank ko laagi Bharjin samuha ko pahilo boli rashtriyakaran pachhi raakhiyo** - The passage indicates the bid was accepted *before* nationalization.

"Anuchhed maa ullekh bhae anusar, kyoto mausam samjhauta maa hastantaran garnaale kun muluk lai asar garyo?","Sahi jawab **C: Australia** ho.

Anuchhed maa bhaneko hun ki Kyoto samjhautako anumodan garnaale Australia lai arthavyawasthalai noksan purryauncha, kyoki Bharat ra China jasta deshharu utsarjanko laxyama badhya nabhaeko hunale.
"
Australia ko purva sarkar le kyoto ko anumodan le kaslai noksan garne batayo?,"Correct answer is **C: Koila niryat (Coal export)**.

The passage states that the former Australian government rejected the Kyoto Protocol because it feared that increasing emission reduction targets (like those of India and China) would harm its coal-dependent economy, especially its coal exports.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
"
Trail maa shooter harulai kun karyakramko laagi bharti garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Sporting shooter sangh ko shikaar karyakram**.

The text states: ""NPWS ra sporting shooters association off australia (NSW) inkko sajhedarima, sporting shooters associationko shikar karyakram antargat yogya swayamsewakharu bharti garie.""  This translates to: ""In collaboration with NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW), eligible volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.""
"
kun vakya le kit niyantran trial lai sahi rupmaa pratibimbit gardaina?,"Correct Answer: **C: Shooter haru lai ranger harule nirikshan gare**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Renjarharule purak kira niyantran parikshanma suterharuko najikaibata nirikshan garnupareko thiyo."" (Rangers were able to observe the shooters closely during the supplementary control test.)

* **Option C says:** ""Shooter haru lai ranger harule nirikshan gare"" (Shooters were observed by rangers). This is the *opposite* of what the passage says. The rangers were the observers, not the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Yo karyakram ko pahilo trial bhaeko le, yasko mulyankan bahena** (This program's first trial was successful, and it was evaluated) - This accurately reflects the text stating the first trial was successful.
* **B: Shooter harule parikshah nirdeshan prapta gare** (Shooters received test instructions) -  This is directly stated in the passage.
* **D: Chhaar shooter haruko chhanot gariyo** (Four shooters were selected) - This is also directly stated in the passage.



Therefore, option C is the only one that misrepresents the information in the passage."
"Anuchhed anusar, vibhajan kaha bhetiyo?","The correct answer is **A: Rift upatyaka maa**.

The text states: ""etiopiako rift bhyali research sarbhiska anweshak ra adhyayanka saha lekhak barhane esfawle bhane."" which translates to ""Barhane Esfawle, a researcher and scholar from the Ethiopian Rift Valley research service said.""
"
"Anuchhed anusar, apekshya gare bhanda aghi ke bhayo?","The correct answer is **B: Vibhajan (Division)**.

The text states: ""Yassako matlab vibhajan anawik pramanle anuman garebhanda dherai pahileko ho."" This translates to: ""Yassako means division happened much earlier than inference based on logical proof.""

Therefore, the passage says division occurred before any inference or logical proof.
"
Video game maa chal niyantran garna kheladi le ke garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Television najik sensor rakhnuhos**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Television remotma pune: sanyojan gardai, niyantran gurney controllerle yasako trikoniya sthanma trikonmit garna prayogkartako televisionko najikai rakhieka duiwata sensarharu prayog gardacha.""  This translates to: ""By connecting to the television remote, the controller uses two sensors placed near the television in a triangular position.""

Option C directly reflects this information.  The other options are partially correct but not the complete answer based on the provided text.
"
Television remote jasto dekhina ke design garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Nintendo Revolution controller**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the design was presented by Nintendo President Satoru Iwata and that the console's design involved a controller that used two sensors.  The text describes how these sensors worked with the television to allow motion control.
* The passage mentions the controller and its sensors as a key part of the design, implying it's the ""Nintendo Revolution controller.""
* Options A, C, and D are either too general (Mukhya prastuti - main presentation) or refer to parts of the system rather than the core control mechanism (Controller ko dui sensorharu - the controller's two sensors, and Nintendo Revolution console - the console itself). The question asks about the *design* of the controller.



"
Xinhua samachar agency ko pachhillo report maa kun kura ullekh garieko thiena?,"Correct answer is **A: Plane le bomb ko dhamki paeko thiyo**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *isn't* mentioned in the latest report. The provided text states that the initial report mentioned a bomb threat. However, the question specifically asks what the *latest* report *doesn't* mention. The text says the latest report mentions the bomb threat, diversion to Urumqi, and landing in Kandahar and Afghanistan. Therefore, the bomb threat is not something mentioned in the *latest* report according to the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Plane urumaqi ma avataran bhayo:** The text states the plane was diverted to Urumqi.
* **C: Plane Afghanistan tarfa pathaiyo:** The text explicitly states the plane was sent back to Afghanistan.
* **D: Plane kandahar ma avataran bhayo:** The text says the plane landed in Kandahar.
"
Xinhua samachar agency ko suru ko report ma ke ullekhit garieko thiena?,"Correct answer is **C: Plane Afghanistan firta pathaieko thiyo**.

Here's why:

The question asks what was *not* mentioned in the initial report. The prompt states that the initial report mentioned the plane was hijacked and diverted to Afghanistan. Option C, ""Plane Afghanistan firta pathaieko thiyo"" (Plane was sent back to Afghanistan), is mentioned in the prompt as part of the initial report, but it's the *final outcome* after the diversion, not something initially reported.

The initial report *did* mention:

*   **A: Plane hijack garieko thiyo** (Plane was hijacked)
*   **D: Plane le bomb ko dhamki paeko thiyo** (Plane received a bomb threat)
*   **B: Plane ko akasmik avataran aswikaar garieko thiyo** (Plane accepted emergency landing)



"
Radio karyakram maa Sara Danius le ke ghoshana garin?,"Correct answer is **A: Sahitya tarfa ko Nobel puraskar ko bijeta**

The question asks what Sara Danius announced on the radio program. The text states she announced that Bob Dylan had won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016. Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"
Ko sanga sambarka bhaena?,"The correct answer is **A: Bob Dealan ko najikko sajhedar (Bob Dylan's closest associate)**.

The text states that the Swedish Academy tried to contact Bob Dylan's closest associates but were unsuccessful. They did manage to get helpful responses from his close helpers.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sara Danius:** The text explicitly says Sara Danius is the one who made the announcement and is providing the information.
*   **C: Swedish Academy:** The text says the Academy tried to contact Bob Dylan's associates.
*   **D: Bob Dylan:** The text says the Academy tried to contact Bob Dylan's associates, not Bob Dylan himself."
Kasle pratibadhata laai “ek pramukh kadam” bhaeko tipani garnu bhayo?,"The correct answer is **B: George W. Bush**.

The text states: ""Bushka praakta gorden jondrole utter koreako yo pratibadhatalai **""""koreali prayadwipma pramanit paramanu n prapta gurney lakshyako dishama euta mahatwapurna kadam bhane.""**"" which translates to ""Bush's spokesperson Gordon Johndroe replied to this statement as **""This is an important step in the direction of achieving the goal of not obtaining certified nuclear weapons in Korean Peninsula.""** Therefore, George W. Bush is the one who commented that it was an important step.
"
Slania le vibhinna muluk haruka lagi kati tikat utpadan gare?,"The correct answer is **D: 1,000 mathi**.

The text states: ""Unle sweden ra 28 any deshharuka lagi **1,000bhanda badhi tikatharu** utpadan gareka thee."" This translates to ""They produced **more than 1,000 stamps** for Sweden and 28 other countries."" While it's more than 1,000, the closest and most accurate option given the choices is 1,000. The text doesn't specify the exact number, just that it was *more than* 1,000.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, tanky vent bata ninrantar chuhawat hune sambhawat kaaran ke ho?","Correct answer is **C: Thermal expansion**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Budhbar d, tankyka nikasharu sambhawat tanky bhitrako thermal wistarbata ajhai pani chuhine nai thee."" (On Wednesday, the leakage is likely due to thermal expansion inside the tank.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Madhyamik containment area kshamata samma bharieko thiyo (The secondary containment area was filled to capacity):** The passage states that the secondary containment area was *not* full.
* **B: Agni command pranaliko niyamit parikshan (Regular testing of the fire command system):**  The fire command system *failed* during testing, but the passage doesn't directly link that failure to the ongoing leakage.
* **D: Fort greely ko euta pump station ma ago lagnu (A fire in one of Fort Greely's pump stations):** While a fire caused the initial overflow, the passage clearly states that *thermal expansion* is the likely cause of the ongoing leakage from the vent.



"
Relief valve haru kina khule?,"The correct answer is **A: Tanky haru bhitra thermal wista bhaeko thiyo (The tanks were expanding due to thermal expansion inside)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Budhbar d, tankyka nikasharu sambhawat tanky bhitrako thermal wistarbata ajhai pani chuhine nai thee."" (On Wednesday, the tank overflows were likely due to thermal expansion inside the tank.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pranaliko parikshan pachhi power failure bhaeko thiyo (The power failure after the system test)** - While the power failure *caused* the initial problem, it wasn't the direct reason the relief valves opened. It was the failure that led to the pressure buildup.
* **C: Tanky haru purai kshamata samma bharieka thie (The tanks were completely filled to capacity)** - The passage states that the tank wasn't completely full (104,500 barrel capacity, but only partially filled).
* **D: Madhyamik containment kshetra le paryapta barrel atauna sakena (The secondary containment area couldn't drain enough barrels)** - The passage mentions the secondary containment area's capacity, but it doesn't say it failed to drain.  The overflow was *from* the tank, not *because* the containment area couldn't handle it.



"
Haal ninth waad maa pani kati mathi cha?,"The correct answer is **C: kammarsamma**.

The text states: ""Nawaun ward, jahaan toofan Katrinaka bela 20 feet samma uchai bhaeko badhi aeko thiyo, ahile najikaiko baandhalai paar garekale kammarsammako panima cha."" This translates to: ""In the Nawaun ward, where the storm Katrina had risen to 20 feet, now the water is about knee-deep (kammarsamma) on the other side of the nearby levee.""

Therefore, the water level in the haal ninth waad (current ninth ward) is described as ""kammarsamma,"" which means knee-deep.
"
Katrina toofan ko belama ninth ward maa ke ghatana bhayo?,"The correct answer is **C: badhi ko pani 20 feet mathi thiyo** (The water rose 20 feet).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Nawaun ward, jahaan toofan Katrinaka bela 20 feet samma uchai bhaeko badhi aeko thiyo..."" which translates to ""Ninth ward, where the flood rose to a height of 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Badhi ko pani 100 feet chauda thiyo** (The water rose 100 feet wide): The passage mentions the water is 100 feet *wide*, not high.
* **B: kammarmaathi samko pani le badhi nagyo** (The water did not rise to waist level): The passage explicitly states the water *did* rise to 20 feet.
* **D: 6 inch varsha le bhatkieko bandh paar garyo** (The 6-inch rainfall broke the levee): The 6-inch rainfall is mentioned as a *key* to the Corps of Engineers' work, but it doesn't describe what happened *during* Hurricane Katrina. The levee was already breached during the hurricane.



"
tala ullekh garie madhye kun chahi Hamilton le pushti garenan?,"Correct Answer: **B: Aru virami virus ko samparka maa aune sambhavana**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Aspatalle aru manisharulai sambhawya sankramanko rokatham garna biramilai alag garnu parne kura samawesh gardai..."" (The hospital has included isolating the patient to prevent potential infection to other people...) This directly addresses the possibility of other patients coming into contact with the virus.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: Jaha virami le bhraman gareka thie (Where the patient had traveled):** While the patient traveled to Nigeria, the core reason for isolation is not *where* they traveled, but the *risk* of infection they pose.
* **C: Yadi awayask protocol ko palana garieko thiyo (If the isolation protocol was followed):** This is a condition, not the reason for the isolation itself. The isolation is happening *because* of the risk.
* **D: Birami ko bartaman awastha (The patient's current condition):**  While the patient's condition is relevant, the passage focuses on the preventative measures being taken due to the potential for transmission, not solely on the patient's state.



Therefore, option B accurately reflects the primary reason for the isolation – preventing potential infection to others."
Vaigyanik haru ke patta lagauna chanchan?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaba puchhretara kahile prithvi sanga thokincha (When comets collided with Earth)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that comets may have brought the building blocks of proteins and life to Earth.
* Scientists are interested in how Earth formed, especially considering the impact of comets.  The question is about what scientists want to investigate regarding the past cometary impacts.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Protein kasari banchan (How proteins are made):** While mentioned, it's a consequence of the potential cometary delivery, not the primary focus of the scientists' investigation.
* **C: Jaivik padartha ke ho (What biological substances are):** Similar to B, this is a result being explored, not the core scientific question driving the investigation.
* **D: Prithvi kasari banyo (How Earth formed):**  While related, the question specifically asks about the *collision* of comets with Earth, making option A more precise. Scientists are investigating the *timing and circumstances* of these collisions.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, banda garaunu maa sthaniya prahari le ke bhumika khele?","The correct answer is **A: Uniiharu le FB banda garna agraha gare** (They urged the FBI to shut down the blockade).

The text states: ""Adhikariharu khatarako wishwasaniyatako barema anishchit bhae tapani maryland yatayat pradhikaranle **FBI ko agrahama band garyo**."" This translates to ""Even if there was uncertainty about the danger, the Maryland Transportation Authority shut down the blockade at the insistence of the FBI.""  The police (Adhikariharu) were urging the FBI to take action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uniiharu le banda garne nirnaya gare** (They decided to shut down the blockade): The text says the *Maryland Transportation Authority* made the decision, not the local police.
* **C: Uniiharu le sawari chalak lai arko bato tarfa nirdeshit gare** (They directed the drivers to an alternative route): While the police did direct motorcycle riders to alternative routes, this isn't the primary role mentioned in relation to the blockade itself.
* **D: Uniiharu le vaikalpik bato ma yatayat dhillai report gare** (They reported traffic congestion on alternative routes): The text mentions reporting congestion on alternative routes, but not as a direct action related to urging the FBI to shut down the blockade.



"
Banda ko samay ma tube pravesh dwaar lai ke bhayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti banda gariye (They were closed)**.

The passage states: ""Ti banda garye."" which translates to ""They were closed."" This directly answers the question of what happened to the tube entrances during the lockdown.
"
"Anucched anusar, photographer laai gaaadi le hirkaunu aghi ke bhaeko thiena?","The correct answer is **A: Photographer lai raajmarga prahari le bato pari firta jaana nirdeshan dieko thiyo.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Praharika anusar fotatografarlai thokkaune sawari chalakle aparadhik muddaharuko samana gurney sambhawana chhaina.""  Immediately before that, it says the officer ordered the photographer to turn around. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Photographer le afno gadi Sepulveda bolebhard ma park gareka thie:** The text says the photographer stopped his car *before* attempting to cross the road.
* **C: Photographer le prahari stop ko photo khiche:** The text says the photographer tried to take photos of the police stopping him, but it doesn't say he was successful.
* **D: Photographer le Bieber ko photo khichna safal bhae:** The text is about the photographer's interaction with the police and doesn't mention taking photos of Bieber.



"
Photographer laai gadi le hirkaaunu aghi ke garne prayas gardai thie?,"The correct answer is **B: Prahari stop ko photo lina (To take a photo of the officer stopping him)**.

The text states: ""key photographerle sepulveda bolebhardko arkopatti afno gadi roke ra sadak paar garnuaghi ra police stopko taswira khichne prayas gare"" which translates to ""the key photographer stopped his car and tried to take photos of the police stopping him.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sepulveda bolebhard maa park garna (To park in Sepulveda Boulevard):** While he did stop there, the text focuses on his attempt to photograph the officer.
* **C: Vyasta raajmaarga maa baato kaatna (To cut through a busy highway):**  The text says he stopped and tried to cross the road, not cut through a highway.
* **D: Prahari laai ajhai photo khichna anurodh garna (To request the officer not to take a photo):** The text says he was *trying* to take a photo *of* the officer.



"
Yea madhye kun wakya le virus sankraman pachhi rashtrapati ko avastha sahi ruple bataudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Unlaai sancho mahasush bhaeko chaina (He hasn't felt very well.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Rashtrapatiko awastha sthira bhae pani unlai kehi dinka lagi dharma alag rakhinechha."" (Even if the President's condition is stable, he will keep himself separated for a few days.)
* **Later, Arias says:** ""Jwaro ra ghati dukhaika bahek, maha dursanchar garera afno cam pura garnaka lagi swastha mahasus garchhu ra ramro awasthama chu."" (Except for a slight fever and pain, I feel healthy and am in good condition.)

The statement ""Unlaai sancho mahasush bhaeko chaina"" directly contradicts the later statement where Arias claims to feel healthy and in good condition, *except* for a slight fever.  The other options are either consistent with or not directly contradicted by the text. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, tala dieko madhye rashtrapati ko baare kun wakya sahi ho?","The correct answer is **A: Unlaai Jwaro aaeko chhaina (He hasn't had a fever).**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Jwaro ra ghati dukhaika bahek, maha dursanchar garera afno cam pura garnaka lagi swastha mahasus garchhu..."" which translates to ""Except for fever and severe pain, I feel healthy enough to recover from my illness and am in a good condition..."" This implies he *doesn't* have a fever.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uni kaiyau haptaa samma ghar mai rahane chhan (He is staying at home for several weeks):** The passage only mentions a few days of isolation.
* **C: Unii dursanchhar garna sakne awastha maa chhan (He is in a condition to spread infection):** The passage states he feels healthy enough to recover and doesn't mention the ability to spread infection.
* **D: Unlaai gambhir kisimko virus le sankraman gareko chha (He has been infected with a serious type of virus):** The passage doesn't specify the severity of the virus.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, tropical cyclone gonu kahile kamjor hune apeksha garieko chha?","The correct answer is **B: Jaba hawa ko gati 83 kilometer prati ghanta maa jharyo.**

The passage states: ""Ajko suruma, hawa 83 kimmy prati ghantako waripari thiyo ra yo kamjor rahirahane apeksha garieko thiyo.""  This translates to: ""Today in the morning, the wind was 83 kilometers per hour and it was expected to weaken.""
"
Tropical cyclone gonu charam bindu maa pugdaa hawa ko gati kati dherai thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kilometer prati ghanta**.

The text states: ""tropical cyclone gonu, 240 kilometer prati ghanta (149 mile prati ghanta) co nirantar hawasamma pugyo."" This directly translates to the cyclone reaching a continuous wind speed of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).  The question asks for the speed at its peak, which is 240 km/h.
"
Yea madhye kun chaahi karenia brevis ko viseshta maani daina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo bahukoshiya ho (It is multicellular)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the organism is **ekal koshikayukta** (unicellular).  This means it is *not* multicellular.
* The passage mentions several characteristics of this unicellular organism:
    * It's a marine animal.
    * It has a concentrated ability to digest.
    * It produces neurotoxins that can paralyze humans and fish.
    * It can be affected by air and pollutants.
* Option A is correct - the organism *is* a type of leule (which are unicellular organisms).
* Option B is correct - it *can* paralyze humans.
* Option D is correct - it *exists naturally*.

Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the provided text is that it is multicellular.
"
Tala die madhyeh karena brevis ke garna asamartha chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Maachha ko nashaa banda garna (Prevent fish from being intoxicated).**

Here's why:

The passage states that *dinoflagellate blooms* (Prakritik rupma hune ekal koshikayukta samudri jiwale hune rato chaal) produce neurotoxins that can cause poisoning in fish.  The passage also mentions that *high concentrations of antidote* usually prevent fish poisoning. Therefore, the core function of dinoflagellate blooms in relation to fish is to *cause* poisoning, not prevent it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jun sukai awasthamaa aafno sankhya wyaparik rupmaa badhauna (Increase population in a dormant state):** While some organisms might increase their population in a dormant state, the passage focuses on the blooms' effect on fish populations, not on their dormancy.
* **C: Pani lai asar garna (Affect water):**  The passage mentions the bloom is a ""red tide,"" indicating it *does* affect the water, but the main point isn't that it affects water generally.
* **D: Neurotoxin utpadan garna (Produce neurotoxins):** The passage states they *do* produce neurotoxins, but the question asks what they are *unable* to do.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, tala diekaa madhye kun ghatana felicia aandhi ko karan bhaeko hoina?","The correct answer is **D: Bato maa badhi aaunu (Flooding)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""Felicia mangalwarka dina wighatan hunubhanda aghadi ushna pradeshiya sankuchan hunale kamjor bhayo."" (Before Felicia weakened, a heatwave caused a local contraction.)
* **The paragraph also mentions:** ""Yasaka awasheshharule adhikansh tapuharuma warsha utpadan gare..."" (Its remnants produced rainfall in most areas...)
* **Finally:** ""Kehi warshaka sath aandhibehari ra lagatar chatyang pareko thiyo."" (For some years, there were storms and continuous thunderstorms.)

The paragraph explicitly links the weakening of the Felicia storm to a heatwave and then describes rainfall and thunderstorms. It doesn't mention flooding as a direct consequence of the Felicia storm.  The other options are all mentioned as events associated with the storm.



"
Felicia aandhi baare galat wakya kun ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Varsha sangai bijuli pani chamkeko thiyo** (Rain was accompanied by lightning).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Kehi varshaka sath aandhibehari ra lagatar chatyang pareko thiyo."" which translates to ""For some years, there were storms and continuous lightning."" It *doesn't* say that lightning accompanied *this* particular storm. 

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: warsha le Oahu laai faida garyo** (The rain benefited Oahu) - The text says the storm produced a lot of rainfall in most areas and caused no major damage, implying a benefit.
* **B: Yaslai shreni 4 ko aandhi maanu aghi ushna pradeshiya sankuchan ko rupmaa vargikaran garieko thiyo** (It was categorized as a Category 4 storm due to the heat island effect) - The text explicitly mentions the storm was categorized as a Category 4 due to the heat island effect weakening it.
* **C: Praaya taapu haru ma warsha bhayo** (Rain fell in almost all regions) - The text states that the remnants produced rainfall in most areas.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that is *not* supported by the provided text.



"
Tala dieko madhye kun wakya le 2009 ko Hungarian Grand Prix ko natija lai sahi rupmaa pratibimbit garchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Piquet Jr. le bijay praapt gare (Piquet Jr. won)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Alonsobhanda agadika carharu suraksha carmuni indhanka lagibhitra pasda, u pyaksamma pugera vijayi bhayo."" (Cars behind Alonso went into the safety car, and he managed to reach the finish line and win.)
* It also states: ""Pucate juniyarlai 2009 hangeri grand priksapachhi barkhasta gariyo."" (Piquet Jr. was subsequently dismissed after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.)

Therefore, the key fact about the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix is that Piquet Jr. won due to the safety car incident. Options A, C, and D are either incomplete or not the central point of the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix result."
Durghatana kahile bhaeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Piquet indhan ko laagi gaye pachhi**.

The text states: ""Alonsoko rokawatka karan pucate juniyarko sun 2008 ko singapurma bhaeko grand prixma durghatana bhaeko. Alonsobhanda agadika carharu suraksha carmuni indhanka lagibhitra pasda, u pyaksamma pugera vijayi bhayo. Pucate juniyarlai 2009 hangeri grand priksapachhi barkhasta gariyo.""

This translates to: ""Fernando Alonso's crash happened during the pit stop of the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix. Cars ahead of Alonso were able to get inside the safety car line, and he finished second. Piquet was demoted after the 2009 Hungary Grand Prix.""

The key phrase is ""Piquet was demoted *after* the 2009 Hungary Grand Prix.""  The text explains the crash *during* the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix and that Piquet's incident happened *before* that, causing the crash.  Therefore, the crash happened *after* Piquet went in for fuel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Alonso ko pit stop lagattai:**  While it happened during a pit stop, the text emphasizes the *cause* of the crash being related to Piquet's actions *before* Alonso's pit stop.
*   **B: Jaba aru gadi indhan bhardai thie:**  The text doesn't mention other cars fueling.
*   **C: Surakshya gadi aaunu bhanda agadi:** The text specifically says the safety car *came* after the crash, not before.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, tala diekaa madhye kaslai anweshak le vishwaas gare bhandaa kam samaya laagyo?","The correct answer is **D: Prajati haru ko bikaas (Evolution of species)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...yadyapi sthaniya Darwin Finch, Geospiza Fortes ra videshi Siudi Finch, Geospiza Konerostrisbichko prajananka karan yass prakriyama dherai samay lagne vishwas garieko thiyo."" 

This translates to: ""...although researchers believed that the evolution of local Darwin Finches, Geospiza Fortes, and foreign Siudi Finch, Geospiza Konerostrisbichko through reproduction would take a long time.""

Therefore, the researchers believed the *evolution* (bikaas) process would be slow, not the reporting or the differences between species.
"
Tala dieko madhye kun anweshak haru report garenan?,"Correct Answer: **B: Bikaas prakriyaa ko awadhi (Duration of the development process)**

Here's why:

The passage states that researchers from Princeton University and Uppsala University reported on the formation of new species in the Galapagos Islands. It also mentions that the development time of Darwin's Finches (Geospiza Fortes and Siudy Finch, Geospiza Konerostrisbichko) was thought to be lengthy. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Naya prajati kaha nirman bhaeko thiyo (Where new species were formed):** The passage explicitly states that the study reported on the formation of new species in the Galapagos Islands.
*   **C: Naya prajati ko naam (Name of new species):** The passage discusses the formation of new species, and the research likely involved naming them, though it doesn't directly state that the name is the focus of the report.
*   **D: Prajanan maa samlagna bhaekaa chara (Characters involved in reproduction):** The passage mentions Darwin's Finches and other species as examples.

The passage focuses on the **formation process** and how the research challenges the previous assumptions about the time it takes for these species to develop. Therefore, the duration of the development process is the information that the researchers reported on. The option ""B"" is the correct answer."
Cowparade kaha aayojana hune chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Bucharest sahar maa** (In Bucharest city).

The text states: ""Yo sahar june ra agastako bichma wishwako sabaibhanda thulo sarvajanik kala karyakram, Coupred ayojana gurney dakshin purvi europema pahilo hunechha."" which translates to ""This city will host the world's largest public cultural event, Coupred project, for the first time in Southeast Europe from June to August.""  The paragraph is describing Bucharest and its upcoming event.
"
Tala die madhye kun wakya le cowparade lai sahi rupmaa varnan garchha?,"Sahi answer ho **C: Yo ek kala sambandhi karyakram ho jun garmi maa dakshin purvi europe bhari aayojana garinchha.**

* **B:** ""Yaslai bucharest city hall le nirman gareko thiyo"" -  Yo ayojana ko asal pratikar ko varnan garnu chan.
* **D:** ""Sansarkai sabai bhandaa thulo sarvajanik kala karyakram ho"" - Yo thulo hunekhar, lakini varnan ko sahi rupma nahi garchha. 
"
Ke karan le rus le II-76 ko prayog banda garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ek durghatna (An accident)**.

The text clearly states: ""October 7 maa udan garda euta engine alaggio, jasma kunai chotpatak lagena. tyo durghatanapachhi rusle II-76s ko udan kehi samay pratibandhit garyo."" (On October 7th, an engine malfunction occurred during flight, causing no damage. After this accident, Russia temporarily banned the flight of II-76s.)

While the text mentions ""antarik sainikharudwara sanchalan bhairaheko thiyo"" (operated by airborne troops) and that the II-76 is a key component of the Russian and Soviet army, the direct cause for the temporary flight ban was the accident.
"
II-76 bhaneko ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: hawai jahaz (airplane)**.

The text explicitly states: ""1970 co dashakdekhi II-76 rusi ra sobhiyat duwai senako euta pramukh ghatak bhaeko cha..."" which translates to ""Since the 1970s, the II-76 has been a major component of the Russian and Soviet armed forces..."" and also mentions it's a type of aircraft that experienced a crash.
"
The Simpsons ko lekhakiya toli lai kasle niyukta gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

The text states: ""Sun 1989 maa unle brooks ra groningasanga da simpasanharu sirjana garna maddat gare ra uni karyakramko pahilo lekhan tolly niyukta garna jimmewar thee.""  This translates to: ""In 1989, she helped create The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening and was responsible for hiring the first writing staff."" Therefore, Groening (and Brooks) were involved in hiring the writing staff.
"
Fluke anusar kasle unlaai sakaratmak tippani ra hausala praaan gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Purush ra mahila dubai vyakti haru (Men and women together)**.

The text states: ""duwai mahila ra purushharule unilai pathai dherai sakaratmak tippani ra protsahanko karan uni yass n pugeki chin."" This translates to: ""When both the woman and man sent [her/him] and gave her/him a lot of positive feedback and encouragement, she/he did not give up.""  Therefore, it was *both* the man and the woman who provided the positive feedback and encouragement.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, kehi manis haru mahila le ke bare nabolun bhanne chahanthe?","The correct answer is **C: Mahila swasthya (Women's health)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that some men were hesitant to discuss women's health issues. The phrase ""Fluckle lekhe key mahilako swasthyako barema bolnabata mahilalai dabauna kehile gareka prayasharu asafal bhaeka thee"" translates to something like ""Attempts to pressure women to talk about women's health issues in writing were unsuccessful."" This indicates that the topic of women's health was a sensitive one for many.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Purush vyakti haru (Male individuals):** While the paragraph mentions men, it doesn't say that *all* men were hesitant. It focuses on the difficulty of *pressuring* women.
*   **B: Medical kharcha (Medical expenses):** The paragraph doesn't mention anything about medical expenses.
*   **D: Fluke:** ""Fluke"" refers to a parasitic infection, and while it's mentioned in the context, it's not the core issue of hesitation. The hesitation is about discussing women's health in general.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun graha pinda sabai bhanda gatishil chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage states: ""jahansamma hamilai thaha cha, tyahan ek matra grahako nikaya chha jasle titenbhanda badhi gatishilta dekhaunchha ra yasako name prithvi ho"" which translates to ""As far as we know, there is only one planetary system that shows more activity than Earth, and its name is Titan.""

Therefore, Titan is described as the most active planetary system mentioned in the passage. While the passage also mentions Earth, it is stated that Titan is *more* active.
"
Kun graha pinda maa paaradarshi taral padaartha bhaeka kholaa ra taal pahichaan garieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...tyahan ek matra grahako nikaya chha jasle titenbhanda badhi gatishilta dekhaunchha ra yasako name prithvi ho."" This translates to ""...there is only one planet that shows more activity than Earth, and its name is Titan.""

Stophan is describing Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has a dense atmosphere and liquid methane lakes and rivers on its surface, making it the only celestial body other than Earth known to have stable surface bodies of liquid.  The passage specifically mentions the ability to ""see the kankadharu wa gum"" (which refers to lakes and rivers) if one were to hover above it.

Therefore, Titan is the answer.
"
Yea madhye kun nishkarsha pwaankha patta laageko karanle gariekaa hoinan?,"The correct answer is **B: Pwaankha udaan ko laagi prayog bhaekaa thienan bhanne bujhai (The understanding that wings were used for flight)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that scientists suggest the wings were *not* initially developed for flight. They propose that the barbs and barbules (feathers) evolved first, and the wings developed later. 
* The passage discusses the color of the wings, the evolution of wings, and the possibility of wings being used for thermoregulation or display. 
* Option B directly contradicts the information presented in the passage.

Therefore, the conclusion that wings were used for flight is *not* supported by the passage.
"
Dinosaur ko pwaankha maa ke thiena?,"The correct answer is **B: Rachis**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dinosarko pankhetama rachis bhanine soft ramrosanga wiksit nabhae pani barbs ra barbules namak pankhetaka any gunharu hune bhaekale khojkartaharule rachis sambhawatah yea dui gunharubhanda pachhi wiksit bhaeko hunu parchha bhane kurako n nikaleka chan.""

This means that while dinosaurs might not have had a rachis (the central support structure), they likely had other features like barbs and barbules.  The passage implies rachis wasn't present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Barbules:** The passage suggests dinosaurs *did* have barbs and barbules.
* **C: wayaska pwaankha (adult wings):** The passage says the wing structure of a juvenile dinosaur is different from an adult dinosaur.
* **D: Fika rang ko talako bhag (pale colored underside):** The passage mentions the underside color but doesn't say it was absent.



"
Tala die madhye ZMapp ko bare maa kun wakya sahi hoina?,"Sahi answer **B: Yasle bhaekaa sankraman haru ko upachar garna sakchha tara mrityu ko rokthaam garna sakdaina** हो।

यहाँ किन यो answer sahi छैन भन्ने explanation छ:

* **ZMapp (Monoclonal Antibody Cocktail)** antibody हरुले बनाइएको हुन्छ। (Option A सही छ)
* ZMapp ले काका संक्रमाण (Ebola virus infection) को उपचार गर्न सक्छ। (Option B को सुरुको भाग सही छ)
* ZMapp PALM अध्ययनमा नियंत्रण (control) को रूपमा प्रयोग भएको थियो। (Option C सही छ)
* अध्ययनहरूले देखाएका छन् कि यसको फाइदा सुरुमा सोचेभन्दा कम हुन्छ। (Option D सही छ)

यसकारण, ZMapp का फाइदा सुरुमा सोचेभन्दा कम हुन्छ भन्ने कुरा गलत छैन, तर यसले मृत्युको रोकथाम गर्न सक्दैन भन्ने कुरा गलत छ। ZMapp ले Ebola संक्रमणमा मृत्यु दर कम गर्न भूमिका खेल्ने सम्भावना देखाएको छ।

Therefore, option B is the incorrect statement about ZMapp."
Tala madhye kun wakyale PALM parikshan lai sahi rupma varnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Euta niyantrak ausadhi aru tin upachar haru sanga tulanaa garieko thiyo, jun madhy ek zmapp thiyo.**

Here's why:

* **PALM परीक्षण (trial) को वर्णन:** The question asks which sentence correctly describes the PALM trial. The passage explicitly states that in the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control and compared to three other treatments.  Option B accurately reflects this setup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adhyan haru le dekhaekaa chhan ki yasko faida suru maa soche bhanda badhi huncha (Studies have shown that its benefit is greater than initially thought):** While the passage mentions potential benefits, it doesn't focus on this specifically. It highlights the lack of a clear, effective treatment and the trial's setup.
* **C: ZMapp parikshan ko aadharbhut rupma prayog garieko thiyo (ZMapp was used as a basic trial):**  The passage describes ZMapp as a *control* in the trial, not a basic trial in itself.
* **D: Yo vidhyaman awastha ko upachar garna prabhavkaari hune dekhieko thiyo (It seemed effective in treating the existing condition):** The passage emphasizes that there isn't a clear, effective treatment *currently*.  The PALM trial was designed to *find* an effective treatment, not because one was already known to be effective.



"
Anweshak harule naya chip kaha sabai bhanda mahatwapurna hune bichar garekaa chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Kam aaya bhaekaa muluk haru (Less developed countries)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dhani deshharuko tulanama come aya bhaeka deshharuma cancer, kshayarog, hiv ra maleriako pahichan lagauna sakha bhanera stan cancer jasta rogharubata baanchne darr adha hune pramukh anweshakharuko bhanai cha."" This translates to: ""Compared to developed countries, the main researchers say that the ability to detect cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria in less developed countries can halve the fear of dying from diseases like Stanford cancer.""
"
Diagnostic upakaran ko nirmaan garna kun bidhi ko prayog garine chha?,"Correct answer is **C: Print garna milne chip haru**.

The passage states: ""chip june manak inkjet printerharu prayog garera sambhawatah lagbhag ek americi centko lagatma nirman garna sakinchha."" This translates to: ""It may be possible to build it for about the cost of one American cent using standard inkjet printers and printable chips.""

Therefore, the diagnostic tool is built using printable chips.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, lobate scarps ko baare maa kun vakhya sahi hoina?","The correct answer is **D: Yea chandrama ko sataha maa dherai bhetieka thienan (There are many impacts on the surface of the moon.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that lobate scarps are formed due to the moon's gradual weakening and shrinking.** This implies the surface isn't covered in *many* impacts, but rather shows evidence of this gradual process. 
* **Option A: Tin ko nirman garne ghatana haru bharkharai bhaeka thie (The events that formed them were significant)** - This aligns with the idea that lobate scarps are a result of substantial geological activity.
* **Option B: Uniharuko upasthiti le chandrama maa bhaugolik gatiwidhi ko kami chhaina (Their presence does not indicate a lack of geological activity on the moon)** - This is directly contradicted by the passage, which uses lobate scarps as evidence *against* the idea that the moon is geologically inactive.
* **Option C: Yo chandrama ko sankuchan ko natija ho (This is a result of the moon's contraction)** - This is explicitly stated in the passage.

Therefore, the statement that contradicts the passage is that there are *many* impacts on the moon's surface. The passage implies the opposite - that the features seen (like lobate scarps) indicate a process of shrinking and weakening."
"Anuchhed anusar, landform sambandhi kun siddhanta le chandrama maa bhaugolik gatiwidhi hune sanket garchha?","The correct answer is **C: Chandrama ko satahama kewal nyunatam matra maa landform haru rahekaa chhan (On the surface of the moon, only minimal landforms remain.)**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the lunar landforms are ""scars"" and that the moon is gradually weakening.
* It also mentions that these scars are minimal, suggesting erosion and geological activity have occurred.
* This indicates that the moon *has* experienced geological activity, as the landforms haven't remained unchanged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chandrama bistarai sankuchit hudai chha (The moon is gradually shrinking):** While the passage says the moon is weakening, it doesn't directly link this to geological activity. Shrinking could be due to other factors.
* **B: Ti landform haru dherai agadi banekaa thie (Those landforms were formed a long time ago):** This is possible, but the passage focuses on the *current* state of the landforms and the implications for geological activity.
* **D: Landform haru bharkharai matra baneka thie (Landforms were formed entirely by impact):** The passage rejects the idea that the moon is geologically inactive, implying impact alone couldn't explain the current state.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, abhiyogko bela sama ke kura hune chhaina?","The correct answer is **A: Aru tippani (Other comments)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""समग्र अभियोजका लागि जिम्माएबर क्राउन अफिसले, पत्रकारहरुलाई संकेत गरेको छ के अबियोगको बेला सम्म कुनै टिप्पणी गर्ने छैन।"" which translates to: ""The Crown Office, responsible for the entire prosecution, has signaled to the journalists that there will be no comments until the time of the charges."" This means no *other* comments will be made until the charges are brought.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Photo prakashan (Photo publication):** The passage mentions the photo was published, but the question asks what *isn't* done.
* **C: Pratakshya darshi ko praman bare bahas (Discussion about direct witness evidence):** The passage says there's no direct witness evidence, but it doesn't say there's been a discussion about it.
* **D: Lekh prakashan (Article publication):** The passage mentions Pamela Ferguson's article, but the question asks what *isn't* done.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that no *other* comments will be made until the charges are brought.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, kun sealer haru kaa lagi vidhyaman samasya hoina?","The correct answer is **D: Paglieko hiun (Melted ice)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the problem with ice packs is due to **""barafko matra ra motai vigat 15 warshama sillerska lagi sabaibhanda kharab ho""** which translates to ""the amount and thickness of ice have been worse for coolers in the last 15 years.""  This implies the *amount* and *thickness* of ice are the issues.
* The passage specifically says the problem is that the ice packs are not maintaining the desired temperature, and that the amount and thickness are the problem.
*  **Paglieko hiun (Melted ice)** is a direct consequence of the amount and thickness being incorrect. If the ice melts too quickly, it's a result of an issue with the amount or thickness.  Therefore, the issue isn't the melted ice itself.
* **Charam mausami awastha (Extreme weather conditions)** is a contributing factor to the problem, but it's not the *problem* itself.
* **Hiun ko matra (Amount of ice)** and **Hiun ko motai (Thickness of ice)** are directly mentioned as the problematic factors.



Therefore, melted ice is not the primary issue the passage is addressing. The problem lies in the ice pack's ability to maintain its intended properties due to incorrect amount and thickness.



"
"Hiun baahek, uddar karya lai kele asar gariraheko chha?","The correct answer is **A: Aapurti ko abhav (Lack of hydration)**.

Here's why:

* The first paragraph states that the lack of water (barafka sathasathai - lack of ice/water) is hindering the proper functioning of the water purifier.
* The second paragraph asks what else is affecting the water purifier's performance *besides* the lack of ice.
* The context directly links the lack of ice/water to the problem.  While the weather *could* be a factor, the text emphasizes the lack of ice as the primary issue. The other options (cooperation, sealers) aren't explicitly mentioned as causing the problem.

Therefore, the answer is lack of hydration.
"
Roberts le kun biswas ko pramarikaran garna bata pachhi hate?,"The correct answer is **B: sarvochcha adalat ko nirantar aadesh haru ko mahatwa** (The importance of consistent rulings of the Supreme Court).

Here's why:

The passage states that Roberts, while acknowledging *Roe v. Wade* as a ""national precedent,"" emphasized the importance of the Supreme Court's *consistent rulings*. He linked this to his belief in the significance of the Court's ongoing decisions. The text also mentions his belief in the right to privacy as being crucial to the *Roe v. Wade* decision, but the central point he emphasized *after* acknowledging the precedent was the importance of the Court's consistency.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Muddha haru ko bahas garne naitiktaa** (The ethics of debating issues): While morality is a factor, the passage focuses on his emphasis on judicial consistency, not just the ethical debate surrounding the issue.
*   **C: Jiwan ko suruwat** (The beginning of life): Roberts doesn't explicitly state a belief in *when* life begins as the core of his position. He acknowledges the right to privacy as a factor in *Roe v. Wade* but doesn't center his argument on that specific point.
*   **D: Gopaniyata ko adhikar** (The right to privacy): While he connects the *Roe v. Wade* decision to the right to privacy, his main focus isn't solely on that right, but on the importance of the Supreme Court's consistent rulings related to privacy.

Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the key takeaway from the passage regarding Roberts's beliefs.
"
Roberts le kun bisay bahas garna anaitik hune mahasus gare?,"The correct answer is **C: Nihit gopaniyata ko adhikaar (The right to privacy)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Roberts ""pushti gare key row nirnaya nirbhar bhaeko gopaniyatako nihit adhikarma uni vishwas gardachan."" This translates to ""supported the key that the Roe decision depended on the inherent right to privacy.""  The text emphasizes that Roberts believed the Roe v Wade decision relied on the right to privacy.

While the other options are related, they are not the *primary* subject of Roberts' ethical concern:

*   **A: sarvochcha adalat kaa adesh haru (Supreme Court orders):**  While Roberts deals with Supreme Court orders, the passage focuses on the *reasoning* behind the Roe v Wade decision.
*   **B: Roe viru wade ko nirnay (The Roe v. Wade decision):** The passage discusses Roe v Wade *as an example* of a decision reliant on the right to privacy. It's not the central issue Roberts was ethically troubled by.
*   **D: Mudda kaa vivaran haru (Details of the issue):** The passage isn't concerned with the factual details of the issue, but with the ethical framework.



"
Prakash kaa dui kiran haru kaha chamkirahekaa chan?,"The correct answer is **A: Aakash tarfa (Towards the sky)**.

The text states: ""Ratbhar akashatirko binduma prakashka dui bimharu lagaieka thee,"" which translates to ""Two rays of light were placed at a point in the dark sky.""
"
"Anuchhed anusar, ukta sthan maa naya gagan chumbi bhawan haru kahile banne chhan?","The correct answer is **D: Nirman karya jari chha (Construction work is ongoing)**.

The passage states: ""Kshetrama yatayat kendra ra madhya bhagma smarak parksahit naya paanch gaganchumbi bhawanharuko nirman karya zari raheko cha."" This translates to ""Construction work of five new skyscrapers with a traffic center and memorial park in the center and middle area is currently underway.""

Therefore, the skyscrapers are not yet built, only under construction. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Din ko bich maa (In the middle of the day):** The passage doesn't specify a time of completion.
*   **B: Bihan 8:46 baje (8:46 AM):** This is a specific time mentioned in the passage but refers to when the speaker felt a sense of awe, not the completion time of the buildings.
*   **C: Raat ratai (At night):** The passage doesn't mention anything about night construction or completion.



"
Kun jankaari le janauchha ki “saat didibahiniharu” gufa hun bhanera?,"The correct answer is **A: Tapkram maa bhinnata (Temperature differences)**.

The text states: ""Infrared taswirharule ratka tapakram bhinnataharu ra dinle tiniharu sambhawatah gufaharu hun bhane dekhaunchha."" which translates to ""Infrared images show significant temperature differences, and these are likely caves."" This directly links the temperature differences (thermal variations) to the possibility of the formations being caves.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gufa ko praveshdwar ko wyas (Diameter of the cave entrance):** While the size is mentioned, it doesn't *identify* them as caves.
* **C: Bhaugolik sarwekshan (Geological survey):** The USGS survey provides context, but it's the *temperature differences* detected by infrared imaging that suggests the caves.
* **D: Prithvi kaa gufa haruko photo (Photo of Earth's caves):** The text refers to *infrared images*, not photos of existing caves.



"
“Saat didibahiniharu” ko thermal kriyakalap kasari awalokan garinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Infrared chitra haru (Infrared images)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Infrared taswirharule ratka tapakram bhinnataharu ra dinle tiniharu sambhawatah gufaharu hun bhane dekhaunchha"" which translates to ""Infrared images reveal temperature differences and if observed, they might be caves.""

Therefore, infrared images are the way their thermal activity is observed.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, aropit bare kun wakya sahi hoina?","The correct answer is **D: U ghaite bhaena (He didn't get injured)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""bum wishfotbata ghaite banaepachhi pakrau garieko thiyo"" which translates to ""He was arrested after being injured from the blast."" 
* **Option D claims:** ""U ghaite bhaena"" which translates to ""He didn't get injured."" This directly contradicts the information given in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Usle akraman ko samaya maa gadi ko prayog garyo (He used a car during the attack):** The text explicitly states that the explosive materials were placed in a car (""teen-pangre sawarilai bhidma lagyo"" - placed in a three-wheeled vehicle).  Therefore, he used a car.
* **B: Uslaai bisfotak padartha padkaeko aarop chha (He is accused of planting explosive materials):** The text says ""wisfotak padarthaharu bhaeko"" - containing explosive materials. This implies he's accused of planting them.
* **C: Usko jatiyata bare adhikaari haru laai thaha chha (Authorities know about his ethnicity):** The text mentions, ""... tathapi uniharulai thaha chhaina key uni uighur jatiya samuhako ek sadasya hun"" - ""...but authorities don't know if he is a member of the Uyghur ethnic group."" This implies authorities *don't* know. However, the question asks which statement is *not* true. The statement that authorities don't know *if* he's Uyghur is not the same as saying they *do* know. Therefore, option C is the incorrect statement.

Therefore, **D** is the only statement that is definitively false according to the provided text."
Aakraman baare adhikaari harule kun jaankaari ko pusti garekaa chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Kohi sahayogi haruko pahichaan (Identification of accomplices)**.

Here's why:

* The text states the suspect is being questioned and was apprehended *after* a suspected explosion. This implies there might be others involved.
* The text mentions the suspect's identity is currently unknown to authorities. 
* While the suspect's ethnicity (Uighur) is mentioned, it's only a possibility and not confirmed by authorities.
* The suspect's name and rank are unknown, and the text explicitly says ""uniharulai thaha chhaina key uni uighur jatiya samuhako ek sadasya hun"" which translates to ""they don't know if he is a member of the Uighur ethnic group.""

Therefore, the authorities are primarily focused on identifying any accomplices.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Aaropit ko jaatiyata (Accused's ethnicity):** While mentioned, it's not a confirmed fact, and the authorities don't yet have definitive information.
* **C: Aakraman pachaadi ko kaaran (Cause of the attack):** The text doesn't provide any information about the motive behind the explosion.
* **D: Aaropit ko naam ra thar (Accused's name and rank):**  The text explicitly states that the suspect's name and rank are unknown to authorities.



"
Ellis park maa kun toli le match khelne chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: All blacks ra australia**.

The text states: ""Springboxle australiasanga yass shringkhalako antim khel arko hapta johannesburgko alys parkma khelne bhaniyeko cha."" (Springboks will play the final match of this series against Australia next week at Johannesburg's Ellis Park.)

Therefore, the match will be between the All Blacks and Australia at Ellis Park.
"
Springboks le arko match kaha khelne chhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Springboksle australiasanga yass shringkhalako antim khel arko hapta johannesburgko alys parkma khelne bhaniyeko cha."" which translates to ""Springboks will play the final match of this series against Australia next week at Johannesburg's Alys Park.""
"
Mission ko samaya maa antariksha station le kasto samasyaa ko saamana garyo?,"Correct answer is **B: Gyroscope raakhne**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Antariksha station missionma gyroscope haraeka bhae pani stationle spacewakko antim samayasamma afno manovritti kayam rakhyo."" This translates to: ""Even if the gyroscope failed during the space station mission, the station maintained its maneuverability until the last moment.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Thruster baat sahi duri kaayam raakhne (Maintaining the correct distance from thrusters):** The passage mentions the thrusters in the context of the Chiao and Sharipov maneuvers, *not* as a primary issue for this particular mission.
* **C: Jet ko sakriyata (Activation of jets):** While jets were used to bring the station back to normal, the core problem was the gyroscope.
* **D: Samanya uchai lai puna prapta garne (Regaining normal altitude):** The passage implies the station was already at a normal altitude and the issue was with its orientation/maneuvering.

Therefore, the central problem the station faced was maintaining its orientation and maneuverability, which is directly related to the gyroscope.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, antarikshya station ko mission ke laxya thiyo?","The correct answer is **A: Haraaeko gyroscope paaune (Finding the lost gyroscope)**.

The paragraph states that the mission's aim was to keep the station's orientation stable after a gyroscope went missing.  The other options describe actions taken *because* of the gyroscope issue, not the mission's primary goal.
"
Tala die madhye mudda baare kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukta mudda AOL ko mukhya kaarayala bhaeko rajyamaa chalaieko thiyo (The issue was filed in the country where AOL's main office is located.)**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Yo agrani internet sewa sewa pradayak eoelko ghar hunale bharjiniyama mudda chalaieko thiyo."" (This issue was filed because the leading internet service provider's house was flooded/inundated.)  It does *not* mention where AOL's main office is located.
* **The other options are supported by the text:**
    * **B: Abhiyog lagaaiyo (An accusation was made):** The text says a complaint was filed.
    * **C: Mudda maa spam email sambandhi vidhaan ko prayog garieko thiyo (The law regarding spam emails was used in the issue):**  The text explicitly mentions the use of the 2003 law to block spam.
    * **D: AOL laai mudda lagaaieko thiyo (A complaint was filed against AOL):** The text clearly states that the complaint was filed against AOL.



Therefore, option A is the only statement not directly supported by the provided text.



"
Tala dieko wakya madhye kunle mudda laai sahi rupmaa varnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL maathi apratyashit vitawaran sambandhi mudda lagaaieko thiyo (AOL had raised an issue regarding unsolicited distribution)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Yo agrani internet sewa pradayak eoelko ghar hunale bharjiniyama mudda chalaieko thiyo."" This translates to ""Because a leading internet service provider had a home, they raised an issue regarding unsolicited distribution.""  ""Apratyashit vitawaran"" directly means unsolicited distribution, and it refers to spam.  AOL is the ""leading internet service provider"" mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Mudda maa dui mukhya internet sewa pradayak samlagna thie (Two major internet service providers were involved in the issue).**  The passage only mentions AOL, not two providers.
* **C: Mudda 2003 maa lagaaieko thiyo (The issue was raised in 2003).** While the law was enacted in 2003, the passage doesn't directly state when AOL raised the issue. It implies the issue was related to the application of the 2003 law, but not necessarily *raised* in that year.
* **D: AOL mudda abhiyog ko surwaat gareko thiyo (AOL started the accusation).** The passage doesn't say AOL started an accusation. It says they *raised an issue*. ""Issue"" is a broader term than ""accusation"".



Therefore, option A best reflects the issue described in the passage.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, Vidal le tin season aghi kun club baata khelna suru gareka thie?","The correct answer is **C: Barça**.

Here's why:

* The question asks about the club Vidal started playing for **three seasons ago**.
* The text says ""Vidal le tin season aghi Catalan- capital gaepachhibata, bhidalle clubka lagi 49 khelharu kheleka thiye."" This translates to ""Vidal played 49 matches for the club after moving from the Catalan capital three seasons ago.""
* ""Catalan capital"" refers to Barcelona.
* ""Bhidalle clubka lagi"" means ""for the club.""
* ""Bara"" (Barça) is a common abbreviation for FC Barcelona.

Therefore, Vidal started playing for Barça three seasons ago.
"
Vidal le Barca kaa laagig kati khel kheleka chhan?,"The correct answer is **B: 39**.

Here's why:

The question asks how many games Vidal played for Barca. The text states: ""...Catalan- capital gaepachhibata, bhidalle clubka lagi 49 khelharu kheleka thiye."" This translates to ""...from the Catalan capital, he played 49 games for the club.""

However, the question itself is ""Vidal le Barca kaa laagig kati khel kheleka chhan?"" which translates to ""How many games did Vidal play for Barca?"". The provided text in the question says Vidal played **39 games** for Barca, it does not say 49 games. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **39**.
"
Match maa virodhi toli kun thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text states: ""aitbar bolonia viruddha yojana garieko khel aghadi uni toliko hotelma nai baseka thee."" which translates to ""Before the match planned against Bologna, he was only staying at the hotel.""
"
Jarque kina hotel maa basekaa thie?,"The best answer is **C: Unko aitabar match thiyo (He had a match against Bologna)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""aitbar bolonia viruddha yojana garieko khel aghadi uni toliko hotelma nai baseka thee.""  This translates to ""Before the planned match against Bologna, he was only staying in the hotel.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Unko abhyas thiyo (He had practice):** While he *was* doing pre-season practice, the passage emphasizes the match against Bologna specifically.
* **B: Unko pre-season baithak thiyo (He had a pre-season meeting):** The passage doesn't mention a meeting.
* **D: Uni Bolonia sanga prasikshan gardai thie (He was practicing with Bologna):** The passage says he had a *match* against Bologna, not that he was practicing *with* them.

Therefore, the most direct and accurate reason he was staying in the hotel is because he was preparing for the match against Bologna.
"
Jakarta bhubhautiki agency le kina chetawani jaari garena?,"Correct answer is **D: Bhukampa ko awashyak pariman pugena**

The passage explicitly states: ""jakarta bhubhautiki agencyka anusar bhukampale 6.5 parimanko awashyakta pura nagarekale sunamiko chetawani zari garine chhaina."" This translates to: ""According to the Jakarta Geological Agency, a tsunami warning was not issued because the earthquake's magnitude did not reach the required 6.5.""

Therefore, the reason for not issuing the warning was that the earthquake wasn't strong enough to trigger a tsunami.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, bhukampa le ke garyo?","The correct answer is **A: Daraaeka sthaaniya haru (Scared locals)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that even though a tsunami warning wasn't issued and the earthquake magnitude wasn't high enough to trigger one, people *still* evacuated their homes and businesses. This indicates they were scared and took preventative action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sunami ko jokhim (Tsunami risk):** The paragraph explicitly states a tsunami warning was *not* issued.
* **C: Chetawani jaari gariyo (Warning was issued):** The paragraph says a tsunami warning was *not* issued.
* **D: 6.5 pariman (Magnitude of 6.5):** While the paragraph mentions the magnitude, it's the *lack* of a tsunami warning despite the magnitude that's significant, not the magnitude itself.
"
Yea madhye kunle surya ra aru sabai taraa haruko kriyakalap laai utprerit garchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: Ujyaalopana, Rossy sankhyaa ra parikramaa**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""pranalima sabai taraharuko kriyaklap uniharuko ujyalopan, parikramanle chalit bhaeko pae, any kehile hoina.""  This translates to ""The processes of all stars are driven by their luminosity, rotation, and revolution; nothing else.""
* **Luminosity (Ujyaalopana):**  The passage explicitly mentions luminosity as a driving force.
* **Rotation (Parikraman):** The passage explicitly mentions rotation as a driving force.
* **Rossy Number (Rossy sankhyaa):**  The passage mentions the Rossy number in the context of determining the number of solar flares related to plasma flows.  While not directly stated as a primary driver, it's linked to the overall activity and behavior of stars.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ujyaalopana ra plasma ko bahaav (Luminosity and plasma flow):** While plasma flow is *related* to luminosity and flares, the passage states luminosity, rotation, and revolution are the primary drivers.  Plasma flow is a *consequence* of these other factors.
* **B: Rossy sankhyaa, parikramaa ra chumbakiya reversal (Rossy number, rotation, and magnetic reversal):** Magnetic reversals are important, but not directly mentioned as a primary driver in the passage. The passage links the Rossy number to plasma flows and flare frequency, not a fundamental driving force.
* **C: Parikrama ra ujyaalopana (Rotation and luminosity):** This option misses the crucial role of the Rossy number and the overall revolution.



Therefore, **D** best encapsulates the primary drivers of stellar activity according to the passage."
Taaraa ko rossby sankhyaa kasari nikaalinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ujyaalopana ra parikramaa (Ujyalopan ra parikraman)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pranalima sabai taraharuko kriyaklap uniharuko ujyalopan, parikramanle chalit bhaeko pae, any kehile hoina."" This translates to: ""The systems of all stars are driven by their luminosity and rotation, nothing else.""

Therefore, the Rossby number (Taaraa ko rossby sankhyaa) is calculated based on a star's luminosity (ujyalopan) and rotation (parikraman). The other options are not mentioned or relevant to how the Rossby number is determined according to the provided text.
"
Sarwekshan gare madhye kati pratishat manis le Australia turunta ganatantra banne maa samarthan gare?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 pratishat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Janamatka atyadhik parinamharuma, sarwekshan garieka **29 pratishatle sambhawa bhaesamma chhito astrelia ganatantra hunuparne vishwas garchhan**...""

This translates to: ""In the most significant outcome of the survey, **29 percent believed that Australia would soon become a democracy**...""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 31 pratishat** refers to the percentage who believe Australia will *never* become a democracy.
* **C: 8 pratishat** is the increase in those who oppose Australian becoming a democracy.
* **D: 34 pratishat** is the percentage who believe Queen Elizabeth II will be Australia's last monarch.



"
Julie Gillard ko anusar Australia kahile ganatantra bannu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Rani Elizabeth dritiya ko sasan pachhi**.

The passage states: ""Karyawahak pradhanmantri Julia Gillardle 2010 co sanghiya chunawako abhiyanko awadhima dabi garnubhayo key uhaanle quin elizabeth dwitiyako shasanko antyama astrelia ganatantra banne vishwas garnubhaeko thiyo."" This translates to ""Executive Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia would become a democracy after Queen Elizabeth II's reign.""
"
Kun sanstha kaanuni anusandhan muni raheko chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Komen foundation**.

The question states that the Komen Foundation has adopted a new rule that prevents legal research organizations from receiving grants or funding. The provided text details an investigation into how the organization, run by Representative Cliff Sterns, spends and reports funds, and whether the Komen Foundation's new rule has rendered designated grantees ineligible.

Therefore, the Komen Foundation is the organization under scrutiny and the one whose actions are the subject of the question.
"
Cliff stearns kun samiti kaa pramukh hun?,"The correct answer is **A: Samsadiya urjaa tatha banijya samiti (Present Energy and Commerce Committee)**.

The text states: ""Pratinidhi Cliff Sternsdwara sanchalit yasako rakam suniyojit abhibhawaktwale kasari kharcha garchha ra report garchha bhannema vicharadhin anusandhanle garda komenko nitile suniyojit abhibhawakatwalai ayogya banayo.

This translates to: ""Representative Cliff Sternsdwara is leading this, and the investigation is examining how the funds of the planned supervisor are spent and reported.  Due to Komen's policy, the planned supervisor has been deemed ineligible. Sternsle, as the chairman of the observation and research committee, is investigating whether the planned supervisor's role has fallen short of the fund's expectations. This is under the umbrella of the energy and commerce committee of the June session.""

Therefore, Cliff Sternsdwara is the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, Swiss mahila laai ke bhaena?","The correct answer is **A: Unko chorieko saamaan bhetiyo (They received their stolen items).**

The passage states: ""hamile swiss mahilalai balatkar gurney paanch wyaktiharulai pakreka chhaun ra unko mobile ra laptop farkaeka chhaun."" which translates to ""We have arrested five individuals who raped Swiss women and their mobile and laptop have been recovered."" This indicates the stolen items (mobile and laptop) were returned to the women.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Unko mrityu bhayo (They died):** The passage doesn't mention the death of the Swiss women.
* **C: Unlaai 5 jana le youn durvyavahar gare (Five people behaved inappropriately with them):** While the passage mentions the individuals who arrested, it is not referring to the inappropriate behavior.
* **D: Unko phone ra laptop chori bhayo (Their phone and laptop were stolen):** The passage states that the items were *stolen from* the women, not that they were stolen *to* the women. The current situation is that the stolen items have been recovered.



"
2007 maa kun company lai taiwan digo puraskar pradan gariyo?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The text clearly states: ""Tar sun 2007 maa ASUSlai ganatantra chainaka karyakari yuandwara taiwan digo puraskar pradan garepachhi..."" which translates to ""But then in 2007, ASUS was awarded the Taiwan Excellence Award by an independent committee...""
"
ASUS Eee PC bhaneko ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: laptop**.

The text explicitly states ""asus e pc, 2007 taipei it mahinama jaldobaldo vishaya banna pugyo"" which translates to ""asus e pc, in 2007 in Taipei IT month, quickly became a popular topic.""  The context clearly positions it as a computer.  The following sentence mentions ""laptop computerka u bazar amul ruple farak ra parivartan hunechha"" which translates to ""the market also saw significant price differences and changes in laptop computers."" This further confirms it's a laptop.
"
Haraeko hulaki kagjaat haru ko lagi ko jimmewaar thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Hulaki karmachari (Hulak karyachari - meaning printing office staff)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the printing office (hulak karyalayale) is responsible for the lost New Year's cards. The office apologized to the public and media, indicating their responsibility for the issue. Therefore, the printing office staff (hulaki karmachari) is the one accountable for the lost cards.
"
Anuchhed anusar haraaeka kaagjaat ko laagi kasle kshyama maage?,"Correct answer is **D: Obanazawa hulak karyalaya**.

The passage states: ""...hulak karyalayale janata ra midiasamu afno mafi zari garyo"" which translates to ""...the Obanazawa municipal hall apologized to the public and the media."" Therefore, the municipal hall is requesting forgiveness for the missing papers.
"
Del potro le aafno kaadh ko vishay kahile sambodhan garnu parchha?,"Correct answer is **B: Pahilo tai break agaadi**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pahilo set maa pratyek sewa rakhera murele tai breakma pahilo set gumae."" This means Murele lost the first set.  Then it says, ""Dell potrole dosro setma suruwati faida lieko thiyo, tar yasalai pani 6-6 maa pugepachhi tai break chahieko thiyo.""  This indicates that Dell Potrole had a slight lead in the second set, but they both reached a tie at 6-6, and *then* a break was needed.  Therefore, the break occurred *before* the third set.

So, the answer is B.
"
Pahilo tai break ko natijaa ke thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Murray pahilo set maa haare**

The passage states: ""Dell potrole dosro setma suruwati faida lieko thiyo, tar yasalai pani 6-6 maa pugepachhi tai break chahieko thiyo. Potrole yo vinduma afno kandhama upchar prapta gare tar khelma farkan saksham bhaye.""

This translates to: ""Dell Potrole had an initial advantage in the second set, but even reached 6-6, after which a break was needed. Potrole received treatment for his injury and was able to return to the game.""

The first break happened when the score was 6-6 in the second set, and Murray lost that break. Therefore, Murray lost the first set.
"
"Anuchhed maa ullekh bhae anusar, ko visesh gari virami ko samparka maa aekaa thie?","The correct answer is **B: Baalbaalika (Children)**.

The passage states: ""kehi vidyalaya umerka bachchaharu biramisangko sampark bhaeko bhanera chinaieko cha bhanera az hamile patta lagayaun."" This translates to: ""We have received reports that some school-aged children have been in contact with the enemy.""  Therefore, the children are the ones mentioned to have been in contact with the enemy.
"
"anuchhed anusar, safltapurak accordian bajauna kun kuralai sahi sallaha maanidaina?","The correct answer is **A: thap awaz ko laagi, ajha jod sanga key thichhnuhos** (for a good sound, don't press the keys firmly).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yo tarikale, tapain sambhav bhayesamma cum thaknuhunechha. Yaad garnuhos pianoma jasto atirikta awajko lagi kunjiharulai dherai balle thichnu awashyak chhaina.""  (This way, you'll become tired. Remember, just like a piano, you don't need to press the keys hard for extra sound.)

Option A directly contradicts this advice. The passage says *don't* press the keys firmly for extra sound.  Option A says *don't* press the keys firmly for a good sound, which implies the opposite of what the passage suggests.

Let's look at why the other options *are* aligned with the passage:

*   **B: tapai ko sahanshakti bachauna anawashyak chaalharu lai nyunatam rakhnuhos** (minimize unnecessary movements to save your stamina): The passage advocates for minimizing unnecessary actions to avoid fatigue.
*   **C: haat lai aaraam didaa sur milauna khyaal garnuhos** (think about getting a smooth start while giving your hands rest): The passage emphasizes avoiding fatigue and suggests a smooth, relaxed approach.
*   **D: thap awaz praapta garna tapailey sanchalan garnu bhayeko bellows ko gati badhaunuhos** (to get a good sound by operating the bellows, increase its speed): While the passage doesn't *directly* say to increase bellows speed, it focuses on avoiding excessive effort to get sound, implying that a moderate bellows speed is preferable to a very rapid one which would lead to fatigue.  Increasing bellows speed would likely increase effort.

Therefore, only option A goes against the clear instructions of the passage."
"jaba tapai le accordian bajaanu hunchha, nimna madhye kunley awaj badhauna maddat grachha?","The correct answer is **B: thap bal (pressing the keys)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Accordionma, atirikta awaz prapta garna, tapain thap dawab wa vegka sath belojko prayog garnuhunchha.""  This translates to: ""In the accordion, to obtain extra sound, you use pressing the keys with force or speed.""

Therefore, ""thap bal"" (pressing the keys with force) is the key to making more sound on an accordion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thap gati (key speed):** While speed contributes to the sound, the text emphasizes *force* as the primary way to increase volume.
* **C: cum dawab (pressure of the bellows):**  Bellows pressure controls the airflow, which is important for volume, but the text specifically mentions key pressing.
* **D: aunla ko cum chaal (bellows pumping motion):**  This refers to the bellows action, not the key presses.



"
television maa bhayeko tasbirharuko kinaara kina kateko hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Purai screen tasbirle bharna ko laagi (To fill the entire screen with the image)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that overscan is done to ensure that ""sabai chijma simana katauti, mathi, tala ra chheuharu hunthyo"" (all the borders are cut off at the top, bottom, and sides). This is done to prevent black borders and make the image fill the entire screen.
* Option A (subtitle hernako lagi - for watching subtitles) is incorrect. While subtitles might be present, the *reason* for the border removal isn't specifically for subtitles.
* Option C (anya dhachama saral rupaantaran garnako lagi - for simple conversion to another format) is too general. Overscan is a specific technique to manage image display.
* Option D (dherai muni bhayeko subtitle haru kaatna - to cut off many lower subtitles) is irrelevant; the text doesn't mention anything about lower subtitles being cut off.

Therefore, the primary reason for overscan is to fill the entire screen with the image.
"
"anuchhed anusar, film lai dibhidi dhachaa ma rupaantaran garda nimna madhye kun chaahi samasya bhogna sakinchha?","The correct answer is **A: euta tasbir junley purai screen bharinna (A picture that doesn't completely fill the screen).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that overscan causes the edges (top, bottom, and sides) of the image to be cut off. This means the image won't fill the entire screen.
* Option B (partial subtitle cut) isn't mentioned in the passage.
* Option C (a picture that completely fills the screen) is the opposite of overscan.
* Option D (cutting the borders) is *a result* of overscan, not the primary problem described. The main problem is the loss of image content due to the overscan.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
british gadh kaha awasthit thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: borderntown**.

The text states: ""General zone cadwalderle kunai pani sudridhikaranlai rokna **boardentaunako britis gadhko viruddha** dhyan bhadkauka lagi akraman suru garthe."" This translates to ""He started an attack to divert attention **against the British fort at Bordentown** to prevent any further sabotage.""
"

The passage states: ""July 4 maa congressle yasalai grahan garepachhi congresska adhyaksha zone hancock ra sachiva charles thamasanle hastakshar gareko hastalikhit abhilekh..."" This translates to: ""After the Congress adopted it on July 4th, the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, signed the handwritten document...""

"nimna sthan haru madhye, dunlap broadside antim maa kaha aayeko thiyo?","The correct answer is **C: london**.

The passage states: ""tyasko euta pratilipi august 10 maa london pugyo."" which translates to ""a copy of it arrived in London on August 10th.""
"
karnal stark ko sipahiharu kaha awasthit thee?,"The correct answer is **C: peninsula ko uttarpurvatira (north side of the peninsula)**.

The passage states: ""Starkka manisharule upaniweshwadiko sthitiko uttari chheuma barma sthan lie."" This translates to ""Stark's men took a position on the northern side of the peninsula.""
"
"anuchhed anusar, stark ko manis harule uniharuko parkhal kahiley badhaae?","The correct answer is **B: niyamit wyakti haruley ghocho paar gare pachhi** (When regular people had crossed the ford).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gridle wa Starkle barka aghadi karib 100 feat (30 meter) co hissedari rakhe ra aadesh die key jabasamma niyamit wyaktiharu paar gardainan, tabasamma kasaile ago laga.""  This translates to: ""Gridle and Stark advanced about 100 feet (30 meters) and ordered that no one cross until the regular people had crossed.""

Therefore, the soldiers (led by Stark and Gridle) advanced *after* the regular people had crossed the ford, and then they set up a blockade.
"
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhye chinko sabai bhanda himsaatmak yug kun thiyo?","The correct answer is **D: teen raajyaharuko yug (Three Kingdoms Period)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Teen adhirajya prachin chinko itihasma euta raktapatpurna yug thiyo jasma cy'anko mahaan darbarma uccha sthanko asanka lagi ladda hajaraun manisharuko mrityu bhayo."" This translates to: ""The history of the three great empires of ancient China was a bloody era in which thousands of people fought and died for high positions in their grand courts."" This refers directly to the Three Kingdoms Period.

The passage mentions other periods (Han Dynasty, Qin Dynasty) but doesn't describe them as being as violent as the Three Kingdoms Period.
"
"anucched anusar, ghumante charanma jaada sena kamila koloni barey ke satya ho?","The correct answer is **C: uniharule banaune gunda 17 din pachhi parivartan garchhan.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yea pratyek ghumante hinsatmak wyawahar wa marchharu lagbhag 17 dinasamma rahanchhan."" This translates to ""Each group of wanderers creates violent behavior/attacks and stays for approximately 17 days.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uniharu raati gunda banauchhan (They make gangs at night):** The passage doesn't specify a time of day when they form gangs, just that they form gangs during the wandering period.
* **B: uniharusanga khaanaako aapurti kam chha (They have a lack of food):** The passage says that food is readily available to the wanderers.
* **D: uniharu dinma maarch garchhan (They attack daily):** While they engage in violent behavior, the passage doesn't state that they attack *daily*.

Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the text.
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhye kun vaakyale ghumante charanko bela sena kamila koloni haruko gunda banauney baaniko yathartha jhalkauchha?","The correct answer is **B: uniharu gunda nabanai 17 din maarch garchhan (They form gangs for 17 days each).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Yea pratyek ghumante hinsatmak wyawahar wa marchharu lagbhag 17 dinasamma rahanchhan"" which translates to ""Each group of marauders engages in violent behavior for approximately 17 days.""
* **Option B directly reflects this information.** It accurately states the duration for which the gangs operate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uniharule raati gunda banauchhan (They form gangs at night):** The passage doesn't specify the time of day they form gangs.
* **C: uniharule harek din gunda parivartan garchhan (They change gangs every day):** The passage says they form gangs for about 17 days, not daily.
* **D: uniharule tyo charanko laagi uhi gunda prayog garchhan (They use armed gangs for that period):**  The passage mentions violent behavior, but doesn't explicitly state they use armed gangs. It simply refers to ""hinsatmak wyawahar"" (violent behavior).



"
nimna madhye bahya sanket upasthit hunda pani ke jaari rahanchha?,"The correct answer is **C: jaivik ghadiharu (biological clocks)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jaivik ghadiharu bahya dhakkako anupasthitima samet swatantra-chalne chakralai nirantarta dine atmanirbhar dolakharu hun."" (Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that maintain continuity even in the absence of external stimuli.)

This directly indicates that biological clocks continue to function independently, even if external signals are missing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: antarjat chakraharu (endocrine glands):** The passage states that the production of hormones depends on the presence of endocrine glands.  The passage also suggests that hormones are influenced by external signals.
* **B: Awadhik layaharu (circadian rhythms):** The passage states that excessive rhythms, while affected by external signals, also impact various living organisms.
* **D: awalokan gariyeka layaharu (observed rhythms):**  The passage does not mention ""observed rhythms"".
"
kun naamle phenotypic lakshan pradarshan garne wyaktiharuko barnan garchha?,"The correct answer is **D: polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** refers to organisms that exhibit variations in their physical characteristics (phenotypic traits). The text states that individuals are called ""monomorphic"" when they all have the same phenotypic traits, and ""polymorphic"" when they display many different forms of a particular trait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:** This is the opposite of what the question asks. It describes individuals with *uniform* phenotypic traits.
* **Jivaharu (organisms):** This is a general term and doesn't specifically describe individuals with varying phenotypic traits.
* **Prajitiharu (species):** This refers to a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. It doesn't relate to phenotypic variation within a species.



"
kunai nischit kshetramaa basobaas garney jivaharuko lagi nimna madhye kun chaai sahi naam ho?,"The correct answer is **B: janasankhyaa**.

Here's why:

* **Janasankhyaa (Population):**  The definition in the question states that a population is a group of individuals of the same species living in a specific geographic area.  This perfectly matches the question's description of organisms living in a specific area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:**  This describes a population where all individuals have the same phenotype (physical characteristics).  The question describes a group where individuals *differ* in certain traits.
* **Prajtiharu (Species):** This refers to a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. While populations are made up of a species, it's not the correct answer to what a group of organisms living in a specific area is *called*.
* **Polymorphic:** This describes a population where individuals have multiple forms or variations of a particular trait.  The question indicates that individuals *differ* in traits, but doesn't necessarily imply multiple *versions* of a single trait for everyone.

Therefore, **janasankhyaa** is the most accurate term for a group of organisms living in a specific geographic area.
"
nimna madhye kun prakritima adharit paryatan gatiwidhiko udaharan hoina?,"Correct answer is **C: vigyaan sangrahalaya bhraman garnu** (Visiting a science museum).

Here's why:

*   **Prakritima adharit paryatan** (Nature-based tourism) focuses on experiencing natural environments and wildlife.

Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: jharanama hike garnu** (Hiking to a waterfall) - This is a classic nature-based activity.
*   **B: jangali fulharuko photo khichhnu** (Taking photos of wild flowers) - This is a nature-based activity focused on observing and appreciating natural beauty.
*   **C: vigyaan sangrahalaya bhraman garnu** (Visiting a science museum) - A science museum is focused on human-made artifacts and scientific concepts, not primarily on natural environments.
*   **D: kutrim jhinga ko prayog garera machha marnu** (Using artificial shrimp to catch fish) - This is a fishing method that is part of nature-based tourism (though potentially controversial from an environmental perspective).

Therefore, visiting a science museum doesn't fit the description of nature-based tourism."
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhye yatayat pranaliko aadhar kun ho?","The correct answer is **B: niji kar (personal foundation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yass dynamic yatayat satalma sabaijana kunai naa kunai rupma niji karma adharit yatayat pranalisanga jodieka chan ra tyasko samarthanma chan."" 

This translates to: ""In this dynamic transportation system, everyone is connected to a personal, work-based transportation system and supports it.""

Therefore, the foundation of the transportation system mentioned is based on *personal work*. The other options are related to the *impact* or *context* of the system, not its foundation.
"
nucleus ko parikrama garney kanharu maa kun prakar ko charge hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: sakaratmak charge**.

The text states: ""Protonharuma sakaratmak vidyutiya charge hunchha jabki neutronharuma kunai charge hundaina."" (Protons have a positive electric charge, while neutrons have no charge.)

The question asks about the charge of particles orbiting the nucleus. While electrons orbit the nucleus, the provided text *doesn't* explicitly state the charge of the orbiting particles (electrons). However, it *does* state that protons have a positive charge.  Given the options and the information provided about the nucleus, the most logical inference is that the question is referring to the protons within the nucleus, and the orbiting particles (electrons) are *not* described as having a positive charge in the text.

Therefore, based on the available information, the best answer is **A: sakaratmak charge** (referring to the protons).
"
nucleus kun kanharu bata baneko hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: proton ra neutron**

The passage explicitly states: ""Nucleusma dui kanharu hunchhan - neutron ra protonharu."" (The nucleus has two particles - neutrons and protons.)
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhye panch bit binary nambar ko udhaharan kun ho?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Binary numbers are based on powers of 2.** Each position in a binary number represents a power of 2, starting from the rightmost digit as 2<sup>0</sup>.
* **A 5-bit binary number has 5 positions.**
* **Let's check the options:**
    * **A: 1010** - This is a 4-bit number.
    * **B: 12001** - This is an 8-bit number.
    * **C: 10010** - This is a 5-bit number.
    * **D: 110101** - This is a 6-bit number.

Therefore, only 10010 is a 5-bit binary number."
binary nambar lai ke pani bhaninchha?,"The correct answer is **A: bits**.

The passage states that binary numbers are the base of all computers and are based on the ability to represent values based on two digits (0 or 1), which are called bits.
"
nimna madhye kun laai vidyarthi bloggin gko prathamik faida bhanera anuchhed maa ullekhit garieko chhaina?,"Correct answer is **B: samakakshi haru bata alochanako kami (Lack of criticism from peers)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that blogging helps students improve their grammar and writing skills, become more aware of their surroundings, and encourages critical thinking. However, it *doesn't* mention that students receive *less* criticism from peers. In fact, the passage highlights the benefit of peer feedback in improving writing.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: wyakaran ra lekhan kshamata maa sudhar (Improvement in grammar and writing skills):** The passage directly states this benefit.
*   **C: aafno waripari ko watavaran bare thap sachetana (Awareness of their surroundings):** The passage mentions that blogging encourages students to understand their world better.
*   **D: gyan arjan garne ichhyama bridhi (Increase in the desire to gain knowledge):** The passage says blogging motivates students to be proactive and encourages learning beyond traditional classrooms."
nimna madhey bloggingko kun pakshya laai vidyarthiko lekhan kshamata sudhaar garne prerak bhanera ullekh gariyeko chha?,"The correct answer is **C: srotaaharuko ruchi kayam rakhne (Keeping the audience interested)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: """"Shrotako chaso jagaune awashyaktale vidyarthiharulai chalakh ra chakhalagdo hoon prerana pradan garchha (Toto, 2004)."""" This translates to: ""The necessity of capturing the audience's attention motivates students to be clever and resourceful.""  This directly links the need to engage the audience with the motivation for improving writing skills through blogging.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: internet maa bhaekaa samagriharu mathi lagatar jawaf diera (Responding continuously to online content):** While responding to online content is part of blogging, it's not presented as the primary motivator for improving writing skills.
*   **B: alochana bata jogine tibra ichhyaa (Strong desire for constructive criticism):** The passage mentions seeking feedback, but it doesn't highlight a ""strong desire for constructive criticism"" as the core motivator.
*   **D: sahakaarya garne aawashkyata (Need for collaboration):** Collaboration is mentioned in the context of responding to others' posts, but not as the main driver for enhancing writing ability.



"
vidyarthiharuko lagi nimna madhye kun atulyakalik sanchar ko faida hoina? ,"The correct answer is **D: gati niyantran (Speed control)**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes the advantages of asynchronous communication. The options listed (A, B, and C) all *are* benefits of asynchronous communication.  

*   **A: srotko rupma internetko prayog (Using the internet as a source):** Asynchronous communication often leverages the internet.
*   **B: dinko kunaipani samayma prashikshak haru sanga aamne samne pahunch (Access to teachers at any time of the day):** This is a key feature of asynchronous communication.
*   **C: karya garna ko lagi lachilo samay (Flexible time for work):**  Asynchronous learning allows learners to engage with materials and submit work on their own schedule.

**Gati niyantran (Speed control)**, however, is not a characteristic of asynchronous communication.  Asynchronous communication doesn't provide a mechanism for controlling the pace of learning. The learner dictates the speed, and the instructor responds later. Synchronous communication is more likely to offer speed control features.



"
"anuchhed anusar, vidyarthiharuko lagi atulyakalik sancharko nimna madhye kun pakshya lachilo hudaina?","Correct answer is **B: karya garney samay (Working time)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that asynchronous communication allows for flexibility in time management and instant feedback. It specifically mentions students can ask questions at any time and expect quick responses, avoiding the need to wait for scheduled meetings. 

Let's break down why the other options *are* benefits:

*   **A: sikne gati (Learning speed):** Asynchronous communication allows students to learn at their own pace and revisit materials as needed.
*   **C: prashikshan sambandhi samagri (Training materials):** The passage explicitly mentions access to learning materials via the internet and the World Wide Web.
*   **D: internetko prayog (Use of the internet):** The passage directly highlights the use of the internet and World Wide Web for learning.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* a benefit mentioned in the passage is the amount of time spent working (karya garney samay). The passage actually suggests asynchronous communication *reduces* the reliance on fixed working hours."
anuchhedma madhyayugin mahalsanga sambandhit ke ullekhit garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **D: yoddha (warriors)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph describes the imagery and sensory experiences associated with medieval castles (sounds of battles, smell of blood, sound of horses hooves).
* While it mentions battles (""dherai phile bhaeka ladaiharuko awaz""), it doesn't explicitly mention warriors.  The focus is on the broader atmosphere and environment of the castles, not the people who lived or fought within them.
* The other options *are* mentioned:
    * **kalko khadalbata uthne darko gandha (smell of lime from the crumbling stone):**  This is specifically mentioned.
    * **ghoda chadhi gardai judhnu (riding horses and fighting):** This is part of the sensory description.
    * **shishtata (order/discipline):** This is mentioned in the context of the preserved remains.



Therefore, the only element *not* explicitly mentioned in the paragraph is ""yoddha""."
nimna madhye kun kura anuchhedmaa mahal bhangnawshesh haru maajh utpanna huney gandha waa aawaj ko rupmaa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **B: dar (fear)**.

The passage explicitly mentions the sounds of battles and the smell of blood and decay. It also mentions the sound of horses' hooves on stone and the smell of old stone.  These all relate to the sensory experience of ruins.

Fear is not directly linked to smells or sounds in the passage in the same way. While fear might *be* present in a ruined mahal, the passage focuses on the *physical* sensory details.

Therefore, the answer is **B: dar**.
"
nimna madhye kun Kirby Maksaloi mahalko sahi varnan hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: tyo samay awadhiko lagi tesh mahalko nirman swabhavik thiena** (That the construction of this palace was not natural for that time).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the opposite:** The passage says the palace's construction in the 1480s, during the reign of Lord Hastings, occurred when the desh (region/kingdom) was relatively peaceful. This peace *created* the need for a strong defensive structure like Kirby Maksaloi.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: mahalko baklo parkhaalharu lord hestings dwara anurodh garieko thiyo** (The palace's strong walls were requested by Lord Hastings) - The passage indicates that Lord Hastings initiated the construction.
* **B: nirmanko samayma desh shanta vatavaranma bhayeko karan tesh lai nyunatam killabandhiko aawashyakta paryo** (The reason for the peaceful atmosphere during construction was that there was a minimum need for a fortified palace) - This is a slightly tricky wording, but the passage says the peace *necessitated* a defensive structure.
* **D: tyo lamo ra nirdhaarit akramanharu jhelna banaieko thiyo** (Those long and determined attacks were built by the lake) -  The text says the palace was built to defend against ""ghumante luteraharuka sanah jhundharu"" (wandering robbers and large hordes). It's not directly stated that these attacks were ""built by the lake"", but the palace was built to *defend* against these attacks.



Therefore, option C is the only one contradicted by the provided passage."
nimna madhye kun nirman viseshta lai anucchedma warnan gariyeko samay awadhi dauran ma Kirby Maksaloi mahalko aakriti ko lagi aswabhavik maninthiyo?,"Correct Answer: **C: kehi mahalharu vanda kam killabandhi**

Here's why:

The passage states that the Kirbi Maksaloi fort was built in the 1480s during a time of relative peace.  The primary need was defense against nomadic raids. The passage then highlights the *exceptional* features of the fort – the vast, shimmering moat and the deep, narrow ramparts – designed to withstand prolonged, organized attacks.

This implies that some of the fort's structures (some of the palaces) were *less* heavily fortified than expected, considering the defensive focus of the time.  Therefore, option C is the most logical answer, as it points to a feature that seems out of place given the overall emphasis on strong defense.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thula jhyalharu (large moats):**  The passage explicitly mentions the large moat as a significant defensive feature.
* **B: akramanharu jhelna sakne banayeka jag (a place built to hold back invaders):** This is a general description of the fort's purpose, not a specific architectural detail that would be considered unusual.
* **D: patalo parkhalharu (deep ramparts):** The passage states that the deep ramparts were designed for strong defense.

"anucched anusaar, nimna madhey kun agu season ko lagi tayari gariraheko dhawak ko lagi sabai bhanda badhi lavdayak hunchha?","Correct answer is **A: garmi ma cross country daud ko abhyash garnu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sharirko mathillo bhagko lagi wyayamko sath sanyukta, jadoko samayama hune kehi cross country daud daud sijanka lagi uttam tayari ho.""  (Combined with exercise for the lower body, some cross country runs done in the morning are the best preparation.)

While the other options might be beneficial, the passage highlights cross country running specifically as the *best* preparation for the mentioned type of runner.  The passage also implies that maintaining patience (dhairyata) is more important than achieving extreme speed in this context. Therefore, focusing on cross country running is the most relevant recommendation.
"
"anucched anusar, nimna madhye kun ek pratham shreniko adha-mile dhaawak ko lagi sabai bhanda badhi awashyak hunchha?","The correct answer is **B: gati bhanda badhi dhairyata badhaunu (Focus on building stamina more than speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...ek pratham shreniko adha-mile, ek manis jasle dui minetma pura garna sakha, usama uchit gatiko matrako hunu parchha, tara dhairyataka sabai khataraharuma shodhan garinu parchha."" 

This translates to: ""...a first-class half-mile runner, someone who can complete it in two minutes, should only have the right speed, but stamina needs to be practiced in all circumstances.""

The passage emphasizes that while speed is important for a first-class runner, **stamina (dhairyata) is *more* crucial**.  Therefore, building stamina is the priority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jado yamma cross country daud abhyash garnu (When practicing cross country running):**  While cross-country running is good preparation, it's not the *most* important thing. The core issue is stamina.
* **C: dui minute bhitra daud sakaunu (Being able to run in two minutes):** This is a benchmark, but the passage implies it's achievable for a first-class runner, and doesn't address the most essential element.
* **D: dhairyata bhanda gati badhaunu (Focus on speed more than stamina):** The passage *contradicts* this option. It states stamina is more important than just speed.

"athlete ko laagi, nimna madhye kun paushtik abhyashharu marfat matra prapta garna sakidaina?","सही उत्तर है **D: सामान्य तंदुरुस्ती (Samanya tandurusti)**

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि पौष्टिक अभ्यास केवल उत्कृष्ट प्रदर्शन प्रदान करने के लिए नहीं हैं, बल्कि वे युवा एथलीटों के समग्र स्वास्थ्य को भी प्रभावित करते हैं।  

* **उत्कृष्ट प्रदर्शन (Utkrishhta pradarshan)**, **प्रदर्शन में सुधार (Sudhar bhaeko pradarshan)** और **खेल में आनंद (Khelko ananda)** सभी पौष्टिक अभ्यासों से प्राप्त किए जा सकते हैं।

* हालांकि, **सामान्य तंदुरुस्ती (Samanya tandurusti)**, जो समग्र स्वास्थ्य को संदर्भित करती है,  अन्य कारकों जैसे पर्याप्त नींद, तनाव प्रबंधन, और रोग निवारण के संयोजन से भी प्राप्त की जाती है।  पौष्टिक अभ्यास महत्वपूर्ण हैं, लेकिन वे अकेले सामान्य तंदुरुस्ती सुनिश्चित नहीं करते हैं।

इसलिए, पौष्टिक अभ्यासों के माध्यम से अकेले सामान्य तंदुरुस्ती प्राप्त करना संभव नहीं है।"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhye kun tarika tanneri ethlete ko lagi afno khelkudma ananda lina ko laagi sujhav garieko chhaina?","Correct Answer: **B: lagatar utkrishta starma pradarshan garnu**

Here's why:

The paragraph emphasizes the importance of proper nutrition, hydration, and energy balance for athletes' overall health and performance. It states these factors *help* athletes improve their performance and enjoy the game.

However, the paragraph **doesn't mention** that athletes need to consistently perform at a high level to find joy in their sport.  It's implied that enjoying the game is a benefit *of* the healthy habits, not a requirement to *achieve* it.  Focusing solely on consistent high performance can be stressful and detrimental to the enjoyment of the sport.

The other options (A, C, and D) are all directly mentioned as ways to improve performance and contribute to a positive experience.
"
"anuchhed anusaar, madhya duree dhawak le kina mahango samagri kinna saknechhan?","The correct answer is **D: kum mahango samagri bare galat dharanaharu chhan** (There are misconceptions about expensive materials).

Here's why:

The paragraph states that ""dheraiko galat dharana cha"" (there are many misconceptions) about the necessary materials for playing medium-distance games.  It specifically mentions that players prioritize expensive materials even if they don't provide any real benefit, implying that people *believe* expensive materials are needed, but that belief is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yo uniharuko vyaktigat rojai ho** (This is their personal choice): The paragraph doesn't mention personal choice.
* **B: yashka pramanit faida haru chhan** (They have proven benefits): The paragraph *contradicts* this by saying that players prioritize expensive materials even when they don't provide real benefits.
* **C: yas le uniharuko pradarshan ma thulo asar garnechha** (It greatly affects their performance): The paragraph implies the opposite – that expensive materials don't have a significant impact on performance.



"
"anuchhed anusaar, euta madhyam duree daudlai ke chahinchha?","The correct answer is **A: dherai samagriharu (many materials)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tyahan bhag lina awashyak samagrika barema dheraiko galat dharana cha"" which translates to ""There are many misconceptions about the necessary materials to participate.""  Therefore, the passage implies that people *think* a lot of materials are needed, even if it's not entirely true.
"
anawik chumbakiya anunad kasley patta lagayo? ,"The correct answer is **C: bloch ra purcell**.

The text states: ""MRI anawik chumbakiya anunad (NMR) bhanne bhautik vigyan ghatanama adharit cha, june 1930 co dashakma felix bloch (stanford vishwavidyalayama karyarat) ra Edward Purcell (harward vishwavidyalayabata) dwara patta lagaieko thiyo."" (MRI Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is based on a physical science phenomenon that was patented in the 1930s by Felix Bloch (from Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).)

Therefore, Bloch and Purcell are credited with the initial discovery and patenting of NMR. While Damadian made significant contributions to applying NMR to medical imaging, he didn't initially patent the core principle of NMR itself.
"
chikitsakiya imaging pratidhwaniko lagi kahile pahilo patent pradan gariyo? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Char warshapachhi patent pradan gariyo, june mri ca kshetrama zari garieko wishwako pahilo patent thiyo."" This translates to ""Four years later, a patent was granted, which was the first patent in the field of MRI.""  Remand Damadian pioneered the use of magnetic resonance for medical imaging, and he received the patent four years after he started working on it.  He began working on it around 1970 (when he started developing the technology for diagnostic imaging), so the patent would have been in 1974.

"anuchhed anusaar, aruharuko sharirik karyaharu ko vyakhya garnako lagi manavharu sanga kun kura ko baliyo bujhaai hunuparchha?","The correct answer is **D: bodh (understanding)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aruko manasaya bujhnu yea kshamatamadhye mahatwapurna cha. hamilai sharirik karyaharuko sambhawit aspashtatama yasale samadhan garna anumati dinchha.""  This translates to: ""The ability to understand others' minds is important. It allows us to resolve potential ambiguities in their physical actions.""  Therefore, understanding (bodh) is the key to interpreting physical actions.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as accurate:

* **A: iccha (desire/wish):** While desire might influence actions, the passage isn't primarily about desire.
* **B: abhipraaya (opinion/belief):** While opinions and beliefs can play a role, the passage emphasizes understanding the *reason* behind the actions, not just the opinion.
* **C: viswas (trust/faith):** Trust is related to relationships, but not the core skill for interpreting actions.

"anuchhed anusaar, abhipraya bujhnale manisharulai ke garna maddat gardachha?","The correct answer is **A: sharirik karyaharu pachhadiko anishchitata hataunu (remove uncertainty after physical activities)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Hamilai sharirik karyahuko sambhavit aspashtatama yasale samadhan garna anumati dinchha"" which translates to ""It allows us to resolve the potential ambiguity after physical activities.""

Option A directly reflects this statement. The other options are not supported by the text.

"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhey kun ai ko mukhya uddeshyako sahi saramsha ho?","Correct Answer: **D: karya swachalan (karya swachalit garna)**

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Ai maa anusandhanle karyaharu swachalit garna messinharu banaune samawesh garchha jaslai baudhik wyawahar awashyak parchha.""  This translates to: ""AI research includes creating machines that can automate tasks requiring intellectual interaction.""

While options A, B, and C (yojana - planning, swar pahichan - voice recognition, anusuchi banaune - scheduling) are *examples* of tasks AI can automate, the overarching purpose is **task automation** itself.  ""Karya swachalan"" directly addresses this central theme.

"anucched anusaar, nimna madhye kun abhisaran soch dhancha bhayeko vyaktiko gun ho?","The correct answer is **A: euta samasyako laagi dherai wata thik jawafharu pahichan garnu** (Identifying many correct answers for a problem).

Here's why:

The passage describes the Puratanbadi (logical/critical) thinking framework as involving the recognition and reuse of information, and the ability to identify the ""correct"" answer.  It emphasizes the ability to consider multiple possibilities (""dui jawafharu matra sochnu hunchha"" - you only have to consider two answers, implying the ability to discern the right one from potential incorrect ones).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: euta samasyako lagi naya tarikaharu lagu garnu** (Applying new methods to a problem): While critical thinking *can* involve innovation, the passage primarily focuses on logical reasoning and the application of existing knowledge, not necessarily creating entirely new approaches.
* **C: samasyaharu samadhaan garnako lagi samaya linu** (Taking time to solve problems): The passage doesn't explicitly mention the importance of time.
* **D: dhanchaa haru ko yaad garnu** (Remembering frameworks):  The passage mentions understanding frameworks, but it's more about applying the frameworks rather than just remembering them.

Therefore, the ability to identify *multiple* correct answers from potential options aligns best with the described qualities of a critical thinker according to the passage."
"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhey kun abhisaran sochai manasikta ko kendrabindu manidaina?","The correct answer is **B: afno samaya line** (one's own time line).

Here's why:

The passage describes ""puratanbadi sochai dhancha"" (ancient/traditional thinking framework) as involving:

* **Information gathering:** Collecting information and reusing facts.
* **Logical thinking:**  Having a logical way of thinking.
* **Understanding frameworks:**  Understanding frameworks.
* **Problem-solving:** Solving problems.
* **Scientific testing:**  Working in scientific experiments.
* **Identifying the correct answer:** Being able to discern the correct answer from two options.

Option B, ""afno samaya line"" (one's own time line), doesn't fit into this description. The passage focuses on cognitive processes and logical skills related to problem-solving and information processing.  ""Afno samaya line"" is a personal concept related to time management or personal schedules, and isn't directly linked to the cognitive framework described.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: euta matra sahi jawaf chha bhanney bujhai** (understanding that there is only one correct answer):  This relates to identifying the correct response in a problem.
* **C: tathyaharu pahichan garnu** (identifying facts): This is a core component of information gathering and using facts.
* **D: jankari batulnu** (reusing information): This is directly stated as part of the cognitive framework.

nimna vaakya madhey kun micro-abhiwvyakti ko shahi vyakhya hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: boli lagayat anuharko bhaav ko wyakhya garincha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on micro-expressions related to deception detection.** It highlights the ability to identify subtle facial cues that indicate someone is lying.
* **Option C (""boli lagayat anuharko bhaav ko wyakhya garincha"" - ""interprets the meaning of the speaker's words"") is a general statement about understanding language, not specifically about micro-expressions.** While understanding words is important, the passage's core topic is the *nonverbal* cues of micro-expressions, not the literal meaning of spoken words.
* **Options A, B, and D all directly relate to the impact of micro-expression recognition:**
    * **A:**  Acknowledges the significance of video recordings in this field.
    * **B:**  States the potential to detect lies based on accurate interpretation of micro-expressions.
    * **D:**  Mentions the assistance in assessing honesty.



Therefore, option C is the statement that doesn't align with the passage's central focus on micro-expressions and deception detection."
nimna madhey punarutthanle ko karan le kun kura ajha mahatwapurna bhayo? ,"The correct answer is **C: path samjhana (understanding of the path)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sarma, punarutthanle sikaiko drishtikon ra gyanko pracharma ullekhaniya parivartan gareko cha. **pathlai samjhane kshamata dherai kendrikaranko bhayo.**"" (Sarma, in the process of learning, there has been a remarkable change in perspective and understanding. **The ability to understand the path has become highly centralized.**)

This highlights that the key change brought about by Punarutthan is a stronger, more central focus on *understanding the path* – how things work, the process, the methodology. The other options are either mentioned as contributing factors (like personal understanding and gaining information) or are not the central focus of the change described.
"
"punarutthan ko karan, nimna madhey kun lai kam mahatwa pradan gariyo?","The correct answer is **C: path samjhana (understanding of the path)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sarma, punarutthanle sikaiko drishtikon ra gyanko pracharma ullekhaniya parivartan gareko cha. ab wyaktigat samjhanabhitra kunai dabawa thiena, tar pathlai samjhane kshamata dherai kendrikaranko bhayo.""

This translates to: ""Sarma, in the revival (Punarutthan), a noteworthy change occurred in the perspective of learning and understanding. Now, there was no pressure within individual understanding, but the ability to understand the path became more centralized.""

This indicates that the shift in focus and importance was towards *understanding the path* (path samjhana).  The text suggests a move away from internal pressures and towards a more focused understanding of the learning process itself.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: wyaktigat samjhana (individual understanding):** While individual understanding wasn't *negatively* impacted, the text highlights a shift *away* from internal pressure within it. It wasn't the primary focus of the revival.
* **B: gyan prapta garnu (acquiring knowledge):** While acquiring knowledge is related, the text focuses on *how* knowledge is understood, specifically the ""path.""
* **D: jankariko vitaran (distribution of information):** The text doesn't mention the distribution of information as a key change. It's more about the *understanding* of the information.



Therefore, **C: path samjhana** is the most accurate answer."
nimna madhey kunley sambandhaharu lai kayam rakhna internetko prayog garney prerna jhalkaudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: yatra bare anusandhan garna (researching travel)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on internet's role in fostering:

*   **Samuhik ra parasparik sancharka (group and mutual communication)**
*   **Shikshan (education)**
*   **Samajikaran (socialization)**
*   **Wyaktigat sanlagnata ra zari sambandhaharu (personal engagement and relationship)**

Options A, B, and D directly align with these themes:

*   **Vyawasaya networking (business networking):** Facilitates professional connections and communication.
*   **Pariwarharusanga samparkama basna (staying in touch with family):** Enables communication and connection with loved ones.
*   **Naya manisharu bhetna (meeting new people):**  Allows for expanding social circles and building relationships.

While researching travel *can* involve some social aspects and planning (potentially connecting with others), it's primarily focused on **information gathering and logistical planning**, not the core themes highlighted in the passage. The passage emphasizes communication, education, socialization, and relationships, which aren't the primary drivers for researching travel.



"
nimna madhey kunley wyaktigat sanlagnata ko lagi internetko prayog garney prerna jhalkaudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: swasthya sewa utpadanharu bare anusandhan garna**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions ""wyaktigat sanlagnata ra 'zari sambandhaharu' lai Eighmey and McCord (1998) dwara naya prerana pakshaharuko rupma pahichan gariyo..."" which translates to ""individual engagement and 'social relationships' were identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998)...""

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: nuskha khojna (Looking for recipes):** This can be considered a form of individual engagement, especially if it involves sharing or discussing recipes.
*   **B: online chhalfal board ma post garna (Posting on online forums):** This directly relates to social interaction and engagement.
*   **C: swasthya sewa utpadanharu bare anusandhan garna (Researching healthcare products):**  While potentially useful, this is primarily focused on information gathering and doesn't inherently involve social interaction or individual engagement as defined in the passage. It's a more solitary activity.
*   **D: vitta vyawasthapan garna (Managing finances):** This can involve individual engagement and requires personal focus.

Therefore, researching healthcare products is the least aligned with the idea of individual engagement and social relationships as highlighted in the passage.

"

The passage states: ""dharmayuddhako parinamswarup manisharule tyas samay vikas gareka sabaibhanda mahatwapurna kuramadhye euta kura bhaneko kapda bandhna buttonharuko prayog garnu thiyo.""  This translates to: ""As a result of the Crusades, people developed a very important thing at that time among the things they developed, which was the use of clothing fastening buttons.""

The Crusades are explicitly mentioned as the cause for the adoption of buttons. The other options are time periods associated with the Gothic style, but the passage directly links button use to the Crusades.
"
"anucched anusar, nimna madhye kun lai watawaran samasyaharuko dirghakalin samadhan maaninchha?","Correct Answer: **C: samasyahako jad pahichan garera (समस्याको जड पहिचान गरेर)**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that simply seeking temporary solutions isn't enough. It states that to truly solve environmental problems, we need to ""laga ra tiniharulai n parnupardacha"" (attach ourselves and not abandon them). This implies understanding the root causes of the problems.

Option C, ""samasyahako jad pahichan garera"" (identifying the root cause of the problem), directly aligns with this idea of addressing the fundamental issues rather than just the symptoms.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: kharchilo jiwansaili ko bahiskar (खर्चिलो जीवनशैली को बहिष्करण - Exclusion of an extravagant lifestyle):** While reducing consumption is helpful, the passage implies a deeper analysis is needed.
* **B: sakriyavad (सक्रियवाद - Activism):**  Environmental activism is important, but the passage suggests it's part of a larger strategy that needs to be informed by understanding the root causes.
* **D: watawaran andolanko sahayogi bhaera (वतावरण आंदोलनको सहयोगी भएर - Being a supporter of environmental movements):** Similar to B, supporting movements is beneficial, but it's not the long-term solution described in the passage.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna samadhan madhye kun lai watawaran samasyaharuko lakshanatmak upachar manidaina?","Correct answer is **B: samasyako jadlai nishkirya banaera (Ignoring the root cause of the problem)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that simply seeking temporary solutions is *not* a comprehensive remedy. It emphasizes the need to address the root causes of environmental problems. 
* Option B directly reflects this by suggesting ignoring the root cause.
* Options A, C, and D all represent actions that address environmental issues, even if they are not the *only* actions. They are steps towards a more sustainable approach.



Therefore, ignoring the root cause of the problem is presented as the opposite of a comprehensive solution, aligning with the passage's argument."
europe ko kun deshma kunai yuddha pahilo patak dharmako lagi nabhaer shakti santulanko vishaya ma bhaeko maninchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Germany**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the core issue of the Franco-Spanish War was framed as a struggle for a balance of power.  It explicitly says that the conflict is viewed as a turning point where conflicts with European powers shifted from being primarily religious wars to being about power dynamics.  

While other countries were involved in conflicts that had religious elements, the passage specifically highlights how the Franco-Spanish War represented a shift *away* from purely religious wars and *towards* a struggle for power, making Germany a logical choice as a major player in this power balance shift.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: England:** England was involved in religious conflicts (English Reformation, etc.) and power struggles, but the passage doesn't specifically link them to the same degree of framing as the Franco-Spanish War as a key shift.
*   **C: Portugal:** Portugal's role in this period is not highlighted in the passage.
*   **D: Spain:** Spain was a major player in the Franco-Spanish War, and the passage frames it as a religious war. The question asks which country had a war *not* primarily about religion.



Therefore, Germany best fits the description of a nation whose conflicts during this period are seen as primarily about power balance rather than religion, aligning with the passage's central argument."
Kun yuddhalai kahilekahi antim ‘dharmik yuddha’ bhanera vyakhya garinchha?,"Correct answer is **A: tees varshako yuddha (Thirty Years' War)**.

The text explicitly states: ""yasartha, tees warshako yuddha antim dharmik yuddako rupma ankit hunechha."" which translates to ""For this reason, the Thirty Years' War is marked as the last religious war.""
"
nimna madhye catholic churchko kun paksha lai dhyanpurvak heri rahiyeko thiyena?,"The correct answer is **A: yedi church bhitrako dhan vitawaran thik thiyo ki thiyena**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *power* and *wealth* of the Catholic Church, and how this led to questions about its doctrines. The passage explicitly mentions the Church's wealth being used to alleviate suffering and poverty.  The core question raised is whether this is truly happening.

Let's look at why the other options are relevant:

*   **B: yedi dharmako mukhya sidhantaharu samsodhan garnu parchha ki pardaina:** The passage highlights that the Church's doctrines (specifically the idea of using wealth to help the poor) are under scrutiny.
*   **C: churchbhitra shaktiko kendrikaran:** The passage mentions the concentration of power and wealth within the Church as a key factor driving the questions about its doctrines.
*   **D: yedi churchko mukhya sidhantaharu palana bhairaheko thiyo ki thiyena:** This directly addresses the validity of the Church's core beliefs, which is central to the passage's main question.

Option A, whether the Church's internal financial management is sound, is a related but secondary concern to the central question about the validity of its core doctrines and the application of its stated principles. The passage emphasizes the *doctrines* and their *implementation* more than the *management* of funds themselves.

nimna madhye raja ra rani laai bhidle jabarjasti ke garna lagayenan?,"The correct answer is **C: surakshakarmiko tauko kateko herna** (Seeing the royal guard's head being cut off).

Here's why:

The passage states the mob *threatened and did* confront the King and Queen, and they *forced* them to return to Paris. It mentions the royal carriages' windows being opened.  While the events were terrifying, the passage doesn't explicitly state that the King and Queen *witnessed* the beheading of a guard. Options A, B, and D are all explicitly mentioned as parts of the forceful journey. Option C is not directly mentioned.



"
nimna madhye kun belayatko aparamparkik naval yuddhako natija thiena?,"Correct Answer: **C: antarashtriya kanun haru maa pariwartan gariyo**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the blockade violated international law.** It mentions the blockade went against generally accepted international law, even though it was effective. However, it *doesn't* say the blockade *caused* a change in international law.

Let's look at why the other options *did* happen:

* **A: germanyko testai yuddha rananiti prayog garney ichhyaa (Germany's desire to use the same war strategy):** The passage explicitly states that Germany expected a similar reaction to its own blockade.
* **B: sanmlagna nabhayekaa jahajharu jokhim ma pareka thie (Uninvolved ships were in danger):** The blockade was broad and affected neutral ships, putting them at risk.
* **D: mahatwapurna apurtiharu pahunch garna sakiena (Important supplies could not be delivered):** The blockade effectively cut off crucial supplies to Britain.

Therefore, the only statement that isn't supported by the passage is that international law changed as a result."
kun chai vakya le belayatko germany biriuddha naval nakabandiko varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **B: yesley germanyko pandubbi yuddh lai uksaayo (Yes, it provoked Germany to the submarine war.)**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the naval blockade *was intended* to provoke Germany into the unrestricted submarine war. However, the passage *doesn't explicitly say* that the blockade *did* provoke Germany. It only mentions the expectation that Germany would react similarly to the blockade as the blockade had reacted to German unrestricted submarine warfare.
* Options A, C, and D are all directly mentioned as consequences or aspects of the naval blockade in the passage.

Therefore, option B is the only one that describes something *not directly stated* in the passage."
"anuchhed anusar, kaslai multiple sclerosis ko pahichan garne sambhawana badhi hunchha?","The correct answer is **A: ek 32 varshako mahila** (a 32-year-old woman).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anusandhanle purushbhanda mahilaharuma dui gauna badhi MS hune sambhawana hunchha."" (Research suggests that women have twice the chance of developing MS compared to men.)

Option A describes a 32-year-old woman, which falls within the age range where women are statistically more likely to develop MS. The other options are either too young (B & D) or too old (C) to align with the statistical difference mentioned in the passage.
"
"anuchhed anusar, niyamit gatiwidhiko sahabhagiharu lai keko lagi dherai sahayogko awashyakta paryo?","The correct answer is **A: pidaa bare nakaratmak dharana (negative perception of pain)**.

The text states: ""Niyamit gatiwidhima bhag liirahekaharulai pidako nakaratmak dharanako sartama adhik samarthanko awashyakta pardachha..."" which translates to ""Those participating in regular exercise need more support in the context of having a negative perception of pain...""
"
"anuchhed anusar, taraarwaji praya: kasari khelinchha?","Correct answer is **D: dwanda ko prarupma (duel ko prarupma)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ek fencerle arkolai dwell gardacha"" which translates to ""a fencer has to duel with another"".  ""Dwanda"" means duel. Therefore, the passage describes fencing as a duel, which is a type of combat. ""Dwanda ko prarupma"" translates to ""duel style"" or ""duel format"".

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adhunik prarupma (modern format):** While fencing is a modern sport, the passage focuses on *how* it's played, not its modern status.
*   **B: biswaviddyalaya starma (at the university level):** The passage mentions university students *studying* fencing, but not how the sport is played at that level.
*   **C: olympic starma (at the Olympic level):** Similar to B, the passage mentions Olympic athletes but not the specifics of gameplay at the Olympics.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhye kun antarik vishaktatako sab bhanda baliyo suchak ho?","The correct answer is **D: prescription aushadhiko bottle**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Antarik wishaktatako uttam sanket aushadhiko khula container wa vishakta gharelu rasayanko upasthiti hoon sakdachha.""  This translates to ""The best sign of antarik vishakta can be the presence of an open container of medicine or household chemicals.""

While options B, C, and A can be symptoms of illness, the passage specifically highlights the presence of medicine or chemicals as a key indicator of *antarik vishakta* (internal poisoning).
"
"anuchhed anusar, piditko jaanch garda pahilo sahi kadam ke ho?","The correct answer is **A: sthalko awalokan (observing the location)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Piditko jaanch garna, tapainle pahile afno surakshaka lagi sthalko sarwekshan garnuparchha."" This translates to: ""Before examining the victim, you should first survey the location for your own safety.""  ""Sthalko sarwekshan"" means ""surveying the location"" or ""observing the location.""

Therefore, assessing the surroundings is the *first* step mentioned.
"
nimna kathan madhey kunley piditlai jaanch garney prakriyalai sahi tarika janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: afulai chotpatak lagna sakney bare chintit nahunu** (Don't worry about getting hurt yourself).

Here's why:

The initial statement emphasizes prioritizing safety and assessing the scene *before* approaching the victim. Option A directly contradicts this by suggesting ignoring the possibility of personal injury.  This is dangerous and goes against established safety protocols.

The other options (B, C, and D) all describe appropriate steps in assessing a scene and potential dangers.
"
france ko krantile lyayeko kun pariwartanle mazdoor wargako nagarikharuma sabai bhanda thulo prabhaw lyayo?,"The correct answer is **B: warga bhanda yogyata ma dhyan dinu (Focus on merit rather than class)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Krantikari peshapachhi pani sabai purush awedakharulai sabaibhanda dherai mahatwakankshi ra safal hunka lagi khulla thiyo. Senama pani yahi bhairaheko thiyo kinky senako shrenikaran wargama adharit bhaetapni, uniharu halma kailabarma adharitathie."" This means that after the revolution, opportunities were opened up to all men based on ambition and success, *not* on class. The army's ranking system shifted from being based on class to merit. This directly addresses the core of option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: rashtrako samarthan ma briddhi (Increase in national support):** While the French Revolution did increase national support, the passage doesn't highlight this as the *most significant* change for the working class.
*   **C: ganatantra siddhanta lai grahan garnu (Adoption of democratic principles):**  The passage mentions democracy, but the key impact on the working class wasn't simply the adoption of democratic principles; it was the opportunity based on merit.
*   **D: ek naya mapan pranali (A new measurement system):** The passage mentions a new measurement system, but it's not the primary or most impactful change for the working class.

Therefore, **B** is the best answer because it reflects the passage's emphasis on opportunities based on merit, a significant shift for the working class after the French Revolution.



"
"france ko kranti pachhi, sainik ra anya peshaharu ma safalta kema dherai adharit nahuney vayo?","The correct answer is **A: uplabdhi (achievement)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Krantikari peshapachhi pani sabai purush awedakharulai sabaibhanda dherai mahatwakankshi ra safal hunka lagi khulla thiyo."" This translates to: ""After the revolution, all aspiring men were open to being more ambitious and successful than anyone else."" This implies that success was based on **achievement** rather than social class.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: warga (class):** The passage explicitly mentions the shift *away* from class-based hierarchies (like the military's rank system).
* **C: mahattwakanshya (important/significant):** While ambition was encouraged, the passage doesn't say success was based on being important or significant.
* **D: kshayamata (decay/decline):** The passage describes a rise in ambition and opportunity, not decay.



"
vikasit deshharuma sabai bhanda badhi kun sarvajanik sewaley asantushti hunchha vaninchha?,"सही उत्तर है **D: शिक्षा (Shikshya)**।

यहाँ कारण दिया गया है:

* **Q प्रश्न:** प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि विकसित देशों में, लोग अक्सर सार्वजनिक सेवाओं के बारे में शिकायत करते हैं, जैसे कि सड़कें खराब होना या देरी, लेकिन शिक्षा में असंतोष सबसे अधिक है।

* **विकल्पों का विश्लेषण:**
    * **A: पानी की गुणवत्ता (Pani ko gunastar):** पानी की गुणवत्ता एक महत्वपूर्ण चिंता का विषय है, लेकिन विकसित देशों में शिक्षा की तुलना में यह उतनी प्रमुख असंतोष का कारण नहीं है।
    * **B: पुल निर्माण (Pul nirmaan):** पुल निर्माण भी एक सार्वजनिक सेवा है, लेकिन शिकायतें अक्सर देरी या लागत से संबंधित होती हैं, असंतोष की व्यापक भावना नहीं।
    * **C: सार्वजनिक परिवहन (Sarwajanik yatayat):** सार्वजनिक परिवहन में देरी, भीड़भाड़ और विश्वसनीयता के मुद्दे हैं, लेकिन शिक्षा की तुलना में असंतोष का स्तर कम है।
    * **D: शिक्षा (Shikshya):** विकसित देशों में शिक्षा की गुणवत्ता, पहुंच और समानता को लेकर काफी असंतोष है। यह एक ऐसा क्षेत्र है जहां सुधार की आवश्यकता महसूस होती है और लोग अक्सर अपनी चिंताएं व्यक्त करते हैं।

इसलिए, கொடுக்கப்பட்ட विकल्पों में से, **शिक्षा** वह सार्वजनिक सेवा है जिसके बारे में विकसित देशों में सबसे अधिक असंतोष की शिकायतें होती हैं।"
"anuchhed anusaar, sarwajanik yatayat pranaliharu bare ke bhanna sakinchha?","The correct answer is **C: tiniharu ko prayog garne dherale gunaso garchhan (Many people appreciate the use of them.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""lagbhag sabaijanale yatayat pranaliharuka barema gunaso gardachan"" which translates to ""almost everyone appreciates the use of transport systems.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tiniharulai prayog graney sabaijanaly tiniharulai man parauchhan (All those who use them appreciate them.)**  While the passage says ""almost everyone,"" it doesn't say *all* people who use them are happy.
* **B: tiniharu paniko gunastar jatiko naramro hudainan (They don't have much good quality either.)** The passage focuses on the appreciation, not the quality.
* **D: tiniharu dheraijaso vikasit deshharuma nishulka hunchhan (They are mostly free in developed countries.)**  The passage doesn't mention the cost of transport systems.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the passage's content."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun driverko anishchittako karan anuman garna garo hunchha?","The correct answer is **A: traffic ko beg (traffic speed)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Driverko wyawahar soy pratishat nishchittaka sath bhavishyavani garna nasakine hunda durbhagyawash yatayat praaha adhyayan gahro chha.""  This translates to: ""Because it is unfortunately impossible to predict driver behavior with 100% certainty, traffic flow studies are deep.""

This implies that driver behavior is unpredictable. The paragraph then mentions that drivers *tend* to behave in similar ways, leading to some predictability.  The reason for the unpredictability, the *cause* of the uncertainty in driver behavior, is directly linked to their *speed*.  Speed is a fundamental aspect of driver behavior and a major factor influencing traffic flow and safety.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: bato nirmanko yojana (road construction plan):** While road construction *can* influence traffic, the paragraph focuses on inherent uncertainty in driver *behavior*, not external factors like road design.
* **C: bato sanchalan (road operation/management):** Similar to road construction, this refers to external management of the road, not the unpredictable nature of drivers themselves.
* **D: traffic ko bahav (traffic volume/flow):**  The paragraph mentions flow, density, and speed as key characteristics, but the uncertainty in driver behavior is *caused* by the unpredictable nature of drivers, not just the sheer volume of traffic.  While volume affects flow, it's not the *reason* for driver unpredictability.



Therefore, the uncertainty in driver behavior is primarily linked to the unpredictability of their speed.
"
nimna madhey kun traffic ko bahaav lai ganitiya rupma dekhauda prayog garinchha?,"The correct answer is **D: traffic ko ghanatwa (traffic density)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that to represent traffic flow mathematically, three main characteristics are established:

*   **prawaha (flow)**
*   **ghanatwa (density)**
*   **beg (speed)**

The question asks which option is used to represent traffic flow *mathematically*.  Traffic density is directly one of the three characteristics the text says is used for mathematical representation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Bato sanchalan (road operation):** This is a broad term referring to how roads function, not a specific characteristic used for mathematical modeling of flow.
*   **Driverko wyavahaar (driver behavior):** While driver behavior influences traffic flow, the text acknowledges it's unpredictable and therefore not ideal for *mathematical* prediction.
*   **Path ko design (path design):**  Road design is important for managing traffic, but it's not a characteristic *of* the flow itself; it's a factor that *affects* the flow.



"
hershey ra chase le uniharuko dna pratyaropan garna ke prayog gare? ,"The correct answer is **A: radioactive phosphorus**. 

Here's why:

The question asks what Hershey and Chase used to *label* the DNA. They used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA and radioactive sulfur to label the protein.  This allowed them to track which component entered the bacterial cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: anuwanshik samagri (genetic material):** This is too general. While DNA *is* the genetic material, it doesn't specify *what they used to label it*.
* **C: radioactive salfar (radioactive sulfur):** They used this to label the protein, not the DNA.
* **D: virusharu (viruses):** They used bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria), but the question is about the *labeling method*, not the type of virus.



"
Utpariwartan santanharulai dina sakne kshamata ke ma nirbhar chha?,"The correct answer is **C: Utpariwartan ko prakar (The type of mutation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Utpariwartanle sell mrityu wa cancer nimtyauna sakne hunale jiwanu rekha koshharuma hune utpariwartan bacchalai dina sakinchha.""  This translates to: ""Mutations can cause cell death or cancer, so mutations in somatic cells can be passed on."" This highlights that the *type* of mutation is crucial.  Some mutations have a significant impact and are more likely to be passed on, while others might be neutral.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Yedi koshharu jiwanu-rekha ho bhane (If the cells are somatic):** While somatic cells *can* contribute to mutations passed on to offspring, the passage emphasizes the *type* of mutation, not just that it's in a somatic cell.
* **B: Anuwanshik samagriko mahattwa (The importance of genetic material):**  Genetic material (DNA) is essential for mutations, but the passage focuses on the *effect* of the mutation, not just the presence of genetic material.
* **D: Yedi utpariwartanle kosh ko mrityu garna sakchha bhane (If the mutation can cause cell death):** Cell death is a *possible* consequence of a mutation, but the passage doesn't say that mutations that cause cell death are *always* passed on. The type of mutation is the primary factor.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Utpariwartan ko prakar**."
"anuchhedma diyeko jankari anusar, utpariwartanko vibhinna asarharu kema nirbhar hudainan?","Correct Answer: **D: prabhawit utpariwartanko prakar**

Here's why:

The passage states that the impact of mutations depends on the *type* of mutation. It specifically mentions that mutations in somatic cells (non-reproductive cells) can lead to cell death or cancer, while mutations in germline cells (reproductive cells) can be passed on to offspring. The passage emphasizes the importance of the *type* of mutation in determining the outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kati anuwanshik samagri prabhavit bhayeko chha (how much genetic material is affected):** The passage mentions that the *extent* of the affected genetic material is important (e.g., affecting a significant part of a chromosome).
*   **B: yedi prabhawit koshharu kitanu-rekha hun bhane (if the affected cells are somatic):** This is directly mentioned as a factor influencing the impact – mutations in somatic cells can lead to cancer.
*   **C: prabhavit anuwanshik samagriko mahattwa (the importance of the affected genetic material):**  The passage says that the importance of the affected genetic material is important.



Therefore, the type of mutation (whether it's a point mutation, a deletion, an insertion, etc.) is a crucial factor determining the impact."
nimna madhye kun prachin sanskritiharule bakharharu rakhney karan hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: tiniharule jamin charna maddat garthe** (they helped in plowing the land).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that ancient cultures and tribes kept goats for easy access to milk, horns, meat, and skin.
* The text also mentions goats were kept in herds and allowed to graze in various areas, often supervised by children and adolescents in a place called ""gothala.""
* While goats *can* help with grazing, the passage doesn't mention land plowing as a reason for keeping them. The primary reasons given are for resources like milk, meat, horns, and hides.

Therefore, option B is the one that doesn't align with the information provided in the text.
"
golfko lakshya ke sabai bhanda kum line ho?,"The correct answer is **B: strokeharu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Thorai struckharu line ra clubko layama khelne kheladile khel jitdai khel pura gardachan."" This translates to ""The player who completes the game by hitting the ball in line and with the rhythm of the club wins.""  The game is won by completing the game with the *least number of strokes*.

Therefore, the goal of golf is to have the fewest number of strokes.
"
"ek golf coursema, kaha ghaas alik choto katiyeko hunchha?","The correct answer is **D: courseko pahilo adha bhagma** (in the first half of the course).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yo khel ghansama khelinchha ra pwalko waripariko ghaans chhoto banainchha ra yasalai green bhaninchha."" which translates to ""This game is played on a field and the grass after each stroke is cut short and called green.""

The ""green"" is the area around the hole, and it's generally in the first half (or the area immediately surrounding the hole) of each hole on a golf course. Option D is the closest and most accurate way to describe where the grass is kept short.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: athauraun pwalma** (at the final hole): The green is not at the final hole, it's around the hole.
*   **B: hariyo thau ma** (in the green area): While the green is green, this is too general. The question asks for a specific location.
*   **C: pahilo pwalma** (at the first tee): The first tee is where you *start* each hole, not where the grass is cut short.

"
ek parikshanko samanya lakshya ke ho?,"The correct answer is **A: ek wa badhi sambhawit parikalpanaharu hataunu (to eliminate one or more probable hypotheses)**.

The text states that experimentation is a key part of the scientific method and its general goal is to eliminate hypotheses.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: sansar kasari kaam garchha bhanera patta lagauna (to describe how the world works):** This is a broader goal of science, but not the specific objective of experimentation.
*   **C: prashnaharu sodhna (to solve questions):** While science often aims to answer questions, experimentation is a *method* used to do so, not the goal itself.
*   **D: vaigyanik anusandhanlai margdarshan garna (to guide scientific research):** This is true, but experimentation's *specific* goal is hypothesis elimination.

nimna madhey kun kura mancheharule 16aun shatabdidekhi garna suru gare?,"Correct answer is **C: lensharu banauna**.

Here's why:

* The text states that while people had been using lenses for magnification for a while (implied by ""Hajaraun warshadekhi magnificationka mancheharule lensharu banaera prayog gariraheka chan""), the *first actual telescopes* were made in Europe at the end of the 17th century. 
* The telescopes used lenses to magnify distant objects.
* The question asks what people *started* doing in the 16th century. The text implies that lens *making* was a key development that enabled the creation of telescopes later on.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: lensharu ko prayog (Using lenses):** The text says people *had been* using lenses for magnification before the 16th century.
* **B: wastuharulai magnify garera herna (Looking at objects magnified):** People had been looking at magnified objects using lenses before the 16th century.
* **D: telescopeharu banauna (Making telescopes):** Telescopes weren't made until the end of the 17th century, so they couldn't have started being made in the 16th century.



"
mancheharule lensharuko prayog garera wastuharu magnify gareko kati samaya bhayo?,"The correct answer is **A: hajar varsha dekhi** (thousands of years).

The passage states: ""Hajaraun varshadekhi magnificationka mancheharule lensharu banaera prayog gariraheka chan. Yadyapi, pahila asal telescopeharu europema 16 aun shatabdiko antyatira baneka thee."" This translates to: ""Magnifying glasses have been made and used with lenses for thousands of years. However, the first real telescopes were made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.""

Therefore, the first part of the sentence clearly indicates that the use of lenses for magnification dates back thousands of years.
"
"anuchhed anusar, muhammadko gufaley usko adhyatmik karyaharu ra manyataharu barey ke bhanchha?","The correct answer is **C: uslai thorai ekal samay chahinthyo (He liked a little solitude).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Makkako uttarma bhaeka pahadharumadhe ek tuppoma awasthit, yo gufa vishwaka baaki thaunbata purna rupma alag cha. Wastawma, yadi kasailai yo awasthit cha bhane thaha bhaeko bhae tapani fella parna vilkulai sajilo chhaina. ekpatak gufama chhirepachi, yo purai alagai cha. Mathi bhaeko spashta, sunder akash ra warparka dherai pahadharu bahek aru kehi pani dekhna sakidaina. gufa bhitrabata yass sansarlai thorai matra dekhna wa sunna sakinchha.""

This describes the cave as being isolated and offering a place where one can only see and hear a limited amount of the world outside. The passage implies that Muhammad sought this isolation.  The fact that he chose to live in such a secluded place suggests he valued solitude.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: uslai shanta ra ekanta maanparchha (He values peace and solitude):** While related, the passage doesn't explicitly say he *values* peace and solitude, only that he sought out a solitary environment.
* **B: bahiri hallaley dhyanma maddat gardacha (It helps in meditation in the outside world):** The cave is described as isolating *from* the outside world, not helping with meditation *in* it.
* **D: uslai aafu dekhina ra sunine bare chinta hunthiyo (He was worried about seeing and hearing himself):** The passage doesn't mention any worry about seeing or hearing himself.



"
"anuchhed anusar, falam pahila ke kolagi prayog garinthiyo?","The correct answer is **A: crossitie**.

The passage states: ""Patariharu samatnaka lagi cross taiharu dherai prarambhama pesh garieka thee."" which translates to ""Initially, cross ties were used for leveling."" Therefore, cross ties were used before the use of full-length sleepers (falam).
"
"anuchhed anusar, kathka pangraharulai kina falamka pangraharudwaara pratisthapan gariyo?","The correct answer is **D: tiniharu patrima vayeka falamley kamjor bandai thiye** (They were weak in flat terrains).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""wistarai, tathapi, yo mahasus bhayo key yadi patariharukamathi falamko steep bhayo bhane adhik kushal hunechha. Yo samanya abhyas bhayo, tar falamle wahanharuko kathka pangraharuma badhi tootfoot garayo."" 

This translates to: ""Gradually, however, it became apparent that if the slopes were steeper than the flat terrains, it would be more efficient. This became a common practice, but on slopes, the wooden beams in the vehicles increased in breakage.""

This indicates that the wooden beams (kathka pangraharu) were breaking when used on steep slopes. Therefore, they were replaced with beams installed *below* the slopes (falamka pangraharudwara pratisthapan gariyo) to provide better support and prevent breakage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ghodaharuko gatima briddhi** (Increase in horse speed): While steeper slopes *could* be more efficient, the primary reason for replacing the beams was the breakage on flat slopes, not to increase speed.
* **B: tiniharulai ajha prabhawkari maninthiyo** (They thought it was powerful): The passage doesn't mention any thoughts about power or influence.
* **C: tiniharule thulo bhar samhalna sakthe** (They could withstand greater weight): While the new beam placement might have contributed to greater weight capacity, the main driver was preventing breakage on slopes.

"anuchhed anusar, romantikwadma wyaktiharulai kun kurale prabhawit garyo?","The correct answer is **B: bhugol (geography)**.

The passage states: ""Swachchhandatawadko sandarbhama, bhugolle wyaktiharulai dhalkayo ra samayako kramasangai bhugolsanga sambandhit reeti-riwaz ra sanskriti utpanna bhae..."" which translates to ""In the context of libertarianism, geography influenced individuals and, with the passage of time, traditions and culture related to geography arose...""

Therefore, the geography (bhugol) influenced individuals in romanticism.

nimna madhey kun kathanley prawidhik nirdharanko samanya vichar jhalkaudaina? ,"The correct answer is **B: pravidhiko vikashlai sanskritile prabhawit gardaina (Technological development is not influenced by culture.)**

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""praidhiko vikasle afai sanskritik wa rajnaitik prabhavbhanda parko marg pachhyauncha ra parinamswarup praidhile samijik rupma anukulit garnuko sattama antarnihit samajharuma """"prabhawa"""" parchha.""  This translates to: ""Technological development follows its own path influenced by cultural and political power and as a result, technology introduces ""influence"" into the best inherent social understanding in a systemic manner.""

Therefore, the text *directly contradicts* option B.  It clearly indicates that cultural factors *do* influence technological development.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the text:

* **A: samajma prawidhiko prabhawharu samajik rupma anukulit hunchhan (The influences of technology in society are socially adapted.)** - The text says technology is introduced into social understanding in a systemic way, implying social adaptation.
* **C: pravidhiko samajma antarik prabhaw huncha (Technology has an inherent influence on society.)** - The text states technology introduces ""influence"" into social understanding.
* **D: pravidhik vikash raajniti prabhawma adharit hudaina (Technological development is not based on political influence.)** - The text *contradicts* this, stating technological development *is* influenced by political power.

"anuchhed anusaar, nimna madhye kun bow tannasanga sambandhit chhaina?","The answer is **D: bhyaguto ma suru garnu (Starting with the thumb)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ""up bow chinha"" (up bow symbol) involves starting with the thumb and pushing.
* The ""down bow chinha"" (down bow symbol) involves starting with the index finger and pulling.
* Options A, B, and C all describe sounds associated with the bows (sweet sound, staple-like appearance, and a loud sound respectively).
* Option D describes *how* you start the bow, and it relates to the ""up bow chinha"" (thumb starting) rather than the ""down bow chinha"" (index finger starting). Therefore, it's not directly related to the *down bow* as described in the passage.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun madhuro awajsanga sambandhit chaina?","The correct answer is **C: euta V jasto dekhiney chinha (a V-shaped sign)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Euta up-bole samanyataya madhuro dhwani utpanna garchki jabki down bow baliyo ra thap thado huncha."" This translates to: ""An up-bow generally produces a sweet sound, while a down-bow is loud and harsh.""

Option C, ""euta V jasto dekhiney chinha"" (a V-shaped sign), is described as an ""up-bow"" which produces a sweet sound.  The other options all relate to the ""down-bow"" which is described as a loud and harsh sound. Therefore, the V-shaped sign is the only one *not* associated with a sweet sound.
"
jiwashmaharule dekhauchha ki hatharu bistarai prathamik rupma nimna madhey kun prayog garna anukulan vayo?,"The correct answer is **B: bhar bokna (to hold/grip)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hominids used their hands to hold and carry things (bhar bokna) and to manipulate objects like fruits on trees. It also highlights the evolution of hand structure over millions of years, leading to increased dexterity and manipulation abilities. While the passage mentions other uses like locomotion (chalauna - walking) and grasping (tekera hindda taul boknako lagi hatko prayog), the primary focus is on the development of the ability to *hold* and manipulate objects.  The other options are less directly supported by the text's core argument.

Therefore, option B, ""bhar bokna"" (to hold/grip), best reflects the central point of the passage regarding the evolution of hand use in hominids.
"
nimna madhey kunle chimpanjiko hatharulai sahi tarikale varnan garchha? ,"The correct answer is **B: tiniharu ko hatharu ra khuttaharu bhinna akarka hunchhan (Their hands and feet have different sizes).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Chimpanjiko haat ra kutta akar ra lambaima ustai hunchhan..."" which translates to ""Chimpanzees' hands and feet have the same size and length...""  This directly contradicts option A (""tiniharu manav bhanda sidha hunchhan"" - they are straighter than humans) and option D (""tiniharu prathamik rupma niyantrankolagi prayog hunchhan"" - they are primarily used for control).
* The text also mentions that chimpanzees use their hands for grasping and feeding: ""...jasle aunlaa tekera hindda taul boknako lagi hatko prayoglai jhalkaunchhan."" - ""...which allows them to use their hands skillfully for grasping and picking up food.""
* While the text mentions using hands for feeding, it doesn't say they are *primarily* used for control (D).
* Option C (""tiniharu bhar bokna prayog hunchhan"" - they are used for picking up food) is partially true but not the most accurate description of their hands and feet in general.

Therefore, option B is the only one that is directly supported by the text."
chayanle kun samuha bata naya anuwanshik bhinnata hatauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: lukeko (hidden)**.

The passage states: ""chayanle yasalai abhiwyakta bhinnatako pulbata hataunchha,"" which translates to ""selection removes it from the platform of expressed difference.""  The ""it"" refers to the **hidden** genetic difference (""lukeko anuwanshik bhinnata"").  Selection removes the hidden difference from being expressed.
"
kun prakriya anuwanshik bhinnata thapna jimmewar hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Utpariwartan (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Utpariwartanle naya anuwanshik bhinnata thapchha..."" (Mutation creates new genetic differences...).  This directly links mutation to the creation of new genetic variations.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **Viyog (Deletion) and Punasanyojan (Recombination):** These are processes that *alter* existing genetic material but aren't the *cause* of the initial genetic difference. They are ways of rearranging what's already there.
* **Abhiwyakta (Expression):** This refers to the process by which genes are ""turned on"" or ""turned off"" to produce proteins. It doesn't create new genetic differences.

Therefore, **Utpariwartan (Mutation)** is the process responsible for introducing new genetic variations.

"annuchhed ma bhayeko jankariko adharma, “protein samasya” samadhan garna primate le ke khaanu parchha?","The correct answer is **A: mareko paatharu (meat)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Paat ra falafulharuma paine protinharu sabaibhanda sajilo ra pahunchayogya vanaspati srotharu hoon sakthe. tara hammy jasta naraanarka lagi yea khanekura napakaikan khaanda pachauna gahro huncha.

This translates to: ""Proteins found in meat and fruits can be the easiest and most accessible plant sources. But for animals like us, digesting this is very difficult. Considering all this, if our ancestors had solved their """"""protein problem"""""""" in the same way as chimpanzees did in some incidents, we wouldn't be in trouble.""  The passage then goes on to say that chimpanzees eat meat.

Therefore, the passage implies that primates solved their ""protein problem"" by eating meat (mareko paatharu).
"
"anucchedko anusar, nimna samasyaharu madhey kun amino acidsko kamile garda bhayeko hoina?","The correct answer is **C: manasik chintama wriddhi**.

Here's why:

The passage states that if humans can't obtain enough amino acids from plant sources, they face serious consequences including **malnutrition, death, and digestive problems**. It *doesn't* explicitly connect a lack of amino acids to mental retardation. While it's implied as a potential consequence of severe malnutrition, it's not directly listed as a primary effect alongside the other three.
"
kunai nischit upasanskritiko sadasyaharuly kasari praya tyo samuhasanga uniharuko sanmglantalai janauchhan?,"The best answer is **D: shaililai pratikwadko rupma prayog garera (By using stylistic opposition).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that parasanskritis (sub-cultures) are defined by distinctive style (shaili), methods (tarika), and jargon (argot).**  This means they express their identity *through* their unique way of doing things.
* **Option D aligns perfectly with this.** Using stylistic opposition – actively demonstrating differences in style, language, and approaches – is a core way parasanskritis maintain their distinct identity and signal their membership. It's a form of subtle (or not-so-subtle) resistance to assimilation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ghulmil hune prayash garera (By trying to blend in):** This is the *opposite* of what parasanskritis typically do. They don't aim to blend in; they aim to stand out.  The passage explicitly states parasanskritis are distinct from the mainstream.
* **B: uniharu wariparika sabaijanako wicharharu anukulan garera (By adapting to the mainstream's ideas):**  This again contradicts the nature of parasanskritis. Adapting to mainstream ideas would erode their distinct identity.
* **C: samajik mapdandaharu swikar garera (By accepting social norms):** While parasanskritis may navigate mainstream society, they don't necessarily *accept* social norms wholesale. They often challenge or reinterpret them through their parasanskritical lens.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

"anuchhedma prastut gariyeko siddhanta anusar, himsrak vyahahar bhayeko manine jatiya rupmaa alpasankhyak samuha ko balak lai huna sakchha?","The correct answer is **B: balak himsrak vyahahar ma samlagna hune sambhavana badhi hunchha (The probability of a child being involved in violent behavior increases.)**

Here's why:

* The passage states that when children from minority communities identify with their jatiya (ethnic/caste) traditions and customs (rudhiwadi), they may try to perform better in school based on their community's expectations. 
* However, the question asks about the *probability* of a child being involved in violent behavior. The passage implies that a strong identification with and pressure from these traditions could potentially lead to negative outcomes, *including* increased likelihood of violent behavior.  While not explicitly stated as a direct cause, it suggests a correlation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: balak himsrak vyahahar ma samlagna huna bata jogina sakchha (A child can completely avoid being involved in violent behavior.)** - The passage doesn't suggest complete avoidance; it hints at a potential increase in the *probability* of involvement.
* **C: balak samajik paristhitiharubata tadha huna khojneychha (A child tries to improve themselves from social circumstances.)** -  While children might try to improve themselves, the focus of the passage is more about the impact of community traditions on their behavior.
* **D: balak anya jatiya alpasankhyakharusanga ghulmil huna aswikar garnechha (A child mixes and accepts other minority groups.)** - The passage focuses on identification with one's *own* community's traditions, not on interaction or acceptance of other minority groups.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate inference based on the provided text.



"
"anuchhedko anusar, nimna madhey kun kura ma ek balakko jatiya rudhiwadi dharanako gyanley asar garna sakchha?","Correct answer is **B: uniharuko vyavahar (their behavior)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that racial stereotypes can affect a child's behavior. The example given is about children from minority castes identifying with their caste and then trying to perform better in school *because* of that identification. This directly shows how their behavior is influenced.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: uuniharuley pahichan garna rojeko jatiya alpasankhyak sanga (with the minority castes they identify with):** While identification is a part of the process, the *direct* effect mentioned is on behavior.  The connection to the minority caste is a factor, not the direct outcome.
* **C: anya bachchaharu sangako sambandha (relationships with other children):** The paragraph doesn't mention the impact on relationships with other children.
* **D: uniharuko jaatko paribhasha (the definition of their caste):** While understanding their caste definition is important, the paragraph focuses on how the *belief* in caste stereotypes affects actions.

*   **Samajik chinta (Samajik chinta):** Anuchhedma yo kura pradarshan garna bhaneko chaina, kintu asabhya bachcha harulai samajik chinta ko absence pradarshan garna bhaneko chaina.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: ramro kurakani garney khubi**.

"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun kura le bachchaharuma asabhya vyavahar ko varnan garchha?","The correct answer is **B: asabhya vyavahar samajik ghulmilko kamibata utpanna huna sakchha.**

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that some ""asabhya"" children are labeled as such because they haven't been socialized properly by the time they reach adulthood. This indicates a lack of social interaction and guidance as a contributing factor to their behavior.
* The paragraph also mentions that some cases of abandonment were linked to the parents' acceptance of their child's severe intellectual or physical disability. This implies that societal attitudes and lack of support can also contribute to problematic behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: adhikamsha asabhya vyavahar sharirik kharabiko karanley hunchha** (Most ""asabhya"" behavior is due to physical defects) - The paragraph doesn't explicitly say physical defects are the primary cause. It mentions disability as a *link* to abandonment, not as a direct cause of asocial behavior.
* **C: asabhya vyavahar keval uniharuko abhibhawakley thunera rakheka bachchaharu ma prabal chha** ( ""Asabhya"" behavior is prevalent only in children who are kept away by their parents) - The paragraph mentions that children can become ""asabhya"" even when not abandoned, due to lack of socialization.
* **D: sabai asabhya vyavahar dherai maanasik apangata le garda hunchha** (All ""asabhya"" behavior is caused by severe mental retardation) - The paragraph doesn't claim that mental retardation is the cause of all ""asabhya"" behavior. It mentions disability as one factor, but not a universal one.

nimna madhey kunle nirvaha krishiko chalanlai sahi tarikale varnan gardachha?,"The correct answer is **A: yo purai jaivik pranali ho** (This is a purely biological system).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Nirvahamukhi krishi ek saral, praya: jaivik..."" (Subsistence farming is a simple, almost biological...).  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: bali utpadan adhiktam banauna yesley farak tarikaharu prayog garcha** (It uses various techniques to maximize production). The text emphasizes simplicity and using traditional, low-input methods, *not* maximizing production.
* **C: yesley krishivid haru lai afno bali lai purai kshetra ma sajha garna dinchha** (It allows farmers to share their produce in their own community). While subsistence farming *can* involve community sharing, it's not the defining characteristic described in the text.
* **D: yaslai ajhai pani kehi rashtraharuma krishakharuley prayog gardachhan** (It is still used by farmers in some countries today).  The text says this is true, but it's a consequence of its historical roots, not the core definition of what subsistence farming *is*.



Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the description of subsistence farming provided in the text."
sangralay ko bhraman paryatan ko kun shreni maa parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: sanskritik paryatan** (Cultural Tourism).

Here's why:

The text explicitly defines cultural tourism as travel with the purpose of visiting places of historical and cultural significance. Museum visits fall directly under this definition. The text also describes cultural tourism as encompassing exploring different places within a country or focusing on a single area.

"anuchhedko anusar, manorajnako lagi yatra garneyharuko prathamikta ma ke huna sakcha?","The correct answer is **B: uniharuko dainiki bata chutti linu (to get away from their daily routine)**.

The passage states: ""June uniharuko niyamit dainik jiwanbhanda bhanda farak huncha. Kunai tyasto awasthama wyakti ek sthanma janchhan june aaram lynn ra ramailoka lagi hunchha..."" which translates to ""June is different from their regular daily life. In such a situation, a person goes to a place for relaxation and enjoyment...""

While the passage mentions other aspects of recreational tourism (like exploring historical sites and cultural experiences), the primary motivation highlighted is escaping the routine and enjoying leisure. Option B directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: sthaniya sanskritima bhijnu (to immerse themselves in the local culture):** While a common activity, it's not stated as the *primary* reason for going.
* **C: mahatwapurna sthalharu hernu (to see important places):**  Important places can be part of the experience, but the focus is on relaxation and escape.
* **D: euta thauko itihash bujhnu (to understand the history of a place):** Similar to C, historical understanding is a possible aspect, but not the primary driver mentioned.

anuchhed anusar kun kura le local churchbhitra dar kam garna maddat garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Sangathanko sanskritilai prabhav parney manisharu bare antardrishti prapta garera.**

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Manisharule uniharuko wyaktigat, pariwarik, ra sangathanatmak kathaharu bataunda sunne kramama, hamile vigat ra sangathanko sanskritilai ramro wa naramro prabhawa pareka kehi wyaktitwaharako mulyawan antardrishti prapta garyaun.""  This translates to: ""By listening to the stories of individuals in their personal, family, and organizational contexts, we gained valuable insights into the personalities affected by the organization's past and present culture.""

While other options touch upon related ideas, option B directly reflects the paragraph's emphasis on understanding the organization's culture and how it impacts people.  Option A is related but a result of understanding the culture. Options C and D are not directly supported as primary factors for facilitating change within the local church.



"
"anuchhed anusar, afno itihas bujhnaley ke kurama maddat garna sakchha?","The correct answer is **C: sangathanbhitra thau fela pareko anubhav diyera (providing a sense of belonging within the organization)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Kasaiko itihas bujhda sanskriti bujhieko manindaina, yasale kamtima manislai sangathanko itihasabhitra uniharu kahan chuke bhane bodh hasil garna maddat garchha."" (Understanding someone's history and culture helps at least make people understand where they went wrong within the organization's history.)

This implies that understanding the organization's history helps individuals understand their place and experience within it, fostering a sense of belonging. While the other options might be *indirect* consequences of understanding history, they aren't the primary way it helps, according to the paragraph.

* **A: pariwartan sambandhi dar ghatayera (reducing the fear of change)** - This is a *result* of understanding history, but not the *direct* way it helps.
* **B: manyataharu laai ajha baliyo banayera (strengthening beliefs)** - While history can reinforce beliefs, the paragraph doesn't explicitly connect this to understanding history.
* **D: udayamshil vyavaharma sudhar lyayera (improving entrepreneurial practices)** -  This is a potential outcome, but understanding history is a means to a broader end, not solely focused on improving entrepreneurial practices.

Here's why:

* **The passage criticizes the modern perspective of learning.** It argues that the modern approach focuses on vicarious experiences (watching TV shows, hearing about things) rather than direct, personal experience.
* **The passage emphasizes the difference between *experiencing* something and *learning* from it.** It highlights that simply seeing someone else build a house or travel doesn't equate to actually building a house or having the experience of travel.
* **Option B directly reflects this criticism.** It states that learning is centered on things we believe to be true based on experience, which is what the passage is arguing is flawed in the modern approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kehi sikaai anubhavharu anya bhanda faidajank hunchhan:** While the passage might agree with this in principle, it's not the core argument. The argument is about the *overemphasis* on vicarious experiences.
* **C: kunai tarikaharu anya bhanda ramro hunchhan:** The passage doesn't say that any method is inherently better; it's critical of the modern method.
* **D: sikaima kunai kura nirapekshya hudaina:** The passage doesn't directly address whether any learning is unimportant. It focuses on the quality and type of learning that's emphasized in the modern perspective.



"

Here's why:

The passage argues that the ""sikaiko pachhilo adhunik drishtikon"" (the latest modern perspective on learning) is flawed because it emphasizes a disconnect between learning and application.  It highlights that learning should be based on personal experience and the ability to present that experience with knowledge.

Option D directly contradicts this central argument. The passage implies that learning *should* be connected to real-world application.  Learning knowledge you'll never use is presented as a negative aspect of this modern perspective.

Let's look at why the other options are *not* the best answer:

* **A: jankari line dherai tarikaharu hunchhan** (There are many ways to get information): This is a general statement about information access and isn't inherently flawed in the context of the passage.
* **B: kunai bishesh sikai anubhavharulai anya bhanda badhi mahatwa dinuparcha** (Some specific learning experiences are given more importance than others):  This isn't explicitly condemned in the passage, although the overall sentiment is about the importance of *personal* experience.
* **C: sikaiko anubhavharu sikney ra prastut gyanma nirbhar hunchha** (Learning experiences depend on acquired knowledge and presented knowledge): This aligns with the passage's core argument about the importance of connecting experience with knowledge.



Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn't reflect the criticism of the modern learning perspective presented in the passage."
"samanya nindra awadhiko bela jabarjasti uthe pachhi, yi madhye kunley nindra hastekshep prakriyama maddat gardachha?","The correct answer is **B: shauchalaya ko prayog garney ani turuntai feri sutna janey (Go to the toilet and then go back to sleep immediately).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions that using the restroom before a scheduled wake-up (as part of the Nidra Hastakshep technique) forces you to get up to urinate, making it difficult to go back to sleep. This disruption is key to the technique.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pheri nidauna aghi dedh ghanta padhney (Read for an hour and a half before going back to sleep):** This promotes relaxation but doesn't create the wake-up disruption necessary for the Nidra Hastakshep.
* **C: aafno palangko tablema bhayeko alarm banda garney ani biss minute pachhi sutney (Turn off the alarm on your bedside table and then sleep after 20 minutes):** This is a simple wake-up and return-to-sleep method, not the deliberate disruption of the Nidra Hastakshep.
* **D: palang chheu ko tablema bhayeko bottle bata pani khaney (Drink water from a bottle on your bedside table):** While drinking fluids *can* lead to needing to urinate, the passage specifically highlights using the restroom as the *intentional* disruption for the Nidra Hastakshep technique.  Option B is more direct and aligns perfectly with the passage's explanation.



"
nimna madhey kun nindra hastekshepko sahi varnan hoina?,"Correct Answer: **D: uthi sakepachhi, dui ghanta bhitra feri nidaunu yesko lakshya ho**

Here's why:

* **Nidrama (Sleep Inertia)** is defined as the feeling of grogginess and impaired cognitive performance experienced immediately after waking up. The purpose is to minimize this grogginess.
* **Option D** describes going back to sleep within two hours of waking up. This is *opposite* of the goal of nidrama, which is to avoid prolonged sleep and minimize sleep inertia.  Nidrama aims to have a shorter sleep period (10-60 minutes) to help break the sleep cycle and reduce grogginess, not to prolong it.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct descriptions of nidrama:

* **A: yo biorhythmma adharit huna sakchha (This can be based on biorhythms):** While not strictly required, nidrama can be timed based on individual biorhythms for potential optimization.
* **B: yesko lakshya afulai sampurna rupma nauthaunu ho (Its goal is not to wake up completely):** Nidrama aims for a partial sleep period (10-60 minutes) to minimize sleep inertia, not full sleep.
* **C: Yo prakriya tapai ko samanya nindra awadhima huna sakcha (This process can occur during your normal sleep cycle):** Nidrama is designed to be a short period within your regular sleep cycle.

"jaba dimagley lagatar spasta sapana dekhna prayash garda, ke birdhi huncha?","Correct Answer: **D: REM charan bichko samaya**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What increases when someone constantly tries to have lucid dreams?
* **The passage states:** ""REM charanko bichma wistarit samay awadhima dekhine spashta sapanako parinamswarup yo ghatana hune garchha.""  This translates to ""This event (lucid dreaming) happens as a result of extended periods within the REM stage.""
* **Therefore:**  To experience lucid dreams (and try to induce them), the time spent in the REM stage of sleep needs to be longer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: REM charanko matra (Amount of REM):** While related, the passage focuses on the *duration* of REM rather than simply the amount.
* **B: Urja sthar (Energy levels):**  The passage describes negative consequences (fatigue) from trying to induce lucid dreams, not an increase in energy.
* **C: Swasthalabh hune avadhi (Duration of health benefits):** The passage implies a negative impact on health, not benefits.

* The passage explicitly states: ""Virtual tolly sadasyaharule prayaha afna tatkalin bhautik samuhaka lagi sampark winduko rupma karya gardachan. Tiniharusanga prayaha paramparagat tolly sadasyaharu bhanda badhi swatantrata hunchha..."" which translates to ""Virtual community members mostly function as communication tools for their current physical groups. They have much more freedom than traditional community members...""
* The passage also mentions that virtual communities can operate across different time zones, something traditional communities might not understand. This further supports the idea of greater freedom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: duwai toliharubata samman stharma karya garney asha rakhinchha** (Virtual communities are expected to perform religious duties).  The passage doesn't mention religious duties.
* **C: duwai toliharuley adrishya vyavasthapan tolilai report gardachan** (Virtual communities report to an invisible management system). While the passage mentions reporting to an ""invisible team,"" it doesn't say *all* virtual communities do this.  It's presented as a characteristic of ""invisible communities.""
* **D: duwai toliharuley eutai samaya kshetrama karya gardachan** (Virtual communities work in a single time zone). The passage says they can operate *across* different time zones, directly contradicting this.

"anuchhedma adharit, paramparagat ra virtual toliharu barey kun kathan sahi hoina?","The correct answer is **B: virtual toliharuley praya: paramparagat toliko lagi sampark winduko rupma karya gardachan.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Virtual tolly sadasyaharule prayaha afna tatkalin bhautik samuhaka lagi sampark winduko rupma karya gardachan. **Tiniharusanga prayaha paramparagat tolly sadasyaharu bhanda badhi swatantrata hunchha**...""

This means virtual teams don't *just* act as a point of contact. They have *more* autonomy than traditional teams.  Option B incorrectly suggests they only serve as a contact point.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true according to the passage:

* **A: paramparagat tolilai praya: mathillo starma rakhichha:** The passage doesn't explicitly say this, but it implies that traditional teams are more hierarchical and centralized, which often means the ""higher star"" or command structure is more prominent. This is an inference, but not contradicted by the text.
* **C: paramparagat toliharusanga vritual toliharu bhanda kam swatantrata hunchha:** The passage directly states that virtual teams have *more* autonomy than traditional teams.
* **D: farak samay kshetraley garda virtual toliharulai faida hunchha:** The passage explicitly mentions that the ability to operate across different time zones is a unique advantage of virtual teams.



"
nimna madhey kun samagri siddhantaharuma kendrit chhaina?,"Correct answer is **A: vayasakta ma utpanna hune chahana haru** (Age-related needs).

Here's why:

*   **The question asks which theory *doesn't* focus on a particular area.** The passage describes two main theories: Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.

*   **Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs** is all about needs progressing through stages, from basic physiological needs to self-actualization. Age *does* factor into Maslow's hierarchy, as needs change as people age.

*   **Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory** focuses on factors related to job satisfaction (motivators) and dissatisfaction (hygiene factors). Age can influence these factors.

*   **Options B, C, and D** are core components of both Maslow's and Herzberg's theories.
    *   **B:**  Focuses on the work environment's impact on performance (Herzberg).
    *   **C:**  Refers to the hierarchy of needs, especially as they are fulfilled (Maslow).
    *   **D:**  Is about understanding what motivates people (both theories).

Therefore, age-related needs are a part of Maslow's hierarchy but aren't the central focus of *either* of the theories described in the passage in the same way the other options are."
nimna madhey kun tihai niyamko vastu hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: photobhitra jiwan ra urja shrijana garney** (creating life and energy within the photo).

Here's why:

The provided text describes the ""Law of Least Effort"" (Tihaiko dherai-durupyog ra aksar-upahas garieko niyam).  This law is fundamentally about composition and visual hierarchy in photography. It focuses on:

* **Creating a dominant point of interest:**  The law emphasizes placing the main subject in a powerful and emphasized position.
* **Dividing the frame into thirds:** This is a key technique for creating a visually pleasing and balanced composition.
* **Using leading lines:**  These lines guide the viewer's eye to the subject.
* **Establishing a compositional framework:**  The three-part division helps create structure.

Option B, ""creating life and energy within the photo,"" is a more abstract and philosophical concept, not directly related to the practical application of the Law of Least Effort as described in the text.  While good photography *can* evoke life and energy, that's not the core principle of this specific rule.

The other options (A, C, and D) *are* all elements of the Law of Least Effort:

* **A: vishaya lai rakhna sakne adhar rekha shrijana garney** (Creating base lines to support the subject) -  This refers to using lines for stability and anchoring the subject.
* **C: visayalai visesh ra prabhavakari sthanma rakhney** (Placing the subject in a special and influential position) -  This is directly about emphasizing the subject's importance.
* **D: photobhitra kram sthapana garnu** (Establishing order within the photo) -  This refers to creating a visual hierarchy using composition techniques.

nimna madhey kunley 35milimeter photography dhanchalai warnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **C: yosanga dherai sadharan dhanchaharu bhanda bhinnai anupata cha** (This has a different aspect ratio than many common formats).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""35 millimeterko dhancha wastawma, kehi bhramak bhae pani chaudaima 36 millimeter ra uchaima 24 millimeterko cha. Yass dhanchako anupata (sabaibhanda sadharan sampurna sankhyako anupata prapta garna bahralai vibhajan garera ) tyasaile 3:2 manieko cha. Dheraijaso samanya dhanchaharu (udaharanka lagi aps dhancha parivar) yass akar anupatko barabar wa lagbhag nikat hunchhan.""  (In reality, the 35 millimeter format is 36 millimeters wide and 24 millimeters high.  Therefore, its aspect ratio is 3:2. Many common formats (for example, APS and family formats) are approximately equal to this aspect ratio.)

* **Options A, B, and D are all directly mentioned or implied in the passage.**

Therefore, option C is the only one that *doesn't* describe the 35mm format as presented in the text.

"annuched anusaar, utpadakharuley lens utpadanko gunastar badhauda, zoom lens kasari sudhar bhayeko cha?","The correct answer is **C: tiniharuko photo gunastar sthir focal lambai vayeko lensharu sanga saman chhan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lens utpadakharule lensko utpadanma uccha gunastar prapta garepachhi yo samasya come hundai gairaheko cha. Yasale zoom lenslai nishchit focal lambaika sath lensdwara prapta tulaniya gunastarko tasbir nikalna garna anumati dinchha."" 

This translates to: ""Since lens manufacturers have achieved high quality in lens production, this problem has gone away. This allows zoom lenses to produce comparable quality images with fixed focal lengths.""

Therefore, achieving higher quality in production has made zoom lenses produce images with quality comparable to prime lenses.  Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the passage.
"
"anuched anusar, kun awasthama prime lens bhanda zoom lens ruchaina sakcha?","The correct answer is **A: yedi dherai adhikatam aperture prathamikta ho bhaney (If maximum aperture is a priority)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Lensko adhikatam appeture (gati) prayaha come hune bhaera zoom lensko arko ghata ho. Yasale bina flashko come prakashka awasthaharuma sasto zoom lensharuko prayog garna kathina banaunchha.""  This translates to: ""The maximum aperture (speed) is often a drawback of zoom lenses. It makes it difficult to use inexpensive zoom lenses in low-light conditions without a flash.""

Therefore, if a photographer prioritizes a wide maximum aperture (for low-light shooting or shallow depth of field), zoom lenses are often limited compared to prime lenses.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: yedi tapailey lensma kam tatwaharu chahanuhuncha bhaney (If you want fewer lens elements):** The passage explicitly says ""lens tatwaharuko sankhya prime lenskobhanda badhi hunchha"" (the number of lens elements is higher in zoom lenses than in prime lenses).
* **C: yedi tapailey adhyaro settingharuma flash prayog garna chahanuhunna bhaney (If you want to use a flash in dark settings):**  The passage says zoom lenses are *difficult* to use with flash in low light, not that they are *preferred*.
* **D: yedi tapailey thap focal jatiltako khojma hunuhuncha bhaney (If you are looking for a wide focal range):** The passage acknowledges that zoom lenses offer a wide focal range (""thap focal jatiltako khojma hunuhuncha bhaney"" is interpreted as ""if you are looking for a wide focal range""), but it also highlights the trade-offs, particularly with maximum aperture.



"
nimna madhey kun rahasyawadko sahi varnan manindaina?,"Correct answer is **A: tyaha antargyanko shantipurwark ra anandamaya awasthalai jod hunchha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that esoteric traditions go beyond simply achieving a peaceful and joyful state.** While peace and joy *might* be aspects of the experience, the core focus is on a deeper, more profound realization of reality, divinity, or the true nature of existence.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **B: rahasyawadko anuyayiharuley adhyatmik satyako sachet jagarukta khojchhan:**  This directly reflects the passage's statement about esoteric practitioners seeking direct experience of ultimate reality.
* **C: rahasyawadko anuyayiharuley aafno antardhristilai ishwari satyatama vikaas garney tarikaharu apnauna sakchhan:** The passage states that practitioners follow certain techniques to nourish the experience, implying the development of inner perception.
* **D: pratakshya vyaktigat anubhav khojnu ma jod dherai anya dharmik vishvash ra aradhanasanga dajna sakincha:** The passage explicitly states this connection, highlighting how esoteric traditions can be distinguished from other spiritual paths.



Therefore, option A is the *least* accurate description of esoteric traditions as presented in the text. It oversimplifies their aims.



"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun rahasyawadko mudda hoina?","Correct Answer: **B: sajha, samjik anubhavmarfat antardrishti anusaran garney**

Here's why:

*   The passage focuses on individual, direct experience (pratyaksha anubhav) as the key to understanding the ""rasayawad"" (mysticism). It emphasizes a personal quest for enlightenment and a direct realization of the divine.
*   Options A, C, and D all align with this individualistic approach:
    *   **A: ishwari satyatama antargyan khojney** (seeking the ultimate knowledge of the divine) - Directly relates to the core quest described.
    *   **C: antargyanko anandamaya awasthama jod** (connecting to the blissful state within) - Describes the desired outcome of the mystical journey.
    *   **D: bhagwanko sachet jagarukta anusaran garney** (following the conscious awareness of the divine) - Aligns with the pursuit of a heightened state of consciousness.
*   **B: sajha, samjik anubhavmarfat antardrishti anusaran garney** (following intuition through shared, social experiences) - This option is the *opposite* of the passage's emphasis on individual experience. The passage distinguishes mysticism from typical religious beliefs, specifically highlighting its focus on direct, personal intuition *rather than* social or shared experiences. The passage suggests mysticism is a unique state of consciousness, different from conventional religious or social practices.



"
"anuchhed anussar, krishi samaj kasley suruwat gareko huna sakchha?","Correct answer is **B: chatham taapuko moriori**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Newzealandbata tadha basain sarera aeka maori chatham tapuharuma arko jaati pani thee. Tiniharule afulai moriori bhanera bolae tyahan kehi jhadapharu bhae ra antyama morioriharulai bhagaiyo."" (People migrated from New Zealand and settled in the Chatham Islands, where another group also lived. They called themselves Moriori, there were some conflicts and finally drove the Moriori away.)

This indicates that the Moriori established an agricultural society in the Chatham Islands after migrating *from* New Zealand.

Therefore, option B is the accurate answer. The passage explicitly mentions the Moriori establishing an agricultural society in the Chatham Islands.
"
"anuchhed anusar, moaharuko shikar garney toli pahilo vasindaharu kun sthanka thiye?","The correct answer is **A: mukhya bhumi (mainland)**.

The passage states: ""Yadyapi, naya pramanle sanket gardacha key moriori mukhya bhumi maorika euta samuha thee..."" which translates to ""However, new evidence suggests that Moriori were a group of Maori on the mainland...""
"
kasto awasthama pureland origamiko tarika prayog garda folderlai faida huncha?,"Correct answer is **A: folderley ekaipatakma dherai patyauna ruchauda (Foldersanga vikashit motor sipharu chha)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Peorland origami is designed for inexperienced folders and limited motor skills. It also mentions the goal was to help folders who have difficulty with complex, reverse folding.
* Option A directly addresses the problem Peorland origami solves: it allows folding a single sheet many times. This would be a huge benefit to someone with limited motor skills and difficulty with complex folds.
* Option B is not directly mentioned in the passage.
* Option C contradicts the purpose of Peorland origami, which is to simplify folding.
* Option D is also not consistent with the description of Peorland origami. It's meant to allow for multiple folds *on a single sheet*, not just a few.



"
nimna madhey kunley sahi tarikaley pureland origamilai varnan gardaina?,"Correct answer is **A: yo anubhavi folderharukolagi ho**

Here's why:

The description explicitly states that Peorland origami was developed to *help inexperienced folder workers*. Option A says it's *for experienced folders*, which is the opposite of what the text says.

Let's look at why the other options are correct descriptions:

* **B: yas tarikama ultobata patyauney samawesh hudaina** - The text says you can only fold one time per sheet and the folds are straight, so it doesn't involve folding from the reverse side.
* **C: patyauda sidha sthanharu hunuparcha** - This is directly stated in the text: ""sabai patyaune cam sidha sthanharuma huncha"" (all folds are in straight positions).
* **D: yo simit motor sipharu bhayeka folderharuko lagi ramro tarika ho** - The text explicitly says it was developed for inexperienced folder workers who used limited motor skills.

Therefore, only option A contradicts the provided description of Peorland origami."
"anuchhed anusaar, kun sthan sindhu ghati sabhyatasanga sambandhit chaina?","Correct Answer: **B: saraswati nadi**

**Explanation:**

The passage states that the Indus Valley Civilization was primarily located along the banks of the Indus River. While some scholars suggest settlements along the Saraswati River existed as well, the passage doesn't explicitly connect the Indus Valley Civilization *directly* to the Saraswati River in the same way it does with the Indus River. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: harappa:** The passage explicitly mentions Harappa as the first site of the Indus Valley Civilization and refers to it as the Harappan Civilization.
* **C: afaghanistanko uttarpurviko sabhai kshetraharu:** The passage states that parts of modern-day Pakistan and northwestern India *including* areas of northeastern Afghanistan were part of the Indus Valley Civilization.
* **D: adhunik yugko sabaijasto pakistan:** The passage specifically mentions Pakistan as a location where the Indus Valley Civilization flourished.



"
nimna madhey anuchhedma ullekhit gariyeko kun nam kans yug sabhyatako naam huna sambhav chaina?,"The correct answer is **C: sindhu nadi sabhyata**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions ""Indus Valley Civilization"" and ""Harappan Civilization.""** These are the established names used for the same civilization.
* **The passage also proposes the name ""Indus-Saraswati Civilization""** as a potential encompassing name if settlements are found along the Saraswati River.
* **""Indus nadi sabhyata"" (Indus River Civilization) is not mentioned in the passage** and doesn't align with the names used or discussed in the text. While the civilization developed along the Indus River, the standard and historically accepted names are Indus Valley Civilization and Harappan Civilization.

Therefore, ""sindhu nadi sabhyata"" is the least likely name to be used based on the provided information."
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kunley dirghakalin faida dincha?","Correct answer is **A: arusanga sahakarya garera (सहकार्यको प्रकृती ho)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""love ra swartha jahile pani hamisanga hunchha ra yo sahakaryako prakriti ho"" which translates to ""love and selfishness remain with us even when we have a lot of profit, and this is the nature of cooperation.""  The passage also mentions that many people feel they can achieve better long-term benefits by practicing fair dealings in small ways. Therefore, cooperation is presented as the key to long-term gain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aafno wyaktigat swartha lai prathamikta diyera (आफ्नो व्यक्तिगत स्वार्थलाई प्राथमिकता दिएर)** - This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. It contrasts with the idea of cooperation.
* **C: bahumatlai bhanda alpasankhyalai faida huney chijlai prathamikta diyera (बहुमतलाई भन्दा अल्पसंख्यलाई फाइदा हुने चिललाई प्राथमिकता दिएर)** - The passage doesn't mention prioritizing the benefit of a minority group.
* **D: lobh faidajanak huncha bhanera pahichan garera (लोभ फाइदाजनक हुन्छ भनेर पहिचान गरेर)** - The passage criticizes selfishness (""swartha"") and implies it is not a sustainable path to long-term benefit.



"
"anuchhed anusar, yedi kasailai turunttai faida chaiyeko cha vaney nimna madhey kasailey ke kuralai prathamikta dincha?","The correct answer is **B: sahayog (cooperation)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph emphasizes that Bahumatle labh uthaunda chhoto awadhima swarthy wyawahar garera adhik labh prapta gurney hunale love ra swartha jahile pani hamisanga hunchha ra yo **sahakaryako prakriti ho**.  This highlights cooperation as the key element.  While other options are mentioned, cooperation is presented as the underlying principle for achieving greater benefits and maintaining positive relationships.

* **Sahayog (cooperation)** is directly stated as the nature of this approach.
* **Ni:swarthata (selflessness)** is implied but not the primary focus.
* **Sahakarya (collaboration)** is a synonym for cooperation, but the broader term ""sahayog"" fits better.
* **Swartha (selfishness)** is presented as something to avoid, contrasting with the cooperative nature.



Therefore, **cooperation (sahayog)** is the most important aspect emphasized in the paragraph for achieving benefits."
"annuched anusar, yuddhako kharchako dherai bhar kasley uthayo?","The correct answer is **C: americi ko aupaniveshik sashan (U.S. aupanishwik shasan)**.

The passage states: ""Sanyukta rajya americi aupaniweshik shasanlai curr tirna badhya thee"" which translates to ""The United States American imperial government was able to collect currency.""  This means the U.S. imperial government bore a significant portion of the burden of the war expenses.

While the other options are mentioned as being involved, the passage explicitly states the US imperial government was the one collecting the funds.
"
kun samay awadhi templarsko yug bhanda agadi ayeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: suruwati madhya yug**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uccha madhya yug suruwati madhya yugbhanda bhanda aghadi suru bhayo..."". This directly translates to ""The High Middle Ages began *before* the Early Middle Ages...""

Therefore, the Early Middle Ages happened *before* the High Middle Ages (which is the period associated with the Templar era).
"
kun samay awadhi templursko yug pachhi ayeko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: pachhilo madhya yug (Late Middle Ages)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the High Middle Ages (the period influenced by the Templurs) was from 11th to 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).
* It also says the High Middle Ages came *after* the Early Middle Ages and *before* the Late Middle Ages.
* The passage mentions the period ended around 1500 according to the June tradition, which aligns with the timeframe of the Late Middle Ages.

Therefore, the period that came *after* the Templurs' era (High Middle Ages) was the Late Middle Ages.
"
roman samrajyako bela kun chikitsa upachar wa prakriyalai chikkitsak ra surgeonle prayog garney bhanera ullekhit garkiyeko chaina?,"The correct answer is **A: post-tramatic tanab viikarlai vibhinna sedativedwara upachar garnu (Treating post-traumatic stress disorder with various sedatives)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    *  The use of morphine and scopolomine for pain relief.
    *  Amputation and tourniquets for gangrene and hemorrhage.
    *  The creation of a Roman medical corps.

* **The passage *doesn't* mention:**  Treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) with sedatives. While they might have used substances to calm patients, the passage doesn't specify this particular application or mention PTSD at all.

Therefore, option A is the only treatment method *not* mentioned in the passage.
"
"annuched anusar, nimna madhey kun roman samrajyako bela chikitsa kshetrama vayeko vikashsanga sambandthit chaina?","The correct answer is **B: samrajyako akramak sainik niti (empire's aggressive military policy)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph specifically discusses the advancements in medicine *due to* the Roman army. It mentions the creation of a medical corps, the use of medicine during battles, and the skills of surgeons. These are all directly linked to the military's needs.

While a strong military policy might *indirectly* influence a society's development in various ways, the paragraph doesn't connect the ""aggressive military policy"" itself to the specific medical advancements discussed.  The other options (creation of a medical corps, emperor hiring doctors, and the creation of hospitals) are all mentioned as direct consequences of the Roman army's presence and needs.
"
dekhney khubi ke ma nirbhar chha?,"The correct answer is **A: drishya pranali sanwedanashik ang**.

Here's why:

The first paragraph states: ""Drishti wa herne kshamata drishya pranali sanwedanashik ang wa ankhama nirbhar garchha."" This translates to ""Vision and the ability to see depend on the sensory organs and eyes of the visual system.""

Therefore, the question ""dekhney khubi ke ma nirbhar chha?"" (What is vision dependent on?) has the most direct and accurate answer in option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jiwako awashyaktaharu** (The needs of the organism): While vision is important for the organism, it's not the primary thing vision *depends* on.
*   **C: kunai bisesh vebh-lambaiharusanga sanvedanashilta** (Sensitivity to specific wavelengths): Sensitivity to specific wavelengths is *part* of how vision works, but not what vision depends on in a broader sense.
*   **D: tikshnataka vibhinna degree** (Different degrees of acuity): Acuity (sharpness) is a *characteristic* of vision, not what it depends on.



"
jiwaharu bichko ankhako bhinnata kemaa nirbhar huncha?,"The correct answer is **A: vebhlambaiharusanga sanvedanshilta (Sensitivity to different wavelengths)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that different eye structures are sensitive to different wavelengths of light. This is the fundamental reason for the variation in vision capabilities between different organisms and even different types of eyes within the same organism.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: jiwako awashyaktaharu (Organisms' needs):** While organisms' needs *influence* eye evolution, the primary basis for the *difference* in eye structure isn't simply their needs. It's the specific wavelengths they need to detect.
* **C: tikshnatako star (Level of acuity/sharpness):** While acuity is a characteristic of vision, it's a *result* of the eye structure's sensitivity and processing, not the fundamental difference *between* eyes.
* **D: jiwako jatilta (Organism's complexity):**  Complexity is a general factor in evolution, but not the specific reason for different eye types.



Therefore, the ability to detect different wavelengths of light is the key factor determining the differences in eye structure.
"
"anuchhed anusar, sikh sambadhi kun kathanley tyas dharmalai sahi tarikaley darshaudaina?","The correct answer is **B: guru sikhsangako matra anupam adhar ho (Guru is the only basis for Sikh faith)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""guru sabai bharatiya dharmaharuka lagi ek adharbhut paksh ho tar sikh dharma ek mahatwako rupma lieko cha jasle sikh wishwasharuko mull roop banaunchha."" This translates to ""Guru is a fundamental aspect for all Indian religions, but Sikhism takes the Guru as a major aspect which forms the core of Sikh beliefs.""

The passage explicitly says the Guru is *a major aspect* and *forms the core* of Sikh belief, not the *only* basis. Options A, C, and D are all supported by the text.  The text mentions the Sikh religion started within Hinduism, the role of the nine gurus as successors to Guru Nanak, and the fact that Sikh traditions are connected to Hinduism.

Therefore, option B is the statement that *doesn't align* with the passage's description of Sikhism.
"
"anuchhed anusar, nimna madhey kun sikh dharma pranaliko mul swarup manincha?","The correct answer is **A: guruko awadharana (acceptance of the Guru)**.

The passage states: ""...sikh dharma ek mahatwako rupma lieko cha jasle sikh wishwasharuko mull roop banaunchha. Yo dharmako sthapana 15 aun shatabdima guru nanak (1469-1539) dwara bhaeko thiyo."" ( ...Sikh dharma is significantly regarded as the core of Sikh beliefs, forming the fundamental aspect of Sikh faith. This religion was established in the 15th century by Guru Nanak (1469-1539). )

This highlights the crucial role of the Guru (spiritual teacher) in shaping the core beliefs of Sikhism. While the other options are related to Sikhism, the passage explicitly connects the Guru to the foundational aspect of the faith.
"
"anuchhed anusar, dhyan kami hune gadbadi vayeka bachchaharulai ke kurama dhyan kendrit garna gahro huncha?","The correct answer is **A: vidalaya karya (school work)**.

The passage states: ""ADD bhaeka bachchaharusanga vidyalayako karya dhyan dine karya gahro hunchha tar tiniharu khel khelna wa mann parne cartoon herne wa viram chihna nalagai wakya lekhna manaparaune jasta kurama dhyan kendrit garna sakchhan."" 

This translates to: ""Children with ADD have a difficult time focusing on schoolwork, but they can focus on things like playing games, watching cartoons, or writing sentences with punctuation.""

Therefore, school work is the task they have a difficult time concentrating on.
"
"anuchhed anusar, dhyan kami hune gadbadi vayeka bachchaharu kina jokhimpurna vyavahar garney gardachhan?","The correct answer is **D: uniharuko dimaglai uttejit garna (because their brains are not stimulated by normal methods).**

The passage states: ""Yo sikaiko asakshamta hoina, yo sikaiko samasya ho; yasale """"sabai bachchaharuko 3 dekhi 5 pratishatlai asar gardacha, shayed 2 million jati dherai americi bachchaharu.""""

This clearly indicates that because their brains don't respond to typical stimulation, they act out to seek stimulation. Options A, B, and C are not supported by the text.
"
"anuchhedma bhayeko jankariko adharma, nimna madhye kun machanko udharharan hoina?","The correct answer is **B: SAT prashikshak**.

Here's why:

The passage describes scaffolds as support structures for learning, especially when tackling new and challenging tasks. The examples given are all about learning a *new skill or system*.

*   **A: computer khelko suruwatma bhayeko sikaai (Learning the basics of a computer game):** This is a clear example of learning a new skill, and scaffolds would be beneficial.
*   **C: euta swatantra aadhayan karyakram (A self-study program):** This involves learning something new independently, where scaffolds can provide support.
*   **D: euta sano league prashikshak (A small league coach):**  This implies teaching a new sport or skill to beginners. Scaffolding is frequently used in sports training.

*   **B: SAT prashikshak (SAT coach):** SAT coaching typically focuses on *reviewing and reinforcing existing knowledge and skills* related to standardized tests. While a coach provides guidance, the primary goal isn't learning a fundamentally new skill or system.  It's about improving performance on something already known.

Therefore, a SAT coach doesn't fit the concept of scaffolding as presented in the passage, which is about learning something *new*.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that scaffolds are *support* for learners, not a replacement for the learning process itself. They are a *tool* to facilitate learning, not a more helpful alternative to it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: machan virtually awasthit huna sakcha** (Scaffolds can be virtually located): This is directly mentioned in the text.
* **C: yeslai paryiyojanama adharit sikai pani vanincha** (It can also be called project-based learning): The text says ""Jabkiki pariyojanama adharit shikshale sikna sajilo ra adhik chakhalagdo banaunu parchha..."" (While learning project-based is easier and more engaging...).
* **D: machanlai sikai anubhavko suruwatma samarthan pradhan garnakolagi prayog garincha** (Scaffolds are used to provide support at the beginning of the learning experience):  This is also directly mentioned in the text: ""...shikshak machanko roop ho tar microsuft officema sano kagajpatra wyakti pani huncha. Virtual scaffolds suftwearma antarikaran garieko cha ra vidyarthilai eklai handle garna chunautipurna hoon sakne prakriyaharu prashna gurney, turuntai gurney ra wyakhya gurney uddeshyale garieko cha."" (...teacher is like a scaffold, but even a small paper person in Microsoft Office... Virtual scaffolds are integrated into software and are designed to help students handle challenging processes such as asking questions, getting hints, and receiving explanations.)



Therefore, option B is the only one that misrepresents the role of scaffolds as supportive tools rather than a replacement for the learning process.

"Anuchhed anusar texas kaa nagarik lai sambodhan garda, governor le kasto aashwasana dienan?","The correct answer is **B: Janata ko suraksha ko laagi kadam haru chalieka chhan** (Steps are being taken for the safety of the citizens).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Unle tee adhikariharusangai texuska nagarikharulai janatako surakshalai raksha garna kadam chalieko ashwasana die."" This directly translates to ""He assured the citizens of Texas that steps are being taken to protect their safety.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pranali le ramrari kaam gareko chhaina** (The system has not done a good job): The passage explicitly says the system *is* working to address the challenge.
* **C: Uniharu chunauti ko saamana garna susajjit chhan** (They are prepared to face the challenge): While the Governor acknowledges the challenge, the focus of his assurance is on the steps being *taken* for protection, not readiness.
* **D: Visaya gambhir chhaina** (The matter is not serious): The Governor repeatedly calls the situation ""gambhir"" (serious).



"
UW kaa dui purva vidhyarthi le samachar ko parody garne kun karyakram ko nirman gare?,"The correct answer is **D: The Onion**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yasako sthapana pachhi, onion mudran sanskaranko sathama, ek yathartha samachar parody samrajya baneko cha, ek website jasle..."" which translates to ""After its establishment, along with the tradition of onion printing, a realistic news parody empire was created, a website that..."" The text then goes on to describe The Onion's success.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun the onion ko samachar parody garne samrajya maa samawesh thiena?","The correct answer is **B: Chalchitra (Movies)**.

The passage explicitly states that The Onion established a ""samachar parody samrajya"" (news parody empire) which includes a website, 24-hour news network, podcasts, and ""halasalai vishwa atlas"" (a silent world atlas). It doesn't mention movies being part of this empire. The options A, C, and D are all mentioned in the passage.
"
Anuchhed anusar prahari le keko surakshya gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Downing street prawesh dwaar (Downing street gate)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Pradhanmantriko adhikarik niwassthan, Downing stritma praharidwara sanrakshit praeshdwarko viparit raheko..."" which translates to ""The Prime Minister's official residence, opposite the guarded gate of the residential area on Downing Street...""  This clearly indicates that the police were guarding the gate of Downing Street.

The other options are locations where the protest *moved* to, but the initial security was focused on Downing Street's gate.
"
Sawari chap huna nadina prahari le kati bela pradarshankaari haru laai aghi badhna bhaneko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 baje**.

The text states: ""11:20 maa, praharile pradarshankariharulai traffic badhdai gaeko hunda virodh-pradarshanko adhikarlai santulanma rakhna awashyak bhaeko ullekha gardai sadakbhanda bahira sarna anurodh gare."" This translates to: ""At 11:20, the police, mentioning the traffic was increasing, requested the protesters to leave the road to maintain balance of the protest.""
"
Dr. Ehud Ur le gareko anusandhan bare ke sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Daibetes nabhaeka kehi musa lai ahile daibetes chha** (Some mice who didn't have diabetes now have it).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Helifax, Nova Scotia sthit Dalhousie Universityka aushadhi-upchar pradhyapak ra Canadian Diabetes (Madhumeha) Associationko clinical ra vaigyanik divisionka adhyaksha dah. ehud urle anusandhan ajhai suruko dinma nai raheko chetawani die.

This translates to: ""Dr. Ehud Ur, head of the Department of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and Chairman of the Clinical and Scientific Division of the Canadian Diabetes (Diabetes) Association, warned that this research is still in its early stages. Keeping in mind that these studies are not directly applicable to people who have already had type 1 diabetes, just like other scientists, he also expressed concern that some other mice who didn't have diabetes earlier now have it.""

Therefore, Dr. Ur's research indicates that some mice that *didn't* have diabetes initially *now* have it, which is a concerning finding. The other options are incorrect based on the text.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, Dr. Ur lai ke maa sankaa chha?","Correct answer is **A: Yadi yea natijaa type 1 diabetes bhaeka manislai sandarbhik chha.**

The paragraph states: ""Yea khojharu phile nai type 1 madhumeha bhaeka wyaktiharusanga sandarbhik chhainan bhane kura dhyanma rakhdai kehi any vigyaharu jastai uni pani madhumeha niko hoon sakha key bhanera shankaspad chan.""  This translates to: ""While some other scientists keep in mind that these findings are not directly applicable to people with type 1 diabetes, Dr. Ur is concerned that even if it is, it could still be dangerous.""

Therefore, Dr. Ur is concerned *if* the results are applicable to people with type 1 diabetes. The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
Flight CG4684 ko durghatana baare kun wakyale sahi rupmaa varnan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Plane le durghatana hunu aghi tin patak awataran garne prayas gareko thiyo** (The plane tried to land three times before the accident).

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states:** ""...tar phile nai ekpatak rokieko thiyo. Dosro patak awataran gurney prayas garnuparne samayabhanda jhandai dash minetaghi yo vimaan harayo."" ( ...but it stalled once. The plane lost altitude ten minutes earlier than scheduled for the second attempt to land.) This indicates the plane tried landing *twice* before crashing.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Plane mausam ko karanle awataran garna asafal bhaeko thiyo** (The plane failed to land due to weather) -  ""Khoj pani tyahi kharab mausamko karanle awarodhit bhaeko thiyo jasle akal awataran garaeko thiyo."" (The search was also hindered due to bad weather, which made it difficult to land.)
* **B: Plane nikai durgam sthal maa durghatana bhaeko thiyo** (The plane crashed in a very remote location) - ""Durghatana sthal az pahichan garieko thiyo tar tyahan pugna yati kathina cha..."" (The accident site was identified, but it is so difficult to reach there...)
* **D: Plane durghatana bhaeko sthaan ko khoji karya lai mausam le asar gareko thiyo** (The weather affected the search for the accident site) - ""Khoj pani tyahi kharab mausamko karanle awarodhit bhaeko thiyo jasle akal awataran garaeko thiyo."" (The search was also hindered due to bad weather, which made it difficult to land.)



Therefore, option C is the only statement that is **not** supported by the information provided in the passage.
"
Flight CG4684 ko awataran ke karan le rokiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Awataran garne sthan maa napugnale (Unable to reach the landing site)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tar phile nai ekpatak rokieko thiyo. Dosro patak awataran gurney prayas garnuparne samayabhanda jhandai dash minetaghi yo vimaan harayo.""  This translates to: ""but it was halted once. The second time, this plane crashed ten minutes earlier than it should have landed."" This implies the plane couldn't reach the planned landing site on the second attempt.

While the passage mentions bad weather hindering the search, it doesn't state that bad weather *caused* the initial failure to land.  The delay in landing and subsequent crash suggest a problem reaching the landing zone. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
Anuchhed anusaar Franciszek kowal ko anubhav sambandhi kun wakya sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Jhyaal bhatkauna khojdaa unlai chot lagyo.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maile manisharu bahira niskanka lagi jhyal futauna koshis gareko darlagdo drishya dekhe. Manisharu kursile jhyalko shishama hirkaundai thee, tar jhyalharu todna nasakine khalka thee."" This translates to: ""I saw a terrifying scene where people were trying to break out through the windows. The people were clinging to the glass of the windows on the chairs, but the windows were unbreakable.""

The final sentence says: ""antat: euta flake bhanchiyo ra uniharu jhyalbata bahira niscan thale"" which translates to: ""Finally, a flake said and they escaped from the window.""

This implies the people *tried* to break the windows (jhyal bhatkauna koshis gareko) and likely suffered injury (chot lagyo) in the process, as the windows were unbreakable. Option A is incorrect because they did *not* succeed in breaking out. Option B is not mentioned in the passage. Option C is not supported by the text; the passage doesn't mention a chair being broken.
"
Ushna pradeshiya toofan danielle ko asar mapan garna kina chunautipurna chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Vaigyaanik haru toofan maa nirantar chalne batas bare anishchit chhan (Scientists are uncertain about the constantly changing winds in the storm)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Daniel andhibehari budhabararasammama jhan shaktishali hunechha bhanera bhavishyavani gare."" (Forecasters predict Daniel will intensify by Wednesday.)  It also mentions the storm is 40 miles per hour, but that it's a rapidly changing situation.  The uncertainty about the winds is the core challenge in predicting the storm's impact.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Toofan shaktishaali bhaera aandhi aaune anuman garieko chha (The storm is predicted to be strong and bring a storm).** While the storm is predicted to be strong, this doesn't directly explain *why* assessing its impact is challenging.
*   **C: Toofan landfall bata tadha chha (The storm is far from landfall).** The distance from landfall is a factor, but the rapid changes in the storm's winds are the primary concern for impact assessment.
*   **D: Toofan miyami bata nikai tadha awasthit chha (The storm is located a considerable distance from Miami).**  The storm's distance from Miami is relevant, but not the main reason for the challenge of assessing its impact.



"
Anuchhed anusar tala dieko madhye kun wakya ushna pradeshiya toofan danielle ko baare sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Caribbean maa yasko asar baare jankaari chhaina (There is no information about its impact in the Caribbean).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sanyukta rajya america wa caribeanma andhibehari pahirobata tadha bhaekale sambhawit prabhawa aklan garna gahro bhaeko chha."" (The potential impact of the storm on the United States America and Caribbean has been deeply assessed.) This means there *is* information about its impact on the Caribbean, even if the passage doesn't detail it.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Yo atlantic mahasagar maa baneko thiyo (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean):** The passage says, ""ushna pradeshiya toofan daniel purvi atlantic mahasagarma banieko cha."" (The tropical storm Daniel formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.)
* **C: Yo andhi maa parinat huna sakchha (It can develop into a storm):** The passage states, ""Rashtriya aandhi kendraka vaigyanikharule deniel andhibehari budhabararasammama jhan shaktishali hunechha bhanera bhavishyavani gare."" (National Storm Center scientists forecast that Daniel will become stronger by Wednesday.)
* **D: Yo landfall sanga najik chha (It is close to landfall):** The passage mentions, ""Sanyukta rajya america wa caribeanma andhibehari pahirobata tadha bhaekale sambhawit prabhawa aklan garna gahro bhaeko chha."" (The potential impact of the storm on the United States America and Caribbean has been deeply assessed.) This implies it's approaching land.



"
"Anuchhed anusar,vishwawyapi mahamari bannu aghi rog laai ke hunu parne sujhaav garieko chha?","Correct Answer: **A: Yo kam ghatak bannu parchha**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Kehi adhyayanle yo rog vishwawyapi mahamariko karan hunubhanda phile come ghatak hunupardacha bhane sujhawa dinchhan..."" which translates to ""Some studies suggest that this disease is less dangerous than causing a global pandemic...""

Therefore, the passage suggests that the disease needs to be *less dangerous* (kam ghatak) to potentially cause a global pandemic. Options B, C, and D are incorrect based on the information provided.
"
Anuchhed anusar fujian bata andhi kati tadha thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: 9 kilometer**.

The passage states: ""August 9 co ratisamma morakotko aankha chiniyan pranta fujianbata kariva sattari kilometer tadha thiyo."" This translates to ""On August 9th, the eye of the storm was 70 kilometers from the coastal area of Fujian.""  The question asks how far the storm was *from* Fujian, which is stated as 70 kilometers. However, the question itself seems slightly misleading as it asks ""andhi kati tadha thiyo"" which translates to ""how far was the storm?"". The distance from Fujian to the eye of the storm is 70 kilometers. Option A is the closest provided distance, suggesting the initial statement was misinterpreted or there's a slight error in the question/options. Assuming the question is asking for the distance from the coastal area, 70 km is the correct answer.  However, since 70 is not an option, and the statement says the eye was *70 kilometers from Fujian*, there seems to be an error in the provided choices. If we interpret ""fujianbata kariva sattari kilometer tadha thiyo"" as meaning that the storm was 70 kilometers *away* from Fujian, then the distance is 70 km.



Let's re-evaluate. The question asks ""Anuchhed anusar fujian bata andhi kati tadha thiyo?"". This means ""According to the passage, how far was the storm from Fujian?"". The passage says ""sattari kilometer tadha thiyo"" which means ""was 70 kilometers away."" However, the choices are not 70.

If we assume the text is saying the storm was 70 kilometers away *and* the passage also mentions the speed of the typhoon (11 km/h), this might suggest a misunderstanding of the core question. Let's look at the available choices again.

If the passage is saying that the storm was 70 kilometers away, and the question asks ""how far was the storm from Fujian?"", then the answer is 70 kilometers. Since 70 is not an option, let's consider if there's a typo in the text. ""sattari kilometer tadha thiyo"" is ""70 kilometers away"".

Given that 70 is not an option, there's an issue. However, if we look at option A which states 9 kilometers, we have to question the initial assumption. Let us try to find what may have occurred in the passage. 

The passage says ""sattari kilometer tadha thiyo."" That means 70 kilometers. Perhaps there is a typo in the question itself and the question meant to ask about a different detail. 

However, since the passage does state that the distance is 70 kilometers away from Fujian and 70 is not available, let's review the choices. 

The options are:
A. 9
B. 11
C. 70
D. Other

If option C were available, that would be the correct one. Since it's not, it seems there is an issue.

Let's reconsider our understanding. The passage states: ""sattari kilometer tadha thiyo."" meaning ""was 70 kilometers away"". It also states: ""11 km/h"". It is possible the question is implying a relationship between these two pieces of information. Since the prompt does not give relationship or option for speed, we have to look at the first premise: ""70 kilometers away"".
Given the options, and knowing the passage states 70 kilometers away from Fujian, but 70 is not available as a choice, the best assessment is that the question is incorrect, or has a typo.

If we are required to pick an option, we must consider what it might mean.

It is possible that the text is saying that the speed of the typhoon is related to the distance away, but that relationship is not explained, which could be due to a typo. 

Since option A is 9 km and option B is 11 km/h. Considering the typhoon's speed is relevant, perhaps the typo is with speed.

**Given the available information and options"
George w bush asia aaipugda kasle swagat gare?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng ra Lee Hsien Loong**.

The passage states: ""Unlai singapurka upapradhanmantri Wong Kan Sengley swagat gare ra singapurka pradhanmantri lie sien lung (Lee Hsien Loong) sang wyapar ra atankaatankawadsambandhi muddaharuko barema chhalfal gare.""  This translates to ""He was welcomed by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and held discussions with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on trade and terrorism.""
"
Rashtrapati le asia ko wyapar wista bare kahile bole?,"The correct answer is **A: Singapore aae pachhi**.

The passage states: ""Unlai singapurka upapradhanmantri Wong Kan Sengley swagat gare ra singapurka pradhanmantri lie sien lung (Lee Hsien Loong) sang wyapar ra atankaatankawadsambandhi muddaharuko barema chhalfal gare. Madhyawadhi chunawama hareko ek satapachhi busle ek darshaklai asiako wyaparka wistarko barema batae.""

This indicates the President discussed Asia's trade during his visit to Singapore. Options B and C are incorrect because the discussion happened *after* the arrival in Singapore and after the election, respectively. Option D is too general.
"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye kun sarkar ko samgra laxya ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhuwani ko bhid ghataune (Reduce the congestion of sound)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that the Thap (likely referring to a system or initiative) is being expanded to help overcome the obstacles to the implementation of the ""Gurney Pratibad"" (Gurney Pledge).  It also mentions that 1300 dhuwani (likely a unit related to sound or noise) will be needed to alleviate congestion. Therefore, the overall goal is to reduce the congestion/crowding caused by sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yo varsha ko march samma maa dhuwani maa thap lagaani garne (To invest in sound in March this year):** This is only a part of the action, not the overall goal.
* **B: Kul 300 dhuwani lyaune (To get a total of 300 dhuwani):** This refers to a specific quantity and doesn't capture the bigger picture.
* **C: Thap 1300 dhuwani lyaune (The Thap will get 1300 dhuwani):** This is also a specific detail and doesn't represent the overarching aim.



"
Sarkar le ke ghosana garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Uniharu ko thap 1300 dhuwani maa lagani garne yojana chha** (They have a plan to invest 1300 dhuwani in 1300 days).

Here's why:

* **The question asks what the government announced.** The original text states: ""Thap 300 ley badhi bhidbhadbata chhutkara paunaka lagi cool 1300 dhuwani sadhana lyaundachha"" which translates to ""The government has a cool plan to invest 1300 dhuwani in 1300 days to get rid of the increasing congestion.""
* **Option C directly reflects this statement.** It accurately states the investment amount and the timeframe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uniharu ko aru thap 300 dhuwani maa lagani garne yojana chha** (They have a plan to invest 300 dhuwani in other measures in 300 days) - This is incorrect because the text explicitly mentions 1300 dhuwani and 1300 days, not 300.
* **B: Uniharu dhuwani ko samasya kam garna pratibada chhan** (They have a commitment to reduce the problem of congestion) - This is too general. While the government *has* a commitment, the announcement is about the *specific plan* to invest 1300 dhuwani.
* **D: Bhid ko samasya march samma maa hal hune chha** (The problem of congestion will be solved by March) - This is not mentioned in the text. The text focuses on a plan to address the congestion, not a specific timeframe for its resolution.



"
Anuchhed anusar ke jankari thaha chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jokhim ko star ghateko chha (The level of risk has decreased)**.

Here's why:

* **""gambhir khatarako star ghatnuko matlab sabai dhamkiharu haraeka chan bhane chain ho""** translates to ""The meaning of the serious danger level decreasing is not that all threats have disappeared."" This implies the risk is lower, but threats still exist.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kunaini jokhim chhaina (There is no risk):** The passage explicitly states that threats haven't disappeared, meaning there *is* still risk.
* **C: Euta aakraman ko apeksha garieko chha (An attack is expected):** The passage doesn't say an attack is expected. It only mentions the risk level has decreased.
* **D: Guptachar le gambhir aakraman hune pushti gareko chha (Intelligence has confirmed a serious attack):**  The passage denies that all threats have disappeared, so it doesn't confirm a serious attack.

Therefore, the most accurate conclusion is that the level of risk has decreased, but threats remain."
Pradarshan sambandhi kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The incorrect statement regarding the protests is **B: Chunawa dhilo hunale pradarshan lai utprerit garyo (Protests were triggered because the elections were delayed).**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the protests started due to the government's response to anti-government protests. It also mentions that failures to hold elections successfully (going back to 2011) were a contributing factor to the violent demonstrations.  It **doesn't** directly link the protests to the elections being delayed.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Rashtrapatiya aayog pradarshan ko jawaaf thiyo (The Presidential Commission responded to the protests):** The passage explicitly says the Presidential Commission was formed *in response* to the anti-government protests.
* **C: Pradarshankari haru le yas aghiko CEP ko rajinama mag gare (The protesters demanded the resignation of this commission):** The passage states the President recommended the resignation of the current CEP. It implies the protests were connected to this recommendation.
* **D: Pradarshan kehi hinsrak thiyo (The protests were somewhat violent):** The passage mentions ""hinsrak pradarshanharu suru bhae (violent demonstrations began).""



Therefore, option B is the statement that is *not* supported by the passage.



"
Pachhillo CEP le rajinama dinu parne kasle sujhaae?,"The correct answer is **C: Rashtrapatiya aayog (Presidential Commission)**.

The passage states: ""Gaeko mahina rashtrapatiya ayogle deshlai naya chunawatira laijane upayako packageko rupma aghillo CEP ko rajinama sifaris gareko thiyo."" This translates to: ""Last month, the Presidential Commission recommended to the President a package of measures to hold new elections, including the resignation of the current CEP.""
"
Anucched anusar USA gyamnastics nassar dwaara kheladi ko durvyavahaar pachhi ke ko samarthan gardaina?,"Correct Answer: **A: Vighatan (Disciplinary action)**

The passage states: ""hammy USOC ko kathansanga sahamat chhaun **key wighatan bhanda baru** hamra athlete ra clubharuko hit ra tiniharuko khel sayed hamro sangha bhitra arthapurna pariwartanko sath aghi badhera ajha ramro sewa dina sakinchha.""

This translates to: ""We agree with USOC's challenges **rather than disciplinary action**, our athletes and club members' interests and their sports can move forward with meaningful changes with us, and provide even better service.""

Therefore, USA Gymnastics does *not* support disciplinary action as the primary response to the abuse scandal. They prefer to focus on broader systemic changes. They *do* support independent investigations, creating a safe environment, and necessary organizational improvements.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, agadi badhda USA gymnastics ra sanyukta rajya america olympic samiti ko pramukh laxya ke ho?","The correct answer is **D: Kheladika lagi surakshit watawaran ko pravardhan garne (To foster a safe environment for athletes).**

The paragraph explicitly states: ""USA Gymnastics le swatantra anusandhanlai samarthan gardacha, june leri nasarka bacheka manisharule yati sahasapurwak dhangle warnan garieko matrako durupayoglai kasari yati lamo samayasamma patta lagauna nasakeko bhane kurama prakash parna sakdachha ra kunai awashyak ra upayukta pariwartanlai angaldachha. **USA Gymnastics ra USOC ko eutai lakshya chha: kheladiharu surakshit, sakaratmak ra sashakta watawaranma khelera afno sapana sakar gurney dishatarfa aghi badhna sakun bhanera gymnastic ra any khelharu sakdo surakshit banaune.**""

This clearly indicates that creating a safe environment for athletes is the primary goal of both USA Gymnastics and the US Olympic Committee.

While options A, B, and C touch upon elements mentioned in the paragraph (independent investigations, reforms, etc.), they are not the overarching, primary goal. The core objective is athlete safety.
"
Durghatana huda jahaz kata jadai thiyo? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states: ""Avenger class mine countermeasures जहाज Palawan Porto Princessaka lagi yatrama giraheko thiyo."" This translates to ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ship was heading to Palawan Porto Princess.""
"
Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaeko jahaz baare ke sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **B: yo palawan maa aadharit thiyo** (it was based in Palawan).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Avenger class mine countermeasures jahaz palawan porto princessaka lagi yatrama gairaheko thiyo."" which translates to ""The Avenger class mine countermeasures ship was going to Palawan Porto Princess for a deployment."" 

This means the ship was *going to* Palawan Porto Princess, not *based in* Palawan. The passage also explicitly states that the ship is a mine countermeasures vessel (C). The ship is going to Palawan, not Palawan itself.
"
Kasle americi sena sambandhi vigyapti die?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The text states: ""Americaka rashtrapati donald trample, press sachivamarfat dieka vigyaptima..."" which translates to ""The President of America, Donald Trump, announced in a statement through his press secretary...""
"
Anuchhed anunsar kun desh le bandi ladaku lai surakshya dine jimewari liyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The passage states: ""Turkeyle pakrau garieka ISIS ladakuharuko suraksha gurney cam pani garnechha..."" which translates to ""Turkey also pledged to safeguard captured ISIS fighters...""
"
Durghatana ko kaaran ke ho bhanne anumaan gariyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Kharaab mausam (Bad weather)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Durghatana hune kshetraka lagi khoji garna prayas garda kharab mausam ra apthyaro bhu-bhag bhetinchha."" This translates to: ""While trying to search the area where the accident occurred, bad weather and unfavorable terrain were encountered.""

While unfavorable terrain is mentioned, the bad weather is presented as a significant obstacle hindering the search and likely contributing to the difficulty in recovery efforts. The passage doesn't explicitly state the *cause* of the accident, but it highlights the challenging weather conditions.

Therefore, while the other options are factors encountered, **bad weather** is the most directly mentioned and implied reason for the difficulties and potential impact on the accident. The question asks for an *assumption* about the cause, and bad weather is a likely contributing factor given the context."
Durghatana kasto bhubhaag maa bhayo?,"The correct answer is **D: Himali**.

The passage states: ""Yo durghatana uccha himali ilakama bhayo..."" which translates to ""This accident happened in the high Himalayan region...""

Therefore, the accident occurred in the **Himalayan** region.
"
Adhikaariharule badhi ko karan le ke hune aash garekaa chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandabar ko punarsthapana (Restoration of sandbars)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Talmar sandbar tatha samudri kinarko sirjana garna awashyak thiyo, jasle wanyajantuko awaska rupma cam garthyo."" (It was necessary to create Talmar sandbars and coastal areas, which provided habitat for wildlife). 

Later, it mentions that officials hoped to ""baluwaka barko bandha bhatkaunaka lagi paryapta hunechha"" (it would be sufficient to prevent the sandbars from being further eroded).  This implies they are hoping to restore the sandbars, not increase humpback whale populations or coastal areas for other reasons.  The loss of fish species is mentioned as a consequence of the initial dam construction, but the officials' hope relates to preventing further erosion of the sandbars.
"
Baadh ko nirman le ke laai sthai rupmaa asar garyo?,"Correct answer is **A: Sandbar**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Talmar sandbar tatha samudri kinarko sirjana garna awashyak thiyo, jasle wanyajantuko awaska rupma cam garthyo.""  This translates to ""It was necessary to create sandbars and marine coasts, which provided shelter for wild animals.""
* The question asks what the dam's construction had a *permanent* impact on. The creation of sandbars is a lasting result of the dam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Humpback chubs:** The passage mentions humpback chubs as being endangered, but it doesn't say the dam's construction *permanently* impacted them. They were affected indirectly through the ecosystem changes.
* **C: Jungli wanyajantu ko vasthan (Wild animal habitat):** While the sandbars provided habitat, the question asks about a *permanent* impact. The impact on habitats might be complex and not solely defined by the sandbar creation.
* **D: Padartha ko failawat (Debris deposition):**  The passage says the dam *prevented* debris deposition, not that it caused a permanent impact *from* it.



"
Anuchhed anusar sanyukta rajya america lai kasle sambhavit aakraman baare suchana diyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Naknhulaaieko srot (Unknown source)**.

The text states: ""Yu.ess. bhancha, usale ek agyat srotabata jankari prapta gareko cha..."" which translates to ""The U.S. said that it received information from an unknown source...""

Therefore, the United States received the information about a potential attack from an unknown source.
"
Tala die madhye kunle atiwadi haru ko sambhawit aakraman ko yojana laai sahi rupmaa varman garchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Dui muluk kaa pramukh sthaan harumaa bomb visfot garne**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yu.ess. bhancha, usale ek agyat srotabata jankari prapta gareko cha, jasle visheshgari ethiopia ra kenya maa **""""pramukh sthalharu"""" udaunaka lagi atmaghati bum hamalawarharuko prayogka bare ullekha gardacha.**""

This translates to: ""The U.S. says that it has received information from an unknown source, which specifically mentions the use of suicide bombings to attack **""key locations"" in Ethiopia and Kenya**.""

Therefore, the most accurate option is that the planned attacks are on key locations in *both* countries (Ethiopia and Kenya).
"
Tala die madhye kun vyakti Wakil hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

*   **Petros Mantouvalos** is identified as a ""sanad sadasya ra wakil"" which translates to ""Member of Parliament and lawyer.""
*   **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** are mentioned as being imprisoned for corruption charges, implying they are likely lawyers or involved in legal matters.
*   **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is identified as a journalist who revealed information about illegal activities. He is not described as a lawyer.



"
Kun samuha kaa manis lai greek ko kanun samudaya maa hune ghotala maa ullekh garidaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Patrakar**.

Here's why:

* The text mentions lawyers (wakil), judges (nyayadhish), and prosecutors (adhivakta) being involved in the corruption scandal.
* It specifically mentions journalist Makis Triantafylopoulos *reporting* on the corruption, but not being *involved* in it. He is the one exposing the corruption, not participating in it.
* While journalists *can* be victims of corruption or involved in scandals, the text focuses on the individuals directly implicated in the legal system's corruption.



"
Bharat le kati wicket gumaayo?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The question states: ""Tar kaptanko wicket gumaepachhi bharatle 7 wicket gumaera..."" which translates to ""After losing the captain's wicket, India lost 7 wickets..."".
"
Anucched anusaar innings ko uccha score kati thiyo?,"The correct answer is **A: 70 run**.

The passage states: ""Robin Uthappale 11 chauka ra 2 chakka hanera matra 41 balma **70 run** banaundai inningko uchchatam anka banae."" This translates to ""Robin Uthappale scored 70 runs in just 41 balls by hitting 11 fours and 2 sixes, making it the highest score of the innings.""
"
Tala die madhye kun Adam cuerden ko nirasha ko karan hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: Wales le kura nasunnu (Wales didn't deny it)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the administrator expressed frustration over two things:

1.  Wales lied from the beginning.
2.  He pretended it was a legal matter while pursuing his own artistic goals.

Option C, ""Wales didn't deny it,"" is presented as a *falsehood* (""yo kanuni karanka lagi ho bhanera abhinaya garyo"" - ""he pretended it was a legal matter""). Therefore, the administrator's frustration stems *from* the denial or lack of acknowledgement, not from Wales simply not denying something. The other options (the new media policy, Wales removing art, and the lie about it being a legal matter) are all directly mentioned as sources of the administrator's disappointment.



"
Anuchhed anusar site bata ke hataieko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **B: youn samagri (youn material)**.

The passage states: ""Samudayako jalanle siteka lagi youn samagrika barema niti nirman garna halka prayasharu nimtyayo jasle lakhaun khula-ijajat prapta media host gardacha."" This translates to: ""The community council has made slight efforts to formulate a policy regarding **youn material** for the site, which has hosted millions of freely accessible media.""

The passage doesn't mention removing ""kala"" (art), ""niti ko masyauda"" (policy's essence), or ""niji swamitwo maa raheko media"" (media remaining in private ownership). Therefore, the most accurate answer is youn samagri.
"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye amir khan le kun kurako samarthan gardainan?,"The correct answer is **B: Belayati pratispardhi (British competitors)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Amir Khan suggested he wouldn't argue with women (""malai mahilale jhagada garnu hundaina bhane lagchha""). However, later it mentions that in the 2012 London Olympics, he offered *help to the British competitors*.  This contradicts option B, which suggests he supported the British competitors' efforts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Olympic maa mahila kheladi lai samawesh garne (Including women in the Olympics):**  The passage explicitly states Amir Khan supports this (""Mahilaharuka shreniharuko samaweshikaranma sabai samarthak thienan"").
* **C: Mahilako vichar (Women's opinion):** The passage mentions Amir Khan's statement about not arguing with women, implying he acknowledges and considers women's opinions.
* **D: London le olympic ko aayojana garne (London hosting the Olympics):** This is mentioned as the location of the 2012 Olympics, but there's no statement about Amir Khan supporting London's role in hosting.



Therefore, the only thing Amir Khan *didn't* support, according to the passage, is directly assisting the British competitors in the 2012 London Olympics.
"
Anuchhed anusar amir khan le aafno vyaktigat vichar kaa vabjud kun kura ko samarthan garne chhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Mahila kheladi (Female athletes)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Amir Khan said, ""It seems like he (referring to someone, likely a male) wouldn't want to fight a woman.""  The author then mentions that despite this statement, Amir Khan offered help to a British competitor in the 2012 London Olympics.  This implies that Amir Khan's initial statement was a reflection of his personal views on women in sports, and the subsequent offer of help shows a willingness to support female athletes despite his earlier remark.

Therefore, the passage suggests he *supports* female athletes, even if his initial statement was somewhat prejudiced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 2004 ko olympic kaa unka saathi pratispardhi (His competitor from the 2004 Olympics):** The text doesn't mention any support for a competitor from the 2004 Olympics.
* **C: 2012 ko olympic (The 2012 Olympics):** While he offered help *during* the 2012 Olympics, this doesn't mean he inherently supports the Olympics itself. It's related to his views on athletes.
* **D: Aru rajat padak vijeta (Other silver medal winners):** There's no mention of support for other silver medal winners.



"
Peter Lenz ko mrityu kahile bhayo?,"Correct answer is **A: Warm-up lap ko belama (During the warm-up lap)**.

The provided text states: ""Afno warm-up lyapma hunda, lenz afno bikebata khase..."" which translates to ""While doing his warm-up, Lenz fell off his bike..."" This indicates the accident happened during the warm-up lap.
"
Xavier Zayat ko hun?,"Correct answer is **B: Arko dhawak (Another racer)**.

The passage states: ""racer saathi javier jayatle hane."" which translates to ""crashed with racer Javier Zayat."" Therefore, Javier Zayat is another racer.
"
Kun awasthama ek daraeko hawaai yaatru le hawai jahaz ko bhitri jankaari faidajanak hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Yadi hawai yatra namanparaune karan agyat ko dar ho.**

Here's why:

The passage states that fear of the unknown and uncontrollable is a primary cause of anxiety about flying. Option B directly addresses this by mentioning fear of the flight itself.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Yadi yatru aafno darko karan le lajjit mahasus garchan:**  While embarrassment can contribute to anxiety, it's not the central theme of the passage which focuses on the fear of flying itself.
* **C: Yadi yaatru sabai kisimko yatayat man paraudainan:**  A general unwillingness to travel might cause anxiety, but the passage emphasizes fear specifically related to *flying*.
* **D: Yadi unko dar udan sanga asambabdhit aru kuna pidadayi ghatana ko karan le ho:** The passage mentions fear of the unknown and uncontrollable, which aligns more closely with the fear of flying than a fear stemming from unrelated traumatic events.



"
Anuchhed anusar mulya bare sachet yatri le kun kura antim maa garchan?,"Correct answer is **C: vibhinna travel company haru ko mulya tulana garne** (Compare the prices of different travel companies).

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that sometimes, even after searching and comparing prices on a website, you still have to pay for the booking.
* This implies that travelers should actively compare prices *before* booking to avoid unexpected costs.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Dherai travel company ko prastav khojne (Searching for offers from many travel companies):** While searching for offers is a good idea, the paragraph focuses on *comparing prices* among the offers.
* **B: wayusewa sanga sidhai book garne (Booking directly with the service provider):** The paragraph doesn't mention booking directly. It discusses using websites to search and compare.
* **D: wayusewa ko website check garne (Checking the website of the service provider):** Checking a website is part of the process, but the core action the paragraph highlights is price comparison.



"
Anuchhed anusar yaatru harule hawai yatra ko sabai bhanda raamro mulya prapta garna sabai bhanda pahile ke garnu parchha?,"Correct Answer: **B: vibhinna ektrikarankarta ko mulya tulana garne**

Here's why:

The paragraph states that sometimes different aggregators (ektrikarankarta) offer different prices for the same flight. It also mentions that users might have to pay to see the search results on the website they use to compare prices and book. Therefore, the best first step to find the cheapest flight is to compare the prices offered by various aggregators.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: wayusewa ko website check garne** - While checking airline websites is good, the paragraph implies that aggregators might have better deals.
*   **C: wayusewa baata sidhai book garne** - The paragraph says you *might* have to pay to see the results on the airline's website, making it not the best first step to find the best price.
*   **D: Travel agent sanga sidhai book garne** - The paragraph doesn't mention travel agents.

"
Kahile delivery sangai sahayatri ko awashyakta parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaba saman hawai dhuwani marfat pathainchha (When goods are sent via air cargo).**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yadi tiniharule kehi margharubata hawai dhuwanima samanharu pathaema, yasalai unloading garna ra bhansarmarfat dherai dina lagna sakha."" (If they send goods via air cargo from some locations, it can take a long time to unload them and transport them by land.)  This indicates that assistance is *needed* when using air cargo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Jaba company le afnai plane ko prayog garchha (When the company uses its own plane):** The text implies this is *not* always a solution, as problems exist on other routes.
*   **C: Jaba saman lai janch gareko saman kaa rupmaa pathainchha (When goods are sent as checked baggage):** The text mentions sending goods as checked baggage is a way to expedite the process, but doesn't describe a situation where assistance is *required*.
*   **D: Jaba delivery thulo company le samhalchha (When a large company handles the delivery):** The text highlights that even large companies face problems with certain routes.



"
Anuchhed anusar gathabandhan maa Frequen flyer wayusewa ko chanot garda kun kura lai prathamikta dinu parchha?,"Correct answer is **C: Aafule sabai bhahda dherai yatra garne wayusewa (A frequent flyer wayusewa)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph emphasizes that frequent flyer programs are beneficial *if* you fly often. The text states: ""Tapainlai dherai udan garnubhaeka vimaan sewama chadhna sahaj hunchha jasto lagna sakne bhae..."" which translates to ""If you fly a lot, it might feel easy to get on a plane with a frequent flyer service..."".  Therefore, the primary consideration is choosing a program that aligns with your travel frequency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sabai bhanda dherai anka dine wayusewa (The program that gives the most points):** While points are important, the text focuses on the *benefit* of a frequent flyer program, which is more relevant for frequent flyers.
* **B: Sabai bhanda thulo gathbandhan maa raheko wayusewa (The program with the largest alliance):** Alliance size isn't the core issue; it's the frequency of your travel.
* **D: Aru suvidha thapna sakne wayusewa (The program that offers other benefits):** Other benefits are secondary to the core value proposition for someone who flies often.



"
Annuchhed anusar kasle dherai flyer point dina sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Eutai gathabandhan ko tapai le sabai bhanda dherai yatra garne wayusewa**

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Tapainlai tapainle dherai udan garnubhaeka vimaan sewama chadhna sahaj hunchha jasto lagna sakne bhae tapani..."" which translates to ""Even if it feels easy to board in an airline you fly frequently...""  This implies that someone who flies frequently with a specific airline will accumulate many frequent flyer points.

Option B, ""Eutai gathabandhan ko tapai le sabai bhanda dherai yatra garne wayusewa"" (An airline where you travel the most) directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Arko gathabandhan ko bhinna vayusewa** (Another airline's different frequent flyer program): The paragraph is specifically talking about a single airline.
*   **C: Arko gathabandhan ko tapai le sabai bhanda dherai yatra garne wayusewa** (Another airline's different frequent flyer program): Same as A, focuses on a different airline.
*   **D: Eutai gathabandhan ko bhinna vayusewa** (An airline's different frequent flyer program): It's about a single airline's program, not a different one.



"
Anuchhed anusar madira badhi sewan garna le kun indriya lai hani garchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Herai (Blindness)**.

The passage states: ""Atyadhik madira seven hoon sakne sambhawit dirghakalin swasthya ghatanaharuma kalejoko kshati ra andhopana ra mrityusmet hoon sakha."" This translates to: ""Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to long-term health problems such as liver damage, blindness, and death.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions that excessive alcohol consumption can cause blindness (and also death).
"
Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaye anusar madirako kaharab asar lai ke le kam garna sakne sambhavana cha?,"The correct answer is **C: Thorai thorai garera madira sewan garda** (Drinking alcohol in moderation).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Atyadhik madira seven hoon sakne sambhawit dirghakalin swasthya ghatanaharuma kalejoko kshati ra andhopana ra mrityusmet hoon sakha."" (Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to long-term health problems such as liver damage, blindness, and death.)
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Awaidh rupma utpadan garieko madira seven garda sambhawit khatra badheko cha. Awaidh spiritharule vibhinna khatarnak ashuddhiharu samawesh garna sakdachhan, methanol lagayat, jasle sano khurakma pani andhopan wa mrityu garauna sakdachhan."" (Consuming illegal alcohol increases the risk. Illegal spirits may contain various dangerous impurities, including methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small amounts.)

While the passage highlights the dangers of excessive and illegal alcohol consumption, it *doesn't* explicitly state a way to *reduce* the negative effects. However, the general understanding of health and alcohol consumption is that **drinking in moderation** is a way to potentially lessen the risks associated with alcohol. Options A and B actually *increase* the risk. Option D is irrelevant.

Therefore, option C is the most logical inference based on the context, even though it's not directly stated as a solution.  It's the *opposite* of the problems described in the passage.
"
Amsterdam maa sabai bhanda badhi ghar-jagga ko mulya kaha chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal jilla**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Canal district (douch: gractangordel) 17aun shatabdiko prasidha zilla ho jasle amsterdamko binnenstad ghereko thiyo.""  This translates to ""The Canal district (douch: gractangordel) is a renowned district of the 17th century that surrounded the inner city of Amsterdam.""
* **The text further emphasizes:** ""yasaka sampattiko mulya deshma sabaibhanda uccha cha."" which means ""the value of this property is higher than in any other country.""  This directly points to the Canal District.
* While the Canal District *is* a UNESCO World Heritage site, the question asks *where* the property value is highest. The text connects the high value specifically to the Canal District.
* Options B, C, and D are either too general or not directly supported by the text.

Therefore, **Canal jilla** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text.
"
Canal jilla lai kina UNESCO ko vishwa sampada suchi maa raakhieko chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yasko aitihaasik ra sanskritik mahatwa ko karanle** (Because of its historical and cultural importance).

The passage explicitly states: ""Pura jillalai yasako adwitiya sanskritik ra aitihasik mahatwa ca lagi UNESCO vishwa sampadaka rupma tokieko cha..."" which translates to ""The district has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its unique historical and cultural importance...""

While the other options might be *partially* true, they aren't the primary reason mentioned in the passage. The core reason is the historical and cultural significance.
"
Anuchhed anusar ke karan le phnom krom ko bhraman sarthak hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonle Sap bata dekhine drishya (The views from Lake Tonle Sap)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mandirko udas watawaran ra tonal sap talko drishyale pahadma chadhnu sarthak banaunchhan"" which translates to ""The peaceful atmosphere and the scenic views of Lake Tonle Sap make it worthwhile to climb the mountain.""

While options B, C, and D mention activities available in the area, the passage highlights the **views from Lake Tonle Sap** as the primary reason for a worthwhile visit.
"
Anuchhed anusar phnom krom chirda aagantuk lai ke awashyak parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Angkor pass paunu (Get an Angkor Pass)**.

The text states: ""Tonele Sap ma jaanda Angkor Pass mandir praesh gurney hunale passport lyauna nabirsanu hola."" This translates to: ""When going to Tonle Sap, since the Angkor Pass area is nearby, it is better to get a passport."" Although it mentions a passport, the core requirement highlighted in the context of visiting the Angkor Pass area is having the Angkor Pass itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yasowarman mandir bata mathi chadnu (Climb up from the Yasowarman temple):** This is a description of the temple's location and doesn't represent a necessary requirement for visitors.
*   **B: Siem Reap waripari ghumni (Tour around Siem Reap):** While touring Siem Reap might be part of a trip, the text specifically mentions Angkor Pass for the Tonle Sap area.
*   **D: Tonele sap waripari dunga chadnu (Take a boat trip around Tonle Sap):** Taking a boat trip is mentioned as an option, but not a requirement. The Angkor Pass is directly linked to visiting the Angkor Pass area near Tonle Sap.



"
Anucched anusar tala die madhye ke le paryatak lai antarctica ko bhraman garna bata rokchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Thulo bhraman budget (Large travel budget)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Paryatak bhraman mahango raheko cha"" which translates to ""Tourist travel is expensive"". This directly addresses the financial barrier to visiting Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ross samundra ghumne ekal ichha (Desire to travel around Ross Sea alone):** The passage doesn't mention anything about traveling around the Ross Sea specifically, or any preference for solo travel.
* **C: Karya talika jasle december ra january ma ghumna dinchha (Work schedule that allows travel in December and January):** The passage mentions the limited warm season (November-February), but doesn't link it to work schedules.
* **D: Simit sharirik tandurusti (Limited physical fitness):** While the passage mentions ""sharirik tandurusti chahinchha"" (physical fitness is required), it doesn't say it *prevents* tourists from going. It implies a requirement for participation.



"
Parvatarohan maa ruchi rakhne paryatak le antartica ko kun bhag ma bhraman garla?,"The correct answer is **B: Bhitri bhag (Inner part)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Antarik antarctica ek ujad pathar ho june 2-3 kilometer barafle dhakieko cha."" This translates to ""Inner Antarctica is a barren rock, covered with 2-3 kilometers of ice.""
* It further mentions that ""kahilekaahin visheshagya hawai turharu parwatarohanka lagi wa polma pugnaka lagibhitra janchhan, jasko thulo adhaar huncha."" This translates to ""Sometimes special climbers go inside for mountaineering or to reach the pole, which has a large base.""

Therefore, mountaineering and reaching the South Pole (which requires going to the inner part of Antarctica) are activities mentioned in connection with the inner part of Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ross samundra (Ross Sea):** The passage doesn't mention the Ross Sea in relation to mountaineering.
* **C: Prayadip (Antipodes):** The passage only mentions Prayaah (likely referring to the Indian Ocean) as being limited to islands and some areas.
* **D: Tapu haru (Islands):** The passage states that island tourism is limited.

"
Aadhunik samay agadi ko prayogshala kun sthan ma hune sambhavana chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sahar ko kendramaa (In the city center)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adhunik samayama banekobhanda pugna sajila tiniharu **pry: sheher wa campusharuma awasthit thee**."" This translates to ""In modern times, they are easily found **in cities and campuses**.""  Therefore, the most likely place for modern laboratories is in city centers.

While the passage also mentions remote, favorable locations for telescopes, it's referring to *modern research telescopes*, not general laboratories.  The main point is that modern labs are now common in urban areas.
"
Euta aadhunik anusandhan telescope kaha rakhine sambhavana hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Vishwavhidyalaya campus maa** (On university campus).

Here's why:

The passage states that modern research telescopes are often located on university campuses or in remote, favorable environments.  University campuses are prime locations for research facilities like telescopes.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Sangralaya maa (In a museum):** While telescopes *might* be *displayed* in a museum, they are not typically used for active research *within* a museum.
* **C: Saichhik sthal maa (In a remote location):** While telescopes *can* be in remote locations, the passage emphasizes they are often found *on* university campuses, which can be in remote locations but aren't *always* remote.
* **D: Euta thulo sthaan maa (In a large place):**  This is too general.  A university campus is a large place, but it's a more specific and likely location than just ""a large place.""



"
Anuchhed anusar samudri kinar maa shanta sanga din bitauna kun kshetra sabai bhanda ramro chha?,"The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wetmata harborma tamaki drivema samudri bichharu chan, **mission bay madhya bajarma ra St Heliers central aklandko bajarma chha**.""  This indicates that St Heliers is located in the central Auckland area and is mentioned alongside Mission Bay as a desirable coastal location.

The passage also highlights that St Heliers has:

*   ""Ramra shringkhalabadha pasalharuko sathama kahilekaahin bhidbhad hune pariwarik samudri tata hun."" - Family-friendly coastal areas with good infrastructure.
*   ""Paudi surakshit cha."" - Safe beaches.

Therefore, St Heliers is presented as a particularly good place to spend time by the sea.
"
Anuchhed anusar paudi khelna sabai bhanda surakshit kshetra kun hun?,"The correct answer is **B: Utter Harbor jilla**.

The passage states: ""Uttari bank tataharu (utter harbor jillama) prashanta mahasagarma chan ra uttarma long khadidekhi dakshinma davenportsamma failieka chan. Tiniharu prayaha sabai baluwa yukta samudri bankharu hun jasma paudi khelnu surakshit cha ra pry pohutukawa rukhharudwara chhayan pradan garieko cha."" 

This translates to: ""The northern banks (in Utter Harbor district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay to Devonport. They are mostly sandy coastal areas where it is safe to play in the surf and are provided with shade by many tall trees.""

Therefore, Utter Harbor district is described as having safe beaches for swimming.
"
Anuchhed maa varnan garieko sthan bhraman garda kun kura lai anuchit maninchha?,"Correct Answer: **C: Thatta garnu**

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Holocast wa najiharuko barema thatta nagarnuhos."" This translates to ""Do not discuss the Holocaust or Nazi.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gambhir hune abhinay garnu (Act solemnly):** The paragraph emphasizes respect and seriousness, so acting solemnly would be appropriate, not inappropriate.
*   **B: Site waripari kehi chinha raakhnu (Leave some signs in the site):** The paragraph says not to damage the site (""Sanrachanaharuma bhitte chitra lagaera wa scratch garera sitelai kharab nagarnuhos""), which implies not leaving signs.
*   **D: Samrachana maa kornu (Damage the structure):** The paragraph directly forbids damaging the structure.

Therefore, discussing the Holocaust or Nazi is the specifically forbidden action."
Yea madhye kunle boli chaalikaa bhasha janauchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Kutrim (Artificial)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""Sahayak bhashaharu"" (auxiliary languages) as languages *created* for the purpose of facilitating communication between people who may have difficulty communicating in natural languages.  The passage explicitly states they are ""kritrim wa sirjana garieka"" (artificial and created).

* **Kutrim** means artificial.
* **Aprakritik** means unnatural.
* **Nirmit** means created.
* **Prakritik** means natural.

Since the languages are designed and not naturally evolved, ""Kutrim"" (artificial) is the most accurate description.
"
Yea madhye kun wakyale sahayak bhashalai sahi rupma janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Yea bhasha prakritik ra nirmit dubai hun (Yes, language is both natural and artificial)**.

Here's why:

* **The original text clearly states that auxiliary languages are *artificial* languages created to facilitate communication between people who don't share a common natural language.**  It emphasizes they are *different* from natural languages.
* Option B incorrectly identifies auxiliary languages as both natural and artificial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeaniharu prakritik bhasha hun jasko prayog ek arka lai nabujhne manis biich ko sanchar laai sahayog garna hunchha (Yes, these are natural languages used to help communication between people who don't understand each other)** - This is wrong because auxiliary languages are *artificial*, not natural.
* **C: Yea bhasha lai sanchar ko kathin awastha lai sudhar garna nirman garieko hunchha (Yes, the language is constructed to improve the difficult situation of communication)** -  This is a correct summary of the purpose of auxiliary languages.
* **D: Yea bhasha ko sirjana farak bhasha bolne waktii haru ko lagi garieko ho (Yes, the creation of the language is done for speakers of different languages)** - This is also a correct summary of the purpose.



Therefore, only option B misrepresents the nature of auxiliary languages as being both natural and artificial.
"
Anucched anusar jaado maa samundri yaatra garda yatru le ke janch garnu parcha?,"The correct answer is **A: Cabin ko sthan (Cabin's location)**.

The passage states: ""Yadi jadoma uttari baltic paar gurney ho bhane, cabinko sthan jaanch garnuhos..."" which translates to ""If you are going across the North Baltic Sea, check the location of the cabin...""

The passage also mentions that passengers are exempt from certain requirements, which is related to ""Bhisa ko avashyakta"" (visa requirements) and ""Shart haru"" (conditions).  However, the *primary* action the passage instructs passengers to take if travelling across the North Baltic Sea is to check the cabin location.
"
Anuchhed anusar samudri yatra garmi maa bhae yatru le ke bata joginu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhisa ko awashyakta (Medical needs)**.

The passage states: ""kruj yatriharulai bhisa awashyakataharubata chhuta diieko cha"" which translates to ""Cruise passengers are exempt from medical needs."" This implies that passengers are concerned about medical needs during the cruise.

While the other options are mentioned, they aren't the primary concern highlighted in the context of the passage.

Barcelona maa sanket ra ghosana ko lagi kina praya catalan ko prayog garinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Yo sahar ko pahilo adhikarik bhasa thiyo (It was the first official language of the city)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Jahansamma, dherai sanket haru kewal catalanma matra sanket garinchha kinky yo kanundwara pahilo adhikarik bhashaka rupma sthapit cha."" (Until now, many signs are only indicated in Catalan because it has been established as the first official language by law.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Yaslai spanish bhanda dheraile bhujhchhan (It is understood by many more than Spanish):** The text says the *opposite* - that Spanish is widely used.
* **C: Yo barcelona maa ruchaine bhasa ho (It is the language liked in Barcelona):** While many people likely like Catalan, the text emphasizes its official status.
* **D: Metro ra aru sarvajanik sthan ghumna aaune nagarik le praaya catalan bolchhan (Citizens visiting the metro and other public places mostly speak Catalan):** The text doesn't say that citizens *mostly* speak Catalan; it only mentions that signs are in Catalan.



"
Yea madhye barcelona ko metro pranali le niyamit ghosana ko laagi kun bhasa ko prayog garchhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Spanish**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metroma niyamit ghoshana **catalanma matra garinchha tar yojanabadha awarodh swachalit pranalile spanish, angrezi, francelli, arbi ra japanijsahit vibhinna bhashaharuma ghoshana garchha**.""

This translates to: ""Metro makes regular announcements **only in Catalan, but through the planned obstacle-free automated system, announcements are made in Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese**.""

Therefore, Spanish is one of the languages used in the metro announcements, specifically through the automated system. While Catalan is the primary language for announcements, Spanish is also used.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun suvidhaa laai uccha mulya ko ochhyan ra breakfast le prathamikta maa rakhdaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Tej gatiko wifi (Fast wifi)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph emphasizes luxury and historical significance. It mentions:

*   **Luxurious beds:** ""shabaibhanda vilasi palanga pauna upayukta cha"" (luxurious beds are readily available)
*   **Historical building and setting:** ""prachin shaman, herwichar garieko maidan ra euta paudi pokhariko sath aitihasik purano bhawan hoon sakcha"" (ancient shaman, a contemplative field, and a historical old building with a spring lake)
*   **Focus on food quality:** ""mausamanusarko swadishta khanekura wa hostle tayar parney vishesh khana samawesh hoon sakha"" (seasonal, delicious cuisine or special meals prepared for the hostel)
*   **Competition between food choices:** ""ochhyan ra bihanko khaja"" (choice between vegetarian and non-vegetarian food).

None of these directly relate to fast wifi. While wifi *could* be considered a modern amenity, the paragraph's focus is on historical charm, luxury bedding, and food quality - aspects that don't inherently prioritize fast wifi. Therefore, fast wifi is the least emphasized amenity.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun luxury B&Bs ko lagi pratispardha ko vishay hoinan?,"The answer is **A: Aadhunik sajawat (Modern decoration)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that the B&Bs compete primarily on two main things: ""ochhyan ra bihanko khaja"" (the view and the breakfast).
* The paragraph mentions ""hatle banaeko dasana wa purano khatma, sabaibhanda vilasi palanga pauna upayukta cha"" (a beautiful view or an old and charming setting, with the most luxurious beds being useful). This directly relates to the *ochhyan* (view).
* It also mentions ""mausamanusarko swadishta khanekura wa hostle tayar parney vishesh khana samawesh hoon sakha"" (delicious, seasonal food or special meals prepared by the hostel). This directly relates to *bihanko khaja* (breakfast).
* Options C and D, ""Uccha mulya ko ochhyan"" (High-priced views) and ""Sthaniya khana ra peya padartha"" (Local food and drinks), are both aspects that contribute to competition, related to view and breakfast respectively.
* **Aadhunik sajawat (Modern decoration)** is not mentioned as a key point of competition in the paragraph. While it might be *present* in some B&Bs, it isn't highlighted as a primary differentiator against other B&Bs.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun 2022 maa beijing maa hune chhaina?","Correct Answer: B: Taizicheng ski kshetra karyakram

Explanation:

The passage states that skiing competitions will be held 220 kilometers from Beijing in the Taiji Cheng Sky Field in Zhangjiakou.  Therefore, the Taiji Cheng ski field itself is *where* the competitions will be held, not a competition *program*.

The passage explicitly mentions that the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and indoor ice programs will all be held in Beijing.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun 2022 maa beijing le aayojana garnechha?,"The correct answer is **C: Shitakaalin olympics**.

The passage states: ""yasasangai beijing grishmakalin ra shitkalin duwai olympic khel ayojana gurney pahilo sahar banne cha."" which translates to ""Beijing is the first city to host both Summer and Winter Olympics."" The passage also mentions the Winter Olympics events in Beijing.
"
Avian influenza ko sankraman hune sambavana sabai bhanda badhi kaslai hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kukhura paalan maa kaam garne vyaktiharu (People working in chicken farming)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Manawama hazarbhanda come ghatanaharu report garieka chan ra timadhye kehi ghatak chan. Jyan gumaune mancheharumadhye dheraijaso kukhura palanma cam gurney wyaktiharu raheka chan tar charaharu awalokan garna chahane wyaktima pani yasabata kehi jokhim raheko cha.""  This translates to: ""There have been thousands of cases in humans and some are critical. Among the deceased, a large number were people involved in chicken farming.  While there is also some risk to those who wish to observe birds.""

This clearly indicates that people working directly with chickens have a higher risk of infection. While the risk exists for bird watchers and those working with other animals, the passage highlights chicken farmers as being particularly vulnerable.



"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye kun wakya le bird flue lai sahi rupmaa janauchha?,"Correct Answer: **C: Chara ko awalokan garne haru maa sankraman ko jokhim hunchha**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""tar charaharu awalokan garna chahane wyaktima pani yasabata kehi jokhim raheko cha."" (but even those who want to observe birds have some risk from this.) This directly translates to ""even those who want to observe birds have some risk of infection.""
*   Option A is incorrect because the passage mentions people working with chickens but doesn't say they were the first to contract the flu.
*   Option B is incorrect because the passage indicates infections have been reported in humans, not that birds have more infections.
*   Option D is incorrect because the passage doesn't say all infections in humans are serious.



"
White Sea-Baltic canal le ke jodchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic mahasagar ra baltic samudra**.

The text states: ""White C-Baltic Canelle dheraijaso nadi ra talharudwara onega tall, ladoga tall ra cent pietersbergmarfat arctic mahasagarlai baltic sisanga jodchha."" which translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea via the Onega lake, Ladoga lake, and Peetersberg.""
"
Anuchhed anusar kasto kisim ko gadi maa rahadaani sankalan garnu parchaa taki yatru lai avarodh nahos?,"The correct answer is **B: Raatri sleeper rail**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Rati sutne railharuma, conductorle rahadaniharu sankalan garna sakdachhan taaki tapainlai nindrama badha napugos."" This translates to ""In overnight trains, the conductor can collect passengers so as not to disturb their sleep."" Therefore, the gathering of passengers happens in overnight sleeper trains.
"
Anuchhed anusar kunai sima pariko rail maa tapai ko id kun bela janch garine chha?,"The correct answer is **D: Kudiraheko rail maa (In the moving train)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Kehi sima pariko railharuma nirikshan chaliraheko trainma garinchha ra tapainsanga tee trainharumadhye kunai ekma chadhda many id hunu parchha."" (Some checkpoints are being conducted in the trains running at certain stations, and you have to get off and show your ID in one of those trains.)

This implies the ID check happens while the train is *moving*. It's not after you get off (A), or while you're sleeping (B), or that it doesn't happen at all (C).
"
Yea madhye singapore ko uccha ushna pradeshiya kshetra maa rahada kun vishay uthne sambhavana huncha?,"Correct answer is **C: Dherai garmi le thakne (Getting tired from the extreme heat)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states that Singapore is located in a ""high tropical zone.""  This means it experiences high temperatures and humidity. The text also mentions the need to prepare for heat and humidity.  Option C directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lootpaat garne (Robbery):**  The text doesn't mention any security issues or potential for robbery.
*   **B: Dokan maa pahunch nahune (Difficulty reaching shops):** The text says it's easy to navigate and buy things after arriving.
*   **D: Bato biraune (Getting lost on the road):** The text says it's easy to navigate.



"
Kasla german pastries nakhanu thik hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaslai badam ko gambhir allergy chha (Those with a severe almond allergy)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Therefore, someone with a severe almond allergy should avoid them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jaslai ali bahdi desert man parchha (Those who prefer a slightly dry dessert):** The text doesn't mention the dryness of the pastries as a reason to avoid them.
* **C: Jaslai chocolate man pardaina (Those who don't like chocolate):** While some pastries might contain chocolate, the text doesn't state that chocolate is a primary ingredient in most.
* **D: Jaslai masaledar bhanda mitho swad man parchha (Those who prefer sweet taste over spicy):** German pastries are described as sweet, so this wouldn't be a reason to avoid them.



"
yea madhye kun german pastries ko lagi seasonal tatwa maninchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aalubakhada (Potatoes)**.

The text explicitly states: ""garmiyamma cherry ra alubkhada pani prayog garinchha"" which translates to ""In summer, potatoes are also used."" This indicates that potatoes are a seasonal ingredient used in some German pastries.
"
Anuchhed anusar budget maa bhraman garda kun kura ko sifaris garidaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Manisharu sanga paisa magnu (Asking money from people)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""...yatriharu chorne, beijjat gurney, awaidh bajarma bhag line, magne wa anyatha tiniharuko afnai faidaka lagi any manisharulai shoshan gardainan bhane anuman gardacha."" This translates to ""...travelers should not steal, engage in dishonorable practices, participate in illegal gambling, or ask for money or exploit other people for their own benefit.""

Asking money from people falls directly under the category of exploitation and is therefore discouraged. The other options (traveling in a small group, being comfortable with your own abilities, and cutting expenses on food and accommodation) are presented as ways to manage a budget trip.
"
Anuchhed anusar sano budget maa bhraman garda kaslai garo parna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Jasle bhraman ko belaa tadha bata kam garne yojana banaeko chha (Who makes a plan to save money while traveling).**

Here's why:

The passage states that traveling on a small budget requires planning and prioritizing. It mentions sacrificing comfort, time, and pre-booking to reduce expenses.  Option C directly reflects this need for planning to minimize costs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Jasle chunauti ko swagat garchha (Who welcomes challenges):** While a budget trip is a challenge, the passage doesn't primarily focus on a general attitude towards challenges, but rather on *how* to manage expenses.
* **B: Jaslai samayko pabandi chhaina (Who doesn't have a time constraint):**  The passage implies that budget travel *may* involve sacrificing time, not necessarily having unlimited time.
* **D: Jasle talika anusar kam garna ramailo manchha (Who enjoys working according to a list):**  While a list *could* be part of a budget plan, the passage isn't about enjoying lists, but about making practical financial decisions.



"
Tala madhye kun vakya le point marion ra fairmont bich ko drive lai sahi ruple janaudaina?,"Correct Answer: **D: Mobile sewa maa kunai samasya aaudaina**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadyapi, yo margama raheka pensylvania wilds jasta any sthanko tulanama yahan mobile phone sewa nikai ramro cha."" This translates to ""However, compared to mobile phone service in other locations like Pennsylvania wilds, the mobile phone service here is quite good."" 

Therefore, option D, ""Mobile sewa maa kunai samasya aaudaina"" (There are no problems with mobile service), is **incorrect** because the passage indicates the opposite - the mobile service is *relatively* good, implying there *could* be problems elsewhere.

The other options are all mentioned in the passage as characteristics of the drive:

* **A: Tyaha dherai lama durgam bata haru chhan** (There are many long difficult bends) - This aligns with the description of ""thado shreni, sanghuro marg ra dharilo bakra pramukh hunchhan"" (steep grades, narrow roads, and sharp bends).
* **B: Lane haru sanghuro chhan** (The lanes are narrow) -  Directly mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Gati ko simako palana garidaina** (Speed limits are not obeyed) - The passage explicitly states ""uniharuka lagi kada agyapalan anyathabhanda ajha mahatwapurna huncha"" (Obeying speed limits is even more important for them).



"
Anuchhed anusar buffalo-Pittsburg rajmarga maa chalak haru laa yea madhye kun kuramaa dhyan dinu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Tibra mod maa chado sawari chalaunu (Driving cautiously through sharp turns)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""thado shreni, sanghuro marg ra dharilo bakra pramukh hunchhan"" which translates to ""steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp turns are prominent.""  It also emphasizes the importance of adhering to speed limits in the hilly and rugged sections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhari sawari chap maa fasne (Getting stuck in heavy traffic):** The passage doesn't mention traffic congestion.
*   **B: Mobile ko sewa ko kami (Lack of mobile phone service):** The passage states the opposite - mobile phone service is relatively good compared to other areas.
*   **D: Bato maa hune sadak nriman karyaharuh ko samana dherai garnu (Lots of road construction work on the road):** The passage doesn't mention road construction.



"
Canyoneering suru garda yea madhye kunko aawashyakta pardaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Thorai matramaa prashikshan (Only basic training)**.

Here's why:

The text states that canyoning requires ""tulanatmak rupma sano prashikshan wa sharirik akarko awashyak pardachha"" (relatively little training and physical fitness compared to rock climbing, scuba diving, or alpine skiing).  Therefore, it doesn't require *only* basic training.  It needs more than that.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible but not the best fit:

*   **A: Paudine kshamata (Ability to jump):**  While jumping is involved, it's not the only requirement.
*   **B: Charam shaaririk awashtha (Excellent physical condition):** The text mentions physical fitness is needed, but not to the same extent as extreme sports.
*   **C: Ufrane kshamata (Swimming ability):** Canyoning involves water, so swimming is important, although not the *only* requirement.

Since the text emphasizes *less* training than other activities, the option stating only basic training is incorrect. The best fit, implying that other skills/fitness are needed, is that it doesn't only require basic training.
"
Ek safal canyoning bhraman kaa lagi tala madhye ke aawashyak parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Canyoneering sambandhi pramanpatra (Canyoneering certification)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for requirements for a *successful* canyoning trip.** While options A, B, and D might be helpful skills, they aren't strictly *necessary* for safety and success.
* **Canyoneering is inherently dangerous.**  The text explicitly states it involves jumping, climbing, and rappelling.  A certification demonstrates that someone has received proper training in safe canyoning techniques, risk assessment, and rescue procedures. This is the most crucial requirement for a successful and safe trip.
* **Why other options are less accurate:**
    * **A: Unnat star ko athletic kshamata (Advanced athletic ability):**  While athleticism is helpful, it's not a substitute for proper training.  You can be athletic but still make mistakes without certification.
    * **B: Scuba diving ko anubhav (Scuba diving experience):**  Scuba diving isn't directly relevant to canyoning.
    * **D: Paudane kshamata (Jumping ability):**  Jumping is part of canyoning, but knowing *how* to jump safely and execute rappels (descending using ropes) is crucial and comes from training, not just jumping ability.

Therefore, a canyoning certification provides the necessary foundation of knowledge and skills to ensure safety and success in this activity.



"
Anuchhed anusar aafnai car maa sutne yojana banauda kun kura aawashyak parcha?,"The correct answer is **A: Aafno gaadi ko sima bare darho bujhaai (Know the limits of your car)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Thulla sawariharuko viparit, tapain shayed phile nai afno car chalauna parichit hunuhunchha ra yasako simitta tapainlai thaha cha."" This translates to ""Unlike large vehicles, you probably are familiar with driving your own car and you know its limits.""  The passage emphasizes understanding the car's size and limitations as a prerequisite for car camping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Seat muni sarna milne gadi (A car that can be slept under the seat):** The passage doesn't mention anything about sleeping under the seat.
* **C: Tent:** The passage explicitly states that this isn't ""camping"" and not a comfortable way to sleep.
* **D: Camp banauna niji jaga (A private place to set up camp):** While a private place is desirable, the passage focuses on the car itself and its limitations.

Therefore, understanding your car's size and capabilities is the most important factor mentioned in the passage."
"Anuchhed anusar, yadi radar maa rahane ho bhane car maa camper haru le kun kura bata joginu parchha?","The correct answer is **A: Thulo gadi chalaunu, jastai suv athawa minivan**.

The paragraph states: ""Yadi tapainsanga thulo minibhyan, SUV, sedan wa station wagon cha jasko sitharu dhalkinchan bhane car camping sambhawa huncha."" This translates to: ""If you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon whose seats fold down, then car camping is possible."" 

Therefore, car campers need to have larger vehicles like SUVs or minivans.
"
Anuchhed anusar dosro patak casablanca kasle punanirman gare?,"The correct answer is **D: Morakko kaa sultan**.

The text states: ""Morakkoko sultanle shaharlai daarah ell badayako rupma punarnirman gare ra yasalai tyahan wyaparik adharharu banaune spenka wyapariharule casablancako name die."" This translates to ""The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city in a grand manner and named it Casablanca, where merchants who established commercial bases there began to do business.""
"
Prakritik prakop pachhi kasle casablanca ko aadhunik sahar lai chhode?,"The correct answer is **B: Portuguese**.

The passage states: ""...Portugaliharule yasalai nashta gare..."" which translates to ""...the Portuguese destroyed it...""  Later, it mentions the Portuguese rebuilt Casablanca after the 1755 earthquake.
"
Anuchhed anusar sintra le videshiharu sanga kasari pahichan banae?,"The correct answer is **C: Lord byron kaa sakaratmak samiksha haru**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...jaslai lord bairandwara record garieko ra yasaka shanko chamakdar ghatanapachi videshiharuka lagi prasidha banaieko thiyo.""  This translates to ""...which Lord Byron recorded and made famous for foreigners because of its sparkling incidents.""  Therefore, it was Lord Byron's positive reviews that made Sintra famous among foreigners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:** Cabo da Roca is mentioned as a location where the bus stops, but not as how Sintra became famous.
* **B: Marian kaa pisach haru (Marian's demons):** While the passage mentions Lady of Fatima, it doesn't connect the Marian demons to Sintra's fame among foreigners.
* **D: Yo romantic itihas ho (This is a romantic history):**  While Sintra *is* romantic, the passage specifically points to Lord Byron's record and subsequent fame as the reason for its popularity with foreigners.



"
Armenia le kaslai manyata didaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Nagorno-Karabakh kshetra**.

The text states: ""Armaniako samarthanle euta naya ganatantra nirman gariyo. **yadyapi, armanialgayatka kunai pani sthapit rashtrale yasalai adhikarik manyata dieko chhaina.**""  This translates to: ""With Armenian support a new republic was built. **However, Armenia has not officially recognized this established state.**""

Therefore, Armenia has not recognized the Nagorno-Karabakh region as an independent state.
"
Azerbaijan ra armenia bich ko sambandha lai kasle asar gariraheko chha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kutnitik tarka haru (Diplomatic disputes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yass kshetraka bare kutnitik bahasle armenia ra azerbaijan bichko sambandhalai nirantar rupma kshati pu cha."" This translates to ""Diplomatic debates about this region continuously damage the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Azerbaijan maa baseka armenian haru (Armenian minorities based in Azerbaijan):** While the presence of Armenian minorities is a factor in the tensions, the passage highlights the *diplomatic debates* as the ongoing damage to the relationship.
* **B: 1994 ko yuddha (The 1994 war):** The war *caused* the diplomatic disputes, but the passage emphasizes that the *ongoing debates* are the current source of damage.
* **D: Nagorno-Karabakh kshetra (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** The Nagorno-Karabakh region is *the subject* of the diplomatic disputes, but the passage focuses on the *debates themselves* and their impact.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**.
"
Charlotte maa taxi lida kun karan le thap shulka parna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Tin yatru hudaa** (There are three passengers).

Here's why:

The text states: ""2bhanda badhi yatru hunale adhibhar lagnale yo vikalpa awashyakbhanda badhi mahango hoon sakha."" This translates to: ""If there are more than 2 passengers, the fare can be more expensive than necessary.""  This implies that a fare surcharge applies when there are three or more passengers.
"
Anuchhed anusaar charlotte maa balbalika sanga basda huna sakne befaida ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Taxi ko yatra (Taxi rides)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kehi paristhitiharuma prayog garna taxiharu samanyataya charlotma pariwarharule prayog gardainan. 2bhanda badhi yatru hunale adhibhar lagnale yo vikalpa awashyakbhanda badhi mahango hoon sakha.""  This translates to: ""In some situations, taxis are usually not used by Charlotte families. If there are more than 2 passengers, the option can be more expensive than necessary due to the extra cost.""

The passage is discussing why taxis are *not* a good option for families in Charlotte, specifically relating to cost.  Therefore, the answer refers to taxi rides. The other options are not mentioned or addressed in the passage.
"
Spanish ko aagaman chile ko uttari bhag maa kasko niyantran thiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Araucanians**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: 16th century, in the northern part of Chile, the indigenous Araucanians (Mapuche) who were under the rule of the Inca rulers lived in central and southern Chile."" 

Therefore, the Araucanians were in control of the northern part of Chile during that time. The Mapuche are a subgroup of the Araucanians.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun ghatana 1810 maa ghateko hoina?,"Correct answer is **B: Chile le spanish mathi vijay prapta garyo**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that although Chile declared independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars when the Spanish central government was weakened), the decisive victory for Spain didn't happen until 1818.
*   Option B states that Chile achieved a victory over Spain in 1810, which contradicts the information in the passage.
*   Option A is true, as the passage mentions the Spanish central government being weak due to the Napoleonic Wars.
*   Option C is true, as the passage states the declaration of independence happened during the Napoleonic Wars.
*   Option D is true, as the passage explicitly says Chile declared independence in 1810.



"
Ligugria kshetra maa manis durgam kshetra maa kasari pugna sakchhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Rail wa dunga bata** (By train and boat).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Path, rail ra dungale gaaunharu joddachha..."" which translates to ""Road, rail, and boat connect these villages...""  This indicates that you can reach these villages by a combination of train and boat, or by road and boat. Option C is the only one that includes both rail and boat, accurately reflecting the information provided.
"
Italian abhivyakti ‘cinque terre’ le ke janauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Paanch gaau (Five villages)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Liguriako italy kshetrama awasthit panchwata sano samudri tatawarti gaaunharu rheomaggior, manarola, cornigla, bhernaja ra monterosso samawesh gurney sinke tere, jasko earth paanch jagga ho."" This translates to: ""Located in the Ligurian region of Italy are five small coastal villages including Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso, which are all part of a UNESCO World Heritage site.""

Therefore, ""cinque terre"" means five villages.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, jado maa chiplana bata jogina kasto jutta upayukta hunchha?","The correct answer is **A: Saanghuro taluwa bhaeko jutta (Waterproof sole shoes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kamtima pani tapainlai upayukta taluwa bhaeko jutta chahinchha."" which translates to ""At least you need to have shoes with a suitable sole.""  It further explains that ""garmiyamka juttaharu prayaha baraf ra hiunma dherai chipline hunchhan"" - ""summer shoes often have a lot of slipperiness in snow and ice."" This implies that waterproof soles are necessary for icy conditions.

While stud shoes are mentioned as an *additional* helpful tool for very slippery situations, the passage emphasizes the importance of a suitable *sole* in general.
"
Jado ko bela hiun bhaeko batomaa traction sudhar garna yea madhye kasle sahayog gardaina?,"The correct answer is **D: pani (water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that sand, gravel, and calcium chloride are used to improve traction on roads and pathways when it's icy.  The question asks what *doesn't* help. Water, while it can contribute to slippery conditions (ice), doesn't improve traction in the same way the other options do.  It can make things *worse* by creating a thin layer of ice.

Therefore, water is the option that doesn't aid in improving traction on icy surfaces.
"
Yea madhye hawaii ra cook tapu bich ko sahi samanta ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Dubai le rajya ko manyata paeka chhainan**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that even though Cook Islands are small, they are perceived as having more tourists than Hawaii due to the lack of large hotels and development.
*   The text also mentions that there are no cities in the Cook Islands, but 15 of the islands are formed by mills.
*   The question asks for the correct analogy between Hawaii and Cook Islands. Hawaii is a well-known state with development, while the Cook Islands, despite being tourist destinations, lack large-scale development and cities.
*   Dubai is known for its large hotels, is a major city, and has a strong state identity.

Therefore, the closest analogy is that **Dubai le rajya ko manyata paeka chhainan** (Dubai does not have statehood/identity) because Cook Islands lack the established state identity and extensive development that Hawaii possesses.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dubai maa thula hotel chhan** (Dubai has large hotels) - This is the opposite of the Cook Islands.
*   **C: Dubai ko time zone eutai ho** (Dubai has one time zone) - The text doesn't mention time zones.
*   **D: Dubai maa sahar chhainan** (Dubai does not have cities) - This is incorrect, Dubai is a major city."
Yea madhye kunle cook tapu haruko sahi vardan gardaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Yas tapu muluk ra hawaii ko eutai time zone ho** (This island country and Hawaii have the same time zone).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Hawaiko jastai samay khetra bhae pani yea tapulai kahilekaahin """"hawai tall""""ca rupma liine gareko cha."" (Even though it has the same time zone as Hawaii, it has been referred to as the ""Hawaii of the South Pacific""). This implies they *do not* have the same time zone.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: Yo hawai bhanda sano chha** (It is smaller than Hawaii): The text says, ""Sano bhae tapani, yasale sabai thulla paryatak hotel ra any vikas bina rajyako sangya paunubhanda phile hawaika kehi budha agantukharuko samjhana garauncha."" (Even though it is small, without all the big tourist hotels and other development, it gives the impression of a somewhat deserted Hawaii.)
* **B: Yo tapuharuko samuha ho** (It is an archipelago): The text says, ""Yea tapulai kahilekaahin """"hawai tall""""ca rupma liine gareko cha."" (It has been referred to as the ""Hawaii of the South Pacific."")  An archipelago *is* a group of islands.
* **C: Yaska pramukh sahar rarotonga ra aitutki hun** (Its main cities are Rarotonga and Aitutaki): The text says, ""Cook tapuharuma kunai pani sahar chhaina tar yo 15vata farak tapuharu miller baneko cha. timadhye mukhya saharharu bhaneka rarotonga ra aitutki hun."" (There are no cities in the Cook Islands, but this group of 15 islands is called the Miller Islands. Among them, Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the main cities.)



"
Yea madhye kun ranger station le dui prakar ko awas ko vikalpa dinchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states: ""Sirena ekmatra ranger station ho jasle chhatraas basobas ra camping bahek ramro bhojan pradan gardacha."" This translates to ""Sirena is the only ranger station that provides good food in addition to dormitories and camping.""  This means Sirena offers both accommodation (dormitories) and camping options.

The other options only mention camping as a service.
"
Anuchhed anusar yadi credit ko satta nagad chahida kaha park ko anumati reserve garna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

The text states: ""Puerto jimnejko ranger stationbatai park anumatiharu surakshit garna sakinchha tar tiniharule credit card swikar gardaina.""  This translates to ""Park permits can be secured at the Puerto Jiménez ranger station, but they do not accept credit cards.""
"
Anuchhed anusar thado bhubhag maa kun prakar ko skiing garinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Backcountry skiing**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states: ""pachhiltira thado kshetrama ra dherai kada sky ra butharu awashyak hunchha."" (In the last and most remote areas, skis and snowshoes are necessary.) This directly refers to backcountry skiing, which involves traveling in remote, ungroomed areas.
* While sky touring and sky hiking are mentioned as types of backpacking, the emphasis on remote areas and the need for skis and snowshoes points specifically to backcountry skiing.
* Alpine style and backpacking are broader categories that encompass backcountry skiing, but aren't as specific as backcountry skiing itself.



"
Anuchhed anusar uccha gati maa pugna backcountry skier lai ke le sahayog garna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ramro awastha (Good condition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ramra awasthaharuma tapain hindnubhanda kehi adhik duree paar garna saksham hunuhunechha..."" which translates to ""In good condition, you are capable of covering a greater distance than you would otherwise...""  This directly links good physical condition to being able to achieve higher speeds in backcountry skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kada jutta (Crampons):** Crampons are used for ice climbing, not for general backcountry skiing at high speeds.
* **B: Bhari backpack (Heavy backpack):** The passage mentions that a heavy backpack hinders speed.
* **D: Herchaha garieko bato (Well-groomed path):** The passage explicitly states that backcountry skiing involves traversing ungroomed terrain (""tayar trackharuma cross country skiingko gati prapta garna saknuhunecha""), not well-groomed paths.



"
Puna pravesh garda asahaj mahasush garne yatri lai ke garda kathin hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Naya thau ko sanskriti maa ghulmil huna (To adapt to a new culture)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the difficulty of readjusting to one's own culture after a long time abroad.** It states that while travelers are initially confident about adapting to a new culture, returning home can make it challenging to reintegrate with their original cultural norms.
* **Option A directly reflects this point.** The text highlights the struggle to ""ghulmil garna"" (reintegrate/adapt) to the familiar culture after experiencing a different one.
* **Option B (Dhairyya ra samajhdar banna - To be patient and understanding) is related, but not the core difficulty.**  Patience and understanding *help* with adaptation, but the *difficulty* is the adaptation itself.
* **Option C (Videsh bhraman garna - To travel abroad) is incorrect.** The question is about returning *from* abroad, not the act of traveling.
* **Option D (Ghar ko sanskriti maa puna ghulmil huna - To reintegrate into one's home culture) is partially correct but not as precise as A.** While option D is close, A specifically mentions the process of adapting to a *new* culture *after* returning home, which is the main point of the text.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and directly addresses the difficulty discussed in the provided text.



"
Anuchhed anusar puna pravesh garda mahasus hune asahajta kasto yatri kaa lagi badhi kathin huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Tyasta yatri haru jaslai nikai naramrari sanskritik aaghat anubhav huncha (Those travelers who experience a significant cultural shock)**.

Here's why:

* The passage discusses *sanskritik aghat* (cultural shock) and how it can be amplified when returning home after a long time abroad. 
* The main point is that even if travelers are initially prepared, the experience of returning home can be difficult due to the contrast between the new and old cultures.
* Option A directly addresses this concept of significant cultural shock, which is the core theme of the paragraph.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tyasta yatri jo videsh maa chadai samayojan hunchhan (Those travelers who have settled down in a foreign country):** While this might be true for some, the passage focuses on the challenges of *returning* home, not the initial settling-in process.
* **C: Tyasta yatri jo ajhai honeymoon ko charan maa chhan (Those travelers who are still in the honeymoon phase):** This is irrelevant to the cultural shock experienced upon returning home.
* **D: Tyasta yatri jo sanga dherai dhaireta hudaina (Those travelers who don't get along well with others):**  This relates to interpersonal relationships, not the cultural adjustment described in the passage.



"
Yea madhye musa sanga ke garnu hudaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Uniharu lai tadha bata hernu (Watch them from a distance)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that monkeys are naturally non-aggressive, but will defend themselves if threatened.
* It also warns that approaching them too closely can put you at risk.

Therefore, the best way to interact with monkeys is to observe them from a distance to avoid provoking them and ensuring your safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uniharuko upasthiti lai vewaasta garnu (Manage their presence):** This is too broad. While managing their presence *might* involve distance, it's not the most direct or safest instruction.
* **B: wistarai aghi badhnu (Slowly move forward):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage advises.  Moving closer to a monkey increases the risk of it becoming defensive.
* **C: Uniharu bata hune jokhim lai kam aaknu (Reduce the risk from them):**  While reducing risk is a good goal, the passage suggests the best way to do that is by not approaching them closely in the first place.



"
Anuchhed anusar musa bare tala madhye kun vakya sahi ho?,"Correct answer is **D: Uniharule aawashyak pare aafno rakshya garna sakchhan**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Musa (jaslai elk pani bhaninchha) swabhawik rupma akramak hundainan, tar yadi uniharulai kunai khatra mahasus bhayo bhane afulai bachaunechhan."" This translates to ""Mice (also called elk) are not naturally aggressive, but if they feel threatened, they will protect themselves.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uniharu prakritik rupmaa aakramak hunchhan (Mice are naturally aggressive):** The passage explicitly says they are *not* naturally aggressive.
* **B: Uniharu lai kahile kahi sambhavit jokhim manidaina (They never perceive any potential danger):** The passage states they *do* perceive danger and will react.
* **C: Uniharu lai najik ko manchhe le utprerit garna sakchhan (They can be provoked by nearby people):** The passage doesn't mention being provoked by people. It focuses on their reaction to feeling threatened.



"
Anuchhed anusar marabhumi ko yatri kaa lagi tala madhye kun kura sabai bhanda kam khatarayukta ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Chiso ratimaa nyaano kapada ko abhaav (Lack of warm, insulated clothing)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""tato luga bina hypothermia sanchchikai jokhim ho"" which translates to ""without warm clothes, there is a significant risk of hypothermia.""  This means a lack of warm clothing is a serious danger.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *least* dangerous:

* **B: Paani ko bhram dine mirage dekhnu (Seeing mirages of water):** While mirages can be disorienting and lead travelers astray, the passage doesn't portray them as the most dangerous.
* **C: Miraga lai pachhyauda urja khera falnu (Exhausting oneself chasing mirages):**  Exhaustion is a serious problem in the desert, but the passage highlights the risk of hypothermia more directly.
* **D: Miraga lai pachhyauda pani khera falnu (Exhausting oneself chasing water):** Similar to C, exhaustion is a danger, but hypothermia is presented as a more immediate and potentially more severe threat, especially without warm clothing.



Therefore, the lack of warm clothing is the most emphasized and directly linked to a significant risk in the passage.



"
Yea madhye kun kura marabhumi ko yatri kaa lagi sambhavit jokhim manidaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Pani ko abhaav (Lack of water)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions mirages, dehydration, heatstroke, and the risk of hypothermia.** It emphasizes the dangers of chasing mirages in the desert due to the risk of exhaustion and dehydration.  
* **While water scarcity *is* a major risk in a desert**, the passage doesn't explicitly state it as a *potential* danger mentioned in the context of the given text. It focuses more on the dangers associated with the mirages and the resulting behavior.
* **Mirages, hypothermia (without warm clothes), and sunburn are all directly mentioned as potential dangers.**

Therefore, lack of water is a general desert hazard but not a specifically highlighted risk *within the given passage*.



"
Anuchhed anusar anweshak ko aagaman le kun samuha ko janasankhya laai sabai bhanda dherai asar garyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Taínos**.

The text states: ""European anweshakharuko agamanko kehi thorai warshaharuma, spenka yoddhaharule tenosko janasankhya ullekhaniya rupma come garisakeka thee. Fray bartolom day lass kasas (tratado day lass indias)co adharma 1492 ra 1498co bichma spainy vijetaharule lagbhag 100,000 tynos mare.""

This translates to: ""In a few short years after the arrival of European explorers, Spanish soldiers significantly reduced the population of the Taínos. According to Fray Bartolomé de las Casas (Treaty of the Indies), approximately 100,000 Taínos died between 1492 and 1498.""

Therefore, the arrival of European explorers and Spanish soldiers had the most significant impact on the Taínos population.
"
Anuchhed anusar caribes le kun bhasa bolchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""caribharu araakan bhasha bolneharu thee jo karib 10,000 isapurvama aeka thee."" which translates to ""the Caribs were people who spoke Arawakan languages who arrived in the Caribbean nearly 10,000 years ago.""
"
Skiing lai manoranjanatmak karyakram ko rupma lokpriya banaunu maa kaslai shreya janchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sky bums**.

The text explicitly states: ""...skiing ek pramukh yatra gatiwidhi ho. **Sky bum** bhanera chinine utsahiharuka lagi skiing ek pramukh yatra gatiwidhi ho.""  This means ""sky bums"" are the enthusiasts who made skiing a popular recreational activity.
"
Anuchhed anusar skiing lai kahile khel ko darja dieyo?,"The correct answer is **D: 17au satabdi**.

The text states: ""Downhill skiing khel kamtima 17aun shatabdidekhi khelidai aieko cha..."" which translates to ""Downhill skiing has been played since at least the 17th century...""
"
Yea madhye kun lai purvi african tata ko sabai bhanda thulo tapu sanga jodera herne garincha?,"The correct answer is **A: European prabhav (European influence)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""15aun shatabdima europeli prabhawa ra upaniweshwad suru bhayo..."" (In the 15th century, European influence and colonization began...) This directly links the European influence to the region.
* The passage also mentions Madagascar's size and connection to Africa.
* While Islam has a presence (mentioned in relation to Comoros and Mayotte), and wild animals are a characteristic, the passage focuses on the *European* influence as a key historical development.
* ""Vilaasi resortka rupma parichit chan"" (known as luxurious resorts) describes a modern aspect, not a primary historical factor.

Therefore, the passage highlights **European influence** as a significant factor in the history of East Africa, especially around the time the large islands like Madagascar became known to the wider world.
"
Yea madhye kunle sana purvi african tapu haru lai janaudaina? ,"The correct answer is **A: France sanga ko sambandha** (Relationship with France).

The text explicitly states: ""Dherai jasta sanah tapuharu swatantra rashtraharu hun wa **francesanga sambandhit chan** ra vilasibich resortka rupma parichit chan."" (Many of these islands are independent nations and are known for their luxurious resorts, and **have a relationship with France**.)

While the other options are true about East African islands, they are not the *most* direct answer to the question of what distinguishes them. The question asks what is a characteristic *of* them, and their relationship with France is specifically mentioned as a defining feature in the text.
"
Anuchhed anusar paramparik church haru maa easter kasari manainchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sanibar rati nigrani (Saturday night vigil)**.

The passage states: ""Dherai paramparagat charchaharule prayaha easter saptahako antyama shanibar rati easter prarthana ayojana gardachan, jasma mandaliharule khrishtako punarutthanlai manauna thyakkai madhyarati utsava gardachan.""  This translates to: ""Many traditional churches try to organize Easter prayer on the last Saturday of Easter week, which is a mid-week festival for the congregation to celebrate Christ's resurrection.""

Therefore, Saturday night vigil is how traditional churches celebrate Easter according to the passage.
"
Ecuador pravesh garnu aghi kehi aawashyakta haru bata jogina euta cuban nagarik sanga suru ma ke hunu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Kanuni rupma garieko nimantrana patra (Legally issued invitation letter)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Equaderiako videsh mamila mantralayale yo patra vaidha hunu parchha ra kehi awashyakataharuko palana garnuhos."" This translates to ""This letter must be valid in the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and some requirements must be met.""  The context strongly implies that this ""letter"" is the legally required invitation letter.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Bhraman miti pachhi ko 6 mahina samma manya hune rahadani (Residence permit valid for 6 months after the travel date):**  While a valid passport is required for 6 months beyond your intended stay, the text specifically mentions a *letter* being required from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
* **C: Vasai ko avadhi pushti garna farkane ticket (Return ticket to confirm the duration of stay):**  A return ticket is required, but not the primary requirement mentioned in the text.
* **D: America ko green card (American Green Card):**  A Green Card holder gets exemptions under specific conditions, but it's not a general requirement for Cuban citizens entering Ecuador.

Therefore, a legally issued invitation letter is the crucial document mentioned in the text for a Cuban citizen entering Ecuador.



"
Ecuador kaa bhraman aawashakta haru ke kaa lagi design garieko hudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Migration ko bahav laai vyavasthit rakhne (To regulate the flow of migration)**.

Here's why:

The provided text details specific requirements for entering Ecuador, including passport validity, visa requirements for certain nationalities (like green card holders), and the need for travel tickets to prove length of stay. These measures are all designed to control and manage the number of people entering the country – essentially regulating migration.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Yatri ko sankhya nyunatam raakhne (To keep the number of tourists minimum):** The text doesn't focus on limiting the *number* of tourists, but rather on regulating the *process* of entry.
* **C: Yatri ko vasai avadhi ko pushti garne (To ensure the duration of stay of tourists):** While the text *does* require proof of length of stay, the primary purpose of these regulations isn't solely to ensure tourist durations, but to manage entry in general.
* **D: Raahadani ko vaidhata lai pushti garne (To ensure the legality of travel):** While related, this is a broader concept. The text specifically outlines the *requirements* for legal travel, which ultimately contribute to managing migration.

Therefore, the most accurate interpretation of Ecuador's travel requirements, based on the text, is to regulate the flow of migration.



"
Tala die madhye swadesh bhanda videsh maa kun kura mahango hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Uccha star ko frame (High-end frame)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""tyasta kshetrama upalabdha uccha antako brandka name framema dui samasya hoon sakcha.  gharbhanda badhi mahango hoon sakne hunale..."" which translates to ""In such a situation, high-end branded frames available in the market can have two problems. They can be more expensive than at home...""

This directly points to high-end frames being more expensive than in other locations. The other options are not directly addressed in the text.
"
Videsh maa uccha star ko frame kinnu ko sambhavit jokhim ke huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Prescription kehi frame ko lagi manya na huna sakchha** (The prescription may not be valid for some frames).

Here's why:

The passage states that buying high-end frames abroad can lead to two problems:

1. **High prices:** Frames in high-end markets can be significantly more expensive than in Nepal.
2. **Incompatibility with prescription:**  The passage explicitly mentions ""tyasta kshetrama upalabdha uccha antako brandka name framema dui samasya huna sakcha"" which translates to ""In such a field, the high-end brand name frames may have two problems"".  One of those problems is likely that the frames might not be compatible with the prescription.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely or not directly supported:

* **A: Aru thap aankha janch aawashyak huna sakchha (Another eye checkup may be necessary):** While potentially true, it's not a direct consequence of buying high-end frames abroad. It could be needed regardless of where you buy the frames.
* **C: Ti nakkali huna sakchhan (They may be counterfeit):**  Counterfeit goods are a risk anywhere, not specifically tied to buying high-end frames abroad.  The passage focuses on price and prescription issues.
* **D: Insurance le mulya lai na oghatna sakchha (Insurance may not cover the price):** This is a potential problem with insurance, but the passage doesn't discuss insurance at all.



Therefore, option B is the most directly supported consequence of buying high-end frames abroad as outlined in the provided text."
Falklands maa mudra ko prayog baare yea madhye kun vakya sahi ho?,"Correct answer is **C: Tapu chode pachhi falkland pound satnu parchha (You should bring your own money).**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Tapu bahira falkland mudra vinimaya garna lagbhag asambhawa hunale tapu chhodnaghi paisako adan pradan garnuhos.""  This translates to ""It is almost impossible to exchange Falkland money outside the islands, so you should bring your own money.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bahiri tapu harumaa credit card ra belayati pound matra swikar garinchha (In other towns, only credit cards and British pounds are accepted):** The text says Stanley is the *only* place where currency exchange is possible.  It doesn't say that credit cards and British pounds are *always* accepted in other towns.
* **B: Stanley matra tyasto thau ho jaha americi dollar swikar garinchha (Stanley is the only place where US dollars are accepted):** The text says Stanley accepts US dollars and British pounds, not just dollars.
* **D: Falkland pound bahek belayati pound sabai bhandha dherai swikarinchha (British pounds are accepted more than anything besides the Falkland pound):**  The text says Stanley accepts British pounds *and* US dollars. It doesn't give a comparison of how frequently each is accepted.



"
Anuchhed anusaar america bata falkland jada credit card bahek arko madhyam kaha upayogi hola?,"The correct answer is **A: FIC west store maa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tapuharuma british poundharu swikrit hunchhan ra stanko credit card ra sanyukta rajya americako dollar swikar garinchhan."" and ""Britis ra sanyukta rajyako mudra lieko bhae tapani tadhaka tapuharuma credit cardharu sambhawatah swikarya nahun sakchhan; swikarya bhuktani vidhi key ho bhani nirdharan garna maliksanga agrim rupma kura garnuhos."" and ""Tapu bahira falkland mudra vinimaya garna lagbhag asambhawa hunale tapu chhodnaghi paisako adan pradan garnuhos.""

This means:

*   Credit cards might not be accepted even with British or US currency.
*   It's very difficult to exchange Falkland pounds outside of the Falklands.
*   You should discuss accepted payment methods with the store owner beforehand.
*   You *can* exchange currency at the FIC West store in Stanley.

Therefore, the FIC West store is the only place mentioned where you can reliably exchange currency other than credit cards.

"
Yea madhye kun karyakram mandir ko utsavsanga jodera heridaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Hatti ko janma (Elephant's birth)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that elephant processions are part of the temple festivals, but it doesn't mention ""elephant's birth"" as a festival or event associated with the temples. The other options (Mandir ko warshik utsav - Temple's annual festival, Devata ko janmadin - Deity's birthday, and Mandir sanga samlagna pramukh ghatana haru - Major events associated with the temple) are all directly mentioned as types of festivals celebrated at temples.
"
Sajaieka hatti kaha dekhna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Mandir ko utsav kaa julusmaa (In the temple festival procession)**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""Susajjit hattiharu, mandirka wadakadal tatha any utsawaharusahitko niyamit lawalskarle garda kerlaka mandirma hune melaharu awalokan garna dherai ramailo hunchha."" which translates to ""Beautifully decorated elephants, along with the temple's floats and other festivals, regular processions are held in Kerala temples, making it very enjoyable to observe the fairs.""  This clearly indicates elephants are seen in temple festival processions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: november antyadekhi meko madhyasamma (From late November to mid-December):** This is the time frame for the festivals, not where you see the elephants.
* **B: Mandir haru maa (In temples):**  While elephants *are* present at temples, this is too general. The text specifies they are seen in processions.
* **D: Kerala ko bato harumaa (On the roads of Kerala):** While processions happen on roads, the text highlights the elephants specifically within the context of the temple festivals.



"
Anuchhed anusar tala die madhye kun tarikaa le business wa first class maa paisa jogauna sakinchha?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Company ko tarfa bata kharcha garda**।

अनुच्छेद में कहा गया है कि यदि कंपनी द्वारा खर्च किया जाए तो पहली श्रेणी (first class) या व्यवसायिक (business class) की यात्रा सस्ती हो सकती है, और पहली श्रेणी के लिए घर की तुलना में 6 गुना अधिक लागत आने की उम्मीद है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं:

*   **B: Business ko satta first class ko booking garda:** अनुच्छेद में इसका कोई उल्लेख नहीं है।
*   **C: Apratakshya first class udan ko booking garda:** अनुच्छेद में ""अप्रत्यक्ष प्रथम श्रेणी उड़ान"" का उल्लेख नहीं है।
*   **D: Chut khojda:** अनुच्छेद कहता है कि व्यवसाय और प्रथम श्रेणी की उड़ानों के लिए छूट खोजने की आवश्यकता नहीं है क्योंकि एयरलाइंस जानते हैं कि यात्री त्वरित और आरामदायक सुविधाओं के लिए अधिक भुगतान करने को तैयार हैं।"
Anuchhed anusar kehi shreni ka bhada booking garda yea madhye ke garnu samaya ko barbadi ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Chut haru (Discounts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Samanyataya bhannuparda, a dekhi b samma sidha udanma, business wa pratham shreniko sitharuka lagi chhuta khojnu bekar hunechha. Chhito ra aramdayi hune suwidhaka lagi shirsha dollar tirna icchuk flyerharuko ek nishchit core samuha cha tyas hisable charge garchha bhane airlineslai ramrosanga thaha cha.""

This translates to: ""Generally speaking, for direct flights from A to B, it's unnecessary to search for discounts for business or first class. There is a specific core group of flyers who are willing to pay a premium for quick and comfortable service, and airlines are well aware of this and charge accordingly.""

This implies that searching for discounts (""chut haru"") for business or first class is likely a waste of time, as airlines already have a defined pricing structure for those classes based on demand. Therefore, the passage suggests that looking for discounts on these classes is unnecessary.
"
Africa ko bhada ko dar vishwa bhraman ko bhada ko dar sanga tulana garda ke kura jodnu pardaina?,"The correct answer is **C: African bhisa ko mulya (African visa costs)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Africa bahirka tee sabai sthanharuka lagi atirikta praeshagya, prasthan curr, sthal yatayat, adika atirikta lagatharuma thapna nabirsanuhos."" which translates to ""For all other places outside Africa, you don't need to worry about extra expenses like visa fees, departure currency, local transportation, and other extra costs.""

This means visa fees are a concern for traveling *to* Africa, and not for traveling *around* the world. The other options are mentioned as things not to worry about *in* Africa, so they are not the answer.
"
Anuchhed anusar supermarket haru le ke kura ko vividh chanot dina thale kaa chan?,"The correct answer is **A: Tayari khana (Ready-to-eat food)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Badhdai gareka supermarketharule tayari khanaka thap vividh khand rakhiraheka chan.""  This translates to ""Established supermarkets keep a variety of ready-to-eat food.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Microwave ovens:** While mentioned, microwave ovens are described as *available* in some supermarkets, not a *variety* that supermarkets offer.
* **C: On-site restaurants:**  On-site restaurants are mentioned as being present in *some* stores/countries, not as a general variety offered by *all* supermarkets.
* **D: Kifaayati dar (Affordable price):** While supermarkets offer affordable prices, the passage focuses on the *variety* of things they offer, not just the price.



"
Tayari khana kinne grahak lai supermarket le dine kun suvidhaa aakarshak huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **A: On-site restaurants**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kehi deshharu wa kehi prakarka storeharuma kamtima ek system raheko restaurant huncha, june praya: jaso sasto mulyaka sath ek anaupacharik rupko huncha."" This translates to: ""In some countries or some types of stores, there is at least one restaurant system, which is cheap and has an informal character.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Kam vividh chanot (Fewer options):** The passage states supermarkets *offer* a wide variety of ready-made foods.
*   **C: Kaacho khana (Raw food):** The passage focuses on ready-made/prepared food.
*   **D: Microwave oven:** While some supermarkets *might* have microwaves, the passage mentions them in the context of heating pre-made food, not as a primary attraction for buying ready-made meals.

Therefore, the presence of **on-site restaurants** is the most direct and accurate benefit the passage highlights as attractive to customers buying ready-made food."
Yea madhye french bolne belgian ra swisle ke nabujhna sakchhan?,"The correct answer is **C: French sabda ko kehi uccharan (Some pronunciation of French words)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tathapi, sabai francelli bolne belgian ra swisle vidyalayaharuma manak francelli sikeka hunthe, taaki tapainle manak francelli sankhya pranali prayog garnubhaeko bhae tapainlai bujhna saksham huna sakun."" This translates to: ""However, in all French-speaking Belgian and Swiss schools, standard French is taught so that you can understand them even if you use the standard French number system.""  This implies that while there are differences (number system and pronunciation), standard French is taught to ensure mutual understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Manak french sankhya pranali (Standard French number system):** The passage mentions differences in the number system, but then says standard French is taught so you *can* understand even if you use the standard number system. So this is not the *reason* people might have difficulty understanding.
* **B: Anautha french sabdaharu (Unique French words):** The passage mentions differences in vocabulary, but doesn't highlight this as a major barrier to understanding.
* **D: France maa boline praya french (French spoken in France):** The passage compares the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland *to* French spoken in France, and notes differences, but the question asks what people might have difficulty understanding *between* Belgium/Switzerland and France.



Therefore, differences in pronunciation are a key factor that could lead to difficulty understanding.
"
Yea madhye kun kura france maa bhae jastai belgium ra switzerland maa chainana?,"The correct answer is **C: Vidhyalaya maa padhaine manak french (Standard French taught in schools)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Tathapi, sabai francelli bolne belgian ra swisle vidyalayaharuma manak francelli sikeka hunthe..."". This translates to ""However, in all Belgian and Swiss schools where French is spoken, standard French is taught...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sabai sabda ko uccharan (All word pronunciations):** The text mentions *some* differences in pronunciation, not that they are the same.
* **B: Sankhya pranali (Number system):**  The text says the number system is slightly different in Belgium and Switzerland.
* **D: Kehi french sabda ko hijje (Some French words' differences):** The text notes that there are differences in vocabulary, but it doesn't say they are significant.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is that standard French is taught in schools in both Belgium and Switzerland, allowing for mutual understanding.

Kun paridrishya maa shok bhada milne sambhavana hudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Tesro-party sewa bhanda sidhai wayusewaa sanga book garda**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sabai awasthaharuma, tapainle phone marfat sidhai airlinesanga book garnu pardachha."" (In all cases, you have to book directly with the airlines by phone.)
* **Option B directly contradicts this instruction.** Booking through a third-party service is *not* mentioned as a scenario where you *can* get a discount.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Westjet maa udan garda:** The passage lists Westjet as one of the airlines that offers shock bhada.
* **C: Paris bata america samma udan garda:** The passage doesn't specify any restrictions based on the origin/destination of the flight.
* **D: Delta maa udan garda:** The passage lists Delta as one of the airlines that offers shock bhada.



Therefore, the only scenario where shock bhada is *not* possible according to the passage is booking through a third-party service."
Shok bhada baare ke sahi ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Yasle antim samaya maa aayera garine bhraman ko kharcha behorchha** (It's a fare for last-minute travel).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kehi airlinesharule matra ajhai shock bhada pradan garchhan, jasle antim minetko antyeshti yatrako lagat thorai chhuta dinchha."" which translates to ""Some airlines only offer shock fares, which reduce the cost of last-minute travel.""
* ""Shock bhada"" refers to a discounted fare offered at the last minute.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yasle antyasti kharcha behorchha** (It incurs an additional expense) - While shock fares *can* be cheaper, the passage doesn't say it *always* incurs an additional expense. It's about a *reduction* in cost.
* **B: Yaslai wayusewa ko website bata sidhai book garnu parchha** (It must be booked directly from the travel agency's website) - The passage says you have to book *directly with the airline* by phone.
* **D: Yaslai phone bata wayusewa sanga sidha book garnu parchha** (It must be booked directly with the travel agency by phone) - The passage says you have to book *directly with the airline* by phone.

Kun awastha maa GPS navigation app bhanda standalone gps upakaran prayog garnu sahaj hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Jaba tapai dayarabhanda bahira hunu hunchha (When you are outside of data range).**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Yadi tapainsanga afno foneka lagi lagi data jadan chhaina bhane wa yo dayarabhanda bahira hunda, tiniharuko pradarshan simit wa anupalabdha hoon sakha.""  This translates to: ""If you don't have enough data for your phone, or if you are outside of data range, their (GPS navigation app) performance may be limited or unavailable.""

Standalone GPS devices don't rely on cellular data, so they work perfectly well even without a data connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jaba tapai paisa jogauna khojdai hununchha (When you are looking to save money):** While standalone GPS devices *can* save money in the long run, the immediate situation isn't the primary reason to use them.
* **B: Jaba tapai data connection cha bhanne maa vishwasta hunu hunchha (When you are confident in having a data connection):**  If you *have* a data connection, a GPS navigation app is generally more convenient.
* **D: Jaba tapai upakaran bhada maa lina chahanu hunna (When you don't want to rent a device):**  This is a reason to *choose* a standalone GPS, but not a reason why it's *more helpful* than an app.



"
Standalone upakaran bhanda gps navigation app prayog nagarne karan ke ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Paisa ko bachat (Saving money)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states: ""Yasale GPS ca lagi naya naksa kinne wa GPS upkaran kinne wa car bhada companybata GPS bhadama lyn lagne paisa bachat garna sakdachha."" (It allows you to save money on buying new maps or renting GPS devices from car rental companies.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Data connection bare chinta linu naparne (Don't worry about data connection):**  The text actually mentions that if you don't have enough data, the app's performance might be limited or unavailable.
* **C: Bhada baata joginu (Avoid renting):** While using an app *can* avoid renting, the primary reason highlighted in the text is saving money.
* **D: Naya naksa kinna naparne (Don't have to buy new maps):**  The text mentions not having to *buy* new maps, but the main point is the overall cost savings compared to renting or buying hardware.



"
Anuchhed anusar tapai upayukta jahaz sanga jodinu bhayo bhanne ko guarantee ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Galapagosko bhraman maa viseshagyata rakhne travel agent sanga booking garnu.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ukta agent vibhinna prakarka jahajharubare ramro gyan bhaeka galapagos visheshagya hun bhane kurako sunishchit garnuhos. Yasale nishchit gardacha key tapainka vishesh ruchiharu ra wa simitataharu uniharuka lagi sabaibhanda upayukta jahajka sath mileka chan.""

Translation: ""Make sure the agent has good knowledge about different types of ships and is a Galapagos specialist. This ensures that your special interests and limitations are matched with the most suitable ship for you.""

This directly links booking with a Galapagos specialist agent to getting a suitable ship based on your interests and limitations.  While the other options *might* be helpful, they aren't explicitly stated as a guarantee in the passage."
Pahuna lai juwaa khelai raakhna kun tarika ko prayog garidaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Gadhi ko abhav (Lack of Parking)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how casinos try to attract and retain gamblers by offering enticing perks and amenities. Let's analyze each option:

*   **A: Prakritik prakash ko prachurta (Abundance of natural light):**  Casinos *avoid* abundant natural light because it can make people more aware of the time and potentially discourage them from spending as much. They prefer dim lighting.  This is a strategy to keep players engrossed.

*   **B: Nisulka concert ticket ko prohotsaan (Promotion of free concert tickets):** This is a common perk casinos offer to attract and reward gamblers, fitting the pattern described in the passage.

*   **C: Thap payee padartha (Free alcoholic beverages):** This is a standard tactic used by casinos to encourage gambling, as alcohol can lower inhibitions and lead to riskier decisions. The passage explicitly mentions this.

*   **D: Gadhi ko abhav (Lack of parking):**  Lack of parking would be a *disadvantage*, not a strategy to attract gamblers. Casinos want to make it easy for people to get to them.  It wouldn't be a way to keep people gambling.

Therefore, the only option that isn't a method casinos use to entice gamblers is a lack of parking."
Anuchhed anusar euta chalakh juwadele ke kura bata joginu parchha?,"Correct answer is **B: Prohotsan lai swikarne (Accepting encouragement)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph describes how casinos try to keep guests happy and encourage them to spend more money.  The text mentions:

*   ""vishesh khana, payee ra manoranjanka karyaharu hunchhan"" (special food, drinks, and entertainment activities are available)
*   ""Atithiharulai ramro mudma rakhnaka lagi ra tiniharulai premium rakhnaka lagi uniharusanga prayaha..."" (To keep guests happy and treat them as premium...)

This indicates that casinos actively encourage gambling through various incentives and a pleasant atmosphere. Option B, ""Prohotsan lai swikarne"" (Accepting encouragement), directly reflects this behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dherai madira piune (Drinking a lot of alcohol):** While alcohol might be available, the text doesn't specifically mention encouraging excessive drinking.
*   **C: Ghadi herne (Looking at the watch):** The paragraph mentions that watches are kept, but it doesn't imply that looking at them is a sign of a clever gambler.
*   **D: Najik raheko bahira jane dhoka bare sodhpuchh garne (Asking about scams near the exit):** This is completely unrelated to the content of the paragraph."
Anuchhed anusar wakya ko bichma boliko kun bhag lai capitalized garinchha,"The correct answer is **B: Nam (Name)**.

The paragraph states: ""sabai namharu sadhain thulo aksharbata suru hunchha"" which translates to ""all names always start with a capital letter."" 

Therefore, the paragraph emphasizes that **names (nam)** are capitalized.
"
Anuchhed anusar nam lai capitalize garna le kun kura kathin banchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Lekhai (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""yadyapi lekhanma kehi kriya wa visheshan prayog garieko cha wa chhaina bhane kura patta lagaunaka lagi awashyak chha."" This translates to: ""However, it is necessary to note whether verbs or adjectives have been used in writing.""

This directly points to **writing** as the area where capitalizing names might be problematic and require attention. The other options are not mentioned as difficulties.
"
Malaysia ko durgam sthan haruma kasto ishara le bhetna aau bhanne bujhinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Chori aunlaa dobryaunu (shariratarfa chore aunlaa jhukaieko jastai)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yadyapi malesiama, kamtima gramin ilakama maleharuma, yasako earth """"bhetna au"""" bhane hunchha, shariratarfa chore aunlaa jhukaieko jastai..."" which translates to ""However, in Malaysia, at least in rural areas, it means ""hello"" by bending forward as if bowing...""

Therefore, ""chori aunlaa dobryaunu"" (bending forward) is the gesture understood as a greeting in rural Malaysia.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun isara le farki aau bhanne bujhincha?,"The correct answer is **A: Hatkela bhitra farkayera haat hallaunu** (Hand gesture turning inwards).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""spenka belayati yatrile haat hallaune wyaktitarfa hatkela farkaera (bidai garieko wyaktitarfa farkaunuko satta) bidai bhaniekolai farkera aune ishara sochna sakchhan."" This translates to: ""When saying goodbye, the person saying goodbye can think of the gesture of turning their hand inwards (towards themselves - signifying a farewell to the person leaving).""

Therefore, the gesture of turning the hand inwards is the one that signifies ""goodbye"" (farki aune ishara - the gesture that comes back).
"
Anuchhed anusar himdarar ke le banaauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Hiun pul (Ice bridges)**.

The text states: ""June hiun pulharudwara rokin sakdachha"" which translates to ""Ice bridges can stop the flow of glaciers.""

Therefore, the glaciers create ice bridges.
"
Anuchhed anusar hiun pul le yea madhye ke lai chopchha?,"The correct answer is **A: chiraharu (ice blocks)**.

The passage states: ""Himanadiko kinarka vishal blakharu chhuttin thalchhan, tall jharchhan ra sayed guddai kinarbata ajhai dherai tala pugchhan."" This translates to ""Large ice blocks break off from the banks of the glacier, collide, and many still reach the shore from the bank.""  The passage then says ""Hiun pulharudwara rokin sakdachha"" which means ""can be stopped by the ice bridge."" This indicates that the ice blocks (chiraharu) are what the ice bridge (hiun pul) blocks.

Therefore, the ice blocks are what the ice bridge intercepts.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun sthan ko bhraman garnu aghi yatru haru le thap sawadhani apnaunu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Goma waripari ko kshetra haru (Goma surrounding area)**.

The passage states: ""Goma yathochit surakshit bhae tapain goma bahirka kunai pani bhramanharuma uttari kibhu prantama raheko sangharshako awastha bujhna anusandhan garnu parchha.""  This translates to: ""Even if Goma is properly safe, you should research the state of conflict in the Northern Kivu province in any travel outside of Goma.""

Therefore, travelers should be cautious when traveling in the Goma surrounding area.  While Nyiragongo volcano is mentioned as an attraction, the passage emphasizes caution *outside* of Goma.
"
Yea madhye goma ko paryatak kaa lagi kun sujhav upayukta hudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttari kivu kaa udaan ramailo hunchha (Flying in Northern Kivu is enjoyable)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Goma is a gateway to climbing Nyiragongo volcano and a place to understand the conflict situation in the Northern Kivu province. It *doesn't* say that flying in Northern Kivu is enjoyable. The passage focuses on ground transportation (motorcycle taxis) and the volcano climb.
* Options B and C are directly mentioned in the passage as positive aspects of Goma for tourists.
* Option D is implied by the passage; it states Nyiragongo volcano is located in the city.

Therefore, the statement that ""Flying in Northern Kivu is enjoyable"" is the one not supported by the provided text.
"
August maa Suru ko miti ko lagi backcountry anumati kahile upalabdha hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: 1 April**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""mahinako pahilo dinma upalabdha hunchhan, suru hune mahinabhanda char mahina phile.""  This translates to ""available on the first day of the month, four months before the starting month.""

Since the question asks about August, the starting month, we need to subtract four months from August. That gives us April. Therefore, backcountry permits for August become available on April 1st.
"
Canyon ko suraksha garna kun niti lyaieko chha?,"The correct answer is **D: Simit sankhyaka anumati haru (Limited number of permits)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""anumatiharu ghatiko surakshaka lagi simit garieka chan"" which translates to ""permits are limited for safety reasons.""  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jo suru maa aauchha usailai anumati dine pranaali (First-come, first-served permit system):** While there's a ""first-come, first-served"" aspect to the permit availability, the passage also mentions limited numbers, making this incomplete.
* **B: Anumati haru 1 january maa matra upalabdha chhan (Permits are only available on January 1st):** This is false. The passage says permits are available on the 1st of the month, *four months prior* to the month you want to start camping.
* **C: Anumati haru walk-in anurodh dwara matrai prapta huncha (Permits are only available through walk-in requests):** The passage states that for popular areas, requests are filled through pre-application.



"
Anuchhed maa varnan garieka hotel harumaa ke bhetidaina?,"The correct answer is **A: cocktail bar**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph describes hotels from the 19th and 20th centuries as being frequented by wealthy and famous people, offering good food and a comfortable life. It mentions old Shailika fittings, new amenities, and a pleasant ambiance. 
* While the hotels offer comfort and attract notable guests, the text doesn't explicitly mention cocktail bars as a standard feature.
* The other options are supported by the text:
    * **B: Onsite gourmet restaurant:** The paragraph mentions ""ramro bhojan"" (good food).
    * **C: Parichit wa lokpriya pahuna haru (Familiar and popular figures):**  The text directly states that ""dhanidani ra dinka prasidha wyaktiharu basthe"" (rich and famous people stayed).
    * **D: Aadhunik upgrade sahit bharkharai marmat gariekaa kotha haru (Rooms renovated with modern upgrades):** The text mentions ""naya suwidha abhawa"" (new amenities).



"
Anuchhed maa prastut garieko jaankaari anusaar yea madhye kun suvidhaa hotel kaa pahuna harule kam prathamikta maa rakchhan?,"Correct Answer: **A: Hotel bhari rahekaa antique sajawat (Hotel filled with antique decorations)**

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Purano shailika fittingharu...uniharuko charitrako hissa hun"" which translates to ""Old Shailika fittings...are a part of their character."" This highlights the importance of the antique decorations in the hotel's history and appeal.  The other options are mentioned as *being* present, but the emphasis is on the historical significance of the old decorations.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Prasidha chef bhaeko restaurant (Restaurant with a famous chef):** While good food was part of the experience, it's not highlighted as a foundational feature like the antique decorations.
* **C: Ratri manoranjan pradan garne lounge (Lounge providing night entertainment):**  Night entertainment isn't mentioned at all.
* **D: Kifayati room dar (Affordable room rates):** The paragraph suggests these hotels were frequented by wealthy and prominent individuals, implying affordability wasn't a primary concern.

Therefore, the antique decorations are presented as a key element defining the character and history of these hotels, making them the most *kam prathamikta maa rakchhan* (least primary/most fundamental) of the listed amenities.
"
Anuchhed anusar greenland ghumna jane yatru le kun kura bata joginu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Varsha bhari mausam tato hune bhaekaa le bhari luga.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chiso mausam shayed tayari nagareka manisharule samana gareko ek matri wastawik khatra hoon sakha. Yadi tapain chiso mausam greenland bhraman garnuhuncha bhane (jati utter tapain januhuncha, tyati chiso huncha bane kurlai dhyanma rakhdai) paryapta nano kapda lyauna awashyak cha."" (Extreme weather might be a real threat to unprepared people. If you travel to Greenland during the cold season (the further north you go, the colder it gets), be sure to bring enough warm clothes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aparadh ko uccha dar bhaeka kehi kshetra haru:** The passage states there are no ""asubha kshetraharu"" (unsavory areas), so this is incorrect.
* **C: Kamjor internet connection kaa karan le online kam garne apeksha rakhnu:** The passage states that internet connection is generally good, so this is incorrect.
* **D: Greenland kaa aadivasi lai “eskimo” bhanera bolaunu:** The passage mentions that the term ""eskimo"" is considered offensive by Greenlandic people, but doesn't say travelers should *expect* to be scolded for using it.

"
Anuchhed anusar bina tayari greenland bhraman garne yatri kaa lagi kun kura kathin huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Mausam (Climate)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Chiso mausam shayed tayari nagareka manisharule samana gareko ek matri wastawik khatra hoon sakha."" This translates to: ""The cold weather might be a real danger for people who haven't prepared.""

While other options are mentioned, the paragraph focuses on the dangers of the cold weather and the need for appropriate clothing. It also mentions the risk of hypothermia and the importance of paying attention to Nordic light, which is related to the climate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nordic machad (Nordic light):**  While mentioned, it's not the *primary* difficulty for unprepared travelers. It's more of a related concern to the climate.
* **B: Aparadh (Crime):** The paragraph states that crime is rare in Greenland.
* **D: Sthaniya (Local people):**  The paragraph describes the locals as friendly and welcoming.



"
Yea madhye kun ahile kendriya plaza kaa rupma prayog hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kendriya plazako rupma un yasale karya garchha"" which translates to ""It functions as a central plaza"".  The text also introduces ""Jardín de la Unión"" as a place with a long history and various activities happening there.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: The Alley of the Kiss (Callegon dell beso):** The text mentions it as a historical house where children tell stories for money, not as a central plaza.
* **C: Temple of San Diego (Jasmadhye templo day saan diego):** While a significant landmark, the text describes it as a living building and doesn't say it functions as a central plaza.
* **D: Callejon del Beso (Callegon dell beso):** Same reason as B - it's a historical house, not a plaza.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun jardin de la unioun maa paidaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Concert bhaeko kendriya gajebo (The central gazebo where concerts are held)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""diunso ra beluka tyahan prayaha kendriya gajebobata diine n concertharu hunchhan"" which translates to ""In the evenings and weekends, concerts are usually held from the central gazebo.""

All the other options are mentioned in the passage:

* **B: Purano prem katha ko ghar (Old love story house):** ""Callegon dell beso (chumbanko galli). matra 69 centimetres alaggieko purano prem adarsh charitrako ghar ho."" (Callegon dell beso (kissing lane). It's an old house of romantic history, only 69 centimetres apart.)
* **C: Bagaicha tarfa farkieko restaurant (Restaurants facing the garden):** ""Tyahan bagaincha waripari thuprai resturentharu chan..."" (There are many restaurants facing the garden...)
* **D: Purano convent bhawan (Old convent building):** ""yassale karya garchha kendriya plazako rupma un yasale karya garchha"" (it functions as the central plaza) and ""... atriumko rupma nirman garieko thiyo, jasmadhye templo day saan diego ekmatra jiwit bhawan ho."" (... it was built in the form of an atrium, in which the San Diego temple is the only living building.)



"
Anuchhed anusar din ko paidal yatra bare kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Sanah bacha bhaeka pariwar kaa lagi bahira hune din ko paidal yatra upayukta hudaina** (Walking tours outside for families with small children are not suitable).

Here's why:

* The paragraph explicitly states: **""Sanah bachchaharu sahitka pariwarharulai thap tayariharu awashyak parna sakha, tara bachcha ra pri-schoolka bachchaharusanga pani dinma ghar bahira niscan sajilai sambhawa hunchha.""** (Families with small children can also make the necessary preparations, but it is possible for children and pre-school children to go outside for a walk during the day).

Therefore, option D contradicts the information provided in the paragraph. Options A, B, and C are all supported by the text."
Anuchhed anusar kun bela din ko paidal yatra ko lagi nyunatam tayari aawashyak huncha?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaba paidal yatri saririk rupmaa tandarusta chha (When the pedestrian is physically healthy).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sajilo batoma ek dine paidal yatraka lagi kehi tayariharu awashyak hunchhan ra kunai pani madhyam rupma feat wyaktile tiniharuko ananda lynn sakha."" This translates to: ""Some preparations are necessary for a comfortable walk in a simple path, and anyone can experience joy through it.""

While the passage mentions the enjoyment of walking in nature and that it can be done by families with children, it doesn't specify *when* preparations are necessary. The key phrase is ""kehi tayariharu awashyak hunchhan"" (some preparations are necessary). The most fundamental preparation, implied by the ability to enjoy the walk and avoid issues, is being physically healthy.  Without basic health, any walk, regardless of the path or who's participating, would require preparations to mitigate risks.

The other options are not the most general or necessary preparation:

* **B: Jaba bato sajilo chha (When the path is easy):** An easy path is a *benefit* of a walk, not a necessary preparation for *any* walk.
* **C: Jaba balbalika paidal yatra maa janechhan (When children are going on a walk):**  Children add complexity, requiring extra precautions, but health is still the foundational requirement.
* **D: Jaba paidal yatra prakritik watawaran maa garinchha (When the walk is done in a natural environment):**  Walking in nature is enjoyable, but health is needed to enjoy it, regardless of the environment.



"
Baki norway bhanda rogaland wa agder ma raheka uccha samasthali haru ma ke bhinnata chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Tyaha rukh chhainan (There are no trees there)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yea uccha samasthaliharu pry """"bide"""" bhanera chininchhan jasko earth chauda, khula rukhwihin antariksha ra asimit wistar ho.""  This translates to: ""These high plateaus are called 'wide' because they have a vast, open, treeless expanse and limitless width.""

Therefore, the key difference between the high plateaus in Rogaland and Agder compared to Norway's fjords is the **lack of trees** on the plateaus.  The fjords, on the other hand, are characterized by their connection to the sea and the presence of water (fjords).



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tyaha fyord chainan (There are no fjords there):**  This is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions fjords in Norway (""Norweyma thado fyord ra..."").  Rogaland and Agder might not *have* fjords, but the statement isn't that they don't.
* **C: Uccha samasthali haru praya saman chhan (The high plateaus are almost the same):** The passage highlights a *difference* - the presence or absence of trees.
* **D: Ti praya heather le bhariekaa hunchhan (They are mostly covered with heather):** While heather can grow in open, rocky areas, the passage doesn't mention heather specifically. The focus is on the lack of trees.



"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun norway ko lagi swabhavik hoina?","The correct answer is **B: Jungle bhaeko uccha samasthali (High plateaus covered in jungle)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph describes Norwegian highlands as ""bide"" - characterized by vast, open spaces, sparse trees, and a sense of limitless expanse. 
* The paragraph explicitly mentions that the highlands in Rogaland and Agder are known for their ""open spaces"" and are often referred to as ""bide"".
* A jungle-covered plateau would be the opposite of this description – dense vegetation, enclosed spaces, and not an open, expansive landscape.

Therefore, a jungle-covered plateau is *not* a typical feature of Norwegian highlands according to the text.  The other options (open land, fjords, and moorlands) all align with the description provided."
Skiing maa ruchi bhaeka paryatak le kahile parwat station ko bhraman garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Peak season maa (During peak season)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that during the tourist season in the Himalayas, hill stations usually offer healthy and beautiful surroundings. It also mentions skiing and snowboarding as activities available at many hill stations.  Skiing is a winter sport, and therefore, it's practiced during the peak winter season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jado maa (When it's...):** This is incomplete and doesn't specify a time of year.
* **C: Indian garmi maa (During Indian summer):**  This is incorrect because Indian summer is generally too hot for skiing.
* **D: Vasanta maa (During Spring):** While spring can be pleasant, it's typically too late in the season for good skiing conditions.
"
Anuchhed anusar parwat station haruma kahile dherai paryatak hunchhan?,"The correct answer is **C: Indian garmi maa**.

The paragraph states: ""Parwat stationharuka lagi paryatakiya mausam bharatiya garmiko awadhima sadharantaya wriddhi hunchha."" This translates to: ""For mountain stations, the tourist season generally increases during the Indian summer.""

Therefore, option C is the accurate answer.
"
Yadi tapai sahayog ko lagi dunga khojdai hununchha bhane ke nagarna upayukta hunchha?,"The answer is **A: Dock tala mathi garnu (Doing deck work)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the process of finding work as a deckhand. It emphasizes proactively seeking out opportunities, offering help, and networking.  ""Dock tala mathi garnu"" (doing deck work) is a direct and helpful action a deckhand can take to show their willingness to work and get noticed.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Captain sanga mitrata gasnu (Becoming friendly with the captain):**  While building rapport with the captain is *good*, it's not the most *immediately* useful action when actively seeking work.  The passage encourages broader networking.
* **C: Aafno sewa ko prachar garnu (Advertising your services):** This isn't explicitly mentioned in the passage. While being known is important, the passage focuses on demonstrating skills and willingness to work through actions.
* **D: Dunga kaa aru yatru haru lai vevasta garnu (Arranging things for other passengers on the boat):** This is helpful, but less directly related to finding *deckhand* work itself. It's more about being a helpful passenger.



Therefore, doing deck work is the most appropriate action to take when looking for work as a deckhand, according to the passage.



"
Sahayog ko lagi dunga ko khoji garda marinas ko waripari ke garnu prarchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sailor sanga samparka garnu (Contact sailors)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states that when looking for a ride, you should:

*   ""barma nawikharusanga sampark gurney prayas gardne"" - try to contact Burmese sailors.

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **B: Radar muni basnu (Sit under the radar)** - This is not mentioned or implied.
*   **C: Uniharula yachat safa gariraheko bela matra najik janu (Only approach them when they are cleaning their boat)** - While approaching is part of the process, the text encourages contacting them in general, not just when they are cleaning.
*   **D: Aru hitchhiker bata tadhai rahanu (Stay away from other hitchhikers)** - This is not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is to **contact sailors**.
"
Tapu ko aupaniveshik itihas ko bare maa ruchi rakhne paryatak ko lagi kun sthan upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttari kinara (Northern bank)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hangkang tapuko adhikansh sahari wikasko punah kabza garieko bhumiko uttari bank ghana rupma bharieko cha. Belayatle yo sthan afno upaniweshka rupma lie ra tapain kshetrako aupaniweshik wigatka pramanharu khojdai hunuhunchha bhane suru garnaka lagi yo ramro sthan ho.""

This translates to: ""The northern bank of most of Hong Kong's urban development is densely packed. The British used this place for their settlement and if you want to start searching for the historical evidence of the area's settlement, this is a good place.""

Therefore, the northern bank is the best location for tourists interested in Hong Kong's colonial history and settlement. While Kowloon waterfront and Victoria Harbour are popular tourist spots, the passage specifically points to the northern bank for historical context.
"
Manmohak drishya lai prathamikta maa rakhne paryatak ko lagi kun sthan upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Kowloon waterfront**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hangkang tapuko adhikansh sahari wikasko punah kabza garieko bhumiko uttari bank ghana rupma bharieko cha.

Rikab maa sawari garne ko khutta aljhine jokhim kam garna kehi gadi maa ke hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Surkasha patti (Safety plate)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions ""suraksha pattiharu"" (safety plates) are now used in some horses, especially those used for tourist rides.** These plates are designed to detach from the saddle if the rider falls backward, preventing the dog (the person riding) from being dragged along.
* The question asks what is used in the horses to reduce the risk of a dog being dragged.
* ""Surkasha patti"" directly translates to ""safety plate,"" which is the mechanism described in the text to prevent dragging.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sanghuro paitala (Hard brass)**: While brass might be part of a saddle, it doesn't directly relate to preventing a rider from being dragged.
* **C: Chhalako rikab (Fake saddle)**: The text doesn't mention fake saddles being used to reduce risk; it highlights the *safety plates* on real saddles.
* **D: Dherai sthirta (Great stability)**: While stability is desirable, the text focuses on preventing dragging, not just ensuring the rider stays put.  Stability alone isn't a safety feature against being dragged.



"
Sawari jutta ko kun viseshata le rikab prayog garda sawari garne ko suraksha badhauchha?,"The answer is **D: Farakilo paitala (Weighted metal)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how some saddles now have safety patches that detach from the saddle and fall away if the rider falls backward. This mechanism relies on a weighted metal part (farakilo paitala) within the saddle. The weight helps the patch detach, preventing the rider from getting trapped under the horse or saddle during a fall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khasro ra sanghuro paitala (Special and strong metal):** While strong metal is important for a saddle, the text focuses on the *weighted* aspect of the metal for safety.
* **B: Chala (Lever):** A lever isn't directly related to the safety mechanism described in the text.
* **C: Taluwa (Reinforcement):** Reinforcement is a general term and doesn't specify the safety function mentioned in the text.



"
Aatithya aadanpradaan sanjal maa yatri lai ke prastav garinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sthaniya host sanga awas (Accommodation with local hosts)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Atithi Sewa (which is Couchsurfing) connects travelers with locals in the cities they are visiting. The primary offering is a place to stay with these locals.
* While the passage mentions the founder's motivation was to find affordable accommodation, it doesn't directly state that the platform *provides* cheap flights.  ""Sasto udan"" (cheap flights) is a motivation, not a service offered *by* the platform.
* ""Sthaniya guide dwara tour"" (tour by a local guide) is a possible benefit users *might* find, but it's not the core service of Couchsurfing.
* ""Eutai gantavya bhraman garne aru yatru haru sanga samparka"" (contact with other travelers going on the same sightseeing trip) is also a possible benefit, but again, not the primary purpose.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is that Atithi Sewa connects travelers with local hosts for accommodation.



"
Anuchhed anusar aathitya aadanpradaan sanjal sambandhi kun kura sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Yatri haru lai jahile sthaniya host ko lagi sandharva pradan garinchha** (It provides a platform for travelers to find local hosts).

Here's why:

*   The paragraph states that Atithi Sewa Adanpradan Sanjal connects travelers with locals in the cities they are visiting. It *doesn't* say it provides a platform *for* local hosts to find travelers. The focus is on connecting travelers *to* locals.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: Kehi sanjal haru lai yatru ko thap pramarikarn aawashyak parcha** (Some networks require traveler identification). - The paragraph explicitly mentions this.
*   **C: Yatri hari lai gantavya sahar maa upalabdha host haru ko suchi pradan garinchha** (It provides a list of available hosts in the destination city to travelers). - The paragraph states this.
*   **D: Kahile kahi sthaniya host ko samiksha yatru haru lai upalabdha garainchha** (Sometimes reviews of local hosts are available to travelers). - The paragraph mentions this.



"
Anuchhed anusar sajha hostel kothama kasto prakaar ko pahuna bhetne sambhavana kam huncha?,"Correct Answer: **A: Wishau varsha ko pahuna (Wishau varsha ko pahuna)**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hostelharu mukhyataya yuva wyaktiharulai khan-panko prabandha gardachan - wishaun shatabdiko wishishta pahuna - tara tapain prayaha tyahan bridha yatriharulai pani bhettauna saknuhunchha.""

This translates to: ""Hostels mainly manage young people - the main guests are those celebrating New Year's. But you can often meet elderly travelers there too.""

Therefore, the main guests (and thus, the most likely people to be found in shared hostel rooms) are those celebrating the New Year (Wishau varsha).
"
Anuchhed anusar hostel maa basne sambawana kasko badhi hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bharkhar janmeko bacha liera ghumne jodi (A couple traveling with a young child)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bachchaharu bhaeka pariwarharu durlabh drishya hun..."" (Families with children are a rare sight...). This implies that hostels aren't typically geared towards families with young children. However, the passage also mentions: ""...tar kehi hostelle niji kotha tiniharulai anumati dinchha."" (...but some hostels allow them private rooms).

Therefore, the likelihood of families with young children staying in a hostel increases when the hostel offers private rooms. Option A, ""Bharkhar janmeko bacha liera ghumne jodi"" (A couple traveling with a young child), represents a family with a young child, and the passage suggests they *might* be able to stay if the hostel has private rooms.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: Sangai ghumne 22 varshiya tin janaa (Three 22-year-olds traveling together):** This is a common group of travelers, and the passage doesn't highlight any specific challenges for them staying in a hostel.
*   **C: 70 varsha nagheko ek jodi (A couple who are 70 years old):** While elderly couples might stay in hostels, the passage focuses on the rarity of *families with children*.
*   **D: Aafna chorachori sanga ghumne dui pariwar (Two families traveling with their pets):** The passage doesn't mention anything about pets, making this option irrelevant to the context.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun wakya le boomerang throwing lai sahi rupma janauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yadi sahi tarika le fyakne ho bhane yo farkera aafnai haat maa aauchha (If thrown correctly, it returns to your hand).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Tapain afno hatma farkera aune bummeryang fyaankna sikna chahanuhunchha bhane afutira farkera aune uchit khalko bummeryang cha bhane kurako sunishchit garnuhos"" (If you want to learn to throw a boomerang that returns to your hand, make sure you get the right kind of boomerang that returns). This directly implies that a properly thrown boomerang *does* return to the thrower.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yo paryatak bhanda sthaaniya bich badhi lokpriya chha (It is more popular among locals than tourists).**  The passage doesn't discuss popularity among locals versus tourists.
* **C: Austrailia maa dherai boomerang upalabhdha chainan (Many boomerangs are not available in Australia).**  The passage says the *majority* of boomerangs available in Australia *don't* return, not that they're unavailable.
* **D: Kehi boomerang matrai farkina sakchhan (Some boomerangs can only return).** The passage implies that the *correct* boomerang *will* return, but doesn't suggest that *some* boomerang types are limited to returning.



"
Javanese khana maa visesh gari ke ko prayog garinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Nariwal ko chiny (Coconut sugar)**.

The text states: ""jabhanese nariwal chiny (vishesh gari jabhanese nariwal chiny)"" which translates to ""Javanese coconut sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar)"".  This indicates that coconut sugar is a prominent ingredient in Javanese cuisine.

While the text mentions other ingredients like palm sugar (gula jawa), peanuts, and various fragrant spices, it specifically highlights coconut sugar in relation to Javanese food.
"
Anuchhed anusar sankraman rog kasari failinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sankramit manis (Infected person)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Sankramit wyaktiko chheuchhauma rahanda sajilai sarne rog sankramak rog ho."" This translates to ""Infectious diseases are diseases that spread from a person who is infected.""

While the other options are related to infectious diseases, they aren't the primary way the disease spreads *according to the paragraph*. The paragraph explicitly highlights the role of an infected person.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun le garda sankraamak rog nahune maanincha?,"The correct answer is **A: Khop (Airborne)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sankramit wyaktiko chheuchhauma rahanda sajilai sarne rog sankramak rog ho"" which translates to ""Infectious diseases are diseases that spread through the air carried by infected people.""  Therefore, the passage emphasizes the risk of airborne transmission.

While viruses, bacteria, and fungi *can* cause infectious diseases, the passage specifically highlights the danger of diseases spread through the air (Khop). Options B, C, and D are specific types of pathogens, not the mode of transmission emphasized in the passage.
"
Kasto awastha maa prayogkarta lai vyaktigat vpn pradayak bhanda web proksi ko chanot garda paryapta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Prayogkarta http traffic reroute garna chahanchhan** (The user wants to reroute HTTP traffic).

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes that VPNs reroute *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP.**  This is a key difference.
* **Option C directly addresses the capability of web proxies to only handle HTTP traffic.**  If a user *only* needs to access websites using HTTP (standard web browsing), a web proxy is sufficient.
* **Options A, B, and D describe situations where a VPN would be *more* appropriate.** They involve concerns about broader traffic rerouting, privacy/surveillance, and high bandwidth needs, which are all strengths of VPNs.

Therefore, if the user's sole need is to reroute HTTP traffic, a web proxy is the simpler and likely sufficient solution.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun vakya vpn ra web proksi kaa bare sahi hoinan?,"Correct Answer: **D: Vpn le http traffic matra reroute garna sakchha**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tiniharule http matra nabhaera sabai antarik traficlai punah nirdeshit garchhan."" This translates to: ""They (VPNs) do not only redirect HTTP traffic but all internet traffic.""

Option D says ""Vpn le http traffic matra reroute garna sakchha"" which means ""VPN can only reroute HTTP traffic."" This is the opposite of what the passage says.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: Vpn le web proksi bhanda uccha bandwith dinchha** (VPN provides higher bandwidth than web proxies) - The passage says VPNs generally offer higher bandwidth and better service quality.
*   **B: Web proksi le sabai web traffic reroute garna sakdaina** (Web proxies cannot reroute all web traffic) - The passage states that VPNs reroute *all* internet traffic, implying that web proxies do not.
*   **C: Web proksi ko sewa gunastar vpn bhanda kam hunchha** (The service quality of web proxies is worse than VPNs) - The passage suggests VPNs provide better service quality.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage."
Aafno tatkal ko kshetra bhanda bahira ko phone company ko prayog ko anumati kasle dinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Global phone numbers**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prayaha tapainle global number chhuttai kinnu parchha jasle PSTN phoenharulai tapainlai phone garna anumati dinchha.""  This directly indicates that global phone numbers are what grant permission for PSTN phones to call the user.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Internet routed calls:** While internet routing is *used* to make these calls, it's the *global phone number* that provides the necessary permission for PSTN connections.
* **C: Upagraha:**  (Subsidiary/Outpost) is a location where internet access is available, but not the mechanism that allows calls to be received from traditional phones.
* **D: PSTN phones:**  PSTN phones *need* the permission granted by a global phone number to be able to call the user. They don't grant permission themselves.



"
Anuchhed anusar kehi call prapta garna ke garnu parcha?,"Correct Answer: **A: Global number kinnu parchha**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Prayaha tapainle global number chhuttai kinnu parchha jasle PSTN phoenharulai tapainlai phone garna anumati dinchha."" This directly translates to ""You will almost certainly have to buy a global number which allows PSTN phones to call you.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sthaniya phone company ko prayog garnu parchha (Use a local phone company):** The passage explicitly says you *don't* need to use a local phone company.
* **C: Aafno sthaniya samudaya bata euta number linu parchha (Take a number from your local community):**  The passage says you don't *need* a local number.
* **D: PSTN phone kinnu parchha (Buy a PSTN phone):** The passage says you need a global number to allow PSTN phones to *call* you. You don't necessarily need to buy a PSTN phone itself.



"
Yea madhye kun le italian sabda ko uccharan lai sahi ruple janaudaina?,"Correct Answer: **B: Praya sabda lekhie jasari ucharan garinchhan**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Italian pronunciation differs from the written form (lekhieanusar uchcharan garine hunale italianma uchcharan tulanatmak rupma sajilo cha).  Therefore, the statement that words are generally pronounced exactly as they are written is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Duita r euta r bhanda farak tarikale ucharan garinchha:** This is too general. While there are differences, it doesn't pinpoint the core issue.
*   **C: c ra g bhaeka sabda haru mushkil hunchhan:**  The text mentions 'c' and 'g' as key letters to pay attention to, implying they can be tricky, but it doesn't say *all* words with 'c' or 'g' are difficult.
*   **D: Praaya sabda ko ucharan tyas pachi aaune swor dhwoni anusar bhina huna sakchha:** This is partially true (vowel sounds influence pronunciation), but it's not the *main* point the text is trying to make. The core difference is between written form and spoken pronunciation.



"
Izmir ko kun viseshata aadhunik samay bhanda aghi utpatti bhaeko ho?,"Correct answer is **D: Rato tile bhaeko chhath (Red-tiled roofs)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Thulla bolebhardharu, shishale dhakeka bhawanharu ra adhunik kinmail kendraharu paramparik rato-tile bhaeka chhatharule bharieka chan...""  This indicates that the red-tiled roofs are a *traditional* feature, existing *before* the modern development of the city. The passage contrasts these traditional elements with the modern infrastructure.  The other options (ferry terminals, glass buildings, and shopping malls) are described as modern additions.



"
Yea madhye kun kurale izmir lai sahi rup maa janaudaina?,"Correct Answer: **B: Watawaran le paramparik turkey lai pratibimbit garchha**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""yadyapi yass shaharko watawaran paramparagat tarkikobhanda bhumadhya yuropko jasto chha."" This directly contradicts option B, which claims the atmosphere *does* reflect traditional Turkey.

Let's look at why the other options are *correct* according to the passage:

*   **A: Sahar le euta thulo khadi lai ghereko chha** - The passage doesn't explicitly mention this, so this is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Tyaha aadhunik kilmel kendra ra purana church dubai bhetinchhan** - The passage mentions modern malls and old churches.
*   **D: Yo turkey ko dosro thulo bandargaha ho** - The passage states, ""tesro sabaibhanda thulo sahar, istanbulpachhiko dosro sabaibhanda thulo bandargah bhaeko ra..."" (it's the third largest city, the second largest port after Istanbul...).

Therefore, option B is the only one that incorrectly describes Izmir based on the information provided in the passage."
Hanami sabdale ke ko awalokan janauchha?,"Correct Answer: **A: Cherry kaa full (Cherry blossoms)**

**Explanation:**

The text states that ""Hanami"" refers to the tradition of viewing cherry blossoms. The question asks what the word ""Hanami"" initially refers to.  The text directly links Hanami to the viewing of cherry blossoms (""cherry fuliraheko herne""). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"
Cherry kaa full awalokan garne pahilo party haru ko aayojana kasle garyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Japanese kulin sadasya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Afno ra shahi adalatka any kuleen sadasyaharuka lagi matra japanma pahilo cherry blasm party ayojana garieko thiyo."" This translates to ""Only for themselves and other noble members of the royal court, the first cherry blossom party was organized in Japan.""  These noble members are identified as ""Japanese kulin sadasyaharuka"" (Japanese noble members).
"
Anuchhed anusar jerusalem ko kun paksha le paryatan lai sabai bhanda kam aakarshit garchha?,"Correct Answer: A: Sahar ko dharmik mahatwa

**Explanation:**

The passage explicitly states: ""Sahar ko dharmik mahatwa ra vishesh gari purano sahari kshetraka dherai sthalharuko karanle, jeruselam israelka mukhya paryatakiya kshetraharumadhye ek ho.""

This translates to: ""Due to the city's religious importance and especially the many places in the old city, Jerusalem is one of Israel's main tourist areas.""

While historical sites (D) and cultural uniqueness (C) contribute to tourism, the passage emphasizes the religious importance as the primary driver.  Option B is incorrect because the passage doesn't state that Jerusalem being Israel's capital is the main attraction.
"
Yea madhye kun kura anuchhed maa jerusalem ko viseshata ho bhanera ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Rajnitik prabhav (Political influence)**.

Here's why:

The passage heavily emphasizes Jerusalem's **religious significance** (holy to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), its **historical significance** (ancient city), and its **cultural significance** (historical sites). It also mentions it being a major tourist destination.

However, the passage *doesn't* explicitly discuss Jerusalem's **political influence**. While it's implied that the city's status is complex due to its claim as a capital, it's not a central theme of the paragraph.

Therefore, ""Political influence"" is the one aspect not specifically highlighted in the provided text.
"
Anuchhed anusar kasta yatri lai wild card ko kharid le faida puryaudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Kruger rashtriya nikunj matra ghumne yatri lai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dakshin africa wa tyataka sabai rashtriya nikunjharuko parkharuko chayanma praesh pradan gurney wild card kinna pani yo labhadayak huna sakcha.""  This translates to: ""In addition, anyone who buys a wild card can benefit from entry to all national parks in South Africa.""  

Therefore, the wild card is beneficial for those who visit *multiple* national parks, specifically mentioning Kruger National Park as one of them.  Option B, ""Kruger rashtriya nikunj matra ghumne yatri lai"" (a tourist who only visits Kruger National Park), would *not* benefit from the wild card because the benefit is tied to visiting *other* parks as well.



"
Yea madhye kun vakyale kruger rashtriya nikunj lai sahi rup maa janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo dakshin africa ko sabai bhanda sano rashtriya nikunj ho** (This is the smallest national park in South Africa).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Parkley 19,500 kimi2 ogatchha ra yasalai 14 bhinna paristhitik kshetraharuma vibhajit garieko cha..."" (The park has an area of 19,500 sq km and is divided into 14 different ecological zones...). This indicates Kruger National Park is *not* the smallest.  The area is quite large.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Yo Dakshin africa ko pramukh aakarshan ho** (This is a major attraction of South Africa) - The text explicitly says ""Dakshin africako mukhya akarshan madhye yo ek ho"" (It is one of the main attractions in South Africa).
* **B: Park kaa thuprai ecozone haru ma vibhinna jungli wanyajantu bhetinchhan** (Different wild animals can be seen in the various ecozones of the park) - The text states ""yasalai 14 bhinna paristhitik kshetraharuma vibhajit garieko cha"" (it is divided into 14 different ecological zones) and implies diverse wildlife.
* **D: Yaslai wild card kinera ghumna sakinchha** (You can visit it by buying a wild card) - The text says ""Dakshin africa wa tyataka sabai rashtriya nikunjharuko parkharuko chayanma praesh pradan gurney wild card kinna pani yo labhadayak huna sakcha"" (For that, a wild card can also be beneficial for choosing a park among all national parks in South Africa).



"
Yea madhye kun kura le himal ko thado bhag chadhne parvatarohi kaa lagi khatara nimtyauna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bhijeko awastha (Wet condition)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tyasto bhaninchha key, shwas band hune apeksha huncha ra thado anshaharuma sawadhani apanaunu parchha, vishesh gari jab bhijeko huncha, yo chhittai khatarnak huna sakcha.""  This translates to: ""It is said that one should expect shortness of breath and be cautious in the third section, especially when wet, this can be extremely dangerous.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Dhunga ka khutkila (Rock crevices):** While rock crevices are a hazard on mountain climbs, the passage mentions rock steps (""dhungako paila"") being placed for stability.
* **C: Sana gufa (Small cave):** The passage describes the cave as ""ekdamai sano ra sanghuro"" (very small and narrow) and mentions it needs to be crossed, but doesn't highlight it as a primary danger.
* **D: Steel ko cable (Steel cable):** The steel cable is mentioned as providing assistance and a railing, suggesting it's there for safety, not a primary danger.



"
Yea madhye kun wakya le machu pichu himal ko aarohan lai sahi rup ma pratibimbit gardaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Thado bhag haru maa kunai haindrail chainan (The third section has no handrails).**

Here's why:

The provided text *specifically* mentions that the third section of the Machu Picchu ascent has steel cables for support railings. Option B directly contradicts this by stating there are *no* handrails. This is a factual inaccuracy according to the description.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

* **A: Tandarusta parvatarohi laai pani sas badhna sakchha (Even healthy mountaineers may experience shortness of breath):**  The text says the climb is steep and involves a significant elevation change, making shortness of breath a likely outcome.
* **C: Tupa ma gufa bhitra pasnu parchha (One has to go inside a cave):** The text explicitly mentions a small, narrow cave that needs to be crossed.
* **D: Bhijeko bela thado bhag khatarapurna huncha (The third section is dangerous when wet):** The text warns of the third section being dangerous, especially when wet.



Therefore, option B is the only one that misrepresents the information given in the text about the Machu Picchu ascent.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun majorcan khana ko pramukh hissa hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: Gedagudi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Majorcan cuisine as being based on bread, vegetables, and meat (specifically a special kind of lamb), with olive oil being a key ingredient.**
* **Pauroti** is a type of flatbread, and the passage mentions ""roti"" (which is similar) as a staple. So, it *is* a major part.
* **Sabji** means vegetable dish, and the passage explicitly states ""tarkari"" (vegetables) are a core component. So, it *is* a major part.
* **Meat** (especially lamb) is highlighted as a significant element. So, it *is* a major part.
* **Gedagudi** is a type of rice and lentil dish common in some parts of India, and it's *not* mentioned in the description of Majorcan cuisine.

Therefore, Gedagudi is the one that doesn't fit the description of Majorcan food.
"
Anuchhed maa ullekh bhaeko jankari anusar hangi khana ko bare kun wakya sahi hoina?,"Correct Answer: **B: Hangi le wellington maa upalabhda tato dhunga ko prayog garchha**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Hangy khanalai jaminko tato khaldoma pakaincha. Khaldolai key tata agobata tato dhungale tato dhungale tatainchha wa kehi sthanharuma bhutapiya taple jaminko kshetralai prakritik rupma tato banaunchha."" (Hangi is cooked in the earth's heat.  Sometimes hot stones from the fire are used to heat it, or in some places, hot springs create natural heat in the ground.)
* **The passage *mentions* Christchurch and Wellington as places where hangi can be found,** but it doesn't say that hangi *uses* hot stones *specifically* from Wellington. It simply indicates its presence in those locations.
* **The other options are directly supported by the passage:**
    * **A:** ""Geothermal hang le khaalto tatauna aago bata tato dhunga ko prayog garchha"" - The passage mentions using hot stones heated by fire.
    * **C:** ""Roast dinner praya hangi ko prayog garera pakainchha"" - The passage states hangi is used for cooking a traditional roast dinner.
    * **D:** ""Geothermal hangi rotarua maa bhetihnchha"" - The passage says geothermal hangi is found in rotarua.

Therefore, option B is the incorrect statement based on the provided text.



"
Yea madhye kun tarika hangi ko khaldo laai tataune swabhavik tarika hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Gas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes hangi as a method of cooking where food is placed in earth ovens heated by geothermal activity.** This is the traditional and natural way to cook hangi.
* **Geothermal tap (C)** and **hot rocks (B)** are both part of the natural heat source for hangi.
* **Gas (A)** is a modern, artificial heat source and not a traditional or naturally occurring method for hangi.

Therefore, gas is the option that doesn't align with the passage's description of the natural hangi cooking process.
"
Yea madhye kun kurale garda bhikshu ra bhikshuni bata visesh manyata paina sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ghuda bhanda mathi samma ko skirt ko pahiran** (Wearing a skirt above the knee).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mathharuko bhraman garda, mahilaharule ghunda dhakne skirt laganuparchha ra uniharuko kandha pani chhopieko hunuparchha. Dheraijaso gumbale vinatayari aune mahilaharuka lagi chadar upalabdha garaunchhan. tar tapainle afain chadar lear aunubhayo ra ajha tyo ujyalo rangko cha bhane tapainle praeshdwarma bhikshu wa yogibata muskan paunuhunecha."" 

This translates to: ""While traveling in the mountains, women wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders. For many women who come with a lot of humility, chadar (a shawl) is available. But if you yourself have experienced wearing a chadar and today it is faded, then you will receive a smile from monks and yogis at the doorstep.""

The text then contrasts this with men: ""tyasai gari, purushharule ghunda dhakine gari trouserharu lagaunu awashyak hunchha. Yo pani praeshdwarma stockbatt udharo lynn sakinchha tar tyo luga harek prayogkartale lagaepachhi dhoieko chhaina tyasaile tapain yea skirt lagauna sahaj mahasus garna saknuhaunna. eutai akar sabai purushharuka lagi feat huncha!""

This translates to: ""Similarly, men need to wear trousers that cover their knees. This can also be obtained from the doorstep's stock, but the clothes have not been washed after each use, so you can feel comfortable wearing a skirt like this. One style fits all men!""

The implication is that wearing a skirt *above* the knee is considered disrespectful, especially to monks and yogis.  The text connects wearing a faded chadar with a smile from monks, implying a respect for humility and perhaps a disregard for ostentation. Therefore, wearing a skirt above the knee would be the opposite.

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: Ghuda bhanda mathi samma ko skirt ko pahiran** (Wearing a skirt above the knee): This is the correct answer, as explained above.
* **B: Chadar ko pahiran** (Wearing a shawl): The text connects faded chadar with a smile, but not with wearing chadar generally.
* **C: Trouserharu ko pahiran** (Wearing trousers): This is mentioned as the style for men, not the disrespectful style for women.



"
Yea madhye kun kapada gumba maa upalabdha hune sambhavana kam hunchha? ,"The correct answer is **B: Shorts**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dheraijaso gumbale vinatayari aune mahilaharuka lagi chadar upalabdha garaunchhan."" (Many women come to the monastery wanting a chadar.) This implies that chadar (a type of cloth/scarf) is readily available.

It also says: ""tar tapainle afain chadar lear aunubhayo ra ajha tyo ujyalo rangko cha bhane tapainle praeshdwarma bhikshu wa yogibata muskan paunuhunecha."" (But if you yourself get a chadar and it's a bright color, then you will get a smile from the monks or yogis at the gate.) This reinforces that chadar is common.

The text then mentions that men need to wear trousers and that these can be found at the monastery. However, it also points out that these trousers might not be washed after each use, making them uncomfortable.

**Shorts are not mentioned at all in the text**, making them the least likely item to be readily available in the monastery. The other options (Skirt, Trouser, Khada) are mentioned or implied as being available. Therefore, shorts are the answer.
"
Antartic kshetra ko bhraman maa paryatak lai tara herne awasar kahile prapta huncha?,"The correct answer is **A: Garmi mahina maa** (During the summer months).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Arctic and Antarctic regions are best for witnessing the aurora borealis (Northern Lights) and experiencing the midnight sun (sun never sets). This occurs during the summer months in these regions.

*   **Garmi mahina maa (Summer months):** This is when the sun remains above the horizon for extended periods, allowing for the midnight sun phenomenon and the aurora displays.
*   **Manis kam bhaeko samaya maa (When people are less busy):** While tourism might be lower during certain times, it's not the primary reason for aurora viewing.
*   **Jado ko mahina maa (During the winter months):** The opposite is true - winter months in these regions have prolonged darkness, making it difficult to see the midnight sun.
*   **Jaba prakash ko pradusan kam hunchha (When light pollution is low):** While low light pollution is important for seeing the aurora, it's not the determining factor for *when* you have the opportunity to see it. The aurora is more frequently visible during periods of higher solar activity which often coincide with the summer months.



"
Kun bela satelite phone mobile ko satta maa prayog garnu wyavaharik hudaina?,"Correct Answer: **A: Jaba sight line ko sateline sanga ko jadan maa badha hunchha**

Here's why:

* **Satellite phones** require a clear line of sight to a satellite to function. If there's an obstruction (like mountains, dense trees, or buildings), the phone cannot connect.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Yadi sthan dherai durgam chha:**  While satellite phones are useful in remote areas, the remoteness itself isn't the *reason* they might be impractical. The crucial factor is the line of sight to the satellite.
* **C: Yadi ghar bahira prayog garda:** Using a satellite phone outdoors is perfectly normal and expected.
* **D: Yadi yatra maa kehi visesh data ko awashyakta huncha:** Satellite phones *can* be used for special data needs while traveling, but the line of sight requirement is still the primary limitation.

Therefore, a blockage in the line of sight to the satellite is the primary reason satellite phones are not practical.
"
Satelite phone kun awastha maa mobile bhanda upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Dunga ko yatra maa (On a boat journey)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that satellite phones are a *solution when mobile phone coverage is unavailable* in remote locations.
* A boat journey often takes place in remote areas where mobile phone signals are unlikely to be available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sahar ghumda (Exploring the city):**  In cities, mobile phone coverage is usually readily available, making a satellite phone unnecessary.
* **C: Jaba durgam data ko awashyakta hudaina (When there is no need for remote data):**  The text specifically mentions using satellite phones for remote data, audio, and other needs.
* **D: Jaba mobile ko coverage hune sambhavana badhi huncha (When the possibility of mobile coverage increases):** This contradicts the entire premise of using a satellite phone - it's used *when* mobile coverage is *not* available.



"
Yea madhye kasto dwanda le transnistria republic ko sirjana bhayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Jatiyata (Ethnicity)**.

The text states that Moldova is a multi-ethnic country plagued by ethnic conflict. The creation of Transnistria was a direct result of these ethnic tensions. While economic factors might have played a role, the underlying cause was the conflict between different ethnic groups within Moldova.
"
Yea madhye kun kura transnistria ganatantra ko moldova bhanda farak chha?  ,"Correct answer is **C: UN ko manyata (UN की मान्यता)**.

Here's why:

* **Transnistria** is a self-declared independent state that is **not recognized as a member of the UN**.
* **Moldova** is a recognized member of the UN.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bhasa (भाषा):** Both Moldova and Transnistria use Romanian as an official language, although Transnistria also uses Russian widely.
* **B: Dharma (धर्म):** Both countries predominantly follow Orthodox Christianity.
* **D: Mudra (मुद्रा):** Transnistria has its own currency, but Moldova also has its own currency. The key difference is the international recognition.



Therefore, the lack of UN recognition is the most significant difference between Transnistria and Moldova."
Anuchhed anusar yadi yaatri hawahuri ko awastha baata jogina chahanchhan bhane kun bela montevideo ko bhraman garda upayukta hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttari golarda ko jado ko mahina** (The winter months in the Northern Hemisphere).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Montevideo bhu dakshinma rahekole, uttari golardhama jadoyam hunda tyahan grishmayam hunchha ra yastai viparit huncha."" This translates to ""Montevideo is located in the southern hemisphere, so when it is winter in the northern hemisphere, it is summer there, and vice versa.""

Therefore, if someone wants to avoid heat and humidity, the winter months in the Northern Hemisphere (which correspond to summer in the Southern Hemisphere where Montevideo is) would be the most suitable time to visit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Montevideo ko sukha season** - The passage says there are no distinct wet or dry seasons, so there isn't a specifically ""dry season"" to aim for.
* **C: Uttari golarda ko garmi ko mahina** - This would correspond to winter in the Southern Hemisphere, which would be the hottest time in Montevideo.
* **D: Montevideo ko jado ko mahina** - This would be summer in the Southern Hemisphere, which is the hottest time in Montevideo.



"
Anuchhed anusar yadi yatri lai jado mausam man parcha bhane montevideo kahile ghumda upayukta hunchha?,"Correct answer is **A: Montevideo maa garmi huda**

**Explanation:**

The passage states: ""Garmi mahinaharuma, +30degcbhanda mathiko tapman samanya ho."" This translates to ""In the summer months, the temperature is usually above +30 degrees Celsius.""  The question asks when a traveler would prefer to visit Montevideo if they like warm weather. Therefore, the answer is when it's hot in Montevideo (garmi huda).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uttari golarda maa garmi huda:** The passage contrasts Montevideo's climate with the northern hemisphere's climate.
*   **C: Montevideo ko barkha mausam:** The passage says there are no distinct rainy or dry seasons, implying the rainy season wouldn't be a preferred time for someone seeking warm weather.
*   **D: Uttari golarda maa jado huda:** Again, this compares Montevideo to the northern hemisphere and isn't directly related to a preference for warm weather in Montevideo.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun kura le vidhwansa bhanda euta sthaapit graffitti kalakar laai janauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Graffitti kala (Graffiti kala)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yadyapi, ajkal sthapit graffiti kalakarharu, graffiti karyakramharu ra """"kanuni"""" bhittaharu chan. yass sandarbhama graffiti pentingharu pry: awaidhanik tagharubhanda pani kalakriti jastai dekhinchhan.""  This translates to: ""However, nowadays there are established graffiti artists, graffiti programs, and ""legal"" walls. In this context, graffiti is increasingly seen as art rather than illegal tagging.""

This clearly indicates that established graffiti artists are recognized for their artistic skill and that graffiti is considered art. Options B, C, and D are not mentioned in the passage as factors that distinguish a professional graffiti artist from someone who might cause damage.
"
Sangit maghotsaw ko kun paksha sahbhagi haruka lagi anubhav ko abhinna hissa ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Sthal maa camping garnu (Camping in the area)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tapain karyako najik hoon chahanuhunchha bhane sangitko najik euta camping khetra prapta garna chhittai pugnu parchha."" (If you want to be close to the music, I can easily arrange a camping area near the music.) and ""Kehi chadharuma sanah parivar sahitka sanah balbalikaharuka lagi vishesh shivir khetra rakhieko cha."" (A special camping area has been arranged for small families with children in some tents.)

This indicates that camping is a key part of the music festival experience.  The other options are not directly mentioned as a core part of the festival experience as described in the text.
"
Anucched anusar mahotsav maa upasthit hune le sangit ko chheu maa camping garne bhae ke kura lai prathamikta dinu parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Rati jane (Staying until late at night)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mukhya charanharuma sangeet samapta bhae tapani, beluka ratisamma sangeet zari rahane chadaparvaka kehi anshaharu hoon sakchhan bhane kurama vishesh dhyan dinu pardachha."" This translates to: ""Even after the main program ends, there might be some lingering music until late at night, so special attention should be paid to staying until late at night.""

The passage emphasizes the possibility of music continuing late into the night, making ""staying until late at night"" the most important consideration when planning camping near the music.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Pariwar bhaeko kshetra maa basne (Staying in the family area):** While mentioned, this is for specific groups (families with children) and not the general priority for all camping near the music.
*   **C: Off-site maa camping garne (Camping off-site):** The passage specifically offers camping *near* the music, not off-site.
*   **D: Bihan chadai uthnu (Waking up early):**  This isn't mentioned as a priority in the passage.



"
Anuchhed anusar aagantuk harule new mexico maa ratri jiwan khojda kun thau bata tadha rahanu parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: piyobals**.

The passage states: ""Dherai piyobalsharu jati nai tadha bhae tapani, tapain albuquerq wa santa fay yatra nagari paryapta ratri jeevan pauna saknuhaunna."" This translates to ""Even though many pueblos are inhabited, you can still find enough nightlife in Albuquerque and Santa Fe."" So, the passage indicates that pueblos are a place where visitors can find nightlife.
"
Anuchhed anusar agantuk le uttari new mexico maa parichit manoranjan kaha bhetne sambhavana huncha?,"The correct answer is **C: Santa fe najik ko casino**.

The paragraph states: ""Yadyapi, mathi suchikrit garieka lagbhag sabaijaso casinoharule payee padartha bechdachhan ra timadhye dheraijasole name-brand manoranjan (prathamik rupma vishal albuquerq ra santa feko waripariko) pradan garchan.""  This translates to: ""However, almost all listed casinos sell alcohol and many provide name-brand entertainment (primarily around the outskirts of the large Albuquerque and Santa Fe areas).""

Therefore, casinos near Santa Fe are a place where visitors can find entertainment. Option C accurately reflects this.
"
Budget bare sachet yatru harule kasto kisimko peya padartha bata tadhai rahanu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Sthaniya bear**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Yahan dherai francelli wine upalabdha chan tar newzealand ra astreliako wine lear janu ajha ramro hoon sakha. **Sthaniya tapp pani peon purnataya surakshit cha** tar tapain daraunuhunchha bhane botalko pani sajilaisanga bhetna sakinchha.""

This means local beer is a good option for budget-conscious travelers. While other drinks are mentioned, the text highlights local beer as a safe and reasonable choice, especially compared to imported wines.
"
Anuchhed maa varnan garieko kshetra anusar tala die madhye kun peya padartha order garda server jhukkina sakchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: short black**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Australialiharuka lagi """"sada seto"""" kafiko vichar videshi ho.  chhoto callo """"espresso"""" ho, capuchino krimasahit mathi auncha (finj jasto hoina) ra doodh binako chia diinchha. Hut chocolate belgiumko manak starma cha."" This describes ""sada seto"" as a ""short black"" coffee, which is essentially espresso without milk.
*  The passage also says ""arko sthaniya biyarlai """"manta"""" bhaninchha"" which refers to local beers, specifically ""number wann"" which is described as a fun and flavorful beer. Servers wouldn't need to bend over to bring this.
*  The passage mentions availability of French wines and suggests New Zealand and Australian wines, but doesn't specify anything about needing to bend over for those.
*  While the passage says you can bring your own tapp (tap/beer) to be sure of its safety, it doesn't imply a server would bend to bring *any* specific wine.

Therefore, a ""short black"" (espresso) is the drink where a server might bend down to bring it, as it's a smaller, often served in a small cup.



"
Tin satabdi sanga raheko upaniwesh ko awadhi kun samuha le suru gareko thiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

The text states: ""Spainyharule aupaniweshikaran suru gare june teen shatabdisamma rahyo."" (The Spaniards started colonization and stayed for three centuries.)
"
Anuchhed anusar euta parisian lai najik lyaaune sabai bhandha ramro tarika ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Binamra bannu (Being humble)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Jabki yo prayaha ek galat paramparagat sanskar matra ho, june kunai wyakti jastai """"bean elebhe"""" (ramrosanga lyaieko) co jasto wyawahar gardai paris jaane uttam tarika bhaneko tapainko uttam wyawahar hunu ho. yasale pugnalai ekdamai sajilo banaune cha."" 

This translates to: ""While this is just a wrong traditional custom, the best way to approach people is to behave like someone who is """"bean elebhe"""" (friendly/approachable) and goes around with good manners. This makes the Parisian very easy to approach.""

The paragraph explicitly suggests being ""bean elebhe"" which implies humility and friendliness.  Option C, ""Binamra bannu"" (being humble), best captures this meaning. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun gun paramparagat rup maa parisian ko ho bhanera manidaina?,"The answer is **D: Aakasmikta (Impulsiveness)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph explicitly states that the behavior described is a ""wrong traditional custom.""** It criticizes the behavior as arrogant (""ahankari""), rude (""asabhya""), and boastful (""ghamandi"").
* **The paragraph contrasts this behavior with good manners.** It says good manners make interactions ""easy"" and that Persians are ""suddenly pleased"" when basic etiquette is followed.
* **""Aakasmikta"" (Impulsiveness) is not mentioned as a characteristic of the Persian custom being criticized.** The paragraph focuses on arrogance, rudeness, and boastfulness – traits that are not directly synonymous with impulsiveness.

The other options are directly mentioned:

* **Ahankar (Arrogance)** is directly mentioned.
* **Asabhya (Rude/Impolite)** is directly mentioned.
* **Chanchalta (Fickleness/Changeability)** isn't explicitly mentioned, but the emphasis on a ""wrong traditional custom"" implies a lack of consistent, well-defined manners, which could be associated with fickleness. However, it is not as directly supported as the others.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **Aakasmikta** because it is the least supported by the text, which focuses on arrogance, rudeness and boastfulness.
"
Cape town ko metroRail ko pratham shreni ko faida ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Tesro shreni ko ticket bhanda sasto (Cheaper than third class tickets)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Metroplus badhi aramdayi ra come bhidbhad hunchha tar thorai mahango cha, yadyapi yuropko samanya metro tikat bhanda sasto hunchha.""  This translates to: ""Metroplus is more comfortable and crowded, but a little expensive, although it is cheaper than a typical European metro ticket.""

Option C directly reflects the statement that Metroplus is cheaper than the third class ticket (""tesro shreni ko ticket""). The other options are not mentioned or supported by the text."
Anunchhed anusar cape town ko pratyek yatru rail maa ke hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Pahilo ra tesro dubai shreni kaa dabba (First and third class compartments)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states there are two classes on the Cape Town rail system: Metroplus (first class) and Metro (third class).
* It also mentions that each train has both Metroplus and Metro compartments.

Therefore, option D accurately reflects the information provided in the passage.  The other options are incorrect because:

* A: ""Kam bhid bhaeko metro ko dabba"" (Compartments with less crowding) is not directly mentioned as a class of service.
* B: ""Dubai shreni ko ticket ko mulya saman"" (Similar ticket price to Dubai class) is incorrect; the passage compares Metroplus tickets to European metro tickets.
* C: ""Tin farak shreni"" (Three different classes) is incorrect; the passage only mentions two classes.

Prepaid phone card kaha kinna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kuna kaa dokaan haru maa** (In any shop).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Bhuktani phone wa sadharan telefonharubata prayog garna sakine prepaid store phone cardharubata prayog garna sakine harek kunako store bharieko huncha."" This translates to ""Prepaid store phone cards can be used with Bhuktani phones and regular phones. Each store fills them up."" This indicates that you can buy them in various shops.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Wisesh mulukharumaa (In special countries):** The text doesn't mention this.
* **B: Train station maa (At the train station):** The text doesn't mention this.
* **D: Pay phone maa (At a payphone):** Prepaid phone cards are *not* typically bought at payphones.

Therefore, ""Kuna kaa dokaan haru maa"" (In any shop) is the most accurate answer based on the given text.
"
Kehi card haru le dine ramro call rate kasari upbhog garna sakinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Yaslai wisesh muluk maa matra upabhog garna sakinchha (It can only be used in special countries.)**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Kehi deshharuka wishishta samuhaharulai sasto call darr pradan garnama mahira bhae pani sabai card kahinpani call garna uchit chan."" (Even if some cards are designed to provide cheap call rates to specific groups, it is not appropriate to call everywhere with all cards.) and ""Yea sewaharuko pahunch prayaha fonebata nee:shulk call garna sakine toll-free telephone nambarmarfat hunchha."" (Access to this service is primarily through toll-free telephone numbers.)

This implies that the cards have usage restrictions, and some are limited to specific countries. Option A directly reflects this restriction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Toll-free number dwara (Through toll-free number):** While toll-free numbers are mentioned as a way to access *some* cheaper calls, it doesn't explain how to use *specific cards* effectively.
* **C: Kuna ko store maa (In which store):** The text mentions storing the cards in stores, but it doesn't explain how to use a card to get better rates; it simply refers to the storage location.
* **D: Pay phone ko prayog garera ra thap shulka tirera (By using a pay phone and paying the fee):**  This is not related to the card usage mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the most accurate answer explaining how to use cards for better rates is that their usage is limited to certain countries.
"
"Anuchhed anusar, yea madhye kun rukh Plitbhais tall raashtriya nikunja maa tyati paaidaina?","The answer is **C: Devdar (Spruce)**.

The passage states that the national park is primarily decorated with various types of trees, a mix of alpine and **temperate** vegetation.  Spruce trees are a common type of coniferous tree found in temperate and alpine regions. The other options are not specifically mentioned in the text, but spruce is the best fit based on the description of the park's vegetation.

The passage mentions European brown bears, lynx, owls, wild cats, and capercaillie, which are animals commonly found in areas with spruce forests."
Yi madhye kun durlabh jivjantu Plitbhais tall rashtriya nikunj maa bhetinchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: capercelli**.

The text states: ""Europeli khairo bhalu, bwaanso, chill, ullu, wanbiralo, jungli biralo ra **capercelli** jasta durlabh jantuharuka sathai dherai sadharan prajatiharu pauna sakinchha.""

Therefore, capercelli is listed as a rare animal found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Anuchhed anusar kshetra code le ke maa sahayata garchhan?,"The correct answer is **B: Bazar niyantran (Market control)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Khetra kodharuko wastawma awaidh pratilipimathi kunai pani prabhawa hundaina; diskako bitle mulle jastai prati beat pratilipianusar kunai pani upkaranma thik play gurney cha. Wastawik uddeshya bhaneko tee companyharulai uniharuko bajarma badhi niyantran dinu ho; yo sabai paisako chakrabare ho.""

This translates to: ""In reality, illegal copies do not have any impact on the market price; each illegal copy plays perfectly on any device just like the retail price of a disc. The real intention is for these companies to increase control over their market; it's all about money.""

The paragraph explicitly says the *real intention* of the media companies is to gain more control over their market, not to stop piracy or affect illegal copies themselves. While the companies *claim* they are trying to stop piracy, the paragraph argues that this is a false pretense for market control.
"
Anuchhed anusar media compay haru le kshetra code ko bare maa kun juth failauchhan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ti bazar niyantran garna aawashyak chhan** (They claim it's necessary to control the market).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wastawik uddeshya bhaneko tee companyharulai uniharuko bajarma badhi niyantran dinu ho; yo sabai paisako chakrabare ho.""  This translates to: ""The real intention is to give these companies more control in their market; this is all about money."" The passage explicitly says the companies are falsely claiming they are trying to ""rokna piracy"" (stop piracy) when their real aim is market control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Tin le gairkanuni pratilipi bata jogauchhan** (They are fighting against illegal copies) - The passage claims they are *lying* about this.
*   **C: Ti paisa kamauna sahayog garchhan** (They help to earn money) - While the passage mentions ""paisako chakrabare"" (a cycle of money), it's not the *false claim* they are making.
*   **D: Tin le viralai piracy lai rokchhan** (They are stopping piracy) - This is what the passage says they are falsely claiming, not what they are *actually* doing.



"
Aafno grihabhumi aauda kun prakriya anaupacharik hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Bhansar niyantran (Boundary control)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What process regarding your land is unofficial?""
* **The provided text states:** ""Bhansar niyantran asuwidhajanak hoon sakcha (Boundary control can be inconvenient/problematic).""  The text then implies that this inconvenience is due to unofficial processes.
* **Therefore, boundary control (Bhansar niyantran) is the process described as potentially being unofficial.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adhyagaman janch (Surveying/Mapping):**  While surveying *can* be part of a legal process, it's not inherently unofficial.  Official surveys are a standard part of land registration.
* **B: Saman ko ghosana (Public announcement):**  Public announcements are often required by law and are not usually unofficial.
* **C: Saman ko kanuni sima (Legal boundaries):**  Legal boundaries are defined by law and official documentation, making them the opposite of unofficial.



"
Grihabhumi aaunu aghi kun kura thaha paunu jaruri hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Yadi tyahaa bhansar niyantran chha bare (If there is a bungalow control there)**.

Here's why:

The initial statement (P) directly mentions that the presence of bungalow control can make it difficult to access the land. It specifically asks if the person is aware of this and will make a legal declaration.

Option C directly addresses this concern.  The other options are related to potential legal and logistical issues, but the core issue raised in P is the difficulty due to bungalow control.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun kura prachur matra maa huda parwatarohi le lagatar cochamo upatyaka bhitra naya marga patta lagauchhan?,"The correct answer is **D: Bhitta (Cliffs)**.

The passage states: ""vishwaka sabai bhagbata parwatarohiharule yasaka anant sambhawit parkhalharuka bichma nirantar naya margharu sthapana gardaichhan."" which translates to ""All climbers are continuously establishing new routes among the infinite possibilities of its cliffs.""  Therefore, climbers are continuously establishing new routes on the cliffs (bhitta) of Cochamo.
"
Anuchhed maa dieko jankaari anusar dakshini golarda maa kasle dherai warpaar lagaauchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Yadyapi, star alliancele purvi dakshin prashantako santiago day lah chilidekhi tahitisamma bahek sabai kura sametchha..."" This translates to ""However, Star Alliance includes everything from Santiago de Chile in the East Pacific to Tahiti, except..."" indicating that Star Alliance has the most extensive coverage in the Southern Hemisphere mentioned in the text.

The other options are incorrect:

* **SkyTeam:** The text explicitly says SkyTeam doesn't offer any flights across all three oceans.
* **South Pacific:**  The South Pacific is a region, not an airline alliance.
* **LATAM Oneworld:** LATAM is mentioned as having a specific flight route (LATAM Oneworld flight) but not as an alliance with broad coverage across the Southern Hemisphere.



"
Kun vimaan gathabandhan le dakshini golarda maa sabai bhanda kam mahasagar ko waripaari lagauchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Star alliancele purvi dakshin prashantako santiago day lah chilidekhi tahitisamma bahek sabai kura sametchha..."" which translates to ""Star Alliance covers everything from Santiago de Chile in the eastern South Pacific to Tahiti, except..."". This implies Star Alliance has the fewest ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere among the options provided.

The other options are either incorrect or not directly supported by the text:

*   **B: South Pacific** - This is a geographical region, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: LATAM Oneworld** - This is a specific flight option mentioned, not an alliance with a broader coverage.
*   **D: SkyTeam** - The text specifically says SkyTeam does *not* cover any crossings across the three oceans.

Therefore, Star Alliance is the only option directly supported by the text as having the fewest ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere.

The passage states: ""Global running tourseko uttaradhikari, go running toursele char mahadwipma darjanaun citerning pradayakharulai sanjalma joddachha."" This translates to ""Global running tours' affiliate, Go Running Tours, connects with experienced guides in four continents online.""
"
Anuchhed anusar go running tour le kati wata drishya awalokan sanstha laai jodchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Char (Four)**.

The passage states: ""Global running tourseko uttaradhikari, go running toursele char mahadwipma darjanaun citerning pradayakharulai sanjalma joddachha."" This translates to: ""The Global Running Tours' representative connects around a dozen experienced guides in four continents online.""

Therefore, Go Running Tours connects to **four** observation/experience providers.
"
Chituwa ko spasta awalokan garna chahane paryatak le ke garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Durbin ko prayog garnu parchha**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Sinha, cheeta ra chituwa kahilekanhi lajaunchhan ra tapain durbinbata herera tinlai ajha ramrari dekhnu hune cha.""  This translates to: ""Lions, cheetahs, and tigers often come close, and you can see them clearly by looking through binoculars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Safari paidal yatra maa janu parchha (Safari paidal yatra maa janu parchha - Go on a walking safari):** While walking safaris *can* offer opportunities to see tigers, the text specifically mentions using binoculars for a clear view.  It doesn't say a walking safari is the *only* way.
* **B: Jhadi ko paidal yatra maa janu parchha (Jhadi ko paidal yatra maa janu parchha - Go on a bush walk):**  This is a more general term and doesn't directly address how to see tigers clearly.
* **D: Gadi liera standard upakaran ko prayog garnu parchha (Gadi liera standard upakaran ko prayog garnu parchha - Go by car and use standard equipment):** The text doesn't mention using a car, and specifically highlights binoculars as a key tool for viewing tigers.



"
Anuchhed anusar aagantuk le gadi maa sawari garda kasto kisim ko janawar bhetna sakchhan?,"The correct answer is **B: jiraf**.

The passage states: ""Kehi janawarharu, jastai hattiharu ra jirafharu, car ra stariya upkaranka najik jaan ruchaunchhan ramro drishya herne mauka dinechha."" This translates to: ""Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, like to come near cars and other vehicles, providing a good opportunity to see them.""

Therefore, according to the passage, tourists can see giraffes while riding in a car during a safari.
"
Anuchhed anusar ke garna le bhraman ko kharchha ghatchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Cha wa badhi ko samuha bhetdaa (Meeting a group of four or more people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yatraharu thulla samuhama sasto hunchhan, tyasaile tapain ekjana matra hunuhunchha wa ekjana matra sathisanga hunuhunchha bhane, ramro prati-wyakti mulyaka lagi any manisharusanga bhetera chardekhi cha janako samuha nirman gurney prayas garnuhos.""

This translates to: ""Travels are cheaper in large groups, so if you are only one person or just with one friend, try to meet other people and try to form a group of people for a good individual value.""

Therefore, forming a group of four or more people (cha wa badhi ko samuha) is recommended for cheaper travel.
"
Anuchhed anusar bhraman ko ramro dar kasle haat parne sambhavana badhi hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Tin janako samuha (A group of three people)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Yatraharu thulla samuhama sasto hunchhan, tyasaile tapain ekjana matra hunuhunchha wa ekjana matra sathisanga hunuhunchha bhane, ramro prati-wyakti mulyaka lagi any manisharusanga bhetera chardekhi cha janako samuha nirman gurney prayas garnuhos.""

This translates to: ""Travels are cheaper in large groups, so if you are alone or with just one friend, try to meet other people and try to form a group of people for a good value for money.""

The paragraph implies that forming a group, and specifically mentions ""janako samuha"" (a group of people), is beneficial for a better value.  While a group of three is not explicitly stated, it's the most logical conclusion from the statement encouraging group formation and the implied cost savings. The paragraph suggests aiming for a group larger than just a couple of people.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Gadi ferbadal garna manne paryatak haru (Tourists who change cars):** This is irrelevant to the paragraph's main point about group formation.
* **C: Sangai yatra garne dui sathi haru (Traveling with two friends):** The paragraph explicitly suggests forming *larger* groups than just two friends to get better value.
* **D: Panch jana ko samuha (A group of five people):** While a group of five would be good, the paragraph doesn't specifically mention that a group of five is the ideal size; it just advocates for forming a group. A group of three is a good middle ground suggested by the advice.



"
Anuchhed anusar san francisco ko vishwa prasidhi mathi kasko yogdan chha?,"The correct answer is **A: Kala ra media kaa vibhinna vidhaama niyamit upasthiti (Regular presence in various forms of art and media)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Sangeet, chalchitra, sahitya ra lokpriya sanskritima barambar chitrit garine hunale yo sahar ra yahan raheka pramukh sthalharu vishwabhar chinin maddat mileko cha."" (Because music, film, literature, and popular culture are frequently depicted in this city, the city and its main places have gained worldwide recognition.) This directly links the city's fame to its prominence in arts and media.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Uccha star ko adhiweshan suwidha (High-level conference facilities):** While San Francisco has conference facilities, the passage highlights tourism and cultural influence as major factors in its global recognition, not just conferences.
* **C: Aarthik vividhata (Economic diversity):** Economic diversity is a characteristic of San Francisco's economy, but it's not the primary reason for its global fame as stated in the passage.
* **D: Udaudo asian khana ko paridrishya (Excellent Asian food scene):** The passage mentions a great Asian food scene, but it is presented as one of the many attractions contributing to tourism, not the *main* driver of San Francisco's global recognition.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye san francisco bare kun vakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **D: Arthatantra purai paryatan maa nirbhar chha** (That it is entirely dependent on tourism).

Here's why:

* **The passage states that San Francisco's economy is diverse.** While tourism is a major attraction, it's not the *only* driver. The passage explicitly mentions other major sectors like professional services, government, finance, and trade.
* **Options A, B, and C are all directly supported by the text.** The passage mentions San Francisco's popularity in film and literature, the prevalence of Asian cuisine, and the abundance of hotels and convention centers.

Therefore, option D is the incorrect statement because the passage indicates San Francisco's economy isn't solely reliant on tourism.



"
Anuchhed anusar travel agent ko sewa kasto kisim ko yatru laai faidajanak hunechha?,"The correct answer is **D: Package deal maa booking garna man paraune yatru** (Travelers who want to book a package deal).

Here's why:

The paragraph highlights that travel agents typically offer packages that include flights, hotels, and sometimes airport transfers and breakfast. It also mentions their ability to handle booking reservations and arrange for necessary documents like visas, especially for those who don't have time to do it themselves.  This caters perfectly to people who prefer the convenience of a pre-arranged package deal.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Nirnaya garna nasakekaa yatru (Travelers who can't decide):** While a travel agent can offer suggestions, the core benefit mentioned isn't solely for those who can't make a decision.
*   **B: Aakasmikta man paraune yatru (Impulsive travelers):**  The paragraph emphasizes pre-planning and booking, not catering to impulsive decisions.
*   **C: Bhisa surakshit nabhaeko yatru (Travelers who don't have a visa):** While travel agents *can* assist with visa arrangements, it's not the primary benefit emphasized in the text.  The paragraph focuses on the overall convenience of package deals.



"
Yea madhye kun kura travel agent ko faida kaa rup maa anuchhed maa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Druta rup maa tayar garieka yatra kaa kagajat haru (Quickly prepared travel documents)**.

Here's why:

* The passage discusses the benefits of using a travel agent for booking accommodations and travel arrangements. It mentions things like package deals (including flights and hotels), booking reservations, and handling necessary paperwork. 
* However, the passage **does not mention** that travel agents quickly prepare travel documents. While they might *assist* with paperwork, the preparation of documents isn't specifically highlighted as a key advantage. The other options (hotel deals, all-inclusive packages, and making reservations) are all directly mentioned as benefits of using a travel agent.

Therefore, option A is the one that is *not* mentioned as a benefit in the passage.
"
Anuchhed anusar wastawik samayamaa paath anuwaad garne app ke garna sakdainan?,"The correct answer is **D: Harek palta 100 pratishat sahi anuwad (100 percent accurate translation every time)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while translation engines have improved, they can still misunderstand things.
* It explicitly mentions that even with the advancements, the translations are not always perfect and can be incorrect.
* Option D claims 100% accuracy, which the passage directly contradicts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Videshi bhasamaa sanket ko anuwad (Translation of signals into foreign languages):** The passage says apps can translate real-world objects and signs into foreign languages.
* **B: Path ko sabai khanda ko anuwad (Translation of all parts of the text):** The passage mentions apps can translate entire texts and display them on a smartphone.
* **C: Smartphone dwara path lai wastu maa anuwad (Translation of text into objects via smartphone):** The passage explicitly states that apps can display translations on a smartphone pointed at an object.



"
Offline maa anuaad garna ke le anumati dinchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhasa ko data ko download**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""jasle iccha gareko bhashako deta download garepachhi offline anuwad gurney anumati dinchha."" (which allows for offline translation after downloading the data of the desired language.)

While the other options are related to translation, they aren't the primary key to enabling *offline* translation:

*   **A: Sudharieko anuwad engine:** A better translation engine improves accuracy, but it's not what *enables* offline translation.
*   **B: Smartphones:** Smartphones are the devices used, but they don't provide the functionality for offline translation.
*   **D: Wastawik samay ko anuwad shreni ka applications:** Real-time translation apps are related, but they don't inherently enable offline translation. The ability to download language data is what makes offline translation possible.



"
Yea madhye kun himpahiro ko trigger hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: Gham ko kiran (Sun's rays)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""kahilekanhi mull trigger gurney ghatana surya taple hiunlai tataunu ho..."" which translates to ""Sometimes the main trigger event is the sun heating the ice.""  Therefore, the sun's rays *are* a trigger.

The passage also mentions ""kahilekaahin adhik himpat..."" meaning ""sometimes higher impact..."" which implies that strong impacts can also trigger avalanches.  And ""kahilekaahin aru prakritik ghatanaharu, prayaha manawaharu hun"" meaning ""sometimes other natural events, often human activities.""

""Tasine hiun"" (snowfall) is mentioned as a contributing factor, but not a direct trigger in itself. ""Manis"" (humans) and ""Thap himpat"" (earthquake) are both listed as potential triggers.

Therefore, ""Gham ko kiran"" (sun's rays) is the only option explicitly stated as a trigger in the passage.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye himpahiro ko rupmaa ke jharchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Trigger nagarieko tasine hiun (Untriggered ice melt)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Samasya yo ho key hiun taansine khalko hunchha, tyasaile yasalai tall jharna kehi trigger garna awashyak pardachha..."" which translates to ""The problem is that the ice melts when stressed, so it needs some trigger to become a tall waterfall...""  This directly points to the issue being the *lack of a trigger* for the ice to melt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hiun nabhaeko thado bhiralo (Unmelted steep slope):** The passage says the problem arises when the ice *melts*, not remains unmelted.
*   **C: Thado bhiralo maa dherai hiun ko matra (A steep slope with a lot of ice):** While the passage mentions a lot of ice on a steep slope, it doesn't focus on this as the *problem*. The problem is the melting itself.
*   **D: Manis le nachalaeko hiun (Ice melted by humans):** The passage mentions natural triggers like sunlight, high impact, and other natural events, not human activity.



"
Anuchhed anusar tarkari kun samagri maa adharit hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Jadibuti ra masala** (Spices and herbs).

The passage states: ""Masu wa sagasabjiharu pani hune jadibuti ra masalama adharit khana tarkari ho."" which translates to ""Masu is a vegetable curry based on spices and herbs.""
"
Kehi kshetra harumaa nariwal ko dudh kehi tarkari maa ke ko satta maa prayog garinchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sabji (Vegetable)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""nariwalko dudhko prayog samanyataya dakshini bharat ra upa kehi any tatawarti kshetraharuma garinchha.""  This translates to: ""Coconut milk is commonly used in southern India and some other coastal regions.""  It also mentions that yogurt (dahi) is commonly used in the region between North India and Pakistan.

The question asks about the use of coconut milk in vegetables.  Therefore, ""sabji"" (vegetable) is the correct answer.
"
Pathar pugna kina Transantarctic himal ko warapara ko ghumauro aawashyak chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sankuchit hiun khatarapurna huncha (Narrow ice is dangerous)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""yo kewal vishesh triactorharu, hiunma ghisarne gadiharudwara indhan ra apurtika sath yatra garna sakinchha. Yiniharu dherai chharito chhainan tyasaile goreto batobata chattanko agla himalharuko waripari chuchuro pugna lamo samay lagdacha.""  This translates to: ""Only special tractors, vehicles that can travel on ice, fuel, and supplies can travel this way. There aren't many of them, so it takes a long time to reach the other side of the Himalayas from Goreto.""

The text implies the route is difficult and requires specialized equipment. While the other options might be *related* to the challenges, they aren't the *reason* for the detour. The most direct and logical reason presented is that the ice is narrow and therefore dangerous.  The difficulty in getting special tractors to the area and the long travel time are consequences of the narrow ice, not the cause.

Therefore, option B best reflects the implicit reasoning in the provided text.
"
Dakshini dhrubha tira ke maa jhanda ko chinha lagaieko hunchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Mcmurdo station ko bato (From McMurdo Station)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""South poll traverse (wa rajmarg) rose sagarma mcmurdo stationbata polasamma..."" This translates to ""South pole traverse (wa rajmarg) rose sagarma from McMurdo Station to the pole...""

Therefore, the South Pole traverse starts *from* McMurdo Station.  The question asks where the flag is placed. The text doesn't explicitly say the flag is placed *at* McMurdo, but it indicates the traverse originates from there, making McMurdo Station the starting point related to the flag's placement during the traverse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Indhan tanne tractor (Fuel-towing tractor):** Tractors are *used* for the traverse, but they aren't the location of the flag.
*   **C: Hiunle bhariekaa darar (Ice-filled crevasse):**  Crevasses are part of the environment, but not the specific location related to the traverse or flag.
*   **D: Himalko warapara kaa khatarapurna ghumauro (Dangerous, winding path beyond the Himalayas):** The traverse doesn't go beyond the Himalayas; it goes to the South Pole.

"
Dakshini africa ko bhraman garda paryatak le dhyan dinu parne kun kura anuchhed maa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Dakshini africa kaa praya sabai chimeki desh haru sthir chhan (Almost all the neighboring countries of Southern Africa are stable.)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""key dakshin africa sthira bhaepani sabai chhimeki deshharu sthira chhainan."" (Even though Southern Africa is relatively stable, not all neighboring countries are stable.)
* Option C directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: vibhinna muluk ko bhisa sambandhi farak aawashyakata chhan (There are differences in visa requirements among different countries)** - The passage mentions that different countries have different visa requirements and laws for emergency supplies.
* **B: Mul marga bhanda bahira kaa bato maa ghumna gadi ko prayog thik hunchha (Using a car to travel off the main roads is okay)** - The passage recommends using a 4x4 vehicle, especially for traveling on less accessible roads.
* **D: Gadi maa ghumda 4x4 ko sifaris garinchha (Recommends using a 4x4 vehicle in the car)** - The passage explicitly recommends using a 4x4 vehicle.



Therefore, only option C is *not* mentioned in the passage."
Anuchhed anusar gadi maa dakshini africa ghumne paryatak kaa lagi kun sallaha kharab ho?,"The correct answer is **B: 4x4 ko sifaris garie pani praya sthan haru samanya gadi bata puginchha.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yo sawadhanipurwak yojanasanga samanya karma garna sakinchha tar 4x4lai atyadhik salah diinchha ra dherai sthanharu uccha wheel bases 4x4 hunda matri pahunchayogya hunchhan.""  This translates to: ""This can be done with careful planning, but 4x4 is highly recommended, and many places are only accessible with high wheelbases 4x4.""  This means while you *can* use a regular car, a 4x4 is often *necessary* to reach certain areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kanun anusar gadi maa kehi aakasmik wastuharu upalabdha rahanu parchha:** The passage mentions emergency supplies but doesn't say it's a specific advice for tourists driving in South Africa.
* **C: Samanya marga haru bata vichalit huna khojne kaa lagi gadi upayukta ho:** The passage actually advises against straying from regular routes due to the varied conditions across different countries.
* **D: Dakshini africa kaa sabai chimeki muluk haru ghumna kaa lagi aadarsha chainan:** The passage states the opposite - that each country has unique laws and emergency supplies, making it not ideal to travel through all of them.



"
Yea madhye kun kura aafno jhola tetikai chodda hune jokhim kaa rupmaa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Tapai lai arko manis samjhana sakinchha (You might be misunderstood by others)**.

Here's why:

* The passage focuses on the risks of being mistaken for a drug smuggler, facing severe legal consequences, and attracting unwanted attention from authorities.
* **Option B** is directly mentioned in the passage: ""Kehi deshharuma pahilo patak aparadhka lagi pani atyantai kathora sajayaharu chan; yasama 1100 warshabhanda badhi jail wa mrityuko sajaya hoon sakha."" (In some countries, even for a first offense, punishments are extremely severe; this includes jail terms exceeding 1100 years or even death penalty.)
* **Option D** is also implied: ""Bewarise chhadieka jholaharu chorko nishanama parna sakchhan ra yasta jholale bamko chunautibata sawadhan rahane adhikariharuko dhyan pani khichna sakdachhan."" (Unnecessary packages can fall into suspicious areas, and such packages can also attract the attention of authorities who are cautious of threats.)
* **Option A** is a possible consequence of being mistaken for a smuggler.

**Option C** (""Tapai lai arko manis samjhana sakinchha"") is not mentioned as a direct risk in the passage. While being mistaken for a drug smuggler *could* lead to others misunderstanding you, it's not the specific danger highlighted in the text. The text concentrates on legal and security implications rather than social misinterpretations.



"
Lagu ausadh ko dhuwani bare anuchhed maa ke kura ullekh bhaeko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Yadi tapaile lagu ausadh nabokeko bhae pani adhikariharule tapaiko jhola jafat garna sakchhan (Even if you haven't taken the drug, authorities can force a urine test.)**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that authorities can force urine tests *if* they suspect drug use (mentioning the example of Pratiksha Gurney).  However, it **doesn't** say that authorities can force a urine test *even if* you haven't taken the drug.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: Kehi muluk haru maa pahilo patak aparadh garne lai mrityu ko sajaya diinchha (Some countries have the death penalty for first-time offenders):** The passage mentions harsh penalties, including the death penalty, for drug-related offenses in some countries.
* **B: Antarashtriya bharaman garda thap sawadhani apnaunu parchha (You need to be careful when traveling internationally):**  The passage warns about the risks of drug use when traveling internationally and the severe penalties in some countries.
* **C: Lagu aausadh sunghne kukur haruko bina suchana prayog huna sakchha (Urine tests can be performed without warning):** The passage mentions the possibility of surprise urine tests.



Therefore, option D is the only one that is *not* mentioned in the passage.



"
Sthagan maa basta kun prakar ko peya padarha gharmaa banaunu hudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Juice**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Yadi tapain adhik sahasi mahasus gardai hunuhunchha bhane, yo awasarlai **juice banauna** wa kehi smudiharu blend garna prayog garnuhos."" This translates to ""If you feel more adventurous, you can try **making juice** or blending some smoothies.""  It implies that making juice *is* an option.

However, the question asks what you *cannot* make at home.  The text implies that coffee and chia are suitable for making at home, and there's no mention of restrictions on them. The text doesn't mention making beer at home. 

Therefore, **Juice** is the only option the text directly suggests you *can* make, while the question asks what you *cannot*. Since all the options are mentioned as drink ingredients, and no direct prohibition is given in the text, it's a bit tricky. However, given the context, and the fact it's the *only* option explicitly mentioned in a positive light (as something to *try* if you're adventurous), Juice is the most likely answer the question is looking for.

**Important Note:** This is based on interpretation and the limited text provided. A more complete text might offer a clearer answer.



"
Yadi tapaiko sahar piune sanskriti ko lagi lokpriya chha bhane tapaile sthagan maa raheko bela ke ko bhraman garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Juice waa smoothie kaa dokan (Juice and smoothie shops)**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that if you feel adventurous, you can try making juices or smoothies.  The question asks where you might go if drinking is popular in your culture.  Juice and smoothie shops are the most likely place to find beverages relevant to the text's recommendation.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Aafno chimek bahira rahekaa kafi kaa dokan (Coffee shops outside your home):** While coffee shops are common, they aren't directly related to the text's focus on alternative drinks.
* **C: Tapaile praya najane pub (A pub you don't know):**  While pubs are places for drinking, the text focuses on healthier alternatives like chamomile and chia drinks.  A pub doesn't align with the wellness theme.
* **D: Chamomile chia banaune restaurant (A restaurant that makes chamomile chia):** This is too specific.  While a restaurant *might* serve this, juice and smoothie shops are much more commonly found and offer a wider variety of drinks.



"
Dhukur ko murti kaha chhan?,"The correct answer is **B: Church ko chihan maa** (On the church's sign).

The text states: ""Girjagharko chheuchhauma raheka kehi chihanharuma marblebata baneka dhukurharuko rochak pratimaharu chan."" This translates to ""In the church's vicinity, there are interesting sculptures of monkeys made of marble in some of the signs.""
"
Kun kisim ko bhisama paryapta aarthik sahayog dekhanaunu aawashyak parna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **D: vidyarthi bhisa (student visa)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""vidyarthi bhisaka mapdanda ra avedan prakriya sadharan paryatak wa wyawasaya bhisabhanda farak hune garchhan"" (Student visa criteria and application process differ from general tourist or business visas). It further details requirements like proof of financial resources for at least the first year of study and a letter of acceptance from the educational institution. These are all specific to a student visa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wyaparik bhisa (business visa)**: The text contrasts student visas with business visas.
* **B: Paryatak bhisa (tourist visa)**: The text contrasts student visas with tourist visas.  Tourist visas are generally not for long-term stays.
* **C: Asthai bhisa (temporary visa)**: While a student visa *could* be temporary, the text focuses on the specific requirements of a *student* visa, not just a temporary one.



"
wistrit bhisa kaslai sabai bhadna badhi awashyak huncha?,"The correct answer is **C: Anataraashtriya vidyarthi (International student)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while short trips might not require a visa for tourists, international students typically need a visa for longer stays. The passage then goes on to detail the specific requirements for international student visas, such as proof of financial resources and a letter of acceptance from the educational institution. Options A, B, and D don't align with the information presented in the passage, which focuses on the specific visa requirements for students.
"
Machhad dekhi kahile saavadhaan hunu parchha?,"The question is ""Machhad dekhi kahile saavadhaan hunu parchha?"" which translates to ""When should you be careful of snakes?"".

The provided text discusses walking during the monsoon season and being mindful of potential risks.  The phrase ""dhoka kholeko kehi second bhitrai tapain gadibhitra pasda lamkhutte tapainsangai gadima janka lagi paryapta samay hunchha"" means ""within a few seconds of encountering a snake, you might be able to get into a vehicle.""

Therefore, the most relevant answer is **B: Paidal yaatra maa** (During walking/hiking).

While snakes *could* be present in other situations, the context of the provided text emphasizes the risk associated with walking (specifically during the monsoon). The text directly connects walking to the need for caution due to potential snake encounters.
"
Anuchhed anusar varshaban maa gaadi chalaauda machhad baat bachna ke garnu hudaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaadi ko dhoka laamo samay samma khula chodna (Leaving the car door open for a long time).**

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Tapainle lamkhutteko vichar garnu awashyak cha. Tapain subtropical warshawanko madhyambata yatra gardai hunu huncha bhane dhoka kholeko kehi second bhitrai tapain gadibhitra pasda lamkhutte tapainsangai gadima janka lagi paryapta samay huncha.""

Translation: ""You need to consider this. If you are traveling through subtropical monsoon regions, opening the door for a few seconds can be enough time for someone to sneak into the car and join you.""

This means leaving the car door open, even for a short time, is risky. Option A directly reflects this risk.  The other options are either not mentioned or are irrelevant to the core safety concern highlighted in the paragraph.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye sundarbans ko bare kun vakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yo sansar ko sabai bhanda thulo mangrove belt ho** (This is the world's largest mangrove belt).

Here's why:

*   The text states that the Sundarbans is a large mangrove belt, but it specifically mentions it's a 80 km (50 mile) stretch shared by India and Bangladesh. It *doesn't* say it's the largest in the world.
*   The other options are supported by the text:
    *   **A: Yas maa baaki raheka kehi thula jungle parchhan** (There are some large jungles remaining here): The text says the Sundarbans includes ""kehi antim baaki sthanharu samawesh chan"" (some remaining places).
    *   **B: Yasko aadha bhaag daldal le bharieko chha** (Half of it is filled with swamps): The text mentions that ""karib ek tihai bhag pani ra daldal kshetraharule dhakieko cha"" (almost one-third is covered by swamps and wetland areas). This is close to half.
    *   **D: Yaha paate bagh bhanda dherai chittal chhan** (There are more deer than tigers here): The text says ""400 vata shahi bengal bagh ra lagbhag 30,000 harinharu raheko anuman gariyeko chha"" (an estimated 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer reside here). This confirms there are significantly more deer than tigers.



"
Jungle ko kun bhaag bharatiya simaa bhitra parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans raashtriya nikunja (Sundarbans National Park)**.

The text states: ""Bharatiya khetra bhitrako jangalko bhaglai sunderban rashtriya park bhaninchha."" This translates to ""The portion of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.""
"
Anuchhed anusar ko sanga angrezi bhasa ko sabai bhanda kam gyaan huna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Toronto ghumne manis (People visiting Toronto)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in Toronto, you can imagine dining at restaurants with people speaking various languages like Italian, Bosnian, Jamaican, and Sydney Islander. They'll be talking about their homes and using local dialects and accents. This implies that people visiting Toronto might have less English proficiency compared to native speakers or those who live there permanently.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Aru dui bhasa bolne manis (People who speak two languages):** The passage highlights that written words are easier to understand than spoken words, even for those who speak multiple languages.
*   **B: Kam umerkaa manis (Younger Americans):** The passage says that young people are increasingly expected to have limited knowledge. This isn't directly linked to English proficiency.
*   **D: Badhi umerkaa manis (Older Americans):** The passage doesn't make any specific claims about the English proficiency of older Americans.

Therefore, the scenario in Toronto best illustrates a situation where someone might have the least English proficiency among the groups mentioned."
Anuchhed anusar ke uccharan garna kathin hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Thegaana**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that written words are easier to understand than spoken words, *especially in difficult pronunciations*.  This directly points to ""thegaana"" (difficult pronunciations).
* The passage also mentions that in areas like the Gaonahar (likely a region with specific linguistic characteristics), pronunciations can be very deep and difficult to understand.
* While ""bhinna uccharan kaa sabda"" (words with different pronunciations) is related, ""thegaana"" is the more direct and accurate term describing *difficult pronunciation* itself.
* ""Lekhieka sabda"" (written words) are *easier* to understand, not difficult.
* ""Sthaaniya argot"" (local argot) describes specific slang, not the difficulty of pronunciation.

Anuchhed anusar antar jilla station baata bus line yaatru laai kun avastha aadarsha hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Yaatru uttar tarfa jaadaichha ra station maa 6:20 samma aaisaknu parnechha.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yadyapi pry: jaso uniharu purvatira zaker / bumthang jaane kramama 06:30 ra 07:30 ca beach chhuttinchhan."" This translates to ""although buses for Purwa/Zaker/Bumthang depart at 06:30 and 07:30.""

It also says: ""Antara-zilla prasthan gurney basharu pry: bhari hune bhaekale kehi dinaghi nai tikat katna salah diinchha."" This means ""It's advised to book tickets in advance if the inter-district buses are crowded.""

Further, ""Paro (nu 150) ra punkha (nu 200) jasta najikaka sthanharuma yatra garna drut ra aramdayak sadhanharuma sajhedari taxi hun."" This indicates shared taxis are available for shorter distances.

Therefore, the passage implies that passengers traveling **north** (Uttar tarfa) need to be at the station **by 6:20** to catch the 6:30 bus to Bumthang/Purwa.  The recommendation to book tickets in advance strengthens this conclusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While it's good to book in advance, the passage doesn't explicitly state passengers *must* have booked tickets.
* **B:**  The passage mentions Bumthang as a destination, but doesn't specify a 7:00 arrival time. It only mentions 6:30 and 7:30 departures.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention Paro or a 11:00 departure.
"
Antar jilla station baata purva tarfa yaatra garne paryatak kaa laagi kun sujhaav thik hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Agrim ticket kinne (Buy tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Antara-zilla prasthan gurney basharu pry: bhari hune bhaekale kehi dinaghi nai tikat katna salah diinchha."" This translates to ""For inter-district departures, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance because buses are often full.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bus haru 8:30 pachhi maatra chutchhan (Buses only depart after 8:30)** - The passage says buses depart at 6:30 and 7:30 for the east, contradicting this.
* **C: Din bhar dherai gaadi hinchhan (Many buses run throughout the day)** - While the passage doesn't explicitly say many buses run *throughout* the day, it implies buses are full and advisable to book in advance, suggesting a decent number of departures. However, the main advice is about booking early.
* **D: Saajha garieka taaxi yaatra garne sabai bhanda upayukta maadhyam hun (Shared taxis are the most useful mode of transport)** - While shared taxis are mentioned as an option for nearby locations, the passage doesn't suggest they're the *best* or *most useful* option for inter-district travel. It focuses on buses and the need to book ahead.



Therefore, **B** aligns directly with the key advice given in the passage."
Yea madhye kun kura le timbuktu lai sahi rupma janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Yaha plane maa pugna sakidaina (You cannot reach it by plane)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""yosanga ek airport chha"" which translates to ""It has an airport.""  Option C contradicts this directly.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: Yas maa muluk ko baaki thaau bhanda arabic prabhaav badhi chha (Arabic influence is higher than in the rest of the country):** The text says, ""Sheher deshka any shaharharubhanda bilkulai viparit ho kinbhane yasama africibhanda arbi maulikta badhi chha."" which translates to ""The city is completely different from other cities in the country because Arabic authenticity is higher than African.""
* **B: Yo garibi le pidit chha (It is afflicted by poverty):** The text mentions, ""Aja, timbuktu ek garib banaieko sahar ho"" which translates to ""Today, Timbuktu is a poor city.""
* **D: Yo jigyaasi paryatak haruko laagi aakarshan ko kendra ho (It is a center of attraction for curious tourists):** The text says, ""yasalai paryatak akarshan banaunchha"" which translates to ""it attracts tourists.""

Therefore, only option C is factually incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Ti madhye timbuktu ko baare kun tathya sahi ho?,"Correct answer is **A: Yo sahar plane maa pugna sakinchha**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...yosanga ek airport chha."" which translates to ""...it has an airport."" This directly confirms that Timbuktu is accessible by plane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yo garib bhanda badhi aakarshak chha (It is more attractive than poor):** The text says, ""Aja, timbuktu ek garib banaieko sahar ho..."" which means ""Today, Timbuktu is a poor city..."" So, it's *not* more attractive than poor.
* **C: Yaha chimeki sahar haru bhanda kam african shaili chha (It has less African style than other cities in the region):** The text states, ""Sheher deshka any shaharharubhanda bilkulai viparit ho kinbhane yasama africibhanda arbi maulikta badhi chha."" which means ""The city is completely opposite to other cities in the country because Arab authenticity is higher here than African."" So, it has *more* Arab influence, not less African style.
* **D: Yo sahar le paryatak laai aakarshit gardaina (This city does not attract tourists):** The text says, ""...yosanga ek airport chha."" and the context of Henry Louis Gates' show suggests it *does* attract tourists.

Grisma olympic suru maa kaha aayojana garne yojana thiyo? ,"The correct answer is **A: August 2021**.

The text states: ""Paralympic 24 augustdekhi 5 september 2021 samma samma hunechha."" which translates to ""The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021.""
"
Anuchhed anusar kun bindu maa funnel chakrawat banchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Jamin chhoye pachhi (After touching the ground)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tiniharu bhuima chhunda 'tornado' hunchchan."" This translates to ""...they descend to the ground and become 'tornadoes'.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jaba bataas 100 mile prati ghanta maa pugchha (When the wind reaches 100 miles per hour):** The passage mentions wind speeds of 100-200 mph as where they form, but this isn't *where* the funnel cloud *becomes* a tornado.
*   **B: Jaba hawa kaa stambha ghumna thalchhan (When air columns begin to spin):**  This describes the formation of a funnel cloud, but not the point at which it becomes a tornado.
*   **C: Aandhi bataas baata tala jharda (Descending from storm winds):** This is part of the formation process, but doesn't define when a funnel cloud becomes a tornado.



"
Yea madhye kun chakrawat ko sahi viseshata ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Yasle jahile 100-200 mile prati ghanta ko raftaar maa baatas ko sirjana garchha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tiniharule uccha batas (prayaha 100-200 mile/ghanta) sirjana garchhan..."" which translates to ""They create winds at high altitudes (approximately 100-200 miles/hour)...""
* **Option A directly reflects this statement.**

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **B: Yo praya bhari wastu sanga chalchha (It moves with heavy objects):** The passage says tornadoes *can* lift heavy objects, but it doesn't say they *always* move with them.  The key characteristic is the wind speed.
* **C: Yo jamin choye pachhi funnel banchha (It becomes a funnel after touching the ground):** While a funnel forms *when* a tornado touches the ground, the passage describes the initial formation as a rotating column of air *before* it touches down.
* **D: Yo hawa bahira thelne ghumne stambha ho (It is a rotating column of air moving outwards):**  While technically correct, this is a broader description. Option A is more specific to the passage's emphasized characteristic - the high wind speed.

Anuchhed anusar yaatru le aafno gantavya sahar ko raajnitik awastha baare kaha baata sujhaav linu parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Bhraman sallahakar maa prasthut bhaekaa vichar (The views presented in the travel guide)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tapain tapainko yatrama swasthya bima wa yatra radd bimama asar parna sakcha. **Ek udaharanka rupma, madhya purvama raheka americi nagarikharule european wa arabiharubhanda farak paristhitiko samana garna sakdachhan.**"" (You can be affected by health insurance and travel cancellation insurance on your trip. **For example, American citizens living in the Middle East can compensate for the difference compared to Europeans and Arabs.**) This indicates that the travel guide (or travel advisors) provides insights into the political situation of the destination.

While the passage mentions government advice and advice from citizens, it frames the travel guide's viewpoints as a direct source of information for travelers to understand the political situation.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
Bharaman sallaha ko awasthama videshi paryatak le ke anubhav garne sambavana hudaina?,"The correct answer is **B: Muluk ko raajnitik awastha baare ati saralkrit saramsa (Very simplified summary of the country's political situation)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Chetawani ghoshanaharu kunai deshko rajnaitik awasthako kewal sankshipta saransh hun. Prastut garieka drishtikonharu anyatra upalabdha wistrit jankariko tulanama pry: adhuro, samanya ra dherai nai sarlikrit chan."" This translates to: ""Warning notices are only a brief summary of a country's political situation. The presented viewpoints are very simplified in comparison to more extensive information available elsewhere.""

The question asks what a tourist *won't* experience based on travel advice.  The text indicates the advice provides a simplified overview, so a tourist won't experience the full complexity or detail of a country's political situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Raddha bima maa prabhav (Impact on travel insurance):** The text states that travel advice *can* affect travel insurance.
* **C: Swasthya bima maa prabhav (Impact on health insurance):**  The text states that travel advice *can* affect health insurance.
* **D: Muluk ko rajnitik awastha bare wristrit jankari (Extensive information about the country's political situation):** The text *explicitly* says the advice is *not* extensive.

Anuchhed anusar kun kisim ko yatra maa booking ko lagi travel agent ko sahayata kaam parchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ek nischit budget maa dui hapte lamo bhraman (A two-week long trip with a specific budget)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dherai agentharu khas prakarka yatra, budget dayara wa gantawyaharuma visheshagyata rakhchhan."" (many agents specialize in special types of trips, budget trips, and destinations). Option B directly aligns with ""budget dayara"" (budget trips).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Pahile bhraman garisakeko saharma Karya samelan sammako yatra (Trips to familiar locations for work conferences):** While travel agents *can* handle these, the passage focuses on the benefit for a first-time traveler seeking a unique experience.
* **C: Bhasa ko kathinai hune bhraman (Trips with difficult languages):** The passage doesn't specifically mention language difficulties as a reason to use a travel agent.
* **D: Yatri ko pahilo videsh yatra (A traveler's first trip abroad):** While a travel agent *is* helpful for first-time international travelers, the passage highlights the value for those seeking a deeper cultural and sensory experience, often associated with longer trips and budget considerations.



"
Anuchhed anusar kun awastha maa yatru le travel agent bata sabai bhanda badhi faida lina sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaba yatru pahilo palta visesh bhraman ko booking gardai chhan (When the traveler books a special trip in the first place).**

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Tapainle jastai yatraharu barambar book gurney agent prayog garnu ramro hunasakchha. Agentle websitema hose wa pasalko sanjhyalma kasta tripharuko prachar gariraheko cha hernuhos."" This means it's good to use an agent for trips you book frequently.  The paragraph also mentions that some agents specialize in ""khas prakarka yatra"" (special types of trips), ""budget dayara"" (budget tours), and ""gantawyaharuma visheshagyata"" (specialization in destinations). 

Therefore, to maximize benefits, a traveler should book a *special trip* (visesh bhraman) initially, allowing them to identify an agent who specializes in that type of travel.  Frequent bookings are ideal, but starting with a special trip helps find the right agent to leverage that frequency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jaba yatru le aafno sahar ko bhraman garna duitarfe udan ko booking garekaa chhan (When the traveler has booked a round-trip flight for a local trip):** While this is a trip, it's not necessarily a ""special"" trip, and a local trip might not benefit as much from an agent's specialization.
* **C: Jaba yatru bhraman gantavya ko sthaniya bhasa maa pokhta chhan (When the traveler can speak the local language of the destination):**  Language skills are helpful, but not the primary factor in determining the value of using an agent.
* **D: Jaba yatru aafule bhraman garne sthan ko sanskritik bhinnata bare parichit chhan (When the traveler is familiar with the cultural differences of the place they are traveling to):** Cultural awareness is also helpful, but again, not the key driver for using an agent.



"
Anuchhed anusar yatru lai naya sthan bhraman garda hune nirasha bata jogina kun kura le madhat garna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aafu aayeko staan maa hune kanun ko palana garnu (Following the laws of the place you've arrived in).**

Here's why:

The paragraph emphasizes that travelers need to be mindful of local customs, laws, and behavior. It specifically mentions that things like ""dharma bhaeko"" (what's considered right/proper) and local etiquette will be different.  Following local laws and customs is crucial to avoid disappointment and negative experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aafu aayo sthaan jastai saman standard ko apekshya raakhnu (Maintaining the same standard as your home place):** The paragraph explicitly warns against this, saying that things will be different and travelers need to be prepared for that.
* **B: Aparichit khana chaakhne icchha (Desire to try unfamiliar food):** While trying new food can be a positive part of travel, the paragraph doesn't directly link it to avoiding disappointment.  It focuses on broader cultural awareness.
* **D: Aawaas bare agadi anusandhaan nagarnu (Not researching accommodation beforehand):**  Researching accommodation is practical, but the paragraph focuses on cultural and behavioral adjustments to avoid disappointment.



"
Anuchhed maa prastur jankari anusar kasto vyakti le videshi thau maa bhraman garda nirasha mahasus garna sakchan?,"The correct answer is **B: Pariwartan man paraune (Someone who is open to change)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that when traveling, one should not expect things to be exactly as they are at home (""kuraharu """"dharma bhaeko"""" jasto nahune asha garnuhos""). It emphasizes that customs, laws, food, etc., will be different.  The paragraph also mentions avoiding disappointment (""nirashabata bachnaka lagi"").  

Therefore, someone who is *open to change* (parivartan man paraune) would be better equipped to handle these differences and avoid disappointment.  The other options aren't directly supported by the text:

* **A: Jaslai farak swad ko khana man paraune (Someone who enjoys different flavors of food):** While enjoying new food is a benefit of travel, the paragraph focuses on broader cultural differences, not just food preferences.
* **C: Sanghuro manasikta bhaeko (Someone who is mentally rigid/narrow-minded):**  The paragraph implies that a rigid mindset would *increase* the likelihood of disappointment.
* **D: Sikai maa ramaune (Someone who enjoys learning):**  While learning is beneficial, the paragraph's emphasis is on adapting to differences, not specifically on enjoying the learning process.



"
Vikasashil desh maa pahilo patak bhraman garne yatru ko laagi yea madhye kun sujhav ko sifaris garidaena?,"The correct answer is **B: Pahilo kehi din maa khana maa dherai kharcha nagarnu (Don't spend too much on food in the first few days).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly advises travelers to consider spending more on Western-style and quality hotels, food, and services in their initial days. It suggests being prepared for unfamiliar local wildlife.  Option B, ""Don't spend too much on food in the first few days,"" is *not* mentioned or encouraged in the text. In fact, the passage implies the opposite – to be prepared for a certain standard of comfort and spend accordingly.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Jamin maa sutnu bhanda aghi sthaniya jivjantu ko bare jankari linu (Learn about local wildlife before sleeping on the ground):** The passage *does* advise being aware of local wildlife, especially if camping outside.
* **C: Baahira camping garda khat waa jhula ko prayog garnu (Use a tent and mosquito net while camping outdoors):** The passage *does* recommend carrying a tent and mosquito net when camping.
* **D: Suru maa aauda gunastariya hotel maa lagani garnu (Spend on quality hotels in the beginning):** The passage *does* suggest spending on quality hotels initially.



Therefore, B is the only option that the passage *doesn't* recommend.



"
Vikasashil desh maa parichit hudai garda yea madhye kun kura maa badhi kharcha garna ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Paschimi shailiko khana (Western style food)**.

The text explicitly suggests spending money on Western-style hotels, food, and services. It also advises against spending money on camping gear like a tent or sleeping bag.  While the text suggests potentially spending on quality food and lodging, it *doesn't* specifically mention needing to spend extra on Western-style food. The emphasis is on hotels and general quality.

Therefore, option A is the only one *not* mentioned as a potential area for increased expense.
"
Internet maa pahuch nabhaeko virtual pratilip chahane policy holder kaa lagi kun vikalpa utkrista hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Laptop ko memory maa ek pratilipi bhandar garnu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ek lattop wa tabletko sath yatrama aipugchha, yo memory wa diskma pratilipi garnuhos kripaya (internet bina nai pahunch yogya).""  This directly translates to: ""If you have a laptop or tablet with you on a trip, please make a copy in its memory or disk (accessible without internet).""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Yatra ko sathi lai ek pratilipi dinu (Giving a copy to travel companions):** While helpful, this isn't a *solution* for someone *without internet access* to retrieve a copy *themselves*.
* **B: Aafulai ek pratilip email garnu (Emailing a copy to oneself):** This requires internet access, which the question specifies is unavailable.
* **D: “cloud” maa ek pratilipi bhandar garnu (Storing a copy in ""cloud""):** This also requires internet access.



Therefore, storing a copy on a laptop or tablet's memory is the best option for someone needing a virtual copy without internet access.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun kura policy maa dekhauna pardaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Pramarikaran ko lagi antaaashtriya phone number (International phone number for identification)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states that you can view the policyholder's email and international phone number.  It also suggests saving a copy of the policy offline (on a laptop or tablet). However, it *doesn't* mention the international phone number being used for identification or verification (""pramarikaran"").  The focus is on being able to *see* the number, not its purpose in verification.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Davi garna antarashtriya phone number (International phone number for claims):**  The text mentions you can *see* the international phone number, implying it could be used for contact regarding claims.
* **B: Imaa karta ko email thegana (Viewing the policyholder's email):** The paragraph explicitly states this is possible.
* **D: Policy holder ko email thegana (Viewing the policyholder's email):** The paragraph explicitly states this is possible.



Therefore, the only thing *not* mentioned in the paragraph is the use of the international phone number for identification/verification.
"
Anuchhed anusar kun negative koo aakar le saamanyataya prayog hune film dhaachaa lai pratibimbit garchha?,"The correct answer is **C: 35 mm negative**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""35 mm film (36 gauna 24 mm negative) mapdanda sabaibhanda dherai samanya cha."" This translates to ""35 mm film (36 frames, 24 mm negative) is by far the most common.""

The question asks which negative size the paragraph describes as being commonly used.  Therefore, the answer must be 35mm negative.
"
Yea madhye kun film dancha le dSLR ko jastai resolution dinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm film**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""35 mm film (36 gauna 24 mm negative) mapdanda sabaibhanda dherai samanya cha. Yo sakiema yasalai samanyataya sajilaisanga punah bharna sakinchha ra halko DSLR ko tulanama jhandai ustai resolution dinchha.""  This directly translates to ""35 mm film (36 frames and 24 mm negative) is the most common.  It can be easily developed and compared to a light DSLR with almost the same resolution.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Madhyam dahchaa ko film** (Medium format film) is described as having *less* resolution than 35mm.
* **C: 56 x 56 mm film** and **D: 6 x 6 cm film** are both larger format films, and the passage indicates they have significantly *lower* resolution than 35mm.



"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye bhraman lekhan vyapar suru garne antim kadam kun ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Aafno website banaunu (Create your own website)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that to start a travel writing business, it's easiest to install a travel blog on a website. It further mentions the ease of creating your own website with user-friendly design and editing. Therefore, the logical final step mentioned is to create your own website.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Web dhancha ko abhyas (Practice with website templates):** This is a step *before* creating your own website.
*   **B: Kunai pratisthit bhraman blog maa thuprai lekh haru lekhnu (Simply post articles on an existing established travel blog):** This is a different approach, not necessarily the easiest or the focus of the paragraph.
*   **D: Aafno sampadan ko ship tikharnu (Install your editing software):** This is a technical detail, but not the overarching final step described in the paragraph.



"
Bhraman lekhan vyapar suru garda yea madhye kun kshamata surumaa parishkrit garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Website ko nirman (Website creation)**.

Here's why:

* The initial statement talks about starting a business (yatra lekhanko wyawasaya) and suggests a simple way to establish a blog on a website.
* It mentions the ease of creating a website with user-friendly features for customization.
* Therefore, the core ability required to start this business, according to the context, is website creation.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly correct:

* **A: Blogging:** Blogging is *part of* a website, but the question is about the overall business setup.
* **B: Web dhanchaa banaune (Web template creation):** While useful, it's not the fundamental skill needed to start a business. You can use pre-made templates.
* **C: Sampadan (Editing/Editing):** Editing is a feature of a website, not the primary ability needed to *start* the business.

Therefore, the most encompassing and accurate answer is **Website ko nirman (Website creation)**.
"
Kasto mausaam maa samanyataya aandra ko samasya dekhaa parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Tato mausam (Hot weather)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tato mausam andraka samasyaharu samanya hunchha..."" which translates to ""In hot weather, indoor problems are common...""
"
Anuchhed anusar lagatar ko prasharan ke ko pratirodhaatmak kshamata badhchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sthaniya kitaanu (Local bacteria)**.

The passage states: ""Gharma, sthaniya ki nirantar prasharanko karanle, tapainko pratirodhak shaktile pahilenai tiniharulai jiteka hunchhan."" This translates to: ""Sweat, due to continuous local discharge, your immune system is able to defeat them first.""  ""Tiniharulai"" refers to ""tiniharu"" which means ""them"" and in the context of the passage, ""tiniharu"" refers to ""sthaniya kitaanu"" (local bacteria).

Therefore, the passage indicates that continuous local discharge (like sweat) strengthens the body's resistance against local bacteria.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aandra ko samasya (Diarrhea):**  While diarrhea is mentioned as a symptom of heat, the passage doesn't say it's directly related to increased resistance.
* **C: Swaspraswas ko samasya (Respiratory problems):**  Respiratory problems are mentioned as a heat-related issue, but not as a result of increased resistance.
* **D: Delhi Belly:** Delhi Belly is given as an example of a problem, not something that increases resistance.

"
Schengen kshetra bhitra bhraman garnu ko faaida ke ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Dherai bhisa aavedan bata joginu (Avoid applying for many visas)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that within the Schengen area, you generally don't need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country.  You only need one visa for the entire area. This saves time, money, and paperwork.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Paisa ko bachat (Saving money):** While saving money *is* a benefit, it's a *result* of not needing multiple visas, not the primary advantage itself.
* **C: Dherai rahadani niyantran janch kendra bata joginu (Applying to many border control centers):** The text says you generally *don't* need to apply to many border control centers.
* **D: Rahadani ko aawashyakta naparnu (Not needing visas at all):**  You *do* need a visa to enter the Schengen area initially, but only *one* visa for the entire area.
"
Tutankhamunko chihan ma ke bhetidaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhan sampatti (Wealth/Treasure)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yasalai kafinbata hataune prayasko kramama mammimathi bhaeko kshatiko praman dekhna kohi icchuk chan bhane sheer ra kaandhaharu matra dekhine bhaekale manisharu nirash hunen. **Chihanko adbhut sampattiharu ab yasama chhainan, tar yea kayaroko egyptian sangrahalayama lagieka chhan.**""

This translates to: ""Because people are only interested in seeing the remains of the mummy, only the head and shoulders are visible, people get disappointed. **The amazing wealth of the tomb is now in the Egyptian Museum.**""

Therefore, wealth/treasure is *not* found in Tutankhamun's tomb (KV62) anymore, but is in the museum.
"
Annuchhed anusar mulya bare sachet yatru kaa lagi vancouver ko kun gantavya kam aakarshak hunchha? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bowen tapu**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island is a popular day trip or week-long trip that offers kayaking, foot pilgrimages, and restaurants. It also mentions that it's a more affordable option compared to Whistler.  The passage describes Bowen Island as appealing to those looking for a more authentic community experience and access to the mountains and ocean.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Granville Island:** The passage doesn't mention Granville Island at all.
*   **B: Sea to Sky corridor:** The passage mentions the Sea to Sky Corridor in relation to Whistler, but the focus is on Whistler itself.
*   **D: Whistler:** The passage acknowledges Whistler's popularity and the 2010 Olympics, but it also highlights its higher cost compared to Bowen Island.  While Whistler offers skiing and mountain biking, the passage presents Bowen Island as a potentially more attractive option for budget-conscious travelers seeking a different kind of experience.

Therefore, based on the information given, Bowen Island is the most appealing destination for budget-conscious travelers."
Anuchhed anusar kun gantavya le yatru lai vancouver ko asali anubhav dinchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Bowen tapu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bowen tapu kayaking, paidal yatra, kinmail, restaurant ra thap kuraharu pradan gariraheko lokpriya dinko yatra wa saptahantako bhraman ho."" (Bowen Island is a popular day trip or week-long trip offering kayaking, hiking, climbing, restaurants, and cafes.)
* **While Whistler is mentioned as a destination for skiing and mountain biking, the passage focuses on Bowen Island as a key location for experiencing authentic community life.**
* **Downtown Vancouver and Granville Island are not mentioned in the passage as places offering the described activities.**

Therefore, Bowen Island is the place highlighted in the passage for a genuine and local experience.
"
Anuchhed anusar kunai roktok bina drishya ko awalokan garna yatrule kahile falls ko bhraman garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **A: November dekhi march bhari samma**.

The passage states: ""Warsha ritu (novemberdekhi march samma) maa, paniko matra dherai badhi hunechha ra jharana jhana badhi natakiya hunechha."" This translates to ""During the rainy season (from November to March), the water level increases significantly and the waterfall becomes very dramatic."" The passage also mentions that the waterfall is best seen during this time.
"
Anuchhed anusar november ra march ko bichaa victoria falls jharana ko faida ke ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Jharana ko natakiya drishya**.

The passage states: ""Warsha ritu (novemberdekhi march samma) maa, paniko matra dherai badhi hunechha ra jharana jhana badhi natakiya hunechha.""  This translates to ""During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume increases greatly and the falls become more dramatic.""

Therefore, the passage highlights the dramatic and spectacular display of the falls during November to March.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Jharana ko khulla drishya (Open view of the falls):** The passage actually implies the view is *obscured* by the increased water.
* **B: Kam paryatak (Fewer tourists):** The passage doesn't mention anything about fewer tourists.
* **D: Varsha season bata joginu (Avoiding the rainy season):** The passage describes the rainy season as a *benefit*.
"
Anuchhed anusar video khichna ko lagi drone ko prayog garda ke sifaris garidaina?,"Correct answer is **D: Bhid bhaeko sthaan maa matra video khichnu jaha drone lai chal paudaina.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""Yo tapainko kshetrama awaidh nabhae tapainlai wimansthako najik wa bhidbhadma drone udaunu lagbhag sadhaikon kharab vichar ho."" This translates to ""Even if it's not illegal in your area, flying a drone near aircraft or in crowded places is almost always a bad idea.""
*   Option D reflects this advice.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kun kura ko video khichne anumati chha bhanera suruma janch garnu** - This is good advice, mentioned in the text, but doesn't specifically address *when* to avoid drone use.
*   **B: Thap license linu** - The passage mentions checking for necessary permits, but doesn't focus on *avoiding* drone use in certain situations.
*   **C: Anumati ko bare anusandhan garnu** - Similar to A, this is good advice but doesn't address avoiding drone use in specific places.

Therefore, D is the most direct answer to the question of when drone use should be avoided according to the passage."
Anuchhed anusar drone dwara video khichna sabai bhanda upayukta sthan kaha chhan?,"Correct answer is **D: Agrim anumati lieyeko kshetra maa**

Here's why:

* The paragraph explicitly states: ""Yadi drone prayog garirahnu bhaeko cha bhane, tapainlai key khichna anumati diieko cha ra ke anumati wa thap ijajatpatra awashyak cha bhanera ramrari jaanch garnuhos."" (If you are using a drone, you have permission to film and you should carefully check what permission or authorization is required.)
* It further says: ""Yo tapainko kshetrama awaidh nabhae tapainlai, wimansthako najik wa bhidbhadma drone udaunu lagbhag sadhaikon kharab vichar ho."" (If it is illegal in your area, flying a drone near aircraft or in crowded places is almost always a bad idea.)
* Therefore, the most suitable place to use a drone for video recording is where you have obtained the necessary permission (""Agrim anumati lieyeko kshetra maa"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bhid najik taki drone ko upasthiti le kunai farak naparos** (Drone's presence doesn't matter near crowds): The paragraph says flying near crowds is generally a bad idea.
* **B: Niyamit photograhy ko anumati nabhaeka kshetra** (Areas where regular photography permission is not obtained): While photography permission is important, the paragraph specifically addresses *video* recording with drones and the need for drone-specific permission.
* **C: Drone tyati nadekhine vyasta thauma** (Busy places where the drone is not visible): Flying a drone in busy places is generally discouraged, regardless of visibility.



"
Anuchhed anusar bhisa prakriya ko aawashyakta bare yea madhye kun wakya sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **A: Yadi tapai paryatak aawasmaa basnu bhaeko chha bhane tapaile darta garnu pardaina (If you are staying as a tourist, you do not have to register.)**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that tourists staying in hotels often have the registration process handled by the hotel.  Therefore, option A contradicts the information provided.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: Sabai desh maa sthaniya adhikari haru sanga darta garna aawashyak hunchha (In all countries, it is necessary to register with local authorities.)** The passage mentions that in many countries, you must register with local authorities.
* **C: Aadhyagaman karyalay ko bhraman garna aawashyak huna sakchha (Visiting the immigration office may be necessary.)**  The passage states that registration may require visiting the immigration office.
* **D: Kehi sthan harumaa sthaniya hotel harule darta ko kaam herchhan (In some places, local hotels handle the registration process.)** This is directly stated in the passage.



"
Yea madhye paryatak darta ko lagi kun sthan jadainan?,"The correct answer is **A: Sthaniya prahari karyalaya (Local police station)**.

The text states: ""Yasaka lagi sthaniya praharika sath faram bharna wa adhyagaman karyalayama jaan awashyak parna sakcha."" which translates to ""For this, it may be necessary to go to the local police station to fill out a form and undergo a review.""

While other locations are mentioned in the context of the visa process, the local police station is explicitly stated as a necessary place for the ""darta prakriya"" (visa process/registration).
"
Bhraman ko bela swayamsewak ko kam garera kaslai faida hudaina?,"The correct answer is **C: Naya ship sikna chahanele (Wanting to learn new skills)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that volunteering abroad is a good way to learn new skills (""afnai barema zanne, drishtikonko bhawana bujhne ra naya sipharu prapta gurney ramro tarika videsh baser swayan sewa garnu ho"").  The other options are benefits *of* volunteering, not reasons why one *wouldn't* benefit.

*   **A: Videsh maa naya sathi banauna chahanele (Wanting to make new friends abroad):** While making friends is a potential benefit, it's not a reason *not* to volunteer.
*   **B: Paryapta talab kamaune aash garnele (Hoping to earn enough money):** The text mentions that some organizations provide room and board in exchange for work, but it doesn't imply that earning money is the primary benefit.
*   **D: Kotha ra khana maa ruchi rakhnele (Having an interest in food and lodging):** Again, having an interest in these things isn't a drawback of volunteering.

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
Anuchhed anusar budget maa videsh bhraman garne yatru ko lagi swayamsewa kasari faidajanak chha?,"The correct answer is **B: Yasle kam ko awasar sirjana garchha** (It creates job opportunities).

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""...dherai swayamsevak rojgariharule kotha ra board pradan gardachan ra kehile thorai talab pani bhuktan gardachan."" This translates to ""...many volunteers provide rooms and food and sometimes even pay for some needs."" This clearly indicates that volunteering creates job opportunities (rooms, food, and sometimes payment) for volunteers in foreign countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Talab lagbhag sadhai pradan garinchha** (Demand is almost always provided): The paragraph doesn't say demand is always met. It implies that there are opportunities, but not necessarily constant availability.
* **C: Kahile kahi kotha ra khana pradan garinchha** (Sometimes provides rooms and food): While true, this is a limited aspect of the benefits mentioned.  Job creation is a broader benefit.
* **D: Yasle tapailai naya drishtikon pradan garna sakchha** (It can provide you with a new perspective):  While the paragraph *mentions* gaining new perspectives, it's not the primary benefit discussed in relation to budget travel.  It's more about the practical support volunteers receive.



"
Anuchhed anusar walt disney world ko saamanya bhraman ko laagi ke asamanya maaninchha?,"Correct Answer: **C: Bhraman ko sabai samay disney ko kshetra maa bitaaunu**

**Explanation:**

The paragraph states: ""wishishta bhramanma arlando antarrashtriya airportmathi udan bharnu, ek un-site disney hotelma basnu, disney sampatti nachhodi ek hapta jati bitaunu ra ghar farkinu samawesh chan. Yo any vibhinna tarikale garna sambhawa cha tar dheraijaso manisharu """"disney worldma ghumna jaane"""" bhanda yahi bhanna khojeka hunchhan.""

This translates to: ""A special trip includes flying from Orlando International Airport, staying in an on-site Disney hotel, enjoying Disney properties, and spending a week there and returning home. This can be done in other ways, but many people look for this rather than just ""going to Disney World"".""

The paragraph implies that the *special* trip involves *spending all of their time within the Disney area*. Options A, B, and D are aspects of the special trip, but not the defining characteristic that makes it ""special"" according to the paragraph.  Spending all time within Disney property is what distinguishes this type of trip.
"
Yea madhye kun vaakya walt disney world kaa bare sahi hoina?,"The correct answer is **C: vimansthal dekhi sthal samma yaatru osaarna bus ko suvidha raheko chha.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the provided ""wishishta"" (special) trip includes flying into Orlando International Airport, staying at a Disney hotel, and spending a week at Disney properties. While transportation *is* provided as part of that package, the text *doesn't* say that transportation from the airport to the location is by bus. It simply implies a transfer is included. 
* The text *does* mention on-site Disney hotels (B) are part of the special trip.
* The text *does* mention that park-hopper tickets are available on Craigslist (D).
* The text *does* state that Walt Disney World is a popular destination for American families.
* **Crucially, the text *does* state that Disney prohibits ticket transfer (which would include transportation).**

Therefore, option C is the statement that is *not* explicitly supported by the text.  It assumes a bus is used for transportation, whereas the text only mentions that a transfer is included.



"
Ancuhhed anusar yea madhye kun vishaya vyavasaayik prashikshan wa prakashan maa bhetidaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Banjar bhumi maa kasari baachne (How to survive in wilderness)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions:

* **Vyavsayik prashikshan (Vocational training):**  Includes practical experience and covers various subjects.
* **Pathyakram (Curriculum):** 2-5 days long, includes roles, first aid, and weapons training.
* **Prakashan (Publications):** Books and magazines about jungle and nature conservation are common, but publications related to war zones are rare.

While survival skills *could* be relevant to a war zone, the passage doesn't mention it specifically.  The provided options detail subjects that *are* mentioned: first aid, roles, and being prepared for a war zone. Therefore, ""How to survive in the wilderness"" is the least likely topic to be included in vocational training or publications based on the text.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun vishaya vyavasaayik prasikshan ko kaksha maa utaaine sambhawana huncha?,"The correct answer is **A: Prathamik upachhar (First aid)** and **D: Shatrutapurna watawaran (Hostile environment)**.

Here's why:

* **Prathamik upachhar (First aid):** The passage explicitly states that a typical course includes ""thuprai prathamik upchar"" (first aid).
* **Shatrutapurna watawaran (Hostile environment):** The passage mentions a ""shatrutapurna watawaran pathyakram"" (hostile environment training program), indicating it's a subject covered.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **Yuddha kshetra (War zone):** While war zones are mentioned, the passage doesn't directly state that war zone training is a specific course topic. It implies a more general hostile environment training.
* **Banjar bhumi maa kasari baachne (How to survive in the wilderness):** The passage mentions books and magazines about jungle and nature conservation, but doesn't specifically mention survival skills in the wilderness as a training course topic.



Therefore, options A and D are the most accurate based on the provided text. I've listed them separately as they are distinct topics covered. However, if I *must* choose only one, **D: Shatrutapurna watawaran** is slightly broader and encompasses the first aid aspect as well.



"
Anuchhed anusar sambhaavit rupmaa dushit pani bata jogina ramro vikalpa ke ho?,"The correct answer is **D: Nischit jokhim ko laagi pani ko janch garnu (Definitely check the water for risks)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph emphasizes the variability of purification methods and potential risks.** It highlights that different methods require different boiling times and that filters vary in effectiveness.
* **The paragraph specifically mentions buying bottled water from reputable companies as a safer alternative.**
* **Option D directly addresses the core concern raised in the paragraph: ensuring the water is safe to drink by testing it for potential contaminants.**  While boiling is mentioned, the paragraph isn't advocating for a single method; it emphasizes assessing the risks and choosing the appropriate solution.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Thuprai minute samma pani umalnu (Boil for a certain number of minutes):** The paragraph states that the required boiling time varies.
* **B: Bottle ko pani kinnu (Buy bottled water):** While mentioned as a solution, it's presented as a safer alternative *because* of the risks involved, not as the *best* general approach.  The paragraph doesn't suggest this is always the best option.
* **C: Ek minute samma pani umalnu (Boil for one minute):**  This is explicitly stated in the paragraph as insufficient for some situations.



Therefore, option D, which emphasizes risk assessment and testing, best aligns with the paragraph's overall message.



"
Anuchhed anusar dakshya paudibaaj ko lagi pani kun kura jhandai asambhav hunchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Gahiro panimaa paudanu (Playing in deep water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tapain begbata bahira niskanebittikai paudi khelnu samanyabhanda dherai gahro hundaina."" which translates to ""You shouldn't play in water that is more than what you can easily get out of."" This directly implies that playing in deep water is considered unsafe and potentially impossible for a skilled paudi (swimmer) because it increases the risk of drowning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Samudri chattan ko najikai paudanu (Playing near sea cliffs):** While dangerous, the passage doesn't specifically state that playing near sea cliffs is impossible for a skilled swimmer. It mentions the dangers of unexpected currents and deep underwater areas.
*   **C: Bahav ko virudhamaa paudanu (Playing against the current):** Skilled swimmers can often navigate against currents. The passage doesn't indicate it's impossible for them.
*   **D: Chal ko waripari paudanu (Playing in choppy water):** Choppy water is challenging but not necessarily impossible for a skilled swimmer. The passage focuses more on the dangers of unpredictable and deep currents.



"
Yadi bahaav maa adkiyemaa ke garnu parchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Viparit dishaama paudanu parchha (Swim in the opposite direction)**.

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes that in a flood situation, you should avoid trying to swim directly against the current, as it's usually impossible and tiring. Instead, you should try to swim *perpendicular* (opposite) to the flow of the water to get to safety along the bank.

Option C accurately reflects this advice. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Arko dishaa tarfa nishaana banaaera bahaav baata baahira niskane prayas garnu parchha ra tyaspachhi kinaar maa saamanya rupmaa paudanu parchha (Try to swim in another direction, aiming to get out of the current and then generally swim to the bank):** While aiming for the bank is the goal, the text stresses swimming *across* the current first.
*   **B: Bahaav viruddha chito paudanu parchha (Swim quickly against the current):** This is explicitly discouraged in the text.
*   **D: Sataha muni paudanu parchha (Swim under the surface):** This is generally not recommended in flood situations as there could be debris and it's difficult to navigate.



"
Anuchhed anusar vidaa ko bhraman ko bela kun sthaan ko mahal ghumna upayukta huna sakchha?,"Correct answer is **C: Rhine upatyaka maa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Udaharanka lagi loire upatyaka, rhine u bhaeka mahalharu yatra gurney wa danyubko chakhlagda siteharuka lagi kruj line wa eri naharma dunga khiyaune.""  This translates to: ""For example, for tourism, along the Rhine, there are castles that can be visited, and cruise lines or ferries can be used for the sights along the Danube.""  It specifically mentions castles *along the Rhine*.

Therefore, option C, ""Rhine upatyaka maa"" (In the Rhine valley), is the most accurate answer.
"
Anuchhed anusar yea madhye kun kura bhraman garne mahila lai sifaris garidaina?,"Correct Answer: **B: Saanskritik bhinnata ko kaaran le sthaniya baata jabarjasti vyavahaar nimtane tarfa dhyaan dina**

Here's why:

The paragraph emphasizes that women in this region (North Sahel, West Atlantic) disregard traditional societal norms regarding marital status. The advice is to be assertive, not to appear weak, and to maintain one's position.  It specifically mentions that this is a response to cultural differences which can lead to oppression.

Option B, ""Saanskritik bhinnata ko kaaran le sthaniya baata jabarjasti vyavahaar nimtane tarfa dhyaan dina"" (Focusing on forcibly adapting behavior from the local customs due to cultural differences), is *contradicted* by the paragraph's overall message. The paragraph *encourages* women to be strong and maintain their identity *despite* cultural differences. It warns against conforming to local customs simply to avoid conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Vaivaahik awastha baare kura nagarna** (Not talking about marital status): The paragraph explicitly states that women in this region don't care about marital status, so it's *not* advising against discussing it.
*   **C: Chamkilo gahana nalagaauna** (Not wearing flashy jewelry): The paragraph mentions that women in this region wear jewelry and other accessories, so this is not advice against it.
*   **D: Aawashyak pareko belaa maa kathortaa ko prayog garna** (Using force when necessary): The paragraph suggests women should be assertive and maintain their position, implying using force when necessary to protect themselves.

Therefore, option B is the only one that goes against the paragraph's message."
Anuchhed maa varnan garieko kshetra anusar mahila yaatri kaa laagi kun sujhaav sahayogi hunchha?,"The correct answer is **D: Nachaahine vyavahaar ko sambandhamaa purush aswikaar garna dridh bannu ho**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph emphasizes that women travelers in the described region should be strong and not appear weak to men. It advises them to assert themselves and not be intimidated.
* Option D directly reflects this advice: ""Be firm in accepting non-appropriate behavior in matters of interaction."" This captures the essence of standing up for oneself and not being easily swayed.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kasaile pichha garnu asaamanya ho (It is unusual to back down):** While the paragraph implies not backing down, this option doesn't fully address the strength and assertiveness aspect.
* **B: Vaivaahik sthiti janaauna thulo aaunthi lagaaunu (It is better to wear a large ring to indicate marital status):** The paragraph mentions that wearing a ring can be helpful, but it's not the central advice. The focus is on overall strength and assertion, not just the ring.
* **C: Saanskritik bhinnata ko kaaran le aafno kura maa adig bhaera basi narahanu (Don't be overly timid due to cultural differences):** The paragraph does mention cultural differences, but the core advice is to be strong and assertive *despite* those differences, not to just avoid being timid.



"
Ancuhhed anusar kun awasthama wanyajantu ko photgrapher ko laagi visesh lens ko prayog aawashyak hunchha?,"Correct answer is **A: Sana jantu ko photo khichne bela**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wildlife photography praya: anumodanka rupma liinchha tara samanyataya photograph chitrale hazaar shabdaharuko layak hunchha. Wildlife photographyka lagi praya: lamo telephoto lensko awashyak pareta pani charaharuko bathan wa sanah prani jasta chijlai any prakarka lensharu chahinchha.""

This translates to: ""Wildlife photography is a hobby but generally a photograph is worth a thousand words. For wildlife photography, a long telephoto lens is necessary, but for animals like insects or small creatures, other types of lenses are needed.""

Therefore, to photograph insects or small creatures, a different type of lens than a long telephoto lens is required.



"
Anuchhed maa yea madhye wanyajantu ko photographer ko laagi kun kura sambhawit chunauti kaa rupmaa ullkeh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **A: Visesh janawaar haru ko khoji (Searching for specific animals)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions several challenges: luck, courage, experience, and the need for specific equipment (telephoto lens).
* It also covers dangerous animals, park regulations, shy/aggressive animals, and harsh environments.
* While finding specific animals *could* be a challenge, it's not directly mentioned as a significant obstacle in the passage. The passage focuses more on the general difficulties and risks involved in wildlife photography.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **B: Aakramak janawaar ko saamana garda (Facing aggressive animals):** The passage states ""Jungli janawarharu lajalu wa akramak hoon sakchhan."" (Wild animals can be shy or aggressive).
* **C: Aawashyak lens ko prakar baare shrot khojda (Finding out about the type of lens needed):** The passage says ""Wildlife photography praya: anumodanka rupma liinchha tara samanyataya photograph chitrale hazaar shabdaharuko layak hunchha. Wildlife photographyka lagi praya: lamo telephoto lensko awashyak pareta pani charaharuko bathan wa sanah prani jasta chijlai any prakarka lensharu chahinchhan."" (Wildlife photography is enjoyed, but usually a photograph is worth a thousand words. For wildlife photography: while a long telephoto lens is needed, for small animals like squirrels, other types of lenses are needed).
* **D: Pratikul watavaran maa kam garda (Working in adverse environments):** The passage states ""watawaran chiso, tato wa shatrutapurna huna sakcha."" (The environment can be cold, hot, or hostile).



Therefore, option A is the only challenge *not* mentioned in the passage."
Yea madhye kun kura le himali kshetra maa sawari chalaune ko laagi kam samasya nimtyauna sakchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Kam gharshan (Less friction)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Barfilo ra hiun bhaeka roadharuma, gharshan come hunchha ra tapain khali alkatrama chalaeko jasari gadi chalauna saknuhaunna."" (On snowy and icy roads, friction decreases, and you can only drive as if on an ice rink.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Traffic ko chaap (Traffic pressure):** The passage mentions traffic jams in general, but it's not specifically presented as a *lessening* factor for driving in snowy/icy conditions. It's more a general problem.
* **C: Uccha sakshepan (High speed):**  The passage implies that high speed is *more* dangerous on icy roads because of reduced friction and visibility.
* **D: Kam drishyata (Less visibility):** The passage highlights *reduced* visibility as a problem (especially during blizzards).

Therefore, the reduced friction (kam gharshan) is the key factor that makes driving more challenging in Himalayan regions with snow and ice.
"
Vibhinna desh harumaa aaya kar sambandhi kun kura saman rahanchha?,"The correct answer is **A: Dar (Tax)**.

The passage states that the main difference between countries lies in the *tax system* (ayakar sambandhi farak farak vyawastha). However, it also implies that the concept of *tax* itself is a universal element.  While the *structure* (Samrachana) of the tax system differs, the presence of a tax system is common. The other options (C and D) are not directly supported by the text.
"
Anuchhed anusar yadi tapai anta katai adharit bhaera videsh maa kam garirahanu bhaeko chha bhane tapaile kaha aafno aaya kar bujhaaune sambhawana hunchha?,"The correct answer is **C: Tapai le tatkal kam gariraheko deshmaa (In the country where you are currently working)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that ""tapainle afu baseko deshma ayakar halnu parne hunchha"" which translates to ""you have to pay taxes in the country where you are based.""
* It further explains that in federal countries like the USA and Canada, taxes are levied at both federal and local levels, potentially varying based on region.  However, the primary tax obligation is tied to the location of your work and residence.

Option C directly reflects this core principle outlined in the paragraph.
"
Vishwa mela lai yea madhe kun vakyale sahi rupmaa janaudaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Rashtra harule bhag lina aawashyak chhaina** (Countries don't have to participate).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Sahabhagi deshharule..."" (Participating countries...). This means participation *is* required. Therefore, option D is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Pradarshan harule deshko itihasa ra sanskriti dekhauna sakchhan** (Exhibitions can showcase the history and culture of the country) - This is directly stated in the passage: ""sahabhagi deshharule sansarka samasyaharu wa tiniharuka deshka sanskriti ra itihas dekhauna rashtriya stambhaharuma kalatmak ra shaikshik pradarshanharu prastut garchhan.""
* **B: Banaspatiya pradarshan kalatmak ra saikshik pradarshan sangai dekhaainchhan** (Botanical exhibitions are seen along with artistic and educational exhibitions) -  The passage says: ""Antarrashtriya bagwani pradarshan vishesh karyakramharu hun jasle fulharuko pradarshan, botanical bagaincha ra botabiruwasanga sambandhit kuraharuko pradarshan gardachan.""
* **C: Karyakram cha mahina samma huna sakchhan** (The program can last up to a month) - The passage states: ""Yea ghatanaharu samanyataya kahin pani tindekhi cha mahinaka bichma rahanchhan...""

Therefore, only option D is factually incorrect based on the passage.
"
Yea madhye vishwa mela wa antarashtriya pradarshan ko niyam kun ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Pradarshan le desh ko itihaas ra vishwakaa muddha haru dubai dekhaaunu parchha** (The exhibition showcases the history of the country and global issues).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sahabhagi deshharule sansarka samasyaharu wa tiniharuka deshka sanskriti ra itihas dekhauna rashtriya stambhaharuma kalatmak ra shaikshik pradarshanharu prastut garchhan."" This translates to: ""Participating countries present artistic and educational exhibitions in national pavilions to showcase global issues and their country's culture and history.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eutai deshle vaarshik rupmaa karyakram ko ayojana garna paudaina** (No country can organize the program annually): The passage says they *can* organize it annually, although it doesn't happen frequently.
* **C: Karyakram cha mahina samma huna sakchhan** (The program can last for a month): The passage states it typically lasts between 15 to 20 days.
* **D: Mela ko aayojana huna sabai desh sahabhaagi hunu parchha** (All countries must participate in organizing the fair): The passage doesn't say all countries are required to organize the fair; it's a collaborative effort.



"
Yea madhye ke garnale janawar ko akraman hune sambhawana kam rahanchha?,"The correct answer is **B: Camp sthal baata fohor nikaalnale (Removing food smells from the campsite)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Thap rupma, sawadhan rahanuhos key gandhale bhalu ra any wanyajantuharulai akarshit gardacha, tyasaile gandha yukta khana bokne wa pakaune karya nagarnuhos ra shivir safa rakhnuhos."" This translates to ""Be careful, as smells attract bears and other wild animals, so do not cook or eat smelly food and keep your camp clean.""

* **Option B directly addresses this:** Removing food smells is a key preventative measure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sugandhamaya jadibuti boknaale (Smelling fragrant herbs):** This is the opposite of what the text advises.  Fragrant smells *can* attract animals.
* **C: Bwaso bata 25 yard ko duri rakhnale (Keeping 25 yards away from the toilet):** While important for hygiene, the text specifies a 25 *yard* distance from *animals*, not toilets.  Also, the main concern is the smell, not just the distance from a specific structure.
* **D: Janawar lai khana ko tukra haru diera (Giving food scraps to animals):** This is *strongly* discouraged and will *increase* the likelihood of an attack. The text warns against it.



Therefore, the best answer is **B**."
Yi madhye kun kura anuchhedmaa jungli wanyajantu ko aakraman ko sambhawit karan ko rup maa ullekh garieko chhaina?,"The correct answer is **D: Manis sanga aparichiht janawar (Unfamiliar animals)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions that people who don't maintain a proper distance from the animals are often attacked. This relates to the *behavior* of people.
* The passage mentions strong smells (like food) attracting animals, so **A: kadha sugandha (Strong smells)** is mentioned.
* The passage states that not maintaining a distance of at least 100 meters from bears and 25 meters from other animals increases the risk of attacks, so **B: Duri kayam garna nasaknu (Failing to maintain distance)** is mentioned.
* The passage warns against feeding or cooking food with strong smells and keeping campsites clean, implying that attracting animals with food is a cause of attacks, so **C: Jungle wanyajantu laai khana dinu (Feeding jungle animals)** is mentioned.
* However, the passage doesn't directly state that *unfamiliarity* with animals is a cause of attacks. While unfamiliarity *might* contribute to people not maintaining a safe distance, the passage doesn't explicitly link the two.



Therefore, **D** is the only option *not* mentioned as a potential cause of wild animal attacks according to the passage.
