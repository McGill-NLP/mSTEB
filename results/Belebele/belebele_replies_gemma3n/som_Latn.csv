"Marka loo eego qoraalka, maxaa aan loo qaadan doonin tilmaan sax ah oo si guul leh loogu ciyaaro turumbada?","The correct answer is **C: Ku taxadir inaad garaacdo nootyada adigoo ku ilaalinayo gacan dabacsan.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Xasuusnoow inaanay jirin wax baahiya oo aad u qabto inaad ku cadaadiso furayaasha si aad codka u dheerayso sida biyaanada."" (Remember you don't need to apply pressure to the keys to make them sound louder, like with piano.)

This means you shouldn't *forcefully* hit the keys. Option C is the only one that advises against that, suggesting a gentle touch (""gacan dabacsan"" - a soft hand). The other options contradict the passage's advice about minimizing effort and avoiding excessive pressure.
"
"Markaad ciyaareyso turumbada, midkee ayaa kuwan soo socda gacan ka geysan doona kordhinta mugga?","The correct answer is **A: Xawaare badan (Higher Volume)**.

Here's why:

The prompt explicitly states that to increase volume when using a harmonica, you use the reeds with *higher air flow (xawaare badan)* and increased pressure.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Xoog badan (More Force):** While force contributes, the prompt emphasizes airflow.
* **C: Cadaadis yar (Less Pressure):** This is the opposite of what's needed to increase volume.
* **D: Dhaqdhaqaaqa farta oo yaraada (Less Finger Movement):** This relates to playing technique, not directly to increasing volume.

Maxay tahay sababta muuqaaladda telefishinada loo jaraa xuduudahooda?,"The correct answer is **B: Markaa muuqaalku wuxuu buuxiyaa shaashadda oo dhan.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Telefishannada badankood waxa loo sameeyaa qaab dad dadka ka farxinaya Sababtaas darteed, wax walba oo aad ku aragto talefishinka waxa laga jaray dhinacyada, xagga sare, hoose iyo dacallada. Tani ayaa loo yeelaa si uu sawirka u buuxiyo shaashada oo dhan.""

This directly translates to: ""Most televisions are made in a format that pleases people. Therefore, everything you see on television is cropped from the sides, top, bottom, and corners. This is done to fill the picture on the screen.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Markaa muuqaalku wuxuu buuxiyaa shaashadda oo dhan** (This is the correct answer)
*   **C: Si loogu oggolaado beddelaada fudud ee qaabab kale** (This is not mentioned in the passage)
*   **D: Si loo jaro qoraal-hoosaadyo aad ugu dhow xagga hoose** (While cropping *can* affect subtitles, the primary reason mentioned is to fill the screen).



"
"Marka loo eego marinka, dhibaatooyinka soo socda midkee la kulmi kara marka filim loo beddelayo qaab DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Muuqaal aan buuxin shaashadda oo dhan** (Muuqaal aan buuxin shaashadda oo dhan).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that when converting a film to DVD, it's common for the image to be cropped (cut off) to fill the entire screen. This cropping can happen on the sides, top, bottom, and edges.  If subtitles are near the edges, they might be cut off as well.  Therefore, a common problem is the image not filling the entire screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qayb hoosaadyada jaran** (Bottom parts cropped): While cropping can occur at the bottom, the passage mentions cropping on multiple sides. This is not the primary, overarching problem described.
* **C: Muuqaal buuxinaya shaashadda oo dhan** (Image filling the entire screen): This is the *opposite* of the problem described in the passage.
* **D: Xuduudaha jara** (Edges cropped): This is *part* of the problem, but the general issue is that the image doesn't fully fill the screen, which encompasses more than just the edges.



"
Xaggee ku tiillay xerada ciidanka Ingiriiska?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The text states: ""Jeneraal John Cadwalder wuxuu soo saaray kala duwanan weerar lagu qaaday kooxaxa ciidamada British ee joogay magalada Bordentown..."" (General John Cadwalder launched various attacks on the British troops stationed in the town of Bordentown...)
"
Kee ayuu saxeexiisu ka muuqday qabyo qoraalka gacanta lagu qoray?,"The correct answer is **C: John Nixon**.

The passage states: ""Akhrintii ugu horeysa ee furanayd ee dukumeentiga waxa ku Hoolka daaradda xorriyada ku sameeyay John Nixon 8 dii Luulyo."" This means John Nixon was the first to publicly read the Declaration of Independence. The question asks where his signature appeared on the handwritten copy, and the passage directly links him to reading it.
"
"Marka laga reebo meelaha soo socda, xaggee buu ka yimid barxadka ballaaran ee Dunlap?","The correct answer is **B: Dukaanka daabacaadda ee Dunlap**.

The passage states: ""Inta lagu guda jiro habeenka inta u dhaxeysa 150 ilaa 200 koobi ayaa la sameeya oo loo yaqaano “bugaag Dunlap”.  Mid baa loo diray George Washington 6 dii Luulyo, wuxuna u akhriyay ciidamadiisa 9 kii Luulyo."" This directly indicates that the broadside came from Dunlap's printing house.
"
Xaggee ayay ku sugnaayeen Gaashaanle Sare Stark ciidamadiisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhammaadka dhinaca woqooyi, oo ku teedsan xeyndaabka**

The text states: ""Raga Stark waxay qateen dhamaan goobaha xudduuda ee dhamaadka qeybta waqooyiga ee goobaha gumeystayasha."" This means they secured the northernmost boundaries, which were located at the edge of the wilderness (xeyndaabka).
"
"Marka loo eego qoraalka, goorma ayay ragga Stark waasiciyeen xayndaabkooda?","The correct answer is **C: Muddadii lagu jiray mowjadda hoose**.

The passage states: ""Markii mawjad hoose dalool ka sameysay meel la siman Webiga Mystic ee ku yaal koonfurta bari ee gacan biyoodka, ayay si dhakhso leh ugu kordhiyeen dayrkii gidaar gaaban...""  This directly indicates they expanded their enclosure *during* the low tide.
"
"Marka loo eego qoraalka, kee ayaa kuwan soo socda ah mid ka mid ah waayihii ugu rabshadaha badnaa ee China ?","The correct answer is **D: Waagii Saddexda Boqortooyo**.

The text explicitly states that the era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the most turbulent periods in Chinese history, marked by intense warfare and a large number of deaths vying for power.  The other options are mentioned as periods *leading up to* or *in relation to* the Three Kingdoms period, but not as the most turbulent era itself.
"
"Marka loo eego marinka, maxaa ka run ah in kooxaha quraanyada ahi inay galeen marxalad reer guura ah?","The correct answer is **B: Waxay haystaan sahay cunto oo yar (They have little ready-made food).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kooxdu waxay biloowdaa heer reer guuraanimo marka cuntada diyaarka ah yaraato"" which translates to ""The group begins a seasonal camp when ready-made food is scarce.""  This directly indicates that the reason for entering the seasonal camp is a lack of ready-made food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Habeenkii bey buul galaan (They camp at night):** The passage states they travel at night and go to a camp during the day, but doesn't say they *camp* at night specifically.
* **C: Waxay sameeyaan buulal la beddelo 17 maalmood ka dib (They make exchangeable tents 17 days later):**  The passage says the tents are exchanged *every day*, not after 17 days.
* **D: Maalintii ayay socdaan (They travel during the day):** The passage explicitly says they travel at *night*.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, oraahdee ayaa si sax ah uga tarjumeysa hab-dhaqanka buul-ku-galka kooxaha quraanyada xilliga marxaladda reer-guuraaga?","The correct answer is **C: Waxay beddelaan buulasha maalin kasta**.

The passage states: ""Inta lagu jiro heerkan, kooxdu waxay sameysaa buulal ku meelgaara kuwaaso maalin kasta la beddelo."" (During this phase, the team makes temporary shelters which are changed every day.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxay dhistaan buulal habeenkii** (They build shelters at night) - The passage says they are *temporary shelters* and are changed daily, not just built at night.
* **B: Waxay socdaan 17 maalmood iyaga oo aan buul lahayn** (They last 17 days without shelters) - The passage indicates shelters are *made* during this period, not that they are without them.
* **D: Waxay isticmaalaan buulal isku mid ah inta lagu jiro marxaladda** (They use the same shelters during the phase) - The passage explicitly states the shelters are *temporary* and *changed every day*, meaning they are not the same.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa sii wadmi doona in kasta oo ay jiraan tilmaamo dibadeed?,"The correct answer is **C: Saacadaha noolaha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dhaqdhaqaaqyada soo noqnoqdo, ma ahan oo keli ah jawaab celin loo samaynaayo calaamado dibadda, ayaa laga arkay badi nolaha, ee ku jiraan baktiiriyada, fungi, dhirta, iyo xayawaanka kale. Saacadaha nolaha ayaa ay saacado keligooda iswadaan oo soconayaan keligooda xitaa haday waayaan baaqyo dibadda ka imaado.""  This directly confirms that endogenous circadian rhythms (internal biological clocks) continue even in the absence of external cues.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Wareegyada Endogenous (Endogenous cycles):** While related, the passage focuses specifically on *circadian* rhythms, which are roughly 24-hour cycles. ""Endogenous cycles"" is a broader term.
* **B: Laxanka xilliyeedka (Seasonal rhythms):** These are cycles tied to the seasons (e.g., migration, hibernation) and are definitely influenced by external cues like changes in day length. The passage emphasizes rhythms independent of external cues.
* **D: Laxanka loo fiirsaday (Observational rhythms):** These are cycles that are observed but may not be internally driven. The passage contrasts these with the internal, self-sustaining rhythms.



Therefore, **Saacadaha noolaha (Circadian rhythms)** is the best and most accurate answer based on the information provided."
Kelmadee ayaa qeexaysa shakhsiyaadka muujiya kala duwanaanshiyaha sifo gaar ah?,"The correct answer is **C: Noocyada**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the word that defines individuals showing a specific characteristic.** The text states that when all individuals in a society are the same *with respect to a specific characteristic*, they are called a ""heysashada"" or ""lahanshaha.""  This implies the characteristic is what differentiates the individuals.
* **""Noocyada"" (Types)** refers to the different varieties or kinds of individuals based on that specific characteristic.  Therefore, it accurately describes the individuals exhibiting that distinct trait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hal qaable (Homogeneous)** means the opposite - all the same, not showing a specific characteristic in a differentiating way.
* **B: Noolaha (Life)** is too general. It doesn't relate to the specific characteristic being discussed.
* **D: Qaabab dhawr ah (Multiple patterns)** describes the situation where a person has multiple cultures, not the individuals *showing* a single characteristic.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ereyga saxda ah ee noolaha ku nool meel gaar ah?,"The correct answer is **C: Noocyada** (Species).

Here's why:

* **Tirada guud** refers to a group of living organisms that are similar to each other and share common characteristics. This definition aligns with the biological concept of a **species**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Hal qaable** (Monotype): Refers to a population consisting of only one genotype.
* **Dadweynaha** (Population): Refers to all the individuals of a species living in a particular area.
* **Qaabab dhawr ah** (Multitype):  While the text mentions ""qaabab-badnayaal"" (multitypes) when individuals have multiple cultures, this isn't the primary term for a group of living organisms in a specific location.

Therefore, **noocyada** (species) is the most accurate answer based on the provided text and the definition of a ""tirada guud."""
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan noqon doonin tusaale dhaqdhaqaaqa dalxiiska ee ku salaysan dabeecadda?,"The correct answer is **C: Booqashada matxafka sayniska (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for an activity *not* related to nature-based tourism.** The passage defines nature-based tourism as activities focused on enjoying natural landscapes, flora, and fauna.
* **Booqashada matxafka sayniska** is an indoor, educational activity that focuses on scientific concepts. While it *could* touch upon natural history, its primary purpose isn't experiencing nature directly.
* **U socoshada biyo-dhac (Hiking waterfalls), Sawir qaadista ubaxyada duurka (Wildlife photography), and Dabin-daqsiyeed kalluumaysi (Spear fishing)** are all directly related to experiencing and engaging with natural environments.

Therefore, visiting a science museum is the only option that doesn't fit the description of nature-based tourism.
"
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa saldhig u ah nidaamka gaadiidka?","The correct answer is **B: Baabuurta gaarka ah**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Xadkan gaadiid ee debecsa ee qof kasta si ugu xiran yahay, una taageerayo, waa mid ku dhisan baabuur gaar loo leeyahay."" (This flexible transportation system that everyone relies on and supports is built on private cars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Goobaha shaqada:** While people commute *to* workplaces, the passage doesn't say workplaces are the foundation of the system.
* **C: Aag-nololeed xasiloon:** The passage mentions stability but doesn't connect it directly to the foundation of the transportation system.
* **D: Horumarka aadanaha:** The passage mentions human evolution but doesn't state it's the base of the transportation system.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that **private cars** are the basis of the described transportation system.
"
Qaybaha ku wareega xudunta waxay leedahay kharash noocee ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Lacag bixin la'aan** (No cost).

The passage describes electrons orbiting the nucleus.  Electrons are fundamental particles that are *already* part of the atom; they don't need to be *bought* or *paid for* to be in orbit. Therefore, there's no cost associated with them being in their orbits.
"
Xuddunta ayaa ka kooban qaybehee?,"The correct answer is **D: Borotoono, Nuyutroonada, iyo Elektoroono (Protons, Neutrons, and Electrons)**.

The passage states that an atom is composed of protons and neutrons in the nucleus, and electrons that orbit the nucleus. Therefore, the atom is made up of all three particles.
"
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa tusaale u ah nambarka binary shan yara?","The correct answer is **A: 1010**.

Here's why:

* **Binary numbers** use only 0s and 1s.
* **The question asks for a 5-bit binary number.** This means it needs to have exactly 5 digits (bits).

Let's examine the options:

* **A: 1010** - This has 4 digits (bits).
* **B: 12001** - This uses digits 1, 2, 0, and 0, *not* just 0s and 1s, so it's not binary.
* **C: 10010** - This has 5 digits (bits) and is a valid binary number.
* **D: 110101** - This has 6 digits (bits).

Since the question asks for a 5-bit number and option A has only 4 digits, while option C is a valid 5-bit binary number and option D is 6-bit, **option C is the best answer as it is a 5-bit binary number.**
"
Tirooyinka baynari maxaa sidoo kale loo yaqaan?,"The correct answer is **C: luqad gaar ah**

Here's why:

* **Binary numbers** are a specific *language* used by computers. They are the fundamental way computers represent and process information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qeybo (Parts):** While binary represents parts of information, it's not *called* parts.
* **B: Qiimaha (Values):** Binary *represents* values, but the term for the system itself isn't values.
* **D: Foomamka (Forms):** Binary is a *form* of representation, but it's not accurately described as ""forms.""



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan lagu sheegin marinka faa'iidada aasaasiga ah ee boloogyaynta ardayga?,"The correct answer is **B: Hoos u dhaca dhaleeceynta asxaabta**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that blogs initially involve basic writing, but peer feedback helps improve writing and reduces criticism. While reducing criticism *is* a positive outcome, it's presented as a *result* of the blog environment, not a fundamental benefit *of* blogging itself.

Let's look at why the other options *are* fundamental benefits mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Horumarinta naxwaha iyo awoodda qoraalka (Improving grammar and writing ability)** -  Explicitly stated as a benefit.
* **C: Wacyigelinta deegaanka ee la ballaariyay (Expanded environmental awareness)** - Directly mentioned.
* **D: Rabitaanka sii kordhaya ee waxbarashada (Increasing motivation for learning)** -  Clearly stated as a result of the engaging blog environment.



"
Midkee ka mid ah dhinacyada soo socda ee boloogyaynta ayaa lagu sheegay dhiirigelinta ardayda si ay u horumariyaan xirfadahooda qoraal?,"The correct answer is **C: Ilaalinta xiisaha dhagaystayaashooda.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Baahida loo qabo in lagu quudiyo xiisaha daadwadayaasha ayaa ardayda kudhirigilisa iney xariif noqdaan oo ey xiiseyaan (toto,2004).""  This directly connects the motivation to keep readers engaged with the desire to improve writing skills. Options A, B, and D are not supported by the passage as the primary driver for improved writing.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan faa'ido u lahayn isgaarsiinta isku midka ah ee ardayda? ,"The correct answer is **B: U gelida fool ka fool ah ee macalimiinta wakhti kasta ee maalinta ah.**

Here's why:

The passage highlights that online communication *enhances* time efficiency and allows for questions to be asked and answered *quickly*, even when the teacher isn't available in person. Option B, ""U gelida fool ka fool ah ee macalimiinta wakhti kasta ee maalinta ah,"" directly contradicts this. It implies a need for constant in-person interaction, which the passage suggests online communication reduces.

The other options are all benefits mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: U isticmaalka internetka khayraad ahaan:** The passage states that online resources make information accessible at any time.
*   **C: Dabacsanaanta saacadaha shaqada:** The passage explicitly mentions flexibility in scheduling.
*   **D: Xakamaynta xawlliga:** While not directly stated, online communication can facilitate tracking progress and managing assignments.



"
"Marka loo eego qoraalka, dhinacyada soo socda ee isgaarsiinta asynchronous midkee ayaan u dabacsanayn ardayda?","The correct answer is **B: Saacadaha shaqada (Work hours)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights the flexibility of asynchronous communication, specifically mentioning:

*   **""waqti xadidid yar iyo macquul galka shaqeyn saacado kala duwan""** (limited time constraints and flexible work hours). This emphasizes that asynchronous communication isn't bound by fixed schedules.
*   **""waqti walbo oo maalinka sidoo kale na sugan karo jawaabo si dhaqso ah""** (can get answers at any time of day, even when the teacher is not available).

Options A, C, and D are all facilitated by asynchronous communication:

*   **Xawlliga waxbarashada (Educational transfer):** Asynchronous communication allows for the transfer of information and ideas over time.
*   **Qalabka waxbarashada (Educational tools):** Websites and online tools are key to asynchronous learning.
*   **Isticmaalka internetka (Internet usage):** The internet is the primary medium for asynchronous communication.

Therefore, the only aspect that is *not* flexible with asynchronous communication, according to the passage, is the traditional concept of fixed work hours.



"
Maxaan qoraalka loogu xusin wax laga yaabo in lala xiriiriyo qalcadaha xilliga dhexe?,"The answer is **B: Baasheyaal**.

The passage explicitly mentions ""sawiro baasheyaal"" (images of battle banners) as part of the imagery associated with the castles of the Middle Ages. The passage also discusses the evocative power of these images, hinting at the stories and conflicts they represented.
"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa aan qoraalka loogu xusin sida ur ama dhawaaq laga yaabo in lagu dhex qariyo burburka qalcad?,"The correct answer is **D: Qoobab (Screams)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions ""qoobka fardaha iyo urta baqdinta ka soo baxeysa godadka waaweyn"" which translates to ""the screams and the sound of fear coming from the large pit."" This directly connects screams to the atmosphere of a besieged fortress.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Dagaallada (Battles):** While battles certainly happened during sieges, the passage focuses more on the auditory impact – specifically sounds *within* the fortress, not the battles themselves.
*   **B: Cabsi (Fear):** Fear is a general emotion, and while present, the passage highlights specific sounds associated with fear – screams, the sound of panic.
*   **C: Xafladaha (Celebrations):** Celebrations are the opposite of the atmosphere described in the passage.

Therefore, screams are the only option directly linked to the passage's description of sounds that could mask the sounds of a fortress falling.
"
Kuwan hoose midkeebaa ah sifaynta saxda ah ee Qalcadda Kirby Muxloe ?,"The correct answer is **B: Waxay u baahneed xoojinta ugu yar iyadoo ay ugu wacan tahay nabdoonaanta uu dalku ku jiro xilliga la dhisayo.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""1480yadii, markii dhismahiisa uu dhammaystiray Lord Hastings, waddanku xoogaa buu nabdoonaa waxana difaaca looga baahnaa oo qudha budhcad yar oo wareersan."" (In the 1480s, upon its completion by Lord Hastings, the country was somewhat peaceful and defense was needed only from a small, scattered band.)

This directly supports the idea that the castle didn't require significant fortifications because the country was relatively peaceful at the time of its construction. The other options are incorrect because:

* **A:** The passage doesn't mention the specific design of the walls being requested by Lord Hastings.
* **C:** The passage implies it wasn't a particularly lengthy construction period.
* **D:** The passage states the castle *didn't* need to withstand long, decisive attacks due to the peaceful period.



"
Midkeebaa sifooyinkan dhosmeed ee hoose loo tixgelin karaa inay caadi u tahay qalcadda Kirby Muxloe xilliga mudada lagu qeexay mariska?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhufays ka yar qalcadaha qaar** (Lower curtain walls).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""1480yadii, markii dhismahiisa uu dhammaystiray Lord Hastings, waddanku xoogaa buu nabdoonaa waxana difaaca looga baahnaa oo qudha budhcad yar oo wareersan."" (In the 1480s, when its construction was completed by Lord Hastings, the country was somewhat peaceful and there was only a small, well-trained garrison needed for defense.)
* **This implies:** The need for extensive fortifications was reduced.  Therefore, the curtain walls (the outer walls of a castle) wouldn't need to be as thick as those of earlier, more heavily defended castles.
* **Option A (Daaqado waaweyn - Large windows):**  Large windows are *not* typical of defensive castles. They would be a vulnerability.
* **Option B (Aasaaska loo dhisay inuu xajiyo weerarada - Foundation built to repel attacks):** While a strong foundation is always important, the passage indicates a reduced need for heavy defense, so an exceptionally robust foundation isn't a distinguishing feature of Kirby Muxloe at this time.
* **Option D (Darbiyo dhuuban - Thick curtain walls):**  As explained above, the passage implies thinner walls were sufficient.

Therefore, the relatively thin curtain walls (dhufays ka yar qalcadaha qaar) are the most plausible characteristic that aligns with the reduced need for heavy defense in the 1480s.



"
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, kuwa soo socda kee baa ugu faa'iidada badan orodyahanka isu diyaarinaya xilli ciyaareedka soo socda?","The correct answer is **D: Ka faa'iidaysiga jimicsiga si aad u hagaajiso jirka qaarkiisa sare.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Wadamada qaar marka la ordaya xiliga jilaalka waxa la isku keena jimicsiga jirka qeybta sare, waana habka ugu fiican loogu diyaar garoobo oradka xiliga.""  This translates to: ""Some countries, when walking in the winter, combine the exercise of the upper body, and it is the best way to prepare for walking in the season.""

Therefore, focusing on upper body exercise is the recommended preparation method mentioned in the passage.
"
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa muhiimad weyn u leh orodyahanka heerka koowaad ee nus-mayl-ka?","The correct answer is **D: Ku kobcinta xawaaraha saa’idka ah ee u adkeysiga.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Dab can, qeybta ugu horeysa orodka haafka maylka ah, nin ka ku jabin kara laba daqiiqo, waa inuu hantiyo xawaare macquul ah, laakin adkeysigu waa inuu la bartaa qasaaraha ka iman kara."" (Meaning: ""However, in the first part of the uphill walk, a person who can take two minutes should acquire a reasonable pace, but should also learn to tolerate the damage that can come from it."")
* The focus is on developing the ability to maintain a pace (xawaare) while also building endurance (adkeysi) to withstand the effort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku tababarashada ku orodka baadiye-dhex gudubka muddada bilaha jiilaalka** (Training to walk in the wilderness during the winter months) - While mentioned as a good preparation method, it's not the *primary* focus for a beginner on a half-mile walk.
* **B: Ku kobcinta u adkeysiga xawaaraha saa’idka ah** (Building endurance for hourly pace) - This is partially correct, but it doesn't emphasize the importance of *acquiring* a reasonable pace as much as option D.
* **C: Saacad gaarsiinta wax ka yar laba daqiiqo** (A clock showing less than two minutes) - This is irrelevant to the core message of the passage.

Therefore, option D best reflects the key takeaway about what a beginner should focus on when tackling a half-mile walk uphill.
"
"Ciyaartooy ciyaaraha fudud, kuwan soo socda kee baan lagu gaari karin hab-dhaqannada nafaqeynta oo keliya?","The correct answer is **C: Fulin hawleed sare (Enhanced peak performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while nutrition is crucial, it's not *enough* to produce top-tier athletes. It highlights the importance of balanced nutrition, healthy habits, and understanding of different lifestyles.  ""Enhanced peak performance"" implies exceeding basic fitness levels and achieving elite status, which requires more than just good nutrition. It likely involves training, genetics, mental fortitude, and other factors not directly addressed by the passage's focus on lifestyle and habits.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Fulin hawleed la hagaajiyay (Improved functional fitness):**  Improved functional fitness *can* be achieved through good nutrition and healthy habits.
*   **B: Raaxada oo korodhay (Increased recovery):**  Good nutrition and habits definitely contribute to better recovery.
*   **D: Caafimaad qabka guud (Overall health):** This is a direct result of the lifestyle factors mentioned in the passage.



"
"Iyada oo ku salaysan qoraalka, kee baa kuwan soo socda aan loo soo jeedin si ay dhallinyaradu ugu raaxeystaan ciyaartooda?","The correct answer is **D: Ilaalinta dheelitirka tamarta caafimaadka leh.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Joogtaynta dheelitir tamareed caafimaad leh, ku dhaqmista dhaqan cabbis wax ku ool ah, iyo fahamka dhaqamada kaabiseed ee kala duwan ayaa ciyaartoyda ka caawin kara inay kor u qaadaan waxqabadkooda kordhiyaana ku raaxeysiga ciyaartooda."" (Maintaining a healthy energy balance...will help athletes improve their performance and enjoy their sport.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku celcelinta nafaqada habboon:** While mentioned, it's part of the larger concept of ""dheelitir tamareed caafimaad leh.""
* **B: Si joogto ah ugu soo bandhiga heer sare:** This isn't directly mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Saameynta fuuq baxa:** This isn't mentioned at all.



"
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, maxaa looga yaabaa in orodyahanka masaafada dhexe uu u iibsado qalab ka qaalisan?","The correct answer is **D: Waxaa jira fikrado khaldan ku hareeraysan qalab aan qaali ahayn.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many cheaper tools don't have much impact or effectiveness. This suggests that long-distance runners might mistakenly believe they need expensive tools to improve, even if those tools aren't actually worthwhile.  Options A, B, and C directly contradict the passage's assertion that cheaper tools are often ineffective.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, orodka masaafada dhexe maxay u baahantahay?","The correct answer is **A: Qalab fara badan (Many tools)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""however, there is a lot of misunderstanding about several pieces of equipment needed to participate in it."" This directly indicates that many tools are required for distance running.
"
Yaa helay risonaanska bir-qabadka ee nukleerka? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch iyo Purcell**.

The passage states: ""MRI waxa sal u ah aragti fiisigiseed loo yaqaan nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), oo uu helay 1930yadii Felix Bloch (oo ka shaqaynaya Jaamacadda Standford) iyo Edward Purcell (oo ka socday Jaamacadda Harvard)."" 

Therefore, Bloch and Purcell are credited with discovering nuclear magnetic resonance.
"
Sanadkee ayaa la bixiyay rukhsadii hinidisada ee ugu horaysay ee sawirqaadista caafimaad ee aaladda resonance? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Afar sano ka dib waxaa la bixiyay batente ama xuquuqda soo saarka, oo ahaa bateentaha aduunka ugu horeeyey ee lagu bixiyay MRI. Sanadka 1977, Dr. Damadian wuxuu gabagabeyey dhismaha kowad “jirkoo-dhan” Baaraha MRI, kaas oo uu ugu magic daray “Lamajabiyaan”.""

This indicates the patent/exclusive rights (which is a form of license) were granted in 1974, and the first whole-body MRI was completed in 1977.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay dadku u leeyihiin awood fahan wacan marka loo eego fasirida ficil jireedka dadka kale?","The correct answer is **D: Garasho (Empathy)**.

The passage explicitly states that the ability to understand the meanings of others' actions is important for resolving the apparent illogicality of actions. This is a core component of **empathy**, which is the ability to understand and share the feelings of another. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rabitaan (Desire/Wanting):** While desires can motivate actions, the passage focuses on understanding the *reason* behind the actions, not just the desire.
* **B: Niyaysi (Intention):**  Intention is related to the reason for an action, but empathy goes further by understanding the emotional context and potential underlying motivations.
* **C: Aaminaad (Trust):** Trust is related to believing someone, but not necessarily understanding *why* they acted a certain way.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, fahanka ulajeedada dadka maxay bay ka caawisaa inay sameeyaan?","The correct answer is **A: Meesha in laga saaro waxa ka dambeeya hubanti la'aanta ficilada jiraka.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Waxa ay inaga caawineyga inaan xalino macquul galka jahwareerka ficilo."" This translates to ""It helps us to resolve the irrationality of actions.""  The example given is someone breaking a car window – we don't automatically assume they're breaking it to steal the car. Understanding the *intention* (the meaning behind the action) helps us to arrive at a more logical explanation for the behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Saadaalinta rabitaanada** (Predicting desires): While understanding intentions *can* inform desires, the text focuses more on understanding the *meaning* of actions, not just desires.
*   **C: Ufiirso dadka kale adoon xukmin** (Observe other people without judgment):  The text actually argues that *judging* is necessary to understand intentions - we need to make a logical judgment to explain actions.
*   **D: Akhri maskaxda dadka kale** (Read other people's minds): The text explicitly says that understanding intentions is important, but doesn't mean we are reading minds. It's about making logical deductions from observable behavior.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwaan soo socda keebaa soo koobid saxa u ah ujeedada ugu wayn ee garaadka macmalka AI?","The correct answer is **D: Howlaha otomatik u dhamayn (Automating tasks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AI is making significant contributions to computer science, particularly in areas related to ""hab dhaqanka, wax barashada iyo la qabsiga maskaxda mashiinka"" (behavior, learning, and machine intelligence). It further explains that AI enables machines to automatically handle tasks requiring intelligent working methods. The examples given (control, planning, scheduling, responding to perception and queries, recognizing handwriting, voice, and face) all fall under the umbrella of automating tasks.

While options A, B, and C are *examples* of what AI can do, they aren't the *overall purpose*. The overarching goal is to automate tasks.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwaan soo socda keebaa inta badan garaadka macmalka AI la xiriira?","The correct answer is **C: Cilmiga mala,awaalka**.

The passage explicitly states: ""AI Cilmi baaridda ka socoto AI ayaa mashiinada u awoodo inay hab otomaatig ah u qabsadaan hawlaha u baahan hab shaqayn caqli leh. Tusaaleyaal waxaa ka mid ah xakamaynta, qorsheynta iyo jadwal gelinta, awooda u jawaab celinta ogaanshaha iyo su’aalaha macaamilka, iyo isla markaas aqoonsiga qoraalka gacant, codka iyo wajiga.""

This list of examples is all under the umbrella of ""Cilmiga mala,awaalka"" (Artificial Intelligence). While the other options (Khidmada macmiilka, Qorshayn iyo jadwalayn, Aqoonsiga gacanqoraalka) are *examples* of what AI can do, the broader field they belong to is Artificial Intelligence itself.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwaan soo socda keebaa ah awooda uu leeyahay qof leh hab fikiro isku dhow?","The correct answer is **D: Xafidida qaababka (Storing patterns)**.

Here's why:

The text states that people with this type of thinking have the ability to ""xafidaan naqshadooyinka"" which translates to ""store patterns"" or ""memorize structures."" This is directly linked to their ability to solve problems logically and work on scientific questions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U helida dhowr jawaabood mushkilada (Finding multiple answers to the problem):** The text explicitly says, ""Fikirkan noocan ah waxa lala xiriiraya habraacyo ama cilmiyo gaar ah. Dadka leh fikirka noocan ah ayaa leh fikirka sababaynta macquulka, ayaa awood u leh inay xafidaan naqshadooyinka, **sidoo kale na ka shaqeeyaan su’aalaha sayniska.**"" This implies a single, correct answer.
* **B: Ku dabaqida farsamooyin cusub mushkilada (Applying new techniques to the problem):** While logical thinking can *lead* to applying new techniques, the core ability highlighted in the text is pattern recognition, not necessarily applying new techniques.
* **C: Ku qaadasho waqtigooda si ay u xaliyaan mushkilaadka (Taking their time to solve problems):** The text doesn't mention anything about taking time; it focuses on the *type* of thinking, not the pace.



Therefore, the best answer is **D**."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kee kamida kuwaan soo socda oo aan loo tix galinayn inuu diirada saarayo habfikirka isku dhow?","The correct answer is **B: Wakhti ku qaadashada (Spending time)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes a quick, efficient, and logical thought process.  It highlights speed, rationality, accuracy, and a focus on finding *the one right answer*.  

* **A: Fahanka inay jirto hal jawaab oo sax ah (Understanding there is one right answer)** - This is a core element of the described thought process.
* **C: Aqoonsashada xaqiiqooyinka (Recognizing facts)** -  Crucial for building a logical foundation.
* **D: Uruurinta xogta (Gathering data)** -  Important for a thorough understanding, but fits within the logical framework of the described approach.

* **B: Wakhti ku qaadashada (Spending time)** - The passage *explicitly* contrasts this with the speed and efficiency of the described thought process.  Spending time isn't necessarily a feature of this particular type of thinking. It could even be seen as hindering it.



Therefore, spending time is the option that doesn't align with the described emphasis on a fast, logically driven thought process.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwaan soo socda kee baan loo tix gelinayn ishaaro-kooban?","The correct answer is **A: Jeedsashada marka la hadlayo (Lip smacking while speaking)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how video analysis advancements, particularly in facial movements, allow us to detect deception by recognizing subtle expressions. It mentions:

*   **Facial expressions:** The core of the advancements discussed.
*   **Oliver Sacks' research:** Highlighted the ability to understand meaning even when words are lost, suggesting deeper non-verbal communication.
*   **Animal communication:** Suggesting that similar abilities might exist in animals.

The passage focuses on subtle facial cues and gestures used in communication and deception detection.  **Lip smacking while speaking** isn't directly mentioned as a key indicator in the context of the advancements discussed or Oliver Sacks' findings. The other options (sunniyo kicin, si dag daga isha u bililg siinaya, and suul kor u qaadida) are more commonly associated with facial expressions and gestures used to convey emotions, and thus fall within the scope of the passage.

Therefore, lip smacking while speaking is the least relevant option based on the provided text.
"
Keebaa weedhahaan soo socda fasiraya muujinta-kooban ee aan runta ahayn?,"The best answer is **D: Waxay kaa caawin kartaa qiimaynta daacadnimada (It can help you assess deception)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that video recording advancements allow us to ""recognize when a person is lying by accurately translating hidden emotions.""  This directly links the technology to the ability to assess deception.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Duubista muuqaalada waxay horseedeen horumar la taaban karo (Video recording has led to tangible advancements):** While true, this is a very general statement and doesn't capture the specific focus on lie detection.
* **B: Fasiraada saxan waxa laga yaabaa inay soo qabato beenta (Plate interpretation may be able to catch lies):** This is not mentioned in the text. The passage refers to translating facial movements, not plate interpretation.
* **C: Hadalka iyo sidoo kale tibaaxaha wajiga ayaa la fasiraa (Speech and facial expressions are interpreted):** This is true, but doesn't fully convey the purpose. The *interpretation* is specifically geared toward *assessing deception*.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and complete answer."
Midkee kamida kuwaan soo socda ayaa noqday mid aad muhiim u ah natiijada ka dhalatay casriga horumarka? ,"The correct answer is **C: U yeerid xog qoraaleed (Emphasis on written information)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Culays dib looma saarin xasuusashad qofka, balse xasuusashada qoraalka ayaa noqotay mid diiradda la saaray."" This means that in the modern era, the ability to process and retain information in written form has become significantly more important.  This shift is central to the changes in how knowledge is acquired and the resulting modernization of learning.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly supported:

* **A: U yeerid xog shaqsiyeed (Personal Data Recognition):** While related to information processing, the passage doesn't highlight personal data recognition as the *core* shift in how knowledge is acquired.
* **B: Faafinta aqoonta (Dissemination of Knowledge):**  The passage mentions the modernization of learning and knowledge sharing, but the key is *how* knowledge is absorbed, not just its spread.
* **D: Helitaanka xog (Access to Information):** Access to information is a prerequisite for the shift described, but the passage focuses on the change in how we *process and retain* that information – specifically through written forms.



Therefore, the emphasis on written information is the most directly and prominently discussed consequence of the advancements described in the passage.



"
"Natiijada ka dhalatay casriga horumarka, kuwaan soo socda midkee ayaa culays yar lasaaray?","The answer is **A: U yeerid xog shaqsiyeed (Collection of personal data)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that:

*  ""Culays dib looma saarin xasuusashad qofka..."" -  The emphasis is *no longer* on remembering things personally.
* ""...xasuusashada qoraalka ayaa noqotay mid diiradda la saaray."" - The focus has shifted to remembering *written* information.
* ""Dib u cusbonaysinta ayaa samaysay is badal muuqa uu ku aadan u dhawaanshaha barashada iyo is dhex galka aqoonta."" - This implies a shift towards external storage and retrieval of information.

Therefore, the passage implies a reduced need for (and thus less ""weight"" or emphasis on) collecting personal data for memory purposes.  The focus is now on processing and managing information that is already externally stored (in written form).

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Helitaanka aqoon (Access to knowledge):**  The passage describes a shift in *how* knowledge is accessed and remembered, not a decrease in the desire or importance of accessing knowledge itself.  In fact, the ""dib u cusbonaysinta"" (renewal/re-design) makes accessing knowledge *easier*.
* **C: U yeerid xog qoraaleed (Collection of textual data):** The passage explicitly states that the focus is on remembering textual information, suggesting a *increased* emphasis on collecting textual data.
* **D: Qaybinta xogta (Sharing of data):** The passage doesn't directly address data sharing, and the shift in memory focus doesn't necessarily indicate a change in data sharing practices.

Midkee kamida kuwaan soo socda oo aan ka turjumayn dhiirigalinta isticmaalka internetka si loo sii wado xiriirada?,"The correct answer is **A: Isku xirka ganacsiga** (Business networking).

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""xiriir sii socda"" (ongoing relationships) as a motivator for internet use.  Let's break down the options:

*   **Isku xirka ganacsiga (Business networking):** While possible to do online, business networking is generally driven by professional goals and financial gain, not necessarily the continuation of personal relationships.
*   **La xiriirka qoyska (Connecting with family):**  Directly relates to maintaining existing relationships.
*   **Cilmi baarista safarka (Travel research):** Can be done independently and isn't inherently about relationship maintenance.
*   **Lakulanka dad cusub (Meeting new people):** Can lead to new relationships, thus fitting the theme of ""xiriir sii socda.""

Therefore, ""isku xirka ganacsiga"" is the least aligned with the passage's definition of internet use motivated by ongoing relationships.



"
Midkee kamida kuwaan soo socda oo aan ka turjumayn dhiirigalinta isticmaalka internetka ee ku lug lahaaanshaha shaqsiyeed?,"The answer is **A: eegidda qaab-kariska cunto (looking at diet plans)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses motivations for internet use categorized as either broad (extensive networks) or personal (close relationships). It specifically mentions ""personal involvement"" and ""sustained relationships"" as driving forces.

* **Looking at diet plans (eegidda qaab-kariska cunto)** falls under the category of personal interest and self-improvement, rather than fostering connections with others. It's a solitary activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **Ku post-garaynta rugta falanqaynta onlaynka ah (posting on online review boards):** This involves interaction and sharing opinions with others, fitting the ""personal involvement"" category.
* **Cilmi baarista alaabta daryeelka caafimaadka (researching health products):** While potentially solitary, it can be driven by a desire for personal well-being, which can indirectly impact relationships. It's more likely to be a personal motivation than a relational one.
* **Maaraynta dhaqaalaha (managing finances):** This can be a personal responsibility, but it's often connected to future relationships (e.g., financial security for a family).

Therefore, ""looking at diet plans"" is the most clearly personal activity *not* directly tied to building or maintaining relationships, making it the best answer.



"
Goorma ayay galbeedka yurub joojiyeen ku tiirsanaanta saamayta oo ay bilaabeen hormarinta habkooda u gaarka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku dhawaad ilaa dhamaadka Qarniyadii Dhexe**.

Here's why: The passage states: ""Inta lagu jiray waqtiyadii dhexe ayay Yurubta galbeed bilowday inay kobciso qaabkeeda u gaarka ah."" This implies that the influence of the East (specifically the Byzantine culture) gradually diminished towards the end of the Middle Ages, as Western Europe developed its own distinct styles. The passage also mentions that the influence could last 25-30 years, but the overall trend was towards Western European development.
"
Isticmaalka badhamada dharka lagu xidho natiijo ka dhalatay maxay bay ahayd? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ololihii Saliibiyiinta**.

The text states: ""Waxyalaaha la soo kordhiyay ugu waawaynaa xilligaas ee ka dhashay weeraradii saliibiyiinta waxa uu ahaa in dadku badhamo ku xirtaan dharka."" This translates to ""The most significant innovation during that time, originating from the Crusades, was people wearing tunics."" Therefore, the use of tunics as clothing resulted from the Crusades.

Keeba arrimaha soo socda ayaa ah kuwa inta badan ay u badan tahay inay soo baxaan inta ay sii joogaan dhulka kullaylaha ee dalka Singapore?,"The correct answer is **C: La il daran kulaylka so baxaaya** (Dealing with intense heat).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...waxaad u baahan doontaa inaad la tacaasho kul (badana) iyo qorraxda daran (marka cirku bilaa daruur yahay, aad dhif u ah).""  This translates to ""...you will need to deal with heat (a lot) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, it's very little).""

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: Lagu weeraray** (Being attacked): The text doesn't mention any danger of attacks.
*   **B: Aanan wax isticmaal ah la lahayn tukaamada** (Not having any useful items in stores): The text says you can buy almost anything after arrival, implying stores are available.
*   **D: Lumaayo** (Disappearing): This has no connection to the provided text.

Yaa laga yaabaa inuu rabo inuu iska ilaaliyo cunista keega Jarmalka?,"The correct answer is **A: Qof qabo xassasada qumbaha ee aadka u daran (Someone with a severe almond allergy)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that many German desserts contain almonds (""badan oo kamida alaabada moorsan ee Jarmalka ayaa sidoo kale leh almonada"").
* Almonds are a common allergen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qofka aad u doorbido macmacaanka aadka u fiican (Someone who prefers very sweet desserts):** The text describes German desserts as rich and delicious, implying they would appeal to someone who enjoys sweet things.
* **C: qofka aadka u naceb shukulaatada (Someone who hates chocolate):** While some German desserts might contain chocolate, the text doesn't highlight chocolate as a dominant ingredient. The focus is more on almonds, fruits, and coffee pairings.
* **D: Qofka waxyaabaha macmacaanka ah ka door bida waxyaabaha dhanaanka ah (Someone who prefers healthier snacks):** The text describes German desserts as rich and indulgent, not healthy.



"
Maaddadee loo tixgaliyaa inay tahay shay marmar la isticmaalo marka la sameeynaayo keega Jarmal?,"The correct answer is **A: Tufaaxa (Apple)**.

The passage states: ""Macmacaanada miraha waa la helaa, iyadoo tufaaxa loo kariyo sida macmacaanka sanadka oo dhan..."" which translates to ""Fruit sweets are available, with apples being cooked like sweets all year round...""

"Iyada oo ku saleysan marinka, kuwan soo socda midkee ayaan noqon doonin tilmaanta lagu taliyey ee miisaaniyada marka la safraayo?","The correct answer is **C: Dadka lacag weydiiso (Asking people for money)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the advice is to *avoid* actions like:

*   ""martida ay wax xadin"" (don't be a burden on others)
*   ""xad gudbin"" (don't overstep boundaries)
*   ""ka qayb galin suuqa sharci darrada"" (don't participate in illegal markets)
*   ""baryootamin"" (begging)
*   ""sinaba ku isticmaalin dadka inay ka faa’idaan"" (don't take advantage of people)

Asking people for money falls directly under the category of taking advantage of others and being a burden, and is therefore discouraged.

The other options are aligned with the advice:

*   **A: Raadi shaqooyin aan caadi ahayn oo aad qabato inta lagu jiro safarkaaga (Look for unusual jobs to do during your travels):** This is a way to offset costs.
*   **B: Ahaaw mid dabacsan oo waxwalbo qabsada isaga oo noolashiisa kale iska wato (Be flexible and handle everything while living your other life):** This implies managing expenses and being adaptable.
*   **D: Iska yareeska kharashaadka sida cuntada iyo hoyga (Reduce expenses such as food and accommodation):** This is a core principle of budget travel.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaa laga yaabaa in ay ku adag tahay in uu ku safro miisaaniyad aad u yar?","The correct answer is **A: Qof soo dhaweeya loolanka (Someone who is chasing a thrill/adventure)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people looking for relaxation, time, and budget-friendly travel should look for the ""smallest travel odoros"" (smallest travel cost). It then lists things *not* to do to save money, such as engaging in illegal markets, begging, or exploiting people. 

Therefore, someone chasing a thrill is *more likely* to be tempted by risky and potentially expensive activities (implied by the things to avoid) and thus have difficulty traveling on a tight budget. The other options aren't directly contrasted with the budget-friendly travel advice in the passage.
"
Keebaa kamid ah bayaanada soo socda oo aan si sax ah u qeexin wadista u dhaxaysa Point Marion iyo Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **C: Xaddidaadda xawaaraha ayaa si dhif ah loogu hoggaansamay.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that speed limits are *lower* than before and are frequently not adhered to. It emphasizes the importance of slow, cautious driving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxaa jira goobo dheer oo jidad baadiyaha fog ah (There are long stretches of remote highway).** The passage focuses on the *lack* of highway, describing winding roads through wooded areas and unpaved sections.
* **B: Waddooyinku waa cidhiidhi (The roads are narrow).** The passage mentions narrow roads but also highlights uneven, deteriorating sections. Narrowness isn't the primary concern emphasized.
* **D: Adeegga taleefanka gacantu waa inuusan noqon arrin dhibaato ah (Cell phone service is not a problem).** The passage doesn't mention cell phone service at all. It focuses on the challenging driving conditions.



Therefore, option C is the only statement directly contradicted by the information provided in the passage."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ayaa noqon kara walaaca ugu weyn ee darawalada ku safraya wadada Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **D: In aay la kulmaan shaqo waddo oo joogto ah (Encountering ongoing road work)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...janjeera, wadooyin ciriiri, iyo meelo wadada ka qaloocanayso oo cariiri ah ayaa wadooyinka ku badan."" (meaning potholes, narrow roads, and roads with patches of gravel). This indicates rough road conditions.
* It also mentions that speed limits are reduced and caution is necessary. This points towards potential hazards like road work or poor road maintenance.
* While the other options *could* be concerns, they are not directly mentioned or implied by the text.  There's no information about phone service, tire issues, or sharp turns being a primary worry.

Therefore, the constant mention of poor road conditions strongly suggests that encountering ongoing road work (or the result of road work - patches, potholes, etc.) is the most likely and significant concern for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburg road.
"
Kuwa soo socda kee baa loo baahnayn si uu u bilaabo safarka lagu safraayo goobaha dalxiiska ee canyoneering-ka?,"The correct answer is **B: Xaalad jireed ee ugu sarreysa (Good physical condition)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states canyoning involves navigating canyons with water, requiring swimming, climbing, and potentially jumping.
* It also mentions needing to build up some body strength to handle activities like rock climbing, jumping, or scrambling.
* Therefore, a good overall physical condition is essential to start canyoning.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Awoodda dabaasha (Swimming ability):** While important, the passage doesn't explicitly say swimming ability is the *most* crucial requirement *to start*. 
* **C: Kartida booditaanka (Jumping ability):**  Jumping might be involved, but it's not mentioned as a fundamental requirement to *begin*.
* **D: Tababar aad u yar (Very little training):** Canyoning is an adventurous activity that requires a reasonable level of training to be safe.  ""Very little training"" would be dangerous.



"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa lagama maarmaan u noqon kara si uu socdaalka-dalxiiska u noqdo mid guul laga gaaro?,"The correct answer is **C: Haysashada shahaadada dalxiiska canyoneering-ka (Having a canyoning certification)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt describes canyoning as a dangerous activity involving potential hazards like flooding.**  It explicitly states that some body strength is needed to start (e.g., climbing rocks, jumping).
* **Canyoning certification indicates that someone has received proper training and instruction in the techniques, safety procedures, and risk management associated with canyoning.** This is *crucial* for a successful and safe trip.
* **A: Kartida sare ee ciyaaraha (High level of athletic ability):** While helpful, athletic ability isn't a substitute for proper training and knowledge.
* **B: Waayo-aragnimadii hore ee quusitaanka (Previous experience with jumping):**  Again, experience is good, but without certification, it's risky.
* **D: Kartida dabaasha (Swimming ability):**  While swimming ability can be useful in some canyoning situations, it's not the most important factor for overall safety and success. Certification covers a wider range of skills and safety protocols.

Therefore, a canyoning certification is the most essential requirement for a successful and safe canyoning trip.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa caawin kara qof qorsheynaya inuu kaamka ku dhex galo baabuurkiisa?","The correct answer is **C: Teendho (Platform)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ka samaysashada teendho meel dhisme gaara ah ama tuulo baaxad kasta ha lahaatee ayaa si fuduud u soo jiidan karta dareen aan loo baahnayn."" (Creating a platform in any custom-built space or even a large town can easily evoke an unexpected feeling.)  This directly links platforms to making the car more appealing for travel.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Faham adag oo ku saabsan xaddidaadaha gaarigaaga (A deep understanding of your car's limitations):** While understanding limitations is important for safe driving, it doesn't directly address the question of making the car *appealing* for travel.
* **B: Gaadhi u ogolaanaya in kuraasta hoos loo dhigo (A car that allows reclining seats):** The passage mentions reclining seats as *part* of making a car suitable for travel, but it highlights platforms as a simpler and effective way to add appeal.
* **D: Hanti gaar ah oo lagu isticmaalo xerada (Special equipment used for the base/platform):**  The passage doesn't mention special equipment; it focuses on the concept of a platform itself.



Therefore, **C** is the best answer based on the text provided."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa looga baahanyahay in dadka gawaarida xeerada la imaanaya looga baahnayahay in aay iska ilaaliyaan hadii aay doonayaan in aay xarada gaari kusii wataan?","The correct answer is **A: Wadista baabuurta wa weyn, sida SUV ama minivan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Gaadhi xero ka dhigashadu waxay suurto gal tahay hadaad haysato gaari wayn, SUV, Sedan ama Station Wagon leh kuraasi la dejiyay."" This translates to ""It is possible to turn a car into a home if you have a large car, SUV, Sedan or Station Wagon with foldable seats.""

This indicates that having a larger vehicle, specifically an SUV or minivan (which are types of large cars), is a prerequisite for comfortably turning a car into a mobile home.  The other options aren't directly supported by the text.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaa dib u dhisay Casablanca markii labaad?","The correct answer is **D: Suldaanka Marooko**.

The text states: ""waxaana baneeyen kadib dhul gariirki 1755 Sultaankii Marookaanka ahaa waxaana magaalada dib ugu dhisay Daru l-Badya ahaan..."" This directly indicates that the Sultan of Morocco rebuilt Casablanca.
"
Yaa ka tagay magaalada Casablanca ee casriga ah ka dib masiibadii dabiiciga ahayd?,"The correct answer is **B: Boortaqiiska**.

The text states: ""waxaana baneeyen kadib dhul gariirki 1755 Sultaankii Marookaanka ahaa waxaana magaalada dib ugu dhisay Daru l-Badya ahaan waxana magaca Kasabalansa u bixiyay ganacsadayaal Isbaanish oo halkaas ka samaystay saldhigyo ganacsi."" This translates to: ""it was conquered after the earthquake of 1755, and the Moroccan Sultan rebuilt it as Dar l-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given by Spanish merchants who established trading posts there.""

Therefore, the Portuguese were the ones who left the city after the earthquake and the Spanish later rebuilt it and gave it its current name.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sidee Sintra ku heshay aqoonsiga ajaanibka dhexdooda?","The correct answer is **C: dib u eegista togan ee Lord Byron**.

This indicates that Lord Byron's fondness for Sintra and his ownership of a property there contributed to its popularity among foreign visitors.

While Cabo da Roca and the Marian apparitions are mentioned as attractions in the region, the text explicitly links Lord Byron to Sintra's appeal to foreigners.

Maxaa Armenia loo aqoonsanayn?,"The correct answer is **D: Jamhuuriyadda cusub**.

The passage states: ""Si kasto ay ahaato lama aas aasing qaran – xita Armenian – si rasmiyan loma aqoonsan."" This translates to ""Despite being a new state – even Armenian – it was not officially recognized.""  Therefore, the new state, Nagorno-Karabakh, wasn't officially recognized.

Maxaa weli saameynaya xiriirka ka dhexeeya Azerbaijan iyo Armenia?,"The best answer is **D: Gobolka Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Muran siyaadeed ka dhashay gobolka ayaa waxyeeleeyay xiriirka ka dhexeeya Armiiniya iyo Azerbaijan."" (A political dispute arising from the region has damaged relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.)  This directly points to Nagorno-Karabakh as the core issue.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Armeniyiinta ku nool Asarbayjan:** While the situation of Armenians living in Azerbaijan is a sensitive issue, the passage highlights the *origin* of the conflict and the broader impact of the region itself.
* **B: Dagaalkii 1994kii:** The 1994 war was *caused* by the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh. It's a major event, but not the underlying continuing influence.
* **C: Doodaha diblomaasiyadeed:** Diplomatic disputes are a *result* of the underlying conflict, not the primary continuing influence on the relationship.



Therefore, the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh is the most fundamental and ongoing factor impacting the relationship between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

"Markaad taksi ku raacdo Charlotte, maxaa keeni kara in laga qaado lacag dheeraad ah?","The correct answer is **B: Hadii aad haysato saddex rakaab (If you have more than two passengers)**.

The text states: ""Waxaa jirta lacag dulsaar marka ay wixii ka badan laba dadka rakaabka, doorashadan waxay noqon kartaa mid aad qaali u hadan laga maarmaan ah."" This translates to ""There is a surcharge if there are more than two passengers, this option can be expensive but sometimes necessary.""

The other options are not mentioned in the text as reasons for extra charges.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa loo qaadan karaa hoos u dhac ku yimaadda la noolaanshaha Charlotte carruurta?","The correct answer is **B: Raacitaanka tagsiga (Commuting)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Guud ahaan qoysaska Jaarloot degani ma adeegsadaan tagaasida, in kastoo ay waxtar yeelan karaan xaaladaha qaar. Waxaa jirta lacag dulsaar marka ay wixii ka badan laba dadka rakaabka, doorashadan waxay noqon kartaa mid aad qaali u hadan laga maarmaan ah.""

This indicates that commuting (traveling to and from work/school) is a potential drawback or source of difficulty for families living in Charlotte.  The cost of commuting is highlighted as a significant factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qiimaha guryaha (Home prices)** While home prices can be high, the text doesn't directly link them to a *drawback* for children's well-being.
*   **C: Dadka degan deegaanada kale (People from other regions)** The text says people move *to* Charlotte *because* of its good environment for children, not because they are a negative factor.
*   **D: Isku dayga inaad ku raaxaysato magaalada (Trying to enjoy the city)** The text suggests that families *do* enjoy the city and that it's a positive aspect.



"
"Ka hor inta uusan imaanin Isbaanishka, yaa maamuli jiray qaybta waqooyi ee Chile?","The correct answer is **D: Inkas**.

The passage states: ""Ka hor intaanu Isbaanishku imaanin qarnigii 16aad, Chile ta waqooyi waxay ku hoos jirtay xukunki Inca..."" which translates to ""Before the Spanish came in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Inca...""
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan dhicin 1810?","The correct answer is **B: Chile ayaa guul ka gaartay Isbaanishka**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""In kastoo Jayl ku dhawaaqday madaxbanaanideeda 1810... guul go’aan leh lagama gaarin Isbaanishka illaa iyo 1818.""  This means Chile did *not* achieve a decisive victory over the Spanish in 1810.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxaa mesha ka maqnaani jiray dowlad dhexe:** The text says Napoleon's wars caused a power vacuum in Spain for two years, meaning a central authority was *absent*. This is true, and happened around 1810.
* **C: Dagaaladii Napoleon-ka ayaa lagu dagaalamayey:** The text confirms that Napoleon's wars were happening and causing a power vacuum in Spain around 1810.
* **D: Chile waxay ku dhawaaqday in aay heshay madaxbannaani:**  While Jayl declared independence in 1810, the text says this was *not* a decisive victory and independence wasn't fully achieved until 1818.



Therefore, the only option that *didn't* happen in 1810, according to the text, is that Chile achieved a victory over the Spanish."
Sidee dadku u gaari karaan tuulooyinka fogfog ee baadiyaha ah ee gobolka Liguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Iyada oo la isticmaalaya tareen ama doon**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Wadooyin, tareeno, iyo doomo ayaa taga xaafada laakin baaburta dibada kama soo geli karaan."" (Roads, trains, and boats go to the village, but cars cannot come from outside.)
* This means cars *cannot* access the villages directly.
* Therefore, the only options available are train and boat.
"
Waa maxay macnaha erayga Talyaaniga 'Cinque Terre'?,"The correct answer is **A: Shan tuulo (Five Villages)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Cinque Terra, oo la macno ah Shan Dhul, wuxuu ka kooban yahay tuulo xeebeed yar oo ku taal Romaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza iyo Monterosso kuwaasoo ku yaal gobolka Talyaanig ee Liguria."" This translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Villages, consists of five small seaside villages located in the Liguria region of Italy.""
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kabo noocee ah ayaa ku habboon in la isticmaalo marka lagu jiro xaalada sambariiraxada ee jiilaalka?","The correct answer is **A: kawo buut leh cidhib dhuuban** (boots with a ribbed sole).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kabaha qaar ayaa leh furuuruc waxaana jira qalab lagu kordhiyo oo isna furuuruc leh looguna talo galay meelaha sibiibixanaya, kuwaaso ku habboon kabaha iyo buudhka intooda badan, **cidhibaha ama cagta hoose ee kabta**.""  This translates to: ""Some boots have a ribbed sole and there are devices to add a ribbed sole, which are suitable for boots and footwear in icy areas, suitable for the soles or bottom of the boot.""

Therefore, boots with a ribbed sole are the best choice for icy conditions during winter.
"
Kee baa ka mid ah kuwan aan gacan ka geysan doonin hagaajinta jiidashada waddooyinka barafka ah inta lagu jiro xaaladaha qaboobaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bacaadka (Salt)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that salt (milix) and sand (cusbad) are used to improve traction on icy roads.
*   The passage mentions that sand is used to improve traction on roads by being spread on them.
*   The passage **does not** mention using salt.
*   **The provided options are the likely candidates:** Sand improves traction, salt improves traction.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Bacaadka (Salt)**.

**Note:** There seems to be a slight discrepancy in the question's wording and the provided text, however, based on the information given, the correct answer is C."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa si sax ah u qeexaya iskumid ahaanshaha u dhaxeeya Hawaii iyo Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxay wadaagaan xili waqtiyeed iskumid ah.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Iyagoo isu waqti la ah Hawaii..."" This means they share the same time zone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Labaduba waxay leeyihiin hudheelo waaweyn oo badan** - The text says the Cook Islands lack major tourist hotels.
* **B: Labaduba ma haystaan awood doowladnimo** - The text doesn't mention their political status, but it implies the Cook Islands are not independent.
* **D: Labadooduba ma laha magaalo** - The text says the Cook Islands lack major cities.



"
Midkee kuwan soo socda aan si sax ah aan u qeexaynin Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **B: Waa jasiirad leh wabiyo iyo haro** (It is an island with rivers and lakes).

Here's why:

*   The text states that the Cook Islands are made up of 15 diverse islands. It mentions Rarotonga and Aitutaki as the largest, but it **doesn't** say they have rivers and lakes. This statement isn't supported by the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported:

*   **A: Way ka yar tahay Hawaii** (It is smaller than Hawaii) - The text explicitly compares the Cook Islands to ""Hawaii hoosteeda"" (Hawaii's little sister) implying it's smaller.
*   **C: Magaalooyinka ugu waaweyn waa Rarotonga iyo Aitutaki** (The largest towns are Rarotonga and Aitutaki) - The text directly states this.
*   **D: Dalka jasiiradda ayaa wadaag la ah Hawaii xaga waqtiga** (The island nation shares time with Hawaii) - The text mentions that the islands are ""isu waqti la ah Hawaii"" (in the same time as Hawaii).

Therefore, option B is the only statement that cannot be accurately confirmed from the text.
"
Midkee ka mid ah dhismahan soo socda ayaa bixiya laba nooc oo xulasho hoy ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Los Patos**.

The text states: ""La Leona, San Pedrillo, iyo Los Patos ayaa laga helaa xero dhigashada keli oo lahayn adeega cunto."" This translates to ""La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos can be found with isolated lodges and food service."" This indicates that Los Patos offers both isolated lodges (a type of lodging) and food service.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Sirena** is described as ""keli ah saldhigga oo laga helo jiifka degenaansho..."". This means it *only* offers lodging.
*   **La Leona** is described as having isolated lodges and food service, but the question asks for the *one* that has two options.
*   **San Pedrillo** is described as having isolated lodges and food service, but the question asks for the *one* that has two options.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, halkee ka heli kartaa ogolaanshaha baarkinka haddii aad rabtid inaad isticmaasho lacag caddaan ah bedelkii deynta?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

The text states: ""Waxaa suurta-gal ah in si toos ah looga helo rukhsadaha barxadda xarunta Ranger ee Puerto Jiménez, laakiin ma aqbalaan kaararka deynta Adeega Jardiinada (MINAE)...""

This translates to: ""It is possible to obtain permits for the Ranger Station grounds in Puerto Jiménez directly, but they do not accept Garden Service (MINAE) credit cards...""

Therefore, Puerto Jiménez is the only place mentioned where you can obtain a park permit directly, implying you can use cash instead of a credit card.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay nooca ciyaarta llagu dul ciyaaro barafka ee lagu sameeyo dhulka sare?","The correct answer is **A: Ku dul Socodka barafka (Snowshoeing)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hawshan waxaa sidoo kale loo yaqaanaaa ciyaaraha barafka... socodka dalxiiska ama socodka barafka..."" which translates to ""Snowshoeing is also known as snow sports... snow hiking or snow walking...""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Ciyaarta barafka ee diwada lagu sameeyo (Snow sports on artificial surfaces):** The text emphasizes going on natural terrain.
* **C: Ciyaarta nooca Alpine-ka (Alpine sport):** While snowshoeing can be done in alpine environments, the text doesn't specifically classify it as such. The focus is on the activity itself.
* **D: Wadashada boorsooyinka dhabarka ee ski-ga (Carrying ski backpacks):** This relates to skiing, not snowshoeing.
"
"Sida uu qabo tuduca, Maxaa caawin kara dadka baadiyada ee ku orda barafka ee raba in ay gaaraan xawaare sare?","The correct answer is **C: Xaaladaha wanaagsan (Good conditions)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the ice path is similar to a hiking trail, and when conditions are good, you can travel a bit further than hiking.  The question asks what would help people traveling on ice achieve higher speeds.  ""Good conditions"" directly relate to the ability to travel further and potentially faster on the ice.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Kabaha buutka adag (Sturdy boot crampons):** While crampons are important for traction, the text doesn't directly link them to speed. They are more for safety and preventing slips.
*   **B: Shandad dhabarka ah oo culus (Heavy backpack):** A heavy backpack would slow someone down, not help them achieve higher speeds.
*   **D: Wadooyinkii hore loo maray (Previously traveled paths):** While useful for navigation, previously traveled paths don't inherently guarantee higher speed. They just ensure a route exists.



Therefore, **Xaaladaha wanaagsan** is the most logical answer based on the provided text."
Dadka socotada ah ee la kulma shoogga dib-u-soo-celinta waa maxay waxa ku adag inay sameeyaan?,"The correct answer is **A: La qabsiga dhaqanka meesha cusub**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the difficulty travelers face in adapting to a new culture *after* returning home. It highlights the ease with which they adopt the new culture but the struggle to readjust to their original cultural norms.  Option A directly reflects this central theme.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: In dulqaad la yeesho iyo faham:** While the passage mentions the need for patience and understanding, it frames this as something *others* should provide to travelers, not as a specific difficulty faced by travelers themselves upon returning.
*   **C: U safrida dibadda:** The passage isn't about the act of traveling itself, but the consequences of it.
*   **D: Dib ula qabsiga dhaqanka gurigooda:** This is a consequence of the main difficulty, not the difficulty itself.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, musaafir noocee ah ayaa laga yabaa in si gaar ah ugu adkaato shoogga dib-u-soo-celinta?","The correct answer is **B: Dadka safarka ah oo si degdeg ah ula qabsaday inta ay ku noolaayeen dibadda.**

Here's why:

The passage highlights that the difficulty in readjusting to one's home culture stems from *quickly* adapting to a new culture.  The more readily someone adopts new customs while abroad, the more likely they are to experience a clash when returning.  Option B directly addresses this idea of rapid adaptation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dadka safarka ah ee la kulmay shoog dhaqan xumo gaar ah:**  Experiencing cultural shock doesn't inherently make someone better at readjusting. It's the *response* to the shock that matters.
* **C: Dadka socotada ah ee weli ku jira marxaladda bisha malabka ee arooska:** This is irrelevant to the topic of cultural readjustment.
* **D: Socotada dulqaadka yar:** The passage actually argues that *lack* of patience is a contributing factor to difficulty, not necessarily that people with little patience will be *better* at adjusting. It's the *absence* of the patience and understanding that makes the return more challenging.



"
Kuwan soo socda kee bay tahay inay dadku iska ilaaliyaan inay ku sameeyaan faras duureedka?,"The correct answer is **D: Inay ka fiirsadaan mel ka fog** (Observe from a distance).

Here's why:

The passage states that mosquitos don't attack unless they feel threatened.  Therefore, the best way to avoid being bitten is to avoid attracting them or startling them.  Observing from a distance minimizes the chance of doing either.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inay iska indho tiraan joogitaankooda** (Ignore their presence): This might work, but it's not a guaranteed method of safety.
*   **B: Inay ugu soo dhawaadan si tartiib ah** (Approach slowly): This is the *opposite* of what you should do, as it could startle the mosquito and provoke an attack.
*   **C: Inay yareeyaan heerkooda khatarnimada** (Reduce their perceived danger): This isn't directly actionable. The passage implies we need to reduce *our* perceived threat to the mosquito.

"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa bayaanada soo socda ee ku saabsan faras duureedka aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **A: Waa xayawaan dabiici ahaan ah mid dagaal badan (Are naturally aggressive animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that elk don't have a fighting nature but defend themselves when threatened. Option A directly contradicts this, saying they are *naturally* aggressive. This makes it the statement that is *not* supported by the passage.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported:

* **B: Mararka qaarkood looma arko khatar inay yihiin kuwa khatar ah (They are sometimes not seen as dangerous)** - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **C: Waxaa ka xanaajini karaa ama kicini karaa dadka ku sugan meesha u dhaw (They can be provoked or agitated by people nearby)** - The passage implies this by saying people may get too close and put themselves at risk.
* **D: Way is difaaci doonaan haddii loo baahdo (They will defend themselves if needed)** - This is explicitly stated in the passage.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwan soo socda keebaa ugu khatarta ugu ku keena socotada dhulka saxaraha ah?","The correct answer is **D: Biyaha oo ka dhamaada inta aay bursanayaan dhaaan dawangaalaha (Water depleting while sweating with the dew)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the biggest danger is dehydration.  It says: ""halkaasi na ku khasaariyo awoodiisa muhiimka ah iyo biyaha u dhiman"" (there you lose its important power and water to die).  Option D directly addresses this – the loss of water through sweating while interacting with the dew.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant to the core danger:

* **A: Maryo dhaxan reeb ah la’an xiliga qaboowga haweenki (A woman's cold sweating without a shawl in cold weather):**  While uncomfortable and potentially leading to hypothermia, it's a *consequence* of the situation, not the primary danger highlighted in the passage.
* **B: In aay arkayaan dhaan dawangaale oo ulamuuqanaayo sidii biyaha oo kale (Seeing dew that looks like water):** This is a trigger for the problem (the dew appearing like water), but it's not the danger itself.
* **C: Wakhtiga oo ku dhamaada inta aay bursanayaan dhaaan dawangaalaha (The time running out while sweating with the dew):** This is a *result* of the water loss, not the root cause of the danger.



Therefore, the passage emphasizes water loss as the main threat, making option D the most accurate choice.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan lagu xusin khatarta ka iman karta socotada saxaraha?,"The correct answer is **B: dhaaan dawangaale**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions the following dangers of hiking in the mountains:

*   **Water scarcity:** ""halkaasi na ku khasaariyo awoodiisa muhiimka ah iyo biyaha u dhiman"" (where you lose its importance and water to die).
*   **Hypothermia:** ""Xataa saxaraha ugu kulul ayaa noqon karaa mid aad iyo aad u qaboow habeenki. Barafow (Hypothermia) waa halis xaqiiq ah hadaadan wadan dhar ku kululeeya."" (Even the hottest rocks can become very cold at night. Hypothermia is a real danger if you don't wear warm clothes).

The passage does *not* mention:

*   **Water loss** (Option A) - Although related to water scarcity, the passage refers to water *loss* more directly.
*   **Heatstroke** (Option C) - The passage focuses on cold dangers, not heat.
*   **Sunburn** (Option D) - While sunburn is a concern in sunny environments, it's not mentioned in relation to mountain hiking in this passage.
*   **Dhaaan dawangaale** (Option B) - Dhaaan dawangaale (heatstroke) is not mentioned.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kooxdee bulshada kamid ah oo uu si weyn u saameeyay imaanshihi sahamiyeyaasha?","The correct answer is **C: Taínos**.

The text explicitly states that the Taíno people were the first inhabitants of the island and were severely impacted by the arrival of the Spanish. The passage details their decline due to the Spanish conquest and violence.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Luuqdee ayay ku hadli jireen dadka Caribyada?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The text states: ""Kariibisku waxay ahaayeen dad ku hadla Arawakan kuwaasoo meesha yimi abbaaro 10,000 BCE."" This directly indicates that the Caribbeans spoke Arawakan.
"
Yaa loo aqoonsan karaa inuu caan bixiyay skiing-ka oo shaaciyay inuu yahay waxqabad madadaalo ahaan loo ciyaaro?,"The correct answer is **B: Noorwiijiga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ciyaaraha buur-taraaraxa barafka isboorti ahaan waxay jireen ugu yaraan illaa qarnigii 17aad, iyadoo 186-gii naadiga ugu horreeyay ee ciyaarta barafka ay fureen Norwijiyaanka Australiya.""

This directly indicates that the Norwegians were the ones who established the first ski clubs and popularized skiing as a recreational activity. While the passage mentions ""ski bums"" as people who enjoy backcountry skiing, it doesn't say they popularized the sport.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waqti intee le'eg ayaa markii ugu horeysay ee skiing-ka loo aqoonsaday ciyaar ahaan?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The text states: ""Fikradda baraf kusocoshada waa mid aad u gabowday — sawir gacmeedyo oo muujinaya dadka barafka ku socda waxaa lasoo wariniyaa illaa iyo 5000 BC!"" (The idea of skiing is very old - cave paintings showing people skiing date back to 5000 BC!)
"
Kuwan soo socda keebaa caadi ahaan la xidhiidhiyaa jasiiradda ugu weyn ee ka baxsan xeebaha bariga Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Duurjoogta (Wildlife)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Madagaskar ayaa ah tan ugu fog, lehna qaarad ugaara markii loo eego duurjoogta."" (Madagascar is the farthest, and has unique wildlife.)

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, the question asks what is *commonly* associated with the largest island outside the East African coast, and the passage specifically highlights its unique wildlife as a key characteristic.
"
Waa maxay mida aan ahayn sifada jasiiradaha yar ee Bariga Afrika? ,"The correct answer is **C: Sumcada duurjoogta**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Madagaskar ayaa ah tan ugu fog, lehna qaarad ugaara markii loo eego duurjoogta."" This means Madagascar *is* known for its unique wildlife, not that all the smaller islands have this characteristic. The passage then goes on to describe many smaller islands as beach resorts, implying that wildlife isn't a defining feature of all of them.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Xiriir la leh Faransiiska** - The passage states that many smaller islands have ties to France.
*   **B: Leh goobo badan oo raaxa loogu talagalay** - The passage describes many smaller islands as ""goobaha dalxiiska xeebta"" (beach tourist destinations).
*   **D: Madaxbanaanida wadamaha kale** - The passage mentions that ""Badi jasiiradaha yar yar ayaa dawlado madax banaan"" (many of the smaller islands are independent states).



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sidee Easter-ka loogu dabaaldegaa qaar ka mid ah kaniisadaha dhaqanka?","The correct answer is **B: Martigelinta xalfada vigil-ka ee habeenka Sabtida.**

The text explicitly states: ""Kaniisadooyin dhaqan oo badan ayaa ku qabsada Bariga Vigil habeenka sabtida ee isbuuca Easter-ka, ayadoo jameecadu aay saqda dhexe ay u dabaal dagayaan dib usoo saarka Ciise masiixi.""  This means they hold a vigil (a special service held at night) on Saturday night during Easter, where people gather to celebrate Jesus' resurrection.  The vigil involves prayers and ceremonies leading up to the Easter morning celebration.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qabashada ducada bacriminta** (Holding a prayer of thanksgiving) - While thanksgiving might be part of the celebration, the text focuses on the vigil service itself.
* **C: In loo sameeyo xaflada gu'ga jameecada dadka ee isku imaaday** (Holding a feast for all the people who have gathered) - A feast might follow the vigil, but the text specifically mentions the vigil service.
* **D: Daawashada qorrax ka soo baxa** (Watching the sun rise) - Watching the sunrise is a part of the Easter celebration in many cultures, but the text doesn't say it's *how* the Eastern Orthodox churches celebrate. It describes their *service*.



"
"Si looga fogaado shuruudaha qaarkood marka la gelayo Ecuador, waa maxay waxa muwaadin kuban ah laga rabo inuu marka hore haysto?","The correct answer is **B: Warqad martiqaad ah oo sharciyeysan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ekwadoor waxay muwaadiniinta Kuuba ka rabtaa inay helaan warqad martiqaad ka hor intaanay ka soo gelin madaarada caalamiga ah ee Ekwador...""

While the other options are requirements, the question asks what is needed to *avoid* some of the requirements. The text says Cuban citizens *with a Green Card* need to go to the Ecuadorean Consulate to waive this requirement. Therefore, a visa is the primary thing needed to enter Ecuador.
"
Maxay yihiin shuruudaha safarka Ecuador ee aan loogu talagelin oo qasabka ahayn?,"The correct answer is **C: Xaqiijinta dhererka mudada joogitaanka qofka socotada ah** and **D: Xaqiijinta ansaxnimada baasaboorka**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Safarka dhaqsaha/waqtiga dheerba waxaa la doonaya in la xaqiijiyo waqtiga aad joogeyso.""  This directly addresses the verification of the length of stay.

The text also states: ""Basaboor kaaga waa inu ahada mid aan dhacsanen ugu yaraan lix bilood ka hor inta aadan safrin."" This is a direct requirement for passport validity.

While options B and A *could* be requirements in other contexts, they are not specifically mentioned as mandatory or non-optional requirements in the provided text about Ecuador's travel regulations for Cuban citizens.
"
Kuwa soo socda keebaa ka kharash badan ku bixi marka la joogo waddan shisheeye marka loo eego wadanka guriga?,"The correct answer is **B: Ookiyaalha ama muraayada indhaha ee heerka sare** (High-quality contact lenses or eyeglasses).

Here's why:

* **The text specifically mentions that imported, genuine contact lenses or eyeglasses can be more expensive than domestically produced ones.** It states, ""Alaaboyinka sare ee aagagaas ku diyaar ah waxa laga yaabaa inay laba mushkilo yeelato; qaar waxa laga yaabaa inay yihiin koobi, halka kuwa dhabta ah ee la soo dhoofiyay ay ka qaalisan yihiin kuwa waddanka."" (High-quality goods in that area may have two problems; some may be counterfeit, while the genuine imported ones are more expensive than domestic ones.)

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Baaritaanka araga iyo cudurada indhaha (Eye exams and eye diseases):**  While these can be costly, the text doesn't specifically indicate a significant price difference compared to home.
* **C: Caymiska aragga (Vision insurance):** The text mentions checking if insurance covers eye exams and medication, but it doesn't imply insurance is inherently more or less expensive abroad.
* **D: Qaybaha aan magaca aqoonsiga aan lahayn (Counterfeit parts):** The text mentions counterfeit goods, but it focuses on high-quality imported items being *more* expensive, not counterfeit items being cheaper.



"
Maxay noqon kartaa khatarta ka iman karta ka iibsashada Ookiyaalha ama muraayada indhaha ee heerka sare waddan shisheeye?,"The correct answer is **C: Daawadu waxa laga yaaba in ay noqon kartaa mid been abuur ah.**

Here's why:

The passage highlights several risks associated with buying eye drops from foreign countries, particularly those with lower wages and potentially lax regulations. It mentions:

* **Counterfeit products:**  ""qaar waxa laga yaabaa inay yihiin koobi"" (some may be counterfeit).
* **Higher prices for imported genuine products:** ""kuwa dhabta ah ee la soo dhoofiyay ay ka qaalisan yihiin kuwa waddanka"" (genuine imported ones are more expensive than domestic ones).

The most direct and concerning implication is that the eye drops may not contain the ingredients they claim to have, making them ineffective or even harmful.  Therefore, the possibility of the medication being fake (been abuur ah) is the primary danger.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Baaeitaan dheeraad ah oo lagu samayni doono Isha ayaa loo baahani:** While possible, this is a consequence *of* using a bad product, not the primary risk.
* **B: Daawadu waxa laga yaaba in aanay u ansax ahayn qaybo gaar ah:**  This is a less impactful risk than the possibility of the entire product being fake.
* **D: Waxa laga yaabaa in aanu caymisku uusan bixinin kharashka:** This is a financial risk, but not as directly related to the safety and effectiveness of the product as the other options.



"
"Marka la eego isticmaalka lacagta Falklands, keebaa sax ah bayaanadan soo socda?","The correct answer is **C: Poundka Falkland waa in la beddelaa marka laga tago jasiiradaha.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Waxa ay ay tahay mid aan suro gal aheyn sarifka lacagta Falklands marka aad ka so baxdo jasiirada, sarifka lacagta jirintaanka ka tegida jasiiradaha."" This means you *must* exchange Falkland Pounds before leaving the islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaliya kaararka deynta iyo giniga Ingiriiska ayaa laga aqbalaa jasiiradaha ka baxsan:** The text says British Pounds are *generally* accepted outside the islands, and US dollars are *often* accepted.  It doesn't restrict acceptance to only credit cards and gold.
* **B: Stanley waa meesha kaliya ee aqbali doonta doolarka Mareykanka:** The text says US dollars are *often* accepted throughout the islands, not just in Stanley.
* **D: Marka laga reebo lacagta Pound-ka ee Falkland, pound-ka Ingiriiska guud ahaan waa lacagta ugu badan ee la aqbalo:** The text identifies the Falkland Pound as the official currency. While British Pounds are widely accepted, the text doesn't say they are *more* accepted than Falkland Pounds.

"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, marka aad u safraysid Falklands adiga oo ka yimid Mareykanka, xagee laga yaabaa in nooc lacag-bixineed oo aan ahayn kaarka deynta ay faa'iido gaar ah leedahay?","The correct answer is **A: Dukaanka FIC West**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lacagta Biritishaka ayaa si guud looga aqbalaya meelkasto ka mida jasiiradaha... Lacagta debeda ku yaal kaadhadhka deynta lama aqbalo sida badan..."". This means credit cards are generally *not* accepted on the islands.

The question asks where a non-credit card payment might be *advantageous*. The passage says the official currency (FKP) can be exchanged at a bank *only* located in Stanley, across from FIC West.  Therefore, FIC West is the place where you would likely exchange USD for FKP.
"
Dhacdodee ayaan la xidhiidhin dabbaaldegga ciidaha macbudka?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhalashadii ilaahyaasha**.

Here's why:

The text states that temple festivals are often celebrated ""as part of the temple's anniversary or before the birth of the deity or other events related to the temple.""  Since ""birth of the deity"" directly refers to the birth of the gods, option C is the most accurate.
"
Halkee lagu arki karaa maroodiyaal la qurxiyey ee la sharaxay?,"The correct answer is **C: Geeddi-socodka xafladaha macbudka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals are celebrated throughout the year, starting from late November to mid-May. It also mentions that decorated and explained chariots (maroodiyaal la sharxay) are a part of these festivals. Therefore, you would see these chariots during the course of the temple festival processions.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwan soo socda keebaa ugu macquulsan ee lagu kaydini kara lacagta ganacsiga ama tikidka diyaarada heerka koowaad?","The correct answer is **D: Helitaanka qiimo dhimista (Getting a discount)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Marka loo hadlo si guud, ma jiro qodob taxaa marka loo eego qiimo dhimista ganacsiyada ama kuraasta dabaqada kowaad ee dagaalka ugu jirtay laga bilaabo A ilaa B."" This means getting a discount is the most logical way to save money on first-class business tickets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adiga oo ku kharash gareeynaayo shirkaddaada (Spending your own money):** The passage says that even spending your own money is expensive, costing four times the normal business class fare and seventeen times the first-class fare.
* **B: Diwaangashiga tikidka heerka koowaad alkii aad ka iibsan lahayd ganacsiga (Registering a first-class ticket you would have bought through the business):** This isn't a way to save money; it's just a registration process.
* **C: Diwaangashiga duulimaad aan toos ahayn heerka koowaad (Registering a non-direct first-class flight):**  The passage doesn't suggest this is a cost-saving measure, and it might even be more expensive.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa wakhti lumis ah in la raadiyo marka la buuxsanaayo heerarka qiimaha qaarkooda?","The correct answer is **C: Qimo dhimista (Fare bundling)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Marka loo hadlo si guud,ma jiro qodob taxaa marka loo eego qiimo dhimista ganacsiyada ama kuraasta dabaqada kowaad ee dagaalka ugu jirtay laga bilaabo A ilaa B."" This translates to ""Generally, there is no point in looking for fare bundling for business class or first class seats from A to B.""  Fare bundling is a way to combine different components of a trip (flights, hotels, car rentals) into a single package, often at a discounted price. The text implies it's not worthwhile.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Duulimaadyo toos ah (Direct flights):** The text doesn't say searching for direct flights is a waste of time.
*   **B: Heerka ganacsiga (Business class):**  The text discusses business class, but not specifically whether searching for business class fares is a waste of time.
*   **D: Heerka kowaad (First class):** Similar to business class, the text mentions first class but doesn't directly address whether searching for first-class fares is a waste of time.



"
Maxaan loo baahnayn in lagu daro marka la barbardhigayo wadarta qiyaasta qiimaha iyo Afrika iyadoo la barbardhigayo qiimaha safarka adduunka oo dhan?,"The correct answer is **D: Qiimaha gaadiidka dhulka ee meelaha ka baxsan Afrika**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ha ilaawin in aad ku darto lacagaha dheeriga fiisoyinka dheeriga, canshuurta bixitaanka, **gaari raaca dhulka, iwm. dhamaan meelaha Africa ka banaanka**.""  This directly links ground transportation costs *outside* of Africa to the overall cost comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qiimaha fiisaha dheeraadka ah ee meelaha ka baxsan Afrika:**  While relevant, the passage emphasizes ground transportation costs more directly.
* **B: Qiimaha canshuuraha dhoofka ee Afrika:** The passage focuses on the cost *outside* of Africa, not within.
* **C: Qiimaha fiisaha Afrika:** The passage doesn't mention the cost of visas *within* Africa.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of what needs to be added to the cost comparison.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay waxa dukaamada waaweyn ey bilaabeen inay bixiyaan doorashooyin kala duwan oo badan?","The correct answer is **A: Cunto diyaarsan (Ready-made food)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dukaamadu ayay u sameysanayaan qaybo cunto kala duwan oo diyaarsan ah."" (Stores are creating a variety of ready-made food sections.)

While options B, C, and D are mentioned as features of stores, the primary new offering highlighted is ready-made food.
"
Waa maxay adeegyada ay bixiyaan dukaamada waawayn qaarkood ee laga yaabaa inay soo jiidato macmiilka iibsanaya cunto diyaarsan?,"The correct answer is **D: Kululeeyaha lagu kululeeyo cuntada (Heating facilities for food)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Inta badan wadamada ama dukaamada qaar waxaa jiro maqaayado laga helo, intooda badana waxa ay leeyiin qiimoyin macquul gala. **Qaar ayaa xitaa leh kuleeliso ama qaab kale oo cuntada la kululaysto.**"" (Many countries or stores have restaurants available, most of them have reasonable prices. **Some even have heating or other ways of heating food.**)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Makhaayadaha goobta (On-site restaurants):** While some stores *have* restaurants, the passage isn't focusing on the availability of full restaurants as the key draw for pre-made food.
* **B: Xulashada yar ee kala duwan (Limited variety):** The passage says the selection *can be* limited, but it doesn't describe limited variety as a service that attracts customers.
* **C: Cunto cayriin ah (Takeaway food):** While takeaway is a type of pre-made food, the passage is highlighting specific *services* offered by stores, not just the *type* of food.



"
Kuwa soo socda kee baa laga yaabaa inaynan fahmin Belgian-ka ku hadla Faransiiska iyo Swiss-ka?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku dhawaaqida erayada Faransiiska qaarkood.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the pronunciation of words in Belgian and Swiss French differs slightly from standard French. While there's mutual intelligibility, these pronunciation differences are a key difference that could lead to misunderstanding.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Habka nambarada Faransiiska ee caadiga ah loo qoro (The way French numbers are normally written):** The passage mentions that the number system is slightly different, but it's not the primary source of potential misunderstanding. Written numbers are generally standardized.
*   **B: Erayada gaarka ah ee Faransiiska (Specific French words):** While some regional vocabulary might exist, the passage emphasizes pronunciation as the main difference.
*   **D: Inta badan Afka-Faransiiska looga hadlo Faransiiska (Most French is spoken in French):** This is a bit of a redundant statement. The whole passage discusses French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland.



Therefore, the most likely reason someone might struggle to understand Belgian or Swiss French is the different pronunciation of words."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan la mid ahayn Faransiiska sida lan laga isticmaalo Belgium ama Switzerland?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku dhawaaqida ereyada oo dhan (Pronunciation of all words)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the pronunciation of words in Belgian and Swiss French differs *slightly* from standard French. The other options are mentioned as aspects where the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland *align* with standard French:

*   **B: Habka nambarada loo qoro (The way numbers are written):** The text mentions that the number system has a slightly different structure.
*   **C: Heerka Faransiiska ee dugsiyada lagu dhigo (The level of French taught in schools):**  The text indicates that people in Belgium and Switzerland are taught a level of French to understand French law.
*   **D: Higaada ama qorista erayada Faransiiska qaarkood (The spelling or writing of some French words):** The text notes that there are slight variations in spelling.

Therefore, the only option that describes a difference is pronunciation.

Xaaladdee ayay u badan tahay in aan lagu siinin lacagta tacsiyada?,"The correct answer is **B: Haddii aad isku daydo inaad si toos ah iskaga so diiwaan galiso shirkad diyaarad inti aad adeeg ka raadsani lahayd qof saddexaad.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Si walbaba, waa inaad boos ku qabsatid adigoo si toos ah telefoon ugu diraysid shirkadda diyaaradda."" (In any case, you must claim a seat by directly calling the airline.)

Option B describes a situation where someone *isn't* directly contacting the airline but is using a third-party service. This is *not* the way to claim the benefit, and therefore would likely result in denial of the death benefit. The passage implies direct contact is required.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Haddii aad ku duuleyso WestJet** - The passage explicitly mentions WestJet offers death benefits, so this is incorrect.
*   **C: Haddii aad ku duulayso aiga oo isticmaalaayo adeega Lufthansa pp aad ka duulayso Paris kuna socoto Maraykanka** - This describes a specific travel scenario, but doesn't directly address why a death benefit might be denied.
*   **D: Haddii aad duuleyso Delta** - The passage explicitly mentions Delta offers death benefits, so this is incorrect.



"
Maxaa ka run ah lacagta safarka tacsiyada?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxay daboolayaan oo lagu bixiyaa kharashka safarka aaska** (They cover and are paid for the funeral travel expenses).

Here's why:

* The text states that airlines are now refunding the cost of funeral travel, reducing the cost of last-minute travel.
* Option A directly reflects this information by saying the refund covers funeral travel expenses.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * B: The text says to contact the airline *directly*, not book through their website.
    * C: The text mentions last-minute travel, but doesn't specify *what* is covered, only that the *cost* of travel is being refunded.
    * D: While direct phone contact is recommended, the option doesn't accurately define what the refund *is* for.



"
Goorma ayaa isticmaalka qalabka GPS-ka ee aalada goonida ah uga fududaan karaa marka lala barbar dhigo app-ka hagista GPS-ka?,"The correct answer is **C: Marka aad khadka aad ka baxayso (When you are out of range)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that GPS devices are most useful when a mobile connection isn't available or when the phone is outside of its range. This is because the app's functionality is limited or lost without a connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Markaad isku dayayso inaad lacag kaydsato (When you are trying to save money):** While saving money *can* be a benefit, it's not the primary reason GPS devices are *more* useful than apps. The text emphasizes the lack of connectivity as a key factor.
* **B: Marka aad hubiso inaad u baahnaan doontid isku xirka xogta khadka (When you ensure you will need a data connection):** This is the opposite of when a GPS device would be more useful.
* **D: Marka aadan rabin inaad kireysato aalada (When you don't want to rent a device):**  This is a potential reason for choosing an app, but it doesn't directly relate to the functionality difference in terms of *ease of use* compared to a GPS device.



"
Waa maxay sababta aan wanaagsanayn ee isticmaalka aap-ka haga GPS-ka iyo habka lidka ku ah aaladda gooniga ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Uma baahnid inaad ka walwasho isku xirka xogta khadka (You don't need to worry about connecting to a data network)**.

Here's why:

The text states that GPS apps on your phone are good because they don't require you to buy new maps or rent GPS devices.  A key advantage of using your phone's GPS is that it works *without* a data connection. The other options are related to the benefits, but not the *reason* why it's better than a dedicated GPS device:

*   **B: Keydinta lacagta (Saving money)** is a benefit, but not the core reason.
*   **C: Ka fogaanshaha kirada (Avoiding rentals)** is a benefit, but not the core reason.
*   **D: U baahnan la’aanta inaad iibsato khariidadaha cusub (No need to buy new maps)** is also a benefit, but again, not the reason the app is *better* than a dedicated device.

The main reason it's an advantage is the independence from a data network – a dedicated GPS device doesn't have this limitation.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sidee ku dammaanad qaadi kartaa in lagu waafajiyo markab ku habboon?","The correct answer is **C: Iskadiiwaangalinta wakiilka ku takhasusay safarka ee Galapagos (Registering with a specialized Galapagos travel agent)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Iska hubi in aad hesho qof matale fican kaas oo qibrad iyo aqoon u leh jaziirada Galapagos inuu kuu jaro marakiibta kala duwan."" (Make sure you get a good representative who has knowledge and experience of the Galapagos Islands to arrange your vessel.)  This directly points to using a specialized travel agent as the key to finding a suitable boat.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Isku-dubbarida diiwaangalinta koox ka kooban 8+ rakaab ah oo leh dano isku mid ah (Registering a group of 8+ passengers with similar interests):** While group registration *can* be a factor, it's not the primary way to ensure a boat is suitable for *you* individually.
*   **B: Isdiiiwaangalinta wakhtiga jawigu uu fiican yahay (Registering when the weather is good):** Weather is a factor for sailing, but it doesn't influence the suitability of the boat itself.
*   **D: Isdiiwaangalinta wakhti hore (Registering in advance):**  Advance registration is generally a good idea, but it doesn't guarantee the boat is the *right* fit.

Therefore, using a travel agent with Galapagos expertise is the most direct and reliable way to find a suitable boat.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee kuwan soo socda aan loo isticmaalin xeelad ahaan xeeladaas oo ka caawinaayso inaad ku reebtid o martida dheelitaanka khamaarka?","The correct answer is **B: Dhiirigelinta sida tigidhada riwaayadaha bilaashka ah (Encouraging with free tickets to shows)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how casinos use various strategies to keep guests engaged and spending money (expensive meals, drinks, entertainment, etc.).  The core theme is that these casinos *want* people to gamble.

Let's look at why the other options are *not* tactics to discourage gambling:

* **A: Iftiinka dabiiciga ah oo badan (Lots of natural light):**  More natural light can make a space feel less enclosed and potentially less stimulating for gambling. This *could* be used to subtly discourage prolonged stays.
* **C: Cabbitaannada bilaashka ah (Free drinks):** This is explicitly mentioned as a tactic casinos use to keep people gambling and feeling good.
* **D: Maqnaanshaha saacadaha (Lack of clocks):** This is a common casino tactic to make people lose track of time, which encourages longer gambling sessions.

Therefore, the only option that doesn't align with the casino's strategy of encouraging gambling is offering free tickets to shows. This is a form of entertainment, but doesn't directly influence the gambling itself. It's a distraction, not a deterrent.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxyaabaha qofka khamaarka ku takhasusay aay tahay inuu iska ilaaliyo?","The correct answer is **A: Cabitaanka khamriga badan (Drinking too much alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that gamblers often use alcohol, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in a good mood and to entice them. However, it concludes by saying that all gamblers know the benefit of sobriety. Therefore, a gambler should avoid excessive alcohol consumption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aqbalaadda shaqa walbo oo bilaash ah oo dhiirigelin lagu qabto (Accepting any free work or incentives):** While a gambler might be tempted by freebies, the passage doesn't explicitly warn against accepting them.
* **C: Hubinta saacadaha aan la qaadi karin ama saacadaha gacanta (Checking watches or wristwatches):** The passage doesn't mention anything about timekeeping being a concern for gamblers.
* **D: Weydiinaayo meesha ugu dhow ee laga baxo (Asking where the nearest exit is):** Asking for the exit doesn't directly relate to avoiding negative aspects of gambling, according to the passage.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa qaybtee qaybta hadalka ee lagu qoray xarfaha waaweyn jumlada dhexdeeda?","The correct answer is **D: Fal-kabyada (Verbs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that using a capital letter for words like ""Sie"" (and others) helps distinguish verbs from nouns or adjectives. Verbs are action words, and capitalization helps readers quickly identify them. Options A, B, and C describe the functions of nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, respectively, not verbs.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa u qoritaanka Magacyada erayada, goobaha iyo dadka ka dhigi kara mid adag?","The correct answer is **A: Akhriska (Reading)**.

The passage states: ""Waxay sidoo kale qaab laga doodi karo u fududeynaysaa akhriska..."" which translates to ""It can also be argued that it facilitates reading...""

Therefore, capitalizing nouns can make reading easier. The other options are not directly supported by the passage.
"
"""Qaybaha miyiga ee Malaysiya, tilmaantee la isticmaala si loo tilmaamo """"kaalay""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Leexitaanka farta muruubsatada ama murdisada**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sidoo kale, safareey Ingiriis oo Spain ku sugan ayaa ku qaldami karo gacanta loogu haadinaayo macasalaamo oo gacanta kusoo jeedo qofka haadinaayo (inta ay ku jeedi lahayd qofka loo haadinaayo) uu na u fahmo in logu yeerayo inuu soo noqdo."" This translates to: ""Also, an English traveler in Spain might mistakenly think that a hand gesture of greeting and a hand gesture towards the person greeting them (as if to invite them to come) means they are being invited to return."" And then it connects this to the Malaysian custom: ""...Maleysiyaanka, meelaha miyiga dagan, waxa ay ula macno tahay """"Kaalay imanow,"""" si lamida haba ahaate, gacan taagu waa ishaaro saaxiibtinimo oo la macno ah """"marxabba""""..."" which means ""...Malaysians, in rural areas, it means ""Come here,"" similarly, a hand gesture is a friendly gesture that means ""hello""..."".  The text then mentions the rural areas using ""leexitaanka farta muruubsatada ama murdisada"" (bending the tips of the fingers) to mean ""Come here"".

Therefore, option A is the only one supported by the text.
"
"""Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca tilmaantee macnaheedu noqon karaa """"soo noqo""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Luxitaanka ama haaditaanka calaacasha oo xagga gudaha uu ka sii jeedo.**

The passage states that in Malaysia, the gesture of turning the palm inwards, similar to a welcoming gesture in the West, actually means ""Come here."" The passage also mentions that this gesture can be misinterpreted as ""Come back"" by people from Western countries. Therefore, the inward-facing palm gesture signifying ""come back"" is the one described in option C.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa sababa dildilaaca?","The correct answer is **B: Barafka aan xasilloonayn ama aan daganayn (Unstable or unsettled ice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baraf-cagaarku ma xasiloona, laakiin buurta ayuu hoos uga soo qulqula. Tani waxay sababi kartaa dildilaacyo..."" (The ice is not stable, but the mountain is cracking. This can cause surges...).  The instability of the ice is the direct cause of the surges.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Barafka buundooyinka (Ice bridges):** While ice bridges can be part of the overall ice structure, the primary cause of the surges is the instability of the ice itself, not specifically the bridges.
* **C: Dumitaanka godadka barafka ah (Ice cave collapse):**  While cave collapses *could* contribute to surges, the passage focuses on the general instability of the ice mass.
* **D: Baloogyada ama Bulukeetiyada aadka aan isku haysanin (Highly mismatched bulges or domes):** This is a more specific type of instability, but the passage's general statement about the ice not being stable encompasses this.

Therefore, the most accurate and direct answer based on the passage is that the instability of the ice is what causes the surges.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kuwan Kee baa lagu qarin karaa barafka buundooyinka?","The correct answer is **A: dildilaaca (ice fractures/cracks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ice fractures and cracks can hide the ice bridges. The other options aren't directly mentioned as things that would hide the ice bridges *on the surface*.

* **B: Godadka barafka ah (Ice caves)** are formations *underneath* the ice.
* **C: Darbiyada (Ice shelves)** are large extensions of ice.
* **D: Baloogyada ama bulukeetiyada waaweyn (Large bulges or mounds)** are not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the passage directly links **dildilaaca (ice fractures)** to the potential for hiding the ice bridges.
"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan marinka, socotada waa in ay qaataan taxadar dheeraad ah ka hor inta aysan booqan goobtee?","The correct answer is **C: Bartamaha magaalada**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that in 2002, lava flows from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed much of Goma, particularly the city center.  It also mentions the need to investigate travel to Goma due to the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region. Therefore, the city center is a place where travelers should exercise extra caution.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Foolkaannada Nyiragongo** While the volcano is a significant factor, the text focuses on the *impact* on Goma and the city center.
*   **B: Degaanada ku hareeraysan Goma**  The text doesn't specifically mention extra caution needed in the surrounding areas.
*   **D: Rwanda** Rwanda is a separate country and not directly related to the caution needed *within* Goma.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan talo fiican u noqon doonin dalxiiska Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagaallada ka socda Waqooyiga Kivu waa kuwo aad u xiiso badan (The conflicts in North Kivu are very interesting).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly warns about the security situation.** It states that travel to Goma requires research into the conflict situation in North Kivu. It doesn't portray the conflicts as ""interesting.""
* **Options B, C, and D are all mentioned as aspects of Goma.** The passage mentions mountain gorilla tracking, the availability of boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis), and the location of the Nyiragongo volcano.

Therefore, suggesting that the conflicts are ""interesting"" is the *least* helpful and most misleading advice for someone planning a trip to Goma, given the information in the passage."
Goorma ayaa la heli karaa ogolaanshaha dhulka miyiga ah ee aan la deganayn ee maalinta bilawga ah ee Ogoosto?,"The correct answer is **C: 1-da May**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Beemidka waxaa lagu xadiday inuu ilaaliyo karyonka, waxaana la helaa maalinta 1aad ee bisha, afar bilood ayaanu jiraa. Markaas, ogolaansho miyi u bixiseed kasta oo maalin bilow kasta oo bisha May ah wuxu diyaar noqonayaa 1 da Janaayo.""

This means permits for May are available on the 1st of January.  Since the question asks about August, and permits are issued on the 1st of the month, permits for August would be available on **May 1st**.
"
Waa maxay siyaasadda loo dejiyay si loo ilaaliyo dhulka dhagaxa ee canyonka?,"The correct answer is **D: Tiro xaddidan ee oggolaanshaha ah**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Boosaska meelaha ugu caansan...intabadan waxaa buuxiya codsiyada la helo taarikhda ugu horeyso oo loo furo kireysiga."" This indicates a limited number of permits are available.
* It also mentions ""ogolaansho kooban oo xadidan oo loogu talagalay codsiyada dadka soo gala sida ay u kala horeeyaan.""  This reinforces the idea of limited permits.
* While options A and C touch on aspects of the permit process, they don't capture the core policy of limiting the *number* of permits available to protect the canyon's environment.
* Option B is incorrect because the permits are not available on January 1st, but are tied to the beginning of each month in May.



"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa lacala laga yaaba in laga helo hudheellada lagu tilmaamay tuduca?,"The correct answer is **C: Martida kale ee caanka ah ama la aqoonsan karo (Other famous or well-known guests)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Inkastoo gooni loo leeyahay, mar marka qaar waxa ay qaabilan madaxda iyo marti sharafyada soo booqanayo Safrayaasha wata lacago yar oo ku safraya aduunka waxa loo tix geliyaa iney wajihi karaan, lacagta oo ka go’da haddii ay tagaan hodheelo badan oo kuwan oo kale ah.""  This directly indicates that a potential source of money for the hotel is meeting famous or well-known guests.  The hotel's exclusivity and reputation make it a place where such guests would stay.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Baarka cabitaanka khamriga qasan (Hard liquor bar):** While bars contribute to revenue, the passage doesn't suggest they are a *source of money* in the way that famous guests are.
* **B: Maqaayad goobta ah oo laga helaayo cunto tayadeedu sareeyso (On-site restaurant with high-quality food):** Restaurants generate revenue, but the passage again emphasizes a *source of money* beyond just restaurant sales.
* **D: Qolal dhawaan la cusboonaysiiyay oo qaab casriyaysan loo sameeyay (Recently renovated rooms with a modern style):**  New rooms attract guests, but don't represent a *direct source of money* in the way meeting famous individuals would.
"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo xogta lagu soo bandhigay tuducda, midkee bixinta soo socda ayaa martida hoteeladu u badan tahay inay mudnaanta siiyaan?","Based on the provided text, the answer is **B: Makhaayad leh cunto kariye caan ah.**

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that these hotels historically catered to wealthy and famous individuals, and offered ""wacan"" (delicious) dinners and breakfasts. The mention of a ""cunto kariye caan ah"" (famous cook) directly aligns with the historical reputation for excellent dining.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Qalabka qadiimiga ah laga heli karo guriga oo dhan (Antique equipment available throughout the house):** While antiques were part of the charm, the text doesn't highlight them as a primary draw for the target clientele.
* **C: Qolka nasashada oo bixiya maaweelo haweenka la sameeyo (Relaxation room offering spa treatments for women):** Spa treatments aren't mentioned in the historical context described.
* **D: Qol Kiradiisa la awoodi karo (Affordable rental rooms):** The hotels historically catered to the wealthy, so affordability wouldn't have been a priority.

The text explicitly states: ""In Dembiga, and a general distrust of foreigners, is almost unknown in Greenland.

And it also says: **""The text explicitly states: ""In Dembiga, and a general distrust of foreigners, is almost unknown in Greenland. Even between settlements there are no """"dangerous spots.""""

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwan soo socda kee baa u badan inuu dhib ku hayo socotada aan diyaarga ahayn ee booqanaya Greenland?","The correct answer is **C: Cimilada**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""The cold climate may be the only real danger you will face. If you visit Greenland during the harsh times (as you head further north, the colder it gets), it is important for you to bring warm clothing.""
*   It also mentions the extreme daylight hours in summer can affect sleep, and that Nordic berries, while not painful, can cause discomfort.
*   The other options are incorrect: The text says Greenland has low crime and the locals aren't generally hostile. While the text mentions that guests can have difficulty sleeping, it doesn't directly link it to an unprepared journey.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa hadda loo isticmaalaa sidii central plaza?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hadda waxay u shaqeyneysa sida xarunta bartamaha..."" which translates to ""Now it functions as a central plaza...""  The Jardín de la Unión is the name of the plaza.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa kuwan soo socda aan laga helin Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: gazebo-ga dhexe ee leh bandhig faneed lagu qabto fagaaraha**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions ""goobo mada daalo ee tiyaatar yaraha bartamaha"" (central plaza with shaded areas for small theaters) in the garden, but it **doesn't** mention a gazebo with art exhibitions.
* The text **does** mention ""dhowr maqaayad oo ku hareereysan beerta"" (several restaurants surrounding the garden).
* The text **does** mention ""Callejon del Beso (Alley of the Kiss)"" and the romantic legend associated with it.
* The text mentions that the building itself is a well-preserved example of 17th-century architecture, implying it's not a ""machadka aadka u da’ada weyn"" (very large academy).

"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo tuducda, keebaa bayaanadan soo socda ee ku saabsan socod maalmeedka loo qaadan karaa inuu yahay mid khalad ah?","The correct answer is **D: Socod maalmeedku maaha hawl ku habboon bannaanka qoysaska oo aay carruurta ku suganyihiin**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Qoysaska leh caruur yar yar waxay u bahan yahiin iney sameeyaan diyaar garow, lakin shaqada maalin laha way fududa tahay xitaa caruur aad ka u yar yar iyo caruurta iskuul dhigata."" (Families with young children need to prepare, but the day hike is easy even for very young children and school-aged children.) This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Diyaargarow yar ayaa loo baahan yahay socodka maalinta ee lagu soconaayo waddooyinka aan dheerayn ee gaaban:** The text says ""Socdaalka maalinta ee waddo sahlan la qaadayo diyaar garaw yar buu u baahan yahay..."" (Day hikes on easy trails require little preparation...)
* **B: Masaafada way kala duwan tahay laakiin waxaa loogu talagalay in lagu dhameeyo muddada hal maalin ah oo kali ah:** The text states ""waxaa loogu talagalay in lagu dhameeyo muddada hal maalin ah oo kali ah"" (it is intended to be completed within a single day).
* **C: Dadka leh heerka dhexdhexaadka ah oo taam ahaanshaha ayaa guud ahaan awood u leh inay ku raaxaystaan ​​hawshan:** The text says ""Dadka leh heerka dhexdhexaadka ah oo taam ahaanshaha ayaa guud ahaan awood u leh inay ku raaxaystaan ​​hawshan"" (People with moderate fitness are generally able to enjoy the activity).



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayuu socod maalmeedku u baahan yahay diyaargarow aad u yar?","The correct answer is **B: Marka lagu socdalaayo wado sahlan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Socdaalka maalinta ee waddo sahlan la qaadayo diyaar garaw yar buu u baahan yahay..."" (Day hikes on easy trails require little preparation...). This directly corresponds to option B.
"
Maxay kaga duwan tahay dhulalka fidsan ee Rogaland ama Agder marka lala barbar dhigo Norway inteeda kale?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxay leeyihiin geedo** (They have meadows).

Here's why:

* The passage describes the Norwegian landscape as having ""vidde,"" which is open, treeless land. 
* Rogaland and Agder are specifically mentioned as having ""hei,"" which is a treeless heath covered in heather.
* Options B, C, and D are not mentioned or implied in the passage as differentiating Rogaland and Agder from the rest of Norway. While fjords are common in Norway, the passage doesn't link their presence or absence to Rogaland and Agder's treeless landscape. The passage doesn't specify whether the land is flat or not, and it doesn't mention any significant amount of ""kuleyl"" (heat) in these regions.

Therefore, the key difference highlighted is the presence of meadows (""geedo"") in Rogaland and Agder's ""hei"" landscape.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ayaan ahayn kuwan soo socda wax aan caadi ka ah Norway?","The correct answer is **B: Dhulka fidsan ee leh dhirta aadka u badan (Land with very dense forests)**.

Here's why:

The text describes Norway as having wide, open landscapes (""vidde"") with few trees. Options A, C, and D all align with this description. Option B, describing dense forests, is the opposite of what the text portrays as typical Norwegian scenery.
"
Goorma ayay tahay in dalxiisayaasha xiisaynaya ciyaarta barafka ee skiing-ka ay booqdaan saldhigyada buuraha?,"The correct answer is **A: Xilliga jiilaalka (Winter)**.

The passage states: ""...bosteeojoyin badan waxay heelan tiro caafirmad xiliga barafka iyo ku deeqid shaqooyin sida ciyaaraha baraf ka. **Xilliga jiilaalka**"" (Many resorts offer winter sports and employment opportunities like skiing. **Winter**).
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayaa inta badan dalxiisayaasha ugu badan yihiin saldhigyada buuraha?","The correct answer is **C: Xilliga xagaaga Hindiya**.

The text explicitly states: ""Xilli dalxiiska istaamada buuruhu waxa uu heerka ugu sarreeya gaaraa inta badan inta lagu jiro **xagaaga Hindiya**."" (The peak tourist season for mountain stations is usually during the **summer in India**.)
"
Maxaa loo baahanyahay inaad ka fogaataa inaad samayso haddii aad rajaynayso inaad hesho doon taas oo raadinaysa gargaar?,"The correct answer is **D: Iska indho tirka dadka agtaada lifti radiska ah**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes actively seeking out people, talking to them, and advertising your need for help. Option D is the opposite of that - it suggests avoiding interaction.  The passage implies that simply being present isn't enough; you need to actively engage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: In aad kor iyo hoos ugu bodboodo goobta doomaha aay kuso xirtaan:** While observing is part of the process, actively seeking interaction is more important.
* **B: La saaxibitaanka darawalada maraakiibta:** The passage suggests interacting with many people, not just captains.
* **C: Xayeysiinta adeegyadaada:**  The passage already suggests you are advertising your need for help.  ""Xayeysiinta adeegyadaada"" (advertising your services) isn't the core of what the passage is advocating.



"
Maxaad samayn kartaa marka aad ku sugantahay agagaarka marinas oo aad raadinayso doon u baahan caawimaad?,"The best answer is **A: Inaad lla xidhiidho badmaaxayaasha (Connect with the harbor masters)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Waxaad isku dayi doontaa inaad la xiriirto bad-maaxyada baarka jooga (You will try to contact the harbor masters who are at the bar)."" This is the most direct and logical step according to the provided information.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Inaad iska hoos toogtid saacada jihada (Time your own launch)** - This has nothing to do with finding a boat needing help.
* **C: Kaliya la xiriir dadka marka ay nadiifinayaan doonidooda (Only talk to people when they are cleaning their boats)** - While talking to people is encouraged, it's not specified as the *primary* action to take when looking for a boat needing assistance.
* **D: Iska ilaali kuwa lifti raadiska ah (Beware of those with search lifts)** - This is irrelevant and potentially misleading.



Therefore, connecting with the harbor masters is the most aligned action with the passage's advice.



"
Goobtee ayaa rafcaan u noqon doonta dalxiisyaasha xiisaynaya taariikhda gumeysiga jasiiradda?,"The correct answer is **A: Xeebta Waqooyi**.

The passage states: ""Halkani waa halkii gumeystayaashii Ingiriisku yeesheen markaas hadii aad raadinayso caddaynta raadkii gumeysiga ee dhulka, halkani waa meel ku fiican in laga bilaabo."" which translates to ""This is where the English colonizers held sway, so if you're looking for evidence of colonial legacies in the land, this is a good place to start.""  This refers to the North Shore.
"
Goobtee ayaa soo jiidan doonta dalxiiska mudnaanta siiya aragtiyaha cajiibka ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Victoria Harbor**.

The text explicitly states: ""Si aad u hesho muqaalka ugu wanaagsan Hong Kong, ka tag jasiirada oo tag kasoo horjeedka biyo shubadka Kowloon. Dhoolatuska dhismayaasha Hong Kong lasimay samada ayaa laga lulay iftiino widhwidhaya kuwaasi oo ay ka muuqato qaab biyood u eeg marsada figtooriya.""  This translates to: ""To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the opposite side of Kowloon harbor. The illumination of the skyscrapers of Hong Kong is reflected in the water in the shape of Victoria Harbour.""

Therefore, Victoria Harbor is highlighted as the place offering the most impressive view.
"
Maxay haystaan ​​qaar ka mid ah koorayaasha kuwaas oo ka caawinaya waxyaabaha yar ee khatarta ah in qofka fuushanaya qaybta uu saaranaayo cagtiisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Qaybaha la qabsado ee amaanka ah (Safety grip parts)**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically mentions that some saddles, especially English saddles, have a ""baardar badbaado"" (safety bar) that can catch anything falling off the rider. This safety bar is a type of ""qaybaha la qabsado ee amaanka ah"" (safety grip part).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kabo cidhiidhi ah (Thin padding):** While padding provides comfort, it doesn't directly prevent the rider's legs from getting trapped.
* **C: Qaybta cagsaarka oo maqaar ka samaysan (Leather stirrup parts):** Stirrups are made of leather, but the leather itself doesn't prevent entrapment; it's the overall design of the stirrup system.
* **D: Degenaansho aad u sareeysa (Very high stability):** Stability is a general benefit of a good saddle, but it doesn't directly address the specific risk of leg entrapment.



"
Waa kuwee sifada aay leeyihiin kabaha dadka darawalada ama wadayaasha ah ee ka caawiya badbaadada darawalka marka la isticmaalayo qaybta hoose ee cagsaarka?,"The correct answer is **A: Cagdhiga oo ah qallafsan oo cidhiidhi ah (Leather that is thick and strong)**.

The passage states that drivers typically wear thick, strong, and rough leather boots to provide protection. The leather acts as a barrier and helps prevent the feet from getting caught in the stirrups in case of an accident.
"
Maxaa la siiyaa socotada iyada oo loo marayo shabakadaha isweydaarsiga martigelinta?,"The correct answer is **A: Hoyga martida deegaanka** (Hospitality from locals).

The text explicitly states that Shabakada isku beddelka soo dhawayntu (Couchsurfing) ""ku xira dadka socdaalka ah dadka deggan magaalooyinka ay booqanayaan"" and that users are offered ""hooy bilaasha"" (free stays).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Duulimaadyo qiima jaban** (Cheap flights): The text doesn't mention anything about flights.
* **C: Dalxiisyada ay bixiyaan hagayaasha deegaanka** (Tourists paying for local guides): This describes a different type of tourism arrangement.
* **D: Xiriirinta dadka safarka ah ee doonayaa inay booqdaan goobaha isku meelka ah** (Connecting travelers who want to visit the same places): While Couchsurfing *does* connect travelers, the core benefit for the traveler is the free accommodation.
"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan marinka, weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan shabakadaha isweydaarsiga martigelinta aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **A: Socotada waxaa had iyo jeer la siiyaa tixraacyo loogu talagalay martigeliyaha maxalliga ah** (Travelers are always given references for local hosts).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Liis martigeliyayaasha diyaarka ah ay ku qoran yihiin ayaa lagu bixinayaa waraaq ahaan iyo/ama online ahaan, mararka qaarna waxa la socda qiimeyn ay ku sameeyeen dad kale."" (Lists of available hosts are provided in written and/or online form, sometimes with a review by other people.) This implies references are *sometimes* provided, not *always*.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the text:

* **B: Shabakadaha qaar ayaa laga yaabaa inay u baahdaan xaqiijin dheeraad ah ee dadka socotada ah** (Some networks may require additional verification of travelers). - The text explicitly says ""Shabakadaha qaar ayaa laga yaabaa inay u baahdaan xaqiijin dheeraad ah ee dadka socotada ah"" (Some networks may require additional verification of travelers).
* **C: Dadka safarka ah waxaa la siin doonaa liiska martida loo yahay ee laga heli karo magaalada lagu sii socdo** (Travelers will be given a list of available hosts in the city they are traveling to). - The text mentions ""Liis martigeliyayaasha diyaarka ah ay ku qoran yihiin..."" (Lists of available hosts are provided...).
* **D: Dib u eegista martigeliyaha maxaliga ah ayaa mararka qaarkood diyaar u ah socotada** (Review of the local host is sometimes available to travelers). - The text states ""...waxa la socda qiimeyn ay ku sameeyeen dad kale"" (...sometimes with a review by other people).

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* supported by the text is that travelers are *always* given references.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, marti noocee ah ayaa ugu yaraan laga yaabaa in qolka hostel-ka la wadaago?","The correct answer is **A: Martida wali kujira da’ada labaatanaadka (Guests in their twenties)**.

Here's why:

* The first sentence explicitly states: ""Hodheelada ayaa ugu horreeya dadka dhalinta yar - Marti caadi ah oo ku jirta labaataneyada..."" (Hostels are primarily for young people - ordinary guests in their twenties...).

While other options *could* be true, they are not the primary or most likely type of guest. The text emphasizes the 20-something demographic.
"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan marinka, yaa ugu badan inuu ku sii nagaado hostel-ka?","The best answer is **B: Saddex 22 jiryaal ah oo si wada jir u safraya.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hodheelada ayaa ugu horreeya dadka dhalinta yar - Marti caadi ah oo ku jirta labaataneyada..."" (Hostels are primarily for young people in their twenties...)
* **Option B aligns with this:** Three 22-year-olds traveling together fits the description of the hostel's primary clientele.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Lamaanaha la socdaalaya ilmo dhawaan dhashay:** While possible, the passage mentions families with young children are *rare*. 
* **C: Lamaane kujira da’ada 70 jirka ah:**  The passage focuses on younger travelers.
* **D: Laba qoys oo la socdaalaya ama la safraayo caruurtooda:**  The passage explicitly states that families with young children are *rare*, and only some hostels have private rooms for them.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, keebaa ka mid ah bayaanada soo socda oo si sax ah u qeexayaa ciyaarta wax tuuryeeska ee boomerang-ka?","The correct answer is **D: Kaliya boomerangs-ka qaar ayaa awood u leh inay soo laabtaan marka la tuuro.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Hadii aad rabto inaad barato tuurista boomarangi ku soo laabanaysa gacantaada, hubi inaad haysato boomarang ku habboon soo noqosho."" This implies not all boomerangs return.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The text doesn't guarantee a boomerang will *always* return, even if thrown correctly.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text mentions tourists are interested, but doesn't say it's more popular with locals.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The text mentions boomerangs from Australia don't return, suggesting there *are* non-returning boomerangs available.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda inta badan loo isticmaalo cunnada Javanese-ka?,"The correct answer is **C: Sonkorta qumbaha**.

The text explicitly states that ""sonkorta qumbaha Javanese (Javanese palm sugar)"" is one of the popular flavorings in Javanese cuisine. 

The other options are not mentioned in the text."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sidee buu cudurada faafa aay u faafaan?","The correct answer is **A: Dadka uu cudurka ku dhacay (People who have the disease)**.

The text states: ""Cudur faafa waa cudur si hawl yar la isugu gudbin karo hadii aad u dhawaato agagaarka qof sadhaysan."" (A contagious disease is a disease that can be easily transmitted if you come into close contact with a sick person.)

This directly indicates that contagious diseases spread from infected individuals.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa aan la aqoon inuu keeno cudurada faafa?","The correct answer is **B: Fayrasyada (Viruses)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Cudur caabuqeed waa mid uu keenay jeermis-side sida fayras, bakteeriyo, fangas, ama dulin kale."" which translates to ""An infectious disease is caused by germ-like things such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or the opposite.""

While viruses are mentioned as *one* of the potential causes, the question asks *what* causes contagious diseases. The options provided offer potential causes.  The text lists viruses as a cause, and the other options (bacteria, fungi) are also listed. However, the best answer, based on the context provided, is **Fayrasyada (Viruses)** because the text begins with viruses in the list.

Xaaladee ayey ka doorashada nidaamka galitaanka shabakada laga dooranaayo VPN-ka shakhsiyeed aay kala filnaani doontaa isticmaalaha?,"The best answer is **B: Isticmaaluhu wuxuu ka walaacsan yahay ka fogaanshaha inay baxaan xogyaha muhiimka ah iyo basaasnimada intii suurtagal ah.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt highlights the core benefits of a personal VPN:**  It emphasizes that Bixinta VPN-ka shakhsi ah (Bixinta VPN-ka shakhsi ah) protects *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP. It also mentions better speeds and harder tracking. These benefits directly address the user's concern about data privacy and security.
* **Option A is too broad:** While reconfiguring all internet data *could* be a factor, it's not the primary motivation for choosing a VPN.
* **Option C is limited:**  Focusing solely on HTTP traffic ignores the fact that modern websites use HTTPS, and a VPN protects both.
* **Option D is not directly supported:** While a ""neutral"" and high-speed connection is a plus, it's secondary to the security and privacy VPNs offer.  The prompt doesn't directly support the idea that a user's primary need is neutral and fast data transmission.

Therefore, the core driver for choosing a personal VPN, as described in the prompt, is protecting sensitive data and avoiding surveillance.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa bayaanadan soo socda ee ku saabsan VPN-yada iyo wakiillada shabakadda aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **B: Wakiilada shabakada ma celin karaan dhammaan xogaha taraafikada shabakada (Network proxies cannot encrypt all network traffic)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states Bixinta VPN-yada (Bixinta VPN-yada) dib u jiheeyaa dhammaan saxmadda internetka, keliya maaha http (encrypts all internet traffic, not just HTTP).** This directly contradicts option B.
* The prompt also states VPN-yadu waxay xaffidan yihiin markaas way adag tahay in la basaaso (VPNs are secure and difficult to trace).
* **The prompt states that VPNs usually offer higher bandwidth and better service than network proxies.** This supports option A.
* **The prompt states that VPNs are harder to trace than network proxies.** This contradicts option C.
* **The prompt states that VPNs encrypt all traffic, not just HTTP.** This contradicts option D.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that aligns with the information provided in the prompt."
Maxaa u ogolaanaya qof inuu isticmaalo shirkad telefoon meel ka baxsan aagooda ugu dhow?,"The correct answer is **B: Nambarada telefoonada caalamiga ah (International phone numbers)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Inta badan, waa inaad u iibsataa lambar caalami si gaara kaasoo ogolaanaya in taleefanada PSTN ku soo wacaan.""  This directly links international phone numbers to the ability to use a phone company outside of your local area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nidaamka sida otomatigada ah kaga jawaabo wicitaanada (Automatic call answering systems):** While these systems exist, they don't allow you to use a phone company in a different location.
*   **C: Dayax gacmeedyada (Cell phones):** Cell phones *can* be used outside of your local area, but the passage focuses on the *mechanism* that enables this – specifically, international numbers.
*   **D: Telefoonnada PSTN (PSTN phones):** The passage explains that international numbers are *needed* to connect PSTN phones to calls originating from outside your local area. The PSTN itself doesn't enable this.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa loo baahan karaa in la sameeyo si loo qabto wicitaanada qaarkood?","The correct answer is **A: Iibso lambarka caalamiga ah (Buy an international number)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Inta badan, waa inaad u iibsataa lambar caalami si gaara kaasoo ogolaanaya in taleefanada PSTN ku soo wacaan."" (Most often, you need to buy an international number to specifically allow PSTN phones to call.)

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Isticmaal shirkad telefoon oo maxalli ah (Use a local phone company):** The passage says you *don't* need to use a local phone company, especially when traveling.
* **C: Ka hel lambarka beesha deegaankaaga (Get a local community number):** The passage explicitly states that you *don't* need a local community number.
* **D: Iibso taleefanka PSTN (Buy a PSTN phone):** The passage doesn't mention needing to buy a PSTN phone. It talks about calls *to* PSTN phones.

Kuwa soo socda keebaa aan si sax ah u qeexin ku dhawaaqida erayada Talyaaniga?,"The correct answer is **A: r la labajibbaaray waxaa loogu dhawaqaa si ka duwan hal r** (rr is pronounced differently than a single r).

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states:** ""...halka caro waxaa la micno tahay qaali, halka carro ay la micno tahay gariga faraska lagu xiro."" This demonstrates that *r* and *rr* have different pronunciations.
* **Option A directly contradicts this.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Inta badan erayada waxaa loogu dhawaaqaa sida loo qoro:**  While generally true, it's not *always* true. Italian has many exceptions to the rules of pronunciation.
* **C: Erayada xarfaha c iyo g waxay noqon karaan kuwo aad u adag:** The prompt says the pronunciation of C and G follows the letter's sound, which implies they *aren't* inherently difficult.
* **D: Ku dhawaaqida erayada badidood way kala duwan yihiin iyadoo ku xidhan shaqalka soo socda:** The prompt highlights this very point. The pronunciation of words *does* change based on the following letter.

Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't align with the information provided in the question.

Midkee ka mid ah sifooyinka soo socda ee Izmir ee uu asal ahaan uu lahaani jiray kahor Maalmaha casriga ah ee hada la joogo?,"The correct answer is **D: Saqafyo-casaan ah oo dhisan**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...wadooyin ka waaweyn ee magaalada, albaabada dhismayaashu waa muraayad **iyo xarumo tukaamo casri ah iyagoo lagu saleeyey habka qadiimiga ah midab cas ee jiingada sare**..."" This indicates that the red roofs (saqafyo-casaan) are a characteristic of Izmir from its earlier history.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan sax ahayn oo ku saabsan dabeecadda Izmir?,"The answer is **B: Jawigu wuxuu xasuusin u yahay Turkiga hore.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Izmir has a modern, developed feel and a **Turkey-specific culture**, but *not* a feeling reminiscent of ""old Turkey."" It highlights its modern architecture and amenities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Magaaladu waxay ku hareeraysan tahay xeebta aadka u ballaaran:** The text mentions Izmir is located on the sea and has a coastal location.
* **C: Waxaad ka heli kartaa xarumaha wax iibsiga oo casri ah iyo kaniisadaha aadka u da’ada weyn:** The text specifically states modern shopping centers and mentions mosques and churches.
* **D: Waxay leedahay dekedda labaad ee ugu weyn Turkiga:** This is directly stated in the text.



"
Erayga xanami waxa loola jeedaa eegitaaka waxee?,"The correct answer is **A: Ubaxa cherry-ga**.

The text explicitly states: ""Daawadashada ubax bixinta geedka cherry ee loo yaqaano **hanami**, waa mid kamida dhaqamada Jabaaniiska...""  It then goes on to describe the history and tradition surrounding hanami, which is the viewing of cherry blossoms.
"
Yaa martigeliyay xafladihii ugu horreeyay ee loogu talagalay daawashada ubaxyada cherry-ga?,"The correct answer is **C: Boqorka Japan**.

The passage states: ""Jabaan, markii ugu horeysay xafladaha ubax dilaac ee cherry waxaa qaban jiray boqorka oo kaliya iyo xubnaha kale ee reer boqortoyo ee ku harereysan boqortoyada."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held only by the emperor and other members of the imperial family residing in the kingdom.""
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah waxyaabaha soo socda ee ku saabsan Jerusalem ayaa ugu yaraan laga yabaa inay soo jiidato dalxiiska?","The correct answer is **D: Goobaha badan ee taariikhda ah ee aay leedahay**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Jerusalem "" ayaa leh goobo badan taarikhi ah, qadiimi, iyo dhaqameed"" (has many historical, ancient, and cultural sites).
* While options A, B, and C are also mentioned, the passage emphasizes the *quantity* of historical sites as a significant draw for tourists.  The mention of religious importance and cultural aspects supports the historical sites.

Therefore, option D is the most directly supported and prominent reason for Jerusalem's tourism appeal according to the text.
"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa lagu sheegin tuduca isaga oo ah wax aay wax Jerusalem caan aay ku tahay oo lagu yaqaano?,"The correct answer is **C: Muhiimadeeda diineed**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Jerusalem ""barako u leedahay saddexda diimood ee hal Ilaah leh – Tawaraadda, Kiristaanka iyo Islaamka, waxaanay u tahay xaruntooda diimeed, caaqiideed iyo dhaqan."" It also mentions its ""muhiimadeeda diimeed ee wayn.""

While the passage mentions history, cultural sites, and tourism, its *primary* focus in the provided text is Jerusalem's religious significance.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa kuwee nooca socotada ah ee aan ka faa'iidaysan doonin iibsashada Kaarka lagu ciyaaro?","The correct answer is **D: Socotada qorsheynaya inuu booqdo Beerta Qaranka ee Kruger iyo ugu yaraan hal beer oo kale.**

Here's why:

The text states that a Wild Card can be beneficial for people who want to visit *some or all* of the South African National Parks (SANParks). Option D is the only one that indicates a visitor plans to visit more than one park. Options A and B are acceptable as they include Kruger, and option C is about budget, not the *type* of visit.
"
Bayaankee ayan si sax ah u qeexaynin Beerta Qaranka ee Kruger?,"The correct answer is **C: Waa mida ugu yar beeraha Qaranka wadanka Koonfur Afrika.**

The text clearly states: ""Barxadu waxay ku fadhidaa 19,500 km² waxaana u qaysantahay 14 deegaan oo kala duwan..."" This indicates the park is quite large, not small. Option C is the opposite of what the text says.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxaa loo tixgaliyaa in aay tahay goobta ugu so jiidashada badan wadanka Koonfur Afrika:** The text doesn't mention the park being the most popular. It just states it's one of the best.
* **B: Duurjoogta way ku kala duwan yihiin xadiiqadaha badan ee aay leedahay beerta:** The text says the park is divided into 14 different *deegaan* (regions), not *xadiiqadaha* (parks). It then goes on to say each region has different wildlife, which is true.
* **D: Waa ay ku heli karaan booqdayaasha iyaga oo iibsanaayo kaarka iibsashada kaarka lagu ciyaaro:** This is directly supported by the text: ""Waxa laga yaabaa inay qofka faa’iido u leedahay inuu iibsado Wild Card, kaasoo ogolaada barxadaha Koonfur Afrika qaarkood ama dhammaantoodba""
"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa ay u badantahay in ay khatar ku tahay dadka fuulaaya meelaha ku yaalla meelaha dhaadheer ee buurta?,"The correct answer is **A: Marka lagu jiro xaaladaha qoyaanka (When it is raining)**.

The passage specifically states: ""Waxaa qaybta kore ku ag yaalo god oo laazim ah in la dhex maro, way gaaban tahay waa na cariiri. **Filo in aad isdejiso aadna talaab talaab u marto nidaamka, gaarna marka ay qoyaan noqoto waxaa laga yaabaa iney noqoto qatar sida ugu dhaqsaha badan.**""

This translates to: ""There is a section near the top that must be passed through, it is short, it is a climb. **Expect to take your time and carefully traverse the system, especially when it is raining, it may become a quick danger.**""

Therefore, rain makes the steep sections more dangerous. The other options are less directly stated as primary dangers in the passage.
"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah uga tarjumeynin kor u kaca buurta Machu Picchu ee lagu tilmaamay tuduca?,"The correct answer is **B: Ma jiraan biraha fuulitaanka loo isticmaalo dhamaan qaybta sare ee buurta (There are no iron railings used in all parts of the upper mountain).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Jaranjarooyinka dhagaxa ka samaysan waxa sidoo kale la dhigaa waddada inteeda badan, meelaha jiirta dheer lehna xadhko ayaa taageero ahaan u yaal."" (Stone staircases are also laid along most of the path, and ropes are used as support in the longer sections.)  This indicates that stone staircases and ropes *are* present in many parts.
* The passage also mentions a ""god oo laazim ah in la dhex maro, way gaaban tahay waa na cariiri"" (a must-pass hole, it is short, it is a climb). This implies a challenging section, but not necessarily a lack of railings.
* Options A, C, and D are all consistent with the descriptions of the climb in the passage.

Therefore, the statement that there are no railings in *all* parts of the upper mountain is the most inaccurate translation of the passage.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ayaan ahayn cuntada ugu muhiimsan ee cunnada Majorcan-ka?","The correct answer is **A: Hilibka**

Here's why:

The text states that Majorcan cuisine is based on ""rooti, qudrad iyo hilib"" (bread, fruit, and meat), but then emphasizes the importance of bread, fruit, and *especially* seafood.  The example dish, Pa amb Oli, highlights bread, olive oil, and toppings like cheese and tuna (seafood).

While meat is *part* of the cuisine, the text implies that bread, fruit, and seafood are more central and defining elements. Therefore, meat isn't the *most* important.
"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan macluumaadka ku jira tuduca, bayaankee ku saabsan cuntooyinka hangi-ga oo aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **C: Cuntooyinka duban waxaa badanaa lagu kariyaa hangi-ga**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Foorno (hangi) waxaa badanaa loo adeegsadaa karinta qaab casho soolidda soo jireenka ah."" This directly translates to ""Hangi (earth oven) is often used for cooking traditional stew.""
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** The text says hot rocks from volcanic eruptions are *used* to heat the oven, but doesn't say that *all* hangi ovens use them.
    * **B:** The text mentions that hangi ovens can be found in Wellington, but doesn't say they *are exclusively* found there.
    * **D:** The text states that geothermal energy from the steam is used in places like Rotorua, but doesn't say that *all* geothermal energy is used for hangi ovens.



"
Kuwan soo socdo midkee aan loo xusin inuu yahay qaab qaas ah oo la isticmaalo si lo kululeeyo godka hangi-ga?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaaska (Gas)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions:

* **Dhagxanta kulul (Hot rocks):** Heated by lava or geothermal vents.
* **Kulaylka tamarta dhulka (Geothermal energy):** Natural steam venting from the earth.

While gas *could* potentially be used to heat a cooking pit, it's not mentioned as a traditional or primary method described in the passage. The passage focuses on naturally occurring heat sources.
"
Maxaa sababi kara aqoonsiga gaarka ah oo laga helo wadaadka ama haweenayda dhowrsoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Xidhashada duub xijaabka jirka daboolaaya kaas oo dhalaalaya (Wearing a full-body covering hijab that drapes)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes the expectation for women to cover their bodies, including their heads and chests, when visiting a temple. 
* Option A directly aligns with this description of a full-body covering, specifically a hijab that drapes.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Asturitaanka garbahaaga (Covering your chest)** - While the passage mentions covering the chest, it doesn't imply that covering *only* the chest leads to special recognition.
* **C: Soo amaahashada duubka xijaabka ah ee keniisadda (Renting a hijab in the church)** - Renting a hijab doesn't inherently create special recognition.
* **D: Xirashada goonnada ku go’a qaybta ka sarreysa jilibka (Wearing a scarf that drapes over the upper part of the chest)** - While a scarf is mentioned, the emphasis is on a full-body covering. A scarf covering just the upper chest wouldn't likely lead to the same level of special recognition described.



"
Midkee ka mid ah alaabtan dharka ah soo socota ee aan suurtogalka ahayn in la helo si looga soo amaahdo keniisada? ,"The correct answer is **D: Duubabka (Underwear)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Isla halkaa, raga ayaa la raba in ay xirtaan saraawilo daboolaya ilaa jilibka. Tani ayaa sidoo kale laga deynsan karaa alaabta taalo albaabka laakin dharkaas lama dhaqo markuu qof walbo siibo sidaa daratee na raaxo inaad dareemin baa laga yaabaa hadaad xiratid goonooyinkaas."" This refers to the requirement for men to wear long pants (similar to trousers) and mentions that underwear is something you could potentially get from a church, but it's not something you'd typically wear, and might be uncomfortable.

The passage directly says women *must* wear long skirts and cover their chests. It doesn't mention anything about men needing to wear anything other than long pants. Therefore, underwear isn't mentioned as a requirement and wouldn't be something you'd expect to be readily available or necessary to borrow.



"
Goorma ayuu booqde heli karaa fursadaha ugu badan ee uu ku daawado xiddigaha marka uu booqanayo goobaha Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Inta lagu jiro bilaha jiilaalka (During the polar night)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the polar night (when the sun doesn't rise) provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Australis (Southern Lights) because the sky is very dark.
* The polar night occurs during the winter months (jiilaalka) in the Antarctic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inta lagu jiro bilaha xagaaga (During the summer months):** The passage mentions the polar night as a key opportunity, not the summer months.
* **B: Marka goobtu aanu aadka u dad badanayn (When the place is not very crowded):** While a less crowded place is always a plus, the main reason for seeing stars is the darkness, which is specifically associated with the polar night.
* **D: Marka heerka wasakhowga iftiinka uu hooseeyo (When the light pollution level is low):**  Low light pollution is helpful, but the polar night provides the darkness needed regardless of light pollution levels.



"
Goorma ayuu talefanka dayax-gacmeedku noqon doonin beddelka talefanka gacanta?,"The best answer is **A: Haddii khadka aragga ee dayax-gacmeedka uu noqdo mid la hor istaagi karo (If the satellite line is unblockable)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the limitations of satellite phones.** It highlights that they aren't a direct replacement for mobile phones because they require being outside and appear as satellite phones.
* **The core problem is connectivity.** The passage states that the only option when mobile network coverage is lacking is satellite.  If the satellite connection becomes reliable and readily available (i.e., ""unblockable""), then the need for the satellite phone's unique requirements (being outside, appearing as a satellite phone) diminishes.  It would then be a more straightforward and practical communication device.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **B: Haddii goobtu aad u fog tahay (If the location is very remote):** Remote locations are *precisely* where satellite phones are *needed*. The passage establishes this point.
* **C: Haddii dibadda loo adeegsani ama isticmaali doono (If it will be used outdoors):**  The passage says satellite phones *require* being outdoors. This isn't a condition that would prevent them from becoming a replacement.
* **D: Haddii socdaalka hawsha u baahan yahay xog gaar ah (If the work trip requires special data):** While data is important, the passage primarily focuses on voice communication and the limitations of the satellite phone as a replacement for mobile phones in general.

Therefore, the reliability of the satellite connection is the key factor that would allow the satellite phone to become a true replacement for the mobile phone.



"
Goorma ayuu talefanka dayax-gacmeedka uu noqoni lahaa mid laga door bido talefanka gacanta?,"The best answer is **B: Inta lagu jiro safarka doomaha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the niche use case of satellite phones:** It explicitly states they are primarily for situations where mobile network coverage is unavailable, and satellite phones are the *only* option.
* **Safaris (safarka doomaha) often occur in remote locations:**  These locations are likely to have no mobile network coverage.  Therefore, a satellite phone becomes the essential communication tool.
* **Other options are less fitting:**
    * **A: Marka lagu dalxiisaayo gudaha magaalada:**  In cities, mobile networks are typically available.
    * **C: Marka xogta fogaanta aan loo baahnayn:** The passage implies satellite phones are *needed* for remote areas, regardless of the specific data requirements.
    * **D: Marka ay u badan tahay in aad haysato talefan gacanta kugu filan warbixin:**  The point of a satellite phone is to be a backup *when a mobile phone isn't sufficient*.



Therefore, the scenario where a satellite phone would be a preferable (or at least necessary) option is during a safari/remote travel.



"
Isku dhacyada soo socda kee baa horseeday abuuritaanka ama aasaaska Jamhuuriyadda Transnistria?,"The correct answer is **B: Qowmiyad**.

The text explicitly states that Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic and that ethnic conflicts led to the secession of Transnistria.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee Jamhuuriyadda Transnistria aay leedahay kaas oo ka duwan dhamaan Moldova inteeda kale?  ,"The correct answer is **C: Aqoonsiga Qaramada Midoobay**.

Here's why:

* **Luuqad:** While Romanian is the official language of Moldova, Russian is widely used in Transnistria, but it's not unique to Transnistria.
* **Diinta:** Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion in Moldova as a whole, and also in Transnistria.
* **Aqoonsiga Qaramada Midoobay:** This is the key difference. Transnistria is *not* recognized by the United Nations, while Moldova is.
* **Lacagta:** Transnistria has its own currency, which distinguishes it from Moldova's currency.

Therefore, the lack of UN recognition is the most significant distinguishing factor of Transnistria."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayay tahay in socotada booqda Montevideo haddii ay rajeynayaan oo aay doonayaan inay ka fogaadaan xaaladaha dabaysha?","The correct answer is **A: Inta lagu jiro bilaha jiilaalka ee nus-dhulka Waqooyiga**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Maadaama uu Montefidyo uu dhaco koonfurta dhul badhaha, waa xagaa halkaasi markay jiilaal tahay kala badh waqooyigu.""  This means when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo.
* **The question asks:** When should you visit to avoid stormy weather?
* **Therefore:** To avoid stormy weather (which is mentioned as a potential characteristic of Montevideo's winter), you should visit when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Inta lagu jiro xilliga abaarta ah ee Montevideo:** The text says there isn't a distinct ""dry"" or ""rainy"" season, so this is unlikely.
* **C: Inta lagu jiro bilaha xagaaga ee nus-dhulka Waqooyiga:** This would be summer in Montevideo, and the text mentions a potentially stormy winter there.
* **D: Inta lagu jiro xilliga jiilaalka ah ee Montevideo:** The text describes Montevideo's winter as potentially stormy.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayay tahay in socotada booqanayo Montevideo haddii ay qayb ka yihiin cimillada qabow?","The correct answer is **D: Marka ay jiilaalku tahay nus-dhulka Waqooyiga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maadaama uu Montefidyo uu dhaco koonfurta dhul badhaha, waa xagaa halkaasi markay jiilaal tahay kala badh waqooyigu."" (Because Montevideo is located in the southern hemisphere, it is summer there when it is winter in the northern hemisphere.)

Therefore, to experience a cold season in Montevideo, you would need to visit when it's winter in the northern hemisphere. That's option D.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, midka soo socda ayaa la xidhiidhi doona farshaxanka waxa sawirka oo la aasaasay, oo ka soo horjeeda burburinta?","The best answer is **A: Dhacdooyinka sawirada farshaxanka (Cultural events of photography)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage contrasts the negative perception of ""farshaxanada iyo xariijimaha aan loo baahnayn"" (unnecessary extravagance) with the existence of skillful cultural photography, cultural events, and ""legal"" artistic expressions.**
* **Option A directly refers to ""dhacdooyinka sawirada farshaxanka,"" which points to the positive aspects of photography within a cultural context.** This aligns with the passage's emphasis on the artistic and cultural value of photography, despite its sometimes negative associations.
* **The other options don't fit as well:**
    * **B: Loo qoraaya si aan taxadar lahayn (Written carelessly):** This is irrelevant to the core theme of photography and culture.
    * **C: Sawirro aan loo baahnayn oo ku yaal hantida dadweynaha (Unnecessary photos in public property):**  This focuses on a negative and controversial aspect, while the passage highlights positive cultural photography.
    * **D: Calaamadaha aan la aqoonsan karin (Unrecognizable signs):** This is too vague and doesn't relate to the subject matter.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and relevant answer, as it focuses on the positive aspects of photography and its role in cultural events, mirroring the passage's main point.



"
Waa maxay noocee xafladaha muusiga ayay ka-qaybgalayaasha qaarkood u haystaan ​​inay qayb muhiim ah ka yihiin waayo-aragnimada?,"The correct answer is **B: Wada joogitaanka goobta (Being at the venue)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Badiyaa inta joogta munasibadaha musikadu waxay go'aansadaan inay ku nastaan goobta, badiyaa ka qaybgaleyaashu waxay u tixgaliyaan inay tahay qayb muhiim ah oo khibrad laga helo."" (Many people attending musical events decide to be at the venue, and many participants consider it an important part of the experience.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Keenida caruurta yaryarka ah (Bringing young children):**  The passage mentions some venues have family-friendly events, but it doesn't say this is *why* people consider attending a key part of the experience.
* **C: Musiga socoto am shidan goor dambe oo habeenkii (Music continuing late into the night):** While this can be a part of the experience, the passage doesn't frame it as the *primary* reason people consider attending a key part of the experience.
* **D: So galitaanka xiliga hore (Arriving early):** Arriving early is a practical tip, but it's not what people consider a key part of the *experience* itself.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa la gudboon ka qaybqaataha xafladaha inay mudnaanta siiyaan haddii ay rabaan inay dagaan goobta u dhow muusigga?","The correct answer is **D: So galitaanka xiliga hore (Arriving early)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hadii aad dooneysid inaad u dhawaatid halka ay waxa ka dhacayaan, waa inaad waqti hore aad tagtid goob xeer dhigasho ee u dhaw muusikada."" (If you want to get closer to where the action is, you should go to the venue early.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Soo daahitaanka habeenkii (Staying up late)** - The passage mentions music continuing into the late night, but it doesn't say staying up late is a priority for getting a good spot.
* **B: La joogitaanka goobta xubnaha qoyska (Staying with family members)** - The passage mentions family-friendly events, but it doesn't link staying with family to getting a good spot for the music.
* **C: Goobta ka fog goobta xerada ah (Staying away from the central area)** - The passage advises getting *closer* to the music, not further away.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Halkee ayay tahay in booqdayaashu ay iska ilaaliyaan markay raadinayaan nolol cawaysnimo waqooyiga New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Baararka yar-yar magaalada (Small town bars)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...darawalada sarqaansan ayaa ku badan baararka magaalooyinka yar yar."" ( ...the number of drunk drivers is high in the small town bars.)

The other options are not directly mentioned as places to avoid for safety:

*   **A: Pueblos:** The text doesn't mention Pueblos in relation to safety concerns for tourists.
*   **C: Suuqyada (Markets):**  There's no mention of markets being unsafe.
*   **D: Goobaha lagu ciyaaro khamaarka (Casinos):** While the text mentions casinos, it doesn't specifically highlight them as risky locations for tourists, though it does mention that drunk drivers are prevalent in small town bars.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, halkee waaye halka booqduhu ay u badan tahay in uu ka helo madadaalo caan ah ee waqooyiga New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Goobta ciyaaraha ee u dhaw Sante Fe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe.** It states that ""dhowr ka mid ahna waxay keenaan magacyada madadaalada leh (inta badan kuwa waawayn eek u dhowdhow Albuquerque and Santa Fe)."" This directly points to the casinos near Santa Fe as a likely place for entertainment.
* **The passage highlights the casinos as a readily available option.**  It emphasizes that most casinos listed have alcohol and some have entertainment.
* **Options A and D are less likely.** While Albuquerque has a casino, the passage doesn't specifically recommend spending a long time there.  Options B (a remote pueblo) and D (small town bars) are less focused on entertainment and more on other aspects of the region, and not mentioned as the primary entertainment choice.



"
Safarrada ka taxadara miisaaniyada ayaa laga yaabaa inay rabaan inay iska ilaaliyaan nooca cabitaanka?,"The answer is **B: Biyo dhalada kujira (Natural spring water)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Biyaha qasabada ee deegaanku aad bay ugu habboon yihiin cabbitaanka, kuwa caagadahana si hawl yarbaa loo heli kara hadii aad baqdo."" This translates to: ""The natural spring waters of the region are very suitable for drinking, and bottled ones are hard to find if you need them.""  This implies natural spring water is a budget-friendly and readily available option.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Khamriga Australia (Australian beer):** The text mentions Australian beer is good for travel, but it doesn't explicitly say it's budget-friendly.
*   **C: Biirka deegaanka lagu sameeyo (Local brewed beer):** Similar to Australian beer, it's described as good for travel but not inherently budget-friendly.
*   **D: Casiirka ama cabitaanka miraha (Juice or fruit drinks):** The text says ""Cabbitaanka khudaarta ka samaysan waa heersare bisuu waa qaali"" which translates to ""Vegetable-based drinks are top-tier but are expensive."" This implies that juice and fruit drinks are also likely to be expensive.

Therefore, natural spring water is the most likely option for travelers watching their budget.

"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo aagga lagu sifeeyay tuducda, keebaa kamid ah dalabaadka soo socda ee cabitaanka ay u badan tahay inuu ku wareero kabalyeeriga?","The correct answer is **A: Madow mudadiisa gaabantahay**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions that an ""espresso"" is a ""short, black cup"". 
* The description of coffee in Australia highlights the prevalence of espresso-based drinks (espresso, cappuccino) and their typical presentation (short and black).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nambarka Koowaad (First One):** This refers to the most important national drink, which is described as a well-made and interesting fermented beverage, not necessarily black.
* **C: Khamriga Sauvignon Blanc oo ka yimid New Zealand (Sauvignon Blanc wine from New Zealand):** While New Zealand wines are mentioned as good for travel, Sauvignon Blanc isn't specifically highlighted.
* **D: Caddaan fidsan (Pale white):** This describes a color, but the text focuses on the *darkness* of espresso.



"
"Isaga oo qaatay mudo saddex qarni ah, kooxee baa bilaawday xilligii gumeysiga?","The correct answer is **D: Isbaanishka**.

The passage states: ""Dadka Spain ayaa bilaabay xiligii guumaysiga oo socday saddex qarni."" (The Spanish people started the colonial period which lasted three centuries.)
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay habka ugu wanaagsan ee lagu heli karo Parisian si uu kuugu diiriyo?","The correct answer is **C: Edeb u dhaqan (Behave politely/with good manners)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...the best way to get along in Paris, even if you aren't perfect, is to act like someone who is “bien élevé” (well-bred/have good manners). You will be well-received and it will be easy.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isku day inaad ku daydaan dabeecadda Parisian (Try to act like a Parisian):** The passage actually suggests the opposite. It says you shouldn't try to *be* Parisian, but rather emulate polite behavior.
*   **B: Soo saar kalsoonida (Project confidence):** While confidence can be helpful, the passage focuses on politeness and good manners as the key to being well-received.
*   **D: Muuji dabeecad qallafsan (Show a rough/unrefined demeanor):** The passage clearly advises *against* this approach.

Therefore, **Edeb u dhaqan** directly aligns with the passage's advice.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwan soo socda kee baa loo tixgalinayn tayada cakiran ee Parisians?","The correct answer is **D: Lama filaan ah oo inta badan aan fiicnayn (Being unexpected and often rude)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Parisians value being ""bien élevé"" (well-bred) – polite, refined, and having good manners.  It contrasts this with rudeness and a lack of refinement.  Therefore, being unexpected and often rude would be highly *disvalued* by Parisians, not respected.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

*   **A: Kibir (Arrogance):** While the passage mentions anonymity and a certain harshness, arrogance isn't directly identified as something *not* valued. It could be part of the overall ""canard"" (stereotype) the author is referring to.
*   **B: Edeb darnaan (Ill-manners):** This is the opposite of ""bien élevé,"" so it would be *disvalued*.
*   **C: Aad u ciyaar badan (Being overly playful):** This is less directly addressed but could fall under the category of a lack of seriousness or refinement, potentially being frowned upon.



"
Waa maxay faa'iidada Heerka Koowaad ee MetroRail ee Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: Ma aha sida dad badan** (It's not as crowded).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""MetroPlus way ka raaxo badan tahay kana buuq yar tahay..."".  This translates to ""MetroPlus is much more comfortable and quieter..."".  While the text mentions it's slightly more expensive, the key advantage highlighted is that it's less crowded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tabobaruhu waxa uu joogaa afaafka hore ee tareenka** (The train is located at the front of the train): The text mentions that MetroPlus cars are *always* at the back of the train, not the front.
* **C: Aad qaali uma ahaa iibsashada tigidhka heerka saddexaad** (The ticket for the third level was not very expensive): The text states that MetroPlus is *slightly* more expensive than the third level, not that the third level is cheap.
* **D: Waxay la mid tahay qiimaha tigidhka Metro** (It is the same price as a Metro ticket): The text explicitly says MetroPlus is *slightly* more expensive.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, muxuu haystaa tareen kasta oo dadka aay shaqada u raacan oo ku sugan Cape Town?","The correct answer is **B: Qiimaha tigidhada isku midka ah ee labada heer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...MetroPlus way ka raaxo badan tahay kana buuq yar tahay balsa xoogaa waa ka qaalisan tahay, in kastoo weli ay ka jaban tahay **tigidhada basaska Yurub**.""

This indicates that the ticket price is similar for both MetroPlus and Metro, though MetroPlus is slightly more expensive. Options A, C, and D are not supported by the information in the passage.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa ah cayayaan xayawaan ah aan laga yaabin inuu sameeyo?,"The correct answer is **A: Wuxuu keena ama uu sababaa inay finan kaso baxaan (It causes fleas to appear)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that unwanted animals *can* cause fleas, bites, spread disease, and cause electrical issues.  It doesn't mention that they cause fleas to appear. While fleas are often associated with pets and rodents, the passage doesn't link the unwanted animals to the *creation* of fleas. The other options are all things the passage explicitly says unwanted animals *can* do.
"
Xagee laga iibsan karaa kaadhadhka taleefoonada ee hore loo bixiyay?,"The most likely answer is **C: Koonaha Dukaamada (Shopping Malls)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes kiosks/shops selling these cards.**  Shopping malls are common places to find kiosks and small shops selling various goods, including phone cards.
* **The other options are less likely:**
    * **A: Wadamo gaar ah (Specific Countries):** While some cards might be country-specific, the text doesn't imply you need to travel to those countries to buy them.
    * **B: Saldhigyada tareenada (Train Stations):**  Train stations *might* have them, but malls are a more common and likely place.
    * **D: Telefoonada dadweynaha (Public Telephones):** This is incorrect. Public phones are *used* with the cards, not where you *buy* the cards.



Therefore, **C** is the best fit based on the information given."
Sidee loo helaa qiimaha wacitaanka ee kaadhadhka qaarkood?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxa kaliya oo laga isticmaali karaa dalal gaar ah (Only available in specific countries)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that some cards are specialized for cheap calls to specific countries.  This implies you need to be in or have access to those countries to find information on their calling rates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iyada oo loo marayo lambarro lacag-la'aan ah (Through toll-free numbers):** While the text mentions toll-free numbers for free calls, it doesn't say this is how you find the *cost* of specific cards.
* **C: Dukaanka geeska (At the corner store):** The text says the cards are sold in shops, but doesn't specify that you can find pricing information *only* there.
* **D: Adigoo isticmaalaya telefoonada dad waynaha oo bixinaya kharash dheeraad ah (Using public phones and paying extra):**  This is a completely unrelated and inaccurate approach. The text is about specialized calling cards.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Geedaha soo socda kee baa ku yar beerta qaranka ee Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **A: Geedka Beech-ka**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lagaha Plitvice ee duurjogta qaranka waa mid aad ugu keymeesan, inta badan geedaha afka qalaad lagu dhaho **beech**, spruce iyo fir..."" which translates to ""The Plitvice Lakes national park is characterized by, mostly deciduous trees such as **beech**, spruce and fir...""

Therefore, beech trees are among the most common trees in the park.
"
Xayawaannada naadirka ah ee soo socda keebaa laga heli karaa beerta qaranka ee Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **B: Xayawaanka Badger-ka malabka (European Badger)**.

The text states that the European Badger is one of the rare animals found in the Plitvice Lakes National Park.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay kode-yada gobolku ka caawiyaan?","The correct answer is **B: Xakamaynta suuqa (Controlling the market)**.

The text explicitly states: ""U jeedada saxda ah ayaa ah in shirkadani aad loogu maamulo suuqyadooda; kaliya waa lacag wareejin."" This translates to: ""The real purpose is for this company to manage their markets; it's just money transfer.""  The text argues that the state codes are a tool for market control, not for preventing illegal copying.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwan soo socda keebaa been ka sheegaya xeer-hoosaadka gobolka ee ay wadaan shirkadaha warbaahintu?","The correct answer is **B: Waxay kaa caawinayaan ka fogaanshaha nuqulka sharci darrada ah**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Haba yaraatee, koodadka gobaladu wax saamayna kuma leh nuqulaynta sharci darrada ah; nuqulayn xabbad-xabbada ah ee cajaladu caadi bay ugu daarmaysaa aalad kasta ta asalka ahi ku daarmi lahayd.""  This directly contradicts option B, which claims the codes help avoid illegal copying. The passage argues they *don't* help.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay lagama maarmaan u yihiin helitaanka koontaroolka suuqa oo badan** - The passage suggests it's all about marketing and money, not market control.
*   **C: Waxay faa'iido u leeyihiin wareejinta lacagta** -  The passage says it's *only* about money flowing, implying the codes themselves don't directly provide financial benefits.
*   **D: Waa dhif inay caawiyaan ka hortagga burcad-badeednimada** - The passage focuses solely on the ineffectiveness against illegal copying.



"
"Markaad imaanaysa dhulkaaga hooyo, habkee baa caadiyan aan rasmi ahayn?","The correct answer is **D: Kontoroolka kastamka**.

Here's why:

* **Kontoroolka kastamka (Customs Control)** is the official process of inspecting goods entering a country. It's the department responsible for checking what you're bringing in, ensuring compliance with import regulations, and collecting duties and taxes. The question explicitly mentions the tax authorities and the need to know what you can and cannot bring in.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Hubinta socdaalka (Travel verification)** is about confirming your travel documents (passport, visa). While important, it's not the core process of examining goods.
* **Iska xaqiijinta alaabta (Goods self-verification)** is not a formal process; it refers to you checking your own belongings, not a government inspection.
* **Xadka sharciga ah ee alaabta (Legal limits of goods)** is a factor *within* customs control, but customs control itself is the overall process.



"
Kuwan soo socda keebaa habboon inaad ogaato ka hor intaadan iman dalkaagi?,"The correct answer is **B: Haddii aad u baahan tahay inaad ku dhawaaqdo shay ka badan xadka sharciga ah.**

Here's why:

The question asks what you should know *before* arriving in your home country, based on the provided text. The text emphasizes the potential difficulty with customs if the immigration process is absent or disorganized. The key takeaway is the need to understand what you can and cannot bring back, and to declare anything exceeding legal limits.  Option B directly addresses this core concern.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Haddii ay jiri doonto isbaaro socdaalka ah:** While helpful to know, the text doesn't specifically say you need to know this *before* arriving.
*   **C: Haddii ay jiri doonto xakamaynta kastamka:** Similar to A, this is something to be aware of, but not the *primary* concern for pre-arrival preparation.
*   **D: Haddii uu jiro shay aan la oggolayn oo aad keenayso:** This is a *consequence* of not knowing what you can and can't bring, not the information you should know *beforehand*.

Therefore, understanding the limits on what you can declare (option B) is the most relevant information to have *before* arriving home, as highlighted by the text.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay faa'iidada u oggolaanaysa fuulayaasha inay si joogto ah u ogaadaan dariiqyo cusub oo gudaha Dooxada Cochamó ah?","The correct answer is **D: Darbiyada (Roads)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...buur fuulayasha kakala yimid dunida dacaladeeda ayaa si joogta ah u sameynaya wadooyin cusub oo ay ka mid yihiin darbiyadeeda aan dhamaadka laheyn."" This translates to ""...the goats have come into the external world and are constantly creating new roads, including their endless paths."" Therefore, the benefit is the creation of roads.
"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo macluumaadka lagu sheegay tuduca, yaa daboolaya isgoysyada ugu badan ee nus-dhuleedka Koonfureed?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Star Alliance waxay koobtaa wax kasta marka laga reebo bariga Koonfurta Baasifikada laga bilaabo Santiago de Chile ilaa Tahiti..."" This indicates that Star Alliance covers a significant portion of the South American and South Pacific region, filling a major gap in coverage of the southern hemisphere.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **SkyTeam:** The passage explicitly mentions SkyTeam *not* using the three major Southern Ocean shipping routes.
*   **South Pacific:** ""South Pacific"" is a geographical region, not an airline alliance.
*   **LATAM Oneworld:** The passage states LATAM Oneworld covers a specific route, not the entire southern hemisphere.

Therefore, Star Alliance is the alliance that covers the most significant gaps in coverage of the southern hemisphere according to the provided text."
Isbahaysigee diyaaradeed ayaa daboolaya inta ugu yar ee ka gudubka badda ee nus-dhulka Koonfureed?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Star Alliance waxay koobtaa wax kasta marka laga reebo bariga Koonfurta Baasifikada laga bilaabo Santiago de Chile ilaa Tahiti..."" This directly indicates that Star Alliance is the alliance covering the most oceanic routes in the Southern Hemisphere, specifically in the eastern South Pacific.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: South Pacific:** This is a region, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: LATAM Oneworld:** This is a specific airline alliance operating a route, but not encompassing the broadest oceanic coverage.
*   **D: SkyTeam:** The passage doesn't mention SkyTeam at all in relation to Southern Hemisphere oceanic routes.



"
Waa kuwee ururka dalxiiska ee ku guulaystay Dalxiiska Orodka Caalamiga ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Tag Dalxiiska Orodka**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Guusha Socdaallada Caalamiga ah ee Dunida, Go Running Tours ayaa leh kumanaan bixiyeyaal indhoolayaal ah oo jooga afarta qaaradood. Xididada Tartanka Oradka Barcelona, Barcelona iyo Copenhagen tartanka Oradka Copenhagen, waa ay fududeet in lagu biro Tartanka Oradka Prague ee lagu qabtay Prague iyo meelo kale.""

This indicates that Go Running Tours has facilitated participation in running events in Barcelona, Copenhagen, and Prague.  The question asks about *successful* tourism groups in the International Running Tourism.  While Barcelona, Copenhagen and Prague are mentioned, the question is asking about the *groups* organizing these events. The text doesn't name specific groups, but implies Go Running Tours facilitates participation in these events. Option B, ""Tag Dalxiiska Orodka"" (Go Running Tours), is the most relevant and logical choice given the context of the passage.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Immisa hay'adood oo indho-indhayn ah oo kala duwan ayuu tartanka dalxiisayaasha ee Go Running uu ka caawiya inay isku xidhmaan?","The correct answer is **A: Afar**.

The text states: ""...Go Running Tours ayaa leh kumanaan bixiyeyaal indhoolayaal ah oo jooga afarta qaaradood."" ( ...Go Running Tours has thousands of overseas providers located on four continents.)  This directly indicates they connect with providers on four continents.
"
Maxay tahay in dalxiise sameeyo haddii ay rajeynayaan aragtida ugu muuqa fiican ama ugu cadcad ee suurtagalka ah ee haramcadka?,"The correct answer is **A: Tag safari socod ah oo aad u socotay (Go on a walking safari)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Socodka safari (sidoo kale na loo yaqaano socodka duurka”, “socodka safari”, ama ku bixitaanka “lugta”) ayaa koobo socodka oo dhawr saacadood ama dhawr maalmood.""  This translates to ""Walking safaris (also known as bush walks, walking safaris, or foot excursions) are short walks of a few hours or a few days."" The passage implies that walking increases the chances of seeing animals, particularly predators like lions and leopards.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Inuu kuso socdo duurka (To walk in the bush):** While related, ""walking a safari"" is a specific type of guided walk with the goal of wildlife viewing.
*   **C: Inuu Isticmaalo muraayadaha indhaha (To use binoculars):** Binoculars help *see* animals from a distance, but they don't increase the chances of *encountering* them.
*   **D: Baabuur qaado oo isticmaal qalabka caadiga ah (Take a car and use regular equipment):** The passage mentions cars, but it doesn't say they are the best way to see predators. Walking is presented as a better option.



"
"Sida ku salaysan tuduca, noocee ah xayawaan ah ayaa laga yaabaa in booqduhu uu la kulmo inta lagu jiro safarka safari ee gaariga?","The correct answer is **A: Libaaxyo** and **D: Haramcadyada**.

The text explicitly states: ""Libaaxyada, Haramacadyada iyo Shabeeladda mararka qaar way qajilaan waxaadna si wacan oogu arki kartaa diirad."" which translates to ""Predators, Hyenas and Cheetahs sometimes are quick and you can clearly see them with focus.""

While the text mentions giraffes and elephants can be approached by vehicles, it doesn't specifically say that visitors will *always* see them. The text says predators can be seen ""sometimes"". Therefore, options A and D are the best answers based on the provided text.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa hoos u dhigi karo kharashka dalxiiska?","The correct answer is **B: Helitaanka koox afar ah**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""si aad u heshaan kharash qofeed kan ka fiican"" which translates to ""to get a better per-person cost.""  It then advises forming groups of four to six people.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adiga kaligaa aadaayo (You are going alone):**  The passage implies going alone is *not* ideal for cost savings.
* **C: La socdaalaya qof kale (Traveling with someone else):** While potentially better than going alone, it's not as cost-effective as a group of 4-6.
* **D: Helitaanka koox ka kooban lix ama ka badan (Getting a group of six or more):** The passage specifically recommends groups of *four to six*.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaa ay u badan tahay inuu xaqiijiyo heerka dalxiiska ugu fiican?","The correct answer is **A: Dalxiisayaal doonaya in ay kala badashaan baabuurta**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sikasto ha ahaatee, tan waa inay ahanin walaacaada maxaa yeelay dadka dalxiisayo ayaa la bedelaa si loo buuxiyo baabuurta. Dhab ahaantii waxay badanaa u muuqataa hab dadka lagu khiyaamayo si ay lacag dheeraada u bixiyaan.""

This indicates that the primary reason for sharing rides is to fill vehicles, and often involves people being exploited for extra money.  The other options (B, C, D) are simply suggested group sizes, but the passage connects tourism with vehicle sharing.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa ka qayb qaatay aqoonsiga caalamiga ah ee San Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: Joogitaanka joogtada ah ee noocyada kala duwan ee farshaxanka iyo warbaahinta**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka soo muuqashadeeda badan ee muusikada, filimada, suugaanta iyo dhaqamada caanka ah waxay magaalada iyo muuqaaladeeda ka caawisay in laga aqoonsada caalamka dhan."" (Its frequent appearance in music, movies, literature, and popular customs has helped the city and its image to be recognized worldwide.)

The other options are not directly supported by this statement:

*   **B: Goobaha shirarka ugu sarreeya:** The passage doesn't mention conference centers.
*   **C: Kala duwanaanshaha dhaqaale:** While the economic diversity is noted, the passage links the global recognition to the cultural presence, not the economic diversity itself.
*   **D: Goob cusub oo hada la saamaynaayo oo ah goob cunto Aasiyaan:** The passage mentions the excellent Asian food scene, but doesn't connect it to the city's global recognition.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate response based on the text."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan San Francisco oo aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **D: Dhaqaaluhu wuxuu gebi ahaanba ku tiirsan yahay dalxiiska (The economy is entirely reliant on tourism)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that San Francisco's economy is *diverse* and lists several key sectors: high tech, government, finance, commerce, and tourism. It doesn't claim that tourism is the *only* driver of the economy. Options A, B, and C are all mentioned in the passage as aspects of San Francisco's appeal and economic offerings. Option D exaggerates the reliance on tourism, which is not supported by the text.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay nooca socotada ah ee aan laga yaabin in uu ka faa'iidaysto isticmaalka adeegyada wakiilka socdaalka?","The correct answer is **C: Socotada aan weli helin fiisahooda**.

The text explicitly states: ""Waxay sidoo kale kuu samayn karaan diyaar garaw hadii aad u baahantahay aad kaga fikirto bixinta ama soo saarista dhugmatiga aad ku tagayso (sida fiisaha)."" This means that arranging visas is something travel agents can assist with. Therefore, someone who hasn't obtained their visa yet would benefit from using a travel agent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Socotada aan go'aan lahayn:**  The text doesn't mention anything about travelers lacking a decision.
* **B: Socotada u nugul u janjeeritaanka:** The text doesn't mention travelers being susceptible to delays.
* **D: Socotada doorbidaya heshiisyada xirmada ballansashada:** The text suggests travel agents offer bundled services, so someone choosing this would *benefit* from a travel agent.



"
Kuwan soo socda midkee aan lagu xusin tuducda inuu yahay faa'iidada laga helo iskadiwaangalinta loo maro wakiilka safarka?,"The correct answer is **A: Dukumeentiyada socdaalka oo degdeg ah (Emergency travel documents)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions that travel agents can help with obtaining travel documents needed for your destination (like visas).  This implies assistance with emergency travel documents falls under their purview.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Heshiisyada hoteelada (Hotel agreements):** The text states that travel agents often have agreements with hotels, but it doesn't present this as a *benefit* you receive *by using the travel agent*. It just describes a common practice.
* **C: Baakadaha loo wada dhan yahay (All-inclusive packages):** The text describes travel agents offering interconnected services like breakfast, transportation, and flights/hotels, forming a package.  But the term ""all-inclusive package"" isn't used.
* **D: U boos qabashada ama ceelinta (Reservation or booking):** While travel agents *do* make reservations, the text doesn't frame this as a unique *benefit* of using them.  Making reservations is a standard function.



Therefore, emergency travel documents are the most likely benefit listed that isn't covered by other options.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa aanay aaladaha turjumaanka qoraalka ee wakhtiga-dhabta awoodin?","The correct answer is **A: Turjumidda calaamadaha ku qoran luqadaha shisheeye** (Translating text written in foreign languages).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Barnaamijyada ku jira qaybtan qaarkood waxay xitaa turjumi karaan qoraal luuqad qalaad ah oo ku qoran calaamaso ama ashyaa dhulka yaal marka isticmaaluhu taleefankiisa casriga ah dhanka walxahaas u jeediyo."" (Some programs in this category can even translate text written in a foreign language that is on signs or objects on the ground when the user points their modern phone at it.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Turjumaada dhamaan qaybaha qoraalka** (Translating all parts of the text) - The text mentions translation of specific items like signs, not *all* text.
* **C: Ku turjumida qoraalka walxaha iyada oo la isticmaalaayo telefoonka casriga ah** (Translating text on objects using a modern phone) - While the text mentions this, option A is a more precise description of the capability.
* **D: Sida saxda ah u turjumida 100% waqtiga saxda ah** (Translating accurately 100% of the time) - The text implies that translations are not always 100% accurate.



"
Maxaa ogolaanaya turjumaada in lagu sameeyo qaab intarnet la’aan ah ama oflayn?,"The correct answer is **C: Soo dejinta xogta luqadda (Downloading language data)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Google Translate, kaasoo ogolaada turjumista bilaa khadka ah ka dib markaad la soo degto xogta luqadaad rabto."" (Google Translate, which allows for offline translation after you download the language data you need.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qadadka turjumaadka ee la horumariyay (Translation algorithms):** While algorithms are essential, they don't *enable* offline translation.
* **B: Taleefannada casriga ah (Modern telephones):** Modern phones are necessary to *use* the app, but they don't inherently provide offline translation.
* **D: Codsiyada ku jira qaybta turjumaadda-waqtiga dhabta ah (Applications in the real-time translation section):** Real-time translation can be online or offline, but it's not the mechanism that makes offline translation possible. It's the downloaded data.
"
Kuwa soo socda kee baa aan kicinaynin ama aan keenaynin baraf badan?,"The correct answer is **A: Baraf isku dheg dhegan (Stable Ice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the problem is when the ice *slides* and causes things to move.  ""Baraf isku dheg dhegan"" translates to ""Stable Ice"". Stable ice wouldn't slide and therefore wouldn't cause the issue of moving things.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aadanaha (Humans):** The passage directly mentions that humans can cause the ice to slide.
*   **C: Iftiinka Qorraxda (Sunlight):** While sunlight might melt ice, it doesn't directly cause the sliding and movement described as the problem.
*   **D: Baraf dheeraad ah oo da'aya (Old melting ice):** The passage describes old melting ice as a *cause* of the problem (sliding).



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwa soo socda kee baa u soo dhaca sida barafka?","The correct answer is **C: Mugga barafka oo xad dhaaf ah oo ku yaal qaybaha dhaadheer ee buurta**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the problem with the ice is that it accumulates and then needs something to move it and cause it to fall, which can then trigger avalanches. This accumulation of ice happens in the ""mugga barafka"" (snowpack) at the top of the mountains.  Option C directly refers to this accumulation of excessive snowpack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baraf isku dhegdhegan oo wali kicin oo aad ahayn (Stable, unconsolidated snow):**  Unconsolidated snow isn't the primary issue causing avalanches.  It needs weight and a trigger.
* **B: Qaybaha dhaadheer ee buurta oo aan baraf lahayn (Bare slopes of the mountain):** Bare slopes aren't directly related to avalanches caused by snow.
* **D: Baraf aanan bini aadamka wali uusan taabanin (Snow that humans haven't touched):** Human touch isn't the *cause* of the avalanche, it's often a *trigger*. The underlying problem is the accumulation and instability of the snowpack.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa kuwee maaddooyinka laga sameeyo curry-ga oo ah cunto aad u macaan?","The correct answer is **B: Dhirta qudaarta iyo dhirta udgoon badan**.

Here's why:

The text states that curry is made from:

*   ""geedo"" (herbs)
*   ""dhir cuntada"" (culinary plants)

These are essentially herbs and spices, which contribute to the flavor and aroma of curry. It also mentions that curry can include meat or vegetables, but the core components that make it ""curry"" are the herbs and spices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Caanaha Yogurt -ka iyo Biyo** (Yogurt and Water) - These are not mentioned as core ingredients in the definition of curry.
*   **C: Caanaha qumbaha iyo hilibka** (Cumin and Meat) - While cumin can be used, it's just one example of a spice, and the definition is broader.
*   **D: Qudaarta iyo caano** (Fruits and Dairy) -  Fruits and dairy aren't explicitly mentioned as fundamental components."
waa kuwee maadada kujirto curry-ga ee mararka qaarkooda la isticmaalaa si loogu badalo caanaha qumbaha gobolada qaarkood?,"The answer is **D: Dhirta udgoonka badan (Herbs)**.

The passage states: ""Curry ayaa cunto ka samaysan geedo, dhir cuntada, oo la socdaan hilib ama khudaar."" This translates to ""Curry is made from herbs, edible plants, and accompanied by meat or vegetables.""  Therefore, herbs are one of the primary components of curry.
"
Waa maxay sababta u leexashada agagaarka buurtaTransantarctic aay ugu baahantahay in la tago dhulka fidsan?,"The correct answer is **B: Barafka isku dhag dhagay khatar ayu leeyahay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the road is ""baraf adkaday"" (hardened ice) and the reason for the detour is to ""soo korto taagga"" (gain altitude).** This implies that the original route is difficult or dangerous, and the detour is to avoid a hazard.
* **""Barafka isku dhag dhagay khatar ayu leeyahay"" (The ice is treacherous/dangerous) directly supports this idea.**  The detour is likely to avoid a particularly dangerous section of ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saldhigga McMurdo ayaa inta badan xiran (McMurdo Station is often closed):** The passage doesn't mention the station being closed. The road's difficulty is described, not the station's availability.
* **C: Cagaf-cagafyada khaaska ah maaha kuwo jilicsan (The special vehicles are not soft):**  The passage states the vehicles *are* special and designed for the ice, implying they are not ""soft.""
* **D: Way ka sahlan tahay inaad ku safarto badda Ross (It's easier to travel on the Ross Sea):** The passage explicitly states the road *doesn't* go on the Ross Sea, and the detour is a result of needing to gain altitude, making sea travel less likely.



"
maxaa lagu summeeyay calamada ku teedsan dariiqa cirifka koonfureed?,"The correct answer is **B: Cagaf-cagafyada ku raran shidaalka** (Ice roads that are hardened with fuel).

The passage states: ""Waxa mari kara oo keliya cagafyo gaar ah, kuwaasoo alaabooyin shidaal meesha ku qaada."" which translates to ""Only special ice roads can pass, which use fuel to harden the ice.""

Therefore, the ice roads are marked with the fuel used to harden them.
"
Maxaan tuduca lagu xusin wax ay tahay in dalxiisayaashu ogaadaan marka ay u sahaminayaan Koonfurta Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: In wadamada kala duwani ay qabaan shuruudo kala duwan oo dhanka fiisaha ah.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Shuruudaha dal-ku-galka iyo qarashkuba way ku kala duwan yihiin waddamada waxaana saameynaya waddanka aad ka imanayso."" This directly addresses the need for travelers to be aware of varying visa requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions road trips, it doesn't highlight it as a *way* to explore lesser-known places. It focuses on the practicality of road trips in general.
* **C:** The passage directly contradicts this by stating: ""Markaxda ku hay in inkastoo Koonfurta Afrika ay degan tahay, wadamada la deriska dhan ma degana.""
* **D:** The passage acknowledges that a 4x4 is *recommended* but doesn't state it's *required* for all road trips. It's more about being prepared for different terrains.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa loo qaadan karaa in aay tahay tala xun oo la siiyo dalxiisayaasha raadinaya inay Koonfurta Afrika ku sahamiyaan ayaga oo isticmaalaya baabuur?","The correct answer is **A: Waxyaalaha degdega ah ee gaadhiga dhexdiisa ayaa laga yaabaa inuu u baahdo sharci** (Emergency equipment in the car might need a permit).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Waddan kasta sidoo kale waxa uu leeyahay shuruuc cusub oo sheegaya ashayaada degdeg ah ee ay tahay in gaariga ay saaraarto."" (Each country also has new laws stating the emergency items that must be in the car). This implies that having the *required* emergency equipment might need specific permits or be subject to regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: In kastoo isticmaalka baabuurka 4x4 lagu taliyay, inta badan goobaha waxaa lagu isticmaali karaa baabuur iska caadi ah** (Although the use of a 4x4 car is recommended, most places can be accessed with a regular car) - The passage says 4x4 is *recommended*, not that regular cars are sufficient everywhere.
* **C: Ku safrida baabuurka waxay u fiican tahay kuwa raadinaya inay ka leexdaan waddooyinka caadiga ah** (Driving a car is good for those looking to go off the beaten path) - The passage doesn't say this is a benefit of driving.
* **D: Dhammaan dalalka deriska la ah Koonfurta Afrika maaha kuwo ku habboon in la booqdo** (All neighboring countries of South Africa are not suitable for visiting) - The passage says this, but it's not presented as a *problem* or a *potential issue* that needs a permit. It's just a fact.



"
Keeba kuwa soo socda aan lagu xusin tuduca in uu yahay khatar ka dhalan karta ama ka iman karta in la tago bacahaaga iyaga oo aan cidina ilaalinayn?,"The correct answer is **B: Adigoon ogeyn waxaad noqon kartaa mid ka shaqeeya ilaalinta daroogada.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Waxaad ogaaneysa adiga laguu isticmaaley sidaha daroogada adigoon ogeyn..."" (You know you could be used as a carrier of drugs without knowing...). This directly connects to the idea of unknowingly being involved in drug trafficking.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Waa laga yaabaa in la xado (It might be confiscated):** While possible, the text focuses on the *risk* associated with leaving bags unattended, not just the potential for confiscation.
* **C: Waxay ku khaldami karaan qof kale (Someone else might mistake it):** This is a possibility, but the primary concern highlighted in the text is the intentional misuse of bags for drug trafficking.
* **D: Maamuladu waxa ay u arki karaan bamba dhici rabto taas oo aad u khatar badan (Authorities might see it as a potential bomb):**  The text mentions the risk of unattended bags being mistaken for bombs, but it's presented as a separate, though related, danger. The core danger described is drug trafficking.



"
Waa maxay waxa tuduca aan lagu xusin ee ku saabsan qaadashada daroogada?,"The correct answer is **A: Wadamada qaarkood, dambiilayaasha markii ugu horeysay danbiga galay waxaa lagu xukumi karaa dil**.

The text explicitly states: ""...waxaa ka mid noqon karaa xarig ka badan 10 sannadood ama dil."" This directly supports option A.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Taxaddar dheeraad ah waa in la sameeyaa markaad u safrayso wadamada caalamka:** While the text *does* recommend being cautious, it doesn't specifically state that *additional* caution is required.
* **C: Eeyaha dhuuqa maandooriyaha ayaa la isticmaali karaa iyaga oo aan la ogaanin:** The text mentions that seized packages may contain ""minen,"" but doesn't detail the use of ""eeyaha dhuuqa maandooriyaha"" (likely a misspelling/translation issue).
* **D: Maamulka ayaa laga yaabaa inay la wareegaan boorsooyinkaaga, xitaa haddii aadan wadanin daroogo:**  The text mentions authorities may seize packages, but doesn't explicitly state this will happen *even if you haven't carried drugs.* It's implied that seizing occurs due to suspicion of drugs or other dangers.

Cabbitaan noocee ah ayaan loo xusin inuu yahay shay laisku dayi karo in lagu sameeyo guriga inta lagu jiro fasaxa?,"The correct answer is **D: Shaaha**.

The text explicitly states: ""Guriga ka buuxso kafee qaniya subaxii habeenkiina waxooga shaah dajiye jamomayla ah."" (Fill your home with fragrant coffee in the morning, and brew a little tea in the evening.) This indicates tea is something you can make at home. The text then goes on to suggest experimenting with drinks during a break, implying tea as a possibility.
"
Kuwan soo socda keebaa habboon inaad booqato inta lagu jiro fasaxa haddii magaaladaada ay caan ku tahay dhaqanka cabitaanka?,"The correct answer is **C: Makhaayadaha aanad sida caadiga ah aad ugu badnayn (Restaurants you don't usually go to).**

Here's why:

* The passage suggests exploring new places to try different drinks during a vacation. 
* Option C directly aligns with this suggestion by recommending visiting restaurants you wouldn't normally frequent, implying a chance to discover new bars and potentially unique drink options.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Dukaamada kafeega ee ku yaala diwada xaafadaada (Coffee shops in your neighborhood):** This is too similar to your regular routine. The passage is about trying something new.
* **B: Casiirka iyo dukaamada cabitaanka (Juice and beverage stores):** While you might find drinks there, it doesn't specifically address the ""dhaqanka cabitaanka"" (drinking culture) aspect mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Makhaayadaha soo diyaariya shaaha chamomile-ka (Restaurants that serve chamomile tea):** This is focused on a specific, calming drink and doesn't relate to exploring the broader drinking culture.



"
Halkee ayay farshaxannada ama sawirada qoolleyda aay ku yallaan?,"The correct answer is **M: Mel u jirto mel loo soconaay nus saac tuulada (A)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Barxadda kaniisadda, waxaa ku yaalo farshaxan qooley laga qoray dhagaxa dhalada u eg oo ku yaalo qabriyo korkooda."" (On the churchyard, there is a tribal fresco written on a gemstone-like stone located on top of the graves.) and ""...Waxaay qaadanaysaa nusasaace in la dhex lugeeyo tuulada aadka u xiisaha badan."" (...It takes half an hour to walk through the very interesting village.) This implies the fresco is located *in* the churchyard, which is part of the village and accessible after walking through it.  Option A best reflects this.

Option B (Gudaha kaniisada - Inside the church) is too specific - the fresco is on the churchyard, not *inside* the building itself.

Option C (Jasiiradda Eysturoy - The island of Eysturoy) is incorrect because the fresco is specifically located in Haldarsvík, which is on Eysturoy, but the question asks *where* the fresco is located within Haldarsvík.

Option D (Kaniisadda gudaheeda - Inside the church) is incorrect for the same reason as B.

Therefore, the best answer is A.
"
Fiisaha noocee ah ayaa laga yaabaa inuu u baahdo qofka inuu bixiyo caddaynta taageero lacageed oo ku filan?,"The correct answer is **D: Fiiisaha ardayda**.

The text explicitly states: ""Fiisayaasha ardaydu guud ahaan waxay leeyihiin shuruudo...sidoo kale caddayn tusinaysa inaad haysato qarashkaad wax ku baran lahayd ugu yaraan sannadka ugu horeeya ee kooraskaaga."" This directly links student visas with the requirement to prove sufficient financial support.
"
Yaa ay u badan tahay inuu u baahdo muda gororkisa fiisaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Arday caalami ah**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""u tagista arday caalami ah guud ahaan waxay u baahan tahay sii joogitaan ka dheer halka loo aado sida dalxiis Caadi ah. Guud ahaan, joogista waddan ajanabi muddo dheer waxay kaaga baahan tahay inaad fiiso horey ka sii hesho. Fiisayaasha ardaydu guud ahaan waxay leeyihiin shuruudo iyo habraac ka duwan kuwa dalxiisa caadiga ah iyo kuwa ganacsiga.""

This clearly indicates that international students require a visa for stays longer than typical tourism.
"
Goorma ayay tahay inaad si gaar ah uga digtoonaato kaneecada?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaynta roobka (Storing hay)**.

The text explicitly states that you should be extra cautious of snakes when storing hay, even in a silo. This makes option C the most accurate answer.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa la gudboon inaad iska ilaaliso inaad samayso si aad uga fogaato kaneecada marka aad dhex marayso kaynta roobka?","The correct answer is **C: Wadista iyada oo la marayo meelaha kulaala-hoosaadka ah**

Here's why:

The text states that even a few cracks opened by a dog can allow a cat to enter a car. Option C, driving through areas with cat presence, directly addresses the risk of encountering a cat. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka tagista albaabada baabuurka oo furan muddo aad u dheer** - This is the *opposite* of what you should do.
*   **B: Wadista inta lagu jiro xiliga xagaaga** - The text doesn't connect summer to cat risk.
*   **D: Ka tagista baabuurka isaga oo aan cidna la joogin xiliga socodka masaafada dheer** - This increases the risk, as the car is unattended.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kee baa weedhahan soo socda ee ku saabsan Sundarbans aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **B: Nus ka mid ah bedka guud ahaan waxa uu leeyahay dhiiqo** (More than half of the area has water).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Sundarbans waxay ka kooban yahiin dhul gaarayo ilaaa 3,850km², taas oo saddex meelood meel ay qariyeen biyo/goobo biyo fadhiyaan."" (Sundarbans consists of a total area of up to 3,850km², three-fifths of which are submerged land/wetlands).
* **Option B accurately reflects this information.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxaay tilmaamaysaa qaar kamid ah kaymaha waaweyn ee hadhay** (It describes some of the oldest trees): While the text mentions the Sundarbans were once extensive, it doesn't say *some* of the trees are old.  It's implied the area was once a large forest.
* **C: Waa goobta kaynta mangrove-ka ee ugu weyn adduunka** (It is the largest mangrove forest in the world): The text *does* state this: ""Waa goobta kaynta mangrove-ka ee ugu weyn adduunka.""
* **D: Waxay hoy u tahay deerada la arko ee ka badan shabeelada Bengal** (It is a habitat for more Royal Bengal tigers than the Ganges River): The text says ""400 shabeelka Royal Bengal ah..."" (400 Royal Bengal tigers...). It doesn't say *more* than the Ganges River, just that tigers are found there.



Therefore, the only statement that is *not* explicitly supported by the text is option B."
Waa kuwee qayb ka mid ah kaynta oo ku taalla dhulka Hindiya?,"The correct answer is **A: Beerta Qaranka ee Sundarbans**.

The text explicitly states: ""Qaybta kaynta ee dhulka Hindiya ku taal waxa loogu yeedhaa Barxadda Qaran ee Duurka qurux badan."" which translates to ""The mangrove forest part located in India is called the Sundarbans National Park.""
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Yaa ay u badan tahay in uu leeyahay ugu yaraan fahamka xaddidan ee luqadda Ingiriisiga?","The best answer is **A: Dadka ku hadla ugu yaraan laba luqadood oo kale.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes language diversity:** The text highlights the existence of over 5,000 languages and the difficulty of understanding spoken words, even compared to written ones.
* **The scenario describes diverse speakers:** The example of people from Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, and Sydney illustrates a mix of different regional dialects and likely, different first languages.
* **Limited English proficiency is implied:**  The scenario *implies* that these individuals might not have a completely fluent understanding of each other's English dialects.  They're sharing stories in their ""home language and market tongue,"" suggesting a reliance on dialects and perhaps even code-switching.
* **Option A directly addresses this:**  Someone who speaks at least two other languages is more likely to have a *limited* understanding of English *compared to someone who speaks only English*.  They are navigating a linguistic landscape where their English isn't their primary mode of communication.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Dadka da'doodu aay yar tahay:** While younger people *might* have a more limited vocabulary, it doesn't automatically mean they have limited *understanding* of English.  Many younger people in English-speaking countries have excellent English proficiency.
* **C: Dadka u safraya Toronto:**  Traveling to Toronto doesn't inherently mean someone has limited English. Many tourists are prepared to communicate in English.
* **D: Dadka da'doodu aay weyn tahay:** Older people *might* have less exposure to modern language changes, but that doesn't automatically equate to limited *understanding*.



Therefore, option A is the most logical inference based on the information provided in the passage."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa adkaani kara in lagu dhawaaqo?","The correct answer is **A: Erayada lahjada gaarka ah (Dialect words)**.

The passage specifically states: ""jeedina, taas oo ay adag tahay in lagu dhawaaqo si la fahmi karo"" which translates to ""pronunciation, which is difficult to understand."" This refers to dialect words, which are specific to certain regions or groups and often have unique pronunciations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cinwaanada (Titles):** The passage doesn't mention titles.
* **C: Ereyada qoran (Written words):** The passage states written words are easier to understand than spoken words.
* **D: Halqabsiga deegaanka (Regional accents):** While regional accents are related to dialect, the passage explicitly mentions the *pronunciation* being difficult, which is more directly tied to dialect words themselves."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Xaaladdee ayaa ku habboon qofka socotada ah ee qorsheynaya inuu baska ka raaco saldhigga degmooyinka dhexdooda?","The correct answer is **A: Socdaalku waxa uu ku sii jeedaa Jakar oo waxa uu hore u iibsaday tigidhka.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** Buses going to Jakar/Bumthang often leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
* **It also states:** ""In ta badan degmooyinka waxaa ka shaqeeya basaska koostarada Jabaaniska, kuwaaso ah kuwo raaxo wanaagsan."" (In most districts, Japanese-style buses operate, which are comfortable.)
* **Finally:** "" waxaa lagula telinaya in aad iibsato tikidh ka hor maalmo."" (It's advised to buy tickets in advance.)

Therefore, a traveler going to Jakar who has already purchased a ticket is in the best position to catch one of the buses leaving around 6:30-7:30 AM.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Socdaalku wuxuu ku sii jeedaa Bumthang wuxuuna u baahan yahay inuu baxo 7 saac:** While Bumthang is a common destination, the text specifically mentions the 6:30-7:30 AM timeframe for Jakar/Bumthang buses, and doesn't provide a specific departure time for Bumthang.
* **C: Socdaalku wuxuu u socdaa Paro wuxuuna u baahan yahay inuu baxo 11 saac ka dib:** The text doesn't mention Paro or any specific departure time.
* **D: Socdaalku waxa uu u socdaa bari waxana uu imanayaa saldhiga ka hor 6:20:** The text doesn't mention travel direction (east) or a specific arrival time.



"
Maxay noqon lahayd talo wanaagsan oo la siinaayo dalxiisaha doonaya inuu bari uga socdaalo saldhigga basaska ee degmooyinka dhexdooda?,"The best answer is **B: Iibso tigidh hormaris ah (Buy a pre-booked ticket)**.

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The passage states buses often leave before 6:30-7:30 AM and that buses between districts are often crowded.
* **The solution:** The passage explicitly says you're *told* to buy tickets in advance. This suggests pre-booking is the way to avoid the crowds and ensure a seat.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Basasku waxay baxaan kaliya 8:30 ka dib (Buses only leave after 8:30 AM):** This contradicts the information in the passage that buses do leave earlier (6:30-7:30 AM).
* **C: Basas badan ayaa baxa maalinta oo dhan (Many buses leave throughout the day):** While true, this doesn't address the problem of crowded buses. Pre-booking helps avoid the crowds, regardless of how many buses run.
* **D: Tagaasida la wadaago ayaa laga yaabaa inay tahay habka ugu wanaagsan ee safarka (Shared taxis might be the best way to travel):** While shared taxis are mentioned as a convenient option for short distances, the question specifically asks about travel *from* the district bus station, implying longer distances.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan si sax ah aan u qeexaynin Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Laguma isticmaali karo diyaarad (You can't use an airplane)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Waxay na qabtaa garoon diyaarado"" which translates to ""It has an airport."" 
* Option C directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxay leedahay saamayn Carabi in ka badan marka loo eego dalka intiisa kale (It has a more Arab influence than the rest of the country):** The passage states this directly: ""Magaalada waxa ay leedahay ka duwaansho adag magaaloyinka dalka intiisa kale, sababtoo ah waxa ayleedahay qaab Carbeed inte Afrikaan ahaan laheyd."" (The city has a distinctiveness from the cities of the country, because it had an Arab style.)
* **B: Waa meel saboolnimo aay ku habsatay (It is a place that has been plagued by poverty):**  The passage mentions being on the list of the world's most dangerous places due to the risk of armed conflict, but it doesn't explicitly label it as simply ""poor."" It frames it within a context of danger and conflict.
* **D: Waxay wali tahay goob soo jiidato dalxiisayaal cajiib ah (It is still an amazing place that attracts tourists):** The passage mentions it being a special place of the world and having hosted events, indicating it *does* attract tourists, even if its current state is not as glamorous as in the past.



Therefore, option C is the only one that is definitively *incorrect* based on the provided text."
Midkee ka mid ah xaqiiqooyinka soo socda ee ku saabsan Timbuktu ayaa sax ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Magaalada waxaa lagu isticmaali karaa diyaarad**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""waxay na qabtaa garoon diyaarado"" which translates to ""it has an airport."" This directly confirms that Timbuktu can be accessed by airplane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aad ayay mel qalaad u tahay marka loo eego saboolnimada:** The text says ""Maanta, Timbuktu ayaa ah magaalo faqiir ah"" (Today, Timbuktu is a poor city), but it doesn't claim it's *more* poor than other places.
* **C: Waxay leedahay wax ka qabad Afrikaan oo yar marka loo eego magaalooyinka ku hareeraysan:** The text explicitly says ""Magaalada waxa ay leedahay ka duwaansho adag magaaloyinka dalka intiisa kale, sababtoo ah waxa ayleedahay qaab Carbeed inte Afrikaan ahaan laheyd"" (The city has a distinctiveness from other cities in the country because it has an Arab style). This contradicts the statement in option C.
* **D: Magaaladu hadda ma soo jiidato dalxiisayaasha:** The text mentions it was a significant location during Henry Louis Gate's Wonders of the World PPS, indicating it *did* attract tourists in the past. While it might not be as popular as before, the text doesn't say it doesn't attract tourists *now*.



"
Goorma ayaa markii hore la qorsheeyay ciyaaraha Olombikada xagaaga? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ogosto 2020**.

The passage states: ""Hadii aad ballansatay duulimadyadaada iyo goobaha aad dagi lahayd 2020 kahor inta aan dib udhigida lagu dhawaaqin..."" This indicates the Olympics were initially planned for August 2020.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, goorma ayay mandiqadda noqotaa mid sida daweesha daluulyada oo kale?","The correct answer is **D: Ka dib markii aay taabtay dhulka**.

Here's why:

The passage states the following: ""Waxay ku bilaaben tuunbo lagagudbinayo daruuraha dabeesha waxayna noqotay “taluuliye” marka ay taabtan dhulka."" This directly translates to ""It begins as a column of rotating wind that lifts the air around it and rises. It generates a high-level storm (often 100-200 mph) and can carry heavy loads while the storm is ongoing. It starts as a funnel of wind that descends from the storm clouds and becomes a ""tornado"" when it touches the ground.""

Therefore, a tornado is formed *after* the funnel of rotating wind touches the ground. Options A, B, and C describe stages *before* the tornado becomes a tornado.
"
Waa kuwee kuwan sifada saxda ah ee daweesha taluulyada duufaanta?,"The correct answer is **B: Badana waxay ku dhaqaaqaan walxaha culus.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a tornado as a rotating column of low-pressure air that lifts air around it.** It explicitly states that tornadoes can pick up heavy objects.
* **Option B directly reflects that key characteristic.**

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Had iyo jeer waxay dhaliyaan dabaylo ku dhow 100-200 mayl saacaddiiba** - While many tornadoes *do* reach these speeds, it's not *always* the case. Tornadoes can vary in intensity.
* **C: Waxaay noqdaan sida mandaqada oo kale marka aay so gaaraan dhulka** - This is a metaphorical description of the funnel cloud, but not a defining physical characteristic.
* **D: Waxay yihiin tiirar wareeg ah oo hawada dibadda u riixaya** - While the passage mentions a rotating column, the description focuses on lifting air *around* it, not necessarily pushing air outwards.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the passage.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Halkee ayuu qofka socotada ah ka heli karaa talo ku saabsan xaaladda siyaasadeed ee magaalada uu u socdo?","The correct answer is **B: Laga soo bilaabo aragtida lagu soo bandhigay la-talinta safarka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Latalinta ayaaba iska ah xog dulmarid kooban ee jawiga siyaasada dalka."" (Advice is a brief intelligence report on the political climate of the country.) It also mentions that the advice isn't always from the traveler's own government, but from other sources that are tailored to their citizens.

Option B directly reflects this by saying the advice is available ""from the perspective presented by travel advice."" The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Waxaa laga helaa dawladda dalka aay booqan doonaan:** While governments *can* provide advice, the passage emphasizes that this isn't always the case and other sources are relevant.
*   **C: Muwaadiniinta dalka ay booqan doonaan:**  The passage says the advice is tailored to *their* citizens, not necessarily to the traveler's.
*   **D: Wadankooda sax ah:** The passage mentions advice might *not* come from a traveler's own government.



"
"Haddii ay dhacdo la-talin socdaal, waa maxay muwaadin ajnabi ah oo aan laga yaabo inuu la kulmo?","The correct answer is **B: Warbixin kooban oo aad u tafac tiran oo ku saabsan xaaladda siyaasadeed ee dalka (A brief, detailed overview of the country's political situation).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Latalinta ayaaba iska ah xog dulmarid kooban ee jawiga siyaasada dalka."" (Advice is a brief overview of the political climate of the country.)
* Option B best reflects this description of the advice provided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxaa saameeyay ka noqoshada caymiska (Affected by travel insurance)** While travel insurance is mentioned, it's a *result* of needing advice, not the *advice itself*.
* **C: Caymiska caafimaadka ayaa saameeyay (Health insurance affected)** Similar to A, health insurance is a consequence, not the core of the advice.
* **D: Warbixin faahfaahsan oo ku saabsan xaaladda siyaasadeed ee dalka (A comprehensive report on the country's political situation)** The passage says the advice is *brief*, not comprehensive.

"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Safar noocee ah ayaa ugu yar ee looga baahan yahay caawinaad ballan oo lala yeelanaayo wakiil socdaal?","The correct answer is **C: Safar soo bandhigi doona ama keeni doono caqabad luqadeed.**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agencies were typically useful for people traveling to places with:

*   Different culture
*   Different language
*   Lower income countries

Option C directly addresses the language barrier, which is a key reason someone would need a travel agency.  The other options are less directly related to the typical use case described in the passage.

*   **A:** A business trip to a familiar city wouldn't usually require a travel agency.
*   **B:** A long trip with a specific budget *could* benefit from a travel agency, but it's not the *most* common reason.
*   **D:** While a first international trip *might* benefit, the passage emphasizes destinations with existing differences, not simply the first international experience.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Xaaladee ayuu qofka socotada ahi ka faa'iidaysan karaa caawinta laga helo wakiilka socdaalka?","The correct answer is **D: Marka qofka socotada ah uu booqanayo meel ay ku kala duwan yihiin dhaqamada ay yaqaanaan.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that travel agents are particularly useful for people traveling to places with unfamiliar customs and cultures. Option D directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Marka qofka socotada ah uu ballansanayo duullimaadyada safarka si uu u soo booqdo magaaladooda** - While travel agents *can* help with booking flights, this isn't the core reason they're beneficial. Many people can book flights themselves.
* **B: Marka qofka socotada ah uu xiisaynayo inuu diiwaangashado oo uu u baxo dalxiis khaas ah markii ugu horeysay** -  While travel agents can assist with specialized trips, the passage doesn't focus on the initial registration process or exclusive travel.
* **C: Marka qofka socotada ah uu si fiican ugu hadli karo luuqada looga hadlo mesha uu doonaayo inuu fasaxa kuso qaato** - The passage states that travel agents are useful for *unfamiliar* cultures, implying that the traveler might *not* be able to speak the local language well.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa ka caawin kara qofka socotada ah si uu uga fogaado niyad jab marka uu booqanayo meelo cusub?","The correct answer is **A: Iyadoo la filayo heerar la mid ah halka ay ka yimaadeen (Expecting similar standards as they are used to)**.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that traveling is *not* like being at home. It highlights differences in laws, food, traffic, accommodation, etc. 
* To avoid disappointment, travelers need to have realistic expectations.  Expecting things to be *similar* to what they're used to minimizes the chance of being surprised and frustrated by differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rabitaanka in la tijaabiyo cuntooyinka aan la aqoon (The willingness to try unfamiliar foods):** While trying new foods is good, it doesn't directly address avoiding disappointment related to cultural or logistical differences.
* **C: U hoggaansanaanta sharciyada iskumidka ah halka ay ka yimaadeen (Adhering to similar laws as they are used to):** This is incorrect because laws *will* be different in a new place.
* **D: Ka fogaanshaha cilmi-baaris hore oo ku saabsan hoyga (Avoiding prior research about accommodation):**  Avoiding research is a bad idea.  It increases the risk of unpleasant surprises with lodging.



"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo xogta tuducda, qof noocee ah ayaa laga yaabaa inuu la kulmo niyad jab markuu u safrayo meel shisheeye?","The best answer is **C: Qofka aan bashaashka ahayn ee xidhxidhan (Someone who isn't adventurous and is rigid).**

Here's why:

The passage highlights that travel involves encountering unfamiliar things – laws, food, traffic, customs, language, etc.  Someone who isn't adventurous or rigid is more likely to be overwhelmed and experience disappointment when faced with these differences.  They might struggle to adapt to new situations and find the unfamiliar unsettling.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Qof jecel cuntooyinka qalaad (Someone who loves foreign food):** While experiencing new food is part of travel, it doesn't inherently lead to disappointment.
* **B: Qof ku horumara isbeddelka (Someone who embraces change):**  This is the *opposite* of what leads to disappointment, according to the passage.
* **D: Qof jecel waxbarashada (Someone who loves learning):**  Similar to embracing change, a love of learning makes someone more open to new experiences and less likely to be disappointed.

Kuwa soo socda keebaa aan ahayn tallada lagu taliyo socotada booqanaya waddan soo koraya markii ugu horeysay?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka fogow inaad cunooyin kala duwan aad cunto inta lagu jiro maalmahaaga ugu horreeya.**

Here's why:

* **The passage warns about cultural shocks and potential dangers in unfamiliar environments.** It emphasizes caution regarding hygiene, insects, and unfamiliar practices.
* **Option B is completely unrelated to the themes of cultural shocks and safety.** The passage doesn't mention avoiding different foods.  In fact, trying local cuisine is often a key part of experiencing a new culture.
* **The other options (A, C, and D) align with the passage's recommendations.** They all focus on safety and taking precautions in a new environment.

Therefore, avoiding diverse foods is the *least* relevant or advisable piece of advice according to the passage.



"
Kuwan soo socda keebaa aan lagu xusin inay yihiin wax lacag baylah ah lagu bixiyo marka aad la qabsanayso wadan hadan so hormaraayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Joodari ama suuf loogu talagalay kaamamka inta lagu jiro.**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically warns against sleeping on the ground in unfamiliar places due to potential pests.
* It recommends using mosquito nets or small screens.
* **Joodari (mosquito netting) or suuf (wool) for hammocks** are preventative measures *you purchase* to protect yourself from insects. These are items you buy *before* or *during* the trip for your own protection.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Cunto nooca reer galbeedka (Western-style food):** While you *might* pay for Western-style food, it's not inherently something you *must* buy or that's specifically mentioned as a potential cultural shock or a costly item related to cultural differences.
* **B: Addeegyada tayada leh (High-quality services):** Paying for high-quality services (hotels, transportation) is expected in many countries, not unique to developing nations, and not directly highlighted as a cultural concern.
* **D: Hudheelo tayo leh (High-quality bedding):** Similar to high-quality services, this is something you might pay for, but it's not explicitly linked to cultural differences or a specific warning in the passage.  The passage focuses on *protecting yourself from pests*, not on the quality of your bedding.

"Ikhtiyaaradan soo socda keebaa u wanaagsan qofka siyaasad hayaha ah ee doonaya nuqul ka mid ah siyaasadooda, laakiin laga yaabo in aanu geli karin internetka?","The best answer is **A: U dhiibitaanka koobiga qof saxibo yihin oo safar u baxaayo.**

Here's why:

* **The question specifically asks for an option for someone who *cannot* access the internet.** Options B and C involve digital copies and internet access, which are ruled out by the question.
* **Option A directly addresses the constraint.** Giving a copy to a trusted travel companion allows the person to have a physical copy without needing internet.
* **Option D (""Ku kaydinta nuqul gudaha """"Intarnetka gudihiisa"""""""") is a bit of a trick answer.** It attempts to sound like a valid offline solution but is essentially saying to store a digital copy *on* the internet-connected device, which contradicts the question.



Therefore, the most suitable option for someone unable to use the internet is to give a physical copy to a travel companion.

The passage explicitly states the need for the insurance email address and international phone numbers for authorization/consent and for the claim application. It also mentions having a copy of the insurance policy/relationship and a digital copy. However, it doesn't mention the specific need to show international emergency numbers. 

Therefore, the international emergency numbers are the least critical item to explicitly show according to the provided text.

The passage states: ""Qaar ka mida kamaradaha filimada dhexe ayaa adeegsada nooc 6 ba 6 sm ah, ama sida sii saxan 56 ba 56 mn ah. Tan ayaa ka dhigeysa heerka nadiif muuqaal mid kabadan afar jeer kan 35mm negatif (3136 mm2 la bar bardhigay 864).""

This directly links the 56x56mm film format to a cleaner image (better image quality) compared to the 35mm format, implying it's the closest to the quality achievable with a DSLR.  The other options are either less detailed or not directly connected to the passage's comparison.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kuwaaso keebaa noqon lahaa talaabadii ugu danbaysay ee bilaabida ganacsiga qorista safarka?","The correct answer is **C: Waxaad hagajisataa mareega ama wabseetya ku qaas ah (You launch a website or webpage dedicated to it)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the following steps to start a travel writing business:

1. **Develop your skills** (learn how to write travel content)
2. **Create a website** (establish an online presence)
3. **Gain experience** (write articles and build a reputation)

Launching a website is the final step. You need to have the skills and experience *before* you can launch your own website to showcase your work and attract clients.
"
"Markaad bilaabayso ganacsiga qorista safarka, awoodaha soo socda keebaa laga yaabaa in marka hore aay tahay in lagu takhasuso?","The correct answer is **A: Qoritaanada warbixinada Blogging-ka (Writing blog articles)**.

Here's why:

* **Focus for Beginners:** Starting with blog articles is a natural entry point. It allows you to showcase your writing skills, build a portfolio, and establish yourself as an expert in a niche.
* **Foundation for a Travel Website:**  Blog articles are the core content for a travel website.  You'll need strong writing to create engaging and informative pieces that attract readers.
* **Building Authority:** Consistently writing high-quality blog posts helps you build authority and credibility in the travel industry.
* **Less Initial Investment:** Compared to web design (D) or graphic design (C), writing requires minimal upfront investment.
* **Web Presence (B):** While online publishing is important, it usually comes *after* establishing strong writing skills.  

Therefore, focusing on travel blog writing is the most practical and beneficial starting point for someone launching a travel writing business.



"
Cimilo noocee ah ayaa inta badan keenaa inuu bilaamo dhibaatooyinka mindhicirka?,"The correct answer is **C: Cimiladaha kulaylka**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sida ay uga jiraan dhibaatooyin neefmarineed cimilooyinka qaboow, ayay dhibaatooyin xiidmeed ugu jiraan dhulalka kulul..."" (Because of respiratory problems with cold microbes, they have digestive problems in hot lands...). This directly links hot climates to digestive issues.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay soo-gaadhista joogtada ah ee u horseedi karta hoos u dhaca difaac jirka?","The correct answer is **B: Jeermiska deegaanka (Environmental germs)**.

The passage explicitly states that frequent exposure to environmental germs while at home can lead to immunity. Conversely, encountering new germs in other parts of the world is more likely to cause problems. Therefore, environmental germs are the source of the frequent exposure that can lead to a weakened immune defense.
"
Kuwan soo socdaa keebaa faa'iido u leh safarka gudaha aagga Schengen?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka fogaanshaha codsashada fiisaha badan**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a separate visa for each Schengen country. This saves time, money, and bureaucratic hassle.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Keydinta lacagta:** While saving on visa fees *is* a benefit, the primary point is about avoiding multiple applications. The text doesn't directly state that you save money in general.
* **C: Ka fogaanshiyaha isbaarooyinka badan ee kantaroolka baasaboorka:** The text mentions the *hubinta* (security checks) are numerous, but it doesn't say you avoid *isbaarooyinka badan* (many checkpoints) *within* the Schengen zone once you're in it.
* **D: Looma baahna baasaboor:** The text states you need a passport."
Maxaan hadda ka dib laga heli karin qabriga Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Hantidi**.

The text states: ""Taajiriinta ugu sareysa xabaalaha ma sii jiri doonaan in badan, lakin waa laga saaray Madxafka Masar ee Qahiro."" This translates to ""The most valuable treasures of the tomb will not exist for much longer, but have been removed to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo."" 

Therefore, the treasures (hantidi) are no longer in the tomb.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goobtee kamid ah Vancouver ayaa qarash ahaan waxyar kaga bixi doonaa qofka socdaalka ah ee aan qarashka badan inuu bixiyo aan rabin? ","The correct answer is **C: Jasiirada Bowen**.

Here's why:

The text states that Bowen Island is a popular day trip or short getaway offering hiking, mountain biking, shops, hotels, and more. It's accessible by a short ferry ride from Granville Island Market in Vancouver. This implies that a trip to Bowen Island is a relatively affordable option compared to places like Whistler. The passage also highlights that Bowen Island's community is ""health conscious"" and enjoys outdoor activities, suggesting it caters to those seeking a less expensive and more nature-focused experience.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Jasiirada Granville:** While a popular spot, the text describes Bowen Island as being accessible *from* Granville Island, suggesting it's a separate destination.
*   **B: Waddada Badda ilaa Cirka:** This isn't a location mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Firimbi yeeriyaha:** This isn't a location mentioned in the text.

"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Meeshee ku taal Vancouver waxay u badan tahay inay siiso socotada khibrad dhab ah?","The correct answer is **A: Jasiirada Bowen**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly describes Bowen Island as a place for outdoor activities like hiking and exploring, and highlights its natural beauty.** It mentions the healthy community and access to Howe Sound. This suggests a more authentic and less tourist-trap experience.
* **The passage describes Granville Island as having shops, hotels, and being easily accessible by ferry from downtown Vancouver, making it more of a commercial and tourist-oriented destination.**
* **The passage mentions Whistler as a popular ski resort, but also notes it's expensive.** While offering activities, the focus isn't on an authentic, everyday experience.
* **The passage doesn't mention a ""Firimbi yeeriyaha"" (a typo, likely meant to be ""Film studio"") or downtown Vancouver as providing a truly authentic experience.**

Therefore, based on the passage's description, Bowen Island is presented as the option most likely to offer a genuine and authentic experience."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayay tahay inay socdaalayaashu booqdaan daadaga biyaha haddii ay raadinayaan aragtiyo saxda ah ee wax ka qarinaayo jirin halka aay eegi rabaan?","The correct answer is **A: Nofeembar ilaa Maarso**.

The text explicitly states: ""xillli roobaadka (Noofeembar ilaa Maarso), xaddiga biyuhu wuu sarraynayaa Biya Dhacuna wuu xaraabo badnaanayaa."" (The rainy season (November to March), the water level is high and the Victoria Falls is very turbulent.)
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay kor u kaca booqashada dagaandaga biyaha ee Victoria inta u dhaxaysa Noofembar iyo Maarso?","The correct answer is **A: Muuqaalo cajiib ah oo ku saabsan dagaandaga biyaha oo aad u qurxooon**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""waxa aad loo huba in aad qoyneyso haddi aad gudubto buundada ama aad ku kor socoto biraha loo socdo biyaha buur ka soo dadanayo. Waxa aad u habboon tahay sababtoo ah mugga biyaha ayaa aad u sareeya illaa xad muuqaalka Biya Dhaca dhabta ah ay qariyaan - biyahaas oo dhami!"" This indicates that the water level is exceptionally high during the tourist season (November to March), creating a magnificent and unique view of Victoria Falls that isn't visible at other times.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dalxiisayaal yar** - The text says it's a popular place for both adventure and those seeking new experiences, implying many tourists.
*   **C: Ka fogaanshaha xilli roobaadka** - The question specifically asks about the *increase* in the water's power *during* the tourist season.
*   **D: Ka fogaanshaha xilli roobaadka** - This is the opposite of what the question is asking."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee kuwan soo socda aan lagu talin marka la isticmaalayo diyaarad aan duuliye lahayn si loo duubo filimka?","The correct answer is **A: In aad xili hore sii ogaato waxa la ogolyahay in aad duubto oo aad filim aad ka samayso.**

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes respecting privacy and legal restrictions.** Option A aligns with this by advising you to be informed *before* filming and to make sure you are allowed to do so.
* **Options B and C** refer to obtaining additional permits or permissions, which might be necessary but aren't the first step.  Being informed of the rules is a foundational step.
* **Option D** is risky and potentially illegal. Filming in areas where people won't notice isn't a substitute for proper permissions and could still violate privacy laws.  The text specifically warns against actions that are perceived as intrusive.



Therefore, being informed of and obtaining permission *before* filming is the most responsible and compliant approach."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, aaway meelaha ugu fiican ee filimada laga duubo iyadoo la isticmaalayo diyaarada aan duuliyaha lahayn?","The best answer is **C: Meelaha mashquulka ah ee aysan ka muuqanaynin diyuuradda aan duuliyaha lahayn.**

Here's why:

* **The original text emphasizes respecting privacy and avoiding unauthorized filming.** Option C directly aligns with this by suggesting locations where people are present but not focusing on them.
* **Option A is risky and potentially unethical.**  Even if people are present, filming them without their knowledge or consent can be problematic.
* **Option B is explicitly discouraged by the text.** It states not to try filming if it's not allowed.
* **Option D requires a specific permission (a permit), which isn't a universally applicable ""best place.""** The text is discussing general principles of respectful filming.



Therefore, **C** is the most appropriate answer based on the provided text.



"
"Si ku salaysan tuduca, bayaankee ku saabsan shuruudaha diiwaangelinta ee habka fiisaha aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **B: Wadamada oo dhami waxay u baahan yihiin in laga diiwaan geliyo maamulka deegaanka.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Wadamo qaar, waa inaad ka diiwaan geliso xukunka goobta joogitaankaada iyo halkaad degantahay."" (Some countries require you to register your location and where you are staying.)
* It also says: ""Mararka kale, kaliya kuwa jooga meel ka baxdan goobta deganaanshaha dalxiisayaasha ayaa u baahan is diwaan galin."" (Sometimes, only those staying outside the tourist's residence need to register.)
* **Therefore, the passage *doesn't* say that *all* countries require registration.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Haddii aad deganay hoyga dalxiiska, waxaa laga yaabaa inaadan u baahnayn inaad isdiiwaangeliso** - The passage says tourists *outside* their residence might need to register. This is a possibility, but not a certainty.
* **C: Booqashada xafiisyada socdaalka ayaa laga yaabaa in loo baahdo** - The passage mentions this as a *possibility*, but doesn't state it's a requirement.
* **D: Meelaha qaarkood, huteelada maxalliga ah ayaa samayni karaan diiwaangelinta** -  This is directly supported by the passage.



"
Kuwan soo socda kee baan ahayn meel uu dalxiisuhu tegi karo si uu samaystaan diiwaangelintooda?,"The correct answer is **C: Xafiiska boostada deegaanka**.

The text explicitly states that while police stations and immigration offices *may* be used for registration, hotels often handle it, and those staying outside their usual residence are sometimes the only ones required to register. The text does *not* mention post offices as a place for registration.
"
Yaa aan ka faa'iidaysan doonin mutadawacnimada marka ay safrayaan?,"The correct answer is **B: Qof raadinaya mushahar la taaban karo oo sareeyo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that volunteering often involves low pay or no salary. Therefore, someone specifically seeking a high, tangible salary would not benefit from volunteering.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible benefits of volunteering (as mentioned in the passage):

*   **A: Qof rajaynaya inuu saaxiibo cusub ku yeesho dibadda:** The passage mentions meeting new people as a benefit.
*   **C: Qof rajeynaya inuu barto xirfad cusub:** The passage mentions learning new skills as a benefit.
*   **D: Qof laga yaabo inuu xiiseynayo inuu qof martigaliyo haween:** While not explicitly stated, the passage mentions learning about a different perspective on life, and being a host/mentor could certainly contribute to that.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Sidee tabarucnimada markaad dibadda joogto faa'iido u leedahay socotada ku jirta miisaaniyada ama aadka u xisaabtamo?","The correct answer is **D: Waxay kaa caawin kartaa inaad hesho dareen aragtiyeed (It can help you gain a different perspective)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku noolaanshaha iyo tabaruc kaga shaqaynta waddan ajaanib waa qaab fiican oo aad ku baran karto dhaqan kale, kula kulmayso dad cusub, naftaada aad ku baranayso, **oo aad ku helayso dhinac kale oo wax laga arko** oo xitaa aad ku baran karto xirfad cusub.""

This directly supports the idea that working remotely while traveling offers a new perspective and broadens your understanding of the world. The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

* **A: Mushahar ayaa had iyo jeer la bixiyaa (Salary is always paid):** The passage mentions low pay for some remote work, so this isn't always true.
* **B: Caadiyan waxay keentaa fursado shaqo (It usually brings job opportunities):** While this *can* happen, the passage focuses more on the personal and cultural benefits of remote work.
* **C: Marigalinta xiliga haweenki ayaa mar mar la bixiyaa (Maternity leave is sometimes paid):** This is a specific benefit not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa loo tixgalin karaa in ay caadi tahay safarka celceliska ah ee lagu tagaayo Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **D: Ka raacitaanka baska garoonka diyaaradaha oo lagu tagaayo huteelka**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a typical Disney World trip involves flying into Orlando, taking a bus to a Disney hotel, spending a week at Disney property, and then returning home.  Option D directly reflects the initial part of that ""typical"" trip.  The passage also mentions that people are buying and selling multi-day tickets online, which suggests a certain level of familiarity and repetition, but Disney prohibits this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ku qaadashada toddobaadka sahaminta beeraha qaranka ee duurjoogta laga helo:** This has nothing to do with Disney World.
*   **B: Joogitaanka huteel ka baxsan goobta:** The passage describes staying at a *Disney* hotel.
*   **C: Ku qaadashada safarka oo dhan Disney property:** While a typical trip *includes* staying on Disney property, the passage's focus is on the entire *experience* and how some people are engaging in practices Disney prohibits.



"
Keebaa weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan Walt Disney World aan run ahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Tigidhada Park-hopper waxaa lagu wareejin karaa socotada kale (Park-hopper tickets can be transferred to other dates)**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""In kastoo tani ay tahay hawl caadi ah, haddana Disney way mamnuucday: tigidhadu waa qaar aan la beddeli karin (Although this is a common practice, Disney has banned it: tickets are non-transferable).""

Therefore, option A is the *untrue* statement. The other options are all supported by the text:

* **B: Waxaa jira hoy oo laga heli karo goobta (There is lodging available on site):** The text mentions staying at a Disney hotel.
* **C: Waxaa jira basas diyaar u ah inay dadka safarka ah ka soo qaadaan gegida dayuuradaha oo ay geeyaan ila dhismaha (There are buses available to pick up travelers from the airport and take them to the resort):** The text explicitly mentions buses transporting guests from the airport.
* **D: Tigidhada Multi-day ayaa inta badan laga heli karaa mareegaha xaraashka (Multi-day tickets are often available on resale websites):** The text mentions tickets being sold on eBay and Craigslist.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keeba arrimaha soo socda ayey u badan tahay in aan lagu baran fasal tababar xirfadeed ama daabacaado?","The correct answer is **D: Door ka ciyaaritaanka (Role-playing)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that the training includes ""doorka ciyaarta"" (role-playing).  The other options are mentioned or implied but not as directly highlighted as role-playing.

* **B: U diyaargarowga gargaarka degdegga ah (Preparation for first aid):**  The text states ""gargaaro kowaad badan"" (extensive first aid) is part of the training.
* **C: Diyaar garowga dagaal (War preparedness):** The text mentions ""marmarka qaar tababar hubab"" (sometimes weapons training), indicating a component related to conflict.
* **A: Badbaadada cidlada (Desert survival):** While the text mentions ""dhul dhireedka"" (arid lands), it doesn't specifically emphasize desert survival skills as a core component of the training.

Therefore, role-playing is the most directly and explicitly mentioned skill that Keeba likely won't learn solely from a formal training session or publications. It's a practical skill honed through experience.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Teeba maadooyinka soo socda ayey u badantahay in lagu barto fasalka tababarka xirfadda?","The correct answer is **A: Gargaarka degdega ah**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the training typically includes ""gargaaro kowaad badan"" (first aid). While the other options might be *related* to the training, first aid is specifically mentioned as a core component.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Goobaha dagaalka (Combat zones):** While the training *can* relate to combat zones, the text doesn't explicitly state that's a core subject. It mentions the training is for people planning to visit *conflict zones*, not necessarily to engage in combat.
*   **C: Badbaadada cidlada (Survival in the wilderness):** The text mentions books about wilderness survival, but doesn't say it's a key part of the *training* itself.
*   **D: Deegaanka jawigiisu adagyahay (Harsh environments):** Similar to wilderness survival, the text doesn't highlight training specifically focused on harsh environments.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay ikhtiyaarka ugu fiican ee lagaga hortagayo biyaha aay suurtagalka tahay in wasakh aay gaartay?","The correct answer is **B: Iibso biyo dhalo lagu so daboolay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of clean water sources and proper disinfection.** It specifically mentions that boiling can take a significant amount of time (more than a minute) and that the quality of disinfectants varies.
* **Buying bottled water from a reputable company is presented as a reliable way to ensure water is already purified.** This bypasses the need for boiling altogether and guarantees a certain level of safety.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Karkari biyaha dhowr daqiiqo** - The passage states that boiling can take *more* than a minute in some cases. This is less convenient and might not always be effective.
* **C: Karkari biyaha hal daqiiqo** - The passage implies one minute may not be sufficient for complete disinfection.
* **D: Qiimee biyaha madaama aay jiri karaan khatara gaar ah** - While assessment is good practice, the question asks for the *best* way to *prevent* contamination. Buying bottled water is a proactive preventative measure.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaasan suurtagal u noqoni karin xitaa dabal yaqaanada, kuwaas oo leh xirfada dabaasha ee loo baahan yahay?","The correct answer is **D: Ku dabaalashada hareeraha mawjadaha ama hirarka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hirarka xoogaan waa kuwaa kusoo noqnoqdaa mawjadaha oo burburiyaa xeebta, kuwaasoo intooda badan ka dhaca qar jabalo ah ama wax la mid ah. Qaab-dhismeedka dhulka ee biyaha hoostooda daraadeed, qulqulka soo noqonaya waxa laga yaabaa inay xoog ku yeelato qaybo qoto dheer, markaas waxa laga yaabaa in maayad xawaare sare leh halkaas ka samaysanto. Dhimashooyinka badankoodu waxay ka dhasheen iyadoo qofku isku dayayo inuu maayadda ka hortago, taasoo aan suuro gal ahaysn.""

This means waves and rip currents are dangerous and difficult to escape, even for skilled swimmers.  Therefore, swimming *around* waves and rip currents would be a risky activity.

The other options, while dangerous, aren't directly discouraged by the passage in the same way:

*   **A: Ku dabaalashada meelaha dagxaanta aadka ah leh:** Dangerous due to potential for injury from rocks.
*   **B: Ku dabaalashada biyaha qotada dheer:** Dangerous due to strong currents and potential for fatigue.
*   **C: Ku dabaalashada biyaaha qul qulaayo adiga oo ka hor imaanaya:** Dangerous due to the force of the churning water.



"
Maxaad samayn lahayd haddii aay biyaha socdaan aay ku qaadaan?,"The correct answer is **C: U dabaalo jiho lid ku ah jihada aay biyaha ku socdaano.**

Here's why:

The text describes how strong currents can form underwater and pull people out to sea. The best strategy is to swim *across* the current, perpendicular to its direction. This will allow you to escape the pull and eventually reach the shore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isku day inaad ka baxdo meesha aay biyaha ku qul qulayaan adiga oo dabaalanaya oo isku dayaaya inaad ka baxdo adigoo hiigsanaya jiho kale, ka dibna si caadi ah ugu so dabaalo xeebta:** While swimming away from the current is part of the solution, the phrasing is a bit confusing. ""Hiigsanaya jiho kale"" isn't specific enough.
* **B: Si degdeg ah ugu dabaalo adiga oo ka hor imaanaya halka aay biyaha ku qul qulayaan:** This is the *opposite* of what you should do. Swimming directly into the current will only exhaust you and push you further out to sea.
* **D: Ku dabaasho dusha sare ee biyaha:** This is not a reliable strategy. Currents can be strong even near the surface.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goobtee ayaa laga yaabaa in booqashada qalcadda ay tahay dalxiis fasax qiimo leh?","The correct answer is **C: Dooxada Rhine**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions ""buraha Rhine"" (Rhine castles) as an example of a beautiful location for sightseeing and vacations.  The other options are more general or less directly linked to the passage's specific examples.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keeba kuwaan soo socdaa noqon doonin talooyin lagula talinayo dumarka ku safraya goobta?","The correct answer is **C: Iska ilaali xidhashada dahabka ifaya**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly advises women to wear modest jewelry (even if not expensive) but doesn't mention avoiding flashy gold.**  The advice focuses on avoiding attracting unwanted attention due to their marital status.
* **A:** The text *specifically* advises women to avoid discussing their marital status.
* **B:** The text *directly* addresses the importance of respecting cultural differences and potential reactions.
* **D:** The text *strongly* encourages women to be assertive and stand by their decisions, which implies a need for self-reliance and resilience.

Therefore, avoiding flashy gold is the only option that isn't mentioned or implied in the provided travel advice.



"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan aagga lagu sharraxay tuducdu, maxay noqon doonaa tilmaan waxtar u leh oo loogu talagalay haweenka socotada ah?","The best answer is **C: Faham in kala duwanaanta dhaqameedku ay kuu soo jeedinayaan inaad diiddo inaad beddesho ra'yigaaga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of respecting cultural differences and not assuming universal customs.** It explicitly advises women to be aware that behaviors like holding hands can be interpreted differently.
* **The passage strongly encourages women to assert themselves and not be swayed from their decisions.** This aligns with the idea of standing firm in the face of potentially confusing or inappropriate cultural interactions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aqoonso inay tahay wax aan caadi ahayn in la raaco:** While the passage *does* mention unusual customs, it doesn't directly say women should *expect* to be followed.
* **B: Xiro faraanti weyn si aad u muujiso xaaladda guurka:** The passage advises wearing a *simple* (not expensive) scarf to indicate marital status, not a large one.
* **D: Kiisaska tijaabooyinka aan loo baahnayn, ku adkayso diidmada ragga:** While asserting oneself is encouraged, the passage doesn't specifically frame this as a response to ""unnecessary trials"" from men. It's a broader instruction to be firm in one's decisions.



Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the key message of the passage regarding navigating cultural differences and maintaining autonomy."
"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, xaaladdee ayaa u baahan karta sawir qaade duurjoogta ah inuu isticmaalo bikaac khaas ah?","The correct answer is **A: Haddii ay sawirayaan gaar ahaan makhluuqyada yaryar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""inkasto shimbiraha duula iyo noolaha kale ee yaryari ay u bahan yahiin qaar kale."" This translates to ""although birds and other small wildlife need others [for photography].""  This implies that a telephoto lens (a specialized type of lens) is needed to capture these small creatures, hence the mention of a ""bikaac khaas ah"" (special lens).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Hadii la doonaayo in sawirada loo isticmaalo arimo ganacsi:** While commercial use is a consideration, it doesn't directly necessitate a *special lens*.
* **C: Haddii xoolaha la sawiranayo ay yihiin kuwa carari karo:**  While challenging, photographing fleeing animals doesn't automatically require a specialized lens. A fast shutter speed and good tracking skills are more important.
* **D: Hadii beertu leedahay sharciyo gaar ah oo khuseeya sawir ka qaadista duurjoogta:**  Local regulations are a consideration for *where* you can photograph, not *how* you photograph.



"
Midkee kuwan soo socda aan lagu sheegin tuduca inay caqabad ku noqon karaan kuwa sawir qaadayaasha ah ee ka qaado sawirada xayawaanada duurjoogta ah?,"The correct answer is **C: Helitaanka nooca Bikaacooyinka loo baahanyahay**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly lists several challenges faced by wildlife photographers:

*   **Difficulty finding certain animals:** This is mentioned with the examples of elusive animals like leopards and the need for specific camera equipment. (A) is a valid challenge.
*   **Dangerous animals:** The passage states that wildlife can be dangerous and may flee or attack. (B) is a valid challenge.
*   **Environmental conditions:** The passage mentions harsh environments like extreme heat. (This is implied in the general difficulty mentioned).
*   **Legal restrictions:**  Gardens may have rules about commercial photography. (This is implied).
*   **Dealing with local communities:** Communities might pose difficulties or have concerns about photography. (D) is a valid challenge.

**The passage does *not* mention the difficulty of finding specific types of birds (Bikaacooyinka).** This option is not addressed in the text. Therefore, it's the answer that isn't listed as a challenge.



"
Keeba kuwan soo socdaa ay u badantahay in ay keeni doonto dhibaatada ugu yar ee qofka darawalka ah ee maraaya wadada buurta marto?,"The correct answer is **B: Dhulka oo xooga wadista dhib ku noqdo (Slightly bumpy road)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the danger of ice and snow.** Options A, C, and D all relate to conditions *caused by* ice and snow (slippery roads, reduced visibility, and fatigue from trying to navigate).

* **Option B, a slightly bumpy road, is the least likely to be directly caused by or exacerbated by icy conditions.** While icy roads *could* be bumpy due to uneven ice, a slightly bumpy road isn't inherently linked to the hazardous conditions described. It's a minor inconvenience compared to the dangers of ice.

Therefore, a slightly bumpy road is the least problematic scenario among the choices when dealing with potential icy mountain roads.
"
Maxay u badan tahay inay sii ahaato mid joogto ah oo ku saabsan cashuurta dakhliga ee waddamo kala duwan?,"The correct answer is **A: Heerarka (Rates)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""heerka canshuurtuna waa uu kala duwan yahay wadan walba"" (tax rates vary from country to country). This directly addresses the question of what is likely to be a constant aspect of income tax across different countries.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Qab-dhismaha (Structure):** While tax structures differ (e.g., progressive, regressive), the passage focuses more on the *rates* themselves.
* **C: Halka aad ka fayl garaaysato (Where you file):**  This is a procedural detail, not a constant feature of income tax.
* **D: Garbaha (Bracket):** While tax brackets exist, the *rates* within those brackets are the more consistent and frequently changing aspect.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, haddii aad dibadda ka shaqaynayso balse saldhigaagu uu yahay meel kale, Halkee ayay u badan tahay in aad xaraynayso ama aad ka fayl garaysocashuurta dakhligaaga?","The correct answer is **A: Mel walbo oo had iyo jeer aad ku salaysantahay oo saldhigaagu yahay**.

Here's why:

The passage states that tax obligations are generally tied to the country where you are *resident* (degan tahay).  ""Saldhig"" (base) implies residency.  Therefore, regardless of where you work, your tax filing will likely be based on the country where you are considered a resident.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dalka Maraykanka (The United States):** The passage mentions the US as an example of a federal system, but it doesn't say that everyone working abroad owes taxes to the US.
*   **C: Dalka aad hadda ka shaqaynayso (The country where you are currently working):** While the country you work in might have some tax implications, it's not the primary factor determining where you file your income tax.
*   **D: Meel kasta oo khidmadaha ay yihiin kuwa ugu hooseeya (Any place where services are cheapest):** This option is irrelevant to tax obligations."
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin Bandhigga Adduunka?,"The correct answer is **B: Bandhigyada sayniska dhirta waxaa lagu soo bandhigay bandhig faneed iyo waxbarasho**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Bandhiga Adduunku waa bandhig sayniseed iyo faneed caalami ah."" (The World Expo is an international science and art exhibition.)
* Option B accurately reflects this dual nature of the Expo.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: Bandhigyadu waxay muujin karaan taariikhda ama dhaqanka waddanka:** While the text mentions pavilions showcasing the history, culture, and traditions of countries, it's not the *defining* characteristic. The Expo is broader than just cultural displays.
* **C: Dhacdooyinka waxay socon karaan ilaa lix bilood:** The text says events *can* last 3-6 months, but it doesn't state they *always* do.
* **D: Waddamada loogama baahna inay ka qaybqaataan:** The text implies that countries *do* participate, as it describes national pavilions.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee qaanuunka Bandhigga Adduunka ama Bandhiga Caalamiga ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Isla waddanku ma martigelin karo dhacdooyinka sannadlaha ah**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""intay waddamo kala duwan ka dhacayaan"" (different countries host it), and ""balse uma dhici karaan"" (but they don't necessarily happen annually). This directly supports the idea that a single country doesn't host it every year.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bandhigyadu waa inay soo bandhigaan taariikhda waddanka iyo arrimaha adduunka labadaba:** While the text mentions countries showcasing their culture, history, and world situations, it *doesn't* say it's a strict requirement for all exhibits.
* **C: Dhacdooyinka waa inay socdaan ilaa lix bilood:** The text mentions that the event *can* last three to six months, but it doesn't state it's a mandatory duration.
* **D: Si Bandhiga loo qabto, waa in dalalka oo dhan ay ka qayb qaataan:** The text explicitly says ""intay waddamo kala duwan ka dhacayaan"" (different countries host it), implying not all countries participate in every instance.

Kuwa soo socda kee baa hoos u dhigi kara suurtagalnimada in weerar uu sababo xayawaan?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka fogaanshaha yeeyda masaafo 25 yaardi ujirto.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sida ay u egyihiin xayawaano deggan, lo'gisida nooca loo yaqaano bison, deerada loo yaqaano elk, oorsada, iyo xayawaanadda waa wayn intooda badan wey ku weeraari karaan. Sanad walba waxaa la daweeya darsino dhaawaca maxaa yeelay ma aysan sifiican ukala fogaan Xayawaanadan ayaa aad u weyn, duur jooga, lagana yaaba in ay aad halis u yihiin, marka nabad gali."" (Even though they are generally peaceful, animals like bison, elk, bears, and most large wild animals can be aggressive. Injuries are treated annually because they don't easily avoid animals. These animals are large, wild, and can be dangerous, so be careful.)

The passage also warns: ""Ka war haay qataro soo jiidan karo waxyabaha aad qadaneyso sida xayawaanada duurjoogta, sida darted ka fogow inad soo qadato cunto karsan iyo sidoo kale in aad ilaaliso nadafada mesha aad degi doonto."" (Be aware of dangers that can attract injuries from wild animals, so avoid bringing out cooked food and also take care to maintain the cleanliness of the fire you will live in.)

Option C directly addresses avoiding a potential dangerous encounter by maintaining a safe distance. The other options are not directly related to minimizing the risk of a wildlife attack.



"
Kuwa soo socda keebaa aan lagu xusin tuducda inay tahay sababta suurtogalka ah ee keeni karta weerarada aay sababaan xayawaanada duur joogta ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku guuldareysiga ilaalinta fogaanta ama masaafada**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sida ay u egyihiin xayawaano deggan, lo'gisida nooca loo yaqaano bison, deerada loo yaqaano elk, oorsada, iyo xayawaanadda waa wayn intooda badan wey ku weeraari karaan. Sanad walba waxaa la daweeya darsino dhaawaca maxaa yeelay ma aysan sifiican ukala fogaan Xayawaanadan...marka nabad gali.

This highlights that failing to maintain distance and precautions is a significant factor contributing to encounters and potential attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shiirta ama urka xoogan** - The passage doesn't mention this as a cause.
*   **C: Quudinta duurjoogta** - The passage explicitly warns *against* feeding wildlife.
*   **D: Xayawaanada aan aqoonta u lahayn aadanaha** - This isn't directly stated as the reason for attacks. The passage focuses more on the danger of getting too close.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwaan soo socda kee baa loo arkaa xal mustaqbalka fog ah oo lagu xalin karo arimaha deegaanka?","Correct answer is **C: Aqoonsiga sababta mashaakilka (Identifying the root cause of the problem)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Hagee aynaan rabin xal ku meelgaara, waa inaynu raadinaa asalka mushkiladda markaas, waana inaynu halkaas ka soo joojino"" (If we don't want a temporary solution, we should look for the root cause of the problem and stop there).  This means identifying the underlying reason for environmental issues is the key to a lasting solution.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Qaadicida doorashada hab nololeedka qaaliga ah (Choosing a luxurious lifestyle)** - The text implies that a luxurious lifestyle contributes to the problem (overpopulation, consumption). It's *not* presented as a solution.
* **B: Dhaqdhaqaaqa (Activisms)** - While the text mentions activisms as one potential approach, it doesn't frame it as the ultimate, long-term solution.
* **D: Noqoshada xulufada dhaqdhaqaaqa deegaanka (Forming alliances of environmental activists)** -  Similar to activisms, alliances are a *tool* to achieve a solution, but not the solution itself.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, xalalkaan soo socda kee baan loo tix galin doonin daawayn calaamad u ah arimaha deegaanka?","The correct answer is **B: Dabar jarka sababaha asaasiga ee mashaakilka**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Way iska caddahay in adduunku isu beddelay horumarka dhanka sayniska iyo tiknoolajiyadda aadamuhu sameeyeen daraadood, oo ay dhibaatooyinkuna sii waynaadeen tirada dadka oo xad-dhaaf noqotay iyo qaab nololeedka tagrifalka ah ee aadamaha dartood.""  This means the author believes the *root causes* of environmental problems are linked to scientific and technological advancements and unsustainable lifestyles.

The passage contrasts addressing symptoms (like ""Dhexgelka dhaqdhaqaaq yada,"" ""Codayn fikradeed oo ku saabsan doorashada qaab nololeedka xad dhaafka ah,"" and ""U noolaanshaha hab deegaan ahaan u wanaagsan"") with finding and fixing the underlying causes. Therefore, **focusing on just treating the symptoms (dabar jarka sababaha asaasiga ee mashaakilka)** would *not* be the preferred solution according to the text.

The other options *are* presented as potential solutions or approaches discussed in the passage.

The text explicitly states: ""Dagaalkii Awood-wareegga ee Isbaanishka (Spanish Succession) wuxuu noqday dagaalki ugu horeeyay ee qadiyadda ugu weyn ahayd dheellitirka awoodaha."" (The War of Spanish Succession was the first war where the main issue was the balance of power.)

Therefore, the war that first centered on the balance of power, rather than religious issues, was the War of Spanish Succession, involving Spain.
"
Dagaalkee ayaa mararka qaar lagu tilmaamaa inuu ahaa ‘dagaal diimeedkii’ ugu dambeeyay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dagaalkii sodonka sano (Thirty Years' War)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sidaa daraadeed, Dagaalkii Soddonka Sanno ayaa noqonaya dagaalkii ugu dambeeyay dagaal diimeed lagu magacaabo."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War became the last war called a religious war.)
"
Midkee kamida dhinacyada soo socda ee kaniisada katooliga ee aan la baarin?,"The correct answer is **C: Diirad saarista awood qaybsiga kaniisada dhexdeeda.**

Here's why:

*   The passage highlights the concentration of power and wealth in the Catholic Church, particularly in Rome. It mentions questions about whether this concentration was justified and led to people questioning the principles of the Church.
*   Option C directly addresses this issue of power distribution within the Church, which is a central concern raised in the text.
*   Options A, B, and D are less directly addressed. While the passage discusses the use of wealth and principles, it doesn't explicitly focus on whether wealth redistribution was good, if principles were altered, or if the most important principles were identified. It focuses more on the *concentration* of power and wealth as the core issue sparking debate.

Therefore, the question asks what aspect of the Catholic Church wasn't examined in the passage, and the answer is the distribution of power within the Church, as that's the underlying tension the passage explores."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yaa lagu dilay Versailles?","The correct answer is **D: Waardiye (Guard)**.

The passage states: ""qof ka mid ah kacdoonka ayaa u ruxay maddaxa ilaaliyaha boqortooyada oo lagu dilay Versailles boqoradda horteeda."" This translates to: ""Someone from the uprising struck the head of the royal guard and killed him in front of the Queen at Versailles.""
"
Kee baa ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan qaswadayaashu ku qasbin Boqorka iyo Boqorada?,"The correct answer is **A: Furitaanka daaqadaha gaarigooda**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Markoo, qof ka mid ah kacdoonka ayaa u ruxay maddaxa ilaaliyaha boqortooyada oo lagu dilay Versailles boqoradda horteeda. Dadkii buuqayay ayaa Boqorka iyo Boqorada ku qasbay inay daaqadohooda furaan.""  This directly indicates the crowd forced them to open their windows.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bixitaan degdega ah ee Versailles:** While the entire event was forced, the passage doesn't specifically say they were forced to leave Versailles *immediately*. They were forced to open windows *before* likely being forced to leave.
* **C: Daawashada madax goynta waardiyaha:** The passage says the head of the guard was beheaded, but it doesn't say the crowd forced the King and Queen to *watch* the beheading.
* **D: Safar dib ugu laabashada Paris:** The passage mentions the trip to Paris happened *after* the crowd forced them to open their windows. The forcing of the windows was a prerequisite to the trip.



"
Midkee kamida kuwaan soo socda ee an ka dhalan dagaalkii ciidamada badda Ingiriiska ee aan caadiga ahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Rabitaanka Jarmalku inuu adeegsado xeelado dagaal oo la mid ah**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Maadama ay jirtay jawaab qorsho xadidan, Jarmalka waxa ay filaayen mid lamida xaaladooda xadid la'aan ee dagaalka biyaha.""  This directly indicates that Germany's intention to employ similar naval warfare tactics to Britain's was a direct consequence of Britain's actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maraakiib aan lug ku lahayn ayaa la dhigay dariiqa waxyeello:** The passage mentions the laying of mines, but not specifically ""ships without legs"" being placed in the way. While mines are a form of naval warfare, this isn't the *direct response* the passage highlights.
* **C: Waxaa isbedel lagu sameeyay sharciga caalamiga ah:** The passage states that Britain's actions *violated* international law, but it doesn't say the law was *changed* as a result.
* **D: Sahayda muhiimka ah lama heli karin:**  The passage doesn't mention any scarcity of supplies.



Therefore, the passage clearly points to Germany's desire to mirror Britain's unconventional naval warfare as a key outcome of the situation.



"
Weedhee ayaan si sax ah u qeexayn go'doominta badda ee Britain ee ka dhanka ah Jarmalka?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxay ka hor timid sharciga caalamiga ah.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Istraatiijiga ayaa ahaa mid waxtar leh, isagoo ka xiraayo kaalmo ciidan ama shacab, inkastoo go’doomintan ay burisay sharci caalami oo la wada ogolahay oo lagu ansixiyay heshiisyo caalami oo labada qarni lasoo dhaafay."" This directly indicates that the blockade violated international law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Waxay keentay dagaalkii gujisyada ee Jarmalka:** While the blockade contributed to tensions, the passage doesn't state it *caused* a naval war.
* **C: Waxay joojisay qulqulkii sahaydii Jarmalka:** The blockade was designed to *prevent* German ships from accessing the sea, not necessarily to stop German shipping altogether.
* **D: Waxay hubisay in maraakiibta dhexdhexaadka ah aan la halis gelin doonin:** The passage says the blockade *endangered* neutral ships, the opposite of what this option claims.



"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan qoraalka, yaa u badan in laga helo Cudurka Dareemyaasha (Sclerosis Multiple)?","The correct answer is **C: 43 sano jir lab ah**

Here's why:

* **The text states that women are twice as likely to get MS than men.**
* **Option C presents a 43-year-old woman.** This aligns with the higher prevalence in women.
* The other options present either men or very young ages, which are less likely based on the information given.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay ka qaybgalayaasha dhaqdhaqaaqyada joogtada ah waxay ugu baahdaan taageero dheeraad ah?","The correct answer is **A: Aragtida xun ee xanuunka (Misconception of pain)**.

The passage states: ""Kuwa ka qeyb qaadanaye sameynta ficilo joogta ayaa u baahna caawinad marka loo fiiriyo iska dhaadhicinta fikrad qaldan ee kala saarida xanuun daran iyo dareenka kahashada ka dhasha dhaqdhaqaaqa jirka caadiga.""  This directly translates to needing help with a *misconception* or *incorrect understanding* of pain.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dhabarka hoose (Lower back)** - While the context is lower back pain, the passage isn't specifically about the lower back itself.
* **C: Walbahaar (Anxiety)** - Anxiety is mentioned as a factor *before* the impact of the disaster, but the passage focuses on the misconception of pain *after* the disaster.
* **D: Cabsi (Fear)** - Similar to anxiety, fear is mentioned as a preceding factor, not the core issue needing support as stated in the passage.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sidee loo ciyaaraa dayrka?","The correct answer is **D: Qaab kala reeb ah (Dual format)**.

The text states: ""Ciyaaraha waxaa marka ugu horeysay oo ciyaaray laba hab, mid ah farad fulida iyo ku darida mid kale."" This translates to: ""The sports are initially played in two formats, one of individual performance and the other of addition.""  ""Ku darida"" (addition) refers to a combined or dual format.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa noqon lahaa tilmaame kan ugu xoogan ee sumowga gudaha?","The correct answer is **B: Matag iyo dhidid (Vomiting and diarrhea)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Calaamadaha, sida mataga ayaa kuwo guuda mana ahan mid markiiba baaritaan dag daga lagu sameyn karo..."" (Symptoms, such as vomiting, are general and cannot be immediately tested for...)

This implies that vomiting and diarrhea are common, general symptoms associated with internal poisoning that wouldn't immediately point to a specific toxin.  The other options are more specific and could indicate a particular type of poisoning.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, waa maxay talaabada koowaad ee ku haboon marka la qiimaynayo dhibbanaha?","The correct answer is **A: U fiirso goobta (Assess the area)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Si aad u eegto dulmanaha, waa inaad marka hore aagga kormeertaa si aad hubiso badbaadadaada."" (Before assessing the victim, you must first assess the area to ensure your safety.)

Therefore, assessing the area is the first and most important step.
"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah uga tarjumeynin habka hubinta dhibbanaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha ka welwelin inaad usii adkaysato dhaawacyadaada (Don't endure your injuries)**.

Here's why:

* The original text emphasizes **safety first** and assessing the situation *before* attempting to help. It warns against escalating the situation by trying to assist without understanding the risks.

* Option A, ""Don't endure your injuries,"" is completely unrelated to the concept of assessing the scene and ensuring safety *before* helping someone with injuries.  It's about personal self-preservation *after* an injury has occurred, not about the initial assessment.

Let's look at why the other options *are* relevant to the text:

* **B: Qiimee goobta ka hor dhibbanaha (Assess the scene before the injured person):** Directly reflects the text's first point about checking the area for safety and potential hazards.
* **C: U fiirso booska dhibbanaha (Examine the location of the injured person):**  Related to assessing the scene for context and potential dangers.
* **D: Isku day inaad u feejignaato calaamad walba oo cas (Try to be aware of every red flag):**  Aligns with the text's mention of ""calamo cas oo otomaatig ah"" (automatic red flags) and avoiding escalating the situation.



Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't reflect the core message of safety and assessment presented in the original text.



"
Isbadalada uu keenay Kacaankii Faransiiska kee baa saameyn weyn ku yeeshay muwaadiniinta dabaqada shaqaalaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Diiradda oo laga wareejiyay fasalka oo loo wareejiyay awood-kartiyed**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kacdoonka ka dib shaqooyinka ayaa u furnaayeen dhamaan ragga soo codsaday taasi oo u ogolaatay in kuwa ogu hammiga badan oo na ogu guusha badan inay ku guuleystaan."" This means that the revolution opened up opportunities for people regardless of their social class, shifting the focus from class-based hierarchies to merit and ability.
* The passage also mentions: ""Taasi ayaa la mid ah ciidanka maxaa yeelay inta ciidanka lagu darajayn lahaa fasalka waxay ku salaysan yiin nooca."" This further emphasizes that individuals were being judged on their capabilities rather than their social standing.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Taageerada qaranka oo kordhay:** While national support increased, the core impact on the working class wasn't simply increased support; it was a shift in how opportunities were accessed.
* **C: Qaadashada fikirka Jamhuuriga:** The passage mentions the taking of republican ideals but the primary impact on the working class wasn't solely about adopting those ideals.
* **D: Nidaamka cabbiraadda cusub:**  The passage doesn't discuss the introduction of a new measurement system.



Therefore, option B best captures the significant impact of the French Revolution on the working class, which was a shift from class-based distinctions to a system based on ability and merit."
"Kacaankii Faransiiska ka dib, in guulo laga gaaro ciidamada iyo shaqooyinka kale maxaynan u badnayn in lagu saleeyay?","The correct answer is **C: Hami (Ambition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the revolution, jobs became available to anyone who applied, allowing ""those most ambitious and most successful"" to succeed. This directly links success in the military and other areas to ambition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Guul gaarid (Success)** - While success was a *result* of ambition, the question asks what success *was often based on*.
*   **B: Fasal (Class)** - The passage explicitly *rejects* class-based systems, comparing it unfavorably to the pre-revolution military.
*   **D: Heer (Rank)** - Rank is a position within a hierarchy, and the passage emphasizes ambition over established ranks.



"
Waa kee adeegga dadwayne ee la sheegay in uu sababay ka xumaansho kii ugu badnaa ee dalalka horumaray?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaadiidka dadwaynaha (Public Transportation)**.

The provided text highlights that developed nations rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges. This suggests that public transportation is the system prone to problems, leading to complaints. The question then asks which public service is blamed for the worst deterioration in developed countries, further confirming that public transportation is the intended answer.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa laga dhihi karaa nidaamyada gaadiidka dadweynaha?","The correct answer is **B: Ma ahan ku u liita sida tayada biyaha oo kale**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that in developed countries, complaints about the quality of water and failing electricity are rare. 
* The passage then asks *why* transportation systems *aren't* experiencing similar widespread complaints.
* This implies that transportation systems are *better* than water quality or electricity in terms of not generating widespread complaints.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aad baa looga jecel yahay dhanka qof kasta oo isticmaala:** The passage doesn't say anything about people liking transportation systems. It focuses on the *lack* of complaints.
* **C: Waxay sababtay cabasho badan oo ka timid dhanka dadka isticmaala:**  The passage states the opposite – that complaints about transportation are *rare* in developed countries.
* **D: Waa bilaash inta badan wadamada horumaray:** The passage doesn't mention the cost of transportation.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee ayaa adkaan kara in la qiyaaso sababtuna ay tahay in aan la saadaalin karin darawaliinta?","The correct answer is **A: Xawaaraha gaadiidka (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Barashada kala hagista baabuurtu ma fududa sababtoo ah hab dhaqanka dirawalka ayaan la saadaalin karin boqolkiiba boqol.""  This directly relates to traffic flow, which is heavily influenced by unpredictable driver behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qorshaynta waddada (Road planning):** Road planning can account for general traffic patterns and volume, even with some unpredictability.
*   **C: Hawlgalada waddooyinka (Road operations):** Road operations involve managing traffic through signals, signage, and other methods, aiming to maintain a functional flow.
*   **D: Qulqulka gaadiidka (Vehicle traffic):** While the unpredictable behavior of drivers affects vehicle traffic, the passage identifies the difficulty of *predicting* driver behavior as the core problem.

Therefore, the unpredictable nature of drivers directly makes **xawaaraha gaadiidka (traffic flow)** the most difficult to quantify.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa la adeegsadaa marka la matalayo qulqulka gaadiidka xisaab ahaan?,"The correct answer is **A: Hawlgalada waddooyinka (Traffic Operations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the mathematical modeling of traffic relies on three key aspects:

*   **Qulqulka (Traffic flow)**
*   **Cufnaanta (Congestion)**
*   **Xawaaraha socodka (Travel speed)**

These elements are used to mathematically model how traffic *operates* on roadways.  ""Hawlgalada waddooyinka"" directly refers to the management and analysis of traffic movement on roads, which is the core of traffic flow modeling.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Dhaqanka darawalka (Driver behavior)** - While driver behavior *influences* traffic, it's not the primary aspect *modeled* mathematically. The passage specifically mentions that driver behavior is unpredictable, making it difficult to directly incorporate into a mathematical model of traffic flow.
*   **C: Naqshadaynta waddada (Road design)** - Road design is important, but it's a prerequisite for traffic flow; the mathematical model *analyzes* the flow, not the design itself.
*   **D: Cufnaanta gaadiidka (Traffic congestion)** - Congestion is one of the three aspects being modeled, but it's not the overall *operations* of the traffic."
Maxay Hershey iyo Chase isticmaaleen si ay u beeraan DNA-gooda? ,"The correct answer is **C: Baaruud shucaac leh**.

Here's why:

The question states they used radiation to label the DNA. The correct option that reflects this is ""Baaruud shucaac leh"" which translates to ""radiation powder"" or ""radiation with powder"" in English.  They used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA, and they used radioactive sulfur to label the protein.
"
The ability for a mutation to be passed on to offspring is dependent upon what?,"The correct answer is **C: Nooca isku beddelka (The type of mutation)**.

Here's why:

The original text explicitly states: ""Kaliya isbadalka unug yada germ-line oo kaliya ayee caruurtu dhaxli karaan..."" This means only germline mutations (mutations in reproductive cells - sperm and egg) can be passed on. The type of mutation (whether it's a point mutation, deletion, insertion, etc.) determines if it occurs in a germline cell or a somatic cell.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Haddii unugyadu yihiin xariiq jeermis (If the cells are bacterial pathogens):**  While mutations can occur in bacterial pathogens, this isn't the determining factor for whether a mutation is heritable in *general*.
* **B: Muhiimada walxaha hidde-sidaha (The importance of the genetic material):** The importance of the gene doesn't dictate heritability; it dictates the effect of the mutation.
* **D: Haddii isbeddelku uu keeni karo dhimashada unugyada (If the mutation can cause cell death):**  While some mutations that cause cell death are harmful, the ability to be passed on is more directly tied to the *type* of mutation and *where* it occurs.  Cell death can happen in either germline or somatic cells.



"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo macluumaadka lagu sheegay qoraalka, maxay saamaynaha kala duwan ee isu-beddelku aanay ku tiirsanayn?","The correct answer is **C: Muhiimadda maaddada hidde-sidaha ee ay saamaysay.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Isbedeladda qaybta dhaxalka ku yimaado ayaa saamayn kala duwan lahaan karo, oo ku xiran **muhiimadda qaybtaas dhexaalka la sameeyey**...""  This directly connects the impact of the mutation to the importance of the affected gene/section.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Intee in le'eg ayaa maaddada hidde-sidaha ay saamaysay:** The passage doesn't mention the *amount* of the gene affected, only the *importance* of the section.
* **B: Haddii unugyada cudurka qaba ay yihiin xariiq jeermis:**  This is irrelevant to the passage's focus on genetic mutations.
* **D: Nooca isku beddelka ee cudurka qaba:** While the type of mutation *is* a factor, the passage specifically highlights the *importance* of the affected section as a key determinant of the impact.  The importance is a broader concept than just the type of mutation.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan sabab u ahayn in dhaqamadii hore ay ariga u hayn jireen?,"The correct answer is **B: Waxay ka cawiyeen daaqsintii dhulka (They helped with the cultivation of the land)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that early cultures herded animals (sheep, goats, etc.) for meat, milk, and hides.  This is directly related to the practice of raising livestock.

* **A: Waxay u sahleen helitaanka hilibka (They made it easier to obtain meat)** -  This is a direct benefit of raising livestock.
* **C: Waxay u bandhigeen wehelnimo (They demonstrated companionship)** -  People often form bonds with their animals.
* **D: Waxay u sahleen helitaanka caanaha (They made it easier to obtain milk)** -  This is another direct benefit of raising livestock.

However, herding animals doesn't directly help with cultivation (growing crops).  It's a completely different agricultural practice.

Therefore, option B is the answer that is *not* a reason why early cultures raised livestock.

Hadafka Golfku waa in la qaato inta ugu yar ee maxay ah?,"The correct answer is **D: Godad**

The passage states: ""Hadafka Golfku waa in la qaato inta ugu yar ee **godad**."" (The goal of Golf is to take the fewest number of **holes**.)
"
"Garoonka golf-ka, xagee cawska si gaaban lo jaray?","The correct answer is **A: Godka siddeed iyo tobnaad (The 18th hole)**.

The text states: ""ciyaartoyga kuwa sameya weerarada kooban, ama werarayo kooxda, si ay u dhameestiran guusha. Ciyaarta waxaa lagu ciyaaraya cawska, cawskana godka ag dhowrna waa la gaabiyaa oo loo baxshaa cagaaar."" This translates to: ""Players who make short attacks, or attack the green, to achieve victory. The game is played on the fairway, and the pin near the hole is shortened and a flag is inserted.""  The ""pin near the hole"" is located in the hole, and the 18th hole is the final hole of the golf course, so that's where the flag (and therefore the shortened pin) would be.



"
Kee baa ah u jeedada caadigaa ee tijaabada?,"The correct answer is **A: Si loo dabar jaro hal iyo in ka badan mala-awaalo dhici kara.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tijaabo khibradeedba ay yiitay tijaabo loo isticmaalo in lagu tirtiro mid kamida fikrad-qaadashada ugu macquulsan, su'aalo waydiin, iyo indho indhaynta ayaa sidoo kale ah hagaha cilmi baadhis aqoon ku dhisan.""

This indicates that experiments are used to *test* ideas and hypotheses, and to eliminate possibilities.  Option A best captures this meaning of testing to eliminate possibilities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Si loo ogaado sida dunidu u shaqeyso:** While understanding how the world works is a goal of science, the passage describes experiments as a method to *test* ideas *about* how the world works, not to understand the world itself.
*   **C: Si loo soo bandhigo su'aalo:** Experiments are used to answer questions, not to generate them.
*   **D: Si loo hago cilmi baaris cilmiyeed:** This is too broad. Experiments are *part* of scientific research, but the passage focuses on their specific function within that process.

"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay baan ku caawinayn hagida cilmi baarista cimiyeed?","The correct answer is **A: Habka cilmiyeed oo kali ah**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kaligiis maaha inkastoo khibradayn iyo tijaabo khibradeedba ay yiin tijaabo loo isticmaalo in lagu tirtiro mid kamida fikrad-qaadashada ugu macquulsan, su'alo waydiin, iyo **indho indhaynta ayaa sidoo kale ah hagaha cilmi baadhis aqoon ku dhisan**.""

This means the scientific method *alone* isn't enough. It needs to be combined with questioning, observation, and other approaches to guide scientific research. Options B, C, and D are all mentioned as ways the scientific method *does* guide research, therefore A is the only incorrect option.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, weedhee ayaa ku saabsan duufaanada oo aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **D: Duufaannada qaarkood waxay yeelan karaan dabaylo ilaa 300 mayl saacaddii goynaya.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that some tornadoes have winds reaching **480 km/h (133 m/s; 300mph)**.
* Option D incorrectly states 300 mph.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Duufaanadu waxay awood u leeyihiin inay burburiyaan wax walba oo nawaaxigooda soo gala:** This is directly supported by the sentence ""They can destroy anything in their path.""
* **B: Duufaanadu waxay ku dhuftaan meelo ka yar-yar marka loo eego duufaanada waawayn:** The text states tornadoes affect smaller areas compared to other storms.
* **C: Inta badan duufaanada waxay socdaan in ka badan saddex saacadood:** The text says ""Tornadoes that are 20% or more violent can last over three hours.""



Therefore, only option D contains incorrect information according to the passage.
"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, keebaa weedhahan soo socda si sax ah u qeexaya badi duufaanada?","The correct answer is **A: Caadi ahaan waxay socdaan in ka badan saddex saacadood**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Duufaamada boqolkiiba labada ugu rabshada badan ayaa socdo ka badan saddex saacadood."" (The 2% most violent tornadoes last over three hours.)
* Option A directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Waxay abuuraan dabaylo ku dhawaad 480 mayl goynaya saacaddii** - While the passage mentions wind speeds of up to 480 km/h, it doesn't say *all* tornadoes create those winds, nor does it state that this is typical. It specifically mentions the most violent ones.
* **C: Waxay saameeyaan meelo ka weyn marka loo eego duufaanada waawayn** - The passage states tornadoes affect a *small* area compared to other storms. This is the opposite of what option C says.
* **D: Waxay awoodaan inay geedaha dhulka ka soo rujiyaan** - The passage mentions tornadoes *can* uproot trees, but it doesn't say that this is a defining characteristic of *most* tornadoes.



"
Kuwa soo socda kee baa dadku bilaabay inuu sameeyo qarnigii 16aad?,"The correct answer is **C: Samaynta muraayadaha (Making lenses)**.

The passage states: ""Diiraduhu waxay adeegsadaan isku darka laba bikaac si ay waxyaabaha fog ugu muujiyaan qaar sidii hore ka dhow oo ka waawayn. Diiraduhu waxay noqdeen diiradii ugu horaysay ee Yurub lagu sameeyay dhammaadkii qarnigii 16aad."" (Lenses used the combination of two glass pieces to show distant objects as closer and larger. Lenses became the first focus made in Europe at the end of the 16th century.)

Options A, B, and D are incorrect because the passage focuses specifically on the emergence of lenses in Europe during the 16th century.
"
Intee in le'eg ayay dadku waynaynayeen walxaha iyagoo isticmaalaya muraayadaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Kumanaan sanadood**.

The passage states: ""Bini aadamku waxay bikaacyada sameynayeen una adeegsanayeen waynaynta kumanaan kun oo sannadood."" (Humans have been making and using lenses for tens of thousands of years.)

While the passage also mentions the first lenses in Europe were made in the 16th century, the question asks about the *duration* of lens use for magnification, which the passage clearly states was tens of thousands of years.
"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, muxuu godka uu Nabi Muxammad ka sheegayaa dhaqamadiisa ruuxiga ah ama qiyamkiisa?","The best answer is **C: Waxa uu u baahday wakhti aad u yar keligiis.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Maxamed (Muhammad) would regularly go to a secluded place called ""Hira"" in the ""Noor"" (Light) mountain to think. This strongly indicates a need for solitude and time alone for spiritual reflection.
* The description of the cave being difficult to find and hidden reinforces the idea that he sought isolation.
* The passage mentions him receiving divine revelations (""xasuusta kal gacal ee darenkisa diini""), suggesting his time in the cave was crucial for his spiritual practice.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Wuxuu qiimeeyaa nabadda iyo gooni u baxa** While solitude can lead to peace, the passage doesn't directly state that he values peace and seclusion *as a principle*. It describes his *practice* of seeking seclusion.
* **B: Sawaxanka dibadda ayaa kaa caawin kara yogada** This is completely unrelated to the passage.
* **D: Wuxuu aad uga welwelsanaa in la arko oo la maqlo** The passage implies the opposite - he actively sought out a hidden place to *avoid* being seen or heard.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the core message of the passage regarding Muhammad's spiritual habits.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa birta loo isticmaali jiray marka hore?","The correct answer is **A: Isgoysyada (Planks)**.

The passage states: ""Inkastoo wadooyinka gawaarida xoolaha jiidayeen ay ka sameysnaayeen oo keli ah labo alwaax oo isgarab socday..."" which translates to ""Although the roads for horse-drawn wagons were made of only two planks that interlocked...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: wagonways** - This is the name of the roads themselves, not the material.
*   **C: Taayirrada (Pipes/Tubes)** -  While pipes were eventually used, the initial material was planks.
*   **D: Xadiidka (Iron)** - Iron was used *later*, after the planks.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa taayirrada alwaaxda ahaa loogu badalay taayirro bir ah?","The correct answer is **C: Waxay awoodeen inay xamili karaan culaysyo waaweyn (They were able to carry heavier loads).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...they (wagonways) enabled the horses pulling the wagons to not only ride well but also to pull heavier loads than on other roads."" This directly links the development of the wagonways to their ability to handle heavier loads. The passage then explains that the initial wooden wheels were replaced with copper wheels due to the wear and tear of the copper. Finally, copper wheels were replaced with iron wheels. Therefore, the progression highlights the need for wheels that could handle increasing weight and stress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kor u kaca xawaaraha fardaha (Increased horse speed):** While better roads *might* have helped horses run faster, the passage doesn't focus on speed as the primary reason for the wheel change.
* **B: Waxaa loo tixgeliyey kuwo ka waxtar badan (Considered more efficient):**  The passage doesn't explicitly say they were considered more efficient. Efficiency is implied by the ability to carry heavier loads, but it's not the direct reason given.
* **D: Waxaa ahaadeen kuwo dhamaaday oo ay biraha xadiidka ahi cuneen (Were worn out and eaten by iron):** While wear and tear *led* to the replacement of copper with iron, this isn't the *reason* the wheels were initially replaced with copper. The initial change was due to the limitations of wood in handling heavier loads.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa qaabeeyay shakhsiyaadka inta lagu jiro xilliga Romanticismka?","The correct answer is **D: Dhaqanka**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Jacaylka , sameynta qofka meeshu ku nool yahay, dhaqamada la xiriira goobtas, iyo la noolashaha isfahan bulsho ee goobtas, ayaa ka wanaagsan kusoo rogida shuruuc lagu dhaqmo.""  This directly links the development of individuals during the Romantic period to **culture** (dhaqamada la xiriira goobtas). The other options are not mentioned or supported by the text.
"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan ka tarjumayn fikradda guud ee go'aaminta tignoolajiyada? ,"The correct answer is **A: Tiknoolajiyada saamaynta ay ku leedahay bulshada ayaa ah mid si bulsho ahaan u shuruudaysan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the interplay between technology and social/political factors.** It presents two opposing viewpoints: technology following its own path or technology having a ""social impact."" However, the passage ultimately argues that technology *does* have a social impact, and this impact is not independent of social and political contexts. The example of cars and infrastructure clearly illustrates this – the need for cars influenced the development of roads, and the widespread ownership of cars had a significant social impact (traffic, healthcare advancements).

* **Option A directly reflects this point.**  Saying technology's impact is ""socially conditioned"" means its influence is shaped by social and political circumstances, aligning perfectly with the passage's central argument.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Horumarinta tignoolajiyada ma saameynayso dhaqanka (Technology advancement is not affecting culture):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage argues. The passage repeatedly shows how technology affects culture.
* **C: Tiknoolajiyadu waxay saameyn qoto dheer ku leedahay bulshada (Technology has a profound impact on society):** While the passage *does* say technology has a profound impact, it also emphasizes that this impact is not isolated.  Option A captures the nuanced argument better.
* **D: Horumarka tignoolajiyaddu kuma salaysna saamayn siyaasadeed (Technology advancement is not based on political influence):** The passage explicitly argues *against* this, showing how political factors influence technology (cars and infrastructure example).



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa aan la xiriirin jiidista qaansada?","The correct answer is **B: Astaan u eeg sida wax nagi**.

Here's why:

The passage states:

* **""Kor waxa ay ka dhigan tahay inaad kor kasoo bilaawdo gadaalna aad u jiido...""** (The top resembles starting from the back and pulling forward...)
* **""...hoosna waxa ay ka dhigan tahay inaad halka aad wareega falaartya ka heyso horay usi jiido.""** (...and the bottom resembles pulling from where you hold the vibrating part forward.)

This describes the *action* of pulling the string. Option B, ""Astaan u eeg sida wax nagi"" (Look at the sign like a sheep), is unrelated to the *action* of pulling the string. The other options (quiet sound, loud sound, starting from the back) are all characteristics of how the string is pulled and the resulting sound.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa la xiriira dhawaqa dabacsan?","The correct answer is **A: Calaamadda qaanso ee hoose** (The lower clef).

The text states: ""Kor waxa ay ka dhigan tahay inaad kor kasoo bilaawdo gadaalna aad u jiido, hoosna waxa ay ka dhigan tahay inaad halka aad wareega falaartya ka heyso horay usi jiido. Xeego-sare badanaa waxay soo saartaa cod debecsan..."" (Upward clef means you start from the back and pull forward, and downward clef means you pull forward from where you hold the loop. The upper clef usually produces a mellow sound...).

Therefore, the lower clef (hoos u qaloocaana) is associated with a mellow sound.
"
Kuwee haraaga noolaha ay tusinayaan in gacmihii ugu danbeyn la qabsadeen in ugu horayn loo isticmaalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Culays qaadida**.

The passage explicitly states that chimpanzee hands are similar in size and length to their feet, suggesting the use of hands for carrying weight and locomotion. It also highlights the specialization of the hand in early hominids (2-3 million years ago) for grasping. This indicates that carrying weight was an early function of the hand.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Wax isdaba marin (Tool use):** While tool use is important for humans, the passage doesn't focus on this as an *early* function.
*   **C: Meel socodka (Locomotion):** The passage states chimpanzees use both hands and feet for locomotion. While early hominids likely used their hands for locomotion as well, the emphasis is on the hand's ability to carry weight.
*   **D: Farandulayn (Manipulation):** While manipulation is an important function of the hand, the passage focuses on the broader ability to carry weight as a primary early use.



"
Kuwa soo socda kee baa si sax ah u qeexaya guruubyada daanyeerka chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **B: Gacmahoodu iyo cagahoodu way ku kala duwan yihiin cabbirka.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that chimpanzees have hands and feet that are similar in size and length, suggesting they *do* use their hands for tasks like carrying weight and walking.
* Option A is incorrect because chimpanzees are not particularly upright like humans.
* Option C is incorrect because the passage indicates they *do* use their hands for carrying weight.
* Option D is incorrect. The passage emphasizes the adaptation of the hand for grasping and weight-bearing, not primarily for manipulation/communication.
"
Xulashadu waxay meesha ka saaraysaa kala duwanaanshaha hidde-sideyaasha cusub ee kooxdee?,"The correct answer is **C: Kala soocida (Segregation)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the mutation creates a new type of ""hidden"" and ""emergent"" variation, and then how selection acts to *separate* these two populations.  The question asks what selection does to the *new* variations. The passage states selection ""eliminates the new variations of the hidden and emergent populations."" This elimination is essentially segregation - the process of separating the new variations into distinct groups.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qarsoon (Hidden):** The passage says selection doesn't eliminate the hidden variations, but rather the *new* variations within the emergent group.
*   **B: Dib u habeyn (Remodeling):** The passage doesn't mention remodeling.
*   **D: Muujiyay (Displayed):** The passage doesn't say selection displayed variations, but rather eliminated them.



"
Nidaamkee ayaa ka mas'uul ah in lagu daro kala duwanaanshiyaha hidda-socodka?,"The correct answer is **C: isku badelka (recombination)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the process of genetic diversity arising from the combination of existing genetic material.** It mentions ""kala-goynta iyo dib isugu darka shucuur dib iyo gadaal u dhexeya labada barkadood ee eh jiil kasta"" which translates to ""the splitting and rejoining of genetic material between the two strands in each generation."" This directly describes recombination.
* **Recombination** is the process where genetic material (DNA) is exchanged between homologous chromosomes during meiosis (specifically, crossing over). This creates new combinations of genes, leading to genetic diversity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kala soocida (Segregation):** This refers to the separation of chromosomes during meiosis, ensuring each gamete receives only one copy of each gene.  While important for inheritance, it doesn't *create* new combinations.
* **B: Dib u habeyn (Reversion):** This means returning to a previous state. It's not related to creating new genetic variations.
* **D: Muujiyay (Displayed/Showed):** This simply means presenting or showing something. It's not a biological process that causes genetic diversity.



Therefore, **recombination** is the key process responsible for generating genetic diversity, as described in the passage."
"""Iyadoo lagu salaynayo macluumaadka ku jira qoraalka,Keebaa kuwan ay tahay in xayawaanku uu cuno si uu u xalliyo “dhibaatada borotiinka""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Kabajaan (Insects)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while plant-based proteins (grass, herbs) exist, they are difficult for intelligent life (like humans) to digest without processing. It then highlights that animal-based foods (insects, worms, fish) are not only edible but also contain a complete range of essential amino acids. Therefore, the passage implies that insects (kabajaan) are a solution to the ""protein problem.""
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, Dhibaatooyinka soo socda kee ka mid ah aysan keenin la'aanta amino acids muhiimka ah?","The correct answer is **B: Nafaqodaro**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the inability to digest proteins leads to ""nafaqo xumo"" (malnutrition). While the other options (difficulties with digestion, stunted growth, and death) are *consequences* of the lack of essential amino acids, malnutrition is the direct result of not obtaining enough of them. The text links the lack of digestion to a lack of amino acids, which then leads to malnutrition.

Sidee xubnaha dhaqan-hoosaadyada gaarka ah ay inta badan u caddeeyaan xidhiidhka ay la leeyihiin kooxda?,"The correct answer is **D: Ayadoo la isticmaalayo habdhaqan ka turjumaya qaab kamida astaanta guud.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that members of subcultures often signal their affiliation through visible, stylistic cues like fashion, customs, and jargon.
* Option D directly reflects this – using behavior that reflects the overall identity of the subculture.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **A:**  While blending in *can* happen, it's not the primary way subculture membership is displayed.
    * **B:**  Taking on the beliefs of others is more about assimilation, not signaling subculture membership.
    * **C:** Accepting social norms is the opposite of what subcultures often do; they challenge or deviate from them.

"Sida ku xusan aragtida lagu soo bandhigay qoraalka, maxaa ku dhici kara ilmaha lagu tilmaamo qoomiyadda laga tirada badan yahay ee loo maleeyey inuu ku lug yeesho dabeecadaha xumaha ah?","The correct answer is **A: Ilmuhu wuxuu isku dayi doonaa inuu iska ilaaliyo ku lug lahaanshaha dabeecadaha khatarta ah.**

Here's why:

The passage states that early experiences of prejudice and negative labels (like being called a ""minority"" and associated with negative traits) can negatively impact a child's academic performance.  This suggests the child will *avoid* behaviors associated with the negative label.  They'll try to distance themselves from being perceived as having those ""negative traits.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ilmuhu waxa ay aad ugu dhowdahay in uu ku dhaqaaqo dabeecad khatar ah:** The passage implies the opposite – that negative labeling makes a child *less* likely to exhibit negative traits.
* **C: Ilmuhu wuxuu uga guran doonaa xaaladaha bulshada:** While prejudice can lead to social withdrawal, the core idea from the passage is about avoiding negative behaviors *associated* with the label.
* **D: Ilmuhu wuxuu diidi doonaa inuu la macaamilo dadka laga tirada badan yahay ee kale:** The passage doesn't explicitly say the child will reject people from different groups. It focuses on the impact of *labels* and *negative associations*.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, Aqoonta canugga ee fikradaha isirka ee saameyn ku yeelan kara kuwan soo socda waa midkee?","The correct answer is **D: Qeexitaankooda isir (Self-identity)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly states that early experiences of being ridiculed for perceived racial traits and not being accepted at school *affect their well-being*.  This impact is related to how they see themselves.  Being targeted for their skin color influences their sense of who they are – their self-identity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Isirrada laga tirada badan yahay ee ay doortaan in lagu garto (The most numerous traits they choose to be identified by):** While skin color is a trait, the passage isn't focused on *choosing* a trait. It's about external perceptions and the resulting impact.
* **B: Dabeecaddooda (Their nature/temperament):** The passage focuses on *social* experiences and the impact of ridicule, not inherent personality traits.
* **C: Xiriirka ay la leeyihiin carruurta kale (Their relationships with other children):** While the passage implies negative social consequences, the core impact is on *self-perception* (their identity).

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer because the passage links negative experiences with a child's perceived racial traits directly to their sense of self.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kee baa aan u badnayn in uu la jaanqaado barbaarinta ubadka waxshinimada ah?","The correct answer is **D: Walaaca bulshada (Social instincts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children raised by animals exhibit behaviors *consistent with the animal they were raised by* (e.g., their feeding habits, a lack of concern for humans). This implies they *don't* develop human social instincts or a sense of community. Option D, ""Walaaca bulshada"" (Social instincts), directly addresses this missing element.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U noolaanshaha si madaxbanaan (Living independently):** The passage describes children living independently in the wild, so this isn't something they *don't* do.
* **B: Xirfado wada hadal oo xoogan (Strong communication skills):**  The passage implies a lack of human communication skills, so this isn't something they possess.
* **C: Dabeecadaha gooni socodka ah (Unique traits):** The passage *does* say they develop unique traits consistent with the animal they are raised by.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, Kuwa soo socda kee baa si sax ah u qeexaya dhaqanka waxshinimada ee carruurta?","The best answer based on the provided text is **B: Dabeecadda waxshinimo waxay ka iman kartaa bulsho la'aanta.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that abandonment by parents is a major cause of children developing animalistic traits.  This is a form of social isolation.
* It also mentions that even without abandonment, children can be raised by animals or seem to live independently in the wild, suggesting a lack of typical human social interaction.
* While the text links abandonment to parental neglect and mental issues, it doesn't *solely* attribute animalistic traits to these factors.  It presents a broader picture of social isolation leading to these traits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inta badan hab-dhaqanka waxshinimo waxaa sababa naafo jireed** - The text doesn't emphasize physical disability as the primary cause. While neglect *can* stem from various issues, it's the lack of social interaction that's highlighted.
* **C: Dabeecadda waxshinimo waxay ku badan tahay oo keliya carruurta ay waalidkood xidheen** - The text implies that *any* form of extreme isolation (animal raising, independent living in the wild) can lead to animalistic traits, not just abandonment by parents.
* **D: Dhammaan dabeecadaha waxshinimo waxaa sababa naafo maskaxeed oo daran** - The text doesn't state that mental disability is *always* the cause. It links abandonment to mental issues, but it doesn't make it a universal condition for developing animalistic traits.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that traditional beer brewing is primarily for *personal consumption* – to supplement the farmer's and their family's diet. It highlights simple, natural methods.  Option C directly contradicts this by suggesting a focus on high-yield production using advanced technology. This aligns with commercial farming practices, not the traditional, subsistence-focused beer brewing described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diirada saarista wax-soo-saarka buuxinaya baahiyaha qoyska beeralayda:** This *aligns* with the passage's description of beer brewing.
*   **B: Soo saarista cunto laga iibiyo dadka kale:** While not explicitly mentioned, the passage implies that excess beer *could* be traded or sold, supporting a farmer's livelihood. This isn't directly contradictory.
*   **D: Bixinta shinada laga deegaanka maxaliga ah ee beeroolaha:** The passage mentions using natural ingredients and local resources, so this option is consistent.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Taariikhiyan beeraleyda intooda badan waxay ku lug lahaayeen beerashada nolol-maalmeedka tanina waxa ay ka jirta wadamada badan ee soo korayaa."" (Historically, most farmers were involved in subsistence farming, and this is still prevalent in many developing countries.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waa nidaam dabiici ah gebi ahaanba ah** (It is a completely natural system): The passage mentions the use of ""dalag badalista ama xirfadaha kale ee fudud"" (crop rotation or other simple techniques) which indicates some level of intervention and is not purely natural.
* **B: Waxay isticmaashaa farsamooyin gaar ah si ay u kordhiso dalagga** (It uses special techniques to increase yields): The passage emphasizes simplicity and ""waxyaalaha dabiiciga ah"" (natural things) - it's not about advanced techniques for maximizing yields.
* **C: Waxay u ogolaataa beeralayda inay ku wadaagaan dalagyadooda dhamaan gobolkooda** (It allows farmers to share their crops with all regions of their country): The passage focuses on self-sufficiency (""beerashada nolol-maalmeedka"") and not distribution across the entire country.



"
Booqashada madxafku qaybtee dalxiiska ayay hoos imaanaysaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Dalxiiska dhaqanka**.

Here's why:

* **Dalxiiska dhaqanka** focuses on experiencing the history, culture, and heritage of a place. Museums are institutions dedicated to preserving and showcasing cultural artifacts and information. Therefore, visiting a museum directly aligns with the goals of cultural tourism.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Dalxiiska ganacsi (Business tourism):**  Related to travel for work purposes (conferences, meetings, etc.).
* **Dalxiiska madadaalada (Leisure tourism):** While visiting a museum can be a leisure activity, it's more specifically tied to cultural enrichment.
* **Dalxiiska bannaanka (Outdoor tourism):** Focuses on activities in nature (hiking, camping, etc.).



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, Maxaa mudnaan u yeelan kara dadka madadaalada u soo socdaalay?","The correct answer is **B: Ka nasashada hawl maalmeedkooda shaqo**.

Here's why:

The passage defines ""Dalxiis Raaxo"" (Leisure Tourism) as people going to a different place than their normal daily lives to relax and unwind. Option B directly reflects this definition. While options A, C, and D can be *aspects* of leisure tourism, the primary reason people engage in it, according to the passage, is for relaxation.

Maxaa lagu xusay qoraalka in uu wax ka caawiyay yaraynta cabsida laga qabay isbeddelka kaniisadda maxalliga ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Xusuusashada dhacdooyinka lagu guulaystay ee hab-dhaqanka ganacsi.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sheekooyinkaas guusha waxay yareeyeen isbeddel ka cabsashadii, iyagoo isla markaana abuuraya isbeddel jacayl mustaqbalka ah."" (Those success stories reduced the fear of change, and created a love for future change.)

Option A directly reflects this statement by mentioning the recollection of successful business ventures. These success stories are the ones that reduced the fear of change.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Helitaanka aragtida fog ee dadka saameeya dhaqanka ururka:** While understanding influential people (option B) is helpful, the passage doesn't directly connect this to reducing the fear of change.
*   **C: Kashifida awooda riixaysa ururka:** The passage doesn't mention discovering the driving force of the organization.
*   **D: Fahamka taariikhda ururka:** While understanding the history (option D) is presented as beneficial, the passage specifically links *success stories* from the history to reducing the fear of change.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, in qofku fahmo taariikhdiisa maxay bay ku caawin kartaa?","The correct answer is **A: Hoos u dhigida cabsida laga qabo isbeddelka.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sheekooyinkaas guusha waxay yareeyeen isbeddel ka cabsashadii, iyagoo isla markaana abuuraya isbeddel jacayl mustaqbalka ah.""  This directly translates to success stories reducing fear of change and fostering a love for future change.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Xoojinta qiyamka** - While history *can* inform values, the passage doesn't explicitly link understanding history to strengthening values.
* **C: Helitaanka inaa dareento booska ururka dhexdiisa** - The passage mentions understanding the history to ""suureeyo halka u gelaayo taariikhda ururka,"" which is related to understanding one's place, but the primary focus is on reducing fear of change.
* **D: Hagaajinta hab-dhaqanka ganacsi** - The passage touches on how history can inform business practices, but the main point about understanding history is its impact on overcoming fear of change.

Keebaa weedhahan soo socda si sax ah u qeexaya habka casriga u dambeeya ee waxbarashada?,"The correct answer is **D: Ma jiraan wax dhammays ah oo waxbarashada ah.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that modern learning offers great freedom and that there isn't one ""right"" way to learn. It highlights that learning occurs at the intersection of what you learn and the knowledge you bring to it. The examples provided (not fixing a car, building a water fountain, traveling to Peru, repairing a neighbor's house) illustrate that knowledge doesn't guarantee application, and there's no single, perfect outcome to learning.

Option D, ""Ma jiraan wax dhammays ah oo waxbarashada ah"" (There are no finished things in learning), perfectly captures this idea of ongoing, open-ended exploration and the lack of a definitive endpoint to the learning process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waayo-aragnimada waxbarashada qaarkood ayaa ka faa'iido badan kuwa kale** (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others): While the passage implies this, it doesn't state it definitively. It focuses more on the freedom and lack of a single ""best"" way.
* **B: Waxbarashadu waa in diirada lagu saaro waxyaabaha aan aaminsanahay inaan la kulmi doono** (Learning should focus on things we believe we will encounter): This is the opposite of what the passage suggests. The passage emphasizes learning beyond anticipated experiences and the unexpected connections that can be made.
* **C: Qaar ka mid ah hababka wax-barashada ayaa ka fiican kuwa kale** (Some learning methods are better than others): Similar to A, the passage doesn't state a definitive superiority of one method over another; it focuses on the freedom and diverse approaches available.



"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah uga tarjumeynin waxbarashada habka casriga ah ka dib?,"The correct answer is **D: Aqoonta laga yaabo in aynaan waligeen dabaqin ayaa weli mudan in la barto (Knowledge that you may never apply is still worth learning.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the inherent value of learning for its own sake, not just for practical application.** It specifically uses examples of things people watch on TV that they will never do themselves – car repair, building a water feature, traveling to Peru, etc.  The point is that even if you never *use* the knowledge, it's still valuable.
* **Option D directly reflects this sentiment.** It acknowledges that knowledge doesn't always lead to immediate action but is still worthwhile.
* **The other options are accurate descriptions of the passage's ideas, but not as central to its main point:**
    * **A:** ""Waxaa jira siyaabo badan oo lagu barto macluumaadka"" (There are many ways to learn information) - This is a straightforward statement of the passage's argument for diverse learning methods.
    * **B:** ""Waaya aragnimada waxbarashada qaarkood waa in laga hormariyaa kuwa kale"" (Some learning experiences should be prioritized over others) - This touches on the idea of catering to individual interests, which is present.
    * **C:** ""Waayo-aragnimada waxbarasho waxay ku tiirsan tahay bartaha iyo aqoonta la soo bandhigay"" (Learning experiences rely on the medium and the information presented) - This is a factual statement about how learning is facilitated.



Therefore, option D best captures the core message of the passage regarding the intrinsic value of learning, even without immediate practical application.

"Ka dib soo kicitaanka si ula kac ah inta lagu jiro xilliga hurdada caadiga ah, kuwaan keebaa laga yaabaa inuu faragalin ku leeyahay bargo,a hurdada?","The correct answer is **D: U kacida si aad biyo uga cabto dhalo saaran koomadiinkaaga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that deliberately getting out of bed during your normal sleep cycle (using cues like thirst) can help break the sleep inertia.**  
* **Drinking water is a good example of this cue.**  It forces you to get out of bed to go to the bathroom, disrupting the continued sleep.
* **Option D directly describes this behavior.**

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to help:

* **A: Wax akhrinta saacad iyo badh ka hor intaadan dib u seexan:** This is likely to *delay* sleep onset, not break sleep inertia.
* **B: Isticmaalka musqusha kadibna toos ugu noqotid sariirta:**  This is counterproductive.  It reinforces the sleep cycle and doesn't break inertia.
* **C: Deminta alaarmiga koomadiinka saaran kadibna aad hurdada ku noqoto labaatan daqiiqo ka dib:**  This is less effective than getting up and doing something. It might just reset your sleep cycle.



"
"Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ahayn sharraxaadda saxda ah oo ku saabsan bargo,a hurdada?","The correct answer is **D: Kacitaanka ka dib, ujeedadu waa inaad dib ugu seexato laba saacadood gudahood.**

Here's why:

* **The text describes ""jahawareerka hurdadu"" as a system to wake up feeling refreshed after a period of sleep, even if the sleep is shorter.** It focuses on *how* to feel awake, not on *when* to go back to sleep. The text doesn't mention a specific timeframe for returning to sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Waxay ku salaysnaan kartaa Biorhythm-ka (It can be based on Biorhythm):** The text mentions using a gentle, quiet alarm, which *could* be integrated with biorhythm principles (though it doesn't explicitly state it).
* **B: Ujeedadu waa inaadan si buuxda u toosin naftaada (The purpose is not to fully awaken yourself):** The text emphasizes a gentle awakening, not a jarring one.
* **C: Nidaamku wuxuu dhacaa inta lagu jiro xilliga hurdadaada caadiga ah (The system occurs during your normal sleep time):** This is directly stated in the text.



Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text."
"Marka ay maskaxdu isku dayayso inay had iyo jeer sharaxdo riyada, maxaa kordhaya?","The correct answer is **C: Dhererka xaaladda soo kabashada**.

Here's why:

The passage states that prolonged use of Lucid Dreaming can lead to increased memorable dreams by expanding the time between REM cycles.  It then compares this to the feeling of fatigue after prolonged exposure to stimuli (like watching TV). This implies that the extended time spent in a state of heightened mental activity (dreaming) is what leads to the feeling of tiredness.  This extended dream state is directly linked to the ""dhererka xaaladda soo kabashada"" (duration of the recovery state).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tirada xadiga ilmirigsiga indhaha (Number of eye movements):** While eye movements are part of REM sleep, the passage doesn't directly connect lucid dreaming to an increase in *number* of eye movements.
*   **B: Heerarka tamarta (Energy levels):** The passage explicitly states that lucid dreaming *causes* fatigue, meaning energy levels are *decreasing*, not increasing.
*   **D: Waqtiga u dhexeeya xadiga ilmirigsiga indhaha (Time between eye movements):** The passage discusses the time *between* REM cycles, not the time between eye movements *within* a cycle.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo saamayn xun ah bay riyooyinka soo lalaabta ku dhalin karaan jirka?,"The correct answer is **B: Yaraynta xadiga ilmirigsiga indhaha habenki (Decreased REM sleep duration).**

Here's why:

The passage states that excessive Lucid Dreaming can lead to a shortening of the time between REM cycles. REM sleep is crucial for physical restoration and recovery.  Reducing the duration of REM sleep, as described in option B, is a negative consequence because it prevents the body from properly recovering.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yaraynta inta u dhaxaysa xadiga ilmirigsiga indhaha (Decreased time between REM cycles):** The passage explicitly mentions this as a consequence of Lucid Dreaming, not a negative *effect on the body*.
* **C: Ku-tiirsanaanta riyada la dariimi karo (Dependence on lucid dreaming):** While dependence *could* be problematic, the passage focuses on the physiological effect of sleep disruption.
* **D: Kordhinta xadiga ilmirigsiga indhaha habenki (Increased REM sleep duration):** The passage describes the *opposite* – a shortening of REM sleep.



Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting a negative effect on the body is a decrease in REM sleep duration.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sidee isku mid u yihiin kooxaha caadiga ah iyo kooxaha gacan ku samayska ah?","The correct answer is **A: Labada kooxood waxaa laga filayaa inay soo bandhigaan qaab ciyaareed isku mid ah**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kooxaha onleynka ayaa loo qabta isla heerka wanaagsan ee kooxaha caadiga, laakin waxaa jiro farqi qorsheyn."" This means that the *overall goal* or *standard* of performance is the same. However, the *approach* to achieving that goal differs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Labada kooxoodba waxay leeyihiin heerar kala duwan oo madax-bannaanida hawl-maalmeedkooda caadiga ah** - The passage actually says remote teams *tend* to have more autonomy, not different levels of autonomy.
* **C: Labada kooxoodba waxay u warbixiyaan koox maamul oo aan muuqan** - While remote teams have a ""hidden group"" of management, the passage doesn't say traditional teams *don't* have a visible management group.
* **D: Labada kooxoodba waxay ku shaqeeyaan aag isku waqti ah** - This is the opposite of what the passage says about remote teams; they often work asynchronously.



"
"Iyada oo lagu saleynayo mariska, kooxaha jireed iyo kuwa gacan ku samayska weedhee ku saabsan oo aan run ahayn?","The best answer is **D: Aagagga wakhtiyada kala duwan waxay faaiido u noqotaa kooxaha gacan ku samayska ah**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Badanaa xoriyad ka badan xubnaha caadiga ah ee kooxda ayay leeyihiin maadaama laga yaabo in kooxdoodu kulanto iyagoo adeegsanaya aag waqtiyeedyo kala duwan taasoo laga yaabo inaanay fahmin maamulkooda guduhu."" This directly links flexible time zones to a benefit of virtual teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kooxaha caadiga ah waxa badanaa lagu hayaa heer ka sareya:** The passage doesn't make any claims about the hierarchical structure of conventional teams.
* **B: Kooxaha gacan ku samaysku inta badan waxay u dhaqmaan sida rugta lagala xidhiidho kooxaha caadiga ah:** The passage describes virtual teams as distinct (""koox aan la arkin"" - unseen team) and not functioning as sub-units of conventional teams.
* **C: Conventional teams have less autonomy than virtual teams:** The passage says *the opposite*. Virtual teams are described as having more autonomy due to flexible work arrangements.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ahayn wax aragtiyaha nuxurku ku salaysan yihiin?,"The correct answer is **A: Rabitaano cusub oo rumowda xiliga qaangaarka (New affiliations during times of crisis)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on fundamental human needs and desires.** It discusses Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory, both of which are about *intrinsic* and *extrinsic* motivators driving human behavior. The core idea is that people have needs, both basic and more complex, that influence their actions.

* **Options B, C, and D directly relate to these core concepts:**
    * **B: Sida deegaanku u saameeyo qof falalkiisa (How the environment affects a person's behavior)** -  This aligns with the idea that needs can be influenced by the external environment, a key aspect of motivation theories.
    * **C: Baahiyaha gudeed (Internal needs)** - This is directly in line with Maslow's hierarchy and the concept of intrinsic motivation.
    * **D: Fahamka waxa ay dadku jecel yihiin (Understanding what people like)** -  This speaks to the desire, preference, and the external expression of needs.

* **A: Rabitaano cusub oo rumowda xiliga qaangaarka (New affiliations during times of crisis)** - While social connections are important, and people *might* seek new affiliations during crisis, this isn't a central tenet of Maslow's or Herzberg's theories.  It's a potential *response* to a crisis, but not a fundamental drive explained by those theories. It's more about social support and comfort, rather than core needs like self-esteem or self-actualization.



Therefore, option A is the one least grounded in the core ideas presented in the passage.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ahayn shayga qaanuunka sadexlayda?,"The correct answer is **A: Abuuritaanka meel sal u ah rugta mawduuca la dhigi karo** (Creating a foundation for the subject to be placed on).

Here's why:

The ""Rule of Thirds"" focuses on *placement* within the frame. It's about creating visual interest by placing key elements along lines or at the intersections of a grid dividing the image into thirds.

Let's break down why the other options *are* part of the Rule of Thirds:

* **B: Abuuritaanka nolosha iyo tamarta gudaha sawirka** (Creating the life and energy within the image):  The Rule of Thirds helps to direct the viewer's eye and can contribute to the overall energy and feeling of the image.
* **C: Ku haynta mawduuca meel gaar ah oo waxtar leh** (Holding the subject in a special and effective place): This is the core principle of the Rule of Thirds – placing the subject intentionally off-center.
* **D: Aasaasida amar gudaha sawirka** (The basis for internal order in the image): By using the Rule of Thirds, you establish a visual structure and order within the image.

Option A, while important for composition, isn't *specifically* a part of the Rule of Thirds itself. It's a general compositional consideration, not the defining characteristic of the Rule of Thirds.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan qeexin qaabka sawir qaadista 35mm?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxay leedahay saami cabir oo ka duwan qaabab badan oo caan ah.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Nooca 35mm dhab ahaantii, waxoogaa waa mid wareer keenaya, oo ballac ahaan ah 36mm dhererkana 24mm. Saamiga dhinaca ee noocaan (u qaybinta labo iyo toban si loo helo saamiga lambarka buuxo) ayaa sidaa darteeda ku noqon doono 3:2. Qaabab badan oo caan ah (Noocyad APS, tusaale ahaanayaa la mid ah ama qaabka saamigan aad ugu dhow.""

This means the 35mm format doesn't perfectly align with the 3:2 aspect ratio of many digital camera formats (like APS).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wali waxay ku jirtaa soo saaris (It's still in production):** The text mentions its continued relevance, not that it's still being produced.
* **B: Waxaa lagu qaatay qaababka kamaradaha dhijitaalka ah (It's used in digital camera formats):** The text acknowledges its influence on digital formats, but doesn't say it *is* a digital format itself.
* **D: Waa qaabka ugu caansan aduunka (It's the most popular format in the world):** The text doesn't claim it's the most popular. While historically significant, it's not necessarily the most popular *now*.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tani mushkiladnimadeedii way sii yaraanaysaa maadaama soo saarayaashu bikaacyo tayo sare leh soo saarayaan. Tan ayaa u sahashay bikaacyada soo dhawaynta inay soo saaraan sawiro tayadooda la barbar dhigi karo kuwa ay sameeyaan bikaacyada diiradda xaddidan leh.""  This directly indicates that improved lens quality has allowed smartphone cameras to produce images comparable to those from cameras with longer focal lengths.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxay leeyihiin xawaare sare oo muraayadeed:** The passage explicitly states that a *disadvantage* of smartphone cameras is that their maximum aperture (speed) is usually lower.
* **B: Way fududahay in lagu isticmaalo xaaladaha iftiinka hooseeya:** While improved lens quality might help *slightly* in low light, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a key development.  The low maximum aperture is a more significant factor.
* **D: Waxay leeyihiin kakanaanta diiradda ka yar marka loo eego muraayadaha asaasiga ah:** The passage says the quality is comparable, not that the focal length is shorter.

Here's why:

* The passage states that a major disadvantage of prime lenses is their typically lower speed (aperture).
* It also mentions that a key advantage of zoom lenses is their higher speed.
* Therefore, if speed is the most important factor, a zoom lens would be preferred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Haddii aad rabto canaasiirta muraayadaha yar** (If you want shallow depth of field): Prime lenses are generally better for achieving shallow depth of field.
* **C: Haddii aadan rabin inaad u isticmaasho toosh goobaha mugdiga ah** (If you don't want to use a tripod in low-light situations): Zoom lenses are often used *with* tripods in low light to compensate for the slower aperture.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that Sufism is *unique* in its emphasis on direct, personal spiritual experience. It specifically contrasts Sufism with other religious practices by highlighting its focus on internal experiences like peace, wisdom, compassion, and joy.

Option D states that the pursuit of direct personal experience is *not* unique to Sufism; it's common to many other religions. This directly contradicts the passage's central point about Sufism's distinctive approach.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **A: Waxaa jira oo xooga la saarayaa la kullanka xaaladaha nabdoon iyo raxmadda leh ee miyir-qabka** - The passage explicitly mentions peace, wisdom, and compassion as key aspects of the Sufi experience.
* **B: Kuwa raacaya Khalwaynta waxay raadiyaan wacyiga miyirka leh ee xaqiiqda ruuxiga ah** - This aligns with the passage's description of seeking direct experience of spiritual reality.
* **C: Kuwa raacaya Khalwaynta waxa laga yaabaa inay qaataan dhaqamo ka caawin doona inay kobciyaan fahankooda xaqiiqada rabbaaniga ah** -  The passage notes that Sufis use practices to cultivate understanding of the divine truth.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee aan diiradda saarin Suufiyada?","The correct answer is **A: Raadinta dareen waaqica rabaaniga ah (Seeking a spiritual reality)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Sufism is ""a quest for union, belonging, and the taste of the truth of water without thirst, the essential truth of God."" This directly points to a desire for a direct, experiential connection with the divine, which is a spiritual reality.
* The passage emphasizes personal experience (""direct encounter,"" ""personal experiences of mental insight"").
* The description of Sufism highlights qualities like tranquility, mindfulness, compassion, and joy – all of which are associated with a profound spiritual experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raad-raacida aragtida iyadoo la adeegsanayo khibradaha guud, ee la wadaago (Seeking vision using general, shared experiences):**  The passage stresses *individual* experience rather than shared, general ones.
* **C: Xooga saaraya xaaladda barakeysan ee miyir-qabka (Diminishing the blessed state of the intellect):**  The passage actually describes Sufism as cultivating a *blessed* state of the intellect through practices.
* **D: Raadinta garashada miyirka leh ee Ilaah (Seeking intellectual knowledge of God):** While intellectual understanding might play a role, the passage prioritizes *experiential* knowledge over purely intellectual understanding.

Here's why:

* **The description of Pureland origami explicitly states it's for beginners.**  It emphasizes immediate, single-fold creations and avoids complex folds.
* **Option D directly aligns with this.** It describes someone who is just starting out and needs an easy-to-learn method.
* **Options A, B, and C are the opposite of what Pureland origami is designed for.** They describe someone with experience or aiming for complex designs.



Therefore, the Pureland method is best suited for someone who is a beginner and has limited experience with origami (option D)."

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, xaruntee baan wax xiriira la lahayn Ilbaxnimadii ka jirtay dooxada Sindi?","The correct answer is **B: Wabiga Sarasfati**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""In kastoo culimad qaarkood ay qiyaasayaan maadaama ilbaxnimadu ka jirtay dhoobalayda wabiga hadda qallalay ee Sarasvati..."" This means the Indus Valley Civilization was also associated with the Sarasvati River.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Harappa:** The text says Harappa was the *first site* to be excavated, but it doesn't say it *didn't* have a connection to the civilization. In fact, it *is* a site of the civilization.
* **C: Dhammaan gobollada waqooyi bari ee Afgaanistaan:** The civilization stretched across parts of North-West Afghanistan, but the text focuses on the Indus River region as its core.
* **D: Inta badan Pakistan-ta casriga ah:** The civilization largely corresponds to modern-day Pakistan, but the text highlights the Indus River region as the civilization's core.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is the connection between the Indus Valley Civilization and the Sarasvati River.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions that scholars debate whether the Indus Valley Civilization should be called the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization, due to the presence of the now-dried Sarasvati River.
* Option B, ""Ilbaxnimada Sindi-Sarasfati,"" directly reflects this debate and is a plausible alternative name mentioned in the text.
* Option A, ""Ilbaxnimada Harappan,"" is also mentioned as a name derived from the first excavated site.
* Options C and D are too general and don't represent the specific naming debates discussed in the passage.

Therefore, ""Ilbaxnimada Sindi-Sarasfati"" is the most accurate and contextually relevant answer.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa faa'iido muddo dheer ah keena?","The correct answer is **A: La shaqaynta dadka kale (Working with others)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""waxa dabiiciga wada-shaqeynta marka inta badan ay faa'iido waxaa kaloo jiri doono wax kaloo lasii faa'iido muddo kooban markii daneysi lagu dhaqmo. Sida lagu rajo wayn yahay, dadka badankoodu waxay xaqiiqsan doonaan in waqtiga fog doorkooda ugu fiican noqon doono inay dadka kale la shaqeeyaan.""

This translates to: ""It is natural to work together, and there will usually be benefits, as well as other benefits for a short time when selfishness is practiced. As hoped, most people will realize that their best role in the long run will be to work with others.""

Therefore, working with others is highlighted as the long-term benefit.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Hormarinta danta gaarka ah ee qofka (Promoting the self-interest of individuals):** The passage actually discourages selfishness.
* **C: In xoogga la saaro waxa dadka laga tirada badan yahay faa'iido u ah marka lagasoo gudbo dadka kale (Putting effort into things is beneficial when overcoming others):** This contradicts the idea of working with others and implies competition, which is not the main point.
* **D: Aqoonsiga in hungurigu faa'iido leeyahay (Recognizing that selfishness is beneficial):**  The passage implies selfishness is detrimental.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa qof mudnaanta siin kara haddii ay diiradda saarayaan faa'iidooyinka degdegga ah?","The correct answer is **D: Keli-Danaysi (Individualism)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""dhuuninimada iyo daneysigaba maaha kuwa inaga suulaya abid"" (ambition and selfishness are not inherent to us). It also mentions that while there might be short-term benefits to being selfish, in the long run, people will realize that working with others is their best role.

Therefore, prioritizing immediate benefits aligns with **keli-danaysi (individualism)**, as it focuses on personal gain in the short term, even if it's detrimental in the long run. The passage contrasts this with the long-term benefits of collaboration and mutual support.

This translates to: ""There was a person who paid taxes to the Americans to pay for the American soldiers, a large part of the expenses and the interests of the names of the Philippine government, through banks in Wall Street.""  This indicates that the Filipino people were the ones paying taxes (and therefore covering a large part of the costs) that went to fund the American occupation.

Waqtigee ayaa yimid ka hor casriga farda fuuladii Templars-ka?,"The correct answer is **D: Qarnigii 13aad**.

The text states that the High Middle Ages occurred between the 11th and 13th centuries. The Knights Templar were active during this period. Therefore, the High Middle Ages (and thus the time before the rise of the Templars) ended in the 13th century.
"
Waqtigee ayaa yimid kadib casriga farda fuuladii Templars-ka?,"The correct answer is **C: Qarniyadii Dhexe ee Sare**.

The passage states that the period of the Templars' rise coincided with the High Middle Ages (11th-13th centuries). Therefore, the period *after* the rise of the Templars would still be within the High Middle Ages.
"
Daawadee ama habraacee aan lagu xusin in ay isticmaali jireen dhakhaatiirta guud iyo dhakhaatiirta qalliinka xilligii Boqortooyada Roomaanka?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku joojinta dhiigga iyadoo la isticmaalayo halbowlaha xiraha.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Roman doctors used tourniquets (""halbawla xiranka"") to stop bleeding. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Daawaynta xanuunka dhimirka ee walbahaarka iyo khalkhalka leh iyagoo siinaya noocyo kala duwan oo xanuun baabiye ah:** While Roman doctors did treat pain, the passage doesn't specify pain relief for mental anguish or delirium. It mentions pain relievers from fruits and herbs, but not specifically for mental distress.
* **B: Isticmaalka miraha herbal ka ah ee loo yaqaan scopolamine:** The passage doesn't mention scopolamine or its use in Roman medicine.
* **D: Fulinta xubno goynta dadka qaba xanuunka gaangerida:** The passage mentions amputation for gangrene but doesn't focus on it as a general treatment for pain.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa aan loo nisbayn horumarka laga sameeyay dhinaca caafimaadka xilligii Boqortooyada Roomaanka?","The correct answer is **B: Siyaasadda qalafsan ee dagaal ee Boqortooyada**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that the Roman military supported advancements in healthcare.** It mentions the creation of a military medical corps.
* **Option B, ""Siyaasadda qalafsan ee dagaal ee Boqortooyada"" (Aggressive war policy of the Roman Empire), is not mentioned as a driver of medical advancements.** In fact, aggressive war policies usually *detract* from healthcare by focusing resources on military needs.
* **Options A, C, and D are all directly supported by the passage:**
    * **A: Samaynta Ururka Caafimaadka (Creation of a medical organization):** The passage mentions the establishment of the Roman military medical corps.
    * **C: Samaynta cusbitaalo waxbarasho (Creation of teaching hospitals):** While not explicitly stated, the passage implies the development of medical knowledge and practice that would eventually lead to teaching hospitals.
    * **D: Magacaabidda boqorka ee dhakhaatiirta (The Emperor's appointment of doctors):** The passage states that doctors became experts and were involved in surgical procedures. This implies some level of official recognition or appointment.



Therefore, the only option not supported by the text is the aggressive war policy."
Waa maxay waxa awoodda aragtidu ku tiirsantahay?,"The correct answer is **A: Nidaamka aragga ee xubnaha dareenka** (The sensory system of the eyes).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the ability to see depends on the sensory system of the eyes, which includes different eye structures and specialized cells. Options B, C, and D are not mentioned or supported by the text. The text directly links visual ability to the structure and function of the eyes themselves.
"
Waa maxay waxa ay ku tiirsan tahay kala duwanaanshaha qaab dhismeedka isha ee u dhexeeya noolaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Dareenka dhererka hirka (Sensitivity to light)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the ability of the eye to perceive light depends on the structure of the photoreceptor cells within the eye. Different types of photoreceptors (rods and cones) have different sensitivities to light levels and different structures. This sensitivity to light levels is directly related to the sensitivity to the *length of the light wave* (which determines color perception and how much light is detected).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Shuruudaha noolaha (Living conditions):** While living conditions *can* influence the evolution of eye structure over long periods, the immediate ability of the eye to perceive light is directly tied to its cellular components.
*   **C: Heerka afaysan (Level of education):** This is completely unrelated to the biological structure of the eye.
*   **D: Kakanaanta noolaha (Immunity of living things):** Immunity deals with the body's defense mechanisms, not visual perception.



Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on the provided text, is **A**."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, bayaankee ku saabsan Siikhiyiinta oo aan si sax ah u muujineynin diinta?","The correct answer is **A: Siikhiyiintu wuxuu ahaa natiijo ka dhalatay kala qaybsanaanta kooxeed oo ka dhex jirta dhaqanka Hinduuga**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Siikhyadu waxay aaminsan yihiin in diintoodu ka baxsan tahay diinta Hinduuga in kastoo ay aqoonsan yihiin inay diintooda dhaqan iyo asal la wadaagto Hinduuga.""

Option A accurately reflects this by stating that Sikhism arose from a schism within Hindu culture. The text doesn't deny this origin but emphasizes that Sikhism is a distinct religion.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer:

* **B: Macalinka ruuxiga ahi waa mid ka mid ah qaybaha asaasiga ah ee Siikhiyiinta:** The text states the Guru is foundational, but it doesn't say that the *spiritual teacher* is a foundational *part* of Sikhism in the same way as, say, the core beliefs.
* **C: Sagaal macalin ruuxi ayaa raacay ka dib aasaasihii diinta, Guru Nanak:** While true, this is a factual detail, not a statement about how Sikhism is perceived or its relationship to Hinduism.
* **D: Dhaqamada qaarkood ee Siikhiyiinta waxay asal ahaan ka soo jeedaan Hinduuga:**  The text *does* acknowledge this (""diintooda dhaqan iyo asal la wadaagto Hinduuga""), so this option isn't inaccurate, but option A is a more comprehensive and accurate reflection of the relationship.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, midkee ayaa kuwan soo socda loo arkaa inay yihiin xudunta nidaamka caqiidada Sikhiyiinta?","The correct answer is **A: Fikradda macalinka ruuxiga (The idea of the spiritual teacher).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Shiikhu waa mid asaasi u ah dhammaan diiimaha Hindiya laakiin Siikhnimadu muhiimada ka badan oo ka asaasisan bay siisay."" This highlights the importance of the Guru (spiritual teacher) in Sikhism, elevating it beyond the general importance of gurus in other Hindu traditions.
* The passage also mentions that Guru Nanak founded Sikhism and was followed by nine more Gurus, further emphasizing the central role of spiritual teachers in the faith's development and belief system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dhaqamada Hinduuga (Hindu Customs):** While Sikhism shares cultural roots with Hinduism, the passage clarifies that Sikhs believe their religion is distinct and not simply a continuation of Hindu customs.
* **C: Diidmada in la aqoonsado diimaha kale ee Hindiya (Rejection of acknowledging other Hindu religions):** The passage states that Sikhs *acknowledge* their religious and cultural connections to Hinduism, rather than rejecting other Hindu religions.
* **D: Ku hadalka luqadda Punjabi (Speaking the Punjabi language):** While Punjabi is associated with the region where Sikhism originated, the language itself isn't a core tenet of Sikh belief or a fundamental aspect of its spiritual framework.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa laga yaabaa in carruurta qaba xanuunka Feejignaan-yarida ay ku adag tahay inay diiradda saaraan?","The correct answer is **A: Shaqada iskuulka**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Caruurta ADD waxay la kulmeen waqti adag oo ay diirada ku saran sida shaqada iskuulka..."" (Children with ADD have a difficult time focusing on things like schoolwork...).  While the text mentions other activities children with ADD enjoy, it directly links difficulty focusing to schoolwork.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay carruurta qaba Xanuunka Feejignaanta-yarida ay u janjeeraan inay dhex galaan dhaqamo khatar ah?","The correct answer is **D: Si ay maskaxdooda u kiciyaan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Caruurta rabsho badan ayay doonayaan in ay galaan, sababtoo ah """" waxaay faraha la galaan hawlo khatara, way dagaalamaan, maamulka ayay ka hor yimaadaan"""" si ay maskaxdooda uga shaqaysiiyaan, maadaama maskaxdooda aan hawlo caadi ahi kaga shaqaysiin karayn."" This translates to: ""Children with ADD want to engage in dangerous activities because they 'hook into dangerous tasks, they fight, they oppose management' in order to make their brains work, since their brains cannot work on normal tasks.""

Therefore, they engage in risky behaviors to stimulate their brains because their brains don't function normally with typical tasks.
"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo macluumaadka ku jira qoraalka, kuwaan soo socda kee baan ahayn tusaale kaabaha?","The correct answer is **B: Macalinka SAT (SAT Teacher)**.

Here's why:

The text describes ""Sakhaaraduhu"" (which translates to ""facilitators"" or ""guides"") as tools that *assist* learning, providing personalized help and guidance. They are not the core of the learning process itself.

*   **A: Casharka bilowga ciyaar kombuyuutarka ah (Introductory computer game class):** This implies a learning activity/lesson.
*   **C: Barnaamij waxbarasho oo madaxbannaan (Independent learning program):** This is a learning tool designed for self-paced study.
*   **D: Tababaraha horyaal yar (Little trainer):** This implies a learning activity/lesson.

A **Macalinka SAT (SAT Teacher)**, however, is a *person* who delivers instruction. The text distinguishes ""Sakhaaraduhu"" from instructors.  Therefore, a teacher is not an example of the facilitators being described.



"
Midkee kuwan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin fikradda kaabaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxa kale oo loo yaqaan barashada ku salaysan mashruuc**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the project-based approach is *not* the definition of a ""kaab"" (tutor/mentorship). It describes it as a *tool* that can be used by a tutor.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Kaabaha way u jiri karaan si mala,awaal ah:** The text describes tutors as having both a ""mala awaal"" (mentor/guide) and a ""kilib warqadeed"" (paper pusher/office worker) side, implying a dual role.
* **B: Waxay u badan tahay dhanka caawimaada marka loo eego wax barasho:** The text emphasizes that tutors provide personalized assistance and support for learning.
* **D: Kaabaha waxaa loo isticmaalaa in lagu siiyo taageero bilowga khibrada waxbarasho:** The text highlights that tutors help students start and develop their learning experience, often using tools like computer software or new projects.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sifadee ayay MySpace kaga faa'iidaysan karta ardayda dhibku ka haysto akhriska?","The correct answer is **C: Hal ciwaan shabakad (One website address)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Boggan waxa lagu geli karaa adoo qoraya hal ciwaan websayt keliya, kaasoo uu fududyahay xasuusashadiisu una fudud ardayda inay qoraan kuwaasoo laga yaabo inay qoraalka iyo higaadu ku adkaato.""  This means the single website address simplifies the process for students who struggle with writing and grammar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ku koobid (Conciseness):** While the ease of use *could* lead to more concise writing, the passage doesn't directly say it's a feature that helps with conciseness itself.
* **B: Goob internet (Website):** This is too general. While MySpace *is* a website, the specific benefit mentioned is the *single website address*.
* **D: 54 milyan oo borofayl (54 million profiles):** The number of profiles is mentioned as a fact, but it's not the feature that helps students with reading difficulties.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, midkee kuwan soo socda aan qayb ka ahayn jawaabta Krushchev ee rabshadaha shaqaalaha?","The correct answer is **C: Kordhitanka dhimista mushaharka**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the workers protested due to *reduced wages* and poor food. 
* Krushchev's response *included* addressing financial demands (option D) and appointing a new Prime Minister (option A). 
* The text explicitly mentions that Krushchev *sent tanks* (option B) to quell the unrest, but this is presented as a later action after some concessions were made.
*  Increasing wage cuts was the *opposite* of what Krushchev did. He acknowledged financial needs, not worsened them.

Therefore, increasing wage cuts is not part of Krushchev's response as described in the passage.
"
Kuwa soo socda kee baa sabab u ahayn rabshadihii ka dhacay Poland?,"The correct answer is **B: Cunto yaraan** and **C: mushaar dhimis**.

The passage states that the initial reason for the protests was ""cunto yari iyo mushahar dhimis"" (food shortage and wage cuts). While the other options are related to the events, they weren't the *initial causes* of the unrest. The protests evolved into a broader demonstration against the government. 

Therefore, options B and C are the most direct and accurate reasons given in the text.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan saameyn ku yeelan xiriirka ka dhexeeya Midowga Sofiyetka iyo Maraykanka?","The correct answer is **C: Hababka is-burinaya (Systems of disintegration)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dagaalkii markuu dhamaaday isku dhacii nidaamyada, dhaqamada iyo hababka ayaa keenay in labada dal kala tagaan."" (After the war ended, the clash of systems, cultures, and methods led the two countries to diverge.) This directly links the clash of systems to the breakdown of their relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *most* direct cause, although they are related:

* **A: Kala duwanaanshaha dhaqanka (Cultural differences):** Cultural differences contributed to the overall tension, but the passage highlights the *systemic* clash as the primary driver.
* **B: Fikradaha ku saabsan Jarmalka (Ideas about Germany):** While the division of Germany was a significant consequence of the war, the passage focuses on the broader ideological struggle between the US and USSR.
* **D: Khilaafaadka ku saabsan nidaamyada (Conflicts about systems):** This is a very close answer and important. However, the passage states the clash *of* systems, not just conflicts *about* them. ""Hababka is-burinaya"" (systems of disintegration) encompasses the broader breakdown and ideological confrontation.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the passage's emphasis on the clash of systems leading to the Cold War."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan si sax ah u qeexin ujeedada loo dirayo neerfe dareemayaasha dhamaan jirka oo dhan?,"The correct answer is **D: Ka fogaanshaha khataraha jirka ee iman kara (Avoiding bodily harm)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that nerve receptors send signals throughout the body to help the body avoid danger. This directly aligns with the function of detecting threats and triggering responses to protect the body.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Qulqulka dhiiga oo yaraada (Decreased blood flow):**  The text indicates that nerve signals *promote* blood flow to avoid danger, not decrease it.
*   **B: Maareynta qulqulka dhiigga (Management of blood flow):** While nerve signals *can* influence blood flow, the primary purpose stated is threat avoidance. ""Management"" is too broad.
*   **C: Ilaalinta isu dhelitiranka cunsarada (Protection of nutrient balance):** The text doesn't mention anything about nutrient balance as the primary function of nerve signals.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate description of the purpose of nerve receptors sending signals throughout the body as described in the text."
Maxaa laga heli karaa kurta Giza?,"The correct answer is **B: Macbadyo**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions ""macbuudyo iyo Calamada sawir"" (shrines and picture symbols) as being part of the Giza Plateau.  Shrines are a type of temple.
* While the text mentions pyramids (which can be associated with temples), it doesn't directly state that the Giza Plateau *contains* all seven wonders of the world or specifically the Great Temple.
* The text refers to ""Arhaamta Masar"" (the Tombs of Egypt), emphasizing burial structures (pyramids and tombs) more than temples.  However, temples were also a significant part of the complex.

Therefore, ""Macbadyo"" (Shrines/Temples) is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Maxay ahayd ujeedada Haramka Wayn?,"The correct answer is **B: Si loo sharfo Fircoon (To honor the Pharaoh)**.

The passage states: ""The great pyramids were made to house Pharaoh Khufu..."" This directly indicates the pyramids, including the Great Pyramid, were built to honor and house the Pharaoh.
"
Yaa mas'uul ka ah marka loo eego aqoontena aan u leenahay dab-qabayaashii burburiyay macbadka?,"The correct answer is **D: Artemis**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Herostratus burned down the temple of Artemis.
* Herostratus's motivation was to achieve fame, and the Ephesians vowed never to mention his name.
* The question asks who is responsible *according to our knowledge* of the fire. The fire was directly caused by Herostratus.
* While Alexander the Great later funded the rebuilding, he wasn't responsible for the initial burning. Strabo simply documented the name of the perpetrator. The goddess Artemis was the deity the temple was dedicated to, but not the cause of the fire."
Waa kee bayaanka saxda ah oo ku saabsan dib u dhiska macbudka Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Waxaa dib loo dhisay ka dib Casrigii Alexander-ka Waynaa** (It was rebuilt after the Age of Alexander the Great).

Here's why:

* The text states Alexander the Great offered to fund the rebuilding, but his offer was rejected. 
* The temple was eventually rebuilt in 323 BCE, which is after Alexander's death (and therefore, after his ""Age""). 
* Option A is incorrect because Alexander *offered* funding, he didn't *pay* for it.
* Option C is incorrect because Herostratus was the one who *caused* the destruction, not responsible for the rebuilding.
* Option D is incorrect because the rebuilding happened in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE, and it was after Alexander's time.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayay ahayd markii ugu horreysay ee nooc laga yaabo inuu ku socdo laba lugood?","The correct answer is **A: Todoba milyan oo sano ka hor**.

The text states: ""Sahelanthropus ay laba lugood ku socdeen ilaa iyo 7 milyan oo sannadood ka hor..."" (Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago...).
"
Midkee ka mid ah noocyadan baa si joogto ah ugu socday laba cagood?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* **Homo Erectus** is explicitly mentioned as having walked upright (toos ah) and that this behavior developed about 2 million years before the emergence of Homo Erectus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Sahelanthropus:** While there's evidence they *might* have walked bipedally, the timeframe is very early (up to 7 million years ago), and it's not definitively established as a consistent behavior.
* **Bipedal specializations:** This is a general term, not a specific species.
* **Australopithecus:** The text states that Australopithecus did *not* walk upright in the same way as later hominins. They were more likely to be facultative bipeds (walking upright occasionally).



"
Maxay ahaayeen ciidamada badda ee Jarmalku waxa ay isku dayayeen in ay qabtaan intii lagu jiray Dagaalkii labaad ee dunida?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka-hortagga in Ingiriisku ay hesho dadka iyo badeecadaha.**

The passage explicitly states that the German Navy used U-boats to try and prevent the movement of people and goods to and from Britain across the Atlantic. This was a key objective for them during WWII.
"
"Iyada oo lagu saleynayo macluumaadka lagu xusay qoraalka, yaa ugu guulaha badnaa dagaalka badda intii lagu jiray Ololihii Waqooyiga Atlantiga?","The correct answer is **D: Ingiriiska**.

Here's why: The text states that the Allied forces (specifically mentioning the effort to get supplies and troops to England) were trying to counter the German U-boat campaign. The text implies that if the U-boats had succeeded in stopping the flow of supplies, Germany might have been able to conquer England. Therefore, the success of the Allied efforts (and thus, the success of the ""dagaalka badda"" from their perspective) was crucial in preventing a German victory.
"
Maxaa aan jirin markii Aashuuriyiintu ay hirgeliyeen adeegsiga fardooleyda?,"The correct answer is **A: koore (bow)**.

The text states: ""Kooraha weli lama ikhtiraacin, markaan fardooladii Asiiriyaanku waxay ku dagaalami jireen fardaha oo caddaysimo ah."" This translates to: ""The bow hadn't been invented yet, when Assyrian chariots fought on foot.""

Therefore, the Assyrians used chariots and fought on foot because the bow hadn't been invented yet.
"
Sidee loo dagaallamaa dagaalladii loo adeegsado fardoolayda?,"The correct answer is **C: Faraska korkiisa (On top of the horse)**.

The passage states: ""Fardoolay waa ciidan ku kor dagaalama fardaha guudkooda."" which translates to ""The Fardoolay is a soldier who fights on the horses themselves."" Therefore, they fought *on top of* the horses.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lug ku taagnid (Standing on the ground):** The passage describes them fighting *on* the horses, not on the ground.
*   **B: Dirac bireed la,aan (Without a leather shield):** The passage doesn't mention shields in relation to Fardoolay.
*   **D: Askar yar (Small soldiers):** While Fardoolay were soldiers, the key characteristic described is their fighting *on* the horses.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, halkeed ka heli kari weyday celcelis ahaan muwaadin reer Baabiloon ah?","The correct answer is **A: Keenida allabaryo barxadda macbudka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dadku waxay sadaqo u keeni jireen sanamyada wadaaduna **iyo waxay isku dayiin jireen inay daboolaan baahiyaha sanamyada iyagoo adeegsanaya xaflado iyo sabyaal.**"" This directly supports the idea that people brought offerings (allabaryo) to the temple courtyard.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ka qayb galka xaflada macbadka aasaasiga ah:** The passage mentions ceremonies and rituals, but doesn't specifically say everyone could participate in the foundational ceremonies.  The priests had a special inner sanctuary.
* **C: Xiliga iidda ee barxadda macbadka:** While offerings might have been more common during festivals, the passage doesn't explicitly link festivals to offering in the courtyard.
* **D: Keenista allabaryo gudaha mowlaca:** The passage states only priests could enter the inner, sacred sanctuary. Common citizens would not have had access to bring offerings there.



"
Kuwa soo socda kee baa si gaar ah loogu talagalay wadaaddada kaniisada?,"The correct answer is **B: Mowlacyo gudaha ah (Inner sanctuaries)**.

The passage states: ""Kanisad kasta waxay leedahay goob beereed furan kadibna gudaha waxay ku ledahay goob nabdoon taasi oo ay galikaraan karo kaliya wadaadadu.""  This directly translates to ""Every temple has an open courtyard and inside it has a sanctuary that only priests can enter.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Damaashaadka (Processions):** While processions might be part of religious practices, the passage doesn't link them specifically to priests.
* **C: Xafladaha (Ceremonies):** Ceremonies are mentioned as part of offering to the gods, but not as a specific space for priests.
* **D: Dhismaha Ziguratka (Construction of Ziggurats):** The passage describes the structure of a temple and the ziggurat's role as a platform for the deity, but doesn't connect its construction to priests in a special way.



"
Goorma ayuu Boqor Tutankhamun caan noqday?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka dib markii la helay qabrigiisa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Helistii la helay qabrigiisa 1922 ayaa caan ka dhigtay."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.)
"
Maxaa Boqor Tutankhamun ka dhigay boqor Masari ah oo caan ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Daahfurkii qabrigiisa oo aan qasnayn (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun wasn't particularly important during his lifetime and wasn't listed among the recent pharaohs.
* The *discovery* of his largely intact tomb in 1922 is what brought him fame and cemented his place in history.  The fact that it was largely untouched distinguishes it from many other tombs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maqaamkiisa ee liisaska boqoradii hore (His position on the list of former pharaohs):** The passage says he wasn't particularly important during his reign, so his position on a list of former pharaohs isn't the reason for his fame.
* **C: Dhaca kumanyaal agab oo qabrigiisa laga dhacay (The discovery of thousands of artifacts from his tomb):** While the discovery of artifacts is important, the *discovery of the tomb itself* is the primary reason for his fame. The artifacts are a result of the tomb's discovery.
* **D: Muhiimadda uu lahaa xilliyadii hore ee Masaarida (His importance in earlier periods of Egyptian history):** The passage states he wasn't particularly important during his reign, so his importance in earlier periods isn't the reason for his fame.



"
Gabayaaga Giriigga ee Homer muxuu awoodikari waayay inuu sameeyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Hadal** (Speech).

The passage states that Homer is known as the ""father of poetry"" and that his epics, the Iliad and Odyssey, ""bring together the knowledge of the Greeks."" This implies he excelled in *oral* tradition – telling stories and poems through spoken word. The question asks what he *couldn't* do.  While he didn't necessarily *lack* the ability to speak, the focus on his poetic skill suggests it was his primary domain.  The options of sight, walking, and speech are all abilities, but the context implies his strength lay in verbal storytelling/poetry.



"
Giriiggee caan ah ee lagu yaqaan wax aan suugaanta ahayn?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

* **Homer** is known as the father of Greek epic poetry.
* **Sophocles** and **Aristophanes** were renowned playwrights.
* **Pythagoras** was a mathematician and philosopher known for his theories on numbers and geometry, specifically the Pythagorean theorem. He wasn't primarily known for poetry or drama.

Therefore, Pythagoras is the Greek figure from the options who wasn't primarily known for his poetic or dramatic works.
"
Halkee ayay qoyska Cibriyiinta ku qaadan jireen wakhtigooda intiisa badan?,"The correct answer is **A: Hawada furan**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Badiyaa nolosha qoyska hebrowga waxay ka dhacday meel hawada u furan."" (The majority of Hebrew family life took place in open air.)
"
Maxaa aan aad muhiim ugu ahayn qoyska Cibriga?,"The correct answer is **A: Cimilada**.

The passage states: ""Cimilada diirran ee Bariga Dhexe, gurigu sidaas muhiim uma ahayn."" (The harsh climate of the Middle East, the house was not that important.) This directly addresses what was *not* important to the Jewish people in that region.
"
Kuwan soo socda midkee baan lagu sifeyn faraqa u dhexeeya wadamada Iskandaneefiyanka?,"The correct answer is **A: Taariikhda**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...waxaa jiray farqiyo badan oo u dhaxeeya dadka,boqorada, goobaha hubinta iyo **taariikhda** Dermak, Iswidhan, Norway iyo Iceland."" (There were many differences between the people, kings, places of securing and **history** of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.)

While the passage mentions other differences (people, rulers, places of securing), it specifically highlights the differences in *history* as a key factor distinguishing these Nordic nations.  The other options are present differences but history is the one directly mentioned as a differentiator.



"
Yaa markii hore degay Greenland?,"The correct answer is **A: Qabiilada Eskimo**.

The passage states explicitly: ""Inkastoo waddan walba uu ahaa 'iskandaneefiyaan',waxaa jiray farqiyo badan oo u dhaxeeya dadka,boqorada, goobaha hubinta iyo taariikhda Dermak, Iswidhan, Norway iyo Iceland. **Qabiilooyinka Eskimo halkaas ayay marka horeba ku noolayeen.**"" (Although each country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the people, kings, settlements and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland. **The Eskimo tribes were already living there.**)
"
Kooxdee ayaa doorbidaysa inay wax ku cunaan kuraas la'aan?,"The correct answer is **D: Dumarka Roomaaniyaanka faqiirka ah**

The passage states: ""fuqarada iyo dumarku cuntadooda cuneen iyagoo ku fadhiya kuraasi..."" which translates to ""the poor and women ate their food sitting on chairs...""
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ka mid noqon doonin waliimooyinkii hore ee Roomaanka?,"The correct answer is **D: Saxan diiq turki ah oo duban (A roasted turkey)**.

The text explicitly states that Romanians did not have turkey. Options A, B, and C all describe aspects of Roman dining that *were* mentioned in the text.
"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa aan laga yaabin in uu saameyn waara yeesho?","The correct answer is **B: Dhaqan yara (Small cultures)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dhaqamada yar yar badana way dhumaan ayagoo aan ka tagin wax tariikh cadeen la xirirta hadhowna waa la aqoonsan waayaa inay tahay sida ilbaxnimo sax ah.""  This translates to: ""Small cultures often fade away without leaving any historical evidence linked to them, and are recognized as not being a true civilization.""

This indicates that small cultures *cannot* have a lasting, influential impact in the way a true civilization (civilization) does.  The passage implies they don't have the longevity or historical weight to be considered comparable.

Let's look at why the other options *could* have had an impact:

* **A: Bulshada (Societies):** The passage defines civilization *as* a society that cooperates and works together. Societies are the building blocks of civilization.
* **C: Magaalo-goboleed (City-states):** The passage states that city-states were precursors to nations. They are a key component of the development of civilization.
* **D: Dhaqan ilbaxnimo (Civilization):** This is the central topic of the passage, so it inherently has an impact.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa ummad ka horrmara?","The correct answer is **C: Magaalo-goboleed (Maamulada-Magaaloyin)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Maamulada-Magaaloyin ayaa horjeege qaramada."" which translates to ""City-States were the predecessors of nations.""

Weedhee ku saabsan Drukgyal Dzong oo aan run ahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxaa loo dhisay si loogu dabaaldego guushii ciidamada Tibetan-Mongol.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Waxa la sheegaa in 1649 kii, uu Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel uu sameeyay qalcadda si uu ugu xuso guushii u ka guulaystay xoogagii Tibetan-Mongol."" (It is said that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress to commemorate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongol forces.)  This means option A is *true*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Waxay ku taal Bhutan** - The text explicitly states Drukgyal Dzong is in the Paro district of Bhutan. This is *true*.
* **C: Dab ayaa baabi'iyay in badan oo ka mid ah agabkii qalcaddii** - The text says a fire in 1951 destroyed much of the fortress, but it doesn't say *in badan oo ka mid ah agabkii* (much of the artifacts). It says the roof was destroyed.  This is partially true, but not completely accurate.
* **D: Waxaa sameeyay Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - The text states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the fortress. This is *true*.

Therefore, the best answer, focusing on a statement that is explicitly stated as being true in the text, is **A**."
Weedhee ayaa si sax ah u qeexaysa natiijada dabka Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxa kaliya ee haray waa sawirka Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""1951 kii, ayaa dab waxooga asaartii Drukgyal Dzong ah oo qura soo reebay, sawirkaas oo kale ayuu lahaa Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel."" This means the *only* thing that remained from the fire was a painting of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ciidamada Tibetan-Mongol waxa ay ahaayeen kuwa guulaystay:** The text says the Dzong was built to commemorate a victory *over* the Tibetan-Mongol forces. The fire was a result of their attack.
* **C: Soo jiidashada shacbiyadeed maysan saameyn:** The text says the Dzong became one of Bhutan's best tourist destinations *after* the fire, indicating the fire *did* have an impact (though perhaps initially negative).
* **D: Waxaa xafiday Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** While Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the Dzong, the text doesn't say he *protected* it from the fire. In fact, the fire destroyed the Dzong.



"
Keebaa run ah weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan Kambodiya?,"The correct answer is **D: Taylandiisku waxay burburiyeen Phnom Penh**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Thais wuxuu weeraray Cambodia dhawr jeer intii lagu jiray qarnigii 18aad iyo 1772 waxay burburiyeen Phnom Phen."" This directly translates to ""Thais attacked Cambodia several times during the 18th century and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Phen.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fiitnaamiisku waxay burburiyeen Phnom Penh** - The passage says the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **B: Kambodiya waxay ku soo duushay Taylaan 1772** - The passage states the Thais attacked Cambodia in 1772, not the other way around.
* **C: Kambodiya waxa ku soo duulay Fiitnaamiiska bilawgii qarnigii 18aad** - The passage says the Vietnamese entered Cambodia in the *last* year of the 18th century, not at the beginning.



"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda si sax ah u qeexaya duulaanada Kambodiya?,"The correct answer is **B: Taylaandiiska iyo Fiitnaamiisku waxay kusoo duuleen Kambodiya 1772**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Thailand attacked Cambodia multiple times during the 18th century and that in 1772, Vietnam entered Cambodia. This means both Thailand and Vietnam were involved in invasions during that period.
* Option B accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fiitnaamisku waxay ku soo duuleen Kambodiya dhowr jeer** - While Vietnam did invade multiple times, the passage specifically mentions 1772. Option B is more precise.
* **C: Fiitnaamiisku waxay burburiyeen Phnom Penh** - The passage states that Thailand destroyed Phnom Penh, not Vietnam.
* **D: Taylaandiisku waxay ku soo duuleen Kambodiya dhowr jeer** - While Thailand did invade multiple times, the passage mentions Vietnam entering Cambodia in 1772. Option B includes both.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda baysan Shirkadda Holandiska Bariga Hindiya aysan samayn muddadii ay joogeen Taywaan?,"The correct answer is **D: Rabitaanka inay xukunka Taywaan uga tanasulaan boqortooyada qoyska Jing.**

Here's why:

* The passage clearly states that the Dutch East India Company *established* a Southern West Point headquarters, *introduced* sugarcane cultivation, and *employed* Chinese laborers. This eliminates options A, B, and C.
* The passage implies the Dutch were focused on economic activities and establishing a trading post. There's no mention of them wanting to *replace* the Qing dynasty's rule. They were there to exploit resources and trade, not to take over the governance.



Therefore, option D is the only action the Dutch East India Company *did not* undertake during their time in Taiwan, based on the information given.
"
Muxuu aasaasay Heshiiskii Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **A: Guuldaradii Japan ee dagaalkii ugu horeeyay ee Shiinaha iyo Japan**.

Here's why: The passage states: ""Sanaddii 1895tii, kadib guurdaradii Dagaalki koowaad ee shiinaha iyo Jabaaniiska, xukuumadda Qing waxay saxiixday heshiiska Shimonoseki ee madaxbanaanida Taiwan loogu wareejinayay Jabaan..."" This directly links the signing of the Shimonoseki Agreement to Japan's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War.
"
Sidee loo cabbiraa heerka pH ee kiimikada?,"The correct answer is **C: Qadarka ions,ka Haydarjiinka ee ku jira maadada kiimikada** (The amount of hydrogen ions in the chemical).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Heera pH ka waxa muujiya inta Hydrogen ah (H ta ku jirta pH) ee ku jirta kiimikada la tijaabiyay."" (The pH level shows the amount of Hydrogen (H in pH) in the chemical being tested.)
* **Hydrogen ions (H+)** are specifically mentioned as the component determining the pH level.
* **Option C** directly reflects this by stating that pH measures the amount of hydrogen ions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sidee bay kiimikadu aasaas u tahay ama aysiidh u tahay** (How is the chemical basic or acidic): While pH *indicates* acidity or basicity, it's not *defined* by it. It's the concentration of hydrogen ions that determines whether a substance is acidic or basic.
* **B: Immisa borotoono ayaa ku jira maadada kiimikada** (How many protons are in the chemical):  While hydrogen ions *do* contain a proton, the pH level isn't simply about the total number of protons. It's about the *concentration* of hydrogen ions.
* **D: Immisa elektaroonig ah ayaa ku jira maadada kiimikada** (How many electrons are in the chemical):  Electrons are related to protons (and therefore hydrogen ions), but the pH level is specifically about hydrogen ions, not the total number of electrons.



"
"Maxaa laga saaray ions,ka Haydarjinka?","The correct answer is **A: Borotoono**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hydrogen ions waa borotons laa saary elektoroniska..."" which translates to ""Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons...""

Therefore, hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons.
"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin kibirka libaaxyada?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxay u dhaqmaan si la mid ah kooxaha eeyaha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Libaaxyadu waxay u dhaqmaan badanaa sida tumbulo yey iyo ey ah..."" This directly compares their social behavior to that of wolf packs.
* **Option B** is irrelevant to the passage's description of their social structure.
* **Option C** is also not directly supported by the passage. While it mentions close ties, it doesn't detail the nature of those ties in a way that defines their ""kibir"" (pride/social structure).
* **Option D** is too broad. While the passage mentions their hunting prowess, it's the comparison to wolf packs that more specifically defines their social behavior.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided text.
"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin hab-dhaqanka libaaxyada?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhaqankoodu wuxuu la mid yahay bisadaha kale ee waaweyn.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Libaaxyadu waxay u dhaqmaan badanaa sida tumbulo yey iyo ey ah, xayawaanadaaso si dhow libaaxa ugu eeg ( laakiin maaha sida bisadaha kale ee waawayn) dhaqan ahaan...""

This means their behavior *is* similar to that of larger cats, contradicting option D being the *incorrect* answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waa kuwo bulsho yaqaan ah:** While the passage mentions they live in social groups, the statement isn't unique to them and doesn't specifically define their behavior.
*   **B: Hab-dhaqankoodu wuxuu la mid yahay kan yeeyga:** The passage doesn't make any comparison to meerkats.
*   **C: Labka iyo dheddigga labaduba aad bay dilaa ugu yihiin dhanka ugaadhsiga:** While the passage mentions their hunting skills, it doesn't say they are *more* skilled than other animals in this aspect. It just states they are good hunters.

Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately reflects a point made in the provided text and is therefore the incorrect option."
Bakaylaha ugaadh caadiya wuxuu u yahay ugaadhsade noocee ah?,"The correct answer is **C: Bisadaha dhexdhexaadka ah (Medium-sized cats)**.

The passage states that the cats in question range in size from wildcats to lynxes, and then mentions smaller cats like stray cats that eat very small prey. This indicates a range of sizes, with the core group being medium-sized cats. Therefore, the average wildcat in this context would be a medium-sized cat.
"
Bisadaha yaryar inta badan waxay ugaarsadaan kuwan soo socda kee?,"The correct answer is **C: Biciid (Sparrows)**.

The passage states that the small kittens specialize in hunting very small prey like ""shinbiraha, bulacyada, dowliyada, cayayaanka yar yar"" which translates to ""sparrows, butterflies, moths, small insects.""  Out of the options provided, sparrows (biciid) are the closest match to that description.
"
Midkee kuwan soo socda aan ka mid ahayn habka ugaarsiga ocelot?,"The correct answer is **B: Iyagoo sanka la raacaya urta xayawaanka ay ugaadhasanayaan (By following the scent of the prey's tracks).**

Here's why:

* The passage states that ocelots rely on their **excellent night vision and stealthy movement** to hunt. They **camouflage themselves** and pounce. 
* While scent is important for many predators, the passage **doesn't mention ocelots specifically following scent tracks.**
* The other options are directly mentioned in the passage as part of their hunting strategy:
    * **A: isku dhex qarinta agagaarkooda (Camouflaging themselves in their surroundings)** -  This is explicitly stated.
    * **C: Iyagoo sii daba gala ugaadhoda habeenkii (Following the prey's scent at night)** - This is implied by their excellent night vision and stealthy hunting.
    * **D: Kaliya ugaadhsanaya xoolaha xajmiga yar leh (Only hunting small prey)** - This is mentioned as part of their diet.



Therefore, following scent tracks is not a described hunting method for ocelots in the provided text.



"
Midkee kuwan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dareenkooda urta waa daciif**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Saynis yahanada waxa ay umaleeyaan in bisada duur joogta Mareykanka in shiiriso xayawaanka ay cuneyso ayadoo raad raaceyso. Si fiican ayay mugdiga wax ugu arki karaan iyagoo adeegsanaya aragti habeeneedkooda, iyagoo sidoo kale si dhabbacasho ah u soconaaya. Guduudanayaashu ugaadhsadaan iyagoo isku qarinaya deegaankooda oo ku dul boodaya ugaadhooda.""  This implies ocelots are stealthy and have good night vision, meaning their sense of smell is likely *strong*, not weak.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Waxay awoodaan inay si fiican u ugaarsadaan habeenkii** - The text explicitly mentions they have good night vision.
* **B: Waxay u dhaqaaqaan si dagan** - The text states they move stealthily.
* **D: Waxay doorbidaan inay ugaarsadaan xoolaha yar-yar** - The text says they hunt small animals.



"
Midkee kuwan soo socda aan loo tixgelin doonin xoogga ugu weyn ee shabeelka?,"The correct answer is **B: Tafitaanka (Tafinta)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states Shabeel (Leopard) has strength in:**
    * **Dabbaalan karaa (Leaping)**
    * **Masaafo dheer boodi karaa (Jumping long distances)**
    * **Waxna ku jiidi karaa awood shan laab ka badan ta aadamaha (Pulling with the strength of five times that of a human)**

* **The options:**
    * **Guuxa (Climbing):** While leopards *can* climb, the passage doesn't highlight it as a primary strength.
    * **Tafitaanka (Tafinta - Digging):** The passage provides no information about leopards' digging abilities. It's not mentioned as a strength.
    * **Bootinta (Pouncing/Leaping):** Directly mentioned as a strength.
    * **Jiidida (Pulling):** Directly mentioned as a strength.

Therefore, digging is the skill not mentioned as a key strength of the leopard in the passage.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kee baa ah farqiga u dhexeeya shabeel iyo libaax?","The correct answer is **B: Codkooda guuxa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cida shabeelku uma eeka cida libaaxa, balse waxay aad ugu dhawdahay kalmado loogu dhawaaqay si cadho leh."" (The leopard doesn't resemble the wolf, but it is very close to sounds that are vocalized loudly.) This directly indicates that the main difference highlighted in the text is their vocalizations (how they make sounds).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Awoodooda dabaasha:** The text mentions the leopard can swim and its swimming ability, but it doesn't say it's different from wolves.
*   **C: Masaafada booditaankooda:** The text says leopards can leap far, but doesn't indicate this is a defining difference from wolves.
*   **D: Xoogooda jiiditaanka:** The text mentions the leopard's strength in pulling, but it doesn't say it's different from wolves.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **B**."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, muxuu Robert Hooke sameeyay kahor aqoonyahanada bayolojiga ee kale?","The correct answer is **A: U fiirsashada unugyada dhintay.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Isaguu ahaa qofkii ugu horeeyay ee arka unugyo dhintay."" (He was the first person to see dead cells.)
"
"""Waa maxay asalka ereyga """"unug"""" macnaheedu?""","The correct answer is **B: Qol yar**.

The text explicitly states: ""Unug waxa laga keenay kelmadda Laatiinka ah ee cella taasoo la macno ah qol yar."" (The word ""cell"" comes from the Latin word ""cella"" which means small room.)
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, xayawaanka badankoodu waxay awood u leeyihiin inay sameeyaan maxay?","The correct answer is **A: Duulaan**.

The passage states: ""Dhulkay godad ku qortaan, badaha ku dabbaashaan, cirkana way duulaan."" which translates to ""They dig in the earth, swim in the seas, and fly in the sky.""
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa xoolaha qaar ayanan lahayn?","The correct answer is **C: Maskax**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Xayawaanada waxa laga helaa dhammaan adduunka. Dhulkay godad ku qortaan, badaha ku dabbaashaan, cirkana way duulaan. Inta badan xayawaanada waa ay socdaan. Xayawaanada oo keliya ayaa leh maskaxyo (inkasto dhamaan xayawaanadu ayna wada lahayn tusaale ahaan; xayawaan badeedka,malaha wax maskax ah)."" This indicates that while most animals have brains, not all animals have them (referring to aquatic animals as an example)."
"Maxaa ka caawiya dhirta nidaamka ee photosynthesis,ka?","The correct answer is **D: Qorax**.

The passage states: ""Dhirtu waxay cuntada ka samaysaa qoraxda iyadoo isticmaalaysa habka footosintasiska."" (Trees make food from sunlight using the process of photosynthesis.)

Therefore, sunlight is essential for photosynthesis, which is how trees create their food and release oxygen.
"
Maxay dadku neefsadaan oo ay dhirtu jiidaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kaarboon ogsaydhka (Carbon dioxide)**.

The passage states: ""Dhirtu waxa ay sameyaan oxygen-ka bini'aadamka neefsado, waxa ayna qaatan carbon-dioxide-ka bini aadamka dibada usoo neefsado."" (Trees produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they take the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.)
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, tusaalayaashan soo socda keebaa caqabad ku noqon kara geedi socodka horumarka?","The correct answer is **A: Koox yar oo ku guuldarraysatay horumar ka samayso meel cusub.**

Here's why:

The passage describes how a population moving to a new environment undergoes a process called ""mesoprivation,"" where they diverge from the original population due to different resources and competition. The passage states that if the initial group *fails* to adapt and become competitors, they will fall behind the new population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Qayb ka mida hal bulsho oo u guuraya meel cusub:** This is the *start* of the process described in the passage, not a barrier to progress.
*   **C: Dadweyne hagaajinaya wax ka badalaya la qabsiga deegaan cusub:** This describes the adaptation process itself, and isn't a barrier.
*   **D: Hal dadwayne ayaa aakhirka sameya laba:** This is irrelevant to the passage's description of population dynamics and mesoprivation.

Therefore, the failure of a small group to adapt and progress in a new environment is the barrier to development outlined in the text.



"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah u qeexin habka kala saaridda noocyada? ,"The correct answer is **D: Dhacdadeedu waa lama huraan**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes speciation as an inevitable outcome of evolution.** It states, ""Meesiyayntu waa natiijo aan la gafi karin waana qayb muhiima oo isged geddiga ka mid ah"" (Speciation is an unavoidable outcome and an important part of the tree of life).
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Waxay dhacdaa marka dadwayne cusub ay awoodi waayaan inay la qabsadaan** (It happens when new populations cannot compete). While competition plays a role, it's not the *definition* of speciation.
    * **B: Waa qayb muhiim ah oo ka mid ah nidaamka horumarinta** (It is an important part of the development system). This is true, but it doesn't fully capture the core concept of speciation.
    * **C: Waxay tilmaamaysaa samaynta nooc cusub** (It describes the creation of a new species).  While speciation *results* in a new species, the passage describes the *process* of how that happens, not just the outcome.

Therefore, ""Dhacdadeedu waa lama huraan"" (Its occurrence is inevitable) best encapsulates the meaning of speciation as presented in the passage.



"
Qaybtee ka mid ah habka wareegga dhiigga ayaa dhiigga u keena wadnaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Xididdada dhiigga (Blood vessels)**.

Here's why:

* **Xididdada dhiigga** (blood vessels) are the pathways that carry blood throughout the body. They are responsible for bringing blood *to* the heart and taking it away.
* **Halbowlayaasha (Capillaries)** are the smallest blood vessels and are where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste occurs. They are part of the circulation, but not the primary pathways *to* the heart.
* **Xubnaha (Organs)** are the body's organs and are supplied with blood by blood vessels, but aren't the vessels themselves.
* **Aroor (Arteries)** are a type of blood vessel that carry blood *away* from the heart.
"
Waa kuwee tuubooyinka ugu yar-yar habka wareegga dhiigga?,"The correct answer is **D: Xubnaha (Capillaries)**.

The passage states: ""Qasabadaha ugu yaryar waxaa la dhahaa kaabilariis,"" which translates to ""The smallest tubes are called capillaries.""
"
Awooda uu cayayaanku u leeyahay in uu baalashiisa dhabarka u laabto waxa ay kordhisa kuwa soo socda midkee?,"The correct answer is **B: meelaha qarsoon**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to retract their wings allows birds to hide in small spaces, which helps them avoid predators. Therefore, the ability to retract wings primarily contributes to finding **hidden places**.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: sahayda cuntada (Food supply):** While flight helps find food, the wing retraction specifically aids in hiding, not directly in finding food.
*   **C: Helitaanka saaxiibo (Finding friends):** The passage doesn't mention wing retraction playing a role in social interactions.
*   **D: Xawaaraha duulimaadka (Flight speed):** Wing retraction is about maneuverability and hiding, not necessarily about speed.

"
Kuwa soo socda keebaa aan lagu xusin qoraalka sida shay ay saamayso awoodda duulista ee cayayaanka?,"The correct answer is **C: Ururinta cuntada (Gathering food)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the ability to fly helped birds ""easily escape their enemies and also **seek food**.""  The other options are not mentioned in relation to how flight impacts birds.
"
Midkee ka mid ah sifooyinka soo socda ee aan inta badan lala xiriirin daynasoorada?,"The correct answer is **A: Lug-dambe ku socodka**.

The text explicitly states: ""waxay labadooda lugood ee danbe ugu socdaan sida T-Rex."" (their two back legs walk like a T-Rex.) This directly links the dinosaurs being discussed to the characteristic of walking on two legs.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baalal (Wings):** The text mentions dinosaurs *don't* have wings.
* **C: Ukun dhigista (Egg-laying):** While many dinosaurs laid eggs, the text doesn't specifically highlight this as a defining characteristic being discussed.
* **D: Cago ciddi leh (Clawed feet):** The text mentions ""ciddiyo leh"" (claws), but it doesn't say this is a defining feature *associated* with dinosaurs in the way that bipedalism (walking on two legs) is.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan loo tixgalin sifada ay wadaagaan shimbiraha iyo daynasoorada?,"The correct answer is **C: Awooda duulimaad (The ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that dinosaurs are not considered because they have wings for flying.** This makes flight a key difference between dinosaurs and birds (shimbiraha).
* **The passage lists several similarities:** laying eggs (ukun dhigista), using their hind legs for locomotion (isticmaalka labada lugood ee dambe si ay u socdaan), and having claws (cago ciddi leh).

Therefore, the ability to fly is the *least* shared characteristic between dinosaurs and birds, and the question asks for the characteristic *not* shared.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, qaybtee ka mid ah geedka cycad ayaa laga yaabaa in Triceratops ay u badan tahay inay cunaan?","The correct answer is **A: Caleemaha qodxaha leh (leaves with a fringe)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Taraysatoobyadu waxay afkooda dhuuban ee xooggan u adeegsan kari jireen inay ku diirtaan caleemaha ka hor intanaay cunin jiradda."" (Triceratops used their strong beak to graze on leaves before eating the stems).
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, keebaa kuwan soo socda ay u badan tahay in Triceratops ku cuno? ","The correct answer is **D: Geed leh miro sun ah**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that some scientists believe Triceratops ate a type of grass called *Cycadales*.
* The passage also notes that while some scientists debate whether Triceratops could eat very tough plants, modern-day rhinoceroses (related to dinosaurs) and other animals eat tough leaves and fruit.
* The key detail is the comparison to modern animals eating tough *fruit*. This suggests the Triceratops diet likely included tougher vegetation, perhaps with fruit or parts of plants that weren't entirely fibrous.
* Option D is the closest to the details provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xayawaanka caajislowga (Sloths):** Sloths are known for eating leaves, but the passage doesn't mention sloths or their eating habits in relation to Triceratops.
* **B: Geedaha laamaha adag leh (Trees with tough branches):** While the passage discusses tough plants, it focuses on *grasses* and the potential for fruit/tough parts, not specifically trees with tough branches.
* **C: Baqbaqaaq da (Pterodactyls):** The passage states that it's unlikely Pterodactyls ate the vegetation because it was too tough.

The text states: ""Ciyaarha xagaaga ahaa ah kuwa ugu caansan gobolada waqooyiga, xeegada barafka iyo xeegada duubista..."" (Summer sports were the most popular in the northern regions, ice skating and skiing...).

Therefore, ice skating (xeegada barafka) is mentioned as being popular in the northern regions of Italy.

Kuwa soo socda kee baa saameeyay dhexdhexaadnimada Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **A: Qabsashadii Jarmalka**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Luxembourg waxay had iyo jeer isku dayi jirtay inay dal dhexdhexaada noqoto balse Dagaaladii Aduunka ee I iyo II waxa qabsaday Jarmalka."" (Luxembourg always tried to be a neutral country but the World Wars I and II were occupied by Germany.)

This directly indicates that the occupation by Germany significantly impacted Luxembourg's ability to remain neutral. The other options are either events that *led to* Luxembourg's current state (like the Belgian Revolution leading to separation) or events that happened *after* its attempts at neutrality (like joining the EU).

The text states: ""intaaso 755,688 iskuweer kiilomitir (291, 773 sq mi) ay ku jirto koonfur galbeed Asia iyo **23,764 iskuweer kiilomitir (9, 174 sq mi) ay ku jirto Yurub**""

This translates to: ""of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 sq mi) are in South West Asia and **23,764 square kilometers (9,174 sq mi) are in Europe**""
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, ilaa intee mayl ayuu gaarayaa dhererka Turkiga?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Dhulka Turkigu waxa uu dhererkiisu ka badan yahay 1,600 kilomitir (1,000 mi)..."" which translates to ""The land of Turkey is more than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) long...""
"
Maxay tahay luqadda Laatiinka ah ee magaalada Fatikanka laga isticmaalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Xafladaha diimeed**.

The text states: ""...badiyaa laga isticmaalo xafladaha diiniga ah."" (Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.)
"
"Magaalada Fatikanka, maxaa luuqada Talyaaniga aanan loo isticmaalin?","The correct answer is **C: Xafladaha diimeed**.

The passage states: ""Talyaanigu sidoo kale waa luuqada sida maalin laha ah ay u isticmaalaan badiyaa inta ka shaqaysa maamulka halka latinka badiyaa laga isticmaalo xafladaha diiniga ah."" This directly indicates that Latin is used for religious ceremonies in the Vatican City, while Italian is the everyday language for most official government work.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa ka faa'iidaysanaya isku dhafka dhawaaqa ee kumbuyuutarrada casriga ah?","The correct answer is **A: Muusiga (Music)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Musikada badana waxaa la lagu duuba iyadoo la isticmalayo qalabka kombuterada ee lagu hagaajiyo laguna daro codka.""  This translates to ""Music is often recorded using computer equipment that is used to enhance and add sound.""

While computers *can* be used for the other options (pictures, cartoons, etc.), the passage specifically mentions music being recorded and enhanced *with* computer equipment for sound. Therefore, music is the most directly and explicitly linked to the use of modern computer audio capabilities.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, inta badan guryaha xagee bay ku yaalliin kuwa ay musquluhu falaashka leeyihiin?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage states: ""Ku dhawaad guri kasta oo ku yaal magaalooyinka Harappa iyo **Mohenjo-daro** wuxu leeyahay musqulo la falaashiyo oo ku sii xiran bullaacado casri ah."" This directly indicates that houses with mud-brick walls and modern drains were common in Mohenjo-daro. The other options (Pharis, Santorini, and China) are not mentioned in the passage in relation to this architectural feature.
"
Waa kuwee meelaha soo socda ee laga helay hababka bulaacadaha ee horumarsan?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ku dhawaad guri kasta oo ku yaal magaalooyinka Harappa iyo Mohenjo-daro wuxuu leeyahay musqulo la falaashiyo oo ku sii xiran bullaacado casri ah."" (Near almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro has brick walls connected by modern drains.)

While the other locations had silos, the text *specifically* links advanced drainage systems (drains) with Harappa.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa sababa in uu iskeerku leexdo?,"The correct answer is **B: Labada geesood ee ku teedsan saxanka iskeerka (The two edges joined to the ice skate blade)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maadaama gunta safeexaddu xoogaa xoodan tahay, mar hadii safeexaddu dhinac u yara janjeedho, dhinacyada barafka taabanaya sidoo kale way xoodmaan. Tani ayaa u keensan karto inuu iskeytka wareegto..."" (Because the bottom of the blade is slightly curved, if the blade leans to the side, the edges touching the ice also curve. This can cause the skate to turn...).

The curvature of the *edges* of the blade is what causes the turning effect.  The edges are what make contact with the ice and allow for controlled turning.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Qallooca yar oo ku yaal xagga hoose ee saxanka iskeerka (A small curve on the bottom of the ice skate blade):** While there *is* a slight curve (camber) to the blade, it's more about the overall shape and not the primary cause of turning.
*   **C: Heerka xirfadda guud ee iskeerka (The overall skill level of the ice skate):**  Skill level affects how *well* someone can control the skate, but it doesn't *cause* the skate to turn.
*   **D: Tayada barafka (The quality of the ice):** Ice quality affects how easily the skate glides, but it doesn't directly cause the skate to turn.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa si sax ah u qeexaya godanka saxanka barafka casriga ah?","The correct answer is **D: La janjeershay (Beveled)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Maadaama gunta safeexaddu xoogaa xoodan tahay, mar hadii safeexaddu dhinac u yara janjeedho, dhinacyada barafka taabanaya sidoo kale way xoodmaan."" This translates to ""Because the edge of the plate is slightly beveled, if the plate tilts to one side, the sides touching the ice also bevel.""

Therefore, the key feature of a modern ice skate blade, according to the text, is that it is beveled.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, waa maxay habka u oggolaanaya atamka in ay ka takhalusaan tamarta dheeraadka ah ee iftiinka?","The correct answer is **B: Siidaynta fotoonada la qaabeeyay**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Si ay ugu noqdaan heerki tamarta hore, waa in ay iska saaran tamarta cusub ay ka heleen leerka. Waxay sameeyaan tani iyo ku qabanaya iftiinka walax yar oo lagu magacaabo """"footoon"""". Saynis yahanadu nidaamkan waxay u yaqaanaan “nidaamka isdhex galka u soo saaro fotanka” sababto ah atamka wuxuu ku sameeyma iftiinka, uu sababay nidaamka iftiinka fotanka iyo iftiinka noocisa yahay shucaca."" This translates to: ""To return to their initial energy level, they must release the new energy they received from the source. They do this by emitting faint light called a """"photon"""". Scientists call this process the “energy dissipation system through photon emission” because the atom creates light, causing the light photon system and the emitted light with radiation.""

* The passage explicitly mentions that atoms release energy by emitting photons. The process of *emitting* photons is the way they get rid of excess energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shucaaca (Radiation):** While photons *are* a type of radiation, the passage focuses on the process of *emitting* photons, not just radiation in general.
* **C: Fotoono (Photons):** Photons are the *result* of the process, not the process itself.
* **D: Kor u qaadida soo daynta shucaaca (Enhancement of radiation emission):** The passage discusses *dissipating* energy, not *enhancing* the emission of radiation.

Therefore, the most accurate option is **B: Siidaynta fotoonada la qaabeeyay (Emitting shaped photons)**, as it correctly reflects the process described in the text. While ""shaped photons"" isn't perfectly translated, it gets the core idea across.
"
Maxaa sababa in atamka uu soo daayo fotoono?,"The correct answer is **C: Heerarka tamarta aan degganayn**

Here's why:

* **The text explains that atoms release photons when they transition to lower energy levels.** This is a fundamental principle of atomic physics. When an atom absorbs energy (like from light), its electrons jump to higher energy levels. However, these higher energy states are unstable.  Electrons eventually fall back to lower, more stable energy levels, and when they do, they release the excess energy in the form of photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sii daynta tamarta xad dhaafka ah (Releasing excess energy):** While releasing energy *is* involved, the text specifically mentions transitions *between* energy levels, not just general excess energy.
* **B: Kor u kicida ay sababto iftiinka dhalaalaya (Excitation causes light emission):** Excitation *leads* to the potential for light emission, but it's the subsequent transition to lower levels that *actually* releases the photons.
* **D: Falcelin xun oo shucaac ah (Poor radiation interaction):**  The text discusses the interaction of light *with* atoms to cause energy absorption and subsequent release, so ""poor radiation interaction"" is the opposite of what's happening.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa aakhirka sababi doona in nalka iftiinka uu joojiyo shaqada?","The correct answer is **C: Fiilada gudaha laambada ayaa gubanaysa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kadib boqolaal saacadood oo shaqo ah fiilada nalka ugu dambayn way gubataa, nalkana ma sii shaqeeyo."" (After hundreds of hours of work, the filament of the bulb eventually burns out, and the bulb no longer works.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Laambada nalka oo aan si saxan loo damin:** While not turning off the light can shorten the bulb's lifespan, it doesn't cause it to burn out completely.
*   **B: Saldhigga birta laambada oo kaliya qayb ahaan ku jirta godka:** The position of the metal base doesn't directly cause the filament to burn out.
*   **D: Qulqulka korontada ee godka ayaa hoos u dhacaya:** The electricity flow doesn't decrease; it's the filament *reacting* to the electricity that causes it to burn out.



"
Kuwa soo socda keebaa khatar noqon kara in la taabto marka la bedelayo nalka?,"The correct answer is **B: Daaradamiyaha (The Transformer)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tani waa sababta oo ah korantada ku qulquleysa godka meesha qaybta biraha ku fadhida ay ku siin karto shoog koronto oo daran haddii aad taabato gudaha galka ama gunta birta inta ay wali qeyb ka tahay godka.""  This refers to the transformer (daaradamiyaha) within the electrical box.  It's the component that holds the electricity even after the main power is cut.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Fiilada (The Wire):** While wires carry electricity, the danger is specifically linked to the *transformer* when it's still live.
*   **C: Saldhigga laambada (The Light Socket):**  The light socket should be de-energized (power off) before working on the switch.
*   **D: Fiilada (The Wire):** Same reason as A. The danger isn't necessarily in the wires themselves, but in the energized transformer.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa dhacaya marka xudunta la kala qaybiyo?","The correct answer is **B: Tamar ayaa la sii daayaa**.

The passage states: ""Kala qayb samida bu'da waxay ku shaqaysaa xeer ah inay qaadato tamar si ay isugu keento bu'da borotoono iyo niyuutaroono badan. Wa sidii gaari culus oo buur kor loogu riixayo oo kale...Bu’da ayaa kala qaybsamaysa oo sii daynaysa waxooga tamar ah.""

The passage explicitly mentions that energy is released when the nucleus is split.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo ka tarjumaya wicitaanada masaafo dheer ee dhulka,"The correct answer is **B: dayax-gacmeedyada (rockets)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Markaad wacdo qof kumanaan mayl kuu jira, waxaad isticmaalaysaa dayax-gacmeed."" (When you call someone thousands of miles away, you use a rocket.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Teleskoobka (Telescopes):** Telescopes are used to *observe* things far away, not to transmit signals over vast distances.
* **C: Iftiinka (Light):** While light is used for communication (like radio waves), the passage highlights that rockets are the method used to *send* the signal over long distances.
* **D: Gantaallo (Satellites):** While satellites *receive* signals and relay them, the passage states that rockets are used to *initiate* the long-distance communication.



"
Kuwan kee baa loo isticmaalaa in lagu dajiyo teleskoobka bannaanka fog?,"The correct answer is **B: Gantaallo (Rockets)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""Waxa ay qaadaneysa gataal cabirkiisu yahay 100 fiit jooga in saterleyd ama talescope hada la geeyo."" This translates to ""It is taking a carrier that is 100 feet long to bring the satellite or telescope.""  The only practical way to get something that heavy into space is with a rocket.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **A: fallaaraha iftiinka (Light beams):**  Light beams aren't used to launch objects into space.
    * **C: Jawiga guud ee dhulka (Earth's atmosphere):** The atmosphere is what telescopes *try* to avoid, not use for launching.
    * **D: Dayax-gacmeedyada dhulka ka sarreeya 100 cagood (Earth-based rockets 100 feet high):**  A rocket that's only 100 feet high wouldn't have the power to reach orbit.

Therefore, rockets are the mechanism described in the passage for delivering the telescope into space."
Maxaa loo baahan yahay in la xusuusnaado oo ku saabsan dhacdo xilliyeedka si loo daba galo socodka waqtiga?,"The correct answer is **B: Ku celcelinta (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Waxaad waqtiga socdo ku qiyaasi kartaa indha indhaynta wax soo noqnoqdo. Wax soo noqnoqdo ayaa ah wax si joogto ah dhaco oo hadana dhaco.""  This directly links the perception of time to **repetition** - things happening regularly and consistently.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

*   **A: Muddada (Duration):** While duration is *part* of how we measure time, the passage emphasizes the *perception* of time through repeated events.
*   **C: Saamayn (Impact):** The passage mentions that time affects everything, but it's not the key to understanding the *flow* of time itself.
*   **D: Adag (Difficulty):** The passage acknowledges that time is hard to understand, but this isn't something to *remember* to grasp its flow; it's a characteristic of time itself.

Therefore, **repetition** is the most relevant concept to remember when trying to understand the flow of time, according to the passage.
"
"Sida ku xusun qoraalka, dhinacee ka mid ah dhacdada ee isticmaala wakhti si loo barbardhigo?","The correct answer is **A: Dhererka (Duration)**.

The passage states: ""Waqtigu isna sidoo kale waa sida aynu muddaynta (dhererka) dhacdooyinka isu barbar dhigno."" This directly translates to ""Time is also how we compare the duration of events.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ku celcelinta (Repetition):** While repetition is mentioned as a way to measure time (by observing recurring events), it's not the *direct* thing that time is used to compare *with*.
* **C: Khibrada (Experience):** Experience is not directly mentioned as a way time is used to compare events.
* **D: Saamayn (Impact):** The impact of events is a result of time passing, but the passage doesn't state that time is used to *compare* events based on their impact.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baa loo arkaa mid caadi u ah dhaxalka carshiga?","The correct answer is **B: Ka tagida jaamacada si ugu biiro ciidamada.**

Here's why:

The passage states that traditionally, those who come from royal families go directly to the military after school. Charles deviated from this tradition by attending university. Therefore, going directly to the military is the *normal* path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Helitaanka 2:2 darajo (Getting a 2:2 degree):** While Charles obtained a degree, a 2:2 degree is described as a lower-level grade, making it unusual for someone expected to immediately join the military.
*   **C: Barashada Taariikhda (Studying History):** Studying history is not inherently unusual.
*   **D: Aadista jaamacada kahor intusan ku biirin ciidanka (Attending university before joining the military):** This is exactly what Charles did, making it an exception, not the norm.



"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo xogta lagu xusay mariska, Charles wuxuu ahaa kii ugu horreeyay ee sameeyo maxay?","The correct answer is **C: Qaadashada shahaado digrii ah**.

The passage states: ""Charles waxa uu ahaa xubinkii ugu horeeyay ee qoyska Boqortooyada Ingiriiska ka mid ah ee la siiyo shahaado jaamacadeed."" (Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a university degree.)
"
Dalkee ayay ka yimaaddeen maraakiibta Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: Noorwiij**.

The text states that Olaf Trygvasson was a Norwegian who was trying to reclaim his kingdom from the Danes. Therefore, his ships came from Norway.
"
"Taariikhda waqti intee le,eg bay Jarmalku ku sameeyeen Istooniyanka saameyn dhaqameed xooggan?","The answer is **C: Qiyaastii 600 oo sano ka hor (Approximately 600 years ago)**.

The text states ""Qarniga 15aad"" which translates to the 15th century.  If the text is referencing a period in the 15th century and the impact is described as a ""bilowguu ilbaxnimada"" (the beginning of dominance), it implies a significant period of influence leading up to that point.  The 15th century is roughly 600 years ago (as of late 2023). The other options are too far off.
"
Luqada Istooniyaanka waxaa saameeyay maxay?,"The correct answer is **B: Xarfaha Jarmalka**.

The text explicitly states that German priests created the Estonian alphabet, adding the letter ""Õ/õ"" to it. It also mentions many words were borrowed from German. Therefore, the German alphabet is the primary influence.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, tirada dadka ku hadla afka Hindiga ayaa isbedbedelaya iyadoo lagu salaynayo qodobkee?","The correct answer is **A: Haddii lahjadaha Hindiga la midka ah la tiriyo** (If the dialects of Hindi are counted together).

The passage explicitly states: ""Tirada dadka luuqadda u dhashay way kala duwan tahay iyadoo ay ku xiran in la tiriyo lahjadaha aadka ugu dhow ama in kale."" (The number of native speakers varies depending on whether you count the closely related dialects or not.)  This directly links the varying estimates to the inclusion or exclusion of different Hindi dialects.
"
Kuwa soo socda kee baa weedh run ah oo ku saabsan luuqadaha Hindiga iyo Urduuga?,"The correct answer is **B: Waxay ku kala duwan yihiin qoraalka (They differ in script)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Afka Hindiga iyo Urduga ayaa ereyadooda aad isugu dhaw laakin ku kala duwan qoraalka"" (Hindi and Urdu have very similar words but differ in script).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Inta badan waxaa jira kala go'a u dhexeeya ku hadlayaasha labada luuqadood (There is usually a distinction between speakers of both languages)** - The passage says speakers *can* understand each other in everyday conversation.
* **C: Waxay ka mid yihiin ereyada iyo qoraalka labadaba (They are the same in both words and script)** - This is directly contradicted by the passage.
* **D: Way ku kala duwan yihiin ereyada (They differ in words)** - While there are differences in vocabulary, the passage emphasizes the similarity in words.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee aan xaqiiqada saxda ahayn ee ku saabsan alifbeetada Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxaa alifay Boqorkii afaraad ee Joseon Dynasty.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Boqor Sejong waa boqorkii afraad ee Boqortooyadii Joseon..."" This means Sejong was the *fourth* king, not the *last*.
* **The passage also states:** ""Alifbeetada waxa la ikhtiraacay 1444 xilligii Boqor Sejong..."" which confirms he invented it.
* **The passage explicitly says:** ""Markii hore alifbeetada Hangeul waxa uu baxshay Hunmin Jeongeum..."" which confirms the original name.
* **The passage states:** ""Hanguel waa alifbeetada keliya ee si ula kac ah loo iqtiraacay..."" which confirms it was deliberately created.

Therefore, option C is incorrect because it misidentifies King Sejong's position in the Joseon Dynasty.
"
Alifbeetada Hunmin Jeongeum aakhirkii noocee ayaa loo badalay?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states: ""Markii hore alifbeetada Hangeul waxa uu baxshay Hunmin Jeongeum..."" This means Hunmin Jeongeum is the original name, and it later evolved into Hangeul.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, luqadahee ayaa Sanskrit ay saamaysay?","The correct answer is **A: Luuqadaha Laatiinka**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sanskrit waa luuqad qadiiimi waxayna u dhigmi kartaa luuqadda Laatinka ee lagaga hadlo Yurub."" (Sanskrit is an ancient language and can be compared to the Latin language spoken in Europe.) This indicates that Sanskrit influenced Latin.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, adeegsiga luuqada Sanskrit waa uu is dhimay maxaa sababay?","The correct answer is **D: Kala sareynta (decline)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Isku-gaynta Upanishads-ka kadib, Sanskrit wuu baaba'ay darajo-saraysiinta awgeed."" This translates to ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit began to decline in prestige.""  ""Decline in prestige"" is best understood as a decline in usage and importance, or ""decline"".
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee ayaa bayaan saxa oo ku saabsan cufjiidadka Io?","The correct answer is **A: Cufjiidadka dhulku wuxuu kugu soo jiidan doonaa wax ka yar cufjiidadka Io**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that on Io, your weight would be significantly less (36 pounds for a 200-pound person) because the gravitational pull is weaker.
* This means Io's gravity is *less* than Earth's gravity.
* Therefore, Earth's gravity (which is what would be pulling on you) is stronger than Io's gravity.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cuf-jiidadka Io ayaa in ka badan soo jiidaya, waana sababta aad u miisaan yaraan lahayd:** This is incorrect because Io's gravity is *less* and would *reduce* your weight, not increase it.
* **C: Cuf-jiidadka Io ayaa in ka badan soo jiidaya, taas oo ah sababta aad u miisaan badan lahayd:** This is incorrect for the same reason as B.
* **D: Cufjiidadka dhulku wuxuu kugu soo jiidan lahaa wax ka badan cufjiidadka Io:** This is incorrect because the text states Earth's gravity is *less* than Io's gravity.

"Marka loo eego qoraalka, keebaa weedhahan soo socda si sax ah u qeexaya lakabka sare ee Dayaxa?","The correct answer is **A: Dhinaca dhow ayaa leh qolof ka sii dhumuc weyn** (The near side has a thicker crust).

Here's why:

The text states: ""lakabka Dayaxaa waxaa loo yaqaanaa qeybta adag, Dhumucda qolafta ee dhanka dhow waa ku dhawaad 70 km dhanka durugsana waa 100 km."" (The Moon's crust is the hard part, the thickness of the crust on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side it is 100 km).

This directly supports option A.  The text explicitly mentions the near side having a thinner crust (70km) compared to the far side (100km). Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they contradict the information given in the passage.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, halkee ayaa qolofta dayaxa ugu dhumuc badan tahay?","The correct answer is **A: Dhinaca dhow**.

The text states: ""Dhumucda qolafta ee dhanka dhow waa ku dhawaad 70 km dhanka durugsana waa 100 km."" This translates to ""The thickness of the shell on the near side is almost 70 km, on the far side it is 100 km."" Therefore, the shell is thickest on the near side.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebay dad gaar ah aaminsan yihiin?","The correct answer is **C: Noloshu waxay ka jirtaa meerayaasha kale**.

Here's why:

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dadku waxa ay u safreen xiddigo kale:** The passage says it's a dream for humanity, not a current reality.
* **B: Dadku ma awoodaan inay sahamiyaan adduunyo kale:** The passage discusses the possibility of future exploration.
* **D: In ka yar tirilyoono mayl ayaa u dhexeeya xiddigaha:** The passage states that stars are ""kumanaan bilyan oo mayl xidigyada waa daris"" (thousands of billions of light-years apart).



"
Maxaa sii dhumuc yaraada markasta aad ka sii durugto bartmaha qorraxda?,"The correct answer is **C: Gaaska**.

The passage states: ""Gaastu way khafiifaysa markasta oo aad bu'da qorraxda ka sii durugto."" This translates to: ""Gas becomes lighter as you move further from the sun's core."" Therefore, gas is what decreases in density as you move outwards.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, qaybtee ka mid ah qorraxda ayaa laga arki karaa dhulka?","The correct answer is **C: footosfeerka (footosphere)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Qaybta sare ee aynu aragno markaynu eegno qorraxda waxa la dhahaa footosphere, taasoo la macno ah """"kubbad ilaysa""""."" which translates to ""The upper part that we see when we look at the sun is called the photosphere, which means 'shining ball'.""
"
Midkee ka mid ah indho-indhaynta soo socota ayaa gacan ka geysatay xaqiijinta aragtida Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Marxaladaha meeraha Venus (Phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Galileo observed that Venus had phases like the moon, which could only be explained if Venus orbited the Sun, not the Earth. This observation directly supported Copernicus's heliocentric model.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gudbitaanka meeraha Venus (Motion of Venus):** While the motion of Venus was also relevant to the heliocentric model, the passage doesn't mention it as a key factor in Galileo's findings or the confirmation of Copernicus.
* **C: Isku ekaanshaha Qorraxda iyo meeraha Venus (Equality of the Sun and Venus):** This isn't a standard astronomical term related to the debate between geocentrism and heliocentrism.
* **D: Isku ekaanshaha Qorraxda iyo Dayaxa (Equality of the Sun and Earth):** This option doesn't accurately reflect the core issue. The debate was about whether the Earth or the Sun was at the center of the solar system, not about their equality.



"
Kuwa soo socda kee buu arkay Galileo Galilei 1610kii?,"The correct answer is **B: Marxaladaha meeraha Venus**.

The text states: ""Ilaa sadax kuno sano kadib, 1610, xidag barte Galileo Galilei ayaa waxa uu ku ogaaday telescope in Venus uu leeyahay wajiyo kala duwan, sida bisha oo kale."" This translates to: ""Until three thousand years later, in 1610, Galileo Galilei, using a telescope, discovered that Venus had different phases, like the moon.""  Phases are the different appearances of a planet as viewed from Earth, and these are caused by the planet reflecting different amounts of sunlight as it orbits the Sun.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, halkee ayuu webiga Amazon ka soo ururiyaa biyaha?","The correct answer is **A: Wabiyaasha ka yar-yar**

The text states: ""Wuxu biyaha ka soo uruuriyaa kumanaan webi oo yaryar."" which translates to ""It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.""
"
Abaalmarintee ayaan loo nisbayn webiga Amazon?,"The correct answer is **A: Waa webiga labaad ee ugu dheer**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Wabiga Amazon waa midka labaad ee ugu dheer uguna weyn aduunka."" (The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world.)

While it's also described as the largest by volume and the widest, the question asks for a *primary* attribution. The passage leads with its length ranking.
"

"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, waa kuwee waaxaha soo socda ee shaqaaleeya tirada ugu badan ee reer Venezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Khidmad (Service)**.

The text states: ""Saddexdi muwaddin oo Venezuela oo shaqayso labo ayaa ka shaqayso qaybta adeega..."" which translates to ""Three Venezuelan citizens working, two are working in the service sector..."" This indicates that the service sector employs the largest number of Venezuelan workers mentioned in the text.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay isku-dhafku u oggolaanaysa xiddigaha in ay sameeyaan?","The correct answer is **C: Bixinta iftiin iyo kulayl**.

The passage states directly: ""Xidigaha waxa sameyaan iftiin iyo kulayl sababtoo ah enerjiga sameysmo marka unugyada hydrogen-ka ay ku milmaan unug yada culus."" (Stars produce light and heat because energy is released when hydrogen atoms fuse with heavier atoms.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Samaysanka walxo ka culus** (The creation of heavier matter) - While fusion *creates* heavier elements, the primary product of the energy release is light and heat.
* **B: Dhisida haykal isku dhafeed** (Building a composite structure) - The passage doesn't discuss star formation or structures.
* **D: Abuuritanka atam hydrogen ah** (Creating hydrogen atoms) - Fusion is the *process* where hydrogen atoms *fuse*, not created.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ayaa abuuri kara haykal isku dhafeed ?,"The correct answer is **C: Atomyada (Atoms)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that stars produce energy through nuclear fusion, where light elements (like hydrogen) combine to form heavier elements.** This implies that atoms are the fundamental building blocks that undergo fusion.
* **Atoms are the basic units of matter and can combine in various ways to form molecules and complex structures.**  This is crucial for creating a fusion reactor.
* **Hydrogen (A) is a fuel source for fusion, but not the building block of the structure itself.**
* **Stars (B) are the *result* of fusion, not the components used to *create* the structure.**
* **Energy (D) is the *outcome* of fusion, not the component used to build the reactor.**

Therefore, the passage implies that manipulating and controlling atoms is the key to building a fusion reactor, making atoms the best answer.
"
Waa maxay samaysanka kiimiko ee biyaha?,"The correct answer is **C: Labo atam oo hydrogen ah iyo labo atam oo oksijiinta ah**.

The passage states: ""Curiyaha biyuhu wuxu ka kooban yahay laba atom oo haydarajiin ah iy mid ogsajiin ah.""  This translates to ""The element of water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom."" Therefore, the chemical formula is H₂O.
"
"Marka ay qaabka biyuhu baddelmaan, maxaa siduu ahaa sii ahaadaa?","The correct answer is **A: Qaab-dhismeedka molecular (Molecular structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""In kastoo laga yaabo in muuqaalkood jirku beddelmo, qaabkiisa kiimikaad sideeda ayuu ahaadaa."" This translates to: ""Although its physical appearance may change, its chemical composition remains the same.""  The chemical composition refers to the arrangement of atoms (the molecular structure).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Cufnaanta (Density):** The passage says the density changes (e.g., gas vs. liquid), but the *molecular structure* stays the same.
* **C: Xaalada jireed (Physical state):**  The passage mentions different physical states (gas, liquid, solid), but the core *molecular structure* doesn't change.
* **D: Nitrojiin dareeraha ah (Liquid nitrogen):** The passage uses liquid nitrogen as an *example* of a substance that changes state, but it's not the answer to what remains constant during a state change.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee baan ahayn arrinka ku saabsan saddex iyo toban ka gobol markii ay isku dayeen inay soo rogaan sharciyo cayiman?","The correct answer is **C: Wax-ka-beddelka u baahan oggolaanshaha wadajirka ah** (The need for unanimous consent for amendments).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the states were struggling to agree on laws and that the federal government had lost the power to levy taxes due to lack of a unified nation. This implies a lack of cooperation and difficulty in reaching consensus.
* Option C directly addresses the challenge of achieving unanimous consent, which would further exacerbate the difficulty in passing laws and creating a unified system.
* The other options are directly mentioned in the passage:
    * **A: Kormeero culus oo ka imaanaya maamulada gobolka** (Heavy oversight from state governments) - The passage mentions states not cooperating and hindering federal law.
    * **B: Awood la'aan ka dhex jirta Kongareeska** (Lack of power within Congress) - This is explicitly stated in the passage.
    * **D: Fulin qaran oo aan jirin** (Lack of national enforcement) - The passage mentions the difficulty in enforcing laws and the lack of a unified nation.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, weedhee baa si sax ah uga tarjumaysa xaaladdii dawladdii dhexe ee dagaalkii Kacaanka?","The correct answer is **C: Wakiilada gobolka waxaa ka maqnaa joogitaan muuqda.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...dadka matalaayay oo mar badan iska maqnaayeen."" This directly indicates a lack of consistent representation and engagement from the states in the federal government during the War of Independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Canshuuraha waxaa meelmariyay Congress ka iyo maamulka gobolka:** The passage states Congress *lost* the power to levy taxes.
* **B: Wax ka beddelka qodobbada waxay ku tiirsanaayeen awoodda Congresska:** The passage states Congress *lost* its power to amend clauses.
* **D: Dawladdii dhexe waxay ka koobnayd laba qaybood oo waaweyn:** The passage doesn't mention the structure of the federal government beyond its weakened state.



"
Sidee loo qoray erayada ku yaal dhabarka dambe ee ku dhawaaqista madax-bannaanida?,"The correct answer is **C: Kor iyo hoos (Upside down)**.

The passage states: ""Gadaasha Bayaanka Xornimada waxa ku qornaa kelmadaha “ Bayaanka Xornimada Asalka ah waxa uu ku taariikhaysan yahay 4ta Luulyo 1776”. Qoraalku waxa uu ka muuqda gunta dukumeentiga, waana maqluub."" This translates to: ""On the back of the Declaration of Independence are the words 'The original Declaration of Independence is dated July 4, 1776'. The writing appears on the back of the document, and it is upside down.""

Therefore, the words were written upside down.
"
Singapore waxa lagu yaqanaa kuwan soo socda midkee?,"The correct answer is **D: Bandhiga farshaxanka (Showcase of horticulture)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights the Singapore Botanic Gardens and the Vanda Miss Joaquim orchid being made the national flower. This strongly suggests Singapore is known for its horticultural achievements and showcases of plants and flowers. 

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Magaalada cagaarka (City of spices):** While Singapore has a history with spices, it's not the primary defining characteristic mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Socodka (Hiking):** The text doesn't mention hiking as a prominent feature.
*   **C: Ciyaaraha tamashlaha (Touring/Travel):** While Singapore is a tourist destination, the focus of the passage is on its botanical gardens.



"
Maxay tahay Vanda Marwo Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: Ubax**. 

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim is a **sun orchid hybrid**.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay tahay tayada Ahraamta Giza aysan u badnayn in ay la yaabaan Boqortooyada Cusub ee Masaarida?","The correct answer is **D: Qaab dhismeedkooda (Their construction)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ahraamta Giza waligood lagama wacnaan dhanka xajmiga iyo wacnaansha tignikaal ahaaneed kuna saabsan hab dhismeedkeeda."" This translates to ""The Giza pyramids were never admired in terms of size and technical soundness, and regarding their construction method.""

Therefore, the reason they weren't admired by the New Kingdom Egyptians was their **construction method/design**.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, halkee bay kasoo socdaalaan xoolaha daaqa iyagoo soo roob raacaya?","The correct answer is **B: Buuraha gaagaaban ee waqooyi**.

The passage states: ""...ysoo raacayo roobka. intaa kadib waxaa usoo laabneysa waqooyiga adigo maryaa galbeed, mar kaleeto waxaad ka gudbeysa wabiga Mara kadib xili roobadka Abriil meelahas."" This indicates they start in the northern hills.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, aaggee bay xoolaha daaqa ka baxaan waqti ku dhow Abriil?","The correct answer is **C: Wabiga Mara**.

The passage states: ""intaa kadib waxaa usoo laabneysa waqooyiga adigo maryaa galbeed, mar kaleeto waxaad ka gudbeysa wabiga Mara kadib xili roobadka Abriil meelahas."" This translates to ""then it returns to the north, heading west, crossing the Mara River again after the rainy season in April.""
"
Hawlgalka Sealion wuxuu ahaa duullaan lagu qaaday waddankee?,"The correct answer is **B: Ingiriiska**.

The text states: ""Jarmalku bilaabay inuu isu diyaariyo inuu weeraro jasiiradda Ingiriiska. Jarmalku weerarku wuxu kood ahaan ugu baxshay """"Hawlgalka Sealion"""". "" (Germany began to prepare to attack the island of England. Germany's attack was called ""Operation Sealion"".)

Therefore, Operation Sealion was an attack planned against **England (Ingiriiska)**.
"
Muxuu Jarmalku ku tilmaamay weerarkii Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Howlgalkii sealion**.

The passage states: ""Jarmalku weerarku wuxu kood ahaan ugu baxshay """"Hawlgalka Sealion""""."" which translates to ""The German attack was called """"Operation Sealion"""".""
"
Maxaa aan lagu xusin tallaabada lagama maarmaanka ah ee qorshaha Talyaanigu ku doonayo inuu ku qabsado dalalka Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Asaasida xarun laga diro ciidamada (Establishing bases from which troops can be deployed)**.

The passage states: ""Si ay waddamadaas u qabsadaan, waxay u baahanayeen meelo ay ciidamada ka soo kiciyaan, si ciidamadu u badmaaxi karaan badda Midhatareeniyanka oo u weerari karaan Afrika."" (In order to conquer those countries, they needed places from which troops could be deployed, so that the troops could maneuver in the Mediterranean Sea and attack Africa.) This directly supports the idea of establishing bases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka takhalusidda maraakiibta Masar dhexdeeda (Getting rid of Egyptian ships):** While the passage mentions dealing with Egyptian ships, it's not the *primary* necessary step for conquering Africa.
* **B: Dhisidda maraakiib dheeraad ah (Building more ships):** The passage states that Italy wasn't keen on building more warships.
* **D: Burburinta saldhigyadii Ingiriiska (Destroying British outposts):**  The passage mentions dealing with British outposts but not destroying them. The focus is on establishing *their own* bases.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa loo tixgeliyey inay ahayd ujeedada koowaad ee Talyaanigu dagaalka ka lahaa?","The correct answer is **A: Qabashada wadamada Afrika (Conquering African countries)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yoolasha waawayn ee Talyaanigu waxay ahaayeen waddamada Afrika."" (The main goal of Italy was the African countries.) The rest of the passage explains *why* they wanted Africa (for strategic naval bases) but the primary goal is clearly stated as conquering African territories.
"
Yaa xiriir saaxiibtinimo la sameeyay soo duulayaasha?,"The correct answer is **B: Faransiiska Vichy**.

The text states: ""Waxa ay ahaayen dad faransiis ah oo hishiis nabadeed lagalay Jarmalka sanadka markuu ahaa 1940..."" (They were French people who had a peace agreement with Germany in 1940...) This directly indicates that the Vichy government of France formed an alliance with Germany.
"
Waa kuwee Xulafadii ka qayb qaatay Hawlgalkii Dragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: Maraykanka iyo Faransiiska Xorta ah**

The passage explicitly states: ""Labo isbuuc gudahooda oo keli ciidamada Maraykanka iyo Faransiiska Xorta ayaa xoreeyey koonfurta Faransiiska...""
"
Horumarka teknooloojiyada noocee ayaa keenay in maraakiibta quusta ay bilaabaan inay ku safraan biyaha hoostooda?,"The correct answer is **D: Raadaarka (Radar)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""sida sida uu raaderku uu uso baxay una noqday mid leysku haleyn karo, gudis yada waxa ay ku qasbanaadeyn in ay biyaha hoostoda jeexan si ay uuga fogaadan in la arko."" This directly links the development of radar to the submarines needing to submerge to avoid detection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Doomaha-U (U-boats):** U-boats were the German submarines, not the technology that enabled them to submerge.
* **B: Aaga toogashada (Firing range):**  Firing range is related to how far a submarine can shoot, not how it navigates underwater.
* **C: Badmareen (Seafarer):** This is a general term for someone who travels by sea and is unrelated to the technology that allowed submarines to submerge.



"
"Markii ugu horeysay ee la isticmaalay, dhinacee ayay maraakiibta quusta aad uga xaddidnaayeen?","The correct answer is **C: Toogashada**.

The passage states: ""Berigaas aad bay u gaabin jireen tiirada toogashadooduna way xaddidnayd."" This directly translates to ""At that time, their firing range was very limited.""
"
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, yaa jabiyay heshiis? ","The correct answer is **D: Soofiyetka (Soviet)**.

The passage states: ""...800,000 troops of the Red Army/Guard were entering and making breakthroughs in the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts..."" This indicates the Soviet forces were the ones who broke the defenses.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aysan fulin Ciidanka Cas?,"The correct answer is **C: Dib u habayn ku saabsan buundada (Re-adjustment regarding the bridge)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** The Soviet Red Army *did* invade and occupy eastern Poland, creating unrest after the signing of treaties like the Riga Peace Treaty and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact. It also mentions they broke the agreement.
* **The options:**
    * **A: Abuuritaanka jabhad Yukreeniyaan ah (Creating a Ukrainian Front):** The text implies the Soviets *did* create a Ukrainian front, as they operated in Ukrainian territories.
    * **B: Duulaan lagu soo qaaday gobolada bari (Invasion of Eastern Territories):** The text explicitly states the Red Army invaded and occupied eastern Poland.
    * **C: Dib u habayn ku saabsan buundada (Re-adjustment regarding the bridge):**  The text **does not mention** any re-adjustment regarding a bridge.  It focuses on the overall invasion and occupation.
    * **D: Jebin heshiis (Breaking the Treaty):** The text states the Soviets broke treaties, specifically the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact.

Therefore, the only action the Red Army *didn't* take, according to the provided text, is re-adjusting regarding a bridge.
"
Maxaa ku dhacay Injineerkii Guud ee Ciidanka Tobanaad ee Talyaaniga?,"The correct answer is **D: Waxaa lagu dilay rasaas saaxiibtinimo**.

The passage states: ""28 kii Juun, Maarshaal Italo Balbo, oo ahaa Gudooymiyihii Guud ee Liibiya iyo dhaxal-sugihii Mussolin, waxa dilay xabbad saaxiibtinimo mar uu ku soo degayay Tobruk."" This directly indicates that General Lastucci was killed by friendly fire.
"
Xagee baa lagu dilay Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""28 kii Juun, Maarshaal Italo Balbo, oo ahaa Gudooymiyihii Guud ee Liibiya iyo dhaxal-sugihii Mussolin, waxa dilay xabbad saaxiibtiinimo mar uu ku soo degayay **Tobruk**.""
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, midkee farsamooyinka soo socda ayaa ah qayb muhiim ah oo ka mid ah fikirka yogada Tibetan?","The correct answer is **B: Ku celcelinta odhaah da mantras**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions: ""Marka la sameeyo Kundalini Yoga, xooga Kundalini loo yaqaano (xooga iftiiminta) ayaa lagu kiciyaa qaab istaaga, **jimicsiga neefsashada, ereyo lagu celceliyo, iyo waxyaabo la sawirto.**""  These ""ereyo lagu celceliyo"" are mantras.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ku celcelinta jimicsiga neefsiga:** While breathing exercises are part of Kundalini Yoga, the text doesn't describe *repeating* them as a core practice.
* **C: Sawirashada khiyaliga ah ee ilaahyada:**  This is related to Deity Yoga, which is mentioned, but not as a fundamental practice in Tibetan Buddhism *as described in the text*. The text focuses more on the general purification and activation of energy channels.
* **D: Barashada qaababka yogada:** The text mentions Kundalini Yoga, but it doesn't broadly refer to ""learning yoga postures"" as a core element. It details *how* Kundalini Yoga is practiced, not the general concept of learning postures.



"
"""Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sidee samaynta chakras loo hawlgeliyay inta lagu jiro """"xarunta"""" yogada ee Tibetan?""","The correct answer is **A: Iyada oo loo marayo qaababka yogada ee kala duwan**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Kundalini Yoga, a key element of Tibetan Buddhism's practice, involves using postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization to awaken the Kundalini energy (the ""spark of illumination"").  This directly relates to working with chakras.
* Option B (visualizing deities) is related to Deity Yoga, which is a part of Tibetan Buddhist practice, but not the primary method for working with chakras in the context of the question.
* Option C (repeating mantras) is a component of Kundalini Yoga but not the *sole* method for working with chakras.
* Option D (repeating breathing exercises) is also a component, but the text emphasizes the *combination* of different yoga practices to affect energy flow.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that chakras are worked with through the various yoga *practices* employed in Tibetan Buddhism.
"
yaa soo bandhigay heestii cibaadada ee labaad intii uu socday barnaamijku?,"The correct answer is **B: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Ka dib, Lakkha Singh wuxuu qaatay hogaaminta heesta bhajan. Lakkha Singh waxay soo bandhigtay sidoo chhappan bhog bhajan."" This means Lakkha Singh performed the second bhajan after Sanju Sharma and Jai Shankar Choudhary.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yaa soo bandhigay hees cibaado ah inta la bixinayay cuntada?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Ka dib, Lakkha Singh wuxuu qaatay hogaaminta heesta bhajan."" (After that, Lakkha Singh took the lead in the bhajan.) and ""Lakkha Singh waxay soo bandhigtay sidoo chhappan bhog bhajan."" (Lakkha Singh presented the chhappan bhog bhajan). This indicates that Lakkha Singh performed the devotional song while the food was being offered.
"
Maxay ahayd bandhiggii labaad ee ugu dambeeyay cawayskii?,"The correct answer is **D: Fatih Erkoç iyo Müslüm Gürses**.

The passage states: ""Waxaa xigay Koox-heesaadka Simfoniga Gobolka Istanbul (Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra), baandeyda Janissari (a Janissary band), iyo heesaayaasha Fatih Erkoç **iyo Müslüm Gürses**."" which translates to ""Followed by the Istanbul State Symphony Orchestra, the Janissary band, and the singers Fatih Erkoç **and Müslüm Gürses**.""

Therefore, Fatih Erkoç and Müslüm Gürses were the second performance listed.
"
Dhalashada Alessandro Safina waa maxay?,"The correct answer is **D: Talyaani (Italian)**.

The text states that Alessandro Safina is an Italian artist (""fanaanka Talyaaniga Alessandro Safina"").
"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, weedhahan soo socda kee baa aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **D: Waxay qaadatay ugu yaraan 60 daqiiqo in qofka ugu horreeya laga soo saaro baabuurka (It took at least 60 minutes to get the first person out of the vehicle).**

Here's why:

* The text states it took ""at least an hour"" (hal saac) to get the first person out. 60 minutes is equal to one hour. 

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

* **A: Dab ayaa ka kacay Santa Kalara (A fire broke out in Santa Clara):** The text says ""Rakaabka waxa la saiiyay biyo intay kulka 90(f) digrii ah wax ku sugayeen"" (Passengers were given water while waiting in 90(f) degree heat). This strongly implies a fire or heat-related emergency.
* **B: Dadku waxay ahaayeen kuwo ku dhegen roollo koostar (People were stuck in roller coasters):** The text explicitly states ""markay ugu yartahay, waxaanay ku qaadatay ugu yartaa hal saac in qofkii u horeeyay la soo rogo"" (at the very least, it took at least an hour to get the first person out).  This means they were trapped *in* the roller coasters.
* **C: Rakaabkii waxaa la siiyay biyo (Passengers were given water):** The text says ""Rakaabka waxa la saiiyay biyo"" (Passengers were given water).

Therefore, only option D is factually incorrect according to the text.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yaa faallo ka bixiyay heerka kulaylka aan raaxada lahayn?","The correct answer is **B: Kabtanka dab damiska**.

The text states: ""Kabtanka dabdamiska, Skot Kouns, wuxu yidhi “Santa Clara maalintu way kululayd heerkulkuna waxa uu ahaa 90meeyo..."" (The Fire Chief, Scott Kouns, said ""Santa Clara was a hot day and the temperature was 90 degrees..."")

Therefore, Scott Kouns, the Fire Chief, made the statement about the heat and the discomfort.
"
Halkee ka dhacday koronto la’aan ka dhalatay dhaq-dhaqaaqa sunaami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""Wax dhaawacyo ama burbur wayn ah laguma sheegay Tonga, balse korontada ayaa si ku meel gaar ah u tagtay, taasoo sida la sheegay maamulka Tongan u diiday inay helaan digniinta suunaamida ay soo saareen PTWC."" This translates to ""No major injuries or damage were reported in Tonga, but power outages occurred specifically, which the Tongan administration reportedly refused to receive the tsunami warning issued by PTWC.""
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sidee Tonga u saamaysay koronto la’aantu?","The correct answer is **D: Maamulka ayaa awoodi waayay inay helaan digniino la xiriira.**

The passage states: ""Wax koronto ah ayaa si ku meel gaar ah u tagtay, taasoo sida la sheegay maamulka Tongan u diiday inay helaan digniinta suunaamida ay soo saareen PTWC."" This means the power outage was related to the fact that the Tongan authorities refused to receive the tsunami warning.
"
Goorma ayay booliisku awood u yeesheen inay adeegsadaan qoryahoodii raadaarka si ay u cabiraan xawaaraha Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: Markuu ku socday xawaare dhan 160 km/saacad**.

The text states: ""...Booliska New Zealand waxa ay dhib ku qabeyn isticmaalka qoryaha raaderka xawaare marka la fiiriyo xawaaraha uu mudane Reid ku socday sababto ah sida ay u gaabiyan Black Beauty, marka ay booliska fursad uheleyn waxa ay aheyd marka mudane Reid uu gaabiye ilaa 160km/sacadi."" This indicates the radar was only used when he was traveling at 160 km/h.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay ugu adkeyd booliska New Zealand inay saacada xawaaraha Jonny Reid cabiraan?","The correct answer is **A: Waxa uu ku socday xawaare ka yar 160km/saacad**.

The text states that police didn't issue a ticket because the car, the Black Beauty, was so fast it only reached 160km/h briefly, and police only had a chance to measure the speed when he slowed down to 160km/h. Therefore, the key point is that he was *at* 160km/h at times, but the police didn't have sustained evidence of exceeding it.
"
Halkee ayuu dhulgariirku xuddun u ahaa marka lo eego Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 mayl koonfur**.

The text states the earthquake was 65 km (40 miles) *south* of Butte."
Maxaa dhacay intii lagu guda jiray rabshadahii Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **D: Xabsiga ayaa dab la qabadsiiyay**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""Xabsiga Abu Gharib ee Ciraaq ayaa dab la qabadsiiyay intii rabshaduhu socday."" (The Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq caught fire while the riots were taking place.)

While options A, B, and C may have been related to the Abu Ghraib situation, the question specifically asks what *happened* during the riots, and the text directly answers that the prison caught fire.
"
Waa maxay sababta xabsiga Ciraaq uu sumcad u yeeshay? ,"The correct answer is **D: Helitaanka xadgudubka maxaabiista (The discovery of prisoner abuse)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Abu Ghraib prison became infamous *because* of the discovery of prisoner abuse. The fire was an incident *during* the unrest, not the cause of the prison's bad reputation.
* While the other options might be related to the situation, they don't explain *why* the prison gained a notorious reputation. The abuse is the core reason.



"
Dhacdo noocee ah ayaa ahayd in lagu qabto garoonka Xusuusta Dagaalka Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: Show heeso (Concert)**.

The text states the band was supposed to perform at the Maui War Memorial Stadium, and that up to 9,000 people were expected to attend. This strongly indicates a musical concert.
"
Yaa ugu dambeyntii bixiyay sharraxaad ku saabsan joojinta munaasabadda?,"The correct answer is **B: Shirkadda maamulka**.

The text states: ""Shirkada maareysa kooxda, HK Management Inc., ma aysan sheegin wax sabab hore ah marka ay baajiyen 20 Sibteembar, laakin maalinti xigtay ayee sheegen eeda ine tahay sababo diyaar garow xumo ine aheyd."" This directly indicates that HK Management Inc. (the management company) provided the explanation.
"
Kumay u maleeyeen qaar badan oo ka mid ah dadka deggan Bishkek in ay mas'uul ka ahaayeen bililiqada?,"The correct answer is **C: Mudaaharaadayaasha (Protesters)**.

The text explicitly states that some residents of Bishkek are accusing protesters from the southern part of the country of being responsible for the unrest."
Yaa ku eedeeyay mudaharaadayaasha koonfurta ka soo jeeda inay ka dambeeyaan bililiqada?,"The correct answer is **A: Dadka degan Bishkek**.

The text states: ""Kamida deeganka Bishkek ayaa eedeynaya mudaharaadlayaasah ka yimid koonfurta shari la'aanta ka jirto."" (Some residents of Bishkek are accusing protesters from the south of lawlessness.)
"
Goorma ayay tijaabada dhawaqa Ring kordhisay iibka?,"The correct answer is **A: Kadib markay kasoo dul muuqatay Shark Tank**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Simioff wuxu yidhi iibka waxa kor u qaaday ka soo muuqashadiisii uu ka muuqday Shark Tank 2013kii..."" (Siminoff said sales increased after his appearance on Shark Tank 2013...)
"
Goorma ayuu Jamie Siminoff go'aansaday inuu bilaabo tijaabada dhawaqa Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka dib markii uu ogaaday in gambaleelka albaabkiisu aanu ku filnayn.**

The passage states: ""Wuxuu calamadiyey shirkadu iney bilaabmatay marka uu qambaleelka/jaraska albaabkiisu codkiisu aan laga maqli Karin dukaan kiisa garaashka ku dhexyaalay."" (He indicated the company started when the sound on his doorbell/knocker couldn't be heard in his garage.) This directly precedes the statement about him creating the WiFi doorbell.
"
Xalqad kasta oo kamida taxanaha Akhriska Qaansoroobaadka waxay ciyaalka usoo bandhigtay talooyin maxay ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Maktabadaha maxalliga ah**.

The text states: ""Bandhig walbo sidoo kale talo bixin dono caruurta buugaga ay ka raadsan doonaan maktabada markay tagaan."" (Every show will also give advice to children on the books they will look for in the library when they go.)
"
Maxaa laga yaabaa in ay gacan ka geysteen joojinta taxanaha Akhriska Qaansoroobaadka?,"The best answer is **A: Maalgelin aan ku filneyn** (Insufficient funding).

Here's why:

* **The text implies a change in educational philosophy contributed to the show's success.** It mentions ""go’aanka maalgelineed iyo isbeddelka falsafadeed ee waxbarashada talafeeshinku"" (funding decisions and a philosophical shift in television education).  This suggests that adequate funding was *necessary* for the show's success. A lack of funding would likely be a key factor in its discontinuation.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: La'aanta abaal-marinnada Emmy** (Lack of Emmy Awards): The show *has* won multiple Emmy Awards (two).  This is evidence of success, not a reason for cancellation.
* **C: Fikirka John Grant** (John Grant's idea): John Grant's statement is *positive* about the show's impact. It's not a reason for cancellation.
* **D: Guusha Xaafadda Mister Rogers** (The success of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood): While both shows aim to educate children, the text doesn't directly link the success of one to the cancellation of the other.  It's a less direct connection.

Therefore, insufficient funding is the most logical explanation given the information provided.

Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ahayn dood ay sameeyeen saraakiisha Amsterdam iyo matxafka ee ku saabsan geedka?,"The correct answer is **B: Waa in la dhowraa (It should be pruned)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states the tree had a fungus causing a health risk and was a falling hazard.** This supports options C and D.
* **The text clearly says they *intended* to cut it down.** This supports option A (""Waa lama huraan in ay dumin doonto - It was necessary to cut it down"").
* **The text explicitly mentions the fungus.** This supports option C (""Waxay ku wasakhowday fangas - It was infected with fungus"").
* **The text does *not* say they recommended pruning.** In fact, the urgency of the legal order suggests the problem was more severe than simple pruning could fix.



"
"Marka loo eego Kormeeraha Sare ee RSPCA, howlgalada kormeeridu waa inay noqdaan heerka midkee kamid ah kuwan soo socda?","The correct answer is **A: kamaradaha Ammaanka (CCTV)**.

The text explicitly states: """"CCTV-da waxa ay fariin culus u direysa dadka ka shaqeeyo xayawaanada in bad qabkoodu yahay muhiimada koowaad."""" This translates to: """"CCTV sends a strong message to people working with animals that animal welfare is the top priority.""""

Therefore, the answer is CCTV cameras.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa gacan ka geysan kara in la aasaaso muhiimada ay leedahay u dhimrinta xoolaha ee shaqaalaha kawaanka Australia?","The correct answer is **A: Ku rakibida Kamaradaha Ammaanka (Installing CCTV cameras)**.

The text explicitly states that RSPCA is lobbying for mandatory CCTV installation in all abattoirs and that this will send a ""strong message"" that animal welfare is the top priority. This directly links the installation of cameras to emphasizing the importance of humane treatment.

While the other options might contribute to animal welfare in general, the text specifically highlights CCTV as the proposed solution to emphasize the importance of humane treatment for abattoir workers.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, waa maxay shaqada qofka la xidhay?","The correct answer is **A: Arday (Student)**.

The text states: ""markii jeff iyo sadex kale oo dhibanayaan ahi sheegeen in ardey kale lagu xidhay..."" which translates to ""when Jeff and three others who were victims said that another student was detained...""
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, iyada oo wararka faafay sheegayan in la qabtay qof kale, ayadoo janaasooyin loo sameenayay imisa dhibanayaal ah?","The correct answer is **B: Sadex**.

The text states: ""markii jeff iyo sadex kale oo dhibanayaan ahi sheegeen..."" which translates to ""when Jeff and three others who were victims said..."" This indicates three people were initially reported as victims. The question asks about the number of victims for whom funerals were held. The text doesn't state that any funerals have been held, but it *does* mention three people were initially identified as victims."
"Iyadoo laga jawaab celinayo mudaaharaadyada, waddankee ayaan horay ugu socon heshiiskii ACTA ee ay saxiixeen?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bishii la soo dhaafay, muddaharaado waawayn ayaa ka dhacay Poland markii waddankaasi saxeexay ACTA..."" (Last month, large demonstrations took place in Poland when the country signed ACTA...).
"
"Sida ku cad qoraalka, wadamada soo socda kee baa go'aansaday inuu dib u dhigo habka ku biirista ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Laatfiya**.

The text explicitly states: ""Latvia iyo Slovakia waxay labadooduba dib u dhigeen ku biiristooda ACTA."" (Latvia and Slovakia both postponed their accession to ACTA.)

While Lithuania, Estonia, Scotland, and Latvia held demonstrations, only Latvia and Slovakia are mentioned as having postponed their accession to ACTA.
"
Immisa qof ayaa ku dhaawacmay shilalka kulaylka xad dhaafka ah ee qalabka iPod ka?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...lix dab oo kacay afar qofna gubitaan fudud baa haleelay."" ( ...six fires broke out and four people suffered minor burns.)
"
Yaa sheegay in shilalka kulaylku aanay ahayn kuwo aad u daran?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""METI ayaa ku dhawaaqday in Apple ay ogeysiyeen dhacdooyin kuleel xad dhaaf ah, ay shirkadda ku tilmaantay “kuwa aan muhiim ahayn.”"" (METI announced that Apple had been notified of overheating incidents, which the company described as ""not significant."")
"
Muxuu Steve Jobs sheegay markuu hadalka soo jeedinayay in Apple ay dib u curin doonto?,"The correct answer is **B: Taleefanka**.

Steve Jobs clearly stated, ""Maanta Apple waxay rabtaa inay dib u ikhtiraacdo **telefoonka**..."" He wasn't talking about the company, technology in general, or history; he was specifically focused on reinventing the telephone.
"
Maxay ahayd ujeedada Steve Jobs khudbadii labada saacadood ahayd?,"The correct answer is **C: Si loo soo saaro taleefan cusub**.

The text explicitly states that Steve Jobs unveiled a device (the iPhone) and declared that Apple was reinventing the phone. This directly indicates the purpose of the speech was to announce a new phone.
"
Maxay bay Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kaga dhawaaqday Tiyaatarka Arjantiin?,"The correct answer is **A: Musharaxnimadeeda madaxweyne (Her candidacy for president)**.

The text clearly states: ""Mrs. Kirchner announced she would run for president...""
"
Halkee bay Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kaga dhawaaqday rabitaankeeda inay tartanto?,"The correct answer is **B: Tiyaatarka Buenos Aires ee La Plata**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...La Plata, magaalada 50 kilometers (31 miles) u jirta Buenos Aires."" This means La Plata is near Buenos Aires.
* It also says she announced her candidacy at ""Tiyaatarma Argentina..."" which is likely a reference to a theater in La Plata, given its proximity to Buenos Aires.
* Option B is the closest and most logical interpretation of the provided text.



"
Maxay ahaayeen natiijooyinka ACMA ee ku saabsan Walaalka Wayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Sharciyada faafreebka laguma xadgudbin** (Broadcasting laws were not violated).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) determined Big Brother did *not* violate broadcasting laws because the content wasn't stored on their website.
* The reason for this determination is that internet transmissions are considered to have implicit consent, as they pass through the internet infrastructure.
* Options B, C, and D are all contradicted by the information provided in the text.
"
Waa maxay xuduudaha ay tahay in warbaahintu ay hoos gasho si loogu tixgeliyo inay tahay xog intarneet?,"The correct answer is **C: Laguma kaydin karo degelka internetka ah** (It cannot be stored on the internet).

Here's why:

The provided text states that the ACMA determined Big Brother didn't violate broadcasting laws *because* the data wasn't stored on the Big Brother website. The text explicitly links the definition of ""internet"" in the legislation to data *passing through* a network, not being permanently stored.  Therefore, the key constraint is that the information should not be permanently stored online to be considered ""internet data"" under this interpretation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waa in lagu sii daayo internetka** (It must be transmitted over the internet) - While transmission is part of it, it's not the defining factor.  The data could be transmitted and then immediately deleted.
* **B: Waa in ay si dhab ah ugu jirtaa server-ka** (It must truly exist on a server) -  The text implies the opposite. The lack of storage on the website was crucial.
* **D: Waa in laga ogolaado dhanka ACMA** (It must be approved by the ACMA) - While ACMA's opinion is relevant here, it doesn't define the *technical* limitations of what constitutes ""internet data.""  The ability to be stored or not stored is the defining factor.



"
Waa kuma hogaamiyaha xisbiga Liberal ka ee Australia?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The passage states: ""Peter Costello... ayaa taageero siiyay warshad quwadda nukliyeerka ee Australia...ninka logu malaynaayo inuu kala wareegi doono Raysal Wasaaraha John Howard xilka hogaamiyaha xisbiga Liberal..."" This clearly indicates that Peter Costello is the leader of the Liberal party (or is expected to be).
"
Waa maxay sababta Australiya aysan u lahayn warshad tamarta nukliyeerka ah?,"The text doesn't explicitly state *why* Australia doesn't have a nuclear power industry. However, Peter Costello's statement about advocating for its development implies that it *doesn't* exist currently.

The options don't directly address *why* it doesn't exist, but they address potential reasons *against* it. Costello's words suggest he believes it *could* be successful if pursued.

Therefore, the best inferred answer, even though it's not directly stated, is that the lack of a nuclear power industry in Australia is likely due to **B: Muran badan ka taagan yahay (Significant debate)**.  If it were easy and universally supported, Costello wouldn't need to advocate for it. The fact that he's making a strong statement suggests there are existing concerns or disagreements.

While C (Aad khatar u ah - Very dangerous) and D (Aad u qaali ah - Very expensive) could be reasons *why* a country might *not* have nuclear power, the text doesn't directly mention danger or cost. Option A (Taageero la'aan dadwayne - Lack of public support) is possible but the text focuses on Costello's advocacy, implying the support isn't entirely absent.

**Therefore, B is the most logical inference based on the provided text.**



"
Waa kee iskeerka tartamay isagoo kaashanaya hage?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Ragga aragga naafada ka ah ee Poland ee skier Maciej Krezel iyo hagaha Anna Ogarzynska waxay ku dhamaysteen booska saddex iyo tobnaad ee tartarka Baraf ku sibqidda (Super-G)."" This indicates Maciej Krezel is the skier who competed with a guide (Anna Ogarzynska).
"
Wadankee ku dhameystay kaalinta tobnaad ee Super-G ee heerka haweenka?,"The correct answer is **B: Holondiis**.

The text states: ""Netherlands, Anna Jochemsen oo ku dhameysatay numberka sagaalad ee tartanka kaluumeysiga Super-G..."" which translates to ""Netherlands, Anna Jochemsen finished in ninth place in the Super-G ski race...""  While the question asks about the women's Super-G, Anna Jochemsen is mentioned as representing the Netherlands.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, weedhee ku saabsan Blake ee aan sax ahayn?","The correct answer is **B: Wuu qirtay weerarka** (He admitted to the attack).

Here's why:

The text states that Blake **denied** attacking anyone and claimed he used the tiir (post/pillar) to defend himself from being pelted with things. Therefore, saying he admitted to the attack is the opposite of what the text says.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isla goobtii dhacdada ayaa lagu xiray (The same location where the incident occurred was closed)** - The text states the location was closed *after* the presentation. This is accurate.
*   **C: Inta uu weerarka socday waxa uu adeegsaday tiir (During the attack, he used a tiir)** - The text states he *claimed* to have used the tiir for self-defense.
*   **D: Wuxuu ku andacoodey in dhalooyinka asaga lagu soo tuuray (He claimed that the things were thrown at him)** - The text explicitly states that Blake *claimed* he used the tiir to defend himself from being pelted with things. So, he *denied* the attack.



"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, midkee kuwan soo socda aan ku dhicin Blake?","The correct answer is **C: Waxa lagu soo weeraray tiir (He was attacked with a tiir)**.

Here's why:

* The text states Blake ""diided that he was attacked with objects thrown at approximately fifty people."" (diiday inuu weerartamay waxa uuna ku andacoode in uu usha u isticmaalaye in uu iskaga difaaco dhalooyinka ay kusoo tuuray dad gaaraya sodon qof.) This directly contradicts option C.

* The text explicitly states he was found guilty of ""attempting to obstruct justice."" (Blake waxaa sidoo kale lagu cadeeye inuu isku dayay dhinac u weecin cadaalada ah.) This confirms option A.

* The text implies he will likely go to jail: ""The judge told Blake he was “virtually impossible” to let off."" This suggests he'll be sentenced to prison, supporting option D.

* The text mentions he was arrested (""He was arrested at the Court of Appeal in Birmingham""). This confirms option B.



Therefore, only option C is something the text *denies* happened to Blake.



"
Maxaa lacagaha kulaylka caalamiga ee Qaramada Midoobay aan loo isticmaali doonin?,"The correct answer is **C: Guryaha daadka celin kara (Flood-resistant homes)**.

The passage explicitly states that the money will be used for ""guriyaha u adkaysta fatahaada"" which translates to ""flood-resistant homes."" Option C directly reflects this. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Kala duwanaansiinta dalagyada (Diverting funds to countries with differing priorities)** - The passage doesn't mention this.
*   **B: Keenista tignoolajiyada wadamada soo koraya (Importing technology from developed nations)** - While technology is mentioned, the focus is on helping countries *develop* their own technologies.
*   **D: Yaraynta saamaynta kulaylka caalamiga ah (Reducing the impact of climate change)** - This is a general goal, but the passage specifies how the money will be *used* to address the impact - building resilient infrastructure.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay UN-tu rajaynaysaa inay badbaadsato?","The correct answer is **C: Kaymaha roobka ee haray**.

The passage states: ""Mawduucyada kale ee Bali ajandaha ugu jiray waxa ka mid ah in la badbaadiyo kaymaha adduunka ee haray..."" which translates to ""Other topics on the Bali agenda included saving the world's standing forests...""
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda buusan sheegin Albert Muchanga inuu yahay wax weli u baahan in lagu heshiiyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Xeerarka asalka ah (Rules of Origin)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""weli kumaanu heshiin shuruucda tacriifadaha, balse seeska aanu dhignay wuxu ku filan yahay inaynu ganacsi bilawno Luulyo 1, 2020"" which translates to ""we haven't agreed on the tariff rules, but the groundwork we've laid is enough for us to start trading July 1, 2020"". 
* **Rules of Origin** are a key component of tariff rules within trade agreements.  The statement about tariff rules implies that the rules of origin are still under discussion and haven't been finalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Haddii Benin ay ku biiri lahayd AfCTA (If Benin had joined AfCFTA):**  The text directly mentions Benin joining AfCFTA.
* **B: Taariikhda uu ganacsigu bilaaban karo (The date when trade can start):** The text clearly states that trade is planned to begin on July 1, 2020.
* **D: Ka dhaafidda canshurta taraafikada (Exemption from customs duties):** While not explicitly stated, the mention of ""tariff rules"" implies that exemptions from customs duties are part of the agreement and a key discussion point.



Therefore, the only option that Albert Muchanga *didn't* mention as still needing agreement is **Rules of Origin**.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa ganacsigu u bilaabman karaa Luulyo?","The correct answer is **B: Waxaa jira qaab ku filan oo xeerar iyo tanaasulaad ah oo meesha yaala.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""welil kumaanu heshiin shuruucda tacriifadaha, balse seeska aanu dhignay wuxu ku filan yahay inaynu ganacsi bilawno Luulyo 1, 2020.""  This means they haven't finalized the tariff regulations, *but* the groundwork (seeding) is sufficient to start trade.  This implies there are existing frameworks, laws, and agreements in place.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taariikhda bilawga Luulyo waxay ahayd qayb ka mid ah shuruudaha Nigeria ee ku biirista AfCFTA** - While Nigeria *intended* to join, the passage doesn't say July 1st was a condition for joining.
* **C: Waxaa saxay guddoomiyaha ganacsiga iyo warshadaha Midowga Afrika** - The passage reports what the *guddoomiyaha* said, but doesn't state that *he* is correct.  It just reports his statement.
* **D: Xeerarka asalka ah iyo tanaasulaad canshuureed ka waa la isku raacay** - The passage explicitly says they *haven't* agreed on tariff regulations (""shuruucda tacriifadaha"").



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay Joornaalka-Dastuurka ee Atlanta ku eedeeysay masuulinta waxbarashada?","The correct answer is **C: Aan la tacaalin dhibaatooyinka gudaha ee la ogaaday.**

The passage states: ""Warbixintu waxay sheegtay in dhibcaha imtixaanku aad u kordheen, wuxuna ku eedeeyay dugsiga inuu mashaakiil gudaha ah dareemay balse aanu waxba ka qaban."" This directly translates to the newspaper accusing the school administration of not addressing internal problems that were known.
"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo xogta lagu xusay qoraalka, maxaa aan lagu xusin warbixinta Joornaalka-Dastuurka ee Atlanta?","The correct answer is **B: Caddeymo muujinaya in waraaqihii tijaabada la fara geliyey.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on ""a problem with the test scores...and accused the school of having internal problems but not addressing them."" 
* The passage *further* mentions that ""subsequent evidence showed that test papers were switched."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Horumar aan caadi ahayn oo natiijada imtixaanka** - While the test scores *did* increase significantly, the article wasn't simply about that increase. It was about *how* the scores were achieved.
* **C: Ku guuleystaha Kormeeraha Guud ee Qaranka ee 2013** - The passage mentions Atlanta's success in winning the National Superintendent of the Year award, but the article in the newspaper doesn't focus on that.
* **D: Talooyin ku saabsan hindisida waxbarashada magaalada** - The article isn't offering advice; it's reporting on a scandal.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa xog ah oo la og yahay ka dib qaraxii?","The correct answer is **A: Tirada dhaawaca ee kama dambeystaa (The final number of injuries)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""tirada ugu danbeyse ilaa hadda lama oga"" which translates to ""the final number is not yet known.""  This directly indicates that the final number of injuries is unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dhismayaashe bay bambooyinku ku ag qarxeen (Where the bombs exploded):** The text mentions the explosion occurred outside the Attorney General's office and within government buildings, but doesn't specify the exact locations.
* **C: Haddii bambooyin dheeraad ah la qarxin lahaa (Whether more bombs were planted):** The text doesn't provide any information about whether additional bombs were planted.
* **D: Tirada rasmiga ah ee dhimashada (The official number of deaths):** The text states that ""la xaqiijiye tiro dhimasho sideeda"" (the number of deaths has been confirmed at eight), but it also mentions that the final number is unknown. So, while the confirmed number is *known*, the final number isn't.

Therefore, the only piece of information explicitly stated as *unknown* is the final number of injuries.
"
"Tan iyo markii uu ku soo biiray Manchester City 2017, immisa kulan ayuu ciyaaray jesus?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""Baraasiiligu wuxu ka qayb qaatay 53 ciyaarood oo tartamada oo dhan ah..."" which translates to ""The Brazilian has played 53 matches in all competitions...""
"
Kooxdee ayuu Jesus ku helay lacag dhan £27 milyan oo gini si uu ugu biiro?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text states: ""...ugaga yimu kooxda Reer Baraasiil ee Palmeiras qiime lagu sheegay £27 milyan."" (meaning ""...was given by the Brazilian club Palmeiras a fee of £27 million."")
"
Weedhee ku saabsan martida hostel-ka oo aan run ahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Martidu waxay u joogeen Maka si ay u soo gutaan waajibaadka xajka (The guests were in Mecca to perform the obligation of Hajj).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Dhismaha waxa uu hooy u ahaa tiro dad soo xaj tagay oo u yimid in ay soo booqdan magaalada barakeysan bilawga xajka barakeysan.""  This translates to: ""The building became the home to a large number of people who came to perform the blessed Hajj at the beginning of the blessed Hajj.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Martida qaar ma ahayn muwaadiniin deegaanka ah (Some guests were not local citizens):** The passage specifically says the guests were citizens of the UAE.
* **C: Martidu waxay halkaas ku sugnaayeen habeenka xajka hortiis (The guests were staying there the night before Hajj):** The passage doesn't mention anything about staying the night before Hajj. It focuses on their arrival for the start of Hajj.
* **D: Martida badankeeda waxay ka yimideen magaalada barakeysan (The majority of the guests came from the blessed city):** The passage states they were *from* the UAE, not necessarily that they came *from* Mecca itself. While Mecca is the blessed city, the UAE is a separate country.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, weedhahan soo socda keebaa run ah?","The correct answer is **C: Martidu waxay halkaas ku sugnaayeen habeenka xajka hortiis.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Albeerko ayaa ku duntay Makka, magaalada barakaysan ee Islaamka abbaaro 10 kii subaxnimo ee saacadda maxalliga. Dhismaha waxa uu hooy u ahaa tiro dad soo xaj tagay oo u yimid in ay soo booqdan magaalada barakeysan bilawga xajka barakeysan. **Martidabadankeedu waxay ahyeenmuwaadiniin u dhashay Imaaraadka.**""  This indicates the pilgrims were staying in the building *before* the start of the Hajj.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ma jirin wax dhimasho ah:** The text explicitly states there were 15 deaths, with the possibility of more.
* **B: Dhamaan martida ka soo qayb gashay ayaa ka kala socday dalka isutaga imaaraadka carabta:** The text says the pilgrims were from the UAE, not necessarily *all* the attendees.
* **D: Inta badan martida waxay ahaayeen reer Mekka:** The text says the pilgrims were from the UAE, indicating they were *not* from Mecca.



"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, waa maxay macluumaadka aan la xaqiijin ee ku saabsan isku-dhaca?","The correct answer is **C: Saamaynta isku dhaca ugaystay Dhulka**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that scientists are ""still trying to verify the magnitude of the impact and how it affected the world."" This indicates that the extent of the impact is not yet definitively known.
* The passage *does* state the impact was significant (""aad buu u waynaa""), but the exact *magnitude* of the impact is still being investigated.
* The passage *does* state the location of the impact (491 miles from a certain point).
* The passage *does* state that the location of the crash is being followed by the US Office of Strategic Planning.

Therefore, the only piece of information that is explicitly stated as *not yet verified* is the extent of the impact on the Earth.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa weli u baahan in la go'aamiyo oo ku saabsan isku dhaca?","The best answer is **D: Qiyaasta saxda ah ee shilka (The exact size of the impact).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Saynsiyahanadu way wali isu dayeyaan inay xaqiijiyaan wayninka isu dhaca..."" This indicates they are still trying to determine the *size* or extent of the impact.
* The text also mentions the "" qarax"" (explosion) associated with the impact, further suggesting the size is still being investigated.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Yaa daba gali doona burburka (What will follow the crash):** The text focuses on the impact itself, not what happens afterward.
* **B: Sida xawliga ah ee dayax gacmeedyadu u socdeen wakhtiga isku dhaca uu dhacayay (How the comet's trajectory was at the time of the crash):** While the trajectory is relevant, the text highlights the *size* of the impact as the key unknown.
* **C: Sida natiijooyinka falanqaynta sirta ah loo wadaagi doono (How the analysis results will be shared):** The sharing of results is mentioned, but it's not the core unknown about the *impact* itself.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate reflection of what still needs to be determined based on the provided text.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, booskee ayuu mar kaga jiray Batten dadka Maraykanka ugu qanisan?","The correct answer is **C: 190aad**.

The passage states: ""Batten waxa la geliyay kaalinta 190aad ee 400 ee qof ee Ameerika ugu qanisan 2008 dii..."" This directly translates to Batten was ranked 190th out of 400 of the wealthiest people in America in 2008.
"
Kuwaan soo socda keebuu Batten ugu deeqay wax?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaamacadda Virginia**.

The text states: ""Waxa uu ka qalan jabiyay Kuleejka Sayniska & Artiska ee Jaamacada Virginia 1950 kii wuxuna deeq bixye wayn u ahaa machadkaas.""  This directly indicates that Batten was a major benefactor to the University of Virginia's School of Science and Art.
"
Maxay baan qayb ka ahayn sharciga uu saxiixay Guddoomiyaha Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Mamnuucida iibinta ama kiraynta ciyaaraha fiidiyowga rabshadaha leh ee da'yarta inta ka baxsan California.**

Here's why:

* The question asks what the law *doesn't* include.
* The text explicitly states the law *prohibits* the sale or rental of violent video games to minors *within California*.
* Options A and B are both included in the law.
* Option D is also included in the law, as the law requires games to be labeled.

Therefore, the law specifically targets sales/rentals *within California*, making option C the correct answer.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yay seegtay waxyaabihii la sheegay?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states: ""Duvall, who has a wife and two adult children, didn't seem bothered by Miller’s views on the topic. When asked for his opinion, Miller said, """"Mike talks a lot in court...I was preparing so I wasn't paying attention to what he was saying.""""""

This clearly indicates Miller was the one who wasn't paying attention to what was being said.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda keebaa khuseeya waayo-aragnimada kullanka maqalka ee Miller?","The correct answer is **B: Ma uusan ahayn mid usoo jeeda intii uu is diyaarinayay.**

Here's why:

The passage states: """"Waan is diyaarinaayey marka si fiican uma maqal wuxuu sheegaayinaa."""" This translates to ""I was preparing myself and therefore didn't hear well what he was saying.""

This directly indicates Miller wasn't paying attention or focused on Duvall's story while he was getting ready. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Yaa soo jeediyay in dib u eegis lagu sameeyo ‘Xeerka Hawada Nadiifka’?,"The correct answer is **C: Jack Layton**.

The text states: ""Layton ayaa codsaday in isbedelo lagu sameeyo sharciga bay’adda ay soo bandhigayaan xisbiga conservative-ka inta ay kula jireen shirka Raysul Wasaaraha, isagoo codsanaayo “dib u qoraal dhamaystiraan oo na buuxo” in lagu sameeyo sharciga bay’adda ay soo bandhigayaan xisbiga conservative-ka.""

This directly indicates that Jack Layton, the leader of the NDP, requested a review of the Clean Air Act. John Howard is mentioned as the Prime Minister who made the Act available for review, but Layton was the one who *asked* for the review. Stephen Harper is mentioned as the PMO leader, but not as the one who requested the review."
"""Yaa beeniyay in """"Xeerka Hawada Nadiifka"""" loo isticmaalay show ahaan doorashada kahor?""","The correct answer is **B: Raysal wasaaraha**.

The passage states: ""Balse Ra’iisul Wasaaraha John Howard waxa uu yidhi sharcigu waxa keliya loogu talo galay in cusbitaalka lagaga ilaaliyo inay hoos u dhigto dawladda Tasmaaniya, iyagoo bixiyay AUD$45 malyan.""  This indicates that Prime Minister Howard claimed the Clean Air Act was *only* for protecting the Mersey hospital funding, implying it wasn't intended as a political tool. Therefore, he was the one who downplayed the act's potential use in the election.

Maxay sameeyeen oo ka dhashay compounds-ka cyanuric acid iyo melamine markii ay isku falceliyeen kaadida bisadda?,"The correct answer is **C: Kiristaalo (Crystals)**.

The text explicitly states that the researchers saw ""wiriqyo kasameysan kaadida bisada iyadoo ay weheliso iskudarka melamine iyo cyanuric acid,"" which translates to ""crystals formed from the cat's vomit along with a mixture of melamine and cyanuric acid."" Therefore, the compounds formed through the interaction crystallized.
"
Maxay cilmi-baarayaashu u isticmaaleen spectroscopy infrared si ay u eegaan?,"The correct answer is **B: Samaysanka Kiristaalada kaadida xayawaanada Rabaayada ah**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baarayaasha waxay arkeen wiriqyo kasameysan kaadida bisada iyadoo ay weheliso iskudarka melamine iyo cyanuric acid. Waxyaalaha uu ka koobanyahay kiristalkani wuxuu matalaa kuwa laga helo kaadida xayawaanka carbiska ah marka la barbardhigo iyadoo la adeegsanayo isbegtorokobyga iftiinka leh (FTIR).""

This directly indicates that FTIR (infrared spectroscopy) was used to analyze the crystal structure of the kidney stones. The test compared the crystal structure to that found in kidney stones from cats.
"
"""Yaa Luna ugu yeeray """"Boqoradda Xad-jirka ah""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text explicitly states: ""Luna waxa ay aheyd boqoradii koowaad ee Aadka. Maareyaheygi ugu horeeye. Luna waxa ay dhimate habeenki lahaa labada bil. Qurux gooniyo sideedo kale ah. Naag hawl kar ah.""  This is directly attributed to Tommy Dreamer.
"
"""Yaa Luna ugu yeeray """"halista""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer waxa uu dhahay """"Luna waxa ay aheyd boqoradii koowaad ee Aadka..."""" This indicates Tommy Dreamer is the one referring to Luna as ""halista"" (which translates to ""a risk"" or ""a danger"" in this context, likely used metaphorically).
"
Maxay ayaan ku dhicin darawalkii bur-burka ku lug lahaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxaa ka soo gaaray dhaawac madaxa ah (He sustained a head injury)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""darawalka waxa madaxa ka soo gaadhay dhaawac khatara"" which translates to ""the driver sustained a serious head injury."" While the other options are true based on the passage, they aren't the answer to the question of what *happened to the driver*.
"
Maxay ahayd wax aan ka muuqan qaab ciyaareedka Koonfur Afrika inta lagu guda jiro tartanka rugby?,"The correct answer is **A: Shaqo kooxeed wanaagsan**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Anshaxooda difaaca, xirfada qabadashada kubada **iyo shaqada ay qabteen kooxda oo aad u wanaagsaneyd** wayna iska cadeed iney kooxdan badin doonaan.""  This directly highlights the strong teamwork as a key aspect of their performance.

While options B and D are also mentioned as positive aspects, the passage emphasizes the *teamwork* as the driving force behind their confident performance. Option C (Bandhig aad u quruxsan bilowgii tartanka) is misleading as it describes their initial dominance but doesn't capture their sustained performance throughout the game, as described later.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayay ciyaarta Koonfur Afrika bilowday inay soo wanaagsanaato?","The correct answer is **D: Hadba sidii tartanku usii socday** (As the game progressed).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Koonfur Afrika waxay si joogto ah uga soo raysay intay ciyaartu socotay."" This translates to ""South Africa steadily fought back as the game progressed.""  The initial score was 26-0 in favor of South Africa, but they improved throughout the match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Abbaaraha 10:00 subaxnimo (10:00 am in the morning):** This is when the game *started*, not when South Africa started playing well.
* **B: Ka dib markii la adkeeyay difaaca (After the defense was tightened):** While a strong defense was part of their improvement, the passage doesn't specify *when* the defense was tightened. It just says they improved *during* the game.
* **C: Kadib guuldaradii kasoo gaartay Zambia (After the defeat suffered against Zambia):** The passage says South Africa *defeated* Zambia 26-0. This is the opposite of a defeat.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, keebaa weedhahan soo socda aan si sax ah uga tarjumaynin dhaqaalaha Shiinaha?","The correct answer is **D: Shiinuhu waligiis ma dhoofin baabuur ka badan tan Jarmalka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Markii ugu horeysay, sanadkii tagay Shiinaha ayaa dhoofiyay in badan gawaarida Jarmalku dhoofiyo..."" This directly contradicts option D. The passage says China *exceeded* Germany's car exports.

Let's look at why the other options are correct translations of the passage:

* **A: Dhaqaalaha Shiinaha si aad ah ayuu u koray tan iyo markii la sameeyay dib u habeyn:**  The passage states the economy grew 90 times since Deng Xiaoping's reforms.
* **B: Shiinuhu wuxuu leeyahay suuq dhoofinta baabuurta oo ka weyn kan Maraykanka:** The passage says China became the largest car market, surpassing the US.
* **C: Shiinaha ayaa ugu dambeyntii yeelan kara wax soo saarka maxaliga ah ee GDP ka weyn kan Mareykanka:** The passage states China's GDP surpassed the US GDP for two years.



Therefore, option D is the *only* statement that is *not* accurately reflected in the provided text.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayuu wax soo saarka maxaliga ee GDP-ga Shiinaha uu dhaafi karaa kan Mareykanka?","The correct answer is **A: Kadib dib-u-habayn dhaqaale oo dheeraad ah**

Here's why:

The passage states that the Chinese economy experienced significant growth after Deng Xiaoping's reforms, increasing 90 times in size. It also says that China's exports surpassed Germany's and it briefly surpassed the US as the largest car market, and its GDP surpassed the US for two years.

The key phrase is ""Markii ugu horeysay, sanadkii tagay Shiinaha ayaa dhoofiyay in badan gawaarida Jarmalku dhoofiyo, waxa uuna dhaafay Mareykanka oo ahaa suuqa ugu weyn ee gawaarida."" This indicates that the GDP surpassing the US happened within a timeframe *after* the initial reforms. The passage doesn't give a precise timeframe like 2 years or 20 years, but it implies continued economic development is needed to reach that point. The phrase ""kadib dib-u-habayn dhaqaale oo dheeraad ah"" (after further economic reforms) is the most accurate reflection of this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Labaatan sano gudahood:** The passage doesn't suggest the GDP surpassed the US in just two years.
* **C: Marka uu dalku yeesho hoggaan cusub:** While new leadership can influence economic direction, the passage focuses on the impact of economic reforms, not leadership changes.
* **D: Soddon sano gudahood:** The passage suggests the significant growth happened *after* reforms, not necessarily *over* 30 years.
"
Muxuu Hu u soo jeediyay in wadamada soo koraya ay sameeyaan?,"The correct answer is **A: Qaadashada waajibaadka ku riixaya marxaladooda horumarineed (Taking on responsibilities that are appropriate for their stage of development).**

Here's why:

* The quote emphasizes that developed nations shouldn't be asked to take on burdens beyond their capacity, economic level, or responsibility.  Hu encourages them to ""take on responsibilities... that are appropriate for their stage of development."" This aligns directly with option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: In diirada la saaro wax soo saarka dhaqaalaha (Focus on economic output):** While the quote mentions economic output as a factor in setting emissions targets, it's not the *suggestion* Hu makes for developed nations. He's urging them to balance economic growth with environmental responsibility.
* **C: Ka gudubka mas’uuliyadda hadda saaran (Exceeding current responsibilities):** Hu explicitly states that nations shouldn't exceed their current responsibilities.
* **D: Ka fogaanshaha dariiqyadii hore ee wasakhaynta (Avoiding past polluting methods):**  While avoiding past pollution is a good thing, it's not the core message Hu conveys to developed nations.  He's encouraging a broader sense of responsibility.



"
Maxaa uusan xusin Hu?,"The correct answer is **D: tirada dhimista qiiqa kaarboonka (the number of carbon emission reductions)**.

The passage explicitly states that Hu Jintao did *not* specify a number for carbon emission reductions. He mentioned a target of peaking emissions in 2020, but the actual amount wasn't defined.  The passage highlights that the reduction would be ""agreed upon"" based on China's economic output.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **Aasaaska gaabin (Summary foundation):** While the text *is* a summary, the question asks what *Hu* didn't mention, not the summary itself.
* **Talooyin ku socda wadamada soo koraya ee ku saabsan wasakhaynta (Advice to developed countries about pollution):** Hu *did* give advice to developed countries. The text includes the quote about ""a path of first climbing and then cleaning.""
* **Taariikhda marka qiiqa kaarboonka la rajaynayo in la dhimi doono (The date carbon emissions are expected to be reduced):** Hu *did* mention the date (2020) as a target for peaking emissions.



"
Keebaa kuwan soo socda uu Ferman sheegay in xaaladdu aanay fiicnayn?,"The correct answer is **B: Angoola**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Angola waxay kusoo wajahan cudur ka dillaaca kii ugu darnaa xaaladduna aad bay u xuntahay Angoola."" (Angola is facing the worst epidemic and the situation is very bad in Angola.)

Therefore, the passage indicates that the situation is bad *in Angola*.
"
"Dacwad oogista awgeed, yaa qaadi doona jagada Golaha Wasiirada ee Huhne?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Huhne wuu is casiley waxaana lagu badeli doonaa Cabite Ed Davey MP."" This directly indicates that Ed Davey will replace Huhne in the Cabinet.
"
Yaa qaban doona doorka Wasiirka Ganacsiga ee dacwooyinka xeer ilaalinta?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP ayaa la filayaa inuu la wareego shaqada Wasiir Davey ayaa tagi doona."" This means Norman Lamb will take over the role of Secretary (Minister) David was leaving. David was the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy.
"
Maxay fanaaniinta masraxa ku dhiirigeliyaan dadwaynaha inay sameeyaan inta lagu jiro showyada Camille Saint-Saens opera?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka qayb qaadashada isticmaalka xashiishadda**.

The text explicitly states that theatergoers are ""sharing cannabis"" and the theater ""encourages the performers to join in the smoking.""  This directly translates to encouraging the audience to use cannabis.
"
Yaa ugu horrayn bilaaba cabida duuduubka xashiishka inta lagu jiro showga opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Jilayaasha**.

The text states: ""Sidaas daraaded, kuwa tiyaatarka saaran waxa ay wada cabayaan darogada cannabis, tiyaatarka laftirkiisana waxa uu ku dhiiri galinaya kasoo qeyb galayaasha in ay kuso biiran cabida.""  This translates to: ""Therefore, those on stage are all smoking cannabis, and the theater itself encourages the participants to join in the smoking.""  Since the performers (""kuwa tiyaatarka saaran"") are smoking, it indicates the actors/performers (""jilayaasha"") are the ones initiating the drug use during the opera.
"
"""Waa maxay magaca kale ee """"samo-kusocod"""" ee uu sameeyay Leonov?""","The correct answer is **C: Dhaqdhaqaaqa ka baxsan gaadiidka (EVA)**.

The text explicitly states: ""18 Maarso, 1965, ayuu sameeyay hawshii gaariga ka baxsanayd (EVA), ee ugu horeysay ama """"Socodka Samada""""..."" which translates to ""On March 18, 1965, he performed the first extravehicular activity (EVA), known as the ""Spacewalk""...""

While the other options are related to the context, they are not the specific name of the spacewalk itself.  ""Hawlgalka Apollo-Soyuz"" is a later joint mission. ""Tartanka Hawada"" is the space race. ""Cirbixiyeenka ruushka ee lambar 11"" is Leonov's designation.
"
Leonov howlgalkii soofiyetka qaybtee ayuu ka hogaamiyay?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Toban sano kadib, wuxuu hogaamiyay hawlgalka Apollo–Isagoo sawiraya in tartanka hawadu dhamaaday."" This directly refers to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which was a joint US-Soviet space mission.
"
Yaa ku dhaawacmay shilkaasi?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Kadib shilkii dhacay, Gibson waxaa loo qaaday isbitaalka laakiin wuxuu dhintay in yar ka dib."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital but he died shortly after.)

While children were present and scared, the only person explicitly stated to have been injured (and died) is Gibson.
"
Maxaa ku dhacay dadkii shilka ku lug lahaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Mid wuu dhaawacmay, midna wuu dhintay**

Here's why:

* **Gibson** (the person) died.
* The **driver** was unharmed.
* The children ran away, implying they were not directly involved in injuries.

Therefore, one person died (Gibson), and one person was unharmed (the driver).
"
Saynis yahanada ka shaqaynayay barnaamijka waxa ay rajaynayeen in ay u fiirsadaan saamaynta ay sababtay kuwan soo socda midkee?,"The correct answer is **C: Qaybaha yaryar (Small parts)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Aragtidan waxay leedahay maatarka madoow ee gaalagsiyada ku hareeraysan intiisa badani waxay gaalagsiga ugu hareeraysan yihiin qaab balli ah, **waxana ka samaysan yihiin qurubyo aad u yaryar.**""

Therefore, the scientists were expecting to study the impact of the small parts (or structures) within the black matter halos.
"
Saynis yahanadu waxa ay u fiirsadeen arinka kuwa soo socota midkee?,"The correct answer is **B: Dhulka iyo Galaxyada Sagittarius**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Qorshaha ayaa loo qoray in loo ekaysiiyo indha-indhaynta laga sameeyay kooxo-xidigeedka Sagittarius. Saamaynta kooxdu ay raadinayso waxaa saamayn doona awoodaha hirarka ee u dhaxeeya maatarka madow ee xiddig-urureedka iyo maatarka madow ee Cirjiideed. Sida dayaxa uu u sameynayo dhulka, taas u dhaw, sida Milky Way u sameyn dhulka Saittarius.""

This translates to: ""The plan was written to mimic the observation made by the Sagittarius stellar groups. The impact the group is seeking will be influenced by the gravitational forces between the black matter of galaxies and the black matter of Sagittarius. Like the moon forming the Earth, similarly, the Milky Way forms the Earth of Sagittarius.""

The passage directly links the Sagittarius galaxy and the Earth (or rather, the ""Earth of Sagittarius"" which represents the galaxy itself) as the subject of their observation and the basis for their plan. The moon and Earth analogy is used to illustrate the gravitational relationship between the Milky Way and Sagittarius. Therefore, the scientists were looking at **Dhulka iyo Galaxyada Sagittarius** (Earth and the Sagittarius Galaxy).
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaan dhanka muxaafidka laga dhaliilin?","The correct answer is **A: Kharashgaraynta gargaarka**.

The text states that conservatives sarcastically called the agreement ""The New Bush Deal."" This implies they were criticizing the agreement, likely for being overly expensive or wasteful. While the text mentions liberals focusing on helping specific people in Washington, the core criticism from conservatives is implied to be about the cost. Option D (""Kharashgaraynta dib u dhiska"") is too broad; the sarcasm suggests a more specific criticism of the financial aspect.

Therefore, option A (Kharashgaraynta gargaarka - wasting aid) best captures the sentiment of the conservatives' criticism.
"
Yaa dhaleeceynaya qandaraasyada dib u dhiska ee dadaallada gargaarka Duufaanta Katrina?,"The best answer is **B: Libaraalka**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Daliisha qolyaha laybaraalka ee u ku aaddan dib u dhisku waxay diiradda saartay siinta heshiiska dib u dhiska dad gaar ah oo Reer Washington ah."" This directly indicates that the liberal faction critical of the rebuilding efforts is pointing out the problems with the contracts.
* The text also mentions conservatives sarcastically calling it the ""New Bush Deal,"" implying they are critical, but the main criticism is coming from the liberal side.

Therefore, the liberals are the ones who are critiquing the reconstruction contracts.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, halkee laga arki doonaa nalalka dayax gacmeedka Stardust marka kowad?","The correct answer is **B: Waqooyiga Kaliforniya**.

The text states: ""Waxay u guuri doonta dhanka galbeedka ee waqooyiga California..."" which means it will first be visible in Northern California.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, dayax gacmeedku wuxuu dhigi doonaa rikoor midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda?","The correct answer is **A: Iftiiminta cirka inta ugu ballaadhan**.

The text states: ""Stardust wuxu rikoodhka ku geli doonaa dayax-gacmeedkii ugu dheerayaa ee abid ku soo laabta Dhulka, isagoo jebinaya rikoodh kii hore ee la dhigay 1969 markii uu soo laabtay Apollo X.""  It also mentions the comet will ""ifyimin doonta cirka California iyado mareysa bartamaha Oregon & Nevada & Idaho sidoo kale Utah."" This indicates the record being broken is for the longest return to Earth *and* the widest visible path through the sky.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka muuqashada magaalooyinka ugu badan:** While it passes over many states and cities, the emphasis is on the *visibility from the sky*, not the number of cities it passes.
* **C: Ku soo noqoshada Dhulka sida ugu dhaqsaha badan:**  The text mentions it travels at 5 mph and it will take at least one minute to travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles. This is not about speed, but about the overall journey length.
* **D: U safrida San Francisco ilaa Los Angeles sida ugu dhaqsaha badan:** This is a specific travel time between two cities and not the overarching record being broken.



"
Sidee ayay Dr. Malar Balasubramanian isugu dhawaayeen Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Hooyo**.

The text states that the deceased woman, Saroja Balasubramanian, was 53 years old. The doctor's name is Malar Balasubramanian, making them sisters. Therefore, Saroja Balasubramanian was Malar's mother.
"
Xagee laga helay maydka Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: Waddada dhinaceeda**

The text states: ""Halkaas ayayna ka heleen maydka Saroja Balasubramanian...meesha maalin kaamila"" which translates to ""There they found the body of Saroja Balasubramanian...in a spot for a day."" This indicates the body was found *alongside* the road.
"
Muxuu la wareegay website ka eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Iskaybii** (eBay was acquired by PayPal).

The question states that eBay is aiming to differentiate itself and become popular in markets where Skype is strong. The fact that it was acquired by PayPal is relevant context to eBay's current strategy. 

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
Muxuu eBay u raadinayaa inay ku guuleysto la wareegida?,"The correct answer is **B: Isku fidinta meelo kaloo cusub**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states eBay is aiming to ""expand into new markets such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil."" This directly relates to geographical expansion and reaching new customers.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Isku dhafka dakhligeeda:** While expanding into new markets *could* eventually lead to increased revenue, the primary driver mentioned is the geographic expansion itself.
*   **C: Kor u qaadida sumcadeeda:** Expanding to new markets can *help* build brand awareness, but the core goal stated is the expansion itself.
*   **D: Ku qancinta saamilayda:** The text doesn't mention convincing investors as the main reason for the expansion.



"
"Sida lagu xusay qoraalka, yaa aan la falgalin maxaabiista ku hadhay dayrka dagaalka ka bacdi?","The correct answer is **A: Wada-xaajoodayaasha**.

The passage states: ""Dhexdhexaadiyayaashu waxay isku dayeen inay dajiyaan xaaladda..."" which translates to ""Mediators tried to ease the situation..."" This indicates the mediators were trying to resolve the situation with the prisoners who refused to return to their cells. The other options (firefighting teams, officers, hospital staff) are described as reacting *to* the prisoners' situation, not mediating with them after the initial conflict.
"
Maxaa ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo ugu dambeyntii sababay in maxaabiista ay ka laabtaan rabshadda?,"The correct answer is **B: Sunta ilmada (Smoke inhalation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the fire started, the prisoners were huddled in the yard, overcome by smoke. The question asks what *eventually* caused them to return to their cells, implying a catalyst. While the fire itself initially caused the problem, the smoke inhalation was the direct cause of their desperate need to escape the yard and likely return to the relative safety of their cells. The other options are not directly linked to the prisoners' return to their cells in the passage:

*   **A: Wada xaajoodyo lagu guulaystay (Successful negotiations):** There's no mention of successful negotiations in the provided text.
*   **C: Maxaabiistii kale oo dhaawacantay (Other prisoners were injured):** While injuries are mentioned initially, the passage doesn't suggest this was the reason for their return to the cells.
*   **D: Dab (Fire):** The fire caused the initial problem but didn't directly cause their return to the cells; the smoke did.



"
"Fikirka Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, maxay tahay in dalka Iran uu iska xoreeyo?","The correct answer is **B: Kacaankii Islaamka**.

Here's why:

The text states that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said reliance on oil is a ""trap"" dating back to the Islamic Revolution of 1979, which was how the country freed itself. Therefore, the answer is the Islamic Revolution.
"
"Sida lagu xusay qoraalka, yaa qirtay saamaynta ay u gaysatay cunaqabatayntu dhaqaalaha Iran?","The correct answer is **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**.

The text states: ""Faallooyinka, oo toos uga socda talafeeshinku, waa markii ugu horeysay ee ilo madaxda sare ee Iiraan ka socda qirtaan in cunaqabataynadu wax saameyn ah yeesheen.""  And later mentions Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's statement about oil dependency being a ""trap.""
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ka mid ahayn habka codbixinta ee Faransiiska?,"The correct answer is **D: Codadka waxa tirinaya wakiilada musharixiinta.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Fiidnimadii, codadka waxa tiranaya mutadawiciin iyagoo aad korka loogala socdo, iyagoo raacaya habraac gaar ah."" This means the votes are tallied by volunteers, not the candidates' representatives.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the French voting process as described:

* **A: Sanduuqyada cod bixinta ee hufan (Secure ballot boxes):** The text explicitly mentions that ballot boxes were required to be tamper-proof until 1988.
* **B: Wakiilo ay soo direen musharaxiintu (Representatives sent by candidates):** Candidates could send representatives to witness the entire voting process.
* **C: Saxeexa liiska cod bixinta (Signing the voter list):** This is implied by the emphasis on a rigorous, procedural approach to voting.  Someone needs to verify who is voting.



"
Halkee ayay codbixiyeyaashu ku tilmaamayaan musharaxa ay doorteen?,"The correct answer is **B: Warqad hore loo daabacay dusheeda**.

The passage states: ""waaraaq hore loo sii daabacay ayuu ku muujiya musharaxa uu rabo kuna ridaa gal..."" which translates to ""He shows the candidate he wants on a pre-printed paper and throws it into a slot...""
"
Maxaa ku kalifay Allen inuu bilaabo raadinta siddeed sano ah oo uu Musashi raadinayo?,"The correct answer is **D: Danihiisa dagaalka (His obsession with the war)**.

The passage states: ""Allen aya la sheegay inuu ku maalgeliyey inta ugu badan hantidiisa sahaminta Badda wuxuuna ku bilaabay hawlgalkiisa inuu Musashi ka soo helo dagaal waqti dheeraaday."" This indicates that Allen's motivation is linked to his interest in the war and finding the Musashi, not financial gain (A or C) or simply the thrill of charting the seabed (B). The phrase ""dagaal waqti dheeraaday"" (long-standing war) points directly to his obsession/interest in the conflict.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, muxuu Allen ku bixiyay lacag aad u badan?","The correct answer is **B: Sahminta badda**.

The text states: ""Allen aya la sheegay inuu ku maalgeliyey inta ugu badan hantidiisa **s sahaminta Badda** wuxuuna ku bilaabay hawlgalkiisa inuu Musashi ka soo helo dagaal waqti dheeraaday.""  (Allen was said to have invested most of his fortune in **sea exploration** and began his operation to retrieve Musashi after a long war.)

While he used a ROV (which is part of the exploration), the main investment was in the broader activity of sea exploration.  He was investing in the *exploration* of the sea, specifically to find Musashi.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, kuwan soo socda kee ayaa u horseeday xaalado khatar ah gudaha iyo hareeraha warshada?","The correct answer is **A: Shidaalka Yuraaniyaamka (Uranium fuel)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that authorities suspect a container of **uranium fuel** has leaked and spread, causing the situation. While the other options (cesium radiation, white smoke, iodine) are *indicators* of the problem, the *cause* identified in the text is the uranium fuel leak.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ka mid ahayn talooyinka badbaadada ee loo soo jeediyay dadka deegaanka ka dib dhacdada ka dhacday warshadda?,"The correct answer is **B: Gudaha ku jir**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text emphasizes avoiding exposure to the white plume, not necessarily staying indoors.** The instructions are focused on preventing inhalation and contact with the contaminated area.
* **The text specifically mentions turning off air conditioners, avoiding flushing toilets/pipes, and avoiding using cooling appliances.**
* **Staying indoors might be advisable in general for air quality, but it's not explicitly stated as a key safety measure in this specific scenario based on the text.**  The concern is about the plume and potential contamination, not necessarily general air pollution indoors.

Therefore, ""Gudaha ku jir"" (staying indoors) is the option that is not directly mentioned as a specific safety recommendation in the provided information.
"
"Sida uu qabo Dr. Moll, waa maxay waxa ugu badan ee khuseeya XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **B: Kala duwanaanshiyaha iska caabbinta daawooyinka (Drug resistance)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Waxaa jira is dhexyaac badan iyo digniin sababtoo ah waxaa aad u sareeya heerka khatarta."" This translates to ""There is a lot of concern and warning because the risk level is very high.""  The following sentence then says, ""Waxaa jira kala duwanaanshiyaha cusub” which means ""There is new resistance.""  This directly points to the drug resistance being the primary concern associated with XDR-TB.

While options A, C, and D *could* be consequences of drug resistance, the text doesn't emphasize them as the *most* significant aspect, as it focuses on the resistance itself.
"
Immisa bukaan oo uu ku dhacay kala duwanaanshaha cusub ayaa la xaqiijiyay inay yihiin shaqaale daryeel caafimaad?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""dhowr bukaan ayaa la filayaa inay cudurka ka soo qaadeen cusbitaalka, sida uu aaminsan yahay Dr. Moll, ugu yaraa laba ka mid ah waxay ahaayeen shaqaalaha caafimaadka ee cusbitaalka."" (several patients are expected to have contracted the disease in the hospital, according to Dr. Moll, at least two of whom were hospital healthcare workers.)
"
Maxay tahay nooca tignoolajiyada uu isticmaalo nidaamka NextGen?,"The correct answer is **B: Tignoolajiyad tafatiran** (Satellite technology).

The passage explicitly states that NextGen ""isticmaalaa satalayd ku shaqeeya tignolajiyadda kaasi oo kasoo horjeeda raadaalada gaboobay ee dhulka."" (uses satellite technology that is opposed to outdated ground radar).
"
Sidee bay NextGen si toos ah uga faa'iidaysanaysaa maamulayaashsa taraafikada hawada?,"The correct answer is **A: Jidadka duulimaadka ee gaagaaban**.

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen helps aircraft fly on ""shorter routes"" and uses satellite technology to provide precise guidance. This directly benefits air traffic controllers by allowing them to manage aircraft with greater accuracy and efficiency, resulting in shorter, optimized flight paths.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Goobo diyaaradeed oo aad u tafatiran:** While NextGen might indirectly contribute to efficiency at airports, the passage doesn't specifically mention that as a direct benefit to air traffic controllers.
*   **C: Sii daynta kaarboonka oo is dhintay:** Reduced carbon emissions are a *result* of NextGen, but not a direct benefit *to* the air traffic controllers themselves.
*   **D: Shidaal yar:** Similar to carbon emissions, reduced fuel consumption is a consequence of NextGen's efficiency, benefiting the airlines and environment, but not a direct benefit to air traffic controllers.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaysan taariikhyahanadu aysan ku dhaleecaynin FBI-da inay diiradda saaraan?","The correct answer is **A: Kor u qaadista heerkooda guusha (Raising its success rate)**.

The passage states that the historian criticized the FBI for putting pressure on minor cases, particularly those involving limited drug offenses, ""in order to boost the company's success rate."" Therefore, the historian's criticism was specifically directed at the FBI's focus on improving its success metrics.
"
Maxay ka hortaga-fisqigu ku khasabtay FBI da inay samayso?,"The correct answer is **A: Inay u qaybshaan ilahooda dhanka kiisaska gawaarida la xado.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Tarik Hyerhanada claims the FBI is putting pressure on agents to inflate success rates, *specifically* in low-level cases like traffic stops. This pressure is forcing agents to prioritize these cases over more serious investigations.  This aligns directly with option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kobcinta heerka guusha ee wakaalada:** While inflated success rates might *lead to* a boosted agency success rate, the immediate action being forced is focusing on the low-level cases.
* **C: Diirad saarista dambiyada ay fududahay in la xaliyo:** This is a consequence of the pressure, not the direct action being *forced* upon the FBI.
* **D: Inay waqti badan ku galiyaan wakiilo u gaara kiisaska sawirada anshax xumada ah:** The passage mentions pressure to increase fingerprinting, but doesn't say agents are being forced to dedicate significant time to specialized units for these cases.



"
Maxaa ku dhacay baabuurka dab-damiska ee ka jawaab ceshay shilka burburka diyaaradii dagaal ee JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **C: Way qaraxday**.

The text states: ""Warbixinada deegaaneed ayaa sheegaayo in baabuurka dab damiska garoonka diyaarada uu gadoomay intuu u socday meesha.""  This indicates that the fire truck exploded while on its way to the crash site.
"
"shilkii burburkii diyaarada dagaal ee JAS 39C Gripen, garoonka waxaa laga xiray kuwee?","The correct answer is **A: Duulimaadyada ganacsiga**

The text states: ""taasoo madaarka ka xirtay duulimaadada ganacsiga."" which translates to ""which closed the airport to commercial flights.""
"
yuu Brzezinski u fidiyay hagis intii lagu jiray Kacaankii Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Karter**.

The text states that Brzezinski advised Carter on foreign policy during the 1976 election and then worked as National Security Advisor (NSA) under him from 1977 to 1981. The Iran Revolution happened during Carter's presidency.
"
Yaa hayay xilka La-taliyaha Amniga Qaranka illaa 1977-kii?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states: ""NSA ahaan, wuxuu ka caawiyay Carter inuu hab diblomaasiyadeed u maareeyo arrimaha adduunka, sida xerada David uu ballanqaaday...ilagoo ku xige Henry Kissinger."" This indicates Kissinger was the National Security Advisor *before* Brzezinski took the position in 1977.
"
Midkee kuwan soo socda aanan si sax ah uga tarjumeynin hayaan-xirfadeedka Bobek ee Partizan Belgrade?,"The incorrect translation of Bobek's career at Partizan Belgrade is:

**B: Wuxuu dhaliyay goolal ka badan ciyaaryahan kasta oo kale (He scored more goals than every other player).**

Here's why: The text explicitly states that Bobek scored 403 goals, and the question mentions he scored 468 goals in 468 games.  While 403 is a significant number, it's **not** more goals than *every other* player. The text specifically points out that he didn't have any other player match his goal or assist numbers.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: Wuxuu dhaliyay in ka badan 468 gool intii uu u ciyaarayay kooxda (He scored over 468 goals while playing for the club):** This is a direct and accurate translation of the provided information.
*   **C: Wuxu ahaa mid mar loo doortay ciyaaryahanka ugu wanaagsan taariikhda kooxda (He was once chosen as the best player in the history of the club):** This accurately reflects that he was named Partizan's best player in 1995.
*   **D: Wuxuu kasoo muuqday ciyaaro ka badan ciyaaryahan kasta oo kale (He appeared in more games than every other player):** The text states he didn't have any other player match his goal or assist numbers. Thus, it is implied that he played in more games than any other player.



Therefore, **B** is the only option that makes a statement that isn't directly supported by the given information.



**Final Answer: B**"
Weedhee ku saabsan taariikhda Bobek ee Partizan Belgrade ayaa run ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Wuxuu bilaabay inuu u dheelo Partizan 1945**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""Wuxuu ku biirey sanadkii 1945 wuxuuna joogay ilaa sanadkii 1958."" This directly confirms that he started playing for Partizan in 1945.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wuxuu u dheelay Zagrep ka hor Partizan Balgrade:** The text states he was born in Zagreb, but doesn't mention playing for a club there before Partizan.
* **C: Wuxuu u dheelay Partizan ilaa 1995:** The text states he played until 1958, not 1995.
* **D: Wuxuu helay caanimo kadib markii loogu codeeyay ciyaaryahanka ugu fiican ee Partizan:** While being named the best player is a significant achievement, the text focuses on his playing years first. The fact that he was named best player is *why* he gained fame, not the starting point of his time with the club.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, sifadee bay Heperonychus ay kaga duwan yihiin Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: Waxay leedahay cidi labaad oo ka sii weyn**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ciddidiisa labaad ayaa wayn, taasoo keentay magaca Hesperonychus taasoo la macno ah """"ciddi galbeedeed."""" "" This directly indicates that a larger second toe is a distinguishing feature of *Hesperonychus* compared to other dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay leedahay labo lugood:** Both *Hesperonychus* and *Velociraptor* are bipedal (walk on two legs).
*   **C: Waxay leedahay jidh dhamaan baalal ku dahaaran:** The passage says *Hesperonychus* had feathers, but doesn't say *Velociraptor* did not.
*   **D: Waa kuwo dhiiga diiran leh:** The passage states both have blood that is warm.



"
Micnaha “Hesperonychus” sifada jireed ee noocee ah baa laga soo xigtay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ciddiyaha**.

The text states: ""Ciddidiisa labaad ayaa wayn, taasoo keentay magaca Hesperonychus taasoo la macno ah """"ciddi galbeedeed.""""  This translates to ""Its second claw was large, which gave the name Hesperonychus, meaning 'western claw'.""
"
Kee baa run ah weedhahan soo socda ee ku saabsan toogashada?,"The correct answer is **C: Lamaanuhu sanad kahor ayay isku guursadeen Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lamaanaha ayaa guur ku galay Texas sanad ka hor waxay na u yimaadeen Buffalo si ay ula dabaal degaan asxaabta iyo qaraabada."" (The couple got married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and family.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ninka iyo xaaskiisa labaduba waxay ka soo jeedeen Texas:** The text only says they got married in Texas, not that they are from there.
* **B: Waxay ahaayeen shan dhibane:** The text says 40 people were shot, not five.
* **D: Toogashadu waxay ka dhacday Buffalo:** The text states they came to Buffalo *to* celebrate, but doesn't explicitly say the shooting happened there.
"
Weedhee ayaa sax ah oo ku saabsan dhacdada ay toogashadu ka dhacday?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxay ka dhacday munaasabad sannad-guurada ee Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Lamaanaha ayaa guur ku galay Texas sanad ka hor waxay na u yimaadeen Buffalo si ay ula dabaal degaan asxaabta iyo qaraabada."" This clearly indicates the anniversary celebration took place in Buffalo.
* The passage also mentions ""xaflad sanad guuro"" which translates to ""anniversary celebration"".
* Options B and C are incorrect because the passage specifies Buffalo, not a ""rasmi ah"" (formal) event or Texas.
* Option D is incorrect because it specifically states it was a wedding, while the context describes an anniversary.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxay ahayd waxa ay wadnaha farta ugu hayeen masuuliyiintu ee ku saabsan Luno?","The correct answer is **C: Daadashada shidaalka**.

The text states: ""Markabka 100 ka mitirka ah waxa uu ka baqay inuu rarka daadsho."" (The 100-meter ship feared that oil would spill.) This indicates that the main concern of the authorities was preventing an oil spill. While other factors were present, the fear of a spill is explicitly mentioned as the immediate concern related to the Luno incident.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, keebaa weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan burburka Luno aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **B: Markabka ayaa xiliga uu burburay waxaa saarnaa 100 mitir oo shidaal ah**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Luno waxa saarnaa 120-160 mitir oo saddex jibaaran oo shidaal ah markuu jabay..."" (Luno was carrying 120-160 meters of three tanks of fuel when it broke...).
* **Option B says:** ""Markabka ayaa xiliga uu burburay waxaa saarnaa 100 mitir oo shidaal ah"" (The ship was carrying 100 meters of fuel when it broke). This is **incorrect** based on the passage, which says it was carrying *120-160 meters*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Burburku wuxuu dhacay ka hor inta aan la qaadin shixnada:** The passage says the ship broke *when* it was carrying fuel, implying the fuel was already on board at the time of the breakage.
* **C: Marka la isku geeyo labo iyo toban shaqaalaha markabka ahaa, hal mid ayaa ka dhaawacmay:** The passage says ""san jabay"" (one injured).
* **D: Markabka ayaa lagu soo riixay dhanka dhagaxda biyo-jabka:** The passage says ""Markabka ayaa ka baqay inuu rarka daadsho"" (The ship feared it would flood), implying it was impacted by the fuel tanks breaking and leaking, not specifically hitting a submerged rock.



"
Tobankee sano ayay aljeeriya qaadatay xorinimada?,"The answer is **C: 1960-yadii**.

The text states: ""20yadii ayuu ku laabtay waddanka Aljeeriya oo dhowaan madax bannaani qaadatay..."" (He returned to Algeria, which had recently gained independence in the 1960s...).
"
Halkee ayaanan la dhigin shaashadaha telefishinka marka lagu jiro munaasabada janaasada?,"The best answer is **A: Magaalada Rome oo dhan**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""Dhowr telefishin oo waaweyn ayaa la dhigay meelo kala duwan **magalada Rome** si ay dadka u daawadan xaflada."" (Several large televisions were placed in various places **in the city of Rome** so that people could watch the ceremony.)
* While Poland (specifically Gdansk) also showed the ceremony, the text emphasizes the widespread placement of screens *within Rome*.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the information provided is that screens were placed throughout the city of Rome.
"
Halkee lagu qabtay munaasabadii aaska?,"The correct answer is **C: Fagaaraha St. Peter**.

The passage states: ""Dadka joogay tacsida St Peter's Square..."" which directly indicates the funeral took place in St. Peter's Square. While the funeral was observed in Rome and other places, the location of the actual ceremony was St. Peter's Square.
"
"Qaraxa kadib, yaa laga daaweeyay dhaawacyo halisa?","The correct answer is **A: Ugu yaraan shan qof**.

The text states: ""Wax dhaawac culusa lama soo sheegay, laakin ku dhawaad shan ruux oo goobta ku sugnaa marka uu qaraxa dhacay ayaa laga daaweystay shoog Cidina."" This translates to: ""No serious injuries were reported, but nearly five people who were present at the time of the explosion were treated for shock.""
"
Yaa soo sheegay in gaasku hoos ka daadanayay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dariska isla dhismaha (The neighbor of the building)**.

The text states: ""Markii qof deriskaa soo sheegay in gaas liidayso."" which translates to ""When a neighbor of the building reported that gas was leaking.""
"
"Sida lagu xusay qoraalka, imisa qof ayaa ku dhintay weerarka?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states:

* Edgar Veguilla sustained a head and facial injury.
* Kristoffer Schneider needs facial surgery.
* The driver, Zachary Cuddeback, died.
* Nicholas Alden died.

Therefore, a total of 4 people died.
"
Yaa hubkiisu ku fashilmay inuu rasaas rido ilaa xad inta weerarku socday?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""Qoriga Uka ayaa is jaam gareeyo asagoo ku haayo ninka shanaad madaxiisa."" This translates to ""The Uka's rifle jammed while he was aiming at the fifth man's head."" 

Therefore, Uka's weapon malfunctioned.
"
Ciyaarahaan soo socda keebaa loo codeeyay in laga saaro barnaamijka Olimbikada?,"The correct answer is **C: Kubadda Baseball**.

The passage states: ""...beesboolka iyo softball-ka, kuwaaso cod looga saaray cayaarah Olombikada sanadkii 2005."" This directly indicates that baseball was voted out of the Olympic program.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Squash, Karate** were mentioned as trying to get into the Olympics.
*   **Rugby** is being considered for reinstatement."
Ciyaarahaan soo socda keebaa Gudida Olimbikada u codaysay si loogu daro ciyaaraha?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Rugby, khaasatan midawga rugby, iyo gacanka halkaasoo laga dooranayo shan ciyaarood oo kale oo loogoo ix galiyo inay ka qayb qaataan olombikada."" (Rugby, especially rugby union, and handball are among five sports being considered for participation in the Olympics.)

While the passage mentions other sports that *tried* to get into the Olympics, it directly names rugby union as being considered.
"
Arthur Guinness wuxuu markii hore kiraystay St James' Gate Brewery ilaa imisa sano?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The text states: ""250 sannadood ka dib, Guiness waxa uu noqday ganacsi caalami ah..."" which translates to ""250 years later, Guinness became an international business...""  This indicates the timeframe after the initial lease.
"
Ilaa imisa bilyan bay soo saartaa Guinnes sanadkii?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states that Guinness now generates **in excess of 10 billion euros** annually.
"
Ilaa Imisa waddan oo ka tirsan Midowga Yurub ayaa laga helay fayraska H5N1?,"The correct answer is **C: Todobo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Faransiiska waa waddanki toddobaad ee ka mid ah Midowga Yurub ee uu silciyo fayraskan..."" (France is the seventh country in the European Union to be affected by the virus...)
"
Halkee bay ahayd meeshii kiiska fayraska H5N1 ee ugu dambeeyay laga helay?,"The correct answer is **A: Faransiiska**.

The text explicitly states: ""maarshlaan oo u dhaw lyon oo ku taal bariga Faransiiska."" which translates to ""near Lyon in eastern France.""
"
Goorma ayay ahayd markii ugu dambaysay ee Haiti ay la kulanto cudurka ka hor inta aysan faafitaanka sababin nabad ilaaliyayaashu?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800kii**.

The text states: ""Inta ay imaanin ciidamadaasi, Haiti ayaa arkin dhibaatooyin la xiriiro xanuunkaasi sanadaha 1800 ka dib."" (Before the arrival of these troops, Haiti had seen problems related to this disease since the 1800s.) This directly answers the question of when Haiti last experienced the disease before the UN peacekeepers potentially causing the outbreak.
"
Qashin halkee ka yimid ayaa ka qayb qaatay faafitaanka cudurka?,"The correct answer is **A: Wabiga Artibonite**.

The text states that the waste from the UN base was not properly disposed of, leading to bacteria entering the Artibonite River.
"
Maxay dowlada Irishka ay qorshaynaysaa inay samayso?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku wareejinta xukunnada dembiilayaasha daroogada**.

Here's why:

* The text states the government is emphasizing the importance of parliamentary law and that this matter is progressing.
* The government official mentions concern about those profiting from private permission for drugs and criminal activities related to them.
* The context points towards a move to *change* the existing laws regarding drugs and potentially prosecute those involved. The mention of ""dastuuriga ah"" (constitutional) suggests a formal legal change.
* Option A, ""Ku wareejinta xukunnada dembiilayaasha daroogada"" (Transferring jurisdiction for drug offenders) best fits this context. This implies a shift in how drug-related crimes are handled, likely involving stricter penalties or a different legal framework.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Soo bandhigga sharciyo aad u adag oo ku saabsan ogolaanshaha daroogada** (Introducing very strict laws about drug permission): While the government might introduce stricter laws, the text focuses more on the *criminal aspect* and jurisdiction.
* **C: Khafiifinta sharciyada ku saabsan ogolaanshaha daroogada** (Easing laws about drug permission): This is the opposite of what the text implies.
* **D: Ka dhigista daroogada wax aan danbi lahayn** (Making drugs not guilty): This is highly unlikely given the government's stated concern about criminal activities.



"
Maxaa si ku meel gaar ah sharci uga ahaa dalka Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Daroogada (Drugs)**.

The text explicitly mentions ""ogolaanshaha ku meel-gaarka ah ee daroogooyinka la xiriira"" which translates to ""permission for the private use of drugs."" Therefore, the law being specifically mentioned as being relaxed in Ireland relates to drugs.
"
Maxay tahay waxa looga shakisan yahay dembiilaha oo wali loo baarayaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Xadgudub (Assault)**.

The text explicitly states the suspect is being investigated for **""ku xad gudub ma ahan kharibaad""** which translates to ""not assault but robbery"".  However, the sentence continues to clarify what the suspect *did* do which is re-creating letters on signs. Therefore, the underlying incident that is being investigated is an assault, not a robbery.
"
"Markii la beddelayay calaamadda, muxuu tuhmanuhu samayn waayay?","The correct answer is **A: Beddelida mid kamida xarfihiisa** (Changing one of its letters).

Here's why:

The text states the criminal *changed* the ""O"" into an ""e"" by using a black marker to decorate the peace sign and heart. This implies he didn't physically damage the sign, but rather altered its letters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ku qurxiyay calaamad nabadeed** (Decorated the peace sign): While he did decorate it, the focus of the question is what he *didn't* do.
*   **C: Jir ahaan u waxyeeleeyay** (Physically damaged it): The text says the damage wasn't physical; it was a modification.
*   **D: Isticmaalka suuf-adag si wax uga beddelo** (Using a hard wool to change it): The text specifically mentions a *black marker*.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, midkee ayaa ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee aan lagu eedayn macalinkii luuqada Ingriiska ee Karno?","The correct answer is **C: Daabacaadda xayaysiisyada aan la fasaxin**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Barashada Casriga ah ayaa ku eedaysay inuu xayaysiino waawayn ku daabacay basagoon ogolaansho u haysan..."" (Modern Education accused him of posting large advertisements without permission...).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ku xadgudubka xuquuqda daabacaada:** While he *was* accused of this, the text says ""laakin dacwo laguma furin"" (but no lawsuit was filed).  The accusation itself is mentioned, but the concrete action isn't the primary accusation.
* **B: Shukaansiga ardayda:** The text mentions ""shukaansiga uu ardayda u dhigi jiray"" (the flirting he did with the students), but it doesn't state this as a formal accusation. It's part of what former students described.
* **D: Isticmaalka luqadda aan haboonayn fasalka dhexdiisa:** The text says he used ""af suuq fasalka kaga hadli jiray"" (market language in class), which implies informal language, but not necessarily *unsuitable* language. It's described as ""af suuq"" (market language), suggesting it was colloquial rather than offensive.



Therefore, **C** is the most directly and explicitly stated accusation in the provided text."
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, Rolando Mendoza yuusan afduubasho ku kaxaysan?","The correct answer is **B: boolis ka**.

The text states: ""Nin hore hore uga tirsanaa booliiska Filipino ayaa afduubay dalxiisayaasha Hong Kong..."" which translates to ""A former Filipino police officer kidnapped Hong Kong tourists..."" 

Therefore, Rolando Mendoza was a former police officer, and he was the one who committed the kidnapping.
"
"Iyadoo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, yaa kamida la haystayaasha aan la xaqiijin in xili hore la sii daayay?","The correct answer is **C: Sawir qaadyaasha**.

The text states: ""Lix lahayste, oo ay ku jiraan caruur iyo dad waawayn, ayaa horeyba laga soo daayay, waxa sidoo kale la soo daayay sawir qaadayaashii Filibiiniga ahaa."" (Six hostages, including children and adults, have already been released, Filipino photographers have also been released.)

Therefore, the Filipino photographers were among those released.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yaa ururinaya saxeexyada taageeraya sharciyeynta guurka isku jinsiga ah ee Brazil?","The correct answer is **A: Mudaaharaadayaasha (The protesters)**.

The passage states: ""Mudaharaadayaashu waxay rejaynayaan inay soo uruuriyaan 1.2 malyan oo saxiix si ay u hor dhigaan Koonagreeska Noofeembar."" (Protesters are aiming to collect 1.2 million signatures to push the Congress in November.)
"
Mudaaharaadayaashu yay siin doonaan arjigooda?,"The correct answer is **C: Golaha Qaranka ee Brazil**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *where* the protestors will submit their petition.
* The text states they are trying to gather 1.2 million signatures to present to the **National Congress of Brazil** in November.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaniisadda Roman Catholic:** While the Catholic Church is involved in the issue, the petition is directed to the legislative body.
* **B: Roberto Jefferson:** Roberto Jefferson is mentioned as currently holding the bill, but the petition is still going to the National Congress.
* **D: Duqa magaalada São Paulo:** The petition is not directed to the Mayor of São Paulo; it's a national issue.

Therefore, the National Congress of Brazil is the correct destination for the petition.
"
"Sida laga soo xigtay Armand Versace, maxaa si toos ah u dhacay ka hor inta aysan dadku bilaabin inay ka falceliyaan cimilada?","The correct answer is **A: Waxay bilowday in ay hoorto (The wind started to blow)**.

The passage states: ""Shan daqiiqo oo lagu soo muujiyey murayad waxaa bilaabtay dhaqdhaqaqa dabeesha..."" (After five minutes of a visual display, the wind started to blow...).  This is the first event mentioned before the more severe weather (rain and hail) began, and before the public's reaction.
"
"Sida laga soo xigtay Versace, goormay dabaylaha ugu xoogga badani bilowdeen?","The correct answer is **B: Roobka ka dib**.

The text states: ""ilaa daqiiqad ka bacdi, dabeesha waxay bilaabtay iney jarto xawaare 70km saacadiii ah... ka dib waxa yimi roob..."" This clearly indicates the heaviest snowfall occurred *after* the initial snowfall.
"
"ka hor Fred, immisa duufaanno oo waaweyn ayaa laga diiwaan geliyay bariga 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Sadex**.

The text states: ""Fred waa duufaantii ugu xooga badneyd ee weligeed laga diiwaamiyay koonfurta iyo bariga tan iyo markii la bilaabay sawirka dayax gacmeedka, **waana duufaanta saddexaad ee ugu weyneyd ee riroorka bariga 35°W**.""

This directly answers the question.
"
"Markii uu Fred uu ku sugnaa meel u dhow jasiiradaha Cape Verde, jihadee ayay ahayd mid u socotay?","The correct answer is **A: Galbeed**.

The text states that the duufaanta (storm) is located ""ilaa 645 mayl (1040 km) galbeed ka xigta jasiiradaha Cape Verde"" (up to 645 miles (1040 km west of the Cape Verde Islands).  Since Fred is traveling towards the storm and is currently heading north, he must be traveling in a westerly direction to get closer to the storm.
"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa xawaarihiisu uu ka dheereeya kuwii ka horreeyay?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Xawaaraha 802.11n ayaa si weyn uuga dheereya midkii ka horeeye oo lahaa ugu badnaan soo saarid 600Mbit/s gabi ahaanba."" (The speed of 802.11n is significantly greater than previous ones, which had a maximum output of 600 Mbit/s overall.)
"
Maxaa lagama maarmaan u ah 802.11n si uu u noqdo mid waafaqsan kuwii ka horeeyay 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: raadyo laba jibbaaran**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tani ayaa u ogolaanayso inay si gadaal gadaal ula waafaqdo 802.11a, 802.11b iyo 802.11g, shardiga oo keliga ah in xaruunta aasaasiga ay leedahay labo raadiyo."" This translates to: ""This allows it to backward-be compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, provided the base station has two radios.""

This means a key requirement for 802.11n to be backward compatible with older standards like 802.11b is that the device (usually the base station) *needs two radios* to operate on both 2.4 GHz and potentially other frequencies used by the older standards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Xawaare aad u dheereeya (Higher data rates):** While 802.11n *does* have higher data rates, this isn't the primary requirement for backward compatibility. Older standards like 802.11b have lower data rates.
* **B: Awoodda 802.11b uu u leeyahay inuu ku shaqeeyo 5.0Ghz (The ability of 802.11b to operate on 5.0 GHz):** 802.11b operates on the 2.4 GHz band, not 5.0 GHz.
* **C: Xawaare-qaad ee 600 Mbps (600 Mbps data rate):**  600 Mbps is the data rate of 802.11n, not a requirement for backward compatibility with 802.11b.



Therefore, the presence of *two radios* is the crucial factor enabling backward compatibility with older standards in 802.11n.
"
Immisa munaasabadood ayaa loo qorsheeyay in ku guulaystaha billada dahabka Olombikada uu ku dabaasho ciyaaraha Barwaaqo-sooranka?,"The correct answer is **A: Shan**.

The text explicitly states that the gold medalists were expected to participate in swimming events, specifically mentioning ""three relays of the aquatics freestyle"" but also the ""100m and 200m sprints."" This means a total of 3 (relays) + 2 (sprints) = 5 events.
"
Maxay buu ku guulaystaha billada dahabka ah ee Olimbikada uu xanuunkiisa daawo ugu qaadan waayay?,"The correct answer is **C: Asaga ayaa ka walwalsanaa in ay si xun u saameyn doonto fayoqabkiisa (He was worried it would negatively affect his performance).**

Here's why:

The passage states he *couldn't take the medication* because it was banned in his sport. The reason he couldn't take it wasn't because he wasn't in pain (Option A is incorrect). It was because he was afraid the medication would impact his performance (Option C). Option B is irrelevant, and Option D is too vague.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the reason he didn't take the necessary medication.
"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, maxaa keeni kara jahawareer ku saabsan dhaqdhaqaaqa dhulgariirka?","The correct answer is **A: Jiritaanka daruuro madow**.

The text states: ""Daruur madoow oo aan la xiriir wax foolkaane ah ayaa laga soo sheegay buurta salkeeda. Daruuruhu waxa ay suurto geliyen jahwareerka hawada in qarax folkaano rasmi ah dhacay iyo in kale."" This directly links the presence of the dark auroras to the possibility of air disturbances and confusion regarding a volcanic eruption.

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayuu isbeddel marxaladeed dhaca?","The correct answer is **C: 10-kii Maarso**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Muhiimada dhacdooyinka dhul gariirka waxay sababan dhulka isbeddel sida kan dhacay Maarso 10 keeda dhanka waqooyi bari fulkanaha..."" (The importance of the seismic events caused ground changes such as the one that occurred on March 10th in the northeast flank of the volcano...).
"
Midkeebaan weedhahan soo socda ee ku saabsan baaritaanka dayaxa ee Chandrayaan-1 baan run ahayn?,"The incorrect statement about the Chandrayaan-1 mission is:

**A: Samo-wareegaha kiciyay dayax-gacmeedka yari wuxuu lahaa shaqaale (The spacecraft that launched the lunar probe had staff.)**

Here's why:

*   The question is about the Chandrayaan-1 *lunar probe* itself. While there were undoubtedly teams of engineers and scientists involved in the *development* and *launch* of Chandrayaan-1, the probe itself didn't have ""staff"" in the traditional sense of people on board. It was an automated spacecraft.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the provided text:

*   **B: Dayax gacmeedka yari wuxuu ka koobnaa qalabyo muhiim ah (The lunar probe consisted of important instruments):** The text explicitly states, ""Marka laga tago inuu siday saddex qalab oo saynis oo muhiim ah..."" (Apart from carrying three important scientific instruments...).
*   **C: Diridda dayax gacmeedka yari waxay ahayd mid guuleystay (The lunar probe's launch was successful):** The text says, ""...waxaanu si guul leh u fariistay meel u dhow cidhifka koonfureed ee dayaxa."" (...we successfully launched it near the southern pole of the moon.).
*   **D: Dayax gacmeedka yari wuxuu lahaa dhinacyo midabaysan (The lunar probe had colored sides):**  The text mentions, ""...calanka qaranka Hindiya, oo dhinac kasta ku rinjisan."" (...the Indian national flag, colored on every side.).



Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda si sax ah u qeexaya baaritaanka dayax gacmeedka yar?,"The correct answer is **B: Soo degitaankeedii shileed wuxuu ahaa guul**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...waxaanu si guul leh u fariistay meel u dhow cidhifka koonfureed ee dayaxa."" This directly translates to "" ...we successfully landed near the southern rim of the moon.""
* Option B reflects this successful landing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxay ku degtay meel u dhow cirifka woqooyi ee Dayaxa** - The passage explicitly states it landed near the *southern* rim.
* **C: Waxaa laga dhex saaray dayax gacmeedka wayn** - The passage describes Chandrayaan as a *dayax gacmeed yar* (small lunar rover).
* **D: Waxay waday labo qalab oo aad u muhiim ah** - The passage mentions it carried *three* important scientific instruments.

"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo qoraalka, halbeegee ka hortagga cudur ayaa la hirgelin doonaa ugu dambeyn?","The correct answer is **C: Tallaalka encephalitis**.

The text explicitly states: ""Dhawr milyan weel oo talaalka encephalitis ayee ballan qaaday dawladda..."" (The government has promised several million doses of encephalitis vaccine...). This indicates that the vaccination is the planned method for preventing the disease. While other measures like anti-venom and mosquito nets are mentioned, the vaccine is the primary preventative measure being deployed.
"
Sidee buu cudurku uugu gudbaa dadka?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaneecada**.

The text states: ""Cudurka waxaa qaada doofaarka, kaas oo markaas u gudbiyo aadanaha asagoo u sii marinayo kaneecada."" (The disease is contracted from ticks, which then transmits it to humans by passing through ticks.)
"
Fashilanka jumlada labaad maxay noqon kartaa natiijada?,"The correct answer is **B: Xuquuqda mustaqbalka ee ururada rayidka ah ee guurka-isku-jinsiga ah**

Here's why:

The text states that the failure of the second attempt to ban same-sex marriage ""could open the door to legal same-sex marriages in the future.""  The question asks what the *failure* of the second attempt might lead to.  The most logical consequence of opening the door to legal same-sex marriage would be the advancement of rights for LGBTQ+ organizations.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Dib u eegis degdeg ah oo HJR-3:** The text says HJR-3 will be reviewed during the next election cycle, not immediately after the failure.
*   **C: Fadhi sharci dejineed oo deg-deg ah:**  While possible, the text doesn't suggest the failure *automatically* triggers an emergency legislative session.
*   **D: Mamnuucidda ururada rayidk ah ee guurka-isku-jinsiga ah:** The text indicates the opposite is more likely - the failure could *enable* these organizations.



"
"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, goorma ayaa jumlada labaad la masaxay?","The correct answer is **A: Inta lagu jiray fadhigii sharci dejineed**.

The text states: ""Fadhiga sharci dejinta ayaa isbeddel sameeyay ka dib markii xukunkii labaad ay ugu horreyntii masaxeen Golaha Shacabku..."" This indicates the second sentence was removed *during* the legislative session.
"
"""Yaa si qarsoodiya loogu siidaayay """"Waraaqaha Panama""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Shirkadda Mossack Fonseca**.

The text states: ""Dukumeentiyadu waxay tusinayaan in afar iyo toban bangi ka caawiyeen macaamiil qani ah qarsashada balaayin doolarka Maraykanka ah si ay uga baxsadaan cashuurta iyo shuruuco kale. Dukumeentiyadu waxay ka yimaadeen shirkad sharciyeeda Reer Baanama Mossack Fonseca..."" This clearly indicates that Mossack Fonseca is the source of the ""Panama Papers.""

"Sida ku xusan qoraalka, yaa ay ku andacoonaysa saxaafadda Ingiriisku in uu maamulayay shirkado badan oo loo isticmaali jiray in lagu qariyo hantida?","The correct answer is **C: Bangiga Deutsche**.

The text states: ""Jariiradda Ingiriiska ee The Guardian ayaa soo jeedisay in Bangiga Deutsche uu maamulo ku dhowaad saddex meelood meel shirkadaha beenta ah ee tan lagu gaadhay."" (The English newspaper The Guardian has suggested that Deutsche Bank managed nearly three-quarters of the shell companies involved.)
"
Shilalkan diyaaradeed midkee ayaa lahaa dhimashadii ugu badnayd?,"The correct answer is **C: Diyaaradda ayaa ku burburtay xilli ay kusii jeedday dalka Armenia kuna sii jeeday dalka Iran**.

The passage states: ""Isla bishaas ayee aheed markii diyaarad u socotay Armenia dib u soo noqotay kuna dhex socotay darbi, taaso dishay toban iyo todobo."" This translates to ""At the same time, a plane traveling to Armenia turned back and crashed into a barrier, killing seventeen.""  This is the incident with the highest death toll mentioned in the text.
"
Kuwaan soo socda keebaan sabab u ahayn shilalka badan ee diyaaradeed ee ka dhaca Iran?,"The best answer is **C: Cunaqabataynada ayaa ka hor istaagaysa iibsashada diyaaradaha cusub.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Cunaqabateynta caalamiga waxa ay ka dhigneyd in diyaarad cusub lasoo gadan karin."" (International sanctions made it impossible to acquire new planes.)
* **The other options are related but not the *primary* reason highlighted in the text:**
    * A: While the text mentions both civilian and military planes, the core issue is the inability to *replace* planes due to sanctions.
    * B:  The text doesn't directly say there's a lack of budget, it says sanctions prevent purchasing.
    * D:  While poor maintenance is mentioned, the sanctions are presented as the main obstacle preventing the acquisition of *new* planes.

Therefore, the sanctions are directly linked to the repeated accidents because they prevent Iran from modernizing its fleet."
Kee baa kuwan soo socda aan lagu darin warbixinta ka soo baxday Kooxda Daraasaadka Ciraaq?,"The correct answer is **B: Baaq ah in isbedellada qaarkiis, rabshadaha sii kordhaya ee Ciraaq lagaga fogaan karo.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the report **""si wayn ayay u dhaleecaynaysaa qayb kasta oo ka mida siyaasadda hadda ee Fulinta ee ku aaddan Ciraaq waxayna si adag ugu talinaysa in si degdeg ah wax loo beddelo.""** This directly addresses the need for changes to avoid further unrest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhaleecaynta siyaasadda hadda ka jirta:** The text confirms this is present.
* **C: Talooyin ah in lasugo xuduudaha Ciraaq:** While this is *one* of the 78 recommendations, the question asks what is *missing*. The report *does* contain recommendations about the borders.
* **D: Codsi ku saabsan waafaqida Maraykanka:** This is present in the report's call for a diplomatic approach and a call for US agreement.



"
Kuwan soo socda midkee ka mid ah oo aysan ku boorrin kooxda daraasaadka Ciraaq warbixintooda?,"The correct answer is **A: In lagu dhawaaqo dammaanad lagu joojinayo rabshadaha sii kordhaya.**

Here's why:

* The report explicitly states that ""no one can dare to assume that any step taken at this time can stop the war, the growing unrest, or the turmoil in the country."" This directly contradicts the idea of a ceasefire being possible.
* The report *does* call for a diplomatic strategy, a re-evaluation of current policies, and the establishment of new diplomatic ties.
* The report *does* advocate for open dialogue.

Therefore, calling for a ceasefire is the *opposite* of what the report suggests.



"
"Sida laga soo xigtay booliska, yaa loo tixgelinayay inuu ahaa kaaliyaha Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Booliisku waxay sheegeen in Lo Piccolo gacan sarreeyay maadaama uu ahaa gacanta midig ee Provenzano..."" which translates to ""The police stated that Lo Piccolo was Provenzano's right-hand man...""
"
"Iyada oo lagu salaynayo macluumaadka lagu xusay qoraalka, maxaa sababay dhimashada Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: Waxa lagu dilay dagaalkii Riina ka socday.**

The text states: ""Madaxda uu xukumi jiray Provenzano marka uu joojinayay dagaalki Riina ee looga soo horjeday gobolada dilay dadkii u doodi jirki Mafiyada Giovanni Falcone iyo Paolo Borsellino sanadka markuu ahaa 1992.""

This directly links the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino to the Riina war and the conflicts surrounding it. The other options are not supported by the provided text.
"
Midkee kuwaan soo socda aanan ahayn abaalmarinihii Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **A: Laba jeer Koobka Adduunka ku guulaystay**.

Here's why:

* The text states Saito was a former World Champion and Olympic gold medalist.
* It also mentions he was the president of the Judo Federation of Japan.
* The text explicitly says he won two Olympic gold medals.
* **However, it *doesn't* mention him winning the World Cup twice.**

Therefore, the statement that he won the World Cup twice is not supported by the provided text.
"
Halkee ayuu Iwasaki naftiisa ku awooday inuu iska ilaaliyo inuu nidar galo?,"The correct answer is **C: Hindiya**.

The passage states Iwasaki was ""guur kaga baxsaday Nepal waana lagu xiray Hindiya"" which translates to ""he fled Nepal and was imprisoned in India."" This indicates he was in India when he was prevented from sleeping.
"
Yaa soo weeraray Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ey**.

The passage states: ""waxa eey cudur qaba ayaa ku weeraray Tibet"" which translates to ""a sick wolf attacked him in Tibet.""
"
Halee ayuu Alonso ku dhameeyay tartankiisii?,"The correct answer is **A: Kadib markii Schumacher uu ka waxyeelleeyay afka hore ee lugta**.

The text states: ""Fernando Alonso ayaa hogaaminaye tartamada intooda badan, laakin waxa uu ku dhameeye wax yar un kadib, malaha lug horaa si xun ugu xirneed.""  This translates to: ""Fernando Alonso was leading most of the race, but he finished shortly after, perhaps because he badly twisted his ankle.""

While Michael Schumacher's issue is mentioned, it's not directly related to Alonso's retirement.  Therefore, option A is the only one supported by the provided text.
"
Maxaa sababay in Schumacher dhameeyo tartankiisa xilli hore?,"The correct answer is **D: Waxyeellada soo gaartay laalka gaariga (Damage to the car's suspension)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Michael Schumacher wuxuu dhammeeyay tartankiisii ​​wakhti aan dheerayn Alonso kadib, sababtuna tahay biraha shaagaga ayaa cillad ku timi intii uu socday tartanku."" This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher finished his race shortly after Alonso, the reason being that there was a problem with the suspension during the race.""
"
"Sida ku xusan mariska, yay ahayd shaqadiisa inuu u jaangooyo kafaala qaadida dadka xiran?","The correct answer is **B: Garsoore Glynn**.

The passage states: ""Abril sannadkan, xarunta ku soo riday Xaakim Glyne si uu dhaqan geliyo sii daynta kuwii la haystay in ka badan 24 saacadood ka dib markii la qabtay ee aanay dacwadooda dhegaysanin maxkamadi."" This directly indicates that Judge Glynn issued the order for the release of prisoners.
"
"Marka loo eego amarka xannibaadda ku-meel-gaarka ah ee lagu sheegay mariska, maxaa loo oggol yahay dadka la soo xiray si loogu sii hayo in ka badan 24 saacadood?","The correct answer is **C: Eedaha rasmiga ah ee uu soo saaray Garsoore Glynn**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abril sannadkan, xarunta ku soo riday Xaakim Glyne si uu dhaqan geliyo sii daynta kuwii la haystay in ka badan 24 saacadood ka dib markii la qabtay ee aanay dacwadooda dhegaysanin maxkamadi. Gudoomiyaha ayaa qoondeeyo damiinashada, hadii la ogolaado, wuxuu na rasmi ka dhigaa dacwada uu ku soo qortay saraakiilka soo xiray shakhsiga.""

This means that for a detention to exceed 24 hours, a formal charge must be issued by Judge Glynn. Options A, B, and D are not the primary requirements for extending the detention under this specific order.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sababtee loo isticmaali waayay in lagu sharaxo tartanka la joojiyay?","The correct answer is **D: Madmadowga dastuuriga ah (Constitutional deadlock)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that diplomats lack sufficient confidence in Afghanistan's constitution and that the decision to halt the final round of elections is due to this lack of confidence. This points directly to a constitutional deadlock.
* While security concerns (A) and high costs (C) are mentioned as reasons for the election delays in general, the *reason for halting the final round specifically* is the uncertainty surrounding the constitution.
* The text mentions the ""constitutional deadlock"" (D) as the reason the final round of elections is being cancelled, directly addressing the question.



"
Waa maxay sababta dibloomasiyiintu aay ugu dambayntii u qaateen tartanka in uu yahay mid aan loo baahnayn?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxaa jiray mugdiyo badan oo kajira xaga dastuurka (There was significant uncertainty regarding the constitution).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Diblomaasiyiinta ayaa sheegay inay heleen hubniin la’aan ku filan dastuurka Afghanistan oo ay ku go’aamiyaan ku celinta marxaladda ugu dambeysay ee doorashadda in loo baahneen."" This translates to ""Diplomats said they had sufficient uncertainty regarding the Afghan constitution and decided to reinstate the final stage of the election.""  This uncertainty about the constitution is the key reason for their hesitation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxay ka hortimid dastuurka (They opposed the constitution):** The text doesn't say they *opposed* the constitution; they were uncertain about it.
* **B: Waxaa jiray khataro dhanka ammaanka ah (There were security risks):** While the passage mentions the costs and risks of elections, the uncertainty of the constitution is presented as the primary driver for the diplomats' decision.
* **D: Doorashada ayaa ahayd mid aad qaali u ah (The election was very expensive):**  The text mentions costs, but again, the constitutional uncertainty is the main reason they are questioning the election's necessity.



"
Yaa bixiyaa adeegyada garsoorka FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Wakiilada Siyaasada**.

The text explicitly states: ""Wakiiladaasi waxay ka masuul yihiin bixinta adeegyada sharciyeed ee dawladda ee ku yaal Xeerka 247 ee Dastuurka Bakistaan."" (These representatives are responsible for providing governmental legal services as outlined in Law 247 of the Constitution of Pakistan.)
"
"""Keebaa weedhahan soo socda ee ku saabsan """"Wakiilada Siyaasadeed"""" ee FATA aan run ahayn?""","The correct answer is **A: Waxay bixiyaan adeegyada garsoorka (They provide paramilitary services)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Wakiilada Siyaasadeed"" (Political Agents) were appointed by the President of Pakistan to administer FATA (Federally Administered Tribal Areas) and essentially had significant autonomy.  The passage also explicitly mentions they are responsible for providing *legal* governmental services under Law 247 of the Constitution.

Option A, ""Waxay bixiyaan adeegyada garsoorka"" (They provide paramilitary services), is the incorrect answer. The passage describes a role focused on legal and governmental services, *not* military or paramilitary duties.  The other options are supported by the passage:

* **B: Iyaga waxaa soo xushay madaxweynaha Pakistan (They were appointed by the President of Pakistan)** - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **C: Waxay u hoggaansameen dastuurka Pakistan (They adhered to the Constitution of Pakistan)** - The passage mentions they operate under Law 247 of the Constitution, implying adherence.
* **D: Waxay si buuxda gacanta ugu hayaan goobaha qaarkood (They fully controlled certain areas)** - The passage states they had near-complete autonomy, meaning they controlled areas effectively.



Therefore, the statement that ""Waxay bixiyaan adeegyada garsoorka"" (They provide paramilitary services) is the one that is *not* accurate based on the provided text.
"
Abaalmarintee ayay Emma Stone loo magacaabay?,"The correct answer is **C: Atariishada ugu Fiican**

The passage states that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone are being nominated for ""Jilaaga iyo Jilaayadda ugu fiican siday u kala horeeyaan,"" which translates to ""Best Actress and Best Actor.""  Therefore, Emma Stone is nominated for Best Actress.
"
Abaalmarintee ayaan filimkaas aan loo magacaabin?,"The correct answer is **D: Heesta asalka ah ee ugu Fiican**.

The text states: ""Laba heesoo oo laga keenay filimka, Audition (Doqomada Riyooda) iyo Magaalada Xiddigaha, ayaa helay inay u tartamaan heesta asalka ah ee ugu wacan."" (Two songs from the film, ""Audition (The Artist's Choice)"" and ""City of Stars,"" have been selected to compete for Best Original Song.)



"
Kuwan soo socda kee baa sii shaqaynayay dhulgariirkii ka dib?,"The correct answer is **D: Xarunta warshada korontada kaso saarto tamarta aasaasiga ah ee ku taalo Niigata**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""NHK ayaa sidoo kale sheegtay in warshadda quwadda nukliyeerka Kashiwazaki Kariwa ee ku taalo Niigata ay si caadi ah u shaqaynaysay."" (NHK also reported that the Kashiwazaki Kariwa nuclear power plant in Niigata was operating normally.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhamaan fal-galayaasha warshada tamarta Shika ee Hokuriku** - The text doesn't mention the Hokuriku Electric Power Co. or the Shika power plant.
* **B: Garoonka diyaaradaha ku yaalo Ishikawa** - The text says ""Madaarka Noto ee Ishikawa isna waa xiran yahay"" (Noto Airport in Ishikawa is still closed).
* **C: Dhamaan adeega jidka tareenka** - The text states ""adeega tareenada ayaa meelaha wax ka dhaceen kala go'ay"" (train service was suspended in some areas).



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kuwan soo socda kee baa ayuu waxyeello u geystay dhulgariirku?","The correct answer is **C: Wadooyinka qaar**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Waddooyinka qaar baa dhaawacmay..."" (Some roads were damaged...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Guryaha qaar (Some homes):** The text mentions 9400 homes were without water and nearly 100 without electricity, but doesn't explicitly say the homes themselves suffered damage.
* **B: Laba fal-gale oo laga isticmaalo warshada tamarta Shika (Two reactors used at Kashiwazaki Kariwa power plant):** The text says reactors 1 and 2 were shut down, but doesn't state they were damaged by the earthquake.
* **D: Garoonka diyaaradaha ee Noto (Noto Airport):** The text states Noto Airport is *still* closed, implying it was affected, but doesn't say the earthquake *caused* the damage. It just indicates a consequence.



Therefore, **C** is the only option directly supported by the text."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Arrimaha soo socda keebaa aan lagu darin dukumeentiga?","The correct answer is **A: Mustaqbalka Jerusalem**.

Here's why:

* The document explicitly mentions the border dispute and the presence of Israeli forces in the Jordan Valley. 
* While the document mentions the 1967 war as the context for the border dispute, it doesn't detail the reasons *why* the war happened.
* The document mentions the differing claims over the Jordan Valley and Jerusalem's holy status, but doesn't delve into the future of Jerusalem itself. 

Therefore, the document does not address the future of Jerusalem."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ka mid ahayn dalabaadka aay doonayso Falastiin?,"The correct answer is **D: Shan sano oo ciidan uu ku sugnaanayo dooxada ama toga Jordan.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what Palestine *doesn't* want.** The passage states that the PA and Israel *agreed* on Israel's military presence for *five years* if a peace agreement is signed. This directly contradicts option D, which states that Palestine wants a five-year military presence.
* **Options A, B, and C are all stated as Palestinian demands in the passage.** They desire pre-1967 borders, oppose Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley, and seek a resolution regarding Jerusalem's future.



Therefore, option D is the only option that doesn't align with what the passage describes as a Palestinian position."
Dalkee ayay Ma uu ku baratay cilmiga sharciga?,"The correct answer is **A: Maraykanka**.

The text states: ""Ma waxa uu dhigtay Jaamacada New York **iyo Dugsiga Sharciga ee Harvard** marna waa..."" (Ma studied at New York University and Harvard Law School...). Harvard Law School is in the United States.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, wadankee u gargaaray u doodista guusha doorashada Ma?","The correct answer is **A: Maraykanka**.

The text states that Ma ""waxa uu lahaa kaarka degganaasha rasmiga ee Mareykanka """"green card""""."" (he had an official US residence card/green card). This indicates that the United States provided him with a green card, which is a form of immigration permission. The text also mentions he ""waxa uu wafaqay inta lagu guda jirey doorashada"" (he agreed during the election), which implies the US played a role in facilitating his participation.
"
"Sida ku xusan tuduca, yuu Carolyn Wilson u shaqeeyay ka hor inta uusan magaalada kuusan ka tagin?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states: ""Markay kireystayaasha isu sheegeen waxa ku dhacay, badi qoysaska ku dhex jiray arrinta ayaa isla markii fahmay in Carolyn Wilson ee shirkadda OHA ay dhacday lacagtii dhigashada, ka dib na magaalada ka baxsatay."" This directly indicates that Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA (Office of Housing and Community Development).
"
"Iyadoo afar tartan ay ka harsan yihiin xilli ciyaareedka, yaa ku jira kaalinta afraad ee Horyaalka Darawallada?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

The text states: ""Kaalinta saddexaad, Hamlin ayaa labaatan dhibcood danbeeya, balse shan ka horeeya Bowyer."" This means Bowyer is in fourth place.
"
"Ayada oo la raacaayo tartanka lagu sheegay ama lagu xusay tuduca, imisa dhibcood ayuu Kahne ka leeyahay ama uu ka helay Horyaalka Darawaliinta?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kahne iyo Truex, Jr. iyana waxay ku jiraan kaalinta shanaad iyo lixaad siday u kala horeeyaan iyagoo kala wata 2,220 iyo 2,207 dhibcood."" This directly indicates that Kahne has 2,220 points.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Immisa jeer ayay dadku arkeen saadaasha hawada soo dhacaysa taas oo markii dambe caddaynaysa inay asal ahaan ka soo jeedaan Martian?","The correct answer is **B: Shan jeer**.

The first sentence of the passage states: ""Waxa la rumaysan yahay inay tani tahay markii shanaad ee dadku arkaan shay kiimiko ahaan loo xaqiijiyay inuu Maaras ka yimi oo Dhulka ku soo dhacay.""  (It is believed that this is the fifth time people have seen an object chemically confirmed to be of Martian origin and fallen to Earth.)
"
"Sida ku xusan tuduca, maxaa run ah arinta ku saabsan dhagaxyada la ogaaday in ay asal ahaan yihiin Mariyaan?","The correct answer is **D: Waxaa jira 34 oo iyaga ka mid ah**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ku dhawaad 24,000 cirjiidheed ee la og yahay inay ku soo dhaceen Dhulka, keliya ilaa 34 ayaa la caddeeyay inay ka yimaadeen maaris."" (Nearly 24,000 meteorites are known to have fallen on Earth, only about 34 of which have been proven to be of Martian origin.)
"
Goorma ayuu Schumacher shaqada ka fadhiistay?,"The correct answer is **A: Kadib shilkii Felipe Massa**.

The text states that Schumacher was supposed to replace Felipe Massa *because* of Massa's injury.  The injury happened in 2009, and the text specifies Schumacher was considered for the role *after* the accident. While Schumacher had already won seven championships, the text directly links the opportunity to replace Massa to the accident.
"
Goorma ayuu Massa dhaawacmay?,"The correct answer is **A: Inta lagu jiray tartanka Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""Massa ayaa kasoo gaaray dhaawac khatara oo dhanka madaxa ah shilkii Hungarian Grand Prix ee 2009 kii."" This translates to ""Massa sustained a serious head injury in the Hungarian Grand Prix of 2009.""
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, sidee dib u habaynta u saamayni doontaa AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Tirada isticmaaleyaasha AOL waxa la tartami doona isticmaaleyaasha Yahoo iyo Microsoft**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL has successfully established itself in the IM market and is widely used in the US. However, it also mentions that the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft could rival AOL's. This indicates that AOL will face competition from these larger players.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tirada isticmaalayaasha AOL waxay u badan tahay inay kordhi doonaan:** The passage doesn't explicitly state that AOL's user base will increase. It only highlights the potential for competition.
*   **B: AOL waxay noqon doontaa shirkadda kaliya ee horumarisay suuqa IM-ka:** The passage implies competition, so AOL won't be the only player.
*   **D: AOL mar dambe lgama sii isticmaali doono Wadanka Maraykanka:** There's no indication of AOL leaving the US market.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the situation described in the passage: AOL will face competition from Yahoo and Microsoft.
"
Kuwa soo socda kee baa laga yaabaa inuu dhammaan doono kadib markii la sameeyay habaynta cusub?,"The correct answer is **C: Xornimada AOL ee aay u hormarinayso suuqa ballaaran ee u gaarka ah**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that AOL has successfully established a niche market for its private IM service, leading to widespread adoption in the US.
* The question asks what is likely to *end* after the new integration.
* The passage implies that the integration of Yahoo! and Microsoft into the market will threaten AOL's ability to maintain its unique, privately focused market position.  Therefore, AOL's independence in fostering this niche market is the most likely outcome to cease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Horumarinta Ballaaran ee xaga internetka ee Wadanka Mareykanka (Broad growth of the internet in the USA):** The passage doesn't suggest the overall internet growth will end.
* **B: Isticmaalka suuqa IM-ka (Use of the IM market):** IM usage is likely to continue, even with increased competition.
* **D: Iskaashiga shirkadaha Yahoo iyo Microsoft (Collaboration between Yahoo and Microsoft):** The passage frames the integration as a threat *to* AOL, not a collaborative effort that ends.

The text states: ""...dabaa laba askari in ka badan labaatan qof oo kalena waa dhaawacay."" ( ...more than twenty people were killed and over twenty were injured.).  It also specifies that 9 of the killed were police officers. Therefore, the number of non-police casualties is more than 20, and the closest option is 19. 

I apologize for the initial error in my response.

Ayaa soo sheegtay qofka la tuhunsan yahay ee weerarka lagu eedeeyey?,"The correct answer is **A: Booliiska**

The text states: ""Booliska ayaa sheegay inay uga shakisan yihiin qof mitid ah oo ka tirsan Daesb (ISIL) inuu weerarka ka masuul ahaa."" (The police said they suspect a lone individual affiliated with Daesh (ISIL) was responsible for the attack.)

"Natiijo ahaan xaalada Florida maadaama warka guuleystuhu uu qabsaday dhamaan gobolka, maxaa la guddoonsiiyay Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Dhammaan ergooyinka gobolka**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""Florida ayaa wada siisay kontonkeeda ergo Romney..."" which translates to ""Florida gave all of its electoral votes to Romney...""  The question asks what Romney gained as a *result* of winning Florida *and* taking all of its electoral votes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 32 ka mid ah ergooyinka gobolka:** New Gingrich received 32% of the vote, and that's not what Romney received.
*   **B: Magacaabista Xisbiga Jamhuuriga ah:**  The passage implies Romney was already the frontrunner, so winning Florida doesn't *name* him as the Republican nominee.
*   **D: 46 boqolkiiba codadka:** 46% represents the percentage of the vote he received in Florida, not what he gained as a result of winning the state.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Romney received all of Florida's electoral votes.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, boqolkiiba intee in le'eg ayuu Gingrich ka helay doorashadii hore?","The correct answer is **B: Boqolkiiba 32**.

The text explicitly states: ""Afhayeenkii hore Aqalka New Gingrich ayaa kaalinta labaad ku soo galay 32 boqolkiiba."" (Former House Speaker New Gingrich came in second place with 32 percent.)
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaan sii wadin ka qayb qaadashada tartanka kadib natiijooyinkii shirka xisbiga baarlamaanka?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The passage states: ""Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw poll in August, decided to end her campaign."" This directly indicates that Bachmann stopped participating in the race after the Iowa Caucus results.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Yaa si weyn uga hadlay musharrax kale kadib natiijada shirka xisbiga baarlamaanka?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Gingrich ayaa u hambalyaayay Santorum lakin hadal adag ku dhahay Romney..."" (Gingrich congratulated Santorum but spoke harshly to Romney...). This clearly indicates Gingrich spoke negatively about Romney after the Iowa caucuses.
"
Aaway meesha kaliya ee bandhigga lagu soo bandhigay ka hor 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""Maalmihiisa ugu horeeyay, barnaamijka wuxuu gabi ahaanba ka baxay mareegta intarneetka mudada dheer jirtay ee TogiNet Radio..."" This means the program was initially broadcast *on* TogiNet Radio. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the text doesn't mention those as locations where the program was broadcast before 2015.
"
Idaacada ayaa qeexaysa bandhiga noocee ayaa lafdhabarta u ah?,"The correct answer is **D: Maxaliga ah (Local)**.

The text states that AstroNet Radio was founded by a new voice from East Texas. This indicates the radio program focuses on local content and is likely geared towards a local audience.
"
Muxuu David Headley soo aruuriyay ee ugu dambeyntii ka caawiyay weerarka aay kuso qaadeen kooxda xagjirka ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Macluumaad (Information)**.

The passage states: ""Sahminta iyo war uruurinta David Headley ayaa kaalmeeyay hawlgalka..."" which translates to ""The intelligence gathering and reconnaissance by David Headley aided the operation...""

While the other options were *part* of the attack, the question specifically asks what Headley *gathered* that aided the attack. The passage indicates it was information.
"
Waa noocee nooca gaadiidka ah ee ay isticmaalayeen kooxda xagjirka ah si ay ugu so safraan Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Doon**.

The passage states: ""Weerareyaasha Mumbai ayaa ku imaaday **doon**..."" which translates to ""The Mumbai attackers arrived by **boat**...""
"
Qodobkee si sax ah uga turjumaya natiijada ciyaarti iska caadiga ahayd ee Brisbane ee aay ciyaareen Nadal iyo Raonic ee ku xusan tuduca?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal ayaa ka badiyay ama ka reeyay Raonic**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Nadal *won* against Raonic in Brisbane.
* The text also mentions Nadal winning 88% of the points. This is information about Nadal's performance, not the outcome of the match.
* Option A is incorrect because the text says Nadal won.
* Option B is incorrect because 88% of the points won is about Nadal, not Raonic.
* Option D is incorrect because 76 points are Nadal's score in the first set.

Therefore, the only option reflecting the match's outcome is that Nadal won.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Muxuu ahaa kala saraaynta cyaarta Nadal iyo Raonic kulankii koowaad kadib?","The correct answer is **C: Natiijadu waxay noqotay 7-2**

The question asks about the score of their first match. The text explicitly states ""Diwaan galinta Madax madax ee Nadal iska hor imaadkii Kanadiyaanka ayaa ahayd 7-2."" (The head-to-head record of Nadal's match against the Canadian was 7-2.)

While options A and B mention points, they don't represent the match score. Option D is incorrect because the text states Nadal won. Therefore, the score of the first match was 7-2.
"
Waa kuwee barnaamijka luqadd ee aan lagu darin saddexda warar ee bayaanka ah ee cusub ee hada la baahinaayo?,"The correct answer is **D: Isbaanish**.

The passage states they are adding programs in Spanish, Italian, and Korean.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Xagee laga heli doonin baahinta wararka bayaanka ah ee cusub?","The correct answer is **D: Telefishanka**.

The text states that Naked News will provide news through television, websites, and mobile devices. Therefore, television is one of the places where you can find the new news channels.
"
Immisa tartame ayaan dhammaysirin ciyaarta Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The text states: ""Afar kamida baraf-simbirixleyaasha doonyaha lugta oo kamid ahaa kooxda haweenka ayaa ku guuldaraystay inay dhamaystiraan orodkooda, 45 kamida 117 ka wadarka guud ee baraf-simbirixleyaasha ku sugnaa Giant Slalom ayaa ku guuldaraystay inay kaalin ka galaan tartarka.""

This directly indicates that 45 out of 117 athletes in the Giant Slalom failed to finish their run.
"
Keebaa bayaanada soo socda si sax ah uga tarjumaya natiijooyinka tartamada Horyaalada?,"The correct answer is **B: 45 kamid ah ciyaartooyda ciyaarta barafka a skier-ka ku tartama ayaa dhamaystirin tartankooda aay tartamaayeen ciyaarta Giant Slalom.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""45 kamida 117 ka wadarka guud ee baraf-simbirixleyaasha ku sugnaa Giant Slalom ayaa ku guuldaraystay inay kaalin ka galaan tartarka."" This translates directly to 45 out of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failing to finish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tartankii labaad, Carpenado waxaa uu kahor dhamaystay tartamaha barafka a skier-ka ee kaso jeeda Hungary:** The text says Carpenado finished *before* the Hungarian skier in the Giant Slalom, not after.
* **C: Dad badan oo skiers-ka ah ayaa dhammeeyay Giant Slalom marka loo eego tartanka Slalomka:**  The text indicates that many skiers *didn't* finish the Giant Slalom compared to the Slalom.
* **D: Carpenado wuxuu ku dhameystay kaalinta tobnaad ee tartanka Slalomka:** The text doesn't mention Carpenado finishing in 10th place in the Slalom. It only says she finished before the Hungarian skier.



"
Kuwan soo socda keebaa NBA go'aansatay inay hakiso ama aay joojiso?,"The correct answer is **A: Xili ciyaareedeeka kubbadda koleyga (Their basketball season)**.

The text explicitly states that the NBA *stopped* the basketball season due to COVID-19 concerns. While the Utah Jazz player's positive test was the trigger, the overall consequence was the suspension of the entire season.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa keenay welwelka NBA ee ku saabsan fayraska?","The correct answer is **D: Ciyaartooy u ciyaara Utah Jazz ayaa laga helay cudurka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Go’aanka NBA ayaa ka dambeeyey ciyaartooy Utah Jazz oo baaritaanka lagu xaqiijiyay inuu qabo viruska COVID-19."" This directly indicates that players on the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19, leading to the NBA's decision to halt the season.

While options A and C are related, option D is the most precise and directly supported by the text. Option B is also close but doesn't specify *who* was affected, making D a more accurate reflection of the information given.
"
Yaa u dhaliyay goolkii guusha Washington Capitals ciyaartii ay la ciyaareen Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Caawintii ugu horeysay ee Overchkin ee habeenka waxay ahayd tii goolkii guusha ciyaarta keenay uu dhaliyay Nicklas Backsrtom...""
"
Yaa dhaliyay goolkiisii ​​60-aad ee xilli ciyaareedkan intii uu socday kulankii u dhexeeyay Capitals iyoThrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""goolkiisa labaad ee habeenka ayaa ahaa midkiisa 60aad ee xiligaas, taasoo uu ku noqday ciyaaryahanka ugu horeeyo oo hal xili dhexdiisa ku xiro 60 gool ama ka badan ilaa 1995-96, markuu Jaromir Jagr iyo Mario Lemieux ay gaareen heerkaas.""
"
Goorma ayuu bangiga Northern Rock uga baahan yahay taageerada dawladda?,"The correct answer is **D: Xiligii aay taagnayd xiisaddii amaahda guryaha**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Northern Rock waxa ay u baahatay caawinaad sababto ah markee ku lug lahaate dhibaatadii dhaqaale ee 2007."" The financial difficulties of 2007 were primarily caused by the housing market crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kadib markii bangiga laga dhigay bangi qaran:** The text states the nationalization happened *after* the bank was already struggling.
*   **B: Marka bangiga laga dhex saaro shirkada maaraynta hantida:** The separation of the bank into ""good"" and ""bad"" Northern Rock plc happened *after* the nationalization, not as the reason for needing help.
*   **C: Kadib markii kooxda Virgin Group ay iibsadeen bangiga:** Virgin's offer was rejected *before* the nationalization.

"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa qodobada soo socda kamidd ah oo si sax ah u qeexaya Dhaqdhaqaaqa ganacsi ee kooxda Virgin Group ee aay la leeyihiin bangiga Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **D: Kooxda Virgin Group dalabkeedii ugu horeeyay ee bangiga waxa la sameeyay ka dib markii bangiga laga dhigay bangi qaran.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Mudane Richard Branson, Virgin Group-kiisa waxa ay codsi la diiday usoo direyn bangiga kahor inta aan bangiga la qarameyn."" This means Virgin's initial attempt to acquire Northern Rock was *before* the government intervention and nationalization.
* The text also states: ""Virgin waxay kaliya iibsatay ' bangiga wanaagsan’ ee Northern Rock , mana ahan shirkadda maareynta hantida."" This clarifies that Virgin *did* eventually acquire a part of Northern Rock, but not the entire entity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kooxda Virgin Group sidoo kale waxay iibsadeen shirkadda maamulka hantida ee Northern Rock** - The text explicitly states Virgin *did not* buy the asset management company.
* **B: Kooxda Virgin Group ayaa iibsatay bangiga ka dib markii bangiga laga dhigay bangi qaran** - The text clarifies Virgin's initial offer was *before* nationalization.
* **C: Kooxda Virgin Group waxay siisay bangiga taageerada degdega ah Xiligii aay taagnayd xiisaddii amaahda guryaha** - The text mentions the government providing emergency aid, not Virgin.



"
"Sida ku xusan tuduca, qarankee ayuu saameeyaa saxiixa heshiiska cimilada ee Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: Maraykanka**.

The passage explicitly states that the US is the only developed nation that will *not* ratify the Kyoto agreement, and therefore the decision is singling them out.
"
Dawladdii hore ee Australia maxey u malaynaysay in ansixinta heshiiska cimilada ee Kyoto ay waxyeello u keeni doonto?,"The correct answer is **B: Dhaqaalaha wadanka**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dawladii hore konsarfatifka ahayd ee Ustareeliya ayaa diiday inay ansixiso Kyoto, iyadoo sheegtay inuu dhaawacayo dhaqaalaha maadaama ay si wayn ugu tiirsan tahay dhoofinta dhuxusha...""

Therefore, the Australian government believed that ratifying the Kyoto agreement would harm the country's economy.
"
Barnaamijkee ayaa toogasha yaqaanada safka kujir looso shaqaaleeyay?,"The correct answer is **D: Barnaamijka isboortiga ugaarsiga ee Ururka toogasha yaqaanada**.

The text states: ""Wadashaqeynta NPWS iyo ururka difaaca Isboortiga ee Australiya (NSW) Inc, mutadawiciin xirfadleyaal ah ayaa laga shaqaaleysiiyay, **barnaamijka ugaarsiga ururka difaaca isboortiga**.""
"
Qodobkee ayaan si sax ah uga tarjumeynin tijaabada xakamaynta cayayaanka?,"The correct answer is **A: Maadaama ay ahayd tijaabadii ugu horreysay ee barnaamijka, wax qiimayn ah laguma samaynin.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""int a la indho indheynayo tijaabada lana ogaanayo qiimaha wax galgeeda."" This translates to ""while monitoring the trial and determining the cost of investment."" This implies an evaluation *will* be done, not that none was done because it was the first trial.

Let's look at why the other options are correct translations from the text:

* **B: Toogasha yaqaanadu waxay heleen tilmaamo tababareed:** The passage says ""habraac amaana iyo tababar"" (safe handling and training), which is accurately translated as ""tilmaamo tababareed"" (training instructions).
* **C: Dadka toogasha yaqaanadu ayaa waxaa ilaalinayay ilaalada beerta xanaanada xayawaanada:** The passage states that the four rangers were tasked with ""xabad ridida hore"" (pre-emptive shooting) within the scope of the Sports Conservation Group program.  While not explicitly stated they were *protecting* the wildlife park, it's a reasonable inference given the context of controlling a cayayaan (invasive species).
* **D: Afar qof oo Toogasha yaqaan ah ayaa la doortay:** The passage clearly states ""afarta dabley ee loo doortay"" (the four rangers who were chosen).

Therefore, option A is the only one that contradicts information directly presented in the passage.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, halkee ayaa kala go’itaanka ama kala dilaaca lagu arkay?","The correct answer is **B: Qalfoofka dushiisa ama fosilka (Fossil)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iyada oo ku salebana lafahii hore, taasi micnaheedu waa kala qeybsanaanta waa ay ka horeysaa sidii la filaayay caddeynta moodeelka. Taasi micneheedu waxay tahay wax walbo waa in dib loo celiyo.” This refers to the discovery of fossils. The idea is that the fossils provide evidence that the separation happened *before* the model was expected, implying that the fossils themselves are the evidence of this earlier separation.

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

*   **A: Waadiga weeyn (Large valley):** The passage doesn't mention a large valley.
*   **C: Caddaymaha molekuulka (Molecular evidence):** While molecular evidence *can* be used in this type of research, the passage specifically references ""lafahii hore"" (early life) and ""fosilka"" (fossils), making fossils the more direct answer.
*   **D: Dalka Itoobiya (Country of Ethiopia):** The passage mentions the researcher is in Ethiopia, but the focus is not on the location.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa dhacay isla markiiba oo si lama filaan ah ku dhacay?","The correct answer is **B: Kala qaybsanaanta ama dilaaca (Fragmentation or breakage)**.

The quote explicitly states: ""Iyada oo ku saleysan lafahii hore, taasi micnaheedu waa kala qeybsanaanta waa ay ka horeysaa sidii la filaayay caddeynta moodeelka. Taasi micneheedu waa wax walbo waa in dib loo celiyo.”  This directly translates to ""Based on the remains, which means fragmentation comes before the expected evidence of the model. This means everything has to be rethought.""

Therefore, the unexpected event described is **fragmentation or breakage** of the remains.
"
Muxuu u baahan doonaa ciyaartoygu inuu sameeyo si uu u maamulo dhaqdhaqaaqa inta lagu jiro ciyaarta fiidyaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Saddex-geesood ka dhig booska aay ku suganyihiin.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the new controller uses ""two motion sensors close to the player"" and involves ""moving the air device."" This implies the player needs to hold the controller in a specific position, likely with their hands, to control the game.
* Option B directly reflects this by suggesting the player should position their hands near the controller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hubi in kontoroolka laga maamulo ciyaarta uu ku yaalo meel u dhow qaybta shaashada laga fiirsanaayo ciyaarta:** While proximity is likely helpful, the passage doesn't emphasize *that* specifically.
* **C: Waxaad dhigta gacanka ciyaarta mel u dhaw telefishankooda:** This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Ku wareeji koontaroolaha hawada adiga oo kor u yara qaadaayo:** The passage focuses on *holding* the controller in a position, not lifting it.



"
Waa maxay waxa loo naqshadeeyay inuu u ekaado sida hagaha telefishinka?,"The correct answer is **A: Labada hagayaal ee uu leeyahay koontaroolaha**.

The text states: ""Dib u soo celinta ramuudka tifiga, maamulaha waxaa loo isticmala laba dareen wade oo u dhaw isticmalaha tifiga saddex gesoodka booska sadex cabirka banana."" This translates to: ""Reviving the controller's layout, the controller uses two motion sensors close to the player's thumb.""  This means the controller has two *motion sensors* which are part of the controller's design and are used for motion control.  The question asks what is designed to *look like* the TV remote, and the text points to the motion sensors as the key feature being described.
"
Waa maxay waxa aan lagu sheegin warbixintii ugu dambeysay ee ka soo baxday wakaaladda wararka ee Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Diyaaradda ayaa loogu hanjabay in la qarxini doono** (The plane was threatened with bombing).

Here's why:

The question asks what the *latest* report from Xinhua News Agency *didn't* mention. The provided text states the latest reports say the plane was threatened with bombing. Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Diyaaradda ayaa ku caga dhigatay Ürümqi** - The text says it was *sent back* to Afghanistan after refusing to land in Ürümqi, not that it landed there.
* **C: Diyaaradda ayaa loo weeciyay dhinaca dalka Afgaanistaan** - The text says it was *crashed* in Kandahar, Afghanistan.
* **D: Diyaaradda ayaa ku caga dhigatay Kandahar** - The text says it was *crashed* in Kandahar, Afghanistan.



"
Waa maxay waxa aan lagu sheegin warbixintii ugu horreysay ee wakaaladda cusub ee Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: Diyaaradda ayaa la afduubay (The plane was hijacked)**.

The question asks what was *not* mentioned in the *first* report from Xinhua News Agency. The first report stated the plane was hijacked. The later reports added details about the threats, the diversion, and the landing.
"
Maxa ay ku dhawaaqday Sara Danius inta lagu guda jiray barnaamijka raadiyaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ku Guuleystay Abaalmarinta Nobel prize-ka Ee Suugaanta**.

The passage states Sara Danius announced the committee couldn't directly contact Bob Dylan regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature.  The question asks what she announced *during* the radio program. The context implies she was discussing the Nobel Prize itself.  While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they aren't the main announcement she made during the radio program.
"
Yaa awood loo yeelani waayay in la xiriiro?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The text states that the Swedish Academy, represented by Sara Danius, was unable to directly contact Bob Dylan regarding the Nobel Prize.
"
"""Yaa ka faallooday ballanqaadku inuu yahay """"tallaabo weyn""""?""","The correct answer is **B: George W. Bush**.

The question asks who announced the promise was a ""major step."" The text states that ""Afhayen madaxweyne Bush"" (President Bush's spokesperson) Gordon Johndroe made the statement. Therefore, George W. Bush is the one who made the statement about the promise being a ""major step.""
"
Imisaa tiinbaro ayuu Slania uu uso saaray wadamada kala duwan?,"The correct answer is **A: In ka badan 2,000**.

The text states: ""Wuxuu usoo saaray ilaa 1,000 calaamad boosto Sweden iyo 28 uu usoo saaray wadamo kale.""  This translates to ""He issued up to 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 for other countries."" 

1,000 (Sweden) + 28 (other countries) = 1,028. The phrase ""ilaa 1,000"" means ""up to 1,000"". It doesn't mean *exactly* 1,000.  The text also mentions his 1000th stamp series was recognized.  Since he issued stamps for other countries as well, the total is *in ka badan* (more than) 2,000.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay sababta ay u badan tahay in ay sababtay in tuubada taangiga aay siiwado siidaaynta biyaha?","The correct answer is **B: Tijaabada joogtada ah ee nidaamka lagu mareeynayo dabka (Regular testing of the system with fire).**

Here's why:

* The passage states the failure occurred during a ""regular testing of the fire suppression system."" This directly links the fire testing to the subsequent problems with the tanks.
* The failure of the regular testing system caused the fire suppression to activate, leading to the tanks rupturing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aaga loo isticmalo kaydinta biyaha baylaha ah ayaa loo buuxinayaa si mug leh (The area used for storing firefighting water is being filled massively):** The passage doesn't mention the firefighting water storage being filled.
* **C: Balaadhinta kulaylka (Heat expansion):** While heat expansion *can* cause problems, the passage points to the *testing* of the fire suppression system as the immediate cause. Heat expansion might be a contributing factor *after* the system failed, but it's not the primary reason for the initial rupture.
* **D: Dab ka kacay mid ka mid ah saldhigyada bamka ee Fort Greely (A fire broke out at one of the bomb depots at Fort Greely):** The passage states the *fire suppression system* activated, implying a fire within the tanks themselves, not a separate fire at Fort Greely.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Waa maxay sababta loo furay mareenada lagu xakameeyo cadaadiska hawada?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxaa jiray balaadhin kuleyl ah oo ka dhacaayo gudaha taangiyada (There was steam buildup inside the tanks)**.

The passage states that the failure of the normal pressure relief test caused the tanks to burst open. This implies that pressure had built up inside the tanks, likely due to steam. Option A directly reflects this cause.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Waxaa jiray cilad koronto ka dib tijaabada nidaamka (There was an electrical fault after the system test)** While an electrical fault *could* contribute to problems, the passage focuses on the pressure relief system failure as the primary cause.
* **C: Taangiyada waxay ahaayeen kuwo buuxa (The tanks were full)** The passage mentions that one tank was still partially full, and another was *under* capacity, so being full wasn't the direct cause of the bursting.
* **D: Goobta labaad ee loo adeegsado kaydinta ayaa hayn kari wayday foostooyin ku filan (The second storage site couldn't hold enough barrels)** This is irrelevant to the reason the tanks burst open. It describes a separate storage issue.



"
"Hadda, intee la’eg bay sarreeyaan biyaha Qaybta Sagaalaad?","The correct answer is **D: Dhererka 100 fiit**.

The text states: ""Biyaha ka soo dadanayo buurta qeybta dhirir keedu yahay 100 talaabo."" This translates to ""The water flowing from the hill is 100 steps.""  Since each step is assumed to be roughly 6 inches (as mentioned in the first sentence), 100 steps is approximately 100 * 6 = 600 inches, which is equal to 50 feet. However, since the question asks for the height of the water *currently* in the Ninth Ward, and the passage states the water is ""ilaa miskaha"" (up to the porch) and the water flow is 100 steps, the 100 steps is the relevant measurement of the water height. While the initial amount of water was up to 20 feet, the current standing water in the Ninth Ward is described as being up to the porch, and the flow is 100 steps from the hill. Thus, 100 steps (or approximately 50 feet) is the best answer, and option D, ""Dhererka 100 fiit"" (Length of 100 feet) is the closest and most reasonable interpretation of the information provided, even though the math isn't perfectly aligned.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dhererka 20 fiit** - This refers to the initial flood depth during Hurricane Katrina, not the current standing water.
*   **B: 6 inji** - This refers to the amount of water that could be released, and not the current depth.
*   **C: Dheerarka ila moxoga** - This translates to ""length to the sky"", which is not a reasonable measurement.



"
"Intii lagu jiray Hurricane Katrina, maxaa ka dhacay Qaybta Sagaalaad?","The correct answer is **B: Biyihi dheerarku u gaarsiisnaa ila moxoga ayaa ka sare maray biyo dhigaalki loogu talagalay in lagu xakameeyo daadadka.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Degmada Ninth Ward ,taasoo la kulanatay fatahaad ilaa 20 cagood ah intii lagu jiray Duufaantii Katrina..."" This directly addresses what happened in the Ninth Ward during Katrina.
* The text further mentions: ""...Biyuhu hadda u joogaan ilaa miskaha maadaama biyo fadhiisinka ku dhawaa fatahay."" This implies the floodwaters rose to a significant height, exceeding the levees.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Biyaha daadku waxay ballac aay ahaayeen 100 fiit:** The text mentions a 100-foot high *wave* from the levee breach, not the overall flood extent.
* **C: Biyaha daadku waxay ahaayeen 20 fiit:** While the text mentions a 20-foot flood, it doesn't specify that this was the height in the Ninth Ward.
* **D: 6 inji oo biyaha roobka ah ayaa jebiyey biyo dhigaalki waxyeelaysnaa ee loogu talagalay in lagu xakameeyo daadadka:** This describes the damage to the levees, not what happened in the Ninth Ward itself.



"
Kuwan soo socda keebaa aanu xaqiijin Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **B: Suurtagalnimada in bukaannada kale ay qaadaan fayraska (The possibility of other patients contracting the virus).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Isbitaalku wuxuu raacay sharciga lagu maamulo infakshanka, iyadoo ay ku jirto kala saarida bukaanada kuwa kale lagaga hor tagayo suurta galnimada infakshanka kale."" This confirms that the hospital took measures to prevent the spread of Ebola to *other* patients.
* **The passage confirms:** Hamilton confirmed the patient was brought in after being treated for Ebola in Nigeria.
* **The passage confirms:** Hamilton confirmed the patient's current stable condition.
* **The passage confirms:** The hospital followed infection control protocols.

Therefore, option B is the one that wasn't explicitly confirmed by Hamilton. The hospital's actions indicate they *were* concerned about preventing spread, but the passage doesn't state that Hamilton specifically confirmed the *possibility* of other patients contracting the virus.  It only states that they took precautions.



"
Waa maxay waxa ay saynisyahannadu ay doonayaan inay ogaadaan?,"The correct answer is **B: Sida borotiinada loo sameeyaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists are trying to understand how the rocks formed, and how the ""duunka"" (which likely refers to the building blocks or components) were formed, especially since these rocks are from a time when the Earth was forming.  The passage also mentions that these rocks contain proteins. Therefore, the scientists are interested in understanding how proteins are made.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Marka uu shayga yar ee ka samaysan barafka ee loo yaqaano comet-ka aay isku dhacaan dhulka** (When a small icy object called a comet crashes into the Earth) - This is a detail mentioned in the context of the rocks' origin, but not the main question the scientists are trying to answer.
*   **C: Waxa aay tahay maadada organic-ka** (What is organic matter) - While the rocks contain organic matter, the focus is on the protein structure, not just the existence of organic matter.
*   **D: Sida dhulka loo sameeyay** (How the Earth was formed) - The scientists are focusing on the specific rocks and their components, not the formation of the entire Earth.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, door intee le'eg ayuu booliiska deegaanka ka qaatay xidhitaanka?","The correct answer is **B: Waxay goʼaansadeen inay xidhitaanka sameeyaan**.

The passage states: ""Iyadoo maamulku aanu hubin run ahaanshaha jiritaanka khatarta, Maamulka Gaadiidka Maryland ayaa xirista dhaqangelista ka dib markii ay FBI ku boorisay sidaas."" This indicates that the Maryland Transportation Authority *decided* to close the highway *after* being prompted by the FBI. The phrasing ""ka dib markii ay FBI ku boorisay sidaas"" implies the decision to close the highway was theirs, not solely based on the FBI's suggestion. The subsequent details about cutting barriers and deploying police further support the idea that they took action.
"
Maxaa ku dhacay galitaanada tubada intii ay xirnaayeen?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxaay ahaayeen kuwa xidhan (They were locked).**

The text states: ""Iskarogooyin ayaa lagu gooyay iridda laga galo dhuunta waxaana diyaar ahaa 80 booliis taageero ah oo baabuurleyda ah ku hagayay meelahay ka weecanayaan."" This implies that the entrances were locked to prevent access. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the provided text.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa aan dhicin ka hor inta uusan sawirqaaduhu gaadhigu ku dhicin?","The correct answer is **B: Sawir qaaduhu wuxuu gaarigiisa dhigtay ama uu ku baakinmtay hareeraha Sepulveda Boulevard.**

The text states: ""TMZ news sites understand that the photographer pulled over his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard after trying to take pictures of the police station without crossing the street, which led to California Highway Patrol officers who were at the station ordering him to return to the station, twice.""

This clearly indicates he stopped his car near the police station. Options A and C are related to the consequences of stopping, but not the initial event *before* the crash. Option D is incorrect as the text doesn't say he was trying to photograph Bieber.
"
Muxuu ahaa waxa uu sawir qaaduhu isku dayey inuu sameeyo ka hor inta aanu gaadhigu uu ku dhicin ama jiidhin?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka qaad sawiro goobta ay booliisku ku sugnaanyihiin**.

The text states: ""TMZ entertainment news sites understand that the photographer pulled over his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and then tried to take pictures of the police station without crossing the street, and then continue."" This directly indicates he was trying to take pictures of the police station.
"
Bayaankee ayaa si sax ah aan u sharaxaynin xaaladda madaxweynaha kadib markii laga helay fayraska?,"The correct answer is **A: Xaaladiisa caafimahad ma ahayn mid wanaagsan**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Xaalada madaxeynaha waa mid dagan"" which translates to ""The President's condition is stable.""
* **Option A says the condition is *not* good**, which directly contradicts the information provided in the text.
* **Option B** mentions ""cuno xanuun"" (stomach ache) and ""nabarro kaso baxeen"" (vomiting), which are mentioned as symptoms, but it doesn't accurately summarize the overall condition.
* **Option C** correctly states he is in a stable condition.
* **Option D** (Waxaa hayso qandho - He has a cough) is not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, only option A presents a description that is *not* supported by the provided information.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa run ah bayaanadan soo socda ee ku saabsan madaxweynaha?","The correct answer is **C: Waxaa uu awood buuxdo u leeyahay inuu isticmaalo isgaarsiin.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""waan fiicnahay shaqadaydana qaab masaafeed baan u qabsan karaa."" (I am well and can continue working remotely.) This clearly indicates he has the ability to use communication tools to work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wax qandho ah ma haayso ama ma qawo (He has no serious or severe symptoms):** The text mentions ""Marka laga tago xummad iyo cuno xanuun..."" (Except for fever and stomach pain...), implying he *does* have some symptoms.
* **B: Waxa uu joogi doonaa guriga dhowr toddobaad (He will stay home for several weeks):** The text says he will be in quarantine ""dhowr malmood"" (a few weeks), not several weeks.
* **D: Waxa uu ku suganyahay xaalad aad u daran oo uu ku keenay fayraska (He is in a very serious condition and contracted the virus himself):**  The text states his condition is ""dagan"" (stable), not serious. It also doesn't say he contracted the virus himself.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayaa la filayey in duufaanta kulaylaha Gonu ay sii daciifto ama aay sii yaraato?","The correct answer is **B: Marka dabaylaha ay hoos u dhacaan ilaa 83 kiilomitir saacadiiba.**

The text states: ""...dabeelaha ayaa ku socdeen xoog 83 kilomiitar saacadii, iyadoo la filanaayo inay sii daciifto."" This directly indicates that the weakening is expected *when* the winds drop to 83 km/h.
"
Sida ugu dhakhsa badnayd dabaylaha ku socday meesha ugu sarreysa duufaanta kulaylaha Gonu ?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kiilomitir saacadiiba**.

The text states the tornado reached 240 kilometers per hour, and the question asks for the *fastest* speed the *dableelaha* (which is the tornado) reached.  It also provides the conversion to miles per hour (149 mph). Since 240 km/h is equal to 149 mph, and 240 km/h is the higher speed mentioned, 149 mph is also the fastest speed.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan loo tixgelin inuu yahay sifada uu leeyahay Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: Waa mid unugyo badan leh (It is multicellular)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Karenia brevis, arrin dabiiciya ee noole **hal unugle** oo badda ku nool"" which translates to ""Karenia brevis, a natural entity that is **unicellular** and lives in the sea.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waa nooc ka mid ah gufurka ama laweenta biyaha saarmo (It is a type of algae or water-based seaweed):** The text indicates it's a natural entity, and while not explicitly called algae, its behavior and impact align with algal blooms.
* **B: Waxay curyaami kartaa neerfaha bini'aadamka (It can sting human nerves):** The text mentions it produces a toxin that affects human and fish nerves.
* **D: Waxay u dhacdaa si dabiici ah (It occurs naturally):** The text states it's a natural entity, and its blooms occur naturally due to favorable conditions.



Therefore, the only statement that *doesn't* align with the information provided in the text is that it's multicellular. It's definitively unicellular."
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo uu Karena brevis uusan awoodin inuu sameeyo?,"The correct answer is **B: Si degdeg ah u kordhaayo tirada ahaan xaalad kasta (Rapidly multiply in any situation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Karenia brevis thrives in favorable conditions.** It doesn't say it can multiply *rapidly in *any* situation*.  There are likely environmental factors that still limit its growth, even if it's prone to blooms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Neerfaha aan shaqaynaynin ee kalluunka (Non-functioning gills in fish):** The passage explicitly says that the toxins produced by Karenia brevis damage the gills of both humans and fish.
* **C: Saamee biyaha (Affect the water):** The passage clearly states that Karenia brevis produces toxins that affect water quality.
* **D: So saar sunta burburisa neerfaha unugyada (Produce toxins that damage tissue gills):** The passage states that Karenia brevis produces toxins that damage gills.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan u dhicin natiijada duufaanta Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: Daadadka waddooyinka**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""aan wax dhaawacyo ama daadad ah aan la soo werin."" (no injuries or flooding have been reported).
* The passage mentions rain, hail, and lightning, and the rain was described as ""beneficial.""
* The passage does mention hail accompanying the storm.

Therefore, flooding is *not* listed as something that occurred as a result of Hurricane Felicia according to the text.



"
Bayaankee ku saabsan Duufaanta Felicia ayaa been ah oo aan sax ahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Roobabka ka dhashay ayaay ka faa'iidaysatay Oahu**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Roob, gaadhayay 6.34 inji markii la cabbiray oo Oahu ku hooray, ayaa lagu qeexay inuu """"faaiido"""" leeyahay."" This means the rain *benefitted* Oahu, not that it *exploited* it. The word ""faaiido"" in Somali translates to ""benefit.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Waxa markii kowaad loo kala saaray in aay tahay kulayl niyad-jab ka hor inta aanay isu rogin duufaanta Qaybta 4:** The text states Felicia *was* a Category 4 hurricane, not that it was initially mistaken for a heatwave.
* **C: Inta badan jasiiradaha waxaa ka dhacay walxaha cirka ka imaada sida roobk iyo barafka:**  While rain is common, the text says the rain was unusual (6.34 inches) and that the hurricane had associated thunderstorms and tornadoes, not just typical rain and snow. Snow isn't typically associated with hurricanes in Hawaii.
* **D: Roobabka qaar ayaa waxaa weheliyay oo la socday hillaac:** The text confirms this: ""Qaar ka mida roobka ayaa waxa la socday duufano iyo hilaacyo joogta.""



"
Bayaankee si sax ah uga tarjumaysa natiijada Hungarian Grand Prix ee 2009?,"The correct answer is **C: Piquet Jr. ayaa markii dambe la eryay (Piquet Jr. was later fired).**

The text explicitly states that Piquet Jr. was fired after the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Goorma ayuu shilku dhacay?,"The correct answer is **A: Isla markiiba kadib marki gaariga Alonso la joojiyay halka gaariga tartamaha lagu hagaajiyo**.

The text explicitly states that Piquet Jr. crashed *immediately after* Fernando Alonso was forced to retire, triggering the safety car.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwa soo socda kee baa qaatay wakhti ka yar intii ay cilmi-baarayaashu markii hore aay rumaysnaayeen?","The correct answer is **A: Samaaynta noocyada sinjiyada (The creation of the new species)**.

Here's why:

* The text states the new species are affecting only two generations, and while the process *could* take a long time, the impact is happening *faster* than what scientists initially expected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka warbixinta noocyada sinjiyada (Reporting the new species):** This is simply the act of documenting the discovery and wouldn't take a significant amount of time.
* **C: Taranka u dhexeeya noocyada kala duwan ee sinjiyada (Interbreeding between different species of finches):** While interbreeding can occur, the text doesn't specifically mention it as the rapid change.
* **D: Taadawurka ku dhaca noocyada sinjiyada (Evolution of the finches):** This is a general term and the text specifies the *creation* of new species as the surprising element.



"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda ee aysan cilmi-baarayaashu soo sheegin?,"The correct answer is **C: Magaca sinjiyada cusub**.

Here's why:

* The text states the scientists discovered *new types* of finches but doesn't explicitly name them.
* The text mentions the finches' evolutionary connection to Darwin's finches and the cactus kaktus.
* The text does discuss the two generations involved in the evolutionary process (option B).
* The text names the two finch species involved: *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza konirostris* (option D).

Therefore, the scientists didn't provide the names of the new finch species in the article.
"
Xagee ka dhici doontaa munaasabada fanka dadweynaha ee CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Magaalada Bucharest**.

The text states: ""Magalada waxa ay noqon doonta midii koonfur bari Yurub ugu horeyse in ay qabato CowParade..."" which indicates Bucharest is the first city in Southeast Europe to host it. The first sentence also focuses on Bucharest City Hall's efforts.
"
Keebaa weedhahan soo socda si sax ah u qeexaya munaasabada fanka dadweynaha ee CowParade?,"The correct answer is **C: Waa munaasabad faneed taas oo lagu qabtay xagaaga Guud ahaan koonfurta bari ee Yurub.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...Magalada waxa ay noqon doonta midii koonfur bari Yurub ugu horeyse in ay qabato CowParade, bandhiga ugu weyn ee fanka, inta udhaxeysa June iyo August sanadkan."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxay ka dhacdaa oo kaliya magaalooyinka loo arko in aay yihiin kuwo “hal abuur leh”** The passage doesn't limit the event to only innovative cities. It highlights Bucharest's effort to revitalize its image.
* **B: Waxaa abuuray ee sameeyay hoolka magaalada Bucharest** The passage doesn't mention who created CowParade.
* **D: Waa dhacdadii ugu ballaarneyd ee fanka dadweynaha adduunka** The passage calls it ""bandhiga ugu weyn ee fanka"" but doesn't definitively state it's the largest globally.



"
Maxaa sababay in Ruushku uu joojiyo isticmaalka II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Shilka**.

The text states the Il-76 experienced a dangerous accident in October and that Russia subsequently grounded its Il-76s. This directly links the reason for halting use to the accident. While the other options mention related elements, the accident is the *direct* cause mentioned in the passage.
"
Waa maxay II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: Diyaarad (Airplane)**.

The text explicitly states that the Il-76 was a major part of the Russian and Soviet militaries and refers to it as a ""diyaarad"" in Somali, which translates to airplane.
"
Yaa shaqaaleysiiyay kooxda qoraayaasha ah ee Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

The text states: ""Sanadka 1989 wuxuu ka caawiyey sameynta Simpsons Brooks iyo Groening waxay masuul ka ahaayeen shaqaleysiinta qoraha barnaamijka ugu horeya kooxda."" This translates to: ""In 1989 he helped create The Simpsons Brooks and Groening were responsible for hiring the first writing staff of the show.""
"
"Sida laga soo xigtay Fluke, yaa soo diri jiray ayada faallooyinka wanaagsan iyo dhiirigelinta?","The correct answer is **D: Shakhsiyaadyada lab iyo dhedig labadaba (Men and women)**.

The passage states: ""way gaartay go’aankan kadib markay heshay fikrado wanaagsan oo ay ku dhiiro galiyeen rag iyo dumarba kulana talinayya daawooyinka ka hor taga uurka in laga dhigo daawooyin muhim u ah caafimaadka."" This translates to ""she reached this conclusion after getting good ideas and encouraging both men and women to consult doctors before getting pregnant about taking medications important for women's health.""



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay dadka qaarkiis aay u diidaan in dumarku ay si fiican wax walbo uga hadlaan?","The correct answer is **A: Shakhsiyaadka ragga ah (Men)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Fuluuk observed that ""dedaalada qaaar ugu jiraan inay ku qariyaan dhawaqa dumarka ee ku aaddan caafimaadka dumarku ay guuldarraysteen"" which translates to ""external efforts to conceal the voice of women regarding women's health have failed.""  The passage then goes on to say she was inspired to encourage men and women to consult doctors and take necessary medications *before* getting pregnant.

This implies that men are the ones trying to suppress or ignore women's voices and concerns about their health. The passage directly links the failed efforts to ""external efforts"" which, in this context, are being attributed to men.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, qaybaha merayaasha keebaa ugu firfircoon?","The correct answer is **A: Dhulka (Earth)**.

The passage states: ""Sida aan ka war heyno, waxaa jiro keliya jir mere kaas oo muujinayo firfircooni badan oo kala duwan marka loo eego Titan, magaciisuna waa Dhul."" This translates to: ""As we know, there is only one body that shows such a wide variety of activity compared to Titan, its name is Earth.""

Therefore, the Earth (Dhul) is presented as the most active body.
"
Waa maxay nooca meeraha oo ka kooban dareere hufan ayaa laga helay webiyada iyo harooyinka?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan-ka**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""... waxaa jiro keliya jir mere kaas oo muujinayo firfircooni badan oo kala duwan marka loo eego Titan, magaciisuna waa Dhul.”  This translates to ""...there is only a rock body that shows great activity and diversity compared to Titan, its name is Earth.”  

The question asks about a rock body composed of fluid material found in rivers and seas. Earth is the only body mentioned that fits this description in the context of the passage.
"
Maxaa ka mid ah natiijooyinkan aan ahayn natiijada laga helay baaritaanka lagu sameeyay baalasha?,"The correct answer is **C: Aragtida dhabta ah ee Taadawurka ku dhaca baalasha**.

Here's why:

* **A: Midabka lakabka baalasha qurxoon ee xayawaanka** - The text explicitly states that scientists believe the skin color was likely brownish or open/red, so this *is* a result of the research.
* **B: Fahamka ah in baalasha aan loo isticmaalin duulimaadka ama buubitaanka** - The text clearly states that the wing structure suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. This *is* a result of the research.
* **C: Aragtida dhabta ah ee Taadawurka ku dhaca baalasha** - The text *doesn't* provide a ""true picture"" of the evolution of wings. It proposes theories and suggests possible evolutionary paths (from gliding to something else), but it doesn't offer a definitive, ""true picture"" of how wings evolved.
* **D: Xaqiijinta in xayawaanada qiroweyn badankooda ay lahaayeen baalal** - The text focuses on a specific dinosaur and doesn't make a general claim about most reptiles having wings.

Therefore, the only option that wasn't a direct result of the wing research is the ""true picture"" of wing evolution.



"
Waa maxay waxa aan baalasha xayawaanka qiroweyn uusan lahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Garabyada baalasha**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maadaama baalasha dhaynasooradu aanay lahayn dacallo si fiican u samaysan, ee loo yaqaan raajis, balse ay leeyiin qaabab kale - baarbis iyo baarbaluus- cilmi baadhayaashu waxay sheegeen in raajiska laga yaabo inuu ahaa mid dib uga soo sameysmay qaababkaas hore.""

This means dinosaur wings didn't have the same well-developed structures as bird wings, specifically the ""raajis"" (the part that creates the downstroke).  The text then goes on to say the wing structures (baarbis and baarbaluus) *suggest* they weren't used for flight, but possibly for temperature regulation or display.

Therefore, the wings lacked the **garabyada baalasha** (the downstroke mechanism/structures). The other options are not mentioned as lacking.



"
Keebaa weedhaha soo socda ee ku saabsan ZMapp aan run ahayn?,"The correct answer is **A: Waxay ka samaysan tahay unugyada difaaca jirka** (It is made of immune cells).

Here's why:

* The passage states that ZMapp is a monoclonal antibody *cocktail* (isku darka halka antibody). Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system, not immune cells themselves.
* Options B, C, and D are all directly supported by the information in the passage.

Therefore, the statement that ZMapp is made of immune cells is the incorrect one.
"
Teeba ka mid ah bayaanada soo socda oo si sax ah u qeexaya tijaabada PALM?,"The correct answer is **B: Daawada xakamaynta waxaa lala barbar dhigay saddex daaweyn oo kale, oo mid ka mid ah uu ahaa ZMapp.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Bilowgi PALM, ZMapp waxay u shaqeysay maamul ahaan, micnaheeduna waa saynis yahanadu waxay u isticmaalaan aas asas ahaan si la isu bar bar dhigo saddexda dhaqan ee kale."" (Starting with PALM, ZMapp worked as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline to compare three other treatments.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Daraasaduhu waxay muujiyeen in laga yaabo inay leedahay faa'iidooyin ka badan kuwii hore loo maleynayay:** The text doesn't mention any new findings about the benefits of the trial.
* **C: ZMapp ayaa waxa loo adeegsaday gundhigga tijaabada:** While ZMapp *was* used as a control, the text emphasizes it was a *baseline* for comparison, not the primary control.
* **D: Waxaa la muujiyey oo la cadeeyay in ay waxtar u leedahay daaweynta xaaladaha jira:** The text states that ZMapp *didn't* show effectiveness in the trial. It was being compared to other treatments.



"
Halkee ayay cilmi-baarayaashu u maleynayaan in qaybta jabka yar ee cusub uu noqon doono kan ugu muhiimsan?,"The correct answer is **A: Wadamada dakhligoodu hooseeyo (Low-income countries)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...macquul ah in lagu soo saro Mareykan ka mid walba. Hogaamiyaasha cilmi barista waxay sheegen tani in ay hor seedi karto lagu ogaan karo xanuunka kansarka, xanuunka sanbabada HIV ga iyo bukaanada duumadawadama dhaqaalahooda hooseya, halkaas oo ay heerka samata baxa xanuunada sida kansarka ku dhaca nasahaaso u dhigmeysa qeyb un marka loo barbar dhigo wadamada qaniga ah.""

This translates to: ""...it is likely to be released in the US. The leading researchers said this could advance the detection of cancer pain, AIDS pain, and pain in low-income patients, where the level of pain relief, such as cancer pain in the nasopharynx, is adjusted to a part un when compared to wealthy countries.""

Therefore, the researchers believe the tiny drug delivery part will be most important for low-income countries.
"
Qaabkee loo isticmaali doonaa si loo hagaajiyo qalabka loo adeegsado ogaanshaha ama baaritaanka?,"The correct answer is **C: Chips-ka la daabici karo (Printable Chips)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the new devices are ""tiny"" and ""can be produced on a mass scale.""  Printable chips are a technology that allows for the creation of small, inexpensive electronic components that can be mass-produced using inkjet printing techniques. This aligns perfectly with the description in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Midkiiba hal senti oo lacagta maraykanka ah (One cent each):** While the goal is affordability, this doesn't specify *how* the device will be made. Printable chips are a key technology to achieve that low cost.
*   **B: Madbacadaha inkjet-ka ee caadiga ah (Ordinary inkjet printers):**  While inkjet printing is involved in creating the chips, the chips themselves are more sophisticated than just what a typical inkjet printer produces.
*   **D: Qalabka kale ee loo adeegsado in waxa lagu ogaado ama lagu baaro (Other equipment used for diagnosis or scanning):** This is too general. The passage is specifically about a *new* device made with printable chips, not existing diagnostic equipment.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, bayaankee ku saabsan dilaacyada lobate-ka ee dayaxa ayan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **C: Waxay noqoni karaan natiijo ka dhalatay dayaxu sii yaraanayo.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the lobate structures appear to have formed from the ice and then gradually diminished. This suggests that the lobate structures are a result of the ice receding or melting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhacdooyinka keenay dilaacyada lobate-ka in aay dhaco waxay u badan tahay inay dhowaan dhaceen** - The passage says they *gradually diminished*, implying they didn't happen recently, but over a period of time.
* **B: Jiritaankooda waxay ka dhigan tahay in dayaxu aanu ka maqnayn dhaqdhaqaaqa juqraafiyeed** - While the structures *do* indicate geological activity, the passage's main point is about the ice's behavior *in response* to geological activity (its melting and receding).
* **D: Ma jirin qaar badan oo dilaacyada lobate-ka ka mid ah oo laga helay oogada dayaxa** - The passage *does* state that lobate structures *were* found on the ice.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate interpretation of the information presented in the passage."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Aragtidee ku saabsan qaab-dhismeedka dhulka ayaa tilmaamaysa in uu jiro dhaqdhaqaaq juqraafiga ah oo ka dhacaya dayaxa?","The correct answer is **A: Dayaxu si tartiib ah ayeey u sii yaraanaysaa (The seabed is gradually subsiding).**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the scientists observed ""pressed-down formations called loobayt terraces"" that appear to have formed *from* the seabed and are ""gradually sinking."" This directly indicates subsidence – the sinking or settling of the seabed.
* The mention of ""burrows of worms"" and ""cautiously carved"" features further supports the idea of ongoing geological activity shaping the seabed as it subsides.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qaab-dhismeedka dhulka waxaa la abuuray ama la hagaajiyay waqti dheer ka hor (The land formations were created or modified a long time ago):**  While the formations *could* be old, the passage emphasizes their *gradual sinking*, implying ongoing activity.
* **C: Waxaa jira oo keliya tiro yar oo ka mid ah qaab-dhismeedyada dhulka oo ku yaalo oogada dayaxa (There are only a few land formations on the seabed):** The passage describes *many* formations (loobayt terraces, worm burrows, etc.).
* **D: qaab-dhismeedyada waxaa la hagaajiyay ama la sameeyay qiyaas ahaan dhawaan (The formations were modified or created relatively recently):** The word ""gradually"" indicates a long-term process, not something recent.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaase dheeraad ah oo aan dhici doonin ilaa dacwadda lagu soo oogo?","The correct answer is **C: Wadahadalada caddaynta markhaatiga goob jooga ah**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""cadeyn kasta oo goobjooge ah waa la hallayn karaa maxaa yeelay muuqaalkeeda si weyn ayaa loo baahiyay."" This means that gathering testimony from witnesses (which relies on their appearance/visual evidence) is being deferred until after the case is heard.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Faallooyin dheeraad ah:** While the article mentions a lack of further announcements, this isn't the *primary* thing that won't happen until the trial.
*   **B: Daabacaada sawirka:** The text specifically warns journalists against publishing images, not that images *will* be published later.
*   **D: Daabacaada Qorallada:** The text doesn't mention any restrictions on the publication of written reports (news articles).

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that witness testimony relying on visual appearance will be put on hold until the trial."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa aan ahayn dhibaatada hadda aay wajahayaan kuwa waxa sijileeyaa ama afka ka xidha?","The correct answer is **A: Xaalado cimilo oo aad u daran (Severe weather conditions)**.

The passage explicitly states that the current difficulty is due to ""xalada adage e cimilada taas oo sii adkaneysay dadaalada badbaadinta"" which translates to ""severe weather conditions which have intensified safety efforts.""

The other options are mentioned as factors *affecting* the situation (like the thickness and density of the ice), but the primary problem highlighted is the dangerous weather.
"
"Barafka ka sokow, maxaa kale oo saameeya dadaallada samatabbixinta?","The correct answer is **B: Xaaladaha cimilada**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Iyadoo loo eegayo burburka barafka, xalada adage e cimilada taas oo sii adkaneysay dadaalada badbaadinta."" (Considering the ice melt, the severe weather conditions that have intensified safety efforts.)

While the passage mentions ice melt, it directly links *weather conditions* to the intensified safety efforts and the difficulty of the situation. The other options aren't mentioned in the provided text.

Caqiidadee ayuu Roberts ka gaabsaday inuu ansixiyo?,"The best answer is **B: Muhiimadda xukunnada aay sameeeyso maxkamadda sare ee joogtada ah.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** Roberts ""ku celiyay odhaahdiisii hore ee sheegaysay in Roe v. Wade uu yahay """"Sharciga deggan ee dhulka"""" isagoo carrabka ku adkaynaya muhiimadda ay leedahay xukumadda Maxkamadda Sare oo joogto ah."" This directly points to his emphasis on the importance of established precedent from the Supreme Court.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **A: Ka hadalka kiiska anshax ahaan:** While the passage discusses the sanctity of life, it's not presented as Roberts' primary point. It's more a context for his argument about precedent.
* **C: Bilawga nolosha:**  Roberts doesn't directly address or take a definitive stance on the concept of when life begins in this passage.
* **D: Xuquuqda qarsoodiga shaqsiga:** While he acknowledges the importance of privacy, his main point is tying that privacy to the established legal precedent of *Roe v. Wade* and the Supreme Court's role.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of what Roberts emphasized in the passage.
"
Mawduucee ayuu Roberts uu dareemay inuu yahay mid aad u xun anshax ahaan in laga hadlo?,"The correct answer is **B: Go'aanka Roe v. Wade**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...waxa uu ku celiyay odhaahdiisii hore ee sheegaysay in Roe v. Wade uu yahay """"Sharciga deggan ee dhulka""""..."" This indicates that Roberts felt strongly about Roe v. Wade and its significance, and likely felt uncomfortable discussing it in the context of starting a new chapter (""nolasha bilaabto"").  He emphasized the importance of the Supreme Court's established precedent.

While options A and C are mentioned, the core discomfort revolves around Roe v. Wade itself. Option D (Waxyaabaha gaarka ah ee kiisaska) is too broad and not the specific focus of his discomfort.
"
Aaway labada xabo ee ahaa fallaadhaha iftiinka ee iftiimayay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhanka samada ama cirka** (The sky or heavens).

The text states: ""Labo koox iftiin leer ayaa kor loo taagay si aay hawada sare u qabtaan habeenki."" This translates to: ""Two clusters of light were erected to float in the sky during the night."" Therefore, they were in the sky.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayaa dhismayaalka cusub ee aadka u dheer laga dhisay goobta?","The correct answer is **C: Habeenka gudihiisa**.

The passage states: ""Labo koox iftiin leer ayaa kor loo taagay si aay hawada sare u qabtaan habeenki."" (Two groups of searchlights were erected to rise in the sky at night.) This indicates construction is happening at night. While it also says ""Dhismaha ayaa u socdo shan dabaq oo cusub goobta"" (The building is under construction with five new floors at the site), the presence of the searchlights strongly suggests activity is occurring during the night.
"
Macluumaadkee ayaa tilmaamaya in Toddobada walaalo (xidigaha ururta) ay godad yihiin?,"The correct answer is **A: Kala duwanaanta heerkulka**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""Muuqaalada iftiinka leh waxay ku tusayaan kala duwanaanshaha heerkulka laga bilaabo habeen iyo maalin waxayna ku tusinayaan inay yelankaran godad."" (Light imaging shows a variation in temperature from day to night and indicates that they can have craters.)

The other options are not directly supported by the text as evidence that the Seven Sisters are craters:

* **B: Dhexroorka afka godka laga galo:** While the text mentions the diameter of the openings, it doesn't use this as *proof* of craters.
* **C: Sahannada juqraafiyeed:** The text doesn't discuss geographical surveys.
* **D: Sawirrada godadka ku yaala dhulka:** The text refers to *light imaging* which shows temperature variations, not necessarily surface images of craters.



"
Sidee lagu arkay habdhaqanka kulaylka ee Toddobada Walaalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Infrared-ka sawiraanta (Infrared imaging)**.

The text states: ""Muuqaalada iftiinka leh waxay ku tusayaan kala duwanaanshaha heerkulka laga bilaabo habeen iyo maalin waxayna ku tusinayaan inay yelankaran godad."" This indicates that the temperature variations were observed using infrared imaging.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Bayaankee ku saabsan qofka tuhmanaha ah oo aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **D: Wuxuu ahaa mid aab wax dhaawac ah gaarin (He did not cause any harm to others).**

Here's why:

* **The question asks for a statement that is *not* true based on the text.**
* The text states the man ""dhaabac kasoo gaaray qaraxa"" (was injured by the explosion). 
* Therefore, statement D, ""Wuxuu ahaa mid aab wax dhaawac ah gaarin"" (He did not cause any harm to others), is the opposite of what the text says.  He *did* cause harm (to himself through injury).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gaari uu watay ayuu u adeegsaday weerarka, xiligii uu weerarka socday (He used a car to carry out the attack, during the attack).** The text states he was *inside* the car with the explosives, not that he *used* it to carry out the attack.
* **B: Waxaa la sheegay in uu si bareer cad ah u qarxiyay walxaha qarxa (It was reported that he detonated the explosives crudely).** The text only says he was *carrying* the explosives. It doesn't say how he detonated them.
* **C: Qowmiyadiisa waxaa yaqaana saraakiisha dawlada (His ethnicity is known to government officials).** The text states the government *knows* he is Uighur, but it doesn't say his ethnicity is *known to government officials*. This is a subtle but important distinction.



"
Maxaa macluumaad ah oo la xiriira weerarka oo ay maamulka xaqiijiyeen?,"The best answer is **A: Aqoonsiga cid kasta oo ku lug lahayd (Identification of all those involved)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Maamuladu magaciisa ma yaqaaniin ilaa hadda..."" (The authorities do not know his name yet...). This highlights that identifying everyone involved is a key part of the ongoing investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Qowmiyada uu ka soo jeedo qofka Tuhmanaha ah (The ethnicity of the suspected person):** While the text mentions the suspect is Uighur, the *identification* of everyone involved goes beyond just their ethnicity.
* **C: Ujeedada ka danbeysay weerarka in uu dhaco (The motive behind the attack):** The text doesn't mention anything about the motive.
* **D: Magaca koowaad iyo kan dambe ee qofka tuhmanaha ah (First and last name of the suspected person):** The text clearly states the authorities *don't* know his name.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**."
Waa kuwee kooxaha ciyaaraya kulanka ka dhici doona Garoonka Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **D: Springboks iyo All Blacks**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Cayaarta fiinalka waxa ay ka dhici doonta Ellis Park ee Johannesburg isbuuca xiga marka Springboks ay **Australia ku cayaaran**."" (The final match will be held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week when Springboks play **Australia**.)
* Springboks is another name for the South African national rugby union team (Koonfur Afrika).
* All Blacks is the name for the New Zealand national rugby union team (Dhamaan Madowga).

Therefore, the final match at Ellis Park will be between the Springboks (South Africa) and the All Blacks (New Zealand).
"
Halkee ayay Springboks’ ku ciyaari doonaan kulankooda xiga?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Cayaarta fiinalka waxa ay ka dhici doonta Ellis Park ee Johannesburg..."" which translates to ""The final match will be held at Ellis Park in Johannesburg...""
"
Keebaa kuwan soo socda ay dhibaato kala kulmeen dayax-gacmeedka weyn oo macmalka ah ee ah saldhigga hawada sare intii lagu guda jiray howlgalka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ilaalinta masaafada saxda ah ee aalada aay isticmalaan dayaxgacmeedyada ee thrusters-ka (Maintaining a safe distance from the thrusters used by the spacecraft).**

Here's why:

The text states that Chiao and Sharipov reported maintaining a safe distance from ""cadaadiyayaasha dhaqan beddelayaasha ah"" (cultural-changing pressures).  While the translation isn't perfectly precise, in this context, ""cultural-changing pressures"" refers to the thrusters used for maneuvering and attitude control of the spacecraft.  Maintaining a safe distance from these thrusters is crucial for safety during operations. The rest of the text describes the event and the subsequent actions taken.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay ahayd hadafka saldhiga hawada sare?","The correct answer is **A: Helitaanka birta wareegsata ee gyroscope-ka (Securing the gyroscope's gyroscopic component)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xarrunta hawadda ayaa ilaalinaysay aragtideeda, in kasta oo ay ku dhacday gryocope hore hawlihii saldhiga, ilaa dhammaadka marin habaabinta.""  This translates to: ""The air station maintained its vision, even though a gyroscope had previously fallen during station operations, until the end of the docking procedure.""

The key here is the mention of the *gyroscope* and the fact that the station was operating *until the end of the docking procedure*. This strongly suggests that the docking operation was related to securing or repairing the gyroscope itself, specifically the ""birta wareegsata"" (gyroscopic component).  The other options are less directly supported by the text.
"
"Keeba, bayaanada soo socda ee ku saabsan kiiska aan run ahay?","The correct answer is **C: Sharci ku saabsan fariimaha aan la codsanin ee spamka iimaylka ayaa loo adeegsaday kiiska.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kiiska waxa lagu soo bandhigay Virginia sababtoo ah waa guriga shirkada wayn adeega internet ka bixisa ee AOL, taaso ah shirkada dacdwada soo oogtay. Tani waa markii ugu horeysay xukun la rido iyadoo la adeegsanayo sharciga la dhaqangeliyay 2003 ee lagu yareynayay iimaylada tirada badan, sidoo kale loo yaqaan isbaam, ee ay soo cidaan loo dirsan laguna faafinayo inbogosyada isticmaalayaasha.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxaa lagu dacweeyay gobolka halkaas oo aay AOL xarunteedu tahay:** While true, the passage focuses on the *law* used, not specifically *where* the lawsuit was filed.
* **B: Xukun dembiyeed ayaa lagu riday:** The passage doesn't mention a criminal verdict.
* **D: AOL waxaa lagu soo oogay dacwada:** The passage states AOL *filed* the lawsuit, not that they were the ones sued.



"
Keeba ka mid ah bayaanada soo socda oo si sax ah u qeexaya kiiska?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL aya waxaa lagu eedeeyay ama lagu so oogay in aay qaybiyeen fariimo aan la codsanin.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Kiiska waxa lagu soo bandhigay Virginia sababtoo ah shirkada AOL... taaso ah shirkada dacdwada soo oogtay."" and ""...fariimo aan la codsanin laguna faafinayo inbogosyada isticmaalayaasha.""  This directly links AOL to sending unsolicited emails (spam).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kiiska ayaa waxaa ku lug lahaa labo adeeg bixiyaasha internetka ugu sareeya:** The prompt only mentions AOL, not two of the top providers.
* **C: Dacwadaas waxaa la maxkamadeeyay sanadkii 2003-dii:** While the law was enacted in 2003, the prompt doesn't explicitly state the lawsuit happened that year.
* **D: AOL waxay bilowday dacwad oogidda kiiska:** The prompt says AOL *was sued*, not that they initiated the lawsuit.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kooxdee ayuu Vidal bilaabay inuu u ciyaaro seddex xilli ciyaareed ka hor?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The question asks where Vidal started playing for the team three seasons before joining Barcelona. The text states he came from Sevilla.
"
Imisa kulan ayuu Vidal u ciyaaray Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The text explicitly states: ""Vidal ayaa kooxda u ciyaaray 49 ciyaar."" which translates to ""Vidal played 49 games for the team.""
"
Yaa ahaa kooxdii ka soo horjeeday ciyaarta?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text explicitly states that the game was scheduled against Bologna (""ciyaarta maalinta Axada lagaga soo hor jeedey Bolonia"").
"
Maxay ahayd sababta Jarque uu u joogay hudheelka?,"The correct answer is **B: Wuxuu lahaa kulanka xili ciyareedka ka horeeya (He had a pre-season meeting)**.

Here's why:

The text states he was at the hotel ""before the planned match against Bologna on Sunday.""  It also mentions he was there ""before the team's planned match against Bologna."" This indicates a pre-game preparation or meeting, part of the pre-season activities, not a formal training session (which is implied by the mention of Coverciano training). Options A and D are incorrect because the text doesn't state he was training or training Bologna. Option C is incorrect because the text describes a planned match, not a meeting *on* Sunday.



"
Maxay hay'adda jakarta ee cilmiga geophysics-ka u soo saari waysay digniin?,"The correct answer is **D: Ma ayna buuxinin baaxadda looga baahnaa dhulgariiirada (The fault line was not filled to the required extent).**

Here's why:

The original text states: ""Wax digitaan tsunami lama sheegi doono maadama uu aad uuga yaran doono heer dhibato dhacdo."" This translates to ""A tsunami warning will not be issued because the risk level will be very low.""  It then goes on to say the inhabitants might start leaving due to potential danger.

The question asks why the Jakarta geophysical agency didn't issue a warning. The answer implies the lack of a warning is related to the low perceived risk.  Option D directly relates to the underlying reason for this low risk – that the fault line wasn't properly addressed/mitigated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ma jirin wax halis ama khatar ah oo ah moowjka ama hirka biyaha (There is no danger or threat of a water wave or surge):** This is the *reason* for no warning, not why a warning wasn't issued in the first place.
*   **B: Si looga fogaado argagaxa ku dhacay dadka deegaanka (To avoid panic among the local population):** While avoiding panic is a consideration, it doesn't explain the *technical* reason for no warning.
*   **C: Si looga fogaado saameyn ku yeelashada ganacsiyada maxaliga ah (To avoid affecting local businesses):** Similar to B, this is a consequence, not a technical explanation.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa uu sababay dhulgariirka?","The correct answer is **D: 6.5 oo ah qiyaasta cabirka baaxada dhulgariirka**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Waxaa laga yaabaa suurtagalnimada khataro suunaami,in dadkii deganaa ay bilaabeen inay ka iskaga tagaan ganaciyadoodii iyo guryahoodiiba."" (There is a possibility of a tsunami hazard, where residents may have started leaving their businesses and homes.)

The question asks what *caused* the earthquake. The text *doesn't* say the earthquake was caused by people being scared, a tsunami hazard, or the warning. It only provides the magnitude of the earthquake: ""6.5 oo ah qiyaasta cabirka baaxada dhulgariirka"" (6.5 is the magnitude of the earthquake).

Therefore, option D is the only answer directly supported by the text.
"
Keeba ka mid ah kuwan oo sabab u ah dhaqdhaqaaqa qorraxda iyo dhamaan xiddigaha kale?,"The correct answer is **B: Lambarka Rossy, wareega, iyo isbadalada magnetic-ka ee meerayaasha.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the ""howlaha dhamaan xidigaha ku jira nidaam ka waxaa lagu heley inu kordhiyo tayadooda, dhaqaaqoda iyo waxkale...Iftiinka iyo wareega ayaa la wada adeegsadaa si loo go'aansado Rossy lambarka xiddigta..."" This directly links Rossby number, rotation, and luminosity to understanding star behavior.
*  The passage also mentions ""Tirada ugu yar ee Rossby, inta ugu yar ay xidiguhu la fal galaan marka loo eego magnetka ay soo muujiso,"" linking Rossby number to magnetic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Iftiinka Luminosity-ga iyo socodka balasmaha:** While luminosity and plasma motion are factors in star behavior, the passage specifically emphasizes the role of the Rossby number, rotation, and magnetic changes.
* **C: Wareegida iyo iftiinka Luminosity-ga:**  This is incomplete as it omits the Rossby number and magnetic activity, both of which are crucial according to the passage.
* **D: Iftiinka Luminosity-ga, Lambarka Rossy, iyo wareega:** This is close, but option B is more accurate as it explicitly includes the *magnetic changes in the sheaths* of the stars, which are stated as being relevant to the Rossby number and star behavior.



"
Sidee loo go'aamiyaa lambarka Rossby ee xiddiga?,"The correct answer is **A: Iftiinka Luminosity-ga iyo wareega**.

The text explicitly states: ""Iftiinka iyo wareega ayaa la wada adeegsadaa si loo go'aansado Rossy lambarka xiddigta..."" which translates to ""The light and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of the star...""
"
Immisa boqolkiiba dadka la waraystay ayaa taageeray Australia inay jamhuuriyad noqoto isla hadaba?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 boqolkiiba**.

The text states: ""Codayntii ugu kala aragti duwanayd, boqolkiiba 29 dadkii la waraystay ayaa rumaysnaa in Ustareeliya noqoto jamhuuriyad sida ugu dhaqsaha badan ee suurtogal ah...""

Option B reflects this information.
"
"Sida laga soo xigtay Julie Gillard, goorma ayey tahay in Australia ay noqoto Jamhuuriyad?","The correct answer is **B: Kadib boqornimadii Queen Elizabeth II**.

The text states: ""Ilaaliye ra'iisul wasaare Julia Gillard ayaa ku dooday intii lagu jiray ololaha doorashada dawladda dhexe 2010 inay ay rumaysantahay in Ustareeliya noqon karto Jamhuuriyad dhamaadka boqortooyada Elizabeth II'S ."" This indicates she believed it would happen *after* Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
"
Ururkee baa baadhista sharciga ah aay ku socotaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Waalidnimada la qorsheeyay**.

The text explicitly states: ""Stearns waxa uu baadhis ku wadaa in cashuurta loo adeegsaday maalgelinta ilmo soo ridista iyadoo loo sii Planned Parenthood..."" This indicates the legal investigation is focused on Planned Parenthood.
"
Guddigee ayuu Cliff Stearns madax ka yahay?,"The correct answer is **A: Tamarta aqalka iyo Guddiga ganacsiga**.

The passage states: ""Stearns waxa uu baadhis ku wadaa...sida Planned Parenthood iyo doorkiisa guddoomiyenimo **Guddiga Hoosaadka Kormeerka iyo Baarista, taasoo hoos tagta dallada Tamarta Aqalka iyo Guddida Ganacsiga.**"" This directly links Cliff Stearns to the Department of Energy and the Commerce Committee.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay waxa aan ku dhicin haweeneydii u dhalatay Swiss-ka?","The correct answer is **C: Waxaa kufsi galmo ah u gaystay 5 qofood**.

The text explicitly states that five people ""kufsaday gabadh u dhalay iswiisarlaaan,"" which translates to ""raped a woman born in Switzerland.""  The other options are related to the aftermath of the crime (evidence recovered, suspects appearing in court, devices seized) but not the direct act that happened to the woman.
"
Shirkadee ayaa la siiyay abaalmarinta joogtada ah ee Taiwan Sustainable Award ee 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage states: ""Balse suuqa iibka ee kombiyuutarda laabtoobku waxa uu noqon doonaa mid si wayn isu beddela oo u kala duwanaada ka dib marka ASUS lagu abaaliyo Billadada Sii Jirista Taywaan ee ay ku abaaliyaan Maamulka Yuan ee Jamhuuriyadda Shiine."" This directly links ASUS to receiving the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007.
"
Waa maxay ASUS Eee PC?,"The correct answer is **B: Waa kombuyuutar laptop ah (It's a laptop computer)**.

The text explicitly states that the ASUS Eee PC was initially presented at the Taipei IT Bisha in 2007 and was intended to revolutionize the laptop market. The text also refers to it as a ""kombiyuutarda laabtoobku"" which translates to ""laptop computer.""
"
Yaa mas'uul ka ahaa waraaqihii boostada ee la waayay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wiil**.

The text states: ""Shalayto, xafiiska boostada ayaa raaligelin u soo diray muwaadiniinta iyo saxaafadda ka dib markay ogaadeen in **wiilku** qariyay 600 oo dukumeentiyada boostada ah...""  This directly identifies the boy as being responsible for the missing mail.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, yaa daabacay raaligalinta la xiriirta dukumentiyada maqan?","The correct answer is **D: Xafiiska boostada Obanazawa**.

The text states: ""Salayto, xafiiska boostada ayaa raaligelin u soo diray muwaadiniinta iyo saxaafadda ka dib markay ogaadeen..."" (Yesterday, the Obanazawa post office issued an apology to citizens and the press after learning...).

This clearly indicates the post office issued the apology.
"
Goorma ayuu Del Potro u baahday inuu wax ka qabto arrinta garabkiisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Inta lagu guda jiray wareegii ugu horeeyay**.

The text states: ""Del Potro wuxuu lahaa fursadda inuu kujiro kooxda labaad, laakiin tan laftirkeeda waxay ubaahatay in la helo firaaqo gaaban kadib markaad gaartid 6-6."" This indicates the issue with his arm happened during the first set, specifically after reaching a score of 6-6.
"
Maxay ahayd natiijadii ka soo baxday isreebreebkii ugu horeeyay?,"The correct answer is **D: Waxaa ku guuleystay Del Potro wareegi labaad**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Murray ayaa ku guul dareystay qaybta hore...laakiin tan laftirkeeda waxay ubaahatay in la helo firaaqo gaaban kadib markaad gaartid 6-6."" This indicates a close match in the first set, but Del Potro received treatment for an injury and then came back to play. Since the passage describes Del Potro returning to play *after* the injury, and the narrative focuses on him recovering and continuing, it implies he ultimately won the match. The passage doesn't explicitly state who won the first set, but the overall implication is that Del Potro prevailed in the match. Therefore, it makes sense that he won the second round (presumably referring to the overall match).
"
"Sida ku xusan tuduca, yaa, gaar ahaan, lagu cadeeyay inuu bukaan yahay?","The correct answer is **B: Carruurta**.

The text states: ""Gabanatooraha sidoo kale wuxuu yidhi, """"Maanta waxaan ogaanay in caruur da' dugsiyeed ah loo aqoonsaday inay taabasho la yeesheen bukaanka."""" "" This directly indicates that schoolchildren were identified as having touched the patient.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa dammaanad qaad ah oo uusan guddoomiyuhu sameynin markii uu la hadlayay muwaadiniinta Texas?","The correct answer is **B: Waxyaabo la sameeyay si loo dhowro nabadgelyada bulshada.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Governor Perry pledged to take steps to protect public safety. He also mentioned that they had identified students who had ""touched the victims."" These are actions taken to ensure public safety. Option B accurately reflects that action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nidaamku si fiican ayuu u shaqaynayaa:** While the Governor *says* the system is working, the context of the passage implies there's a problem and the system is under scrutiny. He's acknowledging a potential threat, not definitively stating everything is fine.
*   **C: Waxay u qalabaysan yihiin si ay u daboolaan caqabadda:** The passage states there are ""small places in the world that are well suited to face the challenges this case has brought"". This isn't about covering up challenges, it's about identifying locations that can handle them.
*   **D: Kiisku maaha mid khatar ah:** The Governor explicitly calls the case a ""threat."""
Waa kee warka kaftanka iyo majajalada ah ee aay sameyeen labadii ardeey ee hore ee UW?,"The correct answer is **A: Warbixinta Colbert**.

The passage states: ""In badan ka barnaamijka Daily Show iyo Colber Report , Heck and Johnson aan la soo saarin dabacdooda ee wararka iyo tabinta wararka marka ay aheyeen arday ee UW sanadka 1988. Laga soo bilaabo bilowgeedii, The Onion waxay ahay shirkad war beddeleed wayn..."" and later mentions ""...qoraayaashooda badi ayaa saamayn wayn ku yeesheen showyada iska yelyeelka wararka ee Jon Stewart iyo Stephen Colbert.""  Heck and Johnson are identified as the founders of The Onion, and Stephen Colbert is directly linked to them. The question asks who created the satirical news and majalah that the two former UW students made. The Onion is the satirical news and majalah.

Therefore, the answer is **Warbixinta Colbert** (Colbert Report).
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, midkee kuwan kamid ah oo aan lagu darin gudaha Boqortooyada wararka kaftanka iyo majajalada ee basasha?","The correct answer is **A: Atlas-ka adduuka (Atlas Shrugged)**.

The passage explicitly states that The Onion has many forms of media, including a print publication, website, radio network, podcast, and a recently published map called ""Our Dumb World."" It mentions Al Gore and General Tommy Franks reading headlines from The Onion.  It also notes that many of The Onion's writers influenced Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert.

The options provided relate to different media formats. ""Atlas Shrugged"" is a **book** (a print publication), not a platform like a website or broadcast. Therefore, it's the one *not* mentioned as being part of The Onion's media empire.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Waa maxay waxa aay boolisku ilaalinaayeen?","The correct answer is **C: Qaybta kaso galitaanka wadada Downing**.

The passage states: ""askarta Downing Street, ee Reesal Wasaraha rasmiga ee degan halka"" (the soldiers of Downing Street, where the Prime Minister officially resides).  The police were trying to balance the protesters' right to demonstrate with the safety of the area *around* Downing Street. While the protesters moved to other locations, the initial action was to block traffic *towards* Downing Street, indicating the area around it was being protected.
"
Waqti intee le'eg ayay booliisku ka codsadeen dibad-baxayaasha inay dhaqaaqaan si ay uga hortagaan inuu dhaco zaxmad ama cariiri aad ah xaga isu-socodka gaadiidka?,"The correct answer is **D: Marka aay tahay 11:20**.

The text states: ""Markay ahayd 11:20, booliisku waxay ka codsadeen mudaaharaadayaasha inay dib ugu noqdaan waddada laamiga, iyaga oo sheegay inay u baahan yihiin isku dheelitiranka xaqa ay u leeyihin mudaaharadka iyo saxmadda taraafigga ee dhismaysa."" This directly answers the question about when the police asked the protesters to move.
"
Maxaa ka run ah cilmi-baarista uu sameeyay Dhakhtar Ehud Uur?,"The correct answer is **B: Qaar ka mid ah jiirarka hore u qaway sonkorowga ayaa hada aan qawin sonkorowga.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Waxaa hadda noo jooga jiirar 4 bilood jira oo aan qabin cudurka macaanka kuwaaso hore u qabi"" (There are now 4-month-old mice that used to have diabetes and no longer have it).
* Dr. Ur mentions that research is still in its early stages and expresses doubt about curing diabetes in humans. 
* Option B directly reflects the information given about the mice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** Dr. Ur specifically says the results *don't* apply to Type 1 diabetes.
* **C:** While the results might be hopeful, Dr. Ur is cautious and doesn't express strong optimism about a cure.
* **D:** The text says mice that *didn't* previously have diabetes are now developing it, the opposite of option D.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay Dr. Waxa aad ka shakisan tahay?","The correct answer is **A: Hadii natiijooyinkii lasoo helay ay khuseyso dadka qaba macaanka nooca 1aad.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""shaki ayuu isna ka qabaa in natiijooyinkaasi aanay wax xiriir ah la lahayn dadka qaba macaanka Nooca 1."" (He also doubts that those results have any relation to people with Type 1 diabetes.)  This means Dr. Ur is skeptical about the applicability of the research findings to people with Type 1 diabetes.

Waa kuwee bayaanadan soo socda aan si sax ah uma qeexin shilka ku dhacay Duulimaadka CG4684?,"The answer is **C: Diyaarada ayaa isku dayday in ay soo caga dhigato saddex jeer ka hor inta aysan soo dhicin.**

Here's why:

* **The provided text states the flight was aborted ten minutes before the attempted landing.** It does *not* mention multiple landing attempts. 
* **Option A** is accurate. The text clearly states the flight was delayed due to bad weather.
* **Option B** is accurate. The text mentions the crash site is ""very remote"".
* **Option D** is accurate. The text states the search was hampered by the bad weather.

Therefore, option C introduces information not present in the provided text and is thus inaccurate.

Maxaa sababay in Duulimaadka CG4684 in aay joojiso so caga dhigashadeeda?,"The correct answer is **D: Xaaladaha cimilada waxay ahayd mid liidata** (The weather conditions were bad).

The text states: ""Baadhista waxa caqab ku noqoteen isla cimiladii xumayd ee sababtay soo degistii la joojiyay."" This translates to ""The search was hampered by the same bad weather that caused the landing to be aborted."" Therefore, the bad weather was the reason for the aborted landing.

"Iyada oo ku salaysan tuduca, Keebaa run ka ah bayaanada soo socda ee ku saabsan waaya-aragnimada Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **A: Waxa uu u suurtogashay in uu jabiyo daaqada** (He managed to break the window).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mid ka mid ah muraayada ayaa jabtay iyaguna waxay bilaabeen iney ka soo baxan daqada, “waxa yidhi qof soo badbaday Franciszek Kowal.”"" This translates to ""One of the windows broke and they started to get out of the window, said someone who survived, Franciszek Kowal.""

The key is the phrase ""Mid ka mid ah muraayada ayaa jabtay"" (One of the windows broke).  Franciszek Kowal is identified as the person who survived and said this, implying he was involved in the breaking of the window. The text doesn't explicitly say he *broke* it, but his statement indicates a window broke, and he was present during the event. Option A is the most accurate inference.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wuxuu ahaa mid aan waxyeelo soo gaarin ugu danbeyntii** (He ultimately suffered no damage): The text doesn't mention whether Franciszek Kowal was injured.
* **C: Kursi uu jabiyey isagoo isku dayaya inuu ka baxsado** (He broke a chair while trying to escape): The text mentions chairs falling on the windows, but doesn't link it to Franciszek Kowal breaking one.
* **D: Waa uu dhaawacmay isaga oo isku dayaya in uu daaqad jabiyo** (He was injured while trying to break a window): The text doesn't mention Franciszek Kowal being injured.

Waa maxay sababta ay u adag tahay in la qiyaaso saamaynta suurtagalka ah ee Duufaanta kulaalaha Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Duufaanta ayaa aad uga fog dhacdada duufaanta oo ku dul wareegaysa dhulka (Even though the storm is far from landfall, it's difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States and Caribbean.)**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...waa ay adagtahay in la qiimeyo wax yeelada ay u geysan karto Qramada Midoobey iyo Caribbean-ka."" ( ...it's difficult to assess its potential impact on the United States and Caribbean.) This is because the storm is currently far offshore.
* **Option A** is a prediction of the storm's future strength, not the reason for the difficulty in assessing current impact.
* **Option B** is incorrect. Scientists *do* have information about the storm's sustained winds (40 mph).
* **Option D** is factually incorrect. The storm is *near* Miami, Florida (within 3,000 miles).



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keebaa kamid ah bayaanada soo socda ee ku saabsan duufaanta kulaalaha Danielle oo aan run ahayn?","The correct answer is **A: Saamaynta ay ku leedahay Kariibiyaanka ma aha mid la garanaayo** (The impact on the Caribbean is not well known).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Inkasto ay ka fogtahay duufantu bariga, waa ay adagtahay in la qiimeyo wax yeelada ay u geysan karto Qramada Midoobey iyo Caribbean-ka."" (Although the storm is far from the east, it is difficult to assess the damage it could cause to the United States and the Caribbean.) This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **B: Waxaa lagu sameeyay badweynta Atlantic Ocean** (It was formed in the Atlantic Ocean) - The passage states the storm formed in the eastern Atlantic.
* **C: Wuxay isu bedeli kartaa duufaanta hurricane-ka** (It can become a hurricane) - The passage says scientists predict Danielle will strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday.
* **D: Waxay u dhowdahay dhacdada duufaanta oo ku dul wareegaysa dhulka** (It is approaching a storm event and circling the earth) - The passage says the storm is currently moving with sustained winds and is being monitored closely.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that is directly contradicted by the passage.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa lasoo jeediyay inay tahay inay ku dhacaan cudurka ka hor inta uusan keenin safmareen ama faafitaan caalami ah?","The correct answer is **B: Astaamuhu waa inay ahaadaan kuwo dhexdhexaad ah (Symptoms should be moderate)**.

Here's why:

The text states Dr. Lee's concern is that H5N1 is spreading silently, with children infected without showing symptoms. The worry is that people will continue their daily activities, unknowingly spreading the virus because the symptoms are mild.

Therefore, the desired outcome *before* a global pandemic is to have symptoms that are noticeable enough to prompt people to stay home and avoid spreading the virus.  The idea is to have a ""moderate"" symptom presentation that acts as a natural deterrent to transmission.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, masaafo Intee le'eg ayay Fujian ka fogayd duufaanka?","The correct answer is **D: 77 kiiloomitir**.

Here's why:

The question states the distance between the location (Fujian) and the typhoon was 70 kilometers. The typhoon was moving at 11 kilometers per hour. The question asks how far the typhoon was from Fujian *at the time*.

To find the distance, we simply state the distance given: 70 kilometers. However, the options don't include 70 kilometers. The question is worded to trick you. It's asking how far the typhoon was from Fujian, given it was 70km away. Since the typhoon was moving, the actual distance *at the specific moment* is likely slightly different (and not what's explicitly stated). But the closest answer reflecting the given information is the sum of the distance and the distance the typhoon has traveled.

70km + (11km/hr * some time)

Since we're not given a specific time, we can't calculate the exact distance. But the question directly states the initial distance. We can interpret the question as asking for the distance from Fujian *at a specific point in time* where the typhoon was 70km away. Therefore, the answer should be the distance of the typhoon away from Fujian, which is 70km. But, since this isn't an option, let's re-evaluate. The distance the typhoon has traveled in 11 kilometers per hour. We need to assume the question is asking how far away the typhoon was from Fujian *at the moment of observation*.

Let's reconsider. If the typhoon is 70km away and moving at 11km/hr, we need to find the distance. If we assume the question is asking what is the distance between Fujian and the typhoon, given the typhoon's speed, then the question is somewhat confusing. However, based on the given choices, option D (77 km) is the closest.

The most logical interpretation, given the choices, is that the question is asking for the distance *between* Fujian and the typhoon, and the information about the typhoon's speed is a distractor. Thus, the answer is 70km. Since that's not an option, let's add the typhoon's travel in one hour: 70 + 11 = 81km.

However, 77km is also a viable response if we make an assumption. Considering that the question is testing if the respondent can differentiate the given information from the distractor, the most fitting response is *77km*.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{77}$"
Yaa salaamay George W. Bush markii uu yimid Aasiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng iyo Lee Hsien Loong**.

The text explicitly states: ""Waxaa salamay ku Xigeenka Resul Wasaaraha Singapore ee Wong Kan Seng iyo waxay ka wada hadleen ganacsiga iyo arimaha argagixisa Resal Wasaraha Singapore ee Lee Hsien Loong."" This translates to ""He greeted the Deputy Prime Minister of Singapore Wong Kan Seng and they discussed trade and counter-terrorism with the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong.""
"
Goorma ayuu madaxweynuhu ka hadlay dhinaca balaarinta ganacsiga Aasiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Kadib markii uu ku guuldareystay doorashadii dhexe ee dalka**.

The passage states: ""Kadib markii uu doorashada dhexe lumiyay muddo usbuuc ah, Bush wuxu dhagaytayaasha uga warramay ku fidinta ganacsiga ee Aasiya."" This clearly indicates he spoke about expanding trade in Asia *after* the midterm elections.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kee baa soo socda oo ah hadafka guud ee ay dowladdu higsanayso?","The correct answer is **C: In la helo gaari faras dheeraad ah oo wadartoodu tahay 1,300**

Here's why:

* The passage states the government is investing in ""300 buundoyin/bariijyo guud ahaan 1,300 gawaadhida qaada xamuulka"" (300 rigs/platforms totaling 1,300 cargo-carrying vehicles).
* The goal is to address noise pollution in areas with high noise levels.
* Therefore, the overarching goal is to increase the number of cargo-carrying vehicles to 1,300.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The passage doesn't mention investing in horse-drawn carriages.
* **B:** The passage mentions 300 rigs/platforms, not just 300 vehicles.
* **D:** The passage describes *increasing* the number of vehicles, not reducing noise pollution by lowering vehicle traffic.



"
Maxay dowladdu ku dhawaaqday?,"The correct answer is **C: Waxay qorsheynayaan inay maalgeliyaan 1,300 gaari faras oo dheeraad ah**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Waxaa dheerad ah 300 buundoyin/bariijyo guud ahaan 1,300 gawaadhida qaada xamuulka..."" which translates to ""In addition, 300 trucks/barges in total 1,300 trucks carrying cargo...""
*  The question asks what the government announced.
* Option C directly reflects the 1,300 trucks mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxay qorsheynayaan inay maalgeliyaan 300 oo gaari faras oo dheeraad ah** - This is incorrect because the text mentions 1,300 trucks, not 300.
* **B: Waxaa ka goʼan in ay wax ka qabtaan dhibaatada gaadiidka gaari faraska** - While the government is addressing the issue, the announcement is about the specific investment in vehicles, not just a general plan.
* **D: Dhibaatada buux dhaafka ama zaxmada waxaa xal loo heli doonaa bisha maarso** - The announcement is *about* the solution (the investment in trucks) which was made recently, not that the solution will be implemented in March.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxaa xog ah oo la og yahay?","The correct answer is **A: Heerka hanjabaadu ayaa la yareeyay**.

Here's why:

* The sentence explicitly states: ""Waxay tidhi, “Wax warbixin ah oo sheegaysa in weerar la filayay ma jirto."" (She said, ""There is a report stating that an expected attack does not exist."") This indicates the *expectation* of an attack has been lowered.
* The second part of the sentence, ""Hase ahaatee, yaraanshaha heerka khatareed lama macno aha in khatartii meesha ka baxday."" (However, the reduction in the threat level does not mean the danger has disappeared.) This reinforces that while the perceived threat is lower, a threat still exists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ma sii jirto wax hanjabaad ah** (There is no danger left): This is directly contradicted by the second part of the sentence.
* **C: Weerar ayaa la filayaa inuu dhaco** (An attack is expected to happen):  The sentence states the *expectation* of an attack is gone, not that an attack is definitely coming.
* **D: Sirdoonka ayaa xaqiijiyay in weerarka uu noqon doono mid aad u baʼan oo dhibaato badan dhalini doono** (Intelligence has confirmed that the attack will be very severe and cause a lot of damage): The sentence doesn't mention the severity of a potential attack. It only talks about the expectation of one.

Bayaankee la xidhiidhamudaaharaadyada k oo aan ahayn mid run ah?,"The correct answer is **B: Doorashooyinka oo waqtigoodii kadib dhacay ayaa keenay mudaharaadyada (The elections that happened after their scheduled time caused the demonstrations).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the protests *began* because of the delayed elections since 2011. This directly links the elections happening later than scheduled to the start of the protests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Komishanka ama Guddiga Madaxtooyadda oo jawaab ka bixiyay mudaharaadyada (The Commission or Presidential Committee responded to the demonstrations):** The text mentions the committee *delaying* the registration, which was a response to the protests.  So this isn't untrue.
* **C: Mudaaharaadyadu ama Dibadbaxayaashu waxay dalbadeen is-casilaadda CEP-da hore (The demonstrations or protesters demanded the resignation of the former CEP):** The text doesn't state that the protesters demanded the resignation of the former CEP.
* **D: Mudaaharaadyadu mararka qaar waxay ahaayeen kuwo rabshado wata (The demonstrations were sometimes violent):** The text directly states that ""Marmarka qaar mudaharaado rabshado leh ayaa dhacay (Sometimes violent demonstrations occurred).""

Therefore, option B is the only one that is *not* directly supported by the text."
Yaa soo jeediyay in CEP kii ugu dambeeyay in uu is casilo?,"The answer is **B: Dibadbaxayaasha**

The text states: ""Guddida madaxweynenimo ayaa soo jeedisay sugidda diwaangalin si ay qayb uga noqoto bakageka lagu cabirayo in wadanku lagu jiheeyo qbsoomidda doorashooyin cusub. **Guddida waxa ay aheed ka fal celinta Martelly uu sameye ee mudaaharad yada xukuumad diidka baahsan oo bilaawday bishii Oktobar. Marmarka qaar mudaharaado rabshado leh ayaa dhacay, waxaana sababay ku guuldaraysiga qabashada doorashooyinka, tano 2011kii.**""

This indicates that the protests, which were a reaction to Martelly's actions, put pressure on the existing CEP, leading to the proposal to delay registration. The question asks who proposed the resignation of the *latest* CEP. While the text doesn't explicitly say the CEP resigned, it heavily implies it due to the pressure and delays. And, the pressure came from the protests initiated by the opposition. Therefore, the opposition/protesters are the ones who indirectly prompted the situation leading to the CEP's potential resignation (though it wasn't directly stated in this excerpt).



**Important Note:** The original text doesn't *directly* state that the CEP resigned. It implies it through the delays and the political pressure. However, based on the options and the context, ""Dibadbaxayaasha"" (Protesters) is the most logical answer as they initiated the actions that led to the situation.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that both the USOC and Gymnastics USA share the goal of making gymnastics (and other sports) as safe as possible for athletes to pursue their passions in a secure, positive, and empowering environment. This directly aligns with option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Banaanka keenay xogta ku saabsan xadgudubka Larry Nassar:** While the text mentions the Larry Nassar situation and support for a transparent investigation, it doesn't state that *bringing this information to light* is their primary goal. It's more about learning from the situation and improving safety.
* **B: Raad raacitaanka ama dabagalka lagu sameeynaayo Xil ka qaadista:** The text doesn't mention any cover-ups or efforts to avoid accountability. 
* **C: Raad raacitaanka ama dabagalka baaritaanka qarsoodiga ah:** There's no mention of secret investigations in the provided text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Markabka miinooyinka baadha, waxa uu ku socday Puerto Princesa ee Palawan."" This translates to ""The mine countermeasures ship was heading to Puerto Princesa in Palawan.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Waxay ku sii socotay puerto Princesa** - While partially correct, it doesn't provide the location of the ship (Palawan).
*   **C: Waxaa weeye nooc ka mid ah markabkii badda ee loo yaqaano mine countermeasures** - The text states it's a ""markabka miinooyinka baadha"" which directly translates to ""mine countermeasures ship"".
*   **D: Waxa loo qoondeeyay guutada Toddobaad ee Ciidanka Badda ee Maraykanka** - The text mentions the ship was headed to Sasebo and Nagasaki in Japan, but doesn't say anything about being assigned to the 7th Fleet.

The text states: ""...dadaalada lagu baarayo dhinacyada burbursan waxay la kulmeen cimilada oo xun..."" (The efforts to investigate the damaged sides encountered bad weather...). While the text mentions a possible fire, it doesn't explicitly state it *caused* the collapse. The bad weather is presented as an obstacle to the investigation, implying it was present at the time of the collapse.
"
Dhul noocee ah ayuu shilku ka dhacay?,"The correct answer is **D: Dhulka Buuraleyda ah**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Burburku wuxuu ka dhacay figta sare ee dhulka buuralayda ah..."" which translates to ""The collapse occurred in the high mountains of the mountainous terrain...""
"
Maxay mas’uuliyiintu ka rajeynayaan natiijada fatahaadda?,"The correct answer is **C: Tirada Kalluunka sida federaalka ah loo ilaaliyo ee humpback chubs oo tiradiisu badatay.**

Here's why:

* The text specifically mentions that humpback chub is in a precarious situation.
* The officials are hoping the floodwaters will be enough to restore the spawning grounds for this fish species.
* The key goal, as stated in the passage, is to facilitate the return of the salmon run, implying a recovery in fish populations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dib uso celinta bacaadka bada:** While the passage mentions the impact on the river, it doesn't specifically state that restoring the salmon run will directly impact the ocean's fish population.
* **B: Abuuritaanka ama samaaynta xeebaha:** The passage focuses on the impact on the river and the fish that live in it, not on coastal development.
* **D: Kaymaha hooyga u ah duurjoogta oo badan:** While habitat for wildlife is important, the passage's primary concern is the impact on the salmon and their spawning grounds, particularly the humpback chub.
"
Kuwaan soo socda keebaa dhismihii biyo xireenka si joogto ah u saameeyey?,"The correct answer is **B: Kalluunka sida federaalka ah loo ilaaliyo ee humpback chubs**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions that the construction of the dam in 1963 *impacted* the humpback chub, stating it's in a precarious situation.  The text directly links the dam's construction to the chub's vulnerability.
* The other options are not directly mentioned as consequences of the dam's construction in the text.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided passage.

Midkee ka mid ah bayaanada soo socda oo si sax ah u sharaxaya qorshaha argagaxisada lagu eedeeyay ee ah inay qorshaynayeen weerarka?,"The correct answer is **C: Qarxinta qaraxyada ee meelaha caanka ah ee labada wadan**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states the US intelligence warns of a planned attack targeting *both* Kenya and Ethiopia.
* It also specifies the attacks will occur in ""popular places"" (meelaha caan ka ah) within *both* countries.
* Option C accurately reflects this dual-country, popular location aspect.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qarxinta qaraxyada ee meelaha caanka ah ee halka wadan** - This only mentions one country.
* **B: Qarxinta qaraxyada labada wadan** -  While it mentions both countries, it doesn't specify the locations (popular places).
* **D: Qarxinta qaraxyada halka wadan** - This is too vague and doesn't align with the specifics of the intelligence report.



"
Keebaa dadkan soo socda aan ahayn qareen?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos** are explicitly stated in the text as lawyers (""qareennada Greek caanka"").
* **Petros Mantouvalos** is also stated as a member of parliament (""xubnayasha barlamaanka""). While he might have legal knowledge, the text identifies him as a politician, not a lawyer.
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is identified as a journalist (""wariye"") who presents a TV program. 

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only one who is not described as a lawyer in the provided text.
"
Kooxda dadka ka midka ah aan lagu xusin inay qayb ka yihiin fadeexadda ka dhex jirta bulshada sharciga ah ee Giriigga?,"The correct answer is **C: Saxafiyiinta**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions:

*   **Qareennada (Lawyers):** Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are lawyers who were imprisoned for corruption.
*   **Garsoorayaasha (Judges):** Evangelos Kalousis, a high-ranking judge, was arrested for corruption and misconduct.
*   **Xubnaha barlamaanka (Members of Parliament) and garyaqanada (Lawmakers):** Petros Mantouvalos was removed from his position due to alleged illegal activities and corruption.

While the passage mentions a journalist (Makis Triantafylopoulos) who brought the story to light, he is not listed as being *part* of the corruption itself. The question asks who is *not* mentioned as being part of the scandal. The other options (lawyers, judges) are explicitly mentioned as being involved in the corruption. Therefore, journalists are the group *not* mentioned as being involved.



"

The passage states: ""...ku guuldaraysatay 7 wiked si loo afjaro wareegyada."" (failed to take 7 wickets to dismiss the innings). This means India conceded 7 wickets.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 11** - This refers to Robin Uthappa's score.
* **C: 2** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: 36** - This refers to the number of overs bowled.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay ahayd dhibcihii ugu badnaa ee ciyaarta?","The correct answer is **A: 70 orodyo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Robin Uthappa wuxuu sameeyey dhib cihii ugu sareeyey, **70 orodyo** 41 kubad ayuu tuuray..."" which translates to ""Robin Uthappa made the highest score, **70 runs** off 41 balls...""  Therefore, 70 runs is the highest score, and thus the highest contribution to the innings.
"
Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan sabab u ahayn niyad-jabka Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Sharciyada cusub ee barta ee ku saabsan macluumaadka galmada**.

Here's why:

* Adam Cuerden's statement focuses on his brother, who allegedly lied about the *legal reasons* for the removal of content. This points to a deliberate misrepresentation of the situation.
* The other options are either consequences *of* the situation or are not directly mentioned as causes of his disappointment:
    * **B: Tirtiridda farshaxanka dalka Wales:** This is the event itself, not the reason for his disappointment.
    * **C: Oo aan laga dhagaaysanin dalka Wales:** While relevant to the overall situation, it's not specifically what Cuerden is upset *about*.
    * **D: Beenta ku saabsan sababta keentay tirtirka farshaxanka:** This is the *action* (lying), not a separate cause of his disappointment.

Therefore, the new laws regarding online content are the most likely cause of the disappointment mentioned by Adam Cuerden.

"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, waa maxay waxa laga tirtiray barta?","The correct answer is **B: Macluumaadka ku saabsan galmada**.

The text explicitly states: ""...naqshadiisii [the original post] dhakhso ayaa loo tirtiray... Ka cadhaysiinta bulshada ayaa keentay dadaalada hadda ee siyaasada qabyada ah ee khuseeya waxyaalaha **ku saabsan galmada**...""

Therefore, the post that was deleted pertained to information about sexuality.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Kuwa soo socda keebaa Amir Khan uusan taageersanayn?","The correct answer is **A: Oo ay kamid yihiin dagaalyahannada haweenka ee Olombikada**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states Amir Khan said he ""doesn't feel it's right for women to fight."" This directly indicates he doesn't support female combat sports.
* He *does* say he will support the athletes in the 2012 Olympics in London (option B) and the location of the Olympics (option D).
* The text doesn't express an opinion on ""the ideas of women"" generally (option C), only on the idea of women fighting.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Keeba kuwan soo socdaa ayuu Amir Khan taageeri doona inkastoo uu shaqsiyan fikradiisa shaqsi ahaaneed uu qabo?","The correct answer is **C: Ciyaaraha Olompikada 2012**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In kastoo uu faalllooyin baxshay haddana waxa uu sheegay inuu taageeri doono tartamayaasha Olambikada Ingiriiska 2012 ee lagu qabanayo London.""

This directly indicates that Amir Khan will support the athletes of the 2012 Olympics, *despite* his personal feelings about women competing in combat sports.

The text states: ""Peter Lenz, a 13-year-old cyclist, died after a crash during a cycling race. While he was on his lap of the course, Lenz's bike went out from under him and was then overtaken by his fellow cyclist, Xavier Zayat. He was immediately taken to a local hospital by paramedics where he later died.""

This clearly indicates he died *after* the accident.
"
Waa kuma Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Tartame kale (Another competitor)**.

The text states: ""Waxa ka badiyay saaxiibkiis kale ee Xavier Zayat"" which translates to ""His other friend, Xavier Zayat, overtook him."" This clearly indicates that Xavier Zayat was another cyclist participating in the race.
"
Xaalad nooce ah ayaa ayaa rakaabka diyaarda ee cabsida ama walaaca dareemaayo ay u badantahay in uu kaga faa'iideysto fahamka uu fahmaayo shaqada gudaha ee diyaaradda?,"The correct answer is **B: Haddii nacaybka ay ka qabaan duulista ay salka ku haysto cabsi aan la aqoonin.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that a lack of understanding about how airplanes work contributes to fear.** It states, ""Dadka qaar, inay wax ka fahmaan sida diyaaraduhu u shaqeeyaan iyo waxa dhaca marka duulimaadku socdo waxa laga yaabaa inay ka caawiso ka guulaysiga baqdinta kaantarool iyo kasmo la’aaneed.""  This directly links fear to a lack of knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Hadii rakaabka lagu ceebaysto cabsida ama walaaca uu dareemaayo:** While comforting, this doesn't address the root cause of the fear (lack of understanding).
* **C: Haddii rakaabku ka soo horjeedo oo uu lid ku yahay dhammaan noocyada gaadiidka:** This is too broad.  Fear of flying doesn't necessarily mean fear of *all* transportation.
* **D: Haddii walwalkooda uu ka dhasho ama ka yimaado dhacdooyin naxdin leh oo aan la xiriirin duulista:** While trauma *can* cause fear, the passage specifically focuses on fear related to flying itself and a lack of understanding of the process.

"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo laga rabaa inuu sameeyo shaqsiga socotada ah ee beeca warwarka kaqawa marka ugu danbeeeyso?","The correct answer is **C: Is barbardhig qiimayaasha u dhexeeya shirkadaha socdaalka ee kala duwan** (Compare prices between different travel agencies).

Here's why:

The passage states that airlines sometimes offer vastly different prices for the same flight. It emphasizes the importance of comparing your own research results with the airline's website *before* booking.

Option C directly addresses the advice in the passage by recommending comparing prices from multiple travel agencies. This is a key step in finding the best deal.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ka raadi waxyaabaha ay bixiyaan shirkadaha socdaalka tirada badan** (Look for what travel agencies offer): While important, this is a broader step than just price comparison.
* **B: Si toos ah iskaga diiwaan gali Shirkada duulimaadyada** (Directly register with the airline): The passage advises *not* to book directly with the airline before comparison.
* **D: Waxaad fiirisaa bogga Shirkada duulimaadyada** (You check the airline's website): The passage advises doing this *after* comparing prices with other agencies.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay tahay in dadka safarka ah ay sameeyaan marka kowaad si ay u xaqiijiyaan qiimaha ugu fiican ee suurtagalka ah ee duulimaadka?","The correct answer is **B: Is barbardhig qiimayaasha u dhexeeya hay'adaha dalbashada dulimaatka ee kala duwan** (Compare prices between different airline booking agencies).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that airlines can offer different prices for the same flight. 
* It emphasizes the importance of comparing prices *before* booking, and not just relying on the airline's website.
* Option B directly addresses this by suggesting a comparison of prices across different agencies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waxaad fiirisaa bogga Shirkada duulimaadyada** (You check the airline's website) - The passage advises *against* this, as prices may not be the best.
* **C: Si toos ah iskaga diiwaan gali adiga oo u maraayo Shirkada duulimaadyada** (You directly register through the airline) -  This is too direct; comparison is recommended first.
* **D: Si toos ah iskaga diiwaan gali wakaalada safarka** (You directly register through a travel agency) -  While travel agencies are options, the passage focuses on comparing *multiple* agencies.

Goorma ayaa wehel looga baahan yahay inuu raaco alaabta dhiibaalka ah?,"The correct answer is **A: Marka alaabta lagu soo diro iyada oo la saaraayo xamuulka hawada.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Shirkadaha duulimad ma ogola alaab aan cidna la socon, sababta aad adiga u joogta taasa.""  This means when shipping via air cargo, the item needs to be tracked. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the provided text.
"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, marka aad dooranayso diyaarad duulimaadkooda joogtada ah ee shuraakada ah, kuwan soo socda keebaa aay tahay inaad mudnaan siiso?","The best answer is **B: Shirkadaha duulimaadyada ee shuraakada ugu weyn**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that rights vary depending on the destination and that codeshares (flights operated by different airlines under a single flight number) are common.  Choosing airlines with the *largest* partnerships gives you the most potential access to a wider network of flights and likely, more consistent and favorable treatment across different airlines within the alliance.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: Shirkada duulimaadyada ee bixisa dhibcaha ugu badan:** While earning points is good, it's secondary to ensuring a smooth and predictable travel experience, especially considering codeshares.  A lot of points aren't helpful if your flight is disrupted or you have limited rights.
* **C: Shirkada duulimaadyada aad had iyo jeer aad ku safartid:**  Loyalty to one airline is good, but it might limit your options and not necessarily provide better rights on codeshare flights.
* **D: Shirkada duulimaadyada laga yaabo in aad ka heshid mudnooyinka gaarka ah oo dheeraad ah:**  While perks are nice, they aren't the primary concern when dealing with potential variations in rights on codeshare flights.

Therefore, focusing on the airlines with the most extensive partnership networks is the most strategic choice.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Yaa laga yaabaa inuu bixiyo dhibcaha duulimaadka ah ee ugu badan?","The correct answer is **C: Shirkada duulimaadyada ee intad badan aad ku safartid ee hoos timaada shurakada kala duwan.**

Here's why:

* **The question emphasizes *most* frequent travel.** The passage states that rights vary by destination and that multiple airlines may be involved in a partnership. 
* **Frequent flyer programs often prioritize partners you use most often.**  If you frequently fly with one airline within a particular alliance (like Star Alliance, SkyTeam, or Oneworld), that airline's program is likely to offer the most points and benefits for your regular travel.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A & D:** These are too general.  You don't know which airlines are in the partnerships.
* **B:** While the airline you fly most often *is* important, the fact that it's part of a *wide* range of partnerships increases the likelihood of earning more points.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Dareennada soo socda keebaa wax u dhimi kara isticmaalka khamriga ee xad-dhaafka ah?","The correct answer is **A: Maqalka (Listening)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing your limits and the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption. To reduce excessive drinking, someone would benefit from *listening* to information about the risks. This implies seeking out and understanding the consequences of alcohol abuse. The other options are less directly relevant:

* **B: Araga (Seeing):** While seeing the effects of alcohol on others *can* be a deterrent, the passage focuses on knowledge and understanding.
* **C: Dhadhanka (Smelling):** Smelling alcohol doesn't inherently reduce drinking.
* **D: Urinta (Touching):** Touching alcohol is irrelevant to reducing excessive drinking.

Therefore, **listening** to information about the risks and consequences is the most direct way to encourage reduced alcohol consumption based on the provided text.
"
"Sida lagu xusay tuduca, maxaa suurtagal ah in ay yareeyaan dhibaatooyinka waxyeelada leh ee khamriga?","The correct answer is **C: U Isticmaalka khamriga si dhexdhexaad ah (Moderate alcohol consumption)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""adiguna in aad ogato xad kaaga waa muhiim"" (and it's important to know your limits). This implies moderation is key to avoiding harm.
* The passage highlights the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption and illegal alcohol (containing methanol).
* Option C directly addresses the importance of knowing and respecting one's limits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isticmaalka khamriga uu kujiro maadada mitanoolka (Using alcohol that contains methanol):** The passage explicitly states that methanol is dangerous and found in illegal alcohol, not a way to *reduce* harm.
* **B: Cabitaanka nooca khamriga spirits-ka ee sida sharci darrada ah loosoo saaray (Drinking spirits that are illegally produced):** The passage warns against this, not as a way to mitigate harm.
* **D: Cabidda khamriga oo lala cabbo dad badan (Drinking alcohol with many people):** While social situations can influence drinking habits, the passage doesn't suggest this is a way to reduce harm. It focuses on individual limits.

Aaway qiimaha hantida ee ka mid ah kuwa ugu sarreeya Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Degmada Kanaalka**.

The text explicitly states: ""Degmada oo dhan waxa loogu aqoonsaday inay tahay Goobaha Asaarta Adduunka ee UNESCO qiimaheeda dhaqan iyo taariikheed ee gaarka ah, **qiimaha dhismayaasheeduna waa kuwa ugu qaalisan waddanka**."" This directly links the Canal District to having the highest property values in the Netherlands.
"
Waa maxay sababta Degmada Kanaalka loogu qoondeeyay inay noqoto goob-dhaqameedka adduunka ee UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: sababtoo ah waaxay leedahay qiimo taariikheed iyo mid dhaqan**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Degmo oo dhan waxa loogu aqoonsaday inay tahay Goobaha Asaarta Adduunka ee UNESCO qiimaheeda dhaqan iyo taariikheed ee gaarka ah..."" (The entire district has been recognized as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its special cultural and historical value...)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Waxaay leedahay hanti gaar ah:** While true (the text mentions expensive buildings), this is a consequence of the historical and cultural value, not the primary reason for UNESCO recognition.
* **C: Sababtoo ah goobteeda waxaa ku hareeraysan Binnenstad:** Being surrounded by Binnenstad is a geographical fact, but not the reason for its UNESCO designation.
* **D: sababtoo ah Waxay leedahay qiimaha sare ee hantida:**  Again, the high value of the buildings is a result *of* the historical and cultural significance, not the cause of the UNESCO recognition.

"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kuwan soo socda kee baa ka dhigaya booqashada Phnom Krom mid qiimo leh?","The correct answer is **D: Safarka doonta ee kusii socdo harada**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Baqdinta jawiga degan macbuudka iyo **eegida xaga saree buurta ee biyaha Tonle Sap waxay ka dhigeen fulitaan keeda mid qiimo leh.** Booqashada goobta waxa sida quruxda badan la raacin karaa **safar doomeed harada ah**.""

While the other options are related to the area, the text specifically highlights the boat trip as a key factor making the Phnom Krom visit worthwhile.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Maxaa looga baahan yahay booqdayaasha si aay uso galaan Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Booqanaya Angkor Pass**.

The text explicitly states: ""Angkor Pass ayaa laga rabaa si aad u gasho macbadka..."" which translates to ""An Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple...""
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, kuwan soo socda kee baa ka hortagi kara dalxiise inuu soo booqdo Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Miisaaniyad safarka oo ballaaran (Expensive travel budget)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Boqashada dalxiisku waa qarash..."" which translates to ""Tourism visits are expensive...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Danta keliya ee laga leeyahay u sahaminta Badda Ross (Solely for the purpose of exploring the Ross Sea):** The text mentions the Ross Peninsula as a location, but it doesn't say that *only* exploring the Ross Sea prevents tourism.
* **C: Jadwal shaqo oo kuu ogolaanaya safarada bilaha Diisambar iyo Janaayo (A work schedule allowing trips in the months of December and January):** The text says the warmest time to visit is November-February, implying that a work schedule *allowing* travel during that period wouldn't be a barrier.
* **D: Dhaqdhaqaaq jireed oo xadidan (Limited physical activity):** While Antarctica is physically demanding, the text mentions specialized tours for those who can handle hiking on glaciers or reaching the South Pole. It doesn't state physical limitations are a universal barrier.



"
Dalxiise xiiseeynaayaa fuulista buuraha ayaa laga yaabaa inuu booqdo qaybtee ka mid ah Antartikda oo uu boqoni donaa?,"The best answer is **B: Dhulka wadanka gudihiisa ah (The interior land)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Tiro yar ayaa jilaalkii sii joogta. Takhasuslyaal ku dalxiisa dhanka hawada ayaa marmar u aada dhanka oogada buuro koris ama si ay u gaaran cirifka halkaas oo saldhig wayni ku yaal."" This translates to ""A small number remain during the winter. Specialized tourists sometimes go to the polar plateau or to reach the pole where a large base is located.""  The polar plateau is located in the interior of the continent.
* The text also mentions the Peninsula and Ross Ice Shelf as popular destinations for summer tourists.

Therefore, a tourist interested in mountain trekking would likely be interested in the interior land/polar plateau.
"
Aaway waxyaabihi waxa lagu eegi jiray ee hore ee casriga aha halkee ugu dhawdahay in laga helo?,"The correct answer is **B: Bartamaha magaalada (The center of the city)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maadaama dikhowgu laydhka aanu ahayn xilligoodii barwaaqo sooranka mushkiladda ay hadda tahay oo kale, waxay badanaa ku yaalaan magaalooyinka ama xerooyinka, kuwaaso ay fududayd in la gaadho marka loo eego kuwa dhowaanahan danbe."" This translates to: ""Since the drought is no longer the time of their prosperity, they are now mostly located in cities or settlements, which made them easier to reach compared to those in recent times.""

This indicates that the items being discussed (likely the ""meelihii hore"" - old places) are now found in cities, specifically in the city center where they are easily accessible. Options A and C are incorrect as the text contrasts them with the current locations. Option D (kambaska kulliyadda - college campus) is too specific and not supported by the general statement in the text.
"
Halkeey u dhawdahay in xoqadka\\telescope-ka casriga ah in lagu keeydiyo?,"The answer is **A: Matxafka dhexdiisa (Inside a museum)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Meelihii hore wax laga eegi jiray hadda waa laga baxay, waana madxafyo, ama goobo waxbarasho."" (Places where they were observed before have been abandoned, and they are now museums or educational institutions.)

This directly indicates that historical telescopes are now kept in museums. The other options are possible locations, but the text specifically mentions museums as the current resting place for these telescopes.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Halkee baa ugu fiican in lagu nagaado malinta xeebta ee jawigu xasiloonyahay?","The correct answer is **C: Degmada North Harbor**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Xeebaha Waqooyi (ee ku yaal degmada North Harbour) waxay ku yaaliin Badwaynta Baasifiga waxaanay fidsan yihiin laga soo Long Bay da ku taal waqooyiga ilaa Devonport ta Koonfureed. Ku dhowaad dhamaantood waa xeebo bacaad kuna haboon dabaalasho amaana, intooda badana waxa ay leeyihin hoosas ay bixiyaan geedaha pohutukawa. **Dabaashu waa nabdoon tahay.**""

This directly indicates that the North Harbor beaches have a peaceful atmosphere, making them ideal for a relaxing beach day.  While Mission Bay and St Heliers are mentioned as having shops and being busy, the text doesn't explicitly say they are peaceful. Waitemata Harbor is mentioned as the location of Tamaki Drive, not a specific beach area.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, xagee xaaladaha dabaasha ay u badan tahay inay ugu badbaado ama amaan badan tahay?","The correct answer is **B: Degmada North Harbor**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Xeebaha Waqooyi (ee ku yaal degmada North Harbour) waxay ku yaaliin Badwaynta Baasifiga waxaanay fidsan yihiin laga soo Long Bay da ku taal waqooyiga ilaa Devonport ta Koonfureed. Ku dhowaad dhamaantod waa xeebo bacaad kuna haboon dabaalasho amaana..."" 

This directly indicates that the North Harbour beaches, including the area from Long Bay to Devonport, are generally safe and good for swimming. Devonport is mentioned as the southern end of this stretch, implying it falls under the North Harbour category.
"
"Intii uu booqanayay goobta lagu tilmaamay tuduca, kuwan soo socda keebaa loo malaynayaa in ay yihiin kuwo aan haboonayn?","The correct answer is **C: Samaynaaya shactiro ama majaajilo (Making fun or joking)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ha ku kaftami Halokooska iyo Naasiyiinta. Waxba haka badelin goobta calamadeen ama xoqid ku sawirid qaab wax."" This translates to: ""Do not make jokes or be frivolous. Do not alter any markings or carve shapes into the site.""

Making fun or joking directly aligns with the prohibition of frivolous behavior. The other options are presented as respectful actions:

*   **A: Ku-dhaqanka sharafta leh (Paying a respectful visit)** - This is encouraged by the passage.
*   **B: Kaga tagaayo astaan mel ah agagaarka barta (Leaving a small token nearby)** - While not explicitly mentioned, it's generally considered acceptable to leave a small, respectful token as a sign of remembrance (though the passage cautions against altering the site).
*   **D: Xoqaaya qaab dhismeedka (Creating a structure)** - The passage prohibits altering the site, so creating a structure would be inappropriate.



"
Keeba ka mid ah kuwan oo qeexaya luqadaha lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **A: macmalka ah (artificial)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Luuqadaha kaalmaynta ayaa ah luuqado la sameeyey oo loo abuuray..."" which translates to ""Auxiliary languages are languages that have been created...""  This directly indicates they are artificial, not natural.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aan dabiici ahayn (non-natural):** While true, ""artificial"" is a more precise and commonly used term to describe auxiliary languages.
* **C: La dhisay (constructed):** This is similar to artificial, but ""artificial"" is the more standard term in linguistics.
* **D: Oorgaanika ah (organic):** This is the opposite of what an auxiliary language is; organic languages develop naturally over time.



"
Bayaankee ayaan si sax ah u qeexeeynin luqadaha aasaasiga ah?,"The correct answer is **D: Waxaa weeye luuqado la sameeyay oo aay ku wada hadlaan dad ku kala hadlo luuqadooyin kala duwan.**

Here's why:

* The original text defines constructed languages (luuqadaha kaalmaynta) as languages *created* to facilitate communication between people who don't share a native language. 
* Option D accurately reflects this definition by stating they are created languages used by people who speak different languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waa luuqado dabiici ah oo loo isticmaalo in lagu fududeeyo xidhiidhka ka dhexeeya dadka laga yaabo in aanay si fiican isu fahmin lhayn:** This describes a Lingua Franca, not a constructed language.
* **B: Waa luuqado ah kuwa dabiici ah iyo kuwa la dhisay oo la sameeeyay:** While some constructed languages might draw inspiration from natural languages, the core definition of constructed languages is that they are *created*.
* **C: Waa luuqado loo dhisay si loo wanaajiyo oo loo hormariyo xaaladaha isgaadhsiinta ee adag:** This is a valid purpose for constructed languages, but it doesn't capture the fundamental definition of what they *are*.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, maxay tahay in qofka rakaabka ahi uu hubiyo in dalxiiskoodu yahay mid ku beegan xilliga qaboobaha?","The correct answer is **B: Shuruudaha fiisaha (Visa requirements)**.

The text explicitly states, ""Rakaabka markabka dalxiiska lagama rabo fiise (eeg shuruudaha)"" which translates to ""Cruise passengers do not need a visa (see the requirements).""  Therefore, the passenger needs to check the visa requirements, specifically related to traveling during the cold season.  While the other options might be *related* to planning a trip, the text directly points to visa requirements as the key thing to check.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, haddii safarka rakaabku uu yahay mid ku beegan xiliga xagaaga, maxaa laga yaabaa inay ka fogaadaan?","The correct answer is **A: Waqtiga aay ku qaataan magaalada**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that cruise ships spend a significant amount of time in the port.  It also states that cruise passengers don't need a visa (subject to conditions).  The question asks what might be *avoided* during the summer trip.  Since visas aren't a problem, and the cruises are spending time in port, it's logical to infer that the time spent in the city itself might be limited or less emphasized in the itinerary. Therefore, it's what they might be *avoiding* spending too much time on, relative to other activities.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Dhexmaritaanka barafka** - The text says the ice is *passing* (Hadii Baltic Waqooyi ka gudbayso jiilaalka), implying it's no longer a significant issue.
*   **C: Shuruudaha fiisaha** - The text explicitly states that visas are not required.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg** - The text is *about* Saint Petersburg, not suggesting it's something to avoid.



"
Waa maxay sababta Catalan-ka inta badan loogu isticmaalo calaamadaha iyo ogeysiisyada Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Waxay ahayd luuqaddii ugu horeysay ee rasmi ah ee magaaladda**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Calamadaha ugu badan waxay qeexaan keliya luqadada katalanka loo yaqaano maxaa yeeley waxaa loo aas aasay si sharciyan luqadada rasmiga ah.""  This translates to: ""Most of the signs only specify the Catalan language because it was legally established as the official language.""

This indicates that Catalan was the first official language, which explains its prevalence in signage and official communications.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Si aad u ballaaran ayaa loo fahamsanyahay marka lala barbar dhigo Isbaanishka** (It is more widely understood when compared to Spanish) - The passage directly contradicts this, stating Spanish is widely used in public transport.
* **C: Waa luuqadda aadka looga door bido ku hadalkeeda magaalada Barcelona** (It is the language most preferred for speaking in the city) - While many people *do* speak Catalan, the passage doesn't explicitly state it's the *most* preferred language for everyday conversation.
* **D: Wargeyska Metro iyo tas-hiilaadka kale ee dadweynaha waxaa inta badan taga muwaadiniinta ku hadla Catalan-ka** (The Metro newspaper and other public facilities are mostly used by citizens who speak Catalan) - The passage doesn't make a claim about who uses these facilities.



"
"Luuqadaha soo socda keebaa laga isticmaalaa nidaamka Wargeyska Metro ee magaalada Barcelona, si loogu dhawaaqo ogeysiisyada joogtada ah?","The correct answer is **A: Ingiriis**.

The text states: ""Iclaanada joogtada ah ee Metro ayaa laga sameeyaa kaliya Catalan, balse carqaladaha aan qorshaysnayn ayaa waxaa ku dhawaaqa nidaam abutomaatig ah kuna sheega luuqado kala gedisan oo ay kamid yihiin Ispaanishka, Ingiriisiga, Faransiiska Carabiga iyo Jabaniyi.""

This translates to: ""The constant announcements in the Metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system that speaks in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.""

Therefore, English is one of the languages used by the automated system.
"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah waxyaalahan soo socda ee aan loo badnayn in la kala horraysiiyo sariir heersare ah iyo quraac?","The answer is **D: WiFi-ga xawaaraha sare leh (High-speed WiFi)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the *two biggest* things for high-end B&Bs are the bed and the breakfast. The options A, B, and C (specialized toiletries, antique furniture, and well-manicured grounds) all directly relate to enhancing the bed and breakfast experience.

High-speed WiFi, while increasingly important, isn't mentioned as a core element that defines a high-end B&B in the same way a comfortable bed and quality breakfast are. It's a nice-to-have, but not a primary selling point according to the text. Therefore, it's the least likely to be prioritized alongside the bed and breakfast.



"
"Iyada oo ku saleysan tuduca, Midkee ka mid ah kuwan soo socda oo aan ka mid ahayn dhibcaha ugu muhiimsan ee tartanka u dhexeeya uxury-ga B&Bs?","The correct answer is **A: Qurxinta casriga ah (Modern decor)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the two biggest things for high-end B&Bs are the bed and breakfast. It further emphasizes that comfortable bedding and unique breakfast are key to a good stay. While decor is *implied* as part of the overall experience, it's not highlighted as one of the *primary* competitive factors. The passage focuses on the quality of the bed and the uniqueness of the breakfast offering. The other options (quantity of seasonal breakfast items, comfortable bed, and locally sourced food/drinks) directly align with these key factors."
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee kuwan soo socda aan lagu qaban doonin Beijing sanadka 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Dhacdooyinka goobta ski Taizicheng**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Beijing waxay qaban doontaa furida iyo xidhida xaflada iyo dhacdada barafka. Meelaha kale ee ciyaarta siibashada waxa ka mida Taizicheng oo ku taal aaga Zhangjiakou..."" 

This clearly indicates that the opening and closing ceremonies, *and* the ice events, will be held in Beijing.  Taizicheng, located in Zhangjiakou, is mentioned as *another* location for some of the skiing events, but not for the ceremonies or ice events. Therefore, events at Taizicheng are *not* being held in Beijing.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Midkee kuwan soo socda lagu qabani doonaa Beijing sanadka 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Ciyaaraha Olombikada jiilaalka (Winter Olympics)**.

The text explicitly states that Beijing will host the Winter Olympics 2022. While they will also host the opening and closing ceremonies and ice events, the core event being held is the Winter Olympics.
"
Yaa leh khatarta ugu badan ee uu ku qaadi karo hargabka avian?,"The correct answer is **C: Shaqaalaha digaaga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Badankoodu waxay la xiriireen dad ka shaqaynayay dhaqashada digaaga..."" This indicates that poultry workers are at a higher risk of encountering avian paramyxoviruses compared to the other options. While others can be affected, the connection is specifically highlighted with poultry workers.
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Teeba oo ka mid ah bayaanada soo socdaa oo si sax ah u qeexaya hargabka shimbiraha?","The correct answer is **C: Ilaaliyaasha shimbiruhu waxay halis ugu jiraan inay qaadaan cudurka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Badankoodu waxay la xiriireen dad ka shaqaynayay dhaqashada digaaga, balse waxay sidoo kale khatar ku yihiin shimbiro daawadayaasha.""  This means those who work with birds (including bird handlers/caretakers) are at risk.
* **Option C accurately reflects this:** It says that bird handlers are at risk of contracting the disease.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Kaliya shaqaalaha digaaga ayuu ku dhacay hargabka:** The passage mentions bird handlers in general, not just those working with chickens.
    * **B: Kaysas badan ayaa laga soo sheegay oo bina aadamka ah kuwaas oo aad u badan marka loo eego shimbiraha:** The passage states that cases in humans are *rare* (less than 1000), not numerous.
    * **D: Dhammaan kiisaska laga soo sheegay bini'aadamku waxay ahaayeen kuwa aad u dilaa u ah oo halis badan:** The passage says some are dangerous, but not that *all* cases are deadly.



"
Muxuu isku xiraa kanaaliga Badda Cad ee Baltic?,"The correct answer is **C: Badda Arctic iyo Badda Baltic** (The Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea).

The text states: ""Badda Caddaanka-Baltic-ga waxay isku xirtaaa Badweynta Arctic Ocean ilaa Badda Baltic..."" which translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic Canal connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea...""
"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Baabuur noocee ah ayaa laga yaabaa in baasaboorrada lagu qaado si aan loo joojin rakaabka?","The correct answer is **B: Tareenada habeenkii goobta hurdada leh (Night trains with sleeping compartments)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions: ""Tareenada habeenkii laga seexdo, basaboorada waxa laga yaaba inuu ka aruriyo karigu si aan hurdada laguu khiyaamin."" This translates to ""Night trains with sleeping compartments, the bus may be able to detect your sleep, so you won't be able to deceive it with sleep."" This implies that night trains with sleeping compartments are a mode of transport where passengers might try to sleep, and therefore, are subject to checks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Diyaarado (Airplanes):** While airplanes have security checks, the text focuses on *stopping* passengers at the end of a journey, not the journey itself.
*   **C: Maraakiibta (Ships/Boats):** The text mentions ships as a place where baggage is checked, but doesn't link them to stopping passengers *during* a journey in the same way as night trains.
*   **D: tareenada xudduudaha gudba (Domestic border trains):** The text doesn't specifically mention domestic border trains.



"
"Sida ku muuqata ama ku cad tuduca, Goorma ayaa laga yaabaa in aqoonsigaaga lagu baaro tareennada xudduudaha isaga gudba qaarkood?","The correct answer is **A: Ka dib marka aad kaso deegto tareenka (After you get off the train)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hubinta tahribayaasha waa meesha ugu horeysa lagugu joojinayo marka aad ka soo baxdo diyaarad, Markab, ama wax kale sida gaadhiga."" (Smuggling checks are the first place you'll be stopped when you exit a plane, ship, or other like vehicle.) This directly implies that identity checks happen *after* you disembark.  The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **B: adiga oo hurdaayo (While sleeping):** The passage mentions that trains sometimes check for sleep during overnight journeys but doesn't say that's *when* they check for identity.
*   **C: Wax baaritaan ah lama sameeyo (No checks are done):** The passage explicitly states that checks *are* done.
*   **D: Marka tereenka uu ordaayo (While the train is moving):** This doesn't align with the information that checks occur upon exiting the vehicle.
