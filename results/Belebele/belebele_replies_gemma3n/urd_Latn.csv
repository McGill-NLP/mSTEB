"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Kamiyaabi key saath baaja bajaney key liye kis cheez ko durust tip nahein samjha jaata hay?","सही जवाब है **A: Ezaafi aawaz key liye, jinn kaleedon parr aap martey hein uskey saath zor badhadein**।

यहाँ बताया गया है कि यह सही क्यों है:

प्रसंग स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि आपको कुंजी पर बहुत अधिक बल से उंगलियां मारने की आवश्यकता नहीं है। वास्तव में, यह बताता है कि तेज आवाज के लिए, आप अधिक दबाव या गति के साथ चाबियों का उपयोग करते हैं। विकल्प A सीधे तौर पर इस सलाह का खंडन करता है, यह सुझाव देकर कि अधिक शोर के लिए कुंजी पर अधिक बल का प्रयोग किया जाना चाहिए।

अन्य विकल्प सही क्यों नहीं हैं:

*   **B: Apni salahiyat ko mahfooz karney key liye kam sey kam gair zaruri harkat karein:** प्रसंग ऐसा करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करता है, इसलिए यह गलत है।
*   **C: Dheela haath barqaraar rakhtey waqt saazon parr marna yaad rakhein:** प्रसंग ऐसा करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करता है, इसलिए यह गलत है।
*   **D: Ezaafi awaaz haasil karney liye jiss sey aap ghantiyaan bajatey hein uss key saath raftaar badha dein:** प्रसंग ऐसा करने के लिए प्रोत्साहित करता है, इसलिए यह गलत है।"
"Bajaa bajatey waqt, darjah zail mein sey kiss sey aawaz badhaney mein madad miley gee?","The correct answer is **A: Mazeed raftaar (More speed)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Bajey par izaafi hajam haasil karney key liye aap ziyadah dabao yaa raftaar key saath kamanon kaa istemaal kartey hain."" This translates to ""To achieve additional resonance while playing, you use more pressure or speed with the keys.""

The text emphasizes *speed* as a factor in increasing volume, not pressure or limited finger movement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mazeed zor (More force):** The text explicitly advises *against* using excessive force (""kaleedon par ziyadah zor sey ungliyan maarney kee zaroorat nahin"").
* **C: Kam dabao (Less pressure):** The text suggests using *more* pressure for increased resonance.
* **D: Ungli ki kam harkat (Less finger movement):**  The text mentions aiming for smoother, less forceful finger movements.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: Mazeed raftaar**."
Television parr tasweeron ka bardar keon kata hua hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Takehh tasweer mokammal screen ko bhar dey**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah yaqeeni bananay keliye tayaar kiya gayaa hay keh tasveer puri screen ko dhak lay- Isee ko over scan kahaa jaataa hay.""  This translates to ""It's prepared to make sure the picture covers the entire screen. This is called overscan.""

Therefore, televisions cut the borders of images to ensure the picture fills the entire screen. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail kis masalah ka DVD wazaa mein eek movie ko muntaqil kartey waqt kisi ko samnaa karna pad sakta hay?","सही उत्तर है **B: Juzwi tor parr zaili unwanaat katein**

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि ओवर स्कैन के कारण DVD बनाने के दौरान, वीडियो के नीचे मौजूद उपशीर्षक कट सकते हैं। इसलिए, सही उत्तर वह विकल्प है जो इस समस्या को दर्शाता है: उपशीर्षक का आंशिक रूप से कट जाना।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

*   **A: Puri screen ko na bharney wali eek tasveer:** ओवर स्कैन का परिणाम यह नहीं है कि तस्वीर पूरी स्क्रीन को नहीं भरती है, बल्कि यह है कि तस्वीर के किनारे कट जाते हैं, जिससे उपशीर्षक जैसे महत्वपूर्ण तत्व कट सकते हैं।
*   **C: Mokammal screen ko bharney deney wali eek tasveer:** ओवर स्कैन का लक्ष्य पूरी स्क्रीन को भरना है, लेकिन यह वांछित परिणाम नहीं है, बल्कि एक अनचाहा दुष्प्रभाव है।
*   **D: Barder ko katein:** यह ओवर स्कैन का एक हिस्सा है, लेकिन यह समस्या का पूर्ण विवरण नहीं है। समस्या उपशीर्षक जैसे कंटेंट के कटने के बारे में है।"
Bartanavi garrison kahaan waqea thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The text states: ""General John Cadwalader ko Bordentown mein hareef ko moghalte mein daal kar..."" which means General Cadwalader was to place the enemy in Bordentown.
"
Eek haath sey tahreer kardah draft parr kis ki dastakhat zahir hui thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The text states: ""ek haath sey tahreer kardah draft, jis par congress key sadar jaan hancok our secretary **charlis thomson** kee jaanib sey dastakhat kiye gaye..."" which translates to ""a hand-written draft, which was signed by Congress President John Hancock and secretary **Charles Thomson**...""
"
"Darjah zail mahalle waqoo mein sey, dunlop broad side akhir mein kahaan pahunchi thee?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The text states: ""uss kee ek copy 10 August ko london pahunchi thee."" (A copy of it reached London on August 10th.)
"
Colonel Stark key foji kahaan waqea they?,"The correct answer is **C: Jazeerah numa key shumaal mashriq mein (In the north-eastern part of the island)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jab jazirah numaa key shumaal mashriqi hissay key saath mestik daryaa key saath nasheebi lahar nay ek khalaa ko khol diyaa..."" (When the tidal wave, along with the Mystic River, opened a gap in the north-eastern part of the island...).  This clearly places them in the north-eastern part of the island.

Option A (""Baadh key kinarey, shumaali sirey parr"" - ""On the bank of the river, on the northern shore"") is too vague.
Option B (""Samundar key kinarey eek saahil parr"" - ""On the seashore, on a shore"") is also vague, though closer.
Option D (""Baadh key saamney"" - ""In front of the river"") is not precise enough.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Stark key logon ney apni baadh mein kabb tausee ki thee?","The correct answer is **D: Jabb fojiyon ney aagey ki taraf position sanbhaal liya**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stark key aadmiyon nay colonist kee jagah kee shumali hadd key janglay par positions sanbhaal leen."" (Stark's men took positions in the woods at the northern edge of the colony instead of the colonists.) This indicates that they expanded their position *after* taking the initial defensive positions.  The statement about calling for help is the *reason* they needed to expand, not the *time* they expanded. The passage doesn't mention ""baqaedah fojiyon key dao chalney key baad"" or ""kam lahar key doraan.""



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon cheen ka sabsey ziyadah pur tashaddud zamanah hay?","The answer is **D: Teenon saltanaton ka zamanah (Three Kingdoms Period)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Inn adwaar kaa sab sey mashhur zamana tharee saltanaton kaa ahed thaa jarr haan our jinn khandaan key maa bain 60 saal tak jaari rahaa. Inn adwaar mein bahut sey umaraa wo shorafaa key darmiyan takht wo taaj key liye shadeed jangein huyein. Qadeem cheen kee tareekh mein teen riyasatein sab sey khunreez dauron mein sey ek hay hazaaron afraad uss ladayi mein jaan bahaq huway keh ziyaan mein baday mahal mein sab sey uoonchi nashist par baith jayein.""

Translation: ""The most famous period of these times was the era of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted for 60 years between the families. During these times, there were fierce battles between nobles and gentry for the throne and the crown. In the history of ancient China, among the most violent periods, the Three Kingdoms were one where thousands of people died in battle to sit on the highest seat of power.""

The passage directly identifies the Three Kingdoms period as the most violent period in ancient Chinese history. While the other options represent important eras, the passage focuses on the bloodshed and conflict specifically associated with the Three Kingdoms period.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, khaanah badosh marhalah mein dakhil honey wali chiyontiyon ki colony ki foj mein sey kiya sahee hay?","The correct answer is **B: Unkey paas khaney ki kam farahami hoti hay** (They have a shortage of food).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Khaaney kee dastiyaab ashyaa mein kamee ho jaaney par colony mein khaanah badoshi kaa marhalah shuro ho jaataa hay"" which translates to ""When there is a shortage of available food in the colony, the food hoarding phase begins.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Wohh raat mein ghonslah banati hein** (They build nests at night) - While the passage mentions they march at night, it doesn't say they *build* nests at night specifically during the hoarding phase.
*   **C: Wohh aisey ghonsley banati hein jo 17 dino key baad badal jaatey hain** (They build nests that change after 17 days) - This describes the temporary nests built during the hoarding phase, but it doesn't explain *why* they enter this phase. The reason they enter is the food shortage.
*   **D: Wohh din key doraan march karti hein** (They march during the day) - The passage states they march at night during the food gathering phase, not during the hoarding phase.

Therefore, the shortage of food is the triggering condition for the food hoarding phase, making option B the correct answer."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa darjah zail bayaniyah khaanah badosh marhalah key doraan foji chiyontiyon ki caluniyon ki ghonsalah bananey ki aadaton ki durust tor parr akkasi karta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Wohh rozanah ghonsley badalti hein** (They change nests daily).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""iss marhalay mein colony aarzi ghonslay banaati hain jo harr roz tabdil hotay rahte hain"" (In this phase, the colony builds temporary nests that keep changing every day).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh raat key doraan ghonsley banati hein** (They build nests during the night): While the passage mentions they march at night, it doesn't say they *only* build nests at night.
* **B: Ghaonslah banaye begair 17 dino tak wohh march karti hein** (They march for 17 days without building nests): The passage states that a nest takes approximately 17 days to complete, implying they *do* build nests.
* **D: Wohh iss marhalah key doraan eek hi tarah key ghonsley istemaal karti hein** (They use the same type of nests during this phase): The passage says the nests are ""aarzi"" (temporary) and ""tabdil hotay rahte hain"" (keep changing), indicating they don't use the same type of nest.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon kharjee isharon ki mojudgi key bawajood jaari rahey gee?,"The correct answer is **C: Hayatiyaati ghadiyaan (Hayatiyaati clocks)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hayatiyati clocks khud ko barqarar rakhnay waala irteashindah hay jo khaariji eshaaron kee adm maujudgi mein bhee aazadi sey chal rahay chakkar kee muddat ko jaari rakhay gaa.""  This translates to: ""Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue to run freely even in the presence of external cues.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Endogenous chakkar (Endogenous rhythms):**  The passage mentions that many behaviors are dependent on endogenous rhythms, but it doesn't say these rhythms *continue* even with external cues.  In fact, external cues often *entrain* (synchronize) endogenous rhythms.
* **Motawatir taalein (Circadian rhythms):**  The passage states that circadian rhythms are *not* responses to external cues.
* **Moshahedah kardah taalein (Observed rhythms):** The passage states that observed rhythms are often dependent on the presence of external cues.



Therefore, only biological clocks are explicitly stated to continue running freely even in the presence of external cues."
Konsi istelaah unn afraad ki wazahat karti hay jo makhsus phenotypic rawayyah key tanawwo ko zaahir karti hein?,"The correct answer is **D: Kaseer shakal (Polymorphic)**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** refers to the presence of multiple forms or variations within a population. The question specifically asks about individuals exhibiting different forms related to a specific phenotypic trait (observable characteristic).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Hamm shakal (Monomorphic):** This means all individuals are identical in appearance, the opposite of what the question asks.
* **Hayatiyaat (Biology/Life):** This is a general term and not specific to describing variations in appearance.
* **Parjatiyaan (Species):** This refers to a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring.  While variation exists within species, the question is about variation *within* an existing population and how that variation is described.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon hayatiyaat ki durust istelaah hay jo eek khaas elaqah par qaabiz hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Aabadi**.

Here's why:

* **Aabadi (Population):**  The question defines ""aabadi"" as a specific geographical area containing a collection of organisms with particular characteristics. This aligns perfectly with the definition of population in biology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Hamm shakal (Monomorphic):** This refers to a population where all individuals have the *same* form/shape. While the text defines it, it's not the general term for a population.
* **Parjatiyaan (Species):** This refers to a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. It's a higher level of classification than a population.
* **Kaseer shakal (Polymorphic):** This refers to a population where individuals exhibit *different* forms/shapes. Again, it's a characteristic of a population, not the name of the population itself.



Therefore, **Aabadi (Population)** is the most appropriate and accurate term for a group of organisms inhabiting a specific geographical area.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon fitrat parr mabni seyahat ki sargarmi ki misaal nahein hogi?,"सही उत्तर है: **C: एक साइंस म्यूजियम का दौरा करना**

**व्याख्या:**

प्रारंभिक पाठ में प्रकृति पर आधारित पर्यटन की गतिविधियों की एक सूची दी गई है, जिसमें प्राकृतिक सौंदर्य का आनंद लेना, वन्यजीवों को देखना, फोटोग्राफी करना, पक्षी देखना, पार्कों में घूमना और पारिस्थितिक तंत्र के बारे में जानना शामिल है।

*   **जहरने तक पैदल सफर (Jharney tak paidal safar):** यह प्रकृति में घूमना और प्राकृतिक सुंदरता का अनुभव करना है, जो प्रकृति पर आधारित पर्यटन का हिस्सा है।
*   **जंगली फूलों की तस्वीर खींचना (Jangali phoolon ki tasweer kashee karnaa):** यह फोटोग्राफी के माध्यम से प्रकृति का आनंद लेना है, जो प्रकृति पर आधारित पर्यटन का हिस्सा है।
*   **मछली गगरी उड़ाना (Mahi geeri udaana):** यह एक सक्रिय गतिविधि है जो प्रकृति के साथ जुड़ाव को बढ़ावा देती है, जो प्रकृति पर आधारित पर्यटन का हिस्सा है।
*   **एक साइंस म्यूजियम का दौरा करना (Eek science museum ka daurah karnaa):** साइंस म्यूजियम में विज्ञान और प्रौद्योगिकी से संबंधित प्रदर्शन होते हैं, जो प्रकृति पर आधारित पर्यटन से अलग है। यह प्रकृति पर आधारित पर्यटन की गतिविधियों में शामिल नहीं होता है।

इसलिए, साइंस म्यूजियम का दौरा प्रकृति पर आधारित पर्यटन की गतिविधियों की सूची में फिट नहीं बैठता है।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon transport system ki buniyaad nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Kaam ki manazil (Work destinations)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a transportation system built on people moving from small towns to work in other places.**  The system isn't *defined* by the work destinations themselves, but rather the movement *towards* those destinations. 
* **Niji carein (Private vehicles), Eek mustahkam hayatiyaat (A robust lifestyle), and Insaani irteqaa (Human progress) are all elements that support or are consequences of this transportation system.**  Private vehicles enable the movement, a robust lifestyle allows people to commute, and human progress has been aided by increased mobility.
* **Kaam ki manazil (Work destinations)** are simply the *points of arrival*, not the foundational element of the transportation system itself. The system exists *because* people need to move *between* places, not because of the places they are moving *to*.

Therefore, ""Work destinations"" is the least fundamental element among the choices.
"
Nucleus kaa chakkar laganey waley zarrat mein kiss qism ka charge hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Musbat charge**.

The passage states: ""Protons mein musbat electricity charge hoti hay..."" which translates to ""Protons have a positive electricity charge..."".
"
Nucleus kinn zarraat sey morakkab hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Proton aur neutron**

The text clearly states: ""Nucleus do zarraat - neutron aur proton par mushtamil hota hay."" which translates to ""The nucleus is composed of two particles - neutrons and protons.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon thoda saa paanch binary number ki misaal hay?","The question asks to identify the binary number among the options that is *closest* to five in decimal value.  Let's convert each binary number to decimal:

*   **A: 1010** = (1 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 8 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 10
*   **B: 12001** - This is not a valid binary number. Binary only uses 0 and 1.
*   **C: 10010** = (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (0 * 2^2) + (1 * 2^1) + (0 * 2^0) = 16 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 = 18
*   **D: 110101** = (1 * 2^5) + (1 * 2^4) + (0 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0) = 32 + 16 + 0 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 53

We are looking for the number closest to 5.  10 is closer to 5 than 18 or 53.  Therefore, option A is the closest to 5.

**Final Answer: A**"
Binary nambaraat ka kiss tarah ki cheezon ka hawalh diyaa jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ek binary adad kee ek yaa do qadrein hoti hain yani 0 yaa 1, aur unn aadaad ko binary digits yaa **bits** key naam sey jaana jaataa hay...""

Therefore, bits are the fundamental units of binary numbers used in computers.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska talabah key blog likhney key buniyaadi fayedah key tor parr ebarat mein zikr kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Qawaed aur tahreer ki salahiyat mein taraqqi (Improvement in grammar and writing skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""talbah apni blog naveesi kee shuruaat grammar aur spelling kee ghaltiyon sey kartay hain, sare anjaam blog khwanon kee jamaat usay durust kar deti hay."" This highlights that blogging helps students improve their grammar and writing skills.  The passage also mentions that blogging encourages students to write better to avoid criticism, further supporting this point.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Saathiyon ki tanqeed mein kamee (Lack of criticism from peers):** The passage says the opposite - blogging *encourages* students to seek criticism.
* **C: Gardo nawah ki wasee aagahi (Wide awareness of surroundings):**  While blogging can lead to awareness, it isn't the *primary* benefit emphasized in the passage. The passage focuses more on writing skills.
* **D: Mosalsal sikhney ki badhi hui khawahish (Increased desire for continuous learning):** The passage mentions that blogging helps students learn better *beyond* school, but this isn't the core foundational benefit discussed. The improvement in writing skills is more fundamental.



"
Blog likhney ka darjah zail konsey pahlu ka talabah key blog likhney ki maharaton ko behtar karney key liye bator moharrik hawalah diya jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Tanqeed sey bachney parr zor**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Choon keh talbah omuman inteqad key shayaq hotay hain lehaza blog navees koshish karta hay keh woh apni tehreer ko behtar banaye takeh inteqad say bach sakay."" This directly translates to: ""Since students are generally eager for criticism, the blog writer tries to improve their writing so that they can avoid criticism.""

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they are not the *primary motivator* for students to improve their blogging skills according to the text. The main driving force is the desire to avoid criticism.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon talabah ki motazaad mowasilat ka fayedah nahein hay? ,"The correct answer is **D: Raftaar control (Raftaar control)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication *helps* students to control their speed and manage the pace of the instructional material. Option D, ""Raftaar control,"" is presented as a *benefit* of asynchronous communication.  Therefore, the question asks which option is *not* a benefit.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits:

*   **A: Bator wasilah internet ka istemaal (Using the internet):** The passage mentions internet and the World Wide Web as enabling students to access information anytime. This is a key benefit.
*   **B: Dinn key kisi bhi waqt hidayaton tak rubaru rasaayi (Access to instructions at any time of the day):** The passage states students can ask questions of their instructor at any time, which is a major advantage.
*   **C: Kaam key lachakdaar auqaat (Flexible work hours):**  The passage mentions flexible work hours as another benefit.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* a benefit of asynchronous communication is speed control. It's a *result* of asynchronous learning, not a benefit *in itself*.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, motazaad mowasilat ka darjah zail konsa pahlu talabah key liye lachakdaar nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Tadrisee mawaad (Teaching material)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights flexibility in:**
    * **Sikhney ki raftaar (Learning speed):**  The asynchronous communication allows students to learn at their own pace.
    * **Kaam karney key auqaat (Working hours/time):** Flexible scheduling is a key benefit.
    * **Internet ka istemaal (Internet use):**  Provides access to information anytime.

* **The passage explicitly states that the goal of asynchronous communication is to help students gain control over the *teaching material's* speed.** This implies that the teaching material itself is *not* flexible and its pace is set by the instructor.  The student adapts to the material, not the other way around.

Therefore, teaching material is the element that lacks flexibility in this context."
Kisko ebarat mein iss tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay jaisa kehh koyi aisi cheez jisey koyi shakhs qoroone wustaa key mahallaat sey wabastah kar sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Jhooti ladayiaan (False battles)**.

Here's why:

The text describes the atmosphere around a medieval fortress - the fear of rising from the earth, the sounds and smells of long, drawn-out battles, and the visual imagery of feasts and tournaments.  The text emphasizes a *perception* of these things, asking whether our imagination aligns with reality.

The question asks who is *not* mentioned in association with the medieval era. Of the options:

* **A: Khandaraat key gadhey (Trench ditches)** are a physical aspect of fortresses and are directly mentioned in the text.
* **C: Bahaduri (Bravery)** is a common theme associated with medieval warfare and knightly culture.
* **D: Shorveer (Valiant warrior)** is a term for a brave warrior, strongly connected to the medieval period.
* **B: Jhooti ladayiaan (False battles)** are not mentioned. The text focuses on the *noise* of battle, but doesn't characterize them as ""false.""  It presents the sounds as part of the environment, not as a commentary on the battles' validity.

Therefore, ""Jhooti ladayiaan"" is the answer because it's the least associated with the general portrayal of medieval life described in the text.



"
Darjah zail mein kiska ebarat mein iss tor parr zikr nahein hay kehh mahal key baqiyaat mein kisi boo yaa aawaz ko dikhaya jaa skata hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Khauf (Fear)**.

Here's why:

The text describes the strong sensory impressions of the fortress – sounds of long battles, smells, and visual imagery of feasts and gatherings. It emphasizes the overwhelming nature of these sensory details.

The question asks which of the listed elements is *not* mentioned in relation to being perceived (seen or sensed) within the ruins of the castle.  While sounds and smells are explicitly mentioned, the text primarily focuses on the visual imagery of feasts and gatherings, and the *feeling* of fear. However, it doesn't directly state that fear *can be seen or sensed* in the ruins. It's more about the overall atmosphere and the lingering effects of the battles.

The other options are explicitly mentioned:

*   **Ladayiaan (Battles):** The text mentions the sounds of battles.
*   **Ziyaafatein (Feasts):** The text mentions the imagery of feasts.
*   **Khurein (Rubble/Debris):** The text mentions the sounds of debris falling.

Therefore, fear is the only option that isn't presented as a directly perceived sensory element within the ruins.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Kirby Muxloe mahal ki durust wazahat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Mahal ki moti deewaron ki Lord Hastings ney darkhawast ki thee** (The pearl walls of the palace were requested by Lord Hastings).

Here's why:

* **The text states that Kirby Muxloe's large, transparent windows and weak walls made it unsuitable for withstanding prolonged sieges.** This implies the walls were *not* pearl-like or particularly strong, and thus Lord Hastings wouldn't have requested ""pearl walls"".

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **B: Tameer key waqt isko mulk ki pur aman fitrat ki wajah sey kam sey kam qilaa bandi ki zarurat thee** (During the construction, there was a need for minimal fortification due to the peaceful nature of the country). This aligns with the text stating the country was relatively peaceful when construction began.
* **C: Mahal ki tameer waqt ki muddat key liye aam nahein hay** (The construction of the palace was not common for a long period of time). While not directly stated, the fact that Lord Hastings initiated construction suggests it wasn't a frequently undertaken project.
* **D: Isey taweel aur barqaraar hamlon se bachney key liye tameer kiya gaya thaa** (It was built to protect against long and sustained attacks). This directly contradicts the text which says the castle was *unsuitable* for prolonged sieges.  However, the text also mentions the intent was to protect against *bandits*, which could be considered sustained attacks, making this option *plausible* but not directly supported as the *primary* reason.

Therefore, option A is the *least* accurate statement based on the provided text.
"
Tameer ki darjah zail konsi khosusiyat ko ebarat mein wazah kardah waqt ki muddat key doraan Kirby Muxloe mahal key liye aam samjhaa jaye gaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Hamlon sey bachney key liye tameer ki gayi buniyaad (The foundation reinforced for protection against attacks)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uss kee badi badi shaffaf khidkiyan our kamzor dewarein ziyadah arse tak shadeed hamlon key khelaaf mozahemat karnay key qaabil nahein hon gee."" (Its large, transparent windows and weak walls would not be able to withstand severe attacks for a long time.)

Then it mentions Lord Hastings started repairs in the 1480s when the land was relatively peaceful and only protection from small groups of bandits was needed.  This implies the initial structure wasn't built for heavy defense.  The fact that repairs were undertaken *suggests* the foundation and defenses were inadequate for a more serious threat.  The question asks what feature the repair work made the castle suitable for *during that time*.  Therefore, the repairs focused on improving defenses *against attacks*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Badey darichey (Large windows):**  The passage explicitly mentions the large windows were a *weakness*, not a strength.
* **C: Kuch mahallaat ki banisbat kam qilaa bandi (Less fortified than some castles):** The passage implies the castle *wasn't* well fortified. The repairs aim to *improve* the fortification.
* **D: Patli deewarein (Thin walls):** The passage mentions the walls were weak, not thin in a protective sense.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon aayendah season ki tayyaari kar rahey runner key sabsey ziyadah fayedah mand hogi?","The correct answer is **A: Mosame garmaa mein chalney wali mulk key paar mashq karnaa (Training in countries with a warm climate during the summer).**

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the importance of patience (sabr) over speed, especially when transitioning from sprints to longer distances.**  It highlights the necessity of endurance (bardasht).
* **The text specifically states that training in cold weather during winter, combined with low intensity, is an excellent preparation for a speed season.**  This implies that a gradual build-up, utilizing the colder months for foundational endurance, is beneficial.
* **Option A directly aligns with the text's description of winter training for speed season preparation.** While the text doesn't explicitly mention *warm* climates, the context is about preparation for a ""tezqadmi key season"" (speed season) *after* the winter months. The mention of low intensity combined with cold weather suggests building a base, and the speed season would logically follow after the winter.
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * **B: Tarbiyat key waqt kaasht kari ki raftaar parr tawajjo markuz karnaa (Focus on speed during training):** The text explicitly says patience is more crucial than speed *at this stage*.
    * **C: Teen minat key waqt ko beat karnaa (Breaking the 3-minute mark):** This is a specific performance goal, not a preparation strategy.
    * **D: Oopari jism ki warzish karney key liye gym ka istemaal karnaa (Using the gym for upper body workouts):**  While upper body strength is beneficial for running, the text doesn't emphasize gym work specifically; the focus is on endurance and climate adaptation.

Therefore, **A** is the most directly supported and beneficial preparation strategy based on the provided text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon pahley darjah key aadha meel key runner key liye bahut ziyadah aham nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Do minat key taht clock karnaa (Running a sub-2 minute mile)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that while speed is important for a great half-miler, **endurance (bardaasht)** becomes paramount as the race progresses.  It states that ""raftaar kee ahmiyat bahut kam ho jaati hay aur sabr wo bardasht ek mutlaq zaroorat ban jaati hay"" (the importance of speed diminishes greatly and endurance becomes an absolute necessity).

Let's look at the options:

* **A: Mosame sarmaa key mahinon key doraan chalney wali mulk key paar ki warzish karnaa (Training outdoors during the winter months):** This is presented as *excellent* preparation for the speed season due to the combination of cold weather and minimal congestion. This directly supports the importance of preparation for running faster.
* **B: Raftaar parr kasht kaari ko jhelna (Endurance and enduring hardship):** The passage explicitly states that endurance is *essential*.
* **D: Bardaasht parr raftaar ki kaasht karnaa (Training endurance with speed):** This refers to training that combines both endurance and speed, suggesting they are both important.
* **C: Do minat key taht clock karnaa (Running a sub-2 minute mile):** While being able to run a sub-2 minute mile is a sign of good speed, it doesn't directly address the *endurance* aspect that the passage highlights as becoming more crucial in a half-mile race.  The passage implies that achieving a sub-2 mile time is a goal, but it's not the most important factor for a top half-miler's success, especially considering the shifting importance of endurance.

Therefore, achieving a sub-2 minute mile clock is the least important factor for a top half-miler based on the passage's emphasis on endurance.



"
"Eek khelaadi key liye, darjah zail mein sey kisko akeley gezayi mashqon key zariyah haasil nahein kiya jaa sakta?","The correct answer is **C: Sarkardah karkardagi (Superior performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that appropriate exercise routines, *especially* isolated exercises (akele gezayi mashqon), significantly improve overall health, energy balance, hydration, and understanding of different aspects of exercise. This leads to better performance *and* enjoyment of the sport.

While isolation exercises can contribute to:

* **Behtar karkardagi (Better performance):**  By targeting specific muscle groups.
* **Ezafah kardah tafreeh (Increased enjoyment):** By seeing improvement and mastering skills.
* **Aam bhalayi (General well-being):** Through overall health benefits.

However, ""Sarkardah karkardagi"" (Superior performance) is the most ambitious outcome.  While isolation exercises can be *part* of achieving superior performance, they are *not* a guaranteed or sufficient path to it on their own. Superior performance often requires a broader training program including complex exercises, sport-specific drills, and strategic planning.

Therefore, the answer is C.

"Ebarat kei buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kisko nawjawaan kheladiyon key apney khel mein mazeed tafreeh haasil karney key eek tariqah key tor parr tajweez nahein kiya gaya hay?","The correct answer is **B: Sarkardah satah parr mosalsal karkardagi karnaa (Consistent performance at a high level)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that proper nutrition, hydration, and maintaining a healthy strength balance *contribute* to better performance and enjoyment. However, it doesn't mention that *consistent performance at a high level* is a way to *gain more enjoyment* from the sport. In fact, maintaining a high level of performance can often be stressful and demanding.

The other options are directly mentioned as factors that enhance enjoyment through improved health and performance:

* **A: Durust ghezaa ki mashq karnaa (Eating a proper diet):**  Explicitly stated as beneficial.
* **C: Moassir tor parr paani milaana (Drinking water effectively):** Explicitly stated as beneficial.
* **D: Eek sehat bakhsh taqat ka tawazun barqaraar rakhnaa (Maintaining a healthy strength balance):** Explicitly stated as beneficial.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek darmiyani faslah ka runner sazo saaman ka ek mazeed qimati tukda keon kharid sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Yehh unki zati tarjeeh hay (This is their personal preference)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that runners *often* buy equipment based on preference, even if it doesn't significantly improve their performance. It highlights the common misconception that expensive equipment guarantees better results.  Therefore, the reason a runner might buy a more expensive piece of equipment, despite the passage's points, is simply because they *prefer* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iss mein sabit shudah fawayed hein (There are proven benefits):** The passage explicitly states that often, there *aren't* proven benefits from buying expensive equipment.
* **C: Yehh unki karkardagiyon parr bahut ziyadah asar daley gaa (It will have a very significant effect on their performance):**  Again, the passage argues *against* this.
* **D: kam qimat waley sazo saaman key ird gird galat tasavvoraat hein (There are misconceptions surrounding cheaper equipment):** While the passage touches on misconceptions about cheaper gear, the question asks *why* a runner would buy *more expensive* gear, not why misconceptions exist about cheaper gear.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darmiyani faslah waley runner ko kiss cheez ki zarurat hay?","The correct answer is **C: Bahut kam saazo saaman (Very little equipment)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that running at a medium distance is relatively inexpensive, but there are misconceptions about the equipment needed. It further explains that most equipment doesn't significantly impact performance and players can feel like they're benefiting from it when they aren't. This implies that minimal equipment is needed for a medium-distance runner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bahut sey saazo saaman (A lot of equipment):** This contradicts the passage's assertion that equipment is not essential and often ineffective.
* **B: Mustahkam khel walaa pase manzar (A strong and well-designed track):** While a good track is helpful, the passage focuses on the equipment *the runner needs*, not the track itself.
* **D: Bahut sey paisey (A lot of money):** The passage explicitly states running is relatively inexpensive.



"
Kisney jauhari miqnaatisi goonj ki daryaaft ki thee? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch aur Purcell**.

The passage states: ""MRI jauhari maqnatisi goonj (NMR) naam kee zohoor tabeiyat par mabni hoti hay, isay 1930 mein **felex blaach (stenford university mein kam karnay waale) our edward porseel (harward university sey)** nay daryaft kiya thaa."" (MRI is based on the phenomenon of atomic magnetic resonance (NMR), which was discovered in 1930 by Felix Bloch (working at Stanford University) and Edward Purcell (from Harvard University).)
"
Tibbee tasweer ki goonj key liye kiss saal mein pahley haqqe tahaffuz ki manzoori dee gayee thee? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Chaar saal baad patent manzoor kiya gayaa thaa, jo MRI key maidan mein duniya kaa sub say pehla jaari kardah patent thaa- 1977 mein doctor damadian nay pehli martabah """"puray jism"""" kaa em aar aayi scanner banaya jisay unhon nay """"naqabu"""" qaraar diyaa.""

This means the patent was approved *four years* after the initial discovery in 1970, making the patent approval in **1974**.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, insaanon key paas deegar logon key jismaani aamaal mein modakhilat karney key liye kiss cheez ki mazboot samajh honi chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Idraak (Perception/Understanding)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the ability to understand *what others are thinking, intending, believing, knowing, and wanting*.  This ability to grasp the underlying *reasons* and *motivations* behind actions falls under the realm of **Idraak** - a deep understanding and awareness of situations and people.

* **Idraak** isn't just about seeing the action (the physical act of breaking a car window). It's about comprehending the possible reasons for that action – the *perception* of the situation and the underlying *understanding* of the person's circumstances.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Khawahish (Desire/Wish):** While desire might *influence* actions, the passage focuses on the underlying *reasoning* behind them.
* **Iraadah (Will/Intent):**  Intent is related, but it's a more focused concept.  Idraak encompasses a broader understanding than just intent.
* **Yaqeen (Belief/Certainty):**  Belief is related to what someone *thinks* is true, but the passage is about understanding a broader range of mental states.



Therefore, **Idraak (Perception/Understanding)** best fits the passage's emphasis on a deep, contextual comprehension of others' actions and motivations.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, iraadah ko samajhney sey insaanon ko kiya karney mein madad milti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Jismaani aamaal key peechey gair yaqiniyat ko khatam karnaa**

Here's why:

The passage explains that understanding intentions (iraadah) helps us interpret actions (jismaani aamaal).  By understanding *why* someone is doing something, we can reduce uncertainty and make more logical assumptions about their motivations. Option A directly reflects this: ""Eliminating uncertainty behind physical actions.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khawahishon ki phesh goyi karnaa (Predicting desires):** While understanding intentions can *inform* our predictions about desires, the passage focuses on understanding *intentions* themselves, not directly predicting desires.
* **C: Dusrey insaanon ko begair insaaf key dekhna (Judging others unfairly):** The passage actually advocates for *avoiding* unfair judgment by considering multiple possibilities behind actions.
* **D: Deegar logon ka dimaagh padhnaa (Reading other people's minds):** The passage states that the ability to read minds isn't a literal power, but a skill developed by understanding intentions and considering different perspectives.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon AI key asal maqsad ka durust khulasah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Miqaat bandi (Quotation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states AI's primary goal:**  To create machines capable of performing tasks that typically require intelligent, human-like behaviors. It lists examples like diagnosis, answering questions, writing, and recognition.
* **Let's analyze the options:**
    * **A: Manbsubah bandi (Control):**  The passage mentions ""control, planning, and scheduling"" as AI capabilities.  Control is definitely a key aspect of what AI aims to achieve.
    * **B: Awaz ki shanakht (Voice Recognition):** Voice recognition is explicitly listed as an example of a capability AI has achieved.
    * **D: Kaam ki khud kaari (Task Automation):**  The passage emphasizes AI's ability to automate tasks requiring intelligent behaviors. This is a core goal.
    * **C: Miqaat bandi (Quotation):**  Quotation (miqaat bandi) is about enclosing text in quotation marks. While AI *could* potentially be used to generate text that *includes* quotations, it's not a fundamental or defining goal of AI development. The passage doesn't mention or imply this.

Therefore, ""Miqaat bandi"" is the least relevant to the stated purpose of AI in the passage.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zai mein sey kiskey saath AI aksar wabastah rahtaa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Science ka afsaanah (Science fiction)**.

The passage explicitly states that AI is a powerful vision *in science fiction*. It also mentions that AI research involves creating machines capable of tasks that require intelligent behaviors, which is a common theme in science fiction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saarif ki khidmat (Service of the poor)**: While AI *could* potentially benefit the poor, the passage doesn't indicate it's directly related to this concept.
* **B: Manbsubah bandi aur Miqaat bandi (Time-based restrictions and appointment restrictions)**: These are unrelated to the core discussion of AI capabilities.
* **D: Dasti tahreer ki shanaakht (Handwritten text recognition)**: This is *one example* of what AI can do, but not the main concept it's closely tied to as stated in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon motagayyar ki soch key pattern waley kisi shakhs ki taaqat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Pattern ko yaad rakhnaa (Remembering patterns)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph emphasizes that Taqarubi Fikr relies on recognizing patterns, recalling information, and applying existing techniques. The ability to remember patterns is a fundamental aspect of this thinking style.
* Option A (identifying multiple correct answers) is the opposite of Taqarubi Fikr, which asserts there's only one correct answer.
* Option B (introducing new techniques) isn't directly linked to the core of Taqarubi Fikr, which is about using existing knowledge and techniques effectively.
* Option C (taking time to solve problems) doesn't directly relate to the cognitive pattern described.

Therefore, remembering patterns aligns most closely with the described Taqarubi Fikr thinking style."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko motagayyar soch waley tarze khiyaal ki tawajjoh ka markaz nahi samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Kisi shakhs ka waqt lenaa (Taking someone's time)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""Taqarubi fikr"" (Analytical Thinking) as a technique focused on finding a *single, correct answer*. The other options (A, C, and D) are all directly related to the core principles of analytical thinking:

*   **A: Yehh samajhna kehh sirf eek durust jawaab hay (Understanding that there is only one correct answer):** This is the central tenet of analytical thinking.
*   **C: Haqaayeq ki shanakhat karnaa (Identifying facts):**  Analytical thinking requires identifying and analyzing relevant facts.
*   **D: Malumaat ekatthah karnaa (Gathering information):** Gathering information is a crucial step in the analytical process.

**B: Kisi shakhs ka waqt lenaa (Taking someone's time)** is not directly related to the analytical process of finding a single, correct answer.  While patience might be useful *during* the process, the passage doesn't frame it as a key component of analytical thinking itself. It's more of a general consideration about human interaction.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko micro izhaar nahein samjha jaaye gaa?","सही उत्तर है **D: Anguthaa dikhanaa**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

* **माइक्रो एक्सप्रेशन** सूक्ष्म और क्षणिक चेहरे की अभिव्यक्तियाँ होती हैं जो किसी व्यक्ति की सच्ची भावनाओं को प्रकट करती हैं। वे अक्सर 1/25 से कम सेकंड के लिए सामने आते हैं।
* **अन्य विकल्प** (Botey waqt jhaanknaa - थोड़ी देर तक झाँकना, Peshaani ko khurachnaa - माथे को खरोंचना, Tezi sey palak jhapkanaa - तेजी से पलक झपकाना) सूक्ष्म अभिव्यक्तियाँ हैं जो अक्सर झूठ बोलने या भावनाओं को छिपाने का संकेत देती हैं।
* **Anguthaa dikhanaa (अंगूठा दिखाना)** एक स्पष्ट और जानबूझकर इशारा है, जो माइक्रो एक्सप्रेशन नहीं है। यह एक अधिक प्रत्यक्ष गैर-मौखिक संकेत है, न कि सूक्ष्म चेहरे की हरकत।

इसलिए, माइक्रो एक्सप्रेशन के संदर्भ में, अंगूठा दिखाना अप्रासंगिक है।"
Micro izhaar ki tashreeh key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust nahein hay?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Iss sey kholus ka andazah laganey mein madad mil sakti hay** (इससे खुलूस का अंदाज़ा लगानी में मदद मिल सकती है)।

यहाँ क्यों:

*   **A: Video recordingein aham taraqqiyaat ka baaes ban gayi hein** (वीडियो रिकॉर्डिंग महत्वपूर्ण प्रगति का कारण बनी हैं) - यह सही है। वीडियो रिकॉर्डिंग ने माइक्रोएक्स्प्रेशंस के अध्ययन में क्रांति ला दी है।
*   **B: Durust tashreeh jhoot bolney ka patah laga sakti** (सही व्याख्या झूठ का पता लगा सकती है) - यह सही है। माइक्रोएक्स्प्रेशंस का उपयोग झूठ का पता लगाने के लिए किया जाता है।
*   **C: Baat key saath chehrey key tassuraat ki tashreeh bhi ki jaati hay** (बात के साथ चेहरे के भावों की व्याख्या भी की जाती है) - यह सही है। माइक्रोएक्स्प्रेशंस चेहरे के भावों का एक हिस्सा हैं जिन्हें समझा जाता है।
*   **D: Iss sey kholus ka andazah laganey mein madad mil sakti hay** (इससे खुलूस का अंदाज़ा लगानी में मदद मिल सकती है) - यह गलत है।  हालांकि माइक्रोएक्स्प्रेशंस व्यक्तित्व और भावनाओं के बारे में जानकारी दे सकते हैं, लेकिन वे सीधे तौर पर ""खुलूस"" (ईमानदारी/खुलेपन) का पता लगाने के लिए विश्वसनीय नहीं हैं। यह एक बहुत ही जटिल अवधारणा है जिसे माइक्रोएक्स्प्रेशंस से सटीक रूप से मापना मुश्किल है।

इसलिए, विकल्प D माइक्रोएक्स्प्रेशंस के अध्ययन के बारे में गलत कथन है।"
Ranaisans key natijah key tor parr darjah zail mein sey kon ziyadah aham bann gaya thaa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Matan ki yaddasht (Memory of texts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Renaissance shifted the focus of learning and the spread of knowledge. Specifically, it says: ""Jab infiradi yaad aawari key andar bilkul dabao nahein rehta thaa, lekin matan kee yaad aawari kee ahliyat ziyadah tawajjoh kaa markaz bunn gayaa.""  This translates to: ""When individual recollection was not completely emphasized, but the ability to remember texts became the center of attention.""

Therefore, the ability to remember and study texts became much more important during the Renaissance. While individual memory and knowledge acquisition were still important, the emphasis shifted towards preserving and transmitting existing knowledge through texts.



"
"Ranaisans key natijah key tor parr, kam takeed darjah zail mein sey kiss parr ki gayi thee?","The correct answer is **A: Fard ki yaddasht (Individual memory)**.

Here's why:

The text states that before the Renaissance, the focus wasn't on individual memory.  The theory of knowledge didn't place much emphasis on remembering things personally.  However, the Renaissance shifted the focus to the *memory of texts* (matan ki yaddasht) as a crucial aspect of knowledge acquisition.  Therefore, the opposite of a lessened emphasis would be on individual memory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ilm haasil karnaa (Acquiring knowledge):** The text explicitly states the fundamental understanding of how knowledge is acquired changed. It didn't lessen the importance of acquiring knowledge; it shifted *how* knowledge was acquired.
* **C: Matan ki yaddasht (Memory of texts):** The text states the *opposite* happened - the memory of texts *became* a focus.
* **D: Malumaat ki taqseem (Distribution of information):** While the Renaissance did contribute to the wider distribution of information, the text doesn't directly mention a lessening of emphasis on information distribution as a primary outcome.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon talluqaat jaari rakhney key liye internet istemaal karney key eek moharrik ki akkasi nahein kartaa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Safar ki tahqiq karnaa (Researching travel)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on internet use as a motivator for **social connection and personal fulfillment**.  It specifically mentions:

* **""Seekhnay"" (learning) and ""muashirati solook"" (social behavior)** being key motivations.
* **""Shkhsi shomooliyat"" (personal inclusion)** and **""mustaqil taluqat"" (independent relationships)** as encouraging aspects.

While researching travel *can* involve connecting with people (e.g., travel forums), it's primarily driven by a desire for information and planning, not necessarily for fostering existing relationships or building new ones. The other options directly relate to maintaining relationships:

* **A: Karobaar ki networking (Business networking)** -  A way to connect professionally.
* **B: Kandaan key saath rabtah mein rahnaa (Staying in touch with family)** - A core component of maintaining familial relationships.
* **D: Naye logon sey mulaqaat karnaa (Meeting new people)** -  A direct way to build new relationships.

Therefore, researching travel is the least aligned with the passage's central argument about internet use for social connection and relationship maintenance.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon zaati mashguliyat key liye internet istemaal karney key eek moharrik ki akkasi nahein kartaa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Sehat ki dekh bhaal ki masnuaat ki tahqiq karnaa (Researching healthcare issues)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that ""learning"" and ""social behavior"" are key motivators for internet use.  Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Kisi nukhah ko dekhnaa (Watching a movie):**  This can be considered a form of entertainment and learning (exploring different cultures, narratives, etc.), aligning with the passage's focus.
*   **B: Kisi online bahas key board parr post karnaa (Posting on an online forum):** This directly relates to social behavior and interaction, a key motivator according to the passage.
*   **C: Sehat ki dekh bhaal ki masnuaat ki tahqiq karnaa (Researching healthcare issues):** While potentially beneficial, this is primarily driven by *information seeking* and *problem-solving*, not necessarily social interaction or learning in the same way as the other options. The passage highlights learning and social aspects, not just accessing information.
*   **D: Maliyaat ka bando bast karnaa (Managing finances):**  This can be related to learning about financial strategies and managing personal affairs, aligning with the passage's focus.

Therefore, researching healthcare issues doesn't primarily reflect the ""learning"" or ""social behavior"" motivators highlighted in the passage. It's more about accessing and processing information to address a specific need.



"
Maghribi Europe ney kabb asaraat parr bahut ziyaadah bharosa krnaa band kar diyaa aur apney andaaz sey taraqqi karnaa shuru kiyaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Qoroone wusta key ekhtetaam key ird gird** (Around the end of the Middle Ages).

The text states: ""Qoroone wusta key aakhir mein maghrabi europe nay apnay tarz ko taraqqi dena shuroo kiyaa."" This translates to ""At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style.""
"
Kapdon ko baandhney key liye button ka istemaal karnaa kis cheez ka natijah thaa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Saleebi jangein (Crusades)**.

The passage states: ""Uss waqat kee sub sey badi tarqqiyon mein sey ek kaa wajood saleebi logon key kapday ko jakadnay keliye button key istemaal key chalan ko aam karnaa thaa."" This directly links the adoption of buttons to the Crusades.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko mahauliyaati masail ka eek qaabile amal taweel muddati hal samjha jaata hay?","सही उत्तर है **C: Masail ki wajah ki shanaakht karnaa (समस्या के मूल कारण की पहचान करना)**।

यहाँ तर्क दिया गया है:

* प्रश्न एक टिकाऊ, दीर्घकालिक समाधान की तलाश करता है।
* पाठ स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि केवल लक्षण-आधारित उपचार पर्याप्त नहीं है।  हमें समस्याओं के मूल कारण को संबोधित करना चाहिए।
* विकल्प C, ""Masail ki wajah ki shanaakht karnaa"" सीधे उस मूल कारण की पहचान करने की बात करता है। यह दीर्घकालिक, प्रभावी समाधान के लिए सबसे उपयुक्त दृष्टिकोण है।

अन्य विकल्पों का विश्लेषण:

* **A: Israaf ki tarze zindagi key intekhabaat ka boycot karnaa (अतिरेकपूर्ण जीवनशैली विकल्पों का बहिष्कार करना):** यह महत्वपूर्ण है, लेकिन यह केवल एक पहलू है। यह एक लक्षण को संबोधित करता है, मूल कारण को नहीं।
* **B: Sargarmi (सक्रिय भागीदारी):** सक्रिय भागीदारी आवश्यक है, लेकिन यह एक समाधान नहीं है। यह एक प्रक्रिया है जिसका उपयोग अन्य समाधानों को लागू करने के लिए किया जा सकता है।
* **D: Mahauliyaati tehreek ka ittehaadi bananaa (पर्यावरणीय आंदोलन को एकजुट करना):** एकजुटता महत्वपूर्ण है, लेकिन यह समस्या के मूल कारण को संबोधित नहीं करता है। यह एक रणनीति है, अंतिम समाधान नहीं।

इसलिए, सबसे प्रभावी दीर्घकालिक समाधान समस्याओं के मूल कारण की पहचान करना और उन्हें संबोधित करना है, जो विकल्प C द्वारा सबसे अच्छी तरह से दर्शाया गया है।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail kon sey hal ko mahauliyaati masail key alamati elaaj key tor parr samjha jaye gaa?","The correct answer is **A: Sargarmi mein masruf rahnaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeah bahut sey halaat mein sirf alamati elaaj jaisa hay."" (In many situations, it's just like symptomatic treatment.)  ""Alamati elaaj"" means treating the symptoms without addressing the root cause.

* **Sargarmi mein masruf rahnaa (Staying busy/engaging in activities):** This is presented as a potential solution that focuses on *managing the effects* of environmental problems without tackling the underlying issues. The passage implies it's a surface-level fix.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Masail key jadd ki wajhon ko gair faal karnaa (Failing to address the root causes of the problems):** This is the *opposite* of symptomatic treatment.  Addressing root causes is about finding permanent solutions.
* **C: Israaf ki tarze zindagi key intekhabaat key baarey mein nazriyaat ko aawaz denaa (Expressing views on choices of lifestyles based on extravagance):** This is a potential step towards addressing the *cause* of some environmental problems (excessive consumption), not just treating symptoms.
* **D: Mahaul dostanah tariqah sey zindagi guzarnaa (Living an environmentally friendly lifestyle):** While important, living sustainably can be considered a way to mitigate the effects of environmental damage, but it doesn't necessarily address the root causes like population growth and unsustainable consumption patterns. It's closer to a preventative measure than symptomatic treatment.



Therefore, staying busy/engaging in activities (Sargarmi mein masruf rahnaa) is the best answer because the passage directly equates it to symptomatic treatment.

Europe ki pahli ladayi kiss mulk mein hui thee jiskey markazi masalah key baarey mein kaha jaata hay kehh wohh mazhabi seyaaqo sabaaq ka haamil honey key bajaye hukumat key tawazun sey motalliq thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Portugal**.

The passage states: ""Spiny jaa nashini kee jang pehli jang thee jis kaa markazi masalah taaqat kaa tawazun (balance of power) thaa."" This translates to ""The Treaty of Tordesillas was the first war whose central problem was the balance of power.""  The Treaty of Tordesillas was a treaty between Portugal and Spain in 1494, dividing the newly discovered lands outside Europe between the two powers. Therefore, the first war focused on the balance of power was the Treaty of Tordesillas which happened between Portugal and Spain.
"
Kiss jang ki baaz auqaat aakhiri ‘mazhabi ladayi’ key tor parr wazahat ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Tees saalah jang (Thirty Years' War)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Iss taur tees salah jang woh aakhri jang thee jisay mazhabi jang kaa unwaan diyaa jaa sakta hay."" This translates to ""In this way, the Thirty Years' War was the last war that could be called a religious war.""
"
Catholic church key konsey darjah zail pahlu ki chaan been nahein ki jaa rahi thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Church key andar ki taaqat ki markaziyat (The centralization of power within the Church)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Church's ""central authority had been in Rome for over a thousand years"" and this led people to question whether the Church was actually following its own principles regarding alleviating suffering and poverty. The passage implies the centralization of power was a key aspect of the Church that was being questioned and criticized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aya Church key andar ki daulat ki takhsees munaasib thee (Was the allocation of wealth within the Church appropriate?)** - The passage *does* mention concerns about the Church's wealth and how it was being used, suggesting this was being questioned.
* **B: Aya mazhab key buniyadi osulon ki islaah honi chahiye (Should the basic principles of the religion be reformed?)** - The passage implies that questions were being raised about whether the principles were being followed, suggesting the need for reform.
* **D: Aya mazhab key buniyadi osul purey kiye jaa rahey hein (Are the basic principles of the religion being followed?)** - The passage directly states that people were questioning whether the Church was upholding its own principles.

Therefore, the centralization of power is the aspect that the passage suggests was being most critically examined and challenged.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Versailles mein kiskaa qatal hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Eek mohafiz (A guard)**.

The text states: ""Eek moqaa parr bheed mein say eek rukn nay warsayi mein khauf zadah raani key saamney maaray gaye shahi muhafiz kaa sarr lahra diyaa.""  This translates to: ""On one occasion, a member of the crowd raised the head of the slain royal guard in front of the terrified queen.""
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko bheed ney badshah aur malekah parr nafiz nahein kiy thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Versailles sey achaanak ka khoruj (Sudden departure from Versailles)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the King and Queen were *forced* to return to Paris by a mob. This implies the departure from Versailles was not their own decision, but rather a consequence of the mob's actions.
* The passage explicitly says they were forced to open their carriage windows, they witnessed the execution of a guard, and they had to return to Paris.

Therefore, the sudden departure from Versailles was something *imposed* upon them, not something they actively chose to do in response to the mob's pressure.

Darjah zail mein sey kon bartaniyah key gair rewayati bahri jang ka natijah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Alami qanoon mein tabdiliyaan ki gayi theen (Changes were made in international law)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Britain's unconventional naval warfare:** This included blockades, submarine nets, and aiming to prevent all non-belligerent ships from entering certain areas. This was a departure from traditional naval warfare.
* **The options describe consequences and actions *resulting* from the British actions:**
    * **A: Momaasil jangi harbon ko tainaat karney ki jarmani ki khawahish (Germany's desire to deploy retaliatory fleets):** A logical German response to a blockade, hoping to start a war of unlimited submarines.
    * **B: Gair mashgool jahaz ko noqsaan key andaz mein rakhaa gaya thaa (Unoccupied ships were put at risk of damage):**  This is a direct result of the submarine nets.
    * **D: Aham farahmiyaan naqabiley rasaayi theen (Major supplies were inaccessible):** This is a direct consequence of the blockade.
* **C: Alami qanoon mein tabdiliyaan ki gayi theen (Changes were made in international law):**  While the British actions *challenged* international law, the passage doesn't state that international law was *changed* as a direct result.  It describes Britain operating *within* the existing legal framework but pushing its boundaries.  The passage focuses on the *actions* and their consequences, not a formal alteration of the laws themselves.



Therefore, the passage doesn't indicate that international law was altered. It focuses on the specific actions Britain took and the ensuing consequences.

Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr bartaniyah key jarmani key khilaaf bahri gherabandi ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Issney yaqeen thaa dilaya thaa kehh fitri jahazon ko khatrey mein nahein dalaa jaye ga** (It was believed that natural vessels would not be put in danger).

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Britain implemented a naval blockade to cut off supplies to Germany, impacting both military and civilian shipments.** This directly relates to options C and B.
* **Option C is correct** because the blockade directly interfered with Germany's supply chain.
* **Option B is correct** because the passage mentions Germany anticipated a limitless submarine war as a response.
* **Option A is correct** because the passage acknowledges the blockade potentially violated established international law.
* **Option D is incorrect** because the passage *doesn't* say Britain believed natural vessels (like passenger ships) wouldn't be put in danger.  In fact, the passage says Britain even laid underwater mines to endanger *all* vessels in the international waters. This directly contradicts option D.



Therefore, option D presents a belief that is not supported by the information provided in the passage."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kinkey liye motaddid amraaz ki tashkhisaat sabsey ziyadah mumkin hogi?","The correct answer is **A: Eek 32 salah khatun (A 32-year-old woman)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that multiple sclerosis (MS) affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States.
* It also mentions that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
* Among the options, only a 32-year-old woman fits the criteria of being female, which increases the likelihood of having MS compared to the male options. The age is not directly relevant to the increased risk due to sex.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, baqaedah sargargi mein shirkat karney walon ko kiss cheez keliye mazeed himaayat ki zarurat thee?","The correct answer is **A: Dard ka manfi tasavvur (Negative perception of pain)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Baqayedgi say sargarmiyon mein hissah lenay waalon ko mamool kee jismani naql wo harkat say honey waale daaimi dard aur takleef key ehsaas key darmiyan farq ko eyaan karnay waale **dard key manfi tasavvur** ke lehaaz say ziyadah madad kee zaroorat hoti hay.""

This translates to: ""...Those who participate in regular activities need more help regarding differentiating between normal physical sensations and persistent pain and suffering, specifically in terms of a **negative perception of pain**.""

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that regular participation in activities requires more support in overcoming a negative perception of pain.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, baad bananey ka kaam aam tor sey kaisey anjaam diya jaata hay?","The correct answer is **D: Eek duel shakal mein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah sport awwaleen taur say eek doel kee shakal mein khela jaataa hay jis mein eek shamsheer baaz dosray say do bado muqabilah karta hay."" This translates to: ""This sport was initially played in the form of a duel in which a swordsman competes against another.""

The passage describes the sport's original form. Options A, B, and C are later stages or venues where the sport evolved, but the *initial* form was a duel.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey ko internet ki zahar khurani ka sabsey mazboot nishandahi karney wala hoga?","The correct answer is **D: Eek nuskhah ki goli ka bottle (A bottle of prescription medicine)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that the *best indicator* of internal poisoning is the presence of the container of the poison, specifically the prescription bottle. While symptoms like vomiting, fever, cramps, and abdominal pain (options B & C) *can* be signs of poisoning, they aren't the strongest or most definitive evidence. The bottle itself provides the most direct link to a specific toxin.

The passage explicitly states: ""Androni zaharkhuri kee behtareen nishandahi adviyaat yaa zahrile ghareloo kimiyayi ajzaa kee khule bottle kee maujudgi hosakti hay."" (The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of a bottle of medicine or household chemicals.)

Therefore, the bottle is the most robust indicator.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi motassirah ki tashkhees kartey waqt pahla munasib qadam kiya hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Manzar ka mushahidah karnaa (Observing the scene)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph emphasizes the importance of assessing the situation *before* approaching the victim.  The first step is to observe the scene to understand the nature of the accident, potential dangers, and the overall situation. This is crucial for personal safety and determining the appropriate course of action.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable as the *first* step:

* **B: Motassirah tak pahuchnaa (Reaching the victim):** This is too hasty.  Approaching without assessing the scene could put the rescuer in danger.
* **C: Motassirah ki position ki jaanch karnaa (Checking the victim's position):** You need to *see* the scene first to understand the victim's position and the surrounding dangers.
* **D: Madad key liye intezaar karnaa (Waiting for help):** While waiting for help may be necessary, it shouldn't be the *first* step.  You need to ensure your own safety and understand the situation.



"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr motassirah ki jaanch karney key amal ki akkaasi karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Motassirah ki position ka mushahedah karein (Observe the victim's position)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes assessing the situation and the potential danger.** Knowing the victim's position is crucial for understanding the nature of the incident and potential risks. It helps determine if they are in immediate danger (e.g., being crushed, exposed to further harm).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apney zakhmon ki taab laaney ki fikar na karein (Don't worry about your own wounds):** While self-preservation is important, this is not the primary focus of *initial* assessment of the victim.  The passage stresses the importance of assessing the victim *before* considering self-preservation.
* **B: Motassirah key saamney manzar ka andazah lagayein (Estimate the scene in front of the victim):** This is less critical than understanding the victim's immediate position and condition.  Focusing on the overall scene is secondary to the victim's well-being.
* **D: Kisi bhi surkh jhnadon ka notice leney ki koshish karein (Try to notice any red spots):**  While noticing red spots *might* be part of a later assessment, it's not a fundamental step in initial observation of the victim's position and overall condition.

**The passage highlights the need to assess the victim's situation carefully, and observing their position is a fundamental part of that assessment.**



"
Farancisi inqilaab sey paida honey wali konsi tabdiliyon ka kaam gaar tabqah key shahriyon parr ahem asar thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Tabqah sey qabiliyat ki taraf muntaqili (Transition from class to ability)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Inqilaab key baad hirfatein tamaam mard darkhwast dehandgan ke liye khol di gayee theen, jis say intehayi pur ummeed aur kamiyab afraad ko kamiyabi haasil karnay kaa moqaa milaa.""  This means that after the revolution, opportunities were opened to all men regardless of their class, allowing talented individuals to succeed.
* The text also mentions the army's ranking system shifted from class-based to merit-based (""fauj kee ranking cliss parr mabni honey key bajaye abb calber parr mabni hoti hay""). This further emphasizes the shift from class to ability.
* The French Revolution inspired the oppressed lower classes to bring about change. This change included the potential for social mobility based on merit rather than birthright.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mulk key liye himaayat mein ezaafah ho gaya (Increased support for the country):** While the revolution might have increased support for the country, it isn't the *most significant* impact on the working class citizens, according to the text.
* **C: Jamhuri nazariyah ko ikhtiyaar karnaa (Choosing the republican ideology):**  While the revolution introduced republican ideology, the text focuses more on the impact on opportunities for individuals, not specifically on the choice of ideology.
* **D: Eek naya paimaehs karney ka system (A new system of governance):** The text mentions the shift in army ranking, but doesn't delve into the specifics of a new governance system and its impact on the working class.



"
"Farancisi inqilaab key baad, foj aur deegar peshon mein kamiyaabi ka kiss cheez parr mabni honey ka kam imkaan thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Salahiyat (Ability)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that after the French Revolution, in the military, ranking was based on ""caliber"" rather than class.  This implies that ability and skill (which translate to *salahiyat* in Hindi/Urdu) were the determining factors for advancement.  

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Hosulyaabi (Skill/Proficiency):** While related to ability, it's not as encompassing as ""salahiyat."" Ability is a broader concept.
* **B: Tabqah (Class/Hierarchy):** The passage explicitly mentions a move *away* from class-based systems.
* **C: Azam (Determination/Ambition):**  While important, determination alone isn't enough. Ability and skill are necessary to achieve success, even with ambition.



Therefore, ""salahiyat"" (ability/talent/competence) is the best fit based on the information in the passage.
"
Konsi awaami khidmat key baarey mein kaha jaata hay kehh wohh taraqqi yaaftah mamalik mein bahut ziyadah bechaini ki wajah thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Awami transport (Public transport)**.

The question explicitly states that in developed countries, complaints about transportation systems are common. The text highlights issues like water quality and animal deaths, and then directly links complaints to the transportation system.  The subsequent question asks about a public service causing unrest in developed countries, and public transport is the only option directly related to the text's context.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, awami transportation system key baarey mein kiya kaha jaa sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Wohh unko istemaal karney walon ki bahut si shikayaton ki wajah hein (They are the cause of many complaints from those who use them.)**

Here's why:

* **The Question's Focus:** The question highlights the contradiction: society relies on transportation systems, yet people consistently complain about them.
* **Option C directly addresses this core issue.** The passage explicitly states that people have complaints about transportation systems.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Unka istemaal karney wala har shakhs unsey achey sey mohabbat karta hay (Every person who uses them loves them dearly.)**  This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.
    * **B: Wohh paani key meyaar ki tarah kharaab nahein hein (They are not bad like water quality.)**  The passage doesn't compare transportation systems to water quality in terms of being ""good"" or ""bad."" It focuses on the *complaints* people have.
    * **D: Bahut sey taraqqi yaaftah mamalik mein wohh muft hein (In many developed countries, they are free.)** While some transportation might be free, that's not the central problem being discussed – the complaints about the system's performance.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, drivers ki gair motawaqqayiat ki wajah sey darjah zail mein sey kiska paimaanah karnaa mushkil ho sakta hay?","सही उत्तर है **D: Traffic ki rawani (Traffic की रवानी)**।

**व्याख्या:**

प्रश्न स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि ड्राइवरों की अनिश्चितता (drivers की गैर-मोटवाqqयiat) के कारण ट्रैफिक प्रवाह (traffic flow) का अध्ययन करना मुश्किल है। ड्राइवर की व्यवहार की भविष्यवाणी 100% निश्चितता के साथ नहीं की जा सकती।  

अन्य विकल्प इस प्रकार हैं:

* **Traffic ki raftaar (Traffic की रफ्तार):**  हालांकि ड्राइवरों की व्यवहार भविष्यवाणी करना मुश्किल है, ट्रैफिक की रफ्तार को सड़क की सीमा (speed limits) और अन्य भौतिक कारकों के आधार पर अनुमानित किया जा सकता है।
* **Sadak ki mansubah bandi (सड़क की मांसपेशी बांदी):** सड़क की मांसपेशी बांदी (road geometry) को डिजाइन के आधार पर तय किया जाता है और यह ड्राइवरों के व्यवहार से सीधे प्रभावित नहीं होती है।
* **Sadak ki amaliyaat (सड़क की अमलियात):** सड़क की अमलियात (road infrastructure) को भी डिजाइन और अन्य कारकों के आधार पर तय किया जाता है और यह ड्राइवरों के व्यवहार से सीधे प्रभावित नहीं होती है।

इसलिए, ड्राइवरों की अनिश्चितता के कारण ट्रैफिक प्रवाह (traffic flow) की भविष्यवाणी करना सबसे मुश्किल है।"
Riyaazi tor parr kisi traffic ki rwani ki nomaindagi kartey waqt darjah zail mein sey kiska istemaal kiya jata hay?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Sadak ka naqshah (Road network)**।

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* **Sadak ka naqshah (Road network):** यातायात प्रवाह को गणितीय रूप से मॉडल करने के लिए सड़क नेटवर्क की संरचना (जैसे सड़कों, चौराहे, आदि) का उपयोग किया जाता है। यह यातायात प्रवाह की मात्रा, गति और घनत्व का निर्धारण करने में मदद करता है।  इसलिए, यह ट्रैफिक प्रवाह का प्रतिनिधित्व करने के लिए उपयोग किया जाता है।

अन्य विकल्प क्यों गलत हैं:

* **Sadak ki amaliyaat (Road layout):** सड़क का लेआउट महत्वपूर्ण है, लेकिन यह ट्रैफिक प्रवाह का प्रतिनिधित्व करने के लिए मुख्य रूप से उपयोग नहीं किया जाता है।
* **Driver key soluk (Driver behavior):** ड्राइवर का व्यवहार जटिल और अप्रत्याशित हो सकता है। इसे सीधे तौर पर गणितीय मॉडल में शामिल करना मुश्किल है, हालांकि ड्राइवरों की आदतों को समझने की कोशिश की जाती है।
* **Traffic ki kasafat (Traffic density):** यातायात घनत्व एक महत्वपूर्ण कारक है, लेकिन यह ट्रैफिक प्रवाह का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करता है। यह केवल यह बताता है कि किसी विशेष क्षेत्र में कितने वाहन हैं।

इसलिए, सड़क नेटवर्क गणितीय मॉडल में ट्रैफिक प्रवाह का प्रतिनिधित्व करने के लिए सबसे उपयुक्त है।"
Hershey aur Chase ney apney DNA ki pewand kaaree karnay key liye kiya istemaal kiya thaa? ,"The correct answer is **D: Viruses**.

The passage states: ""Harshi aur ches nay eek bacteria mein apnay dna kee pewand kaaree karnay key liye, jaraseem khoron, yaa viruses kaa istemaal kiya.""  This directly translates to: ""Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages (viruses) to do DNA replication in a bacterium.""

While radioactive phosphorus and sulfur were used to label DNA and protein respectively, the *method* they used to *facilitate the interaction* between the DNA and the bacterium was viruses.
"
Kisi taghayyur ki bachon tak muntaqil honey ki salahiyat kiss cheez parr munhasir hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Agar khaliye jarsimi line hon (If the cells are germline)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that mutations in **germline cells** (cells involved in reproduction) are the only ones that can be passed on to offspring. Mutations in somatic cells (all other cells) can affect the individual but are not inherited.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jinyati mawaad ki ahmiyat (Importance of genetic material):** While genetic material is fundamental, the crucial factor isn't the material itself but *where* the mutation occurs.
* **C: Taghayyur ki qism (Type of mutation):** The type of mutation doesn't determine if it's heritable. Only the location matters.
* **D: Agar taghayyur khaliyah ki maut ka sabab ho sakta ho (If the mutation can cause cell death):**  Whether a mutation causes cell death is irrelevant to its heritability.  It only matters if the mutation occurs in a germline cell.



"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, taghayyuraat key motaddid asaraat kis parr munhasir nahein hotey hein?","The correct answer is **D: Motassirah taghayyur ki qism**

Here's why:

The passage states that changes in the germline cells (sperm and egg) can be passed on, while changes in somatic cells (other cells) can lead to cell death or cancer.  It also mentions that different types of changes can have different effects.

*   **A: jitna jinyati maaddah motassir hua hay** (How much genetic material is affected): While the *amount* of genetic material affected might influence the severity, the passage doesn't emphasize this as the primary factor determining the impact of changes.
*   **B: Agar motassirah khaliye jarasimi line hon** (If the affected cells are germline cells): The passage explicitly states that changes in germline cells *can* be passed on, but it *doesn't* say that this is the *only* thing that matters. It's a key factor, but not the *sole* determinant.
*   **C: Motassirah jinyati maaddah ki ahmiyat** (Importance of the affected genetic material):  The significance of the gene affected is important, but the passage highlights that *the type* of change itself influences the outcome.
*   **D: Motassirah taghayyur ki qism** (Type of affected change): The passage *directly* says that different types of changes can have different effects – leading to cell death or cancer in somatic cells, or being passed on in germline cells. This is the primary factor emphasized.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that the *type* of genetic change is a crucial factor, and not solely dependent on the amount of genetic material affected or whether the cells are germline.



"
Darjah zail mien sey kon iss baat ki wajah nahein hay kehh qadeem saqafaton mein bakriyaan rakhi jaati theen?,"The correct answer is **C: Unhoney ney suhbat pesh ki (They provided companionship)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Ancient cultures kept goats for easy access to milk, meat, and hides.  This directly addresses options A, B, and D.
* **Companionship is not mentioned.** The passage focuses on practical benefits (food and resources) rather than emotional ones. While animals can provide companionship, it wasn't the primary reason for their domestication according to the text.

Therefore, option C is the reason that is *not* supported by the passage."
Golf ka maqsad kis cheez ki kam sey kam miqdaar ko lenaa hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Stokes**.

The passage clearly states: ""Woh khiladi jo corse jeetnay key liye sab say kam **stroke** lagaata hay, yaa sab say kam galf club key swings lagaata hay.""  Therefore, the goal in golf is to have the lowest number of strokes.
"
"Eek golf corse parr, ghaas ko kahan parr ziyadah chota kata jaata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Sabz parr (On the fairway)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Woh khiladi jo corse jeetnay key liye sab say kam stroke lagaata hay, yaa sab say kam galf club key swings lagaata hay. Yeah khel ghas prr khela jaataa hay, aur surakh key ird gird kee ghas ko thodi der pehle hee kata gayaa hota hai aur isay **sabz** kehtay hain.""  This means the area around the holes (fairways) is cut short and kept green. While the grass around the holes (greens) is also kept short, the passage emphasizes the fairway being the area where the grass is specifically cut short. The passage doesn't mention anything specific about the 18th hole or the first half of the course."
Kisi tajarbah ka aam maqsad kiya hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek yaa ziyadah mumkanah mafruzey ko kahtam karnaa (To confirm or refute one or more hypotheses).**

Here's why:

The passage describes experiments as a tool to test hypotheses and potentially disprove them. While experiments *can* lead to understanding how the world works (B), and can generate questions (C) and guide scientific research (D), the primary *aim* of an experiment is to determine whether a hypothesis is supported or not.  Option A most directly reflects this fundamental purpose.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the *primary* goal:

* **B: Ye malum karnaa kehh duniya kaisey kaam karti hay (To know how the world works):** This is a broader goal of science, not specifically the aim of a single experiment.
* **C: Sawalaat laahiq karnaa (To raise questions):**  Experiments can *lead* to questions, but their main purpose isn't just question generation.
* **D: Sciency tahqiqi ki rahnumayi karnaa (To guide scientific research):**  Experiments contribute to guiding research, but again, it's not the immediate goal of a single experiment itself.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sciency tahqiqi ki rahnumayi karney mein kiss sey madad nahein milti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mumkanah mafruzey khatam karnaa (Possible hypotheses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the scientific method is used to understand how the world works, and it guides scientific research. It also mentions that experiments are used to test and potentially *reject* hypotheses.  The passage explicitly says experiments *help* to reject hypotheses and guide research.

Therefore, the question asks what *doesn't* help guide scientific research using the scientific method. While experiments help to test and often disprove hypotheses, the very *possibility* of hypotheses is a starting point for scientific inquiry.  You need hypotheses to test.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Akelaa sciency tariqah kaar (A single scientific method practitioner):** While one person might *use* the scientific method, the method itself is not the guide.  It's the process.
* **B: Moshahidaat karnaa (Making observations):** Observations are a crucial starting point for scientific inquiry and lead to questions.
* **D: Tajarbaat karnaa (Conducting experiments):** Experiments are a key part of testing hypotheses and gathering data to support or refute them.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, toofanon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Toofane gardo baad deegar toofanon sey chotey elaqon ko zad mein letey hein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Toofan deegar jarehana aandhiyon kee nisbat eek chhote elaqay ko apna nishanah banatay hain, magar woh apni rah mein aaney waali harr cheez ko tabaah karsakte hain.""  This means a storm *targets* a small area. It doesn't say storms *hit* smaller areas *in addition* to larger ones.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Toofan apney gardo nawaah mein har cheez ko tabaah karney ki salahiyat rakhtey hein:**  The passage clearly states they can destroy anything in their path.
* **C: Ziyadah tarr toofan teen ghanton sey ziyadah rahtey hein:** The passage says the most severe storms last *more than* three hours.
* **D: Kuch toofanon mein 300 meel fee ghantah tak ki hawayein ho skati hein:** The passage mentions winds up to 480 kilometers/hour (approximately 300 miles/hour).

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr ziyadah tar toofanon ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Wohh 480 meel fee ghantah key ird gird ki hawayein paida kartey hein.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Inn azeem aljussah toofanon mein 480 kilometer/ghantah (133 meal/second; 300 meter fee ghantah) tak kee hawayein mojud hain.""  This directly corresponds to option B, which mentions the wind speeds of 480 miles per hour.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Wohh aam tor parr teen ghantey jaari rahtey hein:** While the passage *does* mention some storms lasting over three hours, it's not a defining characteristic of *most* storms.  The passage focuses more on the intensity.
* **C: Wohh deegar toofanon sey baday elaqon ko motassir kartey hein:**  The passage mentions a *small* area being targeted, not a large area.
* **D: Wohh darakhton kon zameen sey ukhaadney ki salahiyat rakhtey hein:**  This is true, but it's just *one* of the many destructive capabilities described. Option B is a more fundamental aspect of what defines these storms.



"
16vein sadee mein insano ney darjah zail mein sey kisko karnaa shuru kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Lense banana**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that telescopes, which use lenses, were first made in the late 16th century in Europe.
* The passage also mentions that people had been using lenses for vision correction (glasses) for thousands of years.
* Therefore, the key innovation in the 16th century was the creation of lenses for telescopes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lense istemaal karnaa:** People had been using lenses *before* the 16th century (for glasses). The question asks what they *started* doing in the 16th century.
* **B: Ashyaa ko bada karnaa:**  While telescopes *do* make things appear bigger, the act of making lenses is the fundamental technology.
* **D: Doorbeenein bananaa:**  The passage says telescopes were *made*, not simply built. The creation of the lenses is the crucial step in telescope construction.



"
Lense istemaal karkey insaan kab tak ashyaa ko bada kartey rahe hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Hazaron salon tak**.

The passage states: ""Insaan hazaaron barson say bari beenayi key liye chashme banatay rahay hain aur isay istemaal kartay rahay hain."" This directly translates to ""Humans have been making and using glasses for good eyesight for thousands of years.""

While the telescope was a later invention, the passage explicitly mentions the use of lenses for vision correction for thousands of years.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, Muhammad ka ghaar unkey ruhaani aamal yaa aqdaar key baarey mein kiya kahtey hein?","The best answer is **B: Shoro sahgab sey baahar moraqabah mein madad mil sakti hay (Meditation can be helped by being away from noise and distractions.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the solitude and isolation of the cave.**  It explicitly states the cave is ""completely separate from the rest of the world"" and that ""little could be seen or heard about the world from the cave."" This highlights the importance of a quiet and isolated environment for contemplation.
* **The passage mentions Muhammad's deep interest in spiritual matters and his frequent visits to the cave for reflection.** This shows he actively sought out solitude to connect with the divine.
* **Option B directly reflects this key element:  seeking solitude (away from noise) to facilitate meditation (spiritual contemplation).**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Wohh sokun aur yaksui ki qadar kartey hein (They value peace and tranquility).** While Muhammad likely valued peace, the passage *primarily* highlights the *means* he used to achieve that peace – the isolation of the cave – rather than simply stating his appreciation for peace itself.
* **C: Unko bahut kam tanhayi key waqt ki zarurat thee (They needed very little time of loneliness).** The passage shows he *actively sought out* loneliness in the cave, implying he needed it, not that he needed little of it.
* **D: Wohh dikhney aur suney janey sey parishaan they (They were troubled by being seen and heard).** While solitude contributes to this, the passage doesn't *explicitly* state he was troubled by being seen and heard. The focus is on the benefit of being *away* from those things for spiritual growth.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, lohey ko sabsey pahley kis cheez key liye istemaal kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Patriyiaan (Rails)**.

The passage states: ""Cross ties kaa istemaal shuroo key daur mein kiya gayaa thaa taakeh patriyan apni jagah parr saabit rahein."" which translates to ""Cross ties were used at the beginning to keep the rails in place.""

While iron was eventually used for wheels, the passage explicitly states that cross ties were the first application of iron in the railway system.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, lakdi ki pahiyon ko lohey ki pahiyon sey keon tabdil kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Unko patriyon parr lohey key zariyah nichey pahnaya jaa rahaa thaa** (They were being worn down by the iron on the tracks).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lohay kee wajah say lakdi kee gaadiyon key pahiyon mein ziyadah zeebaish kee jaaney lagi. Aakhirkar, laktari key pahiyon ko lohay key pahiyon say tabdil kar diyaa gayaa..."" ( ...because of iron, wooden wheels were worn down more on the tracks. Finally, wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels...).

This directly indicates that the wooden wheels were being worn down by the iron tracks, leading to the eventual replacement.  The other options are not supported by the passage.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, roomaniyat key zamanah key doraan afraad ki kiss cheez ki shakal bani thee?","The correct answer is **B: Jografiyah (Geography)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Romanawiyat key tanazur mein, jografiye nay afraad ko dhaala...""  This translates to ""In the context of Romanesque literature, geography shaped people...""

The passage also mentions how geography influenced the traditions and culture of people, making them more aligned with the societal norms and laws of their place.  While culture and traditions are mentioned, the *shaping* of people is directly attributed to geography.

Darjah zail konsa bayaniyaan takniki azam key aam khiyaal ki akkasi nahein karta hay? ,"The correct answer is **B: Taknik ki taraqqi saqafat key zere asar motassir nahein hoti hay (Technology ki taraqqi saqafat key zere asar motassir nahein hoti hay).**

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""technology kee taraqqi bazaat khud eek aise raastay kee pairvi karti hay jo tehzeebi yaa seyasi asar say bala tar hoti hay, aur uss key badlay mein technology muashron parr aise asraat morattab karti hay jo samaji taur parr mashrut honey key bajaye maurusi hotay hein.""

This means that technology's development *is* influenced by cultural and political factors. The text goes on to give examples of how car development impacts road development and traffic accidents, highlighting the interplay between technology, society, and politics.

Options A, C, and D all align with the text's discussion of technology's impact on society, the influence of cultural factors, and the role of political power in technological development. Option B directly contradicts the text's claims.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon kamaan khinchney sey wabastah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Mendak parr shuru karnaa** (Starting from the frog).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the type of bow (upper or lower) is related to the sound produced (soft or strong).
* It also describes the visual appearance of the bows.
* However, starting from the frog is described as a method of *manipulating* the bow, not a characteristic *dependent* on the type of bow. The passage explains *how* to start, not *what* sound the starting point determines.

Therefore, starting from the frog is not directly linked to the sound the bow makes, unlike the other options.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein kon ziyadah narm aawaz sey wabastah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Uss jagah sey shuru karnaa jahaan aap ka haath kamaan ko pakdey huey hay**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Balayi kamaan aam taur parr naram aawaz paida karta hay..."" (The upward bow usually produces a soft sound...).  The passage then contrasts this with ""...zereen kamaan ziyadah mazboot aur purr jazm hota hay"" (the downward bow is much stronger and more resolute).

Let's break down the options:

* **A: Eek nichey ki taraf key kamaan ka nishaan (Downward bow mark):**  The passage states this is strong and resolute, *not* soft.
* **B: Kamaan khinchnaa (Pulling the bow):** The passage doesn't directly associate pulling the bow with a specific sound, but the context suggests the *direction* of the bow pull impacts the sound.
* **C: V ki tarah dikhney walaa eek nishaan (A mark that looks like a V):** The passage describes this as a soft sound.
* **D: Uss jagah sey shuru karnaa jahaan aap ka haath kamaan ko pakdey huey hay (Starting from the place where your hand is holding the bow):**  The passage links the *direction* of the bow (upward or downward) to the sound.  Where you *start* holding the bow doesn't directly dictate whether the sound is soft or strong.

Therefore, starting from the hand position is the least related to the soft/strong sound characteristic.

Fossils iss baat ko dikhataa hay kehh haath bilaakhir kiss darjah zail key liye buniyaadi tor parr istemaal honey key liye mowafiqat pazeer huey they?,"The correct answer is **B: Wazan bardaasht karnaa (Weight bearing)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Champenzi key haath paaon hajm aur lambayi mein yaksaan hotay hain aur uss kee binaa parr jab woh pichlay panjay parr chalta hay to haath mein bojh uthaa sakta hay."" (Chimpanzee hands and feet are the same in size and length, and when it walks on its knuckles, it can bear weight in its hands.)

This directly relates to the ability to bear weight.  The text also mentions the evolution of the wrist bones to support weight-bearing. While the other options might be possible uses of the hand, the text *primarily* focuses on its capacity for weight bearing.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Heraa pheri (Playing/Manipulating)** - While hands are used for manipulation, the text doesn't emphasize this as the key evolutionary step.
*   **C: Naqlo harkat (Transport/Movement)** - While hands aid in movement, the focus is on the ability to bear weight *while standing/walking on knuckles*.
*   **D: Ungliyaan key bal chalnaa (Fine motor skills/Finger dexterity)** - The text mentions small finger bones, but the overall emphasis is on the hand's ability to bear weight, not on the dexterity of the fingers.



"
Drajah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr chimpanzee key haath aur pair ki ungliyon ki wazahat kartaa hay? ,"The correct answer is **A: Wohh insaanon sey ziyada sidhee hoti hein (They are straighter than in humans)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Insani haath paaon say chhota hay, seedhay haathon aur pairon kee ungliyon kee chhoti haddiyon kee saath."" (Human hands and feet are smaller, with straighter fingers and toes).  This implies chimpanzee fingers are more curved and less straight than human fingers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Unkey haath aur pair size mein muktalif hotey hein (Their hands and feet are different in size):** The passage says chimpanzee hands and feet are the *same* size.
* **C: Wohh bojh uthaaney key liye istemaal hotey hein (They are used for lifting weight):** While chimpanzees *can* use their hands to lift, the passage doesn't focus on this. The key point is their finger structure.
* **D: Wohh buniyaadi tor parr heraa pheri key liye istemaal hotey hein (They are primarily used for climbing):** The passage doesn't state this is their primary use.  While useful for climbing, the focus is on the finger shape.



"
Intekhaab sey kiss pool key liye naya jiniyaati tanawwo hat jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Chipaa hua (Hidden)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tagayyur jadeed jinyati tabdeeli shaamil karti hay aur **intekhab usay izhaar kardah tagayyur key pool se hazaf karti hay**.""  This translates to ""New genetic changes are included, and **selection removes them from the pool of expressed changes**.""

Therefore, selection removes genetic variations from the *hidden* pool, not the expressed (visible) ones.  The hidden pool refers to the potential for variation that isn't currently being expressed in the phenotype.
"
Jiniyati tanawwo shaamil karney key liye konsa amal zimmah daar hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Taghayyur (Change)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tagayyur jadeed jinyati tabdeeli shaamil karti hay...""  This translates to ""New genetic change includes change...""  Therefore, **change (taghayyur)** is responsible for introducing genetic variation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alahedgi (Segregation):** While segregation is important in inheritance, it doesn't *introduce* new genetic variation. It separates existing genes.
* **B: Tarkibe nav (New Combination):**  New combinations of genes arise from sexual reproduction, but the *source* of the genes is genetic change (mutation).
* **D: Wazeh kardah (Clarified/Made Clear):** This option doesn't relate to the process of introducing genetic variation.



"
"Ebarat mein Malumaat ki buniyaad parr, inmein sey kisko “protein key masalah” ko hal karney key liye kisi langoor ko khaana chahiye?","The passage states that langurs in open fields have difficulty fulfilling their amino acid needs from plants because plant-based proteins are difficult for them to digest in their raw form. It then contrasts this with animal-based foods (insects, worms, eggs) which are easily digestible and contain all the necessary amino acids.

Therefore, the answer should be something that provides a good source of protein that is easily digestible.  Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Sookhi pattiyaan (Dry leaves):**  The passage implies that plants are problematic for getting complete protein. Dry leaves are likely to be low in protein and difficult to digest.
*   **B: Kachchi daalein (Raw pulses/legumes):** The passage explicitly says that plant-based proteins are difficult to digest *unless* they are processed (packed). Raw pulses would fit this description.
*   **C: Tiddiyaan (Termites):** The passage mentions insects, worms, and eggs as easily digestible sources of protein. Termites would fit this category.
*   **D: Phool ki daalein (Flower pods/legumes):** While legume pods *can* contain protein, the passage implies raw legumes are problematic. Flower pods might be similar.

Considering the information given, and the example of animals eating insects/worms/eggs for complete protein, **C: Tiddiyaan (Termites)** is the most suitable answer. The passage highlights that their ancestors solved the ""protein problem"" by eating a similar diet to what langurs do today (in open fields). Termites fit the profile of animal-based food described.



**Therefore, the correct answer is C: Tiddiyaan**"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, ahem amino acid ki kami ki wajah sey kon saa darjah zail masalah pesh aata hay?","The correct answer is **D: Maut**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mazeed baraan, aisa karnay mein nakami key khatarnaak nataij hosaktay hain: taraqqi mein kamee, ghezaiyyat kee kamee, aur aakhirkar **maut**.""  While the other options are consequences of amino acid deficiency, death is presented as the ultimate and most severe outcome. Therefore, it's the most accurate answer based on the passage's emphasis.
"
Kisi makhsus zaili saqafat key araakin aksar jamaat key saath apni wabastagi matlab hotaa hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Alamat ki eek shakal key tor parr tarz ka istemaal karkey** (Using style as a form of symbol).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Zeli saqafat key arkaan aksar apni rukniyat kaa esharah imtiyazi aur alamati tarz, **jismein fashion, khaas usloob aur boll chaal kaa istemaal kartay huay kartay hain**.""  This means subculture members often use specific styles (including fashion, language, and behavior) *as symbols* to indicate their affiliation and identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Morakkab karney ki koshish karkey** (Trying to complicate): The passage doesn't suggest subcultures try to complicate things.
* **B: Gardo nwah key har shakhs key eteqaad ki mowafeqat karkey** (By agreeing with the beliefs of every person in the mainstream): Subcultures often *differ* from the mainstream.
* **C: Samaji meyaraat ko qobool karkey** (By accepting social heritage): While subcultures are *part* of social heritage, they often selectively *accept* or *reject* aspects of it to form their own identity.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of the passage's meaning.

"Ebarat mein pesh kardah nazriyah key motabiq, eek bacha key saath kiya waqea ho sakta hay jiss ki shanakht eek nasli aqalliyat key saath hoti hay jo kehh dhamki aamez rawayyah mein mashgool honey keliye eek daqyanusi tasavvur hay?","The most likely and direct consequence based on the provided text is **A: Bachha dhamki aamez rawayyah mein bachney ki koshish karegaa (The child will try to avoid threatening behavior).**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Misal key taur parr, woh bachay jo nasli aqliyat key saath bator school mein achhaa nah karnay key pehchanay jaatay hain jo daqyanosi hay woh eek baar jab apni nasal say waabastah daqyanosi key baaray mein jaantay hain to school mein achhaa nahein karnaa chahte hain."" (For example, children who are identified as not performing well in school because of racial minority stereotypes, when they learn about stereotype threat related to their race, do not want to do well in school.)

* **Stereotype threat** is the fear of confirming a negative stereotype about one's group. The text implies this fear leads to a *reduction in performance* to avoid confirming the stereotype.  The child will naturally try to avoid the situation that triggers this fear.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Bachha key liye dhamki aamez rawayyah mien mashgool honey ka ziyadah imkaan hogaa (The child will have a greater chance of engaging in threatening behavior):** This is the *opposite* of what the text suggests. The text suggests the child will *avoid* the threatening behavior.
* **C: Bachha samaji halaat mein waapas ley legaa (The child will withdraw from social situations):** While possible, the text specifically links the situation to school performance and avoiding confirming a stereotype. Withdrawal isn't the most direct consequence.
* **D: Bachha deegar nasli aqalliyaton key saath mashgool honey sey inkaar kar degaa (The child will refuse to engage with other racial minorities):** There's no basis in the text to suggest this. The text is about *internalized* stereotype threat and its effect on *the child's own performance*.



Therefore, option A best reflects the likely reaction of a child facing stereotype threat as described in the text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, nasli daqyanusiyat key baarey mein eek bachha ki jaankari ka darjah zail mein sey kis parr asar pad sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Unka rawayyah (Their behavior)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage directly links awareness of racial stereotypes to behavioral changes.** It states that children who are identified as not performing well in school due to racial stereotypes *choose* not to perform well in school *after* learning about their stereotype. This directly implies that the awareness of the stereotype influences their behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Jiss nasli aqalliyat key saath shanakht karney ka wohh intekhaab kartey hein (The racial minority they choose to identify with):** While racial identification is a factor, the passage focuses on the *awareness* of stereotypes impacting behavior, not the act of choosing a racial identity.
* **C: Deegar bachhon key saath unkey talluqaat (Their relationships with other children):**  The passage doesn't directly link stereotype awareness to relationships with other children.  It focuses on the individual child's behavior in response to the stereotype.
* **D: Unki nasal ki pahchaan (Their racial identity):**  Similar to A, the passage doesn't primarily discuss the identity itself, but the *impact of awareness of stereotypes* connected to that identity.



Therefore, **behavior** is the most direct and accurately reflected consequence of the awareness of racial stereotypes as described in the passage.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kis key liye eek wahshi bachah ki mosalsal parwarish mumkin nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Mazboot guftagu karney ki maharatein (Strong communication skills)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how a ""ferrel"" or ""wild"" child is raised in isolation, often due to neglect or rejection.  The text explicitly states that wild children exhibit fear or indifference towards humans because they are raised by animals.

* **Aazadanah tor parr rahnaa (Living freely):**  The text mentions children being left to fend for themselves, implying free living is a possibility in their wild upbringing.
* **Alag rujhanaat (Separate inclinations):**  While the text describes a lack of social interaction, it doesn't say wild children lack individual preferences.
* **Samaji bechaini (Social anxiety):** The very definition of a ""ferrel"" child is a *lack* of social adjustment, not social anxiety. They are *uncomfortable* with humans due to their animal upbringing.
* **Mazboot guftagu karney ki maharatein (Strong communication skills):**  Communication skills are *learned* through interaction with humans. A wild child, raised by animals, would *not* develop strong communication skills.  This is the skill most fundamentally lacking in a wild child's development.



Therefore, the continuous upbringing of a wild child is *not* possible for developing strong communication skills.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr atfaal mein wahshi rawayyah ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Wahshi rawayyah samaajiyat ki kami ki wajah sey pinap sakta hay.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""iss tarah key atfaal """"ferrel"""" yaa wohshi kahlatay hain"" (children of this type are called ""ferrel"" or wild) *because they are not allowed to participate in social activities*. This directly links the lack of social interaction (""samaajiyat ki kami"") to the development of wild behavior (""wahshi rawayyah"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aksar wahshi rawayyah ki wajah jismaani kharaabi hoti hay (Often the cause of wild behavior is physical disability.)** - While the text mentions rejection of children's physical or mental disabilities as a reason for abandonment, it doesn't state that physical disability is the *primary* or *most common* cause of wild behavior.
* **C: Wahshi rawayyah sirf unn bachhon mein ghaalib hota hay jinn key waldain unhein mahdood rakhtey hein (Wild behavior is prevalent only in children whose parents restrict them.)** - While restriction can be a factor, the text emphasizes the *lack* of social activities as the core issue, not just restriction.
* **D: Tamaam wahshi rawayyah ki wajah sakht zahni mazooriyaan hoti hain (All wild behavior is due to harsh mental labor.)** - The text doesn't connect wild behavior to harsh mental labor. It centers on social isolation and lack of interaction.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsa amal maaash parr mabni zaraat key saath motawaatir hotaa hay?","The correct answer is **A: Aisi paidawaar parr tawajjoh denaa jo kisaan key khaandan ki zaruriyaat ko puraa karta ho.**

Here's why:

* **The passage defines ""Maashi Zaraat"" (subsistence farming) as farming focused on fulfilling the food needs of the farmer and their family.**  The core principle is meeting the household's requirements.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Deegar logon ko bechney key liye khaana tayyaar karnaa (Preparing food to sell to others):** This describes commercial farming, not subsistence farming. Subsistence farming is primarily for self-consumption.
* **C: Taraqqi yaaftah taknikon key barkhilaaf aala paidawaar parr twajjoh denaa (Focusing on high yield despite advanced techniques):** While subsistence farming can use efficient methods, the passage doesn't emphasize advanced techniques. It mentions simpler, traditional methods.  The focus is on meeting needs, not maximizing output at all costs.
* **D: Kisaan key elaagah key liye maqaami beejon ka istemaal karna (Using local seeds for the farmer's region):**  Using local seeds *can* be part of subsistence farming (as mentioned in the passage), but it's not the defining characteristic. The primary characteristic is focusing on the farmer's family needs.

Therefore, **A** is the only option directly aligned with the definition of Maashi Zaraat provided in the passage.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr maashi zaraat key amal ki wazahat karta hey?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuch mamalik mein abb bhi kisaan iska istemaal kartey hein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Tarikhi tor parr ziyadah tar kisaan rozi roty key liye zaraat mein masruf hotay aur abb bhee bahut say taraqqi pazeer mulkon mein yahee hall hai."" (Historically, most farmers were engaged in agriculture for their livelihood, and even now, this is the case in many developed countries.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeah puri tarah naamiyaati system hay (It is a purely rudimentary system):** While the passage describes ""maashi zaraat"" as simple, it doesn't say it's *purely* rudimentary.  It emphasizes maximizing yield within the limitations of the soil and available resources, which is a pragmatic approach, not necessarily purely basic.
* **B: Ismein faslein badhaney key liye munfarid taknikon ka istemaal hota hay (It involves the use of unique techniques to grow crops):** The passage specifically mentions using ""mahkuliyati nizam key maqami mahfuz kardah beej kaa istemaal"" (local preserved seeds from the ecological system), which implies using *traditional*, not unique, techniques.
* **C: Iss sey mahereene zaraat ko apney purey khittey mein apni faslein bantney ki ijazat milti hay (It allows farmers to divide their crops across their entire field):** The passage doesn't mention anything about dividing crops across the field. It's about utilizing the land efficiently within the constraints of the land's properties.



"
Kisi museum ka daurah karnaa seyahat key kis zumrah mein aaata hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Saqafati seyaahat (Cultural Tourism)**.

Here's why:

* **Saqafati seyaahat** focuses on visiting places to learn about the history, art, architecture, and traditions of a specific region or country. Museums are prime examples of locations dedicated to preserving and showcasing cultural heritage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Karobaari seyaahat (Business Travel):** This type of travel is for professional purposes, like meetings, conferences, or site visits related to work.
* **Tafreehi seyaahat (Recreational Tourism):** While visiting a museum can be enjoyable, the primary purpose is usually not just for recreation. Recreational tourism emphasizes leisure activities like amusement parks, beaches, and resorts.
* **Baahari seyaahat (Adventure Tourism):** This involves physically challenging activities and exploration of nature, like hiking, climbing, or wildlife safaris."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tafreehi mosaafiron key liye kiya cheez tarjeeh ban sakti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Apney rozaanah key maamul sey waqfah lenaa (Taking a break from your daily routine).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that recreational travel is about escaping the regular routine and finding peace and enjoyment. Option B directly reflects this core concept.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Maqaami saqafat mein khud ko dibo denaa (Immersing oneself in local culture):** While cultural immersion is a *part* of many recreational trips, the primary driver of recreational travel, according to the passage, is the desire for a break from routine.
* **C: Aham maqamaat dekhna (Visiting important landmarks):** This is a possible activity on a recreational trip, but not the defining characteristic.
* **D: Kisi jagah ki tareekh ko samajhna (Understanding the history of a place):**  Similar to landmarks, historical understanding can be a part of a trip, but not the essential element of recreational travel as described.

Ebarat mein kisi aisi cheez key tor parr kiya mazkoor hay jiss sey maqami church key andar ki tadili ko kam karney mein madad mili thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Karobaari rawayyah ki kamiyaab misaalon ko yaad karnaa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Iss misal mein, guzashta muhim karanah ravayye aur nateejatan milnay waali kamiyabi kee misalon ko yaad karnaa logon ko maqami church kee nayi tabdiliyon aur nayi samton kee jaanib mabzool karnay mein madadgaar saabit huwa."" (In this example, remembering significant past practices and the resulting successful examples proved helpful in guiding people towards the local church's new changes and new directions.)

Option A directly reflects this statement. While other options are mentioned in the passage, they are not the *specific* thing that helped facilitate change within the church.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Kisi shakhs ki apni tareekh ki samajh haasil karney sey kiss cheez key saath madad ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Tabdili key khauf ko kam karnaa** (Reducing the fear of change).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aisi kamiyab kahaniyan mustaqbil mein muisbat tabdeeli kaa rujhaan paida kartay hoay, tabdeeli key khauf ko kam karti hain."" (Such successful stories, while creating a preference for positive change in the future, reduce the fear of change).

While options B and C are related to the passage's themes, option A is the most directly and explicitly stated benefit of understanding one's history. Option D is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr taleem tak Maa baad jadidiyat pahunch ki wazahat kartaa hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Taleem mein koyi mutlaqaat nahein hein (There are no absolutes in education).**

Here's why:

The passage heavily emphasizes the limitations of traditional, top-down education. It argues that:

* **Post-modernism liberates us from a fixed, pre-determined way of learning.**  There isn't one ""right"" method.
* **Fear isn't helpful for learning.**
* **Knowledge is gained through experience.**
* **Television shows that promote action and results, rather than theoretical understanding, illustrate this point.**
* **Many people passively watch these shows without applying what they see to their lives.**

Option D directly reflects this sentiment. If there are no absolutes in education, then there's no single, universally correct method or set of principles. The passage argues against rigid, prescribed learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuch taleemi tajarbaat deegar ki banisbat ziyaadah fayedah mand hotey hein (Some educational experiences are more beneficial than others):** This implies a hierarchy of knowledge and learning methods, which is exactly what the passage is trying to challenge.
* **B: Taleem ki tawajjoh unn cheezon parr honi chahiye jinn parr hamarah yaqeen hay kehh hamein tajarbah haasil hogaa (Education should focus on things we believe will give us experience):**  This is a very narrow and potentially misleading view of education. The passage suggests learning should not be solely driven by the expectation of immediate experience.
* **C: Taleem key makhsus tariqey deegar sey behtar hein (Specific methods of education are better than others):** Again, this promotes a hierarchy and suggests that there is a superior method. The passage argues the opposite.



"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor par maa baad jadidiyat taleem ki pahunch ki akkasi nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Makhsus taleemi tajarbaat ko deegar par tarjeeh denaa chahiye (Special educational experiences should be prioritized over others.)**

Here's why:

The passage argues *against* prioritizing special educational experiences. It emphasizes that learning happens through experience and practical application, not necessarily through formal or structured learning.  It criticizes the idea of prioritizing special experiences because those experiences often aren't integrated into one's existing knowledge or applied in meaningful ways.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage's core ideas:

* **A: Malumaat haasil karney key motaddid tariqey hein (There are multiple ways to acquire information):** The passage implicitly supports this. It highlights experience as a primary way to acquire knowledge, suggesting that information can be gathered through various means.
* **C: Eek taleemi tajarbah ka inhesaar shikhney waaley aur pesh kardah ilm parr hota hay (The relevance of a learning experience depends on the learner and existing knowledge):**  This directly reflects the passage's central point - learning is most effective when it builds upon and connects with existing knowledge.
* **D: Aisa ilm jiska shayad hamm kabhi bhi itlaaq na karein wohh abb bhi sikhney key qaabil hay (Knowledge that we may never use is still capable of being learned):** The passage implicitly supports this. It argues that learning is valuable in itself, even if the knowledge isn't immediately applicable to a specific task.

Therefore, option B is the only one that contradicts the passage's overall argument.



"
"Aam nind key waqt key doraan jaan boojh kar bedaar honay key baad, inmein sey kon nind ki modakhelat key amal key saath modakhelat karegaa?","The correct answer is **D: Apni shabb bedaari mein bottle sey paani piney key liye bedaar honaa (Waking up to drink water from a bottle during the night)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Bio retham parr mabni deegar ekhtiyarat mein sonay say pehle kaafi miqdar mein sayyal mashrubaat (khaas tor par paani yaa chaye, peshaab mein izaafe kee baes) pina shaamil hay, jis say kisee ko bhee peshaab karnay key liye uthnay parr majboor honaa padta hay.""  Drinking water before bed is a common way to disrupt sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be disruptive, based on the passage:

* **A: Waapas soney jaaney sey pahley deidh ghantaa padhnaa (Reading for an hour and a half before going back to sleep):** The passage mentions reading *before* bed as a technique related to bio rhythm, not as a sleep disruptor *during* a night-time wake-up.
* **B: Gusul khanah istemaal karkey sidhey waapas soney jaana (Going straight back to sleep after showering):** The passage doesn't mention showering as a sleep disruptor.
* **C: Apni shabb bedaari mein alarm band karkey bees minaton baad waapas soney jaana (Turning off the alarm and going back to sleep after 20 minutes):** The passage outlines using an alarm to *prevent* sleep disruption by aiding in a smoother transition back to sleep.

Therefore, drinking water to go back to sleep is the action directly aligned with the passage's description of a sleep-disrupting behavior.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon nind ki modakhelat ki durust wazahat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Bedaar honey key baad, maqsad do ghantah key andar waapas soney janaa hota hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the goal is to *avoid* being fully awakened.**  It's about briefly interrupting sleep, not aiming to go back to sleep within two hours.
* **The passage mentions a 10-60 minute window for going back to sleep.** This doesn't imply a two-hour timeframe after waking.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Yeah hayati ahang parr mabni ho sakta hay (It can be based on your biological rhythm):** This is true. The passage discusses using alarms and behavioral changes, both of which can be tailored to your body's natural sleep-wake cycle.
* **B: Maqsad apney aap ko puri tarah bedaar na karnaa hay (The goal is not to fully wake yourself up):** This is a core principle of the technique described in the passage.
* **C: Yeah amal aapki aam nind key waqt key doraan waqea hota hay (This practice happens during your normal sleep time):**  The passage clearly states this is a technique used *during* your typical sleep period.



Therefore, option D is the inaccurate description of the sleep interruption technique.

"Jabb dimaagh ziyaadah kasrat key saath khawaab ko ujaagar krney ki koshish karta hay, to kiya cheez badh jaata hay?","The correct answer is **D: REM kaifiyaat key darmiyaan ka waqt (The duration of REM quality)**.

Here's why:

The text states that when the brain tries to make dreams more vivid, it's tiring. This is because the brain is actively working to process and maintain these elaborate dreams.  REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is the stage where most vivid dreaming occurs.  The more the brain tries to make dreams clear and detailed, the longer the REM phase is likely to be, and the more energy it consumes. Therefore, the duration of REM sleep increases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: REM kaifiyaat ki miqdaar (The amount of REM quality):** The text doesn't suggest the *quality* of REM increases, just the *duration*.
* **B: Energy ki sathein (Energy levels):**  The text says dreaming vividly *drains* energy, it doesn't say energy levels increase.
* **C: Baziyaabi kaifiyat ki tewaalat (The extension of recovery quality):** The focus here is on the *dreaming* process, not the recovery aspect of sleep.

Darjah zail konsey manfi asaraat jo aksar khawaab dekhney ko ujaagar kar skatey hein ka jism parr asar hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: REM kaifiyaat key darmiyaan waqt ki ghati hui tewaalat (Reduced duration of REM during the process)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that lucid dreaming, especially when frequent, can be very tiring due to the brain's prolonged activity during REM sleep. It likens it to being repeatedly awakened during sleep.  Therefore, *reduced duration of REM during the process* is the most directly linked negative effect mentioned as contributing to the fatigue.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Fee raat ghatey huey REMs (Fewer REMs per night):**  The passage doesn't say fewer REMs are the problem; it's the *prolonged duration* of REM *during* lucid dreaming that causes the fatigue.
* **C: Khawab dekhney ko ujaagar karney parr inhesaar (Inhibition of dreaming when trying to be aware):** This is about the *attempt* to lucid dream, not a direct physiological effect on the body resulting from lucid dreaming itself.
* **D: Fee raat badha hua REMs (Increased REMs per night):** The passage suggests that lucid dreaming is tiring *despite* being in REM sleep, not *because* of more REM sleep.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, rewaayati teemein aur majazai teemein eek jaisi keon hein?","The correct answer is **B: Dono teamon mein apney roz baroz key mamulaat mein mukhtalif satah ki khud mukhtaari hay**

Here's why:

* The passage states that virtual teams have *more* autonomy than traditional teams because members can work in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
* It also mentions that traditional team members have *less* autonomy compared to virtual team members.
* Therefore, the key similarity highlighted is the *difference* in autonomy levels between the two types of teams, implying that both have varying degrees of autonomy within their daily operations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dono teamon key baarey mein tawaqqo hay kehh eek hi satah parr kar kardagi karein gee** - The passage doesn't mention expectations of equal performance.
* **C: Dono teamein eek basari bandobast team ko report karti hein** - The passage only describes non-hierarchical virtual teams, which lack a traditional reporting structure.
* **D: Dono teamein eek hi mintaqah waqt mein kaam karti hein** - The passage explicitly states the opposite – virtual teams often work across different time zones.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad par, jismaani aur majaazi teamon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Rewayati teamein aam tor parr eek ziyadah aal meyaar key liye banayi jaati hein**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Virtual team key arkaan aksar apnay qareebi maaddi group keliye raabtah kaa kam kartay hain. Inn mein rewayati team key arkaan kee nisbat ziyadah khud mukhtari hoti hay kiyon keh inn kee teams mukhtalif mintaqah waqat mein mill sakti hain jo inn kee maqami intezamiya nahein samajh sakti."" This implies that traditional teams are *often* built around close physical proximity and therefore have *less* autonomy than virtual teams. The text *doesn't* say they are built around a higher standard or quality.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **B: Majazi teamein aksar rewayati teamon key rabtah key noqtah key tor parr kaam karti hein:** The text says ""Virtual team key arkaan aksar apnay qareebi maaddi group keliye raabtah kaa kam kartay hain"" meaning virtual teams *less often* rely on close physical proximity for connection, unlike traditional teams.
* **C: Rewayati teamon mein majazi teamon ki banisbat kam khud mukhtaari hoti hay:** The text directly states ""Inn mein rewayati team key arkaan kee nisbat ziyadah khud mukhtari hoti hai"" (Autonomy is higher in traditional teams than virtual teams).
* **D: Mukhtalif waqt key mintaqon sey majazi teamon ko faayedah pahunch sakta hay:** The text states ""kiyon keh inn kee teams mukhtalif mintaqah waqat mein mill sakti hain"" (because teams can meet at different times in different regions). This clearly indicates a benefit of virtual teams originating from different time zones/regions.



Therefore, option A is the only statement contradicted by the given text."
Darjah zail mein sey kon koyi aisi cheez nahein hay jiss parr mashmool key nazriyaat markooz hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Bolughat mein amali bananey waali nayi khawahishein (New desires that are realized in adulthood).**

Here's why:

The passage focuses on:

* **Internal needs and desires** that arise as people mature.
* **Factors influencing behavior:**  Why people *do* things and what influences them.
* **The role of environment:** How the surroundings impact choices.
* **Understanding preferences.**

While adulthood brings new desires, the passage doesn't explicitly center on the *realization* of those desires as a key focus of the theories.  The theories discussed are more about *identifying* the underlying needs and motivations, not necessarily the actual fulfillment of those needs in adulthood.  The other options (B, C, and D) directly align with the themes presented in the passage.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon teesron key qaedon ka maful nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek buniyaadi line banana jahan key liye faayel ko rakhaa jaa sakey** (Creating a basic line where the file can be placed).

Here's why:

The provided text describes the rule of thirds in visual composition. This rule suggests dividing an image into nine equal parts with two horizontal and two vertical lines. The key idea is that placing important elements along these lines or at their intersections creates a more visually appealing and balanced composition.

* **B: Eek tasweer key andar zindagi aur taqat bananaa (Creating life and energy within a picture):** This aligns with the rule of thirds. By strategically placing elements, you guide the viewer's eye and create a sense of dynamism.
* **C: Faayel ko makhsus aur moassir maqaam mein rakhnaa (Placing the file in a special and effective position):**  This is directly related to the rule of thirds, as it emphasizes using the lines and intersections to find a strong focal point.
* **D: Kisi tasweer mein tarteeb qayem rakhnaa (Maintaining order in a picture):** This is a general principle of good composition, and the rule of thirds contributes to order and balance.

**Option A, however, is not a direct application of the rule of thirds.**  Creating a basic line for file placement is more about practical file organization rather than compositional technique. While file placement *could* be done *within* a rule of thirds composition, the act of simply creating a line for placement isn't inherently linked to the principle itself.

Darjah zail mein sey kon 35mili meter ki shakal ki wazahat nahein kartaa hay?,"सही जवाब है **D: Yeah duniya mein sabsey aam shakal hay (यह दुनिया में सबसे आम आकार है)**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है कि अन्य विकल्प सही हैं और विकल्प D गलत क्यों है:

* **A: Yeah abb bhi tayyaari mein hay (यह अभी भी तैयार में है)** - यह कथन सही है। 35mm फ़िल्म और फ़ॉर्मेट अभी भी उपयोग में हैं।
* **B: Iski mowafiqat dijital camera ki shaklon sey hoti hay (इसकी अनुकूलता डिजिटल कैमरा की आकृतियों से होती है)** - यह कथन भी सही है। डिजिटल कैमरों के इमेज सेंसर अक्सर 35mm फ़ॉर्मेट के समान आस्पेक्ट रेशियो का उपयोग करते हैं।
* **C: Ismein bahut si aam shaklon ki banisbat eek mukhtalif pahlu ka tanasub hay (इसमें बहुत सी आम आकृतियों की बनिस्बत एक मुक्तलिफ़ पहलू का आस्पेक्ट रेशियो है)** - यह कथन भी सही है। 35mm फ़ॉर्मेट का आस्पेक्ट रेशियो (3:2) कई अन्य फ़ॉर्मेट से अलग है।
* **D: Yeah duniya mein sabsey aam shakal hay (यह दुनिया में सबसे आम आकार है)** - यह कथन गलत है। जबकि 35mm फ़ॉर्मेट लोकप्रिय है, यह दुनिया में सबसे आम आकार नहीं है। आजकल, स्मार्टफोन कैमरे और अन्य डिजिटल कैमरे अक्सर अलग-अलग आस्पेक्ट रेशियो का उपयोग करते हैं, जैसे कि 16:9 या 4:3।

इसलिए, विकल्प D 35mm फ़ॉर्मेट की व्याख्या को सही ढंग से नहीं दर्शाता है।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jabb tayyaar karney walon ney lens key masnuah key meyaar ko badha dety hein, to zoom lenso ko behtar kaisey kiya gaya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Unka tasveeri meyaar tay shudah focal lambayi waley lenson key momasil hota hay**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iss nay zoom lenses ko aisi meyari tasavir pesh karnay key qaabil banaya hai jo keh muqarrar kardah tool masakah lenses say haasil kee jaaney waali tasavir key muqabilay kee hon."" (This has enabled zoom lenses to produce images of quality that are superior to those produced by fixed focal length lenses.)

This directly indicates that improved manufacturing quality has allowed zoom lenses to match or surpass the image quality of prime (fixed focal length) lenses. Options A, B, and D discuss aperture, low-light performance, and focal length confusion, but they don't capture the core point that the image *quality* has improved to the point of competing with prime lenses.
"
"Ebarat mein malumaat ki buniyaad parr, zoom lens ko ibtadayi lens parr kabb tarjeeh dee jaa sakti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Agar aala ziyaadah sey ziyaadah suraakh tarjeeh ho** (If a larger aperture is preferred).

Here's why:

* The passage states that a major advantage of zoom lenses is their ability to produce high-quality images that surpass fixed focal length lenses. This is directly linked to their *larger aperture (speed)*.
* The passage also mentions that a drawback of zoom lenses is their potentially smaller aperture compared to prime lenses (although this is contradictory and likely a typo - it should be that zoom lenses *can* have smaller apertures). However, it emphasizes that they *can* achieve good results even with a smaller aperture, making the aperture a key factor.
* The passage explicitly states that flash photography in low light is difficult with zoom lenses due to their aperture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agar aap ko kam lens key anaasir chahiyein** (If you want fewer lens elements):  Zoom lenses have *many more* lens elements than fixed focal length lenses.  This is stated directly in the passage.
* **C: Agar aap ziyadah tareek tartibaat mein flash na istemaal karna chahtey hon** (If you don't want to use flash in complex arrangements): This is directly contradictory. The passage states that using flash is *difficult* with zoom lenses.
* **D: Agar aap mazeed focal uljhan ki talaash kar rahey hon** (If you are looking for more focal confusion):  The passage says zoom lenses can cause *focal length confusion*, which isn't a positive attribute.


Therefore, the only option that aligns with the advantages presented in the passage is **A**.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko tasavvuf ki durust wazahat nahein samjha jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ismein pur aman aur khush kun aagahi ki kaifiyaat key tajarbah parr takid hoti hay** (It emphasizes the experience of peaceful and joyful awareness).

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes *direct, experiential realization* of the divine, spiritual truth. While peaceful and joyful states *can* be a part of this journey, the text stresses that Sufism isn't *solely* about these feelings. It encompasses a broader range of experiences:

*   **Direct Experience (Barahe raast zaati tajruba):**  This is a core element,  the text explicitly mentions it multiple times.
*   **Spiritual Awareness (Roohani sachayi ki bedaar aagahi):** Sufis seek to awaken to the truth.
*   **Practices (Aamal):**  They follow certain practices to nurture this awareness.
*   **States of Ecstasy (Halat wajd):**  While not the only state, ecstatic experiences are mentioned as a manifestation.

Option A focuses too narrowly on ""peaceful and joyful awareness"" as the primary characteristic of Sufism. The text positions this as *one* aspect among others, not the defining one. Options B, C and D align more closely with the multifaceted view of Sufism presented in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon tasavvuf ka markaze tawajjoh nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Bedaari ki khush kun kaifiyat parr takid (Emphasis on the pleasant sensation of awakening)**.

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes that Sufism focuses on *experiential* knowledge of the divine, spiritual realities, and the ultimate truth (Haqeeqat). It highlights seeking understanding through sincere experience, intuitive perception (badhi), and direct realization. The text specifically mentions the experiences of peaceful, insightful, joyful, and even ecstatic (wajd) individuals.

While *wajd* (ecstasy) can be a part of the Sufi path, the text emphasizes the deeper, core aspects of seeking ultimate reality and understanding God.  Focusing solely on the pleasant sensations of awakening is considered a less central focus within the broader Sufi perspective as outlined in the text.  Sufism isn't necessarily about the *feeling* of awakening; it's about the *understanding* and *realization* that comes with it.

Let's look at why the other options *are* central:

* **A: Elahee haqeeqat mein wajdaan haasil karna (Achieving ecstasy in divine reality):**  Wajd is mentioned as a manifestation of Sufi experience.
* **B: Mushatarekah, firqah waraanah tajrabaat key zariyah baseerat ka taaqub karnaa (Pursuing insight through shared and sectarian experiences):**  The text mentions seeking knowledge through experiences, both individual and communal.
* **D: Khuda key baarey mein bedaar aagahi ka taaqub karnaa (Pursuing awakened knowledge about God):** This directly aligns with the overall theme of seeking direct knowledge of the divine.



Therefore, option C is the least central focus according to the given text's description of Sufism."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, zaraati samaaj kis ney shuru kiya hogaa?","The correct answer is **C: Polynesia key Maori log**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iskay baad nazariyah nay yeah raaye qayem kee keh maawari logon nay eek azeem bahri beday mein polynesia say naql makaani kee thee aur zarayi muashirah qayem karnay keliye moriori logon say New Zealand ko chheen लिया thaa.""

This translates to: ""After that, a view arose that the Maori people had migrated by sea in a large fleet from Polynesia and seized New Zealand from the Moriori people to establish an agricultural society.""

Therefore, according to the passage, the Polynesia-based Maori were the ones who initiated the agricultural society in New Zealand by migrating there.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, moas kaa shikaar karney waali jamaat kis jagah key pahley bashindey they?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

The passage states: ""Onneeswein aur beeswein sadee key doraan eek taweel arse tak yeah samjha jaataa rahaa keh New Zealand key pehle baashinde maawari log they jo maawas naami baday parinday shikaar kartay they."" which translates to ""For a long time during the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were the Maori people who hunted large birds called moas.""  Therefore, the Maori people were considered the first inhabitants of New Zealand.

kiss manzarnaamah mein Pureland key origami key tariqah ka istemaal karney sey tah karney waley ko fayedah hogaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Tah karney waala yakbaargi mutaddid tahein bananey ko tarjeeh detaa hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""Peevar lend auree gaimi"" as a simple origami method with straight folds.** It's designed for beginners and those with limited motor skills.
* **The key phrase is ""ees mein ultay tahon waali ziyadah pechidah tahon nahein lagayi jasakti""** (it doesn't involve complex reverse folds).
* **The passage specifically mentions it was created to help inexperienced folders.**
* **Option A states that the folder prefers to make single-layered (yakbaargi) multiple pieces (mutaddid tahein).** This aligns perfectly with the simple, straightforward nature of the ""Peevar lend auree gaimi"" method, which is likely best suited for creating multiple simple objects rather than complex, multi-layered designs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tah karney waala mein taraqqi yaaftah motor ki maharatein hein** (The folder has developed motor skills).  This is the *opposite* of who the method is intended for.
* **C: Tah karney waala origami bana rahaa hay jisko ulti tahein darkaar hoti hein** (The folder is making origami that requires reverse folds). The passage explicitly says it *doesn't* use reverse folds.
* **D: Tah karney waley ney isey sirf eek yaa do baar aazmaya hay** (The folder has only tried it a few times). This is irrelevant to the method's suitability.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr Pureland origami ka wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Iss tariqah mein ulti tahein shaamil hein**.

Here's why:

The description of Pureland origami explicitly states: ""iss mein ultay tahon waali ziyadah pechidah tahon nahein lagayi jasakti"" which translates to ""in it, complex folds with reverse folds cannot be made.""

Option B directly contradicts this statement by claiming that reverse folds are involved in this type of origami. All the other options align with the description:

* **A: Yeah tajarbah kaar tah karney waalon key liye matlub hay** (It's intended for experienced folders): The description mentions it's for those with limited motor skills.
* **C: Tahon mein seedhi jaghon ka hona zaruri hay** (Straight lines are necessary in the folds): This is directly mentioned in the description.
* **D: Mahdood motor ki maharatein waley Tah karney walon key liye yeah eek achha tariqah hay** (This is a good method for folders with limited motor skills):  This is explicitly stated in the description.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Konsi jagah sindh waadi ki tahzeeb key saath wabastah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Shumaal mashriqi Afghanistan key tamaam khittey**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Sindh Valley Civilization was located in the *northwestern* parts of Sindh, *northwestern* India, and *northeastern* Afghanistan.  Option C refers to *all* of northeastern Afghanistan, which is a region mentioned as part of the civilization's territory. The passage doesn't say it *wasn't* associated with Sindh Valley Civilization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Harappa:** The passage mentions that the first archaeological site of this civilization was discovered in the 1920s, which is related to the Harappan Civilization, which is a part of the Indus Valley Civilization, of which Sindh Valley Civilization is a part. Therefore, Harappa is connected to the Sindh Valley Civilization.
* **B: Sarasvati nadi:** The passage states the civilization flourished in the plains of the Indus River, and since the Sarasvati River's basins were also inhabited, some scholars suggest it should be called the Sindh-Sarasvati civilization. Thus, the Sarasvati River is connected.
* **D: Bahut saa jadid daur ka Pakistan:** The passage states that a significant portion of modern-day Pakistan (northwestern parts) was part of the Sindh Valley Civilization. Therefore, it is connected.



"
Ebarat mein bahas kardah Bronze Age ki tahzeeb key liye mumkanah naam key tor parr darjah zail mein kon mazkoor nahein hay,"The correct answer is **A: Harappan tahzeeb**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the ""Waadi Sindh kee tehzeeb"" (Indus Valley Civilization/Harappan Civilization) was a Bronze Age civilization in the region.
* However, the passage also distinguishes this civilization from the ""Sindh-Sarasvati tehzeeb,"" suggesting they might be considered distinct, even if related.
* Options B, C, and D are all names or aspects of the same Bronze Age civilization discussed in the passage.  ""Sindh-Sarasvati tehzeeb"" is a name for the civilization. ""Daryaaye Sindh ki tehzeeb"" (Civilization of the Indus River) refers to the civilization's location and connection to the river. ""Sindh waadi ki tehzeeb"" (Civilization of the Indus Valley) is another way of referring to the same civilization.

Therefore, ""Harappan tahzeeb"" isn't *mentioned as a possible name* *in the context of the debate* within the passage. While synonymous, the passage frames it with a bit of distance compared to the ""Sindh-Sarasvati tehzeeb"".



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsi paidawaar taweel muddat tak faayedah deti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Deegar logon key saath taawun karnaa (Cooperation with others)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes cooperation:** The passage explicitly states that "" ziyadah tar log mahsus karein gay keh inn kaa taweel muddati behtareen ekhtiyar doosron key saath mill karr kam karnaa hay"" - meaning most people will realize that the best long-term choice is to work together with others.
* **The passage criticizes selfishness:** It highlights the negative aspect of ""Khud gharzi say kam karkay hamesha ziyadah fayedah uthaya jaye ga"" – suggesting prioritizing self-interest ultimately leads to less benefit.
* **Long-term benefit of cooperation:** Cooperation, by definition, aims for mutual benefit and creates a stronger, more sustainable outcome than purely individual efforts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kisi key zaati mafaad ko tarjeeh denaa (Prioritizing individual self-interest):** This is the opposite of what the passage advocates.
* **C: Iss parr zor denaa kehh aksariyat parr aqalliyat kiya fayedah pahunchey gaa (Emphasizing that the minority benefits the majority):** This isn't directly mentioned in the passage and doesn't align with the core message of cooperation.
* **D: Yeah shanakht karnaa kehh lalach fayedah mand ho sakti hay (Recognizing that greed can be beneficial):** The passage implies that greed is *not* beneficial in the long run.



Therefore, **cooperation with others** is the choice that best reflects the passage's message about achieving long-term benefit."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko koyi shakhs tarjeeh dey sakta hay agar uski tawajjoh fauri fawaayed parr hay?","The correct answer is **D: Khud garzi (Selfish)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that greed and selfishness are always present.** It states that most people aim to maximize short-term personal gain.
* **""Khud garzi"" directly translates to ""selfish"" or ""self-serving.""** The passage explicitly mentions that those focused on short-term gains will prioritize their own benefits.
* **The passage discourages excessive selfishness** and suggests collaboration for long-term benefits, but it acknowledges that short-term focus often leads to selfish behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Be garzi (Non-selfish):** This is the opposite of what the passage describes as common.
* **Ishteraak (Cooperation/Mutual Benefit):** The passage suggests that cooperation is better in the long run, but it's not the option someone prioritizing *fauri fawaayed* (immediate benefits) would prefer.
* **Taawun (Collaboration/Cooperation):**  Similar to ""ishteraak,"" collaboration is presented as a long-term solution, not a focus for those seeking instant gains.



Therefore, someone focused on immediate benefits would prioritize **""Khud garzi"" (selfishness)**."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jang key ikhrajaat key ahem hissah ka kisney ihaatah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Filipini log (Filipino people)**.

The passage states: ""Filpine parr fateh mein ameriki samrajiyat key jangi ikhrajat khud filpino afraad nay adaa kiye they..."" which translates to ""In the Philippine war of fate, the Filipino people themselves paid the war expenditures...""

The passage further clarifies that the funds were paid through bonds, but the *people* were the ones who ultimately bore the financial burden. While the government and banks were involved in the mechanism of repayment, the Filipino people were the ones who generated the wealth through labor that funded the war and subsequently paid the debt.
"
Templars key ahed sey pahley kiss waqt ka dor aaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Shuruaati qoroone wustaa (Early Middle Ages)**.

The text states that the period in which the Templars existed falls within the Early Middle Ages (11th, 12th, and 13th centuries). Therefore, the period *before* the Templars would be the earlier part of that period – the Early Middle Ages.
"
Templars key ahed key baad kiss waqt ka dor aaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Akhir qoroone wustaa (Late Middle Ages)**.

The text states that the period after the early Middle Ages was the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500. Since the Templars were active during the early Middle Ages, the period after them would logically be the Late Middle Ages.
"
Konsa tibbee elaaj yaa tariqah kaar iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh usey roomi slatanat key doraan doctor aur jarraah istemaal kartey they?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Scopolamine के लिए भांग की बीजों की निचोड़ का इस्तेमाल करना**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

*   प्रश्न में उल्लेख है कि रोमन डॉक्टर्स अफिम और हरबीन के बीजों से स्कपोलमाइन निकालने के बारे में जानते थे। भांग के बीजों से स्कपोलमाइन निकालने का उल्लेख नहीं है।

अन्य विकल्प प्रश्न में उल्लिखित चिकित्सा प्रथाओं से संबंधित हैं:

*   **A: तकलीफ के बाद वाली तनाव की खराबी का متعدد सुकून अवार दवाओं के साथ इलाज करना:** प्रश्न में उल्लेख है कि रोमन डॉक्टर्स विभिन्न प्रकार की दवाओं का उपयोग करते थे।
*   **C: शर्यानो के अनबार वाले खून के बहाओ को रास्ता देना:** प्रश्न में उल्लेख है कि रोमन डॉक्टर्स खून के बहाव को जारी रखने के लिए अंगों को काटना जानते थे।
*   **D: बेहोश मरीजों के लिए कात पीट अंजाम देना:** प्रश्न में उल्लेख है कि रोमन डॉक्टर्स शरीर की संरचना, रक्त वाहिकाओं को बंद करने और रक्त का प्रवाह बनाए रखने के लिए अंगों को काटना जानते थे।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko Saltanate rome key doraan tibbee maidaan mein ki gayee taraqqiyaat ki taraf mansub nahein hay?","सही उत्तर है **B: सल्तनत की जारेहानह फौजी पॉलिसी (Sultanate ki Jaarehanah Foji Policy)**।

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

*   **टेक्स्ट में उल्लेखित विकास:** टेक्स्ट स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि सल्तनत रोम ने चिकित्सा के क्षेत्र में प्रगति की, जिसमें डॉक्टरों की भर्ती करना, युद्ध के बाद उपयोग के लिए पहला रोमन चिकित्सा संकलन बनाना, विभिन्न दर्द निवारक दवाओं का ज्ञान (जैसे अफीम और स्कॉपोलामाइन), और जान बचाने के लिए अंगों को काटने में विशेषज्ञता शामिल है।

*   **विकल्पों का विश्लेषण:**
    *   **A: चिकित्सा ग्रंथों की रचना (Tibbee daston ki tashkeel):** टेक्स्ट में उल्लेख है कि रोमन चिकित्सा संकलन बनाया गया था, जो चिकित्सा ग्रंथों की रचना का एक रूप है।
    *   **B: सल्तनत की जारेहानह फौजी पॉलिसी (Sultanate ki Jaarehanah Foji Policy):** टेक्स्ट में सैन्य नीति का कोई उल्लेख नहीं है। यह विकल्प चिकित्सा प्रगति से संबंधित नहीं है।
    *   **C: शैक्षिक अस्पतालों की स्थापना (Taleemi haspatalon ki tashkeel):** टेक्स्ट में यह उल्लेख है कि डॉक्टरों की भर्ती की गई थी, जो अस्पताल प्रणाली की स्थापना का संकेत हो सकता है।
    *   **D: सल्तनत के डॉक्टरों की नियमितता (Saltanat ki doctron ki takarruri):** टेक्स्ट में डॉक्टरों की भर्ती का उल्लेख है, जो डॉक्टरों की नियमितता स्थापित करने की प्रक्रिया का एक हिस्सा हो सकता है।

इसलिए, ""सल्तनत की जारेहानह फौजी पॉलिसी"" चिकित्सा प्रगति से संबंधित नहीं है और टेक्स्ट में इसका उल्लेख नहीं किया गया है।"
Kiss salahiyat parr inhesaar ko dekhnaa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Makhsus lahar ki lambayion key liye hassasiyat (Sensitivity to specific wavelengths of light)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mukhtalif tamirati hacklonb kee mukhtalif salahiyatein hoti hain, woh mukhtalif tool kee lahar key liye hissaas hotay hain..."" which translates to ""Different photoreceptor cells have different abilities, they are sensitive to different wavelengths of light...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Basari nizaam key aazaa (Parts of the visual system):**  While the photoreceptors are *part* of the visual system, the passage is focusing on their specific sensitivity, not the parts themselves.
* **B: Hayatiyaat ki zaruriyaat (Physiological needs):**  The passage doesn't discuss physiological needs at all.
* **D: Tez nigaahi key mukhtalif darjey (Different degrees of acute vision):** While vision acuity is related to the visual system, the passage focuses on the *sensitivity* of the photoreceptors to different wavelengths, not the degree of clarity achieved.

Hayatiyaat keyn darmiyaan ankh ki saakht ka tanawwo kiss cheez parr munhasir hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Toole mauj ki hassasiyat (Wavelength sensitivity)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Aankhon kee bahut see mukhtalif sakhtein hain jo jaandar kee zaruriyat parr inhesaar kartay hoay pecheedgi mein mukhtalif hadein rakhtay hain. Mukhtalif tamirati hacklonb kee mukhtalif salahiyatein hoti hain, woh mukhtalif tool kee lahar key liye hissaas hotay hain...""  This directly translates to: ""There are many different strengths of vision that, while yielding to the needs of the individual, have different limits in complexity. Different visual receptors have different abilities; they are sensitive to different wavelengths of light...""

Therefore, the variation in eye structure during a person's life depends on their **sensitivity to different wavelengths of light**. Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the text. While life needs and complexity influence vision, the fundamental basis of structure variation is wavelength sensitivity.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sikh mazhab key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr mazhab ki tasveer kahsi nahein karti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Sikh mazhab hindu rewayat key andar firqah ki ee tafreeq ka natijah thaa** (Sikh religion was a result of a sectarian division within Hindu traditions).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the opposite.** It says Sikhism arose in the Punjab region around the 15th century as a *difference* from the ancient Hindu religion. It emphasizes that Sikhs consider their faith distinct, even while acknowledging Hindu foundations and traditions.
* **Options B, C, and D are all consistent with the text.**
    * **B:** The passage clearly states that the Guru is a fundamental aspect of Sikhism.
    * **C:** The passage says that nine gurus followed Guru Nanak.
    * **D:** The passage explicitly says that Sikhism's special traditions have roots in Hinduism.

Therefore, option A presents a false narrative about the origins of Sikhism, contradicting the information provided in the passage."
Ebarat key hisaab sey darjah zail mein sey kisko Sikh aqeedah key system ka markazi pahlu samjha jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Guru ka tasavvur (The concept of the Guru)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Guru kaa tasavvur tamaam hindustani mazahib kaa eek bunyadi pehlu hay lekin sikh mat mein iss kee ahmiyat eek bunyadi aqeedah kee haisiyat say hay.""  This translates to: ""The concept of the Guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, its importance is a fundamental belief.""

While the other options are related to Sikhism, the passage highlights the Guru's concept as the *core* of their belief system. The Guru is central to Sikhism's identity and theology, far exceeding the importance of Hindu traditions, acceptance of some traditions, rejection of other religions, or speaking in Punjabi.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Ebarat key hisaab sey, tawajjoh ki kami ki kharaabi waley bachhon key paas kiss cheez parr tawajjoh deney mein mushkil waqt hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Schooli kaam**.

The text explicitly states: ""Inn bachon ko aisi cheezon say, jaise keh school key kam parr tauajjoh markooz karnaa bahut mushkil hota hay..."" which translates to ""These children have difficulty focusing on things like schoolwork...""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tawajjoh ki kami ki kharaabi waley bachhey aam tor parr khatrnaak rawayyon mein keon masruf rahtey hein?","The correct answer is **A: Ziyaadah faaliyat ko kam karnaa (Reducing excessive activity)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inn bachon mein mushkilaat mein padnay kaa rujhaan bahut hay kiyon keh """"woh bahut khatarnaak adat mein mubtala hain, jhagday karnaa aur qanoon naafiz karnay waale idaaron say Ulajhna"""", takeh unn key dimagh ko sokoon milay, chonkeh unn kaa dimagh aam tareeqon say sokoon nahein paataa.""

This indicates that children with ADD engage in risky behaviors *to find a way to calm their minds* because their brains don't find peace easily. The passage further suggests that these behaviors are a way to reduce excessive activity and seek stimulation. Option A best reflects this reasoning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Saathiyon key saath judney mein unki madad karnaa (Helping them connect with peers):** While social difficulties are mentioned, the passage doesn't directly link risky behavior to connecting with peers.
* **C: Apney waldain sey tawajjoh haasil karnaa (Gaining attention from their parents):** The passage doesn't suggest that risky behavior is a strategy to get attention from parents.
* **D: Unkey dimaagh ki hausalh afzayi karnaa (Boosting their brain's enthusiasm):**  The passage says their brains *don't* find peace easily, suggesting they need to *reduce* stimulation, not boost it.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inmein sey kon scaffolding ki misaal nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Eek aazad taleemi program (A free educational program)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes scaffolding as a support system to help learners with new experiences, like learning a new computer program or starting a new project. It highlights how scaffolding provides guidance, suggests approaches, and clarifies things that learners might struggle with on their own.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Computer game key shuru mein eek tutorial (A tutorial at the beginning of a computer game):** Tutorials in games are a classic example of scaffolding, guiding players through the initial learning process.
*   **B: Eek SAT tutor (An SAT tutor):** SAT tutors provide focused support and guidance to students learning the material for the SAT, a clear example of scaffolding.
*   **D: Eek chotey league ka coach (A little league coach):** Coaches provide guidance, instruction, and support to young athletes, acting as scaffolding for their learning and development.
*   **C: Eek aazad taleemi program (A free educational program):** While a free educational program *can* offer learning resources, it doesn't inherently provide the *structured, supportive guidance* that the passage describes as scaffolding. A free program might just offer materials; it might not proactively address potential challenges or offer step-by-step support tailored to a learner's specific needs. It lacks the active, supportive role of a tutor or coach that scaffolding implies.

Therefore, a free educational program is the least likely to be considered an example of scaffolding, based on the definition given in the passage.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr scaffolding key tasavvur ki wazaht nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Yeah tariqaye taleem ki banisbat taawun ziyaada hay (This is more collaborative than the learning method itself).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that scaffolds aren't *just* about collaboration, but about providing support and guidance for navigating new learning experiences.** While collaboration might *result* from using scaffolds, it's not the primary definition. The passage focuses on the support they offer to overcome challenges in learning a new skill or project.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Scaffolds majazi tor parr baahr ho sakta hay (Scaffolds can be virtual):** The passage explicitly states ""inn kaa folding virtual aur haqeeqi donon ho saktay (they can be both virtual and real).""
* **C: Yeah neez project parr mabni taleem key tor parr jaana jata hay (It is also approached as project-based learning):**  The passage says ""Project par mabni taleem key eek naye tajarbay say guzar rahay hain (experiencing a new project-based learning experience).""
* **D: Scaffolds ka istemaal taleemi tajarbah key aaghaz mein himayat ki peshkash karney key liye hota hay (Scaffolds are used to offer support at the beginning of the learning experience):** The passage mentions ""taleemi tajarbah key aaghaz mein himayat ki peshkash karney key liye hota hay (are used to offer support at the beginning of the learning experience).""



Therefore, option B misrepresents the core purpose of scaffolding as defined in the provided text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, MySpace ki kon si khosusiyat unn talabah ko faayedah pahuncha sakti hay jinhein padhney mein dushwari hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Takhsees (Customization)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Iss ko padhnay mein aasaan bananay aur hasbe khwohish rang ko kam wo besh karay key liye isay costomize kiya jaa sakta hay."" This directly relates to the ability to customize the site to make it easier to read and visually appealing, which would benefit students with reading difficulties.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Blogz:** While blogs are a feature, the passage doesn't mention a direct benefit to students with reading difficulties related to blogs.
* **C: Eek web patah (One web address):** A single web address makes it easy to remember, but doesn't directly help students with reading difficulties.
* **D: 54 million profilein:** The number of profiles is about popularity, not features that aid learning.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon mazdoor key fasaadat parr Krushchev key jawaab ka hissah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Tankhawaah ki katautiyon ko badhanaa (Increasing wage cuts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Khrushchev *did* fulfill some economic demands (D) and deployed troops to restore order (B). He also agreed to appoint Wladeyslaw Gomulka as the new Prime Minister (A), which was a significant concession.

However, the passage explicitly says that Khrushchev's response *didn't* involve *increasing* wage cuts. In fact, the protests were *against* wage cuts, and the passage implies Khrushchev softened his stance on them.  Therefore, increasing wage cuts would be the *opposite* of his response and thus the correct answer.

Options A, B, and D all directly reflect actions taken by Khrushchev in response to the worker's unrest, as described in the text.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Poland mein fasaadat ki wajah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Wladyslaw Gomulka ki taqarruri (Wladyslaw Gomulka's appointment).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the initial protests were about food shortages and wage cuts.** This directly links the unrest to **food scarcity (Khaaney ki kamiyaan)** and **wage reductions (Tankhawaah ki karautiyaan).**
* **The passage explicitly mentions that the protests later evolved into wider opposition to communism (communism key khelaaf aam ehtejaj).** Therefore, **communism (Communism)** was a key underlying cause of the unrest.
* **The passage describes the situation where Khruschev sent tanks to restore order.** This indicates that the government was struggling to control the protests and the potential for violence was high. This supports the idea of **wage reductions (Tankhawaah ki karautiyaan)** as a catalyst for the initial unrest.
* **Wladyslaw Gomulka's appointment, while significant, was a *result* of the protests, not a *cause*.** The protests forced Khruschev's hand and led to the appointment of Gomulka as a compromise. It wasn't the initial spark of the unrest.



Therefore, Gomulka's appointment isn't a cause of the unrest; it's a consequence of it.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiska USSR aur USA key darmiyaan talluqaat parr asar nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Jarmani key baarey mein nazriyaat**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Germany was a common enemy that fostered cooperation between the USSR and the USA *during the war*.  However, the conflict's *outcome* - the clash of systems, ideologies, and cultures - led to the post-war division and the Cold War.  Therefore, Germany's role was pivotal *in the war's formation* but less directly in the subsequent long-term relationship.

* **A: Saqafati ikhtelaafat (Cultural differences):** The passage highlights the clash of cultures as a *result* of the war's outcome and a contributing factor to the Cold War.

* **C: Motazaad amal kaariyaan (Conflicting actions):** The passage describes the Cold War as a period of proxy wars, which are inherently examples of conflicting actions between the superpowers.

* **D: Nizamon key baarey mein tanazuaat (Disagreements about systems):** The passage directly states the Cold War was fueled by the clash of systems, indicating deep disagreements between the communist USSR and the capitalist USA.



Therefore, while Germany's role in the war was significant, its *viewpoint* after the war didn't have as pronounced a direct impact on the overall relationship as the other factors did.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr aasab key tasalsul ko purey jism mein bhejney key maqsad ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Khoon key bahao ko aahistah karnaa (To slow down blood flow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that nervous system activity maintains vital functions and transmits signals throughout the body to protect against danger.** It specifically mentions the nervous system's role in keeping the body stable.
* **The other options (B, C, and D) are all consistent with this function.**  Maintaining vital functions, preserving life, and protecting against threats are all things the nervous system does.
* **Slowing down blood flow is generally *not* a protective mechanism initiated by the nervous system.**  The nervous system can *regulate* blood flow, but slowing it down is typically a consequence of other processes (like blood loss) and not a primary function of the nervous system's protective signals.

Therefore, option A is the statement that *doesn't* accurately describe the purpose of nervous system activity as described in the passage.
"
Giza Plateau mein kiya mil sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Azeem ahraam**.

The text explicitly states: ""Misar key waadi amwaat mein waaqa jezah plato, yaa """"jezah necropolis"""" mein mutaddid ahraam (jinn mein ahraam azeem sab say badaa hay)..."" which translates to ""On the Giza Plateau in the Valley of the Kings, or the ""Giza Necropolis,"" there are numerous pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest)..."".

While the other options are also mentioned in the text (tombs, temples), the *most* prominent and defining feature of the Giza Plateau, according to the passage, is the Great Pyramid (and pyramids in general).
"
Azeem ahraam ka maqsad kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Friron ki izzat afzayi karnaa (To honor the pharaohs)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Azeem ahraam ko firaun khufu kee takreem mein tameer kiya gayaa aur bahut say chhote ahraam, maqbaray aur mandir khufu kee biyon aur arkaani khanwadah kee takreem mein tameer kiyey gaye."" (The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.)
"
Mandir ko tabaah karney waley aatish zan key baarey mein hamaari jankari ka kon zimmah daar hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yunani muarrikh austribo nay baad mein uskaa naam darj kiya, jiski wajah say ham aaj usay jaantay hain"" which translates to ""The Greek historian Strabo later recorded his name, because of which we know him today.""  This means Strabo is responsible for our knowledge of the arsonist's name.
"
Artemis key mandir ki tameer nav key baarey mein konsa durust bayaniyah hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Iski tameere nav sikandare aazam key ahed key baad hui thee.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Baad mein sikandar aazam key maut key baad mandir ko 323 qabl maseeh mein dobarah tameer kiya gayaa."" (Later, after the death of Alexander the Great, the temple was rebuilt in 323 BC.)
* The passage also mentions that Alexander offered to pay for the temple's rebuilding but was rejected.

Therefore, the temple was rebuilt *after* Alexander the Great's reign. Options A and C are incorrect because Alexander offered to *pay* but wasn't ordered to pay. Option D is incorrect because the passage states the rebuilding happened in 323 BC, not 320 BC.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sabsey pahley kabb hua thaa kehh parjatiyaan do pairon par chali theen?","The correct answer is **A: Saat million saalon pahley**.

The passage states: ""celanthropus shayed saat million saal pehle hee donon qadmon parr chall padaa thaa..."" which translates to ""early hominids perhaps walked on two legs seven million years ago...""
"
Inmein sey konsi parjaatiyaan baqaedah do pairon parr chalti theen?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that *Homo erectus* likely started walking on two legs around 7 million years ago.
* It also contrasts *Homo erectus* with *Australopithecus*, which didn't habitually walk upright.
* *Sahelanthropus* is mentioned as a possible early bipedal species, but the passage doesn't definitively state they walked upright habitually. 
* ""Do paya ki takhseesaat"" (specializations for walking on two legs) refers to the *adaptation* for bipedalism, not a specific species.
"
Jarmani ka bahriyah WWII key doraan kis cheez ko mokammal karney ki koshish kar raha thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Bartaniyaah ko log aur saaman wosul karney sey rok raha thaa** (Germany was trying to prevent people and goods from reaching Britain).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the German navy was trying to ""roknay kee koshish karr rahee thi"" (trying to stop) the traffic across the Atlantic.
* The traffic being stopped was to deliver ""afraad aur saaz wo saamaan bhejnay kee koshish karr rahay they"" (people and goods were trying to be sent) to aid Britain.
* Therefore, Germany was preventing Britain from receiving vital supplies and people.
"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Shumaali Atlantic muhim key doraan bahri jang mein sabsey ziyadah kamiyabi kis key paas thee?","The correct answer is **D: Bartanavi**.

Here's why: The text states that the US and Britain were trying to send people and supplies across the Atlantic to aid Britain. Germany was trying to *stop* that traffic. The text implies that if the Allied effort (Britain and US) had failed, Germany would have likely conquered Britain. This strongly suggests the Allied effort was successful, meaning Britain and the US were the ones who achieved the greater success in that particular part of the war. Therefore, the British (along with the US) had the greater success in the North Atlantic campaign.
"
Jabb ashuriyon ney Ghodwaar foj key istemaal ka nifaaz kiya thaa to kiya cheez mojud nahein thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Zeenein (Armor)**.

The passage clearly states: ""zeen abhi tak eejaad nahein hoyee thee iss liye aashuri ghod sawaar ghodon kee nangay kamar parr baith key ladtay they"" which translates to ""armor had not yet been invented, therefore the Assyrian horsemen fought sitting naked on the bare backs of the horses.""
"
Ghodswari istemaal karney waali ladaiyaan kaisey ladi jaati hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Zirah baktar key begair** (Without armor).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...zeen abhi tak eejaad nahein hoyee thee iss liye aashuri ghod sawaar ghodon kee nangay kamar parr baith key ladtay they."" This translates to ""...armor had not yet been invented, so the Assyrian horsemen fought sitting bare-chested on the horses' loins.""  Therefore, they fought without armor.

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **A: Pairon parr (On feet):** The text describes riding horses, not fighting on foot.
*   **C: Ghodon ki pusht parr (On the horses' backs):** The text says they sat on the ""loins"" (kamar) of the horses, not their backs.
*   **D: Kam fojiyon key saath (With fewer soldiers):** The text doesn't mention anything about the size of the military units.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, awsat Beebi loan shahri aap ko kahaan nahein milein gey?","The correct answer is **D: Andruni panaah gaah mein qurbaniyaan lekar aana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harr mandir key andar eek khulaa ahatah hota hay aur uss key andar eek haram hota hay jis mein faqat parohit daakhil ho sakta hay."" This means the inner sanctuary (haram) was reserved *only* for the priests. The passage also mentions sacrifices were offered in the presence of God and during ceremonies. 

Therefore, offering sacrifices *inside* the inner sanctuary would be prohibited and is where you would *not* find people doing that according to the text. Options A, B, and C all describe activities that could occur in the outer areas of the temple, which are mentioned in the passage as being places of worship and ceremony.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon khaas tor parr pujariyon key liye they?,"The correct answer is **B: Andruni pnaah gaahein (Inner sanctuary)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harr mandir key andar eek khulaa ahatah hota hay aur uss key andar eek haram hota hay jis mein faqat parohit daakhil ho sakta hay.""  This translates to: ""In every temple, there is an outer area and within it, a sanctuary that only priests can enter.""

The inner sanctuary (andruni pnaah gaahein) was specifically for the priests. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tehwaar (Festivals):** Festivals were public events.
*   **C: Taqribaat (Ceremonies):**  While priests performed ceremonies, ceremonies themselves weren't exclusive to them.
*   **D: Ziggurat:** Ziggurats were temples, but the *inner sanctuary* within the temple was the special space for priests.



"
Badshah Tutankhamun ko kabb badnami mili thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Unkey maqbarah ki daryaaft key baad (After the discovery of his tomb)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Taham 1922 mein uss key maqbarah key ikteshaf key baad woh mashhur shakhsiyat ho gayaa."" (However, after the discovery of his tomb in 1922, he became a famous personality.)
"
Badshah Tutankhamun ko kis cheez ney misr ka mashhoor badshaah banaa diya?,"The correct answer is **A: Unkey bezarar maqbarey ki daryaaft (The discovery of his intact tomb)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Taham 1922 mein uss key maqbarah key ikteshaf key baad woh mashhur shakhsiyat ho gayaa."" which translates to ""However, after the discovery of his tomb in 1922, he became a famous personality.""  The text further mentions that while he wasn't considered particularly important in ancient times, his tomb was remarkably untouched, preserving its treasures.
"
Unani shayer Homer kiya karney key qaabil nahein thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Dekhney** (Seeing).

Here's why:

The passage states that Homer is famous for composing the epic poems *Iliad* and *Odyssey*. These are poems, meaning they are primarily *written* or *sung* – activities related to language and storytelling, not sight. The passage doesn't mention anything about Homer being known for his visual abilities.  The other options are plausible activities for a person, and the passage doesn't exclude them.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that Homer was not known for his ability to ""Dekhney"" (see).
"
Kon mashhoor unani adab key alawah kisi aur cheez key liye mashhoor thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagoras**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Pythagoras is known for his famous theorem about the relationships between the sides of right triangles. This is *in addition* to being a famous Greek intellectual.
* Homer is primarily known for the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*.
* Sophocles and Aristophanes are known for their plays.



"
Hebrew khandaan ney apnaa ziyadah waqt kahaan guzaara thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Khuli fazaa mein (In the open air)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ziyadah tar nasrani family khulee hawa meen rahaa karti thee,"" which translates to ""Most Christian families used to live in the open air.""
"
Hebrew khandaan key liye kiya cheez ziyadah ahem nahein thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Unkey ghar (Their homes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mashriqe wustaa key garam maahaul mein ghar itnay ahem nahein they."" This translates to: ""In the hot climate of the Middle East, homes were not that important.""

Therefore, the Hebrew families didn't prioritize their homes as much as the other options. They prioritized their climate (A), stores (B), and cooking (D) more than the physical structure of their homes due to the climate.
"
Scandinavian mamalik key darmiyaan ekhtelaaf key tor parr darjah zail mein sey kiski wazahat nahein hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Zameen (Land)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that there are ""mutaddid ikhtelafat"" (multiple differences) between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland in terms of ""maa bain awaam, hukkaam, aaraaf, aur tawarikh"" (people, rulers, customs, and histories).
* It mentions differences in customs (""rewaaj"") and histories (""tawarikh"").
* It implies differences in people (""maa bain awaam"").
* However, the passage states that ""har mulk apni jagah 'scandy neween' hay"" (every country has its place in 'Scandy Neween'), suggesting that the *land itself* is not a point of significant disagreement or difference between these countries. The name ""Greenland"" itself highlights a difference in perception of the land's appearance.

Therefore, the passage indicates differences in culture, history, and people, but not in the physical land itself.
"
Greenland mein sabsey pahley kon moqim huey thay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eskimo qabail**.

The passage states: ""Lekin uss kee driyaft say qataa nazar uss waqat schemo qabail pehle hee say vahan abad they."" This translates to ""But the arrival of people was hidden from sight, as the Schema tribe had already been inhabiting there."" The Eskimo tribes are also referred to as Schema tribes. Therefore, the Eskimo tribes were the first inhabitants of Greenland.
"
Konsi jamaat kusiyon key begair khaney ko tarjeeh deti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Maldaar romi mard**.

The passage states: ""Jahaan garib afraad aur khwateen apna khaana kursiyon parr baith karr khaatay they, wahein umaraa ko mill karr aisi ziyafat kaa ehtemam pasand thaa jahaan woh khaana khaatay hoay karwat key bal leyt payein.""  This translates to: ""Where poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs, the aristocracy preferred such feasts where they could eat lying down on their beds.""  Therefore, the aristocracy (umaraa), which is comprised of wealthy men, preferred to eat lying down.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon qadeem romi dawat ka hissah nahein hoga?,"The correct answer is **B: Ghongon key bhukey (Hungry ghosts)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes the lavish feasts of wealthy Romans, mentioning wild boar, peacock, peacock tongue, and dormouse. It also highlights that the wealthy would eat in bed.
* Option A: ""Kursiyon par khaney waley gareeb mehmaan"" (Poor guests eating on chairs) is consistent with the description of how the poor ate.
* Option C: ""Raat key khaney key doraan letey huey maldaar mard"" (Wealthy men lying down during nighttime meals) aligns perfectly with the passage's description of wealthy Romans eating in bed.
* Option D: ""Bhuna hua turkii khana ki eek thaali"" (A platter of roasted turkey) is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that the ancient Romans did *not* have turkey.  The passage also mentions that they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa.
* Option B: ""Ghongon key bhukey"" (Hungry ghosts) is a nonsensical phrase and has no connection to Roman dining customs. It's not mentioned anywhere in the provided text.

Therefore, option B is the only one that wouldn't be part of an ancient Roman feast based on the given information.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kiskey jaari asar rahney ka imkaan nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Eek choti saqafat** (A small culture).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that **small cultures often don't leave significant historical evidence and fail to be transmitted as a complete civilization.** The passage explicitly states: ""Chhoti saqafatein aksar wo beshtar munasib tarikhi shahadat chhoday baghair naaped hojati hain aur mokammal tehzeeb key tor parr tasleem kiye jaaney mein nakaam rehti hain"" which translates to ""Small cultures often do not leave many suitable historical proofs and fail to be delivered as a complete civilization.""

The other options are all directly related to the passage's discussion of civilization:

* **A: Eek samaaj (A society):**  Civilization is defined by shared societal practices.
* **C: Eek shahar ki halat (The state of a city):** Cities are key components of civilization.
* **D: Eek tahzeebi saqafat (A civilized culture):** The passage is *about* civilized cultures and how they function.



Therefore, a small culture is the one least likely to have the kind of lasting impact that defines a civilization.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mulk sey aagey badh kar kiya hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Eek tahzeebi saqafat (A civilized culture)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tehzeeb woh waahid saqafat hay jo afraad key eek makhsus garoh mushtarkah tor parr apnatay hain jo taawun karnay waale andaaz mein rahte aur kam kartay hain..."" which translates to ""Civilization is a single culture that a special group of people adopts collectively who live and work in a cooperative manner..."" and goes on to explain its origins and characteristics.  The whole passage is *about* civilization (tehzeeb) as a progression beyond a simple, less developed state.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Eek wahid saqafat (A single culture)** - While civilization *is* a single culture, the passage emphasizes the *civilized* aspect, not just the *single* aspect.
*   **C: Eek shahar ki halat (A state of a city)** -  The passage mentions cities as centers of communication and a part of the civilization, but it's not the ultimate progression.
*   **D: Eek choti saqafatein (Small cultures)** - The passage contrasts small cultures with complete civilizations.



"
Drukgyal Dzong key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahi nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Isko tibbat ki mongol fojon ki jeet ka jashan mananey key liye tameer kiya gaya thaa.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that Drukgyal Dzong was built to commemorate Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory over the Tibetan Mongol forces in 1649. It was *not* built to celebrate a Mongol victory.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: Yeah Bhutan mein waqea hay** - The passage explicitly states this.
* **C: Eek aag ney qilah ki bahut si baqiyaat ko tabaah kar diya thaa** - The passage says a fire in 1951 destroyed most of the Dzong.
* **D: Isko Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ney banaya thaa** - The passage states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel commissioned its construction.



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr Drukgyal Dzong mein aag key natijah ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Akeli bachi hui baqiyat Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal ki tasweer thee.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""In 1951, a fire broke out, leaving only a few rare artifacts of Drukgyal Dzong intact, such as a statue of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal."" 
* Option A directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tibbat ki mongol fojein faateh theen** - While the passage mentions a battle against Tibetan Mongol forces, it doesn't state that they *defeated* Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal or caused the fire.
* **C: Kashish ki shohrat motassir nahein hui thee** - The passage implies the opposite; the fire *did* significantly damage the Dzong, indicating it affected its fame and importance.
* **D: Isko Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ney mahfooz kiya thaa** - The passage states the Dzong was *preserved after the fire*, not that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal preserved it.



"
Cambodia key baarey mein darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Cambodia ney 1772 mein Thailand parr hamlah kiya thaa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Thailand was a dominant power and exerted pressure on Cambodia.** It *doesn't* say Cambodia attacked Thailand.
* **The passage explicitly mentions that Vietnamese forces destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.** So, option A is true.
* **The passage mentions that Vietnamese forces attacked Cambodia in the late 18th century.** So, option C is likely true (though the exact phrasing isn't present, the context supports it).
* **The passage states that Thailand and Vietnam were powerful neighbors who pressured Cambodia.** It also states that Thai forces (Thai ""maabain"") were a threat. Thus, option D is likely true.

Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that Cambodia attacked Thailand in 1772.



"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah Cambodia key hamlah ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Vietnamiyon ney Cambodia parr motaddid baar hamlah kiya thaa (Vietnamese people attacked Cambodia multiple times)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""18vein sadee mein thayiyon nay kambodiya parr kayee baar hamlay kiyey, aur san 1772 mein inhon nay nome faine ko tabaah karr diyaa- Attharvein sadee key aakhri salon mein veitnamiyon ney bhee kambodiya parr hamlah kiya thaa."" (In the 18th century, Thais attacked Cambodia many times, and in 1772 they destroyed Phnom Penh. In the last years of the 18th century, Vietnamese also attacked Cambodia.)

Option A accurately reflects this statement that Vietnam attacked Cambodia multiple times.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Thai aur Veitnami logon ney Cambodia par 1772 mein halah kiya thaa (Thai and Vietnamese people attacked Cambodia in 1772):** While true that both Thais and Vietnamese attacked in 1772, option A focuses on Vietnam, which is a key point of the question.
* **C: Vietnami logon ney Phnom Phen ko tabah kiya thaa (Vietnamese people destroyed Phnom Penh):**  While the Vietnamese did destroy Phnom Penh, the text indicates multiple attacks, not just this one instance.
* **D: Thai logon ney Cambodia parr kayi baar hamlah kiya tha (Thai people attacked Cambodia many times):** While true, the question asks about Cambodia's attacks, and the text specifically details Vietnamese attacks.



"
Dutch East India Company ney Taiwan mein apney waqt key doraan darjah zail mein sey kiya nahien kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Qing saltanat key liye Taiwan key cede control ki khawahish ki** (Wished for cede control of Taiwan for the Qing Dynasty).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Qing Dynasty (1683) *took control* of Taiwan, not that they *wished* for it. The Qing Dynasty *did* exert control over Taiwan.
* The other options are all things the Dutch East India Company *did*:
    * **A: Jazeerah key jonub mashriqi hissah parr eek buniyaad haasil ki** (Established a base in the southern part of the island) - The passage explicitly states this.
    * **B: Maqami anaaj ki paidawaar ki mashq karnaa** (Practiced local grain production) - The passage mentions this.
    * **C: Cheeeni mazdooron ko apney baghaat parr molazemat di thee** (Provided employment to Chinese laborers on their plantations) - The passage mentions this.



Therefore, the only option that is *not* supported by the passage is D.



"
Shimonoseki key moahedah ney kiya qayem kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Taiwan parr Japan ka iqtedaar (Japan's authority over Taiwan).**

The passage states: ""1895 mein, pehli cheen-japan jung (1894-1895) mein shikast key baad, chang hukumat nay shimonosiki muahide parr dastakhat kiye, jis key bamojib uss nay taiwan parr apnay iqtedar say japan key haq mein dastbardari kaa aiteraf kiya, jis nay uss jazeeray parr 1945 tak hukumat kee."" 

This clearly indicates that the Shimonoseki Treaty resulted in Japan gaining authority over Taiwan.
"
Kisi kimiyaa ki pH satah ki paimaish kaisey ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Kimiyayi mein Hydrogen ions ki miqdaar (In a chemical substance, the amount of hydrogen ions)**.

Here's why:

* **pH is defined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution.** The lower the concentration of H+, the higher the pH (more alkaline/basic).  The higher the concentration of H+, the lower the pH (more acidic).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kimiyayi jitnaa buniyaadi ya tezabi hota hay (A chemical is as basic or acidic as it is basic or acidic).** This is a circular definition and doesn't explain *how* pH is measured.
* **B: Kimiyayi mein jitney proton hotey hein (A chemical has as many protons as it has protons).** While protons are related to hydrogen ions, this option is too broad. pH specifically refers to hydrogen *ions* (H+), not just the total number of protons.
* **D: Kimiyayi mein jitney electron hotey hein (A chemical has as many electrons as it has electrons).** Electrons are not directly involved in determining pH. pH is about the concentration of hydrogen ions.



"
Hydrogen ions sey kisko hataya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Proton**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Test kiyey gaye chemical mein ph level ko hydrogen aayoon kee miqdar (the h in ph) say zahir kiya jaataa hay. Hydrogen barq paaray woh protoon hain jinn key electron unhein alag kartay hain...""

This means that hydrogen ions (H+) are essentially protons that have lost an electron. Therefore, hydrogen ions were formed by removing electrons from protons.
"
Dajah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr sheron key fakhr ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Mozakkar sey moannas tak ka tanasub yaksaan hay (The ratio of males to females is equal)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sheron kaa garoh taqriban tees moannas aur bachon key saath eek say teen mutalliqah baaligh narr parr mushtamil hota hay"" (A lion's pride consists of approximately thirty females and cubs, with one to three adult males).  This clearly indicates an **unequal** ratio, with more females than males.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Wohh kutton key jhund key momasil bartao krtey hein (They exhibit behavior similar to dog packs):** The passage states, ""Sheron kaa garoh ziyadah tar bhediyon yaa kutton key grohon kee tarah kam kartay hein"" (Lion prides hunt much like wolf or dog packs).
* **C: Mozakkaro moannas sab qareeb sey motallique hein (Males and females are all closely related):**  The passage mentions, ""Khwateen behnon aur betiyon key eek baday khandaan key tor parr, omuman eek dosray say bahut qareebi taalluq rakhti hain"" (Females, sisters and daughters, form a large family, and generally have very close relationships with each other). This implies close relationships within the pride.
* **D: Wohh mohlik aur samaaji dono hein (They are both predatory and social):** The passage says, ""Yeah bhee keh apnay shikaar key liye bahut mohlik hotay hein"" (They are also very predatory for their prey) and ""Sheron kaa garoh ziyadah tar bhediyon yaa kutton key grohon kee tarah kam kartay hein"" (Lion prides hunt much like wolf or dog packs), implying a social structure that facilitates hunting.



"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr sheron key bartao ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Doosri badi billiyon key momasil unka bartao**।

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

*   **A: Wohh bahut samaaji hein (वे बहुत सामाजिक हैं):** पाठ स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि शेर सामाजिक प्राणी हैं जो बड़े समूहों में रहते हैं और कबीले बनाते हैं। यह कथन पाठ के अनुरूप है।

*   **B: Unkaa bartao bhediyon key bartao sey motawazin hay (उनका व्यवहार भेड़ियों के व्यवहार के अनुरूप है):** पाठ में कहा गया है कि शेरों का व्यवहार भेड़ियों और कुत्तों के समूहों के समान है। यह कथन पाठ के अनुरूप है।

*   **C: Mozakkar aur moannas dono shikaar key liye bahut ziyaadah mohlik hein (नर और मादा दोनों शिकार के लिए बहुत अधिक इच्छुक हैं):** पाठ बताता है कि शेर शिकार के लिए बहुत इच्छुक हैं। यह कथन पाठ के अनुरूप है।

*   **D: Doosri badi billiyon key momasil unka bartao (दूसरी बड़ी बिल्लियों के प्रतिनिधि उनका व्यवहार):** पाठ विशेष रूप से बताता है कि शेरों का व्यवहार दूसरी बड़ी बिल्लियों से भिन्न है। यह कथन पाठ के अनुरूप नहीं है, बल्कि इसके विपरीत है।

इसलिए, विकल्प D, शेरों के व्यवहार की व्याख्या नहीं करता है जैसा कि पाठ में वर्णित है।"
Khargosh kis qism key shikaari key liye aam shikaar hota hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Darmiyanah size waali billiyan (Medium-sized cats)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Inn key khoraak darmiyana qadd key shikaar hain khargoshon say leke baarah sengha aur hirran tak"" which translates to ""Their food is prey ranging from medium-sized animals like rabbits to deer.""  And later, it mentions ""darmiyana qadd key billiyan"" (medium-sized cats) as being successful at hunting.



"
Ziyadah choti billiyaan aam tor parr darjah zail mein sey kiska shikaar karti hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Choohey (Choohey)**.

The passage states: ""Aakhirkar, bahut see chhote qadd kee billiyan bashomool ghareloo billiyon key jo bary taadad mein paaye jaaney waale keedon makodon aur **choohon** say leke..."" which translates to ""Finally, many small cats, including common house cats, which are commonly found in large numbers, prey on worms, mice, and **rats**..."".

While the passage mentions other animals, it specifically highlights that small cats prey on rats (choohey). The options provided are not completely accurate translations, but ""choohey"" is the closest to ""rats"" in this context. Therefore, the best answer among the given choices is **Choohey**.

The original text has a typo and mentions ""Hiran"" twice as option C and D, which is incorrect. The correct options should be based on the passage."
Darjah zail mein sey kon Billi jaisey janwaar key shikaar key tariqah ka hissah nahein hay?,"सही जवाब है **A: अपने गरो नवाह में छलांग लगाना**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

*   प्रश्न में दिए गए पाठ में, यह बताया गया है कि चेटे अपने शिकार को पकड़ने के लिए अपनी गंध की भावना और रात में अच्छी दृष्टि का उपयोग करते हैं। वे अपने शिकार के करीब घुलमिलकर चुपके से हमला करते हैं।
*   जबकि चेटे शिकार का पीछा करते समय छलांग लगा सकते हैं, यह उनके शिकार करने की रणनीति का एक केंद्रीय हिस्सा नहीं है जैसा कि गंध का पीछा करना, रात में शिकार का पीछा करना और छोटे आकार के जानवरों का शिकार करना है।

इसलिए, चेटे के शिकार के तरीके का हिस्सा नहीं होने वाला विकल्प A है।"
Darjah zail mein sey kon billi jaysey janwar ki durust tor parr wazahat nahein karta hay? ,"The correct answer is **C: Unkey sunghney ka hassah kamzor hay (Their sense of smell is weak)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that cheetahs rely on a strong sense of smell to hunt, tracking prey through scent. Option C directly contradicts this information. The passage emphasizes their keen sense of smell.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Wohh raat mein achey sey shikaar karney key qaabil hein (They are able to hunt well at night):** The passage mentions that they have good night vision (shabanah basarat).
* **B: Wohh khamushi sey chaltey hein (They walk silently):** The passage states they stalk prey and move stealthily.
* **D: Wohh chotey janwaron ka shikaar karney ko tarjeeh detey hein (They prefer to hunt small animals):** The passage explicitly mentions that they hunt small animals like monkeys, snakes, mice, and sometimes birds.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko tiger ki sabsey badi taaqat nahein samjha jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Dahadna (Roaring)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cheeta kee dahaad sher kee bhar poor aawaz waali dahaad jaisi nahein, balkeh badd mezaji key saath cheekhe gaye alfaz say ziyad moshabah hoti hai."" This translates to: ""The cheetah's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but more like shouts with bad temper."" 

Therefore, the passage explicitly says the cheetah's roar is *not* as powerful as a lion's roar. The other options (climbing, jumping, and pulling) are all mentioned as things the cheetah *can* do well.
"
Darjah zail mein sey ko tigaron aur sheron key darmiyaan mukhtalif hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Unki dahaad ki awaaz (Their roar)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Cheeta kee dahaad sher kee bhar poor aawaz waali dahaad jaisi nahein, balkeh badd mezaji key saath cheekhe gaye alfaz say ziyad moshabah hoti hai."" (Cheetah's roar is not like the full-bodied roar of a lion, but rather more like shouted words with a bad temper.)
* The passage also describes the lion's roar as ""bhar poor aawaz waali dahaad"" (full-bodied roar).
* The passage discusses cheetah's swimming ability, jumping distance, and pulling strength, but doesn't compare them to lions in those areas.

Therefore, the difference highlighted in the passage between cheetahs and lions is the **sound of their roar**.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, deegar mahireene hayatiyaat sey pahley Robert Hooke ney keya kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Marey huey khaliyon ka moshahedah kiya** (Observed dead cells).

The passage explicitly states: ""Woh pehla shakhs thaa jis nay murdah khalliyaat kaa moshahidah kiya."" (He was the first person to observe dead cells.)

While Robert Hooke used a microscope (B) and saw small compartments (C), the key action he took that was significant in the context of the passage was observing dead cells. Option D is also partially true, but less direct than A.
"
Lafze “cell” ki asal ka matlab kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Chota kamrah (Chota kamra)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Cell ko laatini lafz celiya say lia gayaa hay, jis kaa matlab chhota kamrah hota hay- "" which translates to ""The Latin word 'cell' has been taken from 'celia', whose meaning is small room.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, ziyadah tar janwaron mein keya karney ki salahiyat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Chalney (Walking)**.

The passage states: ""Ziyadah tar janwar chal saktay hain"" which translates to ""Most animals can walk.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kuchh janwaron mein keya nahein hota hay?","The correct answer is **C: Dimaagh (Brain)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sirf janwaron key paas dimagh hay (garcheh tamaam janwaron key paas nahein hay; misal key tor parr jaili machli key paas dimagh nahein hay)."" which translates to ""Only animals have brains (although not all animals have them; for example, a shark does not have a brain).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khaliye (Cells):** The text doesn't say anything about cells being absent in some animals. All living organisms are made of cells.
* **B: Hazam karney ki salahiyat (Ability to digest):** The text says animals eat and digest food.
* **D: Khaney ki salahiyat (Ability to eat):** The text says animals eat.



"
Photosynthesis key marhalah mein podon ki kiss sey moawanat hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Suraj (Sun)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Poday photocenthesis ke zariah apna khaana dhoop mein banatay hain"" which translates to ""Plants make their food through photosynthesis in sunlight."" Photosynthesis *requires* sunlight to occur. 

The other options are incorrect:

* **Saayah (Shade):** Plants need sunlight, not shade, for photosynthesis.
* **Janwar (Animals):** Animals depend on plants for food, but they don't directly provide the energy for photosynthesis.
* **Gheza (Food):**  Plants *create* food through photosynthesis, they don't provide the energy for the process.



"
Kiya cheez insaan saans sey chodtey hein jo podey saans sey letey hein?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

The passage states: ""Poday woh oxygen chhodte hain jisay insaan songhta hay, aur woh insaanon key zariah baahar chhoday gaye (sans key zariah baahar chhoday gaye) carbon dyoxide apnay andar jazb karta hay."" This translates to: ""Plants release oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide released by humans through their breath.""

Therefore, humans exhale carbon dioxide, which plants take in.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsi misaal irteqaa key marhalah ki rokawat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Choti jamaat ka nayi jagah mein badheny mein nakaam hona (Failure of a small group to expand in a new location)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as a process where a population divides and evolves into two distinct populations. It highlights that when a small group migrates to a new environment, they face challenges adapting to new resources and competitors. If they *fail* to adapt and expand, they won't evolve into a new species.  This failure to adapt is a *hindrance* to the evolutionary process, a roadblock rather than a step forward.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Eek aabadi key hissah ka naye mahaul mein muntaqil hona (A portion of a population migrating to a new environment):** This is the *beginning* of the evolutionary process, not a roadblock.
* **C: Eek aabadi ki motabeqat karna, yeah eek naye mahaul mein mowafiqat hoti hay (A population adapting to a new environment, this is conformity in a new environment):** Adaptation is a *key* component of evolution.
* **D: Eek aabadi ka hadsaati tor parr do ki tashkeel karna (A population accidentally forming two):** This is a possible (though often unsuccessful) pathway to speciation, not a roadblock.



"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah takhsees key marhalah ki durust tor parr wazahat karta hay? ,"The correct answer is **C: Yeah nayi parjatiyon ki tashkeel ka hawalah deta hay**.

Here's why:

The provided text *directly* explains speciation as the process by which new species are formed. It describes how isolated populations evolve differently and eventually become so distinct that they can no longer interbreed. Option C accurately reflects this core concept.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yeah uss waqt waqea hota hay jabb koyi nayi aabadi mowafiqat karney key qaabil na ho:** This is incorrect. Speciation happens even when a population *can* adapt, but the environment favors different adaptations.
* **B: Yeah irteqaa key marhalah ka ahem pahlu hay:** While speciation is related to evolution, this statement doesn't specifically capture the *process* of speciation. Evolution is a broader term.
* **D: Iska woqoo naguzer hay:** While speciation is a common outcome of evolution, stating it's inevitable doesn't fully explain *what* speciation *is*.



"
Gardish system ka konsa hissah dil tak khoon ko pahunchata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sharyanein (Arteries)**.

The passage states: ""Khoon dill say eek aise tube mein jaataa hay jis ko arteries kehtay hain..."" which translates to ""Blood goes into a tube from the heart which is called arteries...""  Arteries are the vessels that carry blood *away* from the heart.
"
Konsey tube gardish system mein sabsey chotey hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Bareek royein (Capillaries)**.

The passage describes how blood travels through tubes, mentioning arteries and veins.  It then states that the *smallest* tubes are called capillaries. Therefore, capillaries are the smallest tubes in the circulatory system.
"
Eek keedey ki apney paron ko waapas tah karney ki salahiyat darjah zail mein sey kisko badhati hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaghon ko chipana (Hiding in places)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability of many insects to reattach their wings provides a ""big range of small places to hide from wild animals."" This directly relates to the benefit of hiding.  The other options are mentioned as benefits of flight in general, but the reattaching ability specifically enhances hiding.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon ebarat mein kisi aisi cheez key tor parr mazkoor nahein hay jo kisi keedey ki udney ki salahiyat sey motassir hoti ho?,"The correct answer is **B: Zindagi ki muddat (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how flight affects:

* **Killing enemies more easily:** (directly related to flight)
* **Finding food and mates more efficiently:** (directly related to flight)
* **Regrowing wings/parts:** (related to flight)
* **Hiding from predators:** (related to flight)

While lifespan *could* be indirectly affected by flight (e.g., escaping predators could increase lifespan), the passage doesn't explicitly link it to flight's advantages. The other options – population increase (related to finding mates), foraging (related to finding food), and survival (related to hiding) – are all directly impacted by the ability to fly.

Therefore, lifespan is the only option that isn't directly mentioned as being influenced by the insect's ability to fly.
"
Darjah zail konsi khosusiyat aam tor parr dinosaur sey wabastah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Pankhein (Wings)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that these creatures are birds, but people don't accept them as dinosaurs because they fly and have feathers.** This implies that while birds are descended from dinosaurs, the presence of wings and feathers is what makes people hesitant to consider them dinosaurs.  The passage *contrasts* this with other dinosaur-like features.

* **The passage explicitly lists other dinosaur-like features:** feathers, claws, laying eggs, and walking on two legs.

Let's look at why the other options are related to dinosaurs:

* **A: Pichley pair par chalna (Walking on hind legs):**  The passage specifically mentions that these creatures walk on their hind legs, which is a dinosaur-like trait.
* **C: Andey dena (Laying eggs):**  Dinosaurs were reptiles, and reptiles lay eggs. This is a defining characteristic.
* **D: Panjon walaa pair (Clawed feet):** The passage states they have claws on their feet, a characteristic found in many dinosaurs.



Therefore, wings/pankhein are the exception. Birds evolved *from* dinosaurs but didn't *have* wings as dinosaurs did.  The passage highlights this difference in the context of why some people don't accept birds as dinosaurs.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko aam tor parr parindon aur dinosaur ki mushtarekah khosusiyat nahein samjha jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Udney ki salahiyat (Ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while these birds are believed to be descendants of dinosaurs, many people don't accept this because they are birds that *can fly*. However, the passage *also* points out that many similarities between these birds and dinosaurs *don't* include the ability to fly.  The passage specifically mentions that they ""ball wo parr rakhtay aur udnay key qaabil they"" (have feathers and can fly), but then highlights other dinosaur-like characteristics that *don't* relate to flight.

The other options are listed as similarities:

*   **Anday dena (Laying eggs):** Both birds and dinosaurs are reptiles and lay eggs.
*   **Chalney key liye pichley do pairon ka istemaal karna (Using their hind legs for walking):**  The passage explicitly states this similarity.
*   **Panjon waley pair (Clawed feet):** The passage mentions this as a dinosaur-like feature of these birds.



Therefore, the ability to fly is the characteristic that is *least* commonly associated with these birds and dinosaurs, and thus the best answer to the question."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Khajoor ki tarah key podah ka konsa hissa eek Triceratops key liye khana mumkin hosakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tanaa khaaney say pehle patton ko utaarnay keliye sah qarni sosaar apni qawee chonch kaa istemaal karsakta thaa.""  This directly implies that Triceratops (Sah-Qarni Sosmaar) ate the *stem* (tanaa) of the plant before removing the leaves. 

The passage also mentions they could eat the leaves, but the question asks about a *possible* part to eat. While the passage suggests they *could* eat the leaves, the statement specifically indicates they used their beak to remove the leaves *before* eating the stem. The other options (tezh pattiyan - sharp leaves, jadd - root, fal - fruit) are not mentioned as being eaten by the Triceratops.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko eek Triceratops key liye khana sabsey zaiyadah mumkin hay? ","The correct answer is **B: Sakhat shaakhon walaa eek podah (A plant with tough branches)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Triceratops had powerful beaks capable of chewing both leaves and tough stems/roots. 
* Option B directly aligns with this description of tough plant matter that a Triceratops could consume.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek sloth (A sloth):** Sloths are known for eating leaves, but they are not mentioned in the text as being capable of consuming tough plant material.
* **C: Eek totaa (A parrot):** While parrots can eat toxic plants, the text suggests that the plants in question might be toxic enough to deter dinosaurs.
* **D: Zahreeley fal waala eek podah (A plant with poisonous fruits):** The text presents conflicting theories about the plants' toxicity. One theory suggests they were eaten, while the other suggests they were poisonous. Since there's a possibility they *were* poisonous, it's less likely a Triceratops would have consumed them.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsey darjah zail khel ko wasee paimaney parr Itly key sabsey shumaali khitton mein mashhoor hay?","The correct answer is **C: Baraf raani (Ice hockey)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Sarmayi khel shumali mintaqon mein ziyadah maqbool hain..."" which translates to ""Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions...""
* Among the listed sports, ""Baraf raani"" (Ice Hockey) is the only winter sport mentioned.
* While F1 motor racing is mentioned, it's a global sport and not tied to a specific region in Italy. Football is popular throughout Italy but not exclusively in the far north. Volleyball and Water polo aren't explicitly linked to the northern regions in the provided text.

Therefore, considering the information about winter sports being popular in the north, **Ice Hockey (Baraf raani)** is the most likely answer.
"
"Ebarat mein di gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsey khel mein itly key liye aalami championship ki jeet haasil hui hay?","The correct answer is **A: Football**.

The passage states: ""Itly kee qomi football team germani kee qomi football team key saath duniya kee doosri sab say kamiyab team hay aur 2006 mein fifa world cup kee champion thee.""  This directly indicates that Italy won a world championship in football (soccer).
"
Kis waqea key baad Luxembourg key makhsus hissey Belgian ban gaye thay?,"The correct answer is **B: Belgian ka inqilaab**.

The text states: ""Belgium key aaj key dor key hissay maazi mein lagzambarg kaa hissah they lekin 1830 key inqilabi belgium key baad belgium mein shaamil ho gaye."" This directly links the Belgian Revolution of 1830 to Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Luxembourg ki gair jaanibdari ko motassir kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Jarmani ka qabzah**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Lagzeemborg nay hameshah eek ghairjanibdar mulk rehney kee koshish kee hay magar uss parr jang azeem awwal aur jang azeem doim mein germani nay qabzah kiya thaa.""  This directly links German occupation to the impact on Luxembourg's neutrality.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * **B: European Union mein shaamil hona:** Luxembourg joined the EU, but this didn't *affect* its neutrality; rather, it was a step towards integration.
    * **C: Belgian ka inqilaab:** The Belgian Revolution led to Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium, undermining its neutrality at that time.
    * **D: Aazad mulk bananaa:**  Luxembourg becoming a free country is the *opposite* of something that would impact neutrality. It's a state of being.



"

The question asks for the area of Turkey in Europe. The text states: ""23764 morabbaa kelometer (9174 morabbaa meel) europ mein hay.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, taqrban kitna meel lamba turkii hay?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Turki kaa raqbah 1600 kelometer (1,000 meel) say ziyadah lamba aur 800 kelometer (500 meel) chodaa hay."" This directly answers the question of Turkey's approximate length.
"
Vatican shahar mein kiskey liye latini zubaan istemaal hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Mazhabi taqribaat**.

The text explicitly states: ""laatini zubaan aksar mazhabi taqribaat mein istemaal hoti hay"" which translates to ""Latin language is often used in religious rituals.""
"
"Vatican shahar mein, Itly zubaan kiskey liye istemaal nahein hoti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Roz marrah ki mowasilat** (Daily communication).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Atalian bhee rozmarrah boli jaaney waali zubaan hay jisay kaafi saare log jo riyasat mein kam kartay hain, istemaal kartay hain..."" which translates to ""Italian is also a daily spoken language used by many people who work in the state...""

* It also says: ""...laatini zubaan aksar mazhabi taqribaat mein istemaal hoti hay..."" meaning ""...Latin is often used in religious ceremonies...""

* The text says that Italian is used in the legal system and official communications. Therefore, Italian *is* used in those areas.

* **Italian is *not* used for daily communication** among many people working in the state, as Italian is used for official purposes.  The daily spoken language is Italian. 

Therefore, Italian is the language *not* used for daily communication among those working in the state.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko umdah computeron parr aawaz khalt malt karney sey faayedah hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mosiqi (Music)**.

The passage explicitly states that music is ""generally recorded using complex computers to further manipulate the sounds and blend them together."" This directly aligns with the question asking who benefits from using computers to mix audio.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Harkat andaziyan (Animations):** While computers are used for animation, the passage focuses on image and video manipulation, not audio.
* **C: Tasaaveer (Pictures/Images):** The passage mentions computers for image and video manipulation but doesn't focus on audio benefits.
* **D: Tameer (Construction/Building):** This option is irrelevant to the passage's content about computer use for audio manipulation.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss mahalle waqoo key aksar makanaat ki khosusiyat mein flush waley baitul khlaa they","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hadapah aur mohan jodaro key shehron key taqriban harr ghar mein flush baitul khala thaa..."" which translates to ""Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet...""

Therefore, Mohenjo-daro is the city where flush toilets were commonly found in homes.
"
Darjah zail kiss mahalle waqoo mein taraqqi yaaftah naalon key nezaam paye jatey thay?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hadapah aur mohan jodaro key shehron key taqriban harr ghar mein flush baitul khala thaa..."" which translates to ""In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet...""

The other options are mentioned as places where sanitation practices (like cleanliness rituals) existed but not specifically as places where flush toilets were common.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon eek skater key mudney ki wajah hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Skate key blade key nichey thoda sa mudan (A slight bend at the bottom of the skate blade).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Choon keh blade kaa bottom halka tedha hay lehaza jab blade eek yaa doosri samt jhukta hay to uss kaa kanarah jo barf key contact mein hay woh bhee tedha ho jaataa hay."" This translates to: ""Because the blade's bottom is slightly bent, when the blade bends in one direction or another, the edge that is in contact with the snow also becomes bent.""  This bending of the blade directly causes the skater to turn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Stake key blade parr dohrey kinaarey (Double edges on the skate blade):** While double edges are common, the passage doesn't mention them as the cause of turning.
* **C: Skater ki tamaam maharat ki satah (The skater's entire skill level):**  Skill level influences how well a skater can control their turns, but it doesn't *cause* the turn in the way the blade's bend does.
* **D: Baraf ka meyaar (Snow quality):** Snow quality might affect how easily the skates glide, but it doesn't cause the turning mechanism described.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr jadid baraf key stake ki blade parr suraakh ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Jhuka hua (Bent)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the blade has a ""halka tedha"" (slightly crooked) bottom. This means the blade is bent.  This bend is the reason the skater's direction changes when they lean.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dohrey kinarey waala (Double-sided):** This describes a characteristic of some blades but doesn't explain the bending action and its effect on direction.
* **B: Muda hua (Twisted):**  Twisting would cause a different effect than a bend in the blade's bottom.  While twisting *could* affect direction, the passage focuses on the bend.
* **C: Kamaan numa (Arch-shaped):** While some blades have an arch, this doesn't directly describe the key feature (the slight crookedness) causing the directional change.



Therefore, **Jhuka hua (Bent)** is the most accurate description of the blade's feature described in the passage."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa tariqah kaar hay jo atoms ko roshni sey ziyadah energy ko khatam karney ki ijazat deta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Photons ka hausalah afzaa ikhraaj (Spontaneous Emission of Photons)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Apni sabqah energy level tak wapas lotnay key liye inn ko uss faazil energy ko khalaas karnaa hoga inhon nay roshni say hasill kiya. woh roshni key eek chhote zarray ko jisay **""photoon"" kahaa jaataa hay, paida karr key aisa kartay hain.""** (To return to their original energy level, they need to get rid of that excess energy they gained from light. They do this by creating a small packet of light called a ""photon"".)
* Further, the passage describes this process as: ""Sciencedan iss amal ko **""""shuaa kaa mutaharrik ikhraaj"""" kehtay hain** keunkeh chamakdar roshni key zariah zarraat mutaharrik hotay hain, jiski wajah say ziyaa kaa photoon khaarij hota hay..."" (Scientists call this process ""spontaneous emission"" because particles become excited by bright light, causing a photon of light to be emitted...)

Therefore, **Photons ka hausalah afzaa ikhraaj** accurately describes the method atoms use to release excess energy gained from light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Taabkari (Absorption)** - This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes. Absorption is when atoms *take in* photons to gain energy.
* **C: Photon** - A photon is a *particle of light*, not a process.
* **D: Taabkari ka hausalah afzaa ikhraaj (Spontaneous Emission of Absorption)** -  This is nonsensical.  Absorption isn't a spontaneous emission process.



"
Kis wajah sey eek atom photon ka ikhraaj karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Chamakdaar roshni ki wajah sey moharrik**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Woh roshni key eek chhote zarray ko jisay ""photoon"" kahaa jaataa hay, paida karr key aisa kartay hain. Sciencedan iss amal ko ""shuaa kaa mutaharrik ikhraaj"" kehtay hain keunkeh chamakdar roshni key zariah zarraat mutaharrik hotay hain, jiski wajah say ziyaa kaa photoon khaarij hota hay...""

This means atoms emit photons *because* they are energized by light.  The light's energy causes the particles within the atom to become energized and then emit photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ziyadah energy chodna:** While energy is involved, the passage doesn't say the atom emits photons simply because it has excess energy. The energy must be *received* from a source (light) first.
* **C: Gair mustahkam energy ki sathein:**  The passage doesn't mention unstable energy levels as the cause of photon emission.
* **D: Taabkari ka eek manfi radde amal:**  This isn't a concept mentioned in the passage.

"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, keya hadsati tor parr eek roshni key bulb key kaam karna band karney ki wajah ban jaye gaa?","The correct answer is **C: Bulb key andar key soot ka jal jaana (Burning of the filament inside the bulb)**.

The text clearly states: ""Sainkadon ghanton key operation key baad bulb kaa flament bilakhir jaal gayaa..."" which translates to ""After hundreds of hours of operation, the bulb's filament finally burned out...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Roshni key band ko sahi tariqah sey band na kiya ja rahaa ho (Not turning off the light properly):** This is related to safety and preventing electric shock, not the cause of the bulb burning out.
* **B: Bulb ki dhaat ki buniyaad ko sirf juzwi tor parr socket mein rakhnaa (Leaving the metallic base of the bulb partially in the socket):**  This is a safety hazard that can cause electric shock, but doesn't explain why the bulb stopped working.
* **D: Socket mein bijli key bahao ka nichey dikhana (Directing the flow of electricity downwards in the socket):** This is not a cause of the bulb burning out.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon roshni key bulb ko badaltey waqt mumkanah tor parr chooney key liye khatarnaak ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Bulb ki buniyaad (Bulb base)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""agar aap socket key andar yaa bulb key dhaati hissay ko juzwi tor par socket key andar baaqi rahte hoay hee chhoo lete hain to iss say aap ko bijli kaa shadeed jhatka lag sakta hay.""  This means touching the metal base of the bulb, even if part of it remains outside the socket, is dangerous because it's directly connected to the electricity.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Soot (Soot)**: Soot is carbon and generally not conductive.
* **B: Light ki button (Light button)**: The light button is part of the switch and is designed to be safely operated.
* **D: Cable (Cable)**: While cables can be dangerous if damaged, the passage specifically highlights the danger of touching the bulb's metal part when electricity is flowing.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, nucleus key motafarriq hotey waqt keya hota hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tawanayi chodi jaati hay (Energy is released)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""tab nucleus ko dobarah taqsim karnay kee wajah say uss mein say kuchh tawanayi khaarij hoti hay"" which translates to ""then, because the nucleus is divided again, some energy is released from it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Protons haasil hotey hein (Protons are produced):** The passage doesn't mention the production of protons.  It focuses on the *splitting* of the nucleus.
* **C: Atom gair mustahkam bann jaatey hein (Atoms become unstable):** The passage says that *some* energy is released *when* the nucleus is split, implying instability isn't necessarily the cause, but rather a consequence of the energy release.
* **D: Neutrons gum ho jaatey hein (Neutrons are lost):** While neutrons *can* be released during nuclear fission, the passage doesn't specifically say they are lost. The focus is on the release of energy.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon lambi doori key zameen tak waapas aaney waali callz ki akkasi karta hay,"The correct answer is **B: Satellites**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how satellites are used for long-distance calls, especially when the recipient is thousands of miles away. It details how satellites relay signals and are launched into space via rockets. The question asks which option relates to long-distance calls that come back to Earth.  Satellites are the key component in making such calls possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Door beenein (Distant telescopes):** Telescopes are used to *observe* space, not to facilitate calls.
* **C: Roshniyaan (Lights):** Lights are mentioned as being affected by the atmosphere, but don't directly relate to long-distance communication.
* **D: Rockets:** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites, not to make or receive the calls themselves.



"
Inmein sey kiska istemaal doorbeen ko khala mein rakhney key liye hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Rockets**.

The text states: ""Satellite ko rocket key zariye khalaa mein bheja gayaa."" (The satellite is sent to space by a rocket.)  Rockets are used to launch satellites and telescopes into space.
"
Waqt key guzarney ka suraag laganey key liye eek gardish waley waqea key baarey mein kis cheez ko note karna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Takraar (Repetition)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Aap kisee chakkar waale waaqiye kee takraar kaa moshahidah karkay waqt guzarnay kee nishandahi aap khud karr saktay hain."" which translates to ""You can mark the passage of time by observing the repetition of a cyclical event.""

Therefore, **takraar (repetition)** is the key element to note when trying to gauge the passage of time through a cyclical event.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi waqea ka konsa pahlu mowaznah key liye istemaal honey walaa waqt hota hay?","The correct answer is **B: Takraar (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aap kisee chakkar waale waaqiye kee takraar kaa moshahidah karkay waqt guzarnay kee nishandahi aap khud karr saktay hain. chakkarwala waaqiah eek aisi cheez hay jo baar baar baqayedgi key saath hota hay."" (You can mark the passage of time by observing the repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens repeatedly in a regular manner.)

The passage explicitly links the observation of cyclical repetition to marking the passage of time.  ""Takraar"" directly translates to repetition.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tewalat (Duration):** While duration is related to time, the passage focuses on *observing* the passage of time through repeating events, not by measuring its length.
* **C: Tajarbah (Experience):** Experience is a broader concept and not the specific focus of the passage's method for gauging time.
* **D: Asar (Effect):** Effect is the outcome of something, not a way to measure the passage of time itself.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko taaj key waris key liye aam samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **A: 2:2 degree Haasil karna**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Charles bartanvi shahi khandaan kaa pehla member thaa jisay degree di gayee thee,"" and then mentions he earned a ""tareekh, 2:2"".  This implies that earning a degree, even a 2:2, was unusual and significant for a member of the royal family at the time, and therefore likely relevant to the heir's status. The other options describe actions, not qualifications or degrees."
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Charles keya karney walaa pahla shakhs thaa?","The correct answer is **A: School khatam karney sey pahley foj mein shaamil hona**.

The passage states: ""Rewayat, school kee padhayi khatam karnay key baad takht kaa waaris seedhay fauj mein chala jaataa thaa..."" (Tradition dictated that the heir to the throne went directly into the army after finishing school...). Then it goes on to say Charles did something *different* - he went to university. Therefore, before going to university, the expected action was to join the army.
"
Trygvasson ka beda kis mulk ka thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The passage states: ""Qeyadat norway key baashinde aulf traguason nay..."" which translates to ""The leadership was taken by the people of Norway, Aulf Traguson..."".
"
Tarikh mein kis waqt jarmani ney Estonia parr eek mazboot saqafati asar dala thaa?,"The answer is **C: Taqriban 600 saal pahley (Approximately 600 years ago)**.

The text states: ""saqafati tor parr shumali astonia germani key zer asar thaa"" which translates to ""culturally, northern Estonia was under German influence."" The rest of the paragraph details the German influence and the creation of the Estonian language based on German script, indicating this influence happened several centuries ago.  600 years ago is the most likely timeframe given the context.
"
Estonia ki zubaan kiss cheez sey motassir hui thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Jarmani horrufe tahajji (German alphabet)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yeah german horoof tahajji parr mabni thaa..."" which translates to ""It was based on the German alphabet..."".  While the German monks and their religious goals are mentioned, the direct linguistic influence is the German alphabet.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, madri hindi boney walon ki tadaad kis unsur ki buniyaad parr kamo besh hoti rahti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Agar hindi sey bahut momasil elaaqayi zubanon ko bhi shumaar kiya jaa raha hay.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the difference in the number of Hindi speakers depends on whether closely related dialects are counted as separate languages. 
*  The phrase ""bahut momasil elaaqayi zubanon"" translates to ""many representative regional languages.""  This means that if you include all the dialects that are considered part of the Hindi language family, the total number of speakers increases significantly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agar urdu bolney walon ko shumaar kiya jaa raha hay:** Urdu speakers are counted separately; the passage highlights the similarities and differences *between* Hindi and Urdu.
* **C: Agar zuban ko samajh paney waley logon ko shumaar kiya jaa raha hay:** The passage gives an estimate of those who *understand* Hindi (800 million), but the core issue is how many *speak* it.
* **D: Agar zuban ko padh paney waley logon ko shumaar kiya jaa raha hay:** Reading ability is a separate skill from speaking ability and not directly related to the number of speakers.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon hindi aur urdu zubanon key baarey mein sahi bayaniyah hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wohh zakhirah alfaaz aur rasmul khatt donon mein momasil hoti hein (They are represented in both vocabulary and script).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Zakhirahe alfaz key lehaaz say hindi aur urdu yaksaan hain lekin tarz tehreer judagana hay"" which translates to ""In terms of vocabulary, Hindi and Urdu are the same but their script is different.""
* Option C accurately reflects this statement, mentioning both vocabulary (zakhirahe alfaz) and script (rasmul khatt).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dono zubanon key bolney walon key darmiyaan aam tor parr eek inqetaa hota hay (There is generally a break/discontinuity between the speakers of both languages):** The passage says they can generally understand each other in everyday conversation, so there's no major break.
* **B: Wohh rasmul khatt mein mukhtalif hoti hein (They are different in script):** While true, this is incomplete.  Option C is better because it also includes the vocabulary.
* **D: wohh zakhirah alfaaz mein mukhtalif hoti hein (They are different in vocabulary):**  The passage states that their vocabulary is the *same*.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Hangeul horufe tahajji key baarey mein durust haqiqat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Isko badshah Sejong key ahed key aaghaz mein ijaad kiya gaya thaa** (It was created at the beginning of King Sejong's reign).

Here's why:

* **King Sejong created Hangul during his reign (1418-1450).** However, the question asks about the *beginning* of his reign.  Hangul was developed over time, not created instantly at the very start of his rule.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Horufe tahajji ka asal naam Hunan Jeongeum thaa** (The original name of Hangul was Hunmin Jeongeum) - This is a true statement.  ""Hunmin Jeongeum"" literally means ""Correct Sounds for the Instruction of the People.""
* **C: Isko Joseon saltanat key chotey badshah ney ijaad kiya thaa** (It was created by the youngest king of the Joseon dynasty) - King Sejong was the fourth king, but he was the *youngest* king during his reign.
* **D: Isko jaan boojh kar ijaad kiya gaya thaa** (It was created with intention) -  The creation of Hangul was a deliberate and thoughtful endeavor by King Sejong to improve literacy among the common people.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that isn't entirely accurate.



"
Horufe tahajji Hunmin Jeongeum aakhir kaar kiss sey badal gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

Here's why:

* The text states that King Sejong created the Hangeul alphabet, which is also known as Hunmin Jeongeum.
* While Sejong is the creator, the *alphabet itself* is Hangeul.
* Joseon was a dynasty, not an alphabet.
* Jeongeum is the original name for Hangeul, but the alphabet itself is Hangeul.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi zubanein Sanskrit sey motssir hui theen?","The correct answer is **D: Hindustani zubanein**.

The passage states: ""Sanskrit behad pechidah aur zarkhez zubaan hay, jis nay mutaddid jadeed hindustani zubanon key maakhaz key tor parr khidmat anjaam di hai..."" which translates to ""Sanskrit is a very complex and sophisticated language, which has served as the source for many modern Hindustani languages...""

While the passage mentions Latin and European languages as parallels, it explicitly states that Sanskrit influenced modern Hindustani languages.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss wajah sey Sanskrit ka istemaal kam hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Latini zubanein**.

The passage states: ""Apnishdon kee tadween key baad, mazhabi rehnumaon kee wajah say sansikrit kamzor ho gayee.""  While the passage mentions the influence of Latin on European languages, it directly states that religious leaders caused Sanskrit's decline after the composition of the Upanishads. The passage *doesn't* say that Latin languages are the reason Sanskrit decreased in use.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Io parr kashishe seql key motalliq durust bayaniyah hay?","The correct answer is **A: Zameen ki kashishe seql Io ki kashishe seql ki banisbat aap parr kam khinchao rakhey gee**

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** ""agar tham lau kee satah parr khaday ho to tumhara vazan zameen parr tumhare vision say kam ho gaa."" This means the gravitational force (weight) experienced on Io is less than the gravitational force experienced on Earth.
* **The problem provides weight figures:** It explicitly states that a person weighing 200 pounds on Earth would weigh only 36 pounds on Io.
* **Therefore:** The gravitational pull on Io is weaker than the gravitational pull on Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Io ki kashishe seql ziyadah khinchao rakhti hay, jiski wajah sey aap kam rastah payein gey:** This is the opposite of what the problem and the weight figures indicate.
* **C: Io ki kashishe seql ziyadah khinchao rakhti hay, jiss ki wajah sey aapka wazan ziyadah hogaa:**  Again, this is the opposite of the given information.
* **D: Zameen ki kashishe seql Io ki kashishe seql ki banisbat aap parr ziyadah khinchao rakhey gee:** This is incorrect because the problem directly states that Io's gravitational pull is weaker.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah chaand key baahari parat ki durust tor parr wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Side key paas waley mein ziyadah mota crust hay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yeah crust nazdiki jaanib taqriban 70 kelometer dabiz hay aur doosri jaanib 100 kelometer dabiz hay."" This directly translates to: ""This crust is approximately 70 kilometers thick on the near side and 100 kilometers thick on the far side.""

Therefore, the near side has a thicker crust than the far side.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ooncheyt hisson key taht crust ziyadah patla hota hay:** The passage doesn't mention a relationship between crust thickness and elevation.
* **C: Door ki side mein kam maria ho skati hay:** The passage doesn't connect maria (dark plains) to the crust's thickness.
* **D: Ooncheyt hisson key taht kam maria ho skati hay:** Similar to C, this is not supported by the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, chaand ka crust sabsey mota kahaan hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Qareebi side mein (On the near side)**.

The passage states: ""Yeah crust nazdiki jaanib taqriban 70 kelometer dabiz hay aur doosri jaanib 100 kelometer dabiz hay. Yeah maariyah key neechey patla aur pahadi elaqon key neechey motaa hay."" This translates to ""The crust on the near side is about 70 kilometers thick and on the far side is 100 kilometers thick. It is thin beneath maria and thick beneath mountainous regions.""

Therefore, the near side has a crust that is 70km thick, which is the *thicker* part of the crust mentioned in the passage.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kiss par kuch log yaqeen rakhtey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Doosrey sayyaron parr zindagi mojud hay** (Life exists on other planets).

Here's why:

The passage mentions that some people wonder ""what is there"" on other planets and believe ""perhaps aliens or other lives will flourish there."" This directly supports the idea that some people believe life exists beyond Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Insaano ney deegar sitaaron ka safar kiya hay** (Humans have traveled to other stars) - The passage states that such travel might not be possible for a very long time due to the vast distances between stars.
*   **B: Insaan deegar duniya ki daryaaft key qaabil nahein hein** (Humans are not capable of receiving a second world) - The passage discusses the *dream* of traveling to another planet and receiving a new world, not the impossibility of receiving one.
*   **D: Sitaron key darmiyaan trillion meelon sey kam hein** (The distance between stars is less than trillion miles) - The passage explicitly says the distances are ""thousands of miles"" (kharbon meel), the opposite of trillion miles.



"
Jitna ziyadah aap suraj key markaz sey door jaatey hein konsi cheez utni hi patli hoti jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Gas**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aap sooraj key markaz say door jaatay hain to gas nisbatan patli ho jaati hay."" (If you move away from the center of the sun, the gas becomes relatively thin.)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, suraj ka konsa hissah zameen sey maryee hay?","The correct answer is **B: Plasma**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sooraj mokammal tor par gason, aag aur plazmah say mill karr banaa hay."" This translates to ""The sun is completely made of gas, fire, and **plasma**.""  It also says that the outer layer we see is called the photosphere, which is called ""roshni kaa golah"" (sphere of light). Therefore, the sun's outer layer, which is visible, is primarily composed of plasma.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Crust:** The crust is a layer of solid rock, found on planets like Earth. The sun doesn't have a crust.
*   **C: Roshni ka korah (Sphere of light):** This is a descriptive term for the photosphere, not the composition of the sun itself.
*   **D: Markaz (Center):** While the center is important, the passage focuses on the composition of the outer layers that we see and that are more akin to what is found on Earth, like plasma.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsey moshahedah ney falakiyaat key nazriyah ki tayeed karney madad kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Zuhrah ka oboor (Transit of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states that Galileo's observation of Venus phases supported Copernicus's heliocentric model (planets orbiting the sun).**  Venus phases *could not* be explained by a geocentric model (Earth at the center).  This was a crucial piece of evidence.

* **The text then mentions Jeremiah Horrox observing Venus's transit in 1639.** A transit is when a celestial body passes directly between the observer and a star or planet.  A Venus transit is exceptionally rare and precise. Accurate observations of Venus transits over time allowed astronomers to calculate the size of the solar system and further solidify the heliocentric model.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zuhrah key marahil (Venus phases):** Galileo's observation of Venus phases *already* supported the heliocentric model, as the text states. So, it wasn't *needed* to *verify* the theory; it *helped to prove* it initially.
* **C: Suraj ki zohrah sey momaslatein (Sun's conjunction with Venus):**  While conjunctions are observable, they don't provide the same level of evidence as a transit.
* **D: Suraj ki chaand sey momaslatein (Sun's conjunction with the Moon):**  This is less significant for verifying the heliocentric model.



Therefore, the transit of Venus (Zuhrah ka oboor) was a key observation that strengthened the heliocentric theory through precise calculations and measurements.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Galileo Galilei ney 1610 mein moshahedah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Zuhrah key marahil (Phases of Venus)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah fezez sirf iss liye roonuma hotay hain keunkeh zahrah (yaa chand kee) soraj kee jaanib eyaan honey waali mahaz eek jaanib roshan hoti hay"" which translates to ""These phases only appear because Venus (or the moon) is only partially illuminated by the sun when it is positioned on the sun's side."" Galileo observed these phases of Venus in 1610.

While Galileo did support Copernicus's heliocentric theory (option C), the question asks what he *observed* in 1610. He observed the phases of Venus. Option A is related to the phases of Venus, but not the specific observation Galileo made. Option D (Transit of Venus) is a different phenomenon and not mentioned in the passage in connection with Galileo's observations.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Amazon darya kahaan sey paani jamaa karti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ziyadah choti daryayein (Many small rivers)**.

The passage states: ""uss mein hazaaron chhote driyaon say paani bah karr jamma hota hay"" which translates to ""It gathers water from thousands of small rivers.""
"
Konsi tareef Amazon darya sey mansub nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Yeah sabsey lambi darya hay**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Amazon nadi doosri sab say lambi aur zameen kee sab bary nadi hay."" which translates to ""Amazon river is the second longest and the largest river of the earth.""

The text also says ""Asl daryaae amazan 6,387 kelometer (3,980meel) lambi hay"" which means ""The actual Amazon river is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long"".

Since it is stated as *second* longest, the statement ""Yeah sabsey lambi darya hay"" (Yes, it is the longest river) is incorrect based on the given information. The other options (being the second longest, being the largest, and being the widest) are all consistent with the text.



"
Earat mein mazkoor kaam ki konsi line Venezuela key logon ki sabsey kam tadaad ko kaam faraham karti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Tel**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Venzvela kee ahem sanaat tel hay, jiska yeah mulk khalis baraamad kunindah hay, bawajood iskay tel kee sanaat mein sirf eek feesad log kam kartay hain."" (Oil is Venezuela's main industry, from which the country derives its net export revenue, despite only 1 percent of people working in the oil industry.)

This directly indicates that the oil industry provides the fewest jobs among the listed options.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa shobaa Venezuela key logon ki sabsey ziyadah tadaad ko kaam faraham karta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Khidmat (Services)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that **two-thirds (do tehayi)** of Venezuela's population works in the service sector. This is a significantly larger proportion than the other sectors mentioned.
* While oil is a major industry and a key export, only **one percent (ek feesad)** of the population works in the oil industry.
* Agriculture employs **one-fourth (ek chothayi)** of the population.
* Industry employs **one-fifth (panchwan hissah)** of the population.

Therefore, the service sector provides the most jobs in Venezuela."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Imtezaaj sey sitaron ko keya karney ki ijaazat milti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ziyadah bhaari anaasir ki tashkeel karney** (Forming heavier elements).

Here's why:

The passage states that stars produce light and heat through the energy released from the creation of heavier elements from lighter elements (hydrogen).  Fusion is the process of combining lighter elements to form heavier ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imtezaaj key reactor ki tameer karney (Building a fusion reactor):** The passage mentions that building practical fusion reactors is difficult and will take years. It doesn't say that fusion *allows* us to build them.
* **C: Roshni aur garmi ko chod deney (Discarding light and heat):**  The passage explicitly says that stars produce light and heat *through* the fusion process.
* **D: Hydrogen key atom bananey (Creating hydrogen atoms):**  Fusion is about combining elements, not creating them. Hydrogen is a starting point, not the result of fusion in stars.

Therefore, the core result of fusion in stars is the creation of heavier elements.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko eek mofeed imtezaaj ka reactor banaye gaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Atom**.

Here's why:

The passage states that fusion reactors aim to replicate the energy production process of stars, which involves heavier elements being created from lighter hydrogen atoms.  Therefore, the core element involved is the **atom**, specifically the process of atomic fusion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hydrogen:** While hydrogen is the fuel for fusion, it's not the reactor itself. The reactor needs to manipulate atoms.
* **B: Sitarey (Stars):** Stars are the natural fusion reactors, but the question asks *what* is the reactor made *of* (the fundamental building block).
* **D: Tawanayi (Power):**  Power is the *result* of fusion, not the component that creates the reactor.



"
Paani ki kimiyayi banawat keya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Do hydrogen atoms aur ek oxygen atom**.

The passage states: ""morakkab paani hydrogen key do aur oxygen key ek atom say mill karr banta hay."" which translates to ""The compound water is made by combining two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""
"
"Jabb paani ki shaklein tabdil ho jayein gee, to konsi cheez eek jaisi rah jaye gee?","The correct answer is **A: Salmaati saakht (Safety structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that water (like nitrogen) maintains the same chemical structure regardless of its physical state (liquid, solid, gas). The question asks what remains constant when water changes form. The passage explicitly states that the ""salmati saakht"" (safety structure/chemical structure) remains the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kasafat (Density):** The passage mentions that density changes between the different states of water.
* **C: Jismani kaifiyat (Physical qualities):**  The passage highlights that the physical qualities (like state - liquid, solid, gas) change.
* **D: Maye nitrogen (Liquid nitrogen):** This is a specific state of nitrogen, not a general property that remains constant in water.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, makhsus qanoon nafiz karney ki koshish kartey waqt darjah zail mein sey kon tees mulkon ka masalah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mulk key hukoomat ki taraf se bhaari nigraani (Heavy surveillance by the country's rulers)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the central government *relied on the state governors* to enforce its laws, but these governors *often did not cooperate*. This implies a lack of *heavy surveillance* or strong control from the central government's side. The other options are all directly mentioned as problems hindering the implementation of laws:

*   **B: Congress key andar power ki kami (Lack of power within the Congress):** The passage mentions the Congress's lack of power to collect taxes.
*   **C: Mutaafeqah manzoori ki darkaar islahaat (Need for unanimous consent for reforms):** The passage highlights that unanimous consent from the states was required for amendments, which was difficult to obtain because the states were largely absent.
*   **D: Eek gair mojud qomi executive (A non-existent national executive):** The passage states that a national council or a functional judiciary was absent, indicating a weak or non-existent national executive.



Therefore, heavy surveillance by the country's rulers is the *least* relevant issue mentioned in the passage regarding the difficulties in enforcing laws."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa bayaniyah inqilaabi jang key doraan markazi hukumat ki kaifiyat ki akkasi durust tor parr karta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mulk key nomaindon ki mojudgi ki kami thee** (There was a lack of the presence of representatives of the country).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""aur chonkeh yahaan koyee qomi majlis aamilah yaa adliah mojud nahein thee..."" (and since there was no effective national assembly or judiciary here...). This highlights the absence of a representative body, a crucial element for a strong central government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Congress aur mulk key hukkam ney tax naafiz kiya thaa** (Congress and the country's government had imposed taxes). The passage says the central government *lacked the power* to impose taxes.
* **B: Dafaat mein islahaat Congress ki zimmah daari parr munhasir theen** (Reforms in departments were solely the responsibility of Congress). The passage mentions the central government's difficulty in enforcing its laws and overcoming resistance from the state rulers.
* **D: Markazi hukumat do ahem ajzaa parr mushtamil thee** (The central government consisted of two important parts). The passage doesn't mention the structure of the central government.

Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the weakness of the central government during the revolutionary period, as emphasized in the passage."
Azadi key elaan ki pusht parr alfaaz kaisey likhey hein?,"The correct answer is **D: Chotey faant mein (In small letters)**.

The text states: ""Jab kisee ko waazeh tor parr malum nahein thaa keh iss ko kiss nay tehreer kiya hay, yeah malum thaa keh uski zindagi key awail mein baday charmi dastavez (jo 29 3/4 inch gunaa 24 1/2 inches hota thaa) oper storage keliye role kiya jaataa thaa. **To, yeah imkaan hay keh alaamat ko mahaz label key tor parr shaamil kiya gayaa tha.**""

The text suggests the writing on the back was likely a label, and labels are typically written in smaller letters. The context implies the writing wasn't intended to be prominently displayed. Therefore, option D is the most logical conclusion.

While the text doesn't *explicitly* state the font size, the inference is strongly supported by the nature of a label.
"
Singapore darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye jaana jaata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Shahri sarsabzi (Urban greenery)**.

The text states that the botanical gardens played a crucial role in transforming Singapore into a ""garden city."" This directly relates to urban greenery.
"
Vanda Miss Joaquim kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek phool (A flower)**.

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim was chosen as the national flower of Singapore.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Giza ahraamon key konsey meyaar parr misr ki nayi saltanat ko rashk karnaa mumkin nahein thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Unki tameer (Their construction)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the construction of the Giza pyramids was unmatched in terms of size and construction quality, even continuing under the final old dynasty.
* The new dynasties of Egypt were in awe of the pyramids built by their ancestors, highlighting their impressive construction.
* The passage specifically emphasizes the ""tameer"" (construction) aspect as being superior.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Unkey ahed (Their era):** While the old dynasty's era was significant, the passage focuses on the *construction itself*, not the period.
* **B: Patthar ka istemaal (Use of stone):**  Using stone was common in ancient Egypt.  It wasn't uniquely impressive.
* **C: Unki size (Their size):**  The passage mentions size, but it's explicitly the *quality* of the construction, combined with the size, that makes the pyramids remarkable.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Unki tameer (Their construction)**."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, barishon key hosul mein sabzah khor janwar kahaan sey safar kartey hein?","The correct answer is **B: Shumaali pahadiyaan (Northern hills)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the wildebeest migrate *from* the northern plains (shumaali medanon) *over* the river due to rains, and then return *from* the west/west-northwest, *crossing* the river again after the rains in April.  This implies their journey *starts* in the northern hills.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aprel key aas paas baaz waqt kis elaqah sey sabzi khor janwar rawanah hotey hein?","The correct answer is **D: Maasai Mara qomi reserve**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...phir maghrib key raastay wapas mashriq kee taraf baarish key baad april key aas paas dobarah maaraa nadi ko obur kartay hoay. Sarangeti elaqon mein sarangeti national park, tanzaniah kaa wangoro conservation elaqah aur **maaswa game reserve aur kenya kaa maasayi maaraa national reserve** shaamil hain...""

This clearly indicates that the migration happens through the Maasai Mara National Reserve. While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they aren't the specific location where the animals are migrating *through* around April.
"
Operation Sealion kiss mulk ka hamlah thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Garmani (Germany)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Germani nay jazirah Bartaniah parr hamlah kee tayyari shuroo kardi. Germani nay uss hamlay ko """"operation sea lyon"""" naam diyaa."" (Germany started preparing for an attack on the island of Britain. Germany named this attack ""Operation Sea Lion"".)
"
Bartaniyah parr hamely ko Jarmani ney keya naam diya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Germani nay uss hamlay ko """"operation sea lyon"""" naam diyaa."" which translates to ""Germany named that attack 'Operation Sea Lion'.""
"
Afriki momalik parr qabzah key itly key mansubah mein kisko zaruri qadam key tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Misr mein jahazon sey chutkarah paana**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Inn iqdamat key elawoh, Itly key jangi jahazon ko kuchh aur karnay kee zaroorat nahein thee. Abb japan key liye."" This translates to ""Besides these actions, Italy's warships didn't need to do anything else. Now for Japan.""

The text *does* mention needing to clear British bases and equipment in Egypt to launch troops towards Africa.  The other options are mentioned as necessary actions for Italy. Therefore, clearing the bases in Egypt is the *unmentioned* necessary step.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisko Itly ki jang ka buniyaadi maqsad samjha jaata thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Afiriki mamalik parr qabzah karna (Conquering African countries)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Inn mamalik parr qabzah karnay keliye, unn ko troop launching pad kee zaroorat padee hogi, taakeh unn kee faujein bahirah Rome say guzar karr afriqah parr hamlah kar sakein..."" (To conquer these countries, they would have needed a troop launching pad so that their armies could pass through Egypt and attack Africa...). This clearly indicates that conquering African countries was Italy's primary objective in the war.
"
Kisney halah aawaron key darmiyaan dostanah talluqaat qayem kiye they?,"The correct answer is **B: Vichy Fransisi**.

The passage states: ""yeah francisi log they jinhon nay 1940 mein germani key saath aman qayem kiya thaa aur hamlah aawaron say ladnay kee bajaye unn key saath mill kirr kam kiya."" (These French people had made peace with Germany in 1940 and instead of fighting the invaders, they cooperated with them.)

This describes the Vichy government, which collaborated with the Germans during World War II. Therefore, they were the ones who established friendly relations with the invaders.
"
Operation Dragoon mein shaamil ittehaadi kon thay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ameriki aur aazad fransisi** (American and Free French).

The text explicitly states: ""Sirf do hafton mein ameriki aur azad francisi afwaj nay jonubi france ko azad karaa lia..."" (In just two weeks, American and Free French forces liberated Southern France...)."
Kiss taknik ki taraqqi ki wajah sey aabdozon ney paani key nichey safar karna shuru kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

The passage states: ""Lekin jaise hee radar tayyaar honaa aur ziyadah durust hone laga, aabdozein nazar mein aaney say bachnay key liye paani key neechey jaaney parr majboor hogayein."" (But as soon as radar became ready and more accurate, submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid being seen.)

Therefore, the development of radar was the reason submarines started traveling underwater.
"
Apney pahley istemaal key doraan kashtiyon mein kiss elaqah mein bahut mahdood range thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Gasht karney (Patrolling)**.

The passage states: ""Jang azeem i aur jang azeem ii mein aab dozen istemaal kee gayee theen- pisse pusht unki raftaar bahut dheemi thee aur unn key hamlah karnay dairah kaafi mahdud thaa.""  This translates to: ""In World War I and World War II, submarines were used.  Their speed was very slow and the area in which they could attack was quite limited.""  Limited attack area implies a limited patrol range.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney moahedah ki khelaaf warzi ki thee? ","The correct answer is **D: Soviet key log**.

The text states that the Soviet Union, with its Red Army, invaded Poland and attacked its eastern territories in violation of several international treaties. The text specifically mentions the violation of the ""Reega Aman Muahidah, Soviet-Polish Adm jaarhiyat Muahidah, aur deegar bain alaqwami, dotarfah aur kasiruljahti muahidon kee khelaaf warzi mein.""  Therefore, the Soviet Union is identified as the party violating the treaties.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko Surkh foj ney anjaam nahein diya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Pul key sirey parr dobarah monazzam honaa (Re-organizing at the Polish frontier)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Poland's eastern territories were attacked *before* the creation of the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts.** The passage specifically mentions attacks *against* Poland's eastern territories.
* The Soviet Union's actions, as described, were focused on creating the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts and attacking Poland's eastern territories. 
* Re-organizing at the Polish frontier would have been a *Polish* action, not something the Red Army directly carried out.  The passage describes the Soviet Union attacking Poland, not assisting Poland in re-organizing.

Let's look at why the other options *were* actions of the Red Army:

* **A: Ukrainian ka front banana (Creating the Ukrainian Front):** This is explicitly stated in the passage.
* **B: Mashriqi khitton parr hamlah (Attacking the Eastern Territories):** This is directly mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Eek moahedah ki khelaaf warzi (Violation of a treaty):**  The passage mentions the violation of several treaties by the Soviet Union.



"
Itly ki dasvein foj key Engineer-in-Chief key saath keya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Usey bartanavi logon ney giraftaar kiya thaa (He was captured by the British).**

The passage states: ""Bardiya key mashriq mein kameen lagaa karr british nay atalvi daswein army key engineer inchief general lastakchi ko giraftar karr lia."" which translates to ""By laying an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the engineer-in-chief general Lastakchi of the Italian Tenth Army.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fort Capuzzo mein usey giraftaar kiya gaya thaa (He was captured in Fort Capuzzo):** The passage states he was captured east of Bardia, not in Fort Capuzzo.
* **B: Usey Tobruk mein qatal kar diya gaya thaa (He was killed in Tobruk):** The passage mentions the Governor-General and Balbo died in Tobruk due to friendly fire, not Lastakchi.
* **D: Usey dosti ki aag ney qatal kar diya tha (He was killed by friendly fire):** This refers to the Governor-General and Balbo, not Lastakchi.



"
Italo Balbo ko kahaan qatal kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The text states: ""28 june ko libya key governor general aur masulini key bazahir waaris marshel atalo balbo, tabrok mein landing key doraan dostana firing say halak hogaye they."" This translates to ""On June 28th, the Libyan governor general and Mussolini's apparent heir Marshal Italo Balbo died in Tobruk during friendly fire.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Konsi darjah zail taknik Tibet key moraqbah ka ahem hissah nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Yoga ki harakaat mein maharat haasil karna (Mastery of Yoga postures)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Tibetan meditation focuses on:

* **Kandalni Yuga:**  Developing clear thinking through breath exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
* **Moraqabe (Meditation):**  Central to Tibetan meditation, involving visualizing deities to clear energy channels and achieve clear awareness.
* **Love and Compassion:**  Expanded through the influence of Mahayana Buddhism and the Indian era.

While yoga postures (asanas) are part of yoga, and yoga *can* be incorporated into some meditation practices, the text *specifically* mentions breath exercises, mantras, and deity visualization as *core* elements of Tibetan meditation.  Mastery of yoga postures isn't mentioned as a fundamental component. Therefore, it's the least likely to be a primary part of Tibetan meditation based on the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Tibet key moraqbah key “markaz” key doraan chakra kaisey faal huey?","The correct answer is **B: Dewtaon ko tasavvur mein lakar (By visualizing deities)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tibbati moraqabe kaa markazi noqtah devta yuga hay. mukhtalif dewataon key tasavvur say tawanayi key channels saaf hojatay hain, chakkar mutaharrik hojatay hain aur roshan khayal shouoor paida hota hay."" (The central point of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Visualizing different deities cleanses the channels of ability, makes the chakras active, and creates bright thought and consciousness.)

Option B directly reflects this statement. While other options like yoga postures (A), mantra repetition (C), and breathing exercises (D) are part of Tibetan practices, the text specifically identifies *visualizing deities* as the central point for activating the chakras. Therefore, B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Program key doraan doosra aqeedat mandanah gaana kisney pesh kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

The text states: ""Mulk key mashhur gulukaron nay bhajan yaa aqeedat key gaaney shiri shayam key qadmon mein pesh kiye. Gulukaar sanju sharma nay shaam kaa aaghaz kiya aur uss key baad jay shankar choudhari nay chhappan bhoj bhajan bhee gaya..."" This translates to: ""Famous singers of the country offered bhajans or devotional songs to Shri Shyam. Singer Sanju Sharma started the evening and after him, Jai Shankar Choudhary also sang Chappan Bhog Bhajan...""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, khana chadhaney key doraan kisney aqeedat mandanah gaana pesh kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""Phir, lakha singh nay bhajan gaaney mein sab ko peeche chhod diyaa. Lakha singh nay chhappan bhog bhajan bhee gaya."" This directly indicates that Lakha Singh sang the bhajan during the offering of the 56 bhog.
"
Shaam ki dusri aakhiri kaar kardagi kiya thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Anatolia ki aag**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Aakhir mein, turki key raqqaas group **fire of anatoliya** nay """"traye"""" show kaa mozahirah kiya."" which translates to ""Finally, the Turkish dance group **Fire of Anatolia** demonstrated its """"Traye"""" show.""
"
Alessandro Safina ki qomiyat kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Italy**.

The text states that Alessandro Safina is an ""Atalvi tenor"" and mentions he performed with Turki Sahira Season.  However, Alessandro Safina is actually an Italian singer. The text is a bit confusing in its phrasing!
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaat parr, konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Sawari sey pahley shakhs ko utarney mein kam sey kam 60 minat lagey they**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that it took ""kam az kam eek ghantah"" (at least one hour) to get the first person down from the roller coaster. 
* Option D says ""kam sey kam 60 minat lagey they"" (at least 60 minutes) - this is *not* supported by the passage, which specifies one hour.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Santa Clara mein aag lagi thee** (There was a fire in Santa Clara): The passage says it was a very hot day, which often accompanies fires.
* **B: Roller coaster parr log fans gaye thay** (People got stuck on the roller coaster): The passage explicitly states this: ""Roller coaster parr kisee bhee waqt phans jaana bahut takleef dah hoga..."" (Getting stuck on the roller coaster would be very troublesome...).
* **C: Mosaafiron ko paani diya gayaa tha** (Passengers were given water): The passage says, ""Musafiron ko paani diyaa gayaa tha...""

Therefore, only option D contains information that is *not* stated in the text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bechain kaney waali garmi ki satah key baarey mein kisney tabsarah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Aag ka kaptaan (Fire captain)**.

The passage states: ""Fire captain Scot Konas said, 'It was a very hot day in Santa Clara when the temperature was in the 90s.'"" This directly identifies the fire captain as the person commenting on the hot weather.
"
Sunami ki sargarmi ki wajah sey taaqat ki gair faaliyat kahaan thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""...paagoo paagoo aur **new key qareeb kuch waazeh sonami srgarmi mojud thee. Tonga mein koyee badaa noqsan yaa chot kee khabar nahein aayi...""** This translates to ""...some clear tsunami activity was present near Pago Pago and **Niue**. No major damage or injury was reported in **Tonga**...""

While Pago Pago and Niue experienced tsunami activity, the power outage specifically happened in Tonga. Therefore, Tonga is the correct answer.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Tonga parr taaqat ki gair faaliyat ka kaisey asar hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Hukkam motalliqah tanbihaat wosul karney key qaabil nahein thay**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""sonami warning Tongaayi hukkaam mosul nahein karr paaye"" which translates to ""Tonga authorities were unable to issue a tsunami warning."" This directly indicates that the warnings couldn't be received or disseminated effectively.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuchh noqsaan ki report mili thee (Some damage reports were received):** While it mentions no major damage, the passage *does* state that electricity was temporarily cut, which *is* a form of damage/impact. However, it's not the *primary* impact mentioned in the context of the question about the *effect* of the seismic activity.
* **B: Uthaye gaye tanbihaat key baarey mein hukkam ko khabar nahein mili thee (Authorities didn't receive information about the issued warnings):** The passage says the authorities *couldn't issue* warnings, not that they didn't *receive* information about them.
* **C: Samunadar ki satah ki readingein motassir hui theen (Ocean level readings were affected):** The passage mentions that the ocean level was affected and caused the tsunami, but the question asks about the *effect* of the seismic activity, not the effect of the tsunami itself.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate reflection of how the seismic activity impacted Tonga, according to the passage.
"
Jonny Reid ki driving raftaar ka andazah lganey key liye police kabb apni radar banduqein istemaal karney key qaabil theen?,"The correct answer is **C: Jabb wohh 160 kailometer fee ghanta sey ziyadah parr chala raha thaa**.

The passage states: ""Mister Red nay pul key oper saat baar 160 kelometer say bhee ziyadah fee ghantah kee raftaar say... black beauty ko chalanay mein kamiyabi haasil kee.""  This means the police were able to use their radar guns when his speed exceeded 160 km/h.  Option C is the most accurate reflection of this information.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, New Zealand police key liye Jonny Reid ki raftaar ka andazah lgana mushkil keon thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Wohh 160 kailometer fee ghanta key taht chala raha thaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states the police had trouble knowing how fast Jonny Reid was going *because* the Black Beauty car was very slow. This makes it difficult for the police to accurately read the speed radar.  The police only caught him when he slowed down to 160 km/h.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Car bahut aahistah thee (The car was very slow):** The car being slow *contributed* to the difficulty, but it wasn't the *reason* the police couldn't estimate his speed.
* **C: Usney sirf pul parr saat baar chalaya thaa (He only drove on the bridge seven times):** The number of times he drove on the bridge is irrelevant to the speed estimation problem.
* **D: Auckland Harbour pul bahut puraana thaa (The Auckland Harbour bridge was very old):** The bridge's age is irrelevant to the speed estimation problem.



"
Butte key talluq sey zalzalah ka markaz kahaan thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 meel jonub**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Beaut say taqriban 65 kelometer (40 meel) jonub thaa."" This translates to ""It was approximately 40 miles south of Butte.""
"
Abu Ghraib mein fasaad key doraan kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Qaidiyon ki badsoluki (Prisoner abuse)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what happened *during* the chaos (fasaad) at Abu Ghraib. The passage states the jail became infamous *after* the abuse of prisoners was revealed. While the fire and US control were part of the events, the core issue that caused the infamy was the abuse of prisoners.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Tala bandi (Imprisonment):** While prisoners *were* imprisoned, this wasn't the event itself during the chaos.
* **C: Ameriki fojon ney control sanbhaal liya thaa (US forces took control):** This happened *after* the chaos and the abuse was discovered.
* **D: Jail mein aag laga di gayi thee (The jail was set on fire):**  The fire was *one* aspect of the chaos, but not the main reason for the jail's infamy. The abuse of prisoners was the crucial event.



"
Iraqi jail ko badnami keon mili thee? ,"The correct answer is **D: Qaidi ki badsoluki ki daryaaft (Reports of abuse of prisoners)**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* the jail became infamous. The provided text states the jail became notorious *after* reports of abuse of prisoners emerged, even though the US troops regained control after a riot.  The arson was an event that *happened* during the unrest, but the **abuse of prisoners** is what caused the infamy and notoriety.



* **A: Ismein aag laga di gayi thee (It was set on fire):** While true, the arson was an event *during* the infamy, not the *reason* for it.
* **B: Ameriki fojon ney control ley liya thaa (American troops took control):**  Regaining control didn't erase the damage to the jail's reputation.
* **C: Motaddid fasadaat huey thay (Multiple riots occurred):** The riots were part of the situation, but the core issue causing the infamy was the abuse.
* **D: Qaidi ki badsoluki ki daryaaft (Reports of abuse of prisoners):** This directly addresses the reason stated in the text: that the abuse of prisoners led to the jail's bad reputation.



"
Maui key jang key yaadgari Stadium mein kis qism ki taqreeb muaqid honi thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Jadu ka show (Magic show)**.

The question states that a show was scheduled at the War Memorial Stadium, and the band cancelled it. The passage implies it was a show (likely a magic show given the context of bands performing). Therefore, option A is the most logical answer.
"
Taqreeb ki mansukhi key baarey mein kisney aakhir kar wazahat faraham ki thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Band kee intezami company, ech key mangement incorporation.**

The passage states: ""Bands kee intezami company, ech key mangement incorporation, nay koyee ibtadayi wajah nahein batayi jab unhon nay 20 satbar ko mansukh kiya, magar unhon nay aglay din tak mantiqi wajuhaat ko elzaam diyaa.""  This means the band's management company eventually provided the explanation.
"
Bishkek key motaddid bashindagaan key khiyaal mein loot karney ka kon zimmah daar thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Mozahereen (Protesters)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Bashkeek key mutaddid shahriyon nay iss laqanoniyat keliye jonub key muzahireen ko zimmah daar thehraya hay."" This translates to ""Many citizens of Bashkeek held the southern protesters responsible for this lawlessness.""
"
Jonub key mozahereen parr loot karney ka kisney ilzaam lagaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek key bashindagaan (Residents of Bishkek)**.

The text states: ""Bishkek key mutaddid shahriyon nay iss laqanoniyat keliye jonub key muzahireen ko zimmah dar thehraya hay."" which translates to ""Several residents of Bishkek held the southern protesters responsible for this lawlessness.""
"
Ring mein badhi hui kharidon ka tajarbah kabb hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Shark Tank parr zahir honay key baad**.

The text states: ""Seminoff ne kahaa keh uss key 2013 kee Shark Tank waali qist mein zahir honey key baad farokhat mein izafah huwa..."" (Seminoff said that after appearing on his 2013 Shark Tank episode, sales increased...). This directly indicates the increase in sales happened *after* appearing on Shark Tank.
"
Jamie Siminoff ney Ring shurru karney ka kabb faisalah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Apneu darwazah ki ghanti ko nakaafi samajhney key baad** (After considering their doorbells insufficient).

The provided text states: ""Iss say say qabal ring key key darwazay kee ghanti inn kee dukaan say gairege mein nahein sunayi deti thee."" (Before this, the doorbell of Ring was not heard from outside their shop.) This indicates the initial inspiration for Ring came from dissatisfaction with existing doorbell technology.
"
Motaleaah key qose qazah key har episode mein kiss cheez keliye bachon ki sifarishaat ki pesh kash thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Kitabein (Books)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Harr programme unn kitaabon kee sifarish bhee karta hay jinhein bachon ko library mein jaatay waqt talaash karnaa chahie."" (Every program also recommends books that children should look for in the library.)
"
Motaleaah key qose qazah key silsiley ki mansukhi mein kis sey taawun mila hoga?,"The correct answer is **A: Nakaafi fund haasil karnaa (Insufficient funding)**.

The text explicitly mentions that ""funding kaa fuqdan"" (lack of funding) contributed to the series' cancellation. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emmy inamaat ki kami (Lack of Emmy Awards):** The text doesn't mention anything about Emmy awards.
* **C: John Grant ka nazariyah (John Grant's opinion):** John Grant *expressed* a positive opinion about the show, but his opinion didn't prevent its cancellation.
* **D: Janaab Rogers key pados ki kamiyabi (Mr. Rogers' neighborhood's success):** The text states Reading Rainbow was *even less successful* than Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood, implying the opposite of success.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon darakht key baarey mein Amsterdam aur museum keliye afsaraan ney dalil de thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Yeah fungus sey aaludah hay** (It is infected with fungus).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amsterdam shahar aur ainee frank museum key afsaron kaa kehna hay darakht mein phaphund lagnay say sehate aammah kos khatra lahiq ho gayaa hay...""  This translates to ""Officials of Amsterdam city and the Anne Frank Museum say that the presence of fungus on the tree poses a threat to public health...""

Option C, ""Yeah fungus sey aaludah hay"" directly reflects this statement. The passage mentions the fungus as the reason for the threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yeah naguzer tor parr gir jaye gaa** (It is inevitably going to fall) - While the officials suggested the tree was nearing falling, the core reason given was the fungus.
*   **B: Isko mahfooz hona chahiye** (It should be preserved) - This is the opposite of the officials' concerns.
*   **D: Yeah awaami sehat keliye khatrah hay** (It is a threat to public health) - While true, this is a consequence of the fungus, not the specific reason the officials cited. The *reason* for the public health threat is the fungus.



"
"RSPCA key liye eek chief tahqiq kaar key motabiq, tahqiqaat ko darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye meyaari hona chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV camerey**.

The text states that the RSPCA (RSPCA) wants CCTV cameras installed in all abattoirs in Australia. The chief inspector, David Owens, stated that this would signal to those who work with animals that animal welfare is a high priority. Therefore, the inspections would be focused on the CCTV cameras themselves.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Australia key mazbah khanah key molazmeen keliye janwar ki bhalayi ki ahmiyat ko kiya thos bana sakti hay?","The best answer is **A: CCTV camerey ki tansib (Installation of CCTV cameras)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Animal liberation aur royal society for the prevention of cruelty to animals (ARCC) donon tanzimaat nay mutalibah kiya hay ke Australia key tamaam zabiha khaanon mein CCTV camera nasab kiyey jayein."" (Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) both demand that CCTV cameras be installed in all slaughterhouses in Australia.)
* **The reasoning given:** ""CCTV yaqeenan haiwanat key saath kam karnay waale afraad ko yeah signal day gaa ke janwaron kee behbood aala tarjih kee haamil hay."" (CCTV will certainly signal to people who work with animals that the well-being of animals is a high priority.)

The installation of CCTV cameras is the direct action being taken to improve animal welfare. While the other options (meetings, inspections, ABC monitoring) contribute to oversight, the CCTV installation is the core element being highlighted as a direct influence on animal treatment.

Therefore, the installation of CCTV cameras is the most directly linked to the importance of animal welfare for slaughterhouse employees.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Giraftaar shakhs ka peshah kiya hay?","The correct answer is **A: Talib ilm**.

The passage states: ""...molawwis eek aur talib ilm ko 21 march ko giraftar karr lia gayaa hay."" This translates to ""...religious scholars and students (talib ilm) were arrested on March 21st.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jabb deegar giraftaari key baarey mein khabar fail rahi thee, to kitney motassireen ki akhiri rosumaat munaqid ki jaa rahi tee?","The correct answer is **B: Teen**.

The question asks about the number of victims whose final proceedings are being considered, based on the news report. The text clearly states: ""jaif vice aur unn nau mazlumin mein say teenon kee aakhri rosumaat kee adayegi ke waqt..."" which translates to ""...the final proceedings of three of the nine victims will be considered...""
"
"Mozahiron key jawaab mein, konsa mulk apney dastakhat shudah ACTA moahedah key saath aagey nahein badha thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

The text states: ""Pichlay maah poland mein uss waqt bhaari ehtejaj huwa jab uss mulk nay ACTA parr dastakhat kiyey jis say police sarkaar ko sare dast muahidah kee tausiq ko mowajjal karnaa padaa."" This clearly indicates that Poland did not proceed with the ratified ACTA agreement.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa darjah zail mulk ney ACTA mein shaamil honey key marhalah sey ikhtelaaf karney ka faisalah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text states: ""Latvia aur silwakiya donon nay acta mein shomooliyat key amal mein takhir kee hay."" This means Latvia, along with Slovakia, has delayed implementing ACTA, indicating a disagreement or hesitation to fully commit to it.
"
iPod key ziyadah garma honay key hadsaat key natijah mein kitney log zakhmi huey thay?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""...chaar log thoday jalay."" which translates to ""...four people were slightly burned.""
"
Kisney kaha thaa kehh ziyadah garam honey key hadsaat bahut sanjeedah nahein thay?,"The correct answer is **D: Seeb**.

The passage states: ""Pichlay haftay, em ayee tea aayi nay elaan kiya keh apple nay usay overheating yani ziyadah garmi key 34 waaqiaat say aagah kiya thaa, jisay company nay """"gair sanjidah"""" qaraar diyaa."" This means Apple (the company behind iPods) considered the overheating incidents ""not serious.""
"
"Apni taqreer key doraan, Steve Jobs ney kiya kahaa thaa kehh Apple dobarah ijaad karney jaa rahaa hay?","The correct answer is **B: Phone**.

The quote says: """"aaj apple nay phone ko dobarah nawabad kiya hay..."""" which translates to ""today Apple has reinvented the phone..."" 

Therefore, Steve Jobs said Apple was reinventing the **phone**.
"
Steve Jobs ki do ghantah ki taqreer ka maqsad kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek naya phone launch karnaa (Launching a new phone)**.

The text states:

* ""Apple key CEO Steve Jobs nay stage parr chalte hoay aur apni jins kee jeb say iPhone baahar nikalte hoay device say pardah uthaya."" (Apple's CEO Steve Jobs walked on stage and unveiled the device by taking the iPhone out of his pocket.)
* ""Apni 2 ghantay kee taqrir key doraan unhon nay kahaa, """"aaj apple nay phone ko dobarah nawabad kiya hay, aaj ham eek tareekh raqam karnay jaa rahay hain-"""" (""During his 2-hour speech, he said, ""Today Apple has reinvented the phone, today we are going to set a new standard."")

This clearly indicates he was launching a new iPhone.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ney Argentinaa key cenima hall mein kiya elaan kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Apni sadarti ummidwari (Her presidential candidacy)**.

The text states: ""Mrs Kirchner nay sadarat key liye khadi honey kaa elaan argentine theater say kiya tha."" which translates to ""Mrs Kirchner announced her candidacy for the presidency from the Argentine theater.""
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner ney ladney key paney iraadah ka kahaan elaan kiyaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: La Plata sey 31 meel door eek theatre mein**.

The text clearly states: ""Mrs Kirchner nay sadarat key liye khadi honey kaa elaan Argentina theater say kiya. yeah wohee maqaam thaa jahan say uss nay beunos ires subah key deligation key rukn kee haisiyat say 2005 mein senate key liye apni muhim kaa aaghaz kiya thaa.""  This means she announced her presidential candidacy at a theater *in* La Plata, which is 31 miles from Buenos Aires.
"
Baday bhai key hawaley sey ACMA ki taqiqaat kiya theen?,"The correct answer is **A: Censorship key qanoon ki khelaaf warzi nahein ki gayi thee**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""big brother nay online mashmulat kee censorship key qawanin kee khelaaf warzi nahein kee thee...""  This directly translates to ""Big Brother did not violate the censorship laws of online content...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Media ko baday bhai ki website parr zakhirah kardah paya gaya thaa** (The media was found stored on Big Brother's website) - The passage states the media file wasn't stored on Big Brother's website.
* **C: Censorship key qanoon ki khelaaf warzi ki gayi thee** (Censorship laws were violated) - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **D: Mashmool ko jimsaani tor parr server parr sokunat karta hua paya gaya thaa** (The content was found residing physically on a server) - The passage states that for content to be counted for monitoring purposes, it needed to be physically on a server, but the media file wasn't on Big Brother's server.



"
Internet ka mashmool samjh jaaney key liye media ko kinn parameters key taht hona chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Isko jismani tor parr server parr rehaayesh pazeer honaa zaruri hay.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Internet key mashmulat shumaar kiye jaaney key liye usay jismani tor say kisee server parr honaa chahiye.""  This translates to: ""For internet content to be counted, it must physically reside on a server.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isko internet parr stream hona lazmi hay:** The passage doesn't say content *must* stream. It just says it needs to *be* on a server.
* **C: Isey kisi website parr zakhirah nahein kiya ja sakta:**  The passage explicitly states the content wasn't stored on ""Big Brother's website"" but doesn't say it can't be stored on *any* website.  The key issue is physical presence on a server.
* **D: Isy ICMA ki jaanib sey manzoori milnaa zaruri hay:** The passage refers to the ""Nashriyati Khidmaat Act"" (Publishing Services Act), which implies regulatory approval, but doesn't specifically mention ""ICMA"" (which I assume is a typo or abbreviation). The core requirement is physical presence on a server, not necessarily approval.



"
Australia ki Liberal Party ka leader kon hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text states: ""Australiyayi khazanchi peeter coustilo ko liberal party key rahnuma key tor parr..."" which translates to ""Australian treasurer Peter Costello as the leader of the Liberal Party...""
"
Australia key paas pahley sey eek nuclear power sanaat keon nahein hay?,"The answer is **B: Bahut ziyadah motanazaa (Very high controversy)**.

The text implies that there have been significant debates and disagreements surrounding nuclear power in Australia. Peter Costello's statement about supporting the nuclear power industry suggests it hasn't been a priority, hinting at underlying complexities and opposition. The text *doesn't* mention lack of public support, danger, or cost as the primary reason. It focuses on the fact that the industry is being discussed *now*, implying a history of debate.



"
Kis skier ney eek rahnuma ki madad sey moqabilah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

The text states: ""Poland key basri mazuri waale scare missiage kareezal aur guide ainaa **ogaranksa** nay super ji mein teerhawein position parr khatam kee.""  This translates to: ""Poland's visually impaired skier, guide Anna Ogarzynska and athlete Maciej Krezel finished in thirteenth position in the Super-G.""

Therefore, Anna Ogarzynska is the skier who competed with a guide.
"
Kiss mulk ney khawateen key khada honey key darjah key liye Super-G mein daswaan mokammal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.

The text states: ""Netherlands ko kul super jee mein womens standing cliss mein nawwaan maqaam haasil karnay waale ainaa jakamsan aur usee muqabilah mein daswaan maqaam haasil karnay waali finland kee katja sarinan key saath shaamil kiya."" which translates to ""Netherlands included Ainoa Jakimainen who achieved the 9th position in the women's standing class in the overall Super-G and Katja Sarinen of Finland who achieved the 10th position in the same competition.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Balke key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Usney hamlah ka eteraaf kar liya thaa (He confessed to the attack)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the defendant **denied** the attack (""uss nay uss hamlay kee tardid kee""). Option B directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Wohh manzar parr giraftaar kar liya gaya thaa (He was arrested at the scene):**  The text says ""jisay jaye waquah say giraftar kiya gayaa thaa"" which means ""who was arrested at the scene of the incident.""
* **C: Hamlah key doraan usney eek pole ka istemaal kiya thaa (He used a pole during the attack):** The text states ""yeah daawa kiya keh uss nay pool kaa istemaal tees afraad kee taraf say uss kee taraf phainki jaa rahee botalon say khud ko bachanay key liye kiya tha"" which translates to ""He claimed that he used the pole to protect himself from bottles thrown at him by about thirty people.""
* **D: Uska dawaa thaa kehh uskey ooper botalein fenki gayi theen (His claim was that bottles were thrown at him):** The text clearly says ""yeah daawa kiya keh uss nay pool kaa istemaal tees afraad kee taraf say uss kee taraf phainki jaa rahee botalon say khud ko bachanay key liye kiya tha"" which translates to ""He claimed that he used the pole to protect himself from bottles thrown at him by about thirty people.""



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kiya Blake key saath waqea nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Uss parr eek pole sey hamlah hua thaa (He was attacked with a pole).**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Pesh karnay waala, jisay jaye waquah say giraftar kiya gayaa thaa, uss nay uss hamlay kee tardid kee..."" which translates to ""The person who was arrested in connection with the incident denied the attack..."" This means the attack with a pole is being *denied* by Blake.
* **The other options are confirmed in the text:**
    * **B: Usey giraftaar kar liya gaya (He was arrested):** ""jisay jaye waquah say giraftar kiya gayaa thaa"" - ""who was arrested in connection with the incident""
    * **A: Wohh insaaf key bigaad key liye mujrim paya gaya thaa (He was found guilty of obstructing justice):**  ""...Black (blake) parr nizaame insaaf ko gumrah karnay kee koshish kaa bhee elzaam thaa."" - ""Black was also accused of attempting to obstruct the administration of justice.""
    * **D: Usko bata diya gaya thaa kehh usey jail bhejey jaaney ka imkaan hay (He was told that he might be sent to jail):** ""Judge nay black ko bataya keh usay jail bhejay jaaney kaa faislah """"taqriban naguzir"""" ho gayaa thaa."" - ""The Judge told Black that the decision to send him to jail had become """"almost inevitable"""".""



Therefore, the only event that Blake denied happening was being attacked with a pole.



"
U.N. ka aalami tapish ka fund kiskey liye istemaal nahein hogaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Faslon mein tanawwo karnaa (Crop diversification)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that funds will be used for:

* Flood-proof housing (flood proof makanaat)
* Improved water systems (aab rasaani key behatar nizam)
* Crop intensification (faslon kee tanviee)

Therefore, crop diversification (tanawwo karnaa) is listed as something the fund *will* be used for, making option A the incorrect answer. The other options (B, C, and D) are all listed as potential uses of the fund.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, U.N. ko keya mahfooz karney ki ummid hay?","The correct answer is **A: Paisah, Taknik key ishteraak key zariyah**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Aqwam Muttahedah bhee ummid karta hay global warming say mutissirah momalik kee madad key liye eek fund ko hatmi shakal dena chahiye taakeh woh momalik uss key asraat say nimat sakein."" This implies the UN expects to provide *funds* for aid.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""...technologies kaa ishteraak karnay...""  This indicates the UN intends to facilitate the *sharing of technologies*.
* **The passage further details:** ""Yeah roqoom flood proof makanaat, aab rasaani key behatar nizam, aur faslon kee tanviee parr sarf kee jaye gee."" This highlights how the funds and technologies will be *spent* on these areas.

Therefore, the UN's primary focus, according to the passage, is on providing financial aid and facilitating technology sharing. Options B, C, and D are specific *applications* of the aid, not what the UN is primarily *expecting* to provide.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Albert Muchanga ney kisi aisi cheez key tor parr hawalah nahein diya thaa jiss parr abb bhi ittefaaq karney ki zarurat hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Tariff ki reaayatein (Tariff concessions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ham abhi tak asl qanoon aur mahsulaat kee **moraat parr muttafiq nahein hoay hain**"" which translates to ""we are not yet agreed on the **details/rules** of the laws and products."" While ""moraat"" (details/rules) can encompass tariffs, the context points to broader legal and product standards. The passage explicitly mentions *not* being agreed on the ""asl qanoon aur mahsulaat kee moraat"" which are the details/rules of laws and products.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aya Benin AfCTA mein shaamil hogaa (Benin will join AfCTA):** The passage explicitly mentions Benin's inclusion.
* **B: Jis tarikh ko tejaarat shuru ho sakti hay (The date when trade can start):**  The passage states trade can start from July 1, 2020, *based on the existing framework*.
* **C: Asal qanoon (Asal qanoon - The laws):** The passage specifically says they haven't agreed on the ""asl qanoon"" (the laws themselves).



Therefore, tariff concessions are the item that the passage explicitly states they *haven't* reached agreement on.
"
Ebarat key hisaab sey tejarat July mein keon shuru ho sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Maqaam mein qawayed aur reaayaton ka kaafi framework hota hay.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""ham abhi tak asl qanoon aur mahsulaat kee moraat parr muttafiq nahein hoay hain, lekin jo bunyaadi dhancha hamare paas mojud hay woh 1 july 2020 say tejarat shuroo karnay keliye kaafi hay.""
* This directly translates to: ""We are not yet agreed on the actual laws and product tariffs, but the basic framework we have is enough to start trade from July 1, 2020.""

Therefore, trade can start on July 1st because a sufficient *framework of rules and tariffs* is already in place, even though details are still being finalized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: July ki tarikhe aaghaz AfCFTA mein shaamil honey key liye Nigeria ki sharayet ka eek hissah hay:** While Nigeria's inclusion is a factor, the date is specifically tied to the *framework* allowing trade.
* **C: Isko AU key tejarat aur sanaati commissioner ney thik qaraar diya thaa:** The commissioner's approval is important, but the justification for the July 1st date is the existing framework, not just their opinion.
* **D: Asal qawayed aur tariff ki reaayaton parr ittefaaq kiya gaya hay:** The passage explicitly says they *haven't* agreed on the actual laws and tariffs.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Atlanta Journal-ka dastur taleemi afsaraan parr kis cheez ka ilzaam lagay thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Suraagh shudah andruni masail key tor parr kaam na karna** (Failing to address the identified internal issues).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution's report highlighted ""unusually large increases in test scores"" and accused the school system of being aware of problems but failing to take action on them. This directly points to the accusation of not addressing internal issues that were already known.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Journal-dastur ki report key saath ched chaad karnaa** (Manipulating the report with loopholes): While test score manipulation is a central theme, the question asks what the *report* accused the educational officials of doing. The report accused them of failing to act.
*   **B: Shahri taleem ki ikhteraa karney mein nakaam hona** (Failing to innovate in urban education): This isn't the main accusation. The report focuses on addressing existing problems, not innovating.
*   **D: Kam jaanch key score ki report karnaa** (Reporting low test scores): The report actually highlighted *high* and unusually large increases in scores, not low scores.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the accusation made by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in the passage.
"
"Ebarat mein di gayi maalumaat ki buniyaad parr, Atlanta Journal-key dastur ki report mein kiya mazkoor nahein thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Gair mamuli jaanch key score ki behtari (Unusual increase in test scores)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on **unusual increases** in test scores. The question asks what was *not* mentioned.
*   The passage explicitly mentions that the report exposed unusual increases in test scores.
*   The passage *does* mention that the report revealed test papers had been tampered with (""tehreef kee thi"").
*   The passage mentions that the individual in question won ""National Superintendent of the Year"" in 2009 and that the scores improved.
*   The passage mentions the individual's innovative approaches to city education.

Therefore, the report did mention the unusual increase in test scores, making option A the correct answer."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bab baari key baad kiya malumaat mashhoor thee?","The correct answer is **A: Akhiri zakhm ka shumaar (Final number of injuries)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""sarkari report nay 30 key zakhmi honey kee tasdiq kee hay; lekin hatmi aadaad wo shumaar kaa abhi tak ilm nahein huwa hay"" which translates to ""the government report confirmed 30 injuries; but the final number is not yet known.""

This indicates that the final number of injuries was *not* known at the time the report was written. Therefore, it was information that *was* mentioned but not yet established.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: KInn imaaraton key paas bam phatey thay (Which buildings the bombs exploded near):** The passage mentions ""sarkari emaraton key qareeb"" (near government buildings) but doesn't specify which buildings.
*   **C: Aya ezaafi bam shaamil honay thay (If there were additional bombs involved):** The passage mentions ""teen bom dhamakay"" (three bomb explosions) but doesn't indicate if there were more.
*   **D: Maut ki sarkaari tadaad (Government death toll):** The passage mentions ""Kuchh reports mein sarkari amwaat kee sharah aath batayi gayee hay"" (Some reports stated the number of deaths as eight), but this is from *reports*, not the confirmed *government* toll. The passage doesn't confirm the official government death toll.



"
"2017 mein Manchester shahar sey judney key baad sey, Jesus ney kitney match kheley thay?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: ""Uss waqt say, yeah brazili khiladi tamaam muqabilon mein club keliye **53 match khel chukay hain** aur inhon nay 24 goal bhee kiye hain."" (Since then, this Brazilian player has played **53 matches for the club** and has also scored 24 goals.)
"
Kiss club sey judney key liye Jesus ney £27 million fees wosul ki thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text states: ""P: 21 salah eisaa brazili club palmyras say..."" which translates to ""P: 21 Salah Eisaa from Brazilian club Palmeiras..."".  The question asks which club Jesus joined for £27 million. The passage explicitly mentions Palmeiras.
"
Hostel key mehmaanon key liye konsa bayaan sahi nahein hay?,"The incorrect statement about the hostel guests is **D: Aksar mehmaan moqaddas shahar sey thay (Most guests were from the holy city).**

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: **""Hostel key mehmanon mein ziyadah tar muttahedah arab emaraat key shahri shaamil they""** (Most of the hostel guests were from the city of the United Arab Emirates).

Therefore, the majority of guests were *not* from the holy city of Makkah itself, but rather from the UAE.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Mehmaan hajj key liye Makkah mein thay (Guests were in Makkah for Hajj):** The text explicitly mentions ""Hajj kee ziyarat key moqaa parr"" (on the occasion of Hajj pilgrimage).
* **B: Kuchh mehmaan maqami shahri nahein thay (Some guests were not local citizens):**  The fact that most were from the UAE implies that some were not local.
* **C: Hajj sey pahli raat tak mehmaan mojud thay (Guests were present until the first night of Hajj):** While not explicitly stated, it is reasonable to assume guests were present for at least the initial phase of Hajj.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahi hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tamaam mehmaan muttahedah arab imaraat sey thay (All guests were from the United Arab Emirates).**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Hostel key mehmanon mein ziyadah tar muttahedah arab emaraat key shahri shaamil they"" (The majority of the hostel guests were from the United Arab Emirates). While it doesn't say *all*, it's the closest to being completely true among the options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Koyi halakatein nahein hui theen (No fatalities occurred):** The text clearly states ""Wafiyaat kee taadad kam az kam 15 hay"" (The number of fatalities is at least 15).
* **C: Hajj ki ziyarat ki pahli raat tak mehmaan mojud thay (The guests were present until the first night of Hajj pilgrimage):** The text doesn't mention how long the guests were staying.
* **D: Aksar mehmaan Makkah key maqami thay (Most guests were locals of Makkah):** The text indicates the majority were from the UAE, not locals of Makkah.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, tasaadum key baarey mein konsi malumaat yaqini nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Zameen parr tasaadum ka asar (The impact of the collision on the ground)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that scientists are *still trying to determine* the severity of the collision and its impact on the ground.** This indicates uncertainty.
* **The passage provides estimates for the speed of the objects and their altitude.** These are given as scientific observations.
* **The passage mentions the location of the collision as ""491 miles up in the sky.""** This is a specific location mentioned.
* **The passage mentions the US Strategic Command is searching for data.** This implies they are trying to find information, but it doesn't mean the data is confirmed or certain.

Therefore, the impact on the ground is the only piece of information the passage explicitly states is still unknown.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tasadum key baarey mein kis cheez ko motayyan hona zaruri hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tasadum key waqt satellites kitni tezi sey safar kar rahi theen (How fast were the satellites traveling at the time of the collision)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the satellites were traveling at approximately 17,500 miles per hour.  Understanding the speed is crucial for scientists to determine the force of the impact (""yeah takkar kitni tez thee"" - how fast the collision was). The other options are related but less immediately essential for understanding the core of the collision itself.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Khandaraat ki suraagh rasani ko kaun sanbhale gaa (Who will handle the damage assessment?)**  While important, this is a consequence of the collision, not a direct element needed to understand the collision's initial dynamics.
* **C: Kaisy saazish key tajziyaati natayej ka ishteraak kiya jaaye gaa (How will the analysis results be shared?)** This is about data dissemination, not the collision itself.
* **D: Takkar ka durust paimanah (The correct scale of the collision)**  The ""correct scale"" will be determined by factors *including* the speed (B) and force of the impact, but speed is a fundamental piece of information.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Batten ney maldaar tareen amerikiyon ki fihrist mein kabhi konsey maqaam ka haamil thaa?","The correct answer is **C: 190vein**.

The passage states: ""Beaton 2008 key 400 ameer tareen amerikiyon kee fehrist mein 190 number parr thaa..."" which translates to ""Beaton 2008 was ranked 190th in the list of 400 richest Americans...""
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko Batten ney atiyah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Virginia ki University**.

The text states: ""Woh 1950 mein university of verjiniya key college of arts and sciences say faarig huwa aur uss idaarah key mamtaz atiyah dehindgan mein say eek thaa.""  This translates to: ""He graduated from the University of Virginia's College of Arts and Sciences in 1950 and was one of its distinguished alumni.""
"
Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger ki dastakhat shudah bill ka kiya cheez hissah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: California key baahar nabalighon ko pur tashaddud video games ki frokht yaa kerayah parr pabandi**

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states the bill applies *within* California.** It mentions a ""18+"" rating label for games *sold in California* and a fine for selling them there. 
* **Options A and B are correct:** The bill *does* address a ban (or at least regulation) of violent game sales to children within California and includes a financial penalty.
* **Option D is correct:** The bill *does* require violent games to have an ""18+"" rating label.

Therefore, the only thing the bill *doesn't* cover is the sale or rental of violent video games to minors *outside* of California.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss sey kahi janey waali batein choot gayi theen","The correct answer is **B: Mike**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""...main tayyaar ho rahaa thaa, iss liye main waaqaee nahein sun paya keh woh kiya kah rahaa thaa."" (I was preparing, that's why I couldn't really hear what he was saying.)  ""Woh"" refers back to Mike, as the sentence is about Miller not being able to hear what *Mike* was saying during the seizure.

Therefore, the information Miller missed was what **Mike** was saying.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sunaney parr Miller key tajarbah key baarey mein darjah zail mein sey kiya sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Duvall ki kahani parr wohh gahri tawajjoh dey rahey thay** (Miller was paying deep attention to Duvall's story).

Here's why:

The passage states that Miller was *preparing* for something and therefore couldn't fully listen to Duvall.  He admits to not hearing what Duvall was saying during the ""samat"" (likely a trance or speaking in tongues).  Therefore, it's the opposite of paying deep attention.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible based on the text:

* **A: Sunaney key doraan Miller parr Duvall ney tassur dala thaa** (During listening, Duvall had an impression on Miller) - The passage doesn't explicitly state Duvall had an impression on Miller. It focuses on Miller's difficulty in listening. However, it's a possible inference given the context of a religious experience.
* **B: Tayyar hotey waqt woh tawajjoh nahein dey rahaa thaa** (He wasn't paying attention while preparing) - This is directly stated in the passage: ""Main tayyaar ho rahaa thaa, iss liye main waaqaee nahein sun paya keh woh kiya kah rahaa thaa."" (I was preparing, that's why I really couldn't hear what he was saying.)
* **C: Snaney key waqt Duvall key do bachon ney bahut baat ki thee** (During listening, Duvall's two children talked a lot) - The passage mentions Duvall speaking a lot (""mic bahut ziyadah baat karta hay""). It doesn't say his children were talking.

Therefore, only option D is definitively *not* supported by the text.



"
Kisney tajweez di thee kehh ‘Saaf Hawa ka Qanoon’ mein nazre saaniyaan karni hongi?,"The correct answer is **A: John Howard**.

The passage states: ""Wazir aazam stephan harper apnay P M O daftar mein N D P key leader jack leaton key saath mangal key roz honey waali 25 minut kee mulaqat key baad hukumat key 'clean year act' ko doosri reading say pehle eek all party committy key paas nazar saani key liye bhejnay parr razamand hogay hain.""  This indicates that the decision to send the Clean Air Act for a second reading through an all-party committee was made *after* the meeting with Jack Layton and Stephen Harper. 

Furthermore, the passage mentions that Prime Minister John Howard defended the decision to cover hospital costs, stating it was to protect hospital facilities from cuts by the Tasmanian government. This implies John Howard was involved in the decision-making process around the Clean Air Act's future.

Therefore, while the meeting occurred, the decision to send the Act for a second reading is linked to John Howard's actions and statements.
"
Kisney iss baat sey inkaar kiya thaa kehh ‘Saaf Hawa ka Qanoon’ ka istemaal election sey pahley ki baazi key tor parr kiya jaa raha thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek wazeere aazam**.

The text states: ""Jab say federal government nay dune port, tismania, key mercy hospital key masarif uthanay kaa qadm uthaya riyasati hukumat aur baaz federal arkaane parliman nay usay aaindah november mein honey waale federal election kaa shakhsana qaraar day karr uss qadm kee tanqeed kee. Magar wazire aazam john howard nay kahaa hay keh yeah amal sirf hospital kee sahulaton kee hifazat key liye thaa keh unhein tasmanvi hukumat kee jaanib say tanazzuli se bachaya jasakay...""

This indicates that Premier John Howard (a wazire aazam) denied that the ""Clean Air Bill"" was being used as a pre-election tactic.
"
Morakkabaat cyanuric acid aur melamine uss waqt kiya tashkil diya thaa jabb unhoney billi key peshaab mein eek deegar key saath radde amal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Gurdey (Kidneys)**.

The passage states that the compounds (sianuric acid and melamine) form crystals together that can **block kidney function**. The question asks *when* these crystals were formed, and the context indicates it happened in the cat's urine.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Paltu janwar ka khana (Pet food)**: While the pet food may have contained the compounds, the crystals formed *in the pet's body*, specifically the kidneys.
*   **C: Billor (Cats)**: Cats were affected, but the crystals formed within their kidneys.
*   **D: Infrared spectroscopy**: This is a *method* used to identify the crystals, not the location where they formed.



"
Tahqiq kaaron ney infrared spectroscopy ka istemaal kiss cheez ka moshahedah karney key liye kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Paltu janwar key peshaab mein billori morakkab (Crystalline compound)`.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Jab infrared spectroascopy (FTIR) key zariah mowaznah kiya gayaa to unn cristal morakkabaat kaa mail mutissirah paltu janwaron key peshaab mein payee gayee cheez say huwa."" This translates to: ""When infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) was used to compare, the crystals formed by these compounds were found in the urine of affected pets.""

The study was comparing the crystalline compounds found in the urine of affected pets with other substances. FTIR is a technique used to identify the chemical composition of a substance, and in this case, it was used to identify the crystalline compounds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gurdah key amal (Kidney function):** While the crystalline compounds *affect* kidney function, the FTIR was used to *identify* the compounds themselves, not to directly assess kidney function.
*   **C: Motassirah paltu janwar (Affected pet):** The FTIR was used to compare the urine of affected pets with other substances, not to analyze the pet itself.
*   **D: Paltu janwar ka aaludah khana (Contaminated pet food):** The study identified the compounds found in the urine, but the FTIR wasn't directly used to analyze the pet food.



"
Kisney Luna ko “Intehaa pasand ki malekah” kaha thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The passage states: ""Tommy Dreamer ne kaha hay keh, lona extreme kee pehli raani. meeri pehli manager thee."" This translates to: ""Tommy Dreamer said that Luna was the first queen of Extreme. She was my first manager."" The phrase ""pehli raani"" (first queen) is similar in meaning to ""Intehaa pasand ki malekah"" (queen of extreme/very beloved queen).
"
Kisney Luna ko “Ajeeb” kaha thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Raneels ne tabsarah kartay hoay kahaa keh """"Luna meri tarah shoqeen thee...shayed mujh say bhee ziyadah..unn say badaa lagao thaa aur unn kee bahut yaad aayey gee...ummid hay keh woh behtar jagah parr hogi."""" Dustin Runnels is identified as ""Raneels"" in this context, and he's the one who says Luna was as passionate about wrestling as he was, perhaps even more so. The question asks who called Luna ""Ajeeb"" (which translates to ""weird"" or ""strange""), and while the text doesn't explicitly use that word, Dustin Runnels' description of her as ""shoqeen"" (passionate/enthusiastic) and ""badaa lagao thaa"" (greater than me) implies a certain uniqueness, which could be interpreted as being ""ajeeb"" in a positive, admiring way. The other options are incorrect.
"
Takkar mein shaamil driver key saath kiya nahein hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ghar key andar key kisi log ko usney zakhmi nahein kiya thaa** (He did not injure anyone inside the house).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Agarcha teen afraad ghar key andar they jab kaar uss say takrayi lekin koyee bhee zakhmi nahein huwa."" (Although three people were inside the house when the car collided with them, no one was injured.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uskey sar parr chotein aayein theen** (He had bruises on his head): The passage says the driver had a *deep* head injury (""sarr mein gehri chot aayi hay""), not just bruises.
* **C: Usey Cambridge key haspataal sey Great Yarmouth key eek haspataal mien muntaqil kiya gaya thaa** (He was transferred from Cambridge hospital to a hospital in Great Yarmouth): The passage says he was transferred from Great Yarmouth to Cambridge.
* **D: Fauri khidmaat ney usko uski gaadi sey hataney mein madad kiya** (Emergency services helped him out of his car): The passage states that emergency services helped *remove the driver from the car*. While getting him out of the car is related, it doesn't specifically address what happened *to* him in the car.



"
Rugby tournament key doraan jonubi Africa key gameplay key baarey mein khadi kiya cheez nahein thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Motassir kun ijtemaai kaam (Influential social work)**.

Here's why:

The text focuses on:

* **The weather:** ""Shandar mausam aur subah key waqt thodi der keliye hoyee bonda bandy..."" (Excellent weather and a slight delay in the morning...)
* **The match details:** ""7' kee ragbi keliye behtareen din thaa"" (It was a perfect day for 7's rugby)
* **South Africa's performance:** Their initial weakness, improving performance, organized defense, ball handling skills, teamwork, and eventual confidence.

The options B, C, and D are all directly mentioned in the text as aspects of South Africa's gameplay:

* **B: Gend sanbhalney ki salahiyat (Ball handling skills)** - Explicitly mentioned.
* **C: Tournament key aaghaz mein eek polish kardah kaar kardagi (Polished performance at the start of the tournament)** -  The text says they *looked* weak at the start.
* **D: Defaayi maharatein (Defensive skills)** - Explicitly mentioned.

""Motassir kun ijtemaai kaam"" (Influential social work) is completely irrelevant to the rugby match and not mentioned in the text. Therefore, it's the correct answer.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, jonugbi Africa ka game kabb behtar hona shuru hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Jaisaa kehh tournament chalta gaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jaise jaise tournament aagay badhta gayaa karkardagi behtar hoti chalee gayee"" which translates to ""as the tournament progressed, their performance got better"". This indicates that South Africa's performance improved gradually throughout the tournament, not at a specific moment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Subah 10:00 bajey key aas paas:** This refers to the start of the first match, not when their performance improved.
*   **B: Defaa key sakht honay key baad:** While a strong defense contributed, the improvement wasn't solely due to defense. The passage mentions ball handling and teamwork too.
*   **C: Zambia sey haarney key baad:** They won against Zambia, so it couldn't be after losing.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa darjah zail bayaniyah Cheen ki maeeshat ki durust tor parr akkaasi nahein karta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Cheen ney Jarmani key moqabley kabhi bhi ziyadah car baramad nahein ki hay**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Pehli baar cheen nay pichlay saal germani say ziyadah carein export keen..."" This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Islahaat karney key baad sey cheen ki maeeshat tezi sey badhi hay:**  The passage says, ""Uss key baad say cheen kaa iqtesadi hajm 90 gunaa ziyadah badh chukaa hay.""
* **B: Cheen key paas Amerika ki banisbat car baramadgi ki ziyadah badi market hay:** The passage says, ""Pehli baar cheen nay pichlay saal germani say ziyadah carein export keen..."" implying a significant car export market. The passage also states that China has surpassed America in car manufacturing.
* **C: Cheen key paas akhir kaar Amerika ki banisbat ziyadah badi GDP ho sakti hay:** The passage concludes, ""Agli do dahayiyon mein america key muqabilay mein cheen kee gdp mean bahut ziyadah izafah ho sakta hay.""



Therefore, option D is the only statement that is factually incorrect according to the passage.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Cheen ki GDP Amerika ko kab obur kar sakti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Do dahayion mein**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Agli do dahayiyon mein america key muqabilay mein cheen kee gdp mean bahut ziyadah izafah ho sakta hay."" (In the next two decades, China's GDP could increase significantly compared to America.)

While options A and C are mentioned as factors contributing to China's economic growth, the passage directly points to the next two decades as a timeframe for a significant increase in GDP. Option D (three decades) is not supported by the text."
Hu ney taraqqi pazeer mulkon ko kiya karney ki tajweez dee thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Aaludgi key puraney raaston sey bachein (Avoid the old paths of pollution)**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""How nay taraqqi pazeer momalik kee yeah kehtay hoay hauslah afzayi kee keh, """"pehle aaludgi phailao aur baad mein safayi kro key rujhaan say ehteraz karein."""""" This directly translates to ""How encouraged developed countries by saying, 'First spread pollution and then clean it up, and avoid it by preference.'""  Therefore, the implied advice is to *avoid* the old, polluting ways.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unn zimmah daariyon ko nibhayein jo unki taraqqi key marhalah ka moharrik ho (Fulfill the responsibilities that drive their development stage):** This is the opposite of what How was suggesting.
* **B: Maashi natijah parr tawajjoh dein (Pay attention to economic results):** While mentioned, it's not the core of the advice given to developed countries.
* **C: Apni mojudah zimmah daariyon key pichey bhaagein (Run away from their current responsibilities):** Again, this is the opposite of the advice How was giving.



"
Hu ney kiss cheez ka zikr nahein kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon key ikhraaj ki katautiyon ka eek aadado shumaar (A specific number for carbon emission reductions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Unhon nay katoti keliye koyee aadaad wo shumaar pesh nahein kiya..."" which translates to ""He did not present any figure or number for the reduction."" This directly points to the lack of a specific number.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Katautiyon ki buniyaad (The basis of the reductions):**  The passage says he would work on China's economic results as the basis.
* **B: Aaludgi key motalliq taraqqi pazeer mulkon ko mashwarah dein (Give advice to developed countries regarding pollution):** The passage explicitly mentions this.
* **C: Jiss tarikh tak carbon key ikhrajaat ki ummid hay kehh katauti ho jaye gee (The date by which carbon emissions are expected to be reduced):** The passage says he didn't mention a *date*.

Therefore, the only thing Hu did *not* mention was a specific numerical target for carbon emission reductions.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye Veerman ney kaha thaa kehh haalat achhi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

The text states: ""Medicines sawn frontier key tarjuman richard virman nay kahaa: """"angolah bemari key apnay sab say badtareen phailao kee taraf gamzan hay aur **angolah mein suratehaal bahut kharab hay**""""""

This translates to: ""Richard Virman, translator for Medicines Sans Frontieres, said: """"Angola is heading towards the worst spread of the angola disease and the **situation in Angola is very bad**""""""

Therefore, Virman said the situation was bad *in Angola*.
"
"Moqaddamah chalney ki wajah sey, Huhne ki kabinah ka uhdah kon legaa?","The correct answer is **C: Lamb**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tawaqqo kee jaarahi hay keh rukn parliament norman lamb wazir tejarat hongay kiyon ke devi wazaarat chhod rahaa hay."" This translates to ""There is speculation that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will be the Minister of Trade because Ms. Devi is leaving the ministry.""

Therefore, Norman Lamb is expected to take over the role of Minister of Trade."
Moqaddamah key baad tejarati wazeer key kirdaar ko kaun sanbhaley gaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tawaqqu kee jaarahi hay keh rukn parliament norman lamb wazir tejarat hongay kiyon ke devi wazaarat chhod rahaa hay."" This translates to ""There is speculation that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will be the Minister of Trade because Devi is leaving the ministry.""
"
Kaar kardagi karney waley nazreen ki Camille Saint-Saens key opera key doraan kiya karney key liye hausalah afzaayi kartey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaar kardagi keliye stage parr unsey judnaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Natijah key tor parr adakaron nay mushtarkah tor par stage par hashish pie, aur theater bazaat khud saameyin ko uss mein shareek honay kee hauslah afzayi kartay nazar aaya.""  This translates to: ""As a result, the actors collectively performed on stage, and the theater itself seemed to encourage the audience to participate in it.""

The question asks what the actors encouraged the audience to do.  The text directly states they encouraged participation *on stage*.
"
Opera key doraan buniyadi tor parr kon mushtarekah smoking karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Fankaar (Artists)**.

The text states: ""Natijah key tor parr adakaron nay mushtarkah tor par hashish pie..."" which translates to ""As a result, the actors collectively smoked hashish...""  Therefore, the artists (fankaar) were the ones smoking.
"
Leonov key anjaam deney waaley “waqfah chalan” key liye eek deegar naam kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Gair qanooni sargarmi** (which translates to ""unauthorized activity"" or, more accurately in this context, ""spacewalk"").

The text states: ""18 march, 1965 ko, uss nay khalayi jehaaz say baahar sarf baarah minut say kuchh ziyad tak tanha rah karr, pehli baar khalayi jehaaz say baahar aaney kee insani srgarmi (aiwa), yaa """"**khalaa mein chalna**"""" anjaam di.""

The text then explains that ""khalaa mein chalna"" is the Russian term for a spacewalk. While the other options are related to space exploration, they aren't the specific name for the activity described. Apollo-Soyuz mission is a later joint mission, the Space Race is the broader competition, and Cosmonaut No. 11 is the name of the person who performed the spacewalk. 

Therefore, the answer is **C**.  While ""Gair qanooni sargarmi"" isn't a standard term, the text uses ""khalaa mein chalna"" and then clarifies it as the first human spacewalk. Thus, ""Gair qanooni sargarmi"" is the closest available option that captures the idea of a significant, groundbreaking, and somewhat unconventional human activity in space.



"
Leonov ney Soviet key kiss mission key hissah ki qeadat ki thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Das saal baad, unhon nay apolo-swewz mission key soviet hissay kee qeyadat kee jo iss baat kee alaamat hay ke khalayi muqabilah khatam ho chukaa hay."" (Ten years later, he commanded the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which is a sign that the space race was over.)
"
Takkar mein kon zakhmi hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The passage states: ""Haadsah honey key baad, gibson ko eek hospital tak pahunchaya gayaa magar woh kuch der baad hee margaya."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to a hospital but died a little while later.) This directly indicates that Gibson was injured and died as a result of the accident.
"
Haadsah mein shaamil logon key saath kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek zakhmi hua tha, eek mar gaya tha**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Gibson, the truck driver, died.
* It also mentions children were present who were crying and running away, implying they were likely frightened but not physically injured (though the text doesn't explicitly say they were injured). 

Therefore, one person died (Gibson), and the children were affected by the accident. Option B best reflects the situation. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh dono mar gaye thay** - Incorrect because only Gibson died.
* **C: Wohh cheenkh aur chilla rahey thay** - This describes the children's reaction, not the status of the people involved in the accident.
* **D: Dono zakhmi huey thay** - Incorrect because Gibson died.



"
Progaram parr kaam kar rahey saensadaan darjah zail mein sey kiskey sabab honay waley asaraat ka moshahedah kaney ki ummid kar rahey thay?,"The correct answer is **C: Chotey zarraat (Small particles)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Science daan iss natijah parr pahunch paaye thay keh dark meter dosray dark meter parr usee tarah asar andaaz hotay hain jis tarah aam meter daaltay hain. Uss nazariye key mutabiq kahkushan key ird gird mojud ziyadah tar seeyah maaddah eek haalay kee shakal mein kahkushan key ird gird mojud hay, aur yeah bahut say chhote zarraat parr mushtamil hay.""

This translates to: ""Scientists had reached the conclusion that the dark matter surrounding the galaxy is mostly in a state of many small particles.""  The program was designed to observe the effects of these small particles on the dark matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Baqaedah moamilah (Regular forces):**  The passage doesn't mention regular forces as a key area of investigation.
* **B: Samundari taqatein (Oceanic forces):** This is a nonsensical option in the context of astronomy and dark matter.
* **D: Tareek moamilah (Complex forces):** While the interactions are likely complex, the passage specifically highlights the role of *small particles* within the dark matter.



"
Saensadaan darjah zail mein kiskey moamilah ka moshahidah kar rahey thay?,"The correct answer is **D: Dakh kahkushaan aur Milky Way**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the program was designed to improve observation quality of the **Dakh kahkushaan (Milky Way)**.
* The passage mentions a comparison between the dark matter density *between* the Milky Way and the **Dakh kahkushaan**.
* The analogy of gravity and tides is used to explain the influence of the Milky Way on the Dakh kahkushaan.

Therefore, the scientists were observing the interaction between the **Dakh kahkushaan (Milky Way)** and the **Dakh kahkushaan (Milky Way)**.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, qadamat pasandon ney kiss parr tanqid nahein ki thee?","The correct answer is **A: Raahat kharch karnaa (Relief expenses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the initial discussion was about ""imdaad aur baaz tameer parr hoay masarif"" (aid and repair expenses) and that some financial experts labeled it ""Bush's new Arlington deal.""  The passage then goes on to say that attempts at reconstruction need to be awarded to Chinese companies setting up in Washington.

The key point is that the experts didn't criticize the initial discussion about aid and repair expenses. The passage frames their reaction as *branding* it a specific deal (""Bush's new Arlington deal""). The criticism seems to be directed towards *who* will do the reconstruction and the involvement of Chinese companies, not the initial discussion of expenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tameere naz key koshish ki kami (Lack of attempt at reconstruction):** The passage explicitly states that attempts at reconstruction are being made and that contracts for this reconstruction need to be awarded.
* **C: Jisey tameere naz key moahedon sey nawazaa ja raha hay (That is being praised for reconstruction contracts):**  This is the opposite of what the passage implies. It doesn't say the contracts are being praised; it suggests they are a point of discussion or perhaps even concern.
* **D: Tameere nav ka kharcha karnaa (Reconstruction expenses):** The entire passage revolves around reconstruction expenses, indicating they are the subject of discussion, not criticism.



Therefore, the passage suggests experts didn't criticize the *initial discussion* about aid and repair expenses themselves.



"
Hurricane Katrina ki raahat koshishon keliye tameere nav key moahedaat ki kon tanqid kar rahaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Aazad khiyaal (Free-market)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...jisay baaz maaliyaati qadamat pasandon nay mezahan """"bush kee new arlens deal"""" kaa unwaan diyaa. Tameer naw kee koshish parr aazadana noqtah cheeni kaa markaz washington mein basnay waale mulazimin ko tameer naw key theekay denay parr hay.""

This translates to: ""...which some free-market advocates labeled as ""Bush's new Arlington deal."" The rebuilding efforts require awarding construction contracts to employees based in Washington, the center of libertarian thought.""

The phrase ""aazadana noqtah cheeni kaa markaz"" directly translates to ""center of libertarian thought.""  Therefore, the free-market advocates were criticizing the rebuilding contracts being awarded in a way that aligns with their ideology.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Stardust khalayi jahaaz sey roshniyaan kahaan sabsey pahley maryee hui theen?","The correct answer is **B: Shumaali California**.

The passage states: ""yeah shumali california key maghribi saahil key oper say guzray ga..."" This indicates that Northern California is where the light show will be seen first.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Khalayi jahaaz darjah zail mein sey kiskey liye record qayem karey gaa?","The correct answer is **C: Zameen tak sabsey tez waapas aana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Stardust zameen parr wapas aaney waali tez tareen khalayi gaadi honey kaa eek naya record qayem karay gaa."" (Stardust will set a new record for the fastest spacecraft returning to Earth.)

Therefore, the spacecraft is setting a record for the fastest return *to Earth*. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Doctor Malar Balasubramanian ka Saroja Balasubramanian sey kiya rishtah thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Maan** (Mother).

The text states that Saroja Balasubramanian was 53 years old and Dr. Miller Balasubramanian was 29. This age difference strongly suggests a mother-daughter relationship. The question asks about the relationship between the two, and ""Maan"" translates to ""Mother"" in Hindi.
"
Sara Balasubramanian ki laash kahaan mili thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Sadak key bagal mein** (On the side of the road).

The text states: ""Woh sadak kinaray zameen parr tshirt aur under wear mein intehayi nashah kee haalat mein padee milli thee."" which translates to ""She was found on the side of the road in a state of extreme intoxication wearing only a t-shirt and underwear.""
"
eBay ney keya haasil kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states that eBay hopes to increase its revenue and gain popularity in markets where Skype has a strong foothold. Therefore, eBay acquired Skype.
"
Hosulyaabi key saath eBay kiya haasil kar raha tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Naye elaqon mein tausee karnaa (Expanding into new markets)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Company ko ummid hay keh woh apnay munafa key maakhaz mein tanawwo paida karay gee aur inn shoabon mein maqboliyat haasil karay gee jaheen skype kee mazboot pakad hay, jaise cheen, mashriqi europe aur brazeel."" 

This translates to: ""The company hopes to diversify its sources of profit and gain popularity in these sectors where Skype has a strong hold, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.""

This clearly indicates eBay's goal is to expand into new markets. While increasing revenue and improving its profile are likely outcomes of expansion, the *direct* goal mentioned is market expansion.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Unn qaidiyon key saath kisney taamul kiya thaa jo ladayi key baad sahan mein rah gaye thay?","The correct answer is **A: Mozakiraat kaar (Negotiators)**.

The passage states: ""Mozakerah kaaron nay soorat hal kee islaah kee koshish kee..."" which translates to ""Negotiators tried to improve the situation..."" This indicates that the negotiators were trying to address the concerns of the remaining prisoners.
"
Darjah zail mein sey akhir kaar kiski wajah sey qaidi fasaad sey waapas shaant huey thay?,"The correct answer is **B: Aansu gas (tear gas)**.

Here's why:

The text states that security officers used tear gas to disperse the prisoners after the fire started. It also mentions that the fire brigade brought the fire under control. While the initial situation was likely influenced by the injured prisoner and the prisoners' demands, the immediate action that brought the unrest under control was the use of tear gas by the security forces. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kamiyaab mozakiraat (Failed negotiations):** The negotiations were trying to resolve the situation, but the text doesn't state that they were successful.  The unrest continued until the tear gas was deployed.
* **C: Saathi zakhmi qaidi (Injured comrade):** While the injured prisoner was present, the text doesn't indicate that their presence directly led to the prisoners calming down.
* **D: Eek aag (A fire):** The fire *caused* the unrest, but it was the tear gas that brought the unrest under control. The fire itself didn't resolve the situation.



"
"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei key nazriyah mein, mulke Iran ko apney aap ko kis cheez sey aazad karana chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Tel parr inhesaar (Oil dependence)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mulk key supreme leader, aayat allah alee khumaini nay 1979 mein iraan key islaami inqilaab say pehli dafah key tel parr inhesaar ko """"eek jaal"""" qaraar diyaa hay aur kahaa keh mulk ko uss say khud ko azad karaana hoga.""  This translates to ""The country's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, considered oil dependence a ""trap"" in 1979 before the Islamic Revolution and said that the country had to free itself from it.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Irani maeeshat parr pabandi key asaraat ka kisney eteraaf kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Mulk key supreme leader, aayat allah alee khumaini nay 1979 mein iraan key islaami inqilaab say pehli key tel parr inhesaar ko """"eek jaal"""" qaraar diyaa hay..."" This clearly indicates Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (then the Supreme Leader) acknowledged the negative impact of oil dependence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Senior zaraaye:** This is a general term and not a specific person or entity.
* **B: OPEC:** The passage mentions OPEC's report on decreased oil exports, but doesn't state they *admitted* the impact of sanctions on the Iranian economy.
* **D: European Union:** The passage mentions the EU's oil embargo, but doesn't say the EU acknowledged the impact on the Iranian economy.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon France key voting amal ka hissah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ummidwaaron key nomaindon key zariyah vote giney gaye** (Votes counted through candidates' representatives).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that volunteers count the votes at the end of the day, following strict supervision and rules.  It mentions candidates having the right to send representatives to oversee the process, but **it does not say that candidates' representatives actually count the votes**.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the French voting process:

* **A: Saaf shaffaaf voting key boxes** - The text says ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988.
* **B: Ummidwaaron key bhejey gaye nomaindey** - Candidates can send representatives to observe the election process.
* **C: Voting roll mein dastakhat karna** - Voters sign the voting roll after their identity is verified.



Therefore, option D is the one that doesn't align with the provided description of the French voting system.
"
Vote deney waaley apney muntakhab ummidwar ka kahaan isharah kartey hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek pahley sey chapi hui kaghaza ki sheet parr** (On a pre-printed paper sheet).

The passage states: ""raaye dehindgan voting booth mein khud ko alag kartay hain, pehle say chhapi hoyee kaghaz kee sheet parr apni pasand key ummidwar ko nishaan zad karkay usay eek lifafay mein daal detay hain."" (Voters isolate themselves in the voting booth, mark their preferred candidate on a pre-printed paper sheet, and then put it in an envelope.)
"
Konsi cheez Allen key liye Musashi ki aath salah talaash shuru karney ka baes bani?,"The correct answer is **C: Samundari daryaaft mein uski sarmayah kaari (His investment in marine exploration)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""... Duniya key sab say ameer logon mein say eek, ailan nay mubayyanah tor parr apni ziyadah tar dolat samundari taftish mein kharch kee..."" (One of the wealthiest people in the world, Ailan, openly spent most of his wealth on marine exploration...).
* This directly links his wealth and investment in marine exploration to the search for Musashi.  The other options are incorrect because while he's wealthy and interested in exploration, the *reason* he's specifically searching for Musashi is because of his investment in that area.  His interest in war (D) is mentioned as a reason for pursuing Musashi in general, not the direct motivation for initiating the search.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Allen ney apney paisey ki ahem miqdaar kis cheez parr kharch ki thee?","The correct answer is **C: Eek ROV tameer karna (Building an ROV)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Duniya key sab say ameer logon mein say eek, ailan nay mubayyanah tor parr apni ziyadah tar dolat samundari taftish mein kharch kee aur apni puri zindagi jang mein dilchaspi rakhnay kee wajah se mosashi ko dhoondnay ke liye apni jadujehad kartay rahay.""  This translates to: ""One of the wealthiest people in the world, Allen, openly spent most of his wealth on marine exploration and relentlessly pursued finding Musashi because of his lifelong interest in adventure.""

Later, it mentions: ""Samundari tah kee naqsha kushee key baad gharq shudah shikasta jahaaz ko rov istemaal kartay hoay talaash karr lia gayaa...""  This translates to: ""After charting the seabed, the sunken wreckage was found using an ROV...""

Therefore, Allen spent most of his money on marine exploration, and the discovery of the wreckage was made *using* an ROV.  The text doesn't say he spent his money on restoring Musashi or learning about seabed mapping; it explicitly states the use of the ROV as part of the exploration.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon mumkanah tor parr plant key andar aur ird gird key khatarnaak halaat ka baes hua thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Uranium eendhan (Uranium fuel)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Japan kee nuclear agency key mutabiq uss plant mein radio active casium aur ayodeen kee shanakht kee gayee hay. Hukkaam andazah lagaa rahay hain keh iss say zahir hota hay keh site parr mojud johri eendhan waale dabbay phat gaye hain aur uss say rasao ho rahaa hay."" (According to the Japan nuclear agency, radioactive cesium and iodine were identified in the plant. Authorities estimate that it appears that the spent fuel containers on site have burst and are reacting.)

* **The passage directly links the ""white smoke"" and the radioactive elements to the spent fuel containers.** The phrase ""spent fuel containers"" strongly implies the presence of uranium fuel that has been used in the reactor. 

* **While radioactive cesium and iodine are present, they are *results* of the reaction, not the *cause* of the dangerous situation.**  The primary source of the danger is the reaction involving the uranium fuel.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Radioactive caesium:**  Caesium is a *result* of the reaction, not the initial cause of the dangerous state.
* **C: Safed dhuwaan (White smoke):** The white smoke is a *symptom* of the reaction, caused by the fuel reacting. It isn't the fundamental cause.
* **D: Iodine:** Iodine is also a *result* of the reaction, and identified *along with* cesium, not as the primary dangerous element originating from the initial incident.



Therefore, the most probable cause of the dangerous conditions in and around the plant is the **Uranium fuel.**



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon plant mein haadsah key baad maqaami bashindon ko tajweez kardah mahfooz nikaat mein sey eek nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Andar qeaam karein (Stay indoors)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states residents should ""rehney"" (stay) indoors.**  ""Andar qeaam karein"" means ""stay indoors"" and is a correct instruction.
* **The text mentions avoiding air conditioners.** This is because they can potentially draw contaminated air inside.
* **The text advises against drinking tap water** due to potential contamination.
* **The white smoke is a sign of radioactive material.** Avoiding inhaling the smoke is crucial.

Therefore, ""Andar qeaam karein"" is a restatement of the instruction to stay indoors, not a specific precaution against the hazards of the accident.  The other options directly address potential dangers from the smoke, contaminated air, and water.

So, option B is the one that *isn't* a specific precaution advised in the text.
"
"Doctor Moll key hisaab sey, XDR-TB key baarey mein sabsey ziyadah fikar ki baat kiya hay?","The correct answer is **D: Yeah bahut halakat ki sharah hay (The high rate of mortality).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Dr. Moll says XDR-TB is ""bahut ziyadah preeshan kunn hay aur halakat kee sharah bahut ziyadah honey kee wajah say ziyadah khatarnaak hay"" which translates to ""very concerning and more dangerous because the rate of deaths is very high.""
* While the other options are related to the spread of XDR-TB, the primary concern Dr. Moll expresses is the high mortality rate.

Therefore, option D best reflects Dr. Moll's stated concern.
"
Naye motaghayyar key saath contact mein aaney waaley kitney marizon key baarey mein sehat ki dekh bhaal key molazmeen key tor parr hui hay?,"The answer is **A: 10**.

The text states: ""Ek saal kee muddat mein eek mutissirah shakhs qareeb mein rehney waale **10 say 15 afraad** ko mutissir kar sakta hai."" (In a year, one infected person can infect **10 to 15** people living nearby.)  While the range is 10-15, the question asks how many patients health care workers have been involved with *due to contact with the new variant*. The text mentions that a single infected person can infect 10-15 nearby individuals.  Therefore, 10 is the most reasonable and directly stated number related to healthcare workers potentially involved in patient care."
NextGen system kis qism ki taknik ka istemaal karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Satellite-parr mabni taknik**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yeah settlite parr mabni technology kaa istemaal karta hay jo qadray puraani zamini-raddar-parr mabni technology say mukhalif hoti hoti hay..."" (It uses satellite-based technology which is different from older ground-based radar technology...).
"
NextGen fazayi traffic key controll kerney walon ko barahe raast kaisey fayedah pahunchata hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ziyadah mukhtasar udaan key raastey (More direct flight routes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that NextGen uses satellite-based technology to allow aircraft to fly on shorter, more direct routes. This is the primary benefit mentioned in relation to fuel savings and carbon emissions reduction. While options B, C, and D are all *consequences* of the shorter routes (less fuel, lower emissions), the *direct benefit* to air traffic controllers is the ability to establish more direct flight paths.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Moarrikhin ney kiss cheez parr tawajjo diya jaaney key liye FBI par tnaqid nahi ki hay?","The correct answer is **A: Apni kamiyaabi ki sharah ko badha chadha kar batana (Explaining successes in an exaggerated way)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Moarrkheen criticizes the FBI's past policies for **exaggerating** the successes of agencies by focusing on easily solvable cases, specifically those involving stolen cars. The passage also mentions the Congress's action regarding funding to prevent pornography.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Aasani sey hal honey waaley jarayem key wasail ki takhsees karna (Allocating resources to easily solvable crimes):** This *is* what Moarrkheen criticizes the FBI for.
*   **C: Fuhush nigaari key cason par ziyadah tawajjoh dena (Focusing on pornography cases):** The passage *mentions* the Congress's funding related to pornography, but Moarrkheen's criticism isn't about focusing on these cases *themselves*.
*   **D: Chori shudah car ke case (Stolen car cases):** This is *specifically mentioned* as an example of the type of easily solvable case the FBI prioritized.

Therefore, the only thing Moarrkheen *isn't* criticizing the FBI for is exaggerating their successes. The criticism is about how they *explain* their successes, not the successes themselves.



"
Fahhashi ki pahal FBI ko keya karney key liye majboor karti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Fahash nigaari key cason key liye agenton ko waqf karney**.

The passage states: ""Congress nay maali saal 2005 mein fahhashi roknay key iqdamat kee maali eanat shuroo kee aur waazeh kiya keh F B I ko apnay 10 karindon ko balighon kee fahash nigaari roknay keliye waqf karnaa paray gaa.""  This directly translates to the FBI being compelled to allocate agents to prevent child pornography.
"
39c jas grapin ki takkar ka jawaab deney waali aag ki gaadi key saath keya hua thaa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Usmein dhamakah ho gaya thaa** (There was an explosion in it).

The provided text says the plane ""phat karr tabaah ho gayaa"" (exploded and was destroyed), and that a fire truck ""karrwayi kartay waqt ulat gayee"" (overturned while trying to intervene). This implies an explosion occurred when the fire truck collided with the plane.
"
"39c jas grapin ki takkar key baad, airport ko kiskey liye band kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: tejarti parwazon (commercial flights)**.

The text states: ""Maqami media nay bataya keh hawai adday kee eek aag bhujhanay waali gaadi karrwayi kartay waqt ulat gayee. Pilot ko schwadern leader delocart patawi key naam say shanakht kiya gayaa. **Pilot ko schwadern leader delocart patawi key naam say shanakht kiya gayaa.

Irani inqilaab key doraan brazizensky nay kisko rahnumayi pesh kash ki thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The passage states: ""Uss nay qomi salamati mosheer kee haisiyat say aalimi muamilat ko sfarti tor par sanbhalne mein carter kee madad kee, jaise camp dude muahidah 1978aa, 1970 kee dahayi key aakhir mein america aur cheen key talluqat ko mamool parr laana, irani inqilaab, jo irani yarghumal bohraan 1979 kaa baes banaa aur 1979 mein soviet kaa afghanistan parr qabzah.""

This clearly indicates that Brazinsky advised President Carter during the Iranian Revolution.
"
1977 tak kisney qomi salamati musheer ka uhdah sanbhala thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states: ""...usss key baad 1977 ta1981 tak hennry kasenger kee jagah qomi salamati mosheer (N S A) key tor parr apni khidmaat anjaam deen."" which translates to ""...after that, from 1977 to 1981, he served as National Security Advisor (NSA) in place of Henry Kissinger.""
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon partizan belgrade key saath bobeek key career ki durust tor parr akkasi nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Uney team key liye kheltey huey 468 sey ziyadah goal kiye thay**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Unn ke apni team key saath key dor mein uss nay 468 matchon mein 403 goal kiye."" This means he scored *403* goals, not 468.  Therefore, option A is incorrect.

Here's why the other options are correct:

* **B: Usney kisi bhi deegar kheladi ki banisbat ziyadah goal kiye thay:** The passage states he scored more goals than any other player for the club.
* **C: Usko team ki tarikh mein eek baar behtareen khelaadi chuna gaya thaa:** The passage directly states he was named the best player in Partizan's history in 1995.
* **D: Usney kisi bhee deegar khelaadi ki banisbat ziyadah gamon mein hissah liya thaa:**  The passage states he had the most appearances for the club and scored the most goals.  Having the most appearances implies participating in the most games (matches).



"
Partizan belgrade key saath bobeek ki tarikh key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust nahi hay?,"The incorrect statement is **D: Usey Partizan ka betareen kheladi chuney jaaney key bad shurat haasil hui thee.**

Here's why:

* The text states that Bobeek achieved fame playing for Zagreb *before* joining Partizan.
* He became considered Partizan's best player *in 1995*, after his long and successful career with the club.  Therefore, his fame *preceded* being named the best player.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Usney 1945 mein partizan keliye khelnaa shuru kiya (He started playing for Partizan in 1945)** - This is directly stated in the text.
* **B: Uney partizan belgrade sey pahley Zagreb keliye khelaa thaa (He played for Zagreb before Partizan Belgrade)** -  The text explicitly says he played for Zagreb before joining Partizan.
* **C: Usney 1995 tak Partizan keliye khelaa thaa (He played for Partizan until 1995)** - This is stated in the text.



Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi khosusiyat Hespronex ko velocroptor sey mkhtalif banati hay?","The correct answer is **B: Iska eek ziyadah badaa dusra panjah hai** (It has a relatively bigger second claw).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Uss kaa dosra panjah nisbatan badaa thaa, jokeh hespironex naam kee maqboliyat kaa baes banaa jis kaa matlab """"maghribi panjah"""" hota hay."" (Its second claw was relatively big, which became the reason for the popularity of the name Hespronex, which means ""western claw"").  The passage also mentions they walk on two legs, similar to velociraptors, but this isn't a unique feature *distinguishing* them.  While it's true they are warm-blooded (D), that's not the distinguishing feature described. Option A is incorrect because the passage states they walk on two legs. Option C is too general; both velociraptors and Hespronex are described as having complete wings, so this doesn't differentiate them.



"
“Hespronex” ks matlab parjaatiyon ki kiss jismani khususiyat sey maakhuz hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Panjah (panjey)**.

The text states: ""...hespironex naam kee maqboliyat kaa baes banaa jis kaa matlab """"maghribi panjah"""" hota hay.""  This directly translates to ""the popularity of the name Hespironex is due to its meaning 'western claw'."" Therefore, the name is derived from a specific physical characteristic – its claw.
"
Shoot karney key baarey mein darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?,"The incorrect statement about the shooting is **B: Wahan paanch motassirin they (There were five victims).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the shooter was one of four people killed. This makes a total of **five** victims (the shooter and the four killed). So, statement B is technically correct, but the question asks which statement is *incorrect*, implying one of the statements is false.

Let's analyze the other options:

* **A: Shohar aur biwi donon Texas sey thay (The husband and wife were both from Texas):** This is stated in the passage: ""30 salah shohar... Texas mein eek saal qabal shaadi kee aur ahbaab aur rishtay daaron key saath jashan mananay buflo aayey they."" (30-year-old husband... married in Texas a year ago and came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.)
* **C: Buffalo mein eek saal pahley iss jodey ki shaadi hui thee (This couple got married in Buffalo a year ago):** This is incorrect. The passage says they *came to Buffalo* to celebrate their wedding anniversary.
* **D: Shoot karaa Buffalo mein waqea hua thaa (The shooting occurred in Buffalo):** This is stated in the passage: ""Buffalo mein paida honey waala..."" (Born in Buffalo...).

Therefore, the answer is **C: Buffalo mein eek saal pahley iss jodey ki shaadi hui thee (This couple got married in Buffalo a year ago).**
"
Jahaan shooting hui thee wahaan ki taqrib key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah durust nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Yeah jodey ki shaadi mein waqea hua thaa (Yeah the event happened at the couple's wedding)**.

Here's why:

The text states the event happened at a **first anniversary party** for a couple who got married a year prior. It did **not** happen *during* their wedding. Options A, B, and C are all consistent with the information provided.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Luno key baarey mein afsaraan key dariyaan ibtadai tashweesh kiya thee?","The correct answer is **B: Lahrein aur tez hawayein**.

The passage states that the ship was pushed towards the shore by strong winds and waves. The initial concern was that the cargo would be damaged, which is a consequence of the harsh weather conditions (winds and waves). The passage explicitly mentions the winds and waves causing the ship to run aground.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khaad key samaan ki kami (Shortage of cargo):** While the ship was carrying cargo, the primary concern at the beginning was not a lack of cargo, but the potential damage *to* the cargo.
* **C: Eendhan ka bahao (Fuel leakage):** The problem was the ship running aground due to the weather, not a fuel leak. The passage mentions the engine failure *after* the ship ran aground.
* **D: Amalah key araakin par mumkanah hamlah (Possible attack on the crew):** There's no mention of any threat to the crew in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Luno ki toot key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Samaan uthaney sey pahley toot waqea hui thee** (The breakage occurred before loading the cargo).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Lono mein 160-120 cubic meter eendhan thaa jab yeah kharab ho gayaa aur tez hawa aur lahron nay uss ko saahil parr banny rokaat mein dhakel diyaa."" (Lono had 160-120 cubic meters of fuel when it broke down and strong winds and waves pushed it to the shore.)

* The passage also mentions that the ship was carrying cargo (""100 meter kaa jahaaz apnay mamool kaa khad cargo lenay jaarha thaa"" - A 100-meter ship was going to carry cargo as usual).

Therefore, the breakdown happened *after* the ship had started its journey with cargo. Option A is the incorrect statement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Tootney key waqt jahaaz mein 100 meter eendhan thaa** (There were 100 meters of fuel on the ship at the time of the breakdown) - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **C: Amalah key barahh araakin mein sey, eek zakhmi hua thaa** (From the twelve crew members, one was injured) - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **D: Jahaz ko sahili rukawat mein dhakel diya gaya thaa** (The ship was pushed to the coastal obstacle) - This is directly stated in the passage.



"
Kis dahaai mein Algeria ko aazadi mili thee?,"The correct answer is **B: 1950 kee dahayi**.

The text states: ""Doosri jang azeem key doraan jab woh francisi mozahimat mein shaamil hoay to unn kee umar mahaz 15 saal thee."" This indicates their involvement in the war during WWII, which primarily took place in the 1940s.  The phrase ""naw azad aljazair ko wapas aaya"" (returned to free Algeria) implies Algeria gained independence in the 1950s. While the exact year isn't given in the text, the context points to the 1950s as the decade of Algerian independence.
"
Akhiri rosumaat ki taqrib keliye television screen kahaan set up nahein hui thee?,"The correct answer is **D: St. Peter key morabbah mein (in St. Peter's Square)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Itly aur baaqi duniya key deegar bahut say shehron, khaas tor parr poland mein Usee tarah kaa set up tayyaar kiya gayaa thaa, jis kaa moshahidah bary taadad mein logon nay kiya thaa.""  This means the TV screens were set up in Italy and other cities worldwide, *excluding* St. Peter's Square itself, because it was impossible for everyone to reach the burial site.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Purey rome mein (throughout Rome):** The passage says screens were set up in multiple locations *around* Rome.
* **B: Itly key motaddid shahron mein (in multiple cities of Italy):** This is stated directly in the passage.
* **C: Poland key makhsus mahallate waqoo (in special locations in Poland):**  This is also stated directly in the passage.



"
Akhiri rosum ki taqrib kahaan munaqid hui thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Rome key motaddid maqaamat mein** (In multiple locations in Rome).

The passage states: ""Rome key mutaddid maqamat parr mutaddid baray size key TV screen nasab kiyey gaye taakeh log taqrib ko dekh sakein."" This translates to ""Multiple large-sized TV screens were installed in multiple locations in Rome so that people could watch the ceremony.""

"Dhamakah key baad, sangeen zakhmon key liye kiska elaaj kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Kam sey kam paanch log** (At least five people).

The text states: ""Jab ahalkaar pahunchnay, to apartment mein dhamaka ho gayaa. Kisee key ziyadah zakhmi honey kee ittelaa nahein thee, lekin dhamakay key waqt jaye waqoo parr mojud kam az kam paanch afraad kaa sadme kee alamaat keliye elaaj kiya gayaa thaa."" (When the officer arrived, an explosion occurred in the apartment. There was no report of serious injuries, but at least five people present at the time of the explosion were treated for symptoms of shock.)
"
Gas rasaai ki kisney ittelaa di thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Emaarat ka eek padosi (A neighbor of the building)**.

The text states: ""Eek padosi kee taraf say phone key zariah gas leak honey kee khabar denay key baad..."" which translates to ""After a neighbor called via phone to report a gas leak...""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, hamlah mein kitney log wafaat paa gaye thay?","The correct answer is **C: 5**.

The passage states: ""25 salah necolas elden, aur 21 salah cued back kee maut hogayi."" This translates to ""25 people named Nicolas Elden, and 21 people named Cued Back died.""  25 + 21 = 46, but the question asks how many died *in the attack*. The passage directly states that 21 people died in the attack.  However, there seems to be a mistake in the options provided. 

Let's analyze again. The text clearly states 21 people died. Considering the provided choices, there is likely a typo in the question or the answer options.  If we are forced to choose the closest option, and assuming the numbers were intended to be smaller, and *21* was a typo, then the closest option would be C (5).

However, based on the text, the most accurate answer would be that 21 people died. As 21 is not an option, and assuming there is a typo in the question, the most reasonable choice would be C.



"
Hamlah key doraan kisi moqaam parr kiska aslahaa chalney mein nakaam ho gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The text states: ""Jab us nay panchwen shakhs key sarr parr usay taanaa to yuka kaa hathiyar fail ho gayaa."" This translates to: ""When he [Schneider] kicked the fifth person's head, Yuka's weapon failed.""
"
Konsa darjah zail khel Olympic program sey baahar ho gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

The passage states: ""Scosesh, karate aur roller sports neez basket ball aur soft ball nay olympic programme mein daakhilah kee koshish kee, jo 2005 mein olympic games say khaarij karr diye gaye they."" This translates to: ""Scottish, karate and roller sports tried to enter the Olympic program along with basketball and softball, which were removed from the Olympic Games in 2005.""

Therefore, baseball (softball) was removed from the Olympic program in 2005."
Konsey darhah zail khelon ko aalami Olympic Committee ney khelon mein shaamil karney key liye vote kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Rugby union**.

The text explicitly states: ""Rugby, khaas tor parr ragbi union, aur golf ko olympics mein shaamil karnay keliye deegar paanch khelon parr tarjih di gayee."" (Rugby, in particular rugby union, and golf were prioritized over other five sports for inclusion in the Olympics.)

While the other options were mentioned as having tried to be included, the primary focus of the vote was on Rugby Union.
"
Arthur Guinness ney dar asal St James’ Gate Brewery ko kitney saal key liye lease parr liya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The question asks how many years Arthur Guinness leased St James' Gate Brewery for. The text states he signed a 9,000-year lease in 1759, and 250 years later it had become a major business.  Therefore, the lease was for 250 years.
"
Guinness har saal taqriban kitney billion dollar lekar aata hay?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Guinness's annual turnover is **14.7 billion US dollars**.  Option C (14) is the closest available option. Options A and D are incorrect. Option B (250) is irrelevant as it refers to the time period after Guinness's development."
European Union key kitney mamalik mein H5N1 virus ki shanaakht hui hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Saat**.

The text explicitly states: ""France iss wires mein mubtala europi union kaa saatwaan mulk hay."" which translates to ""France is the seventh country in the EU infected with this outbreak.""
"
H5N1 virus ka shanaakht kardah aakhiri case kahaan thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The text states: ""france iss wires mein mubtala europi union kaa saatwaan mulk hay."" which translates to ""France is the seventh European Union country affected by this outbreak."" This directly confirms that France has a confirmed H5N1 case.  The question asks where the *latest* confirmed case was, and the text implies France is the most recent addition to the list after Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy.
"
Aman key daston ki wajah sey failao sey pahley Haaiti ka aakhiri baar bimaari sey saamna kabb hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 ki dahaai mein (18th century)**.

The text states: ""Daston kee aamad say qabal, heaty ko attharvein sadee say bemari say mutalliq masail kaa saamna nahein huwa thaa."" which translates to ""Before the arrival of the troops, Haiti had not faced disease-related problems since the 18th century.""
"
Kiss jagah ki gandagi ney beemari key failao mein taawun kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Artibonite daryaa (Artibonite River)**.

The passage states: ""Moqaddame key mutabiq aqwam muttahedah camp kaa fozlah munasib andaaz mein cenitize nahein kiya gayaa jis kee wajah say heaty kee sab say bary artibo neat nadi kee shaakh mein jaraseem daakhil hogaye."" This translates to: ""According to the prosecution, the UN camp waste was not properly sanitized, which led to germs entering the branch of the largest Artibonite River in Haiti.""



"
Ireland ki hukumat kiya karney ki mansubah bandi karr rahi hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Manshiyaat key imkaan parr mazeed kadey qanoon ka taaruf karana (Introducing stricter laws on drug use)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the Irish government is focusing on correcting the ""suratehaal"" (situation) of drug use.
* It mentions the need to pass legislation as quickly as possible to address the issue.
* The Health Minister expresses concern about both the recovery of those benefiting from currently legal drugs and the sentences being handed out for drug-related offenses, particularly after unofficial amendments.  This indicates a desire for stricter regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manshiyaat key mujrimin keliye saza ki yaqeen dahaani karaney (Ensuring certainty of punishment for drug offenders):** While a part of the government's concerns, it's not the overarching plan. The focus is on correcting the overall drug situation.
* **C: Manshiyaat key imkaan parr qanoon ki choot dena (Legalizing drugs):** The text is focused on *stricter* laws, not legalization.
* **D: Manshiyaat ko jurm sey baahar karnaa (Removing drugs from the realm of crime):** Again, the text points to stricter regulations, not removing drugs from the legal framework entirely.



"
Ireland mein aarzi tor parr konsi cheez qanooni thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Manshiyaat (Drugs)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Irish hukumat suratehaal ko durust karnay key liye parliamani qanoon saazi kee ujlat par zoor day rahee hay. yeah sehate aammah aur janayi adl donon wajhate nazar say ahem hay keh matlubah qanoon jitni jald mumkin ho marsoom kiya jaye, **yeah baat eek sarkari tarjuman nay kahee. Wazeere sehat nay unn afraad kee behbood kee nisbat say jo aarizi tor say qanoonan mubaah kee gayee manshiyaat se mustafid ho rahay hain...**""

This clearly indicates that drugs were legal on a temporary basis in Ireland.
"
Mushtabah mujrim key liye kiss cheez ki tafteesh ki jaarahi thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Guda gardi (Rape)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the police are investigating a crime where ""mushtabah mard janayat kaar say dakhle beja nah keh toad phod key baaray mein taftish kee jaa rahee hay."" The description of the ""mark"" being changed from ""o"" to ""e"" using ""signs of peace and heart"" and ""black tarpaulins"" strongly indicates sexual assault (rape).  The word ""toad phod"" (toad break) is a euphemism often used in Hindi/Urdu to refer to sexual assault.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Tajawuz karney (Sexual assault)**: While close, the description points towards a specific type of sexual assault.
*   **B: Jismaani noqsaan (Physical harm)**: The description doesn't focus on physical injuries.
*   **D: Chori (Theft)**: This is completely unrelated to the details provided in the text.

Therefore, **C: Guda gardi (Rape)** is the most accurate answer based on the evidence given."
"Nishaani ko tabdil kartey waqt, mustabah ney kiya nahein kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Jismaani tor parr usey noqsaan kar diya (Physically damaged it)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Alaamat ko jismani tor parr badla nahein gayaa thaa."" This translates to ""The sign was not physically altered.""

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iska eek harf tabdil kar diya (One letter was changed):** The text says the sign was altered by changing ""o"" to ""e"" using black tarpaulins with signs of peace and heart. So, a letter *was* changed.
* **B: Aman ki nishaani key saath isey mozayyan kar diya (It was clarified with signs of peace):** The text mentions the use of signs of peace and heart *with* the alteration, making this true.
* **D: Ismein tarmeem karney keliye tirpaalon ka istemaal karein (Use tarpaulins for repair):** The text states tarpaulins *were* used to *conceal* the alteration, not repair it.

Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the text is that the sign was physically damaged.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiss parr angrezi key tutor Karno ney ilzaam nahein lagaya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Kisi talib ilm ko date karnaa** (Teaching students dating skills).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a former student said Karno used ""bazaari zubaan"" (vulgar language), used notes to teach ""dating skills,"" and acted like a friend to the students.  This directly relates to option B.

The passage mentions accusations of:

* **Haqqe tabaat ki khelaaf warzi (violating religious sentiments):**  ""Uss parr maazi mein haqqe ashaat kee khelaaf warzi kaa elzaam aayed kiya gayaa hay, lekin uss say qeemat nahein lie gayee.""
* **Majaaz ishteharaat chapna (publishing misleading advertisements):** ""Modern education nay uss parr elzaam lagaya keh woh baghair ejazat key bason parr baday baday ishteharaat shaye karwata hay...""
* **Class mein napaak zuban istemaal karna (using foul language in class):** ""...aur yeah jhoot phailata hay keh woh chief angrezi tutor thaa. Uss parr maazi mein haqqe ashaat kee khelaaf warzi kaa elzaam aayed kiya gayaa hay..."" (The use of ""haqqe ashaat"" implies foul language).

Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned as an accusation leveled *at* Karno by modern education or other sources is teaching dating skills.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Rolando Mendoza ney kisko bnadhak nahein banay thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Police key log**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Rolando Mendoza took Hong Kong tourists hostage. He shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle. While police were likely involved in the aftermath and potentially responding to the situation, the passage *doesn't* say he took police officers hostage. He specifically targeted the tourists.

*   **Tourists:** He explicitly took them hostage.
*   **Children:** The hostages included children.
*   **Photographers:** The photographers were taken hostage along with the other hostages.
*   **Police key log:** The passage doesn't mention him taking any police officers hostage. He was killed by the police.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kiss bandhak ki tasdiqu bator jaldi chooeney key nahein hui thee?","The correct answer is **B: Boodha (Old woman)**.

The passage states that the Philippine photographers sat near the *old woman* who went to relieve herself. This implies that the old woman was the one who was held hostage and whose condition was observed by the photographers, making her the one whose safety was being quickly assessed. The text mentions that at least six hostages, including children and the old woman, were quickly released.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Brazil mein hamjins ki shaadi ki himaayat mein dastakhat ekattha kon kar rahaa thsaa?","The correct answer is **A: Mozahereen (Protesters)**.

The text states: ""Muzahireen nay ummid jatayi hay keh november mein national congress key saamney arzi dayer karnay keliye unn key paas 1.2 millin darkhwastein jamma hojayein gee."" This translates to ""Protesters expect to have 1.2 million requests gathered by November to file an application in front of the national congress.""  Therefore, the protesters are collecting signatures to support same-sex marriage.
"
Mozahereen ney apni pettion kisko di thee,"The correct answer is **C: Brazil ki qomi Congress**.

The passage states: ""Muzahireen nay ummid jatayi hay keh november mein national congress key saamney arzi dayer karnay keliye unn key paas 1.2 millin darkhwastein jamma hojayein gee.""  This translates to ""Demonstrators hope to have 1.2 million requests submitted to the National Congress in November.""
"
"Armand warsi key hisaab sey, bheed key mosam ka radde amal shuru karney sey pahley kiya hua thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Display paanch minat pichey chal raha thaa**.

The passage states: ""Display mein paanch mint dekhnay key baad hawa andar daakhil honey lagi..."" This means the display was showing something (presumably related to weather conditions) for five minutes *before* the wind started entering.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zalah baari shuru hogayi thee:** The passage says it started raining *after* the wind began, not before.
* **C: Tez hawayein theen:** While strong winds occurred, the initial trigger described is the display showing something for five minutes before the wind entered.
* **D: Wohh khandaan key eek rukn ka suraag kho diya thaa:** Armand lost his sister and her friend, but the passage doesn't explicitly state he lost a member of his family. It mentions he lost his sister and her friend.
"
"Warsi key hisaab sey, sabsey tez hawayein kabb shurru huein?","The correct answer is **B: Barish key baad**.

The passage states: ""Display mein paanch mint dekhnay key baad hawa andar daakhil honey lagi, eek minut baad hawa 70kelometer/ghantah kee raftaar say hawa pahunchnay lagi...uss key baad baarish shuroo hogayi...""  This clearly indicates the wind reached 70 km/h *after* the rain started. Therefore, according to Armand Warsi, the fastest winds started *after* the rain began.
"
"Fred sey pahley, 35°W key mashriq mein kitney baday toofan record kiye gaye hein?","The answer is **B: Teen (Three)**.

The text states: ""...and yeah 35 deg dabliyo key mashriq mein abb tak key record kaa teesra badaa samundari toofan hay."" This translates to ""...and it is currently the third largest tropical storm east of 35°W.""
"
"Jabb Fred Cape Verde jazeeron key paas waqea hua thaa, kiss samt mein yeah chal rahaa thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Shumaal maghrib** (Northwest).

The text states: ""Freed... woh shumaal maghrib kee jaanib safar karr rahaa hay."" which translates to ""Freed... is traveling towards the northwest.""
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiski apney pesh rowon key moqabiley ziyadah tez raftaarein theen?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states that ""802.11n raftaar maqool hadd tak apnay pesh row key muqabilay ziyadah tez hay jis kee raftaar nazaryati tor parr 600mbit/s kee thropat hoti hai.""  (802.11n speed is reasonably faster than its predecessors, with a theoretical throughput of 600 Mbit/s.) The other options (802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a) are not mentioned as being faster than 802.11n.
"
802.11b sey hamm aahang pichla honey key liye 802.11n ki khaatir kiya zaruri hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Dohrey radioz**.

Here's why:

* **Backward Compatibility:** The question asks what is *necessary* for 802.11n to be compatible with 802.11b.  The passage states that 802.11n can operate on both 2.4 GHz and 5.0 GHz frequencies and supports backward compatibility with older standards like 802.11a, b, and g *if* the base station has dual radios.
* **Dual Radios:**  Having two radios allows the 802.11n base station to handle both the newer 802.11n devices and the older 802.11b devices simultaneously.  One radio can be dedicated to 802.11n, while the other handles 802.11b.  Without this, the base station wouldn't be able to communicate with 802.11b devices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ahmiyat key saath ziyadah tez raftaarein (Emphasis on faster speeds):** While 802.11n is faster, the speed itself isn't the primary requirement for backward compatibility.
* **B: 802.11b keliye 5.0Ghz parr kaam karney ki salahiyat (Ability to work on 5.0 GHz for 802.11b):** 802.11b operates on 2.4 GHz, not 5.0 GHz.
* **C: 600Mbit/s ka eek thropat (A throughput of 600 Mbit/s):** The 600 Mbit/s throughput is a *feature* of 802.11n, not a requirement for backward compatibility.



"
Commonwealth khelon mein tairaaki ki wajah sey kitni taqribaat mein Olympic gold medal paaney waley thay?,"The answer is **A: Paanch (Five)**.

The question asks about the number of Olympians who won gold medals in Commonwealth Games due to swimming. The text states that Dolat Mushtarikah Khelon (presumably a reference to Commonwealth Games) had three relay events and 100m and 200m freestyle swimming, and that some athletes had their health compromised due to medication restrictions.  Since Dolat Mushtarikah Khelon is implied to be the Commonwealth Games, the passage suggests that *five* athletes won Olympic gold medals *because* of their swimming success in the Commonwealth Games.
"
Olympic gold medal haasil karney walaa apney dard keliye dawa keon nahein ley raha thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Usko tashweesh thee kehh iss sey uski fitness parr manfi asar padey gaa** (He was worried that it would negatively affect his fitness).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The athlete's health was suspect due to complaints, and they couldn't take pain medication because it was banned during competition.
* **Option C directly addresses this:** It explains the reason for not taking the medication – the athlete was concerned about the negative impact on their fitness, which would jeopardize their chances in future competitions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usko koyi dard nahein hua thaa** (He didn't have any pain) - The passage explicitly says their health was suspect *because* of complaints, implying pain or discomfort.
* **B: Iss sey wohh beemar padd gaya thaa** (He got sick from it) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Commonwealth khelon mein Iski ijaazat nahein hay** (It is not allowed in the Commonwealth Games) - The passage states the medication is banned during *Olympic* competitions, not Commonwealth Games.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, zalzalah ki sargarmi key baarey mein confusion ka keya baes hua hogaa?","The correct answer is **A: Kaaley badalon ki mojudgi (The presence of dark clouds)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Baadlon nay uljhan kaa imkaan paida kardiya keh aaya waaqaee aatish fashaan phat padaa thaa."" (The clouds created the possibility of confusion that a volcano had erupted.)

The dark clouds were the reason for the confusion about whether the seismic activity was caused by a volcanic eruption or something else. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Iceland ki Meteorological office ki ittelaat (Information from the Icelandic Meteorological Office):** The passage states that the office hasn't reported any recent earthquakes.
*   **C: Aalami zalzalah ka naqshah (Global earthquake map):** The passage mentions no recent earthquakes in the region, implying the global map isn't relevant to the confusion.
*   **D: Iceland key deegar elaqon mein ittelaa di gayi sargarmi (Activity reported in other regions of Iceland):** The passage focuses on activity near the volcano and doesn't mention other regions.

"
Ebarat key hisaab sey marhalay ki tabdili kabb waqea hui thee?,"The correct answer is **C: 10 march ko**.

The passage states: ""Zalzalay kee ahem srgarmi jis key baes marhalay mein tabdeeli kee gayee thee, woh 10 march ko aatish fashaan key sarbarahi ijlaas caledra key shumaal mashriq kee jaanib mein waaqa huyee thee.""  This directly translates to ""The main earthquake activity that caused the phase change occurred on March 10th...""
"
Chandrayaan-1 key qamari prob key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahi nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Prob ko launch karney waley madaar mein eek amalah thaa** (There was a malfunction in the orbit where the probe was launched).

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Chandrayaan-1 successfully nullified its moon impact probability.** This implies a successful mission.
* **The passage explicitly mentions the inclusion of three major scientific instruments and the painting of the national flag on the probe.** Both of these are confirmed facts from the text.
* **There is no mention of a malfunction during the launch.** The passage focuses on the successful impact probability being eliminated and the probe's journey to the south pole.

Therefore, option A is the statement that is *not* supported by the information given in the passage.
"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr qamari prob ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Isney chaand key shumaali pole key paas lend kiya thaa (It landed near the North Pole of the moon).**

Here's why:

The passage clearly states that Chandrayaan-1 successfully landed near the **south pole** of the moon. Option A says it landed near the north pole, which contradicts the information given in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: lend kartey huey iski takkar kamiyaab thee (The landing was successful).** The passage explicitly says the mission ""khaarij kiya jo chand kee satah parr utar gayaa"" which means it successfully landed on the moon's surface.
* **C: Iska eek insaani madaar sey ikhraaj kar liya gaya thaa (It was ejected from a human spacecraft).** While Chandrayaan-1 was launched by an Indian spacecraft, the passage doesn't state that it was ejected from a *human* spacecraft.  However, it *was* launched by a spacecraft, making this statement plausible, even if not explicitly stated.
* **D: Yeah do ahem aalaat lekar jaa raha thaa (It was carrying two important instruments).** The passage mentions the mission was to ""Teen ahem sciency aalat ko laadnay key saath"" meaning it was carrying three important scientific instruments. While it says *three*,  ""Yeah do ahem aalaat"" (two important instruments) isn't *incorrect* - it's a slight underestimation, but doesn't negate the validity of the statement.

Therefore, option A is the only one that directly contradicts the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, beemari sey tahaffuz ka konsa paimanah akhir mein naafiz kiya jaye gaa?","The correct answer is **C: Encephalitis vaccines**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the government has promised to create millions of encephalitis vaccines, with the help of health agencies in the next year. This directly indicates that vaccination is the primary method being planned for protection against the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Keedey maar adviyaat (Insecticide medicines):**  While insecticides are mentioned as part of the government's response, the focus is on vaccination as a key long-term solution.
* **B: Suwar pakadney waley (Pig catchers):**  Pig catchers are involved in controlling the disease in pigs (the initial host), but this isn't a direct method of protection for humans.
* **D: Machchar daaniyaan (Mosquito coils):** Mosquito coils are mentioned as part of the response, but are a temporary measure and not the primary solution being emphasized by the government.

Therefore, the promise of millions of encephalitis vaccines makes **C: Encephalitis vaccines** the most appropriate answer.
"
Beemari inssanon tak kaisey muntaqil hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Machchar (Mosquito)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah marz pehle suwar mein paida hota hay phir machhar uss ko insaanon ko muntaqil kartay hain."" which translates to ""This disease first appears in sheep, then mosquitoes transmit it to humans.""
"
Doosrey jumlah ki nakaami kiss natijah ka baes ho sakti thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Hamm jins samaji jaaton ka mustaqbil ka haque (The future rights of same-sex communities)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dosray jumley kee nakami, jo ham jinsi civil uninon parr pabandi aayed karnay kee tajweez pesh karta hay, mumkenah tor parr mustaqabil mein civil uninon keliye darwazay khol sakta hay.""  This translates to: ""The failure of the second clause, which proposes a ban on same-sex civil unions, could possibly open doors for civil unions in the future.""

Therefore, the failure of the second clause implies a potential positive outcome for the future rights of same-sex communities. Options A, C, and D are not directly linked to the consequences of the second clause failing as described in the text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, doosrey jumlah ko kabb hazaf kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Qanoon saazi key session key doraan (During the legislative session)**.

The passage states: ""Iss qanoon saazi key session mein uss waqat eek tabdeeli runuma hoyee jab dosray jumley ko pehle aiwani numaindagaan kee jaanib say hazaf kiya gayaa..."" which translates to ""A change occurred during this legislative session when the second sentence was removed by the parliamentary representatives...""
"
Kiskey samney “Panama Papers” leak kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Press**.

The text states: ""Dastawezaat zahir karti hain keh chodah bankon nay taxon aur deegar zawabit say bachnay key liye dolat mand saarfin kee arbon ameriki dollars ko chhapanay mein madad kee. Bartanvi akhbaar the gargian nay kahaa keh aisa karnay waali 1200 sell companion key eek tehayi ko doiche bank control karta thaa.""  This indicates that the documents were leaked to the press (specifically, the British newspaper The Guardian).

While the other options are mentioned in connection with the Panama Papers, the initial leak was to the press.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiskey baarey mein bartanavi press ka dawaa thaa kehh wohh dolat chupaney keliye istemaal honay waali bahut see companiyon ka bando bast kar raha thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bartanvi akhbaar the gargian nay kahaa keh aisa karnay waali 1200 sell companion key eek tehayi ko doiche bank control karta thaa."" (The British newspaper The Guardian said that a third of these companies, which did this, were controlled by Deutsche Bank.)
"
Darjah zail konsey sayyarah haadsah mein sabsey ziyadah halakatein hui theen,"Correct Answer: **C: Armenia sey Iran janey waley sayyarah ka rastah mein tasaadum**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the most significant accident in recent years was when an aircraft carrying 168 people to Armenia crashed. 
* The other accidents involved fewer fatalities: the police helicopter accident (3 dead, 3 injured) and the Mashhad plane accident (17 dead).

Therefore, the accident involving the flight from Armenia to Iran resulted in the highest number of casualties."
Darjah zail mein sey kon Iran mein waqea honany waaley fazaayi hadsaat ki bohtaat ki wajah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Naye sayyaron ki kharidaariyon ki ijaazat deney waley bajat ki kami.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the reason for the frequent accidents:** Iran's aircraft fleet is old, and maintenance isn't adequately performed for both civilian and military operations. This is directly linked to international sanctions preventing the purchase of new aircraft.
* **Options A, C, and D all support the information provided in the passage:**
    * **A (Old fleet):**  Directly mentioned as a key factor.
    * **C (Sanctions preventing new purchases):** Directly mentioned as a reason for the old fleet.
    * **D (Poor maintenance):**  Directly mentioned as a problem with the current fleet's upkeep.
* **Option B (Budget limitations for buying new aircraft) is irrelevant because the passage states that sanctions *prevent* the purchase of new aircraft.** The lack of budget isn't the *reason* for the accidents; the sanctions are.



Therefore, the budget limitations for buying new aircraft are not the main cause of the numerous air accidents in Iran, according to the information in the passage.



"
Iraq ki tahqiqi jaat ki report mein darjah zail mein sey kisko shaamill nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ameriki ittefaaqe rayon ki darkhawast (Request of American coalition forces)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the report is a critique of the current policy and stresses the need for immediate changes. Options A, C, and B all align with this.
* The report focuses on Iraq's policy and its borders. The request of American coalition forces would be an external element, not a part of the report's core focus on Iraq's internal policy and security.

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions the critique of the current policy, border security recommendations, and potential for reducing violence with changes, but it doesn't mention any requests from the American coalition forces.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko Iraq ki tahqiqi jamaat ki apni report mein nahein uthaya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeah kehh badhtey huey tashddud ko rokney ki garnatee ka elaan kiya jaye.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions the report emphasizes a **fouri tor say jehat kee tabdeeli** (urgent change in approach). It calls for a **nayi safarati aqdaam** (new diplomatic initiative) and a **khuli bahas** (open discussion) on Middle East policy.

However, the text *doesn't* mention guaranteeing the prevention of escalating violence. It focuses on changing the *approach* and initiating new diplomatic efforts, not on making a guarantee about stopping violence. Therefore, option A is the one *not* highlighted in the report.



"
"Police key hisaab sey, kisko Provenzano ka dayan haath waala aadmi samjha jaata thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""Police kaa kehna hay keh low picalo ko hee bartari haasil thee keunkeh woh palarmo mein pervenzano kaa daayan haath shumaar hota thaa..."" which translates to ""The police say that Lo Piccolo had the upper hand because he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...""
"
"Ebarat mein di gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Falcone ki maut ka sabab kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Usko saathi mafia jangaju Lo Piccolo ney qatal kar diya tha.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...mafia ke saleebi jewani falcon aur pawlo borcelino ko halaak karnay daawa kiya thiya"" which translates to ""...the mafia's war veteran Falcone and Paolo Borcelino were claimed to have been killed.""  It also explains that Lo Piccolo was Perenzano's right-hand man and respected for his experience in consolidating power and suppressing dissent.  Therefore, it's implied that Lo Piccolo was responsible for Falcone and Borcelino's deaths as part of consolidating Perenzano's control and settling scores in the mafia war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh Rina ki bhadkayi jang mein qatal kar diya gaya thaa:** The passage mentions a war between Rina and Perenzano, but it doesn't directly link Falcone's death to this war. While it's plausible, the text isn't explicit.
* **B: Usey police ney qatal diya tha:** The passage indicates that Lo Piccolo had authority and respect within the mafia, making it unlikely that the police were involved.
* **C: Lo Piccolo ko usey qatal karney ka hukum mila thaa:** The passage says Lo Piccolo *claimed* to have ordered the killings, it doesn't state that the police *ordered* him to do so.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Hitoshi Saito ki taarifein nahein hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Tamaam Japan key Judo Federation ka cCommittee chairman**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Hitoshi Saito *was* the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation training committee, not the *entire* federation's committee.  The wording is slightly off.
* The text *does* mention he was a two-time world champion (A).
* The text *does* mention he won two Olympic gold medals (C).
* The text implies he was a master of Judo (D).

Therefore, option B is the statement that is *not* supported by the provided text.
"
Iwasaki halaf leney sey kahaan bach sakaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepal**.

The question states that Iwasaki avoided marrying in Nepal, which implies that marrying there would have somehow protected him from the problems he faced. Therefore, Nepal is the correct location where he could have avoided those difficulties.
"
Kisney Iwasaki parr hamlah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek kutta**

The text states ""eek dabang kuttay nay tibbat mein uss parr hamlah kiya,"" which translates to ""a stray dog attacked him in Tibet.""
"
Alonso ney apni daud kabb khatam ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Schumacher key apni daud khatam karney key baad**.

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher nay apni rees aalonso key kuchh der baad hee khatam kar di..."" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher finished his race a little later than Alonso..."" This means Schumacher finished his race *after* Alonso. Therefore, Alonso's race ended after Schumacher's.
"
Kiss wajah sey Schumacher ney apni daud jaldi khatam kar di thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Fisichella ki wajah sey pahiyah ka noqsaan (Tire damage due to Fisichella)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Michael Schumacher nay apni rees aalonso key kuchh der baad hee khatam kar di, race key doraan mutaddid muqabilon mein **moattli key khasarah kee wajah say**."" This translates to ""Michael Schumacher ended his race shortly after Alonso, due to **tire damage during multiple collisions**.""  Fisichella is mentioned as the cause of this tire damage.

Option A is incorrect because the text says Schumacher lost control of his car, but it also clarifies the *reason* for the loss of control was the tire damage. Option B is incorrect as there's no mention of a collision with Alonso in the provided text. Option D is too vague; while the tires did suffer damage, the specific reason was the collisions.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, giraftaaron keliye zamaanat karana kiska kaam thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Adalat ka commissioner (Adalat ka commissioner)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Commissioner bill tartib deta hay agar manzoor hojaye aur giraftar kiye jaaney waale afsar kee jaanib say dayer kiye gaye elzamaat ko baqayedah shakal deta hay..."" This translates to: ""The Commissioner prepares the bill if approved and gives a formal shape to the charges filed by the arresting officer..."" This indicates the Commissioner is the one who formalizes the charges, which is a necessary step in the bail process. While the arresting officer files the initial charges, the Commissioner plays a role in making them official before bail can be considered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Giraftaar kaney waala afsar (Arresting officer):** The arresting officer files the charges, but isn't responsible for granting bail.
* **B: Judge Glynn:** Judge Glynn issued a temporary restraining order *against* the facility, not for granting bail.
* **C: Markazi book karney ki sohulat (Central booking facility):** The central booking facility tracks the cases, but doesn't grant bail.



"
"Ebarat mein mazkoor aarzia pabandi waaley hukum key hisaab sey, giraftaar shudgaan ko 24 ghanton sey ziyadah qaid mein rahney keliye keya rakhney ki ijaazat honaa zaruri hay?","The correct answer is **C: Judge Glynn ki taraf sey jaari kardah rasmi charge (Judge Glynn's issued formal charge)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Judge Glynn issued a temporary restraining order preventing the release of individuals detained for more than 24 hours *without* a hearing before a judicial commissioner.
* The passage also explains that the judicial commissioner issues a formal charge (""bill tartib deta hay agar manzoor hojaye aur giraftar kiye jaaney waale afsar kee jaanib se dayer kiye gaye elzamaat ko baqayedah shakal deta hay"").
* Therefore, the passage indicates that a formal charge from Judge Glynn is required to legally detain someone for more than 24 hours under the restraining order.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zamaanat (Bail):**  Bail is a *way to be released* after being arrested, not a requirement for being detained for more than 24 hours.
* **B: Giraftaar karney waley afsar sey mulaqaat (Meeting with the arresting officer):** Meeting with the arresting officer is not a legal requirement for a longer detention under this specific restraining order.
* **D: Samaat (Hearing):** While a hearing *is* ultimately required for a trial, the passage specifies that a hearing before a judicial commissioner is needed *before* someone is detained for more than 24 hours under the restraining order.  The formal charge is the mechanism that triggers that hearing.



"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, mansukh shudah runoff ki wazahat karne keliye kaun si wajah ka istemaal nahein hua tha?","The correct answer is **A: Salamati ke Khatraat (Security Threats)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the decision to cancel the runoff election was made to protect Afghans from the expenses and **security threats** of a second election.  Therefore, security threats *were* a stated reason.

The passage also mentions:

* **Dasturi ibhaam (Constitutional ambiguities):** The diplomats cited ambiguities in the Afghan constitution as a reason why a runoff election shouldn't happen.
* **Ziyada ikhrajaat (High expenses):** The passage mentions the expenses of a second election as a factor.

Therefore, the only reason *not* used to explain the cancellation of the runoff election, according to the text, is security threats.



"
Akhir kaar diplomats runoff ko gair zarury keon samajhte they?,"The correct answer is **C: Dastur mein ibhaam thaa** (There were ambiguities in the constitution).

The text explicitly states: ""Diplomats kaa kehna hay unn kee nazar mein afghan dastur mein itnay ibhamaat hain kehh run off election kee nobat nahein aayey gee."" (Diplomats say that in their view, there are so many ambiguities in the Afghan constitution that a runoff election will not occur.)

While the text mentions security concerns and the cost of the election, the primary reason diplomats considered a runoff unnecessary was the ambiguities within the constitution.
"
Faata keliye adalati khidmaat kon faraham karata hey?,"The correct answer is **B: Seyasi agents**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yeah agent hazraat pakistani qanoon key article number 247 key taht hukumati aur adalati khidmaat farahim karnay key zimme daar hain.""  This translates to ""These agents are responsible for providing governmental and judicial services under Pakistani law article number 247.""
"
Faata key “seyasi agents” key barey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sach nahi hey?,"The statement that is **not** true about the Fata ""political agents"" is:

**B: Pakistani sadar ney unka intekhab nahein kiya thaa** (The Pakistani President did not select them.)

Here's why:

The original statement explicitly says: ""Bartanvi raj say 1947 mein pakistan kee aazadi key baad say pakistani sadar nay faata kee hukmarani key liye """"seyasi agents"""" muqarrar kiye hain..."" This translates to: ""Since the British Raj and after Pakistan's independence in 1947, the Pakistani President has appointed 'political agents' for the administration of Fata...""  Therefore, the President *did* appoint them.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true:

* **A: Wohh adalati khidmaat faraham kartey hein** (They provide judicial services) -  The statement explicitly says they are responsible for providing governmental and judicial services under Pakistani law (article 247).
* **C: Wohh pakistan ke dastur ke paband they** (They were bound by the Pakistani constitution) - The statement mentions they operate under Pakistani law, implying adherence to the constitution.
* **D: Wohh makhsus elaqay mein mokammal control rakhte hein** (They maintain complete control in specific areas) -  The statement states they have ""almost complete autonomous control"" in all areas.



Therefore, **B** is the only false statement.
"
Kis award keyliye Emma Stone ko namzad kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Behtareen adakarah (Best Actress)**.

The text states ""Gosling aur stone bittarteeb behtareen adakaar aur adakarah keliye namzad hoay"" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone were nominated respectively for Best Actor and Best Actress.""
"
Iss film ko kon sey award ke liye namzad nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"सही उत्तर है: **B: Behtareen visual effects**

प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि फिल्म को बेहतरीन पिक्चर, बेहतरीन ओरिजिनल गाने और बेहतरीन साउंड मिक्सिंग के लिए नॉमिनेट किया गया था। बेहतरीन विजुअल इफेक्ट्स का उल्लेख कहीं नहीं है।
"
Darjahg zail mein sey konsa zalzalah ke baad eperation mein bacha rahh gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Isheeka kaa airport**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""Ashikawa mein nato hawai adday kaa elaqah bhee band hai."" This translates to ""The connection to the NATO airbase in Ashikawa is also closed."" While Ashikawa is mentioned, the question refers to a location specifically impacted by the earthquake.
* The text mentions ""Hokuriku kee Sheeka plant ke number 1 aur 2 reactor ko band karr diyaa gayaa hay"" - This indicates *only* two reactors were shut down, not all.
* The text says ""railway kee service mein bhee rukawat aayi hai"" - This isn't the *only* thing disrupted.
* The text mentions ""9400 makanon mein paani nahein hai"" and ""taqriban 100 gharoon mein bijli nahein hai,"" but these are impacts, not specific things that ""remained operational.""

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text as something that was closed or impacted after the earthquake is the Isheeka airport.



"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey konsey zalzalah ki wajah sey noqsan sey bach gaye they?","The correct answer is **A: kuchh makanaat (some houses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states:

* ""इस इलाके में 9400 मकानों में पानी नहीं है और तकरीबन 100 घरों में बिजली नहीं है।"" (In this area, 9400 houses have no water and approximately 100 houses have no electricity.)

This indicates that some houses were affected by the earthquake, while other things like the Sheeka plant, roads, and the airport were *not* necessarily spared. The passage focuses on the impact on houses, implying they weren't completely untouched.
"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, darjah zial konsa masalah dastavez mein shamil nahein hey?","The correct answer is **B: 1967 key jang ki wajah (The cause of the 1967 war)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the document refers to border tensions *based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War*. It mentions other issues *including* the future status of Jerusalem and the issue of the Jordan Valley.  However, it doesn't discuss the *cause* of the 1967 war.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Yarroshlam ka mustaqabil (The future of Jerusalem):** The passage directly mentions this as a key issue.
*   **C: waadi mein fauji maujoodgi (Military presence in the valley):** The passage details the differing durations of Israeli and Palestinian agreement on this.
*   **D: Sarhadon parr tanazo (Border tensions):** The passage states the document refers to border tensions and their need to be based on pre-1967 borders.



Therefore, the cause of the 1967 war is the only option not mentioned as a subject of the document."
Darjah zial mein sey konsa falastin ka motalebah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Jordan ki waadi mein jari fauji maujoodgi (Continuing military presence in the Jordan Valley)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what Palestine *doesn't* demand.** The passage states that Palestine *does* demand borders based on the 1967 pre-war lines, the future of Jerusalem being respectful to both sides, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
* **The passage explicitly mentions Israel's demand for a 10-year military presence in the Jordan Valley after a peace agreement.**  The passage also mentions Palestine's agreement to a 5-year presence. Therefore, Palestine is *not* demanding a continued, long-term military presence.
* Options A, C, and D are all explicitly mentioned as part of Palestine's demands in the passage.



"
Maa ney kiss mulk mein qanoon ki padhayee ki thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Amerika**.

The text states: ""Hong kong mein paida honey waale maa nay new york university aur harward key school baraye qanoon mein taleem haasil kee..."" This directly indicates the mother studied law at New York University and Harvard, both located in the **United States (Amerika)**.
"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, Maa ki intekhabi jeet mein kiss mulk keliye wakalat moavin bani thee?","The correct answer is **D: Cheen (China)**.

The passage states: ""maa nay asl cheeni sarzamin key saath qareebi talluqat kee wakalat karnay waale eek plate form parr aasani say kamiyabi haasil kee.""  This translates to ""She easily achieved success on a platform that handled legal matters with close ties to the original Chinese homeland.""
"
"Ebarat ke bayaniyah key motabiq, Carolyn Wilson ney shahar chorney se pahle kiss keyliye kaam kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states that ""kerolun walasan nay unn key scurity deposit chori karr liye hain... aur shehar chhod karr faraar ho gayaa hay."" and later mentions ""OHA police bhee ockland mein doosri awami housing jayedadon kee tafshish karr rahee hain"". This implies that Kerolun Walasan is associated with OHA (Office of Housing and Community Development).
"
Season ki baqi chaar race key saath Drivers Championship key chauthey maqaam parr kon thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

The passage states: ""Teesre mein, hemlin bees points peeche hay, magar boyar kahnay say paanch points aagay hay..."" which translates to ""In third place, Hamlin is twenty points behind, but Bowyer is five points ahead..."" This means Bowyer was in third place, and since Hamlin was behind him, Bowyer was ahead of Hamlin. Therefore, Bowyer was in fourth place.
"
"Ebarat mein mazkoor race key baad, drivers championship Kahne ke pass kitney points hein?","The correct answer is **C: 2243**.

The passage states: ""Saat points key saath pichadte hoay, 2,243 key saath johnson dosray number parr hay."" This means Johnson has 2243 points. The question asks about the points after the race, implying the current standings are relevant.
"
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, keitni baar logon ney girtey hue shahaabe saqib ka moshahidah kiya hay jinkaa baad mein mirrikhi ulasal honaa sabit huey?","The correct answer is **B: Paach baar**.

The passage states: ""Yeah tareekh kaa panchwan baar samjha jaataa hay kehh logon nay qamri aur mirrikhi mawaad ko zameen parr girtay hoay dekha..."" which translates to ""Yeah, it is said for the fifth time that people have seen lunar and meteor material falling to earth...""

The question asks how many times people have witnessed falling meteorites that were later confirmed to be of meteoritic origin. The passage confirms this has happened five times.
"
"Jaisa ke ebarat mein mazkoor hey, sachh mein konsey patrhar hein jinka mirrikhi ul asal hona paya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Unmein sey 34 they**.

The passage states: ""Zameen parr girnay waale taqriban 24,000 malum shahaabe saqib mein say sirf 34 key mirrikhi ulasal honey kee tasdiq hoyee hay.""  This directly answers the question about which rocks were confirmed to be meteoritic.
"
Shomakar kab retired hue they ?,"The correct answer is **B: Apni satvein championship ki jeet key baad**.

The provided text states: ""Shomakar, jo saatviin championship jeetnay key baad 2006 mein retired hoay..."" which translates to ""Shomakar, who retired in 2006 after winning his seventh championship...""

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
"
Massa kab zakhmi hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Farmulah 1 champion ship jeetnay key baad**

The text states: ""Shomakar, jo saat baar farmulah 1 champion ship jeetnay key baad 2006 mein retired hoay, woh zakhmi felip maasa kee jagah leenay waale they."" This indicates Felipe Massa was injured *after* Schumacher won the championship seven times.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, nazmo nasq kaisey AOL ko motassir karega?","The correct answer is **C: AOL ke sarifeen ki tadaad ko Yahoo aur Microsoft key sarifeen ki hareef hogi.**

Here's why:

The original statement says that the use of major agreements in the United States has helped AOL grow the IM market and develop it. However, it also warns that the existence of these agreements *could* end freedom (presumably referring to AOL's dominance).  The statement then highlights that the combined user base of Yahoo and Microsoft will be significantly larger than AOL's.

Therefore, the most logical consequence presented in the options is that AOL's user base will be challenged and potentially become *competitive* with Yahoo and Microsoft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL key sarifeen ki tadaad mumkinah taur parr barhh jaye gi (AOL's user base will likely increase):**  The text implies a *threat* to AOL's position, not necessarily growth.
* **B: AOL IM bazaar mein tanha taraqqi yaftah company hogi (AOL will be the only developing company in the IM market):** The text specifically points out the increasing size of Yahoo and Microsoft.
* **D: AOL Amrika mein abb mazeed istemaal nahein hogi (AOL will no longer be used in America):**  The text is about competition, not extinction. It suggests a struggle for market share.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon naye nazmo nasq key baad khatm ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: AOL ki apne maqam parr bazaar ko taraqqi deney ki aazadi**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that the use of major agreements in the United States has allowed AOL to successfully develop and advance the internet market. However, it warns that **with this system, freedom could end.** The freedom being referred to is AOL's ability to develop the market as it sees fit.  The paragraph implies that the arrival of large players like Yahoo and Microsoft could limit AOL's freedom to innovate and grow independently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amerika mein internet key wase failao ki taraqqi (The development of internet spread in America):**  The paragraph sees this as a positive outcome due to AOL's role. It doesn't suggest this will end.
*   **B: IM bazaar ka istemaal (The use of the IM market):** The paragraph implies AOL has been successful *using* the IM market, not that its use is at risk.
*   **D: Yahoo aur microsoft ki aazadi (The freedom of Yahoo and Microsoft):** The paragraph doesn't discuss the freedom of these companies; it focuses on the potential impact they have *on* AOL's freedom.



"
Hamlah mein mare gaye kitney log police officer nahein they?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

Here's why:

* The question asks how many people killed in the attack were *not* police officers.
* The text states that two police officers were killed.
* It also states that 19 of the injured were police officers.
* The question doesn't give information about the total number of people killed. Therefore we can only answer by saying that if 2 police officers were killed, and the question is asking about those who were *not* police officers, then the answer must be 2.
"
Hamlah mein mashkook mulzim ki kisney report ki thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Police**.

The text states: ""Police ne kahaa kehh unn kaa shakk hay kehh iss hamlay kaa zimah daar daesh (ISIL) kaa mubbayyanah dehshatgird hay."" (Police said that they suspect that the perpetrator of this attack is a well-known terrorist of ISIS.) This indicates the police are the ones who are investigating and suspecting ISIS.  Therefore, the police are reporting on the suspect.
"
Florida ki jitne waley ki tamaam riyasat hay ki haysiyat ki wajah se Mitt Romney ko kiysa award diya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Riyasat key tamaam mandoobeen**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Choonkeh fateh ko tamaam riyasaton say muntakhab kiya jaataa hay..."" which translates to ""Because the winner is elected from all states...""
* Mitt Romney received 32% of the vote, placing him in second place. The passage doesn't mention him receiving any specific award related to that percentage.
* The key factor is that the winner of the Florida primary gets all 50 delegates from Florida. This makes Florida a significant victory, propelling DeSantis to frontrunner status.

Therefore, Mitt Romney was not awarded anything based on his vote percentage. He simply finished second in the primary. The importance of the Florida primary lies in the fact that its delegates are awarded to the winner, contributing to the overall delegate count for each candidate. The statement about Romney receiving a reward because of the state's delegates is implied by the passage's emphasis on the importance of Florida's electoral process."
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, kitnaa feesad vote Gingrich ko buniyaadi intekhab mein mley they?","The correct answer is **B: 32 feesad**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ameriki aiwane numaindgaan key saabiq speaker newt gangrech 32 feesad key saath dosray maqaam parr rahay."" This translates to ""Former Speaker of the US House of Representatives Newt Gingrich remained in second place with 32 percent of the vote.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab se, kaakas ke natayej ke baad kisney chalanaa jari nahein rakha thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""August mein aims straw poll jeetnay waali, **beak man** nay, apni muhim key ikhtetam kaa faislah kar lia."" (Bachmann, who won the AIMS straw poll in August, decided to end her campaign.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Gingrich:** The text says ""Natijay aaney key baad gunrich nay centorum kee tareef kee..."" (After the results, Gingrich praised Centurym). He continued to be involved.
* **Perry:** The text says ""Peeri nay kahaa kehh """"aaj raat kee seyasi mulaqat key nataij kaa jaizah lenay key liye mein taxas wapas aawunga kehh aaya meray liye iss muqabilay mein aagay kee rah hay""""..."" (Perri said, ""I'll come back to Texas to review the results of tonight's political meeting, because I see a path forward for me in this race""). He planned to continue.
* **Romney:** The text says ""... lekin **romani** keliye gunrich key khelaaf lava mein manfi ishtehaar keliye tanqeed kee."" (...but Romney was criticized for negative ads against Gingrich.) The text implies Romney continued to be a contender, even if he faced criticism.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney kaakas ka natijah aane key baad eek deegar ummidwar key bary mein ziyadah baat ki thee?","The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The text states: ""Natijay aaney key baad gunrich nay centorum kee tareef kee, lekin romani keliye gunrich key khelaaf lava mein manfi ishtehaar keliye tanqeed kee."" This indicates that Newt Gingrich (Gunrich) was criticized for running negative ads against Romney.  While Gingrich praised Centurium, the focus is on the criticism *regarding* his campaign against Romney.

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
Konsi wo tanha jagah hay jahaan 2015 sey pahley show ko dikhaya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The text explicitly states: ""Apnay awail dinon mein yeah show sirf der tak chalnay waali internet radio site **toginet radio** parr dikhaya gayaa..."" (In its early days, the show was only broadcast on the late-night internet radio site TogiNet Radio...).  This means TogiNet Radio was the only place it was shown before 2015.
"
Station show ki iss tor parr wazahat karta hay ke usmein kis qism ka ghumao hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Shauqiyah**.

The text explicitly states: ""Uss show mein asl mein shoqia aawaz key adakaar pesh keeye gaye..."" which translates to ""In that show, in fact, amateur voice actors were presented...""  ""Shauqiyah"" means amateur or hobbyist in Urdu/Hindi.

While the show is also described as ""awami"" (community-oriented) and ""puraani"" (old), the *type* of performance is amateur/hobbyist. ""Maqami"" (local) refers to the origin of the actors, not the quality of the performance.
"
David Headley ney kiya ekattha kiya thaa ke usse bilaakhir jangju jamaat key hamlah mein moawanat hui thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Automatic Aslahe**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...woh apnay saath **grenade, automatic aslaha** laaye they...""  This means David Headley brought automatic weapons with him. While he also brought grenades, automatic weapons are a more significant and relevant element when considering the scale and nature of the attack, and the fact that he coordinated with Lashkar-e-Taiba.

The question asks what he gathered to aid in the Jamaat-ud-Dawa attack.  The passage explicitly mentions automatic weapons as something he brought. The other options are mentioned as well, but automatic weapons are a more crucial detail in the context of planning and executing a large-scale attack.

Therefore, while not the *only* thing he gathered, **Automatic Aslahe** is the best answer based on the provided text."
konsa amado raft ka zariyah jnagju jmaat ne Mumbai pahunchne mein istemaal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Kashti (Ship)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mumbai parr hamlah karnay waale eek kashti say 26 nomber 2008 ko aayey they."" which translates to ""The attackers who attacked Mumbai arrived on November 26, 2008, by a ship.""
"
Konsa bayaniyah durrust tor parr ebarat mein mazkoor naadal aur Raonic ke brusbin opne match key natijah ki akkasi karta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic ney Nadaal ko haraa diya**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""Hall hee mein woh rawank key khelaaf brusbin open mein haar gayaa."" This translates to ""Recently, he lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raonic ko net 88% points miley:**  The text mentions Nadal achieved 88% net points *in a match he won*, not Raonic.
* **C: Nadaal ney Raonic ko haraa diya:** The text says Nadal *lost* to Raonic.
* **D: Raonic ney 76 points score kiye:** The text mentions Nadal achieved 76 points in a win, but doesn't say Raonic scored 76 points in that specific match.

"Ebarat ke hisaab se, nadaal aur raonic ki pahle serve key baad kia position thee?","The correct answer is **B: Nadaal ney 76 points haasil kiye**.

The text states: ""Pehli baari mein 76 points say jeetnay waale match mein nadaal nay %88 net points haasil kiye."" This translates to ""In the first set, Nadal won by 76 points and achieved 88% net points.""

While option C is true (the score was 7-2), the question asks about Nadal's position *after* the first serve. Option B directly addresses Nadal's point score in the first set. Options A, C, and D are not directly related to Nadal's position after the first serve.
"
Naked News ki teen nayi nashriyaat mein konsi zubaan ka programme shaamil nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Atalwai**.

Here's why:

The question asks which language is *not* included in Naked News' new publications. The passage explicitly mentions Spanish, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and English.  ""Atalwai"" is not mentioned."
"Ebarat ke hisaab sey, naked news ki nayi nashriyaat kahan dastiyaab nahi hongee?","The correct answer is **C: Theaters**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Naked News is launching programs for:

*   Television
*   Web
*   Mobile devices

The question asks where the new publications *won't* be available. The passage doesn't mention theaters at all, implying they won't be a platform for Naked News' new content. Internet is implied by ""Web"" and mobile devices are explicitly mentioned. Television is explicitly mentioned."
Kitney Moqabilaa karney walon ney jaaint salalom ko mokammal nahein kiya?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""jaaint salalom mein majmuyi 117 mein say 45 scares uss muqabilah mean koyee bhee darjah haasil karnay say qaasir rahay."" This translates to: ""In the winning slalom, out of a total of 117 competitors, 45 failed to achieve any rank."" Therefore, 45 competitors did not complete the slalom to achieve a rank.
"
Konsey darjah zail bayaniye durust tor parr championship mein daud key natayej ki akkasi kartey hein?,"The correct answer is **B: 45 scares ney jaaint salalom mein apni daudein mokammal nahein ki thee.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""jaaint salalom mein majmuyi 117 mein say 45 scares uss muqabilah mean koyee bhee darjah haasil karnay say qaasir rahay.""  This directly translates to ""In the giant slalom, 45 skiers failed to achieve any rank.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Doosri daud mein, carpenado ney Hungry ki taraf sey eek scare sey pahle mokammal kiya thaa:**  The passage says Carpenado's time was *slower* than the Australian skier, and *slower* than the Hungarian skier.  It doesn't say she was faster than the Hungarian skier by one skier.
* **C: Salalom key moqabile mein ziyadah scares ney jaaint salalo mokammal kiya thaa:** The passage explicitly says that *45* skiers failed to complete the giant slalom.  This implies *less* than half completed it.
* **D: Carpenado ney salalom mein daswan mokammal kar liyaa:** The passage states Carpenado finished in 10th place in the *first* slalom. It doesn't say anything about her finishing in 10th place in the giant slalom.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsa NBA ney moattal karney ka faisla kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Basketball season**.

The passage states: ""Budh ko united states national basket ball issosiission (NBA) nay COVID-19 key hawalay say tafakkuraat kee benaa parr apna peshah waranah season muattal kardiya."" This translates to: ""On Wednesday, the United States National Basketball Association (NBA) suspended its professional season based on considerations regarding COVID-19.""

Therefore, the NBA suspended the basketball season.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, virus key baare mein NBA ki tashwishaat kaa baes kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Utah Jazz khel mein motaddid kheladi jaanch mein musbat paye gaye they.**

The passage states: ""NBA nay COVID-19 key hawalay say tafakkuraat kee benaa parr apna peshah waranah season muattal kardiya. NBA key iss faislay key baad yutah key jaaz kheladi kee covid-19 wires jaanch musbat payee gayee hay.""

While it mentions a Utah Jazz player testing positive, it also implies that multiple players were involved, leading to the suspension. Option B directly reflects this broader situation. The other options are too specific and don't capture the reason for the NBA's broader concern and decision.
"
Khel mein Atlanta Thrashers key khilaaf Washington Capitals key liye khel ki jeet kaa goal kisney score kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Raat mein uss kaa doosra goal, season kaa uss kaa 60van goal thaa, jis say woh pehla kheladi bann gayaa jis nay 1995-96 say eek season mean 60 yaa zayed goal kiye...""  This refers to Nicklas Backstrom scoring the first goal for Washington.
"
Capitals bamoqabilah Thrashers game key dauraan season ka apna 60vaan goal kiss ney score kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**. 

The text states: ""Raat mein uss kaa doosra goal, season kaa uss kaa 60van goal thaa..."". This clearly indicates that Alex Ovechkin scored the 60th goal of the season against the Thrashers.
"
Northern Rock bank ko kabb hukumat sey himaayat drkaar thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Rahan key bohraan key dauraan**.

The passage states: ""2007 key doraan sab prime qarzah jaati bohraan say saamna honey kee benaa parr northern rock ko himayat kee zaroorat thee."" (During the 2007 crisis of rising prime mortgages, Northern Rock needed support.)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsey darjah zail bayaniye durust tor parr Warjan group ki Northern Rock bank key saath saudah baziyon ki wazahat kartey hein?","The correct answer is **D: Warjan group ney bank key liye pahli boli bank key qomi milkiyat mein aaney key baad lagayi gayi thee.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sir Richard Branson key Virgin Group nay bank ko qomi milkiyat qaraar deenay say qabal mustaridah bank keliye boli lagayi thi."" (Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group had placed a bid for the troubled bank before it was nationalized.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Warjan group ney bhee Northern Rock ki asset management company kharidee thee:** The passage says Virgin Group only bought the ""good bank"" (the retail banking arm), not the asset management company.
* **B: Warjan group ney bank ko uskey qomi milkiyat mein aane key baad kharid liyaa thaa:** The passage says they placed a bid *before* nationalization.
* **C: Warjan group ney bank ko rahan key bohraan key baad fauri himaayat ki peshkash ki thee:** While they offered support after the crisis, the passage emphasizes they made a bid *before* the full crisis erupted and nationalization.

Therefore, option D accurately reflects the information presented in the passage."
"Jaisa kehh ebarat mein bayan kiya gaya hay, konsa mulk Kyoto key mahaul moahedah parr dastakhat karney sey motassir hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Australia**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Australia kee saabiq conservatives hukumat nay cuto misaq parr dastakhat karnay say inkaar kiya thaa..."" which translates to ""The former conservative government of Australia refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Amerika (America):** The passage doesn't mention the US.
*   **Hindustan (India):** The passage says India wasn't adhering to gas emission limits, but it doesn't mention India's decision regarding the Kyoto Protocol.
*   **Cheen (China):** Similar to India, the passage mentions China's lack of adherence to emission limits but not China's stance on the Kyoto Protocol.



"
Australia ki sabiqah hukumat ka khiyaal tha kehh Kyoto ki tausique kiss cheez ko noqsaan pahunchaaney kaa sabab hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Mulk ki maeeshat (Country's economy)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Australia kee saabiq conservatives hukumat nay cuto misaq parr dastakhat karnay say inkaar kiya thaa iss benaa par kehh yeah uss key iqtesad key liye muzir hoga..."" (Australia's former conservative government refused to sign the protocol on the grounds that it would be harmful to its economy...).
"
Konsa programme trial mein shooter thaa jiskey liye bharti ki gayie thee?,"The correct answer is **D: Hunting programme ka sporting shooters issosiission**.

The text states: ""NPWS aur Sporting Shooters Issosiission of Australia (NSW) ink kee shirakat mein ahal razakaron o sporting shooters issosiission key hunting programme key taht bharti kiyaa gayaa thaa."" This translates to ""Qualified volunteers were recruited under the hunting program of the NPWS and Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.""
"
konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr keeday control trial ki akkasi karta hey?,"The correct answer is **B: Shooters ney tarbiyat ki hidayat wosul ki gayee thee.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""pehle nishanah baazi key liye muntakhab kardah chaar nishanay baazon nay jaamaa hifazati aur tarbiyati hidayaat wasool keen."" (Four shooters selected for target shooting received safety and training guidance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chunkehh yehh program ka pahlaa trial thaa, isliye iskee qadr paimayee nahein kee gayee thee (Since this was the first trial of the program, its value was not measured):** The text doesn't state that the program wasn't measured; it states that the trial was the *first*.  It implies measurement *will* happen.
* **C: Shooters rengeron sey hairaan they (Shooters were surprised by the results):** The text doesn't mention any surprise. It focuses on the safety and training provided.
* **D: Chaar shooters muntakhab nahein kiye gaye they (Four shooters were not selected):** The text clearly states that four shooters *were* selected.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tafreeq kahan milli thee?","The correct answer is **A: Rift waadi mein**.

The text specifically states: ""Iss kaa matlab yeah hay kehh yeah shagaaf salmati shahadat kee jaanib say qayaas kiye gaye waqat say kahein pehle hay. Iss kaa matlab yeah hay kehh harr cheez ko wapas rakhna laazim hay, yeah etheopia mein **rift veeli research service parr eek mohqqaq**...""

This translates to: ""This gap is earlier than the time estimated from the safety of martyrdom. This means that everything must be put back, this is a researcher in the Rift Valley research service in Ethiopia...""

Therefore, the difference (or research) took place in the Rift Valley.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi cheez tawaqqo sey pahley waqey hui thee?","The correct answer is **C: Salmaati shahadat ka tajziyah (Analysis of the sanctity of martyrdom)**.

The passage states: ""Iss kaa matlab yeah hay kehh yeah shagaaf salmati shahadat kee jaanib say qayaas kiye gaye waqat say kahein pehle hay."" which translates to ""This means that this gap existed before the time estimated from the sanctity of martyrdom.""  So, the sanctity of martyrdom analysis happened *before* the gap.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fossil ki daryaft (Discovery of fossils):** The passage doesn't mention fossil discoveries.
* **B: Tafreeque (Division):** The passage doesn't explicitly state that division happened before the sanctity of martyrdom analysis.
* **D: Rift waadi mein tahqique (Research in the Rift Valley):** The passage mentions research in the Rift Valley, but it's not directly stated that the research happened before the sanctity of martyrdom analysis. It's implied that the research led to the conclusion about the timing of the gap.



"
Video game key dauran eek kheladi ko harakaat key jod tod key liye kiss cheez ki darkaar hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Controller ko hwa mein hilayein (Shake the controller)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Iss say game khelnay waale iss qaabil ho jayein gay kehh device ko hawa mein hilla karr video games key afaal wo harkat ko control karr sakein."" This translates to: ""This way, players will be able to control video game actions and movements by shaking the device in the air.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yaqinee banayein kehh controller key sensor ko console key qareeb position dee gayee hay (Ensure the controller's sensor is positioned close to the console):** While proximity is important for the sensors to work, the passage highlights *shaking* the controller as the primary control method.
* **B: Unki position ko tikoni banayein (Position them in a triangular shape):** There's no mention of a specific shape for the controller's positioning.
* **C: Unki television key qareeb sensor ko rakhein (Keep the sensor near the television):** The passage talks about the controller's sensors, not the television's.

Therefore, shaking the controller is the crucial action for controlling movements during gameplay.
"
Kisi television key remote key moshabah honay key liye kiss cheez ko design kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Controller key do sensors**.

The passage states that the controller was designed to resemble a television remote by using two sensors to keep it in a ""shah rukhi"" (likely meaning a convenient or player-friendly) position near the television. This is achieved through the use of the two sensors.
"
Xinhua khabar rasaan agency sey tazah tareen report mein kiya bayan nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Chiyarah ko eek bomb ka kharah lahique hogya thaa** (Chiyarah was threatened with a bomb).

Here's why:

The passage states that there was a *threat* of a bomb on the plane *in Mosul*, but it doesn't say the plane was actually threatened with a bomb in Ürümqi or anywhere else. The passage explicitly mentions the threat in Mosul and the plane being redirected to Afghanistan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Chiyarah Ürümqi mein lend kiya thaa** (Chiyarah was lent in Ürümqi): The passage states the plane was redirected *after* emergency lending was not authorized in Ürümqi, not that it was lent there.
*   **C: Chiyarah Afghanistan key liye mod diya gya thaa** (Chiyarah was sent back to Afghanistan): This is true, but the question asks what was *not* mentioned.
*   **D: Chiyarah Kandahar mein lend kiya thaa** (Chiyarah was lent in Kandahar): The passage states the plane landed in Kandahar, but it doesn't say it was *lent* there."
Xinhua ki nayi agency ki sabsey pahli report mein kiya bayan nahein kiya gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Chiyarah hijack karr liya gaya thaa**.

The question asks what the *initial* report from Xinhua *didn't* say. The text states: ""Ibtadayi report mein kahaa gayaa hay kehh yurumaqi mein hangami lending kee ejazat nah diye jaaney key baad hawai jahaaz ko wapas afghanistan kee taraf mod diyaa gayaa thaa."" This means the initial report *did* say the plane was turned back to Afghanistan, but it *didn't* say it was hijacked. Options B, C, and D are all mentioned in the text as details that emerged later.
"
Radio program key dauraan Sara Danius ney kia elaan kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Adab mein Nobel Prize jeentney walaa**.

The passage states: ""Nobel committee baraye adab kee mustaqil secretry Saara Danius nay peer ko swedish academy mein seerjees radio, sudan parr munaqid eek radio programme key doraan awami satah parr yeah elaan kiya kehh nobel enaam baraye adab 2016 jeetnay waale baab dylan tak braah raast rasayi haasil nah karr paaney kee wajah say committee nay unn tak pahunchnay kee koshish tark karr di."" This translates to: ""The independent secretary for literature, Saara Danius, during a radio program on BBC Radio, Sudan, announced to the public that the Nobel Prize for Literature 2016 winner, Bob Dylan, could not be reached directly by the committee...""

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
Kiss tak pahuncha nahein jaa sakta?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The text explicitly states: ""committee nay unn tak pahunchnay kee koshish tark karr di"" which translates to ""the committee has abandoned its attempt to reach him.""  The ""him"" refers to Bob Dylan, the winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature.

While Sara Danius is mentioned as the secretary, the sentence focuses on the committee's inability to reach *Bob Dylan*. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because:

*   **A: Bob Dylan key qareebi shreek kaar** -  It is the *committee* that has contacted his closest collaborator.
*   **B: Sara Danius** - Sara Danius is the secretary of the Swedish Academy and is *trying* to reach Dylan.
*   **C: Swedish Academy** - The Swedish Academy is the organization presenting the Nobel Prize, not the person being unreachable.



"
kiss ney ahad parr “eek bada qadam” honey ka tabserah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Gordon Johndroe**.

The question states that ""Bush key tarjuman garden john daroye nay"" (Bush's translator John Darrow) described it as a ""badaa qadam"" (big step). Gordon John Darrow was the White House Press Secretary during George W. Bush's presidency. Therefore, he is the one who interpreted the statement as a ""big step.""
"
Słania ney motaddid mamalik key liye kitni mahrein banayi thee?,"The correct answer is **B: 1000**.

The text explicitly states: ""Unhon nay sweaden aur deegar 28 mamalik keliye **1000 stamp** tayyaar kiye."" (He prepared 1000 stamps for Sweden and other 28 countries.)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tanki key vents sey mumkinah tor mosalsal rasao ki wajah kiya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Thermal tausee (Thermal expansion)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the vents were releasing gas likely due to a buildup of vapor in the tank.** This vapor buildup is a result of the oil expanding due to heat.  This expansion is **thermal expansion**.
* **Thermal Expansion** is the increase in volume of a substance due to an increase in temperature.  In this case, the oil in the tank warmed up, expanding and creating pressure.  The vents allowed this excess pressure to escape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sanavi bharayi kaa raqbah salahiyat tak bhara ja rahaa hay (The second filling area is being filled to capacity):** While the second tank isn't full, the passage doesn't directly link this to the venting.  The venting is about pressure buildup, not filling.
* **B: Aag key Hukm key system ki eek mamool ki jaanch (A routine check of the fire control system):**  The passage doesn't mention a fire control system check.
* **D: Fort Greely key eek pump station mein aag (A fire at a pump station in Fort Greely):** The passage doesn't mention a fire at Fort Greely.



"
Rahat darichey kiyon khul gaye they?,"The correct answer is **A: Tankiyon key andar thermal tausee hui thee (Thermal expansion had occurred inside the tanks)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Budh kee sah pahar key waqat kaa hall yeah hay kehh tanki key vents say rasao jaari thaa aur ghaliban uss kaa sabab tanki mean bahut ziyadah bhaap kaa jamao thaa."" This translates to: ""The situation as of Wednesday morning is that venting was continuing from the tank vents and most likely the cause was a large buildup of vapor in the tanks.""

Vapor buildup is a result of thermal expansion, meaning the oil was heating up and expanding, creating pressure that needed to be relieved through the vents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: System ki jaanch key baad power ki nakaami hui thee (Power failure occurred after system inspection):** The text doesn't mention a power failure.
* **C: Tankiyaan mokammal salahiyat mein theen (The tanks were at full capacity):** The text says the second filling area wasn't full, implying the tanks weren't at full capacity.
* **D: Sananvi bharao ka raqbah kaafi barrel ka haamil nahein ho saka (The second filling area wasn't able to hold enough barrels):** While this is a fact stated in the text, it doesn't explain *why* the venting was occurring. It's a consequence of the situation, not the cause.



"
Filhaal nawwein ward mein paani kitna ooncha hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Kamar ki oonchayi** (Waist height).

The passage states: ""us waqt kamar tak oonche paani mean hay keunkeh nazdiki band satah say buland thaa."" which translates to ""at that time the water was waist-high because it was higher than the nearby paved surface.""
"
"Katrina toofan key doraan, nawein ward mein kiya hua thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Kamar tak ooncha paani satah sey ooper hogaya thaa**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Us waqt kamar tak oonche paani mean hay keunkeh nazdiki band satah say buland thaa."" which translates to ""At that time, the water was knee-high because it was higher than the nearby paved surface.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sailaab ka paani 100 fit choudaa tha** - While it mentions water spreading 100 feet wide, it doesn't specify the height.
* **C: Sailaab ka paani 20 fit ooncha thaa** - The passage says the water was *knee-high*, not 20 feet.
* **D: 6 inch baarish sey kharaab satah ki khilaaf warzi hui thee** -  The passage mentions that 6 inches of rain *could* cause pipe bursts, but it doesn't say it *did* in this specific instance. The main point is the water level in the neighborhood.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiskee Hammelton nay tasdiq nahein ki thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Jahaan mareez ney safar kiya thaa (Where the patient traveled)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Hammelton *did* confirm that Howard University Hospital admitted the patient in good condition and followed protocol to control infection. However, the passage *doesn't* say he confirmed *where* the patient had traveled. The passage mentions the patient's history in Nigeria, but Hammelton's confirmation focused on the hospital's actions and the patient's condition upon arrival.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Deegar mareez key virus sey moahidaah kaa imkaan (The possibility of infection from other patients):** The passage explicitly states the hospital followed a protocol to prevent this.
* **C: Aaya Sahee protocol ki pairawee ki gayi thee (That the correct protocol was followed):**  The passage states the hospital *did* follow protocol.
* **D: Mareez ki mojudah soorate haal (The patient's current condition):** The passage states the patient was admitted in good condition.



Therefore, the only thing Hammelton didn't confirm, according to the passage, is the location where the patient had traveled.



"
Kuchh aisee cheez kiya hay saiencedaan jiskee khakah bnana chahtey hein?,"The best answer is **B: Protein kee tashkeel kaisey hoti hay**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a scenario where a powerful star impacting Earth could deliver nutrients to the surface, potentially leading to the formation of proteins and life.** This directly relates to the question of how proteins are formed.  The passage is essentially posing a question about the *mechanism* of how life could arise under such circumstances.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Jabb damdaar Sitaraah Zameen key saath takraya thaa (When a powerful star collided with Earth):** While the passage mentions this event, it's not the core question of what scientists want to *understand* about it. It's a *description* of the scenario, not the scientific inquiry.
* **C: Jo namiyaati masalah hay (The nutritional problem):**  The passage doesn't focus on a general ""nutritional problem."" It's about the potential *source* of nutrients and how they could lead to life.
* **D: Zameen ki tashkeel kaisey hui hay (How the Earth was formed):**  The passage doesn't specifically discuss the Earth's formation. It focuses on a specific impact event and its potential consequences.



Therefore, the question about how proteins are formed is the most logically connected to the passage's central idea.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bandish mein maqami police ney kiya kirdaar anjaam diyaa thaa?","The correct answer is **B: Unhon ney bandish karney key liye faisalah kiya thaa** (They made the decision to impose the blockade).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""meeri land transporation atharti nay FBI key dabao key baes usay band kardiya."" This indicates that while the FBI put pressure on them, the local police ultimately *decided* to impose the blockade. The phrasing suggests a decision was made *by* the local police to block the transportation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unhon ney FBI parr bandish key liye dabao banaya thaa** (They put pressure on the FBI to impose the blockade): This is the opposite of what the passage says. The FBI pressured *them*.
* **C: Unhon ney deegar raston ki taraf rahnumayi ki thee** (They guided towards other routes): This describes one of the *actions* taken as part of the blockade, but it doesn't define the police's *decision*.
* **D: Unhon ney motabadil rastah mein traffic takhiraat ki report ki thee** (They reported traffic delays on alternate routes):  This is also a description of an *action*, not the underlying *decision*.



"
Bandish key doraan tube key daakhli raaston key saath kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Unhein block kar diya gaya thaa**

The text explicitly states: ""Tube key daakhli raaston ko block karnay keliye bharay hoay turkon kaa istemaal kiya gayaa thaa..."" (The filled Turks were used to block the tube's entrances...).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, photographer key gaadi sey takraaney sey pahley kia nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Photographer ney eek police stop ki tasaaveer lee thee**.

The text explicitly states: ""TMZ kaa manna hay kehh photo grapher nay supploveda balwaar kee doosri jaanib apni gaadi ko khadaa kiya aur sadak paar karnay aur aagay badhnay say pehle uss nay police stop kee picture lenay kee koshish kee."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Photographer ko Highway Patrol ki jaanib sey sadak parr waapass jaaney kaa hukum diya gaya thaa:** This *did* happen, according to the text.
* **B: Photographer ney apni gaadi photographer parr park ki thee:** The text says the photographer parked their car on the *other side* of the boulevard.
* **D: Potographer Bieber ki tasweer leney kaa ahal thaa:** The text mentions Justin Bieber but doesn't say the photographer was authorized to take his picture. The photographer was taking pictures of the accident scene.



"
Photographer gaadi sey takkar khaaney sey pahley kiya karney ki koshish karr rahaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek police stop ki tasaweer lenaa**.

The text explicitly states: ""TMZ kaa manna hay kehh photo grapher nay supploveda balwaar kee doosri jaanib apni gaadi ko khadaa kiya aur sadak paar karnay aur aagay badhnay say pehle uss nay police stop kee picture lenay kee koshish kee.""
"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor par virus key liye jaanch mein musbat honey key baad ki sadar ki halat ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wo mustahkam halat mein they**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sadar jamhuria kee haalat mustahkam hay, uss key bawajood woh kayee dinon tak ghar parr alag thalag rahein gay."" This translates to ""The situation of the President's Republic is stable, despite that he will remain isolated at home for several days.""

The question asks which statement *doesn't* align with the President's condition *after* a positive virus test. The passage details:

*   **Bukhaar aur kharab gulla:** Fever and a bad throat (indicating illness).
*   **Telly commuting key zariye apna kam jaari rakh sakoon:**  He's trying to continue working through remote commuting.
*   **Unhein acchaa mahsoos nahein hota hay:** He doesn't feel well.
*   **Unhein galey ki sozish thee:** He had a sore throat.
*   **""mein peer key roz apni tamaam deutiyon parr wapas lotnay kee twaqqo karta hoon"":** He intends to return to his duties within a few days.

Therefore, while the Republic's situation is stable, the President himself is *not* in a stable physical state. He is sick, as indicated by fever and sore throat. Options A, B, and D all align with the President's condition as described. Option C, stating that he *is* in stable condition, contradicts the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sadar key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sach hay?","The correct answer is **C: Wohh itnaa accha hay kehh mowasilaati kaam kar sakta hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""bukhaar aur kharab gulla honey key elawah, main khud ko achhi aur behatar haalat mein mahsus karraha hon kehh telly commuting key zariye apna kam jaari rakh sakoon."" This translates to: ""Besides fever and a bad stomach, I feel myself in good and better condition to continue my work through telecommuting."" This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unhein bukhaar nahein hay:** The passage explicitly mentions ""bukhaar"" (fever).
* **B: Kayi hafton tak wohh ghar parr hi rahein gay:** The passage says ""kayee dinon tak"" (for many days), not ""kayi hafton tak"" (for many weeks).
* **D: Usko sakht darjah ka virus hay:** While the President has symptoms, the passage doesn't indicate the severity of the virus. It only mentions fever and stomach issues.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Surtaani tofaan gona key kamzor hotey rahney ki tawaqqo kabb thee?","The correct answer is **B: Jabb hawayein taqriban 83 kelometer fee ghantah parr kam hojaye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aaj saweray hawaon kee raftaar taqriban 83 kelometer fee ghantah thee aur ummid thee kehh kam ho jaye gee."" This directly indicates that the expectation of the storm weakening was *when the wind speed reached approximately 83 kilometers per hour*.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maldives pahunchney sey pahley:** The passage doesn't mention the Maldives.
* **C: Apni chotti parr pahunchney sey pahley:** The passage refers to the storm as ""Surtaani toofan gona,"" and doesn't mention its ""chotti.""
* **D: 149 meel fee ghantah ki hawaon tak pahuchney sey pahley:** The passage states the wind speed *reached* 149 kilometers per hour, implying it was *after* that point that weakening was expected.



"
Surtaani tofaan gona ki chotti parr hawayein kitni tez theen?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kilometer fee ghanta**.

The passage states: ""hawayein 240 kelometer fee ghantah (149 meal fee ghantah) kee raftaar say pahunch gayein."" This directly translates to the wind speed being 149 kilometers per hour. While 240 km/h is also mentioned, it's in miles per hour and the question asks for kilometers per hour.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko carinia brewees ka rawayya nahein samjha jata hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Yehh insaaan key aasab ko na ahal kar sakta hay** (It cannot paralyze human nerves).

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states that *Carinia brewees* produces neurotoxins that can paralyze both human and fish nerves.  The other options are all supported by the text:

* **A: Yehh tahaalib ki eek qism hay** (It is a type of alga) - This is implied by the context of natural phenomena and algae causing these effects.
* **C: Iska kaseer naam hay** (It has many names) - This is a general characteristic of biological organisms.
* **D: Yehh fitri tor parr waqea hota hay** (It happens naturally) -  The text emphasizes that these are natural events driven by environmental factors.



Therefore, option B directly contradicts the information given in the text."
Darjah zail mein sey kisko carinia brewees nahein kar sakta?,"The correct answer is **B: Kisi bhee surate haal mein tadaad mein tezi sey barhh janaa (Increasing in population rapidly in any situation)**.

Here's why:

The text states that *Carinia brewees* thrives under conditions of increased toxicity, often caused by pollution. It doesn't say it *always* increases its population rapidly. Its growth is linked to the presence of toxins, not necessarily rapid population boom in every possible scenario. The other options are all mentioned as capabilities of *Carinia brewees*:

*   **A: Machli key aasab ko na ahal karna (Paralyzing fish nerves):** The text explicitly states that *Carinia brewees* produces neurotoxins that can paralyze fish nerves.
*   **C: Paani ko motassir karna (Contaminating water):** The text says that fish often die due to high concentrations of toxic substances in the water, implying *Carinia brewees* can contribute to water contamination.
*   **D: Neurotoxin paidaa karnaa (Producing neurotoxins):** This is directly stated in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Fleshiya toofan key natijah key tor parr waqea nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Sadkon kaa sailaab (Road flooding)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that there is *no information* of damage or flooding from the storm.
* The passage mentions ""fayeda mand barish"" (beneficial rain), ""garaj aur bijli"" (thunder and lightning).
* While the passage mentions ""bijli"" (lightning), it doesn't explicitly mention ""mokarrar bijlee ki chamak"" (repeated lightning flashes) – ""bijli"" implies lightning, not necessarily repeated flashes.
* The passage *specifically excludes* road flooding from reported damages.

Therefore, road flooding is the event that wasn't reported as a result of the Fleshiya storm.
"
Fleshiya toofan key barey mein konsaa bayaniyah galat hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Categri 4 key toofan mein tabdeel honay sey pahley tropical depression key tor parr yehh pahli categri kardah hay**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fleshiya, jo saafir simpson harikeen scale parr categri 4 kaa toofan hay, zael honay say pehle tropical depression mein tehlil ho gayaa."" This means it *was* a Category 4 hurricane before weakening into a tropical depression. So, it wasn't the *first* category it was classified as.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Natijah khez barish sey Oahu ko fayedah hua thaa:**  The passage explicitly says ""Awaho mein eek geej kee paimaish karnay parr 6.34 inch tak pahunchnay waali baarish ko """"fayedah mand"""" bataya gayaa thaa.""
* **C: Ziyadah tarr jazeeron mein barish dekhi gayi:** The passage says, ""Uss kee baqiyat say beshtar jazeeron mein baarish hoyee hay...""
* **D: Kuchh barishein bijlee ki chamak key saath thee:** The passage states, ""Kuchh baarish key saath garaj aur bijli kee kadak bhee thee.""



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr 2009 key Grand Prix toofan key natijah ki akkasi karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Fernando Alonso ko waqea mein shaamil kar diya gaya thaa**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that Fernando Alonso was involved in the incident at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, which led to the subsequent investigation and dismissal of Piquet Jr.  The 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix is mentioned *after* the 2008 incident and the dismissal of Piquet Jr., implying the 2009 race was a consequence of that earlier event.  Therefore, Alonso's involvement is directly related to the situation being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Piquet Jr. ney jeet liyaa thaa:** The text doesn't say Piquet Jr. won any race. In fact, the scandal *led* to his dismissal.
*   **C: Piquet Jr. ko uskey baad goli maar dee gayi thee:** This is completely false and not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Safety car ko eek waqea mein shaamil kar diya gaya thaa:** While the safety car was involved in the 2008 incident, the text doesn't specifically say it was involved in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix. The connection is implied through the overall narrative of the scandal.

"
Takkar kabb waqea hua?,"The correct answer is **B: Jabb deegar caron mein tel bharaa ja rahaa thaa (When other cars were going in for fuel)**.

The passage states: ""Jaise hee alwanso say agli gaadiyan safety car key maatehat fuel bharwane gayein, woh fateh haasil karnay key liye gaadiyon say aagay nikal gayaa.""  This translates to: ""As soon as the cars behind Alonso went in for fuel under the safety car, he pulled ahead to gain an advantage.""

Option B accurately reflects this timing. The other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The passage says the incident happened *after* Alonso's pit stop.
* **C:** The incident happened *after* the safety car came out.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention anything about Piquet going in for fuel before the incident.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zial mein sey kisko aslan tahqeeq kaaron yaqeen karney key moqabiley kam waqt lagaa thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Parjatiyon kaa irteqaa (Evolution of species)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the evolution of new species occurred within just two generations. This indicates a relatively *short* period of time for evolution to take place.  The other options describe steps *leading up* to the final result of evolution, but don't pinpoint the timeframe:

* **A: Parjatiyon ki tashkeel (Formation of species):** This is the broad process, and the text focuses on the *speed* of the change, not the formation itself.
* **B: Parjatiyon key barey mein report karna (Reporting about species):** This refers to the act of documenting the findings, a process separate from the evolutionary period.
* **C: Mukhtalif parjatiyon key darmiyaan afzaesh (Increase between different species):** This is too general and doesn't address the specific timeframe.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiski tahqeeq kaaron ney report nahein ki thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Nayi parjatiyon ka naam**.

Here's why:

* The question asks which aspect *wasn't* reported by the researchers.
* The text explicitly mentions the formation of new species, the length of the evolutionary process, and the names of the birds involved. 
* While the names of the new species are mentioned, the question asks which aspect the researchers *didn't* report *on*. The information about the new species' names is readily available in the text.

Therefore, the answer is **C**."
Gayon ki parade kahaan hogi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bucharest shahar mein**.

The text states: ""Yeah fankarana taqrib bhee bakharist city haal kee eek muhim kaa hissah hay jo romaniah key darulhukumat kee tasveer ko takhliqi aur rangeen kaseer aabadi waale shahar key tor parr dobarah launch karnay kee koshish karti hay.""  This directly indicates that the festival is a significant part of Bucharest's image.  While the festival will be held in multiple Romanian cities, the question asks *where* the parade will be held, and the context implies it's focused on Bucharest.

Options A, C, and D are incorrect because the text focuses on Bucharest specifically as the capital of Romania and the city whose image is being re-launched.
"
Konsa dajah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr gaye parade ki wazahat krata hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Yehh duniya mein bahut badee awaami fan ki mahfil hay** (This is a very large public fan event in the world).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""jo kehh duniya kaa sab say badaa awami fankarana event hay"" (which is the world's largest public fan event).
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: Yehh sirf “takhliqi” samjhey jaaney waley shahron mein waqea hota hay** (This only happens in cities understood as ""creative""). While Bucharest is trying to portray itself as creative, the passage doesn't limit the parade to only ""creative"" cities.
    * **B: isey Bucharest shahar key hall kee jaanib sey banaya gaya thaa** (It was created by the Bucharest city hall). The passage indicates Bucharest is *hosting* the parade, not necessarily the creator.
    * **C: Yehh eek fan ki mahfil thee jo garmi key mausam mein purey jonub mashriqi europe mein munaqid ki jaati hay** (This is a fan event held in the summer throughout Southeast Europe). While the parade *is* held in the summer in Southeast Europe, the passage doesn't describe it *only* as a fan event held throughout the region. It's a specific event that Bucharest is hosting.



"
Kiss wajah sey roos ney II-76 key istemaal ko moattal kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: koyi waqea (an incident)**.

The text states: ""Aayi IL-76 1970 kee dahayi say roose aur soviet afwaj kaa eek badaa mukawwin rahaa hay, aur roose mein yeah pichlay maah eek sangeen haadsah say dochaar ho chukaa hay."" (The Aayi IL-76 has been a major component of the Russian and Soviet armed forces since the 1970s, and in Russia it has been affected by a serious incident last month.) 

It then goes on to describe the incident where an Aayi IL-76 disappeared shortly after takeoff.  The text explicitly says the aircraft was taken out of service *after* the incident. Therefore, a serious incident is the reason for the grounding.
"
II-76 kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek hawayi jahaaz (A flight/airplane)**.

The passage clearly states: ""Aayi IL-76 1970 kee dahayi say roose aur soviet afwaj kaa eek badaa mukawwin rahaa hay..."" (The Aayi IL-76 has been a major component of the Russian and Soviet armed forces since the 1970s...)  This directly identifies the IL-76 as an aircraft.
"
Simpsons key liye kisney tahreeri team ko kiraye parr liyaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Brooks**.

The text states: ""1989 mein uss nay di sampsins wadh brooks and govening kee tashkil mein madad di aur iss show key liye likhnay waalon kee awwaleen team ko bharti karnay key liye zimmah dar thaa."" This translates to: ""In 1989, he helped with the formation of Wadh Brooks and Goeving and was responsible for hiring the first writing team for the show.""  Therefore, Brooks hired the writing team.
"
"Fluke key hisaab sey, kisney uskey musbat tabsarey aur masrufiyat ko bhej rahaa thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Mard hazraat (Men)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...woh iss natijah parr parr taadad mein maanaye hamal ko tibbee zaroorat qaraar deenay waale hauslah afzaa aur musbat paighamat **mardo khwateen kee taraf say** bary..."". This indicates that men were the ones sending the encouraging messages and positive sentiments."
"Ebarat key hisaab, kiss cheez key baarey mein kuchh log nahein chahtey they kehh khawateen baat karein?","The correct answer is **C: Khawateen ki sehat (Women's health)**.

Here's why:

The sentence states that attempts to *stop* women from talking about women's health were unsuccessful. This directly implies that women's health is the topic people didn't want discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mard aftaad (Male arrogance):** The sentence doesn't mention anything about male arrogance.
* **B: Tibbi qimatein (Medical costs):**  While healthcare costs might be a factor in women's health discussions, the sentence focuses on preventing the discussion itself.
* **D: Fluke:** ""Fluke"" is mentioned as a synonym for ""likhta"" (to write), referring to the attempts to stop the discussion. It's not the topic being suppressed.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa sayyarawi jism sabsey ziyadah motaharrik hoti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Zameen (Earth)**.

The text explicitly states: ""jahaan taak hamein malum hay titan key sewaa faqat eek hee kokab hay jo harakkiyat kaa izhaar karta hay aur uss kaa naam hay zameen."" This translates to: ""As far as we know, Titan's service is only one planet that exhibits movement, and its name is Earth.""  The phrase ""harakkiyat kaa izhaar karta hay"" means ""exhibits movement"". Therefore, Earth is identified as the most mobile celestial body mentioned.
"
Eek saaf shaffaaf sayyaal parr mushtamil nadiyon aur jheelon ki kiss sayyarawi jism parr shanakht ki gayi hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yeah paani kee tarah shaffaf hay... Lehaza agar aap saahil key kinaray khaday hotay, to aap neechey kee taraf rakhi huyee kankariyan yaa chipchipa mawaad dekh paatay. Stophan nay mazeed kahaa: """"jahaan taak hamein malum hay titan key sewaa faqat eek hee kokab hay jo harakkiyat kaa izhaar karta hay aur uss kaa naam hay zameen."""" ""

This translates to: ""...it is transparent like water... Therefore, if you were standing on the shore, you would see pebbles or sticky substance below. Stophan further said: ""As far as we know, Titan's only service is the planet that shows activity, and its name is Earth.""""

The sentence clearly identifies Earth as the only planet known to have activity, and then states that Titan's *only* service is to *be* that planet. The question asks which celestial body has clear, transparent liquid seas/rivers.  The passage links this to Titan.
"
Inn mein sey konsi tahqiqi pankh daryaft kaa natijah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaanwar key aaraishee pankh ka rang**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the research provides details about dinosaur feather **color** (yellowish-brown or crotinoid). Option A, ""Jaanwar key aaraishee pankh ka rang"" is too general. The research doesn't only confirm the color, it provides specific details about it. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* confirmed by the research:

* **B: Yehh samajh kehh Udaan mein pankhon ka istemaal nahein hua thaa (It's understood that wings were not used for flying):** The text mentions the wings may have been used for temperature regulation or display, not necessarily for flight.
* **C: Pankh key irteqaa mein baseerat (Insight into feather evolution):** The text discusses the structure of the feathers and suggests potential evolutionary pathways for the rachis (the main shaft of a feather).
* **D: Yehh tasdique kehh ziyadah tarr dinosaur key pankh they (It confirms that most dinosaurs had feathers):** The text begins by stating that the research confirms the existence of feathers in many dinosaurs.



"
Dinosaur key pankhon mein kiya cheez nahein thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek dandi**.

The text explicitly states: ""Keunkeh ddaina soor kee pankh mein achhi tarah say tayaar shudah shaft nahein hota, jis ko dandi kahaa jaataa hai..."" which translates to ""Although the dinosaur's wings do not have a well-developed shaft, called a dandi...""

Therefore, the dinosaur wings *didn't* have a dandi.
"
ZMapp key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sach nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Yehh mojudah infection ka elaaj karney key qabil hay lekin maut sey bahcaney key qabil nahi hay**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""abhi tak koyee bhee dawaa waazeh tor parr maujudah infection key elaaj keliye mozun nahein payee gayee hay."" (As of now, no medicine has been clearly found to be effective in treating the existing infection.)
* **The passage also states:** ""ZMapp nay ibtadaa mein iss maidan mein ummid kee shamaa roshan kee hay lekin rasmi tehqeeq say patah challa kehh yeah itnaa fayedah mand nahein thaa jitna maut ko roknay keliye matlub thaa."" (ZMapp initially lit a spark in this field, but official research revealed that it was not as beneficial as needed to prevent death.)

Therefore, ZMapp is *not* effective in treating the infection *and* preventing death. Options A, C, and D are all directly supported by the text.



"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor par PALM trial ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek contrrol dawa ka mowaznah teen deegar elaajon sey hua tha, jinmein sey eek ZMapp thaa.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""PALM trial mein zemap nay control kaa kam kiya, yaani science daanon nay iss kaa istemaal bees line key tor par kiya, aur iss key deegar teen elaajon kaa mawaznah kiya.""  This translates to ""In the PALM trial, ZMapp was used as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline, and its effects were compared to three other treatments.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tahqiqaat sey zaahir hua kehh ismein sabeqah khiyaal sey ziyaadah fawayed ho saktey hein:** While the text mentions initial hope, it also states ZMapp wasn't as effective as needed to prevent death. So, this is not a completely accurate summary.
* **C: ZMapp ka istemaal trial ki buniyaadi line key tor par hua thaa:** While ZMapp *was* used as a baseline, the text doesn't say it was the *fundamental* line of the trial. It was compared to other treatments.
* **D: Mojudah surate haal ka elaaj karney mein Isey motassir dikhaya gaya thaa:**  The text focuses on preventing *death* in the early stages of the disease, not on treating existing cases.  It emphasizes its use as a *prevention* measure.



"
Tahqiq kaaron key khiyaal mein nayi chip kahaan sabsey ziyaadah aham thee?,"The correct answer is **A: kam aamadni waley mamalik (low-income countries)**.

The passage explicitly states that the chip is intended to be most impactful in low-income countries, where early diagnosis of diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria is crucial, and where rates of diseases like breast cancer are significantly higher compared to wealthier nations.
"
Tashkhisi tool ki tameer karney key liye konsa tariqah istemaal kiya jaye gaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Meyaari inkjet printer**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""yeah eek chhoti see printable chip hay jo ghaliban eek **ameriki sent mein meyari ink jait printers kaa istemaal karr key tayyaar kee jaa sakti hay**..."" (yeah it's a small printable chip that can likely be prepared using standard inkjet printers for the price of an American cent...).  Therefore, a standard inkjet printer is the key method for creating the diagnostic tool.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, goshah dar daagon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Unmein sey bahut sey chaand ki satah parr nahein miley they.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that lobate scars are visible on the Moon's surface and are evidence of relatively recent geological activity.** This directly contradicts option D, which claims that many of them haven't been found on the Moon's surface.  The passage explicitly says they *are* found.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Unko bananey waley waqeaat mumkinah tor parr filhaal waqea hui thee** (The events that created them likely happened recently).  The passage states that lobate scars are evidence of *recent* geological events.
* **B: Unki mojudgi ka matlab hay kehh chaand mein arziyaati sargarmi ki kami nahein hay** (Their presence means that the Moon is not devoid of geological activity). The passage argues *against* the idea that the Moon is devoid of geological activity because of the lobate scars.
* **C: Hosakta hay woh chaand key sukadney ka natijah ban jaye** (They could be a result of the Moon's cooling).  The passage suggests that lobate scars are *not* simply a result of cooling but evidence of more recent activity.



Therefore, only option D is factually incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, zameeni shaklon key motallique konsa nazriyah iss baat ki nishaan dahi karta hay kehh chaand parr waqea honay wali arziyaati sargarmi mojud hay?","The correct answer is **D: Haal mein monasib tor parr zameen ki shaklein bani theen (Relatively recently formed landforms are present on the Moon).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chand kee satah parr jaa bajaa payee jaaney waali khayiyon say malum hota hay kehh woh kam mausam dedah hain. Unn say zahir ho ta hay kehh jinn geologic haadsaat say unn kee takhliq huyee woh bahut haaliyah zamana key hain.""  This translates to: ""The craters found on the surface of the Moon indicate that they are relatively young. It is evident that the geologic events that created them are of recent times.""

This directly supports the idea that relatively recent geological activity (like impacts creating craters) has occurred on the Moon.  This contradicts the idea that the Moon is completely inert and inactive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chaand aahistah tor parr sukad raha hay (The Moon is slowly cooling down):**  While cooling is a factor, the passage focuses on *recent* geological activity, not just the cooling process.  Cooling doesn't inherently imply ongoing activity.
* **B: Zameen ki shaklein bahut pahley bani theen (Landforms on Earth are very old):** This is irrelevant to the Moon's activity. The passage is comparing the Moon to Earth.
* **C: Chaand ki satah parr kam miqdaar ki zameeni shaklein hi mojud hein (Only a small amount of landforms exist on the Moon):** The passage says craters (landforms) *are* present, just that they are relatively young. The quantity of landforms is not the key point.



"
"Ebaarat key hissaab sey, kiya cheez farde jurm tak ki hadd sey ziyadah ki nahein hogi?","The correct answer is **A: Mazeed tabsrey (Further commentary)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Crown Office has instructed journalists **not to do any further commentary** (mazeed tabsrey) until a conviction occurs. This implies that the focus should remain on the legal proceedings and avoid speculation or detailed reporting that could prejudice the case.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tasweer ki ishaatein (Image interpretations):** While image interpretations are mentioned as being potentially unreliable in court, the text doesn't say they are beyond the scope of the legal proceedings.
* **C: Ainy shahadat key mobahissey (Contradictions in witness testimony):** This is part of the legal process and directly relevant to the case.
* **D: Mazmoon ki ishaatein (Content interpretations):** Similar to image interpretations, the text doesn't imply that content interpretations are outside the bounds of the legal proceedings.

Therefore, ""mazeed tabsrey"" is the element that is being restricted *beyond* the core legal process (waiting for a conviction). The Crown Office wants to limit the narrative around the case, preventing journalists from speculating or adding details that could influence public opinion or the jury.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, sealer key liye haaliyah masalah kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Baraf ka motaapa (Thickness of snow)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""peak ice ki miqdar aur motayi pichlay 15 salon mein abb tak mehr kunindgan key liye sab say badtareen rahee hay"" which translates to ""peak ice amount and thickness have remained the worst for skiing in the last 15 years.""
* This directly points to the thickness (motaapa) of the snow as the main problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sakht mosam ki surate haal (Severe weather conditions):** While severe weather contributes to the problem, the specific issue highlighted is the *thickness* of the snow.
* **B: Baraf ki miqdaar (Amount of snow):** The passage mentions the *amount* but emphasizes the problem is with the *thickness*.
* **D: Pighalta baraf (Melting snow):** The passage focuses on the current situation, not the future (melting). It discusses the historical worst conditions.



"
"Baraf key saath, bachao ki koshishon ko aur kiya cheez motassir kar rahi thee?","The correct answer is **B: Mosam ki surate haal (Weather conditions)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Barf key tutay hoay todon key elawah intehayi namuafiq mosami halaat nay bachanay kee koshishon mein rukawatein paida kee hain."" This translates to: ""Besides the broken ice, extremely adverse weather conditions have created obstacles in rescue efforts.""

Therefore, the adverse weather conditions are what are impacting the rescue efforts in addition to the broken ice.
"
Kis aqeedah ki jawaz dahi karney sey Roberts ney parhez kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Cason parr bahas karney ki ikhlaaqiyat** (The morality of discussing cases).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Robbots nay iss baabat kuchh kahnay say saaf inkaar kiya kehh zindagi kab shuroo hoti hay, jo isqaate hamal kee akhlaqiyat key zimn mein eek ahem sawaal hay."" This translates to: ""Roberts clearly refused to say anything about when life begins, which is a key question within the morality of abortion.""

The passage says he refused to comment on the ""morality of discussing when life begins."" Therefore, option A is the most accurate. While he addressed other topics, the passage highlights his refusal to discuss the morality of the abortion debate.
"
Konsa mauzu Roberts key ihsaas mein itna ikhlaaqi thaa kehh uss parr bahas nahein ki ja sakti?,"The correct answer is **B: Roe v. Wade ka faislah**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the question of when life begins is a central question within the ethics of abortion (iskaate hamal).
* Roberts' refusal to comment on this question suggests its deeply sensitive and ethically charged nature.
* The passage then mentions Roe v. Wade as ""mulk kaa muqarrarah qanoon"" (the country's established law), highlighting its significance and the ethical complexities surrounding it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adaalatey Aaliyah key faisalon ka tasalsul (The sequence of Supreme Court decisions):** While important, the passage doesn't frame the *sequence* of decisions as being ethically untouchable. It's the specific *content* of a decision that is the ethical concern.
* **C: Nafiz kardah razdaari ka haque (The right to enforced privacy):**  Roberts acknowledges the importance of privacy rights related to Roe v. Wade but doesn't suggest the *right itself* is ethically untouchable.  The ethical issue lies in the application of that right within the abortion debate.
* **D: Cason ki takhsisaat (The specifics of cases):** Roberts says discussing the specifics of potential cases would be ""gair akhlaqi"" (unethical). This directly points to the ethical sensitivity of the *cases themselves* (particularly those related to abortion).

Therefore, **Roe v. Wade ka faislah** is the most accurate answer because the passage directly connects it to the ethical complexities surrounding abortion and Roberts' reluctance to discuss the fundamental question of when life begins.
"
Bijlee chamakney ki do kadiyaan kahaan hoti hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Aasmaan ki taraf (Towards the sky)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Do light beam aisi nasab kee gayee hain jinn kaa rukh raat bhar asmaan kee jaanib rehta hay."" which translates to ""Two light beams have been installed, which are directed towards the sky throughout the night.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, uss maqam mein aasmaan key naye daagh kabb banaye kiye jaatey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Raat mein**.

The passage states: ""Do light beam aisi nasab kee gayee hain jinn kaa rukh raat bhar asmaan kee jaanib rehta hay."" (Two light beams have been installed whose direction remains towards the sky throughout the night.) This implies the ""new marks on the sky"" (referring to the light beams) are created at night.
"
Konsi malumaat tajweez karti hay kehh saton bahnein gaar hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Darjaye hararat key motagayyaraat (Temperature fluctuations)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Infraraid images say zahir hota hay kehh din aur raat key temperature key ikhtelafat zahir kartay hain kehh woh donon ghaaron key manind hain.""  This means the temperature changes (fluctuations) are a key indicator that the Seven Sisters are caves, behaving similarly to other caves in terms of temperature differences between day and night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gaar key daakhli raaston ka diameter (Diameter of cave entrances):** While the passage mentions the entrance diameters (100-250 meters), this doesn't *prove* they are caves.  Other geological formations could have similar entrance sizes.
* **C: Arziyati Survery (Geological Survey):** The mention of the USGS and Northern Arizona University's geology team is relevant to the study but doesn't directly tell us *why* the Seven Sisters are caves.
* **D: Zameen parr gaaron ki tasaaweer (Pictures of caves on the ground):**  The passage refers to the Seven Sisters' behavior being *similar* to other caves, not directly referencing pictures of caves on the ground.

Saton bahnon key thermal rawayyey ka kaisey moshahidah kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: infrared tasaweer (infrared images)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Infraraid images say zahir hota hay kehh din aur raat key temperature key ikhtelafat zahir kartay hain kehh woh donon ghaaron key manind hain."" (Infrared images show that the temperature differences between day and night are similar to those of both houses.)

While the passage mentions deep soil, it explains that it's *like* deep soil, not the method used to *observe* the thermal behavior. The other options are not directly mentioned as the observation method.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mushtabah key barey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Wohh zakhmi nahein hua thaa** (He wasn't injured).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Dhamakay mein zakhmi shakhs ko dhamaka karnay waale mashkook shakhs key tor parr heraasat mein lia gayaa hay"" (In the explosion, an injured person was arrested as the suspicious person who caused the explosion). This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct based on the text:

* **A: Hamlah key doraan usney eek gaadi istemaal ki thee** (During the attack, he used a car): The text says ""apni teen pahiyon waali gaadi ko hojum mein ghusa diyaa"" (he drove his three-wheeled car into the attack).
* **B: Mobaiyanah tor parr usney eek dhamakah kiya thaa** (He clearly detonated an explosion): The text says ""dhamakay mein"" (in the explosion), indicating he caused the explosion.
* **C: Hukkaam uski nasal ko jaantey hein** (The authorities know his race): The text says ""unn ko malum hay kehh uss kaa taalluq awaighoor nasli garoh say hay"" (they know that he belongs to the Awighoor ethnic group).



Therefore, option D is the only statement that is *incorrect* based on the provided text."
Hamlah ki babat kiss malumaat ki hukkaam ney tasdique ki hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Mushtabah ki nasal (Mushtabah's race)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Uss fard kaa naam hukkaam key liye abb bhee naa maloom hay agarchaa unn ko maloom hay kehh uss kaa taalluq awaighoor nasli garoh say hay."" which translates to ""The name of the individual is still unknown to the authorities, although they know that he belongs to the Awighoor ethnic group.""

The text does *not* confirm any of the other options:

*   **A: Kisi sathiyon ki shanaakhtein (Testimonies of colleagues)** - No mention of this.
*   **C: Hamlah key pichey ka moharrik (The motive behind the attack)** - This is unknown.
*   **D: Mushtabah ka pahla aur akhri naam (Mushtabah's first and last name)** - The name is unknown.



"
Ellis Park key match mein konsi teamein khelein gee?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa aur Australia**.

The text states: ""Series kaa hatmi match aglay haftay johannesburg mein ails park mein hoga, jab spring boks australia key saath khelein gay."" (The final match of the series will be next week in Johannesburg at Ellis Park, when the Springboks will play against Australia.)
"
Springboks apna agla match kahaan kheley gee?,"The correct answer is **A: Australia**.

The text states: ""Series kaa hatmi match aglay haftay johannesburg mein ails park mein hoga, jab spring boks **australia key saath khelein gay**."" (The final match of the series will be next week in Johannesburg at Ails Park, when the Springboks will play **against Australia**.)
"
Mission key doraan darjah zail mein sey kiskey saath khalaayi station ko prishaani hui thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek gyroscope ko barqarar rakhnaa (Maintaining a gyroscope)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Pehle khalayi station mission mein eek jeero scope key noqsan key bawajood uss station nay khalayi raastay key ikhtetam tak apna rawayyah barqarar rakhaa.""  This translates to: ""In the first space station mission, despite the loss of one gyroscope, the station maintained its trajectory until the end of the space journey.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Thrusters sey sahee faasley ka nazm karnaa (Adjusting the correct distance with thrusters):** The passage mentions thrusters as being used for altitude adjustment, but not as a problem *during* the mission.
* **C: Tayyarah ki faaliyat (Aircraft activity):**  The passage mentions Russian ground control launching jets, but this was a *solution* to the problem, not a cause of the problem during the mission.
* **D: Aam rawayyah ko dobarah hasil karnah (Restoring normal trajectory):**  This is the *result* of the successful handling of the gyroscope issue, not the issue itself.

Therefore, the problem the space station faced was maintaining the functionality of a gyroscope.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, khalayi station key mission ka maqsad kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Eek khalayi chalat firat ko mokammal karnaa (To complete a planned space maneuver)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the station maintained its trajectory despite a gyroscope malfunction.**  Maintaining trajectory is a core part of completing planned maneuvers.
* **The mention of altitude adjustment thrusters being protected suggests the station was designed for specific altitude changes as part of its mission.**
* **The jet planes were deployed to restore normal operations, implying a larger, pre-planned task was underway.**

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Gumshudah gyroscope ko talaash kranaa (Searching for a lost gyroscope):** The passage mentions a *malfunction* of the gyroscope, not that it was lost.
* **B: Motabiqat key thrusters sey qreeb honaa (Approaching matching thrusters):**  While thrusters are mentioned, the focus is on the station maintaining its trajectory *despite* the gyroscope issue, not specifically approaching thrusters.
* **D: Tayyaron ko faal karna (Launching planes):** Launching planes was a response to the problem, not the primary mission objective.

Therefore, the most logical conclusion is that the space station's mission involved a planned maneuver that it was striving to complete, and the gyroscope malfunction was a setback they managed to overcome.
"
Case key barey mein konsa dajah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"The incorrect statement about the case is **A: Iss parr uss riyasat mein moqddamah chalaya gaya thaa jahaan AOL ka headquarter hay.**

Here's why:

The question states that the case was filed in Virginia *because* AOL was a stable internet service provider and company that brought the charges.  The case wasn't filed in Virginia *because* it was where AOL's headquarters were. The connection is about AOL's stability and willingness to pursue the issue, not their location.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Eek saza di gayee thee:** The question states ""yeah pehli baar hay kehh koyee shakhs adalat say mahkum huwa"" which directly implies a sentence was issued.
* **C: Fozul email key baarey mein qanoon sazi ka case mein istemaal kiya gaya thaa:** The question explicitly mentions the 2003 law prohibiting unsolicited bulk email (spam).
* **D: AOL ko charge kiya gaya thaa:** The question says that AOL brought the charges against the sender of the spam.



Therefore, the statement that is incorrect is **A**.
"
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr case ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Case parr 2003 mein moqaddamah chalaya gaya thaa.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Iss qanoon key tahat jisay 2003 mein gair matlub bulk email (spam) ko afraad key mail boxon mein bhejnay kee mamnuiyat keye liye paas kiya gayaa..."" This directly confirms that the law existed since 2003 and was in effect.
* **The text highlights the significance:** The case is important because it's the first time anyone has been convicted under this law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL ko gair matlub taqseem key saath charge kiya gaya thaa:** While the case is about spam, the provided text *doesn't* mention any specific charge related to spam distribution.
* **B: Case mein do sarkardah internet khidmat faraham kunindah shaamil they:** The text only mentions AOL as the company being sued.
* **D: AOL ney case key moqaddamah kaa aagaz kiya thaa:** The text doesn't state that AOL initiated the legal proceedings. They were the defendant.



Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects the information presented in the text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Vidal teen season pahley tak kis club key liye kheltey they?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The question asks where Vidal was playing three seasons *before* moving to Catalan-Capital. The passage states he joined Catalan-Capital *after* playing for Sevilla for three seasons. Therefore, he was playing for Sevilla three seasons prior to joining Catalan-Capital.
"
Barça key liye Vidal ney kitney game kheley hein?,"The correct answer is **B: 39**.

The question asks how many games Vidal played for Barça. The text states that after moving to Catalin-capital, Vidal played 49 games for that club.  However, it doesn't state how many games he played for Barça.  Therefore, we need to infer. The question doesn't provide enough information to directly answer and the options provided are inconsistent with the given text. It's possible there's missing information or a typo in the question or options.

**However**, if we assume the question is asking about the number of games he played *after* joining Catalin-Capital (which is likely what the question implies by focusing on his time at that club), then 49 is the correct answer.

**But, given the provided answer choices, and assuming there is a typo and it meant ""Catalin-capital,"" 39 is the most logical answer based on typical football statistics and the fact that 49 is not an available option.**



Without more information, I'm hesitant to definitively say which answer is ""correct.""  But based on the logic of the question and the available options, **B: 39** is the most likely intended answer.
"
Match mein mokhalif team kon thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text explicitly states: ""woh bolonia key khelaaf attwaar ko honey waale muqabilay se pehle team hotel mein qeyaam pazeer they."" which translates to ""they were staying at the team hotel before the matches to come against Bologna.""
"
Jarque hotel mein kion qiyaam kar rahaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Uskaa Itwaar ko eek match thaa** (He had a match on Sunday).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Woh Bolonia key khelaaf attwaar key roz khelay jaaney waale eek match say qabal team key hotel mein qeyaam pazeer hoay they."" This translates to: ""They were staying at the team hotel before a match they were scheduled to play against Bologna.""  Since the passage mentions the match is on Sunday (""Itwaar""), the most logical reason for Jarque being at the hotel is to prepare for that match.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usney practice ki thee (He was practicing):** While the passage mentions training, it's not the primary reason he was at the hotel. The context focuses on the upcoming match.
* **B: Usney season sey pahley mulaqaat ki thee (He had a meeting before the season):** The passage refers to a match against Bologna, not a pre-season meeting.
* **D: Wohh Bolonia key saath tarbiyat ley rahaa tha (He was training with Bologna):** The passage says they were playing against Bologna, not training with them.



"
Jakarta ki geophysics agency keon koyi tanbih jaari nahein ki?,"The correct answer is **D: Usney zalzalah ki shiddat ki zarurat ko puraa nahein kiya thaa** (It did not meet the requirements for the earthquake's intensity).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""jakartah kee geo physics agency key mutabiq sonami kee koyee warning jaari nahein kee jaye gee kiyon kehh zalzalah 6.5 magnitude kee shart parr pooraa nahein utarta"" which translates to ""According to Jakarta's geophysics agency, no tsunami warning will be issued because the earthquake did not fully meet the requirements for a magnitude of 6.5.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sunaami ka koyi khatrah nahein thaa** (There was no tsunami danger) - This is a consequence, not the reason for no warning.
* **B: Bashindgaan key darmiyaan khauf sey bachney key liye** (To prevent fear among the residents) - This is not the reason the agency didn't issue a warning.
* **C: Maqami karobaaron parr asar sey bachney key liye** (To protect local businesses) - This is not the reason the agency didn't issue a warning.



"
Ebarat key hisaab sey zalzalah ki wajah sey kiya hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Shiddat key paimaney parr eek 6.5**.

The text explicitly states: ""zalzalah 6.5 magnitude kee shart parr pooraa nahein utarta."" This means the earthquake was 6.5 in magnitude, but didn't meet the threshold to trigger a tsunami warning. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the text clarifies there was no tsunami warning issued and the earthquake wasn't a tsunami cause.
"
Inmein sey kon suraj aur tamaam deegar sayyaron ki sargarmi ka moharrik hota hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Roshni aur plasma ka bahao (Light and plasma flow)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nizam mein mojud tamaam setaron kee srgarmi kisee aur cheez say nahein, balkeh unn kee roshni aur gardish say mutissir payee gayee."" (The activity of all stars in the system is not influenced by anything else, but rather by their light and rotation.)

While the Rossby number is used to determine a star's rotational activity, the passage emphasizes that *light* and *plasma flow* are the primary drivers.  Option A accurately reflects this.
"
Kisi sitaarey key Rossby number ka tayyun kaisey hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Plasma bahao ki miqdaar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Setaray key raasbi number kaa tayeen karnay key liye uss kee chamak aur gardish ko eek saath istemaal kiya jaataa hay, jo kehh plasma key bahao say mutalliq hay.""  This directly translates to: ""To determine a star's Rossby number, both its brightness and rotation are used together, which relates to the plasma flow.""

While brightness and rotation are both factors, the passage explicitly links the Rossby number to the *plasma flow*, which is the *amount* or *magnitude* of the plasma flow. Therefore, option B is the most accurate.
"
Australia key fauri jamhuriyah bananey mein himaayat karney waaley servery kardah kitney feesad log they?,"The correct answer is **C: 8 feesad**

Here's why:

The question asks about support for *immediately* becoming a republic. The text states: ""jitni jald mumkin ho australia ko republic banaa diyaa jaye"" which translates to ""Australia should be made a republic as soon as possible"".  This refers to the 29% who favored a republic at either end of the spectrum.

The question is asking about support for a *fauri* (immediate) republic. The text says ""31 feesad kaa khayal hay kehh australia ko kabhi bhee republic nahein honaa chahiye"" which translates to ""31 percent think Australia should never become a republic."" This suggests they oppose a republic.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 31 feesad** - This is the percentage of people who think Australia should *never* become a republic.
*   **B: 29 feesad** - This is the percentage of people who support a republic at either end of the spectrum (both very strongly for and very strongly against).
*   **D: 34 feesad** - This is the percentage of people who think Queen Elizabeth II should be Australia's last monarch.

Therefore, there is no answer to the question. The question asks for people who support a *fauri* republic, but the text does not give an answer to this."
"Julie Gillard key hisaab sey, Australia ko jamhuri kabb banana chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Queen Elizabeth II key ahad key baad**.

The text states: ""Oburi wazir aazam joliya glard nay 2010 key wafaqi intekhaab kee muhim key doraan daawaa kiya thaa kehh unn kaa manna hay kehh australia ko malkah elzabeth dom key dore hukumat key ikhtetam parr awami jamhuria bann jaana chahiye."" This translates to ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.""
"
Konsi tanzeen qanooni tafteesh ke taht hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Komen Foundation**.

Here's why:

* The question states: ""...nay kahaa kehh unn kee tanzeem nay eek naya qayedah ekhtiyarif kiya hay jis ke mutabiq aisi tanzimon ko grant yaa maali kafalat mamnua hogi jo qanuni taftish key dairah mein hain."" This translates to ""...said that their organization has adopted a new rule according to which such organizations will be denied grants or financial assistance that are under legal investigation.""
* The text then goes on to specify that Komen Foundation is under legal investigation.

Therefore, the Komen Foundation is the organization under legal investigation, making option B the correct answer. The other options are either committees or a general category (Mansubah band waldiyat) and not the specific organization mentioned as being under investigation.
"
Cliff Stearns kis committee key sarbarah they?,"The correct answer is **A: Ghrelu energy aur iqtesaadi committee**.

The passage states: ""...jo house energy aur commerce committee kee chhatri kee taht hain..."" which translates to ""...who are under the umbrella of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Swiss khaatun key saath kiya nahein hua thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Uska chori shudah samaan baziyaaft kia gaya thaa** (Her stolen belongings were recovered).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the police recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone belonging to the Swiss woman.
* The passage mentions that five people were arrested for attempting to defile the Swiss woman's honor (""ismat rezi karna""). However, it *doesn't* state that she was harmed physically or that she suffered any direct harm.
* Options B and C are not mentioned in the text.
* Option D is partially true (her phone and laptop were stolen), but A is a more complete and accurate reflection of the recovered items.



"
2007 mein kis company ko Taiwan key Sustainable Award sey nawaza gaya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Aalimi paimanay parr qeemat bachanay aur kaam key awamil ko madde nazar rakhtay hoay launch kiya gayaa ASUSE computer 2007 key taipe aayi tea maah mein mozua bahas bann gayaa. Aawsis ko jamhuria cheen key executive yawaan key zariah 2007 taiwan payedar award diye jaaney key baad laptop computer say judaa saarfin kaa bazaar yaksar mukhtalif aur tabdil shudah hoga.""

This translates to: ""The ASUS computer, launched with an eye on global pricing and working factors, became a topic of discussion in Taipei in tea month 2007. ASUS was awarded the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Award by the executive of the People's Republic of China.""
"
ASUS Eee PC kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek laptop**.

The text explicitly states that the ASUS computer was launched and that the bazaar for laptop computers would change. While the Eee PC wasn't a traditional laptop, it was a small, portable computer designed for general use, fitting the definition more closely than a smartphone, tablet, or pager.
"
Gumshudah post ki dastavezaat key liye kon zimmah daar thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Post key karkunaan (Postal officials)**.

Here's why:

The text states that a man (ladka - boy) printed over 600 documents, including undeliverable postcards. This suggests he was involved in the issue, but the core problem – the missing mail – lies with the postal service itself.  The post office apologized to the public and media, indicating responsibility rests with them. Therefore, the postal officials are ultimately responsible for the lost documents.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, gumshudah dastavezaat key baarey mein kisney maazerat jaari ki thee?","The correct answer is **D: Obanazawa ki post office**.

The text states: ""kal dak khane nay shahriyon aur media key saamney apni muazirat pesh kee."" This translates to ""Yesterday, the post office presented its apology to the citizens and the media.""  The post office is referred to as ""dak khana"" in the text, and ""Obanazawa ki post office"" is the specific location mentioned.
"
Del Potro ko apney kandhey ki prishani ka kabb saamna karna padaa thaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Pahley tie break key baad**.

The passage states: ""Potro nay iss noqtah parr apnay shanah kaa elaaj karaya lekin khel key maidan mein wapas aaney key qaabil ho gayaa.""  This refers to him getting treatment for his shoulder *after* the first tie-break, implying the pain was a factor in that tie-break. While he might have had issues earlier, the treatment and return to the court happened after the first tie-break.
"
Pahley tie break kaa natijah kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Yehh Murray ney pahley set mein gum kar diya thaa**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baad iss key kehh donon afraad nay seat key harr eek serve ko jeet lia, tie break key natijah mein maray pehla seat haar gayaa."" (After both people won every serve, Murray lost the first set in the tie-break.)

Therefore, the first tie-break result was a loss for Murray.  Options B, C, and D are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Jaisa kehh ebarat mein bayan kiya gaya hay, kisko, khaas tor parr, eek mareez key samney beneqaab kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Governor**.

The passage states: ""Peeri nay khaas tor parr kahaa, """"duniya mein aise chand maqamat hain jo uss muamile mein darpesh challenge kaa muqabilah karnay keliye behtar tor parr tayyaar hain."""" Governor nay yeah bhee kahaa kehh..."" This clearly indicates that the Governor was the one who specifically spoke about the situation. While the passage mentions the deceased officer and children, it's the Governor who is identified as speaking in a specific context.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, governor ney Texas key shahriyon ko khitaab kartey waqt kiya yaqeen dahaani karayee thee?","The correct answer is **A: System achchey sey kaam kra rahaa hay** (The system is working well).

Here's why:

The governor explicitly states: ""yeah muamilah sanjidah hay. yaqeen rakhein hamara nizam isee tarah kam karr rahaa hay jis tarah usay karnaa chahiye."" This translates to: ""This situation is serious. Believe me, our system is working as it should.""  This is a declaration of confidence in the system's ability to handle the situation, implying the system is working well.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Logon ka tahaffuz bachaney key liye kaam kiye jaa rahey hein** (Work is being done to protect people's safety): While the governor *does* mention steps being taken for public safety, this isn't the core statement about the system itself.
* **C: Challenge ko puraa karney key liye unhein lais kiya gaya thaa** (They were brought in to overcome the challenge): This is not accurately reflected in the governor's statement.
* **D: Case sanjeedah nahein hay** (The case is not serious): This is the opposite of what the governor says (""yeah muamilah sanjidah hay"" - This situation is serious).



"
Khabar ka konsa parody zariyah do saabiq UW talabah ney takhlique kiya thaa?,"सही उत्तर है: **A: Colbert Report**

पाठ स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि Daily Show और Colbert Report ने पहले ही हैक और जंसन के विचारों पर आधारित एक ऐसी खाका की कल्पना की थी जो खबरों की रिपोर्टिंग पर व्यंग्य करती है। यह भी कहा गया है कि उनके कई लेखक जून स्टीवर्ट और स्टीफन कॉलबर्ट के समाचार व्यंग्य शो पर बहुत अधिक प्रभाव डालते हैं।

इसलिए, सही उत्तर Colbert Report है।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inmein sey kon piyaaz ki khabron key parody sultanat mein shaamil nahein hay?","सही जवाब है **B: एक फिल्म**

यहां कारण बताया गया है:

प्रसंग में बताया गया है कि ""द डेली शो"" और ""कोलबर्ट रिपोर्ट"" ने 1988 में ही उन कार्यक्रमों का विचार किया था जो समाचार रिपोर्टिंग पर व्यंग्य करेंगे। यह व्यंग्य करने वाले कार्यक्रम एक वेबसाइट, 24 घंटे के समाचार नेटवर्क, पॉडकास्ट और हाल ही में शुरू किए गए एक विश्वकोश के रूप में विकसित हुए हैं।

विकल्प A, C और D (एक विश्वकोश, एक वेबसाइट, और एक मुद्रित लेख) सभी उन प्रकार की सामग्री हैं जो प्रसंग में व्यंग्य के रूप में वर्णित कार्यक्रमों से जुड़ी हैं। फिल्म, हालांकि, प्रसंग में उल्लेखित नहीं है और उस प्रकार की सामग्री के रूप में नहीं वर्णित है।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, police kiss cheez ki hifaazat kar rahi thee?","The correct answer is **D: Azeem Connaught kmaron ka hotel**.

Here's why:

* The text states the protest started at the entrance to the Prime Minister's official residence (Wazir-e-Azam ki sarkari rehaish).
* It then mentions the protesters moved towards Trafalgar Square and passed by the Grand Connaught Rooms hotel, where the Conservative party was holding the Spring Forum.
* Given the context of the protest starting at the Prime Minister's residence and moving towards a significant political event (the Spring Forum), the police were most likely safeguarding the hotel where the Conservative party was meeting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Trafalgar morabbah:** While the protest passed by Trafalgar Square, the text doesn't indicate that the police were directly protecting Trafalgar Square itself.
* **B: Spring Forum:** The Spring Forum is the event being held at the hotel, not something the police were protecting directly. They were protecting the location of the event.
* **C: Neechey jaati galee ka dakhli rastah:**  This is irrelevant to the protest's route and the core reason for the police presence.



"
Kiss waqt police ney mozahereen sey tarteeb sey chalney ko kahaa thaa takehh mazeed traffic ki tameer sey bacha ja sakey?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 bajey**.

The text states: ""11:20 bajay police nay ehtejajiyon say kahaa kehh woh sadak chhod karr foot paath parr muntaqil ho jayein..."" (At 11:20, the police told the protestors to leave the road and move to the footpath...).
"
Dr. Ehud Ur ki jaanib sey ki gayi tahqiq key baarey mein kiya sahee hay?,"The correct answer is **B: kuchh sabiqah diabetes waaley choohey abb mazeed diabetes waaley nahein hein.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""abb hamare paas gair ziyabis waale 4 mahinay kee umar key choohay hain jinhein shoogar hojaya karta thaa."" (We now have 4-month-old non-obese mice who used to have diabetes.)
* The text continues: ""Holifex, nova scotia kee dalhozi university mein tib key professor aur canadian diabetic aisosi aishan key tibbee wo sciency division key sadar doctor aihud yuaar nay mutanabbah kiya hay kehh tehqeeq abhi tak apnay ibtadayi marahil mein hay."" (Professor Ehud Yuaar, a professor of medicine at Dalhousie University in Halifax, Nova Scotia, and head doctor of the medical and scientific division of the Canadian Diabetic Association, has warned that the research is still in its early stages.)
* Importantly, it mentions: ""...unhein iss baaray mein shakk hay kehh aaya diabetes kaa elaaj kiya jaa sakta hay, iss baat ko note kartay hoay kehh inn nataij .kee aise logon say koyee mutabiqat nahein hay jo pehle say type 1 diabetas mean mubtala hain."" (...they doubt that type 2 diabetes can be cured, noting that these results are not comparable to people who already have type 1 diabetes.)

Therefore, the mice that *used to* have diabetes are *no longer* diabetic. Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yehh natayej pahley sey mojud type 1 diabetes key mareezon keliye fayedah mand ho saktey hein** - The text specifically says the results are *not* comparable to type 1 diabetes patients.
* **C: Wohh pur ummid hay kehh tahqiqaat eek elaaj kaa sabab ban skati hay** - Professor Yuaar *doubts* that a cure is possible, indicating it's not yet a confirmed hope.
* **D: kuchh gair diabetes waaley choohey abb diabetes waaley hein** - The text says the mice are *non-obese* and *used to have* diabetes, not that they *became* diabetic.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Dr. Ur Shakki key baarey mein kiya hay?","The correct answer is **B: Agar koyi elaaj mumkin ho (If a cure is possible)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuchh doosray mahireen kee tarah say, unhein iss baaray mein shakk hay kehh aaya diabetes kaa elaaj kiya jaa sakta hay..."" This directly translates to: ""Like some other experts, **they doubt that type 2 diabetes can be cured**...""  Therefore, Dr. Ur doubts the possibility of a cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar tahqiqaat type 1 diabetes waley logon key liye mtalliqah hein (If the research is relevant to people with type 1 diabetes):** While the passage mentions Type 1 diabetes, Dr. Ur's doubt isn't specifically about Type 1. It's a more general doubt about whether *any* diabetes can be cured.
* **C: Elaaj key baarey mein deegar mahereen key nazriyaat (The opinions of other experts about a cure):**  The passage compares Dr. Ur's opinion to other experts, but Dr. Ur's opinion itself is about the possibility of a cure.
* **D: Agar gair diabetes waaley choohey usee trah baqi rahein (If non-diabetic mice remain the same):** This is irrelevant to Dr. Ur's doubt about a cure.



"
Konsa darjahg zail bayaniyah durust tor parr parwaaz CG4684 key tasaadum ki wazahat karta hay?,"The best answer is **D: Sayyarah key tabaahi key maqaam ki talaash mosam sey motassir hui thee.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Kharab mausam kee wajah say jo landing key mansukhi kaa sabab banaa talashi key kaam mein khalal padaa."" This translates to ""Bad weather caused disruption to the search efforts for the intended landing site.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mosam ki wajah sey sayyarah asal mein lend karney key qabil nahein thaa:**  The text doesn't say the weather made landing *impossible*. It just disrupted the search for the crash site.
* **B: Sayyarah eek bahut door key mahalley waqoo mein girkar tabaah hua thaa:** The text says the crash site was *located*, not that the plane crashed in a remote area.
* **C: Tabaah honay sey pahley sayyarah ney teen baar lend karney ki koshish ki thee:** The text says the plane attempted landing *twice* before disappearing.

Therefore, option D is the only one directly supported by the information in the provided text.



"
kiss wajah sey parwaaz CG4684 ney apni lending ko saaqit kar diya thaa?,"Correct Answer: **D: Mosam ki surate haal kharab thee**

The text explicitly states: ""Kharab mausam kee wajah say jo landing key mansukhi kaa sabab banaa talashi key kaam mein khalal padaa."" This translates to ""Due to bad weather, which caused disruption to the search work scheduled for landing.""

While the landing site was inaccessible (A), the primary reason the landing was aborted was the bad weather. Options B and C are not mentioned in the text.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, Franciszek Kowal key tajrabah key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee hay?","The correct answer is **A: Usney kisi tarah darichah ko tod diya thaa.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zindah bach jaaney waale franceszeek koval nay bataya kehh khidki key sheeshon mean say eek aakhir kaar toot gayaa aur unhon nay khidki say nikalna shuroo kiya.""  This translates to: ""The surviving Franceszek Kowal said that finally one of the window panes broke and he started climbing out of the window.""

This directly indicates that he broke a window pane to escape.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bilaakhir usko noqsan nahein pahuncha thaa:**  The passage doesn't say he wasn't harmed.  He had to break a window to escape, implying some risk.
* **C: Bahar nikalney ki koshihs ke doraan usney eek kursi tod dee thee:** The passage mentions people using chairs to hit window frames, but it doesn't say *he* broke a chair.
* **D: Eek darichah ko todney ki koshish key doraan wohh zakhmi ho gaya thaa:** The passage doesn't say he was injured while trying to break the window.



"
Surataani toofan Danielle key mumkanah asar ki paimaesh karna challenge ka kaam keon thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Toofan landfall sey door hay**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chonkeh toofan land fall say bahut door hay, iss liye riyasathaye muttahedah yaa caribean key mumkanah asraat kaa andazah lagana mushkal lag rahaa hay."" This translates to: ""Because the storm is far from landfall, it is difficult to estimate the possible effects on the United States or the Caribbean.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Toofan key baarey mein pesheen goyi kee gayee kehh mazboot hokar wohh samundari toofan ban jaye gaa:**  The passage says the *prediction* is that the storm *could* become a hurricane, not that it *has* become a hurricane.  The difficulty is in assessing potential *impact*, not its classification.
* **B: Saencedaan toofan key barqaraar hawaon key baarey mein pur yaqeen nahein hein:** The passage doesn't say scientists are uncertain about the storm's sustained winds.  It focuses on the *distance* from land.
* **D: Toofan Miami sey bahut door waqea hay:** While Miami is mentioned as a point of reference, the distance from land is the key factor.  The problem isn't *where* it's located, but *how far* it is from the coast.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, surtaani toofan Danielle key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniya sahee naein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Yehh landfall sey qareeb hay (It is close to landfall)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Woh toofan jis kaa mahlle waqoo miyami, florida say 3000 meal door hay..."" (That storm, which is 3000 miles from Miami, Florida...).  This clearly indicates the storm is *far* from the coast, not close to landfall.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Caribbean parr iska asar na maloom hay (Its effect is unknown on the Caribbean):** The passage says that because the storm is far from land, it's difficult to assess potential impacts on the US or Caribbean. So, its effect on the Caribbean is currently unknown.
* **B: Iski tashkeel Bahre Atlantic mein hui thee (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean):** The passage states that the Denial storm formed in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean within the ocean.
* **C: Yehh eek samundari toofan mein badal sakta hay (It can develop into a tropical storm):** The passage mentions that scientists predict Denial could strengthen into a tropical storm by Wednesday.



Therefore, only option D contradicts the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aalimi wabaa paida karnay say pehle beemari key saath kiya honay ki tajweez dee gayee hay?","The correct answer is **A: Isey lazmi tor parr kam mohlik hona zaruri hay** (It is necessary for the disease to be necessarily less lethal).

The passage states: ""Unhon nay kahaa kehh kuchh mutaliat batatay hain kehh iss beemari ko aalimi wabaa paida karnay say pehle lazmi tor parr kam jaan leva honaa chahiye."" which translates to ""They said that some studies suggest that this disease should have necessarily been less lethal before the global pandemic.""

Therefore, the disease should have been less lethal before the pandemic.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, toofan Fujian sey kitna door thaa?","The correct answer is **D: 77 kilometer**.

Here's why:

The question states the storm was approximately 70 kilometers away from the military at dawn. It was moving *towards* Fujian at 11 kilometers per hour.  Therefore, to find the distance *from* the storm to Fujian, we need to add the distance the storm traveled to the initial distance.

70 km (initial distance) + 11 km/hour * time (we don't need to calculate time here because the question asks for the distance from Fujian, not how long it will take to reach it) = 77 km
"
George W. Bush key Asia pahuchney parr kisney unko mobarkbaad dee thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng aur Lee Hsien Loong**.

The passage states: ""Uss kaa isteqbal singapore key naib wazir aazam Wong kaan saing kee jaanib say kiya gayaa aur singapore key wazir aazam lie seen long key saath tejarat aur dehshat gardi key omur parr baat cheet huyee.""  This means both Wong Kan Seng (Deputy Prime Minister) and Lee Hsien Loong (Prime Minister) welcomed him.
"
Asia kee tejarati tausee key baarey mein sadar ney kabb baat ki thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Apni wast muddati intekhaab ki haaron key baad**.

The passage states: ""Darmiyani madad key intekhabat mein haftay bhar shikast khaaney ke baad, bush nay nazireen ko asia mein tejarat mein tausee karnay key baaray mein bataya."" (After suffering defeat in the midterm elections, Bush spoke to observers about expanding trade in Asia.)

Therefore, the president discussed trade expansion in Asia *after* the midterm election losses.
"
"Ebarar key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey konsa hukumat ka majmooyi maqsad hay?","The correct answer is **D: Zarurat sey ziaydah gaadiyon ki bheed ko kam karna** (To reduce the overcrowding of vehicles).

Here's why:

* The passage states the government is expanding its efforts to fund additional vehicles **to alleviate overcrowding** (""bheed bhaad ko rafaa karnay keliye"").  
* While options A, B, and C describe specific numbers of vehicles, they don't capture the overarching *reason* for the government's actions. The core goal is to reduce congestion.

Therefore, option D best reflects the government's overall objective as stated in the passage.
"
Hukumat ney kiya elaan kiya thaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Unka ezafi 1,300 gaadiyon ko fund karney ka mansubah hay**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Mazeed 300 coach kee khareed say bheed bhaad ko rafaa karnay key liye khareede gaye dabbon kee mizaan 1300 ho gayee."" This translates to: ""With the purchase of an additional 300 coaches to alleviate overcrowding, the total number of purchased coaches has reached 1300.""
* Therefore, the government's plan is to fund an additional 1300 vehicles (coaches).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unka ezafi 300 gaadiyon ko fund karney ka mansubah hay** - This is only *partially* correct. It only mentions the 300 additional vehicles, but the passage clarifies the total is now 1300.
* **B: Gaadi key masalah sey raahat paaney ka unka azam hay** - While alleviating overcrowding is *a* goal, it's not the specific announcement made in the passage.
* **D: Zarurat sey ziyadah bheed ka masalah March tak hal ho jaye gaa** -  The passage doesn't state that the overcrowding problem will be solved by March. It only mentions the funding of additional vehicles.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi malumaat malum hay?","The correct answer is **A: Khatrey ki satah kam ho gayi hay (The level of danger has decreased).**

Here's why:

* The sentence explicitly states: ""khatray kee satah ko shadeed zumray say kam karnay kaa matlab yeah nahein hay kehh majmuyi tor parr khatra door ho gayaa hay"" which translates to ""Reducing the level of danger from a severe level does not mean that the danger has completely disappeared.""

* This clearly indicates that while the danger has lessened, it hasn't been eliminated entirely.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Abb aur koyi khatrah nahein hay (There is no danger anymore):** This is directly contradicted by the sentence.
* **C: Eek hamlah ki tawaqqo hay (An attack is expected):** The sentence says the attack is *not* immediately expected.
* **D: Intelligence ney tasdeeq ki hay kehh hamlah sakht hogaa (Intelligence has confirmed that the attack will be severe):**  The sentence doesn't mention anything about the severity of a potential attack. It only speaks to the *level of danger*.



Therefore, only option A is supported by the provided text."
Mozaheron key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sadarati commisssion mozaheron ka jawaab thaa** (The Presidential Commission's response was the protests).

Here's why:

* The text clearly states the opposite. The Presidential Commission *issued a directive* for the premature dissolution of the CEP as part of a package to move the country towards new elections. It wasn't a response *to* the protests.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: Zaruri intekhabaat sey mozaherey bhadkey they** (Protests escalated from crucial elections) - The text says ""Intekhabat karaaney mean nakami nay waqti pur tashdduad muzahiron ko bhadkaya"" (Failure to hold elections led to timely violent protests).
* **C: Mozaheron mein saabiq CEP key istefaa kaa motalebah thaa** (The demand for the former CEP's resignation was in the protests) -  This is implied by the context. The CEP was dissolved prematurely, likely due to demands for the resignation of its members.
* **D: Mozaherey baaz auqaat purr tashaddud ho jatey they** (Protests sometimes became violent) - The text states that the government's response to protests was the Violence Suppression Commission, implying that protests *did* sometimes involve violence.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that directly contradicts the information provided in the text."
Akhri CEP key istefaa ki kisney tajweez dee thee?,"The correct answer is **C: Sadarati commission ney**.

The text states: ""Guzashta maah sadarati commission nay mulk ko nayey intekhabat kee jaanib lay jaaney key liye iqdamat key package key juzw key tor parr cep kee qabal az waqat subukdoshi kee tajweez dye.""  This translates to ""Last month, the Presidential Commission granted permission for the early dismissal of the CEP as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.""
"
"Bayaniyah ke hisaab sey, Ameriki Gymnastics ney khelaadiyon key saath Nassar ki badsoluki key baad kiskee moawanat nhein kee thee?","The correct answer is **C: Tanzeem mein zaruri tabdeeliyaan (Necessary changes in regulations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ham uss key iss biyaan say muttafiq hain kehh hamare khiladiyon aur unn key kalbon key mufadat kee behatar takmeel iss soorat mean ho sakti hai kehh hamm apni tanzeem hain baa maanee taggaiurat laayein beh nisbat iss key kehh certification ko laghu kiya jaye."" This translates to: ""We agree that the better fulfillment of the interests of our athletes and their legacies can be achieved if we make necessary changes to our regulations, specifically regarding the shortening of the certification.""

This implies that American Gymnastics *hadn't* implemented necessary changes to its regulations *prior* to the scandal, and the passage suggests this is a crucial step forward.  The other options are things American Gymnastics *did* or *supported*.



"
"Bayaniyah key hisaab sey, Ameriki Gymnastics aur Ameriki Olympic Committee dono key aagey badhney ka asal maqsad kia hay?","The correct answer is **D: Kheladiyon key liye eek mahfooz mahaul farog denaa**.

Here's why:

* The entire passage emphasizes the importance of a safe environment for athletes.  It mentions protecting athletes from harm, ensuring a positive environment, and fulfilling the needs of the Olympic family.
* While the passage *does* mention Larry Nassar's abuse and the need for clarification, that's presented as a contributing factor to the larger goal of athlete safety. The core aim is creating a safe environment.
* Options A, B, and C are more specific actions *related to* the overall goal of athlete safety, but option D encompasses the overarching purpose stated in the passage.



"
Hadsah key waqea honay key waqt jahaaz kiss traf pesh qadmi karr rhaa thaa? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Eek avenger cliss mine jehaaz ko jawabi tadbir deti hay, yeah jahaaz palawan mean pewarto prencisa mean apnay safar parr gamzan thaa."" This translates to ""An Avenger class mine ship gives a retaliatory measure to the vessel, which was en route to Palawan carrying the princess.""
"
Ebarat mein mazkoor jahaaz key baarey mein konsee sahee haqiqat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Yehh Puerto Princesa ki taraf apney raastey mein thaa** (It was on its way to Puerto Princesa).

Here's why:

The text states: ""A Avenger-class minehunter, which the ship was on its journey to Palawan..."" (A Avenger-class minehunter, which the ship was on its journey to Palawan...)  This means it *was going to* Palawan, not *on its way to* Puerto Princesa.  The text explicitly mentions Palawan.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B: Iskee bunyaad Palawan mein hay** (Its base is in Palawan):  The text says ""...the ship was on its journey to Palawan"" and  ""...its home port is Saigo, Nagasaki, Japan.""  While the journey is to Palawan, the home port is Nagasaki.  The phrasing is a bit confusing, but given the context, this is likely correct.
* **C: Yehh kaan kuni ka insedaad iqdamaat ka jahaaz hay** (It is an Avenger-class minehunter): The text directly states this: ""Yehh Avenger-class minehunter...""
* **D: Isey Ameriki bahriyah key saatvein bedaa ko tafweez kiyaa gayaa hay** (It is assigned to the US Seventh Fleet): The text clearly states: ""Isey US Navy ke saatwein bedah say munsalk kiyaa gayaa hay"" (It is affiliated with the US Seventh Fleet).



Therefore, only option A is definitively incorrect based on the text provided.



"
Kisney Ameriki faujiyon key baarey mein bayan diya thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**. 

The question asks who made the announcement about the American troops leaving Syria. The passage clearly states that ""amerika key sadar donald trump nay press secretary key zariah eek biyaan mean elaan kiya kehh ameriki fauj shaam chhod den gee"" which translates to ""US President Donald Trump announced through his press secretary that American troops would leave Syria.""
"
"Bayaan ke hisaab sey, kiss mulk ney qaidee ladaakon ki nigraani ka zimmah liya hay?","The correct answer is **D: Turkee**.

The text explicitly states: ""Turki ISIS key unn giraftar jang baazon ko bhee guard karay gaa jinn ko europi aqwam nay wapas lenay say inkaar kiya.""  (Turkey will also guard the captured ISIS fighters whom European nations refused to take back.)
"
Yaqeeni tor parr tasaadum ki kiya wajah hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Dushmani ki aag (Enemy fire)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""manna jaataa hay kehh dushmanon kee taraf say kee gayee goli baari kaa natijah hay"" which translates to ""it is believed that it is the result of enemy gunfire.""

The other options are factors hindering the search for the crash site, but not the *cause* of the crash itself.
"
Kiss qism key khittah mein tasaadum waqea hua thaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Pahaadi (Mountainous)**.

The text states: ""Haadsah oonchi pahadiyon key beech pesh aaya"" which translates to ""The incident occurred amidst high mountains."" 

While ""sakht"" (harsh/difficult) is also mentioned in the context of the terrain, the specific type of terrain is identified as ""pahadi"" (mountainous).
"
Sailaab key natijah key tor parr afsaraan kiya ummid thee?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandbarz kee bahaali** (Restoration of sandbars).

The passage states: ""Yeah telchhat gaad sandbarz aur saahil samundar bananay key liye zaruri thee..."" which translates to ""This sediment was necessary for creating sandbars and coastal seas...""  And later, ""...afsaran ko tawaqqo hay kehh yeah dhaar mean behh gaye ret key todah ko behaal karnay keliye kaafi hoga."" which means ""...officials expect that this flowed sediment will be enough to restore the sandbars in the channel.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   B: While coastal seas *are* created, the passage focuses on the sandbars.
*   C: The passage mentions the decline of humpback whales.
*   D: While sandbars *do* provide habitat for wildlife, the immediate expectation from the flood was sandbar restoration.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiss parr dam ki tameer mustaqil asar pada thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandbarz**.

The passage states: ""Yeah telchhat gaad sandbarz aur saahil samundar bananay key liye zaruri thee...""  This directly links the deposition of the silt (telchhat) to the formation of sandbars. The passage also mentions that sandbars are important habitats for wildlife.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Humpback chubs:** The passage states that two species of fish were negatively impacted, but it doesn't specifically link the construction to the humpback chubs.
* **C: Jangali zindagi ki rehaaesh gahein (Wildlife habitats):** While sandbars create habitats, the passage specifically says sandbars are *required* for them. The direct impact is on the sandbars themselves.
* **D: Telchat ka failao (Spread of silt):** While the silt spread is the *process*, the *effect* of that process is the formation of sandbars. The question asks about the *direct* effect.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney America ko mumkanah khatraat key baarey mein suraag diya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Eek giar Zahir Zariyah**.

The text states: ""U.S. key mutabiq usay eek poshidah zariye say malumat mosul hoyee hain jo khaas tor parr ethopia aur kenya mean """"numayan elaqon"""" ko tabaah karnay key liye khudkash bambaron ko istemaal karnay kee nishandahi karti hain."" This translates to ""According to the U.S., information was received through a confidential source that specifically indicates the use of suicide bombers to destroy the ""significant relationship"" between Ethiopia and Kenya.""

Therefore, the information came from a ""poshidah zariye"" (confidential source) which is referred to as ""ek giar Zahir Zariyah"" (a source named Zahir Zariyah).
"
Darjah zail bayaniyah mein sey kon durust tor parr shiddat pasandon key mobaiyyanah hamlah key mansubah ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Do mamaalik mein aham maqamat parr bam dhamakey (Bomb blasts at important locations in two countries).**

Here's why:

* The statement says that Somalia-based extremists are planning suicide bombings in **both Kenya and Ethiopia**.
* It also mentions the intention to target ""important locations"" (""aham maqamat"").

Therefore, option C accurately reflects both key elements mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek mulk mein bam dhamaka karna (Bomb blast in one country):**  The text clearly states attacks are planned in *two* countries.
* **B: Do mamaalik mein bam dhamakey (Bomb blasts in two countries):** This is too general. The text specifies targeting *important locations* within those countries.
* **D: Eek mulk mein bam dhamakey (Bomb blast in one country):** Again, the text specifies multiple countries.



"
Darjah zail logon mein sey kon wakeel nahein hay,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are famous Greek lawyers who have been imprisoned for bribery and abuse of power.
* Petros Mantouvalos was a Member of Parliament who was dismissed due to bribery and corruption. While he was a politician, the text doesn't specify he was a lawyer.
* Makis Triantafylopoulos is a journalist who revealed the information about the corruption. He is not mentioned as a lawyer in the text.

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only person on the list who is not identified as a lawyer in the provided text.
"
Yunani qanooni community mein scandal kaa hissah honay key tor parr logon ki kiss jamaat kaa tazkarah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Journalist**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions the scandal involving lawyers, solicitors, and attorneys in the Greek legal community. While the journalist, Makis Triantafillopoulos, *exposed* the scandal, he is not described as being *part of* the scandal itself. He is the one who brought it to light. The other options (solesters, judge, and attorney) are all explicitly mentioned as being involved in or affected by the scandal.



"
Hindustan ney kitney wicket khoye they,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""Leakin captain kee wicket garnay key baad india nay faqat 36 runn banaa karr **7 wiktein gunwa karr** innings kaa khaatima kiya."" This translates to ""But after losing the captain's wicket, India only scored 36 runs and **lost 7 wickets** in their innings.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, uss paari ka sabsey ziyadah score kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: 70 run**.

The passage states: ""Raabin Uthappa nay 2 chhakkon aur 11 chokon key zariye sirf 41 gaindon mean 70 runn key saath inning kaa sab say badaa score banaya."" This directly translates to ""Raabin Uthappa made the highest score in the innings with 70 runs in just 41 balls with 2 sixes and 11 fours."" Therefore, 70 runs was the highest score of the innings.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Adam Cuerden ki mayoosi ki wajah nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Jinsi mashmool key baarey mein site ki nayi policy** (New site policy regarding sexual content).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states Adam Cuerden's frustration with:

*   **Wales lying from the beginning:** ""uss [wells] nay darr asl shuroo say hee ham say jhoot bolaa.""
*   **The manner of the removals:** ""iss tarah key aqdaam karkay jaisay yeah qanuni wajuhaat say ho. dosray number purr, yeah zahir karkay kehh woh hamaari baat sun rehaa hay, bilkul apnay hazaf karnay key funn kee tarah."" (Actions taken as if they had legal grounds, and claiming to listen to them while removing content).
*   **The ambiguity surrounding the content removal policy:** ""Muashiray mean uljhan kee wajah say maqaam key liye jinsi mawaad key hawalay se aisi policy tayaar karnay kee maujudah koshishein hoyein jo laakhon khalay aam licence yaaftah media kee mezbani karti hay."" (Due to confusion in the guidelines, existing efforts to prepare a policy regarding sexual content for the site, which hosts millions of commonly licensed media.)

While the new policy is mentioned as a source of confusion, Adam Cuerden's main frustration stems from the actions and communication surrounding the *removal* of content, not the policy itself. He is upset *how* content is being removed, and the deceptive way it is being justified.

Therefore, **A** is the option that *least* contributes to Adam Cuerden's feelings of disappointment.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, site sey kiya hazaf kar diya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: jinsi mashmool (sexual material)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Muashiray mean uljhan kee wajah say maqaam key liye jinsi mawaad key hawalay se aisi policy tayaar karnay kee maujudah koshishein hoyein..."" This translates to: ""Due to confusion in the public sphere, current efforts are being made to prepare such a policy regarding sexual material for the purpose of the position...""

The passage also mentions the difficulty in creating a policy about sexual material due to the vast number of licensed media outlets.  Therefore, the item being removed (or the subject of removal efforts) is sexual material.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiskee Amir Khan himayat nahein kartey?","The correct answer is **A: Olympics mein khawateen ladakon ko shaamil karnaa (Including women in combat sports at the Olympics)**.

Here's why:

* The text clearly states that Amir Khan said, ""Personally, I think women should not fight. This is my point of view."" 
* This directly indicates his opposition to women participating in combat sports.
* He *does* say he will support British opponents at the 2012 Olympics in London.
* There's no information provided to suggest he has an opinion on women's opinions or hosting the Olympics in London.

Therefore, based on the provided text, Amir Khan does not support including women in combat sports at the Olympics.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiskee apney zaati nazriyah key bawajood Amir Khan himayat kar rahey hongein?","The correct answer is **C: 2012 Olympics**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that despite Amir Khan's personal opinion *against* women competing, he stated he would support the British competitors in the 2012 Olympics. 
* The question asks *who* would support women *despite* his personal opinion. The passage explicitly links his support to the 2012 Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khawateen ladakey (Women boys):** This is incorrect. The passage is about Amir Khan's views on women competing, not about boys.
* **B: 2004 key Olympics key unkey saathi hareef (His teammates and rivals from the 2004 Olympics):** The passage doesn't mention the 2004 Olympics or anyone from it.
* **D: Deegar chaandi key medal yaftagaan (Other silver medalists):** While Amir Khan himself won a silver medal, the passage doesn't suggest other silver medalists would support women despite his view. It focuses solely on his stated position regarding the 2012 Olympics.



"
Peter Lenz ki wafaat kabb hui thee?,"The correct answer is **B: Apni bike sey girney key baad** (After falling off his bike).

The text states: ""Jab woh apnay warm up key dorah parr thaa leans apni bike say girr padaa aur phir woh apnay muqabilah karnay waale saathi zeveer ziyaat say takra gayaa."" (When he was on his warm-up lap, he fell off his bike and then collided with his competitor Zeveer Ziaat.)

While he was on the warm-up lap, the crucial event leading to his death was the fall from his bike. Therefore, the death occurred *after* falling.
"
Zeveer ziyaat kon hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek deegar daud laganey walaa (Another racer)**.

The passage states: ""phir woh apnay muqabilah karnay waale saathi zeveer ziyaat say takra gayaa.""  This translates to ""then he collided with his competitor, Zeveer Ziyaat.""  Therefore, Zeveer Ziyaat is another motorcycle racer.
"
Eek sayyarah key dakhli kaamon ko samajhney sey mumkanah tor parr fayedah haasil karney walaa prishaan parwaaz karney walaa kis haalt mein hoga?,"The correct answer is **B: Aya udaan ka unkaa darr namaloom cheez key darr key aas paas markooz hay.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the fear of airplanes is often rooted in a fear of the unknown and a lack of control. 
* The question asks about a traveler who might benefit from understanding the inner workings of an airplane. This suggests the traveler's fear stems from not understanding *how* the plane works and therefore feeling a lack of control over the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aya mosaafir unkey darr sey sharmindah hein (The traveler is ashamed of their fear):**  The passage says it's okay to have this fear, so shame isn't necessarily the core issue.
* **C: Aya mosaafir tamaam qism key transportation key khilaaf hein (The traveler is against all forms of transportation):** The passage specifically focuses on airplane fear.
* **D: Aya takleef dahh hadsaat sey tanee unki parishaani udaan sey motalliqah nahein hay (The traveler's trouble is solely related to accidents and not the flight itself):** While accidents contribute to fear, the passage emphasizes the fear of the *unknown* aspects of flying, not just accidents.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kisey qimat sey aagah mosaafir ko akhir mein karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Motaddid travel companiyon key darmiyaan qimaton ka mowaznah karey (Compare prices between multiple travel companies)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes price comparison:** The entire passage revolves around the idea that prices can vary greatly between different airlines and websites. It explicitly advises comparing prices *before* booking.
* **B is incorrect:** The passage states that booking with a single, direct airline isn't always the cheapest option.
* **A is too broad:** While searching multiple travel companies is good, the passage's main point is the comparison *between* them.
* **D is important but secondary:** Checking the airline's website is a good step, but it's best done *after* comparing prices from different companies to ensure you're getting the best deal.

Therefore, comparing prices between multiple travel companies is the most important step for a price-conscious traveler, according to the provided text."
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, mosaafiron ko behtareen mumkanah parwaaz ki qimaton ko mahfooz karney key liye sabsey pahley kiya karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Mukhtalif jamaa kunindagaan key darmiyaan qimaton ka mowaznah karein (Compare prices between different aggregators)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Baaz auqaat eek hee flight kee mukhtalif web site parr bahut mukhtalif qeematein ho sakti hain...search nataij kaa mowaznah karein..."" (Sometimes, on the same flight, different websites can have very different prices... compare search results...).

While checking the airline website (A) is good, and booking with a direct airline (C) can be beneficial, the *first* and most crucial step to finding the best price is to compare prices across various websites/aggregators (B). The paragraph emphasizes this as a key benefit.  Option D (booking through a travel agent) isn't directly mentioned or emphasized in the text.
"
Kabb kisi saathi ko kisi tarseel key saath jaana darkaar hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Jabb cheezein maal bardaar jahaaz key zariyah bheji jayein**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""air line key zuabit musafir key baghair saamaan bhejnay kee ejazat nahein den gay."" This means that when goods are shipped via air cargo, a designated passenger is required. This aligns directly with option A.

The other options are not mentioned or implied in the passage:

* **B: Jabb company apney khud key sayyarey istemaal karey:**  The passage doesn't discuss companies using their own aircraft.
* **C: Jabb cheezein check kardah samaan key tor parr bheji jaa rahi hon:** The passage doesn't mention checked goods.
* **D: Jabb tarseel ko koyi badi company sanbhaal rahi ho:** The passage doesn't discuss the responsibility of a port being handled by a large company.

"Ebaarat ki buniyaad parr, kisi ittehaad mein aksar parwaaz karney waali kisi airline ka intekhaab kartey waqt, darjah zail mein sey kisko tarjeeh dena chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Wohh airaline jsmein ezaafi reaayaton ka shaamil honaa mumkin ho (The airline that offers additional benefits)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes *caution* when choosing an airline within an alliance. It explicitly states that benefits vary and points earned on one airline within the alliance can be more advantageous if used on another airline within the same alliance.  Therefore, the focus should be on the overall benefits and flexibility offered by the airline's membership in the alliance, not just the number of points or the airline you fly with most often.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Sabsey ziyadah points peshkash karney waali airline (Airline offering the most points):** While points are important, the passage highlights that points aren't always directly comparable across alliance partners.
* **B: Baday ittehaad waali airline (Airline in a large alliance):**  Alliance size isn't the key factor; it's the specific benefits *within* that alliance.
* **C: Jiss airline sey aap bahut ziyadah safar kartey hein (Airline you travel with most often):** This contradicts the passage's advice to be cautious and consider benefits beyond just frequent flying on a single airline.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kon ziyadah tarr parwaaz karney waley ki points ki peshkash kar sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mukhtalif ittehaad mein eek mukhtalif airline**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ziyadah safar karnay walon key point eek hee air line ittehad key taht kisee doosri air line key ziyadah fayyazana ho saktay hain.""  This translates to: ""Points from frequent flyers within the same airline alliance can be more beneficial to another airline within that alliance.""

This means that points earned on one airline within an alliance might be more valuable when used with a *different* airline within the same alliance.  Therefore, a combination of different airlines within the same alliance offers the most flexibility and potential benefit for frequent flyers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Usi ittehaad key taht aapki sabsey ziyadah safar ki jaaney waali airline:**  The passage specifically warns against this, stating that points might not be as advantageous if limited to one airline within an alliance.
* **C: Mukhtalif ittehaad mein aapki sabsey ziyadah safar ki jaaney waali airline:** This isn't mentioned or implied in the text. The focus is on airlines *within the same alliance*.
* **D: Usi ittehaad andar eek mukhtalif airline:** While technically true (within the same alliance), it doesn't highlight the *potential benefit* of leveraging points across different airlines within the alliance, which is the key takeaway from the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail hawaas mein sey kon bahut ziyadah sharaab key istemaal sey maazoor ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Dekhna (Seeing)**.

The text states that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to **thak kehh basarat say mahrumi**, which translates to blindness. Therefore, the ability to see is directly related to the potential harm of excessive alcohol use.
"
"Ebarat mein bayan karney key motabiq, sharaab key noqsan dahh asaraat ko maharat key saath kiya cheez kam kar sakti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Etedaal key saath sharaab noshi karna** (Drinking alcohol in moderation).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Alcohal kee mashrubaat motadil tor parr pijiye."" which translates to ""Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation.""  It also emphasizes the importance of knowing one's limits. The passage then goes on to describe the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption.  Therefore, moderation (etidal) is presented as the key to minimizing the negative effects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sharaab noshi methanol key saath karna** (Drinking alcohol with methanol): This is a *cause* of harm, not a way to *minimize* harm.
* **B: Piney sey mobayyanah tor parr roohein tayyar hoti theen** (Spirits are clearly prepared from drinking): This is a restatement of what alcohol is made from, not a way to reduce its negative impacts.
* **D: Mukhtalif logon key saath pinaa** (Drinking with different people): The passage doesn't connect drinking with different people to a reduction in harm.



"
Amsterdam ki aala key darmiyaan property ki qadrein kahaan hein?,"The correct answer is **A: Kanaal Zilaa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Amsterdam key darmiyaan property ki qadrein **Kanaal Zilaa** 17vein sadee kaa mashhur zilaa hay..."" which translates to ""In the middle of Amsterdam, property prices are in the **Canal District**, a famous district of the 17th century...""
"
Keon kanal zilaa ko UNESCO key aalami warsah site key tor parr namzad kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Yehh munfarid khosusiyaat hein (These are unique characteristics)**.

The passage states that the Amsterdam canal district (Grachtengordel) is nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage site *because* of its unique culture and historical significance. Option B directly reflects this reasoning.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Yehh tarikhee aur saqafati qadar hay (This is historical and cultural value):** While true, it's too general. Option B is more specific to *why* it was nominated.
* **C: Binnenstad key gard nawah ka mahalley waqoo hay (The inner city's ring of canals is located):** This is a statement of fact, not the reason for UNESCO nomination.
* **D: Aala khosusiyat ki qasar hay (It is a castle of high special characteristics):** This is incorrect and doesn't align with the description of the canal district.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon qabiley qasar Phnom Krom ka daurah karata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Tonle Sap parr nzarah**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kashti key zariye jheel kaa safar karnay key zariye aasani key saath site kaa dorah kiya jaa sakta hay."" (You can easily tour the site by boat on the lake.)

While options B, C, and D are all related to visiting Phnom Krom, the text specifically highlights the view *of Tonle Sap Lake* as a key feature and a way to experience the site.  The other options are requirements or activities *related* to the visit, not the specific experience highlighted in the text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Phnom Krom mein dakhil honay keliye daurah karney walon ko kiya darkaar hay?","The correct answer is **C: Angkor Pass parr pahunchnaa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mandir mean daakhil honey key liye angcor paas zaruri hay."" (To enter the temple, an Angkor Pass is necessary.)
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Antarctica ka daurah karney sey kisi sayyaah ko darjah zail mein sey kon rok sakta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Mahdud jismaani naqlo hamal (Limited physical fitness)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Syyahon key doray mahnge hain, aur jismani tandruasti kaa taqazah kartay hain..."" which translates to ""Tourist tours are expensive, and they demand physical fitness..."" 

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Bahut ziyadah safar ka bajat (Very high travel budget):** While the passage mentions expensive tours, it also mentions that it's *physical fitness* that is demanded.
* **B: Ross Sea ko daryaaft karney ki tanha dilchaspi (Sole interest in reaching the Ross Sea):**  The passage mentions that tours are limited to coastal areas, islands, and the Ross Sea area, but it doesn't make Ross Sea the primary obstacle for tourists.
* **C: Kaam ki eek miqaat bandi jiss sey December aur janwari mein safar karney ki ijazat milti hay (Work schedule that allows travel in December and January):** The passage says tours are limited to the warmer months (December and January), but it doesn't mention work schedule as a restrictive factor for tourists.



Therefore, the passage directly links tourist travel to physical fitness, making ""Mahdud jismaani naqlo hamal"" the most accurate answer.



"
Pahaad chadhney mein dilchaspi rakheny wala eek sayyaah Antartica key kiss hissey ka daurah kar sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Ross Sea**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that penguins are found "" sirf november- farvori key mausam garma mean hosaktay hain, aur woh bhee jazirah numma elaqay, jazeeray aur raas samundar key elaqay thak mahdud hain.""  This means penguins are only present in coastal areas during the warmer months.
* The passage specifically mentions the **Ross Sea** as one of the coastal areas where penguins are found. 
* The passage also mentions ""Jazeerah numaa elaqay"" and ""Jazeeray"" as suitable for penguins, so these are also potential locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zameen key andar ka elaqah (Interior region):** The passage describes the interior as a barren plateau with thick ice, making it unsuitable for tourists, especially climbers.
* **C: Jazeerah numaa (Coastal regions):** While coastal regions are suitable, the Ross Sea is a specific and named coastal area.
* **D: Jazeerey (Islands):** Islands are a part of the coastal region, and therefore the Ross Sea, but the Ross Sea is a more precise location mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, the Ross Sea is the most accurate and directly supported answer.
"
Tajdid sey pahley ki rasad gaah kam az kam kahaan waqea ho sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Kisi door key mahalley waqoo mein (In remote areas)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Door daraaz elaqon mean beshtar jadded tehqiqi doorbeen kee maahaul dost halaat key saath zabardast sahuliyaat mojud hain."" This translates to: ""In remote areas, there are greater facilities with modern research microscopes in environmentally friendly conditions.""

The passage also implies that before ""Tajdid"" (renewal/revival), access to these resources was limited to more accessible locations, meaning remote areas would have had fewer facilities. Options A, B, and D are all locations that would likely have had better access *after* the renewal.



"
Jadid tahqiq ka telescope mumkanah tor parr kahaan rakhaa hua hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek university campus parr (On a university campus)**.

Here's why:

The passage says: ""Door daraaz elaqon mean beshtar jadded tehqiqi doorbeen kee maahaul dost halaat kee saath zabardast sahuliyaat mojud hain."" This translates to: ""In remote areas, there are better facilities with new research telescopes and environmentally friendly conditions.""

The passage also states that older telescopes are preserved in ""ajayeb ghar (houses of wonders)"" or ""taleemi maqamat (educational institutions).""

Therefore, the new research telescopes are more likely to be found on university campuses or other educational institutions equipped for research.  Option B fits this context best.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek khamush sahiley samudar key dinn key liye konsa elaqah sabsey behtar hay?","The answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The passage states that St Heliers is one of the ""sab say ziyadah pasandidah teen elaqon"" (most preferred three areas). While it mentions that some beaches in the area can be crowded, the description of St Heliers is generally more aligned with a ""khamosh sahiley samudar key dinn key liye"" (quiet beach day) than the other options.

* **Mission Bay:** Described as being ""balamandi key mozafat mean"" (adjacent to the bustle) and having many shops, suggesting it's often lively.
* **Shumali Harbor zilaa:** Described as having beaches ""parr waaqa hay aur...bahr auqianoos parr waaqa hay"" (located on the coast and...on the ocean), indicating a larger and potentially busier area.
* **Waitemata Harbor:** The passage refers to it as a wider area (a harbor) rather than a specific beach location, and focuses on its significance for development.

St Heliers, being one of the preferred areas, likely offers a better balance of beauty and tranquility, making it the best choice for a quiet beach day.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, tairaaki ki sharaaet mumkanah tor parr sabsey ziyadah mahfooz kahaan hein?","The answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...devenport thak phaila hay. woh taqriban saare reteelay saahil hain jo teraki key liye mahfuz hain, aur ziyadah tarmein saayah hota hay jo kehh pohotkawa key darakht farahim karta hay. Yahaan terna mahfuz hay.""

This directly translates to: ""...Devonport extends from the north to the south. They are almost all sandy beaches reserved for development, and mostly shaded by pohutukawa trees. Swimming is safe here.""

The passage explicitly mentions that swimming is safe in Devonport, making it the safest option among the choices. While the North Harbor and Central Auckland are mentioned as having beaches, there's no direct statement confirming swimming safety. The Long Bay is described as a bay, not a specific location where safety is guaranteed.
"
Ebarat mein wazahat kardah mahalley waqoo ka daurah kartey waqt darjah zail mein sey kisko namonasib samjha jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mazaaq karnaa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly warns against making fun of the Holocaust and the Nazis. Option C, ""Mazaaq karnaa"" (Making fun), directly addresses this warning.

Let's look at why the other options are less appropriate:

* **A: Adakari ki pokhtagi (Acting skills):** This is irrelevant to the passage's message.
* **B: Site key ird-girr kisi jagah ki nishandahi ko chod dena (Leaving a mark on a place nearby):**  While disrespectful, the passage emphasizes vandalism (graffiti) specifically.
* **D: Kisi saakhat ko khurachnaa (Scratching a structure):** This is a form of vandalism and is mentioned in the passage, but ""making fun"" is a broader and more central concern highlighted in the warning.

Therefore, making fun of the Holocaust is the most inappropriate behavior according to the passage.



"
Inmein sey kon lingua frank zubanon ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Masnooyi (Artificial)**.

Here's why:

* **Lingua Franca** literally means ""common tongue"".  It refers to a language that develops out of necessity for communication between people who don't share a native language. These languages are often *created* (masnooyi) for this purpose.

Let's break down the other options:

* **Gair fitri (Non-natural):** While lingua francas are not ""natural"" languages in the sense of evolving organically, this term is too broad.  Many non-natural things exist.
* **Tamiraati (Constructed/Developed):** This is a close second, but ""masnooyi"" more directly emphasizes the *creation* aspect of a lingua franca.
* **Namiyaati (Spontaneous/Developed naturally):**  Lingua francas are the opposite of naturally developed languages. They are *created* for communication.



The text describes languages created specifically for the purpose of facilitating communication between people who speak different native languages - this is precisely what a lingua franca is. The term ""masnooyi"" best fits that description.



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr moavin zubaano ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Yehh aisi takhliqi zubanein hein jo Mukhtalif zubano key bolney walon key darmiyaan gaalib hein** (These are artificial languages that are prevalent among speakers of different languages).

Here's why:

* The provided text describes ""Augzelery zabanein"" (artificial languages) as created to facilitate communication between people who find it difficult to express themselves in other languages.  These languages are distinct from natural languages and have gained prominence due to certain reasons.
* Option D states that these languages are *prevalent among speakers of different languages*. While true to some extent, it doesn't accurately capture the *purpose* of artificial languages as described in the text. The text emphasizes their creation *to overcome communication barriers* between those who struggle with existing languages.
* Options A, B, and C align better with the description:
    * **A:**  Highlights the use of artificial languages to *ease communication* between those who can't readily understand each other.
    * **B:**  Acknowledges that artificial languages can be both *natural and constructed*.
    * **C:**  Emphasizes the *difficulties in communication* that artificial languages aim to improve.



Therefore, Option D is the least accurate in describing the essence of Augzelery languages as presented in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko kiss cheez ki padtaal karni chahiye agar cruise mausam sarmaa mein ho?","The correct answer is **C: Sharaet** (Conditions).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar mausam sarma mean shumali baltak paar kar rahay hain to keeban kaa maqaam chek karein, iss liye kehh barf say guzartay waqat intehayi wahshat naack aawaz hoti hay, jo daraati hain.""  This translates to: ""If you are crossing the northern Baltak in the winter season, check the condition of the cabin, because the sound of the snow passing can be extremely frightening.""

The subsequent sentence discusses crows in Saint Peter's Burg and the visa exemption for crow travelers, concluding with ""(sharaet kee padtaal karein)"" which means ""(check the conditions)"".

Therefore, the passage directly instructs travelers to **check the conditions** of their journey, particularly related to winter travel and possibly the cabin itself, implying checking the **sharaet**. The other options are not explicitly mentioned in the passage as needing verification during the winter cruise season.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar mosaafir ka cruise mosame garmaa mein ho, to wohh kiss sey bachney key qabil ho saktey hein?","The correct answer is **B: Baraf mein janaa (Going in the snow)**.

Here's why:

* The original text states that ""Agar mausam sarma mean shumali baltak paar kar rahay hain to keeban kaa maqaam chek karein, iss liye kehh barf say guzartay waqat intehayi wahshat naack aawaz hoti hay, jo daraati hain.""  This translates to: ""If you are crossing the northern Baltic Sea during winter, check the condition of the ice, because when going through the ice, there is an extremely frightening cracking sound, which is frightening.""

* The question asks what a traveler on a summer cruise can avoid.

* Therefore, going **in the snow** (or crossing the ice, which is associated with winter and snow) is what they can avoid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shahar mein waqt (Time in the city):** The text mentions Saint Petersburg as a place for leisure time.
* **C: Visa ki zaruriyaat (Visa requirements):** The text states that crows (presumably referring to travelers) are exempt from visa requirements, but this is not something a traveler *avoids* to *be safe*.
* **D: Saint Petersburg:** Saint Petersburg is a leisure destination mentioned, not something to be avoided.



"
Catalan ko aksar Barcelona mein alaamaton aur elanaat key liye keon istemaal kiya jataa hay?,"The best answer is **B: Yehh shahar ki pahli daftari zubaan thee (This language was the city's first official language).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Taham ziyadah tar nishanon kee taraf sirf katalani zubaan mean esharah kiya gayaa hay, keunkeh yeah zubaan qanoon key zariah pehli sarkari zubaan key tor parr tasleem kee gayee hay."" (Although most signs are in Catalan, because this language was declared the first official language by law.)

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Isko haspanavi sey ziyadah wasee paimaney parr samjha jataa hay (It is understood to a wider extent than Spanish):** While true, the text focuses on the *official* use, not just general comprehension.
* **C: Yehh Barcelona mein tarjihee zubaan hay (This is the preferred language in Barcelona):** The text states it's a *preferred* language, but the reason for its widespread use is its official status.
* **D: Metro aur deegar awami sahuliyaat ka ziyadah tarr Catalan bolney waaley shahri akasar w beshtar istemaal kartey hein (Most Catalan-speaking citizens frequently use it in the metro and other public facilities):** The text mentions Catalan use in the metro, but it also says that announcements about non-public incidents are in multiple languages, including English and Spanish.  This isn't the core reason for Catalan's prevalence on signs.



Therefore, option B directly addresses the reason provided in the text for the prevalence of Catalan on signs.
"
Darjah zail mein sey konsi zubaan Barcelona key Metro system key zariyah baqaedah elanaat key liye istemaal kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Angrezi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Metro mean aam ailanat sirf kataalan mean kiye jaatay hain, leakin gair mansubah band modakhilat say mutalliq ailanat khudsakhta nizam key zariah angrezi,spanish, arabi, francisi aur japani samet kayee zabanon mean kayey jaatay hain.""

This translates to: ""General announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan, but announcements related to disruptions are made automatically in English, Spanish, Arabic, French and Japanese.""
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsi sahuliyat ko mumkanah tor parr aala sirey ka bistar aur nashtah key zariyah tarjeeh nahein dee jaati hay?","The correct answer is **D: Tez WiFi (Tez WiFi)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes luxury and traditional elegance in the ""deluxe bed and breakfast"" concept. It highlights:

*   **Bedding:** Hand-stitched quilts, unique beds.
*   **Breakfast:** Local seasonal treats, host's special dishes.
*   **Setting:** Historical old buildings, well-maintained lawns, swimming pools.

While WiFi is a modern convenience, it doesn't align with the traditional and luxurious atmosphere the passage is describing. The other options (specialty menus, unique antique furnishings, and well-maintained gardens) all contribute to that feeling. Therefore, a fast WiFi connection would be the least prioritized amenity in this type of establishment.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kon purtayyush B&Bs key darmiyaan moqaabilah key asal point mein sey eek nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Asree sajawat (Historical decoration)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the core of high-end B&Bs revolves around:

*   **Bedding:**  Finding a very comfortable bed, potentially handmade or unique.
*   **Breakfast:** Offering local seasonal delicacies or the host's specialty dishes.
*   **Setting:**  A historic building with beautiful gardens and a swimming pool.

While historical decoration *can* contribute to the overall ambiance, it's not mentioned as a foundational element compared to the quality of the bed and breakfast itself (bedding and breakfast) and the setting. The other options (seasonal breakfast, high-quality bedding, and local food) are directly highlighted as key differentiators of luxury B&Bs.  Historical decoration is a *supporting* detail, not a core point of comparison.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah mein sey kisko 2022 mein Beijing mein munaqid nahein kiya jaye gaa?","The correct answer is **B: Taizicheng ki ski elaqah ki waqeaat** (Ski events in Zhangjiakou).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Deegar skiing events zhaang jayako (zhangjiakou) key taizi ching sky airiya mean munaqid hone gay"" - meaning other skiing events *will be held* in Zhangjiakou.  

The opening and closing ceremonies, and indoor ice events, *will* be held in Beijing.

Therefore, the only option that isn't mentioned as being held in Beijing is the skiing events in Zhangjiakou.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiss ki 2022 mein Beijing mezbaani karegaa?","The correct answer is **C: Mosame sarmaa ka Olympics (Winter Olympics)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Cheen kaa shehar Beijing 2022 key Olympic winter games kee mezbani karnay waala shehar ho gaa..."" which translates to ""The city of Beijing, China will host the 2022 Olympic Winter Games...""
"
Kiskey andar avian influenza key moahedah key aala tareen khatraat hein?,"The correct answer is **B: stan dariyon key saath kaam karney waaley log**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that ""Ziyadah ther logon nay aise afraad ko shaamil kiya hay jo murghi khaanah mean kaam kartay hain"" (Many more people have included those who work in poultry farms). While poultry workers are at risk, the text also says that ""mahireen toyoriyaat ko bhee kuchh khatra lahiq hay"" (experts consider poultry workers to be at some risk). This implies that people who work closely with livestock (like those dealing with birds, which includes poultry) are considered high risk.  Option B, ""stan dariyon key saath kaam karney waaley log"" (People who work with livestock), is the most accurate and encompassing answer based on the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Prindon parr nazar rakhney waley** (Bird keepers) - While relevant, the text focuses more on people working *with* birds in a commercial setting.
* **C: Murgee key kaam** (Chicken work) -  This is too narrow. The risk extends beyond just chicken farming.
* **D: Jo log pahley sey motassir hein** (Those who have already been affected) - This isn't the primary risk group; it's the people who are most *vulnerable* to getting infected.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa bayaniyah durrust tor parr bard flu ki wazahat kartaa hay?","The correct answer is **B: Parindon key moqabiley insaano mein mazeed cas ki report ki gayi hay (More cases have been reported in humans compared to birds).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Insaanon mean abhi thak hazaar muamile say bhee kam dekhay gaye hain, leakin inn mean say kuchh mohlik saabit hoay hain."" (So far, fewer than a thousand cases have been seen in humans, but some have proven fatal.)  This directly supports the idea that cases are being reported in humans, and some are serious.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sirf murgee key kaam ney flu ka moahidah kiyaa hay (Only working with chickens has identified the flu):** The passage mentions that people working with chickens have been included in studies, but it doesn't say *only* that work identified the flu. The flu is affecting birds and mammals generally.
* **C: Prndon ki nigraani karney waley motassir honay key khatrey parr hein (Those who monitor birds are at risk of being affected):** While the passage mentions that veterinarians are at risk, it doesn't say that bird monitors are specifically at risk.  It's a broader statement about veterinarians.
* **D: Insaano mein report kiye gaye tamaam cas muhlik ho gaye hein (All reported cases in humans have been fatal):** The passage explicitly states that *some* cases are fatal, but not *all*.

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the information provided in the passage.
"
Safed samundar–Baltic Canal kiss sey rabetah kartaa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic samundar aur Baltic samundar** (Arctic Sea and Baltic Sea).

The text states: ""Safed samandar - jheel onega, jheel ladoga aur Saint Peter's Burg key zariah, ziyadah ther driyaon aur jhelon key zariah baltak kinaal bahirah arctic ko bahirah baltak say jodti hay."" which translates to ""The White Sea - Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga and Saint Peter's Burg connect the White Sea through many rivers and lakes to the Baltic Sea.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism ki gaadi parr passport iss trah jamaa nahein kiya jaatey hein jaisey mosaafir ko modakhilat naa karnaa ho?","The correct answer is **A: Sayyarey (Airplanes)**.

The passage specifically mentions that conductors on night sleeper trains collect passports to avoid disturbing passengers' sleep. It implies that this practice doesn't happen on other types of vehicles where passengers are expected to be more mobile and have less need for uninterrupted sleep. Airplanes are a clear example of such a scenario. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Raat ki soney waali trainein (Night sleeper trains):** The passage explicitly states passports are collected on these trains.
* **C: Jahaaz (Airplanes):** The passage implies that passports aren't collected on airplanes.
* **D: Sarhad paar ki trainein (Cross-border trains):** The passage mentions passport checks on cross-border trains.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kuchh sarhad paar ki trainon parr aapki ID ki kabb jaanch ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Chalti train parr**.

The passage states: ""Kuchh sarhad paar rail gaadiyon mean chalti train mean muainah kiya jaataa hay..."" which translates to ""In some cross-border trains, checks are done while the train is running...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Train sey utarney key baad** - The passage explicitly mentions checks *while* the train is running.
*   **B: Aap key sonay key waqt** -  The passage mentions that a conductor might collect passports during sleep, but this isn't when the ID check happens. It's related to potential checks *during* the journey.
*   **C: Iski jaanch nahein hoti hay** - The passage clearly states that checks *do* happen on some trains.

Darjah zail mein sey konsey masalah ko Singapore key ziyadah garam elaqon mein qeaam key waqt bahut mumkanah tor parr uthaana hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Garam thakan jhelnaa (Enduring heat exhaustion)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that ""oonche elaqon"" (higher regions) near the equator experience ""hiddat (hamishah)"" - heat (always) and ""sakht dhoop"" - strong sun (rarely when the sky is clear). 
* This directly points to the problem of heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ghusaa hua honaa (Being trapped):** The passage doesn't mention any issues with being trapped.
* **B: Dukano tak rasaayi na hona (Inability to reach shops):** The passage explicitly states that ""tum yahaan aamad key baad koyee bhee cheez khareed saktay ho"" - you can buy anything after arriving here.
* **D: Gumm honaa (Getting lost):** The passage doesn't mention any issues with getting lost.



Therefore, the most logical problem to raise when establishing something in Singapore's hotter regions is the heat itself.
"
Kon Germani pastry khaaney sey bachney key liye chahat rakh sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sakht nut allergy walaa koyi shakhs**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that many German baked goods include almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Someone with a severe nut allergy would need to avoid these pastries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ziyadah umdah sahraon ko tarjeeh deney walaa koyi shakhs:**  This option is unrelated to the text. The text doesn't mention anything about preferring savoury food.
* **C: Chocolate napasand karney walaa koyi shakhs:** The text doesn't mention chocolate being a common ingredient.
* **D: Laziz zayeqon parr meethey zayeqon ko tarjeeh deney walaa koyi shakhs:** The text describes the pastries as delicious and sweet, so someone who prefers sweet flavors would likely enjoy them.



"
Kis juzw ko Germani pastry kaa season walaa unsur samjhaa jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Seb (Apple)**.

The text states: ""Fruit pastries aam hain, jinn mean tamaam saal pastries mean seb shaamil kiya jaataa hay..."" which translates to ""Fruit pastries are common, in which apple is included in pastries throughout the year..."" This indicates apples are the seasonal element in German pastries.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail mein sey kon eek bajat parr safar karney key liye sifaarish kardah noktah hogaa?","सही उत्तर है: **D: खाaney aur rehaees jaisey ikhrajaat ko kam karnaa**

**व्याख्या:**

प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि कम खर्च में यात्रा करने के लिए अपने खर्चों को कम करने का सुझाव दिया गया है। विकल्प D, ""खाने और आवास जैसे खर्चे कम करना,"" सीधे तौर पर इस सलाह से मेल खाता है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: अपने आसान कामों को करने के लिए तलाश करें:** यह काम करने का एक तरीका है, लेकिन कम खर्च करने का सीधे सुझाव नहीं देता।
*   **B: अपने आराम के स्तर के साथ नरम रहें:** यह अत्यधिक सामान्य है और विशेष रूप से कम खर्च पर यात्रा करने के बारे में नहीं बताता।
*   **C: लोगों से पैसे मांगें:** लेख इस तरह के व्यवहार को अस्वीकार्य मानता है।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, baut kam bajat parr safar karney mein kiskey paas mushkil waqt rahaa hogaa?","The correct answer is **A: Kisi challenge ka isteqbaal karney walaa koyi shakhs (Someone who embraces a challenge).**

Here's why:

The passage focuses on traveling cheaply, minimizing expenses, and finding ways to travel on a limited budget.  The implication is that someone taking on a challenge would be more likely to seek out these low-cost travel methods.  Facing a challenge often requires resourcefulness and a willingness to make sacrifices, aligning with the passage's theme of frugality in travel.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Sakht waqt ki rokawaton key begair walaa koyi shakhs (Someone without difficulties in tough times):** This is too general.  Everyone faces difficulties.
* **C: Safar key doraan baeed tor parr kaam karney ka mansubah bananey walaa koyi shakhs (Someone who intends to work remotely during travel):**  This isn't directly related to low-cost travel.  Remote work can be done with a higher budget.
* **D: Safar namah ki pairawi sey lutf andoz honey walaa koyi shakhs (Someone who enjoys following a travel itinerary):**  This isn't linked to the passage's emphasis on budget travel.  Following an itinerary can often be more expensive.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr Point Marion aur Fairmont key darmiyaan chalaaney ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Raftaar ki hadd ko shaaz w naadir manaa jataa hay (Speed limits are often ignored).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Muqarrar kardah raftaar kee hadd qaabil zakar tor par sabiqah aur mabaad section key muqabilah kam hay-aam tor par 35-40 meal fee ghantah (56-64 kelo meter/ghantah)- aur iss kee sakhti say tamil aur bhee ziyadah ahmiyat kee haamil hay.""  This means speed limits are *not* strictly adhered to.
* The passage details difficult driving conditions (uneven roads, narrow turns, sudden curves) and warns drivers to be alert, suggesting speed limits are routinely disregarded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Door key mulk ki sadak taweel failao hay (Long roads are spread across the country):** The passage doesn't mention the overall length of roads in the country. It focuses on the specific route between Point Marion and Fairmont.
* **B: Galiyaan tang hein (Streets are narrow):** While the passage *does* mention narrow turns, it focuses more on the overall challenging driving conditions than just narrow streets.
* **D: Cellphone ki khidmaat ko masalah nahein banana chahiye (Cell phone service should not be a problem):**  The passage states the *opposite* - that cell phone service is *good* in some parts of the route but *poor* in other parts.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Buffalo-Pittsburg highway parr safar karney waley driveron key liye inmein sey kon asal tashweesh honi chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Bahut raftaar sey tezi sey murnaa (Driving at very high speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the roads have:

*   ""oonch neech, tang lean aur achanak tez mood ziyadah hotay hain"" (humps, sharp turns, and sudden curves are common)
*   ""Muqarrar kardah raftaar kee hadd qaabil zakar tor par sabiqah aur mabaad section key muqabilah kam hay-aam tor par 35-40 meal fee ghantah (56-64 kelo meter/ghantah)"" (The posted speed limit is remarkably low compared to the previous and subsequent sections - usually 35-40 mph)
*   ""...iss kee sakhti say tamil aur bhee ziyadah ahmiyat kee haamil hay"" (...this is even more important than Tamil) - This emphasizes the need for caution.

Combined, these points highlight the danger of driving *too fast* on this road. The low speed limit and challenging road conditions make speeding extremely risky.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhaari traffic mein fansna (Getting stuck in heavy traffic):** The passage doesn't mention heavy traffic as a problem.
*   **B: kaafi cellular khidmat ki kamee (Lack of good cellular service):** The passage actually states that cell service is *good* in many parts of the route.
*   **D: Aksar sadak key kaam kaa samnaa karnaa (Encountering road work often):** The passage doesn't mention road work as a common issue.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko khayi khudaayi shuru karney ki darkaar hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Thodi miqdaar ki tarbiyat (A little bit of training)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Canyoning mean teraki, chadhayi, aur koodnay key anaasir mujtama hain -- leakin iss ko shuroo karnay liye nisbatan mamuli training aur jismani shape kee zaroorat hay (maslan chataan parr chadhnay, scuba diving yaa alpine shippig key mawaznah mean).""

This translates to: ""Canyoning combines swimming, climbing, and jumping elements - but to start it requires relatively basic training and a certain physical condition (like climbing rocks, comparable to scuba diving or alpine skiing).""

While swimming, climbing, and jumping are *elements* of canyoning, the passage explicitly says it requires *basic training*, not necessarily a highly developed physical condition (option B) or proficiency in jumping (option C) or specifically swimming (option A).  Option D, ""Thodi miqdaar ki tarbiyat,"" accurately reflects the passage's emphasis on *basic* training.
"
Darjah zial mein sey kon eek kamiyaab khayi khudayi safar key liye zaruri ho saktaa hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Tairaaki ki salahiyat (Swimming ability)**.

Here's why:

* **Canyoning involves traversing rivers, which inherently requires swimming.** Even if the canyon isn't constantly submerged, there will be sections with water.
* **While other skills are helpful, swimming is the most fundamental.** 
    * **Aala khelaadi waali salahiyat (Excellent athletic ability)** is beneficial but not strictly necessary.
    * **Scuba gotah khori walaa saabiq tajrabah (Previous scuba diving experience)** is overkill and not required for most canyoning.
    * **Khayi khudayi key silsiley mein eek tasdiq naamah (Certification in canyoning)** is a good idea for safety, but not necessarily a *requirement* to successfully complete a canyoning trip.
* **Tairaaki ki salahiyat (Swimming ability)** is essential for safety and navigating the water sections of a canyon.

Therefore, swimming ability is the most crucial skill for a successful canyoning trip.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi key liye apney car mein camp karney ki mansubah bandi key liye kiya madadgaar ho sakta hay?","सही उत्तर **B: नीचेy लेटने के लिए सीटों की इजाज़त देने वाली एक गाड़ी** है।

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

पाठ स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि ""Car camping Usee soorat mean mumkin hay jab tumhare paas mini vein yaa sport utility vehicle yaa seeden yaa station vegan jis mean aisi seetein hone jin par aadmi lait sakay.""  इसका मतलब है कि कार कैंपिंग के लिए ज़रूरी है कि गाड़ी की सीटों को लेटने के लिए समतल किया जा सके।

अन्य विकल्प सही नहीं हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: अपनी गाड़ी की حدود मजबूत समझ:** यह ज़रूरी है, लेकिन यह कार कैंपिंग के लिए ज़रूरी सीधा पहलू नहीं है।
*   **C: एक टेंट:** पाठ में टेंट का उल्लेख नहीं है।
*   **D: कैंप करने के लिए निजी ज़ादाद:** पाठ में निजी ज़ादाद पर कैंप करने से बचने का उल्लेख है।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, car camp karney waley agar radaar key taht qeaam karney key liye dekh rahey hein to wohh kiss sey bachna chahtey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Shahar yaa kisi niji jayedaad parr koyi tent set karnaa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kisee private property parr yaa jis bhee hajm key town mean khema lagana gair matlub tauajjah ko jalb karnaa hay."" (Setting up a tent on private property or in any sized town is unnecessary to attract attention.)

The passage then goes on to describe car camping as a way to camp without attracting attention. This implies that car campers are trying to avoid being noticed while camping, likely because setting up a tent in public places (like towns or private property) would be problematic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SUV yaa minivan jaisi, kisi badi gaadi ko chalanaa:** The passage mentions vehicles like SUVs and minivans as being suitable for car camping, not as something to avoid.
*   **B: Ziyadah lamba sadak ka safar karnaa:** The passage describes a road trip as awesome, not something to avoid.
*   **D: Unki istemaal karney waali gaadi key saath manusiyat ki kami karnaa:** The passage doesn't mention anything about a lack of humanity associated with the car.



Therefore, car campers are avoiding drawing attention to themselves by not setting up tents in prohibited places (like towns or private property).



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisney Casablanca ko dobarah fir sey tameer kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **D: Marakash ka sultaan**.

The text states: ""Marakash key sultan nay iss shehar ko daar albadiyah key naam say dobarah tameer kiya..."" (The Sultan of Marrakesh rebuilt this city under the name Dar Albadiyah...).
"
Casablanca key jadid shahar ko eek qudrati tabaahi key baad kisney khaali kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Portugaali**.

The text states: ""Purtagali nay uss ko tabaah karr diyaa aur kaasa blanka key naam say usay dobarah tameer karwaya, sirf 1755 key zalzalay key baad usay chhodnay key liye."" This translates to: ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casablanca, only abandoning it after the 1755 earthquake.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bairuni logon key darmiyaan Sintra ney kaisey pahchaan haasil ki thee?","The correct answer is **C: Lord Byron key musbat jayezey (positive praises)**.

The text explicitly states that Sintra became famous among foreigners ""after a brilliant assembly of power and glory through the writings of Lord Byron.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:** Cabo da Roca is mentioned as a place the bus goes, but not as the reason for Sintra's fame among foreigners.
* **B: Marian ki zaaheri shaklein (Marian's outward forms):** While the text mentions Mariamiy Zahoor, it doesn't connect her appearance to Sintra's fame among foreigners.
* **D: Yehh ishqiyah taarikh hay (This is a tragic history):** The text doesn't characterize Sintra's history as tragic.  It highlights its glory and power.



"
Armenia ney kisko tasleem nahein kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Nagorno-Karabakh khittah**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Taham, koyee bhee musalmah mulk - hatta kehh arminia bhee bazabtah tor par usay tasleem nahein karta hay."" This translates to ""However, no Muslim country - not even Armenia - fully concedes it.""  ""Usay"" refers to the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which the text identifies as a new republic formed with Armenian support.  The sentence implies Armenia is not fully conceding/recognizing Nagorno-Karabakh's independence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Azeri logon key khilaaf jang (War against Azeri people):** The text says Armenia was involved in a war *against* the Azeri people. It doesn't state that Armenia is refusing to concede to the war itself.
* **C: Azerbaijan ki safarati bahsein (Azerbaijan's diplomatic discussions):**  The text doesn't mention Azerbaijan's diplomatic discussions.
* **D: Naya jamhuriyah (New republic):** The text says the new republic was *formed* with Armenian support, not that Armenia is refusing to concede to the republic itself.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: Nagorno-Karabakh khittah**.
"
Azerbaijan aur Armenia key darmiyaan talluqaat ko konsi cheez mosalsal motassir karti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Nagorno-Karabakh khittah**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""safarti ikhtelafat say arminia aur aazarbaijan key maabain taluqat badastur kharab hain"" (travel differences have continuously damaged relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan) and that the issue revolves around the Nagorno-Karabakh region. 
* The 1994 war is the event that *caused* the ongoing issues, but the *region itself* (Nagorno-Karabakh) remains the core point of contention.
* While the presence of Armenians in Azerbaijan is a factor, the conflict is fundamentally about control of Nagorno-Karabakh.
* Diplomatic discussions (safarati bahsein) are a result of the conflict, not the underlying cause.



Therefore, the Nagorno-Karabakh region is the most direct and persistent cause of the strained relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia.
"
Charlotte mein taxi letey waqt konsi cheez ezaafi charge ka sabab ban sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Teen mosaafiron ka haamil honaa (Having more than two passengers)**.

The text explicitly states: ""2 say ziyadah musafir rakhnay parr jurmanah hay, lehaza yeah intekhaab zaroorat say ziyadah mahnga padsakta hay."" which translates to ""There is a fine for carrying more than 2 passengers, therefore this choice becomes more expensive than necessary.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kisi deegar elaaqah mein sokunat ikhtiyaar karnaa (Choosing to reside in another area):** This is mentioned as a *reason* people move *to* Charlotte, not a reason for extra charges *when taking a taxi*.
* **C: Shahar tak janaa (Going to the city):** The text doesn't mention any extra charges related to going to the city.
* **D: Khandaan dostanah banana (Being family-friendly):** This is mentioned as a characteristic of Charlotte, not a reason for extra charges.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bachchon key saath Charlotte mein rahney key liye kisey kam tarr samjha jataa hay?","The correct answer is **B: taxi lenaa (Taking taxis)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""2 say ziyadah musafir rakhnay parr jurmanah hay, lehaza yeah intekhaab zaroorat say ziyadah mahnga padsakta hay."" This directly relates to the cost of taxis and why it's mentioned as a potential drawback for families.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ghar ki qimatein (House prices):** While housing costs can be a factor, the passage doesn't specifically highlight them as a major concern for families.
* **C: Deegar elaqon key bashindagaan (Residents from other areas):** The passage mentions that people move to Charlotte for its family-friendly atmosphere and friendly community. It doesn't suggest that being a resident from another area is a disadvantage.
* **D: Shahar sey lutf andoz honay ki koshish karna (Trying to enjoy the city):** The passage states that families often envision having fun with children in the city. It doesn't indicate that enjoying the city is a difficulty.



"
Haspaniyon ki aamad sey pahley kon Chile key shumaali hissah ko control karta thaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Mapuche**.

The text explicitly states: ""Shumali Chile parr inn kee hukumat thee. Mapucha..."" which translates to ""The Mapuche had the government of Northern Chile.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, dajah zail mein sey kon 1810 mein kiya waqea hua thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Markazi hukumat ki gair mojudgi thee**.

The passage states: ""Chile nay apni aazadi kaa elaan 1810 mean kiya (nipoliyayi jangon key doraan jab span mean chand salon taak koyee kaarkun markazi hukumat baaqi nahein rahee tha...)"" which translates to ""Chile declared its independence in 1810 (during the Napoleonic Wars when no central government remained in Spain for several years)...""

Therefore, the key event happening in 1810 was the absence of a central government in Spain.
"
Log Liguria key khittah mein door draaz key gaon tak kaisey pahunch saktey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Train yaa kashti key zariyah**.

Here's why:

* The text mentions that ""guzaar gaahein, trainein, aur kashtiyan nawazaat ko jodti hain"" which translates to ""ferries, trains, and boats connect them.""
* While cars *might* be able to reach some of the villages, the text highlights the rugged terrain and the isolation, implying that train and boat are more reliable and common methods of access, especially to the more remote villages.
* Option B is incorrect because the text explicitly mentions boats.
* Option A is not a comprehensive answer. 
* Option D is a slightly less accurate phrasing, but C is the best fit.



"
Itli ki istelaah ‘Cinque Terre’ ka matlab kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Paanch gaon (Five villages)**.

The passage clearly states: ""Sink teeray, jaiska matlab paanch zaminein hain..."" which translates to ""Five lands, meaning five villages...""  and then goes on to list the five villages that make up Cinque Terre.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss qism ki kashti mumkanah tor parr fislan waley mosamey sarmaa ki surate haal keliye mauzoon hay?","The correct answer is **B: Juday huey saazo saamn waali kashtiyaan (Boots with extra lugs on the sole)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the need for boots with deep treads (at least 5mm) to prevent slipping on ice and snow. It also mentions that some boots have extra lugs on the sole for better grip.  ""Juday huey saazo saamn waali kashtiyaan"" directly translates to ""Boots with extra lugs on the sole,"" aligning perfectly with this requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tang heels waali kashtiyaan (Boots with narrow heels):** The text specifically states that heels should be low and wide for stability. Narrow heels would be unstable.
* **C: Oonchey heels waali kashtiyaan (Boots with high heels):** High heels would be extremely dangerous and unsuitable for icy conditions, making slipping much more likely.
* **D: 1/5 inchi gahrey namooney key bagair kashtiyaan (Boots without treads at least 1/5 inch deep):** The text explicitly states the need for deep treads (at least 5mm), making boots without treads completely unsuitable.



"
Inmein sey kon Mosame sarmaa key halaat key doraan baraf ki sadkon parr krishn ko behtar bananey mein madad nahein karegaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Paani (Water)**.

Here's why:

* **Namak (Salt), Rayt (Gravel), and Bajri (Gravel/Pebbles):** These are all materials commonly used to increase traction on icy roads during winter. They provide grip by creating friction.

* **Paani (Water):**  Water on ice makes the situation *worse*. It can create a slippery layer of thin ice, making it even harder to walk.

Therefore, water doesn't help improve traction on icy roads. It's the opposite!
"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska Hawaii aur Cook jazeeron key darmiyaan durust momasil hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wohh eek hi waqt key mintaqah ka ishteraak kartey hein** (They share the same time zone).

The text explicitly states: ""Hawai kee hee tarah eek hee time zone waale yeah jazeeray kabhi kabhaar """"hawai down under"""" tasavvur kiya jaataa hay."" (Like Hawaii, these islands are sometimes envisioned as the ""Hawaii Down Under"" because they share the same time zone.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Unn dono mein bahut sey badey hotel hein** (They have very large hotels) - The text states there are no major hotels on the Cook Islands, highlighting the opposite.
*   **B: Unn dono key paas riyaasat ka darjah nahein hay** (They do not have a state status) - The text indicates the Cook Islands *do* have a state status (""riyasati haisiyat say qabal"").
*   **D: Unn donno mein koyi shahar nahein hay** (They have no cities) - While true for the Cook Islands, the text doesn't mention whether Hawaii has cities or not. The shared time zone is the most direct comparison highlighted in the text.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr Cook jazeeron ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Asal shahar Rarotonga aur Aitutaki hein**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Cock jazair mean koyee shehar nahein hay, balkeh yeah 15 mukhtalif jazeeron kaa majmuah hay. inn mean ahem rartonga aur aayito taaki hain."" which translates to ""There is no city in the Cook Islands, but rather it is a collection of 15 different islands. Among these are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yehh Hawaii sey chotta hay (It is smaller than Hawaii):** The passage doesn't directly compare the size of the Cook Islands to Hawaii.
* **B: Yehh eek jazeerah numa hay (It is island-like):** This is true, but the passage provides more specific details than just saying it's island-like.
* **D: Jazeerah walaa mulk Hawaii ki tarah eek hi waqt key mintaqah ka ishteraak karta hay (The island country shares the same time zone as Hawaii):** The passage mentions that the Cook Islands are sometimes called ""Hawaii Down Under"" *because* they share a time zone, but it doesn't say this is a defining characteristic *in the passage* that needs to be stated as the correct definition.
"
Darjah zail ranger station mein sey kon do qism key rehaaeshi ikhteyaraat ki peshkash karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""Serena eek waahid ranger station hay jo camping key elawah thaharnay keliye mushtarkah sonay key kamray aur garam khaaney kee paishkash karta hay..."" (Serena is a single ranger station that, in addition to camping, offers shared sleeping rooms and hot food for patrolling.)

This indicates that Serena offers both camping *and* shared sleeping rooms/hot food, which are two different types of lodging options. The other options (Los Patos, La Leona, and San Pedrillo) are mentioned as offering only camping facilities.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, credit key bajaye raqam istemaal karney keliye agar aap chahtey they to park ki ijazat ko aap kahaan mahfooz kar saktey they?","The correct answer is **C: CafeNet El Sol**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pewarto jamineez mean ranger station say baraah raast park permits haasil karnaa mumkin hay, magar woh credit cards qabool nahein kartay Park service ( minae) matuqa aamad say eek maah peshtar say ziyadah kee kaar permit jaari nahein karti. Kaifay neat ail solbking us$30 mean yaa eek duinn guzarnay key liye $10 mean service pesh karta hay inn key korkowado safhay parr tafsilaat mojud hain.""

This means park permits cannot be paid for with credit cards. The only place mentioned that offers a service for a fee (and implies payment is accepted there) is CafeNet El Sol. Therefore, you could potentially use a payment method other than a credit card to obtain the park permit there.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism ki skiing ko ziyadah steep khittah mein kiya jataa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Alpine andaaz (Alpine style)**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""Yeah iss say mutaliq hay leakin aam tor parr alpayan style aiski tour yaa koah paimayi iss mean shaamil nahein hay..."" This directly links Alpine style skiing to steeper terrain.
* The text contrasts Alpine style with other types of skiing (like touring/hiking, which aren't typically done on very steep slopes).
* The description of Alpine style emphasizes speed and covering longer distances down prepared tracks, which are common in steeper mountainous regions.

Therefore, the passage directly identifies Alpine style skiing as the type done on steeper mountains.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mulk key himayat yaaftah ski karney walon ki kia cheez madad kar sakti hay jo mazeed ziyadah raftaaron tak pahunchna chahtey hein?","The correct answer is **A: Sakht jootey (Hard boots)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Achhi haalat mean aap chehal qadmi key bajaye kisee bhee tarah ziyadah doori tay karr payein gay - lekin kabhi kabhaar hee aap tayaar kardah tracks mean baghair bhaari beak peak key contry skiing kee raftaar haasil kar payein gay. **Achhi haalat mean ziyaadah sakht aiski aur jootay kee zaroorat parti hai.**"" (In good conditions you can cover more distance than forty steps - but sometimes you can achieve speed in the prepared tracks without a heavy beak peak country skiing. **Good conditions require harder boots**.)

Therefore, hard boots are mentioned as a requirement for achieving higher speeds, especially in good conditions.
"
Dobarah dakhil honey waley sadmah ka samnaa karney waley musaafiron key paas kiya krney key liye sakht waqt hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Saabir aur samajhdaar rahnaa (Being patient and understanding).**

Here's why:

The passage describes culture shock as a difficult experience. It mentions that travelers returning home after a long stay abroad can feel overwhelmed and disconnected from their own culture.  The text also implies that patience and understanding are crucial for those experiencing this shock, both from the travelers themselves and from those around them.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Nayi jagah ki saqafat sey mowafiqat karna (Adapting to the new culture):** While adapting is *part* of the process, the question asks what to do *when* experiencing culture shock.  It's not about the adaptation itself, but the coping mechanism.
* **C: Bairune mulk safar karnaa (Traveling abroad):** This is the *cause* of the problem, not a solution to dealing with it.
* **D: Apni ghareloo saqafat sey az sirey naw naw mowafiqat karnaa (Constantly adapting to your own home culture):** The passage states that returning home can be difficult because of the contrast, not because you need to constantly adapt to your own culture.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, dobarah dakhil honay walaa sadmah khaas tor parr kis qism key mosaafir key liye mushkil ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Abb bhi suhaag raat key marhalah mein rahney waley mosaafir hazaraat (Travelers still in the honeymoon phase).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dobarah daakhli sadmah tehzeebi sadme kee nisbat ziyadah jald aata hay (us mean honey moon kee muddat kam hoti hay), der thak rehta hay aur bahut shiddat kaa haamil hosakta hay."" This translates to: ""Re-entry shock of cultural shock occurs faster (meaning the honeymoon period is shorter), prolonged fatigue and can be very intense.""

The honeymoon phase, or ""suhaag raat"" (literally, the first night of marriage), is the period of intense happiness and adjustment after a significant event.  If this period is already disrupted or shorter, the re-entry shock will be even more pronounced and difficult to manage.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Khosusi tor parr buri saqafat key sadmay ka samana karney waley mosaafir hazraat (Travelers who specifically face the shock of a bad culture):**  While a bad culture shock *can* contribute to re-entry shock, the passage focuses on the *timing* and *intensity* of the re-entry shock, not the specific nature of the initial culture shock.
* **B: Bairune mulk rahney key waqt fauri tor parr motabiqat karney waley mosaafir hazraat (Travelers who quickly adapt while living abroad):** The passage doesn't indicate that those who adapt quickly will *not* experience re-entry shock, just that those in the honeymoon phase will experience it more intensely.
* **D: Kam saabir mosaafir hazaraat (Impatient travelers):** Impatience might exacerbate re-entry shock, but it's not the primary factor highlighted in the passage.

Darjah zail mein sey kiya kaam logon ko moose key saath karney sey bachna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Apney mumkanah khatrah ki satah ko kam karnaa (Reduce the potential level of danger).**

Here's why:

The text states that mice don't inherently want to fight, but will defend themselves if they feel threatened.  The passage also warns that people who underestimate American mice get too close and put themselves at risk.

Therefore, the best way to avoid problems with mice is to reduce the likelihood of them feeling threatened and potentially defending themselves. This is achieved by minimizing the perceived danger to the mice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Apni mojudagi ko nazar andaaz karnaa (Ignoring your presence):**  This wouldn't necessarily prevent a mouse from feeling threatened if it senses you.
* **B: Bahut aahistah pahunch haasil karnaa (Achieving very slow approach):** While slow movement might help, it doesn't address the core issue of the mouse feeling threatened.
* **D: Unkaa door sey moshahedah karnaa (Observing them from a distance):** This is a safer approach, but *reducing potential danger* is a more proactive and encompassing solution.  It's about preventing the need for observation in the first place.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, moose key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Wohh fitri tor parr jaarehanah janwar hotey hein (They are naturally aggressive animals)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Mus (jinhein ailak bhee kahaa jaataa hay) woh zaati tor parr jarhana fitrat nahein rakhtay"" which translates to ""Mice (also called ailak) do not have a naturally aggressive nature.""

Therefore, option A directly contradicts the information provided in the text.  The other options are all supported by the text:

* **B: Unhein baaz auqaat mumkanah khatrah nahein samjha jataa hay (Sometimes they are not considered a potential danger):** The text says people who don't consider American mice dangerous get too close.
* **C: Qreebi qurbat key andar key logon ney unhein motaharrik kiya jaa saka (People who are close to them can provoke them):** The text mentions they will defend themselves if they feel threatened.
* **D: Agar zaruri hua to wohh khud difaa karein gay (If necessary, they will defend themselves):**  This is directly stated in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon eek sahrayi mosaafir key liye kam az kam khatarnaak hoga?","The correct answer is **A: Eek thandi raat ko garam kapday ki kami (Lack of warm clothes on a cold night)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the dangers of heat and dehydration.** Options B, C, and D all directly relate to these dangers – mirages leading to wasted time and water, exhaustion from chasing mirages, and water loss.
* **Option A describes hypothermia.** While hypothermia is serious, it's a risk in deserts *especially* at night when temperatures plummet.  The passage explicitly states this.  Therefore, it's presented as a danger that can be mitigated with proper preparation (warm clothes).
* **Comparing the options:** While all are dangerous, the passage emphasizes the dangers of both extreme heat *and* extreme cold in deserts. Having warm clothes is directly addressing a threat the passage specifically mentions and can be readily prevented. The other options are consequences of being caught in the desert's harsh conditions.

Therefore, while hypothermia is a real threat, having warm clothes is a more easily addressed and potentially less immediate danger than the other scenarios described in the passage.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko sahrayi mosaafiron key liye eek mumkanah khatrah key tor parr zikr kiya jataa hay?,"सही जवाब है **C: Hypothermia**

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* **Hypothermia:** पाठ स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि रेगिस्तानों में रात में तापमान बहुत गिर सकता है, और बिना गर्म कपड़ों के यह एक गंभीर खतरा है।
* **Paani ki kami (पानी की कमी):** पाठ में पानी के भ्रम के बारे में बताया गया है, लेकिन यह सीधे तौर पर एक गंभीर खतरा नहीं बताया गया है, बल्कि एक समस्या के रूप में बताया गया है जिसके कारण अधिक नुकसान हो सकता है।
* **Saraab (पानी का भ्रम):** यह एक भ्रम है, वास्तविक खतरा नहीं।
* **Suraj ki sozish (धूप की जलन):** पाठ में धूप की जलन का उल्लेख नहीं है।

इसलिए, दी गई जानकारी के आधार पर, **Hypothermia** रेगिस्तानी यात्रियों के लिए सबसे संभावित खतरा है।
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, daryaaft kunindagan ki aamad key baad kis jamaat ki aabadi ziyadah motassir hui thee?","The correct answer is **C: Taínos**.

The text states: ""Europe kaa khoj karnay waalon kee aamad key chand saal baad say hee hispanvi fateheen kee taraf say taayi nose kee aabadi mean waazeh tor parr kamee waaqa ho gayee thee. Fray bartolome de las casas mean 1492 say 1498 tak rehney waale spiny fateheen nay taqriban 100,000 taaye no logon ko qatal kiya.""

This clearly indicates that the Taínos population was significantly impacted (and decreased) after the arrival of the Europeans and the Spanish conquest.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Caribian log konsi zubaan boltey they?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""carebase arawakin zubaan bolnay waale log they jo kehh 10,000 bce key qareeb yahaan aayeyey...""  This directly identifies the Arawakan people as the speakers of the language.
"
Dobarah takhliqi sargarmi key tor parr skiing ko mashhoor karney ka credit kis ko diya ja sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Norwey key log**.

The text states: ""1861 mean pehla tafrihi sky club norway key baashindon nay australia mean khola thaa."" This means the people of Norway opened the first recreational ski club in Australia in 1861, contributing to the popularity of downhill skiing.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss waqt key ird gird khel key tor parr skiing ko sabsey pahley taslim kiya gaya thaa?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The text states: ""Skiing (barf parr phisalnay kaa mashghalah) bahut qadeem hay -- jinn ghar kee paintings mean scares ko dikhaya gayaa hay woh 5000 saal qable maseeh puraani hain!"" This directly indicates that skiing was practiced as a sport 5000 BC.

While skiing's popularity as a recreational activity started in the 17th century and was formally introduced with ski clubs in 1861, its existence as a sport dates back much further. Therefore, 5000 BC is the earliest time mentioned in the text when skiing was a sport.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon aam tor parr mashriqi afriqi saahil key sabsey baday jazeerey key saath wabastah hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Europe ke logon ka asaro rosukh (European influence)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Europi asro rosookh aur istemariyat kaa aaghaz 15vein sadee mean huwa, jab purtagali muhim ju wasco dee gaama nay europe say hindustan aaneka cap root driyafat kiya."" This translates to ""The beginning of European influence and colonialism was in the 15th century, when the Portuguese expedition of Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.""  This means European influence is a key historical factor in the region.

While the other options are true statements from the text:

* **B: Islami khittah (Islamic continent):**  Islam *was* brought to the region, but it doesn't describe the dominant influence in later history.
* **C: Jangali zindagi (Wildlife):**  Madagascar is known for its wildlife, but it's not the primary connection to the coast's biggest island.
* **D: Pur tayyush resort (Luxury resorts):** The coastal islands are known for resorts, but not the defining relationship with the largest island.



Therefore, European influence is the most accurate answer based on the text.
"
Ziyadah chotey mashariqi afriqi jazeeron ki kiya khosusiyat nahein hay? ,"The correct answer is **D: Deegar mamalik sey aazadi (Freedom from other countries)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Peshtar chhote jazair azad mulk hain yaa france say waabistah hain..."" which translates to ""Most of the smaller islands are either independent countries or affiliated with France..."" This directly contradicts option D. The text implies that many of the smaller islands *are not* independent.

The text mentions that they are known for luxury beach resorts and are often associated with a strong wildlife presence.  They also mention the historical influence of Arab culture and European colonization. So, options A, B, and C are all consistent with the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kuchh khaas tor sey rewayati churchon ki jaanib sey Easter kaisey manaya jataa hay?","The correct answer is **B: Sanichar ki eek raat ki nigraani ki mezbaani karnaa (Hosting vigil on Saturday night)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Aksar taqlidi church easter key taateel mean shanbah kee raat shab bedari kartay hain..."" (Often, traditional churches hold vigils on Saturday night during the Easter holiday...).
* This vigil is a key tradition in many churches, culminating in the celebration of Christ's resurrection at midnight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek zarkhezi ki rewayat ka haamil honaa (Being a carrier of a tradition):** While the passage mentions traditions, it doesn't describe a specific tradition in general.
* **C: Jamaat key liye eek bahaar party karnaa (Having a spring party for the congregation):**  The passage doesn't mention parties.
* **D: Toluey aaftab dekhnaa (Watching the sunrise):** While watching the sunrise is mentioned as a possible experience, it's not the primary or defining way traditional churches celebrate Easter, according to the passage. The vigil on Saturday night is more central.



"
"Makhsus zaruriyaat sey bachney key liye Ecuador mein dakhil hotay waqt, Cuba key eek shahari ko sabsey pahley kiya haasil karnaa zaruri hay?","The correct answer is **B: Eek qanooni dawat namah ka khat (A legal invitation letter)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Ekwador chahta hay kehh cuba key baashinde ekwador mean daakhil honey say qabal bain alaqwami airports yaa sarhadi daakhli maqamat key zariye eek dawat namah vasool karein. Iss khat ko ekwador kee wazaarat khaarjah kee taraf say qanuni qaraar dena hoga aur makhsus taqazon ko pooraa karnaa hoga."" (Ecuador wants Cuban residents to receive an invitation letter through international airports or border entry points before entering Ecuador. This letter must be legally approved by the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs and meet special requirements.)

While the other options are *also* requirements, the *first* and most important thing a Cuban citizen needs to obtain is the legal invitation letter.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the given information.
"
Ecuador key safar ki zaruriyaat kia hein jiskey liye usey design kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Eek monazzam muntaqili key bahao ko bahaal karnaa (To restore a regulated flow of migration).**

The provided text explicitly states: ""Yeah sharaet iss liye waza kee gayee hain taakeh donon mulkon key maabain mohajireen kee aamad wo raft ko monazzam kiya jaa sakay.""  This translates to ""These conditions have been established so that the entry and exit of migrants between the two countries can be regulated.""

Options A, C, and D are aspects of regulating migration, but option B directly reflects the stated purpose of the Ecuadorian government's requirement for a приглашение (invitation). Therefore, option B is the most accurate and comprehensive answer.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon watan key moqabiley mein kisi doosrey mulk mein ziyadah qimati ho sakti hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Aala asal key framez (Aala asal key framez)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in countries with lower labor costs, glasses can be cheaper. It also mentions that finding high-quality brand-name frames in these areas can be difficult, and the actual cost can be higher than expected because the manufacturing location might be more expensive. Therefore, *high-quality original frames* are likely to be more expensive in those countries than in the places where they are manufactured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aankh ki janchein (Eyesight tests):** The passage suggests getting an eye exam at home, implying they'd be cheaper than in a clinic.
* **C: Nazar ki yaqeen dahani (Vision correction):** This is a general term for vision correction and doesn't specifically refer to something that would be more expensive abroad.
* **D: Gair brand naam waley frame (Non-brand name frames):** The passage suggests high-quality brand-name frames might be difficult to find and more expensive. Non-brand name frames would likely be cheaper.



"
Kisi khariji mulk mein aala asla key framez khareedney kaa kiya mumkanah khatrah bann sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wohh naqli ho saktey hein (They might be fake).**

Here's why:

The passage discusses the potential for cheaper glasses in other countries, but it also highlights risks. Buying expensive frames from a foreign country introduces concerns about authenticity. Counterfeit goods are a significant problem, especially with designer brands.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Eek ezaafi aankh ki jaanch darkaar ho sakti hay (An additional eye exam might be needed):** While potentially true (especially if the glasses are prescription), this isn't the primary risk related to *buying the frames themselves*.
* **B: Makhsus framez key liye tashkhees ho sakta hay jayez na ho (Diagnosis for special frames might not be valid):**  This is less directly related to the danger of purchasing frames from another country.  While a correct prescription is necessary, the issue isn't about the diagnosis being invalid, but the possibility of buying counterfeit frames.
* **D: Yaqeen dahaani ho sakta hay qimat ka ehaatah na kar sakey (It might be difficult to estimate the price):**  The passage notes pricing difficulties, but this is more of an inconvenience than a serious risk compared to the possibility of buying fake products.



Therefore, the most accurate and concerning risk associated with buying high-end frames from a foreign country is that they could be counterfeit.



"
Falklands mein currency key istemaal key baaey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah dururst nahein hay?,"The incorrect statement is **B: Stanley tanha eek aisi jagah hay, jahaan ameriki dollar qobool kiye jaatey hein (Stanley is the only place where the US dollar is accepted).**

The text states that British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands and **American dollars are also often accepted.** It doesn't say that Stanley is the *only* place where US dollars are accepted.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Sir credit card aur bartanawi pound ko bahari jazeeron parr qobool kiya jaata hay (Sir credit cards and British pounds are accepted in other islands).**  The text explicitly says British pounds are accepted widely. Credit cards (including those from Britain, Europe, and America) are mentioned as potentially accepted, though foreign island credit cards are often not delivered.
* **C: Jazeerey chodney sey pahley Falkland key pound ka tabadalah honaa chahiye (The Falkland pound should be exchanged before leaving the islands).** The text strongly advises exchanging currency before leaving the islands due to the difficulty of exchanging Falkland pounds outside the islands.
* **D: Falkland pound sey qata nazar, bartanawi pound aam tor parr ziyadah maqbool currency hay (Regardless of the Falkland pound, the British pound is generally the more popular currency).** The text explicitly states that British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands.



Therefore, the answer is **B**.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, America sey Falklands mein safar kartey waqt, kahaan credit car ki ba nisbat adayegi ki deegar shakal khaas tor parr mofeed ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Stanley mein**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and are accepted in Stanley credit card."" It also mentions that Stanley is where the bank is located near FIC West store where currency exchange is possible.  Therefore, credit cards are most useful in Stanley.
"
Konsa waqea mandir key teohaaron key jashan key saath wabasta nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek haathi ki paidaesh (A birth of an elephant)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that temple festivals celebrate the anniversary of the temple's founding, the anniversary of the presiding deity, or another significant event related to the temple. While elephants might participate in temple festivals (like the elephant procession mentioned in the Kerala example), the passage doesn't mention celebrating an elephant's birth as a temple festival. The other options (B, C, and D) are all directly mentioned as being part of temple celebrations.
"
Mozayyan haathiyon ko kahaan dekhaa ja sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mandir key tehwaron key jolus mein**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Keral key dilchasp mandiron key melay dekhnay key laiq hain, iss mean sajaye hoay haathiyon kaa joloos nikala jaataa hay...""  This translates to: ""The interesting temples of Kerala are worth seeing, which include a procession of decorated elephants...""  

Therefore, you can see the decorated elephants (mozayyan haathiyon) in the temple festivals' processions (mandir key tehwaron key jolus mein).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon karobaar yaa pahely darjah key hawyi keraye parr paisah mahfooz karney key kaa sabsey ziyada mumkanah tariqah hay?","The correct answer is **A: Apni company mein isko kharch karnaa (Spending it through your company)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Taham, yeah sastaa nahein hay: angothay key seedhay osul key mutabiq, aap business cliss key liye aam economy cliss say chaar gunaa ziyadah aur frist cliss key liye gyarah gunaa ziyadah adayegi karnay kee tawaqqo karsakte hain! Taham, yeah sastaa nahein hay: angothay key seedhay osul key mutabiq, aap business cliss key liye aam economy cliss say chaar gunaa ziyadah aur frist cliss key liye gyarah gunaa ziyadah adayegi karnay kee tawaqqo karsakte hain!"" (However, this is not cheap: according to the straightforward rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times more for business class than for regular economy class, and eleven times more for first class!)

* **The passage also says:** ""Airlines companiyan jaanti hain kehh hawai safar karnay waala makhsus group kahein bhee aaram dah tareeqe say jaldi pahunchnay keliye ziyadah dollar deenay ke liye tayaar rehta hay, to unn parr usee key mutabiq charge karti hain."" (Airlines companies know that a special group of air travelers is willing to pay more dollars for a comfortable and faster way to arrive, so they charge them accordingly.)

* **Option A** addresses this directly. By routing the expense through your company, you are leveraging the fact that businesses are willing to pay higher fares for convenience and comfort. It allows the company to absorb the cost, rather than the individual traveler bearing the full expense.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Karobaar key bajaye pahley darjah ki booking karna (Booking first class instead of the company):** This is the most expensive option and defeats the purpose of finding a cost-effective solution.
* **C: Eek bilwastah pahley darjah ki parwaaz book karnaa (Booking a direct first class flight):**  Again, very expensive and doesn't leverage any strategic advantage.
* **D: Apni company mein isko kharch karnaa (Spending it through your company):** This is the key to taking advantage of the willingness of businesses to pay more for enhanced travel experiences, while still containing the expense within the company's budget.



"
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, makhsus keraye ke darjon ko book karnay key waqt ko talaash krney key liye ziaaye waqt kiaa hogaa?","The correct answer is **B: Karobaari darjah (Business class)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly discusses the cost of business class travel and how it's significantly more expensive than economy or first class. The question asks what the passage refers to when discussing the cost of special fares.  ""Karobaari darjah"" directly translates to ""business class.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Braahe raast parwazein (Direct flights):** While the passage mentions direct flights in the context of first class, it's not the *special fare* being discussed.
*   **C: Reaayatein (Privileges/Discounts):** The passage actually states that business class is *not* a privilege, but requires a significant payment.
*   **D: Pahla darjah (First class):** The passage mentions first class as an even more expensive option than business class, but the question is specifically about the special fare of business class.



"
Duniya bharr key kerayah key saath Africa kull kerayah key iqtebaas ka mowazenah kartey waqt kiss cheez ko shaamil karney zarurat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Africa mein rawangi key taxon ki qimat** (The cost of departure taxes in Africa).

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Afriqah key baahir unn tamaam maqamat keliye izaafi wezay, rawangi mahsulaat, zamini naql wo hamal waghairah key izaafi ikhrajat bhee shaamil karein."" (Include additional expenses for visas, departure taxes, ground transportation, etc. for all destinations outside of Africa.)

Therefore, departure taxes *outside* of Africa are part of the calculation, but departure taxes *within* Africa are *not* mentioned as needing to be included in the comparison to global fares.  The question asks what should *not* be included in the Africa-wide fare comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Africa sey bahar key maqamat key liye ezaafi vison ki qimat** (The cost of additional visas for destinations outside Africa): This is explicitly mentioned as an additional expense to include.
* **C: Africa key visa ki qimat** (The cost of visas in Africa): This is explicitly mentioned as an additional expense to include.
* **D: Africa key baahar mahallate waqoo key liye zaminee transportation ki qimat** (The cost of ground transportation for destinations outside Africa): This is explicitly mentioned as an additional expense to include.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, supermarket kiss cheez key mazeed motanawwah intekhaab ki peshkash shuru kar rahey hein?","The correct answer is **A: Tayyar khana (Prepared food)**.

The passage explicitly states that supermarkets are increasingly offering a wide variety of prepared foods because people don't always have time to cook. It mentions that they offer these foods for easy heating.
"
Baaz supermarket ki jaanib sey faraham kardah konsi sahulat saarif ko tayyaar khana kharidney key liye ubhaarti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Eek microvave choolha (A microwave oven)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yahaan thak kehh khaana garam karnay keliye kuchh to microview aween yaa deegar wasail bhee farahim kartay hain"" which translates to ""here, some even provide a microwave oven or other means to heat food."" This directly addresses the convenience of ready-made food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Site parr resturaan (A restaurant on site):** While some supermarkets *may* have a restaurant, the passage says restaurants are more common in certain countries or types of stores, and it's not a standard offering in *all* supermarkets.
* **B: kam motanawwah intekhaab (Limited selection):** The passage implies a *wide* selection of ready-made meals.
* **C: Kachcha khana (Raw food):** The passage focuses on ready-made food, not raw ingredients.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsi baat fransisi bolney waley belgium aur swiss key logon ki jaanib sey ho sakta hay kehh nahh samjha gaya ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Meaari fransisi number walaa system (Standard French number system)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland differs from standard French, speakers from those regions have learned standard French in school. This learning is *intended* to facilitate mutual understanding. 

The passage specifically mentions that ""baaz alfaz kaa talaffuz bhee mukhtalif hay"" (some words have different pronunciations). It also says ""addi nizam chand mamuli khususiyat kaa haamil hay"" (the system has some slight particularities) which refers to grammar and vocabulary differences. 

However, the passage *doesn't* mention any issues with the number system. While number systems can vary between languages and cultures, the passage focuses on differences in spoken language and vocabulary.  Therefore, a standardized number system wouldn't be a barrier to understanding for French speakers from Belgium and Switzerland.



Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Ajeeb fransisi alfaaz (Strange French words):** The passage explicitly states that some words have different pronunciations, which implies they might sound strange, but not that they're completely incomprehensible.
* **C: Fransisi alfaaz key khaas talaffuzaat (Specific pronunciations of French words):**  The passage mentions this directly.
* **D: France mein ziyadah tarr fransisi bolney waley (Most French speakers in France):** While there might be differences, the passage indicates that speakers from Belgium and Switzerland have received a standardized education and should be able to understand most French speakers in France.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon france mein usy tarah nahein hay jaisaa kehh wohh belgium aur Switzerland mein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Tamaam alfaaz ka talaffuz (All words' pronunciation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland are related to French spoken in France and mutually intelligible, there are differences in pronunciation. The passage mentions ""baaz alfaz kaa talaffuz bhee mukhtalif hay"" (some words' pronunciation is also different).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Number walaa system (Number system):** The passage mentions a difference in the number system in Belgium and Switzerland.
* **C: Skulon mein padhayi janey wali meyaari fransisi zubaan (Standard French taught in schools):** The passage explicitly states that all French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland learn standard French in school to facilitate understanding.
* **D: Kuchh fransisi alfaaz ki hijjey (Some French words' vocabulary):** The passage mentions that there are some differences in vocabulary.



Therefore, the difference in **all words' pronunciation** is a key distinguishing factor mentioned in the passage.



"
Kiss manzar namah mein aap ko mumkanah tor parr sog key kerayah ki peshkash nahein ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Agar aap freeqe saalis ki khidmat key bajaye airline sey brahe raast book karney ki koshish kartey hein.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the bereavement fares are offered *only* when booking **directly with the airline** via phone. Options A, C, and D are all scenarios where the airlines mentioned *do* offer bereavement fares, as long as you book directly. Option B describes the opposite scenario - booking through a third party (travel agent), which excludes the bereavement fare offer.



"
Sog key kerayon key barah mein kiya durust hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Unhein lazmi tor parr baraahe raast phone key zariyah airline sey book karnaa hogaa** (They must be booked directly with the airline by phone).

The text explicitly states: ""Tamaam muamilon mean, aap co laazman air line say phone key zariah braah raast book karwana chahiye"" which translates to ""In all cases, you must book directly with the airline by phone.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh janaazah key safar ki qimat ka ihaatah kartey hein** (They cover the cost of funeral travel) - The text doesn't mention that the fares cover the cost of the funeral itself.
* **B: Unhein baraahe raast airline ki website parr book karnaa zaruri hay** (It is necessary to book on the airline's website directly) - The text specifically says booking by phone is required, not online.
* **C: Wohh aakhiri minute key safar ki qimat ka ihaatah kartey hein** (They cover the cost of last-minute travel) - While the offer is for last-minute travel, the text doesn't state the fares cover the cost of the travel itself. It highlights the *discount* offered on last-minute flights.



"
Standalone GPS aalah ka istemaal kabb GPS gashti app sey ziyadah aasan hogaa?,"The correct answer is **C: Jabb aap hadd sey bahar ja rahey hon (When you are going beyond the range)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the GPS navigation app's functionality is limited or unavailable when you are outside of data connectivity range.  Therefore, a standalone GPS device would be *easier* to use in that situation because it doesn't rely on a mobile data connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jabb aap paisa bachaney ki koshish kar rahey hein (When you are trying to save money):** While using a phone's GPS can save money initially, the passage highlights that a standalone GPS device *is* a way to save money in the long run (by avoiding the cost of maps or rentals).  It's not the primary reason for choosing a standalone GPS.
* **B: Jabb aap ko yaqeen ho kehh aap key paas data connection hogaa (When you are sure you will have data connection):**  The passage directly contradicts this. If you *expect* data connectivity, the phone's GPS might be a better option.
* **D: Jabb aap kisi aalah ko kerayah parr lenaa chahtey hon (When you want to rent a device):** Renting a device is a separate consideration from the ease of use of a GPS app.

"
GPS gashti app istemaal karney key liye konsi achchi wajah nahein hay is tor parr kehh wo standalone aalah key khilaaf ho?,"The correct answer is **A: Data connection key baarey mein parishaan honey ki zarurat na honaa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a major limitation of using GPS navigation apps on a smartphone is the need for a data connection.  Option A directly contradicts this limitation. The passage highlights that lack of data connection severely impacts the app's functionality.  Therefore, *not* worrying about data connection is *not* a good reason to use the app, because the potential problems related to data connection are significant.

Let's look at why the other options *are* good reasons:

* **B: Paisa bachanaa (Saving money):** The passage mentions saving money by avoiding the purchase of GPS maps, standalone GPS devices, or car rentals.
* **C: Kerayon sey bachna (Avoiding rentals):** This directly aligns with the passage's statement about avoiding car rental costs.
* **D: Naye naqshon ko kharidney ki zarurat na honaa (Not needing to buy new maps):** This is another benefit highlighted in the passage.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aap kaisey yehh garanty dey saktey hein kehh aap monasib jahaaz key moshabah hein?","The correct answer is **C: Galapagos key safar mein takhsis haasil karney waley kisi agent key saath book karna.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...Aap yaqeen karein kehh jis agent say aap book karwatay hain woh goalpagoz kaa maher hay jis key paas bahut qism key jehazon kee achhi malumat hay. Yeah iss baat co yaqeeni banaye gaa kehh aapki khususi dilchaspiyan aur / yaa rukawatein unn keliye sab say mozoon jehaaz key saath mel khaa gayee hain."" This directly links using an agent specializing in Galapagos trips to ensuring you get on a suitable boat.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Momasil dilchaspiyon waley 8+ mosaafiron ki jamaat mein book karnaa:** While this *might* help, it's not guaranteed. The passage emphasizes finding a boat that aligns with *your specific interests*, not just a group size.
* **B: Kam season key doraan book karnaa:** This might improve availability, but it doesn't guarantee a boat that suits your interests.
* **D: Bahut peshgi book karnaa:** This improves availability, but again, it doesn't guarantee the boat is a good fit.



Therefore, the passage directly points to booking with a specialized agent as the most reliable way to ensure you get on a suitable boat for your Galapagos trip.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon mehmaano key juwaa khelney ko barqaraar rakhney key harbah key tor parr istemaal nahein hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Qudrati roshni ki kasrat (Abundant natural light)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how casinos use various tactics to encourage gamblers to keep playing and spend money. These tactics include:

*   **Lack of clocks and windows:** To make people lose track of time.
*   **Special offers of food, drinks, and entertainment:** To keep guests in a good mood.
*   **Alcohol:** To impair judgment.

Abundant natural light would be the **opposite** of a tactic designed to keep people engrossed and lose track of time. It would encourage awareness of the outside world and potentially make them less likely to stay in the casino.

The other options are all tactics mentioned in the passage that casinos use to maintain gamblers' engagement:

*   **B: Concert key muft ticket jaisee muraat (Free concert tickets like rewards):**  This is a form of entertainment and incentive.
*   **C: Taarifi mashrubaat (Complimentary alcoholic beverages):**  This is directly mentioned as a way to keep people in a good mood and impair judgment.
*   **D: Ghadiyon ki gair mojudgi (Absence of clocks):** This is mentioned as a tactic to make people lose track of time.



Therefore, **Qudrati roshni ki kasrat** doesn't fit into the category of tactics casinos use to prolong gambling sessions."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss cheez sey eek maahir juwari ko bachna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Bahut ziyadah sharaab pinaa (Drinking too much alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""sharab noshi faislah saazi co kharab karti hay aur tamaam achhay joey baaz hosh mean rehney kee ahmiyat co jaantay hain."" This translates to: ""Drinking alcohol impairs decision-making, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying alert.""

The other options are not directly addressed as dangers in the text:

*   **B: Koyi muraat qobool karnaa (Fulfilling a wish/request):** While potentially risky, it's not specifically mentioned as a danger to a skilled gambler.
*   **C: Divaar yaa haath ki ghadiyaan istemaal karnaa (Using wall or hand clocks):**  The text says windows and clocks are *not* common, not that using clocks is dangerous.
*   **D: Qareeb tareen khoruj key baarey mein tafteesh karnaa (Investigating the nearest exit):** Knowing exits is a smart precaution, but the text focuses on alcohol's impact on judgment.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text is excessive alcohol consumption."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kalaam ka konsa hissa jumlah key darmiyaan bada horoof hota hay?","The correct answer is **A: Afaal**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuchh afaal aur mafulat mean farq karnay kaa yeah eek ahem tariqah hay."" which translates to ""This is an important way to distinguish between verbs and nouns.""  It further implies that verbs are frequently capitalized (as nouns are).

Therefore, ""Afaal"" (verbs) are the parts of speech that are often used as capital letters within a sentence, differentiating them from nouns (Asmaa), qualities (Sifaat), and auxiliary verbs (Muavine Afaal).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi cheez asmaa key bady horoof honey ko ziyadah mushkil bana sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Likhna (Writing)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that it's *difficult to tell when writing* whether a word is used in its basic form (noun) or as a verb/adjective/etc.  While reading helps with this distinction, writing doesn't always make it clear. Options A, B, and D all refer to tasks that are *aided* by the capitalization of nouns; they are not the primary difficulty when *writing* to differentiate between nouns and other parts of speech."
Malaysia key dehee hisson mein kis isharay ka matlab “Aaiye” hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Haath hilanaa (Waving hand)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Leakin maleshiya, yaa cum az cum dehati malayayiyon key darmiyan, iss key maanee """"aa jaiye"""" key hain."" which translates to ""But in Malaysia, among rural Malays, it means ""come"".""  This refers to the gesture of waving a hand.



The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

* **A: Esharah ki unglee ko mornaa (Pointing a finger)** - The text doesn't mention this gesture.
* **C: Aala paanch karna (Giving a high five)** -  Not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Angutha dikhana (Showing the index finger)** - The text mentions the ""angushti shahadat"" (showing the index finger as a symbol of faith), but not a general gesture of ""come"".



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss esharey ka matlab “wapas aaiye” ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Hatheli bahar ki taraf dikha kar esharah karnaa (Indicating goodbye by facing the palm outward)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Isee tarah, span mean eek bartanvi musafir wapas aaney key esharay key tor parr (bajaye iss parr kehh uss shakhs co alwedaa kahaa jaye) hatheli kaa saamna karnaa shaamil kartay hoay kisee co alwedaa karnay mean ghalti karr sakta hay.""  This translates to: ""Similarly, in Spain, instead of saying goodbye (using a handshake), indicating goodbye by facing the palm outward can be a mistake when someone is returning.""

Therefore, facing the palm outward is associated with ""goodbye"" and, by extension, the opposite of ""come again.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, shagafon ki kiya wajah ho sakti hay?","सही उत्तर है **C: Girtey baraf key gaar (गिरते बर्फ के पहाड़)**।

**व्याख्या:**

प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि ग्लेशियर पिघलते नहीं हैं, बल्कि पहाड़ों के नीचे बहते हैं। इस प्रवाह के कारण दरारें और गहरी खाई बनती हैं, जो बर्फ की चट्टानों से ढकी होती हैं। बर्फ के पहाड़ों की छतें और दीवारें गिर सकती हैं, जिससे बाढ़ आ सकती है।

इसलिए, खाई का मुख्य कारण बर्फ के पहाड़ का गिरना है, जो बर्फ के प्रवाह के कारण होता है। 

अन्य विकल्प सही नहीं हैं:

*   **Baraf key pul (बर्फ के पुल):** बर्फ के पुल ग्लेशियर के ऊपर बनने वाली अस्थायी संरचनाएं हैं, खाई का कारण नहीं।
*   **Gair mustahkam glacier (गैर मस्टहकम ग्लेशियर):** हालांकि एक अस्थिर ग्लेशियर दरारें बना सकता है, यह खाई के विशिष्ट कारण नहीं है, जैसा कि विवरण में बताया गया है।
*   **Dheeley block (ढीले ब्लॉक):** ढीले ब्लॉक ग्लेशियर के किनारे गिर सकते हैं, लेकिन वे खाई के निर्माण के लिए सीधे तौर पर जिम्मेदार नहीं हैं।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inn mein sey kisko baraf key pul key zariyah chupaya ja sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Daradein (Avalanches)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that glaciers create deep cracks which are covered by ice and rock.  This, in turn, causes avalanches (daraaden band ho sakti hain) which are essentially massive slides of snow, ice, and debris.  The passage specifically mentions avalanches as a danger associated with glacial activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Baraf key gaar (Ice houses):** While ice houses *can* be affected by glacial activity, the passage doesn't directly link them to being ""hidden"" by a glacial ice bridge.
* **C: Deewarein (Walls):** The passage says walls can fall, but it doesn't imply they'd be *hidden* by an ice bridge.
* **D: Baday block (Large blocks):** Large blocks break off and slide, but they don't inherently *hide* anything under an ice bridge.

Therefore, the avalanche (daraaden) is the most directly related and logical answer based on the provided text.  The text implies that avalanches can be concealed *by* the glacial features.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kiss mahalle waqoo ka daurah karney sey pahley mosaafiron ko ezaafi ehteyaat karnaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Nyiragongo aatish fashaan**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""2002 mean goma co nairagongo aatish fashaan key laawa nay tabaah karr diyaa thaa..."" which translates to ""In 2002, the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma..."". It also mentions that research should be done to understand the current situation in the northern caves due to ongoing conflict.  Therefore, Nyiragongo volcano area is the place where travelers should exercise extra caution.
"
Darjah zail mein kon Goma mein kisi sayyah keliye achcha noktah nahein ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Shumaali Kivu ki ladayiaan tafreeh faraham kar rahi hein (The conflicts in North Kivu are providing entertainment)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""taham goma maqool hay, taham goma say baahir kisee bhee qism key doron parr shumali cueve soobay mean jaari ladayi kee haalat co samajhne key liye tehqiqat honey chaheen"" which translates to ""although Goma is affordable, even though Goma is in the outskirts, investigation needs to be done to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu."" This indicates that the conflicts are *not* a positive aspect for tourists and are a concern.

The other options are accurate based on the text:

*   **B: Yehh sastey pahadi Gorilla ki suraag rasaani key liye eek achchi jagah hay (This is a good place for tracking mountain gorillas at a low cost)** - The text says Goma is a base for gorilla tracking.
*   **C: Motorcycle taxiyaan gardo nawah mein jaaney keliye achcha zariyah hay (Motorcycle taxis are a good means of traveling around the city)** - The text says you can use bodas-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to explore the area around Goma.
*   **D: Nyiragongo aatish fashaan ki buniyaad shahar mein waqea hay (The Nyiragongo volcano is located in the city)** - The text states that the Nyiragongo volcano is located within the city of Goma.

Therefore, option A is the only one that presents a negative and inappropriate aspect for a tourist.



"
Agast mein ibtedayi dinn key liye mulk ki himayat yaaftah ijazat kabb dastiyaab hogi?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 Janury**.

The text states: ""Iss tor mayee mean ibtada kee kisee bhee tareekh key liye beak contry permit 1 januri say mohayya hogi."" which translates to ""Therefore, permits for any date in May will be available from January 1st."" Since August is later than May, the initial date for permits is January 1st.
"
Wadi ka tahaffuz karney key liye konsi policy jagah parr hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Ejazaton ki eek mahdood tadaad** (Permits have a limited number).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Permits kee eek mahdud taadad walk inn darkhwaston key liye reserve hay jo pehle aao, pehle paao kee bunyaad parr moyissar hone gee."" (A limited number of permits are reserved for walk-in requests based on a first-come, first-served basis.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek pahley aao, pahlaa mahfooz ijazat ka system** (First come, first served permit system) - While ""first come, first served"" is *part* of the system, it doesn't fully capture the policy. The key is that there's a limited number of permits.
* **B: Ijazatein sirf 1 januri ko dastiyab hein** (Permits are only available on January 1st) - This is false. The text says permits become available four months in advance.
* **C: Ijazatein sirf darkhawast lekar jaaney key zariyah haadil kiya ja sakta hay** (Permits can only be obtained by submitting an application) - This is also false. The text mentions walk-in requests as well.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon kam az kam mumkanah tor parr ebarat mein bayan kardah hotlon ki qism mein paaya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek cocktail bar**.

Here's why:

The text describes hotels as places where famous and wealthy people stayed, enjoying fine dining and nightlife.  While the text mentions ""raat kee zindagi"" (nightlife), it doesn't explicitly state or imply the presence of a cocktail bar. 

Let's look at why the other options are more likely:

* **B: Eek site parr petoo resturaan (Pet-friendly restaurant on site):**  Wealthy travelers often traveled with pets, so it's plausible a luxury hotel would accommodate them with a restaurant option.
* **C: Aisey saathi mehmaan jo qabiley shanakhat key liye mashhoor hein (Companions who are famous for their status):**  The text mentions that rulers and dignitaries stayed at these hotels, implying the presence of well-known and important guests.
* **D: Jadid aala darjah waley tajdid shudah haaliyah kamrey (New, high-end renovated rooms):** The text mentions ""jadid tareen sahuliyaat"" (the latest amenities) which strongly implies modern, renovated rooms.



Therefore, a cocktail bar is the least likely element explicitly mentioned or implied within the description of these historic luxury hotels.



"
"Ebarat mein pesh kardah malumaat ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail pesh kashon mein sey kisko hotel key mehmaan kam az kam mumkanah tor parr tarjeeh dengey?","The answer is **A: Puri jayedaad mein qadeem furnishings** (Traditional furnishings throughout the property).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that these hotels are known for their ""qadeem tarz kee lawazmaat"" (traditional furnishings) and are remnants from the early 20th century. They were frequented by wealthy and famous people who appreciated the old-world charm. While other options might be appealing, the passage strongly implies that the historical ambiance and unique character, including the traditional furnishings, are *key* to the hotel's appeal.  The passage explicitly mentions that the ""kirdaar key hisssay hain"" (are a part of the character) of these hotels.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Eek mumataaz bawarche walaa returaan** (An excellent restaurant): While important, the passage doesn't highlight the cuisine as a defining feature.
* **C: Eek raat ki tafreeh pesh karney walaa lounge** (A lounge offering nightlife):  The passage focuses on the historical aspect, not the entertainment.
* **D: Sastey kamron ki qimatein** (Cheap room prices): The passage mentions these are generally private properties and frequented by wealthy individuals. Cheap prices would be inconsistent with that description.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Mosaafiron key Greenland ka daurah karney sey kis cheez sey bacha ja sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ziyadah jarayem ki sharah key liye mashhoor makhsus elaqey**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Aam tor parr green land mean gher mulkiyon key saath, jurm, aur gher munsifana rawayyah, amli tor parr namalum hay. yahaan thak kehh qasbon mean bhee, koyee """"bray elaqay"""" nahein hain."" This means there are no known ""bad areas"" associated with crime.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bhaari kapdey lanaa, keonkehh mosam aam tor parr saal bharr garam hota hay:** The text says the *cold* weather is a real danger, and you need warm clothes.
* **C: Wahaan hotey waqt kaam karney ki tawaqqo karnaa, keonkehh internet connection dhundlah ho sakta hay:** The text says internet connection is good.
* **D: Bator eek “Eskimo” Greenland key eek maqami bashindah sey roju karnaa:** This is a cultural sensitivity issue. The text warns against using the term ""Eskimo"" as it can be offensive. It doesn't suggest that interacting with an Inuit person will prevent anything.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Greenland ka daurah karney waley gair tayyar mosaafiron key liye ziyadah mumkanah tor parr masalah walaa hotaa hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mosam (Weather)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Thanda mausam shayed woh waahid haqeeqi khatra hay jis kaa saamna ghairtiyar fard co karnaa paray ga..."" (Cold weather might be the only real danger that non-natives have to face...)
* **It also warns:** ""Agar aap sardi key mausam mean green land kee seyahat karnaa chahte hain...to iss baat co madde nazar rakhtay hoay kehh jitni door shumaal mean jayein gay utnee hee ziyadah sardi ho gee. Laazim hay kehh aap kaafi taadad mean garam kapday lay jayein."" (If you want to travel to Greenland in the cold weather...keeping in mind this point, the further north you go, the colder it will be. You must take plenty of warm clothes.)
* While other options like Nordic mosquitoes and crime are mentioned, the text directly highlights the severity and specific dangers posed by the cold weather.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Nordic machchar (Nordic mosquitoes):**  The text mentions mosquitoes in the summer, noting their bites can be irritating, but it doesn't frame them as a primary or serious danger.
* **B: Jurm (Crime):** While the text mentions avoiding using the word ""Greenland"" as it has negative connotations, it doesn't explicitly state that crime is a significant problem for tourists.
* **D: Maqami log (Local people):** The text provides important cultural information about avoiding negative connotations with the name ""Greenland,"" but it doesn't describe local people as a direct threat to tourists.



"
Markazi plaza key tor parr darjah zail mein sey kisko abb istemaal kiya jataa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Templo de San Diego**.

The passage states: ""Yeah abb markazi plaza key toor pur com karta hay our iss mean hamishah cheezein, dunn our raat, chalti rehti hain."" This translates to ""Yeah now it functions as a central plaza and things are always happening in it, day and night.""  It also mentions that the remaining structure is the ""Templo de San Diego"".

Therefore, the central plaza is now used as the **Templo de San Diego**.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko Jardín de la Jamaat mein nahein payaa jaa sakta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Eek purani convent ki emaarat (An old convent building)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Jarden day law union...jis key tarz kee baaqi rehney waali waahid emarat templo day sawn diyago hay."" which translates to ""...of which the remaining structure is an old convent building."" This means the convent building *is* present in the garden.

The passage also mentions:

* **Mahafile mosiqui walaa markazi gazebo (Central gazebo where music events are held):** ""...yahaan aksar markazi gazebo say mufta concert pesh kayey jaatay hain."" (concerts are often performed from the central gazebo.)
* **Purani ishqiyah kahaani kaa ghar (Home of an old love story):** ""Callejon del beso (bosah kee gully) sarf 69 centy meter say jadaa kee gayee doo balkaniyon eek praani mohabat kee dastan kaa ghar hay."" (Callejon del beso, separated by only 69 centimeters, two balconies are the home of an old love story.)
* **Baagh ka samnaa karta resturaan (Restaurant facing the garden):** ""Bagh key gird woo pesh kayee eek rasturan hain..."" (Several restaurants are located around the garden...)



Therefore, only option D is incorrect based on the passage.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, dinn key paidal safar key baarey mein darjah zail mein sey konsa bayaniyah na durust samjha jayegaa?","The incorrect statement regarding daytime walking trips, based on the provided text, is:

**D: Dinn ka paidal safar bachchon waley khandaano key liye eek monasib bahari sargarmi nahein hay** (Daytime walking trips are not a suitable outdoor activity for families with young children).

**Explanation:**

The text explicitly states: ""Chhote bachon waale ahal khaanah cow ziyadah tayariyon kee zaroorat padsakti hain, lekin bachon aur pre-school key bachon key saath bhee eek rozah out doors aasani say mumkin hai-"" (Families with young children require more preparation, but it is also easily possible to go outdoors with children and pre-school children one day at a time).

Therefore, option D is directly contradicted by the text.  Options A, B, and C are all supported by the information given.



**So the correct answer is D.**
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek din key paidal safar ko bahut kam tayyari ki kabb zarurat hoti hay?","The correct answer is **J: Jabb paidal safar eek mazeed qudrati mahaul mein ho**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hiking ek aawat door srgarmi hay jis mean, aksar pedal shahrah purr qadarti maahul mean chalna hota hay..."" This translates to ""Hiking is an activity where, often, walking in a natural environment is involved..."" 

The question asks when minimal preparation is needed for a *day* of walking. The passage suggests that walking in a natural environment (a ""qadarti maahul"") is the core of hiking and implying that's where the activity typically takes place.  While fitness and ease of walking are helpful, the passage emphasizes the natural environment as the defining characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Jabb paidal safar karney walaa jismani tor parr fit ho:** Fitness is helpful, but the passage doesn't say it's *essential* for *minimal* preparation.
* **B: Jabb ismein ziyadah aasan pagdandi shaamil ho:**  Easy walking is preferred, but not a prerequisite for minimal preparation.  The passage doesn't focus on walking ease.
* **C: Jabb bachchey paidal safar parr jaa rahey hon:**  Walking with children requires *more* preparation, as the passage mentions.



"
Norway key baaqi ki banisbat Rogaland yaa Agder key plateau key baarey mein mukhtalif kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Unkaa aksar heather mein ehaatah hota hay (They are often surrounded by heather)**.

Here's why:

The text states that in Rogaland and Agder, plateaus are commonly called ""hayee,"" meaning treeless moorlands that rise sharply from the fjords.  The passage *doesn't* say they are *not* surrounded by heather. In fact, the context implies that ""hayee"" are characteristic of moorlands, which are often covered in heather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unmein darakht hein (They have trees):** The text explicitly says these plateaus are ""bekhart"" (without trees).
* **B: Koyi fjords nahein hein (They have no fjords):** The text says they rise sharply *from the fjords*.
* **C: Plateau ziyadah tar taaq hotey hein (Plateaus are mostly rocky):** While the text mentions they rise abruptly, it doesn't say they are primarily rocky. It focuses on their treeless nature and proximity to fjords.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Norway keliye aam nahein hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Jangalaati plateau (Forested plateau)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage describes Norway as having deep, open places and valleys that suddenly rise to high, steep levels. It specifically mentions ""wide"" places, meaning vast, treeless areas.
*   The passage defines ""hayee"" (moorlands) as treeless, open moorland.
*   **Jangalaati plateau (Forested plateau)** is the opposite of what Norway is described as having. The passage emphasizes treeless landscapes.

Therefore, a forested plateau would not be a common feature of Norway according to the passage. The other options (wide open spaces, steep fjords, and moorlands) all align with the description provided.
"
Skiing mein dilchaspi rakhaney waaley sayyaon ko pahadi station kaa daurah kabb karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Mosame sarmaa key doraan (During the winter season)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Taham mausam surma mean vahan alag hee tarah kee khubsurati our dilkashi hoti hay, bahot say hill steshon mean achhi barf baari hoti hay **our vahan skiing aur snowboarding kee sargarmiyan arooj purr hoti hain.**"" This translates to: ""However, in the winter season there is a different kind of beauty and charm there, many hill stations have good snowfall and **activities like skiing and snowboarding are at their peak**.""

Therefore, the best time for those interested in skiing is during the winter season.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, aam tor parr kabb ziyaadah tarr sayyah pahadi station parr hotey hein?","The correct answer is **C: Hindustani mosame garma key doraan (During the Indian summer)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Hill stations purr seyahat kaa mausam aam toor purr hindustani mausam garma mean arooj purr hota hay.""  This translates to ""The peak season for tourism in hill stations is generally during the Indian summer.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bhaari baraf baari key jhamelon key doraan (During heavy snowfall):** While snowfall is mentioned as a beautiful aspect, it's not the *general* peak season.  Heavy snowfall might restrict travel for some.
* **B: Purey snowboarding season key doraan (During the entire snowboarding season):** Snowboarding is mentioned as an activity, but it's not the dominant reason for most people visiting hill stations.  The snowboarding season is likely a smaller portion of the overall hill station tourism.
* **D: Purey mosamey sarmaa key mahinon mein (During the entire winter season):** The passage contrasts the summer season with the winter season, stating that while winter has its beauty, the summer is generally the peak.



Therefore, option C is the only option that directly reflects the information provided in the passage.
"
agar aap madad ki talaash karney waali kashti milney ki tawaqqo karr rahey hein to aap ko kiya karney sey bachna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **D: Saathi kashti ka safar karney walon ko nazar andaaz karnaa**

Here's why:

The passage states you should try to connect with as many people as possible to find the ship needing help. Option D directly contradicts this. Ignoring other ships means missing opportunities to find the ship that needs assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dock sey ooper aur neechey chalnaa:** The passage doesn't mention anything about avoiding movement on the docks.
* **B: Kaptanon ka dost banana:** While potentially helpful, it's not specifically warned against. The passage focuses on broad outreach.
* **C: Apni khidmaat ka ishtehaar karnaa:** This is directly encouraged by the passage (""elaan lagayein"").



"
Madad ki darkaar kisi kashti ko talaash kartey waqt aap ko marinas key gardo nawah mein kiya karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Jahaaz raano key saath rabetah karein (Establish contact with the ship's helmsman)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Baar mein jehaaz raanon say raabtah karnay kee koshish karnay waghairah key silsilay mein aap elaan lagayein gay.""  This translates to: ""You will make announcements, including trying to establish contact with the ship's helmsman.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: radar key taht qaem rahein (Remain under radar):** The text doesn't mention radar.
* **C: Logon key apney yaat ko saaf karney key waqt sirf unn tak pahunchney ki koshish karein (Only try to reach those while cleaning people's memory):** This is a very specific and narrow instruction, not the general approach outlined.
* **D: Saathi safar karney walon sey bachein (Avoid traveling companions):** The passage encourages talking to as many people as possible.



"
Jazeerah key samraaji taarikh mien dilchaspi rakhney waley kisi sayyah keliye konsa mahalle waqoo dilchasp hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kowloon waterfront**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Hong Kong jazeeray kee shehri tamirat kee eek kaseer taadad kee bharmaar shamali saahil key saath mojud qaabli istemaal banayi gayee zameen purr hay. Yeah woh jagah hay jasay bartanvi samrajiyon nay apna banaa lia thaa...too iss kee sharoaat karnay key liye yeah eek achhi jagah hay.""

This directly points to the Kowloon waterfront as a place where the colonial history is evident and interesting for travelers interested in that period.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Shumaali saahil (Northern Coast):** While the passage mentions development along the northern coast, it doesn't emphasize its historical significance for those interested in colonial history.
* **C: Hong Kong ka nichlaa shahar (Hong Kong's Lower City):** The passage doesn't offer any specific details about the Lower City's historical appeal.
* **D: Victoria Harbor:**  Victoria Harbor is mentioned as a scenic location, but not specifically for its colonial history.



"
Shaandar manazir ko tarjeeh deney waley kisi sayyah key liye konsa mahalle waqoo dilchasp hogaa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kowloon waterfront**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hong Kong kaa behtareen nazarah karnay key liye jazirah co chhodo our iss key bilmaqabil colon water front purr jaao."" This translates to ""For the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon waterfront instead.""

Therefore, the Kowloon waterfront is highlighted as the best location for enjoying the scenery.
"
Rukaab mein fansey ksisi sawaar key pair key khatrey ko kam karney mein madad karney walee kuch zeenon mein kiya hota hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Hifaazati salaakhein (Safety straps)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions that some saddles, particularly English saddles, have ""safety straps"" that prevent the leather saddle from slipping backward if the rider is pulled. This directly addresses the danger of a rider's foot getting trapped in the stirrup and being dragged.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Tang talvey (Tight boots):** While tight boots are recommended, they don't directly prevent a foot from getting trapped in the stirrup. They primarily help keep the foot in place.
* **C: Chamdey ki rukabein (Leather stirrups):**  The text doesn't mention leather stirrups as a safety feature. It focuses on the type of boots.
* **D: Azeem tarr istehkaam (Greater stability):** While stability is a benefit of good stirrups, it's not a *specific* safety feature designed to prevent entrapment.
"
Sawaar honey waley jutah ki konsi khosusiyat sawaar ki hifaazat ko rukaab istemaal kartey waqt badhaney mein madad karti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek khurdura, tang talva (A rough, tight sole)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ziyaad tar sawwaar sawari key aise jootay pehantey hain jis mean lambi eedhi how, hamwaar how, kaafi tang how aur tanha how."" This translates to: ""Most riders wear such shoes that have a long heel, a smooth sole, are quite tight, and have no openings.""  While not directly mentioning ""rough"" sole, a rough sole provides better grip and prevents the foot from slipping, contributing to safety.  The other options are either not mentioned or are incorrect based on the passage:

* **B: Chamdaa (Leather)** - While leather is often used, the passage doesn't highlight leather's specific safety features.
* **C: Eek aedi (A heel)** - The passage explicitly mentions a *long* heel (lambi eedhi how), implying heel height isn't the primary safety feature.
* **D: Eek chodaa talva (A wide sole)** - The passage states the sole should be *narrow* (kaafi tang how), not wide.

Therefore, a rough, tight sole provides the necessary grip and stability for safer riding with a rakaab (stirrup).
"
Mehmaan nawazi tabadlah ke network key zariyah mosaafiron ko kiya pesh kash ki jaati hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Maqami mezbaano key saath rehaeshein (Accommodation with local hosts)**.

The passage clearly states that hospitality exchange networks connect travelers with local residents in the cities they are visiting. This connection primarily offers accommodation with these hosts. While the passage mentions other aspects like reviews and the initial idea of finding a place to stay, the core offering is accommodation with local hosts.
"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, mehmaan nawazi key tabaadlah network key baarey mein darjah zail konsa bayaniyah sahee nahi hay?","The incorrect statement is **A: Mosaafiron ko hamesha maqami mezbaano key hawaley faraham kiye jaatey hein (Travelers are always provided with local hosts)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the network connects travelers with *local residents*. However, it also mentions that *sometimes* traveler reviews of other travelers are included. This indicates it's not *always* a direct, one-to-one connection between a traveler and a host. The possibility of reviews suggests a more complex interaction, not always a direct host assignment.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Kuch network mein mosaafiron ki ezaafi tasdeeq darkaar hoti hay (Some networks require additional verification of travelers)** - The text says some networks *request* additional verification. This is accurate.
* **C: Mosaafiron ko manzil shahar mein dastiyaab mehmaan nawazon ki eek fihrist faraham ki jaye gee (Travelers will be provided with a list of available hosts in the destination city)** - The text directly mentions that travelers will receive a list of available hosts.
* **D: Baaz auqaat mosaafiron key liye maqami mehmaan nawazon key jayezey dastiyaab hotey hein (Sometimes reviews of local hosts are available for travelers)** - The text mentions traveler reviews of other travelers are *sometimes* available, making this accurate.



Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss qism ka mehmaan kam az kam mumkanah tor parr kisi hotel key mushtarekha kamrah mein paya jata hay?","The correct answer is **B: Akelaa safar karney walaa eek mehmaan (A single traveler)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that while hostels are primarily for young people, you *can* find other travelers there. 
* A single traveler fits the description of ""other travelers"".
* The text explicitly mentions families are rare, and while some hostels have private rooms, it doesn't indicate a high likelihood of finding families.

Let's break down why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Unkey shuruaati bees ka eek mehmaan (A young person in their early twenties):**  While hostels are for young people, the text doesn't guarantee you'll *always* find someone in their early twenties.
* **C: Chotey bachchon key saath safar karney walaa eek mehmaan (A traveler with young children):** The text says families are *rare*.
* **D: Unkey darkiyaani tees kaa eek mehmaan (A person in their thirties):** While possible, there's no specific indication in the text that people in their thirties are commonly found in hostels.



Therefore, the most likely guest you'll find in a hostel, according to the passage, is a single traveler."
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, hastal mein kiskey thaharney ka bahut ziyadah imkaan hay?","The correct answer is **B: Teen 22-saalah safar karney waley eek saath** (Three 22-year-old travelers together).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Hostels bilkhusus naujawanon kee mezbani kartay hain"" - Hostels especially host young people. This suggests a high probability of finding young travelers.
* **The passage mentions:** ""aap co vahan dosray musafir bhee mill jayein gay"" - you will also find other travelers there.
* **The passage states:** ""Bachon key saath khandaan shaaz wo naadir dekhnay co miltay hain"" - Families with children are rare to see.

Therefore, the group of three 22-year-old travelers fits the description of who is *most likely* to stay in a hostel according to the passage. The other options are less likely based on the information provided.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsaa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr boomerang fenkney ki wazahat karta hay?","The correct answer is **D: Sirf kuch boomerang waapas honey key qaabil hein (Only some boomerangs are capable of returning)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...you need a boomerang that is capable of returning."" This means not all boomerangs are returning boomerangs.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The passage doesn't guarantee a boomerang will always return if thrown correctly. It implies skill and the right boomerang are needed.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage focuses on the *returnable* boomerang, not its popularity among tourists vs. locals.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The passage states that boomerangs are *found* in Australia, implying they are available, just that many aren't returning ones.



"
Buniyaadi tor parr darjah zail mein sey kon Javanese kaana mein istemaal hoti hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Nariyal ki shakkar (Coconut sugar)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jawiyani khaaney, ju abb puray jazeeray mean wasee paimanay purr dastiyaab hain, yeah mukhtalif qasm key mosami khaaney hain, jinn key mashhur zaiqon mean moong phalee, march, cheeni (khaas tor purr jawiyani key naril kee cheeni) our mukhtalif khushbo daar masale hotay hain.""

This translates to: ""Javanese foods, which are now widely available throughout the island, are various types of seasonal foods, whose famous flavors include mung beans, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various fragrant spices.""

Therefore, coconut sugar is specifically mentioned as a key ingredient in Javanese cuisine.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, koyi motaddi beemari kaisey failti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Pathogen**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens.** The passage defines ""mutaadi marz"" (infectious disease) as being caused by ""wires, bacterium, fungus yaa deegar tafili jaraseem"" (viruses, bacteria, fungus, or other pathogenic germs).  A pathogen is a general term for a disease-causing agent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pathogen:** While technically correct (because infectious diseases are *caused* by pathogens), the passage is asking *how* a contagious disease *spreads*, not what causes it.
* **C: Bacterium:**  Bacteria are *one type* of pathogen, not the general answer to how a disease spreads. The passage mentions bacteria, but doesn't say that bacteria are the *only* way a disease spreads.
* **D: Vaccination:** Vaccination is a *prevention* method, not a cause or means of spread for a disease. The passage mentions vaccination as a required measure for travelers, but it doesn't explain how the disease spreads.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi motaddi beemari key sabab bananey key liye kiya mashhoor nahein hay?","The correct answer is **A: Vaccination**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bahut saree hukumatein mulk mean daakhil honey waale zaireen yaa milk say baahir jaaney waale shahriyon cow mutadid beemariyon kee wexin deenay kee zaroorat hoti hai."" This means vaccines are given *to prevent* infectious diseases.

* **The passage also defines infectious diseases as caused by:** ""wires, bacterium, fungus yaa deegar tafili jaraseem"" (viruses, bacteria, fungus, or other pathogenic germs).

* **Vaccination** is a preventative measure, not a cause of infectious diseases. Viruses, bacteria, and fungi are the *causes* of infectious diseases.

Therefore, vaccination is the option that is *not* a known cause of infectious diseases according to the text.
"
kis manzar naamah mein zaati VPN parr kisi web proxy ka intekhaab karnaa saarif key liye kaafi hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Saarif ko censorship aur jahaan tak mumkin ho jasusi sey bachney ki fikar hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights VPNs' key advantages:**
    * **Traffic redirection:** VPNs reroute *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP.
    * **Enhanced security:** VPNs are encrypted, making eavesdropping difficult.
    * **Circumventing restrictions:** The passage implies VPNs are useful for bypassing censorship and restrictions (by mentioning filtering and traffic routing).

* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Saarif tamaam traffic ka rastah badalna chahata hay:** While true, this is a *characteristic* of VPNs, not the primary *motivation* for using one.
    * **C: Saarif buniyaadi tor parr http traffic ka rastah badal rahaa hay:** This describes a basic proxy, not a VPN. The passage explicitly states VPNs handle *all* traffic.
    * **D: Saarif ki sargarmi ko aala satah bandwidth parr eek motadil ki darkaar hay:** Bandwidth is not directly mentioned as a key benefit of VPNs in the passage. While encryption *can* impact bandwidth, it's not the central reason people choose VPNs.



Therefore, the concern about censorship and avoiding surveillance aligns most closely with the VPN's benefits as described in the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, VPNs aur web proxy key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: VPNs sirf http traffic ka rastah badal sakta hay**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text explicitly states:** ""Wah sarf each tea tea pie http kaa hee nahein, balkah internet key tamaam traffic kaa naya rasta banatay hain."" (They don't just create a new path for HTTP traffic, but for *all* internet traffic.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: VPNs aam tor parr web proxy sey ziyaadah aala bandwidth ki pesh kash karta hay:** The text implies VPNs provide a better experience (""behtareen tariqah hain"" - the best way) and offer superior service (""aaliya bendoth our khadmat kaa behtarmayar pesh kartay hain""), suggesting a better bandwidth experience compared to web proxies.
* **B: Web proxy tamaam web traffic ka rasta nahein badal sakta:** The text says, ""Wah sarf each tea tea pie http kaa hee nahein..."" meaning web proxies *don't* create a new path for all traffic.
* **C: Web proxy mein VPNs ki ba nisbat kam tarr khidmat ka meyaar hota hay:** The text indicates VPNs offer better service (""behtarmayar pesh kartay hain""), implicitly meaning web proxies have a lower service quality.

Therefore, option D directly contradicts the information presented in the text.
"
Apney fauri elaqay sey baahar kisi phone ki company ka istemaal karney kissi shakhs ko kiya ijazat deti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Internet key raastey waali calein (Internet pathways)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Chonkeh's internet key allows you to use a phone company in *anywhere* you are, regardless of local availability. This is because the internet connection bypasses the traditional phone network (PSTN).  The ability to select a number that appears to be from a different location is a direct result of using the internet for communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aalami phone key number (International phone number):** While using an international number *can* allow you to call from anywhere, the passage focuses on the broader concept of using internet pathways to circumvent local phone company restrictions.
* **C: Satellitein (Satellites):**  Satellites are a *means* of internet connectivity, but the passage isn't primarily about satellite technology itself. It's about using the *internet pathway* that satellites (and other technologies) enable.
* **D: PSTN key phone (PSTN phones):** The passage is talking about bypassing the PSTN entirely with internet-based solutions.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, makhsus kalein wosul karney keliye kis cheez ki zarurat ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Eek aalami number kharidein (Buy a toll-free number)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aksar aap eek aalimi number alga say kharidna padta hay jo aap key liye pay-one-number se call karnaa mumkin banata hay."" (Often you have to buy a toll-free number separately which makes it possible to call from your pay-one-number.)

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Eek maqami phone company istemaal karein (Use a local phone company):** The passage argues *against* relying on local phone companies, suggesting they might not be necessary if you use a different method.
* **C: Apni maqami community sey eek number haasil karein (Obtain a number from your local community):**  The passage says you *don't* need to get a local number if you're using internet-based communication.
* **D: Eek PSTN phone khridein (Buy a PSTN phone):**  The passage doesn't mention PSTN phones at all.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is buying a toll-free/national number.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon durust tor parr itli zubaan key alfaaz key talaffuz ki wazahat nahein karti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek doharey r ka talaffuz wahid r sey mukhtalif tor parr hota hay** (A double 'r' is pronounced differently from a single 'r').

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Nez, aar our rr kaa talfaz mukhtalif toor par adaa karnaa yaqeeni banayein: kiro kaa matlab azeez hay, jabkah carro kaa matlab bighi hay.""  This means a double 'r' *is* pronounced differently.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **B: Aksar alfaaz ka talaffuz usi tarah hota hay jaisey unhein likhaa jaata hay** (Most words are pronounced as they are written): This is stated directly: ""Italian zubaan kaa talaffuz nisbatan aasaan hota hay keunkah ziyadah ther alfaz balkal asee tarah bolay jaatay hain jis tarah likhay jaatay hain.""
* **C: Horoof c aur g waley alfaaz mushkil ho saktay hein** (Words with the letters 'c' and 'g' can be difficult): The text says ""Wah khaas haroof jinn purr dhiyaan rakhna chahiye wah see our jee hain halankah inn kaa talafaz mandarjah zeal haroof elat kee bunyaad purr tabdil hota hay."" This implies that 'c' and 'g' (which are related to 'ch' and 'gi' sounds) can be tricky.
* **D: Ziyadah tar alfaaz ka talaffuz darjah zail horooge ellat ki buniyaad parr mukhtalif hota hay** (Most words are pronounced differently based on the following vowel): The text states: ""mandarjah zeal haroof elat kee bunyaad purr tabdil hota hay."" This means the pronunciation changes based on the vowel that follows the consonant.



Therefore, the only incorrect statement is about the double 'r' pronunciation.



"
Izmir ki darjah zail konsi khosusiyaat jadid zamaanah sey pahley paida hui theen?,"Correct answer is **D: Surkh tile waali chatein (Red-tiled roofs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yahaan key kashadah balwaar, saamney say sheesha lagi emaraat, our modern shopping centres jinn purr laal rung kee tyle waali chhatein hain..."" which translates to ""Here's a bustling boulevard, with glass-clad skyscrapers, and modern shopping centers, among which are red-tiled roofs.""  The phrase ""red-tiled roofs"" is presented as something existing *alongside* the modern developments, suggesting it's a characteristic from the older, traditional Izmir.

The other options are more explicitly linked to the modern aspects of the city:

*   **A: Wasee boulevard (Wide boulevards):**  Mentioned as a current feature.
*   **B: Samaney sheeshey ki khosusiyat waali emaratein (Skyscrapers with glass features facing forward):** Clearly modern developments.
*   **C: Kharidari key marakiz (Shopping centers):** Also modern.

Therefore, the red-tiled roofs are the feature described as existing *before* the modern developments began to dominate.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Izmir ki durust Khosusiyat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Aap jadid kharidari key maraakiz aur puraney church dono ko talaash kar saktey hein (You can find both modern shopping centers and old churches).**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions ""modern shopping centers"" and ""18th century bazaar"" and ""ancient mosques"". There's no mention of old churches.
* The passage explicitly states Izmir is a major port and has a large bay.
* The passage emphasizes Izmir's blend of modern and traditional elements, describing it as a ""new, developed, and bustling commercial center"" with both ""glass-clad skyscrapers"" and ""traditional Turkish atmosphere"".

Therefore, the presence of old churches is not mentioned as a characteristic of Izmir according to the provided text.



"
Hanami lafz kiss cheez key nazarah kaa hawalah deta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Cherry khilti hay**.

The text states that ""Cheery blasam"" (cherry blossom) is what people go to see, and that ""hanami"" refers to this. It also mentions that the tradition originated in China with plum blossoms, but became associated with cherry blossoms in Japan."
Cherry key khilney ka nazarah karney key liye waqf pahli dawaton ki mezbaani kisney ki tee?,"The correct answer is **C: Japan key shahanshah**.

The text states: ""Japan mean pehli cheery blazam partiyon kee ziyafat shahanshah faqat apnay liye our shahanshahi darbar key gird woo pesh key arkaani ashrafiya kee liye karta thaa."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom parties were held by the emperor only for himself and those close to the imperial court, and also for the leading nobles around the imperial court.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, yrroshalam ka darjah zail konsa marhalah kam az kam seyahat ki targeeb deney key liye mumkin hay?","The best answer is **A: Shahar ki mazhabi ahmiyat (Religious Importance of the City)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states that Jerusalem is a religious, spiritual, and cultural center for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.** This religious significance is presented as a *major reason* for tourism to Jerusalem.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Israel key darul hokumati shahr ka iska darja (Its status as the capital of Israel):** While being the capital is a factor, the text emphasizes religious significance more heavily as a reason for tourism.  The text even notes that some nations don't recognize Israel's claim to Jerusalem as capital.
* **C: Iski saqafati pesh kashein (Its cultural attractions):** The text mentions cultural sites but doesn't highlight them as the primary driver of tourism.  It states they exist alongside other attractions.
* **D: Bahut sey tarikhee maqamat (Many historical monuments):** Similar to cultural attractions, historical monuments are mentioned, but the *religious* aspect is presented as more central.

Therefore, the *religious importance* is the most fundamental and explicitly emphasized reason for Jerusalem's tourist appeal according to the given text.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsa ebarat mein iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh kiss cheez key liye yarroshalam mashhoor hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Seyasi asaro rosukh (Political influence)**.

The passage explicitly mentions Jerusalem's historical, religious, and cultural significance. It also notes it as the seat of the Israeli government. However, it doesn't directly state that Jerusalem is famous for its political influence. While it is the political center, the focus of the passage is more on its historical, religious, and cultural aspects that draw tourists.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss qism key mosaafir ko jangali card kharidney sey fayedah nahein hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Eek mosaafir jo sirf Kruger qomi Park ka daurah karr raha hay.**

Here's why:

The text states that a ""wild card"" is beneficial for someone visiting ""South African national parks (seen parks)"" or ""all South African national parks.""  

* **Option B** describes someone only visiting Kruger National Park. Since they aren't visiting multiple parks, they wouldn't benefit from a wild card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Someone planning to visit as many SANParks as possible *would* benefit from a wild card, as it provides access to all or many of them.
* **C:** While a budget traveler might be concerned about fees, the text suggests a wild card *could* be beneficial even for budget travelers.  It doesn't explicitly say a budget concern would negate the benefit.
* **D:** Someone visiting Kruger *and* at least one other park *would* benefit from a wild card, as it covers multiple parks.



"
Konsa bayaniyah durust tor parr Kruger qomi Park ki wazahat nahein karta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Yehh jonubi Africa key qomi parkon mein sabsey chota hay** (This is the smallest national park in South Africa).

Here's why:

* **The text states the opposite:** The text explicitly says ""Iss park key liye bhee yumiah tahfuz our intery kee fees hay. Yeah kasee keliye eek wild card khareedne key lehaaz say bhee fayedah mand hosakta hai, ju janubi afriqah key parkon key intekhaab yaa jonubi afriqah key tamaam qomi parkon mean daakhlah farahim karta hai."" (There are also conservation and entry fees for this park. It can also be beneficial for those to buy a wild card, which provides access to South Africa's parks or all of South Africa's national parks.) This implies Kruger is a significant park, not the smallest.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Issey jonubi Africa ki asal kashish samjha jaata hay** (It is considered the main attraction of South Africa) - This is directly stated in the text.
* **B: Park key bahut sey ecozone mein jangli zindagi mukhtalif hoti hay** (Wildlife is diverse in many of the park's ecozones) -  This is also stated in the text.
* **D: Yehh jangali card kharidney key zariyah aaney walon key liye qabile rasayi hay** (It is accessible to those who come by purchasing a wildlife card) - This is directly mentioned in the text.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon pahad key ziyadah khadey hisson parr chadhney walon key liye sabsey ziyadah khatarnaki ki wajah bananey ka imkaan hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Chotey gaar (Small cave)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Choti key qareeb eek chhota saw ghar mojud hay jasay abur kiya jaana zaruri hay, yeah kaafi neecha hay aur bahut hee tang hay. yeah alee alfoor khatarnaak ho sakta hay"" which translates to ""Near the small peak there is a small cave which needs to be climbed, it is very low and very cramped. This small cave can be very dangerous.""

The text warns about the dangers of the small cave due to its low and cramped conditions.  While other options present challenges, the text specifically highlights the potential danger of the small cave.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Tarr surate haal (Steep slopes):** The text mentions steep slopes and acknowledges they are difficult to climb, but it doesn't specifically point to them as the *most* dangerous factor.
* **B: Patthar key qadam (Stone steps):** The text says stone steps are built on the more traveled paths, suggesting they improve safety.
* **D: Steel key taar (Steel wires):** The text mentions steel wires being used by those who climb the lower parts, indicating they provide assistance and don't pose a danger themselves.



"
Darjah zail konsa bayaniyah ebarat mein wazahat kardah Machu Picchu pahaad ki chadhaayi ki durust tor parr akkaasi karta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Tarr honay key waqt ziyadah khadey hissey khatarnaak ho jaatey hein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""toqaa cro kahh tumhara sans leena mashkal hoga our bhegi haalat mean ziyadah chhachlay hasoon mein utarnay say ahtiyaat karein kiyon kahh yeah alee alfoor khatarnaak ho sakta hay."" (It's so high that you'll have trouble breathing, and be careful when descending slippery slopes as it can be very dangerous). This directly relates to option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Neez fit chadhney walon ki bhee saans band honaa mumkin hogaa (Even those who climb lower may have difficulty breathing):** The passage focuses on the *high* altitude of Machu Picchu.  While breathing difficulty might occur at any altitude, it's not the primary point about the *climb*.
* **B: Ziyadah khaday hisson mein koyi handrail nahein hein (There are no handrails in the steeper sections):** The passage *does* mention handrails in the areas where people use ropes, indicating that some areas *do* have safety measures.
* **C: Aap ko choti par kisi gaar key zariyah guzarna zaruri hay (You must pass through a cave at the top):** The passage describes a small, tight cave near the bottom, not at the top.



Therefore, option D is the only one accurately reflected in the given text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inmein sey kon Majorcan khana ka asal staple nahein hay?","The correct answer is **C: Anaaj (Cereals)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that Majorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil.
*   Bread (roti) is mentioned as a staple, particularly for dinner.
*   Vegetables are also mentioned as a key component.
*   While the passage mentions food *with* bread (like tuna or cheese), it doesn't mention grain-based staples like rice, wheat, or other cereals being a primary part of the diet. Therefore, cereals are not a core staple of Majorcan cuisine according to the provided text."
"Ebarat ki malumaat ki buniyaad parr, hangi khanon key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Hangi ka garam patthar istemaal karnaa Wellington mein dastiyaab nahein hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Rotovrah mean mutadid maqamat zamini haandi pesh kartay hain, jabkah deegar haandiyon key christ church, wellington our kahein our say namunay liye jaa saktay hain.""  This means hangi (and therefore the use of heated stones) *is* available in Wellington, along with other locations.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Geothermal hangi bartan garam karney key liye aag sey garam pattharon ka istemaal kartey hein:** The passage says ""Ghar yaa to aug say garam hoay pathron say garam hota hay, yaa kachh maqamat mean geothermal hararat zamini elaqay co qadarti tor purr garam kar deeti hai"". This directly supports the statement.
* **C: Bhuna hua raat ka khana aksar hangi istemaal kartey huey pakaya jaata hay:** The passage says ""Rawayati angithi tarz purr raat kaa khaana pakanay keliye aksar haingi kaa istemaal kiya jaata hay."" This indicates that hangi is often used to cook dinner.
* **D: Geothermal hangi ko Rotorua mein paya ja saktaa hay:** The passage says ""Rotovrah mean mutadid maqamat zamini haandi pesh kartay hain..."" This directly supports the statement.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko hangi bartan garam karney key liye aam tariqah key tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Gas**.

The text mentions the following methods for heating hangi:

* **Garam patthar (Hot stones):**  The text explicitly states that houses are heated with hot stones.
* **Geothermal garmi (Geothermal heat):**  The text mentions that in some locations, geothermal heat naturally warms the ground.
* **Hangi (Traditional oven):** The text describes using hangi for cooking dinner at night.

Gas is not mentioned as a method for heating hangi in the provided text. Therefore, it's the correct answer.

**Note:** There is a duplicate option ""Garam patthar"" in your list. This doesn't change the answer. The question asks which method is *not* mentioned, and gas isn't."
Kis cheez ki wajah sey kisi rahib ya raahibah ki taraf sey khosusi shanakhat hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Eek chamakdaar dhanka hua lehaaf odhna (Wearing a shiny, embroidered shawl)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...agar aap apni chaadar, khaas tor purr chamakdar rangon waali laatay hain, to darwazay purr rahib yaa rahibah maskarahat key saath aap kaa kheer muqadam karay gee."" This translates to ""...if you wear your shawl, especially one with shiny colors, the monk or nun at the door will greet you with a smile.""

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

* **B: Apney kandhon ko dhanknaa (Covering one's shoulders):**  While covering shoulders is generally expected, the text focuses on the *shiny color* of the shawl.
* **C: Khanqaah sey eek lehaaf udhaar lenaa (Borrowing a shawl from the khanqah):**  Borrowing a shawl is mentioned as a possibility, but not the reason for a special welcome.
* **D: Ghutno key oper sey kati eek skirt pahanana (Wearing a skirt cut above the knees):** This is mentioned as a requirement for women but not the reason for a special welcome.  The welcome is tied to the *color* of the shawl.



"
Darjah zail mein sey konsey kapday ki ashyaa mumkanah tor parr kisi khanaqaah sey udhaar leney key liye dastiyaab nahein hay? ,"The correct answer is **B: Short**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""इस क़तार में मर्दों को तकनीया दहकना वाला पायजामा ज़ीब पहनना ज़रूरी होता है।"" (In this line, it is necessary for men to wear trousers). It also mentions men can borrow clothing from the store but it isn't something that will fit every man perfectly. Skirts are specifically mentioned for women. Shorts are not mentioned and would be highly unlikely to be accepted or available for borrowing in this context, especially given the conservative nature implied in the description of the Khanqah.

Antarctic elaqon ka daurah kartey waqt kabb eek mosaafir key paas sitaron ko dekhney key liye sabsey ziyadah mawaqey hotey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Mosame sarmaa key mahino key doraan (During the winter months)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aap mausam sarma mean arctic yaa intartica key allaqon kaa dorah kartay hain aap polar night kaa tajarbah karein gay, iss kaa matlab yeah hay kahh soraj afq key oper nahein ugta hay."" (If you travel to the Arctic or Antarctic regions during winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.)

* The polar night is the key to seeing the stars for extended periods.  Therefore, the winter months are the best time to see the stars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mosame garma key mahino key doraan (During the summer months):**  During summer in the Arctic and Antarctic, you have continuous daylight (midnight sun), so you can't experience polar night.
* **B: Jabb elaqah aabadi walaa na ho (When the area is not populated):** While less light pollution is beneficial for stargazing, it's not the *primary* reason for the best viewing opportunities. The lack of sunlight is the main factor.
* **D: Jabb roshni ki aaludgi ki satah kam ho (When the level of light pollution is low):**  Similar to option B, low light pollution helps, but it's secondary to the absence of sunlight.



"
Kabb koyi satellite phone kisi cell phone kaa qabile amal badlah nahi hogaa?,"The correct answer is **A: Agar satellite ki taraf jaaney wali nazar ki line ruki ho sakti ho (If the line of sight to the satellite is obstructed)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""eek satellite phone aam toor purr eek mobile phone kaa muthbadil nahein keunkah aap cow eek phone call karnay key liye satellite key saamney waazah line key saath baahir honaa zaruri hay."" (a satellite phone is not a substitute for a mobile phone because you need a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a phone call).  Obstructions to the satellite signal prevent a connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agar mahalle waqoo bahut door ho (If the area is very remote):** While satellite phones are useful in remote areas where cell service is unavailable, the *reason* they are not a direct substitute is the line of sight requirement, not just remoteness.
* **C: Agar iska baahar mein istemaal hota hogaa (If it is used outdoors):**  Satellite phones are *designed* for outdoor use.  The problem isn't location, it's the signal blockage.
* **D: Agar kisi muhim ko makhsus data ki zaruriyaat darkaar ho (If there is a need for special data).**  Satellite phones *can* be used for data, but the line of sight is still a primary requirement for a connection.



"
Kabb kisi satellite phone ko cell phone parr tarjeeh di jaye gee?,"The correct answer is **B: Kisi kashti key safar key doraan** (During a ship journey).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah khidmat aksar shipping bashmol tafrihi kashti nez muham jowon key zariye istemaal hoti hai jinn co door kee malumat our aawaz kee zaroorat hoti hai."" (This service is often used by ships, including recreational ships, and people who need remote data and voice communication). This directly links satellite phones to situations where cell phone coverage is unavailable, such as at sea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shahar mein chutti manatey waqt** (During a vacation in the city): Cities typically have good cell phone coverage, making a satellite phone unnecessary.
* **C: Jabb door ka data zaruri na ho** (When remote data is not necessary): The passage indicates that satellite phones are used *for* remote data needs.
* **D: Jabb mumkanah tor parr aap key paas kaafi cell phone coverage ho** (When you have plenty of cell phone coverage): The passage states that satellite phones are an alternative *when* cell phone coverage is *not* available.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiss parr tanazo Transnistria jamhuriyah key bananey ka baaes bana?,"The correct answer is **C: Zubaan (Language)**.

The text states: ""maqami zubaan romaniyayi hay, leakin rosee zubaan baday paimanay purr istemaal hoti hay."" This indicates a linguistic divide, with Romanian being the official language but Russian being widely used. This linguistic difference was a major factor in the conflict that led to the creation of Transnistria.

While economic, ethnic, and religious factors might have played a role in broader tensions, the text specifically highlights the language issue as a key driver of the conflict.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Transnistria jamhuriyah mein hay jo Moldova key baaqi sey mukhtalif hay?  ,"The correct answer is **A: Zubaan (Language)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""maqami zubaan romaniyayi hay, leakin rosee zubaan baday paimanay purr istemaal hoti hay"" (The official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used).  This highlights a key difference in language compared to the rest of Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mazhab (Religion):**  The text says the biggest religion in Moldova is Christianity. While Transnistria's religious makeup might differ, it's not presented as a defining difference *making* it distinct.
* **C: UN ka tasleem karna (UN recognition):** The text states that Transnistria hasn't been recognized by any member states of the UN. This is a consequence of its status, not a defining difference *of* it.
* **D: Currency:** Transnistria has its own currency, which *is* a distinguishing feature. However, the question asks what makes it different from the *rest* of Moldova. While a separate currency is significant, language is more fundamentally a differentiating factor, especially given the historical context.

Therefore, language is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

"Agar wohh hawadaar surate haal sey bachney ki ummid kar rahey hein to Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko Montevideo ka kabb daurah karnaa chaiye?","The correct answer is **C: Shumaali Hemisphere key mosame garmaa key mahino key doraan** (During the Northern Hemisphere's summer months).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Garmiyon key maheenon mean, 30 degree senti grade say zayed darjehahrarat aam hain."" (In the summer months, temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common.)
* **The question asks:** ""Agar wohh hawadaar surate haal sey bachney ki ummid kar rahey hein to Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko Montevideo ka kabb daurah karnaa chaiye?"" (If they are expecting to avoid humid conditions, when should a traveler visit Montevideo according to the passage?)
* **The text also mentions:** ""Mausam surma hairat angez toor purr thanda hosakta hay: darjah hararat kabhi kabhaar manjamad point say neechey jaati hay, leakin hawa our namee therma meter purr nazar aaney waali thand say mausam cow kahein ziyadah surd banaa deeti hai."" (The weather can surprisingly be cold: the temperature sometimes goes below the freezing point, but the air and humidity make the cold weather not so harsh.)

Since the question asks to avoid *humid* conditions, and the passage says humidity makes the cold weather not as harsh, avoiding the colder months (Northern Hemisphere's winter) and going during the warmer months (Northern Hemisphere's summer) would be the best strategy to avoid the humidity.

Therefore, visiting during the Northern Hemisphere's summer months is the most suitable option to avoid humid conditions in Montevideo.
"
"Agar wohh ziyadah thandey mosam key liye janibdaar hein to ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi mosaafir ko Montevideo ka daurah kabb karnaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Jabb Montevideo mein mosame garmaa ho** (When it's summer in Montevideo).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Montevideo zeeli madareen mean hay; garmiyon key maheenon mean, 30 degree senti grade say zayed darjehahrarat aam hain.""  This translates to ""Montevideo is in the southern hemisphere; in the summer months, temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common.""

The question asks when a traveler should visit if they dislike cold weather. The passage explicitly says that summer in Montevideo is hot (above 30°C), making it the best time to avoid cold.  Option B is incorrect because the Northern Hemisphere's summer doesn't directly correlate to Montevideo's seasons. Options C and D are irrelevant as the passage doesn't link rainfall or Northern Hemisphere winter to ideal conditions for someone avoiding cold.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon eek mustahkam graffiti fankaar sey wabastah is tor parr wabastah hogaa kehh wohh gunda gardi key khilaaf ho?","The correct answer is **A: Graffiti taqribaat (Graffiti art)**. 

Here's why:

* The passage mentions that while unwanted graffiti might seem like vandalism, some people associate it with young people tagging public and private property.
* It then introduces the concept that some graffiti can be viewed as art. 
* The question asks which option relates to a graffiti artist who is against violence.  Someone creating *graffiti art* is more likely to be concerned with artistic expression rather than malicious intent or gang-related activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: likhawat (Writing/Tagging):** This is a general term for graffiti and doesn't imply anything about the artist's values.
* **C: Awami jayedaad parr gair matlubah deewarein (Unwanted walls on public property):**  This is a description of the undesirable aspect of graffiti, not the artist's stance.
* **D: Najayez tagz (Illegal tags):** This focuses on the illegality of the act, not the artist's moral compass.



Therefore, **Graffiti art** is the most plausible answer because it connects graffiti to a potential form of artistic expression that *could* be aligned with a desire to be against violence."
Mosiqee tehwaron key konsey zawiyah ko kuchh shorakaa tajrabah ka aham hissah samajhtey hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Site parr camp karnaa (Camping near the site)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aap action co balkal qareeb say dekhna chahte hain to aap co mausiqi key qareeb camping key maqaam purr jagah paaney keliye jaldi jaana hoga."" which translates to ""If you want to see the action very closely, you have to hurry to get a place for camping near the music.""  This highlights camping near the venue as a key part of the experience for those wanting to be close to the action.

While other options are mentioned, they are not presented as *important* aspects of the experience in the same way camping is.  The passage emphasizes the experience of being *near* the music and the potential for a more immersive experience through camping.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar eek tehwaari shareek mosiqee sey qareeb camp karnaa chahey to ussey kiss cheez ko tarjeeh deni chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Jaldi sey aana (Come early)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aap action co balkal qareeb say dekhna chahte hain to aap co mausiqi key qareeb camping key maqaam purr jagah paaney keliye **jaldi jaana hoga**."" (If you want to see the action up close, you have to **come early** to get a camping spot near the music.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Derr raat janaa (Come late):** The passage suggests the opposite; you need to arrive early.
* **B: Khandano key liye eek elaqah mein qiyaam karnaa (Camp in an area for families):** While family areas exist, the question asks about getting close to the music.
* **C: Site sey alag camp karna (Camp away from the site):**  The passage implies camping *near* the music, not away from the site.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Shumaali New Mexico mein raat ki zindagi haasil kartey waqt daurah karney walon ko kahaan sey bachna chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Chotey shahron key baar (Small town bars)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly warns that ""Chhoti bastion key baar yaa zarabgahein pardesiyon key liye aaney aur bethnay key liye hamishah achhi jaghein nahein hotein"" which translates to ""Bars or pubs in small towns are not always good places for visitors to come and sit.""
* The passage also mentions issues with drunk driving near small towns.

Therefore, the text is warning against small-town bars as potentially unsafe for visitors in Northern New Mexico at night.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pueblos:** The text mentions Pueblos as being far away and suggests you need to travel to Albuquerque or Santa Fe to truly experience the nightlife. While perhaps not ideal, the text doesn't specifically warn against Pueblos like it does with small town bars.
* **C: Maall (Goods/Merchandise):** This isn't relevant to nightlife safety.
* **D: Casino:** While casinos are mentioned, the text doesn't directly warn against them. The focus is on the potential dangers of small-town bars and driving under the influence.



"
Ebarat key hisaab sey shumaali New Mexico mein mashhoor tafreeh ko eek daurah karney keliye panaa kitnaa mumkin hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Albuquerque sey do ghantey ki doori parr eek casino mein**.

Here's why:

The passage states that to experience the Shabanah lifestyle, you might need to travel *beyond* Albuquerque and Santa Fe. It then mentions that most casinos offer alcohol, often featuring well-known brands.  Option A directly aligns with this, suggesting a casino within a two-hour drive of Albuquerque.

The other options are less suitable:

* **B: Eek door key pueblo mein:** While pueblos might be part of the Shabanah experience, the passage implies that a casino is a key element, and pueblos themselves aren't specifically mentioned as casino locations.
* **C: Sante Fe key paas eek casino mein:** The passage suggests traveling *beyond* Santa Fe, so a casino *near* Santa Fe wouldn't fulfill the condition of having to travel a significant distance.
* **D: Eek chotey shahar key baar mein:**  The passage warns against small-town bars being safe places to stop and rest, especially after consuming alcohol. It presents casinos as a more viable option for experiencing the Shabanah lifestyle.



"
Bajat sey bedaar mosaafiron ko kiss qism key mashroob sey bachney ki chahat ho sakti hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Australia ki sharaab**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tahim New Zealand aur Australia kee sharabein behatar safar kirr sakti hain.""  This implies that Australian beer is a well-known or perhaps even ""strong"" option. The question asks what a budget-conscious traveler might want to *avoid*.  Stronger alcoholic beverages are often more expensive, making Australian beer a likely candidate for something a budget traveler would want to steer clear of.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Kashti walaa paani (Bottled water):** The text says local tap water is safe to drink, and bottled water is easily available if you're worried. This isn't something a budget traveler would necessarily want to avoid.
* **C: Maqami beer (Local beer):**  The text mentions local beer (""Khaas maqami bear kaa naam 'number one' hay...""). This is presented as a good, refreshing option, not something to avoid.
* **D: Fal ka juice (Fruit juice):** The text says fruit juice is expensive. Therefore, a budget traveler might want to avoid it, but not necessarily *more* than Australian beer.
"
"Ebarat mein wazah elaqah ki buniyaad parr, darjah zail konsey mashroob key order ko eek server key zariyah mashkuk honey ka imkaan hay?","The answer is **A: Eek mukhtasar siyaah (Eek short black / Espresso)**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""short black 'spresso' hay..."" This means a ""short black"" is a standard and well-understood coffee order.  There's no ambiguity about what it is.
* **The text states:** ""Khaas maqami bear kaa naam 'number one' hay..."" This implies that ""number one"" is a specific type of beer.  While it's described as pleasant, it's still a specific beer and could potentially be misheard or misunderstood.
* **The text mentions:** ""Pinay key liye bhat see francisi sharabein mojud hain...""  This indicates a variety of French wines.  Choosing one, even a Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand, is generally straightforward.
* **The text says:** ""...chaye baghair doodh key pesh kee jaati hay..."" This means tea is served without milk, so a ""flat white"" (which would have milk) is not the correct option.

Therefore, the ""short black"" (espresso) is the most likely to be misunderstood and ordered incorrectly by a server, making it the option with the highest probability of a mistake.



"
"Teeno mulkon key liye barqaraar rahtey huey, samraaji zamanah kiss jamaat ney shuru kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **C: Guaraní**.

The text states: ""16vein sadee eiswi pragway jasay pehle """"dye giant prons aaf dye indies"""" kahaa jaataa thaa, kaa janam maqami desi jamaaton key saath spiny fateheen key saath hoyee ladayi key natijah mean wajood mean aaya thaa. Spiniyon nay mustaariyat ahed kaa aaghaz kiya ju then sadee thak barqarar rehaa. 1537aa mean issonciyoon kee bunyaad key baad piragaye apna desi kirdaar aur shanakht barqarar rakhnay mein kamiyab rehaa."" This translates to ""In the 16th century AD, what was first called ""the giant sons of the Indies"" came into being as a result of battles between local native communities and the Spanyards. The Spanyards began a dynasty which lasted for centuries. After the foundation in 1537, Paraguay was able to maintain its own native character and identity.""  The Guaraní people are the native community mentioned who were involved in the conflict with the Spanyards, and the Spanish established a dynasty *after* the foundation in 1537.

Therefore, the Guaraní established the dynasty (or at least a significant period of Spanish rule) in Paraguay.
"
"Ebarart key hisaab sey, paris key kisi bashindey ko aap key liye warm up kareny kaa behtareen tariqah kiya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Mohazzab amal karnaa (Acting politely/with good manners)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes acting like a ""peer"" (a respected figure) who is well-regarded.**  It states that showing good manners is the best way to gain favor.  ""Mohazzab amal karnaa"" directly translates to acting with politeness and good manners, aligning perfectly with the passage's advice.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Paris key bashindey key rawayyah ki taqleed karney ki koshish (Trying to imitate the behavior of Parisians):**  The passage cautions against a ""wrong prejudiced view"" and implies that blindly imitating someone isn't the best approach.  It's about demonstrating good character, not just copying behavior.
* **B: Etemaad nikalnaa (Expressing trust):**  While important in building relationships, the passage focuses on establishing a favorable impression of oneself first. Trust is a result of good behavior, not the initial step.
* **D: Kharijee soluk ki nomaesh karnaa (Displaying foreign behavior):**  The passage isn't about being ""foreign."" It's about demonstrating good character and respect, regardless of where you come from.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko Paris key logon ki daqyanoosi sifat samjhaa jaata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Ghamand (Pride/Arrogance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Parisians are known for their ""gharz"" (pride, arrogance) and being ""maghrur"" (arrogant). The passage explicitly connects this to their reputation, implying that this pride is a key characteristic being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Badtamizee (Rudeness):** While rudeness can sometimes be associated with arrogance, the passage doesn't directly mention rudeness as a primary characteristic of Parisians.
* **C: Khelwaad (Playfulness/Mischief):** This is completely unrelated to the described characteristic.
* **D: Khalal andazi (Troublemaking/Disruption):** This is also not mentioned in the passage as a characteristic of Parisians.



"
Cape Town ki MetroRail parr pahley darjah ka fayedah kiya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Coach train key samney hay (Coaches are at the front of the train)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""metro pulse coaches hamishah keep town key qareeb tareen train key aakhir mein hotay hain."" which translates to ""metro pulse coaches are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.""

This implies the *opposite* is true for the first class (Metro Pulse) - they are at the front.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bahut sey log nahein hein (Not many people)** - The text doesn't mention how crowded the first class is.
* **C: Yehh teesrey darjah sey kam manhgaa hay (It's cheaper than the third class)** - The text mentions Metro Pulse is cheaper than a typical European metro ticket, but doesn't say it's cheaper than the third class.
* **D: Iskaa Metro ticket key jitnaa hi kerayaa hay (Its fare is the same as the metro ticket)** - The text says Metro Pulse is *more* expensive than the regular Metro.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Cape Town ki harr mosaafir train mein kiya hotaa hay?","The correct answer is **D: Pahley aur teesrey dono darjey key coach**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Harr eek rail gaadi mein metro pulse aur metro donon hee dabay hotay hain..."" which translates to ""In every rail car, both Metro Pulse and Metro are placed...""
* It also clarifies: ""metro pulse coaches hamishah keep town key qareeb tareen train key aakhir mein hotay hain."" which means ""Metro Pulse coaches are always at the end of the train closest to Cape Town.""
* While the passage mentions the Metro Pulse being more comfortable and expensive, and the Metro being cheaper, it doesn't imply only one of the classes is present. It explicitly states *both* are present in every train.

Therefore, the correct answer is that every passenger train in Cape Town has coaches for both the first and third class (Metro Pulse and Metro).
"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko eek janwar ka keeda keliye karnaa mumkin nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Taqatwar zakhamon ki wajah banana (Causing strong wounds)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while animals can carry parasites that cause problems like food spoilage, burns, and even transmit diseases, they generally *don't* cause strong wounds. Options A, B, and C are all listed as potential consequences of parasites:

*   **A: Didora ki wajah banana (Causing itching):**  Parasites can cause skin irritation and itching.
*   **B: Jalan wali allergy (Burning allergy):**  Some parasites can cause allergic reactions that feel like burning.
*   **C: Infection failanaa (Spreading infection):**  This is a key risk associated with parasites.

**D: Taqatwar zakhamon ki wajah banana (Causing strong wounds)** is the exception, as the passage explicitly states that animals don't usually cause significant wounds.

Therefore, the answer is **D**."
Pesh adaegi phone key card ko kahaan kharidaa ja saktaa hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Mod ki dukaano mein** (Small shops).

The text states: ""Rehaishi elaqon kee harr chhoti dukaan mean paishgi adayegi kardah phone cards kee preshan kunn safon kee bharmaar hay..."" which translates to ""Prepaid phone cards are available in almost every small shop in residential areas...""  ""Mod ki dukaan"" means small shop or local store.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Makhsus mamalik mein (In special countries):** The text doesn't specify that prepaid cards are only available in special countries.
* **B: Train stationo parr (At train stations):** The text doesn't mention train stations.
* **D: Phone ki adaegi karney mein (At phone payment places):**  While you might find them there, the text explicitly states they are available in *small shops* as well.
"
Kuchh rasaayi yaaftah cardon ney behtar call ki qimaton ki peshkash kaisey ki hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Toll free number key zariyah**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Inn khidmaat thak rasayi aksar toll free telefon number key zariah hoti hay Jis purr beshtar baghair balance charge key phone say call kee jasakti hay.""  This translates to ""Access to these services is often through toll-free phone numbers, which allow calls to be made from phones without a balance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unn tak sirf makhsus mamalik mein rasaayi haasil ki jaa sakti hay** (Access is only available in certain countries): While some cards *may* be restricted to certain countries, the passage doesn't say this is the primary way they offer better call rates.
* **C: Mod key store parr** (At a recharge store): The passage doesn't mention recharge stores as a factor in offering better call rates.
* **D: Adaegi ka phone aur eek ezaafi phone ka charge istemaal kareky** (Using a paid phone and an additional phone charge): This is completely unrelated to the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsa darakht Plitvice jheelon key qomi park mein kam aam hay?","The correct answer is **D: Spruce**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Latwais National Park is primarily characterized by **white, spruce, and cedar trees**. 
* The question asks which tree is *uncommon* in Plitvice Lakes National Park.
* While the passage doesn't mention Plitvice Lakes, we can infer that spruce is less common in a park described as having a diverse range of tree species compared to the specific focus on spruce in Latwais. 
* The other options (beach oak, oak, fir) are all types of trees that *could* potentially be found in Plitvice Lakes National Park, especially considering the diverse environment mentioned.

Therefore, based on the information provided and logical deduction, spruce is the least likely to be common in Plitvice Lakes National Park compared to the other options.
"
Darjah shaaz janwaron mein sey kon Plitvice jheelon key qomi park mein paya jaa sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

* The provided text describes Latwais National Park in Ghana and lists the Capercaillie (jungli billy) as one of the animals found there.
* The question asks about animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.
* **Capercaillie** are found in both Ghana (according to the text) and Croatia (where Plitvice Lakes National Park is located).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Turkey** - Turkey is a country, not a specific animal found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.
* **B: Honey Badger** - The text mentions honey badgers in Latwais National Park, but not in Plitvice Lakes National Park.
* **C: Cassowary** - Cassowaries are native to Australia and New Guinea and are not found in Croatia.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Elaaqayi code asal mein kiskey saath taawun kartey hein?","The correct answer is **B: Bazaar ka control (Control of the Bazaar)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Waaqee maqsad inn companion co bazaar purr ziyadah control deena hay."" which translates to ""The real purpose of these companion companies is to gain more control over the bazaar.""

While the text mentions ""gair qanuni naqal karnaa"" (illegal copying) and ""disk naqal karnaa"" (disk copying), these are presented as *means* to achieve the ultimate goal of bazaar control.  The local code's impact is described as negligible, and the focus is on the power dynamic within the market.

Therefore, the primary goal of the local code, according to the text, is to exert control over the bazaar.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon Khittah key code key baarey mein eek jhoot hay, jo media companiyon ney barqaraar rakha hay?","The correct answer is **B: Wohh gair qanooni naqal sey bachney mein madad kartey hein** (They help prevent illegal copying).

Here's why:

* The statement explicitly says, ""Darr haqeeqat, gher qanuni kaapi karnay purr elaqayi code kaa qatyi koyee asra nahein hota hay."" (In reality, the local code has no effect on illegal copying).  This directly contradicts the claim that media companies prevent illegal copying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mazeed bazar control haasil karney key liye wohh zaruri hein** (They are necessary to gain more market control): This aligns with the statement: ""Waaqee maqsad inn companion co bazaar purr ziyadah control deena hay."" (The real purpose of these companies is to gain more control in the bazaar).  This is a true assertion according to the passage.
* **C: Paisa katayi waley key liye wohh mofeed hay** (They are useful for those who cut costs):  The passage doesn't mention anything about cost-cutting. This is an unsupported claim.
* **D: Qazzaki sey bachney mein wohh shaazo nadir madad kartey hein** (They rarely help avoid piracy): While the passage states the local code has no effect on piracy, it *doesn't* claim they help avoid it. This is a misrepresentation of the information.



Therefore, option B is the only statement that directly contradicts the information presented in the passage.
"
"Apney watan mein pahunchney key waqt, konsa marhalah aam tor parr gair rasmi hota hay?","The correct answer is **B: Ashyaa ka elaan karnaa (Declaring goods)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Jib aap apnay watan pahunchtay hain to immigration chek aam tor purr nahein hota yaa mamuli hota hay, leakin custom control mean aap co tang kiya jaa sakta hay..."" This translates to: ""When you reach your homeland, immigration checks are usually not done or are minor, but you can be questioned at customs...""

The text emphasizes being aware of what is legal and illegal and being able to declare items within legal limits.  This directly relates to **declaring goods (ashyaa ka elaan karnaa)** at customs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Muntaqilee padtaalein (Transfer investigations):**  This is not directly mentioned in the text.
* **C: Ashaya ki qanooni hodud (Legal limits of goods):** While important, it's a consequence of the declaration, not the general process.
* **D: Custom control (Custom control):** The text says you *can be questioned* at customs, but it doesn't state that the initial arrival is generally informal.



"
Darjah zail mein kisko apney watan mein pahunchney sey pahley aap ko janana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Agar aap ko qanooni hodud parr ashyaa ka elaan karney ki zarurat ho (If you need to declare goods at the legal border).**

Here's why:

The initial statement highlights the importance of understanding customs regulations.  Option B directly relates to that.  You need to know what you're allowed to bring into the country and how to declare items that require it.  This is crucial to avoid problems at customs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Agar wahan muntaqili checkpoint hoga (If there is a transit checkpoint):** Transit checkpoints can have varying procedures, but declaration of goods is a more general concern for entering a country.
* **C: Agar custom control hogaa (If there is customs control):**  Customs control is where you're likely to be questioned about goods, but it's *because* you need to declare things, not the reason to know *beforehand*.  It's the *action* of customs control that requires knowledge of the rules.
* **D: Agar kisi ashyaa ko aap laa rahey hon to uski ejaazat na ho (If you are bringing goods and don't have permission for them):**  Lack of permission is a *consequence* of not knowing the rules, not the reason for knowing them beforehand.  

Therefore, understanding when you need to declare goods at the border is the most important thing to know based on the provided context.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss cheez ki kasrat chadhney waley ko mustaqil tor parr Cochamó waadi key andar naye raaston ko daryaaft karney ki ijaazat deti hay?","The correct answer is **D: Deewarein** (Walls).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...duniya key tamaam elaqon key koah paima muslisil iss kee dewaron key lamtanahi silsilon ke darmiyan nayey raastay bananay key liye koshaan hain.""  This translates to: ""...mountain climbers from all over the world are constantly trying to create new paths between the endless chains of its walls.""

Therefore, the ""walls"" are the feature that allow for the creation of new routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manazir (Views/Scenery):** While the views are stunning, they don't directly enable the creation of routes.
*   **B: Sarbarahi ijlaas (Authority/Governance):** This has no relevance to the physical geography of the valley.
*   **C: Chotiyaan (Peaks/Small Mountains):** While peaks are present, the passage emphasizes the ""walls"" (larger rock formations) as the key element for climbing routes.



"
"Ebarat mein dee gayi malumaat ki buniyaad parr, Jonubi Hemisphere mein ziyaadah tarr crossing kaa kon ehaatah karta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Star Alliance tamaam elaqon kaa ahatah karta hay maaswaae Santiago dee chalee say tahiti thak mashriqi janubi behralkahil key, ju kahh latam oneworld flight hay.""

This translates to: ""Star Alliance covers all regions except from Santiago to Tahiti towards the eastern South Pacific, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight.""

This clearly indicates that Star Alliance covers the most routes in the Southern Hemisphere.
"
Konsey airline ka ettehaad Jonubi Hemisphere mein samundar crossing ki kam az kam miqdaar ka ehaatah karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The passage states: ""Star Alliance tamaam elaqon kaa ahatah karta hay maaswaae Santiago dee chalee say tahiti thak mashriqi janubi behralkahil key, ju kahh latam oneworld flight hay."" This translates to ""Star Alliance covers all regions except from Santiago to Tahiti through eastern South Pacific, which is a LATAM Oneworld flight."" This implies Star Alliance has the broadest coverage in the Southern Hemisphere among the options listed.
"
Konsi daurah ki tanzeem alami dauraey karaney wali ki janasheeni ki?,"The correct answer is **D: Barcelona ka daurah karanaa (Barcelona running tours)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Global running tours kaa jansheen, go running tours key paas chaar baraazmon mean darjanon saait running providers kaa neat work hay. Barsalona say sharoo hokar barsalona key running tours barsalona our kopan haggen key running tours kopan haggen key saath, asay pragway our deegar jighon mean waaqa pragway tours key saath teezi say shaamil kiya gayaa thaa.""

This translates to: ""Global running tours has a neat network of running providers in four continents. Starting from Barcelona, Barcelona running tours, Barcelona and Copenhagen running tours, and Prague tours located in Prague and other places were quickly included.""

Therefore, Barcelona running tours are the ones being discussed as the original and central part of the Global Running Tours organization.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, daurah karatey rahnaa kitni mukhtalif nazarah waali tanzeemon sey rabetah karney mein madad karti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Chaar**.

The text states: ""Global running tours kaa jansheen, go running tours key paas chaar baraazmon mean darjanon saait running providers kaa neat work hay."" This translates to ""Go running tours has a neat network of running providers in four regions.""

Therefore, the answer is that they have connections with **four** different regions. ""Darjano"" means dozens, which is too general. ""200"" is incorrect as it refers to the total number of tours, not the number of organizations.  ""Teen"" (three) is also incorrect."
Sabsey ziyadah saaf shaffaaf mumkanah cheetah key nazarah ki agar koyi sayyah ummid kar raha hay to usey kiya karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Doorbeen istemaal karein (Use a binoculars)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Sher, cheetay aur taindwe aam toor purr sharmile hotay hain aur aap unn co durbeen say ziyadah behatar deekh sakein gay."" (Lions, cheetahs and leopards are usually shy and you can see them much better with binoculars.)

Option C directly addresses this point.  The other options are less relevant:

* **A: Safari key eek paidal safar parr jayen (Go on a foot safari):** While walking safaris can be part of a safari, it doesn't guarantee a better view of shy animals like cheetahs.
* **B: Eek jhaadi ki chahal qadmi parr jayen (Walk a herd's length away):**  This isn't mentioned in the text and wouldn't necessarily improve visibility.
* **D: Eek car lein aur meyaari saazo saamaan istemaal karein (Take a car and use quality equipment):** The text focuses on observing animals from a distance, implying binoculars are sufficient, not necessarily a car.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kis qism key janwar ka mumkanah tor parr eek daurah karney waley ko kisi gaadi mein safari ki muhim key doraan samnaa karna padey gaa?","The correct answer is **B: Jiraaf**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kachh janwar, jaise haathi our jiraaf, kaaron key qareeb aajate hain aur mayari saamaan key zariah achhi tarah say dekhay jayein gay.""  This translates to: ""Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, come close to cars and can be well observed with the help of binoculars.""  Therefore, giraffes are mentioned as a type of animal likely to be seen during a safari in a vehicle.

While lions, cheetahs, and leopards are mentioned, the passage specifically links elephants and giraffes to being seen from vehicles (cars).
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kisi safar ki kam tar qimat kiya hogee?","सही जवाब है **A: खुद से जाना**

यहां स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

*   प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि अकेले यात्रा करना सबसे किफायती होता है।
*   अन्य विकल्प दूसरों के साथ यात्रा करने से संबंधित हैं, जो अधिक महंगे होंगे।

इसलिए, सबसे कम खर्चीला विकल्प अकेले यात्रा करना है।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Mumkanah tor parr behtareen safar key daurah ko kaun mahfooz karegaa?","The answer is **D: Paanch logon ki eek jamaat (A group of five people)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Taham, yeah yaqeenan aap kee fikr nahein honey chahiye keunkah aksar seyahon cow sarf gaadiyan bharnay key liye udhar say udhar kiya jaataa hay. Darasil yeah eek chaal lagti hay jis key zariah wah logon cow iss purr raazi kartay hain kahh inn cow ziyadah adayegi karnaa chahiye."" 

This translates to: ""However, you certainly shouldn't worry because often travelers are just being transported from place to place. In reality, this is a tactic whereby those in charge are pleased if those travelers pay more.""

The passage recommends forming a group of four to six people to make the journey ""kafayati"" (economical).  Of the options provided, a group of five (D) is closest to that recommended range.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Caron ko shuffle karney ki chaahat rakhney waley sayyaah (Travelers who like to shuffle cars):** This is irrelevant to the cost of the journey.
* **B: Teen logon ki eek jamaat (A group of three people):** This is below the recommended range of four to six.
* **C: Eek saath safar karney waley do dost (Two friends traveling together):** This is below the recommended range of four to six.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, San Francisco ki aalami shanakht mein kiss cheez ney taawun kiya thaa?","The correct answer is **A: Fan aur media ki mukhtalif shaklon mein aksar mojudgi (Frequent presence in various forms of fan and media)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iss kee mausiqi, film, adab our awami culture mean matwatar tasveer kashee say yeah shehar our iss key mualim saree duniya mean maruf how gaye"" which translates to ""Its music, film, literature and popular culture have been frequently depicted, making this city and its inhabitants famous all over the world.""

This directly points to the city's presence in various forms of media (film, music, literature, etc.) as the reason for its global recognition.  The other options are mentioned, but not as the primary reason for global renown in the passage.
"
Ebarat key hisaab sey San Francisco key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Eqtesaad ka puri tarah seyahat parr bharosah bharosa hay (The economy is entirely reliant on tourism).**

Here's why:

The text states that San Francisco's economy is driven by several sectors, including finance, business, and *tourism*, but it doesn't say it *entirely* relies on it. The text clearly mentions a diverse economic base. Options A, B, and C are all supported by the information in the text.  The city's prominence in film/literature, the availability of Asian cuisine, and the presence of hotels and convention centers all point to a significant tourism industry. However, the economy is not *entirely* based on tourism.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism key mosaafir ko safar key agent ki khidmaat ka istemaal karney sey fayedah honaa mumkin nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Eek mosaafir jo booking safah key saudon ko tarjeeh detaa hay (A traveler who prefers deals on booking pages).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the benefits of using a travel agent for specialized deals, packages, and assistance with logistics.** It highlights their ability to secure deals not readily available to the general public.
* **Option D directly contradicts this.** If a traveler *prefers* booking deals themselves, they are likely already actively seeking out and securing those deals. They wouldn't need the assistance of a travel agent to do so.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eek gair faisalah kun mosaafir (An indecisive traveler):** A travel agent can help an indecisive traveler by offering guidance and narrowing down options.
* **B: Besaakhtagi ka shikaar eek mosaafir (A traveler who is a victim of fraud):** A reputable travel agent can help protect travelers from fraud by ensuring legitimate bookings and providing support if issues arise.
* **C: Eek mosaafir jisney abhi apna visa mahfooz nahein kiya hay (A traveler who has not yet secured their visa):** Travel agents often assist with visa applications and can help ensure that visa requirements are met.



Therefore, the traveler who wouldn't benefit from a travel agent is the one who independently seeks and prefers deals found on booking pages, indicating they are already self-sufficient in finding travel arrangements.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kisko ebarat mein safari agent key zariyah booking key fayedah key tor par zikr naein kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Tezz safar key dastavezaat (Fast travel documents)**.

Here's why:

The text highlights benefits like:

*   **Zahni sokoon (Peace of mind):** Knowing accommodation is arranged.
*   **Special hotel deals/offers.**
*   **Booking various accommodations (camping grounds, etc.).**
*   **Packages including meals, airport transfers, etc.**
*   **Assistance with visa applications.**
*   **Managing modifications and requests.**
*   **Making reservations.**

While a travel agent *can* assist with travel documents (like visas), the text doesn't specifically emphasize *speedy* travel documents as a primary benefit. The focus is more on the overall convenience and comprehensive planning offered. The other options (hotel deals, packages, and making a reservation) are all directly mentioned as advantages.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Haqiqi waqt key matan key motarjim ki darkhawastein kiss cheez key qaabil nahein hein?","The correct answer is **D: Waqt ka 100% durust tor parr tarjumaa karnaa (Translating time 100% correctly)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while real-time translation apps have improved dramatically, they can *still* make mistakes. This implies that perfect accuracy is not guaranteed, and therefore translating *time* (which is complex and requires contextual understanding beyond just words) 100% accurately is unlikely for these apps.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible:

* **A: Bairuni zubaano mein alamaat ka tarjumah karnaa (Translating signs in foreign languages):** The passage explicitly mentions that these apps can translate text on real-world objects and signs by pointing a smartphone at them.
* **B: Matan key mokammal tabqaat ka tarjumaa karnaa (Translating complete blocks of text):** The passage mentions that these apps can translate entire blocks of text.
* **C: Smartphone key zariyah smaano parr matan ka tarjumaa karnaa (Translating text on objects using a smartphone):** The passage specifically mentions this functionality.



Therefore, the only request that is unlikely to be fulfilled perfectly by real-time translation apps is translating time with 100% accuracy.



"
Offline tarjumey karney ki kiss cheez sey ijazat milti hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Zubaan key data ko download karnaa (Downloading language data)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""jo matlubah zubaan kaa deta down load karnay key baad iskaa off line tarjumah kirr deta hay"" (which allows for offline translation after downloading the required language data).  This means having the language data stored on the phone is the key to offline translation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Behtar kardah arjumaa key engin (Improved translation engine):** While an improved engine helps with translation quality, it doesn't enable *offline* translation.
* **B: Smartphone:** A smartphone is the device, but it's the language data that makes offline translation possible.
* **D: Haqiqi waqt key tarjumaa key zumrey mein darkhawastein (Requests within the real-time translation category):** This is too general and doesn't address the specific requirement for offline translation.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon barfaani todey kaa moharrik nahi hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Chaspaan baraf (Sticky snow)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the following are causes of snowfall:

* **Dhoop (Sun):** ""...asl moharrik waaqiah barf co garma denay waala sooraj hota hay..."" (The main driving force is the sun warming the snow...)
* **Ezaafi baraf baari (Extra snowfall):** ""...kabhi kabhi kachh ziyadah barf baari hoti hay..."" (Sometimes there is extra snowfall...)
* **Qudrati mazahir (Natural phenomena):** ""...kabhi dosray qudarati mazahir..."" (Sometimes other natural phenomena...)
* **Insaan (Human):** ""...to aksar koyee insaan."" (And often a human.)

""Chaspaan baraf"" (Sticky snow) is mentioned as a *result* of the snowfall (it's difficult to push because it's sticky), not a cause of it. Therefore, it's the only option that isn't listed as a cause of snowfall in the text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon barfaani todey ki tarah neechey aata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Chaspaan baraf jo tahrik shudah nahein hay (Sticky snow that is not moved).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mushkil yeah hay kahh barf chapki hoyee hay, iss liye iss co neechey giranay key liye kachh jhatka laganay kee zaroorat hay...""  This translates to: ""The difficulty is that the snow is sticky, therefore it needs some jolt to make it fall.""

Therefore, the sticky, unmoved snow (chaspaan baraf jo tahrik shudah nahein hay) is the type of snow that is difficult to make fall and needs a jolt to start falling. The other options don't directly relate to the reason why snow falls slowly or needs a jolt to initiate.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Begair baraf key khadi dhalwaanein (Uncovered snow-covered slopes):** While slopes contribute to snow sliding, the passage focuses on the *stickiness* of the snow itself.
* **C: Khadi dhalwaano parr ziyadah baraf ka hajam (Large amount of snow accumulating on slopes):**  This describes a situation where a lot of snow is on slopes, but doesn't explain why the snow falls slowly initially.
* **D: Insaano ney baraf ko achoot chod diya (Humans have abandoned the snow):**  This is unrelated to the physical properties of the snow and why it falls.

"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, saalan kon sey ajzaa key ird gird mabni hay?","The correct answer is **D: Sabziyaan aur doodh (Vegetables and Milk)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that curry masala can be made with either meat (gosht) or vegetables (sabzi). It also mentions that the base of the dish can be either ""dry"" or ""gravy-like,"" implying a liquid element. The passage then goes on to mention yogurt (dahi) in the northern regions and coconut milk (nariyal kaa dhoodh) in the southern regions.  

Therefore, the core ingredients around which the dish is built are vegetables and a dairy component (either yogurt or coconut milk/milk). Option D best reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dahi aur paani (Yogurt and water):** While yogurt (dahi) is mentioned, water (paani) is not the primary base ingredient.
*   **B: Jadee booti aur masala (Spices and herbs):** While essential, spices and herbs are not the *foundation* of the dish.
*   **C: Nariyal ka dhoodh aur gosht (Coconut milk and meat):** This option is incomplete because it doesn't account for the option of using vegetables instead of meat. Also, it does not mention the dairy element's wide usage.



"
"Makhsus khitton mein, nariyal ka doodh baaz auqaat eek mulk mein kiss juzw ki jagah istemaal hotaa hay?","The correct answer is **B: Sabziyaan**.

The text states: ""Shumali hind aur pakistan key androni elaqon mean dahi co omuman kadhi mean istemaal kiya jaataa hay; jonubi hind our barsaghir key deegar saheli elaqon mean omuman narial kaa doodh istemaal kiya jaataa hay."" This translates to: ""In the inland regions of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is generally used in kadhi; in the southern parts of India and other allied regions, coconut milk is generally used.""

Since the question asks where coconut milk is *typically* used instead of yogurt (dahi), and the text says it's used in the southern parts of India and other allied regions, it's implied that coconut milk is commonly paired with **sabziyaan (vegetables)** in those regions.
"
Transantarctic pahaadon key gardo nawah mein eek ghumao kiya hota hay jisey plateau key andar janey ki dar kaar hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **B: compact baraf khatarnaak hota hay (compact ice is dangerous)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the journey to Qutub Co is along a 1600km road marked with flags in the snow.  It also mentions that only specialized tractors can travel this road, and they are slow.  The passage implies a hazardous condition, and the phrase ""trial co plato purr aaney key liye trans interact mountain key ird gird taweel chakkar lagana padta hay"" (to get to the plateau, long loops around the Transantarctic mountains have to be made) suggests challenging terrain.

Therefore, the most logical reason for the difficulty and danger is the presence of **compact ice** which makes the terrain hazardous and requires specialized equipment and slow travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: McMurdo Station aksar band rahta hay (McMurdo Station is often closed):** The passage doesn't mention the closure of McMurdo Station.
* **C: Makhsus tractor furteeley hotey hein (Special tractors are fast):** The passage explicitly states that the tractors are *not* fast.
* **D: Ross Sea key zariyah safar karney sey yehh ziyaadah aasan hay (Traveling via the Ross Sea makes this easier):** The passage focuses on the road route and doesn't offer an alternative via the Ross Sea.

"
"Jonubi Pole Traverse key kinaarey, kiss cheez ko jhandon sey nishaan zadd kiya jataa hay?","The correct answer is **D: Pahaadon key gardo nawah mein khatarnaak moad (Dangerous bends in the mountains)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that flags are placed along the 1600km route from McMurdo Station to Qutub Co to mark dangerous bends in the mountains. This is done because only specialized tractors can traverse the icy road, and they are slow and require long detours.  The flags serve as visual guides to navigate these hazardous areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: McMurdo Station ki pagdandi (McMurdo Station's route):** While the route starts at McMurdo Station, the flags aren't marking the *route itself*, but specific dangerous locations along it.
*   **B: Tel ley jaaney waley tractor (Fuel-carrying tractors):** Tractors are *using* the route, not being marked by the flags.
*   **C: Baraf sey pack shagaafein (Snow drifts):** While snow drifts are a hazard, the passage explicitly mentions marking ""dangerous bends in the mountains"" with flags.



"
Ebarat mein kiya iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh kiss cheez sey Jonubi Africa ki daryaaft kartey waqt sayyahon ko aagah rahnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Mukhtalif mamalik mein Visas ke liye motanawwah zaruriyaat hoti hein (Different countries have varying visa requirements)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Veza key taqazay our ikhrajat qaum darr qaum mukhtalif hain aur aap key rehaishi mulk key lehaaz say asrandaz ho saktay hain. Harr mulk key kuchh munfarid qawanin bhee hotay hain ju taqazah kartay hain kahh gaadi mean konsi hungami cheezein rakhnay kee zaroorat hay."" (Visa requirements and expenses vary from country to country and may be affected by your residential country. Each country also has unique laws requiring what emergency items should be kept in the car.)

Option A directly reflects this point about differing visa requirements. The other options are either inaccurate or not supported by the text.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, car sey jonubi Africa ko daryaaft karney ko dekh rahey sayyahon key liye kisko bura mashwarah samjha jaata hay?","The correct answer is **D: Jonubi Africa key pados waley tamaam mamalik daurah karney key liye namoonah nahein hein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes instability in neighboring countries.** It explicitly states, ""Veza key taqazay our ikhrajat qaum darr qaum mukhtalif hain aur aap key rehaishi mulk key lehaaz say asrandaz ho saktay hain. Harr mulk key kuchh munfarid qawanin bhee hotay hain ju taqazah kartay hain kahh gaadi mean konsi hungami cheezein rakhnay kee zaroorat hay."" This means venturing beyond South Africa into neighboring countries is a risky proposition due to varying conditions and laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Drune car makhsus fauri ashyaa ho sakta hay qanoon ko matlub ho:** While it's good to have emergency supplies and be aware of legal requirements, the passage doesn't specifically call this *bad* advice, just a consideration.
* **B: Agarcheh 4x4 ki sifarish ki jaati ho, ziyadah tar mahallaate waqoo eek aam gaadi key saath qaabile rasaayi hay:** The passage states that *while* a 4x4 is recommended, many areas are accessible with a regular car. This isn't bad advice.
* **C: Aam raston sey inheraaf karney ko dekh rahey logo key liye car sey safar karnaa badi baat hay:** The passage focuses on the challenges of *crossing borders* into neighboring countries, not just deviating from main roads within South Africa.
"
Darjah zail mein sey kon ebarat mein iss tor parr mazkoor nahein hay kehh aapkey bagon ko chodney ka mumkanah khatrah ko nazar andaaz kar diya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Wohh kisi aur sey shak mein padd saktey hein (They might be suspected by someone else)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the dangers of having your bags tampered with, especially across borders. It specifically mentions:

*   Drug careers being falsely assigned due to lack of knowledge.
*   Waiting lines and the potential for opportunistic criminals (""kisme ettelaa key soonghne waale kutton kaa kisee bhee waqit istemaal kiya jasakta hay"").
*   Severe punishments for first-time offenders, including jail or death.
*   Bags being targeted for theft.
*   The threat of bombs.

Option C, ""Wohh kisi aur sey shak mein padd saktey hein,"" is a general possibility but not a direct consequence or danger *specifically* outlined in the passage about bag tampering and security threats. The other options (A, B, and D) directly relate to the potential outcomes described in the passage.
"
Manshiyaat ley jaaney key talluq sey ebarat mein kiyaa mazkoor nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Zimmah daar aapkey bagon ko zabt kar saktey hein agarcheh aap manshiyaat na ley jaa rahey hon.**

Here's why:

* **The text focuses on the risks associated with carrying drugs.** It specifically mentions the dangers of being caught with drugs, the potential punishments (including jail and death), and the use of drug-sniffing dogs.
* **Option D is irrelevant.** The passage doesn't mention anything about authorities seizing gardens, regardless of whether someone is carrying drugs.  This is a completely unrelated point.
* **Options A, B, and C are all mentioned in the text:**
    * **A:**  ""Kuchh mamalik mean pehli baar jurm sarzad karnay waalon keliye bhee nehayat zalimana saza mojud hay- inn mean 10 salon thak jail yaa maut kee saza shaamil hay-"" (Some countries have extremely harsh punishments for first-time offenders, including 10 years in jail or the death penalty.)
    * **B:** ""Aalami safar kartey waqt ezaafi ehteyaat karnaa chahiye"" (Extra caution should be taken while traveling internationally.)
    * **C:** ""Notice key begair manshiyaat soonghney waley kutton ka istemaal kiya jaa sakta hay"" (Drug-sniffing dogs can be used without notice.)



"
Kiss qism key mashroob ko iss tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay kehh qiyaam key doraan ghar parr koyi cheez bananey ki koshish karna hay?,"The answer is **C: Beer**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on relaxing and unwinding at home. It suggests tea, and mentions that a simple drink can be made for oneself. Beer is typically associated with going out (bars/pubs) and doesn't fit the theme of a quiet, relaxing home environment described in the passage.  Juice and coffee are both beverages that *could* be made at home, so they are not explicitly excluded by the passage's focus on at-home relaxation.  Tea is explicitly mentioned. Therefore, beer is the most likely answer.
"
Aap qeyaam key doraan darjah zail mein sey kiska daurah karnaa chahtey hein agar aapka shahar piney ki saqafat keliye mashhoor ho?,"The correct answer is **C: Sharaab khaaney jahaan aap aam tor parr ziyadha nahein jatey hein**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what you'd visit if your city is known for its drinking culture. 
* Option C directly addresses this by suggesting going to bars or pubs you don't frequent often. This aligns with the prompt's suggestion to explore local establishments known for their drinking scene.

The other options are less relevant:

* **A: Aap key pados key baahar kafee ki dukaanein:** This is too general.
* **B: Juice yaa halkey samaano ki dukaanein:** This is unrelated to drinking culture.
* **D: Chamomile chaye bananey waley resturaan:** This is unrelated to drinking culture.
"
Faakhtah key mojassamey kahaan waqea hein?,"The correct answer is **B: Church key sahan mein (In the church courtyard)**.

The text says: ""Cleasa key sahan mean kachh maqbaron purr sing marmar say banay fakhtaon dilchasp mujasme hain."" This translates to: ""In the church courtyard, there are some tombs made of pink marble, which are interesting sculptures.""
"
Kis qism key visa ko kaafi maliyaati taawun ka soboot faraham karney key liye kisi shakhs ki darkaar hoti hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Talabah ka visa (Student visa)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ziyadah ther mamalik mean jahaan aap taleem haasil karnaa chahte ho vahan key idaarey say aafar later aur cum say cum khud keliye pehle taleemi saal key ikhrajat key waastay fund key sabut kee zaroorat hogi."" (In many countries where you want to pursue education, you will need proof of funds for your own tuition expenses for the first academic year from the relevant authority.)

This directly refers to the requirement for financial proof when applying for a student visa.  While other visa types *might* require financial proof in some cases, the text clearly links it to the student visa and tuition expenses.
"
Bahut ziyadah mumkanah tor parr tausee shudah visa ki kisko darkaar hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek aalami talabah (A global student)**.

The text explicitly states: ""lekin eek been alaqwami talib alam kee haisiyat say vahan jaaney key liye aam tor par vahan mahaz eek tafrihi seyaah key bator jaaney say kahein ziyadah taweel qayaam kee zaroorat hoti hay.""  This translates to ""but to go there in the capacity of an international student, generally more than just a recreational tourist visit is required.""  

Therefore, an international student requires a longer-term visa than a tourist. The other options are less accurate based on the provided text.
"
Machcharon ki aapko khaas tor parr kabb yaad aani chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Paidal safar parr (On a foot journey)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions the need for mosquito protection when traveling on foot through dense jungles. The initial sentence states the need to protect oneself from mosquitoes when cycling. While the question uses ""pedal safar"" which translates to cycling, the context is about a journey *through* the jungle, implying walking or trekking.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Mosame garma key mahino key doraan (During hot months):**  While mosquitoes are more prevalent in hot months, the passage emphasizes the need *during a journey* and not just seasonally.
* **C: Barish key jangalaat mein (In rainy jungles):** Rainy seasons *increase* mosquito populations, but the passage highlights the general need when traveling through jungles, regardless of rainfall.
* **D: Chalatey waqt (While moving):** This is too general. The passage points to the situation when specifically traveling *on foot* through the jungle.



Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the core message of the provided text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, barish key jangal mein drve kartey waqt machcharon sey bachney key liye kiya karney sey aapko ruknaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Bahut der tak gaadi key darwazon ko khula chodna** (Leaving the car doors open for a long time).

Here's why:

* The original text states that in a humid, tropical rainforest, opening the car door for even a few seconds can allow mosquitoes to enter and bite you.
* Option A directly reflects this danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mosame garma key doraan drive karnaa** (Driving during hot weather) - While hot weather *can* increase mosquito activity, it's not the primary reason for the danger described in the text.
* **C: Zaili tropical elaaqon mein drive karnaa** (Driving in humid tropical areas) - While humid tropical areas have more mosquitoes, it's the *opening of the doors* that's the problem, not just the location.
* **D: Paidal safar key doraan gaadi ko nazar andaaz chod dena** (Leaving the car unattended while walking) - This is unrelated to mosquito exposure.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Sundarbans key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Yehh bengal key tigaron sey ziyadah chitkabrey hirano ka ghar hay** (This is the home of more spotted deer than Bengal tigers).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""takhmina lagaya gayaa hai kah iss elaqay mein abb 400 bengali cheetay our 30,000 key qareeb chitkabray hirran mojud hain."" (It is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in this area.)

* **This clearly indicates:** There are *far more* spotted deer than Bengal tigers. Therefore, statement D is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other statements are correct:

* **A: Yehh bahut kam bach jaaney waley taqatwar janglon mein sey kuchh ko nomayan karta hay** (This represents some of the few powerful jungles with very low survival rates). - While not explicitly stated, the mention of it being a former part of the Gangetic plains suggests it has faced significant challenges and has a unique, perhaps harsh, ecosystem.

* **B: Iskey kul elaqah mein sey aadha daldal mein fansa hua hay** (Half of its total area is trapped in swamps). - The text says ""1966aa say, sundarban eek jungli hayat kee aamajgah rahee hai our yeah takhmina lagaya gayaa hai kah iss elaqay mein abb 400 bengali cheetay our 30,000 key qareeb chitkabray hirran mojud hain."" (Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife sanctuary and it is estimated that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in this area.)  While not directly stating half is swamp, the nature of mangroves implies a significant swamp area.  Given the other options, this is the most likely correct interpretation.

* **C: Yehh duniya ka sabsey bada mangrove belt hay** (It is the world's largest mangrove belt). -  The text directly states: ""Yehh bengal key tigaron sey ziyadah chitkabrey hirano ka ghar hay"" (This is the home of more spotted deer than Bengal tigers). This makes option C correct.



"
Jangal ka konsa hissah Hindusani elaqah mein padta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans ka qomi Park**

The text states: ""Bhaarti elaqay mean mojud jungle kaa hissah sundarban national park kahalata hay."" which translates to ""The part of the jungle present in the Indian area is called Sundarbans National Park.""
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiskey paas bahut mumkanah tor parr angrezi zubaan ki kam az kam mahdud samajh hay?","The correct answer is **B: Kam umar key log (Young people)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Khaas tor pur chhoti umar key log. Tasavur karein kahh aap koyee mankonin, bostonin, jamaikan our sydnesider hain...Wah eek dosray kaa apnay aabayi shehron kee alga alga lehjay our maqami boli mean kahee gayee kahaniyon say dill behla rahay hain. **Jabki chhoti umar key log, unki ilm kam ho sakti hai**"" (Especially young people. Imagine you are a Mancunian, Bostonian, Jamaican and Sydnesider...While they are enjoying stories told in the distinct dialects and local languages of their home cities. **Whereas young people may have limited knowledge**).

The text directly links limited English understanding with younger individuals. The other options are not supported by the provided text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiska talaffuz karnaa mushkil ho sakta hay?","The correct answer is **C: Likhey huey alfaaz (Written words)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yeah bilkhusus khatabat purr sadiq hay jinn kaa durust talaffaz aksar dushwaar hota hay."" This translates to ""especially in speech, the correct pronunciation of what is said is often difficult.""  

The passage also implies that written words (likhey huey alfaaz) are generally more easily understood.  The difficulty lies in *speaking* correctly, not in understanding written words. While pronunciation in speech is challenging, the passage highlights the difficulty in *correctly* pronouncing spoken words, especially for those unfamiliar with the dialect.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the given text. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mumtaaz lahjon waley alfaaz (Words with excellent accents):** While accents can be tricky, the passage doesn't specifically say they are *difficult to pronounce*. It's the *correct* pronunciation of what's said that's the problem.
* **B: Patey (Pages):** Pages themselves don't have a pronunciation issue.
* **D: Maqami boli (Local dialects):** The passage acknowledges local dialects as part of the experience, but doesn't state they are inherently difficult to pronounce. It's the *correct* pronunciation within those dialects that's the issue.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, andrune zilaa station sey bus leney ka mansubah bananey waley kisi mosaafir key liey konsa manzar naamah nomunah ban sakta hay?","The correct answer is **A: Mosaafir Jakar ki taraf aagey badh raha hey aur usney pahley sey eek sabiqah ticket kharid rakha hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""halankah khaas toor purr wah ju mashriq our jakar/bumthang kee taraf jaati hain wah 06:30 our 07:30 bajay key darmiyan rakhsat hoti hain.""  This means buses going towards Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
* **The passage also suggests:** ""behatar ho gaa chand dunn pesh ther ticket khareed lia jaye."" This advises buying tickets in advance, especially because buses are often full.

Therefore, a traveler planning to take a bus from the inner district station to Jakar would likely want to depart between 6:30 and 7:30 and would benefit from purchasing a ticket beforehand.  Option A reflects both of these points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  The passage doesn't specify a departure time for Bumthang buses, and simply mentioning a 7:00 departure isn't directly supported by the text.
* **C:**  The passage mentions Paro and Panakha as taxi options, not bus routes.  There's no information to connect Paro to a bus departure time.
* **D:** The passage doesn't state that buses depart before 6:20. It only mentions departure times *between* 6:30 and 7:30 for buses going to the east (Jakar/Bumthang).



"
Andarune zilaa bus station sey mashriq ki taraf safar karney ko dekhney waley kisi sayyah key liye kiya cheez eek achcha noktah ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Peshgi ticket kharidein (Buy tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Choon kah azlaa key darmiyan chalnay waali basein aksar bhari hoti hain lehza behatar ho gaa chand dunn pesh ther ticket khareed lia jaye."" (Since the buses running between Azlaa are often full, it would be better to buy tickets in advance).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 8:30 key baad sirf basein rawanah hoti hein (Buses only depart after 8:30):** This is directly contradicted by the passage which says buses leave between 6:30 and 7:30 towards the east/jakar/bumthang.
* **C: Bahut see basein dinn bhar rawanah hoti hein (Many buses run throughout the day):** While technically true, the passage highlights the issue of buses being full and recommends buying tickets in advance *because* they are often full.
* **D: Eek mushtarekah taxi mein safar key sabsey ziyadah smart wasayel ho saktey hein (Sharing a taxi can be the smartest way to travel):**  The passage mentions taxis for shorter distances, but doesn't suggest it's the ""smartest"" way for a traveler going east from the district bus station. It focuses on buses being full.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Timbuktu ki durust wazahat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Yehh sayyarah sey na qaabile rasaayi hay (It is inaccessible by car).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iss key sakha asay eek seyahati dilkashi say bharpur elaqah banaati hay our iss kaa eek hawai addah hay."" (Its richness makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.) This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: Ismein mulk key baaqi zubaano ki banisbat Arabi ka ziyadah asaro rosukh hay (It has a greater influence of Arabic compared to other languages of the country):** The passage explicitly says: ""Ismein afriqi key bajaye ziyadah ther arabi mezaaj zoq paya jaataa hay."" (Instead of African, a greater Arab temperament and taste is found here.)
* **B: Yehh gurbat zadah hay (It is impoverished):** The passage states: ""1990aa mean isay sahrayi ret key khatray kee wajah say usay khatray mean ghiree aalimi warsay kee jaghon kee fehrist mean shaamil kirr lia gayaa."" (In 1990, due to the threat of desert sands, it was included in the list of World Heritage Sites.) This implies it was in a precarious state, often associated with poverty.
* **D: Ismein motajassis sayyahon key liye kashish baaqi hay (It still attracts curious travelers):** The passage says: ""Yeah shehar milk key baqiyah tamaam shehron say makmal tor par mukhtalif hay, iss liye kahh is mein afriqi key bajaye ziyadah ther arabi mezaaj zoq paya jaataa hai."" (This city is completely different from all other cities of the country, therefore, instead of African, a greater Arab temperament and taste is found here.)  The fact that it is unique and has historical significance makes it attractive to travelers.

Therefore, only option C is incorrect according to the passage.
"
Timbuktu key baarey mein konsi darjah zail haqeeqt sahee hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Ismein gardo nawah key shaharon ki banisbat kam tar Afriki zayeqah hay (It has less African flavor than cities of the Gardo Nawah).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Yeah hennery lois gets key pbs afriqi duniya key khususi ajayeb key doraan dekhnay key qaabil ahem maqamat mein say ek thaa. Yeah shehar milk key baqiyah tamaam shehron say makmal tor par mukhtalif hay, iss liye kahh iss mean afriqi key bajaye ziyadah ther arabi mezaaj zoq paya jaataa hai.""  (It was one of the important sights to see during Henry Louis Gates' PBS special on the special wonders of the African world. This city is completely different from all the other cities in the country, therefore, more Arab flavor than African taste is found in it.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shahar sayyarah sey qaabile rasaayi hay (The city is accessible by car):** The passage mentions it was historically a crucial trading post and mentions desert dangers, implying it wasn't always easily accessible by car. While it *can* be reached by car today, the passage doesn't highlight this.
* **B: Yehh gareeb sey ziyadah gair mulkee hay (It is more foreign than poor):** The passage describes it as having a distinct culture and flavor, not directly linking it to being ""more foreign"" than ""poor.""
* **D: Yehh shahar sayyahon key liye mazeed pur kashish nahein hay (This city is not very attractive to tourists):** The passage mentions it as an ""important sight to see"" and historically a trading hub, suggesting it *is* attractive to tourists.



Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the information in the passage."
Mosame garma key Olympics ki asal mein kabb miqaat bandi ki gayee thee? ,"The correct answer is **B: March 2020**.

The passage states: ""Mansukhi kee polician mukhtalif hoti hain, leakin march key aakhir say ziyadah ther corona wires purrr mubni policy july 2020 thak tausia nahein hoti hay, jib olympic co mansukh karnay kaa faislah kiya gayaa thaa."" This indicates that the decision to postpone the Olympics was made around March 2020.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss noqtah chimney toofan ban jaati hay?","The correct answer is **D: Zameen ko chooney key baad (After touching the ground)**.

The passage states: ""Inn kee sharoaat toofani baadlon say nikalnay waale gaalon jaisi hoti hay leakin zameen co chhoote hee wah """"aandhi"""" bunn jaatay hay."" which translates to ""They start like cheeks coming out of stormy clouds, but as soon as they touch the ground, they become a 'storm'."" 

Therefore, the key point is the moment the storm touches the ground, it becomes a full-fledged storm. Option D accurately reflects this.
"
Inmein sey kon toofan ki durust khosusiyat nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Wohh hameshaa 100-200 meel fee ghantah key aas paas ki hawayein paida karti hein**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wah tez hawayein paida kartay hain (aksar 100 say 200 meal fee ghantah kee raftaar)..."" This means the winds *often* reach 100-200 mph, but they don't *always* maintain that speed.  They can be less intense initially.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: Wohh akasar bhaari zarraat lekar chalti hein** - The text says ""toofani aandhi bhaari ashyaa cow apnay saath adaa lay jaati hay"" (stormy winds carry heavy objects with them), implying they carry debris.
* **C: Zameen chooney key baad wohh chimniyaan bann jaati hein** - The text states ""Zameen co chhoote hee wah """"aandhi"""" bunn jaatay hain"" (As soon as they touch the ground, they become ""storms"").
* **D: Wohh baahar hawa ko dhakelney waley kalmon ki katayi kar rahey hein** - The text says ""Wohh baahar hawa ko dhakelney waley kalmon say sharoaat karti hein"" (They start from columns pushing the outside air).



Therefore, option A is the only one that isn't directly supported by the text."
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, eek mosaafir ko apney manzil shahar mein kahaan sey seyaasi halat key baarey mein mashwarah haasil karnaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Jis mulk ka wohh daurah kar rahey hein uskey shahriyon sey**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Aap apni hukumat key elawah doosri hukumaton kaa mashurah bhee leena chaah saktay hain, leakin unn kaa mashurah inn key apnay shahriyon key liye hota hai."" (Besides your government, you can also seek advice from other governments, but their advice is for their own citizens.)
* **Option C aligns perfectly with this statement.** It suggests seeking advice from the citizens of the country being visited, who would have firsthand knowledge of the political situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uss mulk ki hukumat sey jiska wohh dorah kar rahey hein:** While potentially helpful, the passage points out that this advice is primarily for the country's own citizens.
* **B: Safar ki advisory mein pesh kardah nazaron sey:**  The passage says these are general, simplified views and not detailed information.
* **D: Khud apni hukumat sey:** The passage suggests seeking advice from *other* governments besides your own.



"
"Safar ki advisory key pasey manzar mein, khaarji shahriyon ko kiss cheez ka samnaa karna namumkin hay?","The correct answer is **D: Mulk ki seyaasi surate haal key baarey mein tafseeli malumaat (Detailed information about the country's political situation)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hukumati salah kisee mulk kee seyasi haalat kaa mahaz mukhtasir bayaniah hay. Pesh kiyey gaye khayalat aksarsarsari, omumi our bahut ziyadah saadah hain beh nisbat inn tafsili malumat key ju doosri jaghon purr milti hain.""

This means government advice is only a brief overview of the political situation and doesn't offer detailed information. The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: Motassirah ki mansukhi ka insurance (Insurance of the affected person):** The text says travel insurance *can* be affected by health insurance.
* **B: Mulk ki seyasi surate haal key baarey mein hadd sey ziyaadah aasan khulasey (Excessively simple explanations about the country's political situation):** The text states the explanations are *very simple*, not excessively so.
* **C: Motassirah ki sehat ka insurance (Insurance of the affected person's health):**  The text mentions health insurance can affect travel insurance.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kis qism key safar ko kisi safar key agent sey booking ka taawun haasil karna kam az kam mumkin hay?","The correct answer is **A: Eek shahar mein kaam ki conference ka safar jiska mosaafir ney iss sey pahley daurah kiya ho** (A trip to a work conference in a city the traveler has visited before).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes travel agents being helpful for *new* experiences and guiding travelers through unfamiliar territories, cultures, and languages.**  A traveler who has already been to a city for a conference doesn't need that kind of guidance.  They likely already know the area and the logistics.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be impossible to book with an agent:

* **B: Eek bahut hi khaas bajat mein do haftey ka safar (A two-week trip on a very tight budget):**  Agents *do* often specialize in budget travel. It might be challenging, but not impossible.
* **C: Eek safar jiss sey zubaan ki rukawat pesh aayegi (A trip where language barriers will be an issue):**  This is exactly where travel agents are helpful. They can book tours with multilingual guides and arrange for translators.
* **D: Eek mosafir ka bairune mulk ka pahla safar (A traveler's first trip abroad):** This is *prime* territory for travel agents.  They can handle all the complexities of international travel for a first-time traveler.



Therefore, the option that contradicts the passage's main points is A.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss manzar naamah mein safari agent ki madad sey eek mosaafir ko sabsey ziyaadah faaedah haasil hota hay?","The best answer is **B: Jabb mosaafir ko pahli baar khususi safar ko book karney mein dilchaspi ho (When the traveler is interested in booking a special trip for the first time.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that travel agents specialize in different types of trips.**  It says some agents have expertise in ""khaas qism key safar"" (special kinds of trips).  A first-time traveler looking for a ""special trip"" is the most likely candidate to benefit from this specialization.
* **The passage describes the role of a travel agent as a guide who leverages knowledge of various aspects of a destination.**  A first-time traveler is most likely to need this kind of guidance.
* **While options A, C, and D might be beneficial in *some* situations, they aren't the *most* directly linked to the core value proposition of using a travel agent described in the passage.** The passage highlights expertise in diverse trip types, not necessarily specific skills like language proficiency or familiarity with cultural differences.

Therefore, someone booking a special trip for the first time is the one who stands to gain the most from the travel agent's expertise.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, naye maqamaat ka daurah kartey waqt eek mosaafir ko mayoosi sey bachney mein kiya cheez madad kar sakti hay?","The correct answer is **C: Jahaan key hein ussi tarah key qanoon ko manana (Respecting the laws of the place).**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes avoiding disappointment and disrespecting local customs. It specifically lists things like ways of life, laws, food, income/expense, housing, quality, language, and other similar things. The passage states, ""is baat ko hamesha dhiyan mein rakhnay ki zaroorat hai kah tham mayusi say aur ghaliban mahalli logon key tor tareeqon par nagwari say ijtanaab kro."" which translates to ""It is always necessary to keep this in mind that avoid disappointment and mostly avoid being disrespectful to the local people's ways.""

Option C directly aligns with this advice. Respecting local laws is a key aspect of avoiding disappointment and being a respectful traveler.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wohh log jahaan sey hein usee tarah key meyaar ki tawaqqo karnaa (Expecting the same standards as home):** The passage explicitly warns *against* this, as it leads to disappointment.
* **B: Eek gair maanus khaano ko aazmaaney ki chaahat (Desire to try unusual food):** While trying new foods can be a positive experience, the passage doesn't focus on food specifically as a means to avoid disappointment.
* **D: Qiyaam parr sabiqah tahqiq sey bachna (Avoiding prior research):** The passage doesn't mention avoiding research.

Therefore, respecting local laws (Option C) is the most relevant and correct answer based on the provided passage.
"
"Ebarat mein malumaat ki buniyaad parr, kis qism key shakhs ko kisi kharijee maqam ka safar kartey waqt mayusi ka saamna ho sakta hay?","सही जवाब है **B: Tabdeeli parr pinapney walaa shakhs** (परिवर्तन पर पनपने वाला व्यक्ति)।

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि यात्रा करते समय निराशा का सामना करने वाले व्यक्ति को यह ध्यान रखना चाहिए कि वे ""घर पर रहने वाले"" तरीके, कानून, भोजन, आय-व्यय, आवास, गुणवत्ता, भाषा और इसी तरह की कई चीजों से अलग होने वाले हैं।  यह दर्शाता है कि जो व्यक्ति परिवर्तन को स्वीकार करने में असमर्थ हैं, वे निराशा का अनुभव कर सकते हैं।

अन्य विकल्प सही नहीं हैं:

* **A: Gair mulki khanon ko pasand karney walaa shakhs** (विदेशी खानों को पसंद करने वाला व्यक्ति):  विभिन्न संस्कृतियों के भोजन को पसंद करना परिवर्तन के अनुकूल होने का संकेत है, न कि निराशा का।
* **C: Band dimaagh shakhs** (बंद दिमाग वाला व्यक्ति): बंद दिमाग वाला व्यक्ति यात्रा के दौरान निराशा का सामना कर सकता है, लेकिन पाठ परिवर्तन को स्वीकार करने की कमी पर अधिक केंद्रित है।
* **D: Taleem sey lutf andoz honey walaa shakhs** (शिक्षा से आनंद लेने वाला व्यक्ति): शिक्षा से आनंद लेना परिवर्तन के अनुकूल होने का संकेत है।

इसलिए, सबसे उपयुक्त उत्तर वह व्यक्ति है जो परिवर्तन को स्वीकार करने में असमर्थ है।"
Darjah zail mein sey kon pahli baar taraqqi pazeer mulk ka daurah karney waley mosaafiron key sifaarish kardah mashwarah hay?,"The correct answer is **D: Jabb aap pahley pahunchey to eek meyaari hotel mein sarmaya karein.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly advises travelers to spend generously on Western-style hotels, food, and services in the initial days to ease the transition.** This aligns perfectly with option D.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Zameen parr sonay sey pahley maqami janwar ko janana (Before sleeping on the ground, know about local animals):** While important for safety, the passage focuses on the initial accommodation choice, not just animal awareness.
* **B: Apney pahley chand dinon key doraan khana parr nomaaesh sey bachna (Avoid showing off while eating in the first few days):** This isn't directly addressed in the passage. The passage advises spending on *good* food and services, not avoiding displaying enjoyment.
* **C: Agar baahar camp kana ho to eek plang yaa jhoola ki sifarish ki jaati hay (If going camping, a cot or hammock is recommended):**  This is about camping specifically, not the general recommendation for first-time visitors to a developing country.



Therefore, option D best reflects the core advice given in the passage.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon iss tor parr zikr nahein kiya jaata hay kehh kisi cheez parr taraqqi pazeer mulk sey mowafiqat key waqt nomaesh karna hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Camp karney key liye toshak aur pad (Bed and mat for camping)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically advises spending money on Western-style hotels, food, and services *during the initial days* to ease the transition. It also suggests bringing a cot or hammock for camping to protect from snakes and other animals.  

However, the passage **doesn't mention** the need to present something ""according to the progress-accepting country"" when seeking approval for something. The question is asking what isn't mentioned in relation to presenting something according to the country's standards. The passage focuses on practicalities of initial travel and accommodation, not on formal presentations or approvals.

The other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Magribi andaaz ka khaana (Western-style food):** The passage advises spending on Western-style food.
*   **B: Meyaari khidmaat (Standard services):**  The passage advises spending on standard services.
*   **D: Meyaari hotel (Standard hotel):** The passage advises spending on standard hotels.

Therefore, option C is the only one that isn't directly referenced in the passage's guidance.

"Darjah zail konsa ikhteyaar eek policy key haamil shakhs key liye behtareen hay jo apni policy ki eek majazi naqal hoti hay, lekin ho sakta hay kehh uss mein internet tak rasaayi na ho?","The best answer is **C: Apney laptop ki memory mein store kardah eek naqal ko barqaraar rakhein (Keep a copy stored in your laptop's memory).**

Here's why:

* **The prompt specifically mentions traveling with a laptop or tablet and storing a copy offline (without internet access).** Option C directly addresses this requirement.
* **Options A, B, and D require internet access.**  The question states the copy needs to be accessible *without* internet connectivity.
* **Storing on a laptop's memory (C) fulfills the requirement of an offline, accessible copy.**

Therefore, keeping a copy stored in the laptop's memory is the most practical and suitable option for a policy holder who needs an offline digital copy.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kisko policy parr dikhney ki zarurat nahein hay?","The correct answer is **D: Policy key haamil shakhs ka email patah**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that for claims, you need to show the claimant's (be mahdaaron ka) national phone number (been alaqwami phone nambaraat) and a copy of the policy (Mashurah/Mukhtar Namah).  It also mentions sending a copy of the policy to yourself or storing it in the ""cloud.""

The passage *doesn't* mention needing to share the policyholder's (policy key haamil shakhs ka) email address.  The focus is on contact information for the claimant (for claims) and the policy document itself.

Let's look at why the other options *are* important:

*   **A: Dawaa karney key liye aalami phone number (National phone number for claims):**  The passage *directly* says you need to show the claimant's national phone number for claims.
*   **B: Yaqeen dehindah ka email patah (Surety's email address):** While not explicitly stating the need, having the surety's email address is implied for communication purposes (sending a copy of the policy).
*   **C: Ijazat dahi key liye aalami phone number (National phone number for authorization):**  This is slightly ambiguous, but it's likely referring to a national phone number required for authorization processes, which is implied in the context of claims and policy handling.



Therefore, only the policyholder's email address is *not* explicitly stated as necessary to share according to the passage.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsa manfi size ziyadah tarr istemaal honey wali film ki wazaa ki akkaasi karta hay?","The correct answer is **B: 56 x 56 milimeter manfi**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kachh medium format film cameron mean 6*6 senti meter format, ziyadah darsat toor purr 56*56 mm negtio kaa istemaal kiya jaataa hay.""  This translates to ""Some medium format film in a Cameron uses a 6x6 centimeter format, more often a 56x56 mm negative is used.""

The text also highlights that the 56x56mm negative provides approximately four times the resolution of a 35mm negative.  Therefore, the 56x56mm negative is the one that is used more often when higher resolution is desired.
"
Darjah zail film ki wazaoon mein sey kon aisi qaraar daad ki peshkash karta hay jo DSLR key momaasil hay?,"The correct answer is **C: 56 x 56 milimeter ki film**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that 56 x 56mm negatives offer approximately four times the resolution of 35mm negatives.
* The question asks which film offers a resolution comparable to a DSLR. DSLRs typically have a very high resolution.
* Therefore, the film with the highest resolution mentioned is the most likely to be comparable to a DSLR.

While 35mm is common and the passage mentions it, it's not explicitly stated to be *comparable* to a DSLR. The medium format film (56x56mm) is highlighted as having significantly higher resolution, making it the closest match to a DSLR.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, inmein sey kon karobaar ko likhney walaa eek safar shuru karney key silsiley mein aakhiri qadam hogaa?","The correct answer is **C: Apni niji website tameer karein (Build your own personal website)**.

Here's why:

The passage outlines a process:

1. **Develop skills:** Hone your writing and web formatting/editing skills.
2. **Build a website:**  The passage states you can then build your own website.

Therefore, building your own website is the final step in the sequence described.  The other options are steps *leading up to* website building.
"
"Karobaar likhney waley eek safar shuru kartey waqt, darjah zail konsi salahiyat mumkanah tor parr sabsey pahley nikhaara janaa chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Tadween karnaa (Writing)**.

Here's why:

* **Tadween karnaa (Writing)** is the foundation of any travel blog. Before you can build a website, create content, or even understand web formatting, you need to be able to write engaging and informative pieces. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable as the *first* step:

* **A: Blog likhnaa (Writing a blog)** is a good goal, but it doesn't address the fundamental skill of *writing itself*.
* **B: Web wazaa karnaa (Web design)** is important, but it's a technical skill that's best learned *after* you have content to showcase.
* **D: Website banana (Building a website)** is the final step, and you need content and some understanding of formatting before you can effectively build a website.

Therefore, the most logical and foundational skill to develop when starting a travel business is **writing**. You need to be able to create content before you can market it or display it on a website.



"
Kiss qism key mosam mein aanton waley masayel paye jaatey hein?,"The correct answer is **C: Garam aabo hawa (Warm climate)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Garam ab woo hawa our jism key baahir donon hee jighon mean bacteria ziyadah teezi say phailta hay aur ziyadah arse thak zindah rehta hay..."" which translates to ""Warm, humid air spreads bacteria rapidly both inside and outside the body and bacteria remain alive for a longer period.""  This directly links warm weather to the increased prevalence of bacterial issues.
"
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, baqaedah beneqaabi kis cheez ki quwwate modafeat ka sabab ho sakti hay?","The correct answer is **B: Maqami jaraseem (Local germs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ghar mean elaqayi jaraseem key saath muslisil raabtay kee wajah say mashkalaat ziyadah hain..."" (Problems are more due to continuous contact with local germs at home...).  The entire passage is about the dangers of local germs and their effects on the body.
* **The question asks about the cause of ""quwwate modafeat"" (defensive powers) related to a *baqaedah beneqaabi* (regular mask-wearing).**  Mask-wearing aims to *prevent* the spread of germs. Therefore, the germs themselves are the underlying cause of the need for defense, and the local germs mentioned are the focus of this defense.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Aanton key masayel (Intestinal problems):** While intestinal problems can be serious, the passage's primary focus is on respiratory issues caused by germs.
* **C: Saans key masayel (Breathing problems):** Breathing problems are a *symptom* of the germ infection, not the cause of the defensive powers needed for protection.
* **D: Dilli ka pet (Delhi belly):** This is a specific type of intestinal illness, again, not the central theme of the passage.

Therefore, the passage strongly suggests that the local germs are the reason why mask-wearing (a regular *baqaedah beneqaabi*) would be beneficial in strengthening defensive powers.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon Schengen mintaqah key andar safar kaa faayedah hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaseer visa darkhawaston sey bachnaa**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that within the Schengen Area, you generally only need one visa.  It highlights how the Schengen Area allows you to travel freely between member countries without repeated passport checks. While the other options (B and C) are benefits, they are consequences of the main advantage: avoiding multiple visa applications. Option D is incorrect because passports are still required for entry into the Schengen Area.



"
Tutankhamun key maqbarah mein kiya cheez abb aur nahein payi jaa sakti?,"The correct answer is **C: Maan key kandhey (Mummy's shoulders)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Harr wah shakhas ju tabut mean say mummy cow hatanay kee koshishon kee doraan pahunchnay waale nqsan cow dekhnay mean dilchaspi rakhta thaa mahaz mayus hee how gaa keunkah sarf sarr aur kandhay hee dikhayi day rahay hain."" which translates to: ""Everyone who was interested in seeing the damage done during attempts to remove the mummy from the sarcophagus would be disappointed because only the head and shoulders were visible.""

Therefore, the shoulders of the mummy are no longer visible.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, Vancouver ki konsi manzil qimat sey bedaar mosaafiron keliye kam az kam jaazib hogee? ","The correct answer is **A: Granville jazeerah**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inn logon key liye ju beruni khaanah nishatat say mutamtaa honaa chahte hain samandar say aasmani gulyaray kee rahe noordi laazim hay. Wahsalar (ju woo yankovar say 1.5ghantay key drive purr hay) kharchila hay leakin 2010 key sarmayi olympic kee wajah say khoob maruf hay."" This implies that Wahsalar is a more expensive option.

The passage also says, ""baasani pahuncha jaa sakta hay inn logon key liye ju beruni khaanah nishatat say mutamtaa honaa chahte hain samandar say aasmani gulyaray kee rahe noordi laazim hay.” This suggests Granville Island is easily accessible.

The passage states that Granville Island is accessible via water taxis from downtown Vancouver. While the passage doesn't explicitly state the cost of Granville Island, the phrase ""easily accessible"" combined with the other information makes it the least likely to be expensive compared to Wahsalar. Therefore, it would be the least attractive destination for budget-conscious travelers.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, konsi manzil bahut mumkanah tor parr mosaafiron ko eek tausiqi Vancouver tajrabah ki peshkash karti hay?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen jazeerah**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...iss aseel community kaa mahli skonat how sound hay ju venkovar say kachh dori parwaqa hay jis thak down town venkovar mean granville jazirah say rawanah honey waali bahri taxis key zariah baasani pahuncha jaa sakta hay."" This describes Bowen Island. The text then goes on to mention that it's popular for weekend getaways and offers kayaking, hiking, and dining.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Seeti bajaney walaa (Seetibajaney walaa):** This doesn't appear in the text.
*   **C: Vancouver shahar ka nichlaa hissah (Vancouver city ka nichla hissah):** While it's accessible, the text emphasizes Bowen Island as a destination *outside* downtown Vancouver for a true experience.
*   **D: Granville jazirah (Granville Island):** The text mentions Granville Island as a departure point for ferries, but not as a destination for a *weekend escape* experience in the same way Bowen Island is.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar mosaafir bila rok tok waley manazir haasil kar rahey hein to unhein kabb Falls ka daurah karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Jabb paani ki miqdaar oonchi ho**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Baarish key mausam (nomber say march) mean paani kee satah buland hogi aur aabshaar bhee bhat dramayi hone gay."" (During the rainy season (November to March), the water level will be high and the waterfall will be very dramatic.)

The text also mentions that at this time, the view of the actual waterfall might be obscured by the sheer volume of water.  This suggests that it's during this high-water period that the waterfall is most impressive, even if the direct view is altered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: March key zariyah novambar:** This is just stating the months in reverse order and doesn't explain *why* someone should visit during those months.
*   **B: Seyahat waley season key doraan:** The text doesn't specify what the ""travel season"" is.
*   **D: barish waley season key baahar:** The text indicates the waterfall is *more* dramatic during the rainy season.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, navambar aur march key darmiyaan Victoria Falls ka daurah karney ka ultaa kiya hay?","The correct answer is **C: Falls key daramayi manazir (Dramatic views of the Falls)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Baarish key mausam (nomber say march) mean paani kee satah buland hogi aur aabshaar bhee bhat dramayi hone gay."" (During the rainy season (November to March), the water level will be high and the waterfall will be very dramatic.)

Therefore, traveling during November to March will offer the most dramatic views of Victoria Falls. Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the text.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kiski film key liye drone istemaal kartey waqt sifaarish ki jaati hay?","The correct answer is **C: Ijazaton ki tahqiq karnaa (Investigating permits)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the importance of checking *before* filming with a drone, specifically regarding permissions. It states: ""Agar kasee cheez kee sarf tasveer leenay kee ajazat nahein hay, too aap cow iss cheez kee video recording karnay key baaray sochna bhee nahein chahiye."" (If you don't have permission to just take a picture of something, then you shouldn't even consider recording a video of it.)

Therefore, the most logical recommendation is to investigate the necessary permits for filming.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Peshgi yehh padtaal karnaa kehh aap ko film key liye ijazat hay (Checking beforehand whether you have permission for the film):**  This is a good idea, but ""investigating permits"" is a broader, more actionable step.
* **B: Ezaafi license haasil karnaa (Obtaining an additional license):** The text mentions additional licenses *might* be needed, but doesn't state that obtaining one is the primary recommendation.
* **D: Sirf bheed bhaad waley elaqey mein film karna jahaan ko dekha na jaa sakey (Filming only in crowded areas where you can't be seen):** This is a risky and potentially illegal suggestion, and the text strongly discourages flying drones near airports or in other problematic situations. It's not a recommended practice.



"
"Ebarat key hiaab sey, eek drone istemaal kenrtey huey film key liye behtareen maqamaat kahaan hein?","The correct answer is **D: Aisey elaqon mein jis keliye aap nein pahley sey ijazat ley rakhi hay**.

Here's why:

* The provided text emphasizes that you **must** have permission to film in a location. 
* Option D directly addresses this by suggesting filming in locations where you've already obtained the necessary permits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aisee bheed key paas jo drone ki mojudgi sey parishaan nahein hoti hein:**  While avoiding crowds is good practice, it doesn't address the legal requirement of obtaining permission.
* **B: Aisey elaqon mein jahaan baqaeddh photography ki ijazat nahein hay:** This is a *bad* idea. The text explicitly says if you can't get permission for photos, you shouldn't even consider filming.
* **C: Masruf jaghon mein jahaan drone kam maryee hota hay:**  This is a secondary consideration at best.  Legal permission is paramount.



"
"Ebarat ki buniyaad, visa amal ki registory ki zarurat key baarey mein konsa bayaniyah sahee naein hay?","The correct answer is **B: Tamaam mamalik ko maqami hukkaam sey inderaaj karanaa zaruri hay** (All countries require registration with local authorities).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Bhat say mumalik mean aise qanoon key saath, maqami hotel andraj kaa intezam karein gay (koshish karein kah pooch lain)... Deegar muamilat mean faqat inhein afraad cow register karnay kee zaroorat hay ju tourists key qayaam kee jighon say baahir qayaam kartay hein.""  This means *not all* countries require registration with local authorities.  It's only necessary for those staying beyond tourist areas.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Agar aap sayyah ki rehaaesh gaahon mein qiyaam kar rahey hein to ho sakta hay aap ko inderaaj karney ki zarurat na ho** (If you are staying in tourist locations, you may not need to register) - This aligns with the text's emphasis on registration only *outside* tourist areas.
* **C: Muntaqili office mein janey ki zarurat ho sakti hay** (You may need to go to the immigration office) - The text mentions ""muntaqili office mein janey ki zarurat ho sakti hay"" as a possibility.
* **D: Kuch maqamaat mein maqami hotel inderaaj ko sanbhaal saktey hein** (In some places, local hotels can handle registration) - The text says ""maqami hotel andraj kaa intezam karein gay (koshish karein kah pooch lain)"", indicating hotels may be involved.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon eek aisi jagah nahein hay jahaan inderaaj ko sanbhaalney key liye eek sayyah ko janaa ho sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Eek maqami post office**.

The passage states that tourists need to register at a local police station or the immigration office. It also mentions hotels as a place where registration might be arranged.  A post office is not mentioned as a place for this registration.
"
Safar karney key doraan kisko razakaranah kaam karney fayedah nahein hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaafi tankhawah ki talaash karney walaa koyi shakhs**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that volunteering is not *just* about religious service. It highlights personal growth, cultural immersion, learning new skills, and even financial benefits (housing, food, and sometimes stipends).

Option B directly contradicts this. Someone primarily seeking a substantial salary wouldn't find volunteering to be a beneficial or appropriate activity, as the passage suggests volunteering might not provide significant financial compensation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Naye dost bananey ki ummid rakhney waley kisi shakhs ko bairune mulk janaa hoga:** Making new friends *is* a benefit mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Nayee maharat haasil karney ki ummid rakhney walaa koyi shakhs:**  Learning new skills is explicitly stated as a key benefit of volunteering.
* **D: Koyi aisa shakhs jo ho sakta hay kehh kamrah ya bairune mulk mein dilchaspi na rakhta ho:**  A lack of interest in travel would obviously make volunteering difficult, but it's not a primary reason volunteering would *not* be beneficial.  The passage highlights the positive aspects of travel and cultural immersion.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, bairune mulk hotey huey razakaranah kaam karnaa kisi bajat waley mosaafir key liye fayedah mand kaisey hay?","The correct answer is **D: Yehh noqtaye nazar ka mafhoom haasil karney mein aap ki madad karta hay (This helps in understanding different perspectives).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that living abroad and volunteering is a great way to ""know about yourself, feel different viewpoints, and even acquire new skills.""  This directly connects to understanding different perspectives.
* While options A, B, and C might be *possible* benefits, they aren't the central theme discussed in the passage. The passage emphasizes personal growth, cultural understanding, and gaining new perspectives more than financial gain (though the passage mentions budget needs).

Therefore, option D best reflects the main idea of why volunteering abroad is beneficial, especially for budget-conscious travelers.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss cheez ko Walt Disney duniyaa key motawassit safar eek aam samjhaa jaa skata hay?","The correct answer is **A: Parkon ki daryaaft karney walaa haftah guzaarna.**

Here's why:

The passage states that a typical Walt Disney World trip involves ""taqriba eek hafta guzarna"" (spending about a week) at Disney World, including flights, hotel costs, and experiencing Disney property. Option A, ""Parkon ki daryaaft karney walaa haftah guzaarna"" (Spending a week visiting the parks), accurately reflects this core element of a typical Disney World vacation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Site sey baahar hotel mein qiyaam karnaa (Staying at a hotel outside the site):** The passage emphasizes staying at a Disney hotel.
* **C: Disney ki jayedaad parr mokammal safar guzaarna (Completing a full trip to Disney property):** While this is part of the experience, the passage focuses on the overall *duration* of the trip (a week) rather than the completeness of visiting *all* Disney properties.
* **D: Airport sey hotel tak bus lenaa (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel):** This is a logistical detail, not a defining characteristic of the average Disney World vacation.



"
Walt Disney duniya key baarey mein konsa darjah zail bayaniyah sahee nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Airport sey jayedaad tak ley jaaney key liye busein dastiyaab hein** (Buses are available from the airport to the city).

Here's why:

The text *mentions* flights to Orlando, Disney hotels, and staying at a Disney property. However, it **doesn't say anything about buses being available from the airport to the city.** The passage focuses on the cost and process of visiting Disney World.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Paark ki ummid rakhney waley ticket deegar mosaafiron keliye qabiley mutaqili nahein hein** (Park tickets are not transferable to other travelers): The text explicitly states ""ticket qaabil manqali nahein hain"" (tickets are not transferable).
* **B: Site parr rehaaesh dastiyaab hay** (Accommodation is available on-site): The text mentions staying at ""ddezni malkiyat cow turk kiye baghair taqriba eek hafta guzarna"" (spending almost a week without owning Disney property).  This implies on-site accommodation is an option.
* **D: Kaseer ayyam key ticket aksar boli ki websiton parr paye jaatey hein** (Multi-day tickets are often found on popular websites): The text mentions tickets being sold on websites like eBay and Craigslist.



Therefore, the only statement not supported by the text is that buses are available from the airport to the city.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsey masalah ka bahut mumkanah tor parr peshah waranah tarbiyat key class yaa ishaaton mein ehaatah nahein kiya jaa sakta hay?","सही उत्तर है **A: Jangali zindagi ki baqaa (जंगली ज़िंदगी की बकआ)**।

यहाँ कारण दिया गया है:

प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि ""इनhein paishah waranah tarbiyat haasil karni chahiye"" जिसका अर्थ है कि लोगों को पेशेवर और शैक्षिक प्रशिक्षण की आवश्यकता है। प्रश्न में ""mukhalif maahul kors"" (विभिन्न वातावरण पाठ्यक्रम) का उल्लेख है, जिसमें ""bhat say frist aid our kabhi kabhaar hathiyaron kee training bhee shaamil hogi"" (फर्स्ट एड और कभी-कभी हथियारों का प्रशिक्षण शामिल होगा) जैसे मुद्दे शामिल हैं।

प्रश्न में आगे उल्लेख है कि ""veeranay kee baqaa say mutaliq kitabein our rasayal aam hain, leakin jangi elaqon say mutalimat matbuaat cum hain"" (बंजर भूमि पर जीवित रहने से संबंधित किताबें और पत्रिकाएं आम हैं, लेकिन युद्ध क्षेत्रों पर आधारित प्रेस अधिक हैं)।

यह जानकारी संकेत करती है कि पाठ्यक्रम का ध्यान युद्ध और संघर्ष के लिए तैयार करने पर है।

विकल्पों में, ""जंगली zindagi ki baqaa"" (जंगली जीवन की बकआ) इस प्रशिक्षण पाठ्यक्रम के दायरे से बाहर प्रतीत होता है। पाठ्यक्रम युद्ध क्षेत्रों पर केंद्रित है, जबकि जंगली जीवन की बकआ एक अलग कौशल सेट है।

अन्य विकल्प, ""pahley taawun ki tayyaari"" (पहले तावुन की तययारी), ""jang key mintaqah ki tayyaari"" (जंग के मintaqah की तययारी), और ""kirdaar adaa karnaa"" (किरदार अदा करना), सभी युद्ध और संघर्ष के लिए तैयारी के संदर्भ में प्रासंगिक हैं और इसलिए प्रशिक्षण पाठ्यक्रम में शामिल किए जा सकते हैं।"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail konsey mauzu ka eek peshah waranah tarbiyat ki class mein ehaatah kiya jaa sakta hay?","The correct answer is **B: Jang key mintaqey (War zones)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions ""jung zadah elaqah tasavur kiya jasakta hay"" (a war-torn area can be imagined) and ""jangi elaqon say mutaliq matbuaat"" (press related to war zones).
* The curriculum includes ""frist aid aur kabhi kabhaar hathiyaron kee training"" (first aid and sometimes weapons training), both directly relevant to war zones.
* The phrase ""mukhalif maahul kors"" (hostile environment course) further reinforces the focus on challenging, potentially dangerous areas like war zones.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Pahla taawun (First Aid):** While first aid is mentioned, it's only *part* of the curriculum, not the overarching theme.  The course is about more than just first aid.
* **C: Jangali zindagi ki baqaa (Survival in the wilderness):**  While survival skills *could* be relevant, the strong emphasis on weapons training and war-related media points to a more specifically militaristic context.
* **D: Muanedanah mahaul (Hostile environment):** This is a very broad term. While the course *is* in a hostile environment, ""jang key mintaqey"" is more specific and accurate based on the other details provided.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, mumkanah aaludah paani sey bacchney key liye behtareen ikhteyaar kia hay?","The correct answer is **B: Botal ka paani kharidein (Buy bottled water)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...aap tashwesh honey chahiye, too phir aap eek qaabil bharosah company say eek mehr band bottle mean aap cow paani khareedne purr ghoor karnaa chahiye."" This directly recommends buying bottled water for peace of mind.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kayi minton tak paani ubaalein (Boil water for several minutes):** The passage says ""Kuch elaqon mean, eek mint key liye paani abalna kaafi hay, kuch our jighon purr, bhat say mint darkaar hay"" (In some areas, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, in others, more than one minute is needed).  This is variable and not necessarily the *best* option for guaranteed safety.
* **C: eek minat paani ubaalein (Boil water for one minute):**  As mentioned above, the passage indicates this isn't universally sufficient.
* **D: Makhsus khatraat key liye paani ka andazah karnaa (Assess water for specific hazards):** While assessing water is important, the passage suggests buying bottled water as a simpler and more reliable method for avoiding contaminated water, especially when you want peace of mind.

Therefore, buying bottled water is the most direct and recommended option according to the given text.
"
"Ebaarat key hisaab sey, konsi cheez qareebi tor parr mumkin ho sakti hay neez maahir tairaakon key liye?","The correct answer is **A: Qareebi qurbat sey chatano tak mein tairnaa (Swimming close to the shore towards the rocks)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the difficulty of swimming against strong currents and the danger of deep water.** Option A involves swimming close to the shore, which likely means less intense currents and shallower water.
* **The passage mentions the frustration and exhaustion of trying to swim against the flow.** Option A avoids this.
* **The passage suggests finding landmarks to avoid getting caught in currents.** Swimming close to the shore naturally provides landmarks.
* **Option B (Swimming in deep water) is explicitly discouraged.**
* **Option C (Swimming against the flow) is also explicitly discouraged.**
* **Option D (Swimming around waves) is difficult and unpredictable.**

Therefore, swimming close to the shore (Option A) is the most feasible and advisable option, even for skilled swimmers, given the conditions described in the passage.
"
Agar aap bahao mein fans jayein to aap ko kiya karnaa chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Mokhaalif samt mein tairnaa (Swim against the opposite direction).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that currents are strongest in deeper sections.** Trying to swim directly against the current (Option B) is extremely difficult and tiring, as the passage points out.
* **Option A (Swim to the side to escape the current and then swim to shore) is also a viable strategy.** However, Option C is a more direct and often recommended initial response.
* **Option D (Swim beneath the surface) is generally not a good strategy.** It's risky, can lead to disorientation, and doesn't address the primary problem of the current pushing you along.

The passage emphasizes that escaping the current requires swimming *against* its direction. Therefore, ""Mokhaalif samt mein tairnaa"" is the best option.
"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, kiss mahalle waqoo mein kisi mahal ka daurah eek qabiley qadar chutti ka safar hogaa?","The correct answer is **C: Rhine waadi mein**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Rhine Valley (Rhine Veli) is a good place for cow vacations, mentioning visits to castles, exploring interesting cities along the Danube River, and boat trips on the Erie Canal.  This suggests the Rhine Valley offers a variety of activities suitable for a ""quaint holiday trip"" (qabiley qadar chutti ka safar).  

Let's look at why the others are less suitable:

* **A: Danube key atraaf eek shahar (A city around the Danube):** While the Danube is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically highlight a city around it as a prime vacation spot.
* **B: Erie Canal key saamney (In front of the Erie Canal):** The Erie Canal is mentioned, but the passage primarily emphasizes other destinations.
* **D: Kisi bhi andaruney zameen paani ka wasilah key qareeb (Any inland water body):** This is too general. The passage points to the Rhine Valley as a specific, interesting location near water.



"
"Ebarat key hisaab sey, darjah zail mein sey kon uss elaqah mein safar karney wali khawateen key liye sifarish kardah noktah hogaa?","The correct answer is **B: Iss baat sey aagah rahein kehh saqafati ekhtelafaat maqaami logon key taaqatwar rawayyah ko uksaa saktey hein.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly warns women traveling to those regions to be aware of cultural differences and how they might be exploited by locals.
* The passage also emphasizes that cultural differences are a reality and shouldn't be dismissed as trivial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mawaad ki haalat sey bachna (Avoid material conditions):** While perhaps a good general travel tip, it's not the *specific* recommendation made in the passage.
* **C: Chamakdaar zewar pahananey sey bachein (Avoid wearing shiny jewelry):** The passage says *any* jewelry is acceptable, even if not very expensive.  It specifically warns against *avoiding* shiny jewelry.
* **D: Jabb zarurat ho sakhti ka istemaal karein (Use force when necessary):** The passage advises men to be firm and consistent with their stance, but it doesn't suggest women should use force.  This is completely irrelevant.



"
Ebarat mein wazahat kardah elaqah ki buniyaad parr khawateen mosaafiron key liye madadgaar noktah kiya hogaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Martial haalat ki alaamat bataney key liye eek badi anguthi pahnein.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that women travelers are advised to wear a large ring on their finger as a sign of being married. This is directly related to the provided information. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shanakht karein kehh iss ki pairawee karnaa aam nahein hay:** While the passage implies it's not common, the main advice is to *do* it.
*   **C: Samjhein kehh saqafati ekhtelafaat iss baat ki tajweez kartey hein kehh aap apni zameen parr khadey honey sey bachein:** The passage doesn't suggest avoiding situations or being cautious due to cultural differences.
*   **D: Gair matlubah taraqqiyon ki surat mein thukraaney waley mardon key saath saabit qadam rahein:** This is about dealing with unwanted advances, but it's not the core piece of advice for female travelers mentioned in the text.

"Ebarat ki buniyaad parr, kis manzar naamah ko darkaar hay kehh eek jangali zindagi ka photographer eek khaas lens ka istemaal karey?","The correct answer is **A: Agar wohh khaas tor parr chotee makhluqaat ki tasweer ley rahey hon (If they are specifically taking pictures of small creatures).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wild life photography mean aksar eek lambi telly photo lens ke zaroorat hoti hay, halanki parindon key jhund yaa ek chhoti makhluq jaisi cheezon key liye dosray lens kee zaroorat hoti hay."" (Wildlife photography often requires a long telephoto lens, although for flocks of birds or small creatures, a different lens is needed.)

Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the passage. While the passage mentions challenges like shy animals and commercial purposes, it doesn't link them specifically to the *need* for a particular lens.  The primary reason for needing a different lens is to capture small subjects effectively.

Darjah zail mein sey kiska ebaarat mein jangali zindagi key photographer key liye mumkanah challenge tor parr zikr nahein hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Matlubah lens ki qism ko Source karnaa (Sourcing the required lens type)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes challenges like:

*   **Searching for elusive wild animals:** (Makhsus gair mulki janwaron ki talaash karnaa - searching for specific exotic animals)
*   **Dealing with wild animal behavior:** (Jarehaanah janwaron key saath bartao karnaa - interacting with wild animals)
*   **Working in difficult environments:** (Mumkanah mokhaalefanah mahaul mein kaam karnaa - working in potentially harsh environments)
*   **Having the right equipment (including lenses):** (The passage explicitly mentions needing long telephoto lenses and other lens types)

""Sourcing the required lens type"" is a logistical aspect of equipment acquisition, but not a direct *challenge* faced *during* the photography process itself. The other options describe difficulties directly encountered while working in the field.

Darjah zail mein sey kon mumkanah tor parr pahaadi guzar gaahon mein safar kerney waley kisi driver key liye kam az kam masayel ki wajah bann sakta hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Hadd sey ziyaadah kasafat (Excessive dirt/smog)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Barf garnay yaa adnay say yaa gaadi kee khadkiyon purr kasafat yaa barf key honey kee wajah say bhee kachh dikhayi nahein deeta"" which translates to ""Due to snow, ice, or dirt/smog on the car windows, nothing is visible.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhaari traffic (Heavy traffic):** While traffic can be an issue, the text doesn't mention it as a specific concern related to snowy mountain roads.
*   **B: Kam ragad (Low friction):** The text *does* mention low friction (""ragad cum hoti hay""), which is a major problem on snowy roads, but it describes the *effect* of low friction, not low friction itself.
*   **D: Kam kardah mariyat (Poor visibility):** Poor visibility is a consequence of snow, ice and dirt. However, the text specifically states that dirt/smog on the windows causes poor visibility.

Therefore, ""Hadd sey ziyaadah kasafat"" (Excessive dirt/smog) is the most directly mentioned cause of problems for a driver navigating snowy mountain roads.

Mukhtalif mamalik mein aamdani tax key baarey mein kisko mustaqil rahnaa mumkin hay?,"The correct answer is **C: Jahaan aap darj kartey hein (Where you reside/file)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that income tax is often levied based on where you reside or file your taxes. It highlights that tax brackets and rates vary significantly between countries and even within countries (like the US and Canada) due to federal and local taxation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Qimatein (Prices):** The passage doesn't discuss prices in relation to income tax.
* **B: Saakht (Structure/Construction):** This is irrelevant to income tax.
* **D: Bracketein (Brackets):** While tax brackets are *part* of the income tax system, the passage emphasizes that the *location* of filing (where you reside) is a key determining factor, not just the brackets themselves.

"Ebarat key hisaab sey, agar aap bairune mulk rahtey lekin kisi aur jagah ki buniyaad parr, kahaan aap mumkanah tor parr apna aamadni tax darj kar rahey hongey?","The correct answer is **A: Jahaan aapki aam tor par buniyad hoti hai (Where you normally have your base/residence)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that income tax is typically paid in the country where you *reside*. It emphasizes the importance of having a ""base"" or place of residence. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:

*   **B: Amrika mein (In America):** While the passage mentions the US, it doesn't say you *must* file taxes there if you live abroad.
*   **C: Jiss mulk mein aap filhaal kaam kar rahey hain (The country where you are currently working):** Working in a country doesn't automatically make it your tax residency.
*   **D: Jahaan fees sabsey kam ho (Where the fees are lowest):** Tax residency is determined by other factors, not just tax fees.



Therefore, the most logical answer is where you have your permanent home or base of operations."
Konsa darjah zail bayaniyah durust tor parr eek duniya key meley ki wazahat karta hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Nazarey eek mulk ki tareekh aur saqafat ko dikha sakti hay.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Shirkat karnay waale mamalik nay aalamgir masail yaa apnay milk kee saqafat our tareekh cow ajagar karnay key liye qomi povilienz mean fankarana our taleemi mazahire pesh kiye."" (Countries participating showcase their culture and history in their national pavilions.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nabataati nazaron ko fankaranah aur taleemi nazaron key saath dikhaya jaye:** While the passage mentions showcasing ""nabatiyati baghat"" (vegetation), it doesn't specifically say it's *always* alongside artistic and educational displays.
* **C: Taqribaat chah mahinon tak jaari rah sakti hein:** The passage says events usually last from June to September, meaning *at most* 4 months, not 6 months.
* **D: Mulkon ko shirkat karney ki zarurat nahein hay:** The passage states countries *do* participate (""Shirkat karnay waale mamalik nay..."").



"
Darjah zail mein sey kon duniya key melah yaa aalami nomaesh qanoon hay?,"The correct answer is **A: Nazaron ko mulk ki tareekh aur aalami masayel dono ko dikhanaa zaruri hay**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Shirkat karnay waale mamalik nay aalamgir masail yaa apnay milk kee saqafat our tareekh cow ajagar karnay key liye qomi povilienz mean fankarana aur taleemi mazahire pesh kiye."" (Participating countries showcase global issues or their country's culture and history in their national pavilions.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Salanah buniyaad parr eek hi mulk taqribaat ki mezbaani nahein kar sakta:** The passage says events *can* happen once a year (although they don't typically), implying a single country *could* host it annually.
* **C: Taqribaat ko chah mahinon tak jaari rahna zaruri hay:** The passage states events are generally held for six months, but doesn't say it's *required*.
* **D: Melah key muaqid honey key liye, tamaam mamalik ko shirkat karna zaruri hay:** The passage mentions participating countries, but doesn't say *all* countries have to participate.

Therefore, option A is the closest and most accurate reflection of the passage's meaning."
Darjha zail mein sey kiya karney sey kisi janwar key hamlah ka imkaan kam ho jayegaa?,"The correct answer is **B: Camp ki site sey kudaa hatanaa**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Badbudar khaana reechh aur dosray jungli janwaron ko raghib karta hay."" (Smelly food attracts jackals and other wild animals.)
* **Removing garbage eliminates the attractant:** By keeping the camp site clean and removing food waste, you reduce the likelihood of animals being drawn to the area.

Let's look at why the other options are less effective or incorrect:

* **A: Khusbudaar jadi buti lekar janaa (Taking fragrant herbs):** While potentially helpful, the text doesn't emphasize this as a primary preventative measure.
* **C: Bhediyon sey 25 gaz faselah rakhnaa (Maintaining a 25 gaz distance from jackals):** The text mentions this distance, but the core problem is the *attraction* to the area, not just proximity.
* **D: Khaney key tukdey ki madad sey janwaron ko roknaa (Using food pieces to deter animals):** This is the *opposite* of what the text advises. It highlights how food attracts animals.



"
Darjah zail mein sey kiska ebarat mein jangali zindagi key hamlon ki mumkanah wajah key tor parr zikr nahein kiya gaya hay?,"The correct answer is **B: Fasalah barqaraar rakhney mein nakaam (Failure to maintain separation)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions:

* **Feeding wild animals:** ""wahsi janwar phir bhee wahshi hotay hain jinn cow nah kachh khilana chahiye nah inn cow chhedna chahiye"" (wild animals are still wild, so you shouldn't feed them or disturb them.)
* **Maintaining distance:** ""reechh our bhediyon say cum az cum 100 guz/meter our dosray jungli janwaron say 25 guz/meter door rahein!"" (stay at least 100 yards from jackals and dogs, and 25 yards from other wild animals!)
* **Strong smell:** ""badbudar khaana reechh our dosray jungli janwaron ko raghib karta hay"" (smelly food attracts jackals and other wild animals).
* **Lack of proper tethering:** ""yeah janwar baday, jungli aur nqsan pahunchanay waale hain, iss liye inhein rasta deen. Mazeed iss baat kaa khayal rahaiye ki badbudar khaana laanay yaa pakanay say graze karein aur camp saaf rakhein. chunancha badbudar khaana laanay yaa pakanay say graze karein aur camp saaf rakhein."" (these animals are big, wild, and dangerous, so give them space. Also, keep in mind that bringing or cooking smelly food attracts animals and graze, and keep the camp clean.  If you bring or cook smelly food, animals will graze and the camp will be unclean.)

While the text mentions the dangers of smelly food and feeding animals, it *doesn't* directly link attacks to a failure to maintain separation between humans and animals. It emphasizes maintaining distance as a preventative measure.

Therefore, **B** is the correct answer because it's the only option not mentioned as a potential cause of wild animal attacks in the provided text.
