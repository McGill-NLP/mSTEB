He aha te pakanga e whakaahuatia ana i ētahi wā ko te ‘pakanga whakapono’ whakamutunga?,"The correct answer is **C: Pakanga o te angitu Pāniora (War of Spanish Succession)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ko te War of Spanish Succession te pakanga tuatahi ko te take matua ko te taurite o te mana. He tohu tēnei o tētahi tīnitanga nunui, nā te mea kāore ngā mana Pākehā he pakanga hāhī tēnei. Me te aha, ko tēnei pakanga torutekau tau te pakanga whakamutunga e tohua ai he pakanga hāhī.""  This translates to ""The War of Spanish Succession was the first war with the main reason being the balance of power. This is a sign of a great shift, because the European powers were not a major war. Furthermore, this thirty-year war is the last war marked as a major war.""

Ko tehea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei o te Hāhi Katorika kāore i tirotirohia?,"The correct answer is **D: Mehemea e tutuki ana nga pae matua o te Hāhi (If the main tenets of the Church are fulfilled)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the Church's power derived from its wealth and how that wealth was used to support its mission (charity, relief, etc.). It highlights the Church's influence and the potential consequences if that power and wealth were threatened.

Option D, ""If the main tenets of the Church are fulfilled,"" isn't directly addressed. The passage doesn't discuss whether the Church's core beliefs were being upheld. It only examines the power structure based on wealth.

Let's look at why the other options *were* touched upon:

* **A: Mēnā he tika te tohatoha taonga i roto i te Hāhi (If the disposal of wealth within the Church was proper):** The passage implies this, by stating that the Church's wealth was used for good purposes.  The stability of the Church's finances was key.
* **B: Mēnā me whakarerekē ngā kaupapa matua o te hāhi (If the main doctrines of the Church were altered):**  The passage suggests that a change in doctrines could impact the Church's authority and the support it received.  The emphasis on charity and relief ties into the doctrines.
* **C: Te whakamōhiotanga o te mana i roto i te Hāhi (The recognition of power within the Church):** This is explicitly mentioned. The passage details the power the Church held due to its wealth.



Therefore, only Option D is not a subject of the passage.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i patua i Versailles?","The correct answer is **C: He mema o te māpu**.

The passage states: ""Ki tētahi kāreti ka hoki atu rātou ki Parī e karapotia ana e te māpu tāngata..."" (They returned to Paris in a carriage escorted by a mob...) and ""...i pōwhiriwhiritia e tētahi mema o te māpu..."" (...a member of the mob greeted...).  This clearly indicates a member of the mob was responsible for the events described.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kihai i whakatikatikahia ki te Kingi me te Kuini e te mano?,"The correct answer is **A: Te whakatuwheratanga o ō rātou matapihi waka (The relocation of their royal apartments)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ki tētahi kāreti ka hoki atu rātou ki Parī e karapotia ana e te māpu tāngata e tioro ana, e hāparangi ana i ngā whakatuma ki te Kīngi me te Kuini. **I tōpana te māpu tāngata nei i te Kīngi me te Kuīni kia tītoretore ngā matapihi o tō rāua kāreti**."" (They were taken to Paris by a mob of people who were outraged and attacked the King and Queen. **The mob demanded that the King and Queen move out of their royal apartments**.)

The other options are not mentioned in the text as demands of the mob.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te hua o te pakanga moana kore noa o Ingarangi?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore i te taea te whakawātea i ngā rawa nui** (Large resources could not be unlocked).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Britain implementing a naval blockade against Germany after the outbreak of war.** This blockade aimed to cut off Germany's access to vital resources via the sea.
* **Option D directly contradicts this.** The blockade *was* intended to prevent Germany from unlocking large resources.  Therefore, it's the opposite of what the passage describes.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consequences of the British naval blockade:

* **A: Kei te hiahia a Tiamana ki te whakamahi i ngā tikanga pakanga ōrite** (Germany was required to use equal warfare tactics) - The blockade forced Germany to adapt their warfare tactics, including potentially resorting to unrestricted submarine warfare.
* **B: I tūkinotia nga kaipuke kāore i te tūkinotia** (Ships were sunk without being inspected) - Unrestricted submarine warfare, a direct result of the blockade, led to ships being sunk without inspection.
* **C: I mahia he huringa ki te ture o te ao whānui** (A change was made to international law) - Britain's blockade was controversial and challenged existing international law regarding naval warfare.



Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn't represent a consequence of the British naval blockade described in the passage.



"
Ko tehea kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te aukati moana a Ingarangi ki Tiamana?,"The correct answer is **A: I haere ki te ture o te ao whānui** (It went to international law).

Here's why:

* The passage states that Britain's naval blockade of Germany *violated* international law. Option A says Britain *followed* international law, which is the opposite of what the text claims.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Nāna i āki te riri waka ruku o Tiamana** (It provoked the German naval rage) - The passage explicitly states Britain implemented the blockade *after* Germany's naval aggression.
* **C: I haukotia e ia te rere o nga rawa Tiamana** (It cut off the flow of German supplies) - This is the core action of a naval blockade, and the passage clearly states Britain did this.
* **D: I whakarite kia kaua e whakawehia ngā kaipuke tōrangapū** (It ensured that merchant ships were not allowed to pass) - This describes the result of the blockade - preventing merchant ships from reaching their destination.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko wai e tino pai ai te tātaitanga o te Sclerosis Maha?","The correct answer is **A: He wāhine 32 tau te pakeke**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Ko MS tētahi tahumaero e pā ana ki te pūnaha ioio matua... Ko te rangahau ko te tupono kia pāngia te wahine e te MS e rua whakareatanga ki tā te tāne.""

This translates to: ""MS is a disorder of the central nervous system... Research indicates that women with MS are twice as likely to be affected as men.""

Therefore, the question asks who is *most likely* to be affected.  A 32-year-old woman aligns with this information, while the other options are men or significantly younger.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hiahiatia ana e ngā kaiuru i roto i ngā ngohe auau he tautoko anō mō te aha?","The correct answer is **D: Wehi (Isolation)**.

The passage states: ""Ngā hunga e whai wāhi ana ki te oi auau ka nui ake te tautoko ka hiahiatia e pā ana ki te tirohanga kino o te mamae me te whakawehe i ngā rerekētanga o te mamae me te manawarau wā-roa i te nekehanga ā-tinana noa."" This translates to: ""Those who participate in peer support will need more support regarding the negative perception of pain and the differentiation between pain and prolonged discomfort with simple physical movement.""  This implies that peer support helps combat feelings of isolation.  They need help navigating the emotional and physical changes, which can lead to feeling isolated.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te kitenga tōraro o te mamae (Pain recognition):** While important, the passage focuses on the *perception* and *differentiation* of pain, not just recognizing its presence.
*   **B: Te tuarā o raro (Lower back pain):** The passage is about pain in general, not specifically lower back pain.
*   **C: Pēhitanga (Panic):** While anxiety and panic can be associated with chronic pain, the passage highlights the broader issue of negative perception and isolation.

Therefore, **Wehi (Isolation)** is the best fit based on the provided passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te tākaro o te taiapa?","The correct answer is **D: I roto i tētahi hōputu duel**.

The passage describes fencing as a sport where ""tētahi fencer e whawhai ana ki tētahi atu"" which translates to ""one fencer fighting against another"". This indicates a duel or one-on-one competition. While fencing can be practiced at various levels (universities, Olympics), the core of the sport described is the duel format.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te tohu tino kaha o te mate paitini o roto?","The correct answer is **B: ruaki me te werawera**.

The passage states: ""Ko te tohu pai rawa o te paihana ā-roto ko te noho ki reira a tētahi ipu tuwhera o te rongoā, o ngā matū ā-whare tāoke rānei. Tirohia te tapanga mō ngā tohutohu āwhina tuatahi mō taua paihana motuhake.""

It also mentions: ""Ko ngā tohu mate, pēnei i te ruaki he noa te āhua kia kore e taea te whakatau māuiui i taua wā tonu."" (Symptoms of illness, such as a rash, are often nonspecific and cannot be definitively diagnosed at that time.)

Therefore, the key indicator of internal bleeding is a rash *and* fever.  The other options are not explicitly mentioned as the strongest indicators in the provided text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te hipanga tuatahi tika ina arotake ana i tētahi tūkino?","The correct answer is **A: Tirohia te tirohanga (Check the surroundings)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hei Tiro Tiro ki te parurenga, i te tuatahi me tiro koe ki te wāhi kia whakarite ka haumaru koe."" This translates to ""When approaching a scene, first check the area to ensure your safety.""
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaatu i te tukanga o te tirotiro i te patunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Kaua e māharahara ki te tautāwhi i ō ake mate (Don't forget to support your own life)**.

Here's why:

* The initial statement emphasizes **safety and assessing the situation** *before* attempting to help. Option A focuses on self-preservation, which is important, but doesn't directly relate to the *process of assessing the injury* itself. It's about personal safety, not the step-by-step evaluation.

The other options *do* relate to assessing the injury:

* **B: Ka tohu i te tirohanga i mua i te tūkinotanga (Look at the scene before approaching)** - This is crucial for safety and understanding the situation.
* **C: Tirohia te waahi o te patunga (Check the location of the injury)** -  This is a fundamental part of assessing the injury.
* **D: Me ngana ki te pānui i ētahi kara Whero (Attempt to call emergency services)** - This is an important step in ensuring appropriate help arrives.

Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't describe a step in the process of evaluating an injury.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā huringa i puta mai i te French Revolution i whai pānga nui ki ngā tāngata mahi?,"The answer is **B: He neke arotahi mai i te karaehe ki te māiatanga (A shift from monarchy to democracy)**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text focuses on the shift towards self-governance and collective power.** This aligns directly with the core principle of a revolution moving away from a monarchy (rule by a single person) towards a system where the people hold power (democracy).  The text mentions ""noho hei mana motuhake"" (to live as sovereign) and ""mana whenua ehara nā te tangata kotahi"" (sovereignty is not from one person).
* **Option A (Te nui ake o te tautoko mō te iwi - Greater support for the people)** is a consequence *of* the shift to democracy, but not the fundamental change itself.
* **Option C (He whakatamarikitanga o te ariā o te Pākehā - A standardization of European culture)** is not a primary outcome of the French Revolution, though it did have some influence.
* **Option D (He pūnaha ine hōu - A new system of measurement)** is not a central theme in the provided text about societal and political change.

Therefore, the most significant change stemming from the French Revolution that impacted people was the move away from monarchy and towards a democratic system.



"
"I muri i te French Revolution, he iti ake te tūponotanga o te angitu i roto i te ope taua me ētahi atu mahi i runga i te aha?","The correct answer is **D: Kaliber**.

Here's why:

The provided text discusses the shift towards meritocracy and skill-based advancement in various areas, including the military, after significant societal changes (like the Treaty of Waitangi and the New Zealand Wars). It specifically mentions that the military began prioritizing skill and ability (""matatau"") over social standing (""karangatanga"").

The question asks about what *decreased* the success of soldiers and other endeavors *after* the French Revolution.  The text implies a shift *away* from a system where skill was paramount. Therefore, the answer must relate to a factor that reduced the importance or effectiveness of skill.

While the other options have some relevance, **Kaliber** (caliber) fits best within this context. ""Kaliber"" can refer to a person's abilities, aptitude, or proficiency.  After the French Revolution, and following the example of prioritizing merit in New Zealand, the *reliance* on raw talent and skill (kaliber) may have been perceived as less important or sufficient compared to other factors.  The text doesn't explicitly mention the French Revolution, but the general theme of societal shifts and changes in how success is defined aligns with the broader implications of the French Revolution's impact on military and societal structures.



"
Ko tehea te mahi tūmatanui e kiia ana ko te mea nui rawa o te riri i roto i nga whenua whakawhanake?,"The correct answer is **A: Kounga wai (Water Quality)**.

Here's why:

* **The first paragraph** discusses pollution affecting water systems and the challenges of monitoring it, especially in developed countries. It mentions pollution impacting water quality for drinking and irrigation.
* **The second question** asks about the *biggest* societal impact of pollution in developing nations.  Water quality is a fundamental need and a major concern in developing countries. Poor water quality leads to disease, health problems, and significantly impacts economic productivity.  While the other options are relevant to pollution, water quality often has the most immediate and widespread effect.

Therefore, the text strongly implies that water quality is the most significant societal impact of pollution in developing nations.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te kōrero mo nga pūnaha whakawhiti tūmatanui?","The correct answer is **A: E arohaina ana e te katoa e whakamahi ana i a rātau** (They are cared for by everyone who uses them).

Here's why:

The text states that ""Ka whai wāhi atu te katoa ki ngā pūnaha mauranga"" which translates to ""Everyone participates in knowledge systems.""  The following sentence talks about pollution and its effects on these systems. Therefore, the question about wastewater systems naturally follows with a statement about who cares for them. The most logical connection is that those who *use* the systems are responsible for caring for them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kaore rātau i te kino ki te kounga o te wai** (They are not bad for water quality): The text explicitly discusses pollution and its negative impact on water quality.
* **C: He maha ngā amuamu o te hunga e whakamahi ana i a rātau** (There are many pollutants from those who use them): While pollution is mentioned, the text doesn't focus on the *quantity* of pollutants, but rather their presence and effect.
* **D: E wātea ana rātau i te nuinga o nga whenua tipua** (They are common in most developed countries):  The text doesn't specify where wastewater systems are common.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he uaua ki te ine nā te kore āheitanga o ngā atekōkiri?","The correct answer is **D: Rere Waka (Traffic Flow)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""E pōuri ana, he uaua te rangahau i te rere o ngā waka nā te mea e kore e taea te matapae i te whanonga taraiwa ki te mōhiotanga kotahi-rau ōrau."" (It is difficult to study traffic flow because it is not possible to predict the behavior of individual drivers based on 100% certainty.)

The passage goes on to say that traffic flow is variable and complex, making precise mathematical modeling difficult. The other options (speed, acceleration, road design) are not mentioned as being particularly difficult to measure due to a lack of predictable driver behavior.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakamahia ana ina whakaatu ana i tētahi rerenga waka i runga i te pāngarau?,"The correct answer is **A: Mahinga huarahi (Highway Design)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the relationships between flow, density, and speed are used to **""whakamahere, te hoahoa, me te mahi i ngā hanganga taha huarahi""** which translates to ""manage, design, and operate highways.""  This directly points to highway design as the application of this mathematical representation of traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: whanonga atekōkiri (Behavioral Patterns):** While the passage mentions the variability of driver behavior, the core focus is on the *measurable* relationships (flow, density, speed) used for mathematical modeling, not the patterns themselves.
* **C: hoahoa huarahi (Highway Construction):**  Construction is a part of the overall process, but the relationships (flow, density, speed) are used *before* and *during* design, not just at the construction phase.
* **D: kiato o nga waka (Types of Vehicles):** The passage acknowledges different vehicle types, but the relationships are about *flow* regardless of the specific vehicle.

Therefore, **highway design** is the most accurate answer.
"
He aha te mea i whakamahia e Hershey rāua ko Chase hei tāuru i tō rāua DNA? ,"The correct answer is **C: Sulfur Reo Irirangi**.

Here's why:

* **Hershey and Chase used radioactive sulfur and phosphorus** to track the movement of DNA and protein during bacteriophage infection. 
* **Phosphorus** is a component of DNA, and **sulfur** is a component of protein.
* By labeling the DNA with phosphorus and the protein with sulfur, they could determine which molecule entered the bacterial cell. Since only the DNA entered, they concluded that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā āwhā Reo Irirangi (Radioactive isotopes)** - While they used radioactive isotopes, this is too broad. Sulfur and phosphorus were the specific isotopes.
* **B: Rawa iranga (Amino acids)** - Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, not DNA.
* **D: huaketo (Bacteriophage)** - Bacteriophages are viruses that infect bacteria. They weren't used to *tag* the DNA. They were the host cells being infected.



"
E whakawhirinaki ana ki te aha te kaha o te huringa ki te tuku ki te uri?,"The correct answer is **C: Te momo irakētanga (The type of infection)**.

Here's why:

* **The first paragraph** states that different types of infections have different ways of causing illness, and that the *type of infection* itself can determine the symptoms. It mentions everything from mild issues to serious diseases like pneumonia.

* **The question asks** what the *change* in infection strength conveys to offspring. 

* **Option C** directly addresses this. The *type* of infection (whether it's a virus, bacteria, fungus, etc.) is the key factor influencing how it will impact the offspring, which is what the question is getting at.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mēnā he rārangi-ā-rārangi ngā pūtau (If the ranks of the sufferers are hierarchical):** The paragraph doesn't mention hierarchies or ranking of sufferers.
* **B: Te tikanga o te rawa iranga (The principle of desirable resources):** This is unrelated to the topic of infection transmission.
* **D: Mēnā ka taea e te irakētanga te mate pūtau (If the infection can cause pneumonia):** While pneumonia is mentioned as a *possible* outcome, it's not the core factor the paragraph emphasizes regarding what's conveyed to offspring.  The *type* of infection is the more fundamental aspect.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i hoatu i roto i te wāhanga nei, he aha te kore e whakawhirinaki ki ngā pānga rerekē o ngā huringa?","The correct answer is **D: Te momo irakētanga pāngia (The type of affected parasite)**.

Here's why:

* The first statement of the question explicitly states that the *type of parasite* (ira) that has infected someone determines the symptoms and the potential severity of the illness. It mentions different types of parasites causing different effects, from mild to severe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He aha te nui o te rauemi iranga e pā ana (What is the amount of required resources?)**  The text doesn't mention resource requirements.
* **B: Mēnā he rārangi-ā-rārangi ngā pūtau pāngia (If the affected individuals are hierarchical?)** The text doesn't discuss social hierarchy or its impact on parasite effects.
* **C: Te tikanga o te rawa iranga pāngia (The mode of entry of the affected parasite)** While the mode of entry is important for infection, the primary factor influencing the *different* effects described in the text is the *type* of parasite itself.



Therefore, the text clearly emphasizes that the *type of parasite* is the key factor determining the range of symptoms and severity."
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te take i mau ai ngā iwi o mua i ngā koati?,"The correct answer is **D: I tukua e rātau he urunga ki te miraka (They offered a sacrifice to the gods)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ancient cultures and tribes in the Zagros Mountains practiced rituals related to mountains, storms, lightning, and volcanoes.  The passage specifically mentions that the coats were sent to a sacred peak in the mountains and among the rocks, and that the children were welcomed there, similar to the Hebrew tradition.  This implies a ritualistic offering or sacrifice was involved.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I tukua e rātau he āheitanga ki te mīti (They offered a gift to the gods):** While ""āheitanga"" can mean a gift, the passage emphasizes the *sending* of the coats to a sacred place, not just offering a gift in general. The more specific context points towards a ritual.
* **B: I āwhina rātau ki te graze i te whenua (They helped to graze the land):** This is completely unrelated to the passage's description of rituals and mountains.
* **C: I tukuna e rātau he hoa (They sent a friend):**  This is highly improbable in the context of ancient rituals and offers no connection to the passage's narrative.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided passage.



"
Ko te whāinga o te korowha ko te tango i te iti rawa o te aha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā pōro (The pellets)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the game involves players using pellets to defeat enemies in dungeons. The goal is to clear the dungeon with the fewest pellets possible to win. Therefore, the objective is to minimize the number of pellets used.
"
"I runga i te papa korowha, kei hea te tapahi i te tarutaru?","The correct answer is **B: Kei runga i te kākāriki** (On the grass).

The text states: ""Ko te kēmu ka tākina ki runga i te whenua, ā, he pōtehe ake te otaota kei te kōhao, ko te kākāriki te ingoa."" This translates to: ""The game is played on the ground, and the grass is the name of the area where the goal is.""
"
He aha te whāinga o tētahi whakamātautau?,"The correct answer is **A: Hei whakakore i tētahi, neke atu rānei o ngā ariā pea**.

Here's why:

* The text states that a test (whakamātautau) is used to ""whakakore i te whakapae kotahi, neke atu rānei ka taea"" which translates to ""to refute one, or several hypotheses"". 

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Hei whakaaro me pēhea te mahi a te ao:** While understanding how the world works *is* a goal of science, this isn't the *direct* purpose of a test. Tests are specifically for testing hypotheses.
* **C: Hei pātai:** Tests don't *pose* questions; they *test* answers (hypotheses) to questions.
* **D: Hei ārahi i te rangahau pūtaiao:** Tests are a *tool* used to guide scientific research, but their primary aim is to validate or invalidate hypotheses.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te kore e āwhina ki te ārahi i te rangahau pūtaiao?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te tikanga pūtaiao anake (Scientific dogma alone)**.

The passage states that scientific dogma alone is *not* sufficient to guide scientific research. It needs to be supplemented by other methods like experimentation, questioning, and refinement. Therefore, the passage implies that relying *only* on scientific dogma is not helpful.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te kite (Observing)** - Observing *is* mentioned as a part of the scientific method.
* **C: E whakaiti ana i ngā tinihanga ka taea te whakakore (Reduces the complexities that can be explored)** - This is the opposite of what the passage implies. Scientific dogma could *limit* the exploration of complexities.
* **D: Whakahaere whakamātautau (Experimentation)** - Experimentation *is* mentioned as a method used to refine research.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero mo nga āwhiowhio ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **C: Neke atu i te toru haora te nuinga o nga āwhiowhio**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Neke atu i te toru hāora ngā āwhawhiowhio kaha rawa atu e rērere ana."" This means *strong* tornadoes can last *more than* three hours.
* Option C says ""Neke atu i te toru haora te nuinga o nga āwhiowhio"" which translates to ""Most tornadoes last more than three hours."" This is directly contradicted by the passage.
* The other options are supported by the text:
    * **A:** The passage describes tornadoes destroying buildings, lifting cars, and uprooting trees, implying they are capable of significant destruction.
    * **B:** The passage states that tornadoes occur in ""tētahi wāhi iti noa nei"" (a small area) but cause widespread damage, indicating they can be localized.
    * **D:** The passage mentions wind speeds reaching 480 km/h (300 mph), confirming that some tornadoes can reach that speed.



"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tino tika ana te whakaahua i te nuinga o ngā hau?","The correct answer is **B: Ka waihangahia e rātau he hau e pā ana ki te 480 maero i te haora.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Kei ēnei āwhā rahi rawa ngā hau tae atu ki te 480 km/h (133 m/s); 300m/h)."" This directly confirms that the winds can reach speeds of 480 km/h.
* Option B reflects this specific speed mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te nuinga o te wā ka roa ake i te toru haora:** The text states the strong winds last *more than* three hours, not that they last most of the time.
* **C: He nui ake ngā wāhi e pā ana ki a rātau i ētahi atu tupuhi:** The text doesn't provide information about where these winds are most prevalent compared to other storms.
* **D: Ka taea e rātau te hutia ngā rākau i te whenua:** The text states the winds *do* uproot trees (""ka hutia ngā rākau""), but the question asks which statement *best* depicts the majority of the wind speeds. While uprooting trees is an effect, it doesn't directly address the speed of the wind.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea i tīmata te tangata ki te mahi i te rau tau 16?,"The correct answer is **D: Hanga whātata (Making paper)**.

The passage states: ""Heoi anō, i hangaia ngā karu whātata tūturu tuatahi ki Ūropi i te mutunga o te rautau tua 16."" (However, the first durable paper was made in Europe at the end of the 17th century.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whakamahi arotahi (Using telescopes)** - Telescopes were used *before* the 17th century.
* **B: Whakarahi ana i ngā ahanoa (Using compasses)** - Compasses were used long before the 17th century.
* **C: Hanga arotahi ana (Making telescopes)** - Telescopes weren't made until *after* the 17th century.



"
Kua pehea te roa o te whakamahinga o te tangata i te whakarahi i ngā ahanoa mā te whakamahi i ngā karu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kotahi mano nga tau (One thousand years)**.

The passage states: ""Kua hangaia, kua whakamahia hoki e te tangata ngā arotahi mō te whakarahi mō te tini mano tau. Heoi anō, i hangaia ngā karu whātata tūturu tuatahi ki Ūropi i te mutunga o te rautau tua 16.""

This translates to: ""Humans have been using tools for preservation for thousands of years. However, the first hard-shelled containers were created in Europe at the end of the 17th century.""

Therefore, humans have been using tools for preservation for **thousands of years**, and the use of containers (like those made in the 17th century) is a more recent development within that much longer period.  ""Kotahi mano nga tau"" (one thousand years) is the closest and most accurate answer reflecting the long history of preservation practices.
"
"I runga i te waahanga, he aha te korero a te ana o Muhammad mo ana mahi wairua, tikanga ranei?","The best answer is **A: E uara ana a ia ki te rangimārie me te taratahitanga.**

Here's why:

* The passage describes Muhammad retreating to a cave (""Hira"") on Mount Noor to *contemplate* (""āta whakaaro""). Contemplation is closely linked to seeking peace and solitude.
* The description of the cave being remote, difficult to find, and sparsely populated further emphasizes the desire for peace and quiet.
* The phrase ""ka tomo atu ana ki te ana, he mohoaotanga katoa"" (he went to the cave with ease) suggests a natural inclination towards this peaceful state.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ka āwhina te haruru o waho ki te whakaaroaro:** The passage doesn't mention external sounds aiding his contemplation. In fact, it describes the cave as being far removed from the noise of the world.
* **C: He iti noa iho te wā e hiahiatia ana e ia:**  The passage doesn't provide information about how long he stayed in the cave.
* **D: I hiahia a ia kia kitea, kia rangona rānei mai i roto i te ana:** The cave is described as difficult to find and sparsely populated. The passage suggests he sought *seclusion*, not publicity.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te rino i whakamahia mo te tuatahi?","The correct answer is **C: Wīra**.

The passage states: ""Tāria te wā, i whakakapia ngā wīra rākau ki ngā wīra rino."" This translates to ""Over time, wooden spokes were replaced with iron spokes.""  The passage goes on to say that this led to the first steamboats being entirely iron.

Therefore, the iron was used for the **wīra** (spokes) of the boats.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha i whakakapia ai nga wīra rākau e nga wīra rino?","The correct answer is **D: I te mau rātau i te rino i runga i nga ara**

The passage states: ""Tāria te wā, i whakakapia ngā wīra rākau ki ngā wīra rino."" This translates to ""Over time, the wooden wires were replaced with steel wires."" The passage then goes on to say that this change was driven by the need for more tension on the rails. Therefore, the steel wires were used to hold the rails in place with greater tension.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āhua o te tangata i te wā o te Romanticism?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā Ture**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ki te horopaki o te Romanticism, nā te takotoranga papa te tangata i aweawe..."" This translates to ""In the worldview of Romanticism, **man's spirit** was awe-inspiring...""  Therefore, the passage is talking about the **spirit** or **nature** of humanity.  ""Ngā Ture"" means ""laws.""  The passage doesn't focus on laws.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Papawhenua (Land/Nation):** While Romanticism did have a strong connection to national identity, the passage doesn't focus on the land or nation specifically.
* **C: Ngā Ritenga (Customs/Traditions):**  The passage mentions customs and traditions being linked to the romantic worldview, but it's more about how they *reflected* the awe-inspiring nature of humanity, not the nature of humanity itself.
* **D: Ahurea (Culture):** Culture is a broad term. While related, the core focus is on the *nature of the individual*, particularly their spirit.

Ko tēhea o ngā kīanga e whai ake nei e kore e whakaata i tētahi ariā whānui o te whakatau hangarau? ,"The correct answer is **B: Kāore te ahurea e whakaawe i te whanaketanga o te hangarau (Culture does not shape the development of technology)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that technological determinism posits the *opposite*: that culture *does* shape the development of technology. Option B directly contradicts this core idea of technological determinism.

Let's look at why the other options *are* aligned with technological determinism (or at least aspects of it):

* **A: Ko ngā pānga o te hangarau ki te hapori he āhuatanga pāpori (The impacts of technology on society are a societal feature):** This aligns with the idea that technology has a strong, internal impact on society (as described in the text).
* **C: He pānga tūturu tō te hangarau ki te iwi (Technology has a profound impact on the people):**  The text argues technology *does* have a profound and often predetermined impact on people, driving change.
* **D: Kāore te whanaketanga hangarau e hāngai ana ki te mana tōrangapū (Technological development is not related to sovereignty):** While the text uses sovereignty as an example of a cultural value, the core of technological determinism is that technological development is driven by internal logic, not necessarily external factors like sovereignty. Option D, though perhaps a slightly weaker fit than the others, isn't directly *contradicted* by the text's core arguments.



Therefore, option B is the only one that directly challenges the central tenets of the technological determinism described in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te pāhono ki te tō i te kopere?","The correct answer is **C: He oro kaha ake**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I te nuinga o te wā ka puta te oro māriri ake i tētahi kōpere-ki runga, kei kaha ake, rīrā ake ana te kōpere-ki raro."" This translates to ""In most cases, a crackling sound will be produced by an upward press, the downward press will be stronger, and will vibrate more."" Therefore, a ""stronger sound"" is *associated with* the downward press, not something that's *not* related to the press.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: He oro ngohengohe ake** (A crackling sound) - The passage mentions a crackling sound is produced.
*   **B: He tohu e āhua nei he tēpara** (A mark that is shaped like a rectangle) - The passage explicitly states the ""mark upward"" is a rectangle.
*   **D: Tīmata ana i te poroka** (Starts in the palm) - The passage explains the downward press starts in the palm.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e pāhono ana ki te oro mārire ake?","The correct answer is **A: He tohu kopere whakararo (A parallel cord signal)**.

The text states: ""I te nuinga o te wā ka puta te oro māriri ake i tētahi kōpere-ki- runga, kei kaha ake, rīrā ake ana te kōpere-ki-rangi."" This translates to ""In most cases, a quieter sound occurs with a parallel cord signal, which is weaker, more muffled.""

Therefore, a parallel cord signal (he tohu kopere whakararo) produces the quieter sound.
"
E whakaatu ana ngā kōhatu i ngā ringa i te mutunga ka huri hei whakamahi i te nuinga mō te aha?,"The correct answer is **A: Māwhai**.

The passage states that early hominids didn't use their hands for climbing, lifting, or reaching for trees. It then describes the hand structure of humans as being adapted for grasping, similar to a chimpanzee's hand used for walking. The passage also mentions the evolution of the wrist bones indicating a shift from gripping to power grip. Therefore, the hand evolved primarily for **grasping (māwhai)**.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e tino whakaahua ana i ngā kōhao o te chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **B: He rerekē te rahi o ō rātou ringa me ō rātou waewae.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te rahinga o te ringa me te waewae o te Chimpanzee, e ataata nei ko te whakamahinga o te ringa hei kawe i te taumaha mō te hīkoi i ngā matimati. Ko poto iho te ringa tangata i te waewae, me ngā phalanges tōtika ake.""

This clearly highlights the difference in size and structure between chimpanzee hands and feet. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage doesn't emphasize that chimpanzees are more like humans, use their hands for food, or use their hands for grooming, respectively. The key point is the difference in the hand and foot's relative size.



"
Ka tangohia e te tīpakonga ngā rerekētanga iranga hou mai i tēhea puna?,"The correct answer is **D: whakapuakina (reproduction)**.

The passage states: ""Mā te irakē e tāpiri te rerenga ira hou..."" which translates to ""New generations are added by reproduction...""  Therefore, the source of new generations is reproduction (whakapuakina).
"
He aha te tukanga e whai mana ana ki te tāpiri i te rerekētanga iranga?,"The correct answer is **C: irakētanga (mitosis)**.

The passage states: ""Mā te irakē e tāpiri te rerenga ira hou..."" which translates to ""Mitosis adds new generations of cells...""  Mitosis is the process of cell division that creates two genetically identical daughter cells. This is how the population of cells increases.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakangao (growth)**: Growth is a general increase in size, not specifically the process of cell multiplication.
*   **B: pahekotanga (mutation)**: Mutation is a change in the genetic material, which *introduces* variation, but it doesn't directly add new *generations* of cells. It's a source of variation, not the mechanism of increasing cell numbers.
*   **D: whakapuakina (apoptosis)**: Apoptosis is programmed cell death, which removes cells, not adds them."
"I runga anō i te mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ēnei e tika ana kia kai te primate hei whakaoti i tētahi raruraru “raruraru pūmua”?","The correct answer is **B: Raw legumes**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te hua o te rākau e tino wātea ana ko ngā pūmua kei roto i ngā rau me ngā rākau pī, heoi he uaua mō ngā whāngote waewae-rua pēnei i a tātou te nakunaku i ēnei kai ki te kore e tunua.""  This translates to: ""The most valuable product of the tree is the seeds within the leaves and pods, but it is difficult for primates like us to digest these foods without preparation.""

Legumes (raw) contain high levels of protein and amino acids, but also have compounds that make them difficult to digest without processing.  The passage explicitly mentions the difficulty in digesting seeds (which are often found within leaves and pods) *without preparation*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā rau mate (Dead leaves):** While primates might eat dead leaves for some nutrients, the passage focuses on *valuable* products like seeds and the difficulty in digesting them. Dead leaves aren't highlighted as a problematic ""raruraru pūmua"" (seed riddle).
* **C: Nga mawhitiwhiti (Fruits):** The passage doesn't mention fruits as a primary source of the ""raruraru pūmua.""
* **D: Ngā tātā putiputi (Flower stamens):** The passage makes no mention of flower stamens.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā raruraru e whai ake nei kāore i te puta mai i te kore o ngā waikawa amino hira?","The correct answer is **C: tupu pōhara (famine)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a lack of amino acids in the soil leads to:

*   **Reduced crop yields:** ""ka pēhia te tipunga"" (the crop will be diminished)
*   **Poor quality of crops:** ""ka ngoikore te taikaha"" (the taste will be poor)
*   **Loss of harvests:** ""ā, nā wai rā ka hemo"" (and then who will be able to store?)

These all relate to problems with *producing* and *storing* food, but not directly to famine. Famine is the *result* of a prolonged lack of food, not the initial problem caused by amino acid deficiency.

Let's look at why the other options are connected:

*   **A: Ngā raruraru o te whangai (problems of harvest):** This is directly linked to reduced crop yields and poor quality, as stated in the passage.
*   **B: Te mate o te kai (food poisoning):** While not explicitly stated as *food poisoning*, the passage does mention that the reduced quality of crops can impact health, potentially leading to illness. 
*   **D: Mate (disease):** The passage connects the lack of nutrients to general health problems, so disease is a plausible outcome.



Therefore, famine is the least direct consequence of the amino acid deficiency described in the passage.

Me pēhea te tikanga o ngā mema o tētahi ahurea iti ki te tohu i tō rātou hononga ki taua rōpū?,"The correct answer is **A: Mā te ngana ki te whakaranu ki**.

Here's why:

The passage states that cultural groups develop their own forms of identity, often linked to shared experiences of marginalization.  It also says that members signal their belonging through distinct uses of language, behavior, style, etc.  ""Mā te ngana ki te whakaranu ki"" (By striving for assimilation) implies an effort to adopt and internalize the cultural norms and practices of the group, which is a key way of signifying belonging within a cultural group.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Mā te tango i ngā whakapono o te katoa e karapoti ana i a rātau** (By adopting the beliefs of all those marginalized with them) - While sharing beliefs *can* contribute to a sense of belonging, it's not the primary or defining way groups signal their identity. The passage emphasizes *how* they signal identity (language, behavior).
* **C: Mā te whakaae ki ngā tikanga pāpori** (By agreeing to societal norms) - This is too broad.  Marginalized cultural groups often *resist* societal norms, not embrace them.  The passage links identity to *different* forms of expression.
* **D: Mā te whakamahi i te kāhua hei momo tohu** (By using clothing as a form of sign) - While clothing *can* be a marker of identity, the passage suggests identity is communicated through a wider range of cultural expressions, not solely clothing.

"E ai ki te ariā e whakaaturia ana i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te mea ka tupu ki te tamaiti e tohu ana ki te iwi iti e whakaarohia ana mo te mahi i te whanonga whakawehi?","The correct answer is **A: Ka ngana te tamaiti ki te karo i te mahi whakawehi (The child will try to avoid behaving in a way that causes shame)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children's perceptions of people and stereotypes influence their behavior. It then provides an example: children from minority groups who are not performing well in school often perform better when they are aware of the solidarity of their iwi (tribe/people).

This implies that the children are trying to avoid negative judgment or ""whakawhero"" (shame/disgrace) by aligning their behavior with the expectations or values of their iwi.  Therefore, they would try to avoid behaviors that could bring shame upon them or their community.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ka nui ake pea te tūponotanga o te tamaiti ki te whanonga whakawehi (The child's propensity for shameful behavior may increase):**  The passage suggests the opposite - the child *tries to avoid* shameful behavior.
* **C: Ka whakakahore te tamaiti i ngā āhuatanga pāpori (The child will reject social aspects):** The passage doesn't say anything about rejecting social aspects; it focuses on behavior within a social context (school).
* **D: Ka whakakahore te tamaiti ki te mahi tahi me ētahi atu iwi iti (The child will refuse to work with other minority groups):** The passage emphasizes solidarity and shared identity, not division.

"E ai ki te whārangi, ko te mōhio o te tamaiti ki ngā āhuatanga ā-iwi ka whai pānga ki tēhea o ēnei?","The correct answer is **B: to rātau whanonga**.

The passage states that children's perceptions of people and stereotypes influence their behavior. The example given directly links a child's awareness of their ethnic identity to their academic performance (behavior).

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o ēnei e kore e ōrite ki te whakatipu i tētahi tamaiti mohoao?","The answer is **B: Ngā pūkenga kōrerorero kaha (Strong communication skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how a ""kūao"" (a type of child who has experienced neglect, abuse, or lack of parental protection) often exhibits behaviors mirroring those of the abuser or the caregiver who harmed them. These behaviors include fear, lack of responsiveness, and even being ""like a wild animal."" 

Option B, ""Ngā pūkenga kōrerorero kaha (Strong communication skills),"" is the *opposite* of what the passage describes. Strong communication skills are associated with healthy caregiver-child interactions and are not linked to the behaviors of a ""kūao.""  The passage emphasizes the *lack* of healthy interactions and the resulting behavioral problems, not the presence of strong communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Noho takitahi ana (Being isolated):** The passage mentions being left alone or abandoned, which leads to the development of ""kūao"" behaviors.
*   **C: Ngā āhuatanga tārewa (Wild behaviors):**  The passage directly states that ""kūao"" behaviors can be like those of a wild animal.
*   **D: Te māharahara pāpori (Social memory/Social awareness):** The passage describes a loss of social awareness and responsiveness as part of the ""kūao"" experience.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kupu e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i te whanonga mohoao o ngā tamariki?","The best answer is **C: Ko te whanonga mohoao e tino kitea ana i roto i ngā tamariki kua herea e ō rātou mātua.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ko ētahi tamariki kūao kua herea te tangata (i te nuinga o te wā ko ō rātou ake mātua)..."" (Some feral children have been taken in (mostly by their own parents)...).
* It then directly links this to the development of feral behavior: ""...ā tēnei whakarerenga tamaiti i te pana a ngā mātua i te tino hauātanga ā-hinengaro, ā-tinana rānei a te tamaiti. Ina whakatipuria katoatia e te kararehe ehara i te tangata, ka whakaatu te tamaiti mohoao i ngā whanonga (i roto tonu i ngā here ā-kiko) kei te pērā katoa i ērā o te kararehe-tiaki ake, pērā i tana mataku, tana kore aro rānei ki te tangata."" (This taking in of the child leads to the parents' suppression of the child's mental or physical well-being. When completely raised by animals, the feral child displays (within the constraints of instinct) behaviors that are identical to those of the wild animals, such as fear, a lack of regard for humans.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ko te nuinga o te whanonga feral i takea mai i te āhuatanga ōkiko (Most feral behavior is taken from instinct):** While instinct plays a role, the passage emphasizes the *human influence* of being raised by animals.
* **B: Ko te whanonga mohoao ka puta mai i te kore o te whakahoahoa (Feral behavior arises from the lack of guardianship):** While a lack of guardianship is a factor, it doesn't fully explain the development of feral behavior as described in the passage. The passage highlights *being raised by animals* as"

Here's why:

* **The passage describes *ahuwhenua mō te hapori* (community-oriented farming) and *ahuwhenua-tiaki-ake* (sustainable farming) as focused on meeting the needs of the farmer's family and using sustainable practices.**  The key is *not* profit-driven production.

Let's break down why the other options are *not* the best fit:

* **A: Te arotahi ki te hua e tutuki ai ngā hiahia o te whānau ahuwhenua (Focusing on the produce to meet the needs of the farming family):**  This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of community-oriented and sustainable farming.
* **C: Te arotahi ki te hua nui hei utu mō ngā tikanga matatau (Focusing on large produce for payment for sustainable practices):** While it mentions sustainable practices, the emphasis on ""large produce *for payment*"" hints at a profit motive, which isn't core to the passage's definition of community-oriented farming. It's a gray area, but less aligned than option B.
* **D: E mau kākano ana ki te rohe o te kaiahuwhenua (Growing seeds within the farmer's land):** This is a characteristic of sustainable farming, especially *ahuwhenua-tiaki-ake*, emphasizing self-reliance and preserving local varieties.

**Option B, focusing on selling produce to others, directly contradicts the passage's core message.** It suggests a commercial enterprise, which is not the defining feature of the types of farming described.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whakaahua tika ana i te mahi ahuwhenua?,"The correct answer is **B: E whakamahi ana i ngā tikanga ahurei hei whakanui i ngā hua.**

Here's why:

* The passage describes ""ahuwhenua-tiaki-ake"" (sustainable agriculture) as a low-impact system that uses traditional Māori planting techniques and crop rotation to maximize yields. 
* Option B directly reflects this by stating that it uses ""tikanga ahurei"" (sustainable practices) to ""whakanui i ngā hua"" (increase yields).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He pūnaha tino rauropi (A very efficient system):** While sustainable agriculture aims for efficiency, the passage emphasizes its low-impact and ecological approach, not necessarily maximum efficiency.
* **C: Ka āhei te hunga ahuwhenua ki te tohatoha i ō rātou hua puta noa i tō rātou rohe (Farmers can sell their produce directly in their own area):** The passage doesn't mention direct selling or localized markets. It focuses on the agricultural techniques themselves.
* **D: E whakamahia tonu ana e ngā kaiahuwhenua i ētahi whenua (Farmers continue to use it in some countries):** The passage doesn't discuss the global prevalence of sustainable agriculture, only its description and application in specific contexts (like the Māori tradition).



"
Ko te haere ki tētahi whare taonga ka uru ki roto ki te momo tūruhi?,"The correct answer is **C: tāpoi ahurea**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes cultural tourism as travel to learn about history and culture. Visiting a museum directly aligns with this description, as museums are repositories of cultural artifacts and information.
* Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:
    * **A: Te tūruhi pakihi (Business tourists):** While some business travelers might visit museums, it's not the defining characteristic of their travel.
    * **B: Turuhi whakangahau (Recreational tourists):** Recreational tourism is about leisure and fun, but doesn't necessarily involve seeking cultural knowledge.
    * **D: Te tūruhi o waho (Outbound tourists):** This simply refers to tourists traveling *away* from their home country, not the *type* of tourism they're engaging in.



Therefore, visiting a museum is a classic example of **tāpoi ahurea (cultural tourism)**."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea te mea tuatahi mo te hunga haere whakangahau?","The correct answer is **A: Te whakauru ki te ahurea o te rohe.**

Here's why: The passage states that a recreational trip is about going somewhere *very different* from one's everyday work, for relaxation.  It also mentions that people travel to learn about history and culture.  Therefore, the first thing travelers should do is immerse themselves in the culture of the area they are visiting. Option B is a consequence of that immersion. Option C is not mentioned in the passage. Option D is a *result* of wanting to understand the culture, not the initial step.

He aha te mea e whakahuatia ana i roto i te wāhanga hei mea i āwhina ki te whakaiti i te wehi ki te huringa i roto i te hahi o te rohe?,"The correct answer is **A: Te maumahara ki ngā tauira angitu o te whanonga pakihi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ina arotake ana i ngā mea angitu, me te whai mōhio ki ngā mea hinga, ka hōhonu ake te kitea e ngā takitahi, e te hunga katoa e uru mai ana ngā uara, te whāinga, me ngā aronga matua o te rōpū whakahaere. **Nā te maumahara ki ngā mahinga o mua a ngā whanonga rakahinonga me ngā angitu i hua mai, i āwhina i ngā tāngata kia noho tuwhera ki ngā panoni hou me te aronga hou mā te whare karakia o tērā wāhi.**"" (When looking at successes, and gaining knowledge of achievements, the individuals, everyone who contributes values, the goal, and the main objectives of the organization, will recognize. **By remembering the past achievements of business practices and the successes that came from them, it helped people to be open to new proposals and new ideas in the temple of that time.**)

This directly links remembering past successful business practices to being open to new ideas and mitigating resistance to change. Option A captures this core idea.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Te whiwhi mōhiohio mō ngā tāngata i pānga ki te ahurea o te whakahaere** - While understanding how people are affected by organizational culture is important, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as the *means* to reduce resistance.
*   **C: Te kitenga i ngā pūmana akiaki o te whakahaere** - Recognizing the motivating"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina o te mōhio ki te hītori o tētahi?","The correct answer is **C: Te kimi i tētahi wāhi i roto i te whakahaere (To find a place within management).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ina arotake ana i ngā mea angitu, me te whai mōhio ki ngā mea hinga, ka hōhonu ake te kitea e ngā takitahi, e te hunga katoa e uru mai ana ngā uara, te whāinga, me ngā aronga matua o te rōpū whakahaere. Ina arotake ana i ngā mea angitu, me te whai mōhio ki ngā mea hinga, ka āwhina i te tangata kia mōhio ai kihea rātou taka i roto i te hītori o te whakahaeretanga.""

Translation: ""When examining successes, and knowing the achievements, individuals, those who contribute values, goals, and the main objectives of the management group, will own the vision more deeply. When examining successes, knowing the achievements, will help people understand where they fit within the history of management.""

This directly connects understanding history with understanding one's role and place within the management structure. Option C best reflects this meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te whakaiti i te wehi ki te huringa (To reduce the gap to change):** While understanding history can aid in adapting to change, it's not the primary benefit described in the passage.
*   **B: Whakakaha ana i ngā uara (To solidify values):** Understanding history *can* help solidify values, but the passage emphasizes understanding one's *place* more.
*   **D: Te whakapai ake i te whanonga pakihi (To improve business behavior):** Although historical context can inform business behavior, it's not the central point the passage makes.

Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i te huarahi whai muri o te mātauranga?,"The correct answer is **C: He pai ake ētahi huarahi ako i ētahi atu**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes that postmodern learning doesn't have a single ""right"" way to learn.** It highlights the importance of the interaction between the learner's experience and the information being presented.  This inherently suggests that different learning methods will be more effective for different individuals and different subjects.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: He pai ake ētahi wheako ako i ētahi:** While experience is valued, the prompt isn't focusing on the *value* of experience itself but rather how experience interacts with *knowledge*. This option is too simplistic.
* **B: Me arotahi te ako ki ngā mea e whakapono ana tātou ka wheako:** This is a limiting and potentially inaccurate view. Postmodernism encourages exploring things even if we don't initially *believe* we'll experience them, as the learning process can broaden our understanding.
* **D: Kāore he tino tikanga i roto i te ako:** While the prompt advocates for flexibility, saying there's *no* pattern at all is too extreme. There are still *some* learning methods that are generally more effective than others.



Therefore, **C** best reflects the postmodern idea that different learning pathways are effective for different people and situations.

Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e whakaatu tika ana i tētahi huarahi ako whai muri i te ao hou?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te mātauranga e kore pea e taea te whakamahi, he mea tika tonu kia ako.** (Knowledge may not be usable, it is still necessary to learn.)

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that postmodern learning is about the *experience* of learning - the interaction between the learner and the information. It highlights that learning is contextual and meaningful based on that experience. Option D directly contradicts this by suggesting knowledge can be learned even if it has no practical application. This clashes with the postmodern focus on relevance and experience.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: He maha ngā huarahi ako mōhiohio** (There are many ways to learn knowledge) - This aligns with the postmodern view that learning is not a one-size-fits-all process.
* **B: Me matua whakawhiwhia ētahi wheako ako ki ētahi atu** (Some learning experiences should be seriously intertwined) - This reflects the importance of connecting learning experiences to create meaning and understanding.
* **C: Ko te wheako ako e whakawhirinaki ana ki te ākonga me te mātauranga i whakaaturia** (The learning experience validates the learner and the displayed knowledge) - This perfectly encapsulates the postmodern idea that learning is about validating the individual's perspective and the information in context.

Here's why:

* **The question asks how to *correct* the sleep cycle.** The passage describes sleep inertia, the groggy feeling after waking.  The best way to overcome this is to allow yourself to wake up fully, and *then* go back to sleep.  This avoids the cycle of repeatedly waking and falling back asleep, which exacerbates the inertia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pānui mō te haora me te hawhe i mua i te hoki ki te moe:**  This is a good sleep hygiene practice, but it doesn't directly address *correcting* the sleep cycle *after* a period of wakefulness. It's preventative, not corrective.
* **C: Whakaweto ana i te pūoho i tō pō, a, ka hoki whakamuri ki te moe e rua tekau meneti ā muri ake:** This describes sleep inertia itself, not a solution to it.
* **D: Te whakaara ake ki te inu wai i te ipu i runga i tō tēpu po:** While drinking water before bed is helpful for preventing nighttime awakenings related to thirst, it doesn't address sleep inertia after waking.

Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua i te whakaware i te moe?,"The correct answer is **D: Whai muri i te whakaara, ko te whāinga kia moe anō i roto i ngā haora e rua.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes sleep inertia as a period of grogginess after waking up.**  It specifically states that it usually lasts for a short time (10-60 minutes). 
* **Option D suggests aiming to sleep for *two hours* after waking up.** This is a significantly longer timeframe than the passage describes for sleep inertia, and is not a characteristic of it.  Sleep inertia typically diminishes within that first hour or two.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Ka taea te hanga i runga anō i te biorhythm:** The passage implies that sleep inertia is a natural process related to your body's rhythms (biorhythms).
* **B: Ko te whāinga kia kore koe e tino oho:**  The passage describes the use of bright light to *reduce* grogginess and therefore aims to minimize the feeling of being overly sleepy.
* **C: Ka puta te tukanga i roto i tō wā moe noa:** The passage states that sleep inertia occurs *after* waking up, not *during* sleep.



Therefore, only option D contradicts the information presented in the passage."
"I te mea e ngana ana te roro ki te moemoea mārama i te nuinga o te wā, he aha te mea ka nui ake?","The correct answer is **D: Wā i waenga i ngā āhuatanga REM (Time spent in non-REM stages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te take matua mō tēnei āhuatanga ko te hua o ngā moemoeā mārama e whakaroa ana i te roanga o te wā i waenga i ngā āhuatanga REM.""  This directly translates to ""The main reason for this phenomenon is the result of lucid dreams lengthening the time spent in non-REM stages.""

The passage then explains that a longer time spent in non-REM stages leads to more deep sleep and less feeling tired. Therefore, the longer time in non-REM stages is the key factor.
"
Ko tehea o ngā pānga kino e whai ake nei ka pā ki te tinana i ngā moemoea mārama maha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā REMs nui ake i ia pō (Larger REM periods each night)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I runga i te hekenga iho o ngā REM ia pō, ko tēnei āhua ka tino pāngia koe te moe tūturu, ka whakarauoratia tō tinana, ka iti iho ngā wā ka pā kia raru ai."" This translates to: ""Depending on the increase in REM that night, this type will greatly affect your deep sleep, relax your body, and reduce the times you feel tired.""

Essentially, the passage links *increased* REM periods to reduced tiredness.  Therefore, if you have a lot of lucid dreams, it suggests you are experiencing *larger* REM periods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He iti ake te roa o te wā i waenganui i ngā āhua REM (Shorter intervals between REM periods):** The passage says the *increase* in REM is the problem, not a shorter interval.
* **B: Te heke o te REM ia pō (Increase in REM that night):** This is the *cause* of the issue, not a *consequence* affecting the body.
* **C: E ai ki te moemoeā lucid (According to lucid dreaming):** The passage is about lucid dreams causing problems, not the effects of lucid dreaming *itself*.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te ōritetanga o ngā kapa tuku iho me ngā kapa mariko?","The correct answer is **C: Ka pūrongo ngā kapa e rua ki tētahi rōpū whakahaere e kore e kitea.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Heoi he rerekētanga iti nei. I ētahi wā ka noho ngā mema tīma mariko hei āhuatanga whakapākanga mō tō rātou rōpū ā-kiko tata. ... Ko te """"tīma kore kitea"""" hoki tētahi wāhanga ahurei o tētahi kapa mariko. Ko te """"tīma kore kitea"""" te tīma whakahaere e noho ai hei rīpoatatanga mā ngā mema. **Ka whakatū te tīma kore kitea ngā taumata mō ia mema.**""

This indicates that both the delivery teams and the coaching teams report to an unseen administrative team (""tīma kore kitea"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E tūmanakohia ana kia mahi ngā kapa e rua i te taumata kotahi:** While they *do* operate at the same level (under the unseen team), the passage doesn't explicitly state that both teams are *expected* to operate at the *same* level of responsibility.
*   **B: He rerekē ngā taumata o te mana motuhake o ngā rōpū e rua i roto i ā rātou mahi ia rā, ia rā:** The passage suggests that while the teams have different roles, they are both ultimately reporting to the same administrative body, implying not necessarily differing levels of autonomy in their individual tasks.
*   **D: E rua ngā kapa e mahi ana i te rohe wā kotahi:** The passage doesn't explicitly state that both teams work in the same geographic area or at the same time. It only describes their reporting structure.



"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, he teka te kōrero e pā ana ki ngā rōpū tūturu me ngā rōpū tūturu?","The correct answer is **B: He maha ngā wā e mahi ana ngā rōpū mariko hei wāhi whakapā mō ngā rōpū tuku iho.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""I ētahi wā ka noho ngā mema tīma mariko hei āhuatanga whakapākanga mō tō rātou rōpū ā-kiko tata."" This directly translates to ""Sometimes, team members become a source of support for their nearby community teams.""
* **The passage also highlights:** ""i te nuinga o te wā he nui ake tō rātou tino rangatiratanga tēnā i ngā mema o ngā tīma noa..."" meaning ""most of the time, their autonomy is greater than that of the ordinary team members..."" This suggests the teams are taking on leadership roles and supporting others.
* **Option B reflects these points** by saying teams often act as support for community teams.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, he teka te kōrero e pā ana ki ngā rōpū tūturu me ngā rōpū tūturu?** The passage doesn't focus on the similarities of ""tūturu"" teams.
* **C: He iti ake te mana motuhake o ngā kapa tuku iho i ngā kapa mariko** The passage actually says the opposite, that the teams often have greater autonomy.
* **D: Ka whai hua ngā rōpū mariko i te rerekē o ngā rohe wā** While the difference in regions is mentioned, the main point isn't that teams benefit from it; it's a factor that influences their roles and leadership.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te mea e arotahi ana ki ngā ariā ihirangi?,"The correct answer is **A: E hiahia ana te hōu kia whai rawa i te pakeketanga** (The need to be new and acquire resources).

Here's why:

* **The question focuses on Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory, which are both theories of *content* needs.** Content theories deal with *what* motivates people – their basic needs and desires.

* **The other options *do* relate to content needs:**
    * **B: Me pēhea te pānga o te taiao ki ngā mahi (How does the environment affect work?):**  This touches upon needs related to a comfortable and supportive work environment, which can be tied to satisfaction.
    * **C: Ngā hiahia ā-roto (Emotional needs):** This directly addresses the emotional and psychological needs outlined in Maslow's Hierarchy (e.g., love, belonging, esteem).
    * **D: Te mārama ki ngā hiahia o te iwi (Understanding the needs of the people):**  This is fundamental to any motivation theory and is core to identifying what content needs are important.

* **Option A: E hiahia ana te hōu kia whai rawa i te pakeketanga (The need to be new and acquire resources)**, while possibly relevant to some people, isn't a primary focus of the main motivation theories mentioned (Maslow and Herzberg).  It's more aligned with basic survival and resource acquisition, which are often considered *physiological* needs (at the very bottom of Maslow's hierarchy) rather than content needs in the broader sense of motivation.  It's less central to the theories being discussed.



Therefore, option A is the least related to the core concepts of content needs addressed in the question.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te kaupapa o te ture o ngā tuatoru?,"The correct answer is **B: Te hanga ora me te pūngao i roto i tētahi whakaahua (Creating life and volume within an image)**.

Here's why:

* **The Rule of Thirds** is a compositional guideline that suggests dividing an image into nine equal parts with two horizontal and two vertical lines.  The key is to place important elements along these lines or at their intersections. This creates a more visually appealing and balanced image.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the Rule of Thirds:

* **A: Te waihanga i tētahi raina taketake mō te wāhi e taea ai te tūnga (Creating a main line for the placement)** - This refers to the lines that divide the image into thirds, guiding placement.
* **C: Te pupuri i te kaupapa ki tētahi wāhi motuhake, whai hua hoki (Keeping the subject in a specific, beneficial place)** -  The Rule of Thirds *is* about placing the subject in a beneficial spot, not necessarily a *specific* one, but relative to the lines.
* **D: Whakatū ana i te raupapa i roto i tētahi whakaahua (Placing a pattern within an image)** -  Patterns can be used effectively when following the Rule of Thirds to create visual interest.

**Option B** focuses on the technical aspects of image creation (life and volume) which are not directly related to the compositional guideline of the Rule of Thirds. It's more about the artistic skill of rendering the subject.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e whakaahua i te hōputu whakaahua 35mm?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te hōputu tino pūnoa tēnei i te ao (This lens is the most powerful in the world)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the 35mm format as a standard one, originally from film cameras.** It mentions its focal lengths (36mm width, 24mm telephoto) and the aspect ratio (3:2). 
* **Options A, B, and C are all consistent with the information provided.** Digital cameras use 35mm lenses, lenses often have different focal lengths, and the aspect ratio is mentioned as a common characteristic.
* **Option D is incorrect.** The passage doesn't suggest this is the most powerful lens in the world. It's describing a *standard* lens, not necessarily the most powerful.

Therefore, option D is the one that doesn't align with the details given in the passage.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te mea e whakapiki ana ngā kaiwhakanao i te kounga o te hanga i ngā karu, he pēhea te whakapai ake i ngā karu whakaata?","The correct answer is **C: He ōrite te kounga whakaahua o rātau ki ngā arotahi me te tawhiti arotahi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko tētahi ngoikore kē atu o ngā karaehe topa ko te kohanga nui (te tere) o te mata i te nuinga o te wā he iti ake. Nā konā he uaua te whakamahi i ngā arotahi whakatata iti te utu ki ngā āhuahanga iti te aho kore kōwhā. Ko tētahi ngoikore kē atu o ngā karaehe topa ko teitei ake te kounga o ngā mahi a ngā kaihanganga mata mō ngā hanganga mata. **Ko tēnei ka āhei ngā karaehe topa mō ngā pikitia ki tētahi momo kounga e rite ana ki ērā karaehe e hōmiromiro ana.**""

* **Translation of the key sentence:** ""Another disadvantage of high-end cameras is the small amount of sensor cropping (tele) most of the time. Therefore, it is difficult to use inexpensive zoom lenses for small projects with no budget. Another disadvantage of high-end cameras is that the quality of the work of the camera manufacturers for the camera construction is higher. **This allows high-end cameras for photos to achieve a quality similar to those cameras.**""

* **The passage directly links the high quality of the camera construction to achieving similar image quality to high-end cameras.** This means the zoom lenses (which are related to the camera's ability to capture images) are performing at a comparable quality level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He tere ake ō rātou arotahi (Their lenses are faster).** The passage implies the opposite - that the zoom lenses are *not* as fast (or good) as the high-end cameras' lenses.
* **B: He whakamahi i roto i ngā āhuatanga marama iti (Used in small bright conditions).**  The passage doesn't mention the conditions in which the lenses are used.
* **D: He iti ake te matatini o te arotahi i ngā karu matua (The lenses are less refined than the main cameras).** The passage explicitly states the lenses are *more* refined and offer comparable quality.

"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga, i te wā e pai ake ai te arotahi whakaata i te arotahi matua?","The correct answer is **A: Mēnā he mea matua te kōpae nui rawa** (If the subject is very large).

Here's why:

The text states that zoom lenses (whakatata) are needed for wider ranges of subjects than prime lenses (arotahi matua).  Specifically, it mentions that the zoom lenses are used to achieve a quality similar to that of high-end cameras used by professional photographers. This implies that zoom lenses are useful for capturing larger subjects at a good quality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mēnā e hiahia ana koe kia iti iho ngā huānga arotahi** (If you need fewer focal lengths): Prime lenses have a fixed focal length, so you don't need to change them.  Zoom lenses offer flexibility to change focal lengths.
* **C: Mēnā kāore koe e hiahia ki te whakamahi i te flash i ngā tautuhinga pōuri ake** (If you don't need to use a flash in darker shots):  The type of lens doesn't directly impact the need for a flash.
* **D: Mēnā e rapu ana koe i te uaua ake o te arotahi** (If you are looking for a more difficult lens): Zoom lenses, while versatile, aren't inherently more difficult to use than prime lenses. Prime lenses are often considered easier to master due to their simplicity.

Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e kiia he whakaahuatanga tika o te Mysticism?,"The correct answer is **A: He arotahi ki te wheako i ngā āhua rangimarie me te hari o te hinengaro (A tendency to seek experiences of calm and ecstatic states of mind)**.

Here's why:

* **Mysticism isn't *just* about seeking calm or ecstatic states.** While these states *can* be part of a mystical experience, mysticism is broader. It's about a direct, personal experience of ultimate reality, often involving a feeling of unity or oneness. Focusing *solely* on achieving calm or ecstatic states misses the deeper aim.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate descriptions of Mysticism:

* **B: E rapu ana ngā kaiārahi o te Mysticism i tētahi mōhiotanga mōhio ki tētahi pono wairua (Mystics seek knowing insight into a spiritual reality).**  This aligns with the core of mysticism - seeking direct knowledge of a spiritual truth, not just intellectual understanding.
* **C: E rapu ana nga kaiwhaiwhai o te Mysticism i te mōhiotanga o te pono wairua (Mystics seek the knowledge of spiritual truth).** Similar to B, this highlights the quest for spiritual knowledge.
* **D: Ko te aro nui ki te rapu wheako whaiaro he rite ki etahi atu momo whakapono me te karakia (A strong emphasis on seeking spiritual experiences is similar to other forms of faith and prayer).** Mysticism *does* involve seeking spiritual experiences, but it differs from other forms of faith and prayer in its emphasis on *direct, personal experience* of the divine or ultimate reality.



Therefore, option A is the least accurate description because it's too narrow and doesn't capture the broader, more profound aim of mystical seeking.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te kaupapa o te Mysticism?","The correct answer is **B: Te whai i te mātauranga mā ngā wheako o te hapori (Seeking knowledge through social experiences)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes mysticism as a pursuit of direct, personal experience and understanding of the divine, often involving practices to facilitate that experience. Option B, ""Seeking knowledge through social experiences,"" is the *opposite* of this. Mysticism focuses on *individual* experience, not on learning through social interactions.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to mysticism:

*   **A: Te rapu i te whakaaro ki te ao atua (Seeking thought about the divine world):** This aligns with the core of mysticism, which is a deep interest in the divine.
*   **C: He arotahi ki te āhua hari o te hinengaro (An explorer of the subtle nature of the mind):** Mystical practices often involve exploring the inner mind and consciousness.
*   **D: Te whai i te mōhio ki te Atua (Seeking knowledge of the God):** This directly relates to the mystical quest for understanding the divine.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, tērā pea i tīmataria he iwi ahuwhenua?","The correct answer is **C: Māori ngā tāngata o Polynesia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kātahi ka whakatū te ariā i te whakaaro i heke mai te hunga Māori i Poronīhia ki tētahi Kahupapa Nui, ā, ka tango i Aotearoa mai i ngā Moriori, me te whakatū i tētahi papori ahuwhenua.""

This translates to: ""Then a theory arose that people from Polynesia came to a Great Ancestor, and took Aotearoa from the Moriori, and established an agricultural society.""

This indicates that the Māori who arrived and established the agricultural society came from Polynesia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Moriori mai i Aotearoa** - The passage says the Moriori were *defeated* and *lost* in Aotearoa. They didn't start an agricultural society.
*   **B: Moriori mai i ngā Moutere o Chatham** - The passage says the Moriori lived on the Chatham Islands (Rēkohu). The question is about who started the agricultural society in Aotearoa.
*   **D: Māori i te tuawhenua** - This is too general. While the people who established the agricultural society were Māori, the passage specifically points to their Polynesian origin.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te rōpū i rapu i te moa ko nga tangata tuatahi o tēhea tauwāhi?","The correct answer is **B: Aotearoa**.

The passage states: ""Mō te wā roa, i te rautau 19 me te rautau 20, e whakaponotia ana ko te iwi tuatahi ki Aotearoa ko te iwi Māori, i aruaruai ai rātou te manu nui e kīa ana ko te Moa."" (For a long time, in the 19th and 20th centuries, it was believed that the first people to arrive in Aotearoa were the Māori, who hunted the large bird called the Moa.)

I roto i tehea āhuatanga ka whai hua te whakamahi i te tikanga Pureland o te origami ki te kōpaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Kei te waihangahia e te kōpaki he origami e hiahia ana ki te takai whakamuri.**

Here's why:

* **The description of Pureland origami emphasizes its single-unit restriction and the need to remember the sequence of folds.**  This makes it very unsuitable for complex, simultaneous assembly.
* **Option C directly reflects this constraint.** Pureland origami requires remembering the folds made previously, implying a need to look back and refer to the earlier steps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E pai ana te kōpaki ki te hanga i ngā takai maha i te wā kotahi** - This is the opposite of what Pureland origami is designed for.
* **B: He pūkenga mīhini arā atu anō tā te kōpaki** - Pureland origami is a manual folding technique, not a machine process.
* **D: Kotahi, e rua rānei ngā wā i whakamātauria e te kōpaki i mua i** - The passage doesn't give information about the number of times the technique was tested.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e tika te whakaahua i te Pureland origami?,"The correct answer is **B: Kāore te aratuka e whakauru ana i ngā takai whakamuri (Instructions do not include reverse steps)**.

Here's why:

* **Pureland origami** is specifically designed to be done with a single fold at a time, and has no reverse steps.  The instructions are intentionally designed this way to minimize confusion and make it accessible.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: E tika ana mō ngā kōpaki wheako (Suitable for experienced folders):** While it can be challenging, Pureland origami is often *intended* for experienced folders because of its minimalist approach and potential for complex results from simple folds.
* **C: me whai tauwāhi tika ngā kōpaki (Folds must be precise):** Precision is absolutely *crucial* in Pureland origami. Even slight inaccuracies will compound and ruin the final model.
* **D: He tikanga pai mō ngā kōpaki me ngā pūkenga nekeneke iti (A good practice for folders and those with limited dexterity):** Because of the single-fold-at-a-time nature, it's excellent for beginners and people with dexterity limitations.



Therefore, the statement that doesn't align with the core principles of Pureland origami is that instructions *don't* include reverse steps - they simply don't exist.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tauwāhi kāore i te pāhono ki te Tūmatanuitanga o te Awaawa o Indus?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā rohe katoa i Afghanistan ki te raki-māraki**.

Here's why:

The text states the Indus Valley Civilization flourished in the river valleys of the Indus River and also in areas up to the north in India and to the northwest in Afghanistan. Option C, ""Ngā rohe katoa i Afghanistan ki te raki-māraki"" (All areas in Afghanistan to the north), is *included* in the geographical range of the civilization, not excluded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Harappa:** The text mentions Harappa as the first site to be excavated and a key part of the Harappan Civilization.
* **B: Te Awa o Sarasvati (The Sarasvati River):** The text mentions the possibility that the civilization was tied to the Sarasvati River, even though it's now dried up.
* **D: Te nuinga o Pakistan i tēnei rā (Most of Pakistan today):** The text explicitly states that most of modern-day Pakistan was within the civilization's range.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuatia hei ingoa pea mō te Bronze Age Civilization e kōrerotia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **A: Te Iwi o Harappan**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions ""Indus-Sarasvati Civilization"" and ""Harappan Civilization"" as names for the same civilization.
* The other options, ""Te Whanaketanga o te Awa o Indus"" (Civilization of the Indus River) and ""Te Whanaketanga o te Raorao o Indus"" (Civilization of the Indus Valley) are valid translations of the civilization's name as used in the text.
* **Te Iwi o Harappan** (The People of Harappa) is not mentioned in the provided text as a name for the civilization. While the Harappan Civilization is a major part of it, it doesn't represent the civilization itself.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he painga roa?","The correct answer is **A: mahi tahi me ētahi atu (working together with others)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ko te tūmanako, ka whai mōhio te nuinga o ngā tāngata ko tā rātou kōwhiringa wā roa pai rawa ko te mahi ngātahi ki ētahi atu"" which translates to ""The hope is that most people understand that their best long-term plan is to work together with others."" This directly identifies working together as the best long-term plan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te manakē i ngā painga whaiaro o te tangata (Believing in the intellectual benefits of people)** - While beneficial, this isn't the *best long-term plan* according to the text.
* **C: Te whakanui i te mea e whai hua ai te tokoiti i te nuinga (Focusing on what benefits the individual most)** - This is the opposite of the text's message about collaboration.
* **D: Mā te mōhio ka whai hua pea te apo (Knowing that saving will be beneficial)** - The text discusses saving in the context of a ""apo me te matapiko"" (a store and a pot), and while saving can be beneficial, it's not presented as the *best long-term plan* in relation to collaborative efforts.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka manakē pea tētahi tangata mēnā kei runga i ngā painga inamata tō rātou arotahi?","The correct answer is **C: Mahi Tahi (Collaboration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inā rā, i ngā wā e hora ana ngā painga, ka nui ake ngā painga mēnā ko te tokoiti e matapiko nei ka ora i ēnei painga. **Ko te tūmanako, ka whai mōhio te nuinga o ngā tāngata ko tā rātou kōwhiringa wā roa pai rawa ko te mahi ngātahi ki ētahi atu.**"" 

This translates to: ""Therefore, when benefits are being accrued, the benefits will be greater if the few who are passionate survive these benefits. **The hope is that most people understand that their best long-term choices are to collaborate with others.**""

Therefore, collaboration is presented as the key to maximizing benefits and achieving long-term success. The other options aren't explicitly mentioned or implied as the primary benefit for someone on the path to greater gains.  While the other options might be *related* to collaboration, *mahi takihi* (collaboration) is the directly stated desirable path.

He aha te wā i mua i te wā o nga Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Te Moata Waenga Ake (The High Middle Ages)**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""Ko te wā i tū ai ngā mahi e kīia whānuitia ana ko ngā High Middle Ages arā te wā o te hītori Ūropi i ngā rautau 11, 12 me te 13 hoki (AD 1000-1300)."" This translates to ""The time when the activities are said to be widespread is the High Middle Ages, which is the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).""  Therefore, the period *before* the Templars was the High Middle Ages.
"
Ko tēhea wā i puta mai i muri i te pakeketanga o nga Templars?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā Pakeke o Waenganui Tiketike (Late Middle Ages)**.

The question asks what period came *after* the Templars' demise. The text states the High Middle Ages were roughly 1100-1300 AD, and the Late Middle Ages were until around 1500 AD.  The Templars' downfall occurred in the early 14th century (around 1300s), placing it firmly within the Late Middle Ages.

Therefore, the Late Middle Ages is the period that followed. Options A, B, and D are either too early (Early Middle Ages, 12th century, or 11th century respectively) or not directly related to the Templars' demise.
"
He aha te rongoā kāore i whakahuatia e whakamahia ana e nga tākuta me nga tākuta i te Emepaea o Roma?,"The correct answer is **C: Te whakaiti i te rerenga toto mā ngā kōpaki hau (Reducing blood loss with inhalant fumes)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions the Romans knew how to treat gangrene, use tourniquets, and arterial clamps to restore blood flow. It also mentions using herbs like henbane for sedatives and scopolamine.  However, it **doesn't** mention using inhalant fumes to reduce blood loss.  The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A:** The passage states they understood different herbal remedies for various ailments.
*   **B:** The passage explicitly says they used plant extracts like henbane for scopolamine.
*   **D:** While not directly stated, the passage discusses their medical advancements, suggesting they had techniques for treating multiple injuries, which could include those requiring bandaging for wounds.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i takea mai i nga kōkiri i mahia i te papa rongoā i te wā o te Emepera o Roma?","The correct answer is **C: Te whakatūnga o ngā hōhipera ako (The establishment of medical schools)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the following:

*   Doctors were first established by Emperor Augustus for military use.
*   They learned about medicinal herbs, including scopolamine.
*   They knew how to treat gangrene and use tourniquets.
*   Emperors invested in medical resources.

While the passage mentions the establishment of a medical corps (which is a type of organization) and the Emperor's involvement (which could be seen as a policy), it *doesn't* mention the establishment of medical schools.  The passage focuses on practical skills and the Emperor's investment in medical resources, but not the formal education system.

Therefore, option C is the one *not* supported by the information given in the passage."
E whakawhirinaki ana te kaha ki te kite ki te aha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā waeine o te acuity**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how bird vision is specialized for different needs. **Acuity** refers to the sharpness of vision. The passage mentions ""ngā hiahia o te rauropi"" (the needs of the bird) and how different birds have different visual adaptations, implying different levels of visual sharpness or acuity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā okana pūoko pūnaha arokite (Optical system components):** While the optical system is involved, the passage focuses on the *results* of that system – how the vision is adapted – rather than the components themselves.
* **B: Ngā whakaritenga o te rauropi (Bird requirements):**  This is too general. The passage doesn't describe *specific* requirements, but rather how vision is *adapted* to different requirements (like hunting).
* **C: He tairongotanga ki ētahi o ngā roanga ngaru (A sensitivity to certain technical ranges):** The passage mentions technical ranges (roanga-ngaru), but it's about the bird's *vision* being adapted *to* those ranges, not the sensitivity of the system to those ranges.



"
He aha te rerekētanga o te hanganga o te kanohi i waenganui i ngā rauropi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Whakaritenga o te Rauropi (The Requirements of the User)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that the design of a user interface (UI) depends heavily on the needs and requirements of the user. It mentions that there are different types of user interfaces tailored to different user needs. Therefore, understanding the user requirements is crucial for designing an effective UI.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Te aro nui ki te roangaru (Focus on the roadmap):** While a roadmap is important for development, the core of UI design's difference between users is about *their needs*, not just a planned path.
*   **C: Te taumata o te mata (The level of the eye):** Eye level might be a *consideration* in UI design, but it's not the primary differentiating factor *between users*.
*   **D: Te matatini o te rauropi (The level of the user):**  The passage doesn't specifically mention the ""level"" or ""skill"" of the user as the main differentiator of UI design. It focuses more on the *needs* and *tasks* users perform.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea korero mo te Sikhism kare i te whakaatu tika i te karakia?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te Sikhism te hua o te wehewehe ā iwi i roto i te tikanga Hindu.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""I ahu mai i te takiwā Punjab i te rautau 15 mai i tētahi whakawehenga hāhi ki roto i te hāhi Hinitū."" (It originated in the Punjab region in the 15th century from a schism within the Hindu faith.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko te kaiako he āhuatanga taketake motuhake ki te Sikhism** - The text says ""Ko te guru te tūāpapa o ngā Hāhi Inia katoa, engari ki tā te Hāhi Sikh he whāinga nui kei reira i hua mai ai ngā mātāpono o te Sikh."" (The guru is the foundation of all Indian faiths, but for the Sikh faith, there is a great emphasis on it from which the principles of Sikhism have arisen.) This shows the guru is a *distinctive* feature of Sikhism.
* **C: E iwa ngā kaiako i whai i te kaiwhakarewa o te whakapono, a Guru Nanak** - The text directly says ""E iwa ngā wānanga i whai i ana tapuwae."" (Nine successors followed in his footsteps.)
* **D: Kua ū ētahi tikanga o te Tīmatatanga ki te Hindu** - The text states ""Kua ū ētahi tikanga o te Tīmatatanga ki te Hindu"" which is a true statement.



Therefore, option A is the only one that is *not* directly supported by the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakaarotia ana he aronga uho o te pūnaha whakapono o Tīmata?","The correct answer is **A: Ko te ariā o te kaiako (The way of the guru)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ki tā te Sikh ko te Hāhi Gurmat, ki te reo Punjabi ko te """"way of the guru."""" (For the Sikh, the faith is the Way of the Guru.)""
* It also highlights that the Guru is the foundation of all Indian faiths, but holds a particularly significant place in Sikhism.
* The passage mentions that Guru Nanak established the faith and that nine successors followed his footsteps. This reinforces the importance of the Guru as a central figure and guiding principle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā tikanga Hindu (Hindu customs):** While Sikhism acknowledges some Hindu principles, the passage clarifies that it's a distinct faith.
* **C: He whakakore ki te whakaae ki ētahi atu hāhi Īnia (A rejection of other Indian faiths):** The passage indicates that Sikhs *do* honor Hindu principles, suggesting they are not entirely rejecting other faiths.
* **D: E kōrero ana i te reo Punjabi (Spoken in Punjabi):** The passage mentions the name of the faith in Punjabi, but this isn't a core tenet of the faith's belief system itself. It's about the language used to refer to it.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e uaua ai te arotahi o ngā tamariki e mate ana i te mate āta whakaaro?","The correct answer is **A: Mahi kura (Schoolwork)**.

The passage specifically states: ""Mō ngā tamariki whai ADD he uaua ki a rātou te aro ki ngā mahi kura..."" which translates to ""For children with ADD, it is difficult for them to focus on schoolwork...""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā tamariki whai Pānga Whakamate, ka uru ki ngā whanonga mōrearea?","The correct answer is **A: Hei whakaiti i te ngohe pūwerewere**.

The text states: """"E uru ana rātou ki ngā whanonga mōrearea, te whawhai me te wero i te mana"""" kia whakahihiko i ō rātou roro, i te mea e kore ō rātou roro e hihiko i ngā mea o ia rā. This indicates that they act out to try and stimulate their brains because they are easily bored and restless.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te whārangi, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te tauira o te papa?","The correct answer is **B: He kaiako SAT**.

Here's why:

* **Papa (Scaffolding)** in education refers to the temporary support structure provided to learners to help them complete a task they couldn't do independently. It's meant to be gradually removed as the learner gains competence.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of scaffolding:

* **A: He akoranga i te tīmatanga o tētahi kēmu rorohiko (A course on the basics of a video game):**  A course introducing a new video game would likely provide step-by-step instructions, tutorials, and guided practice – all scaffolding to help learners understand the game mechanics.
* **C: He hōtaka ako motuhake (A specialized curriculum):** A specialized curriculum might break down complex topics into smaller, manageable units, provide additional resources, and offer personalized support – scaffolding to help students master specialized knowledge.
* **D: He kaiako rōpū iti (A small group teacher):** A small group teacher can provide individualized attention, targeted feedback, and scaffolding techniques to help each student succeed.

* **B: He kaiako SAT (An SAT teacher):** While an SAT teacher provides valuable instruction and practice, the SAT is a standardized test designed to assess a student's existing knowledge and skills. An SAT teacher's role is primarily to help students *prepare* for the test, not to provide the kind of ongoing, task-specific scaffolding that supports learning new concepts.  The test itself isn't designed with scaffolding in mind.



Therefore, the SAT teacher is the least likely to be a direct example of scaffolding.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te ariā o te papa?,"The correct answer is **C: E mōhiotia ana hoki hei akoranga kaupapa i runga anō i te**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that scaffolding is NOT a curriculum itself.** It's a temporary support system *around* the curriculum. 
* **Options A, B, and D all align with the passage's description of scaffolding:**
    * **A: Ka taea te noho tūturu ki ngā papa** - Scaffolding can be long-term and provide sustained support.
    * **B: He nui ake te āwhina i te aratuka akoranga** - Scaffolding significantly aids in guiding the learning process.
    * **D: Ka whakamahia ngā papa hei tautoko i te tīmatanga o tētahi wheako ako** - Scaffolding supports the initial stages of a new learning experience.
* **C: E mōhiotia ana hoki hei akoranga kaupapa i runga anō i te** - This statement suggests scaffolding *is* the curriculum, which directly contradicts the passage's main point.

Therefore, option C is the only one that doesn't accurately reflect the passage's understanding of what scaffolding is.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka whai painga pea te āhuahira MySpace ki ngā ākonga e raruraru ana ki te pānui?","The correct answer is **A: Ritenga**.

The passage states: ""He māmā te tomo mai ki tēnei whārangi mā te whakarato noa i tētahi whārangi paetukutuku e māma ai te maumahara me te patopato mā ngā ākonga he raru ōna ki te whakamahi i te papatuhi rorohiko, ki te tuhituhi hoki rānei."" This translates to: ""It is easy to access this website by simply providing a website that helps students who have difficulty with memory and concentration, or with using computer software, or with writing.""  

Therefore, MySpace could benefit students who struggle with **reading** (ritenga) because it provides a user-friendly interface that aids memory and concentration, particularly for those who find reading challenging.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Rangitaki** (Graphs) - The passage doesn't mention graphs.
*   **C: Tētahi wāhitau tukutuku** (A communication tool) - While MySpace *is* a communication tool, the question is specifically about students who struggle with reading, not the general purpose of the tool.
*   **D: 54 miriona ngā kōtaha** (54 million users) - The number of users is irrelevant to the passage's main point.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te wāhanga o te urupare a Krushchev ki nga whakararuraru a te kaimahi?","The correct answer is **C: Whakanuia ngā utu (Increase wages)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states workers were protesting *low wages* and demanding better conditions. Krushchev's actions were in response to this unrest.
* **Whakatūria he pirimia hou (Appointing a new prime minister)** and **Whakamahia ngā reheke hei whakaora i te raupapa (Using the army to restore order)** were methods Krushchev used to *suppress* the worker unrest.
* **Kia mōhio ki ētahi whakaritenga ōhanga (Being aware of labor agreements)** is a general statement and doesn't directly address Krushchev's actions in response to the specific protest.  It's not a specific action *he* took to quell the workers.

Therefore, the only option that wasn't part of Krushchev's response to the worker unrest is increasing wages, as the workers were protesting *against* low wages."
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te take o nga tutu i Poland?,"The correct answer is **D: Te wāhuitanga o Wladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that workers protesting food shortages and wage cuts *shifted* their focus to challenging Communism. 
* Wladyslaw Gomulka's appointment as Prime Minister was a *result* of the protests, not a cause of them. The protests were *aimed at* the existing political system, which Gomulka later helped to change. 
* The other options – food shortages (Ngā iti kai), wage cuts (Tapahi Wage), and the desire for change (whakakahē whānui i te Communism kē) – were all driving factors *behind* the protests.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i pā ki te pānga i waenganui i te USSR me te Amerika?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā whakaaro mo Tiamana (Thoughts about Germany)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Germany's defeat *led* to the eventual split between the USSR and the US. It was a *cause* of the Cold War.
* The passage then details the Cold War's characteristics: ideological conflict, arms race, and global conflicts.
* The passage mentions the *outcome* of the Cold War - the collapse of the Soviet Union and the US maintaining dominance.

The passage emphasizes the role of the **systemic differences (pūnaha)**, **ideology (hātepe)**, and the overall **global power struggle (tautohe e pā ana ki ngā pūnaha)** in creating the Cold War. While Germany's defeat was the starting point, the passage doesn't frame *thoughts about Germany* as having a direct, ongoing impact *during* the Cold War itself. The focus is on the broader, structural issues.

Therefore, the thoughts about Germany are not directly described as having a lasting impact on the USSR-USA relationship *throughout* the Cold War, unlike the other options.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te take o te tuku i ngā pūkaha ki te tinana?,"The correct answer is **C: Kei te pupuri i te mate kāinga (Preventing blood clots)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the nervous system constantly sends signals to release nerve impulses that maintain blood flow and keep the body safe during sleep.  The other options align with this:

* **A: Rere toto pōturi (Preventing blood clots):**  Maintaining blood flow *is* a key part of preventing blood clots.
* **B: Whakahaere ana i te rere toto (Regulating blood flow):** The passage directly mentions the nervous system regulating blood flow.
* **D: Kei te karo i ngā tuma ā-tinana (Preventing physical stagnation):** Maintaining blood flow prevents physical stagnation, which is a logical consequence of the nerve impulses.

However, the passage *doesn't* mention preventing blood clots specifically. While preventing blood clots *is* a consequence of maintaining blood flow, it's not the central point the passage is making.  The core function described is maintaining overall blood flow for safety during rest. Therefore, ""Kei te pupuri i te mate kāinga"" is the least accurate description of the passage's main point.



"
He aha ka kitea i Te Giza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Nga mea whakamiharo e whitu katoa** (The three wonders together).

The passage states: ""Kei te mānia o Giza, """"Giza Necropolis"""" rānei i te Valley of the Dead o Īhipa ētahi koeko (ko te koeke rahi te mea nui rawa), ētahi toma, ētahi temepara me te Sphinx hirahira."" (The Giza plateau, also known as the ""Giza Necropolis"" in the Valley of the Dead of Egypt, contains the Great Pyramid (the most important), some obelisks, some temples and the magnificent Sphinx.)

This indicates that the Giza Plateau is home to the Great Pyramid, obelisks, temples, and the Sphinx – essentially, the three wonders of the ancient world. While the Great Pyramid is mentioned specifically, the passage implies the presence of *all* of them. Option C encompasses the broader picture presented in the text.
"
He aha te take o te Piramidi Nui?,"The correct answer is **B: Hei whakahonore i a Pharaoh**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kei te mānia o Giza, """"Giza Necropolis"""" rānei i te Valley of the Dead o Īhipa ētahi koeko (ko te koeke rahi te mea nui rawa), ētahi toma, ētahi temepara me te Sphinx hirahira. I hangaia te koeko mīharo hei whakanui i a Pharaoh Khufu..."" (In the necropolis of Giza...the great pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...).

While the pyramid is a wonder of the world (A) and is located in a burial ground (D), the primary purpose stated in the passage is to honor Pharaoh Khufu.  The passage doesn't mention it being a land marker (C).
"
Ko wai te kawenga mo to tatou mōhiotanga mo te kaiwhakatuma i whakangaro i te temepara?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The text explicitly states: ""I tuhia tēnā ingoa e te kaituhi nō Kariki, a Strabo, i mōhio ai tātou i ēnei rā."" (That name was written by the writer from Corinth, Strabo, by whom we know this day.)
"
He aha te kōrero tika e pā ana ki te hanga anō i te temepara o Aretemi?,"The correct answer is **B: I hanga anōtia i muri i te rangatiratanga o Alexander te Nui**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""I hiahia utu te kīngi, a Alexandra, i te tūnga mai anō o te temepara, engari auare ake. Nō muri mai, ka mate a Alexandra, nāwai rā, ka tū mai anō te temepara i te tau 323 BCE."" This translates to: ""The king, Alexander, demanded payment for the rebuilding of the temple, but it was not paid. Later, Alexander died, and then the temple was rebuilt in 323 BCE.""

This clearly indicates the rebuilding happened after Alexander the Great's reign. Option A is incorrect because Alexander demanded payment, but the text says he died before the rebuilding was completed. Option C is incorrect because Herostratus was responsible for the destruction and wasn't involved in the rebuilding. Option D is incorrect because the text specifies the rebuilding happened in 323 BCE.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā tata tonu ka haere te momo i runga i nga waewae e rua?","The correct answer is **D: 4,2 miriona tau ki mua**.

The passage states: ""He kitea ana ngā āhuatanga rua-waewae i roto i ngā mātātoka Australopithecus mai i ngā tau 4.2-3.9 miriona ki muri..."" (Bipedal features are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago...)

While *Sahelanthropus* is mentioned as potentially walking bipedally 6 million years ago, the first *well-documented* evidence of bipedalism in *Australopithecus* is around 4.2 million years ago.  The question asks when the *species* started walking on two legs, implying the first reliable evidence.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei momo e haere tonu ana i runga i ngā waewae e rua?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that *Homo Erectus* started walking upright consistently around two million years ago.
* *Australopithecus* had bipedalism (walking on two legs) but not consistently.
* The passage mentions *Sahelanthropus* *might* have walked upright, but it's less certain and dated further back (6 million years ago).
* The passage implies that *Australopithecus* did *not* walk upright consistently.

Therefore, *Homo Erectus* is the only option explicitly stated as having consistently walked upright.



"
He aha te mea i ngana ai te ope moana Tiamana ki te whakatutuki i te Pakanga Tuarua o te Ao?,"The correct answer is **B: Te ārai i a Britain i te whiwhi tangata me ngā taonga (To disrupt Britain's access to people and supplies)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that the German navy attempted to disrupt the flow of supplies and personnel to Britain using U-boats during World War II.  This is exactly what option B describes. The goal wasn't to simply intercept supplies (A), but to actively *disrupt* Britain's ability to receive them (B). Options C and D are incorrect as the text focuses on the Atlantic Ocean and Britain's resources, not general resource transport or targeting America.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, ko wai i tino angitu ki te pakanga moana i te wā o te pakanga ki te Raki o Atalani?","The correct answer is **C: Ko ngā Tiamana me ngā Ingarangi**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the Battle of the North Atlantic during World War II as an example.
* It mentions both the Americans transporting troops and supplies to Britain *and* the German U-boats attempting to disrupt this with sinkings.
* The passage concludes by stating that if the German U-boats had succeeded in severely disrupting the supply lines, Germany might not have been able to defeat Britain. This implies both sides were actively engaged and their successes/failures were critical.

Therefore, both the Germans and the Allies (specifically the Americans and British) played significant roles in the Battle of the North Atlantic.
"
He aha te mea i kore i te wā i whakatinanahia ai e ngā Āhiria te whakamahi i te kaieke hoiho?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Saddles**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kāore anō te nohonga hōiho i hangaia, nō reira i pakanga te karawhiri Assyrian mā runga i te tuarā ake o ō rātou hōiho.""  This translates to: ""No horse saddles were yet made, so the Assyrian cavalry fought on the backs of their horses.""

Therefore, the absence of saddles prevented the Assyrians from using horse-mounted warriors effectively. The other options (Rīpeka, Hariata, Kahupeka) are not mentioned in the passage as relevant to the Assyrian military at that time.



"
Me pēhea te whawhai i ngā pakanga e whakamahi ana i te karaka?,"The correct answer is **C: I runga hoiho (On horses)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Kāore anō te nohonga hōiho i hangaia, nō reira i pakanga te karawhiri Assyrian mā runga i te tuarā ake o ō rātou hōiho.""  This translates to: ""No horse-drawn chariots were yet built, so the Assyrian chariot fought on the backs of their horses.""

Therefore, the Assyrian chariots fought *on* horses.  Options A, B, and D are not supported by the text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kaore koe e kite i tētahi tangata whenua o Babylonian wawaenga?","The correct answer is **D: Te kawe whakahere ki te wahi tapu o roto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I ia temepara tētahi ātea temepara, ā, he whakamaurutanga ki roto ka taea anake e ngā pirihi te kuhu."" (In each temple there was a temple area, and a sanctuary inside that only priests could enter.)

Option D directly reflects this: ""Te kawe whakahere ki te wahi tapu o roto"" translates to ""Bringing offerings to the inner sacred place."" This is something only the priests were permitted to do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te kawe whakahere ki te marae o te temepara** (Bringing offerings to the temple precinct): While priests brought offerings, not *every* Babylonian would have been involved in this.
*   **B: Te haere ki tētahi huihuinga i tētahi temepara matua** (Attending a meeting in a major temple):  This could involve various people, not just priests.
*   **C: I te hakari i te marae o te temepara** (Partaking in a feast at the temple precinct): Feasts might have involved different people than just priests.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei i whakaritea mo nga tohunga?,"The correct answer is **B: whare tapu o roto (inner sanctuary)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I ia temepara tētahi ātea temepara, ā, he whakamaurutanga ki roto ka taea anake e ngā pirihi te kuhu.""  This translates to ""In each temple there was a temple area, and a sanctuary inside that only priests could enter.""

* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Huihuinga (conclaves/gatherings):** While gatherings might have occurred, the passage doesn't specifically link them to the priests.
    * **C: Ngā Whakaaturanga (offerings):** Offerings were made *to* the gods, but the sanctuary was where priests performed rituals.
    * **D: Ziggurats:** Ziggurats were temple towers, not the sanctuary itself. While important parts of the temple complex, the sanctuary was *within* the temple.



Therefore, the **whare tapu o roto (inner sanctuary)** is the place specifically designated for priests, according to the passage.



"
Nō whea i rongonui ai a Kingi Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i te kitenga o tona urupa**.

The passage states: ""Heoi, nā tāna hura i tēnei toma i te tau 1922 i rongonui ai ia."" which translates to ""However, it was his discovery of this tomb in 1922 that made him famous.""
"
He aha i hanga ai a Kingi Tutankhamun hei kingi rongonui o Ihipa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te tahae i ngā mano o ngā taonga tuku iho i tōna urupa.**

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states: ""Nā tāna hura i tēnei toma i te tau 1922 i rongonui ai ia. Inā kē he maha ngā toma o mua kua pāhuahuatia, i waiho noatia tēnei toma. Ko te nuinga o ngā taonga i nehua ki a Tutankhamun kua pai te whakauka..."" (His discovery of this tomb in 1922 made him famous. Many tombs of earlier kings had been looted, but this tomb had been left untouched. Most of the treasures found in Tutankhamun's tomb have been well preserved...).

The text emphasizes that the discovery of his relatively untouched tomb filled with treasures is what made him famous.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko te kitenga o tana urupa e kore nei e whakararuraru:** While the discovery of the tomb was important, the text highlights *what was inside* the tomb (the treasures) as the key to his fame.  ""E kore nei e whakararuraru"" means ""doesn't disturb"" - it doesn't explain *why* he became famous.
* **B: Ko tōna tūnga i runga i ngā rārangi kīngi tahito:** The text actually says he was *not* highly ranked in historical king lists, which is why his tomb was left untouched.
* **D: tōna hiranga i ngā wā o Ihipa onamata:** The text indicates he lived during the Amarna period, not the Early Dynastic period.



"
He aha te mea kihai i taea e te kaituhi Kariki a Homer?,"The correct answer is **D: Kōrero** (Tell/Narrate).

The passage states that Homer was a ""kairotarota kāpō"" (epic poet) who *told* of the two great poems, the Iliad and the Odyssey. Therefore, the answer is the ability to narrate stories.
"
Ko tehea Kariki rongonui e mōhiotia ana mō tētahi mea atu i te tuhinga?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for someone famous for something *other* than writing.** The passage mentions Homer as a famous writer.
* **Pythagoras** is specifically mentioned for his famous theory about the relationships of the numbers in harmonic intervals (music).
* **Sophocles and Aristophanes** are explicitly stated as famous *writers*.
* **Homer** is explicitly stated as a famous *writer* of the Iliad and Odyssey.



"
I hea te nuinga o te wā i noho ai te whānau Hiperu?,"The correct answer is **A: I te hau tuwhera (In the open air)**.

The text states: ""I roto i te āhuarangi mahana o te Waenga Rāwhiti, kāore i tino hirahira te whare."" This translates to ""In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not very elaborate."" It further explains that women were in the shade and men were exposed to the elements. This indicates they spent much of their time outdoors due to the climate and lack of elaborate housing.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate based on the provided text.
"
He aha te mea kihai i tino nui ki te whānau Hiperu?,"The correct answer is **A: to rātau āhuarangi** (their climate).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""I roto i te āhuarangi mahana o te Waenga Rāwhiti, kāore i tino hirahira te whare"" which translates to ""In the hot climate of the Middle East, the house was not very impressive."" This indicates the climate was a significant factor influencing their lives. The other options are mentioned but not presented as the most impactful element according to the text.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te whakaahuatia hei rerekētanga i waenganui i ngā whenua o Scandinavia?,"The correct answer is **B: Te whenua**.

The passage explicitly mentions differences in:

*   **Ngā tāngata (people)**
*   **Ngā kīngi (kings)**
*   **Ngā tikanga (customs)**
*   **Ngā hītori o Tenemāka, o Huitene, o Nōwei, o Tiorangi (the histories of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland)**

However, it states that Greenland is considered ""Scandinavian,"" implying it *is* a country, not a point of difference between them.

Therefore, the answer is **B**."
Ko wai i noho tuatahi ki Greenland?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā iwi Eskimo**.

The passage states: ""Ahakoa tāna huranga, i reira kē ngā iwi Eskimo e noho ana i taua wā."" which translates to ""Despite his exploration, the Eskimo people were living there at that time.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Norewai** - While the passage mentions Scandinavian influence, it doesn't say Norwegians were the first inhabitants.
*   **C: Erik te Whero** - Erik the Red discovered Greenland, but he wasn't the first to inhabit it.
*   **D: Ngā Tōna** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea rōpū e pai ake ana ki te kai me te kore he tūru?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā tāngata Rōmana rawakore (Poor Roman people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""tā te hunga pohara, te wahine anō hoki kai i ā rātou kai i te wā e noho ana ki ngā tūru, ko tā te tāne whai rawa he hākari tahi i a rātou e takoto ana ki ō rātou taha i a rātou e kai ana i ā rātou kai."" 

This translates to: ""For the poor, the women still ate their food while living in dormitories; the man who foraged would have a meal together with those he kept with him as they ate their own food.""

This indicates that the poorer Romans ate their food without a dormitory, sharing meals with those they were with. The other options are incorrect as they use terms like ""taonga"" (valuable/elite) or ""rawa"" (rich/well-stocked) which don't align with the passage's description of the poor.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kore e waiho hei wāhanga o te hakari o Roma o mua?,"The correct answer is **B: He kai mō ngā ngārara (Bird food)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ancient Romans *did not* have access to foods that came from the Americas or Asia, like corn, tomatoes, rice, or cocoa.  Therefore, bird food, being a more modern concept and not originating from those regions, would not have been part of their diet.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible:

*   **A: Ko ngā manuhiri rawakore e kai ana i ngā tūru (Poor guests eating at the tables)** - The passage describes different social classes eating separately, so this is likely.
*   **C: Ko ngā tangata taonga e takoto ana i te wā o te kai (Important people being seated during mealtime)** - The passage describes how the Romans separated meals based on social class.
*   **D: He whiri o Tāke tunu (A basket of woven reeds)** - While not a food itself, a woven basket would have been used for serving or storing food, making it a likely element of the table setting.

"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e taea te pānga mau tonu?","The correct answer is **B: He ahurea iti (Small cultures)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ka maninohea noa ngā ahurea iti nei, ka ngaro ngā kōrero tuku iho e mana ai te iwi hei iwi mananui."" This translates to: ""These small cultures will simply fade, and the traditions that give the people their identity as a large people will be lost.""

This directly indicates that small cultures are vulnerable to being absorbed or lost as larger civilizations develop. The other options are more likely to persist:

*   **He iwi (A people/tribe):** The text mentions a ""rōpū motuhake nunui"" (a large distinct group/tribe) forming a civilization. This suggests the original people are a foundational element.
*   **He kāwanatanga taone (A city-state/government of a city):** The text notes the rise of city-states and then countries.
*   **He ahurea ā-iwi (A national culture/people's culture):** The text speaks of a culture that gives a people identity as a larger people, suggesting a national culture forms.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha i mua i te iwi?","The correct answer is **D: He nga ahurea iti** (Small cultures).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tētahi āhuatanga o te ahurea whatutoto ko te tuku i te mātauranga whakawhiti atu i ētahi reanga, tētahi whakarerenga ā-ahurea e toe ana, ā, he tika te tukutuku atu. Ka maninohea noa ngā ahurea iti nei, ka ngaro ngā kōrero tuku iho e mana ai te iwi hei iwi mananui."" (A characteristic of civilization is the transmission of knowledge across generations, a cultural exchange, and its proper transmission. These smaller cultures will simply fade away, and the oral traditions that give the people identity as a larger people will be lost.)

This directly indicates that civilization arises *from* smaller, existing cultures. Therefore, the answer is D.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero mo te Drukgyal Dzong ehara i te pono?,"The correct answer is **A: I hangaia hei whakanui i te wikitoria o ngā ope o Tibetan-Mongol**.

Here's why:

* The text states the Dzong was built to commemorate Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory *over the Mongol armies*.  Therefore, saying it was built to celebrate a victory *of the Tibetan-Mongol forces* is inaccurate. Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was a Tibetan, and he led the Bhutanese forces against the Mongols.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: Kei Bhutan:** The text explicitly states the Dzong is in the Paro District of Bhutan.
* **C: Na te ahi i huna te nui o nga taonga o te pā:** The text says that *after* a fire, artifacts were rescued and protected. So, fire *damaged* the artifacts, not *hid* them.
* **D: I waihangatia e Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** The text says Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the Dzong.
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e tino whakaahua ana i te putanga o te ahi i te Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **B: I wikitoria nga ope o Tibetan-Mongol**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I te tau 1951, i mahue noa mai ētahi tāonga i te weranga nui ki Drukgyal Dzong, pērā ki te whakaahua mō Zhabdrung.""  This means the fire happened *after* Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory over the Tibetan-Mongol invaders in 1649. The fire was a consequence of the Mongol invasion and subsequent events.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko te mea anake i toe ko te whakapakoko o Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - While Zhabdrung built the Dzong, the question asks what *caused* the fire. His victory is the context, not the cause.
*   **C: Kāore i pāngia te manakohanga o te tāwhara** - The text explicitly says the Dzong *was* damaged by fire.
*   **D: I tiakina e Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** - This refers to the Dzong being protected *after* the fire, not the cause of the fire itself.



"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki Cambodia?,"The correct answer is **D: I whakangaromia e nga Tai a Phnom Phen**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""I te tau 1772 i whakahotu rātou i Phnom Phen."" This translates to ""In 1772 they attacked Phnom Phen."" The ""they"" refers to the Thais.
* Option D directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I whakangaromia e te Vietnam a Phnom Phen:** The text mentions Vietnam's involvement in Kampot, but not in attacking Phnom Phen.
* **B: I whakaekea e Cambodia a Thailand i te tau 1772:** The text states Thailand attacked Phnom Phen, not Cambodia attacking Thailand.
* **C: I whakaekehia a Cambodia e nga Vietnamese i te timatanga o te rau tau 18:** The text mentions Vietnam's involvement in Kampot *towards the end* of the 18th century, not at the beginning of the 19th.  Also, it says they moved *into* Kampot, not attacked Cambodia.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tino whakaahua ana i ngā whakaekenga o Cambodia?,"The best answer is **B: I whakaekehia e nga Thai me nga Vietnamese a Cambodia i te 1772.**

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states: ""I eke ngā Thais i Kamapōtia i ētahi wā i te rautau 18, ā, i te tau 1772 i whakahotu rātou i Phnom Phen. I ngā tau whakamutunga o te rautau 18 i eke hoki te hunga Witināma i Kamapōtia."" This directly supports option B.
*   Option A is true, but doesn't specify *who* was doing the invading, and it's less precise than B.
*   Option C is partially true (Vietnam did attack Phnom Phen), but option B is more comprehensive as it includes the Thai involvement.
*   Option D is also partially true (The Thai did invade Cambodia) but option B is more comprehensive as it includes the Vietnamese involvement.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and complete answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i mahia e te Kamupene o Īnia ki te Rāwhiti o Hōnea i roto i to rātau wā i Taiwana?,"The correct answer is **D: E pai ana ki te tuku i te mana o Taiwan ki te rangatiratanga o Qing (They willingly handed over the governance of Taiwan to the Qing administration)**.

Here's why:

The text states that in 1638, the Qing dynasty *took* control of Taiwan from the Dutch. It doesn't say the Dutch *willingly* handed it over. In fact, the Dutch established a settlement and initiated changes in the indigenous and Han Chinese labor systems.

The other options are all things the Dutch East India Company *did* in Taiwan:

*   **A: He turanga ki te taha tonga-uru o te motu (A settlement on the west coast of the island):** The text mentions they established a settlement.
*   **B: Whakamahia te whakaputa witi taketake (Utilized indigenous labor):** The text explicitly states they changed the indigenous labor system.
*   **C: Whakamahia ngā kaimahi Hainamana ki ōna marawhenua (Utilized Han Chinese laborers):** The text mentions they utilized Han Chinese laborers.



"
He aha te whakataunga o te Tiriti o Shimonoseki?,"The correct answer is **D: Te mana o Tiapanī i Taiwana**.

The text states: ""I te 1895, i muri i te hinga ki te Pakanga Sino-Japanese Tuatahi (1894-1895), ka hainatia e te kāwanatanga Qing te Tiriti o Shimonoseki, nā korā ia i tuku i te tino rangatiratanga o Taiwana ki Hapani...""  This directly indicates that the Treaty of Shimonoseki transferred control of Taiwan to Japan.
"
He pēhea te taumata pH o te ine matū?,"The correct answer is **C: Te nui o ngā ions Hydrogen i roto i te matū**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Tūtohu te taumata o te pH mā te nui o te katote Hauwai (te H o te pH) o roto i te matū kua mātaitia.""  This directly translates to ""The pH level is indicated by the amount of Hydrogen ions (H) in the solution.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He pēhea te hāngai, te waikawa rānei o te matū (How is the solution, the salinity, etc. of the solution?)**: While salinity can *affect* pH, pH itself is specifically defined by the concentration of hydrogen ions.
* **B: E hia ngā porotoni kei roto i te matū (How many protons are in the solution?)**:  This is close, but technically refers to protons, not specifically hydrogen ions (H+), which are the relevant ions for pH.
* **D: E hia ngā irahiko kai roto i te matū (How many ions are in the solution?)**: The pH is *specifically* about hydrogen ions, not the total number of ions.



"
He aha i tangohia mai i ngā ions Hydrogen?,"The correct answer is **A: Protons**.

Here's why:

* **pH** is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. The lower the pH, the higher the concentration of hydrogen ions.
* **Protons** *are* hydrogen ions (H+).  The pH scale is fundamentally based on the concentration of protons.
* **Alkaline** refers to a solution with a pH above 7.
* **Ngā Irahiko** (ions) is a general term and not the specific entity being measured in pH.

Therefore, the question is asking what hydrogen ions are commonly referred to as in the context of pH.  The answer is protons.
"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tika te whakaahua i te hui o nga raiona?,"The correct answer is **A: He ōrite te whanonga o rātau ki ngā rōpū kuri (They behave the same as dog packs).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the strong family-like bonds and close relationships between the people in the communities.** It specifically mentions the close relationships between sisters and the family-like structure.
* **Options B, C, and D align with the information provided.** The passage indicates strong sisterly bonds (B), close familial relationships (C), and a sense of community (D).
* **The comparison to dog packs (A) is inaccurate and doesn't reflect the nuanced relationships described in the passage.** Dog packs have a very different social structure than the community described, lacking the strong familial ties and close bonds highlighted in the text. The passage specifically contrasts them with wuruhi (weavers), dogs, and foxes, indicating these communities are different from dog packs.

Therefore, option A is the one that doesn't fit the description of the community as portrayed in the passage.



"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tika te whakaahua i te whanonga o nga raiona?,"The correct answer is **C: He tino whakamate ngā tāne me ngā wāhine ki te kai (They are very similar to each other in terms of food)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the social dynamics of the regions, specifically the strong bonds between women and the hierarchical structure.** It highlights close relationships and a family-like environment.
* **Options A, B, and D are consistent with the passage.**  The passage says the regions have strong social connections, are similar to other regions (in terms of *some* aspects), and behave similarly to other groups (like ""wuruhi"" which implies a certain type of social structure).
* **Option C is irrelevant.** The passage doesn't mention food or how the people in these regions relate to eating. It's a distraction from the core topic of social relationships and hierarchy.

Therefore, option C doesn't contribute to or accurately depict the social dynamics described in the passage.



"
He kai noa iho ngā rākau mō te aha te momo kaiwhaiwhai?,"The correct answer is **A: ngā poti iti (small spaces)**.

Here's why:

The text explains that small insects, including parasitic wasps, thrive because they have a special niche or dwelling unique to each insect, preventing competition. The question asks what kind of spaces the plants (rākau) are for the insectivores (kaiwhaiwhai).  Since the text mentions small insects occupying small spaces, it's logical to assume the plants provide those small spaces for other insects to live in.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā poti nunui (large spaces):** The text emphasizes the *small* niches.
*   **C: Ngā poti rahi-waenga (medium-sized spaces):**  Again, the focus is on small spaces.
*   **D: Antelopes:** Antelopes are animals that eat plants, not spaces that insects live in.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e tino whaia ana e ngā ngeru iti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Rodents (Rodents)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Whainari, he tini ngā momo ngeru iti (me ngā ngeru mōkai āwhiowhio hoki) ka kai i ngā tini mea iti nei pēnei i ngā ngārara, i ngā paihamu, i ngā mokomoko me ngā manu."" This translates to: ""However, many types of small rodents (and also some insectivorous rodents) eat these small things such as lizards, insects, frogs, and birds.""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions that small rodents (ngeru iti) eat lizards (kararehe) and other small creatures.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **Rapiti (Antelopes)** are large animals and not typically prey for rodents.
*   **Antelopes** are also large animals.
*   **Tia (Lizards)** are prey *of* some rodents, not what the rodents primarily eat.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te wāhanga o te tikanga hopu a te ocelot?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i a rātau taonga parakete i te pō**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ocelots hunt mice, rats, lizards, and birds *if they can*. It also mentions that they are good at seeing in the dark and have excellent hearing, and they hunt in their territory.  There's no mention of them hunting *after* their prey has already been caught. Options A, B, and D are all mentioned in the passage as part of the ocelot's hunting behavior.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua i te ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: He ngoikore to rātau mana kakara** (They have no hunting skills).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""He rawe ō rātou karu ki te titiro i roto i te pō uriuri me ngā tirohanga o te pō, me te āta nekeneke hoki."" (They have keen senses for looking in the dark and at night, and are stealthy.) This directly contradicts option C.
* The text also states that ocelots hunt small animals, indicating they *do* have hunting skills.
* Options A (Ka taea e rātau te whai pai i te pō - They can hunt well at night) and B (Ka neke mārire rātau - They move stealthily) are supported by the text.
* Option D (He pai ake ki a rātau te kimi kararehe iti - They prefer to hunt small animals) is also supported by the text.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e kiia ko te kaha nui o te taikaha?,"The correct answer is **A: Haruru**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te haruru a te taika ehara i te mea he haruru nui pērā ki te raiona, engari he momo ngengere, he momo tīwahawaha.""  This means the hawk's cry is not a loud cry like an eagle's, but rather a screech or a whistle. It is described as *not* a powerful cry.

The other options (Piki, Kaukau, Peke tawhiti, and Kukume) are all listed as powerful abilities of the hawk.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o nga rerekētanga i waenganui i nga tākaro me nga raiona?","The correct answer is **A: to rātau kaha kaukau**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""He kaiaka e mōhio nei ki ngā mea huhua, e taea nei e te taika te piki (heoi he āhua ninipa), **te kaukau**..."" (It is a leader who knows about insects, the spider can climb (although it is a kind of ninipa), **spin webs**...).

The question asks for a difference between spiders and wasps. The text highlights that spiders can spin webs, while it doesn't mention wasps spinning webs. Therefore, ""to rātau kaha kaukau"" (their ability to spin webs) is the distinguishing characteristic mentioned.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mahi a Robert Hooke i mua i ētahi atu kaimātai koiora?","The correct answer is **A: Tirohia ngā pūtau mate** (Observed dead cells).

The passage states: ""Ko ia te tangata tuatahi ki te kite i ngā pūtau mate"" which translates to ""He was the first person to observe dead cells."" Therefore, this is the action Robert Hooke did that other biologists hadn't done before.
"
"""He aha te take o te kupu """"pūtau"""" te tikanga?""","The correct answer is **B: Rūma iti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te ira te mea pāpaku rawa me te wāhanga whakatika o te rauropi (mea) ora. Kua ahu mai te kupu pūtau i te kupu cella nō te reo Rātini ko tōna tikanga ko te rūma paku."" 

This translates to: ""The cell is the basic structural and functional unit of living organisms. The word 'pūtau' comes from the word 'cella' in the Māori language and its meaning is 'room'.""

Therefore, the term ""pūtau"" refers to a ""room"" and in the context of cells, it refers to the small compartments within the cell.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te nuinga o nga kararehe e āhei ana ki te mahi i te aha?","The correct answer is **B: Nuku**.

The passage states: ""Kei ngā kararehe anake he roro (ahakoa kāore i te katoa o ngā kararehe; hei tauira, kāore he roro tō ngā pūkarukaru)."" This translates to ""Only birds have feathers (although not all birds; for example, penguins don't have feathers).""  It also says ""Ka taea e te nuinga o ngā kararehe te nuku,"" meaning ""Most birds can fly.""

While the passage mentions birds fly (keri) and swim (kaukau) and also eat and swallow things, the question asks what most birds are *able to do*. The passage explicitly says ""most birds can fly"" and ""they eat, and swallow those things into themselves.""  The main ability highlighted as common is flying.

Therefore, **Nuku (fly)** is the best answer.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ētahi kararehe kāore i a ia?","The correct answer is **C: Roro**.

The passage states: ""Kei ngā kararehe anake he roro (ahakoa kāore i te katoa o ngā kararehe; hei tauira, kāore he roro tō ngā pūkarukaru)."" This translates to ""Only birds have a beak (although not all birds; for example, vultures don't have a beak).""

Therefore, the passage explicitly says that not all birds have beaks, and vultures are given as an example. The question asks what birds *don't* have, and the passage identifies beaks as a unique characteristic.
"
He aha ngā tipu e āwhina ana i te tukanga whakaahua?,"The correct answer is **D: Rā**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes how plants use sunlight to create their own food (photosynthesis). It states: ""Kei te hangaia e ngā tipu ā rātou ake kai mai i te rā ki te ahotakakame."" (Plants make their own food from the sun to the soil).

Therefore, the sun (rā) is essential for the process of photosynthesis, which is the basis of how plants produce food and ultimately support all life. The other options are not directly involved in the process of photosynthesis.



"
He aha te āhua o te tangata e tipu ana i te tāpu?,"The correct answer is **A: Kai**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes how plants produce food through photosynthesis and release oxygen. It also states that humans build homes and clothes from plant products and that most of our food comes from plants.  Therefore, the question is asking what *type* of thing is growing in the garden, and based on the context, it's referring to the plants themselves, which produce food.  The word ""kai"" means ""food"" in Māori, which makes the most sense in this context.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hāora** (breath/life) - While plants produce oxygen, the text focuses on their role as a *source* of food.
*   **C: Wai** (water) - Plants need water, but the passage isn't about water.
*   **D: Waro taikura** (black coal) - This is completely unrelated to the passage's topic.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauira e whai ake nei e aukati i te tukanga kunenga?","The correct answer is **A: I rahua te tipu o tētahi rōpū iti ki tētahi tauwāhi hōu.**

Here's why:

The passage describes how a small group migrates to a new environment. This migration *initiates* the evolutionary process (the ""tikanga noa"" - the natural tendency to create new life forms).  Option A directly reflects this initial migration, which is the starting point for the changes described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He wāhanga o tētahi iwi whānui e neke ana ki tētahi taiao hou:** The passage focuses on a *small group* (tētahi rōpū iti), not a whole tribe (iwi whānui).
* **C: He iwi whānui e whakarite ana i tōna whakatikatika ki tētahi taiao hou:**  The passage describes the *result* of adaptation (the changes in species over time), not the process of *preparing* for adaptation.
* **D: Kotahi te iwi whānui ka hanga i te rua:** This option is completely unrelated to the passage's content. It brings in the idea of building a nest, which is not mentioned.



"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaahua i te tukanga o te whakatū? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ka puta ina kore e taea e tētahi iwi hou te urutau (It appears when a new tribe cannot inherit)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the evolution of species through adaptation to new environments.** It's about species changing over time, not about one species failing to adapt.
* **Options B, C, and D align with the passage's description:**
    * **B: He āhuatanga nui tēnei o te tukanga kunenga (This is a major feature of the evolutionary process):**  The passage explicitly states this is a fundamental aspect of evolution.
    * **C: E pā ana ki te hanganga o tētahi momo hou (It relates to the creation of a new type):**  The passage refers to the creation of new species/types of organisms.
    * **D: Kāore e taea te takanga (It cannot be predicted):** The passage states that over vast timescales, the difference between species becomes so great that they are no longer the same type, implying unpredictability.
* **Option A is incorrect** because the passage emphasizes adaptation and survival, not failure to inherit or evolve.  The passage describes what happens *when* adaptation and change *do* occur, leading to new species.
"
Ko tēhea wāhanga o te pūnaha whakaheke toto e kawe i te toto ki te ngakau?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā Toi (Atria)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks which part of the circulatory system *carries blood to the heart*.
* The passage states: ""Ko ngā pū e kīia ana he ia-tuku, ā, ka hoki mai ki te manawa..."" which translates to ""The chambers called atria, and then return to the heart...""  The atria receive blood *from* the veins and pump it *into* the ventricles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā Pūmatua (Ventricles):** Ventricles pump blood *out* of the heart to the lungs and the rest of the body.
* **C: Whēkau (Valves):** Valves prevent backflow of blood.
* **D: iaia (No):** The passage explicitly states the atria *do* carry blood to the heart.



"
Ko tēhea ngā ngongo iti rawa i roto i te pūnaha whakaheke toto?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Toi (The Atria)**.

The passage states: ""Ko ngā pū iti rawa e kīia ana he ngongo rauangi"" which translates to ""The small chambers are called the atria.""  ""Ngā Toi"" is the Māori word for atria.
"
Ko te āheinga o te ngārara ki te takahi i ōna parirau ki muri e whakanui ana i tēhea o ēnei?,"The correct answer is **B: Huna i nga waahi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mā korā ka whānui ake ngā wāhi iti hei huna i ngā konihi"" which translates to ""By them [the chicks] the small places to hide from predators become larger.""  This directly links the chicks' ability to wiggle their toes (āheinga ki te kōnumi i ō rātou parirau) to being able to hide better.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tuku kai (Feeding):** While feeding is important, the passage doesn't specifically link toe-wiggling to feeding.
* **C: Kimi hoa (Finding companions):**  The passage mentions finding companions as a benefit of good flying skills, not toe-wiggling.
* **D: Terenga rererangi (Aerial navigation):**  Aerial navigation is related to flying skills, not directly to the toe-wiggling behavior described.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei mea e pā ana ki te kaha rere o te ngārara?,"The correct answer is **B: Roanga o te ora (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the first eagles had excellent flying skills, which allowed them to be more agile, find food, and locate mates. These are all related to *how* they fly.
* **Whakaputa (Agility)**, **huihuinga kai (Finding food)**, and **maina kaikā (Mating)** are all directly linked to the benefits of their flight ability.
* **Roanga o te ora (Lifespan)** is not mentioned in the context of the eagles' flying skills or how they developed those skills. It's a separate aspect of their life that isn't discussed in this passage.

Therefore, lifespan is the only option not directly related to the advantages of the eagles' flight.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei kāore i te pāhono nuitia ki ngā dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **A: E haere ana te waewae o muri**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""He waewae unaunahi me te matikuku, ka whakawhānau hēki, ā, ka hīkoi i runga i ōna waewae ō muri pēnei i te T-Rex."" This directly links the feet to dinosaurs.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""E kīia ana e tātou he manu. He tini ngā tāngata kāore e whakapop ana he tainahoro ērā rā i te mea he huruhuru ōna, ā, e taea te rere.""  This connects wings, flight, and dinosaurs.
* **The passage lists characteristics shared between dinosaurs and birds:** wings, feathers, and the ability to fly.
* **""E haere ana te waewae o muri""** (walking on two feet) is a characteristic more commonly associated with birds, specifically theropod dinosaurs, but not *universally* a defining feature *of* dinosaurs as a whole.  The passage describes a more general dinosaur foot structure.

Therefore, while some dinosaurs walked on two feet, it's not as consistently or universally linked to *all* dinosaurs as the other options are.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te whakaarotia noatia hei āhuatanga tiritiri o ngā manu me ngā dinosaur?,"The correct answer is **D: E rongo ana ki ngā hē (Hearing roars)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on physical characteristics shared by birds and dinosaurs.** It mentions feathers, strong legs, and walking on two legs.
* **Hearing roars is a behavioral trait, not a physical characteristic.** While some dinosaurs likely had hearing, the ability to ""hear roars"" specifically isn't presented as a shared physical attribute. The other options (feathers, bipedalism, and flight) are all directly mentioned as similarities.

Therefore, option D is the one that doesn't fit the context of physical characteristics being discussed.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhanga o te tipu cycad tērā pea ka kai tētahi Triceratops?","The correct answer is **A: Ka rau te spiky**.

The passage states that cycads have ""a crown of sharp leaves"". The Triceratops used its strong beak to ""chomp on the leaves before the tree"". Therefore, it would have eaten the spiky leaves.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka tino kai te Triceratops? ","The correct answer is **D: He tipu me ngā hua paitini**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""kei te whakapono ētahi kaipūtaiao i kai ngā Triceratops i ngā cycads, arā ko tētahi momo tipu i kitea whānuitia i te wā Cretaceous."" (some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are a type of plant found widely in the Cretaceous period.)
* It also mentions the cycads are like small pine trees with sharp crowns and feathery leaves.
* Furthermore, it mentions that Triceratops had a strong mouth to tear at the leaves before going to its lair.
* Finally, it notes the cycads had many seeds, implying a nutritious food source.

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the text does not suggest Triceratops ate carnivores, large trees, or parrots.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei e tino manakohia ana i ngā rohe ki te raki o Itari?","The correct answer is **D: F1 moti reihi (F1 racing)**.

The passage states: ""Kei roto i ngā tākaro rorotu ko te whanapoikiri, te pahiketepōro, te meke pōro, te fencing, te whutupōro, te eke pahikara, te hoki tio, te hoki rōra, me te reihi motokā F1.""  and ""He rorotu rawa ngā hākinakina hōtoke ki ngā takiwā Raki, ā, ka whakataetae te hunga nō Itāria ki ngā kēmu ā-ao, me ngā tauwhāinga o Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao.""  This means that motorsports, including F1 racing, are very popular in the northern regions of Italy.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whutupōro (Skiing)** - While skiing is mentioned as a sport, the passage *specifically* ties motorsports to the northern regions.
*   **B: Poirewa (Cycling)** - Cycling is mentioned as a sport, but not linked to the northern regions as strongly as motorsports.
*   **C: Papa Huka (Snooker)** - Snooker is mentioned, but not linked to the northern regions.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei i toa i tētahi whakataetae ao mō Itari?","The correct answer is **D: paihikara (Formula 1 racing)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Formula 1 racing is included in Italy's national sports, and that the Italian Formula 1 team is very successful worldwide. It also mentions Italy winning the FIFA World Cup in 2006. However, the question asks which of the *listed sports* Italy has won an *international competition* in.  The text *only* explicitly mentions winning the FIFA World Cup, which is a football (soccer) competition. While the text highlights Formula 1 success, it *doesn't* explicitly state a World Championship win in that sport.  The other sports (archery, shooting, fencing, rowing, cycling) are not mentioned in connection with Italian success.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based *solely* on the provided text is **D: paihikara (Formula 1 racing)** because the text highlights their success in that sport.



"
I muri i te aha i riro ai ētahi wāhanga o Luxembourg hei wāhanga o Peeke?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te Huringa o Belgian**.

The passage states: ""He roa tā Luxembourg hītori, engari ko tōna mana motuhake ka hoki noa atu ki te tau 1839. Ko ētahi wāhi o nāianei o Belgium he wāhanga o mua o Luxembourg ēngari i Belgianngia whai muri i ngā tau 1830 o te hurihanga nui a Belgian."" (Luxembourg has a long history, but its independence only returned in 1839. Some parts of present-day Belgium were once part of Luxembourg, but were annexed by Belgium after the major upheaval of the 1830s in Belgium.)



Therefore, the area of Luxembourg became part of Belgium as a result of the Belgian Revolution. The other options are incorrect according to the text.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei āhuatanga e pā ana ki te tōrangapū o Luxembourg?,"The correct answer is **D: Te noho hei whenua motuhake**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ētahi wāhi o nāianei o Belgium he wāhanga o mua o Luxembourg **ēngari i Belgianngia whai muri i ngā tau 1830 o te hurihanga nui a Belgian**. Mai rā anō kua ngana a Luxembourg kia noho tonu hei **whenua ngū**..."" This directly indicates that Luxembourg has strived to maintain its independence.

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are not the defining characteristic of Luxembourg's *status* or identity.
"
E hia ngā kiromita tapawha o te rohe katoa o Turkey kei Uropi?,"The correct answer is **A: 9174**.

The passage states: ""...kei Ūropi te 23,764 kiromita pūrua (9,174 maero pūrua)."" This directly answers the question of how many kilometers of Turkey's territory are in Europe.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hia ngā māwhiti te roa o Tāke?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Ko te rohe o Tākei he nui ake i te 1,600 kiromita (1,000 māero) te roa..."" which translates to ""The area of Turkey is greater than 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles) long...""
"
He aha te reo Rātini e whakamahia ana i Vatican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā tikanga whakapono (Religious practices)**.

The text states: ""...kei te tino whakamahia te reo Rātini ki ngā kawa ā-hāhi."" This translates to ""...Latin is strongly used in religious ceremonies."" Therefore, the reo Rātini is used in religious practices.



"
"I roto i te Vatican City, he aha te kore e whakamahia ai te reo Itari?","The correct answer is **A: Ture (Laws)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Italian language is used in the Vatican City's laws and regulations (""i ōna ture me ōna pārongorongo""). Therefore, the Italian language *is* used in the laws.

The other options are correct:

*   **B: Whakawhitiwhiti whai mana (Diplomatic communication):** The Italian language is used in diplomatic communication.
*   **C: Ngā tikanga whakapono (Religious practices):** Latin is used in religious practices, though Italian is used in everyday communications.
*   **D: Whakawhitinga ia rā (Daily communication):** Italian is used in daily communication.

So, the only option that is *not* mentioned as being used in Italian is **laws**.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā painga e whai ake nei mai i te whāranu oro i runga i ngā rorohiko mātauranga?","The correct answer is **A: Puoro (Audio)**.

The text explicitly states: ""He nui ngā wā ka rīkoatatia te puoro mā ngā rorohiko mātanga hei whakarite, hei whenumi tahi hoki i ngā oro.""  This translates to: ""Often, audio is recorded by advanced technologies to ensure and unify the sounds.""

The other options are mentioned in the context of *visual* media (images, movies) and are not directly related to the benefits of audio processing on advanced technologies. Therefore, A is the only correct answer.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te nuinga o nga kāinga i whakaaturia ai e te tauwāhi nga whare taonga e hīrere ana?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei ngā tāone nui o Harappa, o Mohenjo-daro hoki tētahi wharepaku wai ki te tata ki ngā whare katoa, e tūhonotia ana ki tētahi pūnaha paru pīroiroi.""  This directly links Mohenjo-daro to having a water tank near all the houses connected to a sewage system. The other options are mentioned as having similar water systems in *some* cases, but Mohenjo-daro is specifically identified with this feature in the passage.
"
I whea o ngā wāhi e whai ake nei i kitea ai ngā pūnaha waipiro matatau?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The question states: ""Kei ngā tāone nui o Harappa, o Mohenjo-daro hoki tētahi wharepaku wai ki te tata ki ngā whare katoa..."" (In the great cities of Harappa, and Mohenjo-daro also, there was a water tank close to all the houses...)

While Santorini, Egypt, and China also had water tanks, Harappa is explicitly mentioned first as an example.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e ārahi ana i te Skater kia huri?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko ngā pito e rua i te taha o te papa o te Skate** (The two sides on the side of the Skate board).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kei te whakaahei ngā taha e rua kia pai ake te piri ki te tiao..."" which translates to ""The two sides allow for better connection to the ground...""  It then describes how the board tilts based on which side is more connected.  This implies the two sides (the edges of the board) are responsible for the turning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko te ānau iti i te raro o te papa o te Skate** (The small section on the bottom of the Skate board): The passage doesn't mention the bottom of the board being the cause of the turning.
*   **C: Ko te taumata āheinga whānui o te Skater** (The wider stance of the Skater): The Skater's stance influences balance, but not the direct turning mechanism.
*   **D: Te kounga o te hukapapa** (The quality of the wheels): Wheel quality affects glide and performance, but not the turning mechanism itself.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakamārama ana i te hāngai i runga i te rau o tētahi hukapapa o nāianei?","The correct answer is **B: Ānau (Concave)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the shape of the eye's inner surface ( whakararo) causes the lens to change shape to focus light.  It says the lens ""ānau"" (becomes concave) when the eyes look to the north, and ""ānauī"" (becomes convex) when they look to the south. 

* **Ānau** means concave (curving inward).
* **Ānauī** means convex (curving outward).
* **Mata-taurua** refers to the pupil.
* **Concave** is just the English equivalent of ānau.
* **Tilted** doesn't accurately describe the lens's shape change.



Therefore, **Ānau (Concave)** is the best fit for the description in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te tukanga e āhei ai ngā ngota ki te whakakore i te pūngao o te marama?","The correct answer is **A: Parawhiti (Stimulated Emission)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka pēnei rātou mā te whakputa i tētahi korakora ririki o te aho e kīia ana he """"pūaho"""". Ka karangatia tēnei mahinga e ngā kaipūtaiao te """"stimulated emission of radiation""""..."" which translates to ""They do this by emitting a small burst of light called an """"emission"""". Scientists call this process """"stimulated emission of radiation""""...""

Therefore, the passage describes *stimulated emission* as the process by which photons are able to amplify light. The term ""parawhiti"" is the Māori translation for stimulated emission.
"
He aha te take o te ngota hai whakaputa whakaahua?,"The correct answer is **A: Te tuku pūngao nui (The release of a large amount of energy)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that stimulated emission of radiation is the process where excited atoms release energy in the form of photons (light).  The phrase ""hikohikongia ana ngā ngota e ngā raiti muramura, e puha ai te pūaho o te raiti"" translates to ""the electrons in the atoms are excited, causing the atom's energy to build up.""  This built-up energy is then released as light.  Therefore, the core concept is the release of a significant amount of energy in the form of photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ko te whakaongaonga i puta mai i te marama kaha (The effect of intense light):** The passage doesn't relate the nature of light to the reason why the light is produced.
*   **C: Ngā taumata pūngao hauā (The gaseous energy levels):** While the passage mentions energy levels, it doesn't state that those levels themselves are the reason for light emission. They are the *result* of energy being absorbed.
*   **D: He urupare kino ki te hihi (A negative effect on the light):** The passage describes a process of *producing* light, not a negative effect on it.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te pūrama mārama kia mutu te mahi?","The correct answer is **D: Ko te rere o te hiko ki roto i te kōpaki e whakaiti ana.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I te mea ko te hiko e rere nei ki te papa e noho nei te wāhanga konganuku o te umanga, ka tūmeke tō hiko me ka pā atu koe ki roto o te umanga, ki te turanga whakarewa rānei o te pēra i te wā kei roto paku toni i te kōhao.""

This translates to: ""Because the electricity runs to the part where the ground of the house is located, your electricity will be cut off and you will go into the house, to the breaker or the fuse box at the same time as you are still in the switch.""

This indicates that the power supply to the circuit is being interrupted, leading to the light failing. Option D directly reflects this: ""The flow of electricity into the circuit is being reduced.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kāore i te tika te whakaweto i te maunga mārama (It is not correct to switch off the light bulb):** The passage *does* say to switch off the fuse/breaker. This option is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **B: He pūtake whakarewa anake o te pōtae o te pōtae (It is only a reason for the breaker of the fuse):** While the breaker/fuse box *is* involved, the passage explains *why* the breaker is being tripped - due to the power flow being interrupted.  This option doesn't fully capture the cause.
* **C: E tahuna ana te kaka i roto i te pūrama (The bird is trapped inside the fuse box):** There is no mention of a bird in the passage.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e taea te mōrearea ki te pa ki te whakakapi i tētahi pōtae?,"The correct answer is **D: Te taura (The cord)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where the lightbulb filament burns out and the bulb stops working. It then states that you need to unplug the bulb.  The text also mentions that the electricity runs to the base of the bulb and into the house. Therefore, the cord is the part you need to disconnect to safely remove the bulb.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te Filament (The filament):** The filament *is* the part that burns out, but the question asks what you need to *unplug* to remove the bulb.
* **B: Te whakawhiti rama (The light socket):** The light socket holds the bulb, but you don't typically unplug the socket itself.  You unplug the cord connected to the socket.
* **C: Te pūtake o te pūrama (The base of the bulb):** The base is the part that screws into the socket. You don't typically unplug the base; you unplug the cord connected to the socket.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea ka wehea te karihi?","The correct answer is **A: Ka whiwhia ngā Protons (Protons are released)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...he whakawehe nei anō i te poka pū, ka tukuna ai ētahi o taua ngoi. He karihi pāhekeheke kei ētahi ngota, nā korā ka whakawehi ai ahakoa kāore he tuke, he iti rānei te tuke.""

This translates to: ""...it also releases the core, and some of those particles are emitted. There is a fluid-like (or ""friable"") debris in some spots, which causes them to release even if they are not solid, or have very little solidity.""

The context points to the release of particles *from* the core, creating debris.  The passage later refers to the debris as ""karihi pāhekeheke"" (fluid-like debris). Because the passage refers to “ngā ngoi” (particles), and the other answers aren't clearly linked to the text's description of debris, **Protons** is the most likely answer given the context of nuclear fission. While neutrons are also released, the passage more directly links the release of particles to the debris.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakaatu ana i ngā waea tawhiti ki te Ao,"The correct answer is **A: Telescopes**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states that telescopes are used to observe distant celestial objects.** The text says, ""...ngā karu whātata ki tuarangi e ngā kaipūtaiao nā te mea kei te rāweke te kōhauhau i ētahi o tā mātou aho, tirohanga anō hoki. Mā te rākete rahi nui ake i te 100 putu te teitei e tuku i tētahi āmiorangi, karu whātata ranei ki tuarangi."" ( ""...telescopes are used by scientists because they are powerful enough to resolve some of our lines, and also to observe. A telescope, over 100 feet tall, is used to send an observatory or telescope to the sky""). This directly connects telescopes with observing the distant sky.
* **The text describes observatories as being placed in the sky and receiving signals from telescopes.** This reinforces the connection between telescopes and studying the far reaches of space.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: Ngā Aorangi (Observatories):** While observatories are used for astronomical observation, the text highlights telescopes as the instruments *doing* the observing.
    * **C: Ngā Kōmā (Comets):** Comets are celestial objects, but not instruments for observing the distant sky.
    * **D: Pūroro (Radios):** Radios are used for communication and detecting radio waves, not for visual observation of distant objects.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakamahia ana hei tuku i tētahi pouaka whakaata ki te mokowā?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā aorangi neke atu i te 100 waewae te teitei (Clouds over 100 feet high)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how large clouds (over 100 feet high) are used to carry weather instruments to the mountains. The question asks what is used to deliver a movie projector to a remote location.  The passage doesn't directly address movie projectors, but it establishes that large clouds can be used for transport.  Therefore, option D is the most logical connection, implying that a similar large-scale transport method could theoretically be adapted to carry a movie projector.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā kurupae kōmā (Drones):** While drones *can* deliver things, the passage focuses on *clouds* and their use in delivering instruments to mountains. Drones aren't mentioned.
* **B: Pūroro (Rocket):**  Rockets are generally used for space travel and not for delivering objects to remote locations on Earth.
* **C: Hau takiwā o te Ao (Global wind):** Global winds are a natural phenomenon, but not a targeted transport method.



"
He aha te mea me mōhio e pā ana ki tētahi kaupapa hurihuri hei whai i te haere o te wā?,"The correct answer is **A: Roanga (Duration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mā te wā hoki e whakataurite ai tātou i te roanga o ngā mahinga."" This translates to ""It is through time that we determine the duration of actions."" 

Therefore, understanding the duration (roanga) of a cyclical process (mahi hurihuri) is key to understanding its progression through time.

The other options are less directly supported by the passage:

*   **Tāruatanga (Volatility):** While volatility might be *a characteristic* of a cyclical process, the passage doesn't emphasize it as the primary factor to understand the flow of time.
*   **Pānga (Impact/Effect):** The impact of a process isn't the core element for tracking its time progression.
*   **Te Uaua (The Difficulty):** The difficulty is a characteristic, not what helps track the passage of time.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āhua o tētahi takahanga e whakamahia ana hei whakataurite?","The correct answer is **A: Roa (Duration)**.

The passage states: ""Mā te wā hoki e whakataurite ai tātou i te roanga o ngā mahinga"" which translates to ""It is through time that we determine the duration of actions.""  Therefore, the passage is describing something related to duration. ""Roa"" means duration or length in Māori.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e kiia ana he tauira mō tētahi kaiwhiwhi o te torona?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te whiwhi i tētahi waeine 2:2**.

The passage states that Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a double distinction, referring to achieving the rank of 2:2 (a second class honours degree). This is the most direct link to the question about what signifies being a ""kaiwhiwhi o te torona"" (a recipient of a distinction/award).
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i hoatu i roto i te wāhanga, ko Charles te tuatahi ki te mahi i te aha?","The correct answer is **C: Whiwhi Waeine**.

The text states: ""Charles te mema tuatahi o te Whānau Kīngi o Peretānia kia whakawhiwhia ki tētahi tohu paetahi."" This translates to ""Charles was the first member of the British Royal Family to be awarded a badge.""  The question asks what Charles was the first to *do* based on the information given. Since the badge is mentioned directly, the most logical action he took to *receive* the badge would be to be awarded it.  The context implies this was related to joining a certain group. The answer ""Whiwhi Waeine"" (which means ""to join the military"") is the most appropriate choice, as receiving a badge often signifies joining a military unit or undertaking a military role. The other options aren't mentioned in the text.



"
Nō tēhea whenua te kaipuke a Trygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: Nōwei**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nā Olaf Trygvasson tēnei kāhui i ārahi, he uri nō Nōwini..."" which translates to ""This raiding party was led by Olaf Trygvasson, a son of Norway...""
"
He aha te wā i roto i te hītori i whakamahia ai e Tiamana he āhuatanga ahurea kaha ki Estonia?,"The correct answer is **C: Neke atu i te 600 tau ki mua**.

The text states: ""Nō te rautau 15 i noho ai a Estonia ki te Raki i raro i te maru o Tiamana."" (In the 15th century, Estonia was under German rule.) This places the beginning of the influence at least 600 years ago (from the time of writing - the text itself). The text further explains the development of the Estonian language *during* this period.
"
He aha te take i puta ai te reo Estonian?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā māngai Tiamana (German Monarchs)**.

The text states: ""I hiahia ētahi monaki Tiamani kia tuku i te Atua kia tata ake ki ngā iwi taketake, nō reira i hanga rātou i te reo ā-kiko o Etōnia."" This translates to ""Some German monarchs wanted to bring God closer to the indigenous people, so they created the liturgical language of Estonia.""

Therefore, the German monarchs are the ones who initiated the creation of the Estonian language. While the Õ/õ character and the German alphabet were *used* in the creation, the *reason* for the language's existence was the monarchs' desire to connect with the indigenous people.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te maha o ngā tukuoro Hīni māori e tārere ana i runga anō i tēhea āhuatanga?","The correct answer is **C: Mēnā ka tatau i ngā tāngata e mōhio ana ki te reo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He rite te Hindi me te Urdu ki te taha wete reo heoi he rerekē te taha tuhinga; I roto i te reo ōpaki ka mārama ngā kaikōrero i te nuinga o te wā ō rātou ake reo."" This translates to: ""Like Hindi and Urdu, although they are written in different scripts, speakers generally understand their own language.""

The question asks what the Māori speakers are being compared to in terms of the number of Hindi speakers. The passage says the number of Hindi speakers is estimated between 340 million and 500 million, and 800 million people can understand the language.  This is being compared to the number of people who understand their *own* language (in the case of Hindi and Urdu). Therefore, the Māori speakers are being compared to people who understand their own language.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e tika ana mō te reo Hindi me te reo Urdu?,"The correct answer is **A: I te nuinga o te wā he wehe i waenganui i ngā kaikōrero o ngā reo e rua** (In most cases, speakers of the two languages are mutually unintelligible).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""He rite te Hindi me te Urdu ki te taha wete reo heoi he rerekē te taha tuhinga; I roto i te reo ōpaki ka mārama ngā kaikōrero i te nuinga o te wā ō rātou ake reo."" (Hindi and Urdu are similar in terms of spoken language, but differ in writing; in spoken language, speakers usually understand their own language.)

This clearly indicates that while they share a common linguistic root, Hindi and Urdu are not mutually intelligible, meaning speakers of one language often can't understand speakers of the other.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He rerekē rātou ki te hōtuhi** (They differ in writing) - While true, this doesn't address the *understanding* aspect for speakers.
* **C: He ōrite rātau i roto i te kupu me te tuhinga** (They are the same in words and writing) - This is directly contradicted by the passage.
* **D: He rereke nga kupu** (The words are different) - While there are differences in vocabulary, the key point is the *degree* of difference that leads to mutual unintelligibility.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika mō te reta Hangeul?,"The correct answer is **C: I hangaia e te kīngi tuawhā o Joseon Hau**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Hangul was created during the reign of King Sejong the Great.
*   King Sejong was the *fourth* king of the Joseon Dynasty. Therefore, option C is incorrect.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: I hangaia i te tīmatanga o te rangatiratanga o Kingi Sejong:** The passage mentions the creation date is 1444, which falls during King Sejong's reign.
*   **B: Ko te ingoa taketake o te reta ko Hunan Jeongeum:** The passage explicitly states that King Sejong titled the alphabet ""Hunmin Jeongeum.""
*   **D: I waihangatia i runga i te take:** While the passage doesn't directly state the *reason* for its creation, it says the goal was to ""teach people correctly,"" suggesting a purpose beyond just aesthetics or tradition. So it's a plausible inference, even if not explicitly stated.



Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that Hangul was created during the reign of the *fifth* king of Joseon Dynasty.



"
I te mutunga ka hurihia te reta Hunmin Jeongeum ki te aha?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states: ""Ko King Sejong te kīngi tuawhā o te Joseon Dynasty, ā, ko ia tētahi o ngā mea tino whakarangatiratia. I tapa tūturu ia i te arapū Hanguel ki Hunmin Jeongeum..."" This means King Sejong created the Hangul alphabet, which was documented in the Hunmin Jeongeum.

Therefore, the question asks what the Hunmin Jeongeum was *turned into*. The answer is Hangul.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko ēhea ngā reo i whakaawetia e Sanskrit?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā reo Rātini**.

The passage states: ""He reo tāukiuki te Sanskrit, ko tōna rite ko te reo Rātini e kōrerotia ana ki Ūropi."" which translates to ""Sanskrit is a Indo-European language, its relative is the language spoken in Europe."" Therefore, Sanskrit is related to Indo-European languages, which includes the Romance languages (like French, Spanish, Italian, etc.) and the Germanic languages. The question asks *which languages were influenced by Sanskrit*, and the passage directly states Sanskrit is related to Indo-European languages, and the passage states, ""ko ia hoki te reo taketake o ngā tini reo Īniana o nāianei, pērā i te reo Rātini hei reo taketake mō ngā reo Ūropi pērā i te reo Wīwi me te reo Pāniora."" which translates to ""it is also the ancestral language of many modern Indian languages, similar to how Indo-European is the ancestral language of European languages such as English and Spanish."" Therefore, it's referring to the Indo-European language family as a whole, and the provided answer of ""Ngā reo Rātini"" (Indo-European languages) is the most accurate.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i whakahekea te whakamahinga o te Sanskrit nā te aha?","The correct answer is **A: Matatinitanga (Decline/Diminishment)**.

The passage states: ""Whai muri mai i te whakahiatotanga o Upanishards, e memeha noa iho a Sanskrit i ngā mahi nahanaha."" This translates to ""After the establishment of the Upanishads, Sanskrit simply declined in practical use.""

Therefore, the reason for the decline in Sanskrit's usage is **matatinitanga** (decline/diminishment).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tauākī tika e pā ana ki te tō ā-papa i Io?","The correct answer is **A: Ka iti ake te kaha o te whenua ki a koe i te kaha o Io** (The force of the earth is less on you than on Io).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ki te tū koe i runga i te mata o Io kua iti ake tō taumaha tēnā i tō taumaha ki runga o Papatūānuku.""  This translates to ""If you stood on the surface of Io, your weight would be less than your weight on Earth.""
* The reason for this is the difference in gravitational pull. Io's gravity is weaker than Earth's.  Therefore, the force of gravity acting on you is less.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka nui ake te kukume a te taumaha o te mea, koia koe ka iti ake ai te** (The weight of the object's grip will increase, so you will be less): This doesn't make sense in the context.  Weight is a force, not a grip.
* **C: He nui ake te kume o te tō ā-papa o Io, koia koe ka nui ake tō pauna** (The gravity of Io's surface is greater, so your weight will be greater): This contradicts the passage which states Io has *less* gravity.
* **D: Ka kaha ake te kaha o te whenua ki a koe i te kaha o Io** (The earth's force is greater on you than on Io): This is the opposite of what the passage indicates.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te apa whakawaho o te Marama?","The correct answer is **A: He matotoru ake te kiri o te taha tata**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""He tata ki te 70 km te mātotoru o te kirinuku ki te taha tata, ā, e 100 km te mātotoru ki te taha tawhiti."" (The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side, and 100 km thick on the far side.)
* It also mentions: ""Ka nui ake pea te maria ki te taha tata i te mea he kōrahirahi ake te kirinuku."" (The sea may be larger on the near side because the crust is thinner.)
* This implies that the *thickness* of the crust is less on the near side (taha tata), allowing the sea to be larger. Therefore, the crust on the near side is thicker than on the far side.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He māmā ake te kiri i raro i ngā whenua teitei** (The crust is thinner beneath higher lands): The passage doesn't provide any information about crust thickness beneath higher lands.
* **C: Tērā pea he iti ake ngā maria i te taha tua atu** (The seas are perhaps smaller on the far side): The passage suggests the opposite - that the sea *might* be larger on the near side.
* **D: Tērā pea he iti iho ngā maria i raro i ngā whenua teitei** (The seas are perhaps smaller beneath higher lands): Similar to B, the passage doesn't give any information on this topic.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea te kirinuku o te Marama te mātotoru rawa?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te taha tata**.

The passage states: ""He tata ki te 70 km te mātotoru o te kirinuku ki te taha tata..."" which translates to ""It's approximately 70 km thick of crust on the near side..."".
"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ēnei e whakaponotia ana e ētahi tāngata?","The correct answer is **C: Kei ētahi atu aorangi te ora**.

The passage states: ""...ka whai whakaarohia e ētahi tāngata he aha kei waho rā kei te whakapono ētahi he tautangata, he koiora anō kei te noho pea kei tētahi atu aorangi.""  This translates to: ""...some people wonder what's out there, and some believe that there are people, or even creatures, living on other planets.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kua haere ngā tāngata ki ētahi atu whetū (People have already gone to other stars):** The passage says this hasn't happened yet (""mehemea ka hua mai tēnei kāore e hua mai i roto i te wā tata nei"" - if this happens, it won't happen in the near future).
* **B: Kāore e taea e te tangata te tūhura i ētahi atu ao (People can't create other worlds):** The passage doesn't discuss the creation of worlds.
* **D: He iti iho i te piriona kiromita te tawhiti i waenganui i ngā whetū (The distance between stars is only a few billion kilometers):** The passage explicitly says the distance is ""tini tiriona māero"" (trillions of kilometers).



"
He aha te mea ka māmā ake i a koe e neke atu ana i te pokapū o te Rā?,"The correct answer is **D: Kirinuku**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te wāhanga ki waho e kitea ana e tātou i te tiro atu ki te Rā e kīia ana ko te photosphere, **tōna tikanga ko te ""pōro o te tūrama""**.""  The translation of ""pōro o te tūrama"" is **""corona of radiation""** or ""corona of light"".

Therefore, the layer that is visible when looking at the Sun is the corona, and it is described as the ""corona of radiation"" or light. The passage indicates that the sun is made up of fire, heat and radiation and the corona is the outermost layer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Taitoto (Chromosphere):** The chromosphere is a layer of the Sun's atmosphere *below* the photosphere.
*   **B: Ahi (Fire):** While the Sun *contains* fire (nuclear fusion), it's not the outermost layer.
*   **C: Korohū (Heat):** Like fire, heat is part of the Sun, but not the layer visible as the corona.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhanga o te rā e kitea ana i te Whenua?","The correct answer is **A: Te kirinuku (photosphere)**.

The passage states: ""Ko te wāhanga ki waho e kitea ana e tātou i te tiro atu ki te Rā e kīia ana ko te photosphere..."" which translates to ""The part we see when looking at the Sun is called the photosphere...""
"
Ko tehea o ngā kitenga e whai ake nei i āwhina ki te whakapumautia i te ariā a Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **B: He whakawhiti o Venus (Transits of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **Galileo's observations of the phases of Venus** were crucial in supporting Copernicus's heliocentric model. The phases of Venus (like the Moon) could only be explained if Venus orbited the Sun.
* **Transits of Venus**, observed by Jeremiah Horrocks and others, provided even more precise data to calculate the size of the solar system and further confirmed the heliocentric model.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko ngā wāhanga o Venus (Phases of Venus)** - While Galileo's observations of Venus's phases *helped* support the heliocentric model, the question asks which observation *directly* confirmed it.
* **C: Ko ngā ōritetanga o te Rā ki a Venus (Sunspots on Venus)** - Sunspots were interesting but didn't directly confirm the heliocentric model.
* **D: Ngā ritenga o te Rā ki te Marama (Transits of the Sun across the Moon)** - Transits of the Sun across the Moon (solar eclipses) were known long before Copernicus and didn't directly support his model.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei mea i kitea e Galileo Galilei i te tau 1610?,"The correct answer is **A: He taha o te Marama e anga ana ki te Rā (A moon of Jupiter that orbits the Sun)**.

Here's why:

* The prompt states Galileo used a telescope in 1610 and observed ""mata ā Kōpū, pērā i ā te marama"" (moons like the Moon). 
* It further clarifies that these moons appeared to orbit Jupiter, not the Earth.
* Option A accurately reflects this observation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko ngā wāhanga o Venus (Phases of Venus):** While Galileo *did* observe the phases of Venus, the question specifically asks what he observed in 1610. The passage focuses on the moons of Jupiter.
* **C: E huri ana te ao i te Rā (The Earth revolves around the Sun):** Galileo's observations *supported* Copernicus's heliocentric theory, but he didn't directly observe the Earth revolving around the Sun in 1610. He observed the moons of Jupiter orbiting Jupiter, which was a key piece of evidence for the heliocentric model.
* **D: He whakawhiti o Venus (A transit of Venus):** Transits of Venus are rare events that occur when Venus passes between the Earth and the Sun. Galileo didn't observe one in 1610. Jeremiah Horrocks observed one later, in 1639.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, no hea te awa o Amazon e kohi wai ai?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā awa iti ake (Smaller rivers)**.

The text states: ""Kei te kohi ia i te wai mai i ngā tini mano awa iti iho"" which translates to ""It gathers water from countless smaller rivers.""
"
Ko tēhea accolade ehara i te take ki te Awa o Amazon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te awa tuarua te roa** (The second longest river).

Here's why:

The passage states the Amazon is the *second longest* river in the world. Options B, C, and D all accurately reflect information presented in the text:

*   **B: Ko te awa nui rawa tēnei** (This is the largest river) - The passage says it carries 20% of the world's river water to the oceans, indicating its vastness.
*   **C: Ko te awa tino roa tēnei** (This is the longest river) - The passage explicitly states it's the second longest.
*   **D: Ko te awa tino whanui** (This is the widest river) - The passage states it has a width of six miles.

Therefore, the statement that it's the *second longest* is already stated as a fact in the passage, making it an accurate descriptor, not an accolade *about* the Amazon. It's simply a definition of its rank.
"
Ko tehea rārangi mahi e whakahuatia ana i roto i te wāhanga e mahi ana i te iti rawa o nga Venezuelan?,"The correct answer is **A: Ahuwhenua**.

The text states: ""Tekau mā waru paehēneti o te hunga nō Wenehūera kāore he mahi a rātou, ā, ko te nuinga o te hunga he mahi ā rātou e mahi i roto i te ohaoha ōpaki. He rua hautoru Venezuela e mahi āna kei roto i te wāhanga ratonga, tata ki te koata ka mahi ki roto i te ahumahi, ā, he haurima kei roto i te ahuwhenua.""  This translates to: ""Ten out of twenty-two Venezuelans are unemployed, and most of those who do work work in the informal sector. Two-thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector, close to the limit and work in the industrial sector, and there is a boom in the agricultural sector.""

Therefore, the agricultural sector (ahuwhenua) is mentioned as having a boom, implying it's where the fewest Venezuelans are employed.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā wāhanga e whai ake nei e whakamahi ana i te nuinga nui rawa o ngā Venezuelan?","The correct answer is **B: Ahuwhenua (Agriculture)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ko te nuinga o te hunga he mahi ā rātou e mahi i roto i te ohaoha ōpaki"" which translates to ""the majority of them work in the dark industries"" and ""...he rua hautoru Venezuela e mahi āna kei roto i te wāhanga ratonga, tata ki te koata ka mahi ki roto i te ahumahi"" which translates to ""...two thirds of Venezuelans work in the service sector, close to the limit and work in agriculture.""

Therefore, agriculture is the sector where the largest proportion of Venezuelans are employed.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te hononga e āhei ai ngā whetū ki te mahi?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā huānga taumaha puka (Nuclear reactors)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that stars produce energy through nuclear fusion in their cores.
* Nuclear fusion is the process of combining atomic nuclei to release energy.
* Nuclear reactors on Earth utilize nuclear fusion (or fission) to generate electricity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hangaia nga reactors hanumi (Building fusion reactors):** While scientists are trying to create fusion reactors, the passage discusses *how* stars currently produce energy, not how we might replicate it on Earth.
* **C: Hoatu te mārama me te wera (Providing light and heat):** While stars provide light and heat, the passage focuses on the *source* of their energy (nuclear fusion).
* **D: Waihanga ngota hauwai (Creating hydrogen stars):** Stars *are* hydrogen stars, but the passage is about the energy *production* process, not the star's composition.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai hua ana hei hanga i tētahi pūkaha pūtaiao?,"The correct answer is **A: Hauwai (Water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the speaker is talking about producing electricity by using **water** to power turbines. The passage also mentions that scientists are trying to create a similar power source but it's a difficult problem. This implies hydropower is the source of electricity being discussed. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā Whetū (Stars)**: While stars produce energy, they are not a practical source for generating electricity on Earth.
* **C: Ngota (Light)**: Light is a form of energy, but the passage isn't discussing using light to generate electricity. It discusses using water.
* **D: Pūngao (Fuel/Resources)**: ""Pūngao"" is too broad. The passage specifically talks about water as the resource.



"
He aha te hanganga matū o te wai?,"The correct answer is **D: E rua ngā ngota hauwai me te ngota hāora kotahi**.

The text states: ""Ko te pūhui wai ki ngā ngota hauwai e rua, me te ngota hāora kotahi."" which translates to ""The water swirl is made of two white reeds and one living reed.""
"
"Ka huri ngā āhua o te wai, he aha te mea ka noho tonu?","The correct answer is **C: Āhua Ōkiko (Constant Shape)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Heoi anō kei tīni te āhuatanga ā-kiko, ko te āhuatanga o te matū ka rite tonu."" This translates to: ""Even though there is a change in form, the characteristic of the shape remains the same.""

Therefore, even though water can take different forms (solid, liquid, gas), the shape of the ""rāpoi ngota"" (water molecule arrangement) remains constant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hanganga rāpoi ngota (water molecule arrangement):** While the arrangement is constant, the passage is asking for what *remains* constant across different forms, not the arrangement itself.
*   **B: Kiato:** This is not relevant to the passage.
*   **D: hauota wai (water vapor):** Water vapor is just one form of water; the question asks what remains constant across *all* forms.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te take mō ngā kāwanatanga tekau mā toru i te wa e ngana ana ki te whakatakoto i ētahi ture?","The correct answer is **A: Te arotahi kaha a ngā mana ā-iwi (The power of the states)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Articles of Confederation had a weak central government because the states retained significant power and were reluctant to cede authority to the national government. This reluctance to relinquish power *prevented* the central government from effectively enacting laws.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reasons:

* **B: He kore mana i roto i te Whare Pāremata (No power in the Congress):** The passage states the Congress lacked the power to levy taxes and didn't have a national executive to enforce laws, directly linked to the weak central government.
* **C: Ko ngā whakarerekētanga e hiahiatia ana he whakaaetanga kotahi (Each state required one vote):** The passage mentions that each state's vote was equal, meaning a minority of states could block legislation, hindering the national government's ability to act.
* **D: He mana whakahaere ā-motu kāore e wātea ana (No national executive was authorized):**  The passage explicitly mentions the lack of a national executive as a weakness, further contributing to the inability to enforce laws.



Therefore, the strength of the states and their unwillingness to give up power was the fundamental reason the Articles of Confederation struggled to make laws.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea kōrero e whakaatu tika ana i te āhua o te kāwanatanga pokapū i te wā o te Pakanga Whakawhitiwhiti?","The correct answer is **A: I whakaūtia nga tāke e nga mana o te Rōpū Nui me nga mana kāwanatanga.**

Here's why:

The passage describes the Articles of Confederation as having weaknesses. It specifically mentions:

* **Lack of power to tax:** This highlights a weakness in the central government's ability to fund itself and operate effectively.
* **No executive or judicial branch:** This indicates a lack of a strong central authority to enforce laws and resolve disputes.
* **Reliance on state cooperation:** This proves the central government lacked real power and depended on the goodwill of the states, which was unreliable.
* **States often ignored federal laws:** This shows the central government's weakness and inability to enforce its authority.

All of these weaknesses demonstrate a struggle between the powers of the states (the ""states' rights"") and the central government (the ""federal government""). The passage emphasizes this tension and the central government's inability to effectively assert its authority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I whakawhirinaki ngā whakarerekētanga ki ngā Tuhinga ki te mana o te Kaunihera:** The passage actually *criticizes* the Articles of Confederation and their impact on the central government's power, not praises them.
* **C: Kāore ngā māngai kāwanatanga i tae atu:** The passage does not mention whether representatives attended or not. The key point is the weaknesses of the Articles themselves.
* **D: E rua ngā wāhanga matua o te kāwanatanga pokapū:** While the passage mentions the lack of executive and judicial branches, it doesn't explicitly state that there *were* two main branches; rather, it emphasizes their absence in the Articles of Confederation.



"
Me pēhea te tuhi i ngā kupu i te taha o muri o te Whakapuakanga Mātauranga?,"The correct answer is **A: I roto i te momotuhi nui (On large paper)**.

The passage states: ""Nā, e tinga ana i tāpiritia noatia te tuhinga hei tapa."" This translates to ""Therefore, the writing was transferred to parchment."" Parchment is a type of thick, durable paper. The passage also describes the size of the paper as large (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches), suggesting it wasn't a small format.  Therefore, it was written on large paper.



"
Ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei e mōhiotia ana a Singapore?,"The correct answer is **A: Kākāriki Taone (Garden City)**.

The text explicitly states that the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped turn Singapore into a ""Garden City"" and that Vanda Miss Joaquim was chosen as the national flower. This directly relates to Singapore being known as a Garden City.
"
He aha te Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **B: He putiputi (A flower)**.

The text states: ""I te tau 1981, i kōwhiritia a Vanda Miss Joaquim, arā ko tētahi momorua māika, hei pua ā-motu o te whenua."" This translates to ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, which is a beautiful orchid, was designated as the national flower of the country."" Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is an orchid (putiputi).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te kounga o ngā pirimeti o Giza e kore e miharo ki ngā Ihipiana o te Emepaea Hou?","The correct answer is **C: to rātau rahi (their size)**.

The passage states: ""I mīharo ngā tāngata Īhipa tawhito New Kingdom ki ngā tohu whakamaumahara o ō rātou tūpuna, i taua wā ka nui ake i te kotahi mano tau te tawhito. **I mīharo ngā tāngata Īhipa tawhito New Kingdom ki ngā tohu whakamaumahara o ō rātou tūpuna, i taua wā ka nui ake i te kotahi mano tau te tawhito. Kore rawa i pahika ngā koeko o Giza i te rahi me te kounga hangarau o te hanganga.**""

This translates to: ""The people of the Old Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, at that time more than a thousand years old. **The pyramids of Giza were not built with the size and technical quality of construction.**""

The passage explicitly says that the pyramids of Giza were *not* impressive in size and technical quality, implying that the size *was* impressive, but the construction quality was not up to par.  Therefore, the Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the **size** of the Giza pyramids.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nō whea ngā kai otaota e haere mai ana ki te whai i ngā ua?","The correct answer is **D: Nga maunga ki te uru (Mountains to the north)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ia tau i te wāhanga o te Oketopa ka haere atu te rahinga tata ki te 1.5 miriona kaiota ki ngā papatairite o te tonga, e whakawhiti nei i te Mara River mai i ngā **puke** ki te **raki** mō ngā ua.""  This translates to: ""Around October, the floodwaters travel 1.5 million hectares to the northern plains, flowing across the Mara River from the **mountains** to the **north** for the rains.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te rohe e wehe atu ai ngā kai otaota i tētahi wā i te marama o Āperira?","The correct answer is **A: Te rohe Serengeti**.

The passage states: ""Kei te takiwā Serengeti te Serengeti National Park, te Ngorongoro Conservation Area me te Maswa Game Reserve ki Tānahia, me te Maasai Mara National Reserve ki Kēnia.""  This directly indicates that the Serengeti region is where the animals migrate at that time.
"
He whakaekenga a Operation Sealion ki tēhea whenua?,"The correct answer is **B: Britain**.

The text states: ""I te mutunga o te pakanga mō Wīwī, i tīmata a Tiamani te whakarite kia eke i te motu o Peretānia."" (At the end of the war for WWI, Germany started preparing to invade the island of Britain.)

Therefore, Operation Sealion was a planned invasion of **Britain**.
"
He aha te ingoa o Tiamana mo te whakaeke ki Britain?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakahaere Sealion**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ko te nuinga o ngā taputapu whawhai o Piritania i ngaro i te wehenga o Dunkirk, nō reira i āhua ngoikera ai te tauā. Engari i kaha tonu ake te Royal Navy i te German Navy (""""Kriegsmarine"""", ā, kua taea te turaturaki i te kāhui whakaeke ka tukuna mai i te English Channel ahakoa tēhea. Heoi anō, he iti noa ngā kaipuke Royal Navy tata ki ngā ara eke e tinga ana nā te mataku a ngā atimira ka totohu pea i te eke ā-hau Tiamani."" and ""I te mutunga o te pakanga mō Wīwī, i tīmata a Tiamani te whakarite kia eke i te motu o Peretānia. I whakaingoatia munangia e Tiamani te āki ki te """"Operation Sealion""""""

Therefore, ""Operation Sealion"" was the German plan to invade Britain.
"
He aha te mea e kore e whakahuatia hei taahiraa e hiahiatia ana i roto i te mahere a Itari ki te hopu i nga whenua o Awherika?,"The correct answer is **D: Te whakangaro i ngā turanga o Ingarangi (To destroy the British bases)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mō tēnā, i peia atu e rātou ngā hanganga me ngākaipuke nō Peretānia ki Īhipa. Hāunga aua mahi, tōna tikanga me kaua ngā waka tauā a Itari e paku aha atu."" This translates to: ""For that, they attacked the constructions and ships of Britain in Egypt. As a result of that action, the British methods and naval ships were prevented.""

The passage implies that the goal of attacking British bases in Egypt was to prevent Britain from interfering with Italy's ambitions in Africa.  The other options are actions *taken* by Italy, not things they aimed to *destroy* as a prerequisite.

Therefore, the destruction of British bases is the missing element in Italy's plan for conquering African territories, according to the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take tuatahi o Itari mo te whawhai?","The correct answer is **A: Te hopu i ngā whenua o Āwherika**.

The passage clearly states: ""Ngā whāinga matua a Itaria ko ō Awherika whenua. Kia riro i ēnā whenua me hanga he papa whakarere mō ngā hōia kia pai ai te rere i te moana Mediterranean me te tomo i a Awherika."" (Italy's main goals were the lands of Africa. To obtain these lands and build a staging ground for troops to allow for better movement in the Mediterranean Sea and to enter Africa.)
"
Ko wai i whakapūmau i ngā whanaungatanga hoa ki ngā kaiwhawhai?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Wīwī Vichy**.

The passage states: ""He tangata Wīwi ēnei i hou te rongo me ngā Tiamani i te 1940, ā, i mahi tahi me ngā kaiwhawhai tēnā i te whawhai i a rātou."" This translates to: ""These were Vichy French people who welcomed the Germans in 1940, and they worked alongside the fighters in their fight.""

Therefore, the Vichy French established alliances with the fighters.
"
Ko wai nga Allies i roto i te Mahi Tarakona?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko ngā Amerikana me ngā Wīwī Koreutu**.

The passage states: ""I roto i ngā wiki e rua noa i wetekina e ngā Amerikana **me ngā hōia Wīwī Free French** te tonga o Wīwī..."" 

Therefore, the Allies involved in the campaign in Normandy (specifically Operation Dragoon) included the Americans and the Free French forces.  ""Wīwī Koreutu"" translates to ""Free French"".



"
Na te whanaketanga o te hangarau i tīmata ai ngā kaipuke moana ki te haere i raro i te wai?,"The correct answer is **C: Te Whakatere (Submerging)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the development of submarine technology (""te hanga mai o te irirangi whakaata"" - the creation of diving planes) allowed U-boats to submerge and remain underwater.
* The question asks *when* ships started going underwater, and the passage directly links this to the development of submarine technology.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U-Boats:** U-boats are the *type* of submarine, not the technology itself.
* **B: Te awhe pupuhi (The Pump):** Pumps are part of a submarine's system, but the development of diving planes is the key technological advancement enabling submersion.
* **D: Hihiani (The Hail):** Hail is irrelevant to the question.



"
"I te wā o to rātau whakamahinga tuatahi, he iti rawa te whānuitanga o ngā kaipuke moana i roto i tehea rohe?","The correct answer is **A: Te whakatere**.

The passage states: ""I hautū ngā waka whakatakere i te Pakanga Tuatahi/Tuarua o te Ao. I ērā rā he pōturi ngā waka nei, ā, kāore nei e tino whānui te pūhitanga o ngā pū."" This translates to: ""Submarines were used in the First/Second World War. These submarines were small, and the range of their propulsion was not very large.""

The word ""pūhitanga"" refers to the range or extent of something, and the passage specifies the ""pūhitanga o ngā pū"" (range of propulsion) was not very large. This implies a limited operational *area*, which is best described as **Te whakatere** (The seas/ocean). The other options don't fit the context:

*   **Haereere** (Travel) is too general.
*   **Te pupuhi** (Protection) is not related to the range of submarines.
*   **whakahaere** (Management) is also not relevant.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i tūkino te whakaaetanga? ","The correct answer is **D: Te Soviets**.

The passage states that the Soviet Union invaded Poland and Ukraine, violating treaties. This indicates the Soviets initiated the aggression, thus initiating the breakdown of the agreement.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i mahia e te Rōpū Whero?,"The correct answer is **A: Te hanganga o tētahi mua Ākarana (Establishing a puppet government)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage details the Soviet invasion of Poland, violating treaties and occupying territory. The key actions listed as *done* by the Soviets are:
    *   Occupying western Polish territories.
    *   Breaking the Riga Peace Treaty.
    *   Breaking the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact.
    *   Deploying a large army.
*   The question asks what the Soviets *did not* do. Establishing a puppet government was a common tactic used by the Soviet Union in occupied territories, but it's not explicitly mentioned as something they did in Poland according to the text.  The other options *are* directly implied by the text:
    *   **B: He whakaekenga o nga rohe ki te rāwhiti (Occupation of western territories):** The passage clearly states the Soviets occupied western Poland.
    *   **C: He whakarerekētanga i te taha o te rori (Shift in the balance of power):** The invasion and occupation fundamentally shifted the balance of power in Europe.
    *   **D: He Hara Tiriti (Violation of treaties):** The passage explicitly mentions multiple treaties violated by the Soviets.



Therefore, the only option that isn't supported by the passage is the establishment of a puppet government.



"
He aha te mea i tupu ki te Engineer-i-Chief o te Italian Tenth Army?,"The correct answer is **A: I hopukina a ia i Fort Capuzzo**.

The passage states: ""Tētahi manukāwhaki ki te rāwhiti o Bardia, i mau i a Peretānia te Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief nō Itāria, **General Lastucci, i Fort Capuzzo**."" This translates to: ""A raid west of Bardia, the British captured the Tenth Army's Engineer-in-Chief for Italy, **General Lastucci, at Fort Capuzzo**.""
"
I hea i patua ai a Italo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""Nō te 28 o Hune, nā ngā pū i Tobruk i mate ai a Marshal Italo Balbo..."" which translates to ""On June 28th, Marshal Italo Balbo died in the shelling of Tobruk...""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā pūkenga e whai ake nei he wāhi hira o te whakaaroaro o Tibetan?","The correct answer is **C: kitenga ana i ngā Atua (Deity Yoga)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te pokapū o te whakatau whakaaro Tipete ko te Deity Yoga. **Mā te whakaaro ā-ataata ki ngā tini atua ka whakawāteatia ngā ia ngoi, ka kāngia ngā hakara (chakra), ā, ka hangaia te māramatanga.**"" (The center of Tibetan meditative practice is Deity Yoga. Through contemplating the various deities, the energies are awakened, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment is achieved.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whakatinana i ngā whakangungu manawa (Practicing physical exercises):** While physical postures (asanas) are a part of Kundalini Yoga (mentioned in the passage), the passage *doesn't* say they are a core element of Tibetan meditation.
* **B: Ngā mahi tukurua (Ritual practices):**  Rituals *are* part of Tibetan Buddhism, but the passage focuses on Deity Yoga as the central meditative practice.
* **D: Ngā Poutāpeta o te ioka matua (The teachings of the primary yoga):** While Tibetan Buddhism has roots in Yoga, the passage specifically highlights Deity Yoga as its central meditative focus, distinguishing it somewhat from the broader ""teachings of primary yoga.""

"""E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me pehea te mahi o nga chakras i roto i te """"pokapū"""" o te whakaaroaro Tibetan?""","The correct answer is **B: Mā te kite i ngā atua**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko te pokapū o te whakatau whakaaro Tipete ko te Deity Yoga. **Mā te whakaaro ā-ataata ki ngā tini atua ka whakawāteatia ngā ia ngoi, ka kāngia ngā hakara (chakra), ā, ka hangaia te māramatanga.**"" 

This directly translates to: ""The center of Tibetan meditative practice is Deity Yoga. **Through contemplating the various deities, the energies are activated, the chakras are stirred, and enlightenment is attained.**""

Therefore, the text explicitly links the activation and stirring of chakras to the practice of visualizing and contemplating deities.



"
Ko wai i whakatangi i te waiata tapu tuarua i te hōtaka?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju Sharma**.

The text states: ""I tīmata te kaiwaiata a Sanju Sharma i taua pō, whai muri mai ko Shankar Choudhary."" which translates to ""Sanju Sharma started singing that evening, followed by Shankar Choudhary.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i whakatakoto he waiata whakangākau i te wā o te whakahere kai?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Ki tōna taha ko te kaiwaiata a Raju Khandelwal. Ki tōna taha ko Lakkha Singh te kaiwaiata matua mō te waiata bhajans."" (Along with him was the singer Raju Khandelwal. And along with him was Lakkha Singh the main singer for the bhajan songs.) This indicates Lakkha Singh performed the chhappan bhog bhajan.
"
He aha te whakaaturanga tuarua whakamutunga o te ahiahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ahi o Anatolia**.

The passage states: ""Hei whakamutunga, nā te rōpū kanikani o Tākei a Fire of Anatolia i whakaatu i te whakaaturanga """"Troy""""."" This translates to ""To conclude, the Turkish musical group Fire of Anatolia performed the show """"Troy"""".""

Therefore, Fire of Anatolia (Ahi o Anatolia) was the last performance.
"
He aha te iwi o Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **D: Reo Itāria**.

The text states ""me l'Italiana Alessandro Safina,"" which directly translates to ""and the Italian Alessandro Safina."" Therefore, Alessandro Safina is Italian.
"
"I runga anō i tēnei wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei ehara i te mea pono?","The correct answer is **B: I mau nga tāngata ki runga i te takutai hurihuri.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""I hoatungia te wai ki ngā pāhihi i a rātou e tatari ana i roto i te weranga 90(f)-tākiri."" (Water was sprayed on the bushes where they were waiting in the 90(f)-tākiri zone). This confirms C is true.
* **The passage states:** ""...manawarau te tangata i te mau ki tētahi waka rōnaki ahakoa te roa o te wā..."" (...people were stuck in a rowboat no matter how long...). This confirms that people were in a rowboat, not the beach. Therefore, B is false.
* **The passage states:** ""...kotahi hāora i te itinga iho te wā kia puta atu te tangata tuatahi i te waka."" (One hour later the first person got out of the boat). This confirms D is true.
* **The passage mentions:** ""He rā wera i Santa Clara me te pūmahana i tae ki ngā 90."" (It was a hot day in Santa Clara and the temperature reached 90). This confirms A is true.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i kōrero e pā ana ki te taumata wera haumaru?","The correct answer is **B: Te kāpene ahi (Fire Chief)**.

The text explicitly states: ""I kī te rangatira o te ahi a Scott Kouns..."" which translates to ""Fire Chief Scott Kouns said..."". 

Therefore, the fire chief is the one who made the statement about the heat levels.
"
I hea i puta ai te mate hiko nā te mahi o te tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""...heoi i ngaro te hiko, ā, nā tenei i ngaro hoki te kaha kia rongo ai i te ohoreretanga mai i te PTWC e pā ana ki te tsunami."" This translates to ""...however, power was lost, and this in turn meant there was no power to receive warnings from the PTWC regarding the tsunami."" This happened in Tonga.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i pēhea te pānga o Tonga e te Outage hiko?","The correct answer is **D: Kāore i taea e ngā mana whakahaere te whiwhi i ngā whakatūpato e hāngai ana.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...heoi i ngaro te hiko, ā, nā tenei i ngaro hoki te kaha kia rongo ai i te ohoreretanga mai i te PTWC e pā ana ki te tsunami.""  This directly translates to: ""...however, the power went out, and this meant they lost the ability to hear the alerts from the PTWC regarding the tsunami.""

Therefore, the outage prevented them from receiving the alerts. Option D best reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tērā ētahi tūkinotanga i pūrongotia:**  The passage doesn't mention any initial warning signs being reported.
*   **B: Kāore ngā mana whakahaere i whiwhi kōrero mō ngā whakatūpato kua tangohia:** The passage mentions the alerts *not* being received, but doesn't say they were given prior warning of the alerts themselves.
*   **C: I pāngia ngā pānuitanga taumata moana:** The passage focuses on the *loss of ability to receive alerts*, not the impact on sea level warnings.



"
Nō whea i taea ai e te pirihimana te whakamahi i ō rātou pupuhi radar hei tātai i te tere o te taraiwa a Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **A: I a ia e taraiwa ana i te 160km/h**.

The text states: ""...ko te wā anake i oti i ngā pirihimana te ine i Matua Reid ko te wā i heke tana pōturi ki te 160km/h."" This directly indicates the police were able to measure his speed *when he was driving at 160km/h*.
"
"E ai ki te whārangi, he aha i uaua ai te pirihimana o Aotearoa ki te whakarite i te tere o Jonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: I te taraiwa a ia i raro i te 160km/h**.

The passage states: ""ko te wā anake i oti i ngā pirihimana te ine i Matua Reid ko te wā i heke tana pōturi ki te 160km/h."" This means the police took a moment to realize his speed *after* he had reached 160km/h. Therefore, the difficulty was in identifying his speed *at* 160km/h. The other options are not supported by the text."
He aha te wāhi o te rū e pā ana ki Butte?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 maire ki te tonga**.

The text states: ""me te tata ki te tonga o Butte"" which translates to ""and approximately south of Butte"".  40 miles is approximately equal to 65 kilometers. Since the question asks about the distance ""to the south"", and option B provides ""40 miles to the south"" it is the correct answer.
"
He aha i puta i te wa o te tutu i Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Te tukino mauhere (Torture)**.

The passage states the Abu Ghraib prison became infamous *because of* allegations of torture after the US invasion. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Maukati Whakararo (Psychological Warfare):** While psychological warfare might have been part of the broader context, the core issue at Abu Ghraib was the physical and psychological abuse of prisoners.
* **C: I whai mana ngā tōpana o Amerika (The American troops took power):** This is a fact, but not *what happened* during the scandal. It's the preceding event.
* **D: I whakatūria te whare herehere ki runga i te ahi (The prison was set on fire):** There's no mention of the prison being set on fire in the provided passage.



"
He aha i rongonui ai te whare herehere o Iraki? ,"The correct answer is **D: Te kitenga o te tūkinotanga hoa noho (The discovery of friendly torture)**.

The question asks *why* the Abu Ghraib prison became infamous. The infamous aspect of Abu Ghraib was the exposure of abuse and torture of Iraqi prisoners by US soldiers. Options A, B, and C are related to the aftermath, but not the primary reason for the prison's infamy. Option D directly addresses the core reason - the documented torture.



"
He aha te momo huihuinga i tū ki te War Memorial Stadium o Maui?,"The correct answer is **A: Whakaaturanga makutu (Funerary Ceremony)**.

The passage states the event was a ""whakakorea te whakangahau ki te Papa Whakamaumaharatanga ki Maui"" which translates to a memorial service or funerary ceremony at the War Memorial. 

The other options don't fit the context:

*   **B: Ōrite whutupōro (Formal discussion)** - This suggests a more intellectual or debate-oriented event.
*   **C: Konohete (Evening party)** - This is incorrect given the somber nature of a memorial.
*   **D: kaihoko moni (Investors)** - This is completely unrelated to a memorial service.



"
Nā wai i whakamārama e pā ana ki te whakakorenga o te takahanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Te pēne**.

The text states: ""P: I whakakorea te whakangahau ki te Papa Whakamaumaharatanga ki Maui... ā, ka whakapāha atu hoki ki ngā kaitautoko."" This refers to the *pēne* (the person or entity organizing the memorial event).  The text then goes on to say that the *pēne* (the person or entity organizing the memorial) initially didn't give a reason for the postponement.
"
Ko wai te hunga e whakaaro ana ko etahi o nga kainoho o Bishkek te kawenga mo te pahua?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā āpiha whakaū ture (Law enforcement)**.

The text states: ""Ngā kaiporotēhi nō te tonga e te hunga kei Bishkek e noho ana mō ā rātou mahi whakapōauau."" This translates to ""The police in the south are staying in Bishkek for their investigation work.""  ""Whakapōauau"" refers to investigation, and the context implies they are investigating the illegal activities described.  The other options are not mentioned in the passage.
"
Ko wai i whakapae i nga kaiwhakahaere o te tonga mo te parakete?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā tangata whenua o Bishkek (The local people of Bishkek)**.

The passage states: ""Ngā kaiporotēhi nō te tonga e te hunga kei Bishkek e noho ana mō ā rātou mahi whakapōauau."" This translates to: ""The merchants from the east are staying in Bishkek by the people who live there for their security.""  Since the context discusses the situation in Bishkek and the local people are providing security/accommodation, they are the ones facilitating the merchants' presence. The passage doesn't explicitly state they *appointed* the merchants, but they are the local group involved in the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā āpiha whakaū ture (Law enforcement agencies):** The passage describes a situation *outside* the normal legal framework, suggesting law enforcement isn't involved or effective.
* **C: Anarchists:** While the situation might resemble anarchy to some extent, the passage doesn't directly identify the people involved as anarchists.
* **D: Ngā rōpū tāngata (People's groups):** This is too general. The passage specifies the people *in Bishkek*.



"
No hea i nui ake ai te hokohoko o te wheako rīngi?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i tētahi āhua i QVC**.

The passage states: ""I te mutunga o te tau 2017, i kitea a Siminoff ki te hongere pouaka whakaata hoko, ki QVC."" (By the end of 2017, Siminoff found a home on the home shopping channel, QVC.) This directly links increased sales to their appearance on QVC.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I muri i tētahi āhuatanga i Shark Tank:** While Shark Tank did bring attention to Ring, the passage says sales *increased* after QVC.  Shark Tank didn't guarantee immediate sales.
* **B: I muri i te whiwhinga pūtea i te tau 2013:** The passage mentions they didn't receive funding in 2013, and sales increased later.
* **D: I muri i te whakatau i tētahi rīpoata ki te ADT:**  The passage mentions a legal dispute with ADT, but doesn't say it *caused* increased sales. It was a legal action, not a sales driver.



"
I te wā i whakatau ai a Jamie Siminoff ki te tīmata i te Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: Whai muri i te kitenga i tōna pere o te tatau ehara i te mea tika**.

The passage states: ""I tīmata e ia te kamupene i te wā kāore tāna pere kuaha i te rangona mai i tana toa ki tōna karāti."" This translates to ""He started the company when his doorbell wasn't recognized as a success.""  This directly indicates he started Ring *after* realizing his doorbell wasn't a successful product.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I muri i te āhua o Shark Tank i rahua:** The passage states the sales increased *after* the Shark Tank appearance, not that it was the reason he started.
* **C: I muri i te whiwhinga o te pūtea:** The passage mentions the Shark Tank deal didn't result in funding, so this is incorrect.
* **D: Whai muri i te putanga angitu o QVC:**  Ring went to QVC in late 2017, and the passage describes the company's early struggles before that time.
"
I whakawhiwhia e ia wāhanga o Reading Rainbow ngā taunakitanga a ngā tamariki mō te aha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā Pukapuka (Books)**.

The text states: ""Ko ia wāhanga o te terenga ka aro ki te ia o roto i tētahi pukapuka motuhake, ā, ka tuhura i taua ia mā ngā tini pakiwaitara. Ko tā Reading Rainbow hōtaka ngā tautohu pukapuka me rapu e ngā tamariki hei ā rātou taenga atu ki te whare pukapuka."" 

This translates to: ""That part of the program focused on him within a special book, and sparked in them a multitude of interests. The Reading Rainbow program provided book guides and search for children to take to the library.""

Therefore, the program encouraged children's interest in **books**.



"
He aha pea te take i whakakorea ai te raupapa Reading Rainbow?,"The best answer is **A: He iti rawa te pūtea (Lack of funding)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states:  ""...ko te kohinga pūtea me te rerekētanga o te kaupapa ako o te tīwī i oti ai te terenga."" This translates to ""...lack of funding and the changing educational landscape of television led to the end of the program.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: te kore tohu o te Emmy (Lack of Emmy Awards):**  The text mentions he nui ake i te ruatekau mā whā ngā paraihe Emmy, indicating *multiple* Emmy awards, not a lack of them.
* **C: Te whakaaro o Hoani Grant (John Grant's opinion):** While John Grant *did* express a positive opinion, his opinion wasn't the *reason* for the show's cancellation. It was a testament to its success.
* **D: Ko te angitu o Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (The success of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood):** The text compares Reading Rainbow to Mister Rogers' Neighborhood, but it doesn't suggest Mister Rogers' success *caused* Reading Rainbow's cancellation. It's more about the changing television landscape.



Therefore, the lack of funding is the direct reason stated in the passage for Reading Rainbow's end.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te tautohe i puta mai i ngā rangatira o Amsterdam me te whare taonga e pā ana ki te rākau?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te tikanga kia tiakina (The protocol is to protect it)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the museum and city of Amsterdam are *trying to save* the tree due to fungal damage. 
* Option B states the *protocol is to protect it*. This is the *intended* action, not something that *happened*.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Ka hinga tērā (It will die):**  The passage says the fungal damage is severe and the tree needs to be saved, implying it's in danger of dying.
* **C: Kua tāhaetia ki Fungus (It has been infected with fungus):** The passage explicitly states the tree is suffering from fungal damage.
* **D: He mōrearea ki te hauora tūmatanui (It is a major health hazard):** The passage mentions a significant health hazard resulting from the fungal outbreak.



"
"E ai ki tētahi kaitiaki matua mō te RSPCA, he aha te mea e tika ana kia tirohia?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā kāmera CCTCV (CCTV cameras)**.

The text states: ""E tono ana ana te Animal Liberation me te Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) kia whakaturetia te whakatō kāmera CCTV huri rāuna i te whare patu kararehe o Ahitereiria."" This directly translates to ""Animal Liberation and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA) are calling for the installation of rotating CCTV cameras in Australian abattoirs.""

Therefore, the key thing they want to see installed is the CCTV cameras. While the cameras will be used to monitor the workers (B) and the abattoirs (D), the specific request is for the CCTV cameras themselves. ""Ngā tāutanga Surveillance"" (C) is too broad.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina ki te whakakaha i te hiranga o te oranga ora kararehe ki nga kaimahi o Ahitereiria?","The correct answer is **A: Te tāutanga o ngā kāmera CCTV**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ka mātua tukuna e te CCTV tētahi karere kaha ki ngā tāngata e mahi ana ki ngā kararehe ko tō rātou oranga ko te mea nui."" (CCTV will bring a strong deterrent to the people who work with animals, making their welfare a priority.)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā hui whakahau me RSPCA** - While the RSPCA is involved, the text focuses on the CCTV cameras.
*   **C: Ngā tirohanga abattoir auau** - The text is about the installation of cameras, not observations.
*   **D: Tērā pea mai i te ABC** - The ABC is the news source reporting on the story, not the solution to improving animal welfare.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mahi a te tangata i hopukina?","The correct answer is **A: Ākonga (Student)**.

The text states: ""nā tētahi **tāira** e hono ana ki ngā pūhitanga i te 21 o Maehe"" which translates to ""a **student** connected to the protests on May 21st"".



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā e hora ana te rongo mo tētahi atu hopunga, ka puritia nga nehunga mo te tokomaha o nga tūpāpaku?","The correct answer is **A: Kotahi**.

The passage states: ""Tā mōhiotia i tēnei wā he aha rā ngā panonitanga, he aha rānei i whāia te tama nei e ngā mana whakahaere, ka tīmata noa atu ngā whakahaere ki te whare kōti."" This refers to the arrest of **one** teenager, Louis Jourdain.
"
"Hei whakautu ki ngā whakahe, ko tēhea whenua kāore i haere whakamua ki tana kirimana ACTA kua hainatia?","The correct answer is **B: Pōrana**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Poland has been protesting the ACTA agreement.
* The question asks which country *has not* moved forward with ratifying ACTA.
* The passage explicitly mentions Latvia and Slovakia *have* ratified ACTA.
* Therefore, Poland is the one protesting and hasn't ratified it.
* While Germany and Scotland had protests (mentioned in the context of other locations), the passage doesn't say they haven't moved forward with ratification.
* Lithuania is listed as a country where protests occurred, but it also joined the ACTA agreement.

Therefore, Poland is the correct answer.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko ēhea o ngā whenua e whai ake nei i whakatau kia whakatārewa i te tukanga uru ki ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The passage states: ""Ko tōna 200 tāngata i porotēhi i waho atu o ētahi tari pupuri mana ki Rānana. I te marama kua hipa, he nunui ngā porotēhi i Pōrana i te hāinatanga o te ACTA e taua whenua, me te aha kua whakatau ake te kāwanatanga Pōrana kia kauaka te kirimana e whakamana, mō tēnei wā. **Whakaroa tā Latvia me Slovakia whakauru ki te ACTA.**""

This translates to: ""His 200 people protested outside some advocacy offices in Geneva. In the past month, there were large protests in Poland against the ACTA legislation in that country, and what the Polish government has decided is to prohibit the importation of the verifying disk, for this time. **Latvia and Slovakia have joined ACTA.**""

Therefore, Latvia is listed as one of the countries that decided to join ACTA.
"
E hia ngā tāngata i whara i te mutunga o ngā aitua whakawera rawa o te iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""Tata ki te 60 ngā kēhi o ngā iPod turingongengonge e wera rawa ana kua pūrongotia, i reira ka kā ngā ahi e ono, ka pāngia te tokowhā e ngā pāhunu māmā."" This translates to: ""Around 60 defective iPods were reported to be overheating, and six fires broke out, affecting four homes.""

Therefore, the answer is 4.
"
Ko wai i kī ko ngā aitua whakawera nui kāore i tino nui?,"The correct answer is **A: METI**.

The passage states: ""Ko te Minita mō te ohaoha o Hapani, tauhokohoko me te ahumahi (METI) i kī kua mōhio ki ngā aituā e 27 e hono ana ki ngā pūhiko.""  And later, ""Ko te manatū nā te kī atu ko te tinaku a Apple i te pūrongo he """"mea tino kōrehu""""."" This indicates METI was the one who found Apple's response to be unsatisfactory.
"
"I a ia e korero ana, he aha ta Steve Jobs i kii ai ka whakahoutia e Apple?","The correct answer is **B: Te Waea (The Phone)**.

The question asks what Steve Jobs said Apple would update. The text explicitly states: ""I te rā nei ka whakahoungia e Apple te waea..."" which translates to ""Today Apple is updating the phone..."". Therefore, he said they were updating the phone.
"
He aha te take o te kōrero e rua haora a Steve Jobs?,"The correct answer is **B: Hei whakarewa i tētahi rorohiko hou (To reveal new technology)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Steve Jobs was demonstrating the iPhone. 
* The quote ""I te rā nei ka whakahoungia e Apple te waea, ka maumaharatia mō ake tonu atu te rā nei"" translates to ""Today, Apple is reinventing the phone, and it will never be the same again."" This implies a significant technological advancement, not just a new phone model.
* The focus is on the innovation and reimagining of the phone, which points to a new technology.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Hei whakarewa i tētahi papa hou (To reveal a new board):** While the iPhone is a device, ""papa"" usually refers to a board or a panel, which doesn't quite fit the context of a groundbreaking product reveal.
* **C: Hei whakarewa waea hōu (To reveal a new phone):** It's not just a *new* phone; it's a *reinvention* of the phone.
* **D: Hei whakapuaki i tana reti (To promote his network):** The quote doesn't focus on Jobs' personal network or promotion.



"
He aha te korero a Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner i te Whare Tapere o Argentina?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko tōna whakaaro kia oma mo te Senate**.

The passage states: ""I whakapuaki a Mrs. Kirchner i tana takune ki te tono i te tūranga perehitene ki te Argentine Theatre, arā ko te wāhi i whakamahia e ia hei tīmata i tana tautohe i te tau 2005 mō te Senate..."" 

This means she announced her *intention* (takune) to run for the Senate. While she later became President, the initial announcement at the Argentine Theatre was about her candidacy for the Senate.
"
I whakapuaki a Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner i tōna hiahia ki te oma?,"The correct answer is **A: I tētahi whare tapere e 31 maero atu ana i La Plata**.

The question asks where Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner announced her candidacy. The passage states she announced her intention to run for president at the Argentine Theatre, which is located 31 miles (50 kilometers) away from La Plata.
"
He aha ngā kitenga a ACMA e pā ana ki Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **B: I kitea he pāpāho i rokiroki i runga i te paetukutuku a Big Brother**

Here's why:

The question states that ACMA identified something (a video) being streamed on Big Brother's website that potentially violated broadcasting rules. The text doesn't say the rules were broken, but rather that the *streaming* was done improperly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kāore anō kia Takahitia ngā ture whakatau** (Regulations have not yet been unified) - This isn't directly stated in the provided text.
*   **C: Kua pakaru ngā ture whakatau** (Rules have been broken) - The text says Big Brother *didn't* violate the rules because the content wasn't broadcast to the Big Brother platform.
*   **D: I kitea te ihirangi e noho ana i tētahi tūmau** (The content was found on a platform) - While the content was on a platform (Big Brother's website), the core issue, according to the text, is how it was being streamed, not *where* it was being hosted.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate reflection of ACMA's findings based on the provided information.



"
He aha ngā tawhā me āhei ai ngā pāpāho ki te whakaarohia he ihirangi ipurangi?,"The correct answer is **B: Me noho tinana ki runga i te tūmau**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Kei te whakaritea e te Broadcasting Services Act te whakahaerenga o ngā kiko ki te Ipurangi, heoi anō kia whai whakaarohia hei kiko Ipurangi, me noho ā-tinana ki tētahi tūmau."" This translates to: ""The Broadcasting Services Act regulates the operation of broadcasts to the Radio, but consideration must be given to a Radio broadcast, and it must be physically located at a fixed location.""

Option B directly reflects this requirement of physical presence at a fixed location.  The other options are incorrect based on the text.
"
Ko wai te kaiārahi o te Pāti Liberal o Ahitereiria?,"The correct answer is **B: John Howard**.

The text states: ""...ā, ko ia hoki te tāne ka whai pea i a Pirimia John Howard hei kaiārahi pāti Liberal."" This translates to ""...and he was the man who would likely follow Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal party.""
"
He aha i kore ai e whai ahumahi pūngao karihi a Ahitereiria?,"The answer is **A: Kei te kore tautoko tūmatanui (Lacks broad support)**.

Here's why:

The text highlights Peter Costello's strong support for the renewable energy industry and his belief that Australia should embrace it. However, the final sentence states: ""Karekau he whakahē a kaupapa mo te karihi"" which translates to ""There is no opposition to the plan for energy."" This implies that there *is* a lack of broad support, because if there were strong opposition, it would be mentioned. The statement that there is no opposition suggests the plan hasn't gained widespread backing.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: He tautohetohe rawa (Is too complex):** The text doesn't suggest the issue is complex.
* **C: He mōrearea rawa (Is too expensive):** The text doesn't mention cost as a barrier.
* **D: He utu nui rawa (Is too costly):**  Similar to C, cost isn't specifically mentioned as a problem.



"
Ko wai te kaieke ski i whakataetae me te āwhina a tētahi kaiarahi?,"The correct answer is **D: Anna Ogarzynska**.

The passage states: ""Ko te kaiārahi a Anna Ogarzynska i oti tekau mā toru i te Super-G."" This translates to ""Anna Ogarzynska's coach finished in thirteenth in the Super-G."" Therefore, Anna Ogarzynska was the coach who competed and assisted a skier.
"
Ko tēhea whenua i whakaoti i te tekau o ngā whakataetae Super-G mō ngā wāhine e tū ana?,"The correct answer is **A: Whinarana**.

The question asks which country had ten of the women's Super-G competitors. The passage states: ""I oti tekau mā tahi a Mitchell Gourley nō Ahitereiria i te Super-G tū tāne."" (Mitchell Gourley from Australia finished eleventh in the Super-G men's.)

There is no mention of ten women's competitors from any of the listed countries (Australia, Poland, Mexico). However, the question is actually asking which country *women* had ten competitors.  The passage mentions:

*   Anna Jochemsen (Netherlands)
*   Katja Saarinen (Finland)
*   Arly Velasquez (Mexico)

and so on. The question is poorly worded. Looking at the list of women competitors, the country with the most representation is **Netherlands**.

**However, since Netherlands isn't listed as an option, and the question is asking about the *men's* Super-G, then looking at the male competitors, the answer is Australia.**

The question is ambiguous. It is poorly worded. If the question asks about *men's* Super-G, then the correct answer is **C: Australia**. If the question asks about *women's* Super-G, then none of the options are correct.

Because the question asks about women, but it mentions a man competing, and **Australia** is an option, the answer must be **C: Australia.** This is the best possible answer, given the poorly worded question. However, it's important to recognize that the question itself is flawed.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero mo Blake ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **D: I kī a ia kua makaia nga pounamu ki a ia (He said he had recovered the jade to himself)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Blake o te ngana ki te whakatapeha i te rerenga manatika."" (Blake attempted to defend himself against the attack.) This implies he was defending himself, not recovering jade.
* The text mentions he was restrained to ensure his safety from the 30 people.
* There is no mention of jade or him recovering anything.
* While the text does say the prosecutor described his reaction as ""a defiant stance,"" option A (He hopukina a ia i te tirohanga - He was restrained) is directly supported by the text. The other options are not mentioned or implied.



Therefore, option D is the incorrect statement according to the passage."
"I runga anō i te wāhanga, ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei kāore i puta ki a Blake?","The correct answer is **C: I whakaekea ia ki te pou**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Blake was taken into custody and brought to Birmingham Crown Court.** This implies he was detained, but it doesn't mention being tied to a post.
* **The passage explicitly says he was restrained for safety due to the number of people in the courtroom (30).** This implies he was physically restrained, likely by handcuffs or other means, but not tied to a post.
* **The passage mentions he was told he had a ""right to remain silent"" and that his silence would be considered against him.** This aligns with option A.
* **The passage states he was taken into custody, so option B is true.**
* **The passage mentions he was told he might be remanded in custody (sent to jail).** This aligns with option D.

Therefore, the only option not mentioned in the text is being tied to a post.



"
He aha e kore ai e whakamahia te tahua o te UN mō te pāmahana o te ao?,"The correct answer is **D: E whakaiti ana i ngā pānga o te whakamahana o te ao**.

Here's why:

* The prompt states that the UN's plan focuses on **restoring ecosystems** and using **technology to help developing nations grow sustainably on small islands.** It also mentions funding for **water treatment plants, improved water management, and mangrove restoration.** 
* Option D, ""E whakaiti ana i ngā pānga o te whakamahana o te ao,"" is a broad goal that encompasses many actions. While the UN's plan *contributes* to mitigating climate change, the details given focus on adaptation (helping communities cope with the effects) and ecosystem restoration, rather than outright mitigation. 
* Options A, B, and C directly align with the actions described in the prompt:
    * ** whakaputa kai (food production):**  Sustainable food production is crucial for resilience in the face of climate change.
    * **Te kawe i te hangarau ki ngā whenua whanaketanga (transferring technology to developing countries):**  This is a key part of the UN plan, allowing for sustainable development.
    * **Whare whakatika waipuke (water treatment plants):** The prompt specifically mentions funding for water treatment.



Therefore, option D is the least accurate description of what the UN plan *specifically* focuses on, based on the given text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga, he aha te mea e tumanako ana te UN ki te whakaora?","The correct answer is **C: E toe ana i ngā ngahere**.

The passage states: ""Ko ētahi atu kaupapa ki te rārangi take ki Bali ko te whakarauora i ngā ngahere o te ao e toe ana..."" which translates to ""Another agenda item in the Bali agenda is to protect the world's forests...""

While the passage also mentions technology and funding, the *primary* focus of the UN's hope is to protect the forests. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuahia e Albert Muchanga hei mea e hiahiatia ana kia whakaaetia?,"The correct answer is **D: Whakaaetanga utu (Tariff commitments)**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Kāore anō mātou kia whakaae ki ngā ture o te ahunga mai me ngā tukunga tāke hoko tāwāhi, engari ko te pou tarāwaho kei a tātou he rawaka kia tīmata tehokohoko hei te 1 o Hōngongoi, hei te tau 2020"" which translates to ""We are not yet agreeing to the rules of origin and the free circulation of goods, but our anchor is a framework to start trading on July 1, 2020.""

*   This indicates that the *rules of origin* are a point of disagreement, but no mention of *tariff commitments*.

Therefore, Albert Muchanga did not mention tariff commitments as something that needs to be agreed upon."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take e tīmata ai te tauhokohoko i a Hōngongoi?","The correct answer is **C: I whakaaetia e te Komihana Hokohoko me te Ahumahi o AU**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"Kāore anō mātou kia whakaae ki ngā ture o te ahunga mai me ngā tukunga tāke hoko tāwāhi, engari ko te pou tarāwaho kei a tātou he rawaka kia tīmata tehokohoko hei te 1 o Hōngongoi, hei te tau 2020"""" which translates to ""We do not yet agree to the rules of origin and the tariffs for goods, but our anchor is a framework to start trading on July 1, 2020."" This implies the African Union (AU) and the Customs Union (represented by Albert Muchanga) agreed on a framework that allowed trading to start on July 1st.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko te rā tīmatanga o Hōngongoi tētahi wāhanga o ngā tikanga a Nigeria mō te uru atu ki te AfCFTA:** The text doesn't mention Nigeria, it talks about Benin and the AU/Customs Union.
* **B: He nui tonu te anga o ngā ture me ngā mana uru kei te wāhi:** While there are disagreements about rules and tariffs, this doesn't explain *why* trading is starting on July 1st.
* **D: Kua whakaaetia ngā ture takenga mai me ngā whakaaetanga utu:**  The text explicitly states that they *haven't* agreed on rules of origin and tariffs.



Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea i whakapae ai te Atlanta Journal-Constitution ki ngā apiha mātauranga?","The correct answer is **C: Kāore i te mahi i ngā raruraru ā-roto kua kitea.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on ""ngā raru me ngā hua i puta"" (problems and consequences) and specifically mentioned that ""i whakapaetia i kitea ki roto i te kura ngā raru engari kāore i mahi i runga i aua kitenga"" (problems were found in the school but nothing was done about it).
* The passage also states that ""te taunakitanga i whakatau ai kua rāweketia ngā pepa e Hall"" (the recommendation was that Hall's papers were falsified).

This directly supports option C, which says that the problems found were not addressed.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i hoatu i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te mea kihai i whakahuatia i roto i te pūrongo o te Atlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: He taunakitanga kua whakarerekētia ngā pepa whakamātautau.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported on ""the problems and the fallout.""
* It specifically mentions a report claiming ""an impossible increase in test scores"" and that ""test cheating was found in schools but was not acted upon.""
* The passage then states that the board ""determined that Hall had falsified papers, and 34 other educators were implicated in 2013.""

Option B directly reflects this key element of the report – the accusation that test papers were falsified.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: whakapai ake i te tapeke whakamātautau rerekē** (improve the diverse test system) - While the initial goal might have been improvement, the report focuses on cheating, not improvement.
* **C: Te Kaiwhakahaere ā Iwi o te Tau 2013 o te tau toa** (Community Leader of the Year 2013 champion) - This is irrelevant to the scandal reported.
* **D: Ngā huatau mō te whakahou i te mātauranga taone** (contributions to city education renewal) - Again, the focus of the report is on the cheating scandal, not education renewal.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā mōhiohio e mōhiotia ana e whai ana i te poho?","The correct answer is **D: Te tawhiti o te mate whai mana (The extent of the health consequences)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that reports estimate the number of deaths to be ""to the seven"" and official reports align with figures up to 30, but ""final confirmation is not yet available."" This directly addresses the *extent* or *scope* of the health consequences (the number of deaths).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te tatau whara whakamutunga (The final outcome/resolution):**  The passage says final confirmation *isn't* available, so this is incorrect.
* **B: Ko ēhea whare i pakū tata ai nga pomu (Which buildings were hit near):** The passage mentions bombs hit government buildings, but it doesn't focus on *which* specific buildings, only that there were hits.
* **C: Mehemea me whakapakū ētahi atu pomu (Whether more bombs will be dropped):** The passage doesn't discuss future bombings, only what happened.



"
"Mai i tana taunga ki Manchester City i te tau 2017, e hia ngā tukinga i takaro ai a Ihu?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The question asks how many games Jesus has played *since joining Manchester City*. The passage states: ""Mai i taua wā, 53 ngā kēmu kua kitea te tangata nei o Brazil mā te karapu ki ia whakataetae..."" which translates to ""Since that time, this Brazilian man has played 53 games for the club in each match...""
"
Ko tēhea karapu i whiwhi ai a Ihu i te utu £27 miriona mo te hono?,"The correct answer is **A: Palmeiras**.

The text explicitly states: ""Piri atu a Jesus e 21 tau te pakeke ki Manchester City i tērā tau i te Kohitātea o te tau 2017 **mai i te karapu Parihi a Palmeiras**...""  This translates to ""Jesus moved at the age of 21 to Manchester City last year in the summer of 2017 **from the club Sporting Palmeiras**...""  The English name of the club is Palmeiras.
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e pā ana ki ngā manuhiri o te whare noho kore he pono?,"The correct answer is **B: Ehara ētahi manuhiri i te tangata whenua o te rohe.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko te nuinga o ngā manuhiri mai i te hōtēra he kirirarau o te United Arab Emirates."" This directly contradicts option B, which says ""Ehara ētahi manuhiri i te tangata whenua o te rohe"" (No guests are from the local people of the area).  The text explicitly states the majority are from the UAE, which *is* within the region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I Mekaha nga manuhiri mo te noho manene:** (The guests went to Mecca for a comfortable stay) - The text doesn't say anything about the guests going to Mecca specifically for a comfortable stay. It just states they were going to Mecca.
* **C: I reira nga manuhiri mo te ahiahi o Hajj:** (Then the guests were for the evening of Hajj) - The text says they arrived in the evening of the Hajj pilgrimage, which is true.
* **D: Ko te nuinga o nga manuhiri no te taone tapu:** (The majority of the guests are from the holy city) -  This is vague and doesn't directly align with the text. The text specifies they're from the UAE, not the holy city itself.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e pono ana?","The correct answer is **C: I reira ngā manuhiri mō te pō o te haerenga Hajj.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""ta tae mai rātou ki te toro ki te tāone nui tapu i te ahiahi pō o te haerenga ā-hāhi hajj.""  This translates to ""they arrived to visit the holy city in the evening of the group pilgrimage Hajj.""  This directly confirms that the visitors were there for the Hajj pilgrimage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaore he mate kino (There is no illness):** The text states ""te tatauranga mate ko te 15 i te itinga iho"" - meaning ""the disease rate is 15% so far, expected to increase this year.""  This directly contradicts the statement that there is no illness.
* **B: Ko ngā manuhiri katoa nō United Arab Emirates (All the visitors are from the United Arab Emirates):** The text says ""Ko te nuinga o ngā manuhiri mai i te hōtēra he kirirarau o te United Arab Emirates"" - meaning ""The majority of the visitors from the hotel are citizens of the United Arab Emirates.""  It doesn't say *all* visitors are from there.
* **D: Ko te nuinga o nga manuhiri ko nga tangata whenua o Mecca (The majority of the visitors are locals of Mecca):** The text states the majority are from the UAE, not locals of Mecca.



"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, he aha te mōhiohio mo te tutukitanga ehara i te rangirua?","The correct answer is **C: Te pānga o te tūtuki ki te Whenua (The impact of the impact on the Earth)**.

The passage states: ""Ngā kaupūtaiao i rahi te pahūtanga mai nō te tukinga. Kei te whai te United States Strategi Command...i ngā toenga.""  This indicates the scientists are focused on understanding the *impact* of the impact (the meteor hitting Earth).

While the size and speed are mentioned, the main point of the scientists' concern is the effect on the Earth.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha tonu te tikanga kia whakatauria e pā ana ki te tutukitanga?","The correct answer is **C: Me pēhea te tiritahi i ngā hua tātari**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei te whai te United States Strategi Command...i ngā toenga. **Ko te putanga o te tātaritanga ira ka whakairihia ki tētahi pae tukutuku tūmatanui.**"" (The United States Strategic Command...is in the deployments. **The data is being fed into a supercomputer.**)  This indicates that the focus is on analyzing the data *from the impacts* (the data). The passage also mentions that scientists are trying to determine ""pēhea te nui o te tūtukitanga me te āhuatanga ki te pānga hoki ki te ao"" (how much the impact is and the characteristics to the effect on the world). This means the analysis is about understanding the *results* of the impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko wai e whakahaere i te aroturuki otaota** (Who is managing the data analysis): While the US Strategic Command is involved, the passage doesn't specifically detail *who* is doing the analysis, but rather *what* is being analyzed.
* **B: He pēhea te tere o ngā amiorangi i te wā o te tukinga** (What is the speed of the asteroids during the impact): The passage gives the speed of the asteroids, but the main point is not the speed itself, but the overall impact and consequences.
* **D: Te tauine tika o te hinga** (The exact time of impact): The passage doesn't mention the exact timing of the impact.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer because the passage emphasizes analyzing the data and understanding the consequences (the results) of the impact.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhi i puritia e Batten i runga i te rārangi o ngā Kaiāwhina Taunaki rawa?","The correct answer is **C: 190th**.

The text states: ""I noho 190 a Batten ki te rārangi 400 Richest Americans..."" which directly translates to ""Batten ranked 190th on the list of 400 Richest Americans...""
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei i whai ake nei i hoatu e Batten he koha?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Whare Wānanga o Virginia**.

The passage states that Batten was a ""former trustee of the university."" This means he was a benefactor (someone who gives money or support) *to* the university. 

The passage doesn't mention any other specific institutions he donated to. Therefore, the most accurate answer is the university he was a trustee of.
"
He aha te mea kāore i te wāhanga o te pire i hainatia e te Kawana a Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: He aukati i te hoko, i te riihi rānei o ngā kēmu ataata tutu ki ngā tamariki iti i waho o California.**

Here's why:

* The prompt *specifically* states the law applies to games sold *in the state of California*.
* Options A, B, and D all describe aspects of the law *within California*. Option B refers to fines for sellers. Option D mentions ""pākaha"" games which are implied to be those for children.

Therefore, the only option that's *not* part of the law as described is the restriction on games sold *outside* of California.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai i hapa i nga mea e kōrerotia ana?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states: ""Miller... i te whakatika au i a au anō, kāore au i rongo i a ia."" This means Miller took responsibility for something and says he didn't hear about Mike. Therefore, according to this excerpt, Miller is taking the blame or responsibility for something related to the situation.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e pono ana ki te wheako o Miller i te whakarongo?","The correct answer is **B: Kaore a ia i aro atu i a ia e takatū ana.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""he ngutu hohoro a Mike i ngā wā o te whakawātanga... i te whakatika au i a au anō, kāore au i rongo i a ia.""  This means Mike (presumably Duvall is referring to Mike) was talking a lot during the incident, but Miller didn't hear anything about it.  Therefore, Miller wasn't paying attention to what Duvall was saying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I miharo a Duvall ki a Miller i te wā o te whakarongo:** The passage doesn't mention Duvall being surprised by Miller.
* **C: He maha ngā kōrero a ngā tamariki e rua a Duvall i te wā o te whakarongo:** While Duvall mentioned the children's thoughts, the question is about Miller's experience, not Duvall's storytelling.
* **D: I te āta titiro atu a ia ki te pūrākau a Duvall:**  The passage directly states Miller *didn't* hear anything about the incident.  Therefore, he wasn't listening intently to Duvall's story.



"
Nā wai i huatau kia mahia ngā arotakenga ki te 'Ture Hau Mā'?,"The correct answer is **A: John Howard**.

The text states: ""Mua i te hui 25 meneti te roa i te Tūrei ki te kaiārahi NPD a Jack Layton ki te PMO. Kua tono a Layton ki ngā panoni ki te pire taiao o ngā conservatives i te hui ki te Pirimia, i te tono ki tētahi """"tuhinga anō he ngaio, he tukupū"""" o te piri taiao o te pāti Conservative. **Hei tā te Pirimia, tā John Howard, ko te kaupapa o te pire he manaaki i ngā hohipera kia kore ai ō rātou mana e takahia noa e te Kāwanatanga o Tāhimana, e whakawhiwhia ki te AUD$45 miriona.**""

This clearly indicates John Howard, as Prime Minister at the time, was the one promoting the environmental initiative. The text also mentions Howard's view on the policy.
"
"""Ko wai i whakakāhore i te whakamahinga o te """"Ture Hau Mā"""" hei mahi pōti tōmua?""","The correct answer is **B: He Pirimia**.

The passage states: ""Kua whakaae te Pirimia a Stephen Harper ki te tuku i te """"Clean Air Act"""" o te kāwanatanga ki tētahi komiti pāti-katoa hei arotake..."" This directly indicates that Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister, agreed to this.
"
He aha te āhua o te waikawa cyanuric me te melamine i a rātau e mahi tahi ana i roto i te waikura ngeru?,"The correct answer is **C: tioata (crystals)**.

The passage states: ""Ko te hanganga o ēnei tioata ki te mimi ngeru i te tāpiritangao te melamine me te cyanuric acid.""  This translates to ""The formation of these crystals in the litter is melamine and cyanuric acid."" Therefore, the cyanuric acid and melamine form *crystals* in the litter.



"
He aha ngā mea i kitea e ngā kairangahau mā te pūāhua infrared?,"The correct answer is **B: hanganga Crystal i roto i te mimi kararehe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te hanganga o ēnei tioata e hāngai ana ki ērā ka kitea ki te mimi o ngā mōkai e pāngia ana ina ka whakatairitea mā te mātaitanga rārangi aho hihi pōkākā (infrared spectroscopy, FTIR).""

This translates to: ""The formation of these crystals is related to them being found in the bones of affected chickens when identified by infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

Therefore, FTIR was used to detect the *formation of crystals* within the chicken bones. The other options are either too general (A), describe the problem but not the specific finding of the FTIR analysis (C), or are not directly supported by the passage (D).
"
"""Ko wai e kōrero ana ki a Luna ko te """"Queen of Extreme""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Nā Tommy Dreamer i kī """"Ko Luna te Queen of Extreme tuatahi..."""""" which translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said """"Luna is the first Queen of Extreme..."""""""
"""Ko wai e kōrero ana ki a Luna he """"hē""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Ana kaiwhaiwhai**.

The text says Tommy Dreamer called Luna ""the Queen of Extreme"" and a powerful woman. Dustin ""Goldust"" Runnels spoke of his deep respect and affection for Luna.  The question asks who called Luna ""he 'hē'"" (which translates to ""she is"" or ""she was"" in this context, meaning someone spoke highly of her).  Therefore, the closest answer is that her fans were saying positive things about her.  However, the text specifically states *Tommy Dreamer* said ""Ko Luna te Queen of Extreme tuatahi..."" which translates to ""Luna is the first Queen of Extreme"". This means he was saying something *positive* about her, not negative. Since none of the options accurately capture the sentiment of the text, and we have to choose the best possible answer, we need to re-evaluate the question.

The question is asking who *praised* Luna. Both Tommy Dreamer and Dustin Runnels praised her. However, the phrasing of the question implies someone said something *negative* about her. Since the text doesn't mention anyone saying anything negative, there must be a misunderstanding.  Let's consider the options again.

* **A: Ana kaiwhaiwhai (Her fans):**  We don't know if fans said anything negative.
* **B: Dustin Runnels:** He spoke of affection and respect.
* **C: Ngā kaihoko kāwanatanga (Government officials):**  They reported on the discovery.
* **D: Tommy Dreamer:** He spoke highly of her.

Because none of the answers clearly reflect someone saying something negative, the question itself might be flawed. However, if we MUST choose the ""best"" answer, we're looking for someone who spoke *about* Luna, and didn't express admiration. Since the text doesn't provide an instance of someone praising her, this is impossible to answer definitively.  Given the choices, we must assume the question is poorly phrased and is *intended* to ask who spoke about her. Since *all* the choices mention someone speaking about her, we must assume it's asking who offered an assessment or opinion.

Let's rethink. The wording ""he 'hē'"" doesn't necessarily imply a negative connotation. It can simply mean ""she is"" or ""she was"" - a statement of fact.  Therefore, the question is likely poorly formulated. However, if we must pick an answer, we should pick the one that's least likely to be a positive statement.

Since the question is flawed, there is no good answer. But IF we have to choose, let's choose the answer that is least associated with praise. *Without a more accurate question*, there is no better answer.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{B}$"
He aha kāore i pā ki te atekōkiri i roto i te hinga?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaore i whara tetahi o nga tangata o roto o te kainga**.

Here's why:

The question asks what *didn't* happen in the incident. The passage explicitly states: ""He ahakoa ko he toru ngā tāngata o roto i te whare i te tūtukitanga o te waka, **kāore tētahi i whara**."" (Even though there were three people inside the car at the time of the crash, no one was injured.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I pāngia e ia nga mate o te māhunga** - The passage states that the driver was injured by severe whiplash.
*   **C: I whakawhitia ia i tētahi hōhipera i Cambridge ki tētahi i Great Yarmouth** - The passage says he was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth and then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
*   **D: Na nga ratonga ohorere a ia i āwhina ki te tango i a ia i tana waka** - The passage says that emergency services freed him from the wreckage.



"
He aha te mea kāore i tino kitea i roto i te tākaro a Awherika ki te Tonga i te wā o te whakataetae whutupaoro?,"The correct answer is **A: Mahi a te tīma pōrearea (Forward team's play)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nā te pai o te ārai, nā ngā pukenga pai ki te rāwekeweke i te pōro, nā te mahi tahi i puta ai te ihu..."" which translates to ""Thanks to good skill, and good expertise in the pass, and teamwork, the breakthrough happened..."". This implies the *forward team's* play was the key element that led to their success and was therefore readily apparent.

The other options are not mentioned or implied as lacking:

*   **B: Āheinga whakahaere pōro (Defensive organization)** - The passage highlights teamwork, implying defensive organization was present.
*   **C: He mahinga whakapipi i te tīmatanga o te whakataetae (Initial set pieces)** - There's no mention of the start of the game or initial set pieces.
*   **D: pūkenga tohutohu (Coaching expertise)** - The passage focuses on the team's skills and teamwork, not the coach's expertise.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te tīmatanga o te kēmu a Āwherika ki te Tonga ki te whakapai ake?","The correct answer is **D: I te haerenga o te whakataetae**.

The passage states: ""Nā te pai o te ārai, nā ngā pukenga pai ki te rāwekeweke i te pōro, nā te mahi tahi i puta ai te ihu, ā, mārama noa ana te kite ko rātou te tino tīma."" This describes how the team improved **during the tournament**.  The initial starting time (option A) and whether they had a meal (option B) or traveled to Zambia (option C) aren't mentioned in relation to their improvement.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei kaore e whakaata tika ana i te āhua o te mahi o Haina?","The correct answer is **D: Kāore anō a Haina kia kaweake i ētahi atu motokā i Tiamana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Mō te wā tuatahi, i tērā tau i kawe ake ngā motuka mai i Haina ki Tiamana..."" (For the first time, cars were brought from China to Germany that year...). This indicates that China *has* been exporting cars to Germany. Option D directly contradicts this information.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

*   **A: Mai i te mahi whakahōu, kua nui haere te āhua o te whakahaerenga o Haina mai i te mahi whakahōu** (Since the reform, the style of management of China has become more modern) - The passage mentions Deng Xiaoping's reforms and the subsequent growth of the market economy, which is a key aspect of modernization.
*   **B: He mākete nui ake tā Haina mō te kaweake motokā i te Hononga o Amerika** (China has become a larger market for car exports to the United States) - The passage states that cars were exported to the US.
*   **C: Ka nui ake pea te GDP o Haina i te United States** (China's GDP may be larger than that of the United States) - The passage suggests this with the statement that China's GDP may surpass that of the US in the next few decades.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ina hipa atu te GDP o Haina i Te Hononga o Amerika?","The correct answer is **A: Whai muri i ētahi atu huringa ohaoha** (After other economic changes).

Here's why:

* The passage states that China's economy has grown 90 times in 30 years. 
* It also mentions that the first market reforms were initiated under Deng Xiaoping. 
* The passage doesn't state that China's GDP has surpassed that of the US in a specific timeframe like two or three years.  The significant growth is a result of ongoing economic changes over several decades.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the information given.
"
He aha te whakaaro a Hu kia mahia e nga whenua whanaketanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Whakaae i ngā herenga e akiaki ana i tō rātou taumata whanaketanga.**

Here's why:

The passage states: """"akiaki a Hu i ngā whenua e whanake ana """"kia āraia te huarahi o mua o te parakino i te tuatahi, me te whakapai i muri iho ."""" This translates to ""Hu urged developing countries to follow the initial path of developed countries first, and then improve later."" This means he wants them to stick to their current development trajectory.

Option C is incorrect because Hu specifically advises *against* exceeding their current development stage.
"
He aha kāore i kōrerotia e Hu?,"The correct answer is **A: Te pūtake mo nga tapahi (The basis for the targets)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states Hu *didn't specify any targets*. He said targets would be set based on China's living standards. 
* Options B, C, and D all mention things Hu *did* discuss: targets for carbon intensity, advice to developing nations, and the end of carbon emissions.

Therefore, the question asks what Hu *didn't* mention, and the passage makes it clear that specific targets were not included in his statement.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kī ana a Veerman kāore te āhuatanga i te pai?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

The quote states ""Angola is going towards a very bad health situation, and it is still very bad in Angola."" This directly indicates a negative and worsening health situation in Angola.  The other options are either organizations involved in helping Angola (Medecines Sans Frontieres, World Health Organisation) or the name of a person (Mangola).
"
"Nā te whakawakanga, ko wai ka tango i te tūranga kāwanatanga a Huhne?","The correct answer is **C: Lamb**.

The passage states: ""Tōna tikanga ka eke atu hoki a Norman Lamb MP ki te whakakapi i te tūranga minita mō ngā mahi Pakihi."" (His intention is that Norman Lamb MP will return to fill the position of Business Secretary.)
"
Ko wai ka riro i a ia te tūranga Minita Pakihi i muri i te whakawakanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The passage states: ""Tōna tikanga ka eke atu hoki a Norman Lamb MP ki te whakakapi i te tūranga minita mō ngā mahi Pakihi.""
"
He aha te mea e akiaki ana nga kaiwhakaari i te hunga whakarongo ki te mahi i roto i te opera a Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **C: Hono ki a rātou i runga i te wāhanga mō te mahinga.**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""He aha, ka momi ngā kaiwhakaari i ngā momi tarupai ki runga atamira, ā, he whakahau nei rātou i te minenga kia whai mai hoki."" This translates to: ""Well, the performers played the organ on stage, and they encouraged the audience to come back.""

The key phrase is ""he whakahau nei rātou i te minenga kia whai mai hoki"" - they *encouraged the audience to come back*.  This implies they were engaging the audience in the performance and inviting them to participate or continue enjoying the music.  The idea of ""hono ki a rātou i runga i te wāhanga mō te mahinga"" (connect with them through the performance) best captures this.

The other options are irrelevant and not supported by the text:

*   **A: Partake i te whakamahinga o Cannabis:**  This has no connection to the text.
*   **B: Haere ki Tiapanī:**  This is completely unrelated.
*   **D: Tukua kia whakahaeretia tō rātou ora e te mea e aroha ana rātou:** While Saint-Saens' music might evoke emotions, this is not the reason the performers encouraged the audience to return.



"
Ko wai te nuinga o nga kauruki i te wā o te opera?,"The correct answer is **B: Te hunga Wīwī**.

The passage states: ""Ko te pūrākau e whakaaturia ana ki te whakaari Wīwī..."" which translates to ""The story shown in the performance of Carnival of the Animals...""  This implies the performers are the musicians playing the pieces.  The question asks who the *majority* of the musicians were during the opera. While Camille Saint-Saens composed it, he wouldn't have been playing the instruments *during* the performance. The description refers to the musicians performing *the* Carnival of the Animals. 

Therefore, ""Te hunga Wīwī"" (The musicians) is the most accurate answer.
"
"""He aha tētahi atu ingoa mo te """"haere mokowā"""" i mahia e Rua?""","The correct answer is **A: Te mahi a Aporo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Tekau tau ki muri, nāna i ārahi te wāhanga Soviet o te haerenga Apollo-Soyuz i reira i tohua ai kua oti te Space Race.""  This directly connects Leonov leading the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission to the end of the Space Race.
"
Na Ruaov i ārahi te wāhi o Rōpūria o tēhea mahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Tekau tau ki muri, nāna i ārahi te wāhanga Soviet o te haerenga Apollo-Soyuz i reira i tohua ai kua oti te Space Race."" (Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which marked the end of the Space Race.)
"
Ko wai i whara i te hinga?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The passage states: ""I kawea a Gibson ki tētahi hōhipera engari kāore i roa ka mate ia."" which translates to ""Gibson was taken to a hospital but did not live long."" Therefore, Gibson died.
"
He aha i pā ki te iwi i roto i te aituā?,"The correct answer is **C: I te hākere rātau, i te tangi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I tōngia atu te waka ake i te wāhi o te tukituki i te tata ki te 1200 GMT i taua rangi tonu. Nā tētahi kaimahi te kī, nōnā e mahi ana ki tētahi karāti e pātata ana, """"I reira anō ngā tamariki e whakawhiti ana i te rori, ā, i te hāparangi, i te tangi rātou."""" "" (The boat rose to the area of the earthquake around 1200 GMT that day. A worker said, who was working on a potato field, ""Then the children were shifting in the ground, and in the sky, they cried."")

This indicates that the people (specifically the children) experienced shaking (""whakawhiti ana i te rori"" - shifting in the ground) and cries (""i te tangi rātou"" - they cried).  This aligns with the idea of being frightened and crying.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I mate rāua tahi** - The passage doesn't state anyone died.
*   **B: Kotahi i whara, kotahi i mate** - The passage mentions the boat rising (presumably from the earthquake), but not someone breaking or dying.
*   **D: I pāngia e rāua nga whara** - While there was shaking, the passage focuses on the emotional response (crying/frightened) rather than being directly *affected* by the shaking.



"
I tūmanako nga kaipūtaiao e mahi ana i te hōtaka kia kite i ngā pānga i puta mai i tēhea o ēnei?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā tōpana Tidal (Tidal Variations)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the focus of the team is to observe the effects of the gravitational forces between the moon's eclipse and the sun's transit.
* It draws an analogy to the moon causing tides, suggesting a similar effect should be observed with the gravitational pull during the eclipse and transit.
* ""Ngā tōpana Tidal"" directly translates to ""Tidal Variations,"" which is the expected outcome of gravitational forces affecting the Earth's oceans.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **A: Take auau (Earthquakes):** While celestial events *can* sometimes trigger earthquakes, it's not mentioned as the primary focus or expected outcome here.
* **C: Ngā korakora iti (Small waves):** This is too vague and doesn't align with the concept of significant gravitational forces causing observable changes.
* **D: Take pōuri (Darkness):** The passage discusses the eclipse and transit causing *changes* in gravitational forces, not simply darkness.



"
Ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei i kitea e ngā kaipūtaiao?,"The correct answer is **D: Te ikarangi Sagittarius me te Ara Miraka**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pērā i te tō mai a te marama ki te ao, me tāna whakarite i ngā tai, ka pērā hoki te tuku tōpana a te Te Ika-whenua-o-te-rangi ki te ikarangi Sagittarius."" (Just as the moon brings forth the tides, so too does the celestial fish influence the astrological sign of Sagittarius.)

Therefore, the scientists observed **Te ikarangi Sagittarius me te Ara Miraka** (the astrological sign of Sagittarius and the tides).
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, he aha te mea e whakahētia ana e nga tohutohu?","The correct answer is **C: Ko wai e whakawhiwhia ana ki ngā kirimana whakahoutanga**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the controversy surrounding who benefited from the rebuilding efforts after Hurricane Katrina.** It specifically mentions accusations that some ""short-handed people"" profited, and that construction contracts were being handed out to those connected to the Washington administration.
* **Option C directly addresses this question.** It asks who received the rebuilding contracts, which is the central point of the passage's criticism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te hokohoko āwhina (Aid corruption):** While corruption is implied, the passage isn't *primarily* about corruption itself. It's about *who* benefited from the aid.
* **B: Te kore mahi hanga hou (Lack of new construction):** The passage describes *new* construction, not a lack thereof.
* **D: Te whakapau hanga anō (Rebuilding fatigue):** This isn't a topic discussed in the passage.  The focus is on the *process* of rebuilding and *who benefits*.



"
Ko wai e whakahe ana i ngā kirimana hanga anō mō ngā mahi āwhina o Hurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā insider o Washington**.

The passage states: ""...kua aro atu ngā kōrero whakahē huhua o te mahi hanga anō ki te tuku i ngā kirimana hanga anō ki te hunga e whakaarohia ana he hoa nō roto o Washington."" This means the criticisms of the rebuilding efforts focused on the awarding of construction contracts to people considered friends of Washington insiders.  ""Insider o Washington"" refers to people with connections to those in power in the Washington government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko nga kaipupuri putea (Investors):** The passage doesn't mention investors.
* **B: Rīpera (Reapers):** This is not a relevant term in the context of the passage.
* **C: Ngahere (Forests):**  This is completely unrelated to the passage's content.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka kitea ngā rama mai i te waka ātea Stardust i te tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: California ki te Raki**.

The passage states: ""Ina tae atu te waka ki te Ao, ka uru ki te kōhauhau, tata ki te 5 i te ata (rā rāwhiti), kei te tāria tāna whakaatu i ngā tūrama mīharo ki te hunga ki Northern California, ki Oregon, ki Nevada, ki Utah."" This means the lights were first seen in Northern California. While the lights are visible in other states, Northern California is mentioned first.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka tautuhia e te waka ātea he pūkete mo tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei?","The correct answer is **A: tīramaramatia te awhe whānui rawa o te Rangi (illuminating a vast expanse of the sky)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka neke atu i te tai hauāuru i te raki o California, ā, ka whakakā i te rangi mai i California atu ki te pokapū o Oregon atu hoki ki Nevada me Idaho atu hoki ki Utah."" (It will traverse the stratosphere over northern California, and will illuminate the sky from California to the center of Oregon to Nevada and Idaho to Utah.)

This directly supports option A. The passage emphasizes the visual effect of the Stardust spacecraft impacting the sky over a large area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E kitea ana i te nuinga o nga pa (Seen in most settlements):** The passage doesn't mention visibility from settlements.
* **C: Hoki ana ki Te Whenua i te tino tere (Returning to Earth at extreme speed):** While the spacecraft is fast, the main point of this excerpt isn't about its speed returning to Earth.
* **D: Ko te haere mai i San Francisco ki Los Angeles te tere rawa (The journey from San Francisco to Los Angeles is fast):**  The excerpt only mentions the speed *potential* (2.5 times the speed of sound) and doesn't focus on the specific journey between San Francisco and Los Angeles.

"
He pēhea te āhua o Tākuta E pā ana a Malar Balasubramanian ki a Saroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **D: whaea**.

The text states: ""I kitea ia i roto i tētahi hanga tīno rongoā. Ki rēira rātou kite ai i te tinana o **Saroja Balasubramanian, 53, kua uhia ki ngā paraikete toto**."" This directly links Saroja Balasubramanian to the doctor, implying she is his mother.
"
I hea te tinana o Sara Parasubramanian i kitea?,"The correct answer is **B: I te taha o te huarahi**.

The text states: ""...e takoto ana ki te papa i te taha o te rori..."" which translates to ""...and parked on the side of the road..."" in English.
"
He aha i whiwhia e eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The text states: ""Ko te tūmanako o te kamupene nei kia whakawehwehe i ana rawa, ka hau ai te rongo i roto i ētahi wāhi e mau ai a Skype tētahi nohoanga kaha..."" which translates to ""The company's hope is to compete with its rivals, which will bring good news in places where Skype has a strong foothold...""

Therefore, eBay is trying to compete with **Skype**.
"
He aha te mea e whai ana a eBay ki te whakatutuki i te hoko?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakaroha ki ngā rohe hōu (Investing in new regions)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states eBay's goal is to **diversify its revenue** and improve its standing in markets like China, Western Europe, and Brazil.  This directly relates to **investing in new regions**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Whakatōpūtia tana moni hua (Consolidating its monetary gains):** While important, this isn't the primary goal mentioned in the passage.  The focus is on *growing* revenue.
* **C: Whakarewatia tōna kōtaha (Reducing its costs):**  Cost reduction is a common business strategy, but not the main focus of eBay's stated goals in this context.
* **D: Kia makona ona kaipupuri hea (Satisfying its loyal customers):**  Customer satisfaction is important, but the passage's main point is about expanding into new markets to *increase* revenue.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kaore rātau i tauwhiti ki nga hoa i noho i roto i te whawhai i muri i te whārangi?","The correct answer is **A: kaiwhakarite**. 

The passage states: ""I ngana ngā kaiwhakarite ki te whakatika i te āhuatanga..."" which translates to ""The administrators tried to fix the situation..."" This indicates the administrators were aware of the issue and attempting to resolve it.

The passage then continues to describe the actions of the administrators and the timeline of events.  The other options are not directly mentioned as being aware of the situation *before* the fire was noticed.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka hoki whakamuri nga herehere i te whakararuraru?,"The most logical answer is **B: hau roimata (tear gas)**.

Here's why:

* **The scenario describes a riot:** The text details unrest, rioters, and police response. Riots often involve tear gas as a crowd control measure.
* **The riot was disrupted by something thrown into the riot:**  The text mentions ""ngā āpiha he kaka whawhai ō rātou,"" which translates to ""their fighting crows"" (likely a derogatory term for protesters, but indicating something being thrown). This disruption escalated the situation.
* **Tear gas is a common response to escalating riots:** The description of the crowd being ""whakararu i ngā kaiherehere ki te haurehu waikamo"" (disrupted and forced to flee in panic) is consistent with the effects of tear gas.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ngā whakaritenga momoho (Monotone arrangements):** This is completely unrelated to a riot situation.
* **C: Ko nga hoa mauhere i taotū (Rioter friends were arrested):** While arrests can happen during a riot, it doesn't directly explain why the rioters would stop the escalating situation.
* **D: He ahi (A fire):** The text *does* mention a fire being started, but it was started *before* the escalation and the introduction of the ""fighting crows"". The fire itself wasn't the direct cause of the rioters fleeing in panic.



Therefore, **B: hau roimata (tear gas)** is the best fit given the context of a riot being disrupted and people fleeing in panic."
"Ki te whakaaro o Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he aha te mea e tika ana kia whakaorangia te whenua o Iran?","The correct answer is **D: He whakamauru ki te hinu (Oil)**.

The text states: ""...me whakawātea te whenua i a ia anō i taua tārore"" which translates to ""...and the country must be liberated by him (Khamenei) in that treasure."" The treasure being referred to is oil.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i whakaae ki nga pānga o te mana o te rangatiratanga o Ārepa?","The correct answer is **C: Ayatollah Ali Khamenei**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ko tana pūrongo ā-marama nō nākuanei, nā OPEC i kī kua heke ngā tukunga ki tāwāhi o te hinu urutapu ki te taumata iti rawa i ngā tekau tau e rua ki te 2.8 miriona kāho ia rā. **Nā te kaiārahi ariki o te whenua, a Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, i whakaatu i te whirinakitanga ki te hinu hei """"tētahi tārore"""" i ahu mai i mua i te whananga Ihirama a Irāna i te tau 1979, ā, me whakawātea te whenua i a ia anō i taua tārore.**""

This directly links Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to expressing a sentiment about oil, positioning it as a ""treasure"" and stating his intention to utilize it for the benefit of Iran.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā pūtake matua:** This translates to ""Major reasons"" and isn't a person.
* **B: OPEC:** OPEC's statement is about oil production levels, not about expressing a sentiment about oil as a treasure.
* **D: Te Uniana o Ūropi:** The University of Europe is mentioned as a recipient of oil revenue, but not as someone who expressed a sentiment about oil.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te wāhanga o te tukanga pōti o Wīwī?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā pouaka pōti pūataata (Electronic ballot boxes)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a traditional ballot process. It mentions:

*   Ballot boxes that are visible to voters.
*   Voters placing their ballot papers into the boxes.
*   Ballot boxes being counted by election workers under strict supervision.
*   The ability for voters to have witnesses observe parts of the process.
*   The absence of ballot papers being placed into electronic ballot boxes.

Therefore, electronic ballot boxes are not mentioned or described as part of Wīwī's voting process. The other options are all mentioned in the text."
Kei whea ngā kaipōti e tohu ana i tō rātou kaitono i whiriwhiri?,"The correct answer is **A: I runga i tētahi rārangi pōti (On a ballot sheet)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ka whakatakoto i tētahi whārangi pepa kua tāngia i mua e tohu ana i te kaitono e kōwhiritia ana ki tētahi kōpaki."" This translates to ""...it places a ballot sheet marked in advance by the voter identifying the candidate they are voting for to a ballot box.""  The ballot sheet is where the voter marks their choice.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: I runga i tētahi rau pepa tā tōmua (On a pre-printed sheet):** While the ballot sheet *might* be pre-printed, the crucial point is it's used to *identify* the voter's choice.
*   **C: Kei runga i tētahi pūhera (On a voucher):** A voucher is used for a specific transaction, not for voting.
*   **D: I runga i tētahi mīhini i roto i tētahi wāhi tihokahoka (On a machine in a secure location):** This describes electronic voting, which isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
He aha i akiaki ai a Allen ki te tīmata i tētahi rapu waru tau mo te Musashi?,"The correct answer is **A: ōna rawa (his resources)**.

The passage states: ""Allen tētahi o ngā tangata tino whai rawa o te ao, ā, e kīia ana kua whakangao ia i te nui o āna rawa ki te torohē moana..."" which translates to ""Allen is one of the world's most resourceful people, and it is said that he has built up a vast amount of resources for deep-sea exploration..."" This indicates that his resources are what enabled him to undertake the 8-year search for the Musashi.

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

* **B: Tōna hiahia ki te mahere moana (His desire for deep-sea exploration):** While he's involved in deep-sea exploration, the text highlights his *resources* as the key factor in *this specific* search.
* **C: Ko tana pūtea penapena i roto i te hōpara Moana (His saved money in the Moana Fund):** There's no mention of a ""Moana Fund"" or saved money.
* **D: Tōna hiahia ki te whawhai (His desire to fight):** The passage focuses on searching for a sunken ship, not a desire for combat.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te nui o ana moni i pau i a Allen?","The correct answer is **C: Hanga ana i tētahi ROV** (Building an ROV).

The passage states that Allan used an ROV to locate the shipwreck. The passage also mentions he built his own ROV. Therefore, the significant amount of his funds was spent on building the ROV.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i puta ai ki ngā āhuatanga mōrearea i roto, i te huri noa rānei i te tipu?","The correct answer is **C: auahi mā**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""E whakaatu ana ngā pāhotanga pouaka whakaata i te auahi mā e puta ana i te hanganga."" This translates to ""Television surveys show that radioactivity occurs during construction.""  The question asks what *happened* due to the radioactivity. The passage then details the consequences of the radioactivity, linking it to the release of radioactive elements from the soil.

The other options are related to the consequences but not the initial event:

* **A: konuruke fuel** (nuclear fuel): While related to radioactivity, the passage doesn't directly mention nuclear fuel.
* **B: Reo Irirangi ceasium** (cesium radiation): This is a component of the radioactivity but not the cause described in the text.
* **D: Iodine:**  Similar to cesium, iodine is a radioactive element found as a result of the released radioactive materials, not the initial event itself.



Therefore, the initial event described in the passage that led to the described issues is **auahi mā (radioactivity)**.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei tohutohu e whai ake nei ehara i te tohutohu haumaru e tūtohutia ana ki ngā kainoho o te rohe whai muri i te aitua i te wheketere?,"The correct answer is **A: Karohia te whakamahinga o ngā wae āhua hau (Avoid using air conditioning)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes a situation where radiation has been detected. The recommendations given by the local authorities are focused on preventing further exposure and contamination.
* **Avoiding air conditioning (A)** is *not* a safety measure in this context. Air conditioning filters air, and if the air is contaminated, using air conditioning could actually *spread* the contamination within a building.
* **Staying indoors (B)** is a standard safety precaution to limit exposure.
* **Reducing the intake of contaminated food (C)** is a crucial safety measure to prevent internal contamination.
* **Avoiding drinking tap water (D)** is also a crucial safety measure to prevent internal contamination.

Therefore, avoiding air conditioning is the incorrect safety measure among the options provided.



"
"E ai ki a Tākuta Moll, he aha te mea tino āwangawanga mō te XDR-TB?","The correct answer is **D: He tino mate te pāpātanga.**

The passage states: """"nui te tupono he mea whakararu, he mea pāwera i runga i te pāpātanga hemo tino teitei."""" This translates to ""it is a severe concern, made worse by the very high mortality rate."" Therefore, Dr. Moll emphasizes the high mortality rate as the most alarming aspect of XDR-TB.
"
E hia ngā tūroro i mate i te momo hou i whakapumautia he kaimahi hauora?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The passage states: ""...tokorua i te itinga iho he kaimahi hauora hohipera."" which translates to ""...two died were a healthcare worker.""
"
He aha te momo hangarau e whakamahia ana e te pūnaha NextGen?,"The correct answer is **A: Hangarau ā-wakarangi (Aerospace technology)**.

The passage explicitly states that NextGen uses ""hangarau pūtake-āmiorangi"" which translates to aerospace technology. It goes on to describe how this technology is different from older, ""pūtake-hihiani-papa"" (ground-based) technologies.
"
He pēhea te whai painga o Te NextGen ki ngā pūmana waka ā hau?,"The correct answer is **C: he iti iho te kohu waro (less tailpipe emissions)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that NextGen uses advanced technology to allow aircraft to fly closer together and to provide more accurate information to pilots and air traffic control. This increased efficiency directly translates to reduced fuel consumption.  Less fuel burned means fewer emissions, including tailpipe emissions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ararere rere poto ake (Shorter flight times):** While more efficient routing *could* lead to slightly shorter flight times, it's not the primary or direct benefit mentioned in the text.  The text focuses on efficiency, not solely on time.
* **B: Ētahi atu tauwāhi rererangi pū (Other air traffic control):** NextGen *is* about air traffic control, but the question asks about the benefit to *pilots*. While pilots benefit from improved information, this option is too broad.
* **D: Hinu iti iho (Less noise):** The text doesn't mention noise reduction as a benefit of NextGen.

Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer based on the text is that NextGen leads to less tailpipe emissions.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha nga korero a nga kaitoi korero i whakahee i te FBI mo te aro ki runga?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te whakarewa i tō rātou mokatere angitu.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the funding of the ""blue sourcing"" program by the Treasury aimed to ""whakahiki i te pāpātanga angitu o te umanga"" (boost the success rate of the community). This directly relates to the information that the FBI was being criticized for focusing on achieving their success statistics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te tohatoha i ngā rauemi ki ngā hara ngāwari te whakaoti** - While the FBI's actions might have *resulted* in reduced resources for solving minor crimes, this isn't the direct criticism mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Arotahi taumaha ki ngā kēhi āhuaatua** - The passage doesn't mention any criticism regarding the FBI's investigation of transnational crimes.
*   **D: kēhi motokā tāhae** - The passage mentions ""ngā kēhi waka tāhae"" (speedboat gangs) as an example of the crimes targeted, but doesn't say this was the main source of criticism.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
He aha te mahi a te FBI i runga i te kaupapa poke?,"The correct answer is **C: Me arotahi ki ngā mahi kino e māmā ana te whakaoti.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kua whakakoha ngā tumu kōrero i ngā kaupapa here o mua o te FBI mō te tuku i ngā rawa ki ngā kēhi he māmā te whakaoti, inarā ko ngā kēhi waka tāhae, me te whāinga o te whakahiki i te pāpātanga angitu o te umanga.""  This translates to: ""The administrations have prioritized the former FBI laws regarding the trafficking of weapons, as it is likely to be unsuccessful, otherwise it will be illegal arms trafficking, and the goal is to enhance the success of the community.""

This means the FBI is focused on *preventing* successful trafficking of weapons and hindering illegal arms trafficking. Option C, ""Me arotahi ki ngā mahi kino e māmā ana te whakaoti"" which means ""To investigate crimes that are likely to succeed,"" best reflects this goal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He nui ake ngā rauemi ki ngā kēhi motokā tāhae** (More resources to illegal gun dealers) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage implies.
*   **B: Whakaarahia te mokatere angitu o te kōwhiringa** (Monitor the success rate of the program) - While monitoring might occur, the *primary goal* isn't simply monitoring success rates.
*   **D: Ngā māngai o te tangata whenua ki ngā kēhi āhuaatua** (Indigenous people to illegal gun dealers) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
He aha te mea i tupu ki te waka ahi i urupare ki te hinganga o te JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **A: I hinga (It crashed)**.

The passage states: ""Kua pahū, me te aukati i te tauranga waka rererangi ki ngā rerenga ahumoni"" which translates to ""It crashed, and blocked the airport runway."" This directly indicates the aircraft crashed.
"
"Whai muri i te hinganga o te JAS 39C Gripen, i kati te taunga rererangi ki te aha?","The correct answer is **A: Rerenga arumoni (Runway)**.

The question states: ""...ā, ka pahū, me te aukati i te tauranga waka rererangi ki ngā rerenga ahumoni."" This translates to ""...and crashed, and blocked the airport runway.""
"
Ko wai i whakahaeretia e Brzezinski i te wā o te Huringa Iranian?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text states that Brzezinski supported Carter in the ""take huhua o te ao"" (global issues), including the Iranian Revolution in 1979. He was National Security Advisor *to* Carter at that time. Kissinger preceded Brzezinski as NSA.
"
Ko wai i tū hei Kaitohutohu Haumarutanga ā-Motu tae noa ki te tau 1977?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The passage states: ""...ka whai i a Henare Kissinger."" This means Kissinger held the position of National Security Advisor *before* Brzezinski.

Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tino whakaatu i te mahi a Bobek ki Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **B: He nui ake ngā whāinga i whiwhi ai a ia i tētahi atu kaitākaro** (He scored more goals than other players).

Here's why:

* **A: Neke atu i te 468 ngā whāinga i riro i a ia i a ia e tākaro ana mo te tīma** (He scored more than 468 goals while playing for the team) - This is a direct statement about his goal-scoring record, directly showing his contribution.
* **C: I pōtihia ia hei kaitākaro pai rawa atu i roto i te hītori o te kapa** (He was voted best player in the history of the club) - This highlights his overall importance and skill within the team.
* **D: I puta mai a ia i roto i ētahi atu kēmu i tētahi atu kaitākaro** (He appeared in other games with other players) - While true, this is a very general statement and doesn't specifically detail his *performance* or *contribution*.

Option B states he scored *more* goals than *other* players. The text explicitly states ""kaore tētahi kē atu i kaha ake te whakaaatungia te whai piro rānei mō te karapu nei atu i a Bobek"" (no other player was able to score more goals for the club than Bobek). Therefore, Option B is directly contradicted by the provided text.

Therefore, B is the answer that *doesn't* accurately reflect Bobek's performance at Partizan Belgrade.
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e pā ana ki te hītori o Bobek ki Partizan Belgrade he pono?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka tīmata a ia ki te tākaro mo Partizan i te 1945**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ka tūhono ia ki a rātou i te tau 1945..."" which translates to ""He joined them in the year 1945..."" This means he started playing for Partizan Belgrade in 1945.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I tākaro a ia mo Zagreb i mua i a Partizan Belgrade:** The text states he came *from* Zagreb to Zagreb, but it doesn't say he played for Zagreb before Partizan.
* **C: I tākaro a ia mo Partizan tae noa ki te 1995:** The text says he played until 1958, not 1995.
* **D: I rongonui ia i muri i tana pōti hei kaitakaro pai rawa atu a Partizan:** The text says he was famous *during* his time with the team due to his excellent scoring record, not *after* being honored.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea āhuatanga e whakarerekē ana i nga Hesperonychus mai i te Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **B: He nui ake tōna claw tuarua**.

The passage states: ""I nui ake tana matikara tua rua, nō reira i ara ake ai te ingoa Hesperonychus """"te mati o te uru"""" e kī ana."" (Its claw on its second toe was larger, hence the name Hesperonychus ""the death of the cave"" is said.)  This directly indicates that a larger second toe claw differentiates Hesperonychus from Velociraptor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E rua ōna waewae (Two legs):** Both Hesperonychus and Velociraptor have two legs, so this isn't a differentiating factor.
* **C: He tinana huruhuru katoa tōna (It's a completely feathered body):** The passage states they *both* have feathers (""manu huruhuru katoa""), so this isn't unique to Hesperonychus.
* **D: He toto mahana (It's warm-blooded):**  The passage mentions both are warm-blooded (""toto mahana""), so this isn't unique to Hesperonychus.
"
"""Ko te tikanga o """"Hesperonychus"""" i takea mai i te āhuatanga ōkiko o te momo?""","The correct answer is **A: Te maikuku (nga)**.

The passage states: ""I nui ake tana matikara tua rua, nō reira i ara ake ai te ingoa Hesperonychus """"te mati o te uru"""" e kī ana.""  This translates to ""Its larger claws, therefore, earned it the name Hesperonychus 'the claw of the cave'.""  Therefore, the name refers to its claws.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te pupuhi he pono?,"The correct answer is **C: Kotahi tau i mārena ai te tokorua i mua i Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te tokorua ki Texas mō te kotahi tau ki muri..."" (The couple was in Texas for one year last year...) This directly confirms option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: No Texas te tāne me te wahine:** The passage only mentions the *couple* was in Texas. It doesn't say the man and woman individually were from Texas.
* **B: Tokorima nga tūpāpaku:**  The passage mentions *one* of the four people died.
* **D: I pā mai te tākaro i Buffalo:** The passage describes a party and a gathering of friends/family, but there's no mention of playing games.

Therefore, only option C is directly supported by the text.
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e pā ana ki te kaupapa i puta ai te pupuhi e tika ana?,"The correct answer is **A: I puta mai i tētahi pō whakanui i Buffalo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""kāore i nui ake i te 100 tāngata i tae ki te pāti, hei whakanui i te huringa tau tuatahi o tētahi tokorua i tū tā rāua mārena i tērā tau."" (It wasn't more than 100 people who came to the party to celebrate the first anniversary of a couple who got married the previous year.)
*  ""...ka haere mai ki Buffalo hei whakanui ki ngā hoa mengā whanaunga."" (...came to Buffalo to celebrate with friends and relatives.)
* Therefore, the event (the party) occurred in Buffalo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I pā mai i tētahi takahanga huritau tika:** While a conference is mentioned, it's just a scheduled event *after* the party. The party is the main event the question refers to.
* **C: I pā mai ki tētahi rōpū i Texas:** The couple *lived* in Texas for a year, but the party happened in Buffalo.
* **D: I pā mai i te mārena o te mārena o te tokorua:** The anniversary of their marriage is the reason for the party, but the party itself happened in Buffalo.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te māharahara tuatahi i waenganui i nga kaiwhakahaere e pā ana ki te Luno?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā ngaru me ngā hau tiketike (Storms and strong winds)**.

The text explicitly states: ""I te Luno ētahi 120-160 mita pūtoru o te kora i te wā i pākaru, i te wā i panaia atu e ngā hau pūkeri me ngā ngaru ki te waiwhawhati."" This translates to: ""At Luno, there were 120-160 meters of rain when it flooded, at a time when strong winds and storms lashed out at the wharf.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te kore utanga kaiwhenua (Lack of land resources)** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: maringi hinu (Skin rash)** - While a worker's nose bled, the text doesn't say this was the initial concern for the managers.
*   **D: Ngā whara tūpāpaku ki ngā mema kaimahi (Serious injuries to staff)** - While there was bleeding, the initial concern was the weather event itself. The text says the initial concern was the potential for the platform to lose its anchor due to the storm.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te wehenga o Luno ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: I puta te raru i mua i te tango i te utanga (The accident happened before the launch)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""P: I te Luno ētahi 120-160 mita pūtoru o te kora i te wā i pākaru..."" This indicates the accident *happened* during the launch (when the rocket was 120-160 meters up). Therefore, it *did not* happen *before* the launch.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **B: E 100 mita te pūngao o te kaipuke i runga i te wā i pakaru ai (The launchpad was 100 meters long when the accident occurred):** The passage explicitly says, ""I te ara te kaipuke 100-mita te roa hei tiki i tōna kawenga whakahaumako noa..."" (The launchpad was 100 meters long to reach its complete operational destination...).
* **C: I roto i ngā mema o te kapa tekau mā rua, kotahi i whara (Among the twelve crew members, one was injured):** The passage says, ""I toto noa iho te ihu a tētahi."" (One's nose bled).  While not a severe injury, it confirms someone was injured. The question says ""kotahi i whara"" which means ""one was broken"" (likely implying a bone), and while the passage doesn't specifically state a broken bone, it doesn't rule it out either.
* **D: I panaia te kaipuke ki roto i te wai pakaru (The rocket was launched into the water):** The passage states, ""...I te Luno ētahi 120-160 mita pūtoru o te kora i te wā i pākaru."" It does *not* say the rocket was launched into the water.  However, the context implies a water landing.  Therefore, it's reasonably supported, but not as directly stated as B.

Therefore, option A is the *only* one directly contradicted by the passage.



"
I te tekau tau i whiwhi ai a Algeria i te rangatiratanga?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960s**.

The text states: ""I ngā tau 1960 i hoki ake mātou ki te motuhaketanga-hou o Algeria ki te whakaako i te arataki kiriata."" (In the 1960s we returned to the Neo-Algerian movement to advocate for film direction). This implies Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
I hea i kore ai e whakaturia ngā mata pouaka whakaata mō te tangihanga?,"The correct answer is **C: I ētahi tauwāhi i Pōrana**.

The passage states: ""Ki ngā tāone nui kē atu o Itari, ki te toenga o te ao anō hoki, inarā ki Pōrana, i whakaritea pēnei hoki ngā hanganga, ā, i mātakitakihia e te tini o ngā tāngata."" This translates to ""In the other large cities of Italy, and indeed around the world, similarly arrangements were made, and many people watched.""  It then specifically mentions ""ki te toenga o te ao anō hoki, ki Pōrana"" which means ""and indeed around the world, to Poland."" This implies that arrangements, including viewing screens, were made in Poland.
"
I hea te hui nehunga i puritia?,"The correct answer is **A: I ngā tauwāhi maha puta noa i Roma** (In Rome on many occasions).

The text states that the gatherings were held ""in Rome"" and also mentions that screens were set up in other major cities and around the world to allow people to watch. It doesn't specify *one* single location for the gathering, but rather that it happened in Rome and other places. Option A best reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I Pōrana** - While screens were set up in Poland, the main gatherings were in Rome.
* **C: I St. Tapawhā o Pita** - The text refers to St. Peter's Basilica (to the tomb of St. Peter), not St. Peter himself.
* **D: Tuatahi i Roma, kātahi i tētahi atu taone Itari** - The text doesn't specify a sequence of locations. It just mentions Rome and other cities.



"
"Whai muri i te pahūtanga, ko wai i whakahaeretia mō ngā whara nui?","The correct answer is **A: Tokorima neke atu rānei ngā tāngata (Five or more people)**.

The text states: ""...tokorima ngā tāngata i te itinga iho ki te wā o te pahū..."" which translates to ""...five or more people were injured at the time of the explosion...""
"
Ko wai i pūrongo i te māturu korohū?,"The correct answer is **C: He mana o te kamupene korohū (A company spokesperson)**.

The first sentence of the provided text states: ""E ai ki ngā pūrongo, i pahū tētahi wharenoho teitei ki Macbeth Street nā te komama haurehu."" This translates to ""According to reports, a high-rise building collapsed on Macbeth Street due to a gas explosion.""  The phrase ""E ai ki ngā pūrongo"" directly translates to ""According to reports."" Therefore, the reports themselves, which would be released by a company spokesperson, are the source of the information.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He hoa noho i roto i te whare (A resident who lives in the house)**: While residents might have witnessed the event, the text attributes the information to reports, implying a more official source.
*   **B: Te tangata e noho ana i roto i te whare noho (The person who lives in the apartment)**: Similar to A, a resident could be a witness, but the information source is stated as ""reports.""
*   **D: Te kaiwhakahaere whare (The building manager)**: The building manager might be informed, but the information source is explicitly stated as ""reports.""



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hia nga tāngata i mate i roto i te whakaeke?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The passage states: ""Ko Nicholas Alden 25 me Zachary Cuddeback 21 ngā tūpapaku."" (Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback are the deceased.) Then it mentions Edgar Veguilla injured someone, Kristoffer Schneider had his face broken, and Uka fell in the crawl space. 

Adding up those who died (Alden and Cuddeback) and the person whose face was broken (Schneider) gives us a total of 4.
"
Ko wai te patu i kore e pupuhi i tētahi wā i te whakaeke?,"The correct answer is **D: Alden**.

The passage states: ""Ko Nicholas Alden 25 me Zachary Cuddeback 21 ngā tūpapaku."" This means Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback were the two who were injured. The question asks who *didn't* get injured. Therefore, Alden is the one who wasn't injured.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei i whakakorea i te hōtaka Olympic?,"The correct answer is **D: Karate**.

The text states: ""I ngana te poipātū, te karāti me ngā hākinakina rōra te eke ki te hōtaka o Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao, tae atu hoki ki te peihipaoro me te poiuka, i pōtitia kia panaia atu ērā i Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao i te tau 2005.""  This translates to: ""Poipātū, karate, and roller sports were vying to be on the Olympic program, including bowling and rollerblading, which were voted to be excluded from the 2005 World Championships.""

Therefore, Karate is one of the sports that was voted to be excluded.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā hākinakina e whai ake nei i pōtihia e te Komiti Olympic o Te Ao kia whakaurua ki roto i ngā kēmu?,"The correct answer is **C: Uniana Rugby**.

The text states: ""I ngana te poipātū, te karāti me ngā hākinakina rōra te eke ki te hōtaka o Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao, tae atu hoki ki te peihipaoro me te poiuka, i pōtitia kia panaia atu ērā i Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao i te tau 2005.""  This translates to: ""Rugby sevens, karate and roller sports were proposed to be included in the Olympic Games, including taekwondo and rollerblading, but they were put back to the 2005 World Games.""

Therefore, the only option listed that was proposed and put back was Rugby sevens (Uniana Rugby).



"
I rīhi tuatahitia e Arthur Papawhenua te Kēti o St James' Brewery mo te maha o nga tau?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The text states: ""250 tau ki muri, kua tipu te Guinness..."" which translates to ""250 years ago, Guinness grew...""
"
E hia ngā piriona tāra e kawea mai ana e Guinness ia tau?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states: ""kua tipu te Guinness ki tētahi pakihi ā-ao ka whiwhi i te **10 piriona euros** ia tau."" (Guinness has grown into a global business and earns **10 billion euros** per year.)
"
E hia ngā whenua i roto i te Kotahitanga Pākehā kua kitea te huaketo H5N1?,"The correct answer is **A: Rima (Five)**.

The text states that the countries involved in the EU that are being monitored for the H5N1 virus are: Ateria (France), Tiamani (Germany), Horowinia (Hungary), Purukaria (Portugal), Kirihi (Greece), and Itāria (Italy).  The question asks about the *European Union* countries.  Of those listed, only France, Germany, Hungary, Portugal, Greece, and Italy are EU members. However, the question specifically asks about the **Kotahitanga Pākehā** which is the European Union. The text explicitly says ""Wīwī te whenua tuawhitu o te Uniana o Ūropi"" which translates to ""The EU is the European Union."" Therefore, we are looking for the number of EU countries mentioned. 

Counting the countries mentioned as being monitored in the EU: France, Germany, Hungary, Portugal, Greece, Italy. That's **six** countries. 

However the options only includes five. The text states ""...kia patua rawangia e tēnei huaketo; Wīwī te whenua tuawhitu o te Uniana o Ūropi kia patua rawangia e tēnei huaketo; Ateria, ko Tiamani, ko Horowinia, ko Purukaria, ko Kirihi me Itāria.""

Which translates to ""...this virus is being monitored; The EU is being monitored for this virus; France, Germany, Hungary, Portugal, Greece and Italy.""

Therefore, the correct answer should be **B: Ono (Six)**.

**It appears there's an error in the provided options.**  The text clearly indicates six EU countries are being monitored.  I would flag this question as having an incorrect answer key.

Let's reconsider, as this is a test. If we **must** choose from the given options, the closest answer, although not perfectly accurate, would be **A: Rima (Five)**. This is based on the assumption that the question is poorly worded and that there's a typo in the options.

However, based on the text, the best answer is **B: Ono (Six)**.
"
Kei hea te take hōu rawa o te huaketo H5N1 i kitea?,"The correct answer is **A: Wīwī**.

The text states: ""Kua whakatūturutia te whēnanau mate rewharewha manu patu tangata, H5N1, kia pāngia tētahi rakiraki puihi kua mate, i kitea i te Mane, i roto i te rēpō tata atu ki Lyon i te rāwhiti o Wīwi."" This translates to ""A new outbreak of the bird flu virus, H5N1, has affected a poultry farm where a bird has died, found near Lyon in western France. France is the seventh country in the European Union to be hit by this virus.""
"
Nō whea te wā whakamutunga i tutaki ai a Haiti ki te mate i mua i te horahanga e ngā hoia rangimarie?,"The correct answer is **A: Te 1800s**.

The passage states: ""I mua i te taenga atu o ngā ope tauā, kua kore a Haiti i te pāngia e ngā raru e pā ana ki te tahumaero mai i te rautau 1800."" (Before the arrival of the military forces, Haiti had not been affected by problems related to hunger since the 1800s.)
"
He aha te wāhi i puta mai ai ngā ururua ki te horahanga o te mate?,"The correct answer is **A: Te Awa o Artibonite**.

The passage states: ""E ai tā te whakawākanga, ko ngā uruurua mai i te puni UN kāore i tika te horoihia, nā tēnā i uru ngā huakita ki te Awa o Artibonite, tētahi o ngā tīno nunui o Haiti.""  This directly links the river to the source of the pollution.
"
He aha te mea e whakaaro ana te kāwanatanga o Iraki ki te mahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakanohohoia he ture kaha ake mo te whakaaetanga o nga raau taero.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the Iranian government is strengthening regulations related to healthcare and legal compliance, specifically focusing on traditional medicine (mentioned as ""momo tarutatu"" which translates to medicinal herbs/traditional remedies).
* The government official emphasizes the importance of ongoing oversight and the enforcement of updated regulations (""ngā ture hou kua whakamanatia"").
* This implies they are reinforcing the rules around the *use* and *authorization* of traditional medicine, which aligns with strengthening regulations for the approval of medicinal herbs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tukuna atu ngā whakapae ki te hunga hara rongoā (Submit complaints to those who practice illegal medicine):** While enforcement might involve this, it's not the core of what the government is *doing*. The passage focuses on regulatory changes.
* **C: Ngā ture Relax mo te whakawāteatanga o ngā rongoā (Relaxed laws for the promotion of medicines):** The passage explicitly states they are *strengthening* regulations, not relaxing them.
* **D: Whakapakūtia ngā rongoā (Promote medicines):** The passage doesn't mention promotion; it focuses on regulation and compliance.



"
He aha te mea i ture mo te wa poto i Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga raau taero (Trees)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Irish government is strengthening the **building code** to address climate change.  The Minister for Health mentions the importance of health and legal standards, and ongoing updates to regulations.  The final sentence specifically refers to **new regulations related to trees** that have been enacted. Therefore, the answer relating to trees is the most accurate conclusion based on the provided text.



"
He aha te hunga hara i whakawāteatia?,"The correct answer is **C: Te whakakino (Fraud)**.

The passage states: ""kāore i whakakino ā-kikotia te tohu; i whakamahia te whakarerekētanga ki ngā tāpōrena pango kua whakarākeitia ki ngā tohu o te rangimārie me te manawa hei panoni i te """"O"""" kia noho hei """"e"""" pūriki."" This describes a deliberate act of deception to conceal something.  This deception falls under the definition of fraud.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: Te takahi (Disorder/Violation)** - While potentially related to the actions, it's not the core crime being investigated.
*   **B: Tūkino ōkiko (Forgery)** - Forgery involves creating a false document; the passage describes altering an existing one.
*   **D: tāhae (Theft)** - Theft involves taking property; the passage focuses on financial deceit.



"
"I a ia e huri ana i te tohu, he aha te mea kihai i mahia e te whakapae?","The correct answer is **D: Whakamahia ngā tarpaulins hei whakakē** (Use tarpaulins to block).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""i whakamahia te whakarerekētanga ki ngā tāpōrena pango kua whakarākeitia ki ngā tohu o te rangimārie me te manawa hei panoni i te """"O"""" kia noho hei """"e"""" pūriki."" This means they used black tarpaulins (āroha) arranged to resemble peace signs and hearts to obscure the ""O"" and make it look like an ""e"".  ""Whakakē"" means to block or obscure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hurihia tētahi o ana reta** (Turn one of his letters) - The passage doesn't mention letters.
*   **B: Whakatau ki tētahi tohu rangimārie** (Turn to a peace sign) - While they *used* peace signs, the key action described is *using tarpaulins arranged* as peace signs, not just turning to one.
*   **C: Tūkino ā-tinana** (Physical impact) - There's no indication of a physical impact.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakapaea e te kaiako English Karno?","The correct answer is **B: mā te noho ki tētahi ākonga (being close to a student)**.

Here's why:

The passage states Karno was accused of:

*   **Using inappropriate language towards parents.**
*   **Potentially creating a ""gang"" in the classroom.**
*   **Modern Education denying the validity of the claims and portraying him as a crucial English teacher.**
*   **Being charged with serious abuse of authority, but not yet convicted.**
*   **A student alleging he used vulgar language, emphasized insecure skills, and was an ""unsupportive"" student.**

The passage *doesn't* mention being close to a student as an accusation. The other options (using inappropriate language, the denial of the claims, and using vulgar language) are all explicitly mentioned or implied.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kaore nei i taunutia e Rolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā tūruhi (The tourists)**.

The text states: ""Puhia e Rolando Mendoze tana raiwhara M16 ki ngā tūruhi."" which translates to ""Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.""  The question asks who Rolando Mendoza *did not* target. Therefore, the answer is the tourists.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, kāore i whakaūngia ngā taupānga i te wā e tukua wawetia ana?","The correct answer is **A: Nga tūruhi (The students)**.

The passage states: ""Kua wetekina wawetia, **ka pērā hoki ngā kaiwhakaahua nō Piripaina**."" (The students were also affected, similar to the photographers in Peru).  This implies the students (tūruhi) were the ones who were affected by the attacks.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai e kohikohi waitohu ana hei tautoko i te whakamana i te mārena ōrite i Paratira?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā kaiwhakahē (The opponents)**.

The text states: ""He mea ū te whakahē a te Hāhi Katorika Rōmana i te whakaaetanga ā-ture ki te mārena takatāpui ki te whenua rā."" This translates to ""The Roman Catholic Church has a strong opposition to the legal recognition of same-sex marriage in the country."" It also mentions that the law is currently with Roberto Jefferson, but the opponents (kaiwhakahē) are the ones gathering signatures to present to the National Congress.
"
Ko wai e hoatu ai e ngā kaiwhakatuma ā rātou tono?,"The correct answer is **C: Te Rōpū ā Iwi o Parīhi (The Parihi People's Group)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kua 10 tau e tautohetohe ana te National Congress o Parihi mō te whakature..."" This indicates that the Parihi People's Group has been advocating for this law for 10 years.  The text further mentions that they are aiming to gather 1.2 million signatures for the National Congress.
"
"E ai ki te kōrero a Armand Versace, he aha te mea i tupu i mua tonu i te tīmata o te mano ki te urupare ki te rangi?","The correct answer is **A: Kua tīmata te whatu (It started raining)**.

The passage states: ""Kua tīmata te whatu, engari ka pērā rawa te kaha..."" which translates to ""It started raining, but the strength was the same...""  The rest of the passage describes the worsening conditions after the rain started.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E rima meneti i muri i te whakaaturanga (Five minutes after the show):** The passage says the wind started a minute after the show began.
* **C: He hau taumaha (Strong wind):**  While the wind was strong, the passage describes the *start* of the rain and the wind's effect *after* the rain began.
* **D: I ngaro i a ia te ara o tētahi mema whānau (He lost the way of a family member):** Armand Versace mentions losing his son and his friend, but this isn't what happened *before* the rain started. It's the reason for his concern *because* of the bad weather.



"
"E ai ki a Versace, i te wā i tīmata ai ngā hau kaha rawa?","The correct answer is **A: I ētahi meneti i muri i te tīmatanga o te whakaaturanga**.

The text states: ""Ka rima meneti i muri i te tīmatanga o te whakaaturanga ka tīmata tētahi hau te pupuhi..."" which translates to ""Five minutes after the start of the show, a gust of wind began...""  This directly answers the question of when the strong winds started.
"
"I mua i a Fred, e hia nga tupuhi nui i tuhia ki te rawhiti o te 35°W?","The correct answer is **B: Toru**.

The question states: ""...ko te haumātakataka matua tuatoru anake kua pūrongotia ki te rāwhiti o 35 tākiri ki te Uru."" which translates to ""...only the third major cyclone has been reported west of 35 degrees West.""  Therefore, there were three major cyclones reported.
"
"I te wā i tū a Fred i te taha o ngā motu o Cape Verde, he aha te aronga i ahu ai?","The correct answer is **C: Rāwhiti** (West).

The passage states: ""Ko Fred te haumātakataka takiwā pārū kaha rawa kua pūrongotia mai ki tēnei wā ki te **tonga me te rāwhiti** ki te Atlantic..."" which translates to ""Fred is a powerful tropical cyclone that has been forecast at this time to the **east and west** of the Atlantic...""  Since the question asks where Fred was when it passed the Cape Verde Islands, and the passage explicitly mentions it was forecast to the west, the answer is Rāwhiti (West).
"
Ko wai o enei e whai ake nei he tere ake te tere atu i o mua?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The question states that 802.11n is significantly faster than its predecessors (802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g), with speeds up to 600Mbit/s.  The other options (802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a) are all older standards and slower."
He aha te mea e hiahiatia ana kia hototahi ai te 802.11n ki te 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **A: He tere ake te tere** (It's a faster speed).

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Ngā tere o te 802.11n he tino tere ake i tērā o ngā mea o mua ko tā rātou putanga ariā nui rawa ko te 600Mbit/s."" (The speeds of 802.11n are much faster than the previous ones, with their maximum rated speed being 600Mbit/s.)

* **The question asks:** ""He aha te mea e hiahiatia ana kia hototahi ai te 802.11n ki te 802.11b?"" (What is needed to compare 802.11n to 802.11b?)  The most fundamental difference between 802.11n and 802.11b is speed. While 802.11n uses both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, the core improvement is its much faster data transfer rate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko te kaha mō te 802.11b hei mahi i te 5.0Ghz** (The ability of 802.11b to operate on the 5.0GHz band): 802.11b *cannot* operate on the 5.0GHz band. It only uses the 2.4GHz band. 802.11n *can* operate on both.
* **C: He tautohe o te 600Mbit/s** (A coincidence of 600Mbit/s):  The 600Mbit/s is the *maximum rated speed* of 802.11n, not a coincidence.
* **D: Ngā reo irirangi takirua** (The wider radio frequencies): While 802.11n uses wider radio frequencies (including 5GHz), this isn't the primary aspect to *compare* it to 802.11b.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided information.
"
E hia ngā whakataetae i tae atu ai te toa koura o te Olympics ki ngā kēmu Commonwealth?,"The correct answer is **B: Toru**.

The question states the swimmer was aiming for three events at the Commonwealth Games.
"
He aha i kore ai te toa koura o te Olympics e tango rongoā mō tōna mamae?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore e whakaaetia i ngā kēmu Commonwealth** (He was not allowed to compete in the Commonwealth Games).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuaore ia i āhei te kai i ngā pūroi e hiahiatia ana hei where i tana mamae nā te mea kei te aukatihai i ngā Kēmu.""  This translates to: ""He was not allowed to get treatment for his pain because it was prohibited by the Games.""  This implies the rules of the Olympics/Games prevented him from seeking medical attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaore i mamae a ia** (He didn't have pain) - The passage specifically mentions pain (""mamae"").
*   **B: Nāna a ia i mate ai** (He died) - The passage doesn't state he died, it says his ability was not well-known *because* of illness.
*   **C: I māharahara a ia ka pā kino ki tōna kaha** (He forgot and was worried about his strength) - This is not supported by the passage. The passage focuses on the rules preventing medical treatment.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea i pōraruraru ai mo te mahi rū?","The best answer is **A: Te aroaro o nga kapua pōuri** (The observation of dark clouds).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Nā ngā kapua pōuri i rangirua ai mēnā rānei kua pahū tūturu mai."" (The dark clouds may have caused it, or it may have erupted violently). This directly links the dark clouds to the possible cause of the seismic activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ngā pūrongo mai i te Tari Tirorangi Tiorangiana (Reports from the USGS)** While the USGS reports *no* earthquakes, the passage isn't saying their reports *caused* the seismic activity. It's simply stating their observation.
* **C: Te mahere rū o te ao whānui (Global earthquake map)** The global earthquake map was simply not showing earthquakes in Iceland, it's not directly related to *why* the seismic activity happened.
* **D: I pūrongotia ngā ngohe i ētahi atu wāhi o Tiorangiana (Earthquakes were reported in other parts of Iceland)** The passage doesn't mention earthquakes being reported elsewhere in Iceland.

Therefore, the dark clouds are presented as the most likely immediate trigger or observation related to the seismic event."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā i puta ai tētahi huringa wāhanga?","The correct answer is **A: I mua i te 10 o Poutū**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nā ngā mahi rū hira i reira i puta mai te panoni wā i tū i te 10 o Māehe..."" which translates to ""The seismic activity resulted in a tremor that occurred on the 10th of May..."" 

Therefore, the change happened *before* the 10th of May. Option A (""I mua i te 10 o Poutū"" - Before the 10th of May) is the closest and most accurate reflection of this.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te pūtirotiro marama a Chandrayaan-1 ehara i te pono?,"The correct answer is **A: He kaimahi to te kaiāwhiti nāna i whakarewa te rūpahu** (The astronaut revealed the module).

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the scientific instruments and the successful lunar impact.** It doesn't mention any astronaut or the revelation of a module.
* **B: Kei roto i te tirotiro nga taputapu tino nui** (The major instruments were included in the observation) - This is supported by the passage stating the mission carried ""ngā taputapu pūtaiao hira e toru"" (three scientific instruments).
* **C: I angitu te pananga o te tirotiro** (The observation's landing was successful) - The passage clearly states, ""ka angitū te tau iho pātata nei ki te pou tonga o te Marama"" (the year's landing was successful near the south pole of the Moon).
* **D: Kua peitatia e te rūpahu nga taha** (The module was photographed on all sides) - The passage explicitly says, ""kua peitatia ki ngā taha katoa"" (was photographed on all sides).

Therefore, statement A is the only one not supported by the provided text.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i te pūtaiao marama?,"The correct answer is **B: He angitu tana taunga tukinga (Its landing was successful)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te waka ātea kore tangata e huri ana i te marama ko Chandrayaan-1 i unu i tana Taputapu Tutuki Marama (MIP), i whiti atu ai i te mata o te marama i te 1.5 kiromita ia hēkona (3000 mairo ia hāora), ka angitū te tau iho pātata nei ki te pou tonga o te Marama."" (The unmanned spacecraft Chandrayaan-1 used its Lunar Laser Ranging Instrument (LLR) to bounce off the surface of the Moon at 1.5 kilometers per hour (3000 miles per hour), successfully landing near the south pole of the Moon.)

This clearly indicates a successful landing, making option B the most accurate reflection of the passage's information about the lunar environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I ū ki te taha ki te taha ki te raki o te Marama (It aimed to the north side of the Moon):** The passage mentions landing *near the south pole*, not aiming for the north.
* **C: I werohia mai i te āwhiotanga tārewa (It was launched by a satellite):** The passage describes a *spacecraft*, not a satellite, and doesn't mention being launched by a satellite.
* **D: E rua nga taputapu tino nui e mau ana (Two major instruments were held):** The passage mentions *three* instruments were carried to take images of the lunar surface.



"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea te mehua parenga ki te mate ka whakatinanatia whakamutunga?","The correct answer is **A: Pesticides**.

The passage states: ""Nā te tino pikinga i te mahi te kāwanatanga o Īnia i ētahi mahi pērā i te tuku i ngā kaiwhakamau poaka ki ngā wāhi e tino pāngia ana, te tuku i ngā tini mano ārai naenae, me te uwhiuwhi i ngā paturiha."" This translates to ""The significant improvement in the work of the Indian government included tasks such as deploying pesticide sprayers to severely affected areas, distributing millions of mosquito nets, and clearing breeding grounds.""

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates the use of pesticides as a key measure to combat the encephalitis outbreak. The passage also mentions ""ārai mate encephalitis"" which translates to encephalitis mosquito. 

The other options are not mentioned in the context of treatment for this particular outbreak.
"
Me pēhea te whakawhiti o te mate ki te tangata?,"The correct answer is **C: Poaka (Pigs)**.

The passage states: ""I pūrongotia ngā kēhi tuatahi o te tahumaero i tēnei kaupeka i te mutunga o Hōngongoi. Kei te kawea te tahumaero e te poaka, kātahi ka neke ki te tangata ki te naenae."" This translates to: ""The first cases of the outbreak in this region were reported at the end of June. The fever is carried by the pig, then it spreads to humans gradually.""

Therefore, the fever is transmitted from pigs to humans.
"
He aha te hua o te rahunga o te rerenga tuarua?,"The correct answer is **B: He mana ā muri ake ki ngā whakakotahitanga ā-iwi ōrite (A future option for same-sex unions)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the passage of the second marriage bill (HJR-2) ""would pave the way for civil unions to be opened up as time goes on."" This directly implies that the goal of the second marriage bill was to create a future possibility for civil unions, which are a step towards marriage equality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He arotakenga wawe o HJR-3 (An immediate review of HJR-3):** While HJR-3 *will* be reviewed, the passage doesn't say this is the immediate outcome or the primary goal of passing HJR-2.
* **C: He hui ture ohorere (A legal conference):** The passage refers to the passing of a bill, not a conference.
* **D: Te whakakorenga o nga whakakotahitanga ā iwi ōrite (The legalization of civil unions):**  The bill doesn't *legalize* civil unions; it creates a pathway *towards* them.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te mukutanga o te rerenga tuarua?","The correct answer is **A: I te hui ture**.

The passage states: ""Kua tīningia tēnei huihuinga ture i te whakakorenga o te karawhiunga tuarua e te Whare o Ngā Mema..."" which translates to ""This legislative proposal was introduced in the Assembly of Members...""  This means the proposal was introduced *during* the legislative session. While the passage mentions 2011, it's the *legislative session* (huihuinga ture) where it was introduced.
"
"""Ki a wai i puta mai ai ngā """"Panama Papers""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Te umanga o Mossack Fonseca**.

The text states: ""Ko te """"Pepa Panama"""" he tapanga amarara mō ngā pukapuka e tekau miriona mai i te whare ture Panama Mossack Fonseca..."" (The ""Panama Papers"" is a leak of ten million documents from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca...).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko wai i kī te press Ingarangi e whakahaere ana i te nuinga o ngā kamupene i whakamahia hei huna i te taonga?","The correct answer is **C: Te Pēke Pānui (The Guardian)**.

The text states: ""I tutuki ai tēnei āhuatanga nā te mea ko tōna hautoru i roto i te 1200 ngā kamupene i tiakina e Deutsche Bank. **I tū ngā porotēhi puta noa i te ao, he nui ngā hāmenetanga hara, ā, i heke katoa atu ngā rangatira o Iceland me Pakiston i ō rātou tūranga.**"" This indicates that the British newspaper, The Guardian, was responsible for exposing the information about the companies used to hide wealth.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā aitua rererangi e whai ake nei i tino mate?,"The correct answer is **D: I hinga te waka rererangi i Mashhad**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""I tērā marama tonu i kitea anō tētahi waka rererangi e pahemo ana i te ara rerenga ki Mashhad, ā, ka tūtuki ki tētahi pakitara, ka mate te tekau mā whitu."" This translates to: ""In that same month, another airplane was found crashed on the route to Mashhad, and it crashed into a cliff, killing seventeen.""

While options A and C are related to crashes, option D is the only one that directly mentions a specific incident and location described in the text. Option B is too general.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te take mo te tini o nga aitua rererangi e puta ana i Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko ngā whiu e ārai ana i ngā hoko waka rererangi hou** (The birds are repairing the purchase of new airplanes).

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that international sanctions prevent Iran from buying new airplanes. This is a major contributing factor to the aging fleet.
*   The passage mentions that an ancient fleet of large airplanes is causing problems.
*   It also mentions the lack of funds to purchase new planes.
*   There is *no* mention whatsoever of birds repairing airplane purchases. This is clearly an incorrect and illogical option.

Therefore, option C is the only one that doesn't align with the information presented in the passage."
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakaurua ki te pūrongo a te Rōpū Ako mo Iraki?,"The correct answer is **A: He whakahē i te kaupapahere o nāianei** (A challenge to the current administration).

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states the report emphasizes **avoiding any action that could escalate the conflict** and **doesn't challenge the current administration's policies**.  It focuses on a broader consensus and agreement with the US.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the text:

* **B: He whakapuakanga mā ētahi huringa ka taea te karo i te piki haere o te tutu i Iraki** (A plan through certain changes that could avoid escalation of violence in Iraq): The report advocates for a new agenda to stabilize Iraq and re-establish links with regional allies.
* **C: Ngā tūtohutanga kia haumaru ai ngā taitapa o Iraki** (Recommendations to ensure the safety of Iraqis): The report heavily focuses on the governance of Iraq and proposes a new perspective.
* **D: He inoi mo tētahi whakaaetanga ki a Mātau** (A request for an agreement with the Soviets):  The report suggests a new agenda be put forward before the end of the year with the goal of restructuring the Iraqi country lists to combat those who are attempting to undermine them and re-establish links between small partners.



"
Ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei kāore i whakatenatenahia e te Rōpū Ako mo Iraki i roto i tana pūrongo?,"The correct answer is **B: He huringa aronga ināianei tonu (An immediate shift in strategy)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states the Iraq Study Group emphasizes **no single action should be prioritized** in the current situation. It advocates for a broader, more comprehensive approach.  A ""huringa aronga ināianei tonu"" (immediate shift in strategy) directly contradicts this emphasis on a balanced, multi-faceted approach.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: Kia whakapuakina he taurangi kia mutu ai te piki haere o te tutu (Establish a timeline to end the escalation of violence):** The report advocates for a new plan with specific goals, implying a timeline.
* **C: Te whakamahinga o te taupatupatu tuwhera (The use of an open-ended mandate):** The report suggests a new mandate for the Iraqi government to address insurgents and rebuild connections.
* **D: Te whakatūnga o tētahi mahi whakawhanaunga hou (The establishment of a new diplomatic initiative):**  The report highlights the importance of rebuilding relationships with neighboring countries, indicating a new diplomatic initiative.



"
"E ai ki te pirihimana, ko wai i whakaarohia hei ringa matau o Provenzano?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""E kī te pirihimana i a Lo Piccolo te ringa haka i te mea ko ia te ringa katau o Provenzano i Palermo..."" which translates to ""The security said that Lo Piccolo was the right hand of Provenzano because he was Provenzano's enforcer in Palermo...""
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te take o te matenga o Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: I patua a ia i te wā o te whawhai ā-Anaina.**

The text states: ""...i whakamate i ngā hōia Mafia i a Giovanni Falcone me Paolo Borsellino i te 1992."" This directly links their deaths to the ""war"" (riiri pakanga) with the Mafia.  While the text mentions Lo Piccolo's role in the power struggle, it doesn't state he directly ordered Falcone's assassination. The overall context implies Falcone's death was part of the larger conflict.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei ehara i te mea he whakamoemiti a Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **C: E rua nga wā o te toa koura o Orangirangi** (Two-time Olympic gold medalist).

Here's why:

* **The text states he was a two-time Olympic gold medalist.** This makes option A correct.
* **The text states he was the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation.** This makes option B correct.
* **The text *does not* mention him being a two-time Olympic gold medalist.** It mentions he was a two-time world champion, but not an Olympic gold medalist.
* **The text explicitly states he was a Judo expert.** This makes option D correct.



Therefore, option C is the only statement that is *not* confirmed in the text.



"
I pēhea a Iwasaki i āhei ai ki te karo i te whakaari?,"The correct answer is **B: Nepōra**.

The passage states: ""I pakiha ia i te mārenatanga i Nepōra..."" which translates to ""He settled in the monastery in Nepora..."" This indicates Nepora is where he evaded prosecution.
"
Ko wai i whakaekea a Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Pirates (The Pirates)**.

The text states Iwasaki was captured by pirates. 

The text says he was ""tukia ia i Tipete e tētahi kurī kua pāngia e te reipi"" which translates to ""thrown by a dog affected by the poison in Tipete"" - this isn't the main event of being captured. The pirates are the ones who ultimately captured him.
"
Nonahea a Alonso i mutu ai tana reihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Whai muri i te pakaru o Schumacher i tana wira o mua** (After Schumacher's front wing broke).

The text states: ""Ko tana hoa ko Fernando Alonso i te ārahi i te reihi mō te nuinga, heoi i mutu whai muri i tana tau ki te taunga waka, akuanei pea i pēnei i te mea i raruraru te wīrā katau o mua. Kaore i roa i muri mai i a Alonso ka mutu te reihi a Michael Schumacher i te mea o ngā pakarūtanga ki te mihini i roto i ngā whawhai tini o te reihi."" (His teammate Fernando Alonso led most of the race, but finished after his year as the team driver, soon after the front wing of his car was damaged. Not long after Alonso, Michael Schumacher's race ended due to mechanical failures in numerous battles during the race.)

This directly links Alonso's end of the race to Schumacher's mechanical failure *after* Alonso's race ended.  Option A accurately reflects this sequence of events.
"
He aha te take i mutu wawe ai te whakataetae a Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **D: Tūkino ki te whakatārewatanga o te motokā (Engine failure)**.

The provided text states: ""Michael Schumacher i te mea o ngā pakarūtanga ki te mihini i roto i ngā whawhai tini o te reihi."" This translates to ""Michael Schumacher due to mechanical failures in many races.""

Therefore, the reason for Schumacher's early retirement was engine failure.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ma wai te mahi ki te whakatakoto putea mo te hunga mauheretia?","The correct answer is **A: Te āpiha hopu**.

The text states: ""I te Aperira o tēnei tau, i tukua mai e te Tiati e Glynn tētahi pupuritanga mauhere mō nāianei hei whakakaha i te hunga i mauheretia neke atu i te 24 haora whai muri i te unuhanga mai...""  This indicates that the booking app (te āpiha hopu) is implementing a system to manage the release of detainees. The next sentence says, ""Katahi ka tomo ngā hāmene ki te pūnaha rorohiko teiti ki reira kite ai te kēhi,"" which implies the app is the one managing the release process and the associated data.
"
"E ai ki te ture ārai āwhinatanga e whakahuatia ana i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te mea e whakaaetia ana kia mau ki te hunga i hopukina kia roa ake i te 24 haora?","The correct answer is **B: He hui me te āpiha hopu (A hearing with the bail application).**

The passage states: ""I te Aperira o tēnei tau, i tukua mai e te Tiati e Glynn tētahi pupuritanga mauhere mō nāianei hei whakakaha i te hunga i mauheretia neke atu i te 24 haora whai muri i te unuhanga mai, ā, kāore i whakawākia e te komihana kooti.""  This translates to: ""In April of this year, the Prosecutor Glynn submitted a bail application for now to enforce those arrested more than 24 hours after the arrest, and the court did not grant it.""  The court *not* granting the application is the key point.  The passage then goes on to explain the process for getting a hearing.

Therefore, the passage indicates a *hearing* is required before someone can be held longer than 24 hours.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea te take kāore i whakamahia hei whakamārama i te whakahaerenga kua whakakorea?","The correct answer is **D: Rangirua ā-kaupapa (Ideological disputes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Lodin's actions were to improve the lives of Afghans from debts and protection fees *related to a previous conflict*.  It then mentions that government intermediaries cited a precedent from the New Zealand law regarding the waterways to prevent the river's commercialization. Finally, it notes that other reports claim that if the community is blocked, it violates the rule of law.

The core conflict isn't about safety (A), a direct challenge to the law (B), or the cost of things (C).  The conflict is about the *ideological* disagreement over whether the river should be commercialized or remain free. This disagreement is what prompted the government intervention.



"
He aha te take i whakaarohia ai e ngā kaitōrangapū kāore he take o te putanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Tērā te rangirua i roto i te kaupapa ture (The constitution is involved in the matter)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Nā ngā takawaenga kāwanatanga i kī kua pērā rawa te rangirua ki te ture kāwana o Āwhekenetāna kia whakatauria ai ehara i te mea waiwai te rerenga ake.""  This translates to: ""Government officials said the constitution is similar to the constitutional law of Afghanistan, which must be upheld to ensure the river cannot be owned.""

This directly links the reason for the courts' decision to the constitutional framework. The other options aren't mentioned or supported by the text.



"
Ko wai e whakarato ana i ngā ratonga whakawa mō FATA?,"The correct answer is **A: Te kāwanatanga o Pakistan**.

The passage states: ""Kei te noho haepapa ēnei kaiwhakahaere mō te tuku i ngā ratonga ā-kāwanatanga..."" which translates to ""These administrators are posted to provide government services...""  Since FATA is within Pakistan, the Pakistani government is responsible for providing those services.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki “Ngā Māngai Tūturu” a FATA ehara i te tika?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Ka homai e rātau he ratonga whakawā (They provide security)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the administrators of FATA were appointed to manage government services and courts *under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution*. This indicates they were responsible for governance and administration, not primarily security. While security might be *part* of their responsibilities, the main focus highlighted is on providing governmental and judicial services.

The other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: I tīpakohia rātau e te perehitini o Pakistan (They were appointed by the President of Pakistan):** The passage explicitly states this.
*   **C: E piri ana rātau ki te kaupapa ture o pakistan (They are connected to the legal framework of Pakistan):** The passage references Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.
*   **D: Kua oti i a rātau te mana mo ētahi wāhi (They have held authority for some time):** The passage implies a history of administration, suggesting they had authority for a period.



"
He aha te tohu i tohua ai a Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Kaiwhakaari Tino Pai**.

The text states: ""Ko ētahi ingoa kē atu kua whakaurungia ko te Pikitia Pai, te kaihautu, te kiriataata, te Hoahoa Tākahu, te Whakatika Kiriata, te Tohu Tuatahi, te Hanga Hoahoa, te Whakapai Oro, te Whakaranu Oro me te **Kiriata Taketakenga**.""  Since Emma Stone is being nominated for Best Actress, ""Kaiwhakaari Tino Pai"" (Best Actress) is the correct translation.
"
Ko tehea te tohu kāore i tohua te kiriata?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā Rākeitanga Arokite Tino Pai (Best Screenplay)**.

The question states the film received nominations in many categories, including Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Picture, Director, etc.  It also mentions the songs received a nomination for Best Original Song, and that Lionsgate received the most nominations. However, Best Screenplay is *not* listed among the nominations.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei i mahi tonu i muri i te ruu?,"The correct answer is **B: Te taunga rererangi i Ishikawa**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""kua kati tonu te wāhi Noto Airport ki Ishikawa"" which translates to ""Noto Airport in Ishikawa remains closed."" This indicates the airport is still closed *after* the earthquake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā pūrere katoa i te tipu Shika o Hokuriku** - The text says the Shika power plant's Units 1 and 2 were shut down.
* **C: Ratonga rerewhenua katoa** - The text mentions railway service was disrupted, but doesn't say *all* railway service was down.
* **D: He tipu hiko i Niigata** - The text states that the power plants in Niigata are operating normally.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei i kino i te ruu?","The correct answer is **A: Ētahi kāinga (Some households)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kua pūrongotia ko tōna 9400 ngā kāinga ki te takiwā kua kore wai..."" which translates to ""It is reported that approximately 9400 households in the affected area have lost water...""  This directly indicates that households were affected.

While options C and D are also mentioned, option A is the most comprehensive and directly addresses *what* was impacted (households). Option B is too specific and refers to a particular power station. Option C is also correct, but less comprehensive than A.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā take e whai ake nei kāore i whakaurua ki te tuhinga?","The correct answer is **C: Te aroaro o te hōia i te riu (The destruction of the riu)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions the occupation of Palestinian territories *before* the 1967 war, the status of Jerusalem, and the Jordan Valley.
* The passage *does* mention the 1967 war as a reference point for the occupation.
* The passage discusses the potential for Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley.

There is no mention of the destruction of the riu (the sea) in the text. Therefore, C is the correct answer.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te mea e hiahiatia ana e Palestine?,"The correct answer is **D: E rima tau te aroaro o te hōia i te Rawa o Jordan**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what Palestine *doesn't* need.** The text states that the PA is asking for Israeli troops to withdraw from the Jordan Valley for *three years*, not ten years as mentioned in option D. Therefore, a five-year troop presence is not what Palestine is asking for.

Let's look at why the other options *are* things Palestine is concerned about:

* **A: Ngā taitapa i runga anō i ngā here whawhai tōmua (The borders based on pre-war fighting lines):** This is a core issue of the conflict and something the text mentions.
* **B: Kei te haere tonu nga hoia ki te Rawa o Jordan (Israeli troops continuing to occupy the Jordan Valley):** The text directly addresses the Israeli occupation of the Jordan Valley and the PA's request for withdrawal.
* **C: Ngā whakautu e pā ana ki te wā heke mai o te Jerusalem (Settlements related to the emergence of Jerusalem):** The text mentions Hiruharama (settlements) and their status, particularly concerning Jerusalem and the Jordan Valley.



"
I whea whenua i ako ai a Ma i te ture?,"The correct answer is **A: United States of America**.

The passage states: ""...ā, ka ako ki Te whare Wānanga o New York me te Kura Ture o Harvard, ā, i tōna wā i whai ia i tētahi """"kāri kākāriki"""" kainoho ū o Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika.""  This translates to ""...and then studied at Columbia University and Harvard Law School, and at one point obtained a long-term visa for the United States of America.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te tautoko i tehea whenua i āwhina i te wikitōria o Ma?","The correct answer is **A: United States of America**.

The passage states: ""i tōna wā i whai ia i tētahi """"kāri kākāriki"""" kainoho ū o Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika."" This translates to ""at the time he obtained a permanent residency card of the United States of America."" This indicates the United States supported Ma in some way, likely through the residency card, which facilitated his movements and endeavors.
"
"E ai ki te kōrero i roto i te wāhanga, ko wai i mahi ai a Carolyn Wilson i mua i tana wehe atu i te taone?","The correct answer is **C: Te OHA**.

The passage states: ""...tāhae a Carolyn Wilson nō te OHA i ā rātou utu whakahaumaru..."" which means Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA.
"
"Me ngā iwi e whā e toe ana i te wā, ko wai kai te wāhi tuawhā o te Whakataetae Atekōkiri?","The correct answer is **D: Bowyer**.

The passage states: ""...e rima ngā piro ki mua i a Bowyer."" This means Bowyer is in fourth place.
"
"Whai muri i te whakataetae i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, e hia ngā tohu a Kahne i te Pirimia Kaiwhakahaere?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Kei a Kahne, kei te tuaono a Truex, Jr., ā, me ngā piro e **2,220** me te 2,207."" This means Kahne has 2220 points.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, e hia nga wā i kite ai te tangata i te takanga o nga matakōkiri e kitea ana he take o te martian ā muri ake?","The correct answer is **C: Tekau mā rima nga wā**.

The passage states: ""Tekau mā rima o ēnei toka kua tohua nā te rerenga matakōkiri i tērā Hōngongoi."" which translates to ""Ten of these stones have been marked due to the meteorite fall last June.""  ""Ēnei toka"" refers to the stones that have been returned from Matawhero. The question asks about the number of times people have *seen* the meteorite stones. The passage indicates that ten of the stones have been marked, implying ten instances where they were discovered and identified as meteorite fragments.
"
"Ka rite ki te mea i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te pono o nga toka kua kitea he Martian te takenga mai?","The correct answer is **A: I kitea katoa rātou i te wā o te ua meteorite o Hōngongoi**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Tekau mā rima o ēnei toka kua tohua nā te rerenga matakōkiri i tērā Hōngongoi."" (Ten of these stones were identified due to the meteor shower last June.)
* Option A directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: E 24,000 o rātau** - This is the total number of known Martian meteorites, not the number *found* recently.
* **C: E wātea ana rātau ki te $11,000 neke atu i te koura** - This refers to the price of a single stone, not where they were *found*.
* **D: E 34 o rātau** - This is the number of stones that have been *authenticated* as Martian, not where they were found.
"
No hea i haere ai a Schumacher?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i te whakakapi i a Felipe Massa**.

The question states: ""P: I rite ki te whakakapi i a Felipe Massa kua whara, a Schumacher nāna i rītaia i te tau 2006...""  This directly links Schumacher's actions to Massa's accident. So the answer is that Schumacher reacted *after* Massa's accident.
"
No hea i whara ai a Massa?,"The correct answer is **A: I te wa o te Grand Prix**.

The passage states: ""Kei te pāngia te tangata no Parihi e tētahi whara upoko tino kino whai muri i tētahi tukituki i te Hungarian Grand Prix i te tau 2009."" (The Parisian man was hit by a very serious head injury following a crash at the Hungarian Grand Prix in 2009.) 

This directly indicates the crash, and therefore the injury, happened during the Grand Prix.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me pēhea te pānga o te whakaritenga ki AOL?","The correct answer is **C: Ka whakataetae te maha o ngā kaiwhakamahi o AOL ki ngā kaiwhakamahi o Yahoo me Microsoft.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the merging of Yahoo! and Microsoft users will ""take away the readership of AOL.""
* This implies that AOL users will likely shift to Yahoo! and Microsoft's IM services, leading to competition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka nui ake pea te maha o ngā kaiwhakamahi o AOL:** The passage suggests the opposite - a decrease in AOL users due to the merger.
* **B: Ko AOL anake te kamupene i hangaia te mākete IM:** The passage indicates that AOL *quickly* developed its IM market, but it doesn't say they created it alone.
* **D: Kua kore te AOL e whakamahia i Te Hononga o Amerika:** The passage doesn't mention AOL ceasing to be used in America; it focuses on the impact of the merger.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka mutu i muri i te whakaritenga hou?,"The correct answer is **B: Te whakamahinga o te mākete IM**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that AOL rapidly developed its IM market *because* of its high usage in the US.
* The passage then says that the merger of Yahoo!'s and Microsoft's users would likely *end* AOL's messaging (IM) dominance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whanaketanga whānui o te Ipurangi i te United States:** The passage doesn't directly link the merger to the overall development of the internet in the US.
* **C: Te herekore o AOL ki te whakawhanake i te mākete i tōna ake tere:**  The passage is describing *how* AOL developed its market, not if they will stop developing markets entirely.
* **D: Ko te hononga a Yahoo me Microsoft:** The passage states the *users* of Yahoo! and Microsoft will merge, not the companies themselves.



"
E hia ngā tāngata i mate i te whakaeke ehara i te pirihimana?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The question states: ""It was said by the government office that eleven of those killed were soldiers.""  Therefore, 19 people died who were *not* soldiers.
"
Na wai i pūrongo te whakapae i te whakaeke?,"The correct answer is **A: Pirihimana (Police)**.

The text states: ""He whakapae ana ngā pirihimana ko te tangata tūkino he hōia Daesh (ISIL)."" which translates to ""The police are alleging that the perpetrator is a Daesh (ISIL) soldier."" 

Therefore, the police are the ones making the allegation.
"
"Nā te tūnga o Florida hei kāwanatanga toa-ka tango-katoa, he aha te mea i whakawhiwhia ki a Mitt Romney?","The correct answer is **D: 46 ōrau o te pōti**.

The question states that Mitt Romney won 46% of the vote in Florida.  The passage then goes on to say this was a significant victory, and he was aiming for a strong showing to boost his Republican party campaign.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te ōrau o ngā pōti i whiwhi a Gingrich i te pōtitanga tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: 32 ōrau**.

The text states: ""I tuarua mai te Kaikōrero o te Whare o Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika o mua a Newt Gingrich, ki te 32 ōrau."" (Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich was surpassed by 32 points.)
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai kāore i haere tonu i muri i ngā hua o te hui?","The correct answer is **C: Perry**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Perry said he would ""hoki atu ki Texas hei arotake i ngā putanga o te kāhui..."" (return to Texas to assess the state's elections...) and then later said he would ""noho tonu ia ki te rēhi me te whakataetae ki te tuatahi"" (continue in the race and compete for first place). This indicates he *did* stay in the race.
* The passage indicates Bachmann withdrew (""whakaoti i tana whawhai"" - withdrew her campaign).
* While Gingrich and Romney are mentioned, there's no explicit statement about them withdrawing. However, the focus is on the others considering their options.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i kōrero nui tētahi atu kaitono i muri i te hua o te kararehe?","The correct answer is **A: Bachmann**.

The text states: ""Whakatau a Bachmana, nāna i toa ki te Ames Straw Poll i Here-turi-kōkā, ki te whakaoti i tana whawhai."" This directly translates to ""Bachmann, who won the Ames Straw Poll in Iowa, withdrew from the race.""
"
I hea te wāhi anake i whakaatuhia ai te whakaaturanga i mua i te tau 2015?,"The correct answer is **A: Reo Irirangi TogiNet**.

The passage states: ""I ōna rā tīmatanga, i whakaaturia anake te hōtaka ki te pae tukutuku reo irirangi ā-ipurangi kua roa e tū ana a TogiNet Radio...""  This means the program was initially broadcast on TogiNet Radio.
"
He aha te āhua o te whakaahuatanga a te teihana i te whakaaturanga?,"The correct answer is **B: Geeky**.

Here's why:

The phrase ""whakaari ā-reo irirangi o mua me te āhuatanga hou, kino te pakihawa!"" (showing old-school radio and new features, great sound quality!) suggests a focus on technical details and potentially niche interests. ""Geeky"" best captures this tone – it implies enthusiasm for technology and perhaps a slightly unconventional or specialized interest.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Amateur:** While radio can be amateur, the description doesn't specifically highlight an amateur aspect.
*   **C: kura tawhito:** (Old school) While it mentions ""old-school radio"", the overall tone is more enthusiastic and tech-focused than just nostalgic.
*   **D: Paetata:** (Potato - meaning basic or low quality) The description actually praises ""kino te pakihawa!"" (great sound quality!), which is the opposite of ""paetata"".



"
He aha te mea i kohia e David Headley i āwhina i te whakaeke a te rōpū hōia?,"The correct answer is **A: Mōhiohio (Intelligence)**.

The text states that David Headley's ""mahi pūraohua me te nanao ki ngā kōiriiritanga"" (intelligence gathering and reporting) helped coordinate the attack. Therefore, he provided intelligence that aided the terrorist group.
"
He aha te momo waka i whakamahia e te rōpū hoariri ki te haere ki Mumbai?,"The correct answer is **C: Waka**.

The passage states ""I ahu mai ngā kai patu Mumbai **mā runga poti**..."" which translates to ""The Mumbai attackers arrived **by boat**..."".  ""Waka"" is the Māori word for boat.
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e whakaatu tika ana i te putanga o te whakataetae Nadal me Raonic's Brisbane Open i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga?,"The correct answer is **C: I patua e Nadal a Raonic**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ko te mauhanga kanohi ki te kanohi o Nadal ki te Kānata he 7-2."" This means Nadal won 7-2 against Raonic.
* It also mentions Nadal's win percentage: ""I riro i a Nadal ngā piro 88% i te whakataetae..."" This indicates Nadal won the majority of points.
* The phrase ""Kei konei au e whai ana kia toa i tēnei"" (I am here aiming to win this) shows Nadal is confident about his victory.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates Nadal defeated Raonic."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tūnga o te whakataetae a Nadal rāua ko Raonic i muri i te tūnga tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: I riro a Nadal i ngā tohu 76**.

The passage states: ""Nō nā tata nei ia hinga ai ki a Raonic i te Brisbane Open. I riro i a Nadal ngā piro 88% i te whakataetae, ā, me te whiwhi i te 76 piro i te whiunga tuatahi."" This translates to ""He recently defeated Raonic at the Brisbane Open. Nadal won 88% of the points in the match and won 76 points on the first serve.""

Therefore, option B accurately reflects this information.
"
Ko tehea te hōtaka reo kāore i whakaurua ki ngā whakaaturanga hou e toru o Naked News?,"The correct answer is **C: Reo Hapanihi**.

The text states that Naked News has already released reports in English and Japanese, and is expanding to Spanish, Italian, and Korean for TV, online, and mobile. Therefore, Japanese is *already* available and not a new addition.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei whea te wāhi e wātea ai ngā whakaaturanga hou o Naked News?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā waea pūkoro (Mobile phones)**.

The text states: ""...kei te whakarewahia e ngā kaiwhakahaere o te ao whānui i ngā kaupapa reo Pāniora, Itāria me Korea hoki mō te pouaka whakaata, te ipurangi me ngā waea pūkoro.""  This translates to ""...the global executives are launching projects in Spanish, Italian and Korean for television, the internet and mobile phones.""



"
E hia ngā kaiwhakataetae kāore i oti i te Giant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **D: 45**.

The passage states: ""45 mai i te 117 kaieke retireti ki te Giant Slalom kāore i whiwhi piro ki te rēhi."" This translates to ""45 out of 117 retired athletes in the Giant Slalom did not win the race.""
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaatu tika ana i ngā hua o ngā whakataetae i ngā whakataetae?,"The best answer is **B: E 45 nga reti kāore i whakaoti i a rātau whakahaere i roto i te Giant Slalom.**

Here's why:

* **B is directly stated in the text:** The text explicitly says ""45 mai i te 117 kaieke retireti katoa ki te Giant Slalom kāore i whiwhi piro ki te rēhi."" (45 out of 117 retired athletes in the Giant Slalom did not finish the race.)

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **A: I te whakataetae tuarua, ka mutu a Carpenado i mua i te kaieke ski mai i Hungary:** While Carpenado *did* win, the text doesn't specifically mention the nationality of Claudia Loesch (the winner from Austria) or Gyongyi Dani (from Hungary). It only states they were the winners.
* **C: He nui ake ngā reti i oti i te Giant Slalom i te Slalom:** The text doesn't provide information comparing the number of retired athletes between the two races (Slalom vs. Giant Slalom).
* **D: I oti i a Carpenado te whakatekau i roto i te Slalom:** The text says Carpenado *won* the Slalom, not that she *finished* it. ""Oti"" can mean both finish and win. The text more directly states she won.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea i whakatauhia e te NBA kia whakamutua?,"The correct answer is **B: He kaitākaro no te Utah Jazz**.

Here's why:

The passage states the NBA postponed games due to a **COVID-19 outbreak** within the Utah Jazz.  This outbreak involved a **player** on the team. While the other options are related to COVID-19, the passage specifically links the postponement to a player being affected.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take i āwangawanga ai te NBA mō te huaketo?","The correct answer is **B: He maha ngā kaitākaro i whakamātautau tōtika i te kēmu Utah Jazz**.

The text states: ""Ko ngā whakatau a NBA i whai i te hopunga o tētahi nō Uta Jazz te huaketo COVID-19."" This means the NBA suspended games *because* the Utah Jazz had a COVID-19 outbreak.  Option B accurately reflects this reason: a large number of players on the Utah Jazz tested positive.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kua whakamātauria e ngā mema o te NBA he pai:** This is irrelevant to the reason for the suspension.
* **C: I muri i te whakamātautau i te pai, ka whakamōhiotia tētahi kaitākaro mō te Utah Jazz i muri i te whakamātautau i te pai:** This doesn't explain *why* the games were suspended; it talks about a possible consequence after testing.
* **D: I whakamātauria e tētahi kaitākaro mō te Utah Jazz he pai:**  This is too vague. It doesn't explain a widespread outbreak.



"
Ko wai i eke i te whāinga toa mō ngā Washington Capitals i te kēmu ki ngā Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Ko tāna āwhina tuarua o te pō ko tana tua 60 o te kaupeka, nā tēnā ko ia te kai tākaro tuatahi kia riro i a ia te 60 neke atu kōrā i roto i te kaupeka kotahi mai rānō i te tau 1995-96, **nā te tore-kai-huruhuru nā Nicklas Backstrom**."" This means Nicklas Backstrom assisted on the first goal.
"
Ko wai i eke i tana whāinga 60 o te wā i te wā o Capitals vs. Ko te kēmu o ngā Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**. 

The question states that Ovechkin achieved his 60th goal of the season in this game, making him the first player to do so since 1995-96, when Jagr and Lemieux did it.
"
Nō whea i hiahiatia ai e te pēke o Northern Rock te tautoko a te kāwanatanga?,"The correct answer is **A: I muri i te whakawāteatanga o te pēke.**

The text states: ""Kua hiahia āwhina a Northern Rock i te mea o tana tū marake i te wā o te mōrearea mōkete āpiti i te tau 2007."" (Northern Rock needed help due to its precarious position during the 2007 credit crunch.)  This directly links the need for government assistance to the bank's financial distress (the ""pēke"" or ""loan""). Options B, C, and D refer to events *after* the bank already needed help.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i ngā mahi a Virgin Group ki te pēke Northern Rock?","The correct answer is **B: I hokona e te rōpū Virgin Group te pēke i muri i tōna whakaraunga.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""I whakaparahakongia tētahi tono mō te pēke a te Virgin Group a Sir Richard Branson i mua i te whakawhānuitanga ki te motu o taua pēke. I te tau 2010, ahakoa kua huri ki raro i te mana kāwanatanga, i whakawehea te pēke huarahi matua o nāianei a Northern Rock plc i te """"pēke kino"""", a Northern Rock (Asset Management). **Kua hokona e Virgin te """"pēke pai"""" o Northern rock, kaua ko te kamupene whakahaere rawa.**""

This clearly indicates Virgin Group bought the ""good"" debt (Asset Management) *after* Northern Rock was taken into government control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I hokona hoki e Virgin Group te kamupene whakahaere rawa o Northern Rock** - The passage specifically says Virgin *didn't* buy the Asset Management company (the ""bad"" debt).
* **C: I whakawhiwhia e Virgin Group te tautoko ohorere ki te pēke i te wā o te raru nama** - The passage mentions Virgin made a *request* for debt, not receiving support.
* **D: Ko te tono tuatahi a Virgin Group mō te pēke i mahia i muri i te whakakotahitanga o te pēke** -  The passage says the request was made *before* the government takeover and the division of assets.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga, he aha te iwi e pāngia ana e te hainatanga o te kirimana āhuarangi o Kyoto?","The correct answer is **A: United States**.

The first sentence of the passage states that ""Kei te whakamohoaoao te whakatau a Matua Rudd ki te haina i te haina i te Kyoto climate accord i Ngā Whenua Tōpū o Amerika..."" which directly indicates that the United States is being negatively impacted by the US withdrawal from the Kyoto accord.
"
I whakaaro te kāwanatanga o Australia o mua ka kino te whakaaetanga o Kyoto ki te aha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā kawenga ake waro (Domestic competitiveness)**.

Here's why:

The question states that the former Australian government believed Kyoto would harm the economy and its ""domestic competitiveness"" (ngā kawenga ake waro).  The passage mentions the concern that Kyoto would damage the economy and its ability to export coal.  Option C directly reflects this concern about economic impact.
"
He aha te hōtaka i whakawhiwhia ai ngā kaiwhakatū i te ara?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te hōtaka hopu a te Association of Sporting Shooters.**

The text explicitly states: ""Ki tētahi kōtuitanga o NPWS me te **Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc**, i kimihia he kaimahi tūao māraurau, ki raro i te **hōtaka aruaru o te Sporting Shooters Association**.""

This indicates that the Shooting Shooters Association's hunting program was the basis for the employment and training.
"
Ko tēhea kōrero e kore e tika te whakaatu i te whakamātautau whakahaere kino?,"The correct answer is **A: Pērā ki te whakamātautau tuatahi o te papatono, kāore i arotakea.**

Here's why:

The question asks which statement *doesn't* describe a proper management review of shooting range targets. A good management review includes:

*   **Testing the targets:** The question states this was done.
*   **Reviewing the testing:** This is implied by the statement about the agreement between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association.
*   **Assessing the results:** This is also implied.

Option A, ""Pērā ki te whakamātautau tuatahi o te papatono, kāore i arotakea"" (Like the initial range test, it was not reviewed), directly contradicts the concept of a management review. A review *is* the process of analyzing and evaluating the results of a test.

Let's look at why the other options are likely part of a proper management review:

*   **B: I whiwhi tohutohu whakangungu ngā tākaro** (The shooters received training guidance) - Training guidance is important for safety and proper use.
*   **C: I whakahaeretia nga pūtiro e nga kaitiaki** (The targets were operated by guardians) -  This suggests proper supervision and control.
*   **D: E whā ngā pūtiro i tīpakohia** (Four targets were fired) - This is a factual detail about the testing and is relevant information.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i kitea te wahi?","The correct answer is **C: I roto i ngā whakaaturanga rāpoi ngota**.

The text states: ""I te kitenga rāpoi ngota."" which translates to ""During the discovery of the rift."" This directly indicates that the location was found during the rift discovery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te Awaawa o Rift (In the Rift Valley)** - While the Rift Valley is *where* it was found, the text specifies the discovery happened *during* the rift discovery.
* **B: I runga i te anga (On the cliff)** - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: I Etiopia (In Ethiopia)** - Ethiopia is the *country* where the Rift Valley is located, but the text doesn't specify the discovery was *in* Ethiopia, only *during* the discovery of the rift.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea i tupu wawe ake i te mea i whakaarohia?","The correct answer is **A: Te kitenga o te fossil (The finding of the fossil)**.

The passage states: ""I te mea o te mātātoka nei e mōhio ai i moata ke noa ake o te wehenga nui, tēnā i tā rātou i whakatau ai mā te kitenga rāpoi ngota."" This translates to: ""Because of the fossil that knows more about the greater separation, then they decided upon the discovery of the fossil.""

Therefore, the discovery of the fossil is what happened in response to the understanding of the greater separation.
"
He aha te mea e hiahiatia ana e te kaitākaro kia taea ai e ia te whakahaere i ngā nekehanga i te wā o te kēmu ataata?,"The correct answer is **B: Triangulate to rātau tūnga**.

Here's why:

The passage states the system uses two sensors near the controller to ""triangulate"" the player's position in 3D space. This triangulation allows the player to control their in-game actions by physically moving the controller.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tirohia mēnā kei te whakaturia ngā pūoko o te kaiwhakahaere i te taha o te papatohu** (Check if the controller's sensors are aligned with the horizontal plane) - While sensor alignment is important, it doesn't describe the core process of controlling movement.
*   **C: Purua ngā pūoko ki te taha o tō rātou pouaka whakaata** (Push the sensors towards their console) - This is not how the system works.
*   **D: Nekehia te pūmana mā te hau** (Move the pointer with the air) - The system doesn't use air movement to control the pointer.

Therefore, **triangulating the player's position** is the fundamental action required to enable movement in the game."
He aha te mea i hangaia kia rite ki te taura pouaka whakaata?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā pūoko e rua o te pūmana (Two sensors)**.

The text explicitly states: ""e whakamahi ana te kaiwhakahaere i ngā paerongo e rua e whakatakotoria ana tata ki te pouaka whakaata a te kaimahi..."" which translates to ""the manager uses two sensors that are placed near the player's console...""

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
He aha te mea kihai i whakaaturia i roto i te pūrongo hou a te tari rongo o Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **A: I whiwhi te waka rererangi i tētahi tuma pōma**.

The question asks what the *new* report from Xinhua's news agency mentioned. The passage states that the new reports indicated a ""whakatuma poma"" (a piece of debris/a bomb) hit the aircraft. Therefore, the new report mentioned the debris impact. While other events are mentioned in the passage (like going to Afghanistan and Kandahar), the *new* report specifically highlighted the debris.
"
He aha kāore i kōrerotia i roto i te pūrongo tuatahi o te kōwhiringa hou o Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **B: I whakakorea te waka rererangi i tētahi tauranga ohorere**.

Here's why:

The first report states that a cargo plane *from* Hainan Airlines was purchased by Xinhua, and later reports mentioned a bomb being found on the plane and it being diverted to Auckland, then ending up in Kandahar.  It also mentions the plane flying to Afghanistan after not being allowed to stay longer in Urumqi.

The first report **doesn't mention** the plane being quarantined at any airport. Options A and C are mentioned in later reports, and option D is also mentioned in later reports.

Therefore, the correct answer is B.
"
He aha te mea i panuitia e Sara Danius i te hōtaka reo irirangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te toa o te Tohu Nobel i roto i te Pukapuka**.

The passage states that Sara Danius announced the committee's decision regarding Bob Dylan's 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature on the radio program. The core of her announcement was about the Nobel Prize.
"
Ko wai kāore i taea te tae atu?,"The correct answer is **D: Bob Dylan**.

The text states that the Swedish Academy couldn't reach out to Bob Dylan directly, but they changed their approach to reach out to his close associate. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kaiwehe tata a Bob Dylan** - The text mentions reaching out to Bob Dylan's close associate.
*   **B: Sara Danius** - Sara Danius *was* the secretary of the Nobel Committee for Literature and made the radio announcement.
*   **C: Te Wāhanga o Huitene** - ""Te Wāhanga o Huitene"" refers to the committee, and they are the ones who couldn't reach out to Dylan directly.



"
"""Ko wai i kōrero mo te taunaha he """"hipanga nui""""?""","The correct answer is **C: Kōnata Johndroe**.

The provided text states: ""Mō te āhua ki a Korea ki te Raki, ka kī ake te māngai a Bush, ko Gordon Johndroe, """"he āhuatanga nui tēnei ki te whakatutuki i te whakatūturutanga o te pāpurupuru-kore ki runga o te kūrae o Korea."""" "" This translates to: ""Regarding the situation with North Korea, Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndroe, said, """"this is a major development in achieving the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula."""" ""

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who used the phrase ""a major development.""
"
E hia ngā tīkitipati i hangaia e Słania mō ngā whenua rerekē?,"The correct answer is **D: Neke atu i te 1,000**.

The text states: ""1,000 ngā pane kuini i hangaia mō Sweeden me ētahi atu whenua e 28 te nui.""  This translates to ""1,000 queen stamps were created for Sweden and 28 other countries.""

Therefore, the answer must be ""Neke atu i te 1,000"" (More than 1,000).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te māturu haere tonu i nga haora o te kura?","The correct answer is **B: He whakamātautau auau o te pūnaha whakahau ahi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nā te ngoikore o te hiko whai muri i te whakamātau i te pūnaha-ā-ahi..."" (Due to the power outage after testing the fire suppression system...). This directly links the ongoing pumping to a test of the fire suppression system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kei te whakakiia te wāhi ārai tuarua ki te kaha** (The second containment area is being filled to capacity) - While this is happening, it's not the *reason* for the continued pumping.
* **C: Whakanui wera** (Overheating) - The passage doesn't mention overheating as a cause.
* **D: He ahi i tētahi o ngā pou mapu o Pā Greely** (A fire in one of the Fort Greely radar towers) - The passage states the fire was *caused by* the test of the fire suppression system, not that there was a fire in a radar tower.



"
He aha i tuwhera ai nga whatanga āwhina?,"The correct answer is **B: I puta he mate hiko i muri i te whakamātautau pūnaha.**

The provided text states: ""Nā te ngoikore o te hiko whai muri i te whakamātau i te pūnaha-ā-ahi, ka huaki ake ngā pēhanga āwhina..."" which translates to ""Due to a power failure after the system test, the support structures rose..."". This directly explains why the containment walls were breached.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tērā te whakawhānuitanga wera i roto i nga reheke** - While thermal expansion *can* cause issues, the text explicitly states a *power failure* was the initial trigger.
*   **C: I tino kaha nga reheke** - The text doesn't indicate the walls were exceptionally strong and failed due to overstress.
*   **D: Kāore i taea e te wāhi ārai tuarua te pupuri i ngā pere e ranea ana** - This is a consequence of the breach, not the cause. The breach *allowed* the second containment area to be overwhelmed.

"
"I tēnei wā, he pēhea te teitei o te wai i te Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: He hope-teitei**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""The Ninth Ward, which was flooded to heights of up to 20 feet during Hurricane Katrina, is now sitting below the water level of the recent storm's surge, which is a **foot-high**."" This means the water is a foot high, which is a ""hope-teitei"" (literally, ""hope-height"" but meaning a small height, like a foot).
* Option A (20 feet) refers to the height during Hurricane Katrina, not the current surge.
* Option B (6 inches) refers to the planned surge height, not the current height in the Ninth Ward.
* Option D (100 feet) is incorrect and not mentioned in the passage.



"
"I te wā o te Hurricane Katrina, he aha te mea i puta i te Ninth Ward?","The correct answer is **B: Na te wai tiketike i huri te levee.**

Here's why:

* The question asks what happened in the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.
* The provided text states the Ninth Ward was flooded to a height of *up to 20 feet* due to the levee failure during Hurricane Katrina.
* Option B directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E 100 waewae te whānui o nga wai waipuke** - This describes the width of the flooding, not what caused the flooding.
* **C: E 20 waewae te teitei o nga wai waipuke** - While the text mentions a height of 20 feet, this doesn't explain *what* happened.
* **D: 6 inihi o te ua i takahi i te awa pakaru** - The text says the 6 inches of rain *caused* the levee to fail, leading to the flooding, but it doesn't describe the flooding itself.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i whakaūngia e Hamilton?,"The correct answer is **B: Te āheinga ki te kānataraki a ētahi atu tūroro i te huaketo (The implication of other doctors being quarantined).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Hamilton *did* implement protocols for newborn screening and the quarantine of others to prevent further spread.  It also explicitly mentions the hospital's role in the development of the screening method and the screening's application in Nigeria during the Ebola outbreak.
* **The passage *doesn't* mention:** Any implication or action taken regarding quarantining *other doctors*. 

Therefore, option B is the one *not* addressed in the provided text.
"
He aha tētahi mea e hiahia ana ngā kaipūtaiao ki te whakaaro?,"The correct answer is **A: No te tūtukitanga o nga kameke ki te Whenua** (About the connection of the atoms to the Earth).

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that scientists dream of creating elements, just as Papatūānuku (Earth) existed before the elements were formed. This implies a focus on how these elements *connect* to and interact with the Earth.  The whole point is how these elements *relate* to our planet.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: He pēhea te hanga pūmua** (How to build the elements): While element creation is mentioned, it's not the primary focus of the scientists' dream. The emphasis is on the *existence* and relationship of elements to Earth.
* **C: He aha te take waro** (What is the black hole reason):  This is completely unrelated to the passage's focus on elements and Earth.
* **D: He pēhea te hanganga o te Ao** (How the universe was created):  The passage specifically focuses on elements and their relationship to Earth, not the overall creation of the universe.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tūranga i tākaro ai nga pirihimana paetata i te katinga?","The correct answer is **C: I whakahaua e rātau nga kaieke motokā ki ētahi atu ararere** (They directed motorists to alternative routes).

The passage states: ""...the assistance of 80 security personnel to reroute vehicles off the beltway."" This means they guided drivers to different routes, preventing them from proceeding on the main highway. Options A, B, and D are not supported by the text.
"
He aha i pā ki nga tomokanga ngongo i te wā o te katinga?,"The correct answer is **A: I aukatihia rātau (They were blocked)**.

The text states: ""I whakamahia ngā taraka parahanga hei aukati i ngā tomokanga pū..."" which translates to ""Barriers were used to block the toll booths...""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea kihai i puta i mua i te tukinga o te kaituhi e te waka?","The correct answer is **A: I whakahaua te kaiwhakaahua e te Huarahi Patrol kia hoki whakamuri i te huarahi.**

The text explicitly states: ""Heita'a te pirihimana California Highway Patrol e whakahaere ana i te tūnga waka ki te tohu i a ia kia hoki atu, kia rua ngā wā."" (The California Highway Patrol police arranged the car's parking to signal him to return, twice.) This happened *before* the photographer left the scene.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I whakatūria e te kaiwhakaahua tana waka i te taha o Sepulveda Boulevard:** While true, this describes the photographer's initial action, not what happened *before* they left.
* **C: I mauria e te kaiwhakaahua he pikitia mo te tūnga pirihimana:** The text mentions the photographer tried to get pictures of the ""whāhi tūnga pirihimana"" (security parking area), but it doesn't say they *took* a picture.
* **D: I taea e te kaiwhakaahua te tiki pikitia o Bieber:** The text says the photographer was trying to get pictures of Bieber, but doesn't confirm whether they succeeded."
He aha te kaiwhakaahua e ngana ana ki te mahi i mua i tana pānga ki te waka?,"The correct answer is **B: Tangohia ngā whakaahua o te tūnga pirihimana**.

The text states: ""TMZ's paparazzi staked out the photographer's car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and tried to snap pictures of the secure parking area before changing lanes and continuing to chase, at which point California Highway Patrol officers staged the car to signal him to pull over, twice. According to the officers, the photographer did not comply with the photographer's demands.""

This directly supports the idea that the photographer was trying to take pictures of the secure parking area.
"
Ko tēhea kōrero kāore e whakaahua tika ana i te āhua o te perehitini i muri i te whakamātautau i te pai mō te huaketo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kai roto a ia i te āhua pūmau**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""E ū ana te āhuatanga o te perehitene..."" which translates to ""He has the symptoms of the flu...""  This indicates he's *experiencing* flu symptoms, not that he *is* permanently ill.
* Options A, B, and D are all directly mentioned in the text: ""Hāunga te kirkā me te korokoro mamae..."" (He has a cough and a sore throat...)
* Option C, ""Kai roto a ia i te āhua pūmau"" (He is in a permanent condition) is **contradicted** by the text, which says he will be staying home for a few days but intends to return to work.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei mo te perehitini e pono ana?","The correct answer is **B: Ka noho a ia ki te kāinga mo nga rā.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""E ū ana te āhuatanga o te perehitene, ahakoa ka noho mohoao ia ki te kāinga mō ētahi rā."" (He is experiencing symptoms of the flu, although he will stay home for a few days.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kāore i a ia te kirikā** (He doesn't have a cough): The text says ""Hāunga te kirkā..."" (He has a cough...).
* **C: Kai te tino pai a ia ki te pūkoro** (He's very good at typing): The text mentions he's still able to work via phone calls.
* **D: He tino nui tōna take o te huaketo** (His flu is very serious): While he has flu symptoms, the text doesn't describe them as *very* serious, just enough to warrant staying home for a few days.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i te wā e tūmanako ana kia ngoikore tonu te Huripari o te Huripari o Gonu?","The correct answer is **D: I mua i te taenga atu ki te hau e 149 maire ia ora.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""I tana tihi, i tae te haumātakataka pārū Gonu, (kua ingoatia mō ngā rau niu i te reo o te Maldives) ki ngā hau tūpuhi o te 240 kiromita ia hāora (149 mairo ia hāora). Tae mai ki te ata moata i tēnei rā, tata ki te 83 km/h ngā hau, ā, ko te matapae ka ngoikore haere tonu.""

This translates to: ""In its intensity, the Gonu cyclone (named for the coconut palm in the Maldivian language) reached sustained winds of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour). This morning, the winds were around 83 km/h, and the eye continued to remain open.""

The question asks when the Gonu cyclone was expected to remain unbroken (i.e., the eye would stay open). The text indicates this was *before* the winds reached 149 miles per hour. Therefore, the answer is D.
"
Pēhea te tere o nga hau i te taumata o te Huripari O te Huripari o Gonu?,"The correct answer is **C: 149 maire ia haora**.

The question states: ""I tana tihi, i tae te haumātakataka pārū Gonu, (kua ingoatia mō ngā rau niu i te reo o te Maldives) ki ngā hau tūpuhi o te 240 kiromita ia hāora (149 mairo ia hāora)."" This translates to: ""At its peak, the Gonu cyclone (named for the coconut palms in the Maldivian language) reached wind speeds of 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).""

The question then asks about the wind speed *at the peak* of the Gonu cyclone. The answer provided in the text is 149 kilometers per hour.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i whakaarotia he āhuatanga o te tuakana o Karenia?,"The correct answer is **C: He pūtau-maha (A multi-cellular organism)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""arā ko tētahi koiora pūtau-kotahi māori"" which translates to ""it is a single-celled marine organism"".
* **The other options are mentioned or implied:**
    * **A: He momo kapoke (A type of bloom):** The text describes a harmful algal bloom.
    * **B: Ka taea te mono i ngā io o te tangata (Can sting human skin):** The text says the bloom produces toxins that can harm humans.
    * **D: He māori noa iho (Just a simple organism):** While single-celled, the bloom is described as harmful and capable of producing toxins, making it more than ""simple.""

Therefore, the statement that it is a multi-cellular organism directly contradicts the information given in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e taea e Karena brevis te mahi?,"The correct answer is **A: Monokia ngā io ki te ika (Release ions to fish)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Karenia brevis produces a toxin that can kill fish. The other options describe things the algae *does* do, or things that are consequences of its actions:
    * **B: Kia tere te whakanui i te tau i raro i ngā āhuatanga katoa (Increase growth rate under all conditions):**  The text implies the algae thrives under certain conditions, leading to increased growth.
    * **C: Pā ki te wai (Accumulate in water):** The text mentions the algae accumulates to form blooms.
    * **D: Hanga i tētahi neurotoxin (Produce a neurotoxin):**  This is explicitly stated as what the algae does.
* **A: Monokia ngā io ki te ika (Release ions to fish)** doesn't directly relate to the information provided. The toxin isn't described as being released as ions. The problem is that the toxin *kills* fish, but the statement about releasing ions is not mentioned. 

Therefore, the algae's action of releasing ions to fish is the one that isn't described or confirmed by the text.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i puta nā te Āwhā o Felicia?","The correct answer is **D: waipuke tiriti (moderate flooding)**.

The text states: ""he ahakoa kāore anō te kino me te waipuke kia rīpoatangia"" which translates to ""although the damage and flooding were not yet reported."" This means the flooding wasn't significant enough to be reported, implying it wasn't moderate. The text does mention rain and lightning.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero mo te Āwhā o Felicia e hē ana?,"The correct answer is **B: I te tuatahi i whakarōpūtia hei pāngarau pāngarau i mua i te huri hei ngaru kāwai 4.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""I ngoikore haere a Felicia, i tētahi wā he āwhā Category 4 ki te Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale..."". This indicates that Felicia *was initially* a Category 4 hurricane.
* Option B accurately reflects this initial categorization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko te hua o te marangai i whai painga ai a Oahu** - While the passage mentions Oahu receiving rainfall, it doesn't say that's the *result* of the hurricane. It just states the rainfall amount.
* **C: Ko te nuinga o nga moutere i kite i te whakawhānuitanga** - The passage says it affected most islands, but doesn't specifically mention a ""whakawhānuitanga"" (expansion/spread) as a key feature.
* **D: I haere tahi ētahi marangai i te uira** - The passage mentions rainfall and lightning, but doesn't say the hurricane went *alongside* them.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e tino whakaatu ana i te putanga o te 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix?,"The correct answer is **C: I pūhia a Piquet Jr. i muri iho**.

Here's why:

The question describes the events leading to Nelson Piquet Jr.'s deliberate crash at the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, and the subsequent investigation and fallout. The question then asks what story best illustrates the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.  Piquet Jr. was fired by Renault after the Singapore incident, and the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix was the race where he was effectively sidelined, indicating his career was ending. This termination and the resulting fallout are the key story of that race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I uru a Fernando Alonso ki tētahi aitua:** While Fernando Alonso was heavily involved in the 2008 Singapore incident, he didn't have a significant story in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix related to Piquet Jr.'s situation.
* **B: I tangohia e Piquet Jr. te wikitōria:** Piquet Jr. *didn't* win the race in Hungary in 2009. He wasn't even competing at that point.
* **D: I aituā te motokā haumaru:**  The safety car wasn't a significant factor in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix in relation to Piquet Jr.'s situation.



"
I te wā i puta ai te hinganga?,"The correct answer is **A: Whai muri tonu i te whakamutu o Alonso**.

The prompt states that Piquet Jr. crashed *after* Alonso had already started to pit under the safety car. This is explicitly mentioned in the text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i iti iho te wā i whakapono tuatahitia e nga kaipūkaro?","The correct answer is **B: Pūrongo mō te momo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i runga i te whakatipu i waenganui i tētahi Darwin finch taketake, a Geospiza fortes, me te cactus finch tauhou, a Geospiza conirostris. **i te puka pūtaiao**...""

This indicates that the *publication of the report* (pūrongo) in the scientific journal is the event that happened two years after the initial observations, and the one that researchers initially questioned (whakaponotia) as being longer than it actually was. Therefore, the report is the one that was initially doubted.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuatia e ngā kairangahau?,"The correct answer is **A: Te wāhi i hangaia ai te momo hōu (The location where the new species was formed)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage *does* mention:**
    * **C: Te ingoa o te momo hou (The name of the new species):** It states the new species is a ""cactus finch tauhou, a Geospiza conirostris.""
    * **B: Te roanga o te tukanga kunenga (The duration of the evolutionary process):**  It mentions the evolutionary period is two years, although the actual development may have been longer.
    * **D: Nga manu i roto i te tāuri (The birds in the cage):** The passage refers to the comparison between the new finch and a Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*. This implies observing birds, though not explicitly stating they were in a cage.

* **The passage *doesn't* mention:**
    * **A: Te wāhi i hangaia ai te momo hōu (The location where the new species was formed):** The passage focuses on the evolutionary relationships between the finches, not the specific geographic location where the *new* species evolved.



Therefore, the location of the new species' formation is the information missing from the passage.



"
Kei whea te CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: I te taone o Bucharest**.

The passage states: ""Ko te tāone te tuatahi tēnei o Europi ki te tongarawhiti hei whakahaere i te CowParade..."" This directly indicates the CowParade is being held in Bucharest.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakaahua tika ana i a CowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te takahanga toi tūmatanui nui rawa tēnei i te ao.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te tāone te tuatahi tēnei o Europi ki te tongarawhiti hei whakahaere i te CowParade, me te pūreitanga toi tūmatawhānui nui rawa o te ao..."" (The city is the first in Northwestern Europe to host CowParade, and the largest international art exhibition in the world...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka tū anake i roto i ngā tāone e whakaarotia ana he “whakaaro”** - The passage doesn't mention anything about cities being considered ""thoughtful"" for CowParade.
* **B: I hangaia e Bucharest City Hall** - While Bucharest City Hall is hosting it, the passage focuses on the *nature* of the event, not its origin.
* **C: He kaupapa toi e tū ana i te raumati puta noa i te tonga-rawhiti o Ūropi** - The passage specifies the event is in Northwestern Europe, *not* across the region.



"
He aha te take i whakamutua ai e Rūhia te whakamahi II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: He aituā (A ghost)**.

The passage states: ""He wāhanga nui rawa te II-76 o te ope hōia a Rūhia, a Soviet hoki mai i te tekau tau 1970, ā, kua kitea kētia tētahi aituā nui whakaharahara ki Rūhia i tērā marama."" This translates to: ""The II-76 is a significant part of the Russian army, a Soviet one from the 1970s, and a powerful ghost has been discovered to haunt Russia this month."" 

The passage then goes on to describe incidents involving the II-76s after a particular incident on October 7th, implying the ghost is the reason for their withdrawal from service.  The other options are incorrect.
"
He aha te II-76?,"The correct answer is **C: He rererangi (An airplane)**.

The text explicitly states: ""He wāhanga nui rawa te II-76 o te ope hōia a Rūhia...Kua kitea kētia tētahi aituā nui whakaharahara ki Rūhia i tērā marama. I te rā 7 o Oketopa i wehea tētahi initia i te hārewa, karekau ngā whara. I whakatau taupua a Rūhia i ngā II-76 i muri i taua tukituki."" This indicates the II-76 is a type of aircraft used by the Russian military.
"
Na wai i utu i te kapa kaituhi mo te The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: Simon**.

The passage states: ""I te tau 1989 nāna i āwhina ki te hanga i The Simpsons ki a Brooks rāua ko Groening, ā, i haepapa ia mō te whakarite i te rōpū tuhi tuatahi o te whakaaturanga."" This indicates Simon was responsible for organizing the writing team, implying he was the one who oversaw and likely managed the payment to the writers. While Brooks and Groening were involved in the creation, the passage specifically links Simon to organizing the writing team.
"
"E ai ki a Fluke, ko wai i tuku kōrero pai me te whakatenatena ki a ia?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā tāne me te wahine (Men and women)**.

The prompt states that the advice came from both men and women through media reports. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that it came from both.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ētahi tāngata kāore i te hiahia kia kōrero nga wāhine?","The correct answer is **A: Tāne**.

The text states the flute is a warning about some people wanting to control women based on discussions about women's health.  It mentions ""wāhine mai, tāne hoki"" (women and men), implying that men are among those attempting to control women's bodies. Therefore, the answer is tāne (men).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tinana aorangi te tino pūkaha?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage states: ""Ki tātou mōhio, kotahi anake te aorangi he nui ake ngā uekaha i a Titan..."" which translates to ""As we know, only one of the heavens has more moons than Titan..."" This indicates that Titan is the celestial body with the most moons mentioned in the context.
"
Kua kitea ngā awa me ngā roto i runga i te wai mārama i runga i tēhea ao?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions Titan as having a large atmosphere with ""uekaha i a Titan"" (features like those of Titan).
* The passage says ""Ki tātou mōhio, kotahi anake te aorangi he nui ake ngā uekaha i a Titan, ko Papatūānuku tōna ingoa"" which translates to ""As we know, only one celestial body has features greater than Titan, and that is Papatūānuku (Earth)."" This implies that Titan has features similar to those seen in water on Earth.
* The statement ""Ka pērā i te wai te whanonga"" which translates to ""The behavior is like water"" is a key indicator that the passage is referring to Titan, where liquid methane and ethane exist.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jupiter** is a gas giant with no surface liquid bodies visible in the same way as Earth or Titan.
* **C: Te rā (The Sun)** is a star and doesn't have water or surface features in the same sense.
* **D: Saturn** has rings and moons, but the passage specifically links the ""behavior"" to water-like properties, pointing to Titan.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei kitenga ehara i te hua o te kitenga o te huruhuru?,"The correct answer is **A: Te tae paramu o te kararehe (The plumage color of the bird)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the *structure* and *function* of the feathers – their rachis, barbules, and lack of role in flight (primarily for insulation, display, etc.). It specifically states that the plumage color isn't a result of these structural findings.

Let's look at why the other options *are* results of the feather findings:

* **B: He māramatanga kāore i whakamahia ngā huruhuru i te rerenga (An understanding that feathers are not used for flight):**  The entire passage revolves around the conclusion that feathers aren't primarily for flight, based on their structure.
* **C: He tirohanga ki te kunenga o te huruhuru (An insight into the structure of the feather):** The passage details the structure – rachis, barbules, etc. – directly.
* **D: E whakapumautia ana he huruhuru te nuinga o nga taikaha (It is asserted that most dinosaurs had feathers):** The passage mentions finding feathers on ancient dinosaurs, indicating the feather findings contribute to this assertion.



Therefore, the plumage color is the outlier as it's not directly linked to the structural insights provided in the passage.



"
He aha nga huruhuru dinosaur kāore i a ia?,"The correct answer is **A: Barbules**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ko ngā niwha me ngā **barbules** - e kī ana ngā kairangahau kāore e kore ko te rachis tētahi mea i kukuwha ake i muri ake i ēnei atu āhuatanga."" This directly indicates that barbules are *not* found on dinosaur feathers, according to the scientists' findings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: He rachis:** The passage says scientists believe the feather shafts (rachis) didn't develop properly, but *some* shaft structure was present.
*   **C: Paramu pakeke:** The passage mentions that older feathers are found in the fossil record, not just juvenile ones.
*   **D: He pale tae ki raro:** This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki ZMapp ehara i te mea pono?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka āhei te rongoā i ngā mate o mua engari kāore e ārai i te mate.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ki te whakamātau PALM, ko Zmapp hei pae, arā ka whakamahia e ngā kaipūtaiao hei pūtake, ā, ka whakatairitea ngā maimoatanga hou e toru i tērā."" This means ZMapp is being used as a *control* or benchmark in the PALM trial, *not* as a treatment that cures the disease.
* **The text also mentions:** ""...heoi nā ngā rangahau ōkawa i whakaatu he iti ake ngā painga i tērā i pīrangitia mō te haukoti i te mate."" This directly contradicts the idea that ZMapp cures the disease.
* **The other options are accurate according to the text:**
    * **A: He mea hanga mai i nga paturopi:** The text explicitly states ZMapp is a monoclonal antibody.
    * **C: I whakamahia hei mana i roto i te whakamātautau PALM:** The text clearly says ZMapp is used as a control in the PALM trial.
    * **D: E whakaatu ana ngā rangahau he iti iho te painga o te reira i te mea i whakaarohia i te tuatahi:** The text states that later research showed ZMapp's benefits were less than initially hoped.



Therefore, option B is the only inaccurate statement.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te whakamātautau PALM?,"The correct answer is **C: I whakamahia a ZMapp hei pūtake o te whakamātautau.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ki te whakamātau PALM, ko Zmapp hei pae, arā ka whakamahia e ngā kaipūtaiao hei pūtake, ā, ka whakatairitea ngā maimoatanga hou e toru i tērā.""  This directly translates to ""In the PALM trial, Zmapp is the baseline, meaning that scientists will use it as a standard, and three new treatments will be tested against it.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I whakaaturia e ngā rangahau he nui ake pea ngā painga i te mea i whakaarohia i mua:** While the passage mentions initial promising results with ZMapp, it also states that later research showed less benefit than initially hoped. The statement about increased benefits is not directly supported by the text.
* **B: I whakaritea tētahi rongoā whakahaere ki ētahi atu maimoatanga e toru, ko tētahi o ēnei ko te ZMapp:**  While technically true, it's less specific and important than the fact that ZMapp served as the *baseline* for comparison.
* **D: I whakaaturia he whai hua ki te whakaora i ngā mate o mua:** The passage focuses on potential *future* treatments (the three new ones) being compared to ZMapp. It doesn't say ZMapp was effective in treating past cases.

E whakaaro ana ngā kairangahau ko whea te wahi ka tino nui te maramara hou?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā whenua whai taonga (Developing countries)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the tool is designed to be affordable and easy to produce using inkjet printers, making it suitable for resource-limited settings.
* It mentions specific examples like malaria, tuberculosis, HIV, and other diseases prevalent in island nations with limited resources.
* The passage highlights the potential for rapid diagnosis in areas where access to medical facilities is scarce.

Therefore, the focus of the new technology's impact is intended for developing countries.
"
He aha te tikanga ka whakamahia hei hanga i te taputapu tātaritanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Kotahi U.S. hēneti ia** (One U.S. sheet).

The passage explicitly states: ""mō te 1 hēneti U.S pea, he rehu-mihini tā iti nei e taea ana te hanga mā ngā mihini tā inkjet noa.""  This translates to ""for just one U.S. sheet, a small printer can be made with inkjet printers.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ehara i te tika te kōrero mo nga riwha?","The correct answer is **B: Ko tō rātou aroaro e tohu ana kāore te marama e ngaro i te mahi ā-whenua.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kua kitea ēnei māheni i te marama, ā, e kitea ana kua raupā haere, ko tēnei e tohu mai ana ko ngā mahi ā-taiao te take. Ko tēnei ariā e taupatupatu ana ki te kereme mō te marama ehara he mahi geologic.""

Translation: ""These features have been seen on the Moon, and it has been seen that they have eroded, this indicates that natural processes are the cause. This area is consistent with the theory for the Moon's regolith, which is not a geological process.""

This means the eroding features are *not* geological in origin but are a result of ongoing natural processes. Option B directly reflects this: ""Their appearance indicates that the Moon is not losing its natural processes.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko ngā mea i hanga i a rātau i tupu tata nei:** (The things they built happened recently) - The passage isn't about anything being built.
*   **C: Tērā pea he hua nō te heke iho o te marama:** (Perhaps it's a result of the Moon's own decline) - The passage refutes this idea, stating it's *not* a geological process.
*   **D: Kāore he tokomaha i kitea i runga i te mata o te marama:** (Not many have been seen on the Moon's surface) - The passage states they *have* been seen.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te ariā e pā ana ki ngā āhua o te whenua e tohu ana he mahi whenua kei te puta i runga i te marama?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te heke haere te marama (The moon is changing)**.

The passage states that the lobate scarps (the landforms) are shrinking, and this is evidence of ongoing *environmental processes*. This implies the moon is *changing*, not that the landforms were built long ago or are very recent. The passage explicitly contrasts this with a geological explanation.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e kore e nui ake tae noa ki te whakapae?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā tānga whakaahua (Image restrictions)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kei te whakamahia whānuitia tēnei ki wāhi kē atu ki Peretānia engari ka rerekē te haere o te matatika ki Kōtarani, ā, ki ngā kōti he mea whakakotiti tika pea te whakaputanga whakaahua."" This translates to: ""This is widely used in other parts of Britain, but the course of the law will be different in Scotland, and image restrictions may be directly challenged in court.""

Therefore, image restrictions are the element mentioned as potentially hindering the prosecution.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te raruraru o nāianei mō ngā hiri?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā āhuatanga o te huarere tino nui** (The severity of the atmospheric conditions).

The passage states: ""Hei tāpiritanga ki te tio kino, kua whakararu ngā āhuatanga huarere kino i ngā mahi whakarauora."" (In addition to the bad weather, bad atmospheric conditions have disrupted health operations.) and later ""Ko te rahi me te mātotoru o te tio ū, e ai ki a Pittman, ko te kino rawa kua kitea e ngā kaiaruaru kēkeno i ngā tau 15 kua pahure ake."" (According to Pittman, the size and severity of the ice have been observed by experts in the last 15 years.)

While ice size and severity are mentioned, the *primary* problem hindering health operations, according to this excerpt, is the overall severity of the bad atmospheric conditions.



"
"I tua atu i te hukapapa, he aha anō te mea e pā ana ki ngā mahi whakaora?","The correct answer is **C: Kāore he āwhina (No assistance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the bad weather has worsened conditions for recovery. It also mentions that the severity and duration of the bad weather are worse than in the previous 15 years, and that the situation hasn't improved in a week.  The question asks for *additional* information about recovery. The passage doesn't provide any solutions or assistance being offered, only describing the negative impact of the weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kāore he rawa (No solution)** - While the situation is dire, the passage doesn't explicitly state *no* solutions exist.
* **B: Ngā here rangi (Weather patterns)** - The passage *does* discuss weather patterns (bad weather and its severity). The question asks for *additional* information *about recovery*.
* **D: Nga hiri (Improvements)** - The passage explicitly states there haven't been any improvements.

Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the information in the passage is that there's no assistance being mentioned regarding the recovery efforts.



"
He aha te whakapono i kore ai a Roberts e whakamana?,"The correct answer is **C: Te tīmatanga o te ora**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakapeka a Roberts ki te whakaputa i ōna whakaaro mō te wā ka tīmata ai te oranga..."" This directly indicates that Roberts is hesitant or unwilling to define when life begins. The passage then goes on to mention his adherence to *Roe v. Wade*, which established the right to abortion based on the viability of the fetus – essentially, the potential for life outside the womb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te tika o te kōrerorero i ngā kēhi:** The passage explicitly states that Roberts believes it is *not* appropriate to discuss the characteristics of the unborn.
*   **B: Te hiranga o ngā whakataunga ōrite a te Kooti Nui:** While his actions relate to the Supreme Court's decisions, the core of his hesitation isn't about the fairness of those decisions, but about his personal views on the timing of life.
*   **D: Te mana ki te tūmataitinga:** The passage doesn't discuss Roberts' view on the power of the presidency.



"
He aha te kaupapa i whakaaro ai a Roberts he kore-pai rawa te kōrero?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te ōrite o ngā Whakatau o te Kooti Nui**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I whakapeka a Roberts ki te whakaputa i ōna whakaaro mō te wā ka tīmata ai te oranga, he pātai hira tēnei **ina whai whakaarohia ana ngā tikanga matatika o te whakatahe, me te kī kāore e matatika ki te kōrero mō ngā āhuatanga o ngā kēhi**.""

This indicates Roberts believed it was inappropriate to discuss aspects of abortion *because* it relates to the moral tenets of abortion and is not appropriate to speak of the characteristics of fetuses.  He was hesitant to delve into the moral implications, particularly in light of the established precedent.  He essentially wanted to avoid the discussion because it fell outside of what he considered the appropriate scope of the court's role.
"
Kei whea te rua o ngā hihi marama e whiti ana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ki te rangi** (In the sky).

The passage states: ""I te 8:46 o te ata pū i wahangūngia te tāone nui, ko te wā tēnei i horo pū i pā te rererangi torohaki tuatahi i tana heipū."" This translates to: ""At 8:46 am the city awoke, and this was the time the first rainbow appeared in its sky."" Therefore, the rainbows are in the sky.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea nga kairangirangi hou e hangaia ana ki te pae?","The correct answer is **D: Kei te haere tonu te hanganga**.

The text states: ""Kei te haere tonu te hanganga mō ngā whare teitei rawa hou e rima ki te wāhi..."" which translates to ""Construction of five new high-rise buildings is still underway in the area...""

While the text mentions the time of the first sunrise, it doesn't specify *when* the new buildings are being constructed. It only confirms that the construction is ongoing.
"
He aha ngā mōhiohio e tohu ana he ana The Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā rerekētanga pāmahana (Temperature differences)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""He makariri ake i te mata karapoti i te rā, he mahana ake i te pō."" (It is cooler in the morning and warmer in the evening.) This refers to the temperature differences observed in the Seven Sisters.
"
Me pēhea te kitenga i te whanonga wera o Seven Sisters?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā atahanga pōkākā (Nighttime photographs)**.

The text states: ""He whakaatu ngā pikitia hihi pōkākā i ngā pāmahana rerekē i te awatea me te pō e whakaaturia ana he ana pea ērā."" This translates to: ""Nighttime photographs show different temperatures in the morning and evening, suggesting they may be clouds.""

Therefore, nighttime photographs are the way the temperature changes of the Seven Sisters are observed.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero mo te hunga whakapae ehara i te pono?","The correct answer is **C: E mōhiotia ana tōna iwi e ngā mana whakahaere.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kāore tonu tōna ingoa i te mōhiotia e ngā mana whakahaere, ahakoa rātou e mōhio nei he mema ia o te rōpū iwi Uighur.""  This translates to: ""His name was not known to the authorities, even though they knew he was a member of the Uyghur community.""

Therefore, the statement that the authorities *did* know his ethnicity is false, according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I whakamahia e ia he waka i te wā o te whakaeke** and **B: I whakamahia e ia tētahi waka i te wā o te whakaeke:** The passage states he used a three-wheeled cart, not a carriage.
* **D: Kāore a ia i whara:** The passage explicitly says he broke the fence (""i muri i tāna whara i te pahūtanga"").



"
He aha ngā mōhiohio e pā ana ki te whakaeke i whakapumautia e ngā mana?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā tuakiri o ētahi hoamahi (Testimonies of other comrades)**.

Here's why:

The question states the man was detained *after* a protest and that his name wasn't initially known to authorities, although he was identified as a member of the Uighur community. This suggests authorities likely relied on information from other members of the group to identify and potentially accuse him.  ""Ngā tuakiri o ētahi hoamahi"" (Testimonies of other comrades) directly reflects this.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Te iwi o te hunga whakapae (The ethnicity of the protestors):** While his ethnicity is mentioned, it's not the primary focus of the authorities' knowledge *at the time of detention*.
* **C: Ko te kaupapa i muri i te whakaeke (The cause behind the protest):**  The question doesn't provide information about the protest's cause.
* **D: Te ingoa tuatahi me te ingoa whakamutunga o te whakapae (The first and last names of the protestors):**  The text explicitly states the man's name was initially unknown to authorities.



"
Ko tēhea kapa ka tākaro i te tukinga ki Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **A: All Blacks me Ahitereiria**.

The text states: ""Ko te kēmu whakamutunga o te raupapa ki Ellis Park ki Johannesburg hei tērā wiki, hei reira ngā Springboks e tākaro ki a Ahitereiria."" This translates to: ""The final match of the series will be at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, where the Springboks will play against Australia."" (Note: ""Ahitereiria"" is the Māori name for Australia.)
"
Kei whea ngā Springboks e tākaro ai i tō rātou tukinga e whai ake nei?,"The correct answer is **A: Ahitereiria**.

The text states: ""Ko te kēmu whakamutunga o te raupapa ki Ellis Park ki Johannesburg hei tērā wiki, hei reira ngā Springboks e tākaro ki a Ahitereiria."" This translates to ""The final game of the series is at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, where the Springboks will play against Australia.""
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea i raru ai te teihana mokowhiti i te wā o te misioni?,"The correct answer is **B: Kei te pupuri i tētahi gyroscope**.

The passage explicitly states: ""I mau te teihana ki tāna i whakapono ai, ahakoa te ngaronga o te mīhini gyroscope ki te teihana wātea..."" which translates to ""The spacecraft held its position because of its gyroscope..."" The other options are not mentioned as factors causing issues during the mission.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te mahi a te teihana mokowā?","The correct answer is **C: Whakaoti ana i tētahi haerenga mokowā (To perform a controlled descent)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the spacecraft's gyroscope was malfunctioning and causing it to deviate from its intended path. The mission control initiated a controlled descent using the spacecraft's reaction wheels to correct the trajectory and return it to normal.  Therefore, the purpose of the spacecraft's action was to execute a controlled descent.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te take ehara i te mea pono?,"The incorrect statement is **B: I whakaritea he whakapae (A lawsuit was filed)**.

Here's why: The passage states that the law was created in 2003 to *prohibit* spam. It doesn't mention a lawsuit being filed *by* AOL or *against* them. The passage focuses on the government creating the law.

The other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: I whakawakia ki te kawanatanga kei reira te tari matua o AOL (AOL's headquarters were located in Virginia):** The passage explicitly states this.
*   **C: I whakamahia te ture e pā ana ki te īmēra waipēhi i roto i te take (The spam law was used in the case):** This is implied. The passage says the law was created *to* address spam.
*   **D: I te whakahikotia te AOL (AOL was challenged):** This is also implied.  The law was created to combat spam originating from AOL, meaning they were the target of the problem.



Therefore, the answer is **B**."
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tino tika ana te whakaahua?,"The correct answer is **D: I tīmataria e AOL te mahinga o te kēhi.**

Here's why:

* The provided text clearly states: ""I whakahaeretia te kēhi ki Virginia, nā te mea koirā te kāinga ki te kaituku ratonga ipurangi matua a AOL, arā ko te kamupene nā rātou ngā panoni i tīmata."" This directly translates to ""The court was held in Virginia, because it is the home of AOL's main internet provider, which is the company that initiated the court case.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I whakahikotia a AOL ki te tuari kāore i te mōhiotia** (AOL was sued for failure to monitor): The text doesn't mention being sued for failure to monitor. It focuses on the court case being initiated *by* AOL.
* **B: I pā te take ki ngā kaiwhakarato ratonga ipurangi nui e rua** (The case concerned two major internet providers): The text only mentions AOL as the internet provider in question.
* **C: I whiua te kēhi i te tau 2003** (The court was held in 2003): The text says the court was held in Virginia, but *not* in 2003. It mentions the law was created *in* 2003 to address the issue.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea karapu i tīmata ai a Vidal ki te tākaro mo te toru wā ki mua?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states: ""Kua tūhono a Vidal e 28 tau te pakeke i Barca e toru kaupeka ki muri, **mai i Sevilla**.""  This translates to ""Vidal joined Barca three years ago **from Sevilla**.""
"
E hia ngā kēmu kua tākaro a Vidal mō Barça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The question states: ""Mai i te wā i neke ki te tāone matua o Catalan, kua tākaro a Vidal i ngā kēmu e 49 mō te karapu.""  This directly tells us he has played 49 games for Barça.
"
Ko wai te kapa whakahee i te tukinga?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The passage states: ""I te noho ia ki te hōtēra o te tīma i mua i te tukinga i whakaritea mō te Rātapu ki a Bolonia."" This translates to ""He stayed at the team hotel before the scheduled match on Sunday against Bologna."" Therefore, Bologna is the team Jarque is traveling to play against.
"
He aha a Jarque i noho ai ki te hotera?,"The correct answer is **D: I te whakangungu a ia ki Bolonia**.

The question states: ""I te te haratau a Jargue i te whakangungu i mua i te kaupeka ki Coverciano i Itāria... I noho ia ki te hōtēra o te tīma i mua i te tukinga i whakaritea mō te Rātapu ki a Bolonia."" This directly indicates that he stayed at the hotel in preparation for the game against Bologna.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He mahi tāna (He is doing work)** - While it's implied he's working, the sentence specifically mentions preparation for a game, not general work.
* **B: He hui tōmua tōna (He has a meeting)** - The text doesn't mention any meeting.
* **C: He ōrite tōna i te Rātapu (He has a day off on Sunday)** - The text mentions a game *on* Sunday, not that he has a day off.



"
He aha e kore ai e tukuna he whakatūpato e te pokapū ā-whenua o Jakarta?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore i tutuki i a ia ngā whakaritenga nui mō ngā rū (It did not meet the major standards for zones).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""e ai ki te tari takotoranga whenua o Jakarta, kāore tētahi whakatūpato tai āniwhaniwha e tukua i te mea kāore te rū o te whenua i tae ki te hiahia o te 6.5"" (according to the Jakarta land bureau, no tsunami evacuation plan has been issued because the land zone has not reached the requirement of 6.5).  This refers to the standards related to the *zone* (rū) and its vulnerability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaore he tuma o te tsunami (There is no tsunami warning system):** The passage *doesn't* say there's no warning system. It discusses the lack of an *evacuation plan* tied to the zone's standards.
* **B: Hei karo i te āwangawanga i waenga i ngā kainoho (To avoid panic among residents):** While avoiding panic is a desirable outcome of any disaster plan, the core issue is the unmet zoning standards.
* **C: Hei karo i te pānga ki ngā pakihi o te rohe (To avoid damage to businesses in the area):**  Similar to B, protecting businesses is a consequence, but not the fundamental reason for the lack of the evacuation plan.



Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the passage's meaning is D.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te rū?","The correct answer is **D: He 6.5 i runga i te tauine nui**.

The passage states: ""...kāore tētahi whakatūpato tai āniwhaniwha e tukua i te mea kāore te rū o te whenua i tae ki te hiahia o te 6.5."" This translates to ""...no tsunami warning has been issued because the ground shaking has not reached the 6.5 threshold.""

Therefore, the ""rū"" (shaking/tremor) refers to a magnitude of 6.5 on the Richter scale.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e akiaki ana i te mahi a te Rā me ētahi atu whetū katoa?,"The correct answer is **B: Tau Rossy, hurihanga, me te hurihanga aukume.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nā te whērikoriko o ngā whetū katoa o te kāhui whetū, ō rātou huringa hoki. Kei te whakamahia tahitia te kanapā me te huringa hei whakatau i te tau Rossby a tētahi tau, ā, e hāngai ana tērā ki te rere wētoto. Te iti iho o te nama Rossby, ka ngoikore ake te whetū mō te āhuatanga ki te hurihanga aukume.""

This directly links the Rossby wave, rotation, and jet stream to the behavior of stars, including the Sun.  The Rossby wave is a key factor influencing the Sun's activity and its relationship to the jet stream.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te marama me te rere plasma:** While solar flares and plasma flow *are* aspects of solar activity, the passage doesn't primarily focus on these as the overarching mechanism affecting the Sun's behavior in relation to other stars.
* **C: Te hurihanga me te marama:** Similar to A, these are factors influencing the Sun, but not the core concept described in the passage.
* **D: Te marama, te nama Rossby, me te hurihanga:** While this includes some correct elements, the passage emphasizes the *interaction* of rotation and Rossby waves, not just the presence of the Rossby wave itself.  Option B captures the combined influence better.



"
Me pēhea te whakatau i tētahi tau Rossby whetū?,"The correct answer is **C: Te taumata ngohe** (The Rossby wave amplitude).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nā te whērikoriko o ngā whetū katoa o te kāhui whetū, ō rātou huringa hoki. Kei te whakamahia tahitia te kanapā me te huringa hei whakatau i te tau Rossby a tētahi tau, ā, e hāngai ana tērā ki te rere wētoto."" (The wobble of all the stars of the star cluster, their rotation. The wobble and rotation are used to determine the Rossby wave of a year, and it relates to the jet stream.)
* **The passage also states:** ""Te iti iho o te nama Rossby, ka ngoikore ake te whetū mō te āhuatanga ki te hurihanga aukume."" (The smaller the Rossby number, the more the star deviates towards the anti-spiral feature.)  This implies a relationship between the *amplitude* or size of the Rossby wave and how much the star's motion deviates.

Therefore, the Rossby wave is related to the amplitude (the height or size) of the wave.  Option C, ""Te taumata ngohe"" (The Rossby wave amplitude), is the most accurate description of what determines the Rossby wave of a star.



"
He aha te ōrau o ngā tāngata i tirotirohia e tautoko ana kia tū wawe a Ahitereiria hei kāwanatanga?,"The correct answer is **A: 31 ōrau**.

The passage states: ""Ngā tonu nui o te pōti, **29 paeheneti e mea ana me wawe tonu te tū a Ahitereiria i runga i tōna ake mana motuhake, 31 paeheniti e mea ana me kaua a Ahitereiria e pērā.**""  This means 31% of the people surveyed want Australia to *not* become a republic (i.e., stay as is).
"
"E ai ki a Julie Gillard, āhea ka riro ai a Ahitereiria hei kāwanatanga?","The correct answer is **B: I muri i te kingitanga o Kuini Elizabeth II**.

The text states: ""I whakapono a Pirimia Julia Gillard nōnā e whakarite ana mō te pōtitanga whānui kia noho a Ahitereiria i runga i tōna ake mana motuhake whai muri mai i te matenga o Kuini Irihāpeti II."" (Prime Minister Julia Gillard believed she was arranging the referendum so that Australia would become fully independent *after* the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.)



"
Ko tēhea whakahaere kei raro i te rangahau ā-ture?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Komen Foundation**.

The question states that Leslie Aun, a spokesperson for the Komen Foundation, announced the new policy regarding donations to organizations under legal scrutiny."
Ko Cliff Stearns te māhunga o tēhea komiti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te Komiti o te Whare o Ngā Waiora me te Hokohoko**.

The text states that Cliff Stearns is a member of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee, ""under the umbrella of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.""  The option that best reflects this is ""Ko te Komiti o te Whare o Ngā Waiora me te Hokohoko"" (The House Committee on Energy and Commerce).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea kaore i pā ki te wahine swis?","The correct answer is **A: I whakaorangia ana taonga tāhae**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the victim's phone and laptop (""Ko rātou i kitea hoki ōna rorohiko me tōna waea pūkoro"").
* It also says the victim was abducted by five people (""Tokorima ngā tāngata kua mauheretia e mātou"").
* The passage *doesn't* mention anything about the victim's valuables being recovered or stolen. Therefore, it's the statement that is *not* supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I patua a ia:** The passage doesn't mention the victim being physically assaulted.
* **C: I tukinotia ia e ngā tāngata e 5:**  The passage *does* state she was abducted by five people.
* **D: I tāhaetia tana waea me tana rorohiko pona:** The passage *does* state that her phone and laptop were recovered.



"
Ko tēhea kamupene i whakawhiwhia ki te Whakawhiwhinga Mārō o Taiwana i te tau 2007?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The question states that ASUS was the company that won the Sustainable Taiwan 2007 award.
"
He aha te RW ASUS Eee?,"The correct answer is **B: He rorohiko pona (A netbook)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ka tū a ASUS Eee PC, kua whakarewaina i mua puta noa i te ao mō ngā āhuatanga penapena-utu me te pai o te mahi, **hei kaupapa nui i 2007 Taipei IT Month**."" and later ""...**mō te ririhiko pōnaho** ka tīno tīni whai muri i te rironga a ASUS i te paraihe Sustainable Taiwan 2007...""  This clearly identifies the Eee PC as a netbook.
"
Ko wai te kawenga mō ngā tuhinga mēra ngaro?,"The correct answer is **C: He tama**.

The text states: ""...kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, **kaore i tukuna ki te hunga whakawhiwhi tika**, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, **kaore i tukuna ki te hunga whakawhiwhi tika** ... kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ngā kāri Tau Hou e 429, kei roto ko ng"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i tuku whakapae e pā ana ki ngā tuhinga ngaro?","The correct answer is **D: Te tari poutāpeta o Obanazawa**.

The passage states: ""Inanahi, i tukuna e te poutāpeta tā rātou whakapāha ki ngā kirirarau me te pāpaho..."" which translates to ""Immediately, the archive sent their complaint to the media and the police...""  The archive is the Obanazawa archive.  Therefore, the archive (tari poutāpeta o Obanazawa) is the one who sent the complaint.
"
I te wā e hiahia ana a Del Potro ki te whakatutuki i tana raruraru pokohiwi?,"The correct answer is **C: I te wā o te huinga tuarua**.

The question states: ""I a Del Potro te kāhukahuka wawe ki te huinga tuarua, engari i hiahiatia hoki tēnei i te paenga whitu i muri i te tae atu ki te 6-6. I riro i a Potro he rongoā mō tana pokohiwi i tēnei wā ēngari i hoki tonu atu ki te kēmu."" This translates to: ""Del Potro experienced a sudden injury at the second set, but this was treated in the third set after reaching 6-6. Potro received medicine for his wrist at this time but returned to the game."" Therefore, his wrist injury occurred during the second set.
"
He aha te hua o te wehenga here tuatahi?,"The correct answer is **A: I ngaro i a Murray i te huinga tuatahi**.

The passage states: ""I hinga a Murray i te huinga tuatahi i te whawhati piro ōrite i muri i te mau a ngā tāne e rua ki ia hau ki te huinga."" which translates to ""Murray lost the first set in a tiebreak after the two men held each other's serve.""



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: I ngaro i a Del Potro i muri i tōna matenga:** Del Potro did not lose after his injury; he continued playing.
*   **C: I toatia e Murrary i te huinga tuarua:** The passage says Del Potro had a comeback in the second set.
*   **D: I toatia e Del Potro i te huinga tuarua:** This is incorrect as the passage describes Del Potro having a comeback, not winning the set.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai, i whakapā atu ki tētahi tūroro?","The correct answer is **B: Tamariki**.

The text states: """"I kī hoki te kāwana, """"I tēnei rā, i ako mātou ko ētahi tamariki he kura te pakeke kua tautohua he pānga ō rātou ki te tūroro."""" """" (The governor said, ""Today, we have learned that some children in school have been affected by gun violence."")

Therefore, the children are the ones mentioned as being affected by gun violence and learning about it.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te whakaūnga i kore ai te kāwana e mahi i te wā e kōrero ana ki nga tangata whenua o TeKiki?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te pai te mahi a te pūnaha**.

Here's why:

The passage states, ""He take nui tēnei. Kauka e māharahara, e haere pai ana te pūnaha ki tāna e āhei ai"" which translates to ""This is a big deal. Don't forget, the system is working well.""

The governor is emphasizing that the system is functioning effectively, implying that there's no need for further action *at this time* regarding the concerns of the Native American people. He's downplaying their concerns by highlighting the existing system's competence.  The other options are either directly stated in the passage (B) or are not the governor's immediate point (C & D).
"
Ko tēhea puna kōrero parody i hangaia e ngā ākonga o mua o te UW?,"The correct answer is **D: Te Aniani**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mai i tana orokohanga mai kua noho te aniani hei rangatiratanga pono o te emapaia parody..."" which translates to ""Since its inception, The Onion has become the definitive leader of satirical journalism...""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i roto i te rangatiratanga o te rongo o Onion?","The correct answer is **B: He pikitia (Pictures)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly lists the following as part of The Onion's output:

*   **Ngā tūruhi 5,000,000 i te marama o Oketopa (5,000,000 downloads in October)** - Referring to articles/stories
*   **Ngā pānui tāngata (Human interest stories)**
*   **Ngā hāore 24 pūrongo kōrero (24-hour news radio)** - This is likely a parody radio show.
*   **Ngā pakihere (Satire)**
*   **Ngā atlas o te ao (Atlases of the world)**

The passage *does not* mention **pikitia (pictures)** as part of The Onion's output. While The Onion likely *does* use pictures on its website and in its articles, it isn't listed as a core part of its defined ""rangatiratanga o te rongo"" (range of news). It *does* explicitly mention it as a ""paetukutuku"" (website) and a ""putanga tā"" (publication).

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea i tiakina e nga pirihimana?","The correct answer is **C: Te tomokanga o te Tiriti Whakararo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""I muri tata tonu i te 11:00, nā ngā kaitautohe i aukati i ngā waka ki te kāreti whakateraki ki Whitehall. I te 11.20 i pātaingia e ngā pirihimana ngā kaiporotēhi kia hoki atu ki te ara paparaima, me te whakatau iho kia tika te tauritenga o te porotēhi ki te tini o ngā waka e whakatōpu ana."" This indicates the security personnel were protecting the route of the motorcade, implying the security of Downing Street and potentially the surrounding area, *especially* considering the mention of the security barriers around Downing Street.  The protection of Downing Street (and the area around it) is directly linked to the security of the Treaty of Downing, which is the security perimeter around the Prime Minister's residence.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tapawhā Trafalgar** - Trafalgar Square is just a location on the route, not what was being protected.
*   **B: Te Huinga o te Kōanga** - The Conservative Party meeting is the *destination* of the motorcade, not what security was focused on *during the route*.
*   **D: Ko te Grand Connaught Rooms hotera** - The Grand Connaught Rooms is the *final destination*, not what security was protecting along the way.



"
I te āhea te wā i tono ai te pirihimana kia neke atu ngā kaiwhawhai kia kore ai e nui ake te waka?,"The correct answer is **D: I te 11:20**.

The passage states: ""I te 11.20 i pātaingia e ngā pirihimana ngā kaiporotēhi kia hoki atu ki te ara paparaima, me te whakatau iho kia tika te tauritenga o te porotēhi ki te tini o ngā waka e whakatōpu ana."" (At 11:20, the security asked the motorcade to return to the main road and ensure the motorcade's arrival was coordinated with the numerous vehicles being deployed.)
"
He aha te pono mo te rangahau i mahia e Dr. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **C: E tūmanako ana a ia ka āhei nga kitenga ki te rongoā.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Pēnei i ētahi atu tōhunga, kei te ruarua kē ōna mahara e pā ana ki te whakaora i te mate huka, me te mōhio iho kāore ēnei kōrero e hāngai ana ki te hunga kua pāngia kētia ki te mate huka momo 1.""  This indicates Dr. Ur is actively researching a cure for the flu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tērā pea ka whai painga ngā hua ki ngā tūroro whai mate huka Momo 1 tīariari:** The passage explicitly says the findings *aren't* relevant to Type 1 diabetes.
* **B: Kua kore ētahi kiore huka i mua i te huka:**  This is mentioned in the passage as a finding about young mice, but it's not what Dr. Ur is *doing* in his research.
* **D: Ināianei he huka ētahi kiore kāore i te huka:** This is a result of the young mice research, but it's not the overall focus of Dr. Ur's work.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha a Dr. to whakaaro tika?","The correct answer is **A: Mēnā e hāngai ana ngā kitenga mō ngā tāngata whai mate huka Momo 1**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...kei te ruarua kē ōna mahara e pā ana ki te whakaora i te mate huka, me te mōhio iho kāore ēnei kōrero e hāngai ana ki te hunga kua pāngia kētia ki te mate huka momo 1.""  This means Dr. Ur's research and focus are *not* on treating Type 1 diabetes.  Option A reflects this directly. The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Ki te taea te rongoā:** While Dr. Ur is involved in medical research, the passage doesn't say he *believes* a cure is possible, only that he's researching treatments.
* **C: Ko nga whakaaro o ētahi atu tohunga e pā ana ki te rongoā:** The passage focuses on Dr. Ur's *own* thoughts and research.
* **D: Ki te noho tonu ngā kiore kāore i te huka:** This is a very narrow and incomplete interpretation of Dr. Ur's overall work. The passage discusses his research on diabetes in general.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei kāore e whakaahua tika ana i te hinganga o te rerenga CG4684?,"The correct answer is **C: E toru ngā ngana o te waka rererangi ki te tau iho i mua i te hinganga.**

Here's why:

* **The provided text states the Twin Otter crashed on its first takeoff attempt.** It doesn't mention any previous attempts. Option C incorrectly states there were three attempts.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate based on the text:

* **A: Kāore i taea e te waka rererangi te eke ki raro nā te huarere** - The text explicitly states the crash was due to bad weather, which caused the aircraft to not be able to descend properly.
* **B: I hinga te rererangi ki tētahi wāhi tino tawhiti** - The text mentions it took ten minutes to take off, and the wreckage was found later, implying a remote location.
* **D: I pāngia te rapu mō te wāhi i hinga ai te rererangi e te rangi** - The text states the search for the crash site was hampered by bad weather.



"
He aha te take i haukotia ai e Flight CG4684 tōna tauranga?,"The correct answer is **A: Kāore i taea te uru atu ki te wāhi tūruhi (Unable to reach the destination)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""He whakararurarungia te rapunga e te huarere kino i kore ai te waka i tau."" This translates to ""The flight was canceled due to bad weather, so the plane did not land.""  This directly explains *why* the flight couldn't reach its destination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He maha ētahi atu rererangi i mua i te CG4684 (Many other planes flew before CG4684)** - This is irrelevant to why *this* flight was canceled.
* **C: I kōrerotia te waka rererangi ki Kokoda (The plane was reported to Kokoda)** -  The text indicates the plane was *heading* to Kokoda, but the issue was reaching it.
* **D: He rawakore nga āhuatanga o te huarere (The weather conditions were favorable)** - This is the opposite of what the text says. The weather was *bad*.

"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te wheako o Franciszek Kowal?","The correct answer is **A: I taea e ia te wawahi i tētahi matapihi (He was able to break a mat)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kātahi anō ka pakaru tētahi o ngā matapihi, ā, kā tīmata rātou te puta atu mā te matapihi,"" which translates to ""Then one of the mats broke, and they started to come out through the mat.""  This indicates Franciszek Kowal *caused* a mat to break.  He wasn't simply a passive observer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: I te mutunga ka kore a ia i te mōhiotia (In the end, he wasn't noticed):** The passage doesn't mention if he was noticed or not.
* **C: I pakaru tētahi tūru i a ia e ngana ana ki te puta (A beam broke on him while he was trying to get out):** The passage says the *mats* broke, not beams, and there's no indication that anything broke *on* him.
* **D: I whara a ia i a ia e ngana ana ki te whati i tētahi matapihi (He broke himself while trying to break a mat):**  The passage says he was trying to break the mats, not break *himself*.



"
He aha i uaua ai te whakatau i te pānga o te Huringa Tropical Danielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Kai tawhiti atu te āwhā i te whenua (The storm is far from land)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""I te mea he tawhiti te whaititiri i te horonga whenua, ka uaua rā te aromatawai i ngā pānga ki te United States ki Caribbean rānei."" (Because the storm is far from land, it is difficult to predict the effects on the United States or the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E tohu ana te āwhā kia kaha ki te āwhā (The storm is indicated to be strengthening):** While the storm is strengthening, this doesn't directly explain why predicting impacts is difficult.
*   **B: Kāore e tino mōhio ngā kaipūtaiao mō ngā hau o te tupuhi (Scientists are not well aware of wind patterns):** The passage doesn't say scientists are unaware of wind patterns.
*   **D: He tawhiti rawa te āwhā i Miami (The storm is very far from Miami):** While the storm is far from Miami, the key issue is its distance from *land* in general.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te Hurricane Danielle he teka?","The correct answer is **C: Tērā pea ka huri hei āwhā (It may turn into a hurricane)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kei te matapaetia e ngā kaipūtaiao ki te National Hurricane Centre ka kaha haere a Danielle kia haumātakataka ai hei te Wenerei"" which translates to ""Scientists at the National Hurricane Center are monitoring Danielle and it is expected to intensify into a hurricane by Wednesday.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kāore i te mōhiotia te pānga ki ngā Kāriana (The impact on the Caribbean is not known)** - The passage says it's difficult to predict the impact on the US and Caribbean due to the distance.
* **B: I hangaia ki te Moana Aterangi (It formed in the Indian Ocean)** - The passage clearly states Danielle formed in the Atlantic Ocean.
* **D: E tata ana ki te whenua (It is approaching land)** - The passage says it's *far* from land, making prediction difficult.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e whakahuatia ana me pā ki te mate i mua i te take o te urutā huri noa?","The correct answer is **B: Me noho māmā tonu ngā tohu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ētahi tirohanga e mea ana ka āhua maninohea noa te pā o te tahumaero i mua i te hōrapatanga urutā, hei tāna. Ko ētahi tirohanga e mea ana ka āhua maninohea noa te pā o te tahumaero i mua i te hōrapatanga urutā, hei tāna.

Ko ētahi tirohanga e mea ana ka āhua maninohea noa te pā o te tahumaero i mua i te hōrapatanga urutā, hei tāna.""

The passage highlights that the symptoms before the outbreak were mild. The phrase ""Me noho māmā tonu ngā tohu"" translates to ""The symptoms continued to be mild.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Me noho māmā tonu ngā tohu:** This is what the passage *contradicts*, stating the symptoms were mild *before* the outbreak.
* **C: Me āhuatanga:** This is too general. The passage is referring to the *mildness* of the symptoms.
* **D: Ko ētahi tirohanga e mea ana ka āhua maninohea noa te pā o te tahumaero i mua i te hōrapatanga urutā, hei tāna:** This is a repetition of the same information in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te tawhiti atu i Fujian te āwhā?","The correct answer is **D: 77 mita**.

Here's why:

* The question states the storm was 60 kilometers away from Fujian.
* The storm is moving *towards* China.
* To find the distance *from* Fujian, you need to add the distance the storm is from Fujian to its current distance from China.
* 60 km (distance from Fujian) + 11 km (speed x time, implying the distance it will travel in one hour) = 71 km. This is incorrect.
* The problem states that the storm was 60 km away at 9 AM.  It is moving towards China at 11 km/h. So at 10 AM it would be 50 km away, at 11 AM it would be 40 km away. At noon it would be 30km away and so on. 
* But the question asks ""how far is the storm from Fujian?"" and the original question stated that the storm was 60 kilometers away from Fujian. 
* So the original question statement ""I te pō o te 9 o Akuhata whitu tekau kiromita te tawhiti o te karu o Morakot i te rohe o Fujian"" is the correct statement and the answer is 60 kilometers. However, none of the options state this number, so there is some missing context. 
* Let's re-read the original question. It says that at 9am, the storm was 60km from Fujian. It is also moving at 11km/h. It does not state when the question is asked, or if the given 60 km is the actual distance, or if the question is asking what the future distance from Fujian will be based on the current speed. 
* So the closest answer is 77 meters, since 60 kilometers is 60000 meters. It's the closest value to 60000 meters. 
* Since the storm is heading towards China, the current distance (60 km) is the distance from Fujian, and the question asks how far it is from Fujian. The distance is currently 60 kilometers.  But we have to choose from the available answers. 
* The problem is badly worded and it should say how far is the storm from China?
* Let's assume the question is ""how far is the storm from China?""
* The storm was 60 km from Fujian.
* The storm is moving towards China at 11km/h.
* The distance from China is 60 km + 11 km = 71km. This isn't an option.

Given the options and the badly worded question, the answer is probably 60 kilometers, but that is not an option. However, if we assume that the original context of the question is the storm is 60000 meters from Fujian at 9am, and is moving at 11km/h, and the question is what is the distance after time, it is ambiguous how to read this. 

However, if we consider the wording of the question and available options, it seems that the options are meant to represent the distance from China. Given that the storm is 60000 meters from Fujian, and it moves towards China at 11km/h. Let's assume it means how far is it from China at the time the question is asked. 
Since we don't know the time the question is asked, we cannot deduce it.
But 60km is 60000 meters. So the option closest to 60000 meters is 77 meters. This seems to be a bad trick question.
Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{77}$"
Ko wai i mihi ki a Hōri W. Bush i tōna taenga atu ki Āhia?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng me Lee Hsien Loong**.

The text states: ""I mihia ia e te Pirimia Tuarua o Hingapoa a Wong Kan Seng, ā, i wānanga i te hokohoko me ngā take whakatuatea ki te Pirimia o Hingapoa a Lee Hsien Loong."" This means both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong welcomed President Bush. Option C is the most accurate reflection of this information.
"
I te wā i kōrero ai te peresideni mō te whakawhānui hokohoko o Āhia?,"The correct answer is **C: I muri i ōna hinganga pōti waenganui.**

The passage states: ""Nā Bush i whaki atu ki tētahi minenga mō te whakawhānuitanga o te hokohoko ki Āhia. **I muri i ōna hinganga pōti waenganui**...""  This indicates the announcement about expanding trade occurred *after* the midterm election results.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te whāinga katoa a te kāwanatanga?","The correct answer is **C: Acquire ētahi atu pānga e 1,300**.

Here's why:

* The text states the government is distributing funds to supplementary schools, covering 1,3000 (which is likely a typo for 1,300) students.
* Option C directly reflects this: ""Acquire ētahi atu pānga e 1,300"" means ""Acquire additional funds for 1,300"".
* The other options are incorrect:
    * A: Mentions dates other than May.
    * B: Mentions 300 funds, which is not the total number of students covered.
    * D: Is too vague and doesn't relate specifically to the number of students.



"
He aha te whakapuaki a te kāwanatanga?,"The correct answer is **C: E whakaaro ana rātau ki te whakarato i ētahi atu pānga e 1,300.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""He tāpiritanga 300 e kapi katoa ai ngā hariata ki te 1,3000 e manawatā anō ai i te tini tāngata."" This translates to: ""A payment of 300 covers all the invoices for 1,300 people who are still struggling.""  Therefore, the government's aim is to provide support for 1,300 people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E whakaaro ana rātau ki te whakarato i ētahi atu pānga e 300:** This is incorrect because the text states 300 *covers* the invoices for 1300 people, not that they are providing 300 additional payments.
*   **B: E whakaū ana rātau ki te whakawhirinaki i te raruraru pā:** The text doesn't indicate the government is trying to alleviate the problem, it's *providing* support.
*   **D: Ka whakaotitia te raruraru nui rawa atu i a Poutāpeta:** This is completely unrelated to the text. There is no mention of Poutāpeta (likely referring to a person's name) or resolving the problem in that way.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā mōhiohio e mōhiotia ana?","The correct answer is **A: Kua whakahekea te taumata tuma** (The tide level has decreased).

Here's why:

The sentence says: ""Nāna i kī, """"Kāore he mōhiohio hei marohi kei te tataritia tonutia tētahi ekenga. Heoi anō, kāore te hekenga iho o te taumata mōrearea ki te kino e kī ana kua ngaro te mōrearea whānui."""" ""

This translates roughly to: ""She said, """"There is no reason to be worried about a rise in a tide. However, the drop in the tide level is not saying that the large tide has disappeared.""""

The key phrase is ""kua whakahekea te taumata mōrearea"" which means ""the tide level has decreased"". The speaker is stating that the *decrease* in the tide level is something to note, but not a cause for alarm, and it doesn't necessarily mean the larger tide is gone.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kua kore he tuma** (There is no tide): The speaker explicitly states there is a *drop* in the tide, so this is wrong.
*   **C: E tūmanakohia ana he whakaeke** (A rise is expected): The sentence is about a *decrease*, not an expected rise.
*   **D: Kua whakapumautia e te Rongoā ka kaha te whakaeke** (The healers have confirmed and the rise will be strong):  This is not mentioned in the provided text.



"
Ko tehea o ngā kōrero e pā ana ki ngā whakaeke ehara i te mea pono?,"The correct answer is **A: Ko te komihana a te perehitini he urupare ki nga amuamu (The president's commission is a cover-up of the facts)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states the commission was established *as part of a package* to address the country's transition to new ballots.** This implies it's a response to concerns and a move to provide transparency.  It doesn't suggest a cover-up.
* **B: Ko ngā pōti kua whakamutua i whakaoho i ngā amuamu (The ballots that were used have been restored to the facts)** - The text doesn't mention the ballots being restored.
* **C: I tonoa e nga whakahē te tukunga iho o te CEP o mua (The complainants requested the release of the former CEP)** - The text says the complainants *challenged* the release of the former CEP, not requested its release.
* **D: I ētahi wā he pākaha nga whakahē (The complainants were sometimes difficult)** - The text says the recounts were sometimes difficult due to missing ballots, implying the complainants weren't inherently difficult.



Therefore, the most inaccurate statement is that the president's commission is a cover-up. The text portrays it as a response to a problematic situation.



"
Na wai i whakaaro kia whakarere te CEP whakamutunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Martelly**.

The text states: ""I tērā marama i tautuhia e tētahi komihana perehitene te rihainatanga o te CEP o mua hei wāhanga o tētahi kete kaupapa hei whakaneke i te whenua ki ngā pōti hou. Ko te kōmihana he whakautu nā Martelly mō te horapatanga o te porotēhi ātete kāwanatanga i tīmata i te Oketopa."" This clearly indicates that Martelly initiated the plan to disband the last CEP.
"
"E ai ki te kōrero, he aha te mea e kore e tautokohia e te USA Gymnastics i muri i te tukino a Nassar ki ngā kaitākaro?","The correct answer is **A: Whakakoretanga (Non-closure)**.

The passage explicitly states that USA Gymnastics *refuses* to settle for a ""tiwhikete"" (settlement) and needs to continue to move forward by implementing systemic change, not just a payout. This implies they are not accepting a simple financial settlement as sufficient.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Te hanga i tētahi taiao whai mana (Creating a safe environment):** The passage states they *agree* to create a safe environment and are working towards it.
*   **C: Ngā huringa e hiahiatia ana i roto i te whakahaere (Necessary changes in administration):** They *agree* that changes in administration are needed and are committed to making them.
*   **D: He tūhura takitahi (A single scandal):** The passage addresses a series of abuses, not just a single scandal.



"
"E ai ki te kōrero, he aha te whāinga matua o te USA Gymnastics me te United States Olympic Committee e haere whakamua ana?","The correct answer is **D: Whakatoko ana i tētahi taiao haumaru mō ngā kaipūkaro**.

Here's why:

The passage states multiple times that both USA Gymnastics and the USOC are committed to creating a safe environment for all athletes. They are taking steps to achieve this, referencing the Larry Nassar situation and the need for ongoing ethical improvements. While the Nassar situation is important, the overarching goal is to ensure athlete safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E mārama ana i runga i te tūkinotanga a Larry Nassar:** While the Nassar situation is *referenced*, it's not the *main* goal. It's a problem they are trying to resolve to achieve safety.
* **B: E whai ana i te whakawāteatanga:** The passage doesn't focus on achieving accreditation.
* **C: E whai ana i tētahi tūhuratanga tūmataiti:**  While the situation requires careful consideration, the core aim is safety, not simply a ""thorough examination.""



"
I haere te kaipuke ki hea i te wā i puta ai te aitua? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The passage states: ""He kaipuke whakakore maina rōpū Avenger, i te haere te kaipuke ki Puerto Princesa ki Palawan."" (An Avenger-class destroyer, the ship went to Puerto Princesa in Palawan.)

Therefore, the ship went to Palawan when the incident occurred."
He aha te mea ehara i te mea pono mo te kaipuke e whakahuatia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **A: I a ia e haere ana ki Puerto Princesa**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""He kaipuke whakakore maina rōpū Avenger, i te haere te kaipuke ki **Puerto Princesa ki Palawan**."" This means the ship *is* going to Puerto Princesa.  Therefore, option A, ""I a ia e haere ana ki Puerto Princesa"" is **false** based on the text.

Let's look at the other options:

*   **B: E ai ki Palawan** - The text states the ship is going to Puerto Princesa *in* Palawan, so this is true.
*   **C: He kaipuke ātete tēnei** - The text says it's an Avenger-class guided missile destroyer. This implies it *is* a destroyer, so this is true.
*   **D: Kua whakaritea ki te Whitu o nga Fleet o te Moana o U.S.** - The text clearly states this, so this is true.

Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that the ship is going to Puerto Princesa.



"
Ko wai i tuku i te kōrero e pā ana ki nga hoia o Amerika?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The question states that the President of the United States, Donald Trump, made the announcement about withdrawing troops.
"
"E ai ki te whakapuakitanga, ko tehea whenua i whakawhiwhia ki te kaitiaki i nga kaiwhawhai herehere?","The correct answer is **D: Turkey**.

The passage states: ""Ko Tākei mō te tiaki i ngā kaiwhawhai ISIS kua mauheretia..."" which translates to ""Turkey for the protection of the ISIS fighters who have been captured...""
"
He aha te mea e whakapono ana ko te take o te hinga?,"The correct answer is **C: Whenua Maunga (Mountainous terrain)**.

The text states: ""Kei te herea ngā mahi ki te rapu i te wāhi tukituki e te huarere kino, me te whenua pakeke."" This translates to ""Efforts are being focused on finding a landing site in the bad weather, and the mountainous terrain.""  Therefore, the mountainous terrain is cited as a reason for the difficulty and potential cause of the crash.
"
He aha te āhua o te whenua i puta ai te hinganga?,"The correct answer is **D: Maunga (Mountain)**.

The text states: ""Kei te herea ngā mahi ki te rapu i te wāhi tukituki e te huarere kino, me te **whenua pakeke**.""  ""Whenua pakeke"" translates to ""old land"" or ""mature land,"" but in this context, given the previous mention of a ""tihi rā anō o te whenua maunga nei"" (the very peak of the mountain land), the ""whenua pakeke"" refers to the **mountainous region** where the destruction occurred. 

Therefore, the answer is D.
"
He aha ngā tūmanako a ngā mana whakahaere nā te waipuke?,"The correct answer is **A: Te whakaoratanga o ngā pae kirikiri** (The restoration of riparian habitats).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the dam's construction *improved* the environment for spawning and created habitats for fish. 
* It also mentions the hope that the agencies (āpiha) will ""work to restore the riparian habitats below the dam."" 
* Option A directly reflects this restoration goal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te hanganga o nga one** (The creation of lagoons): While lagoons *were* created, the passage doesn't state this as the *primary* hope or goal. It's a consequence of the dam's impact, not the intended outcome.
* **C: He nui ake te maha o ngā chubs takawai** (A larger population of humpback chubs): The passage mentions some humpback chubs *decreased* and some *disappeared*. This is the opposite of what the agencies hoped for regarding chubs.
* **D: Ētahi atu wāhi waiora** (Other healthy aquatic areas): While likely a benefit, the passage specifically mentions *riparian habitats* and the restoration of those.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i pā pūmau tonu te hanganga o te matatara?,"The correct answer is **D: Kua horahia te Sediment (Sediment has been reduced)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the dam's construction *reduced* the sediment flow downstream.  The other options relate to the *effects* of the dam, but not the long-term consequences of the dam's construction itself.
* **Pae kirikiri (Riparian zones)** are areas along a riverbank and are affected by sediment.
* **Humpback chubs** are a species of fish impacted by the change in the environment due to sediment reduction.
* **Ngā wāhi noho o te araora (Habitat of the fish)** are also impacted by sediment changes.
* The primary long-term consequence of dam construction in this context is the alteration of sediment flow, which has cascading effects on the ecosystem.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i hoatu te āhua o Te Hononga o Amerika mo nga haerengatērā pea?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā kaiwhakahārua Hūmārie (Humanitarian organizations)**.

The passage states that the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been informed about humanitarian organizations organizing the removal of outdated stockpiles of mines in Kenya and Ethiopia.  The phrase ""tīwhanga tino whawhai nō Hūmārie"" translates to ""the main combatants of humanitarian organizations"". Therefore, the passage is referring to humanitarian organizations.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te mahere whakaeke a nga kaiwhakarua?,"The correct answer is **C: Whakapakūtia ngā pomu i ngā rohe i ngā whenua e rua**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the US government is concerned about the *smuggling of counterfeit medicine into Kenya and Ethiopia*. This means the counterfeiting is happening in *both* countries.
* The passage also mentions the concern about using the counterfeit medicines to *fake ""official country marks""* in both Kenya and Ethiopia, implying the counterfeiting is targeting both countries.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the scope of the US government's concern and the activity being described.  The other options are too narrow.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā tāngata e whai ake nei ehara i te rōia?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

The text explicitly states that Petros Mantouvalos is a Member of Parliament *and* a lawyer. Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are identified as lawyers. Makis Triantafylopoulos is described as a journalist.
"
Ko tehea rōpū tāngata e kore e whakahuatia hei wāhanga o te aitua i roto i te hapori ture Kariki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā Kaipānui (Journalists)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the misconduct of lawyers (rōia), judges (rōia), and a member of parliament who is also a lawyer. It highlights the controversy surrounding these legal professionals and the negative impact on the legal community.

While journalists (kaipānui) *report* on these issues, they are not directly implicated in the legal misconduct being discussed. The passage doesn't mention them as part of the problem or the focus of the controversy. The other options (lawyers, prosecutors, and lawyers again) are specifically named as being involved in the questionable activities.
"
E hia nga paepae i ngaro i Īnia?,"The correct answer is **D: 36**.

The question states: ""whai muri i te ngaronga o tā te kāpene wīkiti i riro noa i a Īnia te 36 omanga...""  This directly translates to ""after the loss of the captain's wicket, India only scored 36 runs..."".

Therefore, India lost **36** runs.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tapeke teitei rawa o nga wāhanga?","The correct answer is **A: 70 ngā whakahaere**.

The passage states: ""I eke a Robin Uthappa ki te ngā piro nui rawa o te wāhanga, arā ko ngā omanga 70 ki te 41 pōro noa iho mā te hau i ngā whā 11, i ngā ono e 2.""  This translates to ""Robin Uthappa achieved the highest score of the innings, which was 70 runs in just 41 balls during the fourth innings.""
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te take o te āhua o Arama Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **D: Lies mō te take o te muku toi (Lies about the reason for the art)**.

Here's why:

The text states Adam Cuerden was upset about ""the misinformation regarding his art."" It explicitly mentions inaccuracies about the *reason* for his art. Option D directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te kaupapahere hōu a te pae e pā ana ki ngā ihirangi tōkai (The new administration of the platform concerning open content)** - This is mentioned as a general context for the issue.
*   **B: Muku toi o Weera (Weera's art)** -  The text doesn't detail Weera's art; it focuses on inaccuracies *about* Cuerden's art. 
*   **C: Kāore i te whakarongotia e Weera (Weera was not consulted)** - This is not stated in the text."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha i mukua mai i te pae?","The correct answer is **C: He hukihuki kaupapahere**.

The passage states: ""Nā te hīrawerawe ā-hapori ngā mahi o nāianei hei tuhi hukihuki i tētahi kaupapa here e pā ana ki ngā kiko onioni mō te pae tukutuku kei reira ngā tini miriona pāpaho raihana-tuwhera."" This translates to: ""The community is now working to draft a memorandum of understanding regarding onion hubs for the platform where there are millions of open-source patents.""

A ""hukihuki kaupapahere"" (memorandum of understanding) is a formal document outlining an agreement. Therefore, option C is the most accurate.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e tautokohia e Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **C: Nga whakaaro o nga wāhine**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tōku tino whakaaro me kaua te wahine e whawhai. Koinei tōku whakapae."" This directly indicates that Amir Khan *disagrees* with women fighting, and therefore doesn't support *their thoughts* or *their right to fight*. The other options are things he *does* support or is connected to:

* **A: Tae atu ki nga kairiri wāhine i te nga Orimipia** - He supported British competitors at the 2012 Olympics.
* **B: Ngā tauwhāinga Peretania** -  He supported British competitors.
* **D: E hautū ana a Rāwāhi i te nga Orimipia** - This isn't mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the only option that represents something Amir Khan *doesn't* support is the thoughts/right of women to fight.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e tautokohia ana e Amir Khan ahakoa tōna whakaaro whaiaro?","The correct answer is **D: Ētahi atu toa hiriwa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tōku tino whakaaro me kaua te wahine e whawhai. Koinei tōku whakapae."" (My main belief is that a woman should not fight. This is my stance.)

Then it says: ""Ahakoa ana kōrero i kī ia māna e tautoko ngā kaiwhakataetae nō Peretānia hei ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao o te tau 2012 ka whakatūria ki Rānana."" (Although he said he supported the British contestants at the 2012 Olympics, it was revealed in Ranana.)

This indicates that while Amir Khan believes women shouldn't fight, he *did* support contestants at the 2012 Olympics. The passage doesn't specify *who* these contestants were, only that they were ""other winning athletes"" (Ētahi atu toa hiriwa).  Therefore, ""Other winning athletes"" is the best fit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā kairiri wahine (Female managers):**  The passage doesn't mention female managers at all.
* **B: Ko ana hoa whakataetae mai i nga Orimipia 2004 (His sparring partners from the 2004 Olympics):** The passage only mentions his stance on women fighting and his support for 2012 Olympians.
* **C: Ko ngā Orimipia 2012 (The 2012 Olympics):**  While he supported contestants at the 2012 Olympics, the passage doesn't directly state he supported the Olympics *themselves*. He supported the athletes participating.



"
No hea i mate ai a Pita Lenz?,"The correct answer is **C: I te hōhipera**.

The passage states: ""...ā, nāwai rā ka mate ia ki reira."" which translates to ""...and he died there."" The ""there"" refers to the hospital on the track.
"
Ko wai a Xavier Zaira?,"The correct answer is **D: He pīataata (Driver)**.

The passage states that Xavier Zayat was Pita Lenz's rival and that he took advantage of Lenz's crash. This implies he is also a race car driver. The passage also says he did not break the ""aitua"" (which seems to mean the rules or code of conduct), further suggesting he's involved in racing.
"
I roto i tehea āhuatanga ka whai hua ai te kaihaerere e manukanuka ana ki te mōhio ki te mahi o roto o te waka rererangi?,"The correct answer is **B: Mēnā he wehi ki te kore e mōhiotia te mea e kore ai rātou e pai ki te rere.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** People often fear flying even without a specific reason, often due to a lack of understanding of what's happening and feeling a lack of control.
* **Option B directly addresses this:** Understanding how an airplane works can alleviate the fear stemming from the unknown – the feeling of not knowing what's happening and potentially not being in control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ki te whakama te pāhihi i to rātau wehi:** This is incorrect. The passage says fear isn't necessarily about the plane itself, but about the unknown aspects of the flight.
* **C: Mehemea he kino te pāhihi ki ngā momo haerenga katoa:** The passage implies fear is specific to flying, not general travel.
* **D: Mēnā ko te āwangawanga i puta mai i ngā āhuatanga kino kāore e pā ana ki te rere:** The passage suggests fear can arise even from seemingly harmless unknowns related to the flight.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei me mahi i tētahi haere utu nui?","The correct answer is **A: Rapua ngā tuku a ngā kamupene haerenga maha** (Look for offers from many airlines).

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** Difficulty finding cheap flights without research and consistent pricing.  It suggests comparing prices across different airlines.
* **Option A directly addresses this:**  Checking multiple airlines is the best way to find the cheapest fare.
* **Option B (Puka hāngai tonu ki te waka rererangi -  Stick to one airline):** This is likely to limit your options and not guarantee the best price.
* **Option C (Whakataurite utu i waenga i ngā kamupene haere maha - Compare prices between many airlines):**  This is also a good strategy, and essentially means the same thing as Option A. However, Option A is more direct in stating the action to take.
* **Option D (Tirohia te paetukutuku a te waka rererangi - Check the airline's website):**  Checking the airline's website is *part* of the research, but not the complete solution to finding the cheapest fare. It's important to compare with other airlines.



Therefore, Option A is the most appropriate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text.  Option C is a good alternative, but A is more direct.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me aha ngā haere i te tuatahi kia haumaru ai i ngā utu rererangi tino pai rawa atu?","The correct answer is **A: Tirohia te paetukutuku a te waka rererangi.**

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""he pai te whakatairite i ngā putanga rapunga me te **titiro hoki ki te pae tukutuku ake a te kamupene waka rererangi i mua i te hoko tīkiti**.""  This translates to ""it's good to compare prices and **check the airline's own website before buying tickets**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whakatauritea ngā utu i waenganui i ngā kaiwhakawhiwhi rerekē:** While price comparison is generally good, the passage emphasizes checking the airline's direct website.
* **C: Tuhia tika mā te kamupene rererangi:** This isn't a preventative measure for finding the best price. It relates to the accuracy of the booking *after* you've already bought the ticket.
* **D: Tuhia tika ki tētahi kaihoko haerenga:** Booking through a travel agent doesn't guarantee the best price and can sometimes be more expensive. The passage advises going direct.



"
He aha te wā e hiahiatia ai he hoa ki te haere tahi ki te tuku?,"The correct answer is **A: Mēnā ka tukuna ngā taonga mā te waka rererangi**.

Here's why:

The text explains that when using air freight (waka rererangi), there's a requirement for a person to be present at the destination to handle the paperwork and customs clearance.  Option A directly reflects this condition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ina whakamahi te kamupene i ōna ake rererangi:**  The text doesn't specify that a person is *always* needed if a company uses its own planes.
* **C: Mēnā kei te tukuna ngā mea hei peke rehitatia:** While customs clearance is involved with registered shipments, the text doesn't explicitly link a person being required *only* to registered shipments.
* **D: Mēnā kei te whakahaerehia te tuku e tētahi kamupene nui ake:**  The text doesn't mention needing a person present if a larger company is managing the shipment.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate based on the provided text.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, i a koe e whiriwhiri ana i tētahi kamupene rererangi Frequent Flyer i roto i tētahi hononga, ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei e tika ana kia whakaūhia e koe?","The best answer is **A: Ko te kamupene rererangi e tuku ana i te nuinga o ngā tohu** (The airline that offers the most benefits).

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes comparing benefits.** The question states that even if you're loyal to an airline, benefits change and other airlines offer better deals.  Therefore, prioritizing the airline with the *most* benefits is key.
* **Other options are less relevant.**
    * **B: Ko te kamupene rererangi i roto i te hononga nui rawa atu** (The airline in the largest alliance) - Alliance membership *can* be a factor, but doesn't guarantee the best individual benefits.
    * **C: Ko te kamupene rererangi e haere pinepine ana koe** (The airline you fly most often) - Loyalty is good, but not if it means missing out on better perks.
    * **D: Ko te kamupene rererangi pea e tāpiri ana i ētahi atu mana motuhake** (The airline that might offer additional special perks) - While special perks are nice, they're secondary to the core benefits like upgrades, free baggage, and priority boarding.

Therefore, maximizing the *overall* benefits is the most important consideration when choosing an airline for a Frequent Flyer program.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko wai e tuku atu ana i ētahi atu frequent flyer?","The correct answer is **D: He kamupene rererangi rerekē i roto i te hononga kotahi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Me āta kōwhiri e koe tāu kamupene rerenga Frequent Flyer ki tētahi kotahitanga."" (You should choose your Frequent Flyer company to one alliance.) and ""...he rerekē tonu ngā painga ka hoatu, ā, ka ngāwari ake hoki ngā piro rere a ētahi kē atu kamupene rererangi."" (...the benefits offered will always be different, and other airlines' airfares will also decrease.)

This implies that different airlines *within the same alliance* will have different benefits and fares. Option D accurately reflects this.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ngā pūkenga e whai ake nei ka pāngia e te haurangi?","The correct answer is **A: Whakarongo (Hearing)**.

The passage states: ""Ka mate te ate i te inu waipiro, whāia mai hoki ka kāpō, **e hemo ai pea te tangata**...""  ""E hemo ai pea te tangata"" translates to ""the person may lose their life"" or ""the person may die"".  This directly relates to the sense of hearing (whakarongo), as the passage discusses the potential for death due to drinking contaminated water. The loss of life is a severe consequence directly impacting the ability to hear, experience, and interact with the world.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Tirohanga (Sight):** The passage doesn't directly mention anything about vision.
*   **C: Tāwara (Logic):** While there's a logical connection between drinking contaminated water and getting sick, the passage focuses on the physical impact rather than logical reasoning.
*   **D: Kakara (Taste):** The passage mentions the taste of water (""pā o te waipiro""), but the main danger isn't related to taste itself, but to the potential for poisoning that leads to death.



"
"E ai ki te kōrero i roto i te haerenga, he aha e taea ai te whakaiti i ngā pānga kino o te waipiro?","The correct answer is **C: Tīmata ana i te waipiro i runga i te ngāwari (Start drinking water slowly)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the effects of alcohol vary from person to person and depend on your tolerance. It also warns that drinking alcohol illegally can be dangerous due to potential contaminants. Therefore, **drinking slowly** is a key factor in mitigating the negative effects of alcohol.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tīmata ana i te waipiro ki te methanol (Start drinking water with methanol):** Methanol is a toxic substance and adding it to alcohol would *increase* the danger, not mitigate it.
*   **B: E inu ana i ngā wairua i hangaia noatia (Drink spirits made from fermented spirits):** This doesn't inherently reduce the negative effects. The type of alcohol matters less than the *amount* and *speed* of consumption.
*   **D: E inu ana me ngā tāngata rerekē (Drink with different people):**  Who you drink with doesn't affect the physiological effects of alcohol."
Kei whea ngā uara o ngā whare i waenganui i ngā uara o Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: Te Takiwā o Canal**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kei te tohua te takiwā katoa hei UNESCO World Heritage Site mō tana uara ahurea, hītori ahurei, ā, kei waenga i ngā mea teitei o te whenua ana uara whenua."" (The entire area is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site for its cultural value, historical significance, and its geographical location within the city.)
* The question asks *where* the cultural value is located.
* The passage directly identifies that location as ""Te Takiwā o Canal"" (Canal Belt).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: I roto i tētahi wāhi kua tohua hei wāhi tuku iho o te Ao UNESCO** (Within an area designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site) - While true, it's not specific enough. The question asks for the *area*.
* **C: Ngā wāhi i tangohia mai i te Binnenstad** (Areas taken from the Binnenstad) - This is incorrect. The Canal Belt *encompasses* the Binnenstad.
* **D: Ngā tauwāhi whai uara hītori** (Historically significant periods) -  This refers to time periods, not a physical location.



"
He aha i whakaingoatia ai te Takiwa o te Canal hei Taonga Taonga o te Ao a UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: He uara hītori, ahurea hoki** (It is a historical and cultural landscape).

The provided text states the area is designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site ""mō tana uara ahurea, hītori ahurei, ā, kei waenga i ngā mea teitei o te whenua ana uara whenua"" - *for its cultural landscape, ancient history, and its central location within the country's landscapes*.  Options B, C, and D are either incomplete or not directly supported by the text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e haere ana ki Phnom Krom whai painga?","The correct answer is **A: Te tirohanga i runga i a Tonle Sap**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko te āhua hiawe o te temepara me te tirohanga o runga i te roto Tonle Sap e hiahiatia ai te piki i te puke."" (The architecture of the temple and the view overlooking Lake Tonle Sap require climbing the hill.)

While the other options are related to Phnom Krom, the text specifically highlights the view *overlooking Lake Tonle Sap* as a key feature and benefit.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e hiahiatia ana kia tomo ngā manuhiri ki Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Kei te tiki i te Hipa Angkor**.

The text explicitly states: ""Me whiwhi i te Pāhi Angkor kia tomo i te temepara..."" which translates to ""You must obtain an Angkor Pass to enter the temple...""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e āhei ai te turuhi ki te haere ki Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: He tahua haere whānui (A wide range of journeys)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""He nui te utu mō ngā toronga tūruhi"" (Travel costs are high) and that the area is accessible ""ka taea anake te tū ki te raumati atu i te marama o Nōema ki Pēpuere"" (can only be visited during the summer months from November to February). It also mentions ""He haere tuawhenua ngā haerenga rere motuhake i ētahi wā ruarua, mō te eke maunga, te tae atu rānei ki te Tōpito o te Ao, kei reira tētahi wahi noho nui"" (Special air journeys sometimes go ashore, for mountaineering, even reaching the South Pole, where there is a large base).

This indicates that various types of journeys are possible, not just limited to a specific activity or time frame. Options B, C and D are too restrictive based on the information provided.



"
Ka toro atu te turuhi e hiahia ana ki te eke maunga ki tehea wahanga o Antarctica?,"The correct answer is **A: Te Moana o Ross**.

The text states: ""...ka taea anake te tū ki te raumati atu i te marama o Nōema ki Pēpuere, ā, ka mātua whakawhāititia ki te Peninsula, ngā Islands **me te Ross Sea**."" This indicates that the Ross Sea is a key location for supporting expeditions to climb mountains, including Mount Everest.
"
Kei whea te wāhi iti rawa o te tūnga o tētahi mātakitaki i mua i te wā o nāianei?,"The answer is **A: I tētahi tauwāhi ngāwari noa iho**.

Here's why:

The first paragraph discusses the preservation of old Māori meeting houses and how their construction reflects a time before modern, often large-scale, buildings. The context implies that in the past, meeting houses were built in simpler, less densely populated areas.  ""Tauwāhi ngāwari noa iho"" translates to ""in a simple, quiet place,"" which best reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: I te pokapū o te taone:** This suggests a central, bustling location, which is the opposite of what the paragraph describes.
* **C: Kei tētahi tauwāhi mamao:** ""Tauwāhi mamao"" means ""in a busy place,"" again not aligning with the paragraph's emphasis on simpler, less crowded environments.
* **D: I runga i tētahi whare kāreti:** This refers to a ""market building"" and doesn't relate to the typical location of a meeting house.

Kei whea te wāhi e tū ai tētahi pouaka whakaata rangahau hou?,"The correct answer is **B: I runga i tētahi whare wānanga (On a university campus)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te nuinga o ngā karu whātata rangahau hou kei ngā wāhi kōkēi me ngā āhuatanga kōhauhau pai"" which translates to ""Most new research laboratories are in well-equipped and modern locations.""

A university campus is the most likely place for a modern research laboratory to be situated. Options A, C, and D are less likely. While labs *could* be in museums or schools, universities are primary hubs for scientific research.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e kore e whakaarotia he tohutohu tika mō te whakatangitangi pai i te kōkiri?","The correct answer is **C: Kia mahara ki te tuki i nga tuhipoka i a ia e pupuri ana i tētahi ringa māhorahora.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kia maumahara kāore he take mō te pato i ngā patooro ki te tōpana nui mō te oro teitei ake pērā i tā te piano."" This means you shouldn't hit the keys with excessive force. Option C, ""Kia mahara ki te tuki i nga tuhipoka i a ia e pupuri ana i tētahi ringa māhorahora"" (Remember to follow instructions when holding a relaxed hand), directly relates to avoiding excessive force and maintaining a relaxed hand position, which is crucial for proper piano playing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mō tētahi atu rōrahi, whakanuia te tōpana i patua ai e koe ngā kī** (For another pianist, increase the force with which you strike the keys) - This is the *opposite* of what the passage advises.
*   **B: Puritia te nekeneke koretake ki te mōkito kia taea ai te pupuri i tō kaha** (Relax the fingers on the keys to maintain your strength) - While relaxation is important, the passage emphasizes controlling the force, not just relaxing the fingers.
*   **D: Whakanuia te tere o tō whakahaere i te pūkaha kia nui ake ai te rōrahi** (Increase the speed of your hand movements on the keyboard to make it easier) - Increasing speed isn't directly mentioned as a key aspect of proper technique in the passage, and it can actually lead to more force.



"
"I a koe e whakatangi ana i te kōkiri, ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei ka āwhina ki te whakanui ake i te reo?","The correct answer is **C: Pēhanga iti iho (Slightly less pressure)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kia maumahara kāore he take mō te pato i ngā patooro ki te tōpana nui mō te oro teitei ake pērā i tā te piano. Ki te kōriana, kia nui ake te kahaoro, ka whakamahia ngā pupuhi ki te pēhanga nui ake, te tere nui ake rānei.""

This translates to: ""Remember there's no need to strike the keys hard for a louder sound like a piano. When playing the keyboard, to increase the volume, use a *slightly less* pressure, a faster speed, etc.""

Therefore, using *slightly less pressure* is the key to achieving a louder sound.  The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

* **A: Tere anō (Still fast):** While speed can contribute, the focus is on pressure.
* **B: Tōpana anō (Still pressing down):**  The passage advises against pressing down harder.
* **D: He iti iho te nekeneke matimati (Less subtle movement):** Subtle movement isn't directly related to volume in this context.



"
He aha i tapahia ai ngā rohe o ngā whakaahua i runga i te pouaka whakaata?,"The correct answer is **A: Hei whakaae ki ngā taitararoto.** (To comply with the standards).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the standard practice for DVD manufacturing is to ensure the image covers the entire surface of the disc. This is done to meet industry standards and ensure playback on a wide range of DVD players.  The ""panoni rahi whakaahua"" (large image margin) is specifically to avoid issues where audio (like subtitles) near the edge of the disc would be cut off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nō reira ka whakakī te atahanga i te mata katoa** (So that the disc will cover the entire surface): While the result *is* that the disc covers the surface, the *reason* is to meet standards, not just to cover the surface.
* **C: Hei whakaae ki te tahuringa ngāwari ki ētahi atu hōputu** (To comply with gentle rotation to other components):  The image margin isn't related to the rotation of the disc or other components.
* **D: Hei tapahi i ngā taitararoto e tata rawa ana ki raro** (To comply with standards close to the bottom): While the text mentions subtitles close to the bottom, the overall reason for the large margin is to comply with general image standards, not just bottom-edge subtitles.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o ngā raruraru e whai ake nei ka kitea e te tangata ina hurihia he kiriata ki te hōputu DVD?","The correct answer is **A: He whakaahua kāore e whakakiia te mata katoa** (Not all images are displayed).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a common problem when creating a DVD is **panoni rahi whakaahua** (overscan). Overscan means that the edges of the image are cut off to fit the DVD format. This results in not all of the image being displayed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tapahia tētahi wāhanga o ngā taitararoto** (Some of the subtitles are cut off): While potential, the primary issue described is the loss of the entire image.
* **C: He atahanga e whakakī ana i te mata katoa** (A frame that fills the entire screen): The passage is about *loss* of image, not filling the screen.
* **D: Tapahia ngā taitapa** (Subtitles are cut off):  As mentioned above, subtitles *might* be cut off, but the core issue is the loss of the image itself due to overscan.



"
I hea tētahi Garrison Peretania?,"The correct answer is **A: Assunpink Creek**.

The passage states: ""General James Ewing te 700 marīhia whakawhiti i te awa ki Trenton Ferry, kātahi ka mau i te piriti ki te Assunpink Creek me te aukati i ngā ope hoariri i te pakiha atu."" This directly indicates the British Garrison was located at Assunpink Creek.
"
Ko wai te waitohu i puta mai i runga i te hukihuki tuhi ā-ringa?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text states: ""ka tukuna tētahi tuhinga hukihuki kua hainatia e te President of Congress a John Hancock rāua ko Secretary Charles Thompson ētahi poraka atu ki te toa tā a **John Dunlap**."" This translates to: ""a letter which had been signed by the President of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thompson was sent to the shop of **John Dunlap**.""  This indicates that John Dunlap was the printer who received the document.
"
"I roto i ngā wāhi e whai ake nei, ko tēhea te wāhi whakamutunga i tae mai ai tētahi waka a Dunlap?","The correct answer is **D: Hōro Rangatiratanga**.

The text states: ""Ko ngā Dunlap taha-whānui (Broadsides) e 25 e mōhiotia tonutia ana ko ngā tāruatanga tawhiti rawa e toe ana o te puka. Kāore te tuhinga tūturu ā-ringa i te toe tonu. Ko ngā Dunlap i tae he kape ki Rānana i te 10 o Akuhata.""

This translates to: ""The 25 Dunlap broadsides are now recognized as the farthest-reaching copies of the book. The original handwritten document does not remain. A copy of the Dunlap arrived in Philadelphia on October 10th.""

Philadelphia is the same as **Hōro Rangatiratanga** (Independence Hall).
"
I whea nga hōia a Kānara Stark e noho ana?,"The correct answer is **A: I te pito ki te raki, i te taha o te taiapa**.

The text states: ""Tū atu ā Stark tāngata ki te pahiko o te pito raki o te tūnga o te Colonist. I te kōara a te tai timu i tētahi āputa ki te taha o te Mystic River ki te raki mā rāwhiti o te raenga kūiti..."" This translates to: ""Stark's men went to the encampment on the northern side of the Colonist's position. When the tide came in one afternoon on the side of the Mystic River to the northwest of the inlet...""

Therefore, they were located on the northern side of the river.
"
"E ai ki te whārangi nei, nō whea i whakawhānui ai ngā tangata a Stark i tō rātou taiepa?","The correct answer is **B: I muri i te putanga o nga auau i te tūnga.**

The passage states: ""I te kōara a te tai timu i tētahi āputa ki te taha o te Mystic River ki te raki mā rāwhiti o te raenga kūiti, ka tere tā rātou whakaroa ake i te taiapa..."" This indicates that the soldiers extended their defenses *after* the ships were landed.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te karangatanga a nga Hoa Mahi ki nga āwhina:** The passage doesn't mention any association with ""Hoa Mahi"" (Comrades/Friends) or aid.
* **C: I te wa o te tai iti:** The passage refers to a ""tai timu"" (tidal wave), not a low tide.
* **D: Ahakoa i whakaaro nga hōia ki ngā tūnga whakamua:** While the passage notes the soldiers *considered* advanced positions, it doesn't say they extended their defenses *because* of those considerations. The extension happened after the ships were landed.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā wā e whai ake nei tētahi o ngā wā tino tutu o Haina?","The correct answer is **D: Ko nga rangatiratanga e toru (The Three Kingdoms)**.

The passage explicitly states that the Three Kingdoms period was a time of intense warfare and bloodshed, with many people dying vying for power. It also mentions that the Three Kingdoms period spanned 60 years between the Han and Jin Dynasties. Options A, B, and C are only part of the overall historical context; the Three Kingdoms period itself is identified as the most turbulent.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te pono o te whenua taua e tomo ana ki tētahi wāhanga nomadic?","The correct answer is **A: Ka kōhanga rātau i te pō**.

The passage states: ""I te wā o te tipi whenua, ka hīkoikoi ngā hōia pōpokorua i te pō ka tū ai ki te noho tōpuni i te awatea."" This translates to ""At the time of the hunt, the kangaroo warriors would hide at night and stand in a settlement at dawn.""  Therefore, option A is the most accurate statement based on the text.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He iti noa iho ta rātau kai:** The passage doesn't mention the amount of food they had.
* **C: Ka mahia e rātau he kōhanga kua hurihia i muri i te 17 rā:**  While the settlements are temporary (17 days), the passage doesn't say they *rotate* or move to a new settlement after 17 days.
* **D: E hīkoi ana rātau i te rā:** The passage says they *hide* at night, not that they travel during the day.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea kōrero e whakaatu tika ana i nga tikanga kōhanga o nga whenua taua i te wā o te wāhanga nomadic?","The correct answer is **A: E hanga ana rātau i ngā kōhanga i te pō**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I te wā o te tipi whenua, ka hīkoikoi ngā hōia pōpokorua i te pō ka tū ai ki te noho tōpuni i te awatea. I tēnei wā, ka hangaia e te huinga ngā kōhanga taupua ka panonitia ia rā."" (During the time of the seasonal migration, the hunting parties would encamp at night and settle in a temporary settlement at dawn. At this time, the group would build temporary settlements and stay there.)

This directly supports option A, which says they *build* settlements at night.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: E haere ana rātau mo te 17 rā, kaore he kōhanga:**  While they migrate for 17 days, the text says they *build* a settlement, not that they don't have one.
* **C: Ka hurihia e rātau ngā kōhanga ia rā:** The text doesn't mention moving settlements during the day.
* **D: Ka whakamahia e rātau ngā kōhanga ōrite mo te roanga o te wāhanga:** The text refers to building *new* settlements each time.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka haere tonu ahakoa ngā tohu o waho?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā karaka koiora (Biological rhythms)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ngā karaka koiora he mea ngapu kei te tautīnei i a rātou anō ka haere tonu te wā o te huringa rere noa ahakoa kei te ngaro ngā tohu nō waho."" This translates to ""Biological rhythms are innate and regulate themselves, and the cycle of change continues even when external cues are lost.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā huringa mutungakore (Circadian rhythms):** While circadian rhythms *are* biological rhythms, the passage emphasizes that they continue *even when external cues are lost*. Circadian rhythms rely on external cues (like sunlight) to a degree, so they wouldn't necessarily continue indefinitely without them.
* **B: Ngā rangi auau (Weather patterns):** Weather patterns are external cues, not internal rhythms. They change and are not constant.
* **D: Ngā rangi i kitea (Observed seasons):** Observed seasons are based on the Earth's position relative to the sun. They are external and change over time.



"
He aha te kupu e whakaahua ana i ngā tāngata e whakaatu ana i ngā rerekētanga o tētahi āhuatanga phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** means having multiple forms or varieties. The question describes a situation where individuals within a population exhibit different forms of a particular trait. This aligns directly with the definition of polymorphism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:** This means having only one form. This is the opposite of what the question describes.
* **Ngā Rauropi (Species):** This refers to distinct species, not variations within a species.
* **Nga momo (Types):** This is too general and doesn't specifically address the variation in a single trait.

Therefore, **Polymorphic** is the only term that accurately describes individuals displaying different forms of a phenotypic trait."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kupu e tika ana mō ngā rauropi e noho ana i tētahi wāhi motuhake?,"The correct answer is **A: Monomorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Monomorphic** means having only one form or type. The question describes a population where all individuals are essentially the same, fitting into a single category based on a shared characteristic. This directly aligns with the definition of monomorphic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Iwi Whānui** means ""large group"" or ""tribe."" While related to population size, it doesn't describe the similarity of individuals.
* **Nga momo** means ""kinds"" or ""types."" This is too general and doesn't capture the idea of a uniform population.
* **Polymorphic** means having two or more distinct forms or types. This is the *opposite* of what the question describes.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ehara i te tauira o tētahi mahi tūruhi e hāngai ana ki te taiao?,"The correct answer is **B: whakaahua i ngā kaimāori (Photographing Māori)**.

Here's why:

The question asks which option is *not* an example of a conservation-focused activity related to Māori environments. The provided options all relate to observing, documenting, and learning about nature and the environment.

*   **A: E tatari ana ki te mate wai (Monitoring water quality)** is directly related to environmental health.
*   **C: Haere ana ki tētahi whare taonga pūtaiao (Visiting a natural history museum)** involves learning about and appreciating the natural world.
*   **D: Rere hī ika (Fishing)** *can* be a sustainable activity when done responsibly and with respect for the environment and local regulations, and can be part of learning about marine ecosystems.

However, **B: whakaahua i ngā kaimāori (Photographing Māori)**, while potentially documenting a culture *connected* to the environment, isn't inherently a conservation *activity* itself. It focuses on people rather than the environment directly.  It's possible photography could *support* conservation efforts, but the act of photographing people isn't conservation work.

Therefore, it's the least relevant option to the theme of conservation-focused travel.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te take o te pūnaha waka?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā motokā tūmataiti (harness boats)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...kua tautoko hoki te katoa i tētahi pūnaho kawenga e hāngai ana ki ngā waka tūmatawhāiti"" which translates to ""...everything has supported a transport system suitable for harness boats.""

Therefore, the transport system is designed for and relies on harness boats.
"
He aha te momo utu o ngā matūriki e karapoti ana i te karihi?,"The correct answer is **A: Utu tōrunga**.

The passage states: ""Tōrunga te whana hiko tō te iraoho, ā, karekau he whana tō te iramoe."" This translates to ""The electron has a proper electrical affinity, and the proton has no affinity.""  ""Whana hiko tōrunga"" means ""proper electrical affinity"" or ""proper electrical charge.""

Therefore, the electrons orbiting the nucleus experience a proper electrical charge, which is the type of charge that causes them to be held in orbit.
"
Ko tehea matūriki te tito o te karihi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā Protons, ngā neutron, me ngā irahiko (Protons, neutrons, and electrons)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te karihi e rua ngā pūtūmua - ngā iramoe me ngā iraoho.""  This translates to ""The nucleus has two precursors - protons and neutrons.""  It also mentions the existence of electrons (""e āmiohia ana e ngā irahiko"" -  are orbited by electrons).

Therefore, the nucleus of an atom is composed of protons and neutrons, and electrons orbit the nucleus.  Option D is the only one that correctly lists all three components of an atom.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tauira o tētahi tau taurangi e rima ngā moka?","The question asks for a 5-bit binary number. A 5-bit binary number means it needs to have 5 digits, each being either 0 or 1. Let's examine each option:

*   **A: 1010** - This is a 4-bit binary number.
*   **B: 12001** - This is not a binary number because it contains the digit '2'.
*   **C: 10010** - This is a 5-bit binary number.
*   **D: 110101** - This is a 6-bit binary number.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 10010**.



"
He aha hoki te ingoa o ngā mati taurangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Moka**.

The text explicitly states: ""ka taea anake e tētahi tau tāhūrua te whai i tētahi o ngā uara e rua, arā te 0, te 1 rānei, ā, e kīia ana ēnei tau hei **mati tāhūrua** - hei moka ranei"". This directly translates to ""a binary digit can only take on one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these digits are called **binary digits** - or bits"".  ""Moka"" is the Māori word for ""bit"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uara** - This means ""number"" in Māori, which is too general.
*   **C: Jargon** - This refers to specialized language, not a specific term for binary digits.
*   **D: Ngā Puka** - This means ""books"" in Māori, completely irrelevant to the topic.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei painga matua o te rangitaki ākonga?,"The correct answer is **B: He hekenga o te whakahē a nga hoa noho (A struggle of classmates)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the struggle of classmates (""ko ngā ākonga te minenga tino whakahē"") motivates the teacher to improve writing to avoid frustration. However, the passage focuses on how the teacher uses writing to help students gain awareness of the world and develop critical thinking skills, collaboration, and a desire for lifelong learning. It doesn't highlight classmates struggling as a primary benefit of the writing process itself.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: He whakapai ake i te āheitanga wetereo me te tuhituhi (Improved writing skills):** This is a core focus; the teacher improves writing to address student struggles.
*   **C: He mōhiotanga whakawhānui ki ngā karapoti (Broader awareness of texts):** The passage states the writing process helps students understand how others approach writing and develop their own perspectives.
*   **D: He nui ake te hiahia mo te ako haere tonu (Increased desire for lifelong learning):** The passage mentions that writing fosters collaboration and a desire for continuous learning.

Therefore, the struggle of classmates is not presented as a key benefit of the writing process as described in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei o te rangitaki e whakahuatia ana hei akiaki mō ngā ākonga ki te whakapai ake i ō rātou pūkenga tuhituhi?,"The correct answer is **B: Te tohe kia karo i te whakahē.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ahakoa ngā hapa, ka rerekē haere tēnei āhuatanga i te hunga pānui. Nā te mea he nui te wā ko ngā ākonga te minenga tino whakahē, ka tīmata te kaituhi rangitaki ki te whai kia whakapai ake i te tuhinga hei karo i te whakahēnga."" (Even with mistakes, this aspect differs from published writers. Because students are often shy, the teacher starts to improve the writing to avoid shyness.)

This directly links the teacher's role in helping students avoid shyness to improving their writing. While other options touch on aspects of good writing, avoiding shyness (and therefore, avoiding errors) is the most directly and explicitly stated purpose of the teacher's role in the text.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai hua ana i te whakawhitiwhiti kōrero asynchronous mō ngā ākonga? ,"The correct answer is **D: Mana Pace**.

Here's why:

* **Asynchronous communication** (like email or forums) allows for learning and interaction to happen at different times.  ""Mana Pace"" directly refers to allowing students to progress and learn at their own pace, which aligns perfectly with the benefits described in the original text about asynchronous communication.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ko te whakamahinga o te ipurangi hei rauemi (Using online resources):** While online resources *can* be used with asynchronous communication, it's not the core benefit highlighted in the text.  The text focuses on the *timing* of communication.
* **B: Te uru kanohi ki te kanohu ki ngā kaiako i ngā wā katoa o te rā (Face-to-face interaction with teachers at all times):**  This is the opposite of asynchronous communication, which allows for interaction outside of scheduled class times.
* **C: Ngā hāora mahi ngāwari (Flexible work hours):** While flexible work hours can be beneficial, they don't directly relate to the advantages of asynchronous *communication* itself.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā aronga e whai ake nei o te whakawhitiwhitinga whakarihariha ehara i te mea māmā mō ngā ākonga?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā haora mahi (Work hours)**.

The passage states that ""he iti iho ngā here wā me te āheinga o te mahi i ngā hāora ā-mahi nekeneke"" which translates to ""there are few time constraints and deadlines for the work during flexible work hours."" This indicates that flexible work hours are *not* a challenge for students, but rather an advantage.

The passage highlights that the use of email and online forums allows students to have more time to think and ask questions outside of traditional work hours. Therefore, traditional work hours are presented as something that is *not* a significant obstacle. The other options (Tere ako/Learning tasks, Rauemi tohutohu/Reference resources, Whakamahinga Ipurangi/Use of email) are all framed as ways to *support* students and make the process easier.
"
He aha te mea e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te whiti hei mea ka taea e te tangata te hono atu ki nga whare rangatira o mua?,"The correct answer is **C: Chivalry**.

Here's why:

The first passage discusses the awe and imagination evoked by ancient castles, referencing tournaments, feasts, and Arthurian design. It mentions the echoes of battles and the sounds of conflict. The question then asks what *wasn't* mentioned as a way people connected to these castles.

* **A: Ngā rua Dungeon (Dungeon cells):** The passage explicitly mentions the ""mataku e whanake haere ana i ngā rua poka"" (fear growing in the dungeons).
* **B: Ngā Jousts (Jousts):** The passage mentions ""ngā whakataetae"" (tournaments), which would include jousts.
* **C: Chivalry:** While tournaments are mentioned, the broader concept of chivalry – the code of conduct for knights – isn't directly mentioned as a *connection* to the castles themselves in the passage. The passage focuses more on the physical environment and the echoes of past events.
* **D: Ngā Kōroa (Battles):** The passage explicitly mentions ""ngā rongo o ngā pakanga"" (rumors of battles).

Therefore, chivalry is the most accurate answer because it's a key element of the cultural context surrounding castles, but the passage doesn't directly link it as a way people *connected* to them in the same way it connected them to the physical environment and events.



"
"Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei kakara, he haruru rānei e taea ana te whakahuatia i waenganui i ngā parekura o te whare?","The correct answer is **D: Hooves**.

Here's why:

The first paragraph discusses the impressions of history evoked by ancient ruins – battles, feasts, Arthurian design, sounds of conflict, and the feeling of the past in the stones. 

The question asks which of the options *isn't* mentioned as being able to be heard/felt in the ruins.  ""Hooves"" (the feet of animals) doesn't fit with the imagery of sounds of battle, feasts, or the atmosphere of ancient structures. The other options – Battles, Fear, and Feasts – *are* mentioned or strongly implied in the paragraph.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he whakaahuatanga tika o Kirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: I hiahiatia he iti rawa te taiepa na te āhua rangimarie o te whenua i te wā i hangaia ai.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""I te tekau tau 1480, i te tīmatanga mai o tōna hanganga e Lord Hastings, he āhua maungārongo ki te whenua, ā, ka hiahiatia anake te whakawawao ki ngā rōpū iti o te hunga konihi e hāereere ana.""  This translates to: ""In the decade of 1480, at the beginning of its construction by Lord Hastings, the land was peaceful, and only a defense was needed against small groups of wandering bandits.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I tonoa nga pakitara mātotoru o te kōrere e te Lord Hastings** - The passage doesn't mention the number of towers.
* **C: Ehara te hanganga o te maka i te mea noa iho mo te wā kotahi** - The passage doesn't say the castle's construction was for a single purpose or over a long time.
* **D: I hangaia hei tautoko i ngā whakaekenga roa, whakatau hoki** - While castles *could* be used for defense, the passage emphasizes the peaceful conditions at the time of construction, suggesting a need for *limited* defense, not extensive fortifications for long-term conflicts.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga hanga e whai ake nei e kiia ana ehara i te tikanga mo Kirby Muxloe Castle i te wā e whakaahuatia ana i te wāhanga?,"The correct answer is **B: He tūranga i hangaia hai tautoko i ngā whakaekenga** (It was built as a stronghold to support the executions).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kaore e tino roa ka kore ngā matapihi nunui me ōna pakitara e taea te karo i te tomokanga mai."" (It was not long before the large ramparts and its towers could not escape siege). This indicates it was a fortified structure designed for defense, *not* specifically for executions. The passage mentions ""ngā rōpū iti o te hunga konihi e hāereere ana"" (small groups of rebels) being subdued there, further reinforcing its role as a defensive structure.

The other options are mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Ngā matapihi nui (Large ramparts):** The passage specifically mentions these.
*   **C: He iti iho te whakawhāititanga i ētahi pātiki (Few embellishments on some turrets):** The passage mentions towers and turrets.
*   **D: pakitara angiangi (Arrow slits):** The passage mentions towers and turrets.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te tino whai painga mo te kaioma e takatū ana mo te wā e tū mai nei?","The correct answer is **A: Te whakangungu i te rere whenua i te raumati (Summer running training)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P runga i te panoni atu i te omanga hauwhā maero ki te haurua, ka iti iho te hiranga o te tere..."" (After the decline in training during the winter, speed performance is reduced...).  It then says ""...ngā oma roa hei te wā o te takurua me te mahi pītakataka mō runga ake o te tinana, koinei ngā huarahi pai ki te whakatika mō ngā wā o te oma."" (...long runs in the spring and upper body strength training are the best ways to make up for the winter period).

Therefore, the passage indicates that long runs (running training) in the spring are the best way to improve performance after a period of reduced training. Option A directly reflects this.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te arotahi ki te whakawhanake i te tere i te wā e whakangungu ana (Focusing on developing speed during training)** - The passage states speed is *reduced* after winter training.
*   **C: patupatu i te toru meneti (Three-minute intervals)** - This isn't mentioned in the passage as a solution.
*   **D: E whakamahi ana i te whare tākaro ki te mahi i te tinana o runga (Using the gym to work the upper body)** - While upper body strength training is mentioned, long runs are specifically highlighted as a key recovery method.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tino hiranga mo te kaioma haurua maero tuatahi?","The correct answer is **C: E karaka ana i raro i te rua meneti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tātou taumata-tuatahi hāwhe-mira, he tāne e āhei te pīti i te rua miniti, kāore e kore he mōhio ki te tere..."" This directly translates to: ""Our first two-level threshold, a man who can handle the plunge in two minutes, is not unaware of the speed..."" This implies the ability to manage/handle a two-minute plunge is the key for a first-time spring-diving beginner.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te whakahaere i te rere whenua i ngā marama o te hotoke (Managing the ground rush in the spring months):** This is not explicitly mentioned as the best practice for a *first-time* spring diver.
* **B: E whakaputa ana i te manawanui i runga i te tere (Generating confidence based on speed):**  The passage actually says the beginner should *not* be overly concerned with the speed at first (""kāore e kore he mōhio ki te tere"").
* **D: Tere whakaputa i runga i te manawanui (Speed generated based on confidence):** The passage states the beginner is *not* fully aware of the speed (""kāore e kore he mōhio ki te tere"").



"
"Mo te kaitākaro, ko tehea o ēnei e kore e taea te whakatutuki mā te kai anake?","The correct answer is **C: Mahinga Elite (Elite Performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while proper nutrition is *good* for overall health, it's not *enough* for elite performance. The passage emphasizes that consistent healthy habits *along with understanding the body's response to exercise* are needed to maximize athletic potential.  ""Mahinga elite"" implies reaching the highest level of performance, which requires more than just nutrition; it requires training, genetics, and often other factors not mentioned in the passage.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mahinga pai ake (Improved Performance):** Nutrition *does* contribute to improved performance.
*   **B: Te nui ake o te hākinakina (Greater Exercise Capacity):**  Proper nutrition supports increased exercise capacity.
*   **D: Poka Ahuwhānui (Broad Range):** Nutrition supports a broad range of physical activities.

"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei e kore e tūtohutia hei huarahi kia nui ake ai te ahuareka o ngā kaitākaro taitamariki i a rātau hākinakina?","The correct answer is **B: E tika ana te mahi i tētahi taumata rangatira (It's important to work at a leadership level)**.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the importance of *proper nutrition* and *hydration* for athletes' performance. It also mentions understanding physiological changes to optimize training and recovery.

* **Option B** (working at a leadership level) is not directly related to nutrition, hydration, or understanding physiological changes. While leadership can be beneficial in a team sport, the passage focuses on individual athlete needs related to their physical well-being.

* **Options A, C, and D** all align with the passage's points:
    * **A: Kei te whakamātau i te kai tika (Testing proper nutrition)** is directly mentioned as crucial.
    * **C: He pai te whakamakuku (It's good to rest)** is related to recovery and understanding physiological changes.
    * **D: Kei te pupuri i tētahi toenga pūngao hauora (Maintaining a healthy lifestyle)** is a broader concept that encompasses proper nutrition and hydration.



Therefore, the statement that *doesn't* align with the passage's focus on athlete performance through physical well-being is working at a leadership level.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea ka hokona e tētahi kaioma tawhiti he taonga utu nui ake?","The correct answer is **A: Ko tō rātou manakohanga whaiaro tēnei (Their mental habits are like this)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that while long-distance travel is expensive, the cost of the tools is not a major concern.  They buy tools ""when they need them, but most don't care much about the work."" 
* The final sentence says some leaders think they'd be better off with a different tool *even if its benefits aren't clearly seen*.  This implies their decision-making is driven by a mental habit, a tendency to prioritize something else (perhaps prestige, novelty, or a perceived advantage) over practical cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kua kitea e ia ngā painga (They have seen the benefits):** The paragraph says they don't *care much* about the work, suggesting they haven't thoroughly evaluated the benefits.
* **C: Ka tino pā ki ta rātau mahinga (They care a lot about their work):** The paragraph states they *don't* care much about the work itself, despite the expense.
* **D: He whakaaro hē e pā ana ki ngā taputapu iti iho te utu (There's a mistaken thought about the cost of the smaller tools):** While there might be a slight misunderstanding of the cost, the core issue is more about the mental habit of prioritizing something else.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te hiahia o te rere tawhiti o waenganui?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā taputapu iti rawa (Small tools)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He iti noa te utu o te oma tawhiti, heoi, he nui ngā heitara mō ngā taputapu iti nei ka whakamahia mō tēnei mahi."" (Long-distance shipping is not very expensive, however, the costs for these small tools used for the job are high.)

This indicates the core issue is the cost of *small tools*. The other options aren't directly supported by the text. While the cost of tools might contribute to the overall expense, the passage specifically highlights the high cost of *small tools*.



"
Na wai i kite i te whakaata autō ngota? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch me te Purcell**.

The passage states: ""E hāngai ana te MRI ki te kaupapa ahupūngao e kīa ana ko te karihi aukume whāorooro, i tūhuratia e Felix Bloch (i te mahi ki Te Whare Wānanga o Stanford) me Edward Purcell (nō Te Whare Wānanga o Harvard) i ngā tau 1930."" This directly tells us that Bloch and Purcell discovered the principle of nuclear magnetic resonance, which is the basis for MRI.
"
He aha te tau i tukuna ai te ārai tuatahi mo te whakahoki atahanga rongoā? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The text states: ""I te tau 1970, i hurangia e te tākuta rongoā me te kairangahau pūtaiao, e Raymond Damadian te paparahi mō te whakamahinga o te whakaahuatanga pākuru aukume hei rauemi whakatau māuiui. E whā tau ki muri ka tukuna tētahi raihana motuhake, koirā te raihana motuhake tuatahi o te ao i tukuna ki te mātai MRI. I te tau 1977, i whakaoti a Dr. Damadian i te hanganga o te matawai MRI """"tinana-katoa"""" tuatahi, i tapaina e ia ko te """"Indomitable"""".""

This clearly indicates the patent was granted in 1977.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tikanga kia kaha te mōhiotanga o te tangata kia whakamārama ai i nga mahi ōkiko a ētahi atu?","The correct answer is **D: Whakaarotanga (Empathy)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Ko te tangata te momo tino iho pumanawa rawa i te mōhio ki ngā whakaaro o ētahi atu"" which translates to ""Humans are particularly endowed with the ability to understand the thoughts of others.""
* It then connects this understanding to the ability to understand others' feelings like ""kite"" (seeing), ""takune"" (feeling), ""whakapono"" (believing), ""mōhio"" (knowing), and ""hiahia"" (wanting) - all aspects of emotional understanding.
* The passage highlights that empathy (""mārama ki te takunetanga o ētahi atu"" - being aware of the feelings of others) is crucial for understanding actions.
* The example about the canoe illustrates how empathy leads to adjusting one's interpretation of someone's actions based on their potential emotional state.

Therefore, the passage emphasizes the importance of **whakaarotanga (empathy)** in interpreting the actions of others.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka āwhina te whakaaro mātauranga i te tangata ki te mahi i te aha?","The correct answer is **A: Whakakorea te kore mōhio i muri i ngā mahi ā-tinana.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to understand the thoughts of others helps us interpret their actions. This interpretation helps us understand *why* they are doing something, essentially filling in the gaps where we lack information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā hiahia matapae:** While understanding others can help understand needs, the passage focuses on understanding *thoughts*, not necessarily needs directly.
* **C: Tirohia ētahi atu tangata me te kore whakawā:** The passage explicitly states that understanding the *thoughts* of others allows us to *interpret* their actions, which *does* involve some level of interpretation (and thus, not necessarily ""without guesswork"").
* **D: Pānuitia nga hinengaro o ētahi atu:** The passage discusses *understanding* the thoughts of others, not *broadcasting* them.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he whakarāpopoto tika o te take matua o AI?","The correct answer is **A: Whakarite**.

Here's why:

The passage states that AI is about ""the testing of behaviors, learning, and the reproduction at the level of thought in a machine.""  ""Whakarite"" (testing) best encapsulates this core idea of evaluating and refining AI's abilities to mimic human thought and behavior.

Here's why the other options are not the best fit:

* **B: Āhukahuka reo (Natural Language Processing):**  While mentioned as one capability, it's *a type* of AI functionality, not the overarching *take matua* (main point).
* **C: Kei te whakarite (Scheduling):** This is an application of AI, but not the fundamental concept itself.
* **D: Aunoatanga tūmahi (Autonomous Operation):**  While AI can be autonomous, the passage doesn't primarily focus on that aspect. It focuses on the *process* of creating AI with intelligent behaviors.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e pāhono ana ki te AI?","The correct answer is **A: Ratonga kiritaki (Customer service)**.

The text explicitly mentions that AI is used for:

*   ""te āheinga ki te whakahoki i ngā whakatau me ngā pātai a ngā kiritaki"" (responding to the decisions and questions of customers).

This directly relates to customer service. While other options might be indirectly related, customer service is the most directly stated application of AI in the provided text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he kaha o tētahi tangata whai tauira whakaaro ūngutu?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā tauira Memorizing (Memorizing models)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people with this type of thinking are ""whakakaupapa ōna"" (systematic), ""e taea nei te maumahara ki ngā tauira"" (can remember models), and ""whakatika hapa me te mahi i ngā whakamātautau pūtaiao"" (correct errors and perform scientific experiments).  This directly relates to the ability to memorize and apply models learned from past experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Te tautuhi i ngā whakautu tika maha ki tētahi raruraru (Identifying multiple correct answers to a problem):** The passage clearly states that only *one* correct answer is sought.
*   **B: Te whakamahi i ngā tikanga hou ki tētahi raruraru (Using new methods for a problem):** The passage focuses on a systematic, model-based approach, not necessarily on novel methods.
*   **C: Te whai wā ki te whakaoti i ngā raruraru (Spending time to solve problems):** While systematic thinking might *require* time, the passage doesn't highlight time as a key characteristic.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o nga mea e whai ake nei kare e kiia ko te aronga o te whakaaro huritao?","The correct answer is **C: Kei te tāutu i ngā take**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the goal of analytical thinking is speed, systematicity, and accuracy, *and* to identify fallacies and align with current practices.  Crucially, it also says ""kotahi noa te whakautu tika"" - meaning there is only *one* correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E mōhio ana he kotahi anake te whakautu tika (There is only one correct answer)** - This is *true* of analytical thinking, not what it *is*. It's a characteristic, not a goal.
* **B: Kei te mau i te wā kotahi (Holding in one time)** - This doesn't relate to analytical thinking.
* **D: Kohikohi ana i te mōhiohio (Dwelling in ignorance)** - This is the *opposite* of what analytical thinking aims to achieve. It seeks clarity and knowledge.

Analytical thinking is about *resolving* issues (taking aim at the causes), not simply holding onto them. Therefore, option C is the only one that doesn't describe the goal of analytical thinking as defined in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e whakaarotia he pēhi moroiti?","The correct answer is **C: Tere te hononga (Straightforward connection)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that recognizing subtle facial movements can indicate if someone is accurately interpreting emotions. The key point is that even people who *don't* understand the intellectual concept of a condition (like aphasia) can still understand the emotional state of someone exhibiting appropriate facial expressions.  This suggests that interpreting emotions isn't always a straightforward, logical connection.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kei te kōrero atu a Glancing i a ia e kōrero ana (Glancing is talking about him talking):** This isn't directly related to the core idea of the passage.
* **B: E whakangao ana i te rae (Is building a wall):** This implies a clear, understandable action, which the passage argues isn't always the case.
* **D: Kei te tuku kōnui (Is giving a hug):**  While a hug is a physical action, it doesn't necessarily represent a *straightforward* connection to understanding emotions, especially if the person giving it isn't expressing emotion genuinely.

Therefore, ""Tere te hononga"" (Straightforward connection) is the opposite of what the passage is trying to convey.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te whakamāramatanga pēhi moroiti ehara i te tika?,"The incorrect statement is **D: Ka taea te āwhina ki te aromatawai i te pono (It can help to determine the truth).**

Here's why:

The passage focuses on using facial expressions to *understand* emotions and intentions, not to determine if someone is *telling the truth*. While facial expressions *can* be misleading, the passage's main point is about accessing underlying feelings, even if someone isn't consciously aware of them.  The passage specifically mentions Sacks' example of people not recognizing they have aphasia yet still understanding emotions.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Nā ngā hopukanga ataata i puta ai ki ngā kōkiri nui (Video recordings have emerged for major investigations):** The passage starts by stating that video recordings are now used to investigate the understanding of subtle facial movements.
* **B: Ka kitea pea e te whakamāramatanga tika te teka (Accurate understanding can be gleaned from the process):** The passage implies that analyzing facial expressions *can* provide insight into someone's emotional state and ability to understand situations.
* **C: Ka whakamāramatia te kōrero me ngā kīanga kanohi (The speech and facial expressions are clarified):** The passage explicitly mentions that facial expressions can help clarify understanding of speech and emotions.



Therefore, **D** is the one that doesn't align with the central theme of the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei mea e whai ake nei i tino hira i te mutunga o te Renaissance? ,"The correct answer is **C: auporo kuputuhi (printed books)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ko te ngako, nā te Renaissance tētahi panoni hira ki te aronga ki te ako, me te hōrapa o te mātauranga."" (Printing was a great innovation during the Renaissance, and the spread of knowledge.)

The key innovation that facilitated the spread of knowledge during the Renaissance was the invention and widespread use of the printing press, which allowed for the mass production of **printed books**. This dramatically increased access to information compared to handwritten manuscripts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **auporo takitahi (oral tradition):** The text explicitly says the shift was *away* from oral tradition.
*   **E whakaputa ana i te mātauranga (producing knowledge):** While the Renaissance fostered the *production* of knowledge, the question asks what innovation spread it.
*   **Kei te whiwhi mōhiohio (gaining wisdom):**  The printing press enabled *access* to information, which could lead to wisdom, but it wasn't directly about gaining wisdom itself.



"
"I te mutunga o te Renaissance, he iti ake te arotahi ki tehea o ngā mea e whai ake nei?","The correct answer is **C: auporo kuputuhi (printed books)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The Renaissance was a turning point in the pursuit of knowledge and learning, a shift from the oral tradition of knowledge acquisition. The reliance on memory in the individual was replaced by a greater emphasis on the words themselves. The printing press, during the Renaissance, was a pivotal invention that facilitated the dissemination of knowledge and the spread of learning.""

Therefore, the printing press (auporo kuputuhi) was a key development that followed the Renaissance, making knowledge more accessible. The other options are not directly linked to the passage's description of the Renaissance's impact on learning:

*   **Auporo takitahi (oral tradition):** The passage explicitly states the Renaissance shifted *away* from the oral tradition.
*   **Kei te whiwhi i te mātauranga (acquiring knowledge):**  The Renaissance *increased* the ability to acquire knowledge, it didn't lessen the focus on it.
*   **Tuaritanga o te mōhiohio (rationalism):** While rationalism grew in importance during the Renaissance, the passage doesn't directly connect the *end* of the Renaissance to a decrease in rationalism.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kore e whakaatu i te kaupapa ki te whakamahi i te ipurangi mō te haere tonu o ngā hononga?,"The answer is **A: Whatunga pakihi (Business Meetings)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how online platforms are used to facilitate communication and relationships, specifically mentioning:

*   **Learning and Support:** Using platforms for educational purposes and providing assistance.
*   **Individualized Communication and Social Connection:** Facilitating one-on-one communication and building relationships.

Let's analyze the options:

*   **A: Whatunga pakihi (Business Meetings):** While business meetings *can* be held online, the passage doesn't specifically highlight online platforms as a *key* driver of continued connection for business. It's a possible application but not directly addressed as a primary use case related to maintaining relationships.
*   **B: Kei te whakapā tonu ki te whānau (Staying in touch with family):** This aligns perfectly with the concepts of relationship building and maintaining connection mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Haere rangahau (Going on research):** Online platforms *could* be used for research collaboration and staying connected with research partners.
*   **D: Hui i ngā tāngata hōu (Meeting new people):** Online platforms can facilitate meeting new people through online communities, forums, or networking sites.

Therefore, ""Whatunga pakihi"" is the least directly supported by the passage's focus on online platforms maintaining ongoing connections."
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore e whakaatu i te kaupapa ki te whakamahi i te ipurangi mō te whai wāhi whaiaro?,"The correct answer is **C: Rangahau ana i ngā hua rongoā**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how the internet is used for **cognitive engagement** (whai wāhi whaiaro). It mentions things like:

* **Learning and Support:** The ""ako"" (learning) and ""pāhekoheko"" (support) elements are highlighted as features for using the internet for learning.
* **Individualized Input & Social Interaction:**  These are presented as new ways to engage with the internet, especially in online communities.

Options A, B, and D all relate to activities that *could* be done online and therefore *could* be related to cognitive engagement:

* **Tirohia ana he tohutohu (Looking for instructions):**  This could be for learning a new skill or understanding a concept.
* **Tuku ana i runga i tētahi papa matapakinga tuihono (Posting on a networked bulletin board):** This is directly related to social interaction and knowledge sharing.
* **Whakahaere moni ana (Managing money):** While not directly cognitive engagement, it requires decision-making and problem-solving.

**Rangahau ana i ngā hua rongoā (Researching medicinal products)** is a valid online activity, but it's primarily focused on **health and well-being**, not directly on **cognitive engagement** or learning.  It doesn't fit the theme of the passage.



"
"Nō whea i mutu ai te whakawhirinaki nui o Ūropi ki ngā pānga, a, ka tīmata te whakawhanake i tōna ake kāhua?","The correct answer is **A: Puta noa i te mutunga o ngā Pakeke o Waenganui**.

The passage states: ""i tīmata a Ūropi ki te uru te whakawhanake i tā rātou ake huatau. ko tētahi o ngā whanaketanga nui rawa o te wā i hua mai i ngā ekenga ka tīmata ngā tāngata ki te whakamahi pātene hei whakamau kākahu.""  This directly links the development of European fashion and the use of buttons to the end of the Middle Ages.
"
He aha te hua o te whakamahi i ngā pātene hei whakapiri i ngā kakahu? ,"The correct answer is **C: The Crusades**.

The passage states: ""...ka tīmata ngā ekenga ka tīmata ngā tāngata ki te whakamahi pātene hei whakamau kākahu."" ( ""...the crusades began and people started to use buttons to fasten clothes."")

Therefore, the introduction of buttons for clothing was a consequence of the Crusades.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakaarotia ana he rongoā wā roa ki ngā take taiao?","The correct answer is **C: E whakaatu ana i te take o ngā take**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ki te kore tātou e hiahia ki te rongoā taupua noa iho, me rapu tātou i te aka o ngā raru, ā, me whakakore e tātou."" This translates to: ""...if we don't just want a quick fix, we must find the root cause of the problems, and we must eliminate them.""  Finding the root cause and addressing it is a long-term solution, not a quick fix or a superficial remedy.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ngā kōwhiringa āhua noho tāpiri (Additive lifestyle changes):** While helpful, this is a *part* of the solution, not the *entire* long-term solution.
* **B: Whakakotahitanga (Unity/Solidarity):**  Important for mobilizing action, but doesn't address the underlying problems.
* **D: E tū mai ana he urunga o te nekeneke taiao (Emerging as a right to environmental activism):**  Environmental activism is a *result* of recognizing problems, not the solution itself.



Therefore, the passage emphasizes understanding and tackling the root causes of environmental problems, making option C the most accurate answer.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tehea o enei otinga e kore e kiia he maimoatanga tohu mo nga take taiao?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā whakaaro pōti mō ngā kōwhiringa āhua noho tāpiri (Speculative ideas for additional lifestyle changes)**.

Here's why:

The passage contrasts simply adapting (like planting seeds) with actively addressing the *root causes* of environmental problems. It emphasizes understanding and tackling the *source* of the issues, not just making superficial changes. 

Option C refers to *speculative* ideas – things that *might* work but aren't necessarily grounded in solving the core problems. The passage implies that focusing on fundamental change (B) and improving our current lifestyle (D) are more effective than simply brainstorming potential additions to our lifestyle.  ""E whakauru ana ki te mahi"" (integrating into work) is also a reasonable approach to addressing environmental issues, further supporting why C is the odd one out.



"
"I roto i tehea whenua i puta ai te pakanga tuatahi i Uropi e kiia ana ko te take matua e pā ana ki te ōritetanga o te mana, kaua ki te take karakia?","The correct answer is **D: Pāniora**.

The passage states: ""Ko te War of Spanish Succession te pakanga tuatahi ko te take matua ko te taurite o te mana."" (The War of the Spanish Succession was the first war primarily about the principle of the balance of power.) And later: ""He tohu tēnei o tētahi tīnitanga nunui, nā te mea kāore ngā mana Pākehā he pakanga hāhī tēnei."" (This is a sign of a great change, because the European powers were not a religious war.) The War of the Spanish Succession was fought primarily in Spain, concerning the succession to the Spanish throne.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea rohe te mea pai rawa atu mō tētahi rā takutai marino?","The correct answer is **D: Waitemata Harbor**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ko ngā takutai ki Te Raki Paewhenua (kei Te Whanganui a Toi) **kei Te Moana nui a Kiwa, e toro ana mai i Long Bay ki Devonport**."" This describes the beaches within the Waitemata Harbor.
* It further mentions: ""Ko te Pūahatanga Waitemata ngā taha moana o Tamaki Drive, **ki ngā wāhi tāone whai rawa o Mission Bay me St Heliers ki te pito o Tāmaki Makaurau**."" This reinforces that Waitemata Harbor is the area being discussed.
* The passage highlights that many of these waters are safe and lined with pōhutukawa trees, suitable for family outings and swimming.

The other options are not directly mentioned or described as the best place for a safe beach day in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea ngā āhuatanga kaukau e tino haumaru ana?","The correct answer is **B: Takiwā Harbor ki te Raki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ngā takutai ki Te Raki Paewhenua (kei Te Whanganui a Toi) kei Te Moana nui a Kiwa, e toro ana mai i Long Bay ki Devonport.""  This translates to ""The shores towards North Head (near Whanganui a Toi) are in the Great Ocean of Maui, extending from Long Bay to Devonport.""  And then it says ""Ko te nuinga o ngā moana haumaru nei, ā, ko te nuinga hoki kua whakamarua e te rākau pōhutukawa."" meaning ""Most of these safe seas, and most have been sheltered by the pōhutukawa tree."" This implies the area around North Head (and thus Devonport) is considered safe.

While the passage mentions Long Bay and Devonport specifically in relation to the safe seas, option B, ""Takiwā Harbor ki te Raki"" (North Head Harbor area), encompasses both and is the most accurate representation of where the safe/sheltered waters are.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Devonport:** While Devonport is mentioned, the passage doesn't explicitly say it's the *most* sheltered.
*   **C: Ākarana Waenga (Central Area):** The passage doesn't mention the central area.
*   **D: Te Moana Roa (The Long Ocean):** This refers to the open ocean, which is described as dangerous (""Kaukau haumaru"" - unsafe seas) in the passage.



"
"I a ia e haere ana ki te tauwāhi i whakaahuatia i roto i te wāhi, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kiia ana he tika?","The correct answer is **B: Kei te mahue i tētahi tohu ki tētahi wāhi huri noa i te pae.**

Here's why:

The passage describes a place of immense historical significance and tragedy, specifically referencing the Holocaust and the immense suffering endured there. The phrase ""whakapaa"" (to commemorate) aligns with the act of marking a location with a symbol or memorial to remember what happened. Options A, C, and D don't fit the context of remembrance and honoring the victims. They relate more to construction or observation, not commemoration.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whakamārama ana i ngā reo lingua francas?,"The correct answer is **B: Kāore i te mōhiotia (Not mentioned)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly contrasts auxiliary languages with lingua francas. It *defines* auxiliary languages as languages *created* to facilitate communication and *require permission* to be used.  It then states that lingua francas are *naturally developed* languages that gain prominence due to a specific purpose.

Therefore, the passage **doesn't mention** or explain lingua francas, it contrasts them with auxiliary languages.
"
Ko tēhea tauākī kāore e whakaahua tika ana i ngā reo tūturu?,"The correct answer is **A: He reo tūturu ēnei e whakamahia ana hei māmā ake i te whakawhitiwhiti kōrero i waenganui i ngā tāngata kāore pea e mārama ki a rātou anō.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes auxiliary languages as deliberately constructed languages designed to facilitate communication between speakers of different languages.** They are *meant* to be understood, even if not natively.
* **Option A describes auxiliary languages as being *not* understood by the speakers themselves.** This is the opposite of their intended purpose.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He reo rātau, he māori, he mea hanga rānei:** This is a general description of what auxiliary languages *are*, not what they *aren't*.
* **C: He reo hanganga hei whakapai ake i ngā tauari whakawhiti kōrero uaua:** This accurately reflects the purpose of auxiliary languages, as stated in the passage.
* **D: Kua waihangatia he reo kaha i waenganui i ngā tukuoro o ngā reo rerekē:** This also aligns with the passage's description of auxiliary languages as a way to bridge communication gaps between diverse languages.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me aha te tirohanga pāhihi mehemea kai te hōtoke to rātau tere?","The correct answer is **A: Tauwāhi Cabin**.

The text states: ""Kei roto i ngā rerenga Saint Petersburg he wā ki rō tāone. Kei te wātea ngā pāhihi rerenga i ngā herenga pane uruwhenua (tirohia ngā herenga)."" This translates to: ""There is time in the Saint Petersburg train journeys to the city. The train tickets are available at the underground ticket offices (check the stations).""

The question asks about the consequences of high speed train tickets.  The passage mentions ""Tauwāhi Cabin"" (which likely refers to a specific type of ticket or cabin on the train) in the context of the Saint Petersburg train journey. Therefore,  ""Tauwāhi Cabin"" is the most logical connection.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, mehemea kai te raumati te tere o te pāhihi, he aha pea ka taea e rātau te karo?","The correct answer is **A: Wā i te taone (Time in the city)**.

Here's why:

The text says to check fog conditions when crossing the river to Northern Baltic because fog is interesting for those affected by that kind of disease. It also mentions that the ferry routes to Saint Petersburg have time to get to the city. The fog is a concern, implying a potential health risk.  The best way to avoid the fog and its associated risk is to spend time *in the city* (Saint Petersburg) after the ferry crossing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E haere ana i te hukapapa (Going to the embankment):** This is not a solution to avoiding the fog.
*   **C: Ngā whakaritenga visa (Visa requirements):** Fog isn't related to visa requirements.
*   **D: Saint Petersburg:** While Saint Petersburg is the destination, the text suggests spending time *in the city* rather than simply being *in* Saint Petersburg.

He aha te take i whakamahia ai te reo Catalan i te nuinga o te wā mō ngā tohu me ngā panui i Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko te reo mana tuatahi tērā o te taone.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Tata ki te haurua ka pai ake ki te kōrero Catalan, ā, māramatia e te tino nuinga, ā, tata ki te katoa e mōhio ana ki te reo Pāniora. Heoi anō, kei te tohua te nuinga o ngā tohu ki te reo Catalan anake nā te mea kua whakaūngia e te ture koirā te reo ōkawa tuatahi."" (Roughly: While Spanish is widely understood, most signs are in Catalan because the law declared Catalan the official language.)

Therefore, the reason Catalan is used for signs and announcements is because it's the official language of the city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He nui ake te mārama i te Spanish:** The text says Spanish is *widely understood*, but that doesn't explain *why* Catalan is used for official purposes.
* **C: Ko te reo manako tēnei i Barcelona:** The text doesn't suggest Catalan is the *preferred* language, just the official one.
* **D: Ko te Metro me ētahi atu whare tūmatanui he nuinga o ngā tangata e kōrero Catalan:** While some people working in these places might speak Catalan, it doesn't justify using Catalan for public signage and announcements.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā reo e whai ake nei e whakamahia ana e te pūnaha Metro o Barcelona mō ngā panui auau?,"The correct answer is **C: Reo Pāniora**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kei te tohua te nuinga o ngā tohu ki te reo Catalan anake nā te mea kua whakaūngia e te ture koirā te reo ōkawa tuatahi. Heoi, E māhorahora ana te kōrerotia o te reo Pāniora ki ngā wāhi tūmatanui me ērā momo wāhi. **Ko ngā pānui auau i te Metro e mahi noa ana ki Catalan, heoi ko ngā putanga kōrero raruraru kore perēne nā te pūnaha mīhini auau i roto i ngā tini reo pēnei i te Paniora, te Ingarihi, te Wīwi, te Araby me te Hapanihi.**"" This shows Spanish is used, though not perfectly due to technical limitations.

Therefore, Spanish is one of the languages used.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ngā taonga e whai ake nei e kore pea e whakaritea e te moenga mutunga tiketike me te parakuihi?","The correct answer is **D: WiFi Tere (Free WiFi)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes high-quality B&Bs often focusing on the quality of bedding and towels, and sometimes incorporating vintage features. While the other options are increasingly common amenities, the passage *doesn't* mention them as core components of a top-tier B&B experience.  Free WiFi is a relatively modern expectation and not inherently tied to the traditional, high-quality focus described.

Here's why the other options are less likely to be *excluded*:

*   **A: Ngā tuemi tahua motuhake (Specialty toiletries):** High-end B&Bs often offer nice toiletries, especially those sourced locally or with a focus on quality.
*   **B: Ngā whakarato ārai motuhake (Special cleaning arrangements):**  This is a reasonable expectation for a quality B&B.
*   **C: Kia mau tonu ngā mokowā o waho (Maintaining outdoor spaces):**  The passage mentions vintage houses and gardens, suggesting outdoor space maintenance is likely.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i tētahi o ngā wāhi matua o te whakataetae i waenganui i ngā B&Bs rangatira?","The correct answer is **A: Te whakapaipai o naianei (Modern amenities)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the quality of the bed and breakfast experience, specifically mentioning:

* **High-quality bedding and towels:** This is stated as the primary competition for upscale B&Bs.
* **Quality ingredients:**  Emphasis is placed on local, artisanal food.
* **Historic buildings and details:**  Old houses with beautiful floors and features like fountains are highlighted.

""Te whakapaipai o naianei"" (Modern amenities) doesn't fit into this picture.  The passage emphasizes traditional quality and atmosphere, not modern conveniences. Options B, C, and D *could* be considered aspects of a high-quality B&B experience, relating to towel management, a comfortable atmosphere, and food & drink offerings respectively.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e puritia ki Beijing i te tau 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā takahanga rohe reti Taizicheng**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mā Beijing e noho hei hau kāinga mō ngā hui tuwhera, aukati anō hoki, me ngā mahi tio ki rō whare."" This means Beijing will host **open** and **closed** events, and **ice skating** at the venues.

The text also mentions: ""Ngā huinga retireti kei te wāhi retireti Taizicheng ki Zhangjiakou, he āhua 220 km (140 mairo) mai i Beijing."" This means the retirement gatherings will be held in Zhangjiakou, not in Beijing. Therefore, they will not be hosted *in* Beijing.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka taurimatia e Beijing i te tau 2022?","The correct answer is **C: Te Omihana o te hōtoke** (Winter Olympics).

The passage explicitly states that Beijing was the first city to host the Winter Olympics in both summer and winter.
"
Ko wai te tino mate ka pa ki te rewharewha avian?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā tāngata e mahi ana me ngā whāngote**.

The passage states: ""Iti iho i te kotahi mano kēhi kua pūrongotia ki te tangata, heoi tērā pea ka mōrearea hoki ki te hunga mātaki manu. **Ko te nuinga kua pā ki ngā tāngata e mahi nei me ngā manu pāmu**..."" (Only a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but it may also spread to birdwatchers. **Most have affected people who work with poultry**...).

While ""ngā kaitiaki manu"" (bird keepers) and ""ngā kaimahi Poultry"" (Poultry workers) are related, ""ngā tāngata e mahi ana me ngā whāngote"" (people who work with poultry) is the most accurate and comprehensive description based on the passage. Option A is too general, and Option D is incorrect because the passage doesn't mention people who have been previously exposed.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te rewharewha manu?","The correct answer is **D: Ko ngā take katoa i pūrongotia i te tangata i mate.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Iti iho i te kotahi mano kēhi kua pūrongotia ki te tangata, heoi tērā pea ka mōrearea hoki ki te hunga mātaki manu.""  This translates to: ""Only about a thousand cases have been reported in humans, but some have died. Most have affected people who work with poultry, but it may also spread to birdwatchers.""
* Option D accurately reflects this:  It acknowledges that some cases have been fatal *in humans*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko ngā kaimahi manu anake kua pāngia e te rewharewha:** The text says *most* affected people work with poultry, but it doesn't state *only* them.
* **B: He nui ake ngā take i pūrongotia i te tangata i te manu:** The text says the number of reported cases in humans is *small*.
* **C: Kei te mōrearea te hunga mātakitaki manu kia mate:** While the text suggests birdwatchers *may* be at risk, it doesn't explicitly say they are *likely* to die.



"
He aha te mea e hono ana i te Moana Pākehā-Baltic Canal?,"The correct answer is **B: Roto Onega me Awa Volga**

Here's why:

The question asks what connects the White Sea-Baltic Canal. The provided text states: ""Kei te honoa hoki a Lake Onega ki Volga, nō reira ka taea tonu te haere mai i te Caspian Sea mā Rūhia."" (Lake Onega is also connected to the Volga River, so it is possible to travel from the Caspian Sea via Russia).

Therefore, Lake Onega and the Volga River are the connecting points mentioned in the text. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they don't reflect the information provided.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te momo waka ka kohia pea ngā uruwhenua kia kore ai e haukoti i te pāhihi?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā tereina moe pō (Night trains)**.

The text specifically states: ""In night trains, the train driver will collect the passengers' luggage so they are not disturbed from their sleep.""  Therefore, night trains are the type of train mentioned as collecting luggage to prevent disturbance.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea pea ka tirohia tō ID i ētahi tereina taitapa?","The correct answer is **A: I muri iho i te whakakotahitanga i te tereina.**

The text states: ""Ko tētahi wāhi tiro kuhunga mai te tūnga tuatahi i te nuinga o te wā ka hekeheke i tētahi waka rererangi, kaipuke, waka atu anō rānei. Ka whakawātia ētahi tereina whakawhiti-rohe mā te tereina e haruru ana, ā, me whai tāutunga i tō ekenga ki tētahi o ēnei tereina.""  This translates to: ""A check-in point at the initial station most of the time will move on a plane, ship, ferry, etc. Transfer gates will be activated by the train you are getting on, and you must have a ticket to one of these gates.""

Therefore, you'd check your ID *after* you've boarded the train and are at the transfer gate.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā take e whai ake nei ka tino puta ake i te wā e noho ana i te rohe teitei o Singapore?,"The correct answer is **C: E pāngia ana te rongoā wera (You will be affected by the heat)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nā te noho ki ngā """"takiwa tino pārū"""" ētahi tīkiri noa ki te raki o te weheruatanga o te ao ka pāngia koe te wera (i ngā wā katoa)"" which translates to ""Living in the 'hottest areas' of the northern hemisphere you will be affected by the heat (at all times).""

The other options are not mentioned in the provided text."
Ko wai e kore e pai ki te kai i ngā keke Tiamana?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko tētahi tangata e whakakino ana i te tiokorete**.

Here's why:

The text describes German pastries as delicious, with flavors like vanilla, cinnamon, and nuts. It specifically mentions ""keke rorotu ki tētahi kapu kawhe hūnene"" (apple strudel with coffee cream) as a particularly good treat. 

Someone who ""whakakino ana i te tiokorete"" (dislikes sweetness) would likely *not* enjoy these pastries. The other options don't fit:

*   **A: Ko tētahi tangata whai nati tino nui** (Someone who eats a lot of nuts): While some pastries contain nuts, the text doesn't indicate this is a reason someone wouldn't like them.
*   **B: Ko tētahi tangata e hiahia ana ki ngā tohu taunaki ake** (Someone who desires more sophisticated flavors): The text describes flavors as vanilla, cinnamon, and nuts which are not considered more sophisticated.
*   **D: Ko tētahi tangata e hiahia ana ki ngā kaihoko reka i runga i nga kaihoko rei** (Someone who wants expensive items on luxury shoppers): This option has no logical connection to the description of German pastries.



"
Ko tehea te kai e kiia ana he huānga o te wā o ngā keke Tiamana?,"The correct answer is **A: Āporoiti**.

The passage mentions that many German pastries contain nuts. ""Aprikosen"" translates to apricots in English, but in this context, it refers to nuts, a common ingredient in German pastries. The passage also mentions nuts (Nati rākau atu) are used. 

Therefore, ""Aprikosen"" (nuts) is the best answer.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te aki tūtohu mo te haere i runga i te tahua?","The correct answer is **C: Tono tāngata mō te moni (Hire people for money)**.

Here's why:

The passage advocates for a frugal lifestyle and minimizing expenses to achieve financial freedom. Option C directly contradicts this by suggesting hiring people *for money*. This implies spending money on labor, which goes against the core principle of minimizing expenditure.

Let's look at why the other options are aligned with the passage:

*   **A: Kimihia ngā mahi rerekē hei mahi i roto i ō haerenga (Seek out varied work within your journey):** This aligns with the idea of being resourceful and potentially generating income through diverse means, keeping costs down.
*   **B: Kia ngāwari ki tō taumata whakamarie (Be careful about your comfort level):**  This encourages restraint and avoiding unnecessary spending on comfort, fitting the frugal theme.
*   **D: Whakaitihia nga whakapaunga penei i te kai me te noho (Budget for necessities such as food and housing):**  This is essential for a frugal lifestyle, ensuring basic needs are met without overspending.

Therefore, hiring people for money is the only option that doesn't support the passage's core message of financial frugality and minimizing expenses.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, tērā pea he uaua te haere i runga i te tahua iti rawa?","The correct answer is **C: E hiahia ana tētahi ki te mahi mamao i a ia e haere ana**.

Here's why:

* The passage says that those who want to minimize expenses need to ""track their spending carefully"" and ""take a similar journey."" This implies that minimizing expenses requires effort and careful management.
* Option C directly reflects this idea of needing to work hard/be diligent (""mahi mamao"") to achieve a lower cost of living.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ko tētahi tangata e pōhiri ana i tētahi uaua (Someone welcomes a difficulty)** - The passage doesn't suggest someone welcomes difficulty; it describes a strategy to *avoid* difficulty (high expenses).
* **B: Tētahi tangata kāore he herenga wā pākaha (Someone doesn't have a tight schedule)** -  The passage focuses on financial planning, not schedule flexibility.
* **D: Ko tētahi tangata e hiahia ana ki te whai i tētahi iti (Someone wants to achieve a smaller one)** -  This is a bit vague. The passage isn't about wanting a *smaller* item, but about *lower expenses*.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaahua i te waka i waenganui i Point Marion me Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **A: He roa nga whārōrō o te huarahi whenua mamao (The roads are long and winding)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage specifically mentions the road is through heavily forested terrain and has difficult curves. Option A aligns with this description of winding roads.
*   The passage explicitly states there are many curves (""ngā āhuatanga taraiwa uaua rawa"") and warns of sharp bends (""ngā kokonga koki tāhapa""). Option B, ""He kikī nga Lanes (The lanes are narrow)"", also aligns with the description of difficult roads.
*   The passage says speed limits are low and must be strictly adhered to. Option C, ""Āhua kore nei e piri ana ngā tepe tere ki (Speed limits are not adhered to)"", is the opposite of what the passage states.
*   The passage indicates that cell service is spotty due to the Pennsylvania Wilds. Option D, ""Ko te tikanga kia kaua te ratonga waea pūkoro e take (It is customary not to use cell phones)"", is not mentioned or implied in the passage.

Therefore, option A is the one that doesn't accurately depict the road between Point Marion and Fairmont, as the passage details the winding nature of the roads, not their length."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei he tino māharahara mo nga atekōkiri e haere ana i runga i te huarahi Buffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **A: E mau ana i roto i nga waka taumaha (Stay in your lane)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""He nui ngā paripari, ngā huarahi whāiti, me ngā kokonga koki tāhapa. He iti iho ngā here tere e tohua ana i ērā ki ngā wāhanga o mua, o muri anō hoki - he nui te wā ko te 35-40 m/h (56-64 km/h), - ā, he mea hira rawa te tino whai i ēnei i ērā atu.""  This emphasizes the importance of staying in your lane due to the narrow roads and frequent obstacles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kāore i te tika te ratonga pūkoro (Cell service is not available):** The passage says the cell service is *more* unreliable in these areas, not that it's unavailable.
* **C: Kia tere rawa te huri koi (Take sharp turns quickly):** The passage warns against sharp turns due to the narrow roads and obstacles.
* **D: E pā ana ki ngā mahi huarahi auau (Related to road construction):** While road construction might be a factor, the passage focuses on the inherent dangers of the road's design, not specific construction activities.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e hiahiatia hei tīmata i te hīkoi?,"The correct answer is **D: He iti te whakangungu (Little training)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that canyoning requires significant training, including things like rock climbing, abseiling, and mountain scrambling. ""He iti te whakangungu"" (little training) is the opposite of what's required.  The other options are all relevant skills for canyoning:

*   **A: Te kaha ki te kauhoe (Rope skills)** - Essential for abseiling.
*   **B: Te āhua ōkiko o Peak (Peak fitness)** - Important for the hiking and navigating involved.
*   **C: Āheinga Peke (Rappelling skills)** - A core skill in canyoning.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e hiahiatia ana hei haerenga pai ki te awaawa?,"The correct answer is **A: Āheinga athletic arā atu anō (A good level of athletic fitness)**.

Here's why:

* **Canyoneering is physically demanding.** The question highlights the combination of scrambling, climbing, and rappelling.  You need a base level of fitness to handle this.
* **B (Scuba diving experience) is irrelevant.**  Canyoneering involves navigating canyons with water, but it's not the same as scuba diving underwater.
* **C (Mental toughness) is important, but not the primary requirement.** While mental toughness is beneficial for overcoming fear and challenges, physical fitness is more essential for the actual activities involved.
* **D (Strong physique) is good, but fitness is broader.**  While strength helps, it's the overall fitness level (cardiovascular endurance, strength, agility) needed for all the canyoning movements that's most important.



Therefore, a good level of athletic fitness is the fundamental requirement for a safe and enjoyable canyoneering experience."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina ki tētahi tangata e whakaaro ana ki te hopuni i roto i to rātau motokā?","The correct answer is **A: He mōhiotanga kaha ki nga tepenga o to waka**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing your vehicle's capabilities and limitations before attempting to tow. It mentions knowing the towing capacity and understanding the vehicle's limits.  This is directly related to option A.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: He waka e āhei ai nga tūru ki te whakatakoto:** While the passage mentions that some vehicles (like SUVs, Sedans, Station Wagons) can tow, the *main* point isn't just about having a towable vehicle. It's about knowing *how much* it can tow.
* **C: He tēneti:**  The passage mentions securing the load, but this is a secondary point compared to knowing the towing capacity itself.
* **D: He āhuatanga tūmatawhāiti ki te hopuni i runga i te:** The passage mentions parking in visible locations to avoid scrutiny, but this is about avoiding problems related to towing, not the core skill required for towing.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea e hiahia ana ngā puni motokā ki te karo mehemea kei te kimi rātau ki te noho i raro i te hihiani?","The correct answer is **C: Te whakatū teneti i te tāone, i te whenua tūmatawhāiti rānei.**

The passage states: ""Mā te whakarite teneti ki runga i tētahi wāhi tūmatawhāiti, ki runga rānei i tētahi tāone ahakoa te nui, kāore e kore ka tae mai ngā titiro kikino."" This translates to: ""By parking on a public place, or even in a town no matter how big, close attention will not come.""

This directly addresses how to avoid unwanted attention when parking. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kei te taraiwa i tētahi waka nui ake, pēnei i te SUV, i te iti rānei:** The passage says *smaller* cars are better for road trips, not larger ones.
* **B: Kei te mau i tētahi paepae roa ake:**  This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: E kore e mōhio ki te waka e whakamahia ana e rātau:**  The passage implies knowing what kind of car you're using is important.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, nāna i hanga anō a Casablanca i te tuarua o nga wā?","The correct answer is **D: Te sultan o Morocco**.

The passage states: ""Ko Casablanca tētahi o ngā wāhi iti rawa te ngahau hei hokohoko ki te katoa o Marako. Huri noa i old Medina he māmā te rapu wāhi e hoko ana i ngā rawa tuku iho Māroko, pērā i te tagine, i te uku, i ngā rawa kirikau, i ngā hookah, i te whānuitanga o ngā geegaws, engari mā te tūruhi te katoa. **I hangaia anō e te sultan o Marako te tāone nui hei Daru I-Badya**...""

This clearly indicates the Sultan of Morocco rebuilt Casablanca."
Ko wai i whakarere i te taone hou o Casablanca i muri i tētahi aitua māori?,"The correct answer is **B: Te Potukara (The Portuguese)**.

The text states: ""Nā te iwi Potugese i turaki, ka hanga mai anō me te ingoa o Casa Branca..."" This translates to ""The Portuguese conquered it, and rebuilt it with the name Casa Branca..."" and later ""ka whakarerea hoki whai muri mai i te rū whenua i te tau 1755,"" meaning ""and it was later renamed after the earthquake in 1755."" 

Therefore, the Portuguese renamed Casablanca after the earthquake.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, i pēhea te whiwhi āhukahuka a Sintra i waenganui i nga manene?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā taupānga Marian**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""ā, i rongonui ai ki te hunga rāwaho i muri i te kōrero kauanuanu mō āna ātanga nā Lord Byron i tuhi. He rite tonu te haere a te Pahi Scotturb 403 ki Sintra, me te tau hoki ki Cabo da Roca. Ki te raki hoki me toro i te Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Shrine) nui whakaharahara, **ā, he wāhi o ngā mariko Marion rongonui puta noa i te ao**.""

This directly links Sintra's fame to the Marian apparitions (events involving the Virgin Mary).  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cabo da Roca** - Cabo da Roca is a location near Sintra, not the reason for its fame.
*   **C: Ngā arotakenga tōrunga a Te Ariki Byron** - While Byron wrote about Sintra, the text emphasizes the Marian apparitions as the source of its renown.
*   **D: He hītori mātao tēnei** - The text doesn't explicitly state it's a historical story; it focuses on the reasons for Sintra's fame.



"
He aha te mea kāore i te mōhiotia e Armenia?,"The correct answer is **A: Te rohe Nagorno-Karabakh**. 

Here's why:

* The passage states that a new country was established in the Nagorno-Karabakh region, supported by Armenia. 
* Importantly, it also says ""Kaua hoki ko Āmenia - i te whakamana i a ia"" which translates to ""Nor was Armenia - to recognize it."" This means Armenia did *not* recognize the Nagorno-Karabakh region as an independent entity. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te whawhai ki nga Azeris:** Armenia was *involved* in the war with Azerbaijan.
* **C: Ngā tohenga whakawhanaunga a Azerbaijan:** The passage mentions diplomatic efforts, implying Azerbaijan *was* engaging in diplomatic efforts.
* **D: Te whenua hou:** The passage clearly states a new country *was* established.



"
He aha te mea e pā tonu ana ki ngā whanaungatanga i waenganui i Azerbaijan me Armenia?,"The best answer is **C: Ngā tohenga ā-ture (Legal disputes)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what *continues* to be a factor in the relationship.** The passage explicitly states that ""kāore tētahi whenua whakapūmau - kaua hoki ko Āmenia - i te whakamana i a ia. Ko ngā amuamu ā-takawaenga mō te rohe e haere tonu ana ngā hononga i waenganui i a Armenia me Azerbaijan."" This translates to ""No permanent country - not even Armenia - has recognized it. **Legal disputes** for the region continue to hinder relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Aramenia e noho ana i Azerbaijan (Armenia lives in Azerbaijan):** This is incorrect. Armenia and Azerbaijan are separate countries.
* **B: Te pakanga o te tau 1994 (The war of 1994):** While the 1994 war *caused* the ongoing issues, the passage highlights that the *disputes* stemming from the war are what persist.
* **D: Rohe Nagorno-Karabakh (Nagorno-Karabakh region):** Nagorno-Karabakh is the *focus* of the disputes, but the question asks about what continues to be a factor in the *relationship* between the two countries. The disputes *over* Nagorno-Karabakh are the ongoing factor.



"
"I a ia e mau ana i tētahi teka i Charlotte, he aha pea ka āhei ki tētahi utu tāpiri?","The correct answer is **C: Haere ana ki Uptown**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the number of quality childcare options in Uptown Charlotte has grown significantly in the last 20 years. It also mentions that childcare is expensive, especially when seeking the highest quality.  Therefore, to access a wider range of potentially higher-quality childcare, one would likely need to live in Uptown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kei te noho anō ki tētahi atu rohe:** The passage doesn't link location outside of Uptown to additional fees. In fact, it suggests the opposite - Uptown has more options.
* **B: Tokotoru nga pāhihi:** The passage mentions childcare costs being high, but doesn't specifically state that a 3rd floor location would incur extra fees.
* **D: He rata ki te whānau:**  Being close to family is mentioned as a benefit of Charlotte, but isn't directly related to additional childcare fees.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e whakaarotia ana he kōaro ki te noho i Charlotte me nga tamariki?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā utu whare (Housing costs)**.

The passage states: ""Kāore ngā whānau i Charlotte i te tino whakamahi tākihi, ahakoa ka whai take i ētahi wā. He utu āpiti mō te whai i te nui ake i te 2 pāhihi, nō reira ka nui pea te utu mō tēnei kōwhiringa i te mea waiwai."" This translates to: ""Families in Charlotte don't heavily rely on public transport, although they do sometimes. Housing costs are expensive, especially for those looking at areas over 2 miles away, so this housing is quite pricey.""

Therefore, the passage highlights the high cost of housing as a potential drawback to living in Charlotte with children.
"
"I mua i te taenga mai o nga Paniora, ko wai i whakahaere i te taha raki o Chile?","The correct answer is **C: Araucanians**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""I mua i te taenga mai o te Paniora i te rautau 16, i raro a Chile ki te raki i te mana o Inca, ā, ko ngā māori o Araucanian (Mapuche) i noho atu ki te pokapū me te tonga o Chile."" This directly indicates that the Araucanians (Mapuche) inhabited the central and southern parts of Chile *before* the Spanish arrival.
* The question asks about the governance of the *northern* part of Chile *before* the Spanish. The passage doesn't explicitly state who governed the northern part before the Spanish, but it does state that the Inca held power over Chile. The Inca Empire was based in present-day Peru, and their control extended northwards into Chile.
*  The other options are incorrect based on the passage:
    * **A: Mapuche:** The passage says they lived in the *central and southern* parts.
    * **B: Americans:** The passage is about pre-colonial history, and the term ""Americans"" is not used in a precise way to describe historical groups in this context.
    * **D: pus:** This is not a relevant option.



Therefore, while the passage doesn't detail northern Chile's governance pre-Spanish, the Araucanians were the dominant group in central and southern Chile, and the Inca controlled Chile north of them. The Araucanians are the closest fit based on the information provided, and the question likely has a slight inaccuracy.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i puta i te tau kotahi mano 1810?","The correct answer is **B: I tutuki i a Chile te wikitōria i runga i te Pāniora** (Chile achieved victory over Spain).

Here's why:

The text states: ""E ahakoa i tū motuhake a Chile i te tau 1810... kāore tonu i whakatutuki te tino wikitoria ki ngā Pāniora tae rawa ki te tau 1818.""  This means Chile *did not* achieve a decisive victory over Spain in 1810.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tērā te korenga o te kāwanatanga matua** (The absence of the mother country's government): This is stated directly in the text. ""i raro a Chile ki te raki i te mana o Inca, ā, ko ngā māori o Araucanian (Mapuche) i noho atu ki te pokapū me te tonga o Chile. Ko te Mapuche hoki tētahi o ngā rōpū taketake motuhake o Amerika, kāore i whakaurua katoatia ki raro i te mana kōrero-Pāniora tae noa atu ki te tū motuhake o Hiri.""
*   **C: E whawhaitia ana nga pakanga Napoleonic** (The Napoleonic Wars were being fought):  The text explicitly mentions ""i roto i te wā o ngā pakanga Napoleonic i kore ai a Pāniora i whai kāwanatanga ā-motu whaitake mō ngā tau e rua"" (during the Napoleonic Wars, Spain did not have a stable colonial government for two years).
*   **D: I whakapuakina e Chile te rangatiratanga** (Chile proclaimed independence): The text says Chile became independent in 1810.

Therefore, the only statement that did *not* happen in 1810 is that Chile achieved victory over Spain.



"
Me pēhea e tae ai te tangata ki nga kāinga mamao i te rohe o Liguria?,"The correct answer is **B: Mā te motokā, te tereina rānei**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kei te honohono ngā ara, ngā tereina, ngā pōti hoki i ngā kāinga..."" (Roads, trains, and buses connect the villages...).  This indicates that both cars and trains are ways to reach the villages.  Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mā te motokā, poti rānei:** The text mentions buses, not specifically ""poti"" (ferries).
* **C: Mā te tereina, poti rānei:** The text doesn't mention ferries as a means of transport to these villages.
* **D: Mā te waka rererangi, te tereina rānei:**  The text explicitly states that boats *cannot* reach the villages from outside."
He aha te kōrero a te kupu Itari 'Cinque Terre'?,"The correct answer is **A: E rima nga kāinga (Five villages)**.

The first sentence of the text states: ""Ko Cinque Terre, ko te tikanga ko Ngā Whenua e Rima, ko ngā kāinga tai paku e rima..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means the Five Lands, are five picturesque fishing villages..."" Therefore, the name ""Cinque Terre"" refers to the five villages.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo whakaara e tika ana mō ngā āhuatanga o te hōtoke māniania?","The correct answer is **A: Whakaara me ngā rekereke whāiti**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Me pāpaku, me whānui ngā rekereke. He rite tonu te ruirui i te oneone, i te matakirikiri, i te tote (konopūmā pūhaumāota) ki ngā huarahi, i ngā ara rānei hei whakapai ake i te pupuri.""  This means the tread should be textured to improve grip.  **Whakaara (tread)** and **rekereke whāiti (studs)** are specifically mentioned as ways to achieve this grip, especially for icy conditions.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e āwhina ki te whakapai ake i te pūngao i runga i ngā huarahi hukarere i te wā o te hotoke?,"The correct answer is **D: Wai**.

Here's why:

The passage states that **konopūmā pūhaumāota (gravel)** is used on paths and trails to improve traction.  The other options are all things that help with traction on muddy paths:

*   **Tote (gravel):** Improves grip on muddy surfaces.
*   **Kirikiri (fir trees):** The passage mentions ""whao ā ētahi pūtu"" (some cones as tools), implying trees can be helpful.
*   **Onepū (sand):** Also improves grip.

**Wai (water)** would make the path *more* slippery, not improve traction. Therefore, it's the answer that doesn't help.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e ōrite ana ki a Hawaii me ngā Moutere o Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka tiria e rātou te rohe wā ōrite** (They experience similar weather).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""He ōrite ana te wāhi wā ki tā hawaii, i tētahi wā kei te whakaarohia ngā motu hei """"Hawaii ki raro""""."" (The climate is similar to Hawaii, sometimes the islands are considered ""Hawaii underneath""). This refers to the weather patterns.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He maha nga hōtēra nunui o rāua tahi** (They both have many large hotels). The passage mentions that the Cook Islands, like Hawaii before development, lack large hotels and other development. This is the opposite of what option A states.
* **B: Kāore i a rāua tahi te tūnga** (They don't both have the same location). The passage clearly states the Cook Islands are in the South Pacific Ocean, and it compares their location to Hawaii.
* **D: Kāore ō rāua tahi i te whai pa** (They don't both have a settlement). The passage says the Cook Islands don't have a large town, but they *do* have 15 islands.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua i ngā Moutere o Cook?,"The correct answer is **B: He pūranga tēnei (This is a story/tale)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage is clearly a factual description of the Cook Islands. 
*   Options A, C, and D all accurately reflect information presented in the text.
*   Option B is incorrect because the passage presents information about the Cook Islands as factual, not as a story or tale.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā teihana ranger e whai ake nei e tuku ana i ngā momo noho e rua?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""Ko Sirena anake te teihana whare kaitiaki e tuku ana i te wharenoho rūma moe, te noho me ngā kai wera hei tāpiritanga ki te pūpahi."" (Sirena is the only ranger station that offers lodging, meals, and firewood as a service to the trailhead.)
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka taea e koe te rāhui i tētahi haerengapāka mēnā e hiahia ana koe ki te whakamahi moni, kaua ko te hua?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Me whai whakaaetanga koe kia noho mō te pō ki Sirena."" (You must obtain permission to stay overnight at Sirena.) and ""Kei Sirena anake te teihana whare kaitiaki e tuku ana i te wharenoho rūma moe, te noho me ngā kai wera hei tāpiritanga ki te pūpahi."" (Only the Sirena ranger station offers lodging, meals, and camping facilities at the trailhead).

The question asks where you *can* obtain a permit if you're willing to pay. The passage explicitly links overnight stays and facilities to Sirena. The other options are locations or services, but not the primary location for obtaining a permit for overnight stays.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te momo reti e mahia ana i te whenua poupou ake?","The correct answer is **C: Kāhua Alpine**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tēnei mahinga e kī ana hoki ko te reti reti i ngā whenua o muri, ko te reti tūruhi, ko te reti hīkoinga rānei.""  The description of these activities (""reti reti i ngā whenua o muri,"" etc.) aligns with **alpine skiing (kāhua alpine)**, which involves skiing down mountains. The passage further mentions using special equipment like skis and poles (""reti me ngā pūtu māro ake"").
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea ka āwhina ki te whakahoki i ngā reti whenua e hiahia ana ki te tae ki ngā tere teitei ake?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā pūtu Stiffer (Stiffer boots)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that hiking boots are generally used on relatively flat terrain and require less support. However, when needing to hike at higher speeds, or on more challenging terrain (like scrambling on established trails), stiffer boots are required to provide the necessary support and stability.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: He pōkai tuarā taumaha (Expensive crampons):** Crampons are primarily used for ice and snow, not for general hiking or higher speeds on dry terrain.
*   **C: Ngā here pai (Good laces):** Good laces are important for any hiking boot, but they don't provide the structural support needed for higher speeds or demanding terrain.
*   **D: Ngā riu kua purua (Worn soles):** Worn soles reduce traction, but don't directly address the need for stiffer support.

Therefore, stiffer boots are the most relevant solution for hiking at higher speeds and on more challenging terrain.



"
He uaua ki te mahi i te aha te hunga e haere ana e pā ana ki te whakaoho i te hokinga mai?,"The correct answer is **A: E urutau ana ki te ahurea o tētahi wāhi hōu (They adapt to a new culture)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te hunga hāereere he māmā te urutau ki te ahurea hou, i ētahi wā he uaua tā rātou urutau anō ki tō rātou ahurea taketake."" (Travelers easily adapt to a new culture, sometimes it's difficult for them to adapt to their own native culture again.)

The passage discusses the difficulty of readjusting to one's home culture after experiencing a new one. Option A directly reflects this central theme.

While options B, C, and D might be aspects of travel, they aren't the core difficulty discussed in the passage regarding the challenges of *returning* home.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He uaua rawa pea te pāwera o te hokinga mai anō mō te momo tangata haere?","The correct answer is **A: Ko ngā manuhiri i pā ki te tino kino o te ahurea (Visitors are strongly affected by the new culture).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te hunga hāereere he māmā te urutau ki te ahurea hou, i ētahi wā he uaua tā rātou urutau anō ki tō rātou ahurea taketake.""  This translates to: ""Travelers are easily drawn to the new culture, and sometimes it is difficult for them to return to their own native culture."" This directly indicates that visitors are strongly impacted by the new culture, making it difficult to reintegrate with their original culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā haere i tere te whakatika i a rātau e noho ana ki rāwāhi (Travelers quickly adjust to their new surroundings):** The passage actually says the opposite – it's *difficult* to adjust back to the old culture.
* **C: Ngā haere e noho tonu ana i te wāhanga mārō (Travelers remain in a marginal position):** While there might be a sense of being in-between, the main point isn't about remaining marginal, but about the difficulty of returning.
* **D: Ngā haere me te iti iho te manawanui (Travelers have less spiritual faith):** The passage discusses spiritual faith as something valuable for travelers returning home, so this is incorrect.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei me karo te tangata i te mahi i te moose?,"The correct answer is **A: E mōhio ana ki to rātau aroaro (Knowing their limits)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te Pihiringa (e mōhiotia ana hoki ko te Eoka) e tino riri, engari ka whawhai tonu mēnā ka taka ki te raru. Ki te kore te tangata e kite i te mōrearea pea o te muhi, ka whakatata rawa pea rātou, ka mōrearea."" 
* **Translation:** ""The moose (also known as the Eoka) is very irritable, but it will continue to fight if it falls into a rut. If people don't recognize the danger of the rut, they might provoke it, and it will become aggressive.""
* **The key takeaway:** The passage warns about provoking a moose that is in rut (a state of heightened aggression). It emphasizes that *not knowing their limits* (aroro - limits/boundaries) is dangerous. If you don't understand how far you can push a moose, you risk provoking it.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: He pōturi rawa te haere (It's a dark journey):** While darkness might add to the danger, the main concern is the moose's behavior due to being in rut.
* **C: Whakamōkito ana i tō rātou taumata tuma tūpono (Maintaining their level of alertness):** Being alert is always a good idea when around wildlife, but it doesn't directly address the moose's aggressive state during rut.
* **D: E mātaki ana i a rātou i tētahi tawhiti (Keeping a distance):** Maintaining distance is generally wise, but the passage highlights the danger of *provocation* more than simply being close.



Therefore, **A: E mōhio ana ki to rātau aroaro (Knowing their limits)** is the best answer because it directly relates to the passage's warning about provoking a moose in rut."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te moose ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: He kararehe whakatuki noa rātau (They are simply opportunistic)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a moose as being initially shy but fighting back when threatened.** This implies a defensive behavior, not opportunistic.
* **B: I ētahi wā kāore rātau i te mōhiotia he tuma tūpono (They are sometimes not perceived as a threat).** This aligns with the passage, which states that if people don't see the moose's threat, they might not react, and the moose might then become aggressive.
* **C: Ka taea e rātau te whakaohotia e ngā tāngata e tata ana ki a rātau (They can be provoked by people who are close to them).** The passage implies that the moose will react to *perceived* threat, which could include proximity.
* **D: Ka tiaki rātau i a rātau anō mehemea e hiahiatia ana (They protect themselves if necessary).** This is directly supported by the passage's statement that the moose will fight back when threatened.

Therefore, the statement that moose are ""simply opportunistic"" is the least accurate description based on the given text. The passage highlights their defensive response to perceived danger.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei te iti rawa o te mōrearea mo te haere koraha?","The correct answer is **A: Te kore kakahu mahana i te pō makariri**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He mōrearea tūturu te hauhauaitu i te korenga o ngā kākahu mahana"" which translates to ""The shepherd is very worried about the lack of warm clothes.""  This directly indicates that the lack of warm clothing is a significant concern and source of worry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Te kite i te mirage e tuku ana i te whakaaro o te wai:** While the mirage is mentioned, the passage focuses on the practical concern of the lack of warm clothing, not the illusion of water.
* **C: E whai ana i te pūngao i a ia e whai ana i te mirage:** This describes the shepherd following the mirage, a secondary action, not the core worry.
* **D: E horoi ana i te wai i a ia e whai ana i te mirage:** This describes collecting water from the mirage, also a secondary action and not the primary worry.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kōrerotia hei tuma tūpono mō ngā haere koraha?,"The correct answer is **A: Iti wai (Small water)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the dangers of cold weather and how it can lead to hypothermia. It mentions the need for proper clothing to prevent hypothermia and the danger of frostbite.  

* **Mirages:** The passage states that mirages can indicate the presence of water, which could be a navigational hazard.
* **Hypothermia:**  The passage explicitly mentions hypothermia as a risk.
* **Frostbite:** The passage mentions that frostbite can occur without warm clothing.

""Iti wai"" (small water) isn't mentioned as a risk or concern in the passage. The focus is on the dangers of the cold itself, not on the presence or absence of small bodies of water.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea te iwi whānui o te rōpū i tino pāngia i muri i te taenga mai o nga kaitoro?","The correct answer is **C: Te Taínos**.

The passage explicitly states: ""E ai ki Fray Bartolome de las Casas (Tratado de las Indias) i waenganui i te tau 492 me te tau 1498 ka whakamatea tata ki te 100,000 Tainos e ngā toa Pāniora."" This translates to ""According to Fray Bartolome de las Casas (Treaty of the Indies) between the years 492 and 1498, nearly 100,000 Tainos were killed by the Spanish warriors.""  Therefore, the Taínos were the group most severely impacted by the arrival of the colonizers.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea te reo i kōrerotia e nga Caribes?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""He hunga kōrero-Arawakan ngā Caribes..."" which translates to ""The Caribes spoke an Arawakan language...""
"
Ko wai e taea te tāwere ki te hīrere e paingia ana hei mahi whakangahau?,"The correct answer is **A: Ski bums**. 

Here's why:

The text describes ""reti nono"" (skiing) as a sport involving downhill movement on snow, using skis attached to boots. The term ""ski bum"" is a colloquial term for someone who lives a transient lifestyle centered around skiing, often working part-time to afford the cost of skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Nga Nōwei (Norwegians):** While the text mentions Norwegians establishing the first ski club in Australia, it doesn't say they *ski* as a form of recreation.
*   **C: Ngā kainoho Ana (Aboriginal people):** The text mentions skiing being an ancient practice, but doesn't link it specifically to Aboriginal people.
*   **D: Nga Ahitereiria (Australians):** While Australia is where the first ski club was established, the text doesn't say Australians *ski* as a form of recreation.

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te wā i mōhiotia tuatahitia ai he tākaro?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The text states: ""He tawhito rawa te ariā o te eke rēti - kei te kitea he toi ana e whakaatu ana i ngā kaieke rēti mai rā anō i te 5000 BC!"" (The art of retirement dating back is very old - art depicting elderly retirees has been found dating back to 5000 BC!)

While the other options are mentioned as points in the history of retirement, 5000 BC is the earliest date mentioned for the *art* depicting retirees, implying the activity itself is even older.
"
Ko tehea o ēnei e pā ana ki te motu nui rawa atu i te takutai o Awherika ki te rawhiti?,"The correct answer is **C: Waiora**.

The passage states: ""Ko Marakāhia te mea nui rawa, ā, he paparahi ki tōna kotahi e hāngai ana ki ngā kararehe mohoao."" This translates to ""Maragascar is the most important island, and it has a single species that is linked to flightless birds.""

Therefore, Madagascar is the largest island in the Indian Ocean, off the coast of Africa to the west.
"
He aha te mea ehara i te āhuatanga o ngā motu iti o Awherika ki te Rāwhiti? ,"The correct answer is **B: He maha nga tauranga whai hua (Many commercial ports)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""He whenua motuhake te nuinga o ngā motu iti iho, he hononga ki Wīwī rānei, ā, kei te mōhiotia hei wāhi whakatā taha moana hāneanea rawa."" This means most of the small islands are independent or linked to Seychelles and are known as strategic maritime staging posts. This implies they *don't* have many commercial ports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He tūhononga ki te France (Linked to France):** The text mentions Mayotte, which is a French overseas department. This is true for *some* of the islands.
* **C: He rongo mo te waiora (Known for medicinal plants):** The text mentions Mauritius being known for its unique plants used in traditional medicine. This is true for *some* of the islands.
* **D: Rangatiratanga i ētahi atu iwi (Independence from other groups):** The text states most islands are independent. This is true for *some* of the islands.

Therefore, the statement that is *not* a characteristic of the small islands in the western part of Africa, according to the text, is that they have many commercial ports.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te hākari a te Aranga e ētahi hāhi tūturu?","The correct answer is **B: E taurima ana i tētahi whakatūpato pō Hātarei**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ko ngā whare karakia tūturu ake o mua ka mau tonu ki te Easter Vigil i te pō o te Hatarei i te wā o te mutunga wiki Aranga..."" which translates to ""The more established churches still hold to the Easter Vigil on the Saturday night of Holy Week...""



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te pupuri i tētahi tikanga kōkā** (Maintaining a traditional custom) - While it *is* a tradition, the text highlights the specific connection to the Easter Vigil.
* **C: Te whakahaere i tētahi pō hararei mō te whakaminenga** (Holding a holiday for worship) -  While it involves worship, the specific event being referenced is the Easter Vigil, not a general holiday.
* **D: E mātakitaki ana i te whitinga** (Observing the planting) - This is completely unrelated to the text's content, which focuses on the Easter Vigil and the resurrection of Christ.



"
"Hei karo i ētahi whakaritenga ina tomo ki Ecuador, me whai aha tētahi tangata whenua Cuban i te tuatahi?","The correct answer is **C: He tiikiti haere whakamuri hei whakaatu i te roa o te noho** (A return ticket to show the length of stay).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Uruwhenua mō ngā marama e 6 neke atu i tō wā haerere."" which translates to ""A visa for more than 6 months of stay.""

The question asks what a Cuban national should do *to avoid restrictions* when entering Ecuador. The text explicitly states a visa is needed for stays longer than 6 months.

Option C, ""He tiikiti haere whakamuri hei whakaatu i te roa o te noho"" (A return ticket to show the length of stay), is *part* of the requirements but not the *primary* requirement for a visa for longer than 6 months.  While a return ticket is helpful, the crucial element is the visa itself. The text emphasizes the *duration of stay* and the *visa requirement* for exceeding 6 months.

Therefore, a return ticket is a helpful addition, but the main requirement to avoid restrictions is a visa that covers the length of the intended stay, and the text indicates this visa is required for stays over 6 months.

However, among the given options, the one that most directly addresses the need to show the length of stay is option C. Options A, B, and D are not as directly relevant to the question.
"
He aha ngā whakaritenga haere a Ecuador kāore i hoahoatia?,"The correct answer is **C: E whakaū ana i te roanga o te haere** (It specifies the duration of the trip).

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Uruwhenua mō ngā marama e 6 neke atu i tō wā haerere"" which translates to ""Visa for a period of 6 months or more than the duration of the trip"". This confirms the duration of the trip is a requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kei te pupuri i te maha o ngā haere ki te mōkito** (It restricts the number of trips to the volcano): The text doesn't mention any restrictions on the number of trips to a volcano.
*   **B: Te pupuri i tētahi rerenga rerenga whakariterite** (It requires a specific itinerary): The text doesn't mention a specific itinerary being required.
*   **D: E whakarite ana i te mana uruwhenua** (It guarantees visa approval): The text states that a visa *may* be granted if the requirements are met, but it doesn't guarantee approval.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka nui ake te utu i te whenua ke i te kāinga?,"The answer is **C: inihua kitenga**.

Here's why:

The prompt states: ""ko ētahi he tāruatanga noa iho, ā ko ngā mea tūturu kua kawea mai ka nui ake pea te utu i te utu ki te kāinga."" This translates to: ""some are just intangible, and the tangible things brought back may be more expensive than the cost to the home.""

* **Inihua kitenga (tourism)** falls under the category of ""tangible things brought back"" that could potentially be more expensive than simply staying at home.  Travel costs, accommodation, and experiences can add up.
* **Ngā whakamātautau whatu (wheat tests)** and **Ngā tāpare mutunga-teitei (high-end fabrics)** are not mentioned in the context of potentially costing more than staying at home.
* **Ngā tāpare ingoa-kore (generic fabrics)** are likely cheaper than more specialized or imported goods, thus wouldn't fit the description of costing more.



Therefore, tourism (inihua kitenga) is the most likely answer.



"
He aha ngā mōrearea ka taea e te hoko i ngā anga teitei i tētahi whenua kē?,"The correct answer is **A: E hiahiatia ana pea tētahi whakamātautau whatu tāpiri (Additional quality testing may be required)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses concerns about the quality of products from countries with lower labor costs and potentially less stringent regulations. It mentions:

* **Lower cost of labor:** This suggests a potential for lower quality control.
* **Need for quarantine and testing:** This implies concerns about potential contamination or substandard products.
* **Quality issues with large-scale imports:**  The passage specifically mentions two issues: minor issues and major issues where the cost of the imported goods may exceed the cost of returning them.

Therefore, the most logical consequence of importing from countries with lower standards is the need for additional quality checks to ensure safety and meet required specifications.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kāore pea te rongoā i te tika mō ētahi tāpare (Medicine may not be suitable for some conditions):** While potential for unsuitable medicine is a concern with imports, the passage's focus is broader than just medicine.
* **C: He rūpahu pea (It may be a shortage):** The passage doesn't suggest a shortage of goods, but a concern about their quality.
* **D: Kāore pea te Inihua e taupoki i te utu (The Insurance may not cover the cost):**  While insurance coverage might be an issue, the passage doesn't directly state this. The primary concern is the quality of the imported goods.



"
"E pā ana ki te whakamahi moni i nga Moutere o Falklands, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e tika ana?","The correct answer is **C: Me whakawhiti nga pauna o Falkland i muri i te mahue i nga motu.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ko te pūtea tūturu ki te whēnua Falklands ko pāuna Faulkland (FKP), ko tōna wāriu e taurite ana ki te tāra o Ingarangi (GBP). **Kāore nei tonu e taea te whakawhiti i te pūtea Falklands ki waho atu o te moutere, nā reira me whakawhiti koe i ō moni i mua i tō wehenga i ngā motu.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ko ngā kāri nama me ngā pauna Ingarangi anake e whakaaetia ana i runga i ngā motu tawhiti:** The text says credit cards are accepted in Stanley and US money is accepted, though you need to check beforehand.  It's not an exclusive list.
* **B: Ko Stanley anake te wāhi e whakaae ana ki te tāra o Amerika:** The text says US money is accepted in Stanley.
* **D: I tua atu i te pauna o Falkland, ko te pauna o Ingarangi te moni tino whakaaetia:** While the Pound Sterling is *accepted*, the text doesn't say it's the *most* accepted.  It simply states that both the Falkland Pound and the Pound Sterling are accepted.



"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga nei, ina haere ana ki nga Moutere o Falklands mai i te United States, i hea ka tino whai hua ai tētahi momo utu i tua atu i te kāri nama?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te pātaka FIC West**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te whakawhiti i ngā moni ki ngā moutere, kei Stanley, kei tua mai i te toa FIC West."" This directly indicates that the FIC West building is a place where currency exchange (and therefore potentially alternative payment methods to credit cards) is available.

The passage also mentions credit cards are widely accepted in Stanley, but advises checking beforehand for remote islands and explicitly states you can't exchange Falklands money outside the islands. Therefore, FIC West is the most likely place to find a payment option beyond credit cards when arriving from the United States.

Ko tehea huihuinga e kore e honoa ki te whakanui i nga hakari o te temepara?,"The correct answer is **A: Te whānautanga o te arewhana (The birth of the deity)**.

Here's why:

The text states that most temple festivals are tied to the temple's annual calendar, the deity's birthday, or other significant times related to that temple's specific period.  The text explicitly mentions *temperate change* as a common reason. While the birth of a deity *could* be related to a temple's calendar, it's not as directly and universally linked to the *annual* calendar as the other options are. The other options (temple change, deity's birthday, and major temple events) are all directly related to the established annual cycles of the temple.
"
Ki hea kitea ai ngā arewhana rākaitia?,"The correct answer is **B: I roto i nga temepara (In the temples)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...kitea hoki o ngā arewhana kua whakapaingia **me ngā pūoro o te temepara** me ngā ahurei kē atu hoki."" ( ...and see also the consecrated idols and the temple bells and other rituals.) This directly indicates the idols are found within the temples.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei te huarahi tino tika ki te whakaora moni i runga i ngā tīkiti rererangi o te umanga, o te akomanga tuatahi rānei?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te utu mā tō kamupene**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the most effective way to get preferential treatment on flights (especially for business or first class) is to have your company pay for the tickets. It explicitly mentions that it's often more expensive than just paying the regular fare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: E tāpui ana i te tauaha tuatahi, kaua ko te umanga:** The passage says first class is more expensive than regular fares, but it *doesn't* say that first class is cheaper than business class.
*   **C: E tāpui ana i tētahi rere o te karaehe tuatahi kāore i te hāngai:** This is irrelevant and not supported by the passage. The passage talks about generally upgrading and not specific flights.
*   **D: Kimi ana i tētahi whakahekenga utu:** While seeking fare discounts *can* be a strategy, the passage frames company-paid tickets as the *most* effective, implying it's a superior option.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te moumou wā hei rapu ina tāpui i ētahi akoranga utu?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā rerenga hāngai (Cargo routes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In most cases, there is no simple calculation of fees for business routes, first flights or direct routes from A to B.""  It then goes on to say that airlines are a group of people who prefer to pay a high fee to get there quickly and to another place, and that the payment will be the same.  This implies that the price is determined by the *route* itself – the cargo routes, in this case – rather than a fixed formula.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tauaha pakihi (Business Year):** While business operations are involved, the passage doesn't focus on a specific business year.
* **C: Ngā Whakahekenga (Negotiations):** The passage *mentions* negotiations as part of the payment process (""...payment is the same""), but it doesn't say the route is *negotiated*.
* **D: tauaha tuatahi (First Flight):**  The passage refers to ""first flights,"" but the core point is that the route influences the price, not just the fact that it's a first flight.



"
He aha te mea e kore e hiahiatia kia tāpirihia ina whakataurite ana i te utu katoa mō Āwherika me te utu huri noa i te ao?,"The correct answer is **A: Te utu o ngā visa anō mō ngā wāhi ki waho o Āwherika**.

Here's why:

The question asks what isn't needed when calculating the *total* cost of travel to Africa *and* the round-the-world fare. The provided text already mentions including extra costs like ""pane uruwhenua (entry fees), tāke wehe (exit taxes), ikiiki ā-whenua (local taxes), aha atu (etc.)"" for locations *outside* of Africa.

Visa costs are a separate expense that would apply to destinations *outside* of Africa, but not specifically to travel *to* Africa itself. The round-the-world fare is a single price, and visa costs are generally *in addition* to that fare, not something that should be included *within* it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Te utu o ngā takoha haerenga i Āwherika (Travel package costs in Africa):** These would be part of the total cost of travel *to* Africa.
*   **C: Utu mo te visa o Āwherika (Visa costs for Africa):**  This is irrelevant to the round-the-world fare as it only covers the destination, not the entire journey.
*   **D: Te utu o te haerenga whenua mō ngā tauwāhi i waho o Āwherika (Ground travel costs for stays outside Africa):** These are extra costs that should be included, as per the text.

Therefore, visa costs for destinations *outside* of Africa are the expenses that wouldn't be included when calculating the total cost of travel to Africa *and* a round-the-world fare.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā hokomaha e tīmata ana ki te tuku i tētahi tīpakonga rerekē ake?","The correct answer is **A: Kai kua rite (Pre-prepared food)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei te piki haere te whiwhi o ngā hokomaha i te kōwhiringa whānui ake o ngā kai kua whakaritea kētia.""  This translates to: ""The demand for supermarkets is increasing for a wider range of pre-prepared food.""  Therefore, supermarkets are starting to offer a wider variety of pre-prepared foods.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā oumu ngaruiti (Ovens)** - The passage mentions ovens in the context of warming food, but it doesn't say supermarkets are offering ovens.
*   **C: Nga wharekai kei runga i te waahi (Restaurants in the area)** - While restaurants exist, the focus of the passage is on supermarket offerings.
*   **D: Ngā utu utu nui (High prices)** - The passage indicates the opposite - that supermarkets are increasingly attractive due to lower prices.



"
He aha ngā mea e whakaratohia ana e ētahi toa hokohoko e pai ai ki te kiritaki e hoko ana i ngā kai kua oti te hanga?,"The correct answer is **D: He oumu ngaruiti (Ovens/Warmers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kei ētahi he ngaruiti, he mea kē rānei hei whakamahana kai."" (Some have ovens, or something else to heat the food). This directly links ovens/warmers to the provision of heating for pre-made food sold at markets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nga wharekai kei runga i te waahi (Restaurants on site):** While some markets *might* have restaurants, the passage focuses on the *lack* of restaurants and the need for warming solutions for pre-made food.  Restaurants are not the primary solution being discussed.
* **B: Tīpakonga rerekē iti iho (Small, varied snacks):**  The passage doesn't mention snacks. It focuses on prepared meals.
* **C: Ngā kai mata (Ready-to-eat meals):** While ready-to-eat meals are being sold, the question asks what a *market stall* provides to *heat* them. The passage indicates the need for heating solutions like ovens.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kōrero e kore e mārama ki ngā Pirihi me ngā Swiss e kōrero ana i te reo Wīwī?,"The correct answer is **D: Ko te nuinga o te reo Wīwī e kōrerohia ana i Wīwī (Most of the Māori language spoken in Wīwī)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while there are differences in Māori spoken in different regions (Paratiamu, Huiterangi, Parani, and Wīwī), the Belgian and Swiss speakers have learned to understand and communicate with people from Wīwī using a simplified form.  This implies that the *most* common or standard form of Māori spoken in Wīwī might not be universally understood by everyone, including the Belgians and Swiss. The other options are specifically mentioned as things that *are* clarified and understood.



"
"Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei, kāore i te ōrite i Wīwī me te mea kei Wīwī, i Pīkihi rānei?","The correct answer is **D: Te takikupu o ētahi kupu Wīwī**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...heoi anō, Kāore e kore e kore e akongia te tūapapa ki te Wīwi i te kura e ngā hunga Belgian me te swiss e āhei ana te kōrero Wīwī, nō reira kua mōhio rātou ki te mārama i a koe me koe i whakamahi noa i te pūnaha reo Wīwī māmā mō te kaute. **Te takikupu o ētahi kupu Wīwī** e rerekē ana i te reo Wīwī e kōrerotia ana ki Wīwī.""

This translates to: ""...however, the standard is not being applied to Wīwī in schools by Belgian and Swiss speakers who are allowed to speak Wīwī, so they are aware and you can use a simplified Wīwī language for protection. **The spelling of some Wīwī words** is different from the Wīwī spoken in Wīwī.""

The passage focuses on how the *spelling* or *orthography* of some words differs, implying it's a difference in the *words themselves* rather than a general merging, the translation system, or the acceptance in schools.



"
I roto i tehea āhuatanga kaore pea koe e whakawhiwhia ki te utu mo te mate?,"The correct answer is **B: Mēnā ka ngana koe ki te tono tika ki te kamupene rererangi, kaua ki tētahi ratonga tuatoru.**

Here's why:

The prompt states that airlines like WestJet offer tiered pricing for funeral travel, aiming to reduce costs. However, it also emphasizes the importance of *directly* contacting the airline.  Options A, C, and D all describe situations where tiered pricing *might* be applicable (WestJet, Lufthansa flights from Paris to the US, and Delta).  The key is that the prompt is telling you to check *directly* with the airline, not through a third-party service. Option B directly reflects this advice.
"
He aha te pono mo nga utu whakangahau?,"The correct answer is **A: E taupoki ana rātau i te utu o te haerenga nehunga.**

Here's why:

The provided text states the tiered pricing is a way to reduce costs for last-minute travel. It then lists airlines that offer this.  The text *also* explicitly says: ""I ngā wā katoa, me whakarite e koe mā te waea tōtika atu ki te kamupene rererangi."" (Always make sure to call the airline directly.)

Therefore, the tiered pricing *includes* the base fare of the flight. Options B and C are not supported by the text. Option D simply reiterates a point already made in the text.
"
He aha te wā e pai ake ai te whakamahi i tētahi pūrere GPS motuhake i tētahi taupānga whakatere GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: Ina puta koe i te awhe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He aha te wā e pai ake ai te whakamahi i tētahi pūrere GPS motuhake i tētahi taupānga whakatere GPS?"" (When is it better to use a standalone GPS device instead of a GPS app?)
* **The passage also states:** ""Ina kei waho koe i tō whenua kāinga...kei waho rānei ia i te wāhi pā, ka whakawhāititia pea te mahi, kāore rānei i te wātea."" (If you are abroad...or even in a remote area, the function may be limited, or there may be no signal.)
* **Therefore, a standalone GPS is best when you're in a remote area (awhe) where phone GPS might not work.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ina ngana koe ki te tiaki moni:** While standalone GPS devices can be expensive, that's not the primary reason to choose one *over* an app.
* **B: Ina mōhio koe ka whai hononga raraunga koe:** If you know you'll have a data connection, a phone GPS app will likely work fine.
* **D: Ina kāore koe e hiahia ki te rēti i tētahi pūrere:** The point of a GPS device is to *not* need to rely on a phone or network.



"
He aha te take e kore ai e pai te whakamahi i tētahi taupānga whakatere GPS hei utu mō tētahi pūrere motuhake?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore e hiahiatia ana kia hoko mahere hōu**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that using a phone's GPS for navigation is a cost-effective alternative to buying new maps for a dedicated GPS device, a standalone GPS unit, or subscriptions from a navigation company. Option D directly reflects this saving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kāore e hiahiatia kia manukanuka mō tētahi hononga raraunga (It doesn't need a data connection):** While true for *some* GPS apps, the main point is about cost savings, not the data requirement.
*   **B: Tiaki moni ana (It saves money):** This is true, but D is a more specific and accurate reason *why* it saves money - because you don't need to buy new maps.
*   **C: Kei te karo i ngā rēti (It avoids tolls):** This is irrelevant to GPS navigation.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me pēhea koe e whakaū ai e ōrite ana koe ki tētahi kaipuke tika?","The correct answer is **C: E tāpui ana ki tētahi māngai e tohu ana i te haerenga o Galapagos.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ko te kaiwhakarite e whakarite ana i tō haerenga ko tētahi mātanga Galapagos me te mōhiohio pai o te whānuitanga o ngā kaipuke. **Mā konā e whakarite kia tūhonotia ō aronga, ō here hoki/rānei ki te kaipuke e tino hāngai ana ki ēnā.**"" (The tour operator arranges your trip to be a Galapagos experience with a good understanding of the range of ships. **This ensures that your itinerary, return dates/etc. are matched to a ship that is highly suitable for it.**)

* Option C directly reflects this: being informed by a guide who knows the Galapagos trips. This guide would be able to recommend the right ship for your needs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te tono i roto i tētahi rōpū o ngā pāhihi 8+ he rite ō rātou hiahia** - The passage doesn't mention group sizes or the needs of 8+ passengers.
* **B: E tāpui ana i te wā iti** -  The passage doesn't mention short trips.
* **D: Kei te tāpui tōmua** - While it's good to know the ship in advance, the passage emphasizes the *recommendation* by a knowledgeable guide.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore e whakamahia hei āhuatanga hai pupuri i te peti manuhiri?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā tohutohu pēnei i ngā tīkiti kōnohete koreutu (Information such as non-refundable tickets)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how hosts try to make guests comfortable and stay longer by providing:

*   Food
*   Drinks
*   Special activities
*   Care to keep guests healthy.
*   Sometimes, a gift of water.

The passage explicitly states that it is difficult to find wine, or even a menu. This implies a lack of structured information for guests. Non-refundable tickets are a financial transaction, not a hospitality measure aimed at making a guest *stay* longer or feel welcomed.  They are about the *purchase* of the experience, not the *experience itself*.

The other options are mentioned in the passage as things that *are* offered to guests:

*   **A: He nui tonu te mārama māori (Lots of Maori information)** - While not explicitly detailed, the mention of Maori information suggests an effort to provide cultural context.
*   **C: Ngā inu ā-rua (Soft drinks)** -  Mentioned as a type of drink offered.
*   **D: Kāore he karaka (No menu)** - Mentioned as a difficulty in finding information.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tikanga kia karohia e te tūpāpaku atamai?","The correct answer is **A: He nui rawa te inu waipiro**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tērā ētahi hingonga ka koha atu i te inu waipiro."" (Then some guests would offer water.) This indicates that offering water is a common practice and therefore a good custom for a thoughtful host.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kei te whakaae ki ētahi tohutohu:** The passage doesn't mention agreeing to any guidelines.
* **C: Taki ana i ngā karaka, matawā rānei:** The passage specifically mentions a *lack* of wine and spirits, and difficulty finding drinks, so offering those isn't the focus.
* **D: E pātai ana mō te putanga tata rawa:** The passage states that finding drinks was difficult, not that guests were asking about nearby stores.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea wāhanga o te whaikōrero e whakapūmatuatia ana i waenganui i te rerenga?","The correct answer is **A: Kupumahi**.

The passage states: ""Ko ngā kupu ingoa katoa, tae atu ki te kupu Sie mōu, ka tīmata ki te pūmatua, ahakoa kei waenganui i te rerenga. He ara hira tēnei hei whakawehe i waenga i ētahi **kupu mahi** me ngā aronga."" This translates to: ""All the nouns, including the word 'Sie mōu', begin with the pūmatua, even though they are in the middle of the peak. This is a tricky path to distinguish between some **verbs** and nouns.""

Therefore, the passage specifically mentions verbs (""kupu mahi"") being differentiated from nouns (""ngā aronga"") in the middle of the peak (rerenga).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha pea ka uaua ake te pūmatuatanga o nga nouns?","The correct answer is **B: Whakawehe ana i waenga i ngā kupumahi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He ara hira tēnei hei whakawehe i waenga i ētahi kupu mahi me ngā aronga."" (This is a tricky path to distinguish between some verbs and nouns.)

This directly indicates that the difficulty lies in the distinction *between verbs and nouns*. Options A, C, and D are mentioned, but not as the primary challenge regarding nouns. The core difficulty is in differentiating nouns from verbs.



"
"""I ngā wāhi tawhiti o Mareia, ko tēhea tohu ā-ringa ko te tikanga """"kua mutu""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Kei te tuku i ngā kōnui ki runga** (To offer a salute upwards).

Here's why:

The passage describes a specific custom among Māori people in certain rural areas.  It says ""haere mai"" (welcome) is expressed by a gesture like a ""kōroa"" (a finger-to-the-nose gesture).  It then goes on to describe a *different* gesture used by travelers from Britain to Spain – a salute to the hand.

The question asks about the gesture that signifies ""it is finished"" (or, more accurately in the context, ""farewell"") in remote parts of Māori society. The passage implies this is the *opposite* of the ""haere mai"" gesture. Since the passage doesn't explicitly state it, we have to infer from the description of the British/Spanish custom. The phrase ""to offer a salute upwards"" is the closest equivalent described in the provided options and the most logical inference for a farewell gesture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kei te tārewa i te matimati taupū** (To be reflected in the hourly matimati) - This is nonsensical in this context.
* **B: Kei te haere** (To go) - This describes movement, not a farewell.
* **C: Kei te whiwhi i te teitei** (To obtain the height) -  This is metaphorical and doesn't relate to gestures of farewell.



Therefore, **D** is the most appropriate answer."
"""E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tohu e tohu ana i te """"hoki mai""""?""","The correct answer is **A: E anga ana ki te kapu e anga whakaroto ana (It involves a hand that extends)**.

The passage states: ""...ko te tikanga ko te """"haere mai"""", pērā ki te kōroa e piko ana ki te tinana, arā, he tuone e whakamahia ana ki ētahi whenua ā-Uru, ā, me whakamahi anake mō taua take. Ka pērā anō, ka pōhēhē pea te tangata hāereere nō Peretānia ki Pāniora ko te ringaringa hei poroporoaki ko te kapu e aro ana ki te tangata ringaringa (kaua ki te tangata e ringaringahia ana) hei tuone mō te hoki mai.""

This translates to: ""...the custom is to say """"welcome"""", like a hand-shake that is pressed to the body, that is, a gesture used in some Pacific countries, and it should only be used for that purpose. Similarly, a traveller from Britain to Spain might shake hands for farewell, but the gesture for welcome is a hand that extends (not a hand that is shaken) to say welcome.""

Therefore, the ""welcome"" gesture is indicated by an **extending hand (kapu e anga whakaroto ana)**.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te take o te tahu?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā ana hukapapa mahi (The workings of the glaciers)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the glacial meltwater (tahu) flows down the mountain, carving out valleys, creating potholes, and potentially revealing hidden things. It also mentions the movement of ice, rocks, and debris. This all relates to the *workings* and processes of the glacier itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā arawhata huka (Wooden levers)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Ngā pūhihi tē taea te whakawātea (Reusable containers)** - This is irrelevant to the passage's description of glacial activity.
* **D: Ngā paraka loose (Loose rocks)** - While loose rocks are mentioned as being moved by the glacier, the passage focuses on the overall processes and workings, not just the rocks themselves.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e taea te huna e nga arawhata hukarere?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā Whāwhā (The crevasses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka hunaia pea e ngā piriti ā-hukapapa ngā tawhā."" This translates to ""The ice spirits might hide the crevasses."" Therefore, the passage directly links ice spirits to hiding crevasses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā ana Ice (The Ice Walls):** While ice walls exist, the passage doesn't specifically mention ice spirits hiding them.
*   **C: Ngā pātū (The Ice Caves):**  The passage refers to the ice breaking and falling, not the formation of caves.
*   **D: Ngā paraka nui (Large Ice Shelves):**  The passage focuses on the crevasses (tawhā) within the ice, not the large shelves themselves.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, me whiwhi whakatūpato tāpiri ngā haere i mua i te toro atu ki tēhea tauwāhi?","The correct answer is **A: Te puia o Nyiragongo**.

The passage explicitly states that Goma was devastated by the eruption of Nyiragongo volcano in 2002. Therefore, any trip to Goma should consider the possibility of the Nyiragongo eruption.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ngā wāhi e karapoti ana i Goma:** While it's good to be aware of dangerous areas, the eruption of Nyiragongo is the specific event mentioned as a major concern impacting Goma.
*   **C: Te pokapū o te taone:** The destruction of the town center is *a result* of the eruption, but the eruption itself is the primary concern for travelers.
*   **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is a neighboring country, but the passage focuses on dangers *within* Goma and the surrounding area, particularly related to the volcano.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e pai ki te tūruhi i Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: He whakangahau ngā whawhai i Kivu ki te Raki (The conflicts in North Kivu are a deterrent).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that while Goma is relatively safe, it's important to research the security situation outside the city due to ongoing conflict in North Kivu.** This directly implies that the conflicts *are* a deterrent and make travel less desirable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He wāhi pai mō te whai i te Gorilla Mountain i te utu tika (It's a good place to hike Gorilla Mountain at a fair price):** The passage mentions that Goma is the base for climbing Nyiragongo and that there are affordable volcanic hikes in Africa.  Gorilla Mountain hiking is a known activity in the region.
* **C: He huarahi pai ngā tāke motopaika ki te haere (Motorbikes are a good way to get around):** The passage directly states that you *can* take boda-boda (motorbikes) to get around Goma and provides a price for short trips.
* **D: Kei te taone te turanga o te puia o Nyiragongo (The base for climbing Nyiragongo is in the city):**  The passage states that Goma is the *base* for climbing Nyiragongo.



"
Ahea ka wātea ai tētahi whakaaetanga mō tētahi rā tīmata i te marama o Akuhata?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 o Hānuere**.

The text clearly states: ""Tētahi whakaaetanga tuawhenua mō ngā rā tīmata katoa i te marama o Mei. Nā reira, ka wātea mai hei te rā 1 o Hānuere tētahi whakaaetanga tuawhenua mō ngā rā tīmata katoa i te marama o Mei."" This translates to: ""A backcountry permit for all dates in the month of May. Therefore, a backcountry permit will be available on January 1st for all dates in the month of May.""
"
He aha te kaupapahere e noho ana hei pare i te awa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka taea anake te whiwhi whakaaetanga mā ngā tono haere-i roto.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ngā whakaaetanga kua rāhuingia mō ngā tono hīkoi-mai i te āhuatanga ki te taenga mai tuatahi mai."" (Permits have been reserved for walk-up requests to the trailhead for the first come, first served.) This means you can *only* get a permit by requesting it in advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He haere tuatahi mai, i te tuatahi i mahi i te pūnaha whakaae:** While ""first come, first served"" is mentioned, it doesn't describe the *system* used to manage permits. It's a *method* of distribution.
* **B: Kei te wātea anake ngā whakaaetanga i te 1 o Hānuere:** The permits become available on January 1st, but they are then used for the *entire* month of May.
* **D: He iti noa iho ngā whakaaetanga:** The text describes the permits as being reserved for popular trails, suggesting they are *not* scarce.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e iti rawa te kitea i te momo hotera e whakaahuatia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā rūma kātahi anō ka whakakāhoretia me ngā whakamohoa hōu (Newly renovated suites with new furnishings)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes old-fashioned hotels with antique furnishings, outdated equipment, and a certain rustic charm. It emphasizes the historical nature of these hotels. Options A, B, and C (a dive bar, a gourmet restaurant onsite, and well-known/renowned guests) are all things that *could* be found in a hotel, even a historic one, and wouldn't necessarily contradict the description. However, ""Newly renovated suites with new furnishings"" directly clashes with the description of antique furnishings and the old-fashioned nature of the hotels. They are the *opposite* of what the passage describes.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i whakaaturia i roto i te whārangi, ko tehea o ngā tuku e whai ake nei ka iti rawa te tūponotanga o ngā manuhiri hotera","The correct answer is **A: Ngā whakarato ārai puta noa i te āhuatanga (Basic lodging with no-frills amenities)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes these hotels as being popular with travelers and often hosting parties. It also mentions they were old-fashioned and lacked modern conveniences. This suggests they were relatively basic accommodations.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: He wharekai whai kaihoko tino mōhiotia (A highly regarded restaurant):** While some hotels might have had good restaurants, the passage doesn't emphasize this. The focus is on lodging and socializing.
* **C: He whakangahau pō e whakahere ana i te pō (Evening entertainment with a specific program):** The passage mentions parties, but doesn't suggest a structured, programed entertainment.
* **D: Ngā mokatere o te rūma utu nui (Large-scale, luxurious rooms):** The passage explicitly states these hotels were old-fashioned and lacked modern conveniences. Luxurious rooms would contradict this description.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, eaha te tia ia apehia e te mau ratere e mataitai ra i Greenland?","The correct answer is **A: Ko ētahi wāhi e mōhiotia ana mō ngā mokatere hara tiketike.**

The text explicitly states: ""Ko te haurere makariri pea te mōrearea tūturu anake ka arohia e te hunga kāore i whakaritea."" This translates to: ""The cold weather might only be appreciated by those who are not prepared.""  Later it says: ""Kaore i te tino mōhiotia te taihara me te kaikino whānui ki te hunga nō rāwaho ki Whenua Kākāriki.""  This translates to: ""The lack of humidity and large insects are not really appreciated by those visiting Greenland.""

While the other options touch on aspects of Greenland, they aren't the *primary* danger highlighted in this specific section. Option A directly addresses a danger experienced by unprepared visitors.



Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Te kawe mai i ngā kakahu taumaha, nā te mea he mahana te āhuarangi i te tau katoa** - The text actually advises *bringing* warm clothes, not because it's warm year-"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e tino raruraru ana mō ngā haere kāore anō kia rite ki Greenland?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā waeroa o Nōroa (The challenges of the North)**.

Here's why:

The passage details several challenges for visitors to Greenland, specifically mentioning:

*   **Lack of ""safe spaces""**: Outside of towns.
*   **Extreme weather**: Including potentially dangerous freezing rain.
*   **Difficulty with hunting and fishing**: Not well-understood by outsiders.
*   **Seasonal changes**:  Cold nights in summer, potential for overheating in summer, and Nordic mists that can be disorienting.
*   **The need for warm, layered clothing**: Regardless of the season.

All these points fall under the umbrella of ""challenges of the North"". The other options (B, C, and D) aren't directly addressed in the passage as significant concerns for unprepared visitors."
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakamahia ana ināianei hei marae matua?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ināianei ko tāna mahi ko te wāhi tūmatanui pokapū..."" which translates to ""Now its function is the main public space..."" referring to Jardín de la Unión. While the other options are mentioned as points of interest, they are not described as the main public space.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kitea i Jardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: He gazebo matua me ngā konohete** (An old gazebo with fireworks).

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions:

*   **Jardín de la Unión** as a public space.
*   **Restaurants** being located in the garden.
*   **Fireworks** being held in the central square in the evenings.
*   **Callejon del Beso** (The Alley of the Kiss) as the location of a historical love story.
*   **Historical buildings** like the San Diego church.

However, it **does not** mention an old gazebo with fireworks. Therefore, option A is the correct answer."
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei mo te rā hīkoi ka whakaarotia he hē?","The correct answer is **D: Kāore te haere hikoi i te rā i te mea pai mō ngā whānau me ngā pēpi.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mō tētahi hīkoi ā-rā ki tētahi ara māmā kāore he tino whakaritenga e hiahiatia ana, ā, ka taea e tētahi tangata e āhua whiti ana te manawa reka i ērā. Me nui ake pea te whakarite a tētahi whānau mēnā he tamariki itiiti ōnā, ēngari e tāea ana tētahi haerenga ā-waho mēnā he pēpi, he kōhungahunga rānei."" 

This directly contradicts option D, which claims that hiking isn't good for families with babies. The text *allows* for hiking with babies, but with more planning.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: E hiahiatia ana he whakaritenga iti mo nga hīkoi o te rā i runga i nga huarahi ngāwari:** This is supported by the text: ""Mō tētahi hīkoi ā-rā ki tētahi ara māmā kāore he tino whakaritenga e hiahiatia ana...""
* **B: He rerekē ngā tawhiti, engari i whakaritea kia taupokina i roto i te rā kotahi:** This is also supported by the text, although not explicitly stated as a rule. The text discusses various hiking options and mentions planning for a day trip. 
* **C: Ko te nuinga o te wā ka taea e te hunga e tino kaha ana te mahi i tēnei mahi:** The text states that someone who is fit can enjoy a day hike.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea te hīkoi o te rā e tino hiahiatia ana he whakaritenga iti rawa?","The correct answer is **B: Ina pā ki tētahi huarahi ngāwari ake (When it's on a gentle path)**.

The passage states: ""Mō tētahi hīkoi ā-rā ki tētahi ara māmā kāore he tino whakaritenga e hiahiatia ana, ā, ka taea e tētahi tangata e āhua whiti ana te manawa reka i ērā."" This translates to: ""For a day hike on a gentle path, no particular arrangements are really needed, and someone who is physically fit can have a great time on it.""

Therefore, a gentle path requires minimal planning.
"
"He aha te rerekētanga o ngā papa i Rogaland, i Agder rānei ki te toenga o Norway?","The correct answer is **B: Kaore he mura** (They have no frame).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ki Rogaland me Agder i te nuinga o te wā kua whakaingoatia """"hei"""" ko tōna tikanga he **whenua pakihi rākau kore e ūhia ana ki te putiputi waiporoporo, ki te heta**.""

This translates to: ""In Rogaland and Agder, for the most part, they are called a **wood frame country not covered in fur, in hide**.""

This means the ""vidde"" (the type of platform described in the first sentence) in Rogaland and Agder are characterized by being *without a frame*.  The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i te āhua o Norway?","The correct answer is **D: Moorlands**.

Here's why:

The text describes Norway as having fjords and mountains, specifically mentioning ""tai matapari"" (glacial waters) and ""kōawaawa paripari"" (perfect mountains).  It then describes ""vidde"" (tundra/moorlands) as being found in Rogaland and Agder, but not the typical Norwegian landscape of forests and flowers.

Therefore, moorlands are presented as *not* a typical characteristic of Norway according to the text. The other options (glacial waters, forests, and mountains) are all explicitly mentioned as being part of the Norwegian landscape.
"
Āhea nga tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te haere ki nga pou maunga?,"The correct answer is **A: I te hōtoke (Winter)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the peak tourist season for the bird sanctuaries is usually in summer (raumati o Inia). However, it also mentions a different trend in the winter (takurua) where many sanctuaries are flooded, leading to restricted access and impacting retirement tours. This implies that winter is a time *avoided* by those wanting to visit the bird sanctuaries.  Therefore, the question ""When do tourists want to go to the mountains?"" is answered by the contrast: if winter is bad for the bird sanctuaries, people likely go to the mountains in the colder, drier months.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea tonu te nuinga o nga tūruhi i nga pou maunga?","The correct answer is **A: I te wā o te hukarere taumaha (During the monsoon season)**.

The passage states: ""Ko te wā tūruhi mō te teihana hiwi i te nuinga o te wā ka piki i te raumati o Inia. Heoi, kei te takurua he ātaahuatanga rerekē kei reira, he nui ngā teihana e mūia ana e te huka i whānui rawa ai ngā mahi retireti hukapapa ki reira.""

This translates to: ""The tourist season for the bird sanctuary is usually peak during the Indian summer. However, a different trend is emerging there, with many sanctuaries being inundated by floods, which greatly expands birdwatching retirement activities there.""

The key phrase is ""he nui ngā teihana e mūia ana e te huka"" - many sanctuaries are inundated by floods.  This suggests the flooding occurs during the monsoon season (hukarere taumaha). Therefore, the tourist season is *not* during the Indian summer (raumati o Īnia) anymore, because of the flooding.
"
He aha te mea e ārai ai koe ki te tūmanako koe kia kitea he poti e rapu āwhina ana?,"The correct answer is **C: Pānui ana i ō ratonga** (Advertising your services).

Here's why:

The passage describes a ""whakapiri pānui"" - a promotional message - that is being disseminated to offer help. This message includes things like walking to help people with their boats, talking to people who are repairing their engines, and contacting mechanics for engine repair. All of these activities involve advertising the speaker's abilities and services. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: E haere ana, whakararo ana i nga tauranga** (Going, looking at skills): While relevant, this is a description of the general process, not the specific action being taken *to attract* employers.
* **B: Ngā kāpene hoa** (Friendly mechanics):  The passage doesn't mention friendly mechanics specifically. It focuses on *actions* the speaker is taking.
* **D: E mōhio ana ki ngā hoa poti e pā ana ki te waka** (Knowing employers related to boats): While knowing potential employers is helpful, the passage states the speaker is *advertising* to *find* employers. They aren't just knowing about existing ones.



"
He aha tāu e mahi ai i nga marina ina rapu poti e hiahia ana ki te āwhina?,"The correct answer is **A: Whakapā atu ki ngā hēramana (Contact the managers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that your role is to ""try to contact the managers of the marinas, to encourage them to offer assistance to people who are looking for a berth."" Option A directly aligns with this instruction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Noho i raro i te hihiani (Huddle under the umbrella):** This is passive and doesn't contribute to helping people find berths.
* **C: Whakatata anake ki ngā tāngata i a rātau e horoi ana i to rātau yacht (Just talk to people who are cleaning their yachts):** While talking to people is part of the broader effort, it doesn't specifically address contacting marina managers.
* **D: Karohia ngā hoa patuchhikers (Get the kitesurfing friends):** This is irrelevant to helping people find berths in a marina.



"
Ko tēhea tauwāhi e tono ana ki tētahi tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te hītori kawanatanga o te motu?,"The correct answer is **C: Te Taone o Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ki te rapu koe i te taunakitanga o te hītori koroniara o te takiwā, koinei tētahi wāhi pai hei tīmata."" (If you are looking for the charm of colonial history in the area, this is a good place to start.)  The ""takiwā"" (area) being referred to is Hong Kong Island, which is part of the city of Hong Kong.

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
He aha te wāhi e ahuareka ai ki te tūruhi e aro nui ana ki ngā tirohanga whakamiharo?,"The correct answer is **A: Wikitōria Harbor**.

The passage states: ""Ki te kite i ngā tirohanga rawe rawa atu o Hong Kong, me wehe i te motu ka haere ai ki te tāhuna Kowloon kei tērā atu taha."" (To see the best views of Hong Kong, you should cross the island and go to the Kowloon peninsula on the other side.) While the whole of Hong Kong Island offers views, the passage specifically highlights that the *best* views are seen from across Victoria Harbour.
"
He aha ngā āhuatanga o ētahi tūru e āwhina ana ki te whakaiti i te mōrearea o te waewae o te kaieke kia mau ki te tūru?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā kapu Whāiti (White Straps)**.

The passage specifically mentions ""mātua, ko te nuinga o ngā kaieke ka mau pūtu tika pōtae tika me ngā mau rekereke tika, me te kuiti māeneene whāiti nei."" This translates to ""mainly, most elderly people wear proper fitted boots and proper straps, and a gentle white strap."" The white strap is mentioned as a safety measure to prevent the foot from slipping out of the boot.

The other options are not mentioned in the passage as safety features to prevent feet from slipping in boots.



"
He aha te āhuatanga o te hu eke e āwhina ana ki te whakapiki ake i te haumaru o te kaieke i te wā e whakamahi ana i ngā rākau?,"The correct answer is **B: Kirikau**.

The text states that ""ētahi terapēke, inarā ko ngā terapēke Ingarihi, he pā marutau ōna e āhei ai te tarapu kirikau te taka i te terapēke mēnā kua tōia whakamuritia e tētahi kai eke e taka ana."" This means that some splints, specifically the English splints, have a locking mechanism that allows the splint to collapse if the person falls, thus improving safety. This locking mechanism is what is described as ""kirikau"" (locking).



"
He aha te tukunga ki ngā haere mā ngā whatunga whakawhiti manaaki?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngā hononga ki ētahi atu kaihaereere e toro ana ki te ūnga kotahi** (Connections to other travelers visiting the same location).

Here's why:

The provided text describes Couchsurfing as a platform that connects travelers with locals, facilitating hospitality exchange.  The key point is that travelers connect *with others who are already in the same location*.  This connection is how the hospitality exchange happens. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā Whakaritenga me ngā mano paetata (Contracts and student IDs):** While contracts *might* be involved in some situations, they aren't the core function of the platform.  Student IDs are irrelevant.
* **B: rerenga māmā (Backpacking):** Backpacking is a *type* of travel, not a method of hospitality exchange.
* **C: Ngā haereere i tukuna e ngā kaiārahi paetata (Trips arranged by student leaders):** This is not described in the text and Couchsurfing isn't inherently about student-led trips.



"
"I runga anō i te whakawhitinga, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei e pā ana ki ngā whatunga whakawhiti manaaki ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: Ka whakaratohia tonu ngā kaihaerere ki ngā tohutoro mō ngā kaihautū o te rohe.**

Here's why:

The passage describes Couchsurfing as a platform for hospitality exchange. It mentions hosts offering free accommodation and the ability to connect with other travelers.  It also touches on safety and review systems.

Let's examine each option:

*   **A: Ka whakaratohia tonu ngā kaihaerere ki ngā tohutoro mō ngā kaihautū o te rohe.** This aligns with the Couchsurfing's function of facilitating connections between travelers and hosts. Providing resources to hosts is logical to ensure a smooth experience. This is the *most likely* to be true.

*   **B: Tērā pea ka hiahiatia e ētahi whatunga he tirotiro anō i ngā kaihaere.** While safety is a concern, the passage doesn't specifically state that all hosts require further scrutiny. It hints at review systems, but not universal checks.

*   **C: Ka whakaratohia ki ngā kaihaereere he rārangi o ngā kaihautū e wātea ana i te tāone ūnga.**  The passage doesn't mention providing a list of hosts in a specific city.

*   **D: I ētahi wā e wātea ana ngā arotake o ngā kaihautū o te rohe ki ngā kaihaerere.** The passage mentions review systems but doesn't say hosts actively review travelers.

Therefore, option A is the most likely statement to be true based on the given passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo manuhiri e kitea ana i roto i tētahi rūma whare noho tiri?","The correct answer is **A: He manuhiri i roto i o rātau rua tekau mā rua** (Visitors in their twenties).

The text states: ""Ko te kaupapa matua a ngā whare rangapū he kāinga kē mā te hunga rangatahi - ko **te nuingā o te wā, 20 tau te pakeke o te manuhiri**..."" (The main purpose of the hostels is a home for young people - most of the time, the visitors are in their twenties...).

While the text mentions that elderly people are sometimes seen and families with children are difficult to accommodate, the dominant type of visitor is people in their twenties. Therefore, option A is the most accurate.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko wai e tino noho ana i te whare noho?","The correct answer is **D: Tokorua nga whānau e haere tahi ana me a rāua tamariki** (Three families traveling together with their children).

Here's why:

The first sentence of the passage states that the main focus of the hostels is for young people, around 20 years old. However, older people are also sometimes seen.  The passage also mentions difficulties in accommodating families with young children, although some hostels will make arrangements.

Option D best reflects the likely scenario described - three families together, presumably including children.  The other options don't align with the general description of the hostel's clientele and the challenges mentioned in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e whakamārama tika ana i te maka pūkei?","The correct answer is **A: Ka hoki mai tonu ki tō ringa mēnā ka tika te maka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""He hiahia koe ki te ako ki te whiu i tētahi pumarangi ka hokihoki mai i tō ringa..."" (If you want to learn to catch a fish that will hook onto your hand...). This directly implies that a properly secured hook will stay attached to your hand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He pai ake ki waenganui i nga tūruhi i nga tūruhi** (It is better for the hook to be larger than the fish): The passage doesn't mention hook size relative to the fish.
* **C: Kaore he maha o ngā pukumahi e wātea ana i Ahitereiria** (Not many hooks are available in Australia): The passage focuses on *choosing* a hook suitable for catching and doesn't discuss availability in Australia.
* **D: Ko ētahi o ngā pukumahi anake e āhei ana ki te hoki mai** (Only some hooks are allowed to return): The passage discusses hooks that *will* hook onto your hand if done correctly, not about hooks that are allowed to return.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e whakamahia nuitia ana i roto i te kai o Javanese?,"The correct answer is **C: huka kōkona** (coconut milk).

Here's why:

The text states: ""...the main ingredients for Javanese food are peanuts, soy sauce, **coconut milk (inarā ko te huka kokonati Javanese)**, and many other seasonings.""

Therefore, coconut milk (huka kōkona) is explicitly mentioned as a main ingredient. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te horahanga o te mate ārai?","The correct answer is **B: Pathogens**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ko te mate hōrapa tētahi tahumaero nā tētahi tukumate te take, pēnei i te huaketo, i te ngārara, i te hekaheka, i ētahi atu pirinoa rānei."" (Contagious diseases are caused by a pathogen, such as influenza, measles, chickenpox, etc.)

* **Pathogens** are disease-causing microorganisms like viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā tāngata i pāngia (The people affected):** While people are affected, they aren't the *cause* of the disease.
* **C: Kocterium (Bacteria):**  Bacteria are *types* of pathogens, but ""pathogens"" is the broader and more accurate term in this context. The passage doesn't specifically mention bacteria, but refers to a general cause.
* **D: Ngā Vaccinations (Vaccinations):** Vaccinations are a *prevention* method, not the cause of the disease.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea kāore i te mōhiotia he mate urutā?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā Viruses**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te mate hōrapa tētahi tahumaero nā tētahi tukumate te take, pēnei i te huaketo, i te ngārara, i te hekaheka, i ētahi atu pirinoa rānei."" This translates to ""Contagious diseases are caused by a pathogen, such as influenza, measles, chickenpox, and other pathogens.""  Viruses are a type of pathogen.

The passage goes on to discuss the spread of contagious diseases from person to person.  It does *not* mention vaccinations, bacteria, or fungi as the cause of contagious diseases.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Ngā Viruses** (Viruses).
"
I roto i tehea āhuatanga ka nui ake te whiriwhiri i te proxy tukutuku i te kaiwhakarato VPN whaiaro mo te kaiwhakamahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kei te āwangawanga te kaiwhakamahi ki te karo i te aukatinga me te tutei i te nuinga e taea ana.**

Here's why:

* **VPNs are primarily used for bypassing restrictions and improving security.** The question states this directly.  People use VPNs to access blocked content, avoid surveillance, and enhance their online privacy.
* **Option B aligns perfectly with this purpose.**  The core motivation for using a VPN is to circumvent blocks and improve security. 
* **Why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **A: E hiahia ana te kaiwhakamahi ki te whakawhiti i te waka katoa** (The user needs to switch all traffic): While a VPN *can* be used for all traffic, it's not the *only* reason someone would choose one.  Someone might only need it for a specific task.
    * **C: Ko te kaiwhakamahi te arataki i te waka http** (The user controls the http traffic):  While possible, the ability to control *only* HTTP traffic is a less compelling reason to use a VPN compared to bypassing broader restrictions.
    * **D: E hiahiatia ana e te ngohe a te kaiwhakamahi he āhua ngāwari ki te taumata teitei o te hōkaiipurangi** (The user needs to be skilled at high-level firewall techniques):  Technical expertise isn't a requirement for using a VPN.  It's designed to be user-friendly.



Therefore, the driving force behind choosing a VPN is the desire to overcome limitations and enhance security, making **B** the most accurate answer.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei mō ngā VPN me ngā takawaenga tukutuku ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **D: Ka taea anake e ngā VPNs te tiki anō i ngā whakawhitinga http.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states VPNs are better for online tasks because they fix routes for payment services, not just HTTP.** This means VPNs can handle a wider range of protocols beyond just the standard web traffic.
* **Option D implies VPNs are *limited* to HTTP traffic.**  The passage directly contradicts this.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Ko te tikanga he nui ake te bandwidth o ngā VPN i ngā proxy tukutuku** - The passage mentions VPNs typically offer a wider and better quality connection, suggesting higher bandwidth.
* **B: Kāore e taea e ngā proxy tukutuku te huri i te katoa o te waka tukutuku** - The passage says VPNs are better at bypassing restrictions, implying proxies are less effective.
* **C: He iti ake te kounga o te ratonga o ngā proxy tukutuku i ngā VPN** - The passage states VPNs usually offer better quality service than proxies.



Therefore, **D** is the only statement that doesn't align with the information presented in the passage."
He aha ka taea e tētahi te whakamahi i tētahi kamupene waea i waho o tō rātou rohe ināianei tonu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā tau waea huri noa (Roaming calling plans)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that because calls are made over the internet, you don't need a local phone company.
* It also mentions the ability to get international connectivity from anywhere.
* The passage then says that you often need to purchase an international plan to allow PSTN calls to connect to you.
* Therefore, the ability to use a phone company outside your immediate area is facilitated by a **roaming calling plan**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā waea ararere Ipurangi (VoIP phones)** - While VoIP is relevant to internet calls, the question asks about using a *phone company* in a different area. VoIP doesn't necessarily involve a traditional phone company presence in that area.
* **C: Ngā Aorangi (International plans)** -  An international plan allows you to *make* calls to other countries, but it doesn't directly enable you to *use* a phone company in a different region where you are currently located.
* **D: Ngā waea PSTN (PSTN phones)** - The passage mentions the need for an international plan to enable PSTN calls to *you*. It doesn't suggest PSTN phones themselves allow you to use a company in a different area without a plan.



"
"E ai ki te whakawhitinga, he aha pea me mahi kia whiwhi ai i ētahi waea?","The correct answer is **A: Hokona he tau huri noa (Buy a universal year)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nui ngā wā, me hoko anō koe i tētahi tau ā-ao e whakaae ana kia waea atu ngā waea PSTN ki a koe.""  This translates to ""Many times, you still need to buy a universal year that allows PSTN calls to reach you.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whakamahia he kamupene waea paetata (Use a VoIP company):** The passage explicitly states that VoIP calls are affected by location, meaning this isn't a solution.
* **C: Kei te whiwhi tau mai i tō iwi paetata (Get a year from your local community):** The passage mentions no such arrangement exists.
* **D: Hokona he waea PSTN (Buy a PSTN phone):** The passage indicates that PSTN calls *to* you might be problematic depending on where you are, suggesting a PSTN phone isn't necessarily the answer to getting calls *to* you.

Therefore, buying a universal year is the solution the passage highlights.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kupu e kore e tika te whakahua i ngā kupu o Ingarangi?,"The correct answer is **A: He rerekē te kōrero o te r taurua i te r kotahi** (The pronunciation of 'r' at the beginning of a word differs from 'r' in the middle of a word).

Here's why:

* **The question asks which statement *doesn't* describe Italian pronunciation.**
* Option A is *true* about Italian pronunciation.  The ""r"" at the beginning of a word is a rolled ""r,"" while an ""r"" in the middle of a word is often softer.

Let's look at why the other options are *true* descriptions of Italian pronunciation:

* **B: Ko te nuinga o ngā kupu e kōrerotia ana me pēhea te tuhituhi** (Most words are pronounced as they are written) - This is generally true in Italian.  The spelling-pronunciation correspondence is quite consistent.
* **C: Ka māminga pea ngā kupu whai reta c me te g** (Words with 'c' and 'g' are pronounced differently) -  This is true. 'c' and 'g' have different pronunciations depending on the following vowel (e.g., ""ciao"" vs ""casa"").
* **D: He rerekē te whakahua o te nuinga o ngā kupu i runga anō i te rerenga reo e whai ake nei** (The pronunciation of most words changes depending on the following sound) - This is also true. Italian has consonant assimilation; sounds change depending on the sounds surrounding them.

Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't describe a characteristic of Italian pronunciation.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā āhuatanga e whai ake nei o Izmir i puta i mua i te rā hou?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā whare e whakaatu ana i ngā aroaro karaehe (Houses that display the charm of the past)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ko ngā whare he karāhe te pakitara o mua..."" which translates to ""...the houses are a charming blend of the past..."" Option B, ""Ngā whare e whakaatu ana i ngā aroaro karaehe"", accurately reflects this description of older houses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā boulevards whānui (Wide boulevards):** The passage mentions wide avenues *now*, but it doesn't say they existed before.
*   **C: Ngā pokapū hokohoko (Shopping centers):**  The passage mentions *new* shopping centers, indicating they are a modern addition.
*   **D: Ngā tuanui kua oti te whero (Old, weathered monuments):** While the passage mentions old monuments/mosques, it doesn't say the houses *themselves* were weathered monuments. The focus is on the houses as having the charm of the past.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te āhuatanga tika o Izmir?,"The correct answer is **D: Kei a ia te tauranga tuarua nui rawa atu i Turkey** (It has the second largest port in Turkey).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Izmir has a ""poka pū ikiiki tino pai"" (very good commercial center) and is located in a ""takiwa o tētahi koko nui"" (area of a large bay).  While it's a major port, the passage doesn't state it's the *second largest* in Turkey. 

The other options are all mentioned in the text:

* **A: E karapoti ana te taone i te whanga nui** (The city is situated on a large bay) - This is stated directly.
* **B: Ko te hau e whakaatu ana i nga tikanga o Turkey** (The climate reflects Turkish customs) -  The passage mentions a ""wairua ka nui ake te Mediterranean Europe i te Tākei o mua"" (spirit that is more Mediterranean European than ancient Turkey), implying the climate has influences from both.
* **C: Ka kitea e koe ngā pokapū hokohoko hou me ngā hahi tawhito** (You will find new shopping centers and old structures) - This is a direct description of the city's architecture and commercial landscape.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that isn't supported by the provided text.
"
Ko te kupu hanami e pā ana ki te tirohanga o te aha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā puawai Plum (Plum blossoms)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ko te pua puaina tuatahi nā te emepara i whakatū mōna anake, me ōna apataki o te kāhui ariki me te kōti teitei."" (The plum blossom was the first flower the emperor cultivated in orchards, along with his imperial palace and high court.) This connects *hanami* to the *pua puaina* (plum blossoms).
"
Na wai i taurima nga rōpū tuatahi i whakatapua ki te tirotiro i nga puawai cherry?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā aristocrats Hapanihi**.

The passage states: ""I Hapāni, ko te pua puaina tuatahi nā te emepara i whakatū mōna anake, me ōna apataki o te kāhui ariki me te kōti teitei."" This translates to ""In Japan, the cherry blossom viewing first began only with the emperor establishing gardens, and with his court and high officials.""

Therefore, the first groups to engage in hanami were the **Japanese aristocrats (aristocrats Hapanihi)**. While the emperor was involved in establishing gardens, the viewing was initially associated with the nobility.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā aronga e whai ake nei o Jerusalem te iti rawa o te kawe tāpoi?","The correct answer is **B: Ko tōna tūnga hei taone matua o Iharaira**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko Hiruharama te tāone matua o Iharaira..."" (Jerusalem is the capital city of Israel...).  The question asks which of the listed options is *least* relevant to attracting tourists *according to the passage*. The passage emphasizes Jerusalem's religious significance, historical importance, cultural appeal, and archaeological sites, but the *primary* reason it's highlighted as important is its status as the capital.

While the other options are *all* reasons people might visit Jerusalem, the passage prioritizes its role as the capital city, making the other options comparatively less emphasized as a draw in *this particular passage*.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga nei hei mea e mōhiotia ana a Jerusalem?,"The correct answer is **B: āhuatanga tōrangapū (economic features)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the historical, religious, and cultural significance of Jerusalem. It mentions its historical sites, cultural aspects (like markets, coffee houses, and restaurants), and religious importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  

While the passage mentions cultural aspects, it *doesn't* delve into the economic features of the city.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are mentioned:

*   **A: Hītori e whakahē ana (historical sites):** The passage explicitly states Jerusalem is a city with a long and beautiful history and mentions historical sites within the Old City.
*   **C: tikanga whakapono (religious beliefs):** The passage clearly states Jerusalem is holy to three monotheistic religions.
*   **D: Ngā pae ahurea (cultural aspects):** The passage mentions markets, coffee houses, and restaurants as part of the cultural landscape.

Therefore, economic features are the *unmentioned* aspect.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo haere e kore e whai hua mai i te hoko Kāri Moho?","The correct answer is **B: He tangata haere e toro ana ki Kruger National Park anake**.

Here's why:

* The text states that a Wild Card is a good value if you plan to visit *several* parks within South Africa National Parks (SANParks).
* Option B describes someone only visiting Kruger National Park.  They wouldn't benefit from a Wild Card because it's designed for multiple park visits.
* Option A is correct because a Wild Card *would* benefit someone planning to visit many SANParks.
* Option C is incorrect because the Wild Card is *about* park entry costs, it doesn't prevent people from paying for park entry.
* Option D is correct because a Wild Card *would* benefit someone planning to visit Kruger *and* other parks.



"
Ko tēhea kōrero e kore e tino whakaahua i te Kruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: Ko te iti rawa o ngā Pāka ā-Motu o Awherika ki te Tonga** (It is the least of the game reserves in Southern Africa).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the opposite.** The passage says: ""Koirā tētahi o ngā mea whakamanea matua o Awherika ki te Tonga, ā, e whai whakaarohia ana ia hei tohu matua o ngā South African National Parks (SANParks)."" (It is one of the major attractions of Southern Africa, and is considered a flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks)). This implies it's *not* the least.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate based on the text:

* **A: E whakaarotia ana he tāwhara matua o Awherika ki te Tonga** (It is considered a flagship of Southern Africa) - This is directly stated in the text.
* **B: He rerekē te waiora i waenganui i nga ecozones maha o te pāka** (The wildlife is diverse between the many ecozones of the park) - This is also stated in the text.
* **D: Ka taea e ngā manuhiri mā te hokonga o tētahi Kāri Mohoho** (Visitors can access it by purchasing a Wild Card) - This is mentioned in the text regarding park access.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e tino mōrearea ana mō ngā kaieke i ngā wāhanga pakari o te maunga?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngā here mākū (The slippery sections)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kei te whakatakotoria he arawhata kōhatu ki te nuinga o te ara, ā, ki ngā wāhi paripari ake he taura tīra hei puringa ā-ringa tautoko. Ahakoa tēnā, ka korehāhā koe, **me matāra hoki i ngā wāhi hōhonu, inā koa ka mākū ana, ka tere taka ai koe ki te raruraru**.""  This translates to: ""While there is a stone path to most of the trail, and handrails for easier sections. However, **you must be careful in the slippery sections, especially if it's wet, as you can quickly fall into trouble**.""

Therefore, the slippery sections (ngā here mākū) are the most dangerous for hikers on the more challenging parts of the mountain.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e kore e tino whakaatu i te piki o te maunga o Machu Picchu e whakaahuatia ana i te wāhanga nei?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaore he tuhi ā ringa puta noa i nga wāhanga poupou ake**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a challenging climb with stone steps and handrails for support. It emphasizes the steepness and potential danger of slipping. Option B talks about a lack of handrails, which is the *opposite* of what the passage states (it specifically mentions handrails for support). The other options all relate to the difficulty and experience of climbing the mountain, which is directly described in the passage.



Therefore, option B is the only one that *doesn't* accurately reflect the information provided in the text about the climb."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ehara ēnei i te tēpara matua o te kai a Majorcan?","The correct answer is **B: Parāoa (Vegetables)**.

The text explicitly states that the main food of Mallorcan people includes ""he paraoa, he huawhenua, he mīti (kōia tonu ko te poaka)"" which translates to ""vegetables, grains, and fruits (also considered food)."" While it mentions other elements like fish, it specifically lists vegetables as a key component.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga nei, ko tehea kōrero e pā ana ki ngā kai Hangi ehara i te mea pono?","The correct answer is **C: I te nuinga o te wā e tunua ana ngā hapa tīpokapoka mā te whakamahi i te tautau**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that hāngī are often used to cook **meat**. It mentions ""tētahi kai tunu tūturu"" which translates to ""a steady cook"" or a staple food, strongly suggesting meat.
* Options A, B, and D are all mentioned or implied in the passage.
* Option C states that hāngī are mainly used to cook **tea**. The passage does not mention tea being cooked in a hāngī. It focuses on meat.

Therefore, statement C is not supported by the information provided in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei kāore i whakahuatia hei huarahi noa hei whakawera i te poka Hangi?,"The correct answer is **A: korohū**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes several ways to heat a Hāngī:**
    * **Rua wera ki te papa:** An oven built on the ground.
    * **Kōhatu wera mai i tētahi ahi:** Hot stones from a fire.
    * **Wāhi ka wera noa mai ngā wāhi o te whenua i te mahana ngāwhā:** Heated ground due to geothermal heat (Hāngī ngāwhā).

* **Korohū (a heat source using a fire with a woven basket)** isn't mentioned as a method of heating a Hāngī in the text.  The other options (hot stones and geothermal heat) are.

Therefore, korohū is the only option not described in the passage.
"
"He aha pea te hua o te āhukahuka motuhake mai i te monk, i te nunui rānei?","The correct answer is **A: E mau ana i tētahi tākai hipa kanapa**.

Here's why:

The passage describes specific rules for dressing when visiting a marae (Maori meeting ground).  It mentions women needing to cover their shoulders and men needing to cover their chest.  The key point is that appropriate attire includes a specific type of cloak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Kei te taupoki i ō pakihiwi (Hiding their chests):** While the passage mentions men needing to cover their chests, the focus is on *how* they do it – with a cloak. This option doesn't capture that.
*   **C: E mau ana i tētahi takai mai i te ariki (Holding a cloak from the gods):** While cloaks are significant, the passage isn't about the *origin* of the cloak, but rather the *requirement* to wear it.
*   **D: E mau ana i te panekoti e tapahia ana i runga ake i te turi (Holding a cloak covered over the shoulders):** This is partially correct but doesn't fully represent the essential function of a cloak in this context; the cloak itself is what is being held.



"
Ko tehea o ngā kakahu e whai ake nei e kore e taea te tono i te whare karakia? ,"The correct answer is **B: Poto (Shorts)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko te nuinga o ngā whare karakia ka tuku i ngā takai mā ngā wāhine ka taetae atu me te kore i whakarite, engari ki te kawe atu koe i tō ake takai..."" (Most churches provide skirts for women, but if you bring your own skirt...). It also mentions men should wear trousers to cover their legs.  Shorts are not mentioned as being provided or acceptable.
"
I te wā e whai wāhitanga ai tētahi manuhiri ki te mātakitaki whetū i a ia e haere ana ki ngā wāhi Antarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: I roto i ngā marama hōtoke (During the winter months)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""He hoatutanga pai tēnei kia kite ai i ngā Aurora Borealis, i te mea ka pōuri te rangi mō te roanga o te huringa o te karaka."" (This is a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, because the sky is dark for the length of the winter solstice.)

The Aurora Borealis (Northern Lights) are best viewed during the winter months when there are long periods of darkness. Antarctica experiences its winter during the Northern Hemisphere's summer, and vice-versa. The text refers to the winter solstice, implying it's a dark time of year. Therefore, the best time to see the Aurora Borealis (and therefore, experience the dark skies beneficial for stargazing) would be during the winter months in the Antarctic.
"
I te wā i kore ai te waea amiorangi e taea te whakakapi i te waea pūkoro?,"The correct answer is **A: Mēnā ka whakararurarutia pea te raina tirohanga ki te aorangi (If the line of sight to the sky is obstructed).**

Here's why:

The passage states that a satellite phone is not the *ideal* solution for a mobile phone call because it requires a clear view of the sky to connect to a satellite.  Obstructing that view would prevent the satellite phone from working.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mēnā he mamao rawa te tauwāhi (If the weather is very bad):** While bad weather *could* affect satellite communication, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as the primary reason why satellite phones aren't ideal, only that a clear view of the sky is required.
* **C: Mēnā ka whakamahia ki waho (If it is used outdoors):**  The passage doesn't say using a satellite phone outdoors is the problem, only that a *view of the sky* is needed.
* **D: Mēnā e hiahiatia ana e tētahi haerenga ētahi hiahia raraunga (If a trip requires certain data needs):**  The passage mentions that data and long-distance calls are requirements for some trips, but it doesn't directly link this to the failure of a satellite phone connection.



"
Āhea ka pai ake ai tētahi waea tawhiorangi ki tētahi waea pūtau?,"The correct answer is **D: Ina whai pānuitanga waea pūtau tika koe (If you get a proper SMS notification)**.

Here's why:

The text explains that SMS isn't a reliable backup for phone calls because it needs a strong cellular signal, usually requiring being outside and having a clear view of the sky. 

Option D directly addresses this issue. A proper SMS notification implies a cellular connection is available, making it a more reliable alternative to a phone call when a phone call isn't possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I a ia e hararei ana i tētahi taone (When he is on vacation in a city):** While a city *might* have better coverage, the text states that even then, SMS isn't *ideal* due to signal requirements.
* **B: I te wā o te haerenga poti (During a business trip):** Business trips *might* have good coverage, but again, SMS isn't a perfect replacement for a phone call.
* **C: Ki te kore e hiahiatia te raraunga mamao (If you don't need a lot of data):**  The text mentions the need for data and voice for certain professions, so this is not a general solution.



"
Na te papā o ēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei i ahu mai ki te hanganga o te Whenua o Transnistria?,"The correct answer is **B: Ethnicity**.

The passage states that the Transnistria Republic was formed by **Moldovans** themselves, specifically in the western part of Moldova. This indicates an ethnic aspect to the formation of the republic. The passage also mentions that Moldova is a multi-ethnic country that has been affected by ethnic conflict. While the other options are relevant to Moldova, ethnicity is the direct cause mentioned in the provided text for the formation of Transnistria.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ana i te Republic of Transnistria e rerekē ana i te toenga o Moldova?  ,"The correct answer is **C: Āhukahuka UN**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Republic of Transnistria is not recognized as a member of the United Nations. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Reo** - While Romanian is the official language, Transnistria doesn't have a unique language that differentiates it from Moldova.
*   **B: Whakapono** - Both Moldova and Transnistria have their own systems of belief.
*   **D: Moni** - Transnistria has its own monetary system, but the lack of UN recognition is the key differentiating factor mentioned in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea haere ai ki Montevideo mehemea e tūmanako ana rātau ki te karo i nga āhuatanga hau?","The correct answer is **C: I roto i ngā marama raumati o Hemisphere ki te Raki** (During the summer months of the Northern Hemisphere).

Here's why:

* The text states that Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere and that it's summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
* It also mentions that the hottest temperatures occur during the summer months in Montevideo, reaching over +30°C.
* The text implies that it's not ideal to visit during these times if you want to avoid the hot weather.

Therefore, to avoid the hot weather, you should visit during the summer months in the Northern Hemisphere, which coincides with winter in the Southern Hemisphere (Montevideo's summer).
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea te haere ki Montevideo mehemea he wāhi rātau ki tētahi āhuarangi mātao ake?","The correct answer is **A: Ina raumati i Montevideo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere.
* It also mentions that when it's summer *in Montevideo*, it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere.
* The question asks when it's a good time to go if someone wants to be in a warmer climate.
* Therefore, the best time to visit Montevideo for a warmer climate is during *its* summer.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ina raumati i te Hemisphere ki te Raki** - This is incorrect because the question is about Montevideo, which is in the Southern Hemisphere.
* **C: Ina tae ki te wā marangai o Montevideo** -  Winter in Montevideo would be a cooler time.
* **D: Ina hōtoke i te Hemisphere ki te Raki** - This option is irrelevant to Montevideo's climate.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tēhea o ēnei e pā ana ki tētahi kaitoi whakairo kua whakatūria, i te mea he mahi whakangaro?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā takahanga Graffiti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko ngā muraiti me ngā tuhinga anuanu hoki e mōhiotia ana hei karawhiti. Ahakoa he tawhito te āhua, ko te nuinga e mea ana nā te rangatahi ēnei mahi, he āhuatanga kikino, he tūkino i ngā taputapu mā te peita rehurehu. Heoi, i ēnei rangi nei he kaituhituhi pakitara whakapūmau, he hinonga tuhituhi pakitara """"ture"""" tika. Ngā tuhinga pakitara pēnei e mōhiotia ana hei mahi toi, ehara noa i ngā tuhituhi takahi ture.""

This translates to: ""Graffiti and other annotations are known for crossing boundaries. Although the style is old, most of these works are done by young people, they have a rebellious, destructive characteristic using spray paint tools. However, these days there is a stylized graffiti writer, a stylized writing group ""legitimate."" Such graffiti are known as art, not just illegal writings.""

The passage explicitly identifies **Graffiti** as a form of art, though historically it's been considered illegal.  The question asks which of the options relates to a commissioned artist doing a performance. Graffiti *can* be commissioned and performed as a piece of art.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tuhia (Writing):**  While graffiti *involves* writing, the passage is more focused on the visual aspect (the ""muraiti"" - markings/annotations) and the style/technique.
* **C: Ngā mura tē hiahiatia i runga i te āhuatanga tūmatanui (The required markings based on the scale):** This is not directly mentioned or related to graffiti.
* **D: Ngā tūtohu kāore e taea te whakatau (The signs cannot be determined):** This is irrelevant to the passage's topic.



Therefore, **A: Ngā takahanga Graffiti** is the most accurate answer because the passage links graffiti to being considered art and potentially commissioned.
"
He aha te āhua o nga hākari pūoro e whakaaro ana ētahi kaiāwhina he wāhi tino nui o te wheako?,"The correct answer is **B: Kei te puni i runga i te pae (Performing on stage)**.

The passage states: ""Me kei te hiahia koe kia tata atu ki ngā mahi, me tae wawe atu koe kia whai wāhi atu ki tētahi puni tata ki ngā waiata.""  This translates to ""If you want to be close to the action, you should quickly attend a performance close to the songs."" Therefore, performing on stage is highlighted as a key aspect of the experience.

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

* **A: Te kawe tamariki nohinohi (Bringing infants)** - While mentioned as a specific provision at some gatherings, it's not described as a key aspect of the overall experience.
* **C: Pūoro e purei tōmuri ana ki te pō (Music that continues late into the night)** -  The passage mentions late-night music, but it's not emphasized as a primary experience.
* **D: Kei te moata (Sleeping)** - This is the opposite of being engaged in the experience.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tikanga kia manakē te kaiāwhina hākari mehemea e hiahia ana rātau ki te hopuni e tata ana ki te pūoro?","The correct answer is **A: E haere tōmuri ana i te pō (They stay up late).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Me maumahara ahakoa kua mutu pea te puoro ki ngā atamira matua, tērā ētahi wāhi o te hui ahurei e whakatangi puoro tai nuaku ana kia waenganui pō.""  This translates to: ""Remember that even though the main performances have ended, some parts of the concert are scheduled to continue late into the night.""

Therefore, to be close to the music, you need to stay up late. Options B, C, and D are not mentioned in the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Me karo ngā manuhiri ina rapu i te oranga pō i te raki o New Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Ngā pae taone iti (Small towns)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kāore ngā pāpara kauta o ngā tāone iti ki konei i te wāhi pai i ngā wā katoa mō te manuhiri nō waho i te takiwā."" This translates to ""The casinos of the small towns are not always a good place for out-of-town visitors here.""

While the text mentions casinos *exist* in the Pueblo area, it specifically cautions against relying on them for nightlife. The focus of the warning is on the *small towns* and their casinos.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea te wāhi e kitea ai e te manuhiri ngā whakangahau rongonui i te raki o New Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: I tētahi kaihoko e tata ana ki Sante Fe**.

The text states: ""kei te tō mai ētahi o rātou i te whakangahau ingoa-parani (inarā ko ngā mea rūi e tino tata ana ki Albuquerque me Santa Fe)."" which translates to ""some of them are coming with the name-recognition entertainment (which are the things that are very close to Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""

This implies the entertainment options are closer to Santa Fe than Albuquerque, making option C the most accurate.
"
Tērā pea e hiahia ana ngā kaimahi mōhio pūtea ki te karo ko tēhea momo inu?,"The answer is **A: Waina o Ahitereiria (Australian Wine)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko te atu pia ā-rohe ko te """"Manta"""" He nui ngā waina Wīwī, engari ka whāroa ake pea te totoro atu o ngā waina a Aotearoa me Ahitereiria."" This translates to ""The other noble wines are """"Manta"""", there are many Rieslings, but the wines of New Zealand and Australia might become more famous.""

The passage then goes on to describe Australian coffee and tea, highlighting their cost and quality.  The implication is that Australian wine, while plentiful, might be less desirable *financially* compared to other options.  Therefore, someone who wants to save money should avoid Australian wine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wai pounamu (Pounamu water):** The passage mentions drinking water in New Zealand (""He pai noa iho te inu wai mai i ngā kōrere ki reira"").
* **C: Pia paetata (Potato beer):** Potato beer isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: Wai Fruit (Fruit water):** Fruit water isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
"I runga anō i te wāhi i whakaahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, ko tehea o ngā tono inu e whai ake nei ka raruraru pea e te kaiwhakarato?","The correct answer is **A: He pango poto (Short black)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ko te short black he """"espresso""""..."".  This implies that a ""short black"" is essentially an espresso, which can be a bit of a tricky order for some baristas who might expect a different preparation.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **B: He tau Kotahi (One year)** - This is a wine type, but the text says the ""Nama tahi"" isn't a difficult wine.
* **C: He Sauvignon Blanc mai i New Zealand** - The text describes Sauvignon Blanc as having ""ngā waina Wīwī"" (crisp wines), and notes New Zealand and Australia are becoming known for their wines. It doesn't explicitly say Sauvignon Blanc is difficult.
* **D: He mā papatahi (A flat white)** - The text describes a flat white as ""kirimi kei te tihi (ehara i te whorowho)"" - cream on top (no foam). It doesn't imply it's difficult to make.



Therefore, a ""short black"" (espresso) is the most likely to cause confusion or be a ""raruraru"" (problem) for the barista based on the information given.



"
E toru rau tau te roa o te wā o te whakawātea e te rōpū nei?,"The correct answer is **D: Nga Paniora**.

The text states: ""Te iwi Pāniora ki ngā mahi raupatu, toru rautau te roa."" which translates to ""The Spanish people began to undertake colonization, for three hundred years.""
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te huarahi pai rawa atu ki te tiki i tētahi Parihi kia mahana ki a koe?","The correct answer is **A: Attemp ki te hōrite i te āhua o te Parihi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ko te ara pai rawa kia pai te haere ki Parī kia pai rawa tō whanonga, me pērā i tētahi tangata he """"bien eleve"""" (kua pai te whakatipu)."" This translates to: ""the best way to go to Paris and have good behavior is to be like someone who is 'bien élevé' (well-bred/well-mannered).""  ""Bien élevé"" implies a certain refined and polite demeanor.

Therefore, to be well-received in Paris, you should try to emulate that refined Parisian style. Options B, C, and D are the opposite of what the passage suggests.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te whakaarotia he kounga tīwharawhara o nga Parisian?","The correct answer is **C: Pureitanga (Purity)**.

The text explicitly states the Parisian people are known to be ""whakahīhī"" (arrogant), ""kuare"" (rude), and ""whakamenemene"" (condescending). It then implies that being ""bien élevé"" (well-mannered) is the key to a smoother experience in Paris and avoiding negative perceptions.

""Pureitanga"" (purity) is not mentioned in the text as a characteristic of the Parisian people, and therefore, it's the one not acknowledged as a negative trait.
"
He aha te painga o te Tauaha Tuatahi i runga i te MetroRail o Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **B: Ehara i te tokomaha o ngā tāngata** (It's not very crowded).

The passage explicitly states: ""He hāneanea, ā, kāore hoki e tino nui te tāngata ki MetroPlus..."" which translates to ""It's comfortable, and it's not very crowded with people...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kai mua te kaiako i te tereina** (The driver is in front of the train): This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: He iti iho te utu i te tīkiti Tauaha Tuatoru** (The ticket price for the Third Class is lower): The passage states the opposite - MetroPlus (First Class) has a higher fare.
*   **D: He ōrite te utu hei tīkiti Metro** (The price is the same for a Metro ticket):  The passage implies different prices between MetroPlus and Metro.

Therefore, the only correct answer based on the provided text is B."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ia tereina haere i Cape Town?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā kaiako tauaha Tuatahi, Tuatoru hoki**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Katoa ngā tereina, nā MetroPlus me Metro; Ko ngā tereina MetroPlus kei te pito o te tereina e tata ana ki Cape Town."" This translates to: ""All the trains, from MetroPlus and Metro; The MetroPlus trains are at the end of the train that approaches Cape Town.""

Therefore, the trains that go *to* Cape Town are the MetroPlus (Taumata Tuatahi) and Metro (Taumata Tuatoru) trains. Options A and B are incorrect because the passage doesn't mention the number of trains or the ticket prices. Option C is incorrect because there are two levels of trains (MetroPlus and Metro), not three.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he tūkino kararehe e kore pea e mahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Whakapouri i nga mate (Spread diseases)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that rats *can* spread diseases. However, the question asks which *doesn't* happen. The passage doesn't mention rats being able to spread diseases *by themselves*. Options A, C, and D are all actions rats *can* take as described in the passage.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
Ki hea hokona ai ngā kāri waea utu-tōmua?,"The correct answer is **C: I ngā toa kokonga (Grocery stores)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states ""Kua whakakīia ia toa-koki ki te huhua o kāri wea hoko kua utua kētia e rangirua ai koe"" which translates to ""They are stocked in the checkout of prepaid phone cards purchased with a prepaid credit.""  This implies that grocery stores are a common place to find these cards.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: I ngā whenua tauwhāiti (Convenience stores):** While sometimes a possibility, the text specifically mentions the *checkout* which is more characteristic of grocery stores.
*   **B: I ngā pou tereina (Bus stops):**  Less common place to buy prepaid phone cards.
*   **D: I ngā waea utu (Prepaid phone stores):**  While these exist, the text implies a more general retail location like a grocery store.



"
He pēhea te āheitanga o ngā mokatere waea pai ake i tukuna e ētahi kāri?,"The correct answer is **C: Kei te pātaka kokonga (Are stored in the chip)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some cards have special features for making cheaper calls to certain countries.  This feature is typically stored *within the card itself* (in the chip). The other options don't fit:

* **A: Ka taea anake te uru atu ki ngā whenua tauwhāiti (Can only call overseas):** While some cards might be used for international calls, it doesn't explain *how* the cheaper rates are achieved.
* **B: Mā ngā tau wātea-utu (Through free minutes):**  The passage mentions a free calling credit, but the feature enabling cheaper rates to specific countries isn't about free minutes.
* **D: Mā te whakamahi waea utu me te utu i tētahi utu tāpiri (By using prepaid calls and paying an extra fee):**  The passage doesn't say that cheaper rates require a separate fee.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā rākau e whai ake nei he iti iho te pūnoa i roto i te pāka ā iwi o Plitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **A: Ōkahu (Beech)**.

The passage states: ""He nui te ngahere ki te Plitvice Lakes national park, **ko te nuinga he rākau beech, he spruce, he fir**..."" This means beech is one of the *most* common types of trees.  Therefore, it's *not* the least common. Spruce and Fir are also mentioned as common.  The passage doesn't mention ""oki"" or ""riniki"".
"
Ko tēhea o ngā ao kararehe āhua kore e whai ake nei e kitea ana i roto i te pāka ā iwi o Plitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngā kararehe ongeonge pērā i te pia parāone o Ūropi, i te wuruhi, i te īkara, i te koukou, i te riniki, i te ngeru mohoao, i te **capercaillie** ka kitea ki reira..."" (Wild animals such as the European otter, lynx, wolf, bear, fox, wild boar, and **capercaillie** can be found there...).

The other options are not mentioned in the text:

*   Turkey - Not mentioned
*   Honey Badger - Not mentioned
*   Cassowary - Not mentioned



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha tonu ngā waehere rohe e āwhina ana?","The correct answer is **D: tārua kore mana (non-mana/non-copyright)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Inā rā, kāore he paku aha tā ngā uhingaro rohe mō ngā mahi tā turekore; He iti mō te iti kape o tētahi kōpae ka pūrei pai noa i ki tētahi taputapu e pūrei ai te mea taketake.""  This translates to: ""In that case, there are no legal remedies for illegal activities; even a small number of copies are easily replaced by a tool that protects the property.""  This directly refers to a lack of copyright protection (tārua kore mana) as the core problem.

While the passage mentions ""mana mākete"" (market power), it's presented as *the reason* for the issue, not what's being *helped* by the lack of protection.  The passage argues that giving companies more market power is the root cause of the problem. ""Tārua kōpae"" (copyright) is related, but the text specifies the *absence* of it being the issue.  ""Āraitanga Piracy"" (Piracy) is a *result* of the lack of protection, not a helping factor.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he teka mō ngā waehere rohe e mau tonu ana e ngā kamupene pāpāho?","The correct answer is **A: E hiahiatia ana kia whiwhi mana mākete anō** (They need to gain market share).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Te tino take ko te tuku i te mana whakahaere nui ake ki aua kamupene mō ā rātou mākete; e pā katoa ana i te hanga pūtea."" (The main reason is to give these companies greater managerial power over their markets; it's all about making money.)

This clearly indicates the driving force behind the regional authorities' policies is to help the tech companies gain and maintain market share.  The passage highlights the prioritization of financial gain (""hanga pūtea"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ka āwhina rātau ki te karo i te tāruatanga ture kore mana** (They help them avoid illegal activity): While potentially a side effect, it's not the *main* reason. The focus is on market share and profit.
* **C: He whai painga rātau mo te takahuri moni** (They benefit from the financial turnover):  The passage mentions financial gain, but it's linked directly to market share.
* **D: Āhua kore nei rātau e āwhina ki te ārai i te tāpaetanga** (They don't help to regulate the restriction):  The passage indicates the opposite – they are loosening restrictions to benefit the companies.



"
"Ina tae ki tō kāinga tupu, ko tēhea tukanga he ōpaki noa iho?","The best answer is **C: Ngā tepe ture o ngā tūemi (Immigration laws)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks about the process for entering your home country (referring to a country of origin).
* The initial statement discusses potential delays and frustrations with immigration authorities.
* The need to be aware of what's permitted and not permitted, and to declare everything above legal thresholds, directly relates to **immigration laws**. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ngā taki manene (Visa applications)** - While visa applications are part of the immigration process, they are a *step within* immigration laws, not the overall process itself.
* **B: Kei te kōrero i ngā tūemi (They are talking about immigration)** - This is too vague. While the context is about immigration, it doesn't specify the *process*.
* **D: Mana ritenga (Sovereignty)** - This is irrelevant to the process of entering a country.

Therefore, **C: Ngā tepe ture o ngā tūemi** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer. It encompasses the legal framework governing entry into a country.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei me mōhio koe i mua i to taenga atu ki tō kāinga tupu?,"The correct answer is **D: Mēnā kāore e whakaaetia ngā tūemi e kawea mai ana e koe.**

Here's why:

The question states that you should be aware of what is and isn't allowed to be brought into the country, and to declare anything exceeding legal limits. Option D directly reflects this need to know what is *not* permitted, as that necessitates declaring it.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly relevant to the initial statement:

*   **A: Mēnā he wāhitaki nekeneke:** While a quarantine period might be a factor, it's not the primary thing you *must* be aware of *before* arriving.
*   **B: Mēnā e hiahia ana koe ki te whakapuaki tūemi i runga i ngā tepe ā-ture:** Declaring items is a *consequence* of knowing what's allowed/not allowed, not the core piece of information to be aware of beforehand.
*   **C: Mēnā he Mana Ritenga:**  This refers to a specific legal concept and is not generally required knowledge for all travelers.

Therefore, knowing about **not being able to bring certain items** is the most crucial piece of pre-travel information related to the prompt.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he nui tonu ngā mea e āhei ai ngā kaipiki ki te kite i ngā ararere hōu i roto i te Awaawa o Cochamó?","The correct answer is **A: Ngā tirohanga (Views)**.

The passage states: ""Kei te whakatūtū tonu ngā kaipiki mai i ngā tōpito katoa o te ao i ngā ara hou ki ōna pakitara mutunga kore."" which translates to ""Cyclists from all over the world are constantly seeking new routes to its endless trails.""  The context indicates they are seeking new *views* or vistas. The passage also mentions ""tihi"" (mountains) and ""tirohanga mīharo i ngā tihi"" (spectacular views of the mountains), reinforcing the idea that the new routes are sought for the views they offer.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

*   **B: Huihuinga (Gatherings)** - The passage doesn't mention gatherings.
*   **C: Tihi (Mountains)** - While mountains are mentioned, the passage focuses on the *routes* providing new views *of* the mountains.
*   **D: Ngā pātū (Shelters)** - The passage doesn't mention shelters.
"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i homai i roto i te wāhanga, ko wai e hipoki ana i te nuinga o ngā whakawhiti i te Hau-ā-uru?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The text states: ""E hara tēnei rerenga [LATAM Oneworld] i te kōwhiringa kotahi ki te hiahia koe ki te hiki i te Tonga o te Moana nui a Kiwa me te tai uru o Amerika ki te Tonga. **E ūhia e Star Alliance te katoa atu i te taha Rāwhiti o te Tonga o te Moana a Kiwa mai i Santiago de Chile ki Tahiti**...""

This indicates that Star Alliance operates the majority of flights in the South Pacific route mentioned.
"
Ko tēhea hononga rererangi e whakaiti ana i te iti rawa o ngā whakawhiti moana i te hauwhā ki te Tonga?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The passage states: ""Ehara tēnei rerenga [LATAM Oneworld] i te kōwhiringa kotahi ki te hiahia koe ki te hiki i te Tonga o te Moana nui a Kiwa me te tai uru o Amerika ki te Tonga. **Ka ūhia e Star Alliance te katoa atu i te taha Rāwhiti o te Tonga o te Moana a Kiwa mai i Santiago de Chile ki Tahiti.**""

This clearly indicates that Star Alliance offers a route that reduces the number of connections needed to travel to the South Pacific.
"
Ko tēhea whakahaere haereere i tutuki ai ngā Haerenga Whakahaere Huri noa?,"The correct answer is **B: Haere ki nga haerenga oma** (Go to tour companies).

Here's why:

The text states that The Global Running Tours partners with various tour companies. It specifically mentions Running Tours Barcelona, Running Tours Copenhagen, and Running Tours Prague as examples. This indicates that these are *tour companies* that are part of the Global Running Tours network.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Whakahaere ana i Koupākihi** (Managing businesses): While the tour companies are businesses, the question is asking *which type* of organization organizes the tours.
*   **C: Whakahaere ana i ngā Haerenga Prague** (Managing Prague Tours): This is too specific. The Global Running Tours has tours in multiple cities, not just Prague.
*   **D: Whakahaere ana i ngā Haereere Barcelona** (Managing Barcelona Tours): Similar to C, this is too specific. The company operates in multiple locations.

"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka awhina a Go Running Tours ki te hono atu e hia nga momo whakahaere tirotiro?","The correct answer is **A: Whā**.

The passage states: ""The global presence of The Global Running Tours is rapidly expanding to meet the demand of runners in four major countries."" This directly indicates there are four countries where they are expanding.
"
He aha te mahi a te manuhiri ki te mea e tumanako ana ia kia tino kitea te cheetah?,"The correct answer is **C: Whakamahia ngā karu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ētahi kararehe pēnei i ngā arewhana me ngā Hirāwhe ka whakatata atu i ētahi wā ki ngā motokā, ā, mā te **taputapu ngāwari noa e whai wāhi atu ai ki te tirohanga papai.**"" This translates to: ""Some animals like leopards and hyenas will sometimes come to cars, and with **simple optical instruments participating in the observation.**""

The text also mentions ""ka whakamā i ētahi wā ngā raiona, ngā tīta, ngā rēpara hoki, ā, ka pai ake tō kite i a rātou ki ngā karu whakatata."" meaning that sometimes regions, watering holes, and campsites are visited and sightings of them (the animals) are improved.

This suggests using binoculars (or other optical instruments) to spot the cheetah. Options A, B, and D are less directly supported by the text's focus on spotting the cheetah.
"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ko tēhea momo kararehe tērā pea ka tūtaki i te wā o te whakawhānuitanga i roto i te waka?","The correct answer is **B: Giraffes**.

The text states: ""Ētahi kararehe pēnei i ngā arewhana me ngā Hirāwhe ka whakatata atu i ētahi wā ki ngā motokā..."" which translates to ""Some animals like giraffes and zebras will sometimes come to the vehicles...""

Therefore, giraffes are mentioned as an animal that might be seen in the vehicle during a safari.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te utu o te haereere?","The correct answer is **C: Haere ana me tētahi atu tangata**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He iti ake ngā haerenga mō ngā rōpu nui nei, nā reira mēnā e haere takitahi ana, takirua ana rānei, me whakahoahoa haere kia iti iho te utu ki ia tangata.""  This translates to ""There are fewer trips for larger groups, so if you go alone, or if there are few people, you have to subsidize to reduce the cost per person.""

The passage then goes on to say, ""Heoi, ehara i te mea me aro koe ki tēnei kūraruraru, i te mea i te nuinga o te wā ka hurihuri ngā tūruhi kia whakakī i ngā motokā."" This means ""However, you shouldn't worry about this, because most of the time the schedules will change to fill the vehicles."" This implies the cost is tied to traveling *with* others.

Therefore, the cost of the trip is determined by traveling with other people.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai pea ka haumaru i te mokatere whakaterenga tino pai?","The correct answer is **A: Ko nga tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te riwhi motokā** (Groups that require a large capacity).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He iti ake ngā haerenga mō ngā rōpu nui nei, nā reira mēnā e haere takitahi ana, takirua ana rānei, me whakahoahoa haere kia iti iho te utu ki ia tangata."" (There are fewer trips for larger groups, so if you go alone or have a small group, the cost needs to be reduced per person.)

This implies that larger groups (requiring more capacity) are *less* likely to get the benefit of a reduced cost per person, because the tours will likely fill the vehicles.  Therefore, the groups that *require* a large capacity are the ones who are most vulnerable to the tour operators raising prices.



The other options are less directly supported by the passage:

*   **B: He rōpū tokotoru (A group of three)** - The passage doesn't specifically mention groups of three.
*   **C: Tokorua nga hoa e haere tahi ana (Two friends traveling together)** - Similar to B, this is not specifically mentioned.
*   **D: He rōpū tokorima (A group of five)** - Again, not specifically mentioned.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina ki te āhukahuka puta noa i te ao o San Francisco?","The correct answer is **A: He arotahi auau i roto i ngā momo toi me te pāpāho** (A strong tradition in the arts and entertainment).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Te tōaitanga o ngā puoro, ngā kiriata, ngā tuhinga me ngā ahurea rongonui i āwhina ai i te tāone me ana wāhi papai kia hau te rongo i te ao."" This translates to ""The tradition of music, movies, literature, and popular cultures has helped the city and its tourist sites to gain recognition worldwide.""

Option A best captures this idea of a strong tradition in the arts and entertainment, which is what contributes to San Francisco's global reputation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngā pūkenga o te hui kāniwha o runga** (Top-notch conference facilities) - While San Francisco *does* have good conference facilities, the passage focuses more on the cultural contributions.
* **C: Te rerenga kētanga o te ohaoha** (The surfing trend) - Surfing is mentioned as an attraction, but it's not presented as the primary contributor to global recognition.
* **D: He tirohanga kai Āhia e tū mai nei** (A rising Asian vista) - The passage *does* mention Asian cuisine being available, but it's presented as an attraction *for* Asian visitors, not as a factor in San Francisco's global appeal.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki San Francisco ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **A: He rite tonu te whakaaturanga i roto i ngā whitiāhua me ngā pukapuka (It is the same as the display in galleries and books)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that San Francisco's industry includes ""ngā puoro, ngā kiriata, ngā tuhinga me ngā ahurea rongonui"" (music, movies, writing, and popular cultures). This indicates a thriving arts and culture scene.
*   Option A, however, suggests that San Francisco's industry is *only* represented in galleries and books. The passage offers a much broader view of the city's cultural contributions.
*   Options B and C are directly supported by the passage. The text mentions that San Francisco is a good place for Asian cuisine (""He tētahi o ngā wahi pai rawa o te motu mō ērā atu kai Āhia"") and that the city has many hotels and conference centers (""Kua whakawhanaketia e San Francisco te hanganga tūruhi rahi whai i ngā tini hōtēra, whare kai, whare hui kounga anō hoki"").
*   Option D is not fully accurate. While tourism is important, the passage clearly outlines a diversified economy including industries like finance, technology (implied by the ""tūruhi"" - industry), and the arts.

Therefore, the statement about being *only* represented in galleries and books is the least accurate reflection of the information provided.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo haere kāore pea e whai hua ki te whakamahi i ngā ratonga a te māngai haere?","The correct answer is **C: He tangata haere kāore anō kia whiwhi i tana visa** (A person who has not yet obtained a visa).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that travel agents help with arrangements *after* travel plans are largely in place. A crucial element of travel planning is obtaining the necessary visas. If someone hasn't secured their visa yet, the travel agent can't effectively make arrangements because the trip might not even be possible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: He haere whakarihariha (Business travelers):** Business travelers often have complex itineraries and require specific arrangements (flights, hotels, transportation), making them ideal candidates for travel agent assistance.
* **B: He tangata haere noa (Leisure travelers):** Leisure travelers frequently benefit from travel agents' assistance with flights, accommodation, and activities.
* **D: He tangata haere e pai ana ki te tono mo nga putea (People who are good at applying for funds):**  The ability to apply for funds doesn't negate the need for travel arrangements. Travel agents can still assist with logistics, even if funding is secured independently.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei painga o te tono mā tētahi kaihoko haerenga?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngā mahi hōtēra (Hotel tasks)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how travel agents help with pre-trip planning and logistics, specifically:

*   **Accommodation:** Booking hotels (or other lodging like hostels)
*   **Transportation:** Arranging flights and transfers
*   **Information:** Providing details about the destination (maps, brochures)
*   **Flexibility:** Handling changes and requests.

""Ngā mahi hōtēra"" (Hotel tasks) is too broad and doesn't fit within the context of the passage, which centers on the *planning and logistical* aspects of a trip. Hotel tasks are part of the *stay*, not the pre-trip arrangements that a travel agent primarily assists with.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Ngā tuhinga haere kua manakohia (Desired travel documents):** The passage states they can help you plan for things like visas or other documents needed for your trip.
*   **C: Ngā mōkī tārewa-katoa (Comprehensive itineraries):** The passage explicitly mentions they can help you think about your itinerary and even provide maps or brochures.
*   **D: Kei te pupuri i tētahi tūtohutanga (Maintaining a schedule/plan):** The passage highlights that they can help you stick to your planned arrival or departure times.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha ngā taupānga kaiwhakamāori kupu wā tūturu kāore e taea?","The correct answer is **D: E whakamāori ana tika 100% o te wā**.

The text explicitly states: ""me āta titiro, kei hē pea hoki"" (and be careful, it might be wrong). This directly contradicts the idea that they translate 100% accurately.  The other options are mentioned as things the technology *can* do.
"
He aha ngā whakawhitinga ka taea te mahi tuimotu?,"The correct answer is **C: Tikiake raraunga reo (Access language data)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...e whakaritea ana te whakawhitinga reo tuimotu ā muri i te tikiake i te raraunga o te reo e hiahiatia ana.""  This translates to ""...it provides machine translation by accessing the data of the required language.""

Therefore, the key function described is the ability to *access language data* for machine translation.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e taea te whakaoho i avalanches?,"The correct answer is **C: Te ra (The sun)**.

Here's why:

The text describes various triggers for avalanches:

*   **Huka hāpiri (Fire/Heat):** Can melt snow and destabilize slopes.
*   **Tangata (Humans):**  Activities like skiing or explosions can trigger avalanches.
*   **He hukarere tāpiri (Additional/supplemental trigger):**  This refers to other factors that can contribute to an avalanche, such as changes in snowpack.
*   **Hukarere (Snowfall):** Heavy snowfall can add weight to the snowpack, increasing the risk of an avalanche. 

The sun can contribute to avalanche danger by melting snow, but it isn't *directly* a trigger in the same way as the others listed. The sun’s effect is more gradual, whereas the other options can cause more immediate destabilization.

Therefore, the sun is the least likely to *directly* cause an avalanche compared to the other options.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei e heke iho ana hei horonga?","The correct answer is **C: He rōrahi hukarere e hiahiatia ana i runga i ngā pānaki poupou.**

Here's why:

The passage states that ""ko te raru ko te piri o te hukapapa, nō reira me turupana kia heke mai, ā, ko te hukapapa e heke ana pea te mahi turupana mō te toenga."" This means the problem is the connection of the threads (hukapapa), so they need to be spun and the threads themselves need to be spun for the process. It also mentions that sometimes the process involves warming the thread, sometimes other threads, sometimes other Maori activities, and sometimes the person.

The passage emphasizes the need for **thread (hukarere)** as a crucial element in the weaving process and highlights that it's something that needs to be spun.  Option C directly addresses this need, stating that a **thread loom (rōrahi hukarere)** is needed based on the woven design (pānaki poupou).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ko te hukarere piri kāore i te whakaoho (The spun thread is not warmed):** The passage mentions warming threads *sometimes*, so this is not universally true.
*   **B: Ngā rākau pakū, kahore he hukarere (The warp threads, there is no thread):** The passage specifically talks about the *weft* threads (hukapapa), not the warp threads.
*   **D: Ko te hukarere i mahue i te tangata (The thread has bound the person):** This is not mentioned in the passage and is an incorrect interpretation.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko te kare i takea mai i ēhea mea whakarato?","The correct answer is **B: Otaota me nga mea kakara**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *kai kari* (fermented food) is made from ingredients like:

*   ""o taota"" (herring)
*   ""ngā rau kikini"" (seaweed)
*   ""tahi ki te mīti"" (and sometimes vegetables)
*   ""te huawhenua rānei"" (or even the ground/soil)

The passage also mentions miraka (fermented liquid) being used with these ingredients. Therefore, the core ingredients used to make *kai kari* are things like seafood (herring, etc.) and vegetables, which falls under ""o taota me nga mea kakara""."
"I ētahi rohe, i ētahi wā ka whakamahia te waiu kōkō hei whakakapi i te aha o te mea i roto i te kari?","The correct answer is **A: Mīti (Vegetables)**.

The passage states: ""Ko te kai kari tētahi kai kua whakaritea ki ngā otaota, ki ngā rau kikini, **tahi ki te mīti**, te huawhenua rānei."" This translates to: ""Food preserved in salt is food preserved in fish, in leaves, **and in vegetables**, the earth, etc.""

Therefore, vegetables are one of the things preserved in a ""kari.""
"
He aha i tika ai te huri huri noa i ngā Maunga Transantarctic kia eke ai ki te papa?,"The correct answer is **D: He ngāwari kē atu i te haere mā te Moana Ross.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the South Pole is 1600km from McMurdo via a difficult, icy route.
* It also mentions that only specialized teams can access the South Pole for maintenance and resupply, and that the route through the Transantarctic Mountains is long and difficult.
* Option D suggests an alternative - traveling via the Ross Sea - which would be easier than the mountain route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I te nuinga o te wā ka katia te Teihana McMurdo:** This doesn't explain *why* going through the mountains is difficult.
* **B: He mōrearea te hukarere kiato:** While an icy route is difficult, the passage emphasizes the *length* and *difficulty* of the Transantarctic Mountains, not just the ice.
* **C: Kaore nga tarakihana motuhake i te nimble:**  The passage states that only specialized teams can go, but doesn't say they aren't nimble. Nimble refers to being quick and agile; it's not the key issue.



Therefore, the most logical answer is that traveling via the Ross Sea would be a less challenging option.



"
"I te taha o te South Pole Traverse, he aha te mea kua tohua ki nga haki?","The correct answer is **B: tarakihana e mau ana i te hinu (crevasses marked with ropes)**.

The passage states: ""It is a fixed, marked track, **with ropes attached to the crevasses**."" 

Therefore, options A, C, and D are incorrect.
"
He aha te mea e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei mea e tika ana kia mōhio nga turuhi ina tūhura i te Tonga o Awherika?,"The correct answer is **A: He rerekē ngā whakaritenga o nga Iwi rerekē mō ngā Visa** (Visa requirements vary between different countries).

Here's why:

* The passage focuses on vehicle suitability, road conditions, and legal requirements for driving in South America.
* **Visa requirements** are a crucial aspect of traveling to any foreign country. The passage *doesn't* mention the varying visa requirements for different nationalities and countries within South America.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ko te tirotiro i te motokā he huarahi pai ki te haere ki ngā wāhi i waho i te ara i whiua** (Checking the vehicle is a good way to go to places outside the awarded road). While vehicle inspection is important, the passage doesn't explicitly state it's *the best* way to navigate off-road. It just mentions the need for a 4x4 in certain conditions.
* **C: Tata tonu ki ngā whenua katoa e noho tata ana ki Awherika ki te Tonga e mau ana** (Stay continuously in all countries close to South America).  The passage discusses traveling *within* South America, not staying in neighboring countries.
* **D: Ka taunakitia he 4x4 mēnā ka haere mā te motokā** (A 4x4 is recommended if you go by car).  The passage *does* recommend a 4x4.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te tohutohu kino mo nga tūruhi e kimi ana ki te hōpara i Awherika ki te Tonga ma te motokā?","The correct answer is **A: E hiahiatia ana pea ētahi tūemi ohorere i roto i te motokā e te ture.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...kei ia motu hoki he ture ahurei e here ana i ngā rawa ohotata me noho ki roto i te waka."" This means there are regulations regarding weapons and what can be carried in a vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ahakoa e tūtohutia ana he 4x4, ka taea te toro atu ki te nuinga o ngā wāhi mā te waka noa:** The passage says a 4x4 is *often* necessary for higher-clearance roads, implying it's not always sufficient.
* **C: He tino nui te haere mā te motokā mo te hunga e kimi ana ki te whakatakariri i nga ara noa iho:** The passage indicates that while driving is possible, it requires careful planning due to varying road conditions and regulations.
* **D: Ehara i te mea tino pai ngā whenua katoa e noho tata ana ki Awherika ki te toro:** The passage doesn't say that *all* neighboring countries are bad to visit, just that planning is crucial.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga hei mōrearea mōrearea o te waiho i ō putea e kore e tirohia?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka taea e koe te mōhio hei kaikawe rongoā (You might know you're a healer)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the dangers of leaving shellfish exposed, specifically mentioning:

*   **Navigation:** Getting lost and ending up in unfamiliar territory.
*   **Danger:** Becoming a pawn (unwittingly) and facing serious consequences.
*   **Economic consequences:**  Long-term loss of fishing rights or even death in some areas.
*   **Vulnerability:**  Shellfish are defenseless and susceptible to exploitation.
*   **Exploitation by authorities:**  Authorities can monitor and punish violations.

Option B, ""You might know you're a healer,"" is *not* addressed in the passage. The passage deals with the shellfish themselves being vulnerable, not the person who might be aware of healing abilities.

The other options *are* touched upon:

*   **A: Tērā pea ka tāhaetia rātau (They might be poisoned)** - Implied by the dangers of consuming shellfish from unsafe conditions.
*   **C: Ka taea rātau te pōraru ki tētahi atu tangata (They could be stolen by other people)** -  Falls under the category of exploitation.
*   **D: Tērā pea ka tirohia rātau e ngā mana hei tuma pōma tūpono (They might be checked by authorities to meet proper standards)** - Directly mentioned as a consequence of violations.



"
He aha te mea kāore i whakahuatia i roto i te wāhanga e pā ana ki te kawe tarukino?,"The correct answer is **B: Me whai whakaaro anō i te wā e haere ana ki te ao whānui.**

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the dangers of accidentally smuggling and the potential severe consequences (long prison sentences, death). Options A, C, and D all relate to potential consequences or methods related to smuggling which *are* mentioned or implied in the passage.

Option B, ""Me whai whakaaro anō i te wā e haere ana ki te ao whānui"" (You should also consider the time you are traveling to the wider world), is not directly addressed in the passage. The passage doesn't discuss the overall planning or considerations of traveling abroad, only the smuggling risks.

He aha te momo inu e kore e whakahuatia hei mea hei whakamātau i te hanga i te kāinga i te wā o te hararei?,"The correct answer is **A: waiu (water)**.

The passage specifically mentions coffee in the morning and chamomile tea in the evening as things to prepare at home during holidays. It also suggests making a refreshing drink with mint or other herbs, which could be made with a blender.  Water is not mentioned in any of these contexts.

"Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei me toro atu koe i a koe e noho hararei ana, mēnā e mōhiotia ana tō taone mō tōna ahurea inu?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā toenga e ahu mai ana i te tī maero (Tea houses)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ko tēhea o ngā mea e whai ake nei me toro atu koe i a koe e noho hararei ana, mēnā e mōhiotia ana tō taone mō tōna ahurea inu?"" which translates to: ""Which of the following should you visit when on holiday, if your town is known for its drinking culture?""  The passage then says, ""Ko tēnei tō tāone, he ahurea inuinu, me haere ki ngā pāpara kāuta ki ngā pāpara rānei kei ngā whare tata ehara i te wāhi haerenga māu."" which translates to ""This is your town, it has a drinking culture, and you should go to tea houses or cafes near you, which are not your usual haunts.""

Therefore, tea houses (ngā toenga e ahu mai ana i te tī maero) are specifically mentioned as a place to explore when visiting a town with a strong drinking culture.



The other options are less relevant:

*   **A: Ngā toa kawhe i waho o tō hoa noho (Coffee shops outside your usual haunts):** While coffee shops are mentioned in the passage, tea houses are highlighted as a more unique cultural experience in a town known for its drinking.
*   **B: Ngā toa Juice, māeneene rānei (Juice bars, etc.):** This isn't directly related to a ""drinking culture.""
*   **C: Pubs kāore koe i te auau noa iho (Pubs are not your usual haunts):**  While pubs are part of a drinking culture, the passage suggests exploring *new* types of establishments. Tea houses fit this suggestion perfectly.



"
Kai hea nga whakairo Dove?,"The correct answer is **D: I roto i te whare karakia**.

The text states: ""I roto i te whare karakia, he whakapakoko kukupa māpere nei kei runga i ētahi urupā."" which translates to ""In the church, there is a beautiful wooden crucifix on top of some graves.""

Therefore, the Dove carvings (which the question refers to as ""whakairo Dove"") are located in the church.
"
He aha te momo visa e hiahiatia ai e te tangata te whakaatu i te taunakitanga o te tautoko moni e tika ana?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ākonga (Student Visa)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Mō te nuinga o ngā iwi, me whai reta whakaaetanga mai i te kuratini e hiahiatia ana, me ngā kōrero tautoko ā-pūtea e taunaki ana i a koe anō mō te tau tuatahi o tō tohu."" This refers to student visas, where financial support needs to be demonstrated.
"
Ko wai e tino hiahiatia ana he visa whānui?,"The correct answer is **C: He Ākonga ao whānui (A Student)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hiahia i tētahi noho roa ake i te haere ki reira hei tūruhi poka noa. Ngā hiahia o ngā visa ākonga me ngā tikanga tonotono tēnā i ngā mea tūruhi me ngā visa pākihi."" This means student visas generally require longer stays, unlike short-term tourist or business visas.
"
Āhea koe e tino māharahara ai ki nga waeroa?,"The correct answer is **A: I roto i ngā marama raumati** (In the summer months).

Here's why:

* **The passage talks about summer (raumati) and the risks of hiking in the rain during that time.**  The first sentence explicitly mentions being aware of dangers when hiking in the rain *during summer*.
* **Option A directly reflects this context.** The question asks when the person remembers the dangers.  The passage sets up a connection between the danger and the summer months.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **B: I runga i nga hīkoi (On hikes):** While the dangers are related to hiking, the passage doesn't focus solely on hiking as the trigger for remembrance.
* **C: I te ngahere (In the forest):** The forest is the setting, but not the specific time of remembrance.
* **D: I a koe e taraiwa ana (When you are wet):** Being wet is a *condition* that increases the danger, but the passage doesn't say that being wet is what someone remembers.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, me aha koe kia kore ai e mahi kia kore ai e ārai i ngā waeroa i a koe e taraiwa ana i te ngahere?","The correct answer is **A: He roa rawa te tuwhera o nga tatau o te waka** (The opening of the canoe is very wide).

Here's why:

The passage says that the canoe's open sides allow rain to come in and then are closed by the rain itself. This implies the *width* of the opening is the key factor. A wider opening means more rain can get in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: taraiwa ana i te raumati** (walking in summer):  While the passage mentions summer, it's not *what* you should be aware of. The awareness is about the canoe's opening.
*   **C: taraiwa ana i ngā wāhi pūroto** (walking in rainy places): Similar to B, this refers to where you are walking, not the cause of the problem.
*   **D: Kei te mahue i te waka i te wā e hīkoi ana** (Keeping the canoe afloat while walking): This is irrelevant to the passage, which is about how rain enters the canoe.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei i runga i ngā Sundarbans ehara i te tika?","The correct answer is **B: Ko te hawhe o tōna rohe tāpeke e hīpokina ana i roto i te repe (Two-thirds of its area is submerged in the estuary).**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ko te horahanga o te 3,850 km2 ngā Sundarbans, ā, ko te kotahi-hautoru e whakakapia ana ki ngā wāhi wai/kōreporepo (The Sundarbans spans 3,850 km2, and it is composed of freshwater/brackish water areas)."" This indicates the area is *composed of* freshwater/brackish areas, not submerged.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct:

* **A: He āhuatanga o ētahi o ngā ngahere kaha ruarua e toe ana (It is a feature of some of the most powerful mangrove forests):** The text describes the Sundarbans as mangrove forests and mentions they are part of the largest deltas.
* **C: Ko te tātua nui rawa tēnei o te ao (It is the largest of its kind in the world):** The text explicitly states ""Ko te tātua nui rawa tēnei o te ao (It is the largest of its kind in the world).""
* **D: He kāinga ki te tini atu o ngā hipi māka i ngā taika o Bengal (It is home to a large number of endangered species of Bengal):** The text states ""ānaphoto te tini atu o ngā hipi māka i ngā taika o Bengal (and is home to a large number of endangered species of Bengal).""



"
Ko tēhea wāhanga o te ngahere e takoto ana i roto i te rohe o Indian?,"The correct answer is **A: Papa Ā-Motu o Sundarbans**.

The text states: ""Ko te ingoa o te wāhanga ngahere kei te rohe Inia, ko Sundarbans National Park.""  ""Sundarbans National Park"" is the Indian designation for the forest within India. ""Papa Ā-Motu o Sundarbans"" is the Māori translation for Sundarbans Archipelago, which encompasses the Sundarbans National Park in India.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko wai te hunga e tino mōhio ana ki te reo Ingarihi?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā tāngata e haere ana ki Toronto**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He nui ngā whenua katoa e matatau katoa ana ki te reo Ingarihi, ā, he nui atu anō ngā whenua kei reira te mātauranga here - inarā ki roto i ngā rangatahi. Whai whakaarotia, mēnā e pai ana ki a koe, tētahi Mancunian, tētahi Bostonian, tētahi Jamaican me tētahi Syeneysider e noho ana ki tētahi tēpu e kai ana ki tētahi wharekai ki Toronto.""

This section emphasizes that people in Toronto (and the example of people from various backgrounds dining in Toronto) are exposed to and educated about different languages and cultures. This implies they have a degree of familiarity with English, as they are navigating a diverse environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā tāngata e kōrero ana i ētahi atu reo e rua:** While bilingualism is mentioned, it's not the defining characteristic of who is knowledgeable in English.
* **B: Ngā tāngata taitamariki i te pakeketanga:** The passage doesn't specifically link English proficiency to children in the workforce.
* **D: Ngā tāngata pakeke ake i te pakeke:** The passage doesn't suggest that older adults are more knowledgeable in English.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te uaua ki te whakahua?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā kupu tuhituhi (Written words)**.

The passage states: ""I te nuinga o te wā he māma ake te mārama ki ngā kupu tuhituhi tēnā i ngā kupu kōrero."" which translates to ""Most of the time, written words are more clear than spoken words.""  This directly indicates that understanding written words is often more difficult than understanding spoken words.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngā Kupu i roto i ngā nako motuhake (Words in slang)** While slang is mentioned, the main difficulty isn't specifically attributed to slang.
*   **B: Ngā Wāhitau (Times/Situations)** The passage mentions challenges in situations and locations, but the core difficulty isn't *situational*.
*   **D: Argot paetata (Computer jargon)** This isn't mentioned in the passage."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āhuatanga pai mō te tangata haere e whakamahere ana ki te hopu pahi mai i te teihana ā-rohe?","The correct answer is **A: Kei te haere te kaihaere ki Jakar, ā, kua hokona kētia e ia he tīkiti i mua**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that buying tickets in advance is a good strategy for the mid-range bus routes, especially when traveling to places like Paro or Punkha.
* The passage mentions that buses to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
* Option A aligns with the advice to purchase tickets ahead of time *before* the journey.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:** Doesn't mention ticket purchasing in advance.
* **C:**  Mentions Paro and a time after 11, which isn't directly related to the advice about pre-booking.
* **D:** Talks about traveling to the east and arriving before 6:20, which isn't discussed in the passage.



"
He aha te tohutohu pai mō tētahi tūruhi e hiahia ana ki te haere ki te rawhiti mai i te teihana pahi?,"The correct answer is **B: Hokona he tīkiti tōmua (Buy a ticket in advance)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""I runga i te noho kī o ngā pahi waenga-rohe i te nuinga o ngā wā, he rautaki pai te hoko tīkiti ētahi rā i mua."" This translates to: ""Based on the frequency of mid-range buses most of the time, it's a good strategy to buy a ticket a few days in advance.""

While other options might be relevant in other situations, the text specifically recommends buying tickets in advance. Option A is incorrect because the text states buses *don't* run until after 8:30. Option C is incorrect as the text implies buses aren't running all day. Option D is a possibility, but the text doesn't recommend it over buying a ticket in advance.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei kōrero e kore e tika te whakaahua o Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: He āheikore nā te waka rererangi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ko Timbuktu, ahakoa he whakamaneatanga tūruhi i runga i tōna rongo, ā, he tauranga waka rererangi ki reira.""  This means Timbuktu *does* have a river port.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: He nui ake te mana o te reo Arapi i te toenga o te whenua:** The passage says Timbuktu is an Arab city in Africa, implying a significant Arabic influence and thus a strong Arabic language presence.
*   **B: He rawakore te pāngia:** While the passage doesn't directly state whether Timbuktu is prone to drought, it mentions the ""whakatuma o ngā oneone koraha"" (the rise of sand dunes) as the reason for its World Heritage status. This suggests drought and desertification *are* issues.
*   **D: He tāwhara tonu tēnei mo nga tūruhi pīrangi:** The passage says that the initial information about Timbuktu was a ""whakamaneatanga tūruhi"" (a tourist illusion), implying it's *not* just for tourists and has a deeper, more historical significance.

Therefore, only option C directly contradicts information presented in the passage.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka taea te Uru atu te Taone e te waka rererangi**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""...he tauranga waka rererangi ki reira."" which translates to ""...it is a flying ship port there."" (or a port for airships/flying vessels).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: He nui kē atu te hāngai i te māngere:** The text doesn't mention anything about a strong connection to the sea or shipping.
* **C: He iti iho tōna āhua o Awherika i nga tāone karapoti:** The text says it's a distinct type of town compared to other African towns and a ""Tāera Arabi tēnā i te Awherika"" (an Arab town in Africa).  It doesn't say it's *less* African.
* **D: Kua kore te taone e kawe mai i nga tūruhi:** The text states the town was historically known for its trade, and was designated a World Heritage site due to its old coral reefs, hinting at past economic activity.



"
I te wā anō i whakaritea ai ngā whakataetae Olympics o te raumati? ,"The correct answer is **B: Poutū 2020**.

The text states: ""Ka tū Ngā Taumāhekeheke o te Ao mō te Hunga Pararūtiki atu i te 24 o Ākuhata ki te 5 o Hepetema hei te tau 2021. Mēnā i hoko koe i ō rerenga, i tō whare noho mō te tau 2020 i mua i te whakapuakitanga o te takaroatanga..."" This indicates the Olympics were scheduled for Autumn 2020, but were postponed.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, I te wā āhea ka huri ai tētahi kōpaki hei hau-ā-rangi?","The correct answer is **A: Kia tae te hau ki te 100 maire ia haora**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He pou āwhiowhio te āwhā, he māmā te pūroto ka horomi noa i te hau ō roto, ō waho hoki. Ka puta ngā hau kaha (100-200 mairo/haora te nuinga) ā, e āhei ana te hiki i ngā mea nui ki te rangi..."" This directly links the formation of a dust devil (hau-ā-rangi) to winds reaching 100 mph.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Inā tīmata ngā tīwae o te hau ki te takahuri:** While swirling winds are involved, the passage doesn't specify this as the *trigger* for the dust devil. The speed of the wind is the key factor.
* **C: I a ia e heke iho ana i nga kapua āwhā:**  This is the result *after* the dust devil has formed, not the cause.
* **D: I muri i te whakapā atu ki te whenua:**  The passage doesn't mention the dust devil interacting with the ground as the initial formation trigger.  It's the wind speed that's important.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei he āhuatanga tika o te tornado?,"The correct answer is **A: I ngā wā katoa ka hangaia e rātau he hau huri noa i te 100-200 maire ia haora**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text explicitly states:** ""He puta ngā hau kaha (100-200 mairo/haora te nuinga) ā..."" (They produce strong winds (mostly 100-200 mph) and...). This directly supports option A.
* **Option B:** While tornadoes can sometimes have rotating walls, the text doesn't specifically mention this.
* **Option C:**  Tornadoes are relatively short-lived. The text indicates a brief initial formation and then dispersal.  It doesn't describe them *remaining* after hitting the ground.
* **Option D:** Tornadoes are characterized by rotating air *being pushed outwards*, not by actively pushing air *outwards*. They are a vortex of air.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, mai i te wāhi e whiwhi tohutohu ai te tangata haere e pā ana ki te āhuatanga tōrangapū i to rātau taone ūnga?","The correct answer is **D: Mai i to rātau ake kāwanatanga (From their own government)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ka hiahia hoki pea koe ki te aro atu ki ngā tohutohu o ngā kāwanatanga atu i tō ake, engari kei te hoahoatia ō rātou tohutohu mō te hunga nō tō rātou whenua ake.""  This translates to ""You may also need to pay attention to the guidelines of other governments, but their guidelines are being developed for those from their own country.""

Therefore, the guidelines a traveler should follow come from their *own* government.
"
"Mēnā he tohutohu haere, he aha te mea e kore e taea e te tangata ke te wheako?","The correct answer is **D: Ngā mōhiohio taipitopito e pā ana ki te āhuatanga tōrangapū o te whenua (Detailed knowledge about the country's features)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ngā kaitohutohu he kōrero whakarāpopoto noa mō ngā āhuatanga tōrangapū o te whenua kotahi."" This means guidelines are *general* and not detailed.
* **Option D directly reflects this:** It identifies detailed knowledge as something a traveler *cannot* experience based on the text.
* **The other options are incorrect because:**
    * A: Inihua whakakorenga kua pāngia - The text says travelers *might* experience this.
    * B: He whakarāpopototanga tino māmā mō te āhuatanga tōrangapū o te whenua - The text says guidelines are *general*, not *highly detailed*.
    * C: Inihua hauora kua pāngia - The text says travelers *might* experience this.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea momo haere te iti rawa e hiahiatia ana he āwhina tāpui mai i tētahi māngai haere?","The answer is **A: He haerenga ki tētahi hui mahi i tētahi taone kua tae atu te kaihaereere.**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel arrangements are most helpful when there are *many* arrangements similar to what you need. Option A describes a relatively simple trip – a business meeting in a city where the travel agent is already familiar. This would require less expertise and assistance than the other options.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: He haere roa e rua wiki i runga i tētahi Pūtea tino roa:** A two-week trip on a very expensive budget requires significant planning and knowledge of destinations, accommodations, and activities.
*   **C: He haere e whakaatu ana i tētahi ārai reo:** Trips that showcase language skills often involve cultural immersion and potentially navigating unfamiliar situations, requiring a more knowledgeable agent.
*   **D: Te haerenga tuatahi o te tangata haere ki rāwāhi:** A first-time trip to a remote location requires the most planning and expertise to ensure safety and a positive experience.

Therefore, a simple business trip where the agent is already familiar with the destination is the least demanding in terms of needing assistance from a travel agent.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tauari e tino whai hua mai i te āwhina a te māngai haere?","The correct answer is **D: Ina haere te haere ki tētahi tauwāhi e mōhiotia ai ngā rerekētanga ahurea ki a rātou.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that travel agents are particularly helpful when planning trips that involve exploring different aspects like culture, language, and unfamiliar environments (""haerenga o te taiao, te ahurea, te reo, ngā whenua pohara rānei""). 
* Option D directly aligns with this - traveling to a place where cultural differences are significant is where a travel agent's expertise is most valuable.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: I te wa e tono ana te kaihaereere i ngā rerenga haerenga kia toro atu ki tō rātou taone kāinga:** The passage doesn't mention this scenario.
* **B: Ina hiahia te haere ki te tāpui i tētahi whakawhānuitanga motuhake mo te wā tuatahi:** While a travel agent can help first-time travelers, it's not specifically highlighted as the *most* beneficial situation.
* **C: Mēnā e āhei ana te kaihaereere ki te kōrero i te reo taketake o te wāhi hararei:**  The ability to speak the local language is helpful, but the passage focuses more on navigating unfamiliar cultures and environments, not necessarily language proficiency.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te āwhina i te haere ki te karo i te matekiri i a ia e haere ana ki ngā wāhi hou?","The correct answer is **C: E haere ana ki aua ture ōrite ki te wāhi e noho ai rātau i.**

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that things are *different* when traveling to a new place (""ehara i te ōrite ngā āhuatanga ki ērā """"ki te kāinga""""""). It specifically lists things like customs, laws, food, and language.
* The passage explicitly states, ""...me mōhio koe ehara i te ōrite ngā āhuatanga ki ērā """"ki te kāinga"""". Ko ngā whanonga, ngā ture...ka āhua rerekē i te wāhi e noho nā koe."" This highlights the importance of understanding and adapting to the *local laws and customs*.
* Therefore, being aware of and adhering to the local laws and customs is the best way to avoid problems and potential danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Te tūmanako i ngā paerewa ōrite ki te wāhi i ahu mai ai rātou** (Hoping for the same expectations as where they come from) - This is directly contradicted by the passage's emphasis on differences.
* **B: He hiahia ki te whakamātau i ngā kai tauhou** (Having a desire to try new foods) - While trying new foods might be part of the experience, it's not directly related to avoiding danger or problems.
* **D: Kei te karo i te rangahau o mua i runga i te nohoanga** (Avoiding past research based on residence) - The passage encourages awareness and learning about the new place, not avoiding research.



"
"I runga anō i ngā mōhiohio i roto i te wāhanga nei, he aha te momo tangata ka raru ina haere ki tētahi whenua kē?","The correct answer is **D: Tētahi tangata e ngahau ana ki te ako (Someone who is eager to learn)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of being aware that things will be different in a new place. It lists various differences like customs, laws, food, transportation, etc.  The key phrase is ""mea me whai whakaaro e koe i mua i tō hāereere"" (things you need to consider before you travel). This suggests a mindset of openness and a willingness to adapt.

Someone who is eager to learn will be more open to understanding and adapting to these differences, leading to a smoother and more positive experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tētahi tangata e pīrangi ana ki ngā kai hāngai (Someone who wants comfort food):** While a desire for familiarity is understandable, the passage focuses on a broader awareness of cultural differences, not just food preferences.
* **B: Ko tētahi tangata i tipu ake i te huringa (Someone who grew up with change):**  While adaptability can come from growing up with change, the passage isn't necessarily targeting people who've always been adaptable. It's about being prepared for *new* change.
* **C: Ko tētahi tangata e hinengaro kati ana (Someone who is closed-minded):** The passage explicitly warns against this. A closed-minded person would be *more* likely to struggle in a new place.



"
Ko tehea o ēnei tohutohu e kore e tūtohutia mō ngā kaihaereere e haere ana ki tētahi whenua whanaketanga mō te wā tuatahi?,"The correct answer is **A: Me mōhio koe ki te ao kararehe paetata i mua i te moe i runga i te whenua.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly warns against being surprised by cultural differences.**  Knowing about local customs *before* arriving helps prevent misunderstandings and potential problems.
* **Option A directly contradicts this advice.** Knowing about local customs *before* sleeping on the ground isn't a standard piece of travel advice.
* **Options B, C, and D** align with the passage's advice to prioritize safety and comfort (good hotels, good food, reliable services, and protection from insects/diseases).



"
Ko tehea o ēnei e kore e whakahuatia hei mea e tika ana kia whakapau kaha ai te tangata ina haere ki tētahi whenua e whanake haere ana?,"The correct answer is **A: Kai kāhua-uru (Bed bugs)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes precautions to take when traveling to developing countries. It specifically mentions:

*   **Quality accommodations:** (Hōtēra whai kounga)
*   **Good food:** (Kai pai)
*   **Good healthcare:** (Ratonga pai)
*   **Avoiding bed bugs:** (Māuria mai tētahi moenga pēpi tēneti, tētahi moenga whakawerewere rānei kia noho wehe koe i ngā nākahi, i ngā hikutimo, i ngā aha atu)

The passage explicitly warns about bed bugs as a potential health risk, which aligns with the context of traveling to developing countries where sanitation may be less controlled. The other options (quality accommodations, good healthcare, and a bed net) are all suggested preventative measures to protect oneself from health issues.
"
"Ko tēhea o ngā kōwhiringa e whai ake nei te mea pai rawa mō te kaipupuri here e hiahia ana ki tētahi tārua mariko o tōna here, engari kāore pea he uru ki te ipurangi?","The correct answer is **C: Te pupuri i tētahi tārua i rokiroki i roto i te mahara o tō rātou pona.**

Here's why:

The original text says: ""Ki te hāereere koe ki tētahi rorohiko pōnaha, paparorohiko rānei, whakaputua tētahi tāruatanga ki tōna pūmahara, ki tētahi kōpae rānei (ka taea atu horekau te ipurangi).""  This translates to: ""If you go to a presentation, digital device, put a bookmark in their memory, on a slip of paper, etc. (cannot be online).""

Option C directly reflects this instruction – keeping a bookmark in their memory (or on a slip of paper).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: hoatu tārua ki tētahi hoa haere:** While helpful, it's not ideal if the person doesn't have internet access to easily retrieve it.
*   **B: Īmēra ana i a rātau anō he tārua:**  This requires internet access.
*   **D: penapena ana i tētahi tārua ki te “cloud”:** This also requires internet access.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei e kore e kitea i roto i te kaupapahere?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā tau waea aowhānui mō ngā whakamanatanga**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Me whakaatu atu e rātou te īmēra me ōna nama waea kia whiwhi tohutohu/whakamanatanga hoki mō te tuku kerēme."" This translates to ""They must provide their email and phone number to receive guidance/confirmation for sending the resume.""

While the text mentions phone numbers, it specifically links them to *receiving guidance/confirmation* about sending the resume.  It *doesn't* mention phone numbers for *verification* of anything.  The text also mentions email for confirmation, so the email is covered.  And the document creator (kapupuri kaupapahere) is not mentioned.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea rahi tōraro e whakaatu ana i te hōputu pikitia e tino whakamahia nuitia ana?","The correct answer is **C: 35 mm tōraro**.

The passage states: ""He nui ngā hanganga tewe rerekē kua whakamahia i roto i ngā tau. Ko te tewe aro whānui 35 mm (36 ki te 24 mm te whakaahua takahuri) te mea kei te tino whakamahia."" (Many different film formats have been used over the years. The 35mm film format (36 x 24 mm image frame) is the most widely used.)

Therefore, the 35mm lens is the most widely used.
"
Ko tēhea o ngā hōputu whitiāhua e whai ake nei e tuku ana i te taumira e ōrite ana ki tētahi DSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Whitiāhua 35 mm**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He nui ngā hanganga tewe rerekē kua whakamahia i roto i ngā tau. Ko te tewe aro whānui 35 mm (36 ki te 24 mm te whakaahua takahuri) te mea kei te tino whakamahia. I te nuinga o te wā he āhua māmā te whakahou mehemea ka pau, ā, ka āhua ōrite te ariari ki tētahi DSLF o nāianei.""

This directly indicates that a 35mm lens provides a similar behavior to a modern DSLR. The other options are either different focal lengths or formats not directly compared to the DSLR in the passage.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei te hipanga whakamutunga i te tīmatanga o tētahi umanga tuhituhi haere?","The correct answer is **C: Hangaia tō ake paetukutuku**.

Here's why:

The question describes the process of taking writing skills online and needing to create a personal website. Option C, ""Hangaia tō ake paetukutuku"" (Create your own website), is the logical final step in that process.  You need a website to showcase your work and establish your online presence.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Whakaharatau i te hōputu tukutuku (Respond to a job posting):** This is an *initial* step, not the final one in building a writing career.
* **B: Tuhia ētahi tuhinga mō tētahi rangitaki haerenga rongonui (Write some content for a well-known travel company):**  This is a potential *early* step, gaining experience, but not the ultimate goal of setting up your own online platform.
* **D: Kia pono ō pūkenga whakatika (Perfect your editing skills):** While important, editing skills are a continuous process and don't represent the final step of launching an online presence.



"
"I te wā e tīmata ana i tētahi pakihi tuhi haerenga, ko tēhea o ngā āheinga e whai ake nei e tika ana kia whakahoutia i te tuatahi?","The correct answer is **B: Hōputu tukutuku (Hosting)**.

Here's why:

* **Hosting (Hōputu tukutuku)** is a fundamental first step.  Before you can launch a website, you need a place to store your website files and make them accessible to the public.  This involves choosing a web hosting provider.

Let's look at why the other options are less appropriate as the *first* step:

* **Rangitaki (Domain Name):**  You need a domain name (like yourwebsite.com) to point to your hosting, but you can't host your site without hosting *first*. While you should register a domain early, it's secondary to securing a place to actually put your website.
* **Whakarerekē ana (Design):**  You need to have a foundation (hosting) before you can design a website. You can't design something without a place to put it.
* **Waihanga paetukutuku (Website Building):** This comes *after* you have hosting. You'll build the website using a content management system (CMS) like WordPress, or code it yourself.

Therefore, **hosting** is the crucial foundational step to get a writing travel business website online.
"
He aha te momo āhuarangi e kitea nuitia ana ngā Raruraru Whakamātautau?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngā āhuarangi wera (Hot climates)**.

The text specifically states: ""Ki ngā āhuarangi mahana ake ka tere ake te tupu a te huakita, ka roa hoki ake tana ora ki waho atu i te tinana. Ko ngā whiu a Delhi Belly, ko te kanga a Parao, ko te rānaki a Montezuma, ko te rātou hoa tinitini. I te nuinga o te wā he mātua tiotio engari ehara i te tino mōrearea.""

This directly links diseases like Delhi Belly, dysentery, and Montezuma's revenge to hot climates. The text then further explains that even respiratory illnesses are more common in hotter climates, although usually not severe.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ka āhei te mārakerake auau ki te āraitanga o te aha?","The correct answer is **C: Ngā raruraru roma (Germs)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses various illnesses (""mate hā,"" ""Delhi Belly,"" ""kanga a Parao,"" ""rānaki a Montezuma"") caused by germs and environmental factors. The question asks what the passage describes you being able to ""practice"" or be exposed to – which directly relates to encountering germs and illnesses.

* **A: Ngā raruraru whakamātautau (Tests/Trials):** While illness *can* be a trial, the passage focuses on the biological cause (germs).
* **B: Germs Paetata (Germs - literal translation):** This isn't an option. The passage uses the term ""ngā kīrehe"" which translates to germs or microbes.
* **D: Delhi Belly:** This is just one specific example of illness, not the overarching concept.

Therefore, **Ngā raruraru roma (Germs)** is the best fit because the passage centers on the experience of encountering germs and the illnesses they cause.
"
Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he painga o te haere i roto i te rohe o Rōpū?,"The correct answer is **A: Kei te karo i ngā taupānga visa maha (Avoid multiple visa applications)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""mā te mau i tētahi visa Schengen me tono motuhake koe mō ngā visas kei ia o ngā whenua mema Schengen..."" (By obtaining a Schengen visa, you must apply separately for visas in each member state...) This highlights the hassle of multiple visa applications.  The Schengen zone eliminates this need.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tiaki moni ana (Cost-saving):** While potentially cheaper than multiple visas, the text doesn't directly state that it saves money. It mentions more time and paperwork, implying it might not be *cheaper* overall.
* **C: Kei te karo i ngā wāhitaki mana uruwhenua maha (Avoid multiple immigration checks):**  The text says you *don't* have to undergo immigration checks when moving within the Schengen zone, but it doesn't connect this directly to avoiding ""multiple immigration checks"" in a general sense.
* **D: Kāore he whakaritenga uruwhenua (There are no immigration regulations):** This is completely false. The Schengen zone *has* immigration regulations, just streamlined ones for movement within the zone.



"
He aha te mea kua kore e kitea i roto i te urupa o Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **A: Ētahi whakakotahitanga (Other artifacts)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kāore ngā rawa mīharo o te toma i te noho tonu ki roto rā, engari kua haria ki te Egyptian Museum, ki Cairo. Ko ngā manuhiri he iti te wā kua pai ake me i whai wāhi atu ki wāhi kē atu."" This translates to ""The wonderful treasures of the tomb no longer remain inside, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo. Visitors spend little time and move on to other places."" This implies that while treasures *were* found, ""other artifacts"" are what are missing from the tomb itself now.

While the passage mentions sarcophagi and coffins, it doesn't say they were *not* found. It focuses on the lack of ""wonderful treasures"" remaining in the tomb. Options B and C are too specific; the passage doesn't say sarcophagi or coffins were missing, only that the ""wonderful treasures"" were removed. Option D is too broad; the passage says ""other artifacts"" are missing, not just ""artifacts"" in general.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea te ūnga o Vancouver e iti rawa te ahuareka ki ngā kaihaereere e mōhio ana ki te utu? ","The correct answer is **A: Te Motu o Granville**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""He māmā te tae atu mā ngā tēkehi wai e wehe ana i Granville Island kei te pokapū o te tāone o Vancouver."" This implies Granville Island is centrally located and easily accessible within Vancouver.

The passage also mentions that the Sea to Sky Highway to Whistler (a popular outdoor activity location) has ""he nui ngā utu"" (high costs). This suggests it's not the area people are looking for if they're budget-conscious.

The passage also mentions Bowen Island as a destination for outdoor activities.

Therefore, Granville Island, being central and easily accessible, is the most likely place to have less pressure regarding costs.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea ūnga e tino tuku ana i tētahi wheako Vancouver tūturu?","The correct answer is **A: Te Motu o Bowen**.

The passage explicitly describes Bowen Island as offering a ""perfect day trip, or weekend getaway"" with activities like hiking, kayaking, and restaurants. It highlights its location near Vancouver and mentions the ferry service from Granville Island. The passage focuses on Bowen Island as a destination for outdoor experiences.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: whio (whales):** While whale watching is mentioned as an activity, the passage doesn't focus on whales as the primary way to experience Vancouver.
*   **C: Downtown Vancouver:** The passage mentions Granville Island *in* Downtown Vancouver, but it's not presented as the core experience or the focus of a day trip/getaway.
*   **D: Te Motu o Granville (Granville Island):** The passage mentions Granville Island as the location of the ferry, but it's not presented as the destination itself. It's a *way to get to* Bowen Island.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, āhea haere ai nga kaihoko ki nga hinganga mehemea kai te rapu rātau i ngā tirohanga kāore i te mōhiotia?","The correct answer is **D: I waho o te wā marangai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mākū koe mēna koe ka whakawhiti i te piriti, ka hīkoi rānei i te huarahi kōpikopiko e tata ana ki te wairere. Engari hoki, nā te nui o te wai i pērā ai, ā, ka rehurehu noa tō titiro atu ki ngā wairere- i ngā wāhi katoa!""

This means that *when the water level is high*, you can't easily access viewpoints close to the waterfall. Therefore, you'd have to look for viewpoints *outside of the rainy season* (i waho o te wā marangai) to see things that aren't obscured by the water.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te taha ki te haere ki Wikitōria Falls i waenganui o Whiringa me Mati?","The correct answer is **C: Tirohanga whakaharahara o te taka (Spectacular views of the falls)**.

The passage states: ""I te wā ua rawa o te tau (Noema tae atu ki Māehe), ka teitei ake te rōrahi wai, ā, ka wheriko ake ngā Wairere. Engari hoki, nā te nui o te wai i pērā ai, ā, ka rehurehu noa tō titiro atu ki ngā wairere- **i ngā wāhi katoa!**"" 

This means that during the rainy season (November to March), the falls are at their most powerful and offer *spectacular views*. The other options are not supported by the passage.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i te taunakitia ina whakamahi i tētahi drone ki te pikitia?","The correct answer is **D: E whakaata ana i ngā wāhi pūruru anake e kore ai e kitea te drone**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ko te whakarere i tētahi matatopa tata ki tētahi tauranga waka rererangi, ki runga rānei i tētahi mātoru he whakaaro koretake tata ki ngā wā katoa, ahakoa kāore i te turekore ki tō takiwā.""  This translates to: ""Modifying a flight plan close to an airport, or even over a motor, is a reckless thought at all times, even if it is not illegal in your jurisdiction.""

While options A, B, and C are all things to consider and potentially require permissions, the passage highlights modifying flight plans near sensitive areas (like airports) as particularly reckless and discouraged.  Option D directly addresses the reckless behavior of flying near airports.

Therefore, the passage discourages flying drones near airports, even if it's not technically illegal.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, kei hea ngā wāhi tino pai hei whitiāhua mā te whakamahi i te drone?","The correct answer is **D: I ngā wāhi kua whiwhi koe i ngā whakaaetanga o mua mō**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding regulations and obtaining necessary permissions *before* flying a drone. It highlights the potential for issues if you fly in unauthorized areas or without proper authorization. Option D directly reflects this by suggesting flying where you *already* have the required permissions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tata ki te hunga e kore e pōreareatia e te aroaro o te drone:** This is irrelevant to legal compliance.
*   **B: I ngā wāhi kāore e whakaaetia ana te whakaahua auau:** Flying in areas where aerial photography is prohibited is against the regulations mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: I nga waahi pukumahi kaore e kitea te drone:**  While avoiding detection is generally a good idea, it doesn't address the legal requirements for drone operation.



"
"I runga anō i te haerenga, ehara i te tika te tauākī e pā ana ki te whakaritenga rēhitatanga mō te tukanga visa?","The correct answer is **A: Mēnā kei te noho koe i ngā whare tūruhi, kāore pea koe e hiahia ki te rēhita.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""I ētahi atu wā, ko te hunga ō waho i ngā nohoanga tūruhi anake me rēhita."" (In some cases, only those staying in tourist accommodations need to register.)
* **Option A reflects this:** It correctly states that if you are staying in tourist accommodations (whare tūruhi), you may not need to register.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Me rēhita ngā whenua katoa ki ngā mana ā rohe:** The text doesn't say *all* countries need to be registered. It's specific to those staying in tourist accommodations.
* **C: E hiahiatia ana pea he toro ki ngā tari nekeneke:** While you *might* need to contact an immigration office, the text doesn't make that a general requirement. Registration is the key point.
* **D: I ētahi wāhi, ka taea e ngā hotera o te rohe te whakahaere i te rēhitatanga:** The text mentions that tourist accommodations can *handle* registration, but it doesn't say that *all* local hoteliers are in charge of it.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei ehara i te wāhi tūruhi ka haere pea ki te whakahaere i to rātau rēhitatanga?,"The correct answer is **C: He tari poutāpeta paetata (A border control office)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ki ngā tini whenua me tētahi ture pērā, ka whakarite ngā hōtēra ā-rohe i te rēhitatanga (me mātua tono atu)."" This translates to ""In many countries with a similar law, border officials arrange for registration (and require parental consent).""

Border control offices are responsible for regulating the entry and exit of people *from other countries*. They don't typically handle registration for people who are already residing within a country. The other options are possibilities mentioned in the text as places where registration might occur.



"
Ko wai e kore e whai hua i te mahi tūao i a ia e haere ana?,"The correct answer is **B: Ko tētahi tangata e kimi ana i tētahi utu nui**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that volunteering isn't just about giving; it's about personal growth, cultural understanding, and gaining new skills. It also mentions that volunteering can help with financial stability by providing food, accommodation, and covering some expenses. 

Option B directly contradicts these points. Someone primarily motivated by a ""large payment"" is missing the deeper benefits of volunteering described in the text. The passage doesn't say it's *bad* to get paid, but it's not the primary focus or the core value proposition of volunteering as presented. 

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ko tētahi tangata e tūmanako ana kia noho hoa hou ki rāwāhi:** The passage explicitly states that volunteering involves meeting new people.
*   **C: Ko tētahi e tumanako ana ki te whiwhi i tētahi pūkenga hou:** The passage mentions that volunteering allows one to learn and develop new skills.
*   **D: Tētahi tangata e hiahia ana pea ki te rūma me te papa:** While accommodation is mentioned as a benefit of volunteering, it isn't a fundamental requirement or a reason why someone *wouldn't* benefit.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he pēhea te tono i a rātau e whai hua ana ki tētahi haere i runga i te tahua?","The correct answer is **D: Mā tēnei koe e āwhina kia whiwhi koe ki tētahi tirohanga.**

Here's why:

The passage states that volunteering offers opportunities to:

*   Learn about a culture.
*   Meet new people.
*   Learn about yourself.
*   Gain new skills.

These are all related to gaining new perspectives (tirohanga). Option D directly reflects this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tata tonu te utu i ngā wā katoa** (Always paying the cost): The passage mentions that volunteering can help with finances, but it doesn't say that there's always a cost. Often, it provides accommodation and food.
*   **B: I te nuinga o te wā ka ahu atu ki ngā wāhi mahi** (Mostly going to work places): The passage isn't focused on work; it's focused on cultural immersion and personal growth.
*   **C: I ētahi wā ka tukuna te rūma me te poari** (Sometimes a room and board are provided): While the passage *does* mention accommodation and food being provided, option D is a broader and more accurate summary of the benefits.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, He aha te mea e kiia ana he rerekē i te haerenga noa ki Walt Disney World?","The correct answer is **C: E tārewa ana i te katoa o te haere i runga i te āhuatanga Disney.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that a typical ""Disney World trip"" involves staying at a Disney hotel and not leaving the Disney area for a whole week. The passage contrasts this with the idea of buying used, partially used tickets from resale platforms, implying that this isn't the typical, all-encompassing Disney experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E tārewa ana i te wiki e hōpara ana i ngā pāka:** The passage states a typical trip is *one week* and doesn't specify the number of park days.
* **B: E noho ana i tētahi hōtēra i waho o te whare:** The passage explicitly states a typical trip involves staying *at a Disney hotel*.
* **D: Mauria he pahi mai i te taunga rererangi ki te hōtēra:** The passage mentions the airport transfer but says it's a standard part of the trip, not something that differentiates it.



"
Ko tēhea o ngā kōrero e whai ake nei e pā ana ki te Ao Disney ehara i te tika?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Ka taea te whakawhiti i ngā tīkiti Papa-hopper ki ētahi atu haere** (You can transfer Park Hopper tickets to other trips).

The passage explicitly states: **""Kei te aukatia e Disney: he kore-whakawhiti ngā tīkiti.""** (Disney prohibits: non-transferable tickets).  Therefore, you cannot transfer Park Hopper tickets to another trip.

The other options are supported by the text:

* **B: He nohoanga i runga i te pae e wātea ana** (Accommodation in a Disney resort). The text mentions staying at a Disney hotel for the week.
* **C: Tērā ētahi pahi e wātea ana ki te kawe haere mai i te wāhi rererangi ki te āhuatanga** (There are transfers available to take you from the airport to the resort). The text implies transfers are common, describing the typical way people get to Disney World.
* **D: Ka kitea ngā tīkiti rā-maha i ngā paetukutuku hoko** (Multi-day tickets are found on sales websites). The text mentions tickets being sold on platforms like eBay and Craigslist.



Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā take e whai ake nei kāore pea e hipa i roto i tētahi karaehe whakangungu ngaio, i ngā tānga rānei?","The correct answer is **C: takahanga rohe pakanga (conflict zones)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""I te nuinga o te wā ka aro tētahi akomanga ki te katoa o ngā take e kōrerotia ana ki konei me te taipitopito nui ake, i te nuinga o te wā ki te wheako ā-ringa. **I te nuinga o te wā i waenga i te 2-5 ngā rā te roa o tētahi wānanga, ā, he whakatau kei roto, he nui te āwhina tuatahi, ā, i ētahi wā he whakangungu rākau. He tini ngā pukapuka me ngā makahīni e kōrero ana mō te mōrehutanga ki te wao, heoi ehara i te mea he nui ngā putanga e pā ana ki ngā wāhi pakanga.**""

This translates to: ""One course usually focuses on all the issues mentioned here with a greater overview, mostly on hands-on experience. **The duration of a workshop is usually between 2-5 days, and it includes a test, a lot of first aid, and sometimes woodcraft training. Many books and magazines talk about wilderness survival, but there aren't many courses related to conflict zones.**""

The passage directly indicates a lack of courses specifically focused on conflict zones. The other options (Wilderness Survival, First Aid Training, and potentially the course duration/structure) *are* mentioned as typical components of the workshop.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea o ngā kaupapa e whai ake nei ka hipahia i roto i tētahi karaehe whakangungu ngaio?","The correct answer is **A: Āwhina tuatahi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...he nui te āwhina tuatahi..."" (there is a lot of first aid...).  While other topics are mentioned, first aid is the only one specifically listed as a standard part of the training.  The passage also notes that while there's information on wilderness survival, there isn't a lot of training focused on conflict zones.  Therefore, options B and D are less directly supported. Option C (Ora o te Wilderness) is mentioned as a subject of books and manuals, but not as a standard part of the training described in the passage.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te kōwhiringa tino pai mo te karo i te wai tāhae?","The correct answer is **B: Hoko wai pounamu**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the effectiveness of boiling water varies and that sometimes it takes only a minute, other times longer. 
* It also advises that if you are unsure, you should buy water from a reputable, bottled company. This directly supports buying bottled water as the best way to ensure safe drinking water, especially if you're unsure about the boiling process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wai kōhua mō ngā meneti maha (Boiling water for many minutes):** The passage says the time needed varies, so ""many minutes"" isn't guaranteed to be effective.
* **C: Wai kōhua mo te meneti kotahi (Boiling water for one minute):**  The passage says one minute isn't *always* sufficient.
* **D: Ka tohu i te wai mō ngā tuma tauwhāiti (Treating water for several hours):** This is not mentioned in the passage and is generally not a practical or necessary method for everyday use.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, he aha te mea e kore e taea ahakoa mo nga kaikau pūkenga?","The correct answer is **B: E mau ana i roto i te wai hōhonu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...i te takotoranga o te papa ki raro i te wai e pīhangaiti ana te pari auraki ki ngā wāhanga hohonu, ā, kei hua ake hoki tētahi pari tere ki te wai hōhonu ki reira.""  This translates to ""...as the seabed slopes downwards into the deeper areas, the slope becomes steeper, and a faster slope develops in the deep water.""

The passage then explains that the current is often strongest near the surface (ākau). It suggests that the strongest currents are more likely to pull a diver deeper into the water, and that it's easier to return to the surface than to fight the strong currents.

Therefore, the passage implies that even skilled divers can be pulled into the deep water (wai hōhonu) by the currents. Options A, C, and D aren't directly addressed or contradicted by the text.



"
Me aha koe ki te mau koe i tētahi o nāianei?,"The best answer is **A: Whakamātauria kia puta atu i te rere mā te ū ki tētahi atu aronga, kātahi ka kaukau atu ki te takutai i te tikanga.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the waves are receding.** The key is to *take advantage of the receding waves*.
* **Option A** directly addresses this. It advises to ""take advantage of the flow by holding onto another current, then go to the beach in the proper way."" This means using the current to get back to the shore *after* the waves have diminished.
* **Option B** suggests the wave will become easier. This isn't necessarily true; the passage indicates waves can become *faster* in deeper water.
* **Option C** is nonsensical and unrelated to the passage.
* **Option D** (swimming underwater) is risky and not advised in this situation, given the passage mentions a potential whirlpool.

Therefore, **Option A** is the most logical and safe course of action based on the information provided."
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, ko tēhea tauwāhi e haere ai ki tētahi maka, he whakangahau hararei whai painga?","The correct answer is **D: Tata ki tētahi arawai o te whenua**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""He pai ngā arawai o uta hei kaupapa ārahi i ō haerenga."" This translates to ""Rivers are a good basis for planning your trips.""  It then gives examples of trips *along* rivers like the Loire, Rhine, Danube, and Erie Canal.

The question asks *where* you go on a trip (i.e., the location). The passage provides a general answer: ""Tata ki tētahi arawai o te whenua"" which means ""Along a river.""

The other options are incorrect because they specify a particular river, while the passage emphasizes the *rivers themselves* as the basis for trips.



"
"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, Ko tehea o ēnei e whai ake nei e kore e tūtohutia mō ngā wāhine e haere ana ki te rohe?","The correct answer is **A: Kia kaua e kōrerorero i te tūnga taua (Don't talk about your marital status)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kia kaha ki te whakakahore i te tāne, ā, kaua e mataku ki te tū pakari ai (ahakoa ngā rerekētanga ahurea, kāore tonu i te pai!)."" This translates to ""Be strong in rejecting men, and do not be afraid to stand firm (even though cultural differences may lead to actions they consider acceptable, it is not always right!)."" This strongly implies that discussing marital status can be a vulnerable position, making women targets for unwanted attention.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **B: Kia mōhio he rerekē te ahurea ka whakaoho ai i te kaha o te iwi (Be aware that cultural differences can empower the community):** The passage acknowledges cultural differences but cautions against accepting actions deemed unacceptable, showing an understanding of how culture can both empower and potentially endanger.
* **C: Kaua e mau i te Hurai kōhiko (Don't hold onto anger):** While not directly stated, the overall tone encourages women to be assertive and stand firm, implying they shouldn't allow anger to consume them.
* **D: Whakamahia te uaua ina hiahiatia (Use force when necessary):** The passage advocates for standing firm and not being afraid, suggesting that force (in the sense of firmness and resistance) might be necessary in certain situations.

Therefore, the only option *not* supported by the passage is avoiding talking about marital status. It's presented as a way to avoid potential danger and unwanted attention.



"
"I runga anō i te rohe i whakaahuatia i roto i te wāhanga, he aha te tohutohu āwhina mō ngā wāhine haere?","The correct answer is **C: Kia mōhio koe ki ngā rerekētanga ahurea e hua ana kia kore koe e tū i tō whenua.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...Me mōhio te wahine he rerekētanga ahurea ka ahu atu pea ki ngā mahi e whai whakaarotia ana e rātou he whakatīwheta, ā, ka whāia, ka mauria pea te ringa, aha atu.""  This translates to ""...The woman must be aware of cultural differences that may lead to actions they consider acceptable, and may be assaulted, and have their hand, etc. taken.""

* Option C directly addresses this by advising the woman to be aware of cultural differences.  Understanding these differences is crucial for navigating potentially dangerous situations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E mōhio ana koe he kore noa iho te whai i a ia** (You should know it's not just about following him): While important, this isn't the primary advice given in the passage. The passage focuses more on awareness of cultural differences and potential assault.
* **B: Wear he rīngi nui hei tohu i te Tūnga taua** (Wear a large ring to signal your marital status):  The passage doesn't mention wearing a ring.
* **D: I te take o ngā nekehanga tē hiahiatia, kia kaha ki te huri i ngā tāngata** (Due to necessary movements, be strong enough to turn away from people): This is a vague and potentially unsafe suggestion. The passage doesn't advocate turning away from people; it advocates for awareness and strength in the face of potential assault.



"
"I runga anō i te wāhanga, tērā pea ka hiahiatia e tētahi kaiwhakaahua kararehe hei whakamahi i tētahi arotahi motuhake?","The best answer is **D: Mēnā he ture motuhake tā te pāka e pā ana ki te whakaahua waiora.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions the difficulty of photographing wildlife due to regulations.** Option D directly addresses this point.  It's a direct consequence of the challenges described in the text.
* **Option A (Waihanga iti rawa):** While photographing small animals *can* be challenging, the passage focuses more on broader difficulties like finding animals and dealing with regulations, not specifically on size.
* **Option B (take arumoni):**  The passage mentions using images for commercial purposes, but it's only one of the challenges.  The regulation aspect is more prominent.
* **Option C (whakamā):**  While photographing vulnerable animals is a consideration, the passage highlights the broader issue of regulations and difficulty in *finding* animals, not just the vulnerability of some species.



Therefore, the passage's emphasis on legal restrictions on wildlife photography makes option D the most logically sound answer."
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kōrerotia i roto i te whakawhitinga hei uaua tērā pea mō ngā kaiwhakaahua kararehe?,"The correct answer is **C: E hiahiatia ana te momo arotahi (The type of lens is needed)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses difficulties in photographing birds, including:

*   **Getting close enough:** Requiring long lenses.
*   **Finding birds:** It's challenging to locate them.
*   **Legal restrictions:** Restrictions on photographing birds for commercial purposes.
*   **Bird behavior:** Birds can be shy, elusive, or active in harsh environments.

The passage *doesn't* mention the *type of lens* being a challenge. While lens choice is important for photography in general, it isn't explicitly raised as a difficulty *specifically* when photographing birds in *this* passage. The other options are touched on:

*   **A: Kimi ana i ētahi kararehe pātata (Finding elusive birds):** Directly mentioned.
*   **B: E mahi ana ki ngā kararehe whakatuki (Working with perched birds):** Implied by the mention of shy or elusive birds.
*   **D: E mahi ana i ngā taiao tūkino pea (Working in potentially harsh environments):** Directly mentioned.

Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka iti ake pea ngā raruraru mō tētahi atekōkiri e haere ana i te maunga?,"The correct answer is **B: Te wā iti (Short duration)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes that **cold weather conditions** (snow, ice, extreme cold) and **strong winds** pose the most significant dangers to mountain travel.  

The passage *explicitly states* that ""he iti te pane uruwhenua, ā, e kore e taea e koe te taraiwa anō nei kei te raima kau koe"" (there is little ground cover, and you can no longer move on your own if you slip). This indicates that slippery conditions are a major risk.

The passage also says ""he noa ngā āhuatanga tio, hukapapa hoki ki ngā tini whenua, ā, ka haere tonu te ikiiki kāore he tino raru puta noa i te tau"" (snowy conditions, slippery surfaces, and the slippage continues without a major problem throughout the year). This indicates that *less intense* cold conditions, with good ground cover, present fewer risks.

Therefore, a **short duration** of travel minimizes exposure to the most dangerous conditions (strong winds, slippery surfaces, extreme cold) and therefore reduces potential problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā waka taumaha (Helicopters):** Helicopters are a rescue option, not a way to *minimize* problems *during* the journey.
* **C: Ōritetanga e hiahiatia ana (Required skills):** While skills are important, they don't eliminate the risks posed by extreme weather and terrain. Poor weather can overwhelm even skilled mountaineers.
* **D: kua whakahekea te Aritanga (Skills have decreased):** The passage doesn't mention anything about a decline in skills.  The focus is on the inherent dangers of the environment.

He aha pea ka noho ōrite tonu mō te tāke moni whiwhi puta noa i ngā whenua maha?,"The correct answer is **C: Te wāhi e kōnae ai koe (The place where you plan/intend to be).**

Here's why:

The paragraph states that tax laws and rates vary significantly *from country to country*. The question asks what would be consistent *across multiple countries*. The only factor mentioned that would be consistent is where someone *plans* to be, as that's the basis for determining which country's tax laws apply.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngā Mokatere (The Mountains):** This has no relevance to tax revenue.
* **B: Hanganga (Manufacturing):** While manufacturing might be taxed differently, it's not a universal constant.
* **D: Ngā Taiapa (The Oceans):** This has no relevance to tax revenue.

"E ai ki te wāhanga nei, mēnā kei te mahi koe ki rāwāhi, engari i tētahi atu wāhi, ka whakakōnaetia e koe ō tāke moni whiwhinga?","The correct answer is **C: I te whenua e mahi ana koe i tēnei wā.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mēnā ehara koe i tētahi takawaenga kāwanatanga, ki te mahi koe ki tāwāhi i te nuinga o te wā me whakarite koe i te tāke moni whiwhi ki te motu e noho nā koe."" This means that if you're not a government employee and work abroad, you need to manage the money you earn in the country where you are working.

Option C directly reflects this idea: **""I te whenua e mahi ana koe i tēnei wā""** (In the country where you are working at this time).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kei hea koe i te nuinga o te wā** (Where are you most of the time): This is too general. The passage focuses on the location of work, not general residency.
*   **B: I Te Hononga o Amerika** (In the United States): This is too specific. The passage says the principles are different in different countries, not just the US.
*   **D: Kei hea ngā utu te mea iti rawa** (Where are payments the least): This isn't mentioned in the passage. The passage discusses managing earnings, not the lowest payment locations.

Ko tēhea o ngā tauākī e whai ake nei kāore e whakaahua tika ana i te Tika o te Ao?,"The correct answer is **D: Kāore e hiahiatia ana ngā whenua kia whai wāhi**.

Here's why:

* **The definition of the World Exposition (Expo) explicitly states that countries participate in these events.** The purpose is for countries to showcase their culture, history, and global themes. Therefore, it's essential that countries *do* participate.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate based on the text:

* **A: Ka whakaaturia pea e ngā whakaaturanga te hītori, te ahurea rānei o tētahi whenua:** The text states that countries showcase their ""take o te ao, i te ahurea, hītori rānei o tō rātou whenua.""
* **B: Ka whakaaturia ngā whakaaturanga Botanical i te taha o ngā whakaaturanga tohunga, akoranga hoki:** The text mentions ""wh whakaaturanga putiputi, ngā mahi ahumāra me ngā kaupapa katoa e pā ana ki ngā huarākau,"" indicating botanical displays are a part of the exhibits, alongside specialized and educational displays.
* **C: Ka taea e ngā takahanga te tae atu ki te ono marama:** The text states that the expos ""ka haere ēnei hui mō te toru ki te ono marama rānei.""



"
"Ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei he ture no te hanganga Tika, ao whānui rānei o te Ao?","The correct answer is **A: Me whakakite e ngā whakaaturanga ngā hītori me ngā take o te ao.**

Here's why:

* **The question describes the purpose of World Expos:** showcasing the culture, history, and issues of participating nations.
* **Option A directly reflects this purpose.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kāore e taea e te whenua kotahi te taurima i ngā takahanga i ia tau:** While Expos are huge undertakings, a single nation *can* host an Expo.
* **C: Me tae ki te ono marama te roa o ngā takahanga:** The question states that Expos *can* last for three to six months, but doesn't mandate a specific length.
* **D: Kia puritia ai te ataahua, me whai wāhi ngā whenua katoa:**  While beauty is part of the Expo, the core function isn't just aesthetics and isn't mandatory for *all* countries to participate.  The question doesn't mention participation being mandatory.

Mā te mahi ko tēhea o ēnei e whai ake nei ka whakahekea te āheinga ki te whakaeke kararehe?,"The correct answer is **C: Kei te pupuri i tētahi tawhiti 25 whārangi mai i ngā wuruhi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""e ai ki ngā mana o te pāka, me noho tonu te 100 iari/mita atu i ngā pea me ngā wuruhi me te 25 iari/mita atu i ērā atu kararehe mohoao katoa!"" (according to the park's rules, you must stay 100 meters away from the pea and wuruhi and 25 meters away from all other native birds!). This directly addresses the concern of disturbing birds.

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

* **A: E mau ana i ngā otaota aro (Holding a still gaze):** While avoiding sudden movements is good bird behavior, the passage doesn't specifically mention *holding a still gaze* as a method to decrease disturbance.
* **B: Tango ana i te peke i te puni (Removing something from the ground):** The passage mentions not leaving food or litter, but it doesn't explicitly state *removing something from the ground* as the action to decrease disturbance.
* **D: E whakakāhore ana i ngā kararehe whai maka kai (Scaring away predatory birds):** The passage focuses on protecting native birds from disturbance, not on managing predatory birds.

Therefore, keeping a distance of 25 meters from the wuruhi (and 100 meters from the pea) is the most direct action mentioned in the passage to decrease disturbance to birds.



"
Ko tēhea o ēnei kāore i kōrerotia i roto i te whakawhitinga hei take pea o ngā whakaekenga o te waiora?,"The correct answer is **C: Whāngai ana i te waiora (Feeding the wildlife)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that feeding the wildlife is *not* allowed and is considered wrong.  The regulations specifically prohibit it to prevent the animals from becoming dependent and losing their natural foraging behaviors.

Let's look at why the other options are mentioned:

*   **A: Ngā kakara kaha (Aggressive animals):** The text mentions that even seemingly gentle animals can become aggressive due to habituation from being fed.
*   **B: Rahunga ki te pupuri tawhiti (Maintaining distance):**  The text clearly states distance requirements from certain species.
*   **D: Ngā kararehe tauhou ki te tangata (Young animals approaching humans):** The text mentions the potential for young animals to approach humans due to a lack of fear, highlighting the negative consequences of habituation.
