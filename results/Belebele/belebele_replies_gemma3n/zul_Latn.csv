"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iliphi icedo elingafanele lokudlala i-accordion ngendlela ephumelelayo?","The correct answer is **B: Gwema ukunyakaza ngokungadingekile ukuze ungaphelelwa amandla.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Qinisekisa ukuthi isandla sakho sixhekethile ngangokunokwenzeka njengoba usacindezela amanothi afanele – futhi zama ukunganyakazisi iminwe yakho ngokungadingekile. Ngalendlela, uzozikhathalisa kancane ngangokunokwenzeka.""  This means avoiding unnecessary movement helps you play more efficiently and avoid fatigue.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuze unyuse ivolumu, cindezela kakhulu indlela odlala ngayo:** The passage says *don't* press too hard – avoid unnecessary force.
* **C: Njengoba ugcina isandla sakho siphumule qapha indlela oshaya ngayo amanothi:** While keeping your hand relaxed is good, the primary focus of the passage is avoiding *unnecessary* movement, not just relaxation.
* **D: Nyusa ijubane njengoba udlala ama-bellows ukuze ufinyelele ivolumu eyengeziwe:** The passage says to use strength and a high pressure, *not* just increased speed.



"
"Njengoba udlala i-accordion, ikuphi okungasiza ukuze unyuse ivolumu?","The correct answer is **A: Ijubane elengeziwe (Increased speed)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ukuze uthole umsindo owengeziwe, ensimbini yomculo ingositini, usebenzisa lokhu okungezansi okunamandla **neljejubane eliphezulu**."" (To get a richer sound, in the melody, use this lighter pressure and **higher speed**.)

Therefore, increasing the speed is the key to increasing the volume/richness of the sound on the accordion.
"
Kungani izithombe ezivela ku-thelevishini zincishiswa emaceleni?,"The correct answer is **B: Manje izithombe zicwgala isikrini sonke.**

The passage explains that overscan is a feature of most TVs that crops the edges of the image to ensure it fits the screen. This is why images on TVs appear cropped. Option B directly reflects this explanation.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izikinga ezilandelayo omunye okungenzeka ehlangabezane nazo uma eshintsha imuvi ayise kusimo se-DVD?","The correct answer is **A: Isithombe esingagcwali isikrini sonke**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that overscan is a problem when converting films to DVD because it crops the edges of the image to fit the standard TV screen. This means the image won't fill the entire screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Okwesikhashana susa imibhalo echazayo:** The passage doesn't mention anything about text being temporarily removed.
* **C: Isithombe esigcwala isikrini sonke:** This is the *opposite* of the problem described. Overscan *prevents* the image from filling the screen.
* **D: Susa okusemaceleni:** While overscan *does* remove the edges, the core problem is that the image *doesn't fill the screen* at all.
"
Belikuphi ibutho lase-British?,"The correct answer is **C: i-Bordentown**.

The passage states: ""UJenene John Cadwalder wayezokwenza ukuhlasela kokulibazisa ngokumelene nebutho lamaBhrithani eBordentown..."" This directly indicates that the British force was located in Bordentown.
"
i-Signature kabani evelayo encwadini?,"The correct answer is **D: UCharles Thomson**.

The text states: ""Ngemva kokwamukelwa uKhongolose ngoJulayi 4, isiphakamiso esibhalwe ngesandla sasayinwa uMongameli kaKhongolose uJohn Hancock **futhi noNobhala uCharles Thompson** wathunyelwa esitolo esiseduzane sokuphrinta sikaJohn Dunlap.""  Charles Thompson is mentioned as signing the document. While John Dunlap printed the copies, he didn't sign the original document. George Washington received a copy, but didn't sign the original. John Nixon read the document aloud.



"
"Kulezi zindawo ezilandelayo, iDunlap broadsides ifikele kuphi kugcina?","The correct answer is **C: eLondon**.

The text states: ""Ikhophi yafika eLondon ngo-Agasti 10..."" (A copy arrived in London on August 10th...).
"
Amabutho kaColonel Stark bekakuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ekupheleni kwenyakatho, ocingweni (At the northern end, at the blockhouse)**.

The text states: ""Amantu bakaStark baya endaweni esocingweni olusenyakatho kwendawo yabenzi bamaKoloni."" (Stark's troops went to the blockhouse at the northern end of the colonists' settlement.)

While they also placed a trench *in front* of the blockhouse, the primary location described for the bulk of Stark's troops is *at* the blockhouse itself.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ayingezelele nini ucingo amadoda kaStark?","The correct answer is **B: Ngemva kokuthi abaziwayo badlule istake.**

The passage states: ""Uma ukuncipha kwamanzi kuvula isikhala ngaseMfuleni iMistiki ngasempumalanga nyakatho yenhlonhlo, banweba ngokushesha uthango ngodonga olumfishane lwamatshe ngasenyakatho oluphelela ngasekuqaleni kwamanzi ogwini oluncane. **Gridley noma uStark wabeka isigxobo esingamafidi angu-100 (30 m) phambi kocingo futhi wayala ukuthi kungabi nodubulayo kuze kube yilapho abantu abavamile besidlula.**"" This indicates the palisade was erected *after* the enemy had passed through the initial bottleneck.



The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: Njengoba amakoloni abiza usizo:** The passage doesn't mention colonists calling for help.
*   **C: Ngesikhathi sokukhathala okuncani:** The passage doesn't mention any specific period of intense fighting.
*   **D: Ngesikhathi amabutho acabanga ukuya phambili ezindaweni zawo:** The passage describes a defensive action, not an advance.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isikhathi lapho iChina beyinobudlova kakhulu?","The correct answer is **D: Izikhathi Zombuso Ezinthathu (The Three Kingdoms Period)**.

The text explicitly states: ""IMibuso Emithathu kwakungenye yenkathi yegazi eliningi kunazo zonke emlandweni waseShayina yakuDala, izinkulungwane zabantu zafa zilwela ukuhlala esihlalweni esiphakeme kakhulu esigodlweni esihle e-Xi’an."" This directly translates to ""The Three Kingdoms Period was one of the bloodiest periods in Chinese history, with hundreds of thousands of people dying fighting to live in the most beautiful place in Xi'an.""  The other options are either too specific (Xi'an is a location) or not as strongly emphasized as the Three Kingdoms period as the most violent."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iliphi iqiniso lamabutho izintuthwane ezingena esikhathini senomadic?","The correct answer is **A: Phakathi nobusuku bayaphumula**.

The passage states: ""Esigabeni sokufuduka, amabutho ezintuthwane amasha ebusuku bese amise inkampu phakathi nosuku."" (In the foraging stage, the new bacteria colonies are out at night and set up camp during the day.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umtapho wokudla kwabo kuncani** - The passage actually says the food supply is *decreasing* in the foraging stage.
* **C: Benza izidleke lezo ezishintshwa ngemva kwenzuku ezingu-17** -  The temporary shelters are changed *daily*, not after 17 days.
* **D: Bamasha emini** - The passage says they are out at night.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, imuphi umusho uqondile ohambisana nalokho okwenzeka esidlekeni amabutho wezinthuthwane phakathi nesikhathi nenomadic?","The correct answer is **C: Bashintsha izidleke nsuku zonke.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Phakathi nalesi sigaba, ikoloni lenza izidleke zesikhashana ezishintshwa zinsuku zonke."" (During this stage, the colony makes temporary camps that are changed every day.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakha izidlele phakathi nobusuku:** While the passage mentions they make camps at night, it doesn't say they *only* build them at night.
* **B: Bamasha izinsuku ezingu-17 ngaphandle kokuphumula:**  The passage mentions a period of 17 days, but it doesn't say they do it *without rest*.
* **D: Ngokwesikhathi esithile basebenzisa isidleke esifanayo:** The passage explicitly states they *change* camps every day, contradicting this option.



Therefore, option C is the only statement directly supported by the text describing the nomadic lifestyle of the ant colony."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuzoqubeka nakuba kukhona okungezelele kwezimpawu?,"The correct answer is **B: Izikhathi ezithile kwezigqi**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that biological and behavioral rhythms are largely based on the presence of internal cycles and the action of clocks that operate on a natural schedule.  
* It mentions that these internal clocks generate cyclical rhythms, *even when not responding to external cues*.
* Therefore, the natural cycles of biological clocks are what will continue to occur, *regardless of any added signs*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Umkhiqizo okujikeleza ngaphakathi:** While internal processes are involved, the passage highlights the *timing* and *rhythm* as the primary drivers.  The production of internal products is a *result* of the clocks, not the fundamental continuation of the rhythms.
* **C: Izikhathi zezinto eziphilayo:**  The passage discusses clocks in a variety of organisms (bacteria, fungi, plants, animals) but doesn't focus on ""times of life"" as a core concept.
* **D: Izigqi ezibhekiwe:** While clocks can be observed, the passage emphasizes the *internal operation* and *cyclical nature* of these clocks, not simply their observation.



"
Yimuphi umusho ochaza okuveza okuhlukahlukene kwesici se-phenotypic?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** means having multiple forms or variations.  This directly aligns with the description of individuals expressing different phenotypes for a particular trait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:**  This refers to a situation where all individuals are the same for a trait.
* **Izinto eziphilayo (Living things):** This is too broad; it doesn't describe how traits are expressed.
* **Izinhlobo zezinto eziphilayo (Types of living things):**  This is also too broad and not directly related to the variation in phenotypes.



Therefore, the best answer is **D: Polymorphic**."
Yikuphi okulandelayo okunembile okuchaza izinto eziphilayo endaweni ethile?,"The correct answer is **C: Izinhlobo zezinto eziphilayo**.

Here's why:

* **Ubuningi (Biodiversity)** is defined as the variety of life in a given area. This directly refers to the different *types* of living organisms present.
* **Monomorphic** describes a *single* phenotype for a trait.
* **Inani labantu (Population size)** is a measure of how many individuals of a species there are, not the variety of species.
* **Polymorphic** describes *multiple* phenotypes for a trait.

Therefore, the best definition of biodiversity is the variety of the types of living organisms."
Yikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kube isibonelo sendawo ezokuvakasha esingokwemvelo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuvakashela i-mnyuziyami yesayensi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines natural tourist destinations as places focused on nature, plants, and animals.** Museums, while they *can* contain exhibits about nature, are primarily focused on preserving and displaying artifacts and information – they aren't inherently *natural* environments to be explored.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples:

* **A: Ukugibela intaba ukuze sithole impophoma:** This involves experiencing a natural landscape and observing wildlife.
* **B: Ukuthwebula izimbali zasendle:** This is directly related to observing and appreciating plants in their natural habitat.
* **D: Ukudoba izinhlanzi:**  This involves observing animals in their natural environment.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyisisekelo kwezokuthutha?","The correct answer is **A: Izindawo zokusebenza**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a transportation system where people travel from smaller villages to their workplaces and then pass by others' workplaces.  The key element is the *workplace* as the central point of connection and movement within this system. While cars are the vehicles used, and the impact is on the biosphere, the system revolves around the *need to go to workplaces*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izimoto ezizimele (Autonomous vehicles):** The passage mentions cars, but doesn't focus on whether they're autonomous or not. The key is the system itself, not the type of vehicle.
* **C: I-biosphere ezinzile (The pristine biosphere):** The passage states the transportation system *impacts* the biosphere, but it's not the fundamental basis of the system.
* **D: Ukuziphendukela kwemvelo kwabantu (Human adaptation to the environment):**  While the passage links the transportation system to human adaptation, it's not the *core principle* of how the transportation system works.



"
Izinxeyana ezizungeza i-nucleus zinakuphi ukugcwaliswa?,"The correct answer is **C: Negative charge**.

Here's why:

* **Electrons** are negatively charged particles. The passage states they have a ""negative charge.""
* The question asks about the charge of the particles orbiting the nucleus.
* The passage explicitly describes electrons as having negative charge.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Positive charge:** Protons are positively charged, not electrons.
* **B: No charge:**  Electrons definitely *do* have charge.
* **D: Positive and negative charge:** While the nucleus has both positive and negative charges (protons and electrons), the orbiting particles are specifically electrons, which are negatively charged.
"
I-Necleus yenziwe ngezinxenye ziphi?,"The correct answer is **A: ama-Protons nama-neutrons**.

The text explicitly states: ""I-nucleus yenziwe ngezinhlayiyana ezimbili - ama-neutron kanye nama-proton."" (The nucleus is made of two types of particles - neutrons and protons.)
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyisibonelo se-five bit binary number?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Binary numbers** use only 0s and 1s.
* A **five-bit binary number** means it needs exactly five digits (bits).

Let's look at the options:

* **A: 1010** - This is a four-bit binary number.
* **B: 12001** - This is not a binary number (it contains the digit '2').
* **C: 10010** - This is a five-bit binary number.
* **D: 110101** - This is a six-bit binary number.

Therefore, only option C fits the description of a five-bit binary number.
"
Ingabe amadijithi aneziqu ezimbili kubuye kubhekiselwe kuwo ngokuthini?,"The correct answer is **A: ama-bit**.

The text explicitly states: ""...kubhekiselwa kulezinombolo ngokuthi amadijithi aneziqu ezimbili noma – noma ama-bit, uma kusetshenziswa ulimi lwasejele.""
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekho emushweni okuyisisekelo okuzuzisa abafundi ekutholeni ulwazi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuncipha ehlukunyezweni otanga**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on how blogging helps students *gain* knowledge and develop skills. It highlights:

* **Improved writing skills:** To avoid criticism.
* **Deeper understanding of the surrounding world:** To maintain audience interest.
* **Collaboration and engagement:** Going beyond traditional school learning.
* **Critical thinking and analysis:**  Interpreting texts and forming opinions.

Option B, ""Ukuncipha ehlukunyezweni otanga"" (Reducing biases), is not directly mentioned as a key benefit of blogging or a method for gaining knowledge in the passage. While critical thinking *can* involve addressing biases, the passage's primary focus isn't on bias reduction itself.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: Ukuthuthuka emthethweni yelimi nekhona lokubhala (Improved language skills and writing):** Directly mentioned as a driver for blogging.
* **C: Ukuqaphela okukhulu kulokho okukuzungezile (Increased attention to the surrounding world):**  Mentioned as a necessity to engage the audience.
* **D: Isithakazelo esikhulisiwe sokuqubeka ufunda (Increased interest in learning):** A direct result of the engaging and collaborative nature of blogging.



Therefore, the statement that is *least* supported by the passage's core message is reducing biases.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo abafundi bangathola khona ulwazi lokubakhuthaza ukuba bathuthukise ikhono labo lokubhala?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukugcina isithakazelo ezilalelini zakho.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Isidingo sokondla isithakazelo sabantu abafundayo kushukumisa abafundi ukuba bahlakaniphe futhi bathakazelise (Toto, 2004)."" This directly links maintaining audience interest to the motivation for improving writing skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ukuqhubeka uphendula izinto eziku-inthanethi:** While blogging *is* online, the passage doesn't frame simply responding to online content as the *primary* motivator for better writing.
* **B: Isidingo esinamandla sokubalekela ukuxekwa:** The passage mentions avoiding criticism, but it presents this as a factor driving improvement, not the main *source* of information on how to improve.
* **D: Isidingo sokusebenzisana:**  The passage states blogging *encourages* collaboration, but it doesn't explicitly say collaboration is the *source* of information on how to improve writing skills.



Therefore, the passage directly connects the drive to keep the audience engaged to the motivation for improving writing.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazuzisi ku-asynchronous communication kwabafundi? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ukufinyelela abafundisi ubuso nobuso noma kunini osukwini (Accessing instructors face-to-face anytime)**.

Here's why:

* **Asynchronous communication** means communication that doesn't happen in real-time.  It's not immediate. 

Let's break down the options:

* **A: Ukusetshenziswa we-inthanethi njengomthombo (Using the internet as a resource):** Asynchronous communication *does* leverage the internet for accessing information.  This is a common aspect.
* **B: Ukufinyelela abafundisi ubuso nobuso noma kunini osukwini (Accessing instructors face-to-face anytime):**  This is *not* a characteristic of asynchronous communication. Asynchronous communication doesn't involve real-time, face-to-face interaction.  You can't just pop in and see an instructor anytime.
* **C: Amahora okusebenza akhululekile (Flexible work hours):**  Asynchronous communication allows for flexible work hours for both students and instructors because interactions aren't tied to a specific time.
* **D: Ukulawula ijubane (Controlling the pace):**  Asynchronous communication allows students to control their learning pace since they can access materials and submit assignments when it works best for them.



Therefore, the only option that doesn't fit the description of asynchronous communication is the ability to access instructors face-to-face anytime.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo kwe-asynchronous communication okungakhululekile kwabafundi?","The correct answer is **B: Amahora okusebenza**.

Here's why:

The passage states that asynchronous communication allows students to work at their own pace and control the pace of learning information. It also mentions a ""time constraint of a few hours of work that conforms to the circumstances."" This ""few hours of work"" refers to the flexibility of *when* students engage with the material, which is related to their work hours or schedule.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ijubane lokufunda (Pace of learning):** Asynchronous communication *encourages* students to work at their own pace.
* **C: Umthetho wezinto zokusebenza (Rules of work):**  The passage doesn't mention rules of work in relation to asynchronous communication.
* **D: Ukusetshenziswa kwe-inthanethi (Use of the internet):** While the internet facilitates asynchronous communication, the passage isn't highlighting the internet usage as a drawback. It's focusing on the flexibility of the time element.



"
Yini engavezwanga kulesi sigaba omunye angaze akuhlobanise nezinqaba zakudala?,"The correct answer is **D: Amasosha asendulo agibela amahhashi**

Here's why:

The passage discusses how ancient ruins evoke strong feelings and memories of past events like sword fights, heroic codes, and battles. It questions the basis of these memories and the purpose of building ruins in the first place.

The question asks what *wasn't* mentioned in the passage as being associated with ancient ruins.  The passage mentions:

*   **Sword fights on horseback:** Directly linked to the imagery evoked by the ruins.
*   **Heroic codes:** Also mentioned as part of the historical context associated with the ruins.
*   **Pit graves:** The passage explicitly describes the ability to ""easily remember the sounds of ancient battles,"" including ""the clanging of swords in the desolate places and the fear of the soldiers emerging from the pits.""

However, the passage does **not** mention ancient soldiers riding horses. This is the only option that is *not* mentioned in the context of the ruins and their evocative power.



"
Ikuphi okungashiwongo lapha kulesi sigaba okuvela njengomnuko noma umsindo ongaqamuka noma ikuphi kulamarubhi wenqaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Izinselo (Sounds)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions the ability of ancient ruins to evoke the sounds of battles: ""ukucishe uzwe ukukhenceza kwezinselo ezindaweni ezigandayiwe kanye nokuhogela ukwesaba okuphuma ematilongweni angumgodi.""  The question asks which of the options is the sound that the ruins evoke.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ukulwa (Fighting)**: While the ruins represent battles, the question asks about the *sound* they evoke, not the action itself.
*   **B: Uvalo (Fear)**: Fear is an emotion, and while battles create fear, the question asks about the specific sound.
*   **C: Idili (Drums)**: Drums were a form of music and sound, but the passage specifically mentions the sounds of *weapons* and *screams* – more specific than just drums.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokunembile i-Kirby Muxloe Castle?,"The correct answer is **B: Kudingenkile ukuqiniswa okuncani ngenxa yokuthula kwezwe okungokwemvelo ngesikhathi kwakhiwa.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ngawo-1480, lapho ukwakhiwa kwayo kuqalwa iNkosi uHastings, izwe belinokuthula kakhudlwana futhi ukuzivikela bekudingeka emaviyweni amancane kuphela wabaphangi.""  This directly indicates that the castle didn't need strong defenses because the country was peaceful.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ubukhulu bezindonga zenqaba bezicelwe Nkosi uHastings:** The passage doesn't mention the size of the towers or that they were specifically requested by the Lord Hastings.
* **C: Ukwakhiwa kwenqaba bekungakajwayeleki ngokwaleso sikhathi:** The passage suggests the castle's construction was *not* unusual due to the peaceful times.
* **D: Yakhiwa ngendlela yokuthi ikwazi ukubekezela ukuhlaselwa:** The passage explicitly states the castle *wasn't* built to withstand attacks because there was no need for strong defenses.



"
Yikuphi ukwakhiwa okujwayelekile kwezici okulandelayo ebekungagcatshwangelwa kwenqaba yeKirby Muxloe Castle okuchazwe lapha kulesi sigaba kwangaleso sikhathi?,"The correct answer is **A: Amafasitela amakhulu**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the large glass windows of Kirby Muxloe Castle would be unable to withstand a real attack for long. This implies that the windows were a weakness in the castle's design.
* The passage contrasts the castle's construction in 1480 with a time when defense was less of a concern, meaning the original design likely prioritized aesthetics over fortification.
* Options B, C, and D (the foundation, structural strength, and curtain walls) are all typical elements of a fortified castle and would have been prioritized for defense, even in 1480. Therefore, they wouldn't be the *unusual* feature to overlook.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okuvezwe lapha okuzozuzisa umgijimi ukuze alungiselele isizini ezayo?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuphrakthiza ukugijima i-cross country ngehlobo**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Okunye ukugijima ezindaweni ezingavamile phakathi nobusika, kuhlanganiswe nokuzivivinya kokuqinisa imisipha namathambo engxenye engaphezulu yomzimba, ukuzilungiselela okuhle kwenkathi yokugijima.""  This translates to: ""Another thing is to run in unusual places during winter, combined with testing the strength of the muscles and bones in the upper part of the body, preparing well for the running season.""

Option A, ""Ukuphrakthiza ukugijima i-cross country ngehlobo"" (Practicing cross-country running in the winter), directly aligns with this statement.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okubaluleke kakhulu ngomgijimi oyi-first-class half-mile runner?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlakulela ukubekezela kune jubane (Focus on endurance over speed)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ngoshintsho kusuka engxenyeni yesine kuye engxenyeni yokusubatha kwemayela, isivinini siba esingabalulekile kakhulu ukukhuthazela kuba isidingo ngokuphelele. Yiqiniso umsubathi wengxenye yemayela osezingeni eliphezulu, indoda engasubatha ngemizuzu emibili, kumelwe ibe nejubane elihle, **kodwa ukukhuthazela kumelwe kuhlakulelwe nakanjani**."" (Translation: ""The transition from the fourth mile to the mile run, speed becomes very important for motivation because the overall demand is complete. It is true that a high-level half-mile runner, a man who can run in two minutes, should have good speed, **but endurance should be developed carefully.**"")

The text emphasizes that while speed is needed, **endurance is the primary focus** for a top half-mile runner.  Options A, C, and D are either not directly supported by the text or are secondary considerations compared to endurance.
"
"Ngokuya komsubathi, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kwenzeka ngokuthi adle ukudla okunempilo kuphela?","The correct answer is **C: Ukusebenza okusezingeni eliphezulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while healthy eating won't make a skilled athlete *better*, it *can* improve the well-being of very new athletes.  It also mentions that understanding supplements can help athletes improve their performance.

* **A: Ukusebenza okuthuthukile (Improved performance)** -  Healthy eating *can* lead to improved performance.
* **B: Ukwanda kwenjabulo (Increased happiness)** -  The passage directly links well-being to healthy eating, suggesting increased happiness.
* **C: Ukusebenza okusezingeni eliphezulu (Performing at a higher level)** - The passage explicitly says healthy eating *won't* make athletes perform better.
* **D: Ukuphila kahle okujwayelekile (A generally healthy life)** - This is a likely outcome of healthy eating, aligning with the passage.

Therefore, the only option that contradicts the information given is that eating healthy will result in performing at a higher level.



"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, ikuphi okulandelayo okungavunyelwe ekutheni abadlali abasebasha bathole injabulo kuzemidlalo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukungashintshi ekudlaleni ezingeni eliphezulu**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while good nutrition won't guarantee success, it *can* improve the well-being of very new athletes. It also mentions that managing energy levels, hydration, and understanding supplements can help them improve their performance and enjoyment.
* Option B, ""Ukungashintshi ekudlaleni ezingeni eliphezulu"" (Not changing playing at a higher level), directly contradicts the passage's implication that improvement and advancement are possible with proper care and understanding. The passage suggests that *changing* and *improving* is the goal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuphrakthiza ukudla kahle** (Practicing good nutrition) - The passage explicitly says good nutrition *can* help, so this is supported.
* **C: Ukususa ukoma ngokuphumelelayo** (Successfully eliminating fatigue) - Managing energy levels (mentioned in the passage) is relevant to overcoming fatigue.
* **D: Ukugcina amandla wempilo ezingeni elifanene** (Maintaining health energy at the same level) - The passage highlights the importance of managing energy levels, suggesting a desire to *improve* rather than maintain stagnation.

Therefore, the only option that clashes with the passage's overall message of progress and improvement is B."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani umgijimi webanga elide angathenga ucezu lwemishini olubizayo?","The correct answer is **A: Into ethandwa umuntu siqu (Personal preference)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Abasubathi bangazizwa sengathi bathanda umkhiqizo ngisho noma ungenazo izinzuzo zangempela."" This means that bubble bathers are often motivated by liking something, even if it's not practical or cost-effective. The question asks why someone might buy an expensive machine despite it being unnecessary. The passage implies this is due to personal preference and a belief that they *want* it, regardless of its true value.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kufakazelwa ukuthi inezinzuzo (It is stated that it has benefits):** The passage explicitly says many products don't have real benefits.
* **C: Izothinta kakhulu indlela abesebenza ngayo (It will significantly affect the way they work):** The passage focuses on the desire for the product, not its practical impact.
* **D: Kunemibono eyiphutha ngemishini engabizi kakhulu (There are misconceptions about inexpensive machines):** While true, this doesn't directly explain why someone would buy an *expensive* machine.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini edingakayo kumgijimi ogijima ibanga elide?","The correct answer is **B: Umsuka kwezemidlalo onzinzile**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many supplements are unnecessary and don't have a real impact on performance. It also implies that focusing on fundamentals is more important.  The key takeaway is that a solid foundation of **training** is more valuable than expensive supplements.
"
Ubani owathola i-nuclear magnetic resonance? ,"The correct answer is **C: uBloch noPurcell**.

The passage states: ""I-MRI isuselwa esenzakalweni sesayensi esibizwa nge-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), eyatholwa ngawo-1930 ngu-Felix Bloch (owayesebenza eNyuvesi yase-Stanford) kanye no-Edward Purcell (waseNyuvesi yase-Havard).""
"
Kwakumuphi umnyaka lapho i-patent yokuqala yavunyelwa ukwenza i- medical imaging resonance? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""NgoNyaka ka-1970, uRaymond Damadian, udokotela wezokwelapha kanye nososayensi wocwaningo, uthole isisekelo sokusebenzisa izithombe zommemo kazibuthe njengethuluzi lokucilonga kwezokwelapha. Iminyaka emine kamuva incwadi yemvume yanikezwa, okwakuyincwadi yemvume yokuqala emhlabeni enikezwe enkundleni yeMRI.""

Four years after 1970 is 1974.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini abantu okumelwe bayiqonde ukuze bakwazi ukuchaza izenzo zabanye?","The correct answer is **B: Inhloso**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngokwesibonelo, uma ubona umuntu ephula iwindi lemoto, ngokuvamile ungacabanga ukuthi ubefuna ukweba imoto yomuntu ongamazi. Wayezodinga ukwahlulelwa ngokuhlukile uma ngabe wayelahle izikhiye zemoto yakhe futhi bekuyimoto yakhe ayezama ukuyigqekeza.""  This illustrates that understanding the *intention* behind an action is crucial for interpreting it correctly.

While the passage mentions other things like what people see, like, believe, and desire, the core point is that **understanding their intention** allows us to explain their actions. Therefore, ""Inhloso"" (Intention) is the best fit.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuqonda i-intention kuzosiza abantu ukuba benze ini?","The correct answer is **A: Susa ukungaqiniseki ekwenzeni izinto**.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding intention helps us clarify the *reason* behind actions.  This clarification removes uncertainty about *why* someone did something.  Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bikezela izifiso:** While understanding intention *can* relate to desires, the passage's main point isn't about predicting desires.
* **C: Bheka abanye ngaphandle kokubahlulela:**  While understanding intention *can* lead to less judgment, it's not the primary function described in the passage. The core is understanding *why* they acted.
* **D: Funda iziqgondo zabanye:** The passage states that humans are capable of reading minds. Understanding intention is a *part* of reading minds, not the *result* of understanding intention.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okunembile ngenhloso enkulu ka-AI?","The correct answer is **D: Umsebenzi ozihlelayo (Task automation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ucwaningo lwezamarobothi luhlanganisa ukwenza imishini yenze ngokuzenzakalekayo imisebenzi edinga ukucabanga komuntu.""  It then lists examples like ""ukulawula, ukuhlela nokwenza isheduli...""  This all points towards the core goal of AI being to automate tasks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukukwenza amalungiselelo (Making preparations):** While AI *might* be involved in preparations, it's not the primary goal.
* **B: Ukuzwa izwi (Hearing voice):**  Voice recognition is a *capability* of AI, but not the overarching goal.  The passage mentions voice interaction as an example of what AI *can do*.
* **C: Ukuhlela (Organizing):** Organizing is an example of a task AI can automate, but not the ultimate purpose.

Therefore, **Task automation (Umsebenzi ozihlelayo)** is the most accurate representation of AI's primary goal as described in the passage.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, esikhathini esinengi ikuphi okulandelayo okuhlotshaniswa ne-AI?","The correct answer is **A: Insizakalo yekhasimende**.

The text explicitly states: ""Zibonelo zihlanganisa ukulawula, ukuhlela nokwenza isheduli, **ikhono lokuphendula ukubhula nemibuzo yekhasimende**...""  This directly links AI to customer service.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyinxenye enamandla kumuntu ohlezi anemicabango yokuhlangana?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuqaphela izimpendulo ezinembile enkingeni**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a key characteristic of this type of thinking is that there's only *one* correct answer.  Therefore, the focus is on identifying and prioritizing the correct solution. The other options are not as directly emphasized as core components of this thinking style.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ukusebenzisa izindlela ezintja ekuxazulula ikinga:** While problem-solving is involved, the passage emphasizes the *organized* nature of the thinking, not necessarily random approaches.
*   **C: Ukuthatha isikhathi ukuxazulula ikinga:** The passage mentions *speed* as a characteristic, implying efficiency, not necessarily a deliberate time-consuming process.
*   **D: Ukukhumbula amaphethini:** While pattern recognition is helpful, it's not the defining characteristic of this particular thinking style as described in the passage.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kucatshangelwa kumuntu oneqgondo ethanda ukuhlanganisa abantu?","The correct answer is **D: Ukubuthelela imimininigwane (Distracting from details)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes a type of thinking that is focused, logical, and seeks a single, correct answer. 
* **""Ukubuthelela imimininigwane""** directly contradicts this.  The described thinking emphasizes focusing on relevant information and not being derailed by irrelevant details.  It's the opposite of letting distractions interfere.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the described thinking:

* **A: Ukuqonda ukuthi kunempendulo eyodwa enembile:** This is a core characteristic of the thinking style.
* **B: Ukuthatha siskhathi sakho:**  Logical thinking often requires careful consideration and taking time to analyze.
* **C: Ukubona amaqiniso:**  This is essential for building a solid foundation for logical reasoning.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that doesn't align with the described thinking style.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kucatshangelwe njenge-micro-expression?","The correct answer is **A: Ukushalazela amehlo njengoba ukukhuluma (Blinking as if speaking)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes micro-expressions as very brief, involuntary facial expressions lasting only a fraction of a second. They are subtle and often fleeting.

*   **B: Ukusika ishiya (Lip pursing)** - This is a classic example of a micro-expression, often indicating disapproval or tension.
*   **C: Ukucwayiza kaningana (Brief grimaces)** - These are also considered micro-expressions, reflecting a fleeting emotion.
*   **D: Ukunikeza imvume ngesithupha (Sixth-second nod)** - A quick nod can be a micro-expression of agreement.

**Blinking as if speaking** is a normal, relatively controlled action that doesn't fit the description of a spontaneous, involuntary, and brief micro-expression. It's more related to speech patterns than subtle emotional displays.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaziwe okungelona iqiniso nge-micro-expression?,"The correct answer is **C: Inkulumo kuhlanganise nesimo sobuso kuyahumushwa (Speech and facial expression are translated)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on micro-expressions as involuntary, fleeting displays of emotion.** It specifically mentions they are often hidden and can reveal true feelings even when someone is trying to deceive.
* **Option C suggests a direct translation of speech and facial expression.** The passage doesn't support this. It implies micro-expressions are often *opposite* of what someone is saying, or they reveal underlying emotions *not* being explicitly expressed in the words.
* **The other options *are* supported by the passage:**
    * **A: Ukuqopha kwamavidiyo kwenze izinto ezibalulekile zathuthukiswa (Video recording has led to important developments):**  The passage states video recording allows for the detailed analysis of micro-expressions.
    * **B: Ukumusha okuqondile kungathola amanga (Direct deception can be revealed):** The passage directly states people can see through deception by analyzing micro-expressions.
    * **D: Kungakusiza uhlolisise uzwela (It can help you assess feelings):**  The passage mentions that understanding micro-expressions can help understand someone's feelings.



Therefore, option C is the statement that is *not* accurate based on the information provided in the passage.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okwaba okubalulekile okwaholela ekutheni kuvuselela izinto? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ukukhumbula umlayezo (Remembering the message)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the shift involved a move *away* from relying on memorization to focusing on remembering *written* information. This implies that the ability to **remember the message** communicated in the written form became crucial.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ukuzicabanga komuntu (Human Thinking):** While important, the passage doesn't specifically point to a change in human thinking as the *direct* cause of the shift. It's more about how information *was accessed* and *processed*.
* **B: Ukuzungeza ulwazi (Surrounding with information):** The passage focuses on a shift *away* from simply being surrounded by information and *towards* a more deliberate focus on written text.
* **D: Ukuzuza nolwazi (Acquiring and knowledge):** Acquiring knowledge is a continuous process, and the passage is about a *change in the method* of accessing and retaining that knowledge.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**. The key change was shifting the focus from memorizing information generally to specifically remembering information conveyed *through written messages*.



"
"Okuvezwe imiphumela okuvuselela, ikuphi okulandelayo okungagcizelwanga kakhulu?","The best answer is **A: Ukuzicabanga komuntu (Human thought)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on changes in *how* information is acquired and processed.** It highlights the shift from rote memorization to a more text-based and potentially less emotionally-charged approach to learning.
* **The passage explicitly mentions changes in:**
    * **The way information is obtained:**  From direct experience/memory to text.
    * **The role of emotion:**  Less reliance on emotional connection for remembering.
    * **Memory:** Shift to textual memory.
    * **Knowledge dissemination:** Easier spread of information.

* **""Ukuzicabanga komuntu"" (Human thought) is a very broad concept.** While changes in information acquisition *could* indirectly influence human thought, the passage doesn't directly address or imply a change in fundamental human thought processes. The other options (having knowledge, remembering messages, spreading information) are all directly related to the specific changes described in the passage.

Therefore, the most *unrelated* outcome, based on the passage, is a change in general human thought.  The other choices are direct consequences of the shift in information handling methods.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungakhuthazi ukusebenzisa i-inthanethi ukuze uqubeke nokuthandana?,"The best answer is **A: Ezimayelana namabhizinisi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes social interaction and connection as key drivers of internet use.** It highlights ""social interaction"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as important motivators.
* **Business-related activities are generally not primarily focused on social interaction.** While online business communication exists, it's more task-oriented than relationship-oriented.
* **The other options align with the passage's focus:**
    * **B: Ukuxhumana nomndeni njalo:** Directly related to ongoing relationships.
    * **C: Ucwaningo lokuhamba:** Can involve connecting with others who share similar interests.
    * **D: Ukuhlanga nabantu abasha:** Directly involves forming new connections.

Therefore, business-related activities are the least likely to motivate someone to use the internet *specifically* to continue building and nurturing relationships, according to the provided text.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezi isikhuthazo sokusebenzisa i-inthanethi ukuzibandakanyeni komuntu siqu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukugcwaninga nomkhiqizo wokunakekela impilo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes social interaction and community engagement as key motivators for internet use.** It specifically mentions ""social interaction"" and ""ongoing relationships"" as important drivers.

Let's look at the options:

* **A: Ukubheka incwadi yokupheka:** This is primarily a solitary activity focused on information gathering, not social interaction.
* **B: Ukufaka ku-inthanethi izinxoxo zebhodi:**  This *directly* involves social interaction, contributing to community engagement.
* **C: Ukugcwaninga nomkhiqizo wokunakekela impilo:** This is primarily an individual activity focused on personal research and decision-making. While it *might* involve discussing health with others, the core action is individual.
* **D: Ukuhlela izimali:** Similar to cooking, this is mainly an individual financial management task.

Therefore, researching health products aligns least with the passage's focus on social and community-driven internet use.



"
Kunini lapho intshonalanga Yurophu yayeka ukuthembela emathonyeni wokuphila yase iqala eyayo inkambo yokuphila?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemva kweminyaka eyi-25 ye-Middle Ages**.

The text states: ""Ngasekupheleni kweNkathi Ephakathi intshonalanga Yurophu yaqala ukuthuthukisa isitayela sayo."" This means that the shift away from Byzantine styles and the development of new styles in Western Europe happened *after* the Middle Ages had been ongoing for a while (over 25 years).
"
Ukusebenza izinkinobho ukubopha izimpahla kwaveza miphi imiphumela? ,"The correct answer is **C: AmaCrusades**.

The text explicitly states: ""Enye yentuthuko enkulu kakhulu yaleso sikhathi ngenxa yabalweli benkolo abantu baqala ukusebenzisa izinkinobho ukubopha izimpahla zokugqoka.""  The ""leso sikhathi"" refers to the time of the Crusades. While the other options are relevant periods, the text directly links the use of buttons to the Crusaders.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo ocatshangelwayo okungaba isombululo ezinkingeni zemvelo?","The correct answer is **C: Ubona ibangena yekinga (Identify the root cause of the problem)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kodwa uma singafuni isisombululo sesikhashana, kumelwe sithole umsuka wenkinga bese sinqanda wona."" (But if we don't want a temporary solution, we must find the root cause of the problem and prevent it.)  This directly aligns with the idea of ""ubona ibangena yekinga.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukunqaba ukunqumo zempilo ephezulu (Reject high-level health decisions):** This is irrelevant to environmental problems.
* **B: Ubushoshovu (Procrastination):**  Procrastination doesn't solve problems; it delays action.
* **D: Ukuba umgani womnyakazo kwezinto eziphathele nezemvelo (Be a prognosticator of natural and environmental things):**  While understanding future trends is important, it doesn't solve the *current* problems.  The passage emphasizes addressing the *root cause*.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izinto ezilandelayo ekungeke zicatshangelwe njenge zinto ezingalapha izinkinga zemvelo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukucisha imbangenla yenkinga (Ignoring the root cause of the problem)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while local initiatives and coping mechanisms (like a bandage) can help temporarily, **addressing the root cause is necessary for a lasting solution.** Ignoring the root cause is presented as a *failure* to find a proper solution.
* Options A, C, and D are all presented as potential approaches to mitigating the problems:
    * **A: Ukuba yinxenye yobushoshovu (Being part of the solution):** Participating in local initiatives is seen as a way to contribute to a solution.
    * **C: Ukuveza umbono ngezinqumo zempilo ephezulu (Adopting a healthy lifestyle):** This is presented as a proactive step to reduce future suffering.
    * **D: Ukuphila endaweni enobuntu (Living in a sustainable way):**  This aligns with the passage's concern about the impact of human activity on the environment.



Therefore, ignoring the root cause is the *opposite* of what the passage advocates, and thus the correct answer to the question.



"
Iliphi izwe lokuqala laseYurophu lapho indaba yalo yayixile ekulinganiseni kwamandla kuzenkolo?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

The passage states: ""IMpi Yokulandelana Kobukhosi baseSpeyini yaphawula impi yokuqala leyo impikiswano yayo enkulu kwakungukulinganiselwa kwamandla.""  This directly indicates that Spain was the first European nation where the issue of balancing power was a central concern, *and* that this was a key element of the Spanish War of the Spanish Succession.  The passage then connects this to the decline of religiously motivated wars.
"
Iyiphi impi kwesinye isikhathi ichawe ngokuthi impi yenkolo?,"The correct answer is **A: Impi Yeminyaka Emashumi Amathathu**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngakho, iMpi yeMinyaka engaMashumi amaThathu bekuzoba yimpi yokugcina ebizwa ngokuthi yimpi engokwenkolo."" (Therefore, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war called a religious war.)



"
Ikuphi olandelayo okuthile kwesonto lamaKatolica okungazange kwaxekwa?,"The answer is **C: Ukugxila kakhulu egunyeni eSontweni (The excessive focus on the authority of the Church)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Church's immense power and wealth, accumulated over a thousand years, led many to question whether the principle of using wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty was actually being followed. This implies a concern that the Church might be prioritizing its *own* power and authority over its stated mission of charity and service.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Ukunikana kwencebo emaSontweni bekufaneleka (The distribution of wealth in the Church was appropriate):** The passage *questions* the appropriateness of the Church's handling of its wealth, not its distribution.
*   **B: Ukufundiswa ezinkolweni kumelwe kulungiswe (Religious teaching should be corrected):** The passage doesn't specifically address the quality of religious teaching.
*   **D: Ukube ufundiswa emaSontweni kuyenziwa (That teaching is done in the churches):** This is a factual statement and not a point of criticism raised in the passage.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owabulawa eVersailles?","The correct answer is **D: Unogada**.

The text states: ""kunesikhathi lapho ilungu loquqaba lalifuna ukunqathuzisa ikhanda lonogada wasebukhosini obulawe eVersailles phambi kweNdlovukazi ethukile."" (At one point, a member of the crowd tried to impale the head of a guard of the royal palace who had been killed at Versailles before the enraged Queen.)"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kwenziwa ngenkani eNkosini neNdlovukazi yayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuhamba okungalindelekile kweVersailles**.

Here's why:

* The passage states they were *forced* to return to Paris by the crowd. This implies their departure from Versailles was not voluntary or unexpected.
* The passage details their arrival in Paris and the hostile reception.
* They *did* open the windows (A).
* They *were* forced to witness the decapitated head (C).
* They *did* return to Paris (D).

Therefore, the only action *not* described as happening is an unexpected departure from Versailles.  Their departure was part of the events leading to their forced return.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kwaba umphumela wempi ekungasetshenziswanga kwamasosha empini yaseBritain?,"The correct answer is **D: Izinto ebezidengeka kakhulu bezingatholakali lula (Highly valuable goods became unavailable)**. Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on Britain's naval blockade of Germany.** This blockade aimed to cut off Germany's access to vital supplies, including valuable resources.
* **The passage explicitly states the blockade was intended to prevent the smuggling of war materials and necessities.** This would naturally lead to shortages of certain goods.
* **Options A, B, and C are all plausible consequences of a naval blockade:**
    * **A: Isifiso saseGermany ukusebenzisa indlela efanayo yokulwa impi (Germany's desire to use a similar war strategy):** The British blockade would likely encourage Germany to develop its own underwater warfare capabilities.
    * **B: Imikhumbi engasebenzanga yaphephisa engozini (Unused ships became dangerous):** Blockaded ships might be repurposed for dangerous or unconventional uses.
    * **C: Ushintsho lwenziwa emthethweni yezizwe (Changes were made to international law):**  A prolonged and aggressive blockade could challenge existing international laws regarding warfare and neutrality.
* **Option D is the *least likely* direct result mentioned.** While shortages would certainly occur, the passage doesn't specifically mention that *highly valuable goods* became unavailable. The focus is on essential war materials and supplies, not necessarily luxury items.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer because it's not directly supported by the text and less likely to be a primary outcome of the described British naval blockade."
Imuphi umusho ongaqinisekisiwe ochaza ukuvimbezela kwemikhumbi yezimpi yeBrithani kumaJalimani?,"The correct answer is **B: Iququzele isubmarine yaseGermany yokulwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states Britain started blockading German ships.** This is a fact.
* **The passage mentions the blockade made it impossible to remove supplies for both military and civilian use.** This is also stated as fact.
* **The passage says Britain was also laying naval mines.** This is a stated fact.
* **However, the passage *doesn't* say the blockade *provoked* German U-boats to fight.** While the blockade *did* provoke Germany into using U-boats, the passage only describes the British actions and their consequences. It doesn't explicitly state the German response was *caused* by the blockade.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that isn't directly supported by the passage. The other options are either stated facts or logical consequences of the actions described.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, kungafanela bani ukuhlolwa okunengi kweSclerosis?","The correct answer is **A: Owesifazane oneminyaka eyi-32**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that women have twice the chance of developing MS compared to men.
*   The question asks who *should* be tested. While anyone experiencing symptoms should be evaluated, the information given highlights women as being at higher risk.
*   An 32-year-old woman falls within the age range where MS is commonly diagnosed (adults in middle age) and aligns with the gender risk factor mentioned.

The other options are less likely based on the information:

*   **B: Umfana oneminyaka ey-15:** While MS can occur in younger people, it's less common than in adults. The passage focuses on adults and older adults.  Also, males are less likely to develop MS.
*   **C: Indoda oneminyaka ey-43:**  While this is within the age range for MS, the passage highlights the higher risk in women.
*   **D: Intombazane oneminyaka ey-10:** MS is rare in children and adolescents.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, abahlanganyelo bomsebenzi othile badinga ukuba basekelwe kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Umbono ongafanele ngokuzwa ubuhlungu**.

The passage states: ""Labo abazibandakanya emisebenzini evamile badinga ukusekelwa okwengeziwe mayelana nokuzwa ubuhlungu..."" This directly indicates a need for support related to a *misconception about pain*.  While stress and fear contribute to the problem, the passage highlights the inaccurate perception of pain as something more catastrophic than it is.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ifencing idalwa njani?","The correct answer is **D: Ngokwendlela okusebenza ngayo kuhlanganisewe.**

Here's why:

The paragraph states that fencing is played at *multiple levels*, from university students to professionals and the Olympics. It also describes it as a *system of competition involving combat with weapons*. This suggests a combination of different elements, not just one specific level or competition. Option D, ""Ngokwendlela okusebenza ngayo kuhlanganisewe"" (In the way it works combined), best captures this idea of a combined system.

The other options are too narrow:

*   **A: Ngokwendlela yamanje** (Currently) - Doesn't explain the origin or how it started.
*   **B: Ngokwezinga le-nyuvesi** (At the university level) - Only focuses on one level of competition.
*   **C: Ngokwezinga le-olympic** (At the Olympic level) - Only focuses on one level of competition.



"
"Ngokuya komusho, ikuphi okulandelayo okunamdla okuveziwe okungaba yishefu yangaphakathi?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlanza nokujuluka (Foul odor and discharge)**.

The passage specifically states: ""Isibonakaliso esihle kakhulu soshevu ovela ngaphakathi kungaba ukuba khona kwezitsha zemithi ezivulekile noma amakhemikhali wasendlini anobuthi."" which translates to ""A very good indicator of an internal infection can be the presence of opened herbal preparations or household chemicals with butyric acid.""  ""Butyric acid"" is a substance known for causing a foul odor.  Discharge is also a common symptom of infection.

The other options are not mentioned in the passage as indicators of an internal infection.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isinyathelo sokuqala esiqondile okumelwe usithathe ukuze uhlole isisulu?","The correct answer is **C: Bheka ukuthi olimaziwe umi kanjani.**

The passage states, ""Ukuhlola umuntu ohlukunyeziwe, a kufanele kuqalauhlole indawo yesehlakalo ukuqinisekisa ukuphepha kwakho. Udinga ukubona indawo yesisulu njengoba usondela kuye nanoma yiziphi izimpawu eziyisixwayiso."" This means you should first observe the situation and the person's posture/position.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungakanembi okukhuluma ngokuthi olinyaziwe kumelwe ahlolwe njani?,"The correct answer is **B: Hlolisisa indawo ngaphambi kokubheka olinyaziwe.**

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes the importance of assessing the surroundings for safety *before* approaching someone who is injured. Option B directly reflects this advice.  The text warns against prioritizing your own safety by immediately focusing on the injured person without checking the environment first.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukungakhathazeki kakhulu ngokunakekela ukulimala kwakho:** This is the opposite of what the text advises. It's about *prioritizing* your safety.
* **C: Bheka ukuthi olinyaziwe ukuphi:**  While location is important, the text stresses the importance of assessing the *area* for safety, not just the person's location.
* **D: Zama ukubheka ukuthi azikho izinto ezisolisayo:**  This is a component of assessing the surroundings, but option B is a more complete and accurate reflection of the initial advice given.
"
Yiluphi ishintso olwenziwa iFrench Revolution okwaba nomthelela omuhle kubantu abasebenza kahle?,"The best answer is **C: Ukutholwa kwemicabango yeRepublican**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the shift towards republican ideals.** It explicitly states that the revolution led to a belief that a nation of people, not just a monarch, was the foundation of governance. This is a core tenet of republicanism.
* **The passage directly links the revolution to opportunities for advancement.** It mentions that after the revolution, positions opened up to all men who applied, regardless of their background.  This is because the shift to republicanism emphasized merit and capability over birthright.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ukusekelwa kwesizwe okungezelelwe:** While national support *did* grow, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a *direct benefit* to well-performing individuals.
* **B: Ukususwe ukugxila ku-class kwayiswa ekuqedeni:**  While the revolution did try to dismantle the class system, the passage isn't the primary focus. The opening of positions wasn't *solely* because of class dismantling; it was tied to the broader shift in political philosophy.
* **D: Indlela entjha yokukala:** The passage compares this to military ratings, but it's not the *most important* change that benefited well-performing individuals. The shift in political ideals and opportunity was more fundamental.



Therefore, **C** best captures the central impact of the French Revolution on the advancement of capable individuals.



"
"Ukulandela iFrench Revolution, ukuphumelela kwamasosha nabanye ezengini elithile kwakusekelwe kuphi?","The correct answer is **D: Izinga eliphezulu (Ratings)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Futhi ngemva kweNguquko izikhundla zazivulekele bonke abesilisa abafake izicelo okwavumela ukuthi abafuna ukuvelela kakhulu nokubahambela kahle baphumelele.""  And later it compares this to military systems: ""Lokhu kufana nalokhu okwenzeka kumabutho amasosha kunokuba babheke inhlanga yakho bona bakhetha ukubeka i-cailaber ukuze banike amasosha ama-ratings.""

This indicates that success and advancement after the French Revolution were based on a **system of ratings**, similar to how military personnel are assessed.  The passage doesn't mention style, ideology, or general success as the *basis* for advancement; it points to a structured rating system.



Therefore, **D: Izinga eliphezulu (Ratings)** is the most accurate answer.



"
Yimuphi umsebenzi womphakathi obangela ukuthi ungajabulisi emazweni athuthukile?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezokuthutha zomphakathi (Public Transportation)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states:** ""Wonke umuntu uyakhalaza ngohlelo lokuthutha."" (Everyone complains about the public transportation system.) This directly links public transportation to widespread complaints.
* **The prompt highlights the similarity:** The prompt draws a parallel between complaints about public transportation and complaints about water quality or sewage in developed countries. This reinforces that public transportation is a common source of public dissatisfaction.

The other options are not directly addressed in the prompt. While water quality and sewage are important issues, the prompt focuses specifically on public transportation. Education is generally not associated with widespread complaints in the same way that a functioning public transit system is.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungathiwani ezokuthutha zomphakathi?","The correct answer is **C: Abanga izinkulumo ezingenig kulabo abawasebenzisa kakhulu** (They are not as bad as people who use them a lot).

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights widespread dissatisfaction with public transportation.** It states that ""Cishe wonke umuntu uyakhalaza ngohlelo lokuthutha"" (Almost everyone complains about the public transportation system).
* **The passage implies a deeper problem than just complaints.** It points to similar complaints about water quality and sewage in developed countries, suggesting a systemic issue.
* **Option C directly addresses the overall negative perception.** It suggests that the problems aren't as severe as they might seem to those who don't use public transport regularly. This implies there's more to the issue than just surface-level complaints.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zithanda kakhulu yiwo wonke umuntu ozisebenzisayo (They are very loved by everyone who uses them).** This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **B: Wona awekho mabi kangako ngokuya ngezinga lamanzi (They are not that bad in terms of water quality).** While water quality is mentioned, the passage doesn't specifically relate it *to* the public transportation system itself.  The complaint is about public transportation.
* **D: Akhululekile kulamazwe asethuthuke kakhulu (They are comfortable in developed countries).** The passage explicitly mentions complaints *in developed countries*, so this is incorrect.



Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it accurately reflects the passage's core message of widespread dissatisfaction and hints at underlying issues.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okungaba nzima ukulinganisa ngenxa yezenso ezingakalindeleki kwabashayeli?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuhamba kwe-traffic (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukucwaninga ukuhamba kwezimoto kunzima ngoba imikhuba yabashayeli angeke ibikezelwe ngokuqiniseka okuphelele."" This directly refers to the unpredictability of driver behavior, which is a key aspect of traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isivinini se-traffic (Traffic speed)**: While traffic speed is related to traffic flow, the passage specifically points to the *unpredictability of driver behavior* as the difficulty.
* **B: Ukuhlelwa kwendlela (Road layout)**: The road layout is a factor that *influences* traffic flow, but the passage doesn't say it's difficult to measure because of unpredictable drivers.
* **C: Ukusebenza kwezindlela (Road performance)**: This refers to the condition of the roads, and again, the passage doesn't link difficulty in measurement to driver unpredictability.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **D: Ukuhamba kwe-traffic**."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okusebenzayo uma uveza ukuhamba kwe-traffic ngokwezibalo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukusebenza kwezindlela (Road operations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that traffic flow can be modeled numerically by relating three key factors:

1.  **Ukuhamba (Traffic flow)**
2.  **Ukuminyana (Spacing)**
3.  **Isivinini (Speed)**

The passage further mentions that this relationship is helpful for planning, design, and use of road structures.  Therefore, modelling traffic flow *numerically* directly relates to how roads *operate*.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ukuziphatha komshayeli (Driver behavior):** While driver behavior *influences* traffic flow, the passage focuses on the *numerical modeling* of flow, not the intricacies of driver actions.
*   **C: Umklamo wendlela (Road design):** Road design is *affected by* traffic flow modelling, but it isn't the direct result of *expressing* traffic flow numerically.
*   **D: Isisindo se-traffic (Traffic volume):** Traffic volume is a factor *within* traffic flow, but expressing traffic flow numerically goes beyond simply stating the volume. It implies modelling how the traffic *moves*.



"
Basebenzise ini uHershey noChase ukufaka iDNA? ,"The correct answer is **A: Radioactive phosphorus**.

Here's why:

*   The question states that Hershey and Chase used radioactive phosphorus to label the DNA of the bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria).
*   They also used radioactive sulfur to label the proteins of the bacteriophages. This allowed them to track where the DNA and proteins went during the infection process.

Therefore, radioactive phosphorus was used to label the DNA."
Ukwazi ukushintsha kwezakhi zofuzo bese kudluliselwa kwenye into ephilayo ukuze kwenzeke kuncike kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Okumangazayo kwegenetic material**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that mutation in the bacterial cell wall can be passed on to offspring.** This implies that the genetic material (DNA) within the cell is being altered.
* **Mutation is a change in the genetic material.** It's a fundamental process that leads to variations in organisms.
* **Option B directly addresses the source of genetic variation – changes in the genetic material.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uma amaseli angama seli wobulili (If the reproductive cells are somatic cells):** While somatic mutations don't get passed on, the question is about *how* the change is passed on, not *what type of cells* are involved in the transmission.
* **C: Uhlobo oluthile kwezakhi zofuzo (A specific type of cell wall):** The passage mentions cell wall changes *as a result* of mutation, but the mutation itself is the crucial element being passed on.  It's not the cell wall type itself.
* **D: Uma ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo mazikwazi ukubanga ukufa kweseli (If the cell wall mutation can cause cell death):**  Cell death might be *a consequence* of a mutation, but it doesn't explain *how* the mutation is transmitted. The passage focuses on the transmission aspect.



Therefore, the passage's core idea of how genetic variation is transmitted is linked to changes in the genetic material (DNA).
"
"Ngokuya kolwazi olunikeze yilesi sigaba, ukuhlukahlukana nemiphumela kwezakhi zofuzo azincikanga kuphi?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuthinteka kwe-genetic material okumangazayo (Erroneous genetic material)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ukuguquka kungaba namathonya ahlukile angafani kuye ngohlobo lokuguquka, ukubaluleka kocezu lwesakhi sofuzo oluthintekile kanye nokuthi amangqamuzana athintekile amangqamuzana esidoda neqanda yini."" This emphasizes that the *type* of genetic material affected is crucial to the variation.
* **The passage further states:** ""Ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo emagqamuzaneni wamagciwane kuphela okungadluliselwa ezinganeni..."" This points to alterations in the genetic material within the bacterial chromosomes as the source of heritable variation.
* **Option C, ""Ukuthinteka kwe-genetic material okumangazayo,""** directly reflects this focus on changes within the genetic material (DNA). The term ""okumangazayo"" (erroneous) captures the nature of mutations which are often errors in DNA replication or repair.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Okungakani okuthintekile kwe-genetic material (The location of the affected genetic material):** While location *is* a factor, the passage highlights the *nature of the change* more strongly.
* **B: Uma amaseli alimele ewobulili (When cells are damaged during replication):** This describes a *cause* of mutations, not the variation itself.
* **D: Uhlobo oluthile lwezakhi zofuzo oluthintekile (A specific type of affected chromosome):** The passage mentions different types of mutations, but the core point is the change in the genetic material itself.



Therefore, option C best encapsulates the key information from the passage regarding the source of variation and heritability.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okwakungeson isizathu amasiko wasendulo agcine izimbuzi?,"The correct answer is **D: Basinikeza nethuba lokuthola ubisi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Amasiko nezizwana zamandulo zaqala ukuzigcina njengendlela elula yokuthola ubisi..."" (Ancient cultures and traditions began to keep them as an easy way to get milk...).  The other options aren't mentioned in the text.
"
Umgomo wegalofu ukuba uthathe inani elincani lani?,"The correct answer is **C: Isikhathi**.

The passage states: ""Umdlali oshaya izikhathi ezincane kunabo bonke, noma ukushwiba kwesimuhluza, ukuze aqede umdlalo enkundleni uyawina."" This means the player who takes the *least amount of time* to complete the course wins.
"
"La kudlalwa khona igalofu, utshani busikwa kuphi kancani?","The correct answer is **B: Lapho kuhlaza khona** (Where it is green).

The text explicitly states: ""Umdlalo udlalelwa otshanini, futhi utshani olungasemigodini busikwa bube bufishane futhi bubizwa nge-green."" which translates to ""The game is played on the grass, and the grass around the holes is short and called green.""
"
Kwakuyini injongo yalolucgwaningo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuhola ugcwaningo lwesayensi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the scientific method is a ""way a country works"" and that it ""guides much scientific research.""
* It also mentions that the scientific method involves questioning, making observations, and guiding scientific inquiry. 

Option D best captures the overall purpose of the scientific method as described in the text. While the other options are *parts* of the scientific method, they don't represent the overarching goal.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini engasizi ukuze ihole ugcwaningo lwesayensi?","The correct answer is **A: Yona yodwa indlela yesayensi**

Here's why:

The passage states that the scientific method *guides* scientific research, but it doesn't say it's the *only* way. Options B, C, and D all describe components of the scientific method:

*   **B: Ukuveza imibono yokuqaphelisisa (Formulating hypotheses):** This is a crucial step in the scientific method.
*   **C: Amathuba yokususa yokugcwaningisisa (Eliminating biases):**  This is important for objective and reliable research.
*   **D: Ukwenza ugcwaningo (Conducting research):** This is the practical application of the scientific method.

Therefore, the passage indicates that relying *solely* on the scientific method would be insufficient to guide research, as it's a framework rather than the only factor.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isitatimende esikhuluma ngesiphepho esinamdla kakhulu okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Iziphepho ezinamandla zihlasela izindawo ezincani kuzinye izinhlekelele zemvelo.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that while they *can* explode and cause significant damage, the passage highlights their ability to *break through* things and cause widespread destruction. It doesn't say they primarily target small areas. In fact, the descriptions like ""break through walls"" and ""throw cars into the air"" suggest they have a wider impact.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the passage:

* **A: Iziphepho ezinamandla kakhulu zingakwazi ukumosha yonke into eziyizungezile:** This is directly stated in the first sentence: ""Izishingishane zigadla endaweni encane uma kuqhathaniswa nezinye iziphepho ezinamandla, kodwa zingabhubhisa yonke into esendleleni yazo.""
* **C: Ezingi iziphepho ezinamandla zihlala amahora angaphezu kwemithathu:** The passage explicitly states: ""Amaphesenti amabili wezishingishane ezibucayi kakhulu athatha ngaphezu kwamahora amathathu.""
* **D: Eziningi zeziphepho ezinamandla ziza nomoya ohamba ama-mile angu-300 ngehora:** The passage states: ""Isiphepho esinamdla kakhulu singa hamba ama-mile angu-300 ngehora.""

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.
"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, yimuphi umusho oqondile ochaza iziphepho ezinamandla?","The correct answer is **C: Amosha izindawo ezinkulu kunezinye izinhlekelele zemvelo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Izishingishane zigadla endaweni encane uma kuqhathaniswa nezinye iziphepho ezinamandla, kodwa zingabhubhisa yonke into esendleleni yazo."" This implies they can cause widespread destruction.
* The phrase ""Amaphesenti amabili wezishingishane ezibucayi kakhulu athatha ngaphezu kwamahora amathathu"" reinforces their destructive potential.
* Option C, ""Amosha izindawo ezinkulu kunezinye izinhlekelele zemvelo,"" directly reflects this idea of significant and widespread damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngokujwayelekile sihlala amahora angaphezu kwamahora amathathu:** This refers to the time a particularly destructive bomb takes, not a general description of powerful explosions.
* **B: Zenza imimoya ezihamba ama-mile ang-480 ngehora:** This describes the speed of a specific dangerous explosion, not the characteristics of powerful explosions in general.
* **D: Angakwazi ukususa izihlahla kusukela ezimpandeni zazo:** While the passage mentions that they *can* remove trees, it's just one detail about their destructive capabilities, not a general description of what makes them powerful.



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okuqala okwenziwe abantu kusukela ngokhulu lesi-16?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukwenza amalensi (Making lenses)**.

Here's why:

The text states that telescopes were invented in Europe in the late 16th century and used an *assembly of two lenses*. This implies that the ability to *make lenses* was a prerequisite for building telescopes. While magnification (B) is the *purpose* of a telescope, and using lenses (A) is part of the process, the text emphasizes the *creation* of the lenses as a key development.  Making a telescope to see far away (D) is the *result* of having lenses, not the first thing created.



"
Kusikhathi esingakanani lapho abantu bebesebenzisa amalensi ukukhulisa izinto abazibonayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Iminyaka eyinkulugwane**.

The passage states that people have been using lenses to magnify things for ""thousands of years."" While telescopes were invented later, the use of lenses for magnification predates the 16th century by many centuries.
"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, umhume kaMuhammad uchaza kanjani izinto zakhe zomoya namsiko?","The correct answer is **C: Ubedinga isikhashana sokuba abe yedwa.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes Muhammad's frequent retreats to the cave in Hira, a remote location far from worldly concerns. This indicates a need for solitude and a peaceful environment to focus on spiritual matters.  The description of the cave being difficult to find and the quietness of the area further supports the idea that he sought isolation for spiritual reflection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuthanda ukuthula nokuzihlukanisa:** While true, this is a consequence of his actions, not the primary *description* of how he expressed his spirituality and customs.
*   **B: Umsindo wangaphandle kungakusiza ukuba ucabange ngokujulile:** The passage states the *opposite* - the cave is quiet and devoid of worldly sounds, indicating that external noise *hindered* his spiritual thinking.
*   **D: Bekanovalo lokuthi uzobonwa nokuthi bazomuzwa:** The passage describes the cave as remote and difficult to find, suggesting he actively sought to avoid being seen or heard.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, insimbi yayisetshenziselwani ekuqaleni?","The correct answer is **A: Crossties**.

The passage states: ""Crossties were almost made of timber.""  It then goes on to explain the evolution from timber crossties to iron ones.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani amasondo wokhuni akhishwa kwafakwa wensimbi?","The correct answer is **B: Bacanga ukuthi asebenza gconywana (They proved to be less durable)**.

The passage states: ""Lokhu kwaba inqubo evamile, kodwa insimbi yayihlikihla amasondo okhuni wezinqola."" This translates to: ""This became common practice, but iron was corroding the wooden wheels of the wagons.""  Therefore, the wooden wheels weren't performing well due to corrosion, leading to the replacement with iron.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bakhuphule ijubane lehashi (They increased the horse's speed):** The passage doesn't mention speed.
* **C: Akwazi ukuthwala izinto ezisindayo (They couldn't carry heavy things):** The passage says the wagons *allowed* heavier loads to be carried.
* **D: Ebeqedwa insimbi endleleni (They were finished with iron on the road):** The passage doesn't mention anything about iron being finished on the road.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini eyakha abantu ngesikhathi seRomanticism?","The correct answer is **B: Umumo womhlaba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Esizindeni seRomanticism, indawo ibumba abantu ngabanye..."" which translates to ""In the context of Romanticism, the locality creates people with each other...""  The passage then goes on to explain that culture and customs developed *because* of this locality.  The core idea is that the **worldview (umumo womhlaba)** of a place shapes its people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imithetho (Laws):** The passage explicitly states that the cultural norms *were better than arbitrary laws*.
* **C: Amasiko (Customs):** Customs *developed* as a result of the worldview, not the creator of the people.
* **D: Isiko (Culture):** Culture is a *result* of the worldview and locality, not the primary creator of the people in this context.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezi umbono we-technological determinism? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuthuthuka kwezobuchwepheshe akuxilanga kwezinto zamasiko.**

Here's why:

* **Technological determinism** argues that technology is the primary driver of societal change. It suggests that technological advancements inevitably lead to specific social, political, and cultural outcomes.

Let's break down why each option is or isn't technological determinism:

* **A: Umthelela wezobuchwephese ezinomthelalela ngayo emphakathini ziyalawuleka:**  This aligns with technological determinism. It implies technology dictates the direction of societal change.
* **B: Ukuthuthuka kwezobuchwepheshe akuxilanga kwezinto zamasiko:** This *directly opposes* technological determinism.  Technological determinism would argue that technological advancements *do* significantly influence cultural elements. Option B suggests that culture is not rigidly determined by technology.
* **C: Ubuchwepheshe kunomthelela ongokwemvelo emphakathini:** This *supports* technological determinism.  It suggests technology has a natural and inherent impact on society.
* **D: Ukuthuthuka kwezobuchwepheshe akuxilanga kwezepolotiki:** This *supports* technological determinism. It suggests that political systems are influenced by technology.

Therefore, option B is the only one that doesn't reflect a technological deterministic viewpoint. It acknowledges the role of culture as something separate from and not solely determined by technology.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo okubonisa ukuthi akuhlobene neze nokudonsa umnsalo?","The correct answer is **A: Umsindo ophansi kamnandi**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that ""umnsalo ophezulu ujwayele ukwenza umsindo opholile, kanti umnsalo ophansi wenza umsindo onamandla noqinile kakhudlwana.""  Therefore, a *soft* sound is associated with the top mark, and a *loud* sound is associated with the bottom mark. Saying the ""umundo ophansi kamnandi"" contradicts this.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Umaka ofana ne-staple:** The text describes the ""umaka lokukhothama phansi"" as looking like a staple. This is a direct description of the visual representation.
* **C: umsindo onamandla:** The text explicitly states that the ""umnsalo ophansi wenza umsindo onamandla noqinile kakhudwana.""
* **D: Ukuqala lapho kunesixoxo khona:** The text explains that the top mark means you start at the end and push the bow, and the bottom mark means you start at the bow (where you hold the bow) and draw the bow. This describes the starting point for the bottom mark.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuphi okulandelayo okuhlotshaniswa umsindo omnene?","The correct answer is **C: Umaka ofana neV**.

The text states: ""Umnsalo ophezulu ujwayele ukwenza umsindo opholile..."" which translates to ""The upper note usually makes a mellow sound..."" and the upper note is described as looking like a ""V"".
"
Izinsalelo zamathambo ziveza ukuthi izandla zajwayela ukwenza muphi umsebenzi ojwayelekile?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuthwala okusindayo (Carrying heavy loads)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that chimpanzee hands and feet are similar in size and length, indicating the hand was used for carrying weight while walking on all fours.
* It also mentions that human hands are shorter than feet but have more flexible fingers for grasping.
* The evolution of hand bones over millions of years points to a shift from grasping to carrying.

Therefore, the bone remnants suggest the hand was primarily used for carrying heavy objects. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuphathwa kabi (Poor manipulation):** The passage states the opposite; human hands developed more for grasping.
* **C: i-Locomition (Locomotion):** While hands and feet are involved in locomotion, the primary focus of the passage is on carrying.
* **D: Uhambo lwe-knuckle (Knuckle-walking):** This is how chimpanzees walk, not how the bone evolution of the hand suggests humans used it.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokunembile isandla se-chimpanzee? ,"The correct answer is **A: Aqondile kunezomuntu’** (More dexterous than human hands).

Here's why:

* The passage states that chimpanzee hands and feet are similar in size and length.
* However, the passage also highlights that human hands are shorter than feet and have more flexible fingers (""ama-phalange athe ukuqonda kukhudlwana"").
* This implies that chimpanzee hands are *more* dexterous (capable of fine manipulation) than human hands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izandla nezinyawo kuyahluka ngesayizi** (Hands and feet differ in size): The passage explicitly states that they are similar in size.
* **C: Zisebenza ukuthwala okusindayo** (Used for carrying heavy things):  While the passage mentions the similarity of hand and foot size in relation to carrying weight, it doesn't primarily describe this as their main function.
* **D: Zisetshenjiswa ukuzwisa ubuhlungu** (Are used to feel pain):  The passage doesn't discuss pain perception in chimpanzee hands.



"
Ukukhetha kususa kuphi ukuhluka okusha kwe-genetic kwi-pool?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuhlukanisa**.

The passage states: ""Ukuguquka kwenza ukwahluka kwezakhi zofuzo okusha, futhi **ukukhetha kuzisusa emehlukweni oveziwe**."" This means selection removes the genetic differences that are expressed. Therefore, the answer is C.
"
Iyiphi into enomsebenzi wokugcwaliselela i-genetic variation?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ukuguquka kwenza ukwahluka kwezakhi zofuzo okusha..."" This directly links genetic variation to the mutation of genes. Mutations are the ultimate source of new genetic variation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuhlukanisa (Segregation):**  Segregation is the separation of allele pairs during gamete formation. It *contributes* to genetic variation, but it's not the process that *creates* new variations.
* **B: Ukuhlanganisa futhi (Recombination):** Recombination (crossing over) shuffles existing alleles, creating new combinations. This also *contributes* to genetic variation, but it's not the process that *creates* the new genetic material.
* **D: Ukuveza okuthile (Expression of something):**  This refers to how genes are expressed to produce traits.  It doesn't create new genetic variations. It's about *showing* existing variation.



Therefore, **mutation** (which is part of ""ukuguquka kwezakhi zofuzo"" - mutation of genes) is the fundamental process responsible for generating new genetic variation.
"
"Ngokuya kwemininingwane okulesi siquphu, ikuphi okulapha okumelwe kudliwe uhlobo oluthile lwabantu ukuze kuxazulule ikinga “ye-protein”?","The correct answer is **C: Izinthethe (Insects)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that insects (izinthethe) provide proteins of a high quality with all the necessary amino acids.
* It contrasts insects with plant sources like grains and legumes, which contain proteins but are often incomplete or require processing.
* The text mentions that ancient people used insects as a solution to the ""protein problem,"" mirroring a similar strategy used by modern-day termites.

Therefore, the passage directly links insects to solving the protein deficiency issue.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izikinga ezibalwe lana azibangeni ukungatholi okubalulekile kwe-amino acids?","The correct answer is **A: Izikinga zokugaya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngaphandle emahlathini, kunzima ngesilwane esinesimiso sokugaya ukudla esifana nesabantu ukwanelisa imfuneko yaso yama-amino-acid ngezitshalo ezikhona."" (Without pastures, it is difficult for an animal with a human-like digestive system to satisfy its need for amino acids from the plants available). 

This directly points to the *difficulty of digestion* as the primary problem when plants are the only food source. The other options (poor assimilation, poor growth, death) are presented as *consequences* of this difficulty in digestion.



Therefore, **A: Izikinga zokugaya** is the most accurate answer."
Kunganjani abantu be-subculture ngokwesinye isikhathi bagqamisa isizathu sokuba kuleli qembu?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngokusebenzisa isitayela njenge ndlela yophawu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that subcultures often express their group membership through distinctive styles, including fashion, behavior, and language. This makes style a key marker of belonging and a way to signal to others that they are part of the subculture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ngokuzama ukuzihlanganisa:** While some people might try to fit in, the passage focuses on how subcultures *define* themselves, not just try to blend in.
*   **B: Ngokuvumela izinkolelo zabantu ababazungezile:** Subcultures often have distinct beliefs, not just passively accepting those of others.
*   **C: Ngokuvumelana imithetho yomphakathi:** Subcultures often *challenge* societal norms. They are defined by their deviation from the mainstream.

"Ngokuya kwalombono ovezwe lana, kungenzeka ini kumntwana ophawulwe izimpawu zobandlululo okuhambisana nomcabango ojwayelekile ekuhileleni ekuziphatheni okuhambisana nakho?","The best answer is **A: Umntwana uzozama ukubalekela ukuziphatha kokweyisa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Children internalize the beliefs and values of their peer group, which influences their behavior. If a child is part of a peer group that devalues academics, they are likely to also devalue academics themselves.

* **The question asks:** What's likely to happen to a child exhibiting signs of alienation who has adopted this negative peer group mentality?

* **Option A directly addresses this:** If a child has adopted negative values (like not valuing schoolwork) from their peer group, they will likely try to *avoid* situations that reinforce those values (like school, or activities that require academic effort). This avoidance is a common manifestation of alienation.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Umntwana kungenzeka aziphathe ngendlela engafanele:** While possible, this is a broader statement. Alienation *can* lead to inappropriate behavior, but avoiding situations related to the negative values is a more direct consequence.
* **C: Umntwana kungenzeka azihlukanise nomphakathi:** The question already states the child is exhibiting signs of alienation, meaning they *are* already somewhat detached. The passage focuses on *why* they are alienated, not the alienation itself.
* **D: Umntwana kuzokunqaba ukuhlanganisa nezinye izinhlanga:** This isn't directly implied. While alienation *might* lead to isolating from other groups, the focus is on the internal conflict arising from the adopted values.

Therefore, **A** is the most logical and direct consequence of internalizing negative peer group values and exhibiting signs of alienation.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ulwazi lomntwana alaziyo ngobandlululo okujwayelekile kungaba nomthelela kuziphi izinto ezilandelayo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuziphatha kwabo (Their behavior)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that young children internalize the values and beliefs of their social group, and these beliefs influence how they behave. The example given directly connects a child's internalized belief about school performance (based on their social group's expectations) to their actual behavior in school.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Idlanzana lobandlululo akakhetha ukumveza ngalo (The child doesn't choose to express it):** While a child might not consciously choose to express a belief, the passage focuses on *how* those beliefs influence behavior, not necessarily outward expression.
* **C: Ubungani nezinye izingane (Friendship with other children):**  While social group influence *can* affect friendships, the passage's primary focus is on the internal impact on the individual child's behavior.
* **D: Indlela abachazangayo uhlanga (The way they describe their group):** The passage doesn't directly address how children *describe* their group. It focuses on how they *internalize* the group's values.



Therefore, **B** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kuhambisane nokukhulise komntwana oyisilwane?","The correct answer is **B: Amakhono anamandla wokukhulumisana (Strong communication skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that children raised by animals tend to exhibit behaviors similar to those of the animal they were raised by, such as fear or indifference towards people.  This implies a deficit in human social development.

*   **A: Ukuphila ngokuzimela (Independence):** While the passage doesn't directly state independence, a child raised by an animal would likely have developed some level of self-reliance to survive.
*   **C: Ukuthambekela kokuzihlukanisa (Fear of separation):**  Being raised by an animal would likely result in a fear of separation from the animal caregiver, as they would have a strong bond.
*   **D: Ukuthuswa umphakathi (Social withdrawal):**  The passage explicitly states that children raised by animals exhibit fear or indifference towards people, which aligns with social withdrawal.

However, **strong communication skills** are directly linked to human social development. A child raised by an animal would likely *lack* strong communication skills because they wouldn't have learned to communicate effectively with humans. This is the most incongruous option with the passage's description of the behavior of children raised by animals.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okuqondile okuchaza ukuphatha kwesilwane komntwana?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuziphatha okwesilwane okunengi kubangelwa ukungahlangani nabantu njalo.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Lapho ikhuliswe ngokuphelele isilwane ekungesona umuntu, ingane enobulwane iveza ukuziphatha (ngokulinganiselwa okungokoqobo) cishe okufana ngokuphele nokwesilwane ebesiyinakekela, njengokusaba noma ukungabi nandaba nabantu."" This directly links the animalistic behavior to a lack of human interaction (""ukungahlangani nabantu njalo"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuziphatha njengesilwane kubangelwa ukuhlangazihlanganisi nabantu** - This is the opposite of what the text describes. Animalistic behavior arises from *lack* of human interaction.
*   **C: Ukuziphatha okwesilwane kubonakala kubantwana ebebavalelwe abazali babo** - While being confined by parents *can* be a factor in the development of these behaviors, the text implies that the *primary* factor is a lack of human interaction, not just confinement.
*   **D: Konke ukuziphatha kwesilwane kubangwa ukukhubazeka kwegqondo** - The text doesn't state that all animalistic behavior is caused by emotional trauma, only that it's a consequence of the lack of human interaction.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, iziphi izinto ezingenzeki njalo esiphathelene ukulima kwasekhaya?","The correct answer is **B: Ukukhiqiza ukudla ukuthengilsele abanye.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that subsistence farming is for meeting the needs of the farmer and their family *only*. It's not about producing surplus for sale.  The other options are either things that *can* happen (A and C are possible aspects of subsistence farming) or are not directly addressed by the passage (D is about seed sharing, not necessarily a core aspect of subsistence farming itself).
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okunembile okuchaza ukwenza ezolimo kwasemakhaya?,"The correct answer is **A: Uhlelo lokulima okuphilayo (Subsistence farming)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly defines subsistence farming as ""ukulima okwenzelwa ukukhiqiza ukudla okwanele ukuhlangabezana nezidingo zomlimi nomdeni wakhe kuphela."" This directly aligns with the description of a ""uhlelo lokulima okuphilayo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isebenzisa indlela ehlukile yokonga izitshalo (Uses a different method of cultivating plants):** While subsistence farming *might* use different cultivation methods, that's not the defining characteristic. The focus is on self-sufficiency.
* **C: Ivumela abalimi ukuba babelane izitshalo esigodini sonke (Allows farmers to share crops throughout the region):** This describes a different type of agricultural practice, likely related to trade or community sharing, not subsistence farming.
* **D: Kusetshenjiswa abalimi kwezinye izizwe (It is practiced in other countries):** The text states it's practiced in many developed countries, but that doesn't define *what* it is.



Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately describes subsistence farming as defined in the text."
Ukuvakashela imnyuziyami kuwela ngaphansi kwasi isigaba kwezokuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwezokuvakasha zokuzijabulisa**.

Here's why:

The passage defines ""Ukuvakasha Kokuzijabulisa"" (Leisure Travel) as travel to a different place for recreation and enjoyment. Visiting a museum falls under this category because people go to museums for enjoyment, learning, and leisure, not for business or cultural immersion in the way the other options suggest. While museums *can* offer cultural insights, the primary motivation for most museum visits is for personal enjoyment.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi into esemqoka kwabavakashi kwezokuzijabulisa?","The correct answer is **A: Bazijabulisa ngesiko elithile elisendaweni**.

Here's why:

The passage states that recreational travel is about going to a place ""very different from what they usually do every day to be entertained."" The key word here is ""entertained,"" which implies enjoyment and experiencing something new, often related to the local culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Baziphumuza ngalokho abajwayele ukukwenza nzuku zonke:** This is the opposite of recreational travel, which is meant to be a break from the routine.
* **C: Ukubona izindawo ezibalulekile:** While seeing important places *can* be part of recreational travel, it's not the defining characteristic. The focus is more on the *experience* of the place.
* **D: Ukuqonda umlando wendawo:**  Understanding history can be part of recreational travel (especially if it's considered ""learning about culture""), but it's not the core purpose described in the passage.

Yini eshiwo kulesi sigaba okuyinto enganciphisa uvalo lweshintso kumasonto asendaweni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukukhumbula ukuphumelela ekuziphatheni kahle kwezinto zamabhizinisi.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Izindaba ezinjalo zempumelelo zanciphisa ukwesaba ushintsho, zibe zenza ukuthambekela okuhle oshintshweni lwesikhathi esizayo.""  This directly links remembering past successes to reducing the fear of change and fostering a positive attitude towards the future.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ukuthola ulwazi kubantu abaqguqguzela isiko lequmbu:** While valuable, the passage focuses more on the *results* of understanding the past (successes and failures) rather than the process of learning *from* those who have adapted.
* **C: Ukuqapela ukuthola amandla kwaleqembu:**  While a positive outcome of understanding the past, it's not the direct method described for reducing fear of change.
* **D: Ukuqonda umlando kwaleliqembu:** Understanding the history is important, but the passage emphasizes how *specific stories of success* within that history are more effective in mitigating the fear of change.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuzuza umando womuntu kusiza kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukunciphisa uvalo loshintsho**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Izindaba ezinjalo zempumelelo zanciphisa ukwesaba ushintsho..."" which translates to ""Such stories of success reduced the fear of change...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuqiniso okubalulekeile:** While understanding history can offer valuable insights, the passage doesn't directly link it to ""ukuqiniso okubalulekeile"" (importance of truth).
* **C: Ukuthola ukunethezeka emhlanganweni:** The passage focuses on understanding the past to navigate the present and future, not on achieving organizational comfort.
* **D: Ukuthuthukisa ekuziphatheni kahle kwamabhizisi:**  The passage discusses organizational culture and adapting to change, not specifically about improving business conduct.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuqhaza kahle ngokunembile ipostmodern yokufunda?,"The correct answer is **D: Akukho umuntu ophelele ekufundeni (No one ever finishes learning)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the ongoing, fluid, and personalized nature of modern learning.** It states there's no single way to learn and that learning is a dynamic interaction between the learner and the information.
* **Option D directly reflects this idea of continuous learning.** The passage implies that learning is a lifelong process, not something that has a definitive end point.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ukufunda komakade ebona kuzuzisa kakhulu kunabanye (Traditional learning is more beneficial than others):** The passage *challenges* traditional learning by highlighting the diversity of modern approaches.
    * **B: Ukufunda kumelwe sigxile kulokho esinethemba lokuthi kuzokwenzeka (Learning should focus on what is hoped will happen):**  This is too narrow and doesn't capture the broader concept of learning for knowledge and understanding, not just for predicting outcomes.
    * **C: Izindlela zokufunda zingcono kunezinye (Some learning methods are better than others):** While the passage acknowledges different methods, it doesn't definitively state that some are *better*.  It focuses more on the value of diverse approaches.

**Postmodern thought often rejects grand narratives and embraces ambiguity, fragmentation, and the idea that knowledge is socially constructed and never fully complete.** Option D aligns best with this postmodern perspective.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo akuvezi kahle ngokunembile indlela yamanje yokufundisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ezinye izindlela zokufunda ezibalulekile kumelwe zibekwe kuqala kunezinye.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that there is no single ""right"" way to learn.** It highlights the importance of the relationship between the learner and the information. 
* Option B directly contradicts this core idea by suggesting that some learning methods are more important than others. The passage rejects the notion of a hierarchical structure in learning.

Let's look at why the other options are *supported* by the passage:

* **A: Zinengi izindlela zokufunda:** The passage explicitly states ""Akikho indlela eyodwa kuphela yokufunda"" (There is no single way to learn).
* **C: Isipilliyoni sokufunda sixomeke kumfundi nelwazi elinikezwayo:**  The passage says ""Ulwazi lethu esinalo lokuzenzela izinto nokukhuluma ngokwaziswa, izinhlelo zethelevishini ezisekelwe ekufundeni ziveza leli phuzu. Iningi lethu sizithola sibukele izinhlelo zethelevishini ezisitshela ngenqubo noma into eyenzekayo esingeke sihlanganyele kuyo noma sisebenzise lolo lwazi."" (Our knowledge is to do things for ourselves and speak with knowledge, television programs based on learning reveal this point. Many of us find ourselves watching television programs that tell us about a process or something that we cannot participate in or use that knowledge.) This shows the core relationship between learner and information.
* **D: Ulwazi olungeke silusebenzisa kuyafaneleka ukuba lifundiswe:** The passage indicates that the usefulness of the information is connected to its value. (""Ulwazi olungeke silusebenzisa kuyafaneleka ukuba lifundiswe"" reflects that knowledge is valuable when applied.)

Therefore, option B is the only statement that goes against the central message of the passage.

"Ngemva kokuvuka ngenhloso phakathi nesikhathi sokulala, ikuphi okulandelayo okuzophazamisa isimiso sokulala?","The correct answer is **C: Ukucisha i-alamu ephezu kwetafula, nokubuyela uyokulala ngemva kwemizuzu eyi-shumi nambili.**

Here's why:

* **The question describes intentional awakenings during sleep.** The prompt explains techniques to achieve this.
* **Option C directly follows the described scenario.**  If you've intentionally woken up, the next step is to turn off the alarm and try to return to sleep. Waiting for 12 minutes is a reasonable time to allow yourself to feel groggy and then attempt to go back to sleep.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ukufunda ihora nenxenye ngaphambi kokuba uyokulala (Reading the time and minute before bedtime):** This is counterproductive to the intentional awakening goal. It's something to avoid before trying to sleep.
    * **B: Ukuya endlini yangasese bese ubuyela ekulaleni (Going to the bathroom and then returning to sleep):** While a bathroom break *can* be part of an intentional awakening strategy, it's not the *immediate* next step after turning off the alarm. It's a possible action, but not the most logical.
    * **D: Ukuvuka uyophuza amanzi asebhodleni eliphezu kwetafula (Waking up and drinking water from a glass on the table):** Drinking water is *a* method for intentional awakening, but the question asks what happens *after* waking up intentionally with an alarm.

Therefore, option C is the most logical and direct continuation of the described intentional awakening process.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungaqondile okuchaza ukuphazamisa ukulala?,"The correct answer is **C: Lokhu kwenzeka ngesikhathi sokulala (This happens during sleep)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage directly states that sleep disruption involves interrupting the normal sleep cycle *during* sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ingasekelwa ku-biorhythm (It can be supported by biorhythms):** While biorhythms *might* influence sleep, the passage doesn't explicitly mention or support this connection.
*   **B: Umgomo akuwona ukuthi kumelwe uvuke ngokuphelele (The goal is not to wake up completely):** The passage specifically mentions the goal of a disruption is to wake up *and* become more alert, implying it's not just about waking up completely.
*   **D: Ngemva kokuvuka, umgomo ukuthi ulale phakathi kwamahora amabili (After waking up, the goal is to sleep for two hours):** The passage doesn't mention a specific sleep duration after waking up. It focuses on the disruption *during* sleep.



Therefore, option C is the only one that is directly and accurately supported by the information provided in the text."
"Njengoba igqondo izama ukuveza amaphupho ngendlela ecacile, kuphakama ini?","The correct answer is **D: Isikhathi esiphakathi kweREM states**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the belief that frequent lucid dreaming is linked to increased problem-solving is due to the effects of lucid dreams increasing the duration of REM sleep.  It then says, ""This effect depends on how much the mind tries to dream each night.""  This implies that the *duration* of REM sleep is what changes.  

The question asks when it increases. The passage directly links this increase to the ""time between REM states"".  The mind is trying to *maintain* the dream state for longer, which is achieved by extending the time spent in REM.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Inani le-REM states:** The passage doesn't mention an increase in the *number* of REM states, only the duration.
*   **B: Amazinga wamandla:**  The passage doesn't discuss levels of energy.
*   **C: Isikhathi sokululama:** While sleep time is related, the passage focuses specifically on REM sleep and its duration, not overall sleep time.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungalimaza ukucacisa amaphupho emzimbeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuncishiswa kweREM ngobusuku** (Decrease in REM sleep at night).

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent lucid dreaming is linked to longer REM periods.  If REM sleep is *decreased*, then the conditions that lead to frequent lucid dreaming are less likely to occur. Therefore, a decrease in REM sleep would hinder clear dream recall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikunciphisa kwesikhathi phakathi kweREM states** (Decrease in the time between REM states): The passage doesn't mention the relationship between the time between REM states and lucid dreaming.
*   **C: Ukuthembela emaphuphweni acazwe kahle** (Belief in well-defined dreams): This is about belief, not physical mechanisms of dream clarity.
*   **D: Ukungezelela kweREM ngobusuku** (Increase in REM at night): The passage directly connects *increased* REM sleep to frequent lucid dreaming.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, afana ngani amaqembu ahlangana ngokoqobo nalawa ahlangana kuzinto zokuxhumana?","The correct answer is **A: Amaqembu amabili alindele ukuthi adlale ngokwezinga elifanayo**

Here's why:

The text states that computer teams often function as a communication space for close-knit members of a real team. It also mentions they often have a high degree of independence compared to regular team members. This suggests a level playing field and a sense of equality *within* the computer team. While the computer team's activities might be independent of official schedules, the underlying expectation is likely that members operate with a similar level of autonomy and contribution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amaqembu amabil anamazinga ahlukahlukene wokuzimela usuku nosuku:** The text actually says the *computer* teams have high independence, not that there's variation in independence between the two types of teams.
* **C: Amaqembu amabili abika kumphathi abangaziwa:** The text implies that the computer teams' activities might not be understood by *official* authorities, but not that they report to unknown managers.
* **D: Amaqembu amabili asebenza ezikhathini ezifanayo:** The text indicates the computer teams operate independently of official schedules.

"Ngokuya kwalesi siqephu, ikuphi okuveziwe okungelona iqiniso mayelana namaqembu abonana ngokoqobo nalawa ahlangaza ezinkundleni zokuxhumana?","The correct answer is **C: Amaqembu ahlangana ngokoqobo ukuzimela kwayo kuncani kunalawo ahlangana esinkundleni zokuxhumana.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that computer groups *often* have a higher degree of independence than traditional groups. This is because they can meet at various times and locations, which might not be easily understood or controlled by local authorities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amaqembu ahlangana ngokoqobo imihlangano yabo isezingeni eliphezulu** - The text doesn't mention anything about the frequency of meetings for traditional groups.
*   **B: Amaqembu ahlangana kwezokuxhumana ayisisekelo sokuxhumana nalawo ahlangana ngokoqobo** - The text implies that online groups *are* a form of connection, not that they are *not* a basis for connection.
*   **D: Ukuhluka kwezikhathi kungazuzisa amaqembu ahlangana ezinkundleni zokuxhumana** - While the text mentions that the ability to meet at various times and locations is a characteristic of online groups, it doesn't directly say that the difference in time *creates* or *benefits* them. It simply states it's a feature.

Ikuphi okulandelayo okubonisa ukuthi okuqukhethwe imibono akuxilanga kulokhu?,"The correct answer is **A: Izifiso ezintsha ezithuthuka phakathi nobudala**.

Here's why:

The passage describes theories that focus on internal drives and needs as motivators. The core idea is that these needs evolve and change over time. Option A directly reflects this evolution, stating that new desires develop as people age. This contradicts the notion that needs are fixed or solely based on initial conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Kubonisa ukuthi okuzungeze umuntu kungathinta izinto zakhe:** While external factors *can* influence behavior, the passage primarily focuses on internal motivators. This option touches on external influence, but it's not the central point being challenged.
*   **C: Izidingo zangaphakathi:** This is essentially a restatement of the passage's premise. It doesn't challenge the core idea.
*   **D: Ukuqonda ukuthi abantu bathandani:**  This relates to emotional understanding, but again, doesn't challenge the central focus on internal needs and desires as primary motivators.

**Therefore, option A is the only one that highlights a shift in needs over time, directly questioning the potential limitations of the ideas presented in the passage.**



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungewona umthetho wesihloko sesithathu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukwenza ukuphila namandla esithombeni**.

Here's why:

The question describes the ""Rule of Thirds"" in photography, focusing on composition and creating a visually appealing image. The core principles of the Rule of Thirds are:

* **Creating a strong focal point:**  The main subject is often placed at the intersection of the lines created by dividing the frame into thirds.
* **Balance:**  Using the thirds grid helps create a balanced composition.
* **Leading lines:**  The lines within the thirds grid can be used to guide the viewer's eye.
* **Whitespace:**  Leaving space around the subject can enhance the image.

Option B, ""Ukwenza ukuphila namandla esithombeni"" (Creating life and energy in the frame), is a more general artistic principle, but not a specific rule *of thirds*.  While the Rule of Thirds can contribute to a sense of energy, it doesn't directly address it.

The other options *are* elements of the Rule of Thirds:

* **A: Ukwakha isisekelo sokuthi isihloko sizohlala kuphi (Building a foundation of where the subject will be):** The Rule of Thirds helps you decide where to place your subject.
* **C: Ukugcina isihloko endaweni ekhethekile nesebenzayo (Keeping the subject in a special and functional place):**  This refers to placing the subject at an intersection of the lines.
* **D: Ukuba nohleleka esithombeni (Having order in the frame):** The Rule of Thirds creates a structured, ordered frame.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungacazi i-35mm esithombeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Ifomethi ejwayelekile emhlabeni**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngokwesibonelo, indlela evamile kakhulu yohlobo lwesithombe emhlabeni ingu-35mm..."" (For example, the most common type of film format in the world is 35mm...). This directly answers the question of where the 35mm format is commonly found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isenziwa (It's made):** While the passage mentions it's still used today, the format itself isn't *made* in the context of the question.
* **B: Yayithathwe indela ethile yekhamera (It was taken in a certain camera way):** The passage connects the format to camera design and the relationship between size and photography, but doesn't say it's specifically *taken* in a particular way.
* **C: Inesilinganiselo esihlukile kunamanye amafomethi (It has a different ratio than other formats):** The passage says it *resembles* the 3:2 ratio, not that it's fundamentally different.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, njengoba abenzi bamalensi bakhuphula izinga layo, amalensi asondeza izinto eduze athuthukiswe njani?","The correct answer is **A: Ijubane lamalensi liphezulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isici esilahlekelisayo sezibuko zokukhulisa ukuthi ukuphica kwefokasi nesibalo sezici zezibuko ezidingekayo ukufinyelela ububanzi bobude befokasi bukhulu kakhulu kunezibuko ezisemqoka.

Lokhu kwenza amalensi angabizi kakhulu ka-zoom angasebenziseki kalula endaweni enokukhanya okuncane ngaphandle kwesibani.""

This passage implies that as lens makers improved magnification, they had to increase the focal length to achieve greater zoom capabilities.  Therefore, ""Ijubane lamalensi liphezulu"" (lens speed is higher) is the most accurate inference.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Alula ukuwasebenzisa ezimweni eziphansi kakhulu:** The passage states lenses are *difficult* to use in low light without a flash. This is the opposite of what's suggested in the options.
* **C: Izinga lesithombe liyafana namalensi anokugxila okulungisiwe:**  The passage doesn't mention image quality or similarity to corrected lenses.
* **D: Anokugxila okuphansi kunamalensi ahamba phambili:** While this *can* be true of some lenses, the main focus of the passage is on magnification and focal length. This isn't the core point.



"
"Ngokuya kwalemininigwane elapha esigabeni, kunini lapho ilensi esondezayo ukusetshenjiswa kunama lensi aphuma phambili?","The correct answer is **C: Mawungafuni ukusebenzisa i-flash ezindaweni ezimnyama.**

Here's why:

The text states that zoom lenses often have a smaller aperture (less light-gathering ability) than prime lenses. This means they struggle in low-light conditions and require a flash. Therefore, if you want to avoid using a flash in a dark environment, a prime lens (fixed focal length) is the better option because it allows for a wider aperture and better light gathering.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Uma kuyimfuneko ukuba ileni ivuleke kakhulu:** While a wider aperture is good, prime lenses are not *always* wider than zoom lenses. It depends on the specific lenses.
*   **B: Mawufuna izakhi zamalensi amancani:** This is irrelevant to the comparison between prime and zoom lenses.
*   **D: Mawufuna ukugxile okunengi ekunkimbinkimbini:** This is also irrelevant to the choice between prime and zoom lenses. Focal length is more important for depth of field than the lens type.

Ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kunembe ekuchazeni i-Mysticism?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukugcizelela ekufuneni okuhlangabezane nakho komuntu siqu kungafaniswa nezinye izindlela zezenkolelo nokukhulukela.**

Here's why:

* **The definition of Mysticism emphasizes the pursuit of direct experience of the transcendent.** It's about *personal* realization of the divine or ultimate reality.
* **Option D suggests that this personal pursuit is *similar* to other religious paths.**  While mystics might *also* have religious backgrounds, the core of mysticism isn't about fitting into existing religious frameworks or being comparable. It's about the individual's direct encounter.
* **The other options align with the definition:**
    * **A:** Mysticism *does* involve seeking a state of inner peace and beauty.
    * **B:** Mystics *do* seek spiritual truth.
    * **C:** Mystics *do* use practices to cultivate higher spiritual awareness.



Therefore, option D is the outlier because it incorrectly implies mysticism is comparable to other religions in its approach to the personal, transcendent experience. It misses the crucial point of individual, direct experience that defines mysticism.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona ukugxilisa kwiMysticism?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuphishekela ulwazi ngokwabelana, okuhlangabezane nakho kokwabelana.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Mysticism as focused on direct experience and understanding of the divine, spiritual truth, or God.**  It emphasizes inner experience and transformative practices.

Let's look at why the other options *are* aligned with Mysticism:

* **A: Ukufuna muzwa kwezinto zaphezulu ezenzeka ngempela:** This aligns perfectly. Mysticism is about experiencing the higher realms.
* **C: Ukucizelela kokuhle komkhumbulo:**  Mystical practices often involve meditation and mindfulness, which enhance memory and awareness.
* **D: Ukuphishekela kokwaziswa kokuqaphela uNkulunkulu:** This speaks directly to a desire to connect with and understand God, a core element of Mysticism.

* **B: Ukuphishekela ulwazi ngokwabelana, okuhlangabezane nakho kokwabelana:**  While sharing experiences *can* happen within mystical communities, the core focus of Mysticism isn't primarily on sharing information or knowledge. It's about *personal* direct experience.  The passage doesn't emphasize the social aspect of sharing knowledge, but rather the individual's journey towards mystical understanding.



Therefore, option B is the one that deviates most from the description of Mysticism in the provided text.

Umcabango wakha umbono wokuthi abantu bama-Maori basuke ePholinesiya ngeMikhumbi Eminingi futhi bathathela ama-Mariori iNyuzilandi, bamisa umphakathi wokulima.""

This directly indicates the initial belief was that Maori arrived from Polynesia and established agriculture in New Zealand. Option C reflects this initial belief.

The later part of the text refutes the initial theory, but the question asks *according to the paragraph* who initially established agriculture.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iqembu elazingela imoas bebabuya kuyiphi indawo?","The correct answer is **B: i-New Zealand**.

The passage states: ""Isikhathi eside phakathi namakhulu eminyaka eshumi nesishiyagalolunye kanye namashumi amabili, bekukholelwa ukuthi abahlali bokuqala baseNyuzilandi abantu baseMaori, ababezingela izinyoni ezinkulu ezibizwa ngama-moa."" This directly indicates that the first inhabitants of New Zealand who hunted the moa were the Maori.
"
Isiphi isimo esingavumela indlela ye-origamu yePureland izuzise ifolda?,"The correct answer is **D: Ifolda ikuzamile kanye noma kabili lokho.**

Here's why:

The description states that Pureland origami is designed for beginners or those with limited mobility. It emphasizes simple, direct folds and prohibits complex maneuvers like reverse folds. Therefore, if a folder has tried something once or twice and *failed* to execute it, it aligns with the purpose of Pureland origami: to allow for repetition and learning without requiring advanced skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ifolda ithanda ukwenza amafolda amanengi ngesikhi sinye:** While repetition is allowed, the ability to do many folds in one go doesn't directly relate to the core principle of simplicity and ease of learning in Pureland origami.
*   **B: Ifolda seyithuthuke ngendlela yokuthi inekhona njengemoto:** This is irrelevant to the folding method or the principles of Pureland origami.
*   **C: Ifolda iyenza i-origami le edinga ukuhlehllisa kwe-folds:** This is the opposite of what Pureland origami is designed for. It explicitly *avoids* complex folds.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile iPureland origami?,"The correct answer is **A: Iyenzelwe okuhlangane nakho kwamafolda**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""I-Pureland origami i-origami onokukhawulelwa kokuthi ukusonga okukodwa kuphela kungenziwa ngesikhathi, okunye ukusonga okuyinkimbinkimbi njengokusongela emuva akuvunyelwe, futhi konke ukusonga kunezindawo eziqondile."" This means the limitation of only using valley folds is a core characteristic.
* **The other options align with the text:**
    * **B: Lendlela ayinayo ukuhlehliswa kwamafolds:** The text emphasizes the *direct* nature of folds, implying no complex curves or embellishments.
    * **C: Amafolds kumelwe abe nezindawo eziqondile:** This is directly stated in the text.
    * **D: Indlela efanelekile yamafolda okunekhona elincani lwezimoto:**  While not directly mentioned, the simplicity and focus on basic folds would naturally result in a limited number of elements.

Therefore, the statement that Pureland origami is designed for assembling folders is the *least* accurate description based on the provided text. The focus is on the *method* of folding, not the final assembled object.



"
"Ngokuya kwamomusho, iyiphi indawo engahlanganisiwe ne-Indus Valley Civilization?","The correct answer is **C: Zonke izindawo ezise-nyakatho-mpumalanga zaseAfghanistan**.

Here's why:

The passage states the Indus Valley Civilization encompassed ""zinye izinkolo entshonalanga nyakatho Ndiya nasempumalanga nyakatho Afghanistan."" This means that the civilization's geographical area extended into the regions of modern-day Afghanistan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: i-Harappa:** Harappa is mentioned as the first site excavated, but the civilization was larger than just Harappa.
*   **B: i-Sarasvati River:** While the civilization may have existed in the Sarasvati River area initially, the passage focuses on the Indus River as the primary defining feature and source of the civilization's name.
*   **D: Okunengi okwamanje kwaPakistan:** While a significant portion of the civilization was in present-day Pakistan, the passage also explicitly mentions parts of Afghanistan.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungashiwongo okungekhe kube ithuba legama leBronze Age Civilization okukhulunywe ngakho esigabeni?,"The correct answer is **C: i-Indus River Civilization**.

Here's why:

* **i-Harappan Civilization:** The text explicitly mentions this as the civilization being initially named after the Harappa archaeological site.
* **i-Indus-Sarasvati Civilization:** The text suggests this is another valid name, referring to the civilization's presence in both the Indus River valley and the Sarasvati River area.
* **i-Indus Valley Civilization:** This is a very common and widely accepted name for the civilization, accurately describing its location.
* **i-Indus River Civilization:** While the civilization was located along the Indus River, the term ""Indus River Civilization"" is too broad and doesn't fully capture the extent and complexity of the civilization, nor the potential importance of the Sarasvati River. The other options are more specific and commonly used to refer to this particular Bronze Age civilization.

Therefore, ""i-Indus River Civilization"" is the least accurate and most likely unmentioned term in the context of the provided paragraph."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo kumelela into ezuzisayo yesikhathi eside?","The correct answer is **A: Ukusebenzisana nabanye**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ubugovu kanye nomhawu kuzohlala nathi ngaso sonke isikhathi futhi kuba khona lapho sifuna ukusebenzisana, lapho kuzuza khona abaningi kuzohlale kunokuningi ongakuzuza ngesikhathi esifushane ngokuba nomhawu."" 

This directly translates to: ""Pride and arrogance will always be with us and are where we want to collaborate, where getting more will always be better than getting a lot in a short time by being arrogant."" This implies that collaborating with others leads to long-term gains.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukubeka kuqala isifiso zakho:** The passage is against prioritizing oneself (arrogance/pride).
* **C: Ukuqizelela ukuthi yikuphi okungazuzisa abantu abancani kunabuntu abanegi:** The passage says the opposite - that collaborating with others leads to more gains.
* **D: Ukuqaphela ukuhaha ungazuzisa kakhulu:** The passage warns against arrogance and pride (uhaha).



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi umuntu angakubeka kuqala uma ukugxila kwakhe kusezintweni angazizuza ngesikhathi esifushane?","The correct answer is **A: Umhawu**.

The passage states: ""lapho kuzuza khona abaningi kuzohlale kunokuningi ongakuzuza ngesikhathi esifushane ngokuba nomhawu."" This translates to ""where you gain more will always be more than what you can gain in a short time by being ambitious/having drive."" This implies that the passage suggests prioritizing **umhawu (ambition/drive)** over the other options, especially if the goal is quick gains.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukusebenzisana nabanye (Collaborating with others):** The passage says collaboration is beneficial in the long run, but not necessarily the first priority for quick gains.
*   **C: Ukubambisana (Partnership):** Similar to collaboration, partnership is presented as a longer-term benefit.
*   **D: Ubugovu (Pride/Arrogance):** The passage suggests that relying on pride is not the best strategy.

Therefore, the passage advocates for **umhawu (ambition/drive)** when focused on quick gains."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owakhokhela izindleko zempi?","The correct answer is **D: Abantu baseFilipino**.

The passage states: ""Izindleko zempi zobukhosi baseMelika lapho inqoba iPhilippines zakhokhelwa abantu basePhilippines ngokwabo."" (The cost of the US colonial war that conquered the Philippines was paid by the Filipinos themselves.)

While the US government benefited and Wall Street banks were involved, the burden of payment fell on the Filipino people.
"
Isiphi isikhathi esafika ngaphambi kweminyaka yeTemplars?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekuqaleni kweminyaka yeMiddle Ages**.

The text states that the High Middle Ages (when the Templars existed) is *preceded* by the Early Middle Ages. Therefore, the Early Middle Ages occurred earlier.
"
Isiphi isikhathi esafika ngemva kweTemplars?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngasekupheleni kwemiyaka yeMiddle Ages**.

The text states that the High Middle Ages (when the Templars existed) ended around 1500, and the Middle Ages generally ended around that time as well.  Therefore, the time period *after* the Templars would be the late Middle Ages.
"
Ikuphi ukulashwa okungavezwanga okwasetshenjiswa abodokotela banahlinzi ngesikhathi sombuso wamaRoma?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukulapha ukugcindezeleka kwangemva kokuhlukumezeka ngokusebenzisa imithi ezihlukahlukene elalisayo**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions the Romans using morphine and scopolamine for pain relief.
* It also highlights their ability to identify body parts to save patients from gangrene and use arterial clamps to restore blood flow.
* While the passage discusses various medical advancements, it *doesn't* mention using various herbs for post-traumatic pain relief.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuthatha izinto ezithethwe embewini yeherbane ukulapha iscopolamine:**  This is mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Ukugijima kwegazi okuhambisana ne-arterial clamps:** This is explicitly mentioned as a Roman advancement.
* **D: Ukusika kwezitho kunamabantu abanesifo sokubola kwezitho:** This is explicitly mentioned as a Roman advancement.



Therefore, the only option that represents a medical practice *not* mentioned in the passage is the use of herbs for post-traumatic pain relief.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okungeke kwanikelwa udomo ekuthuthukiseni ezokwelapha ngesikhathi sokubuso amaRoma?","The correct answer is **A: Indlela izidumbu esibekwangayo kwezokwelapha (The way corpses were arranged in medical practices)**.

Here's why:

* The passage focuses on the *advancements* made in medicine during the Roman Empire. It highlights things like the use of pain relievers (morphine, scopolamine), surgical techniques (amputation, tourniquets, clamps), and the establishment of a medical corps.
* The passage *doesn't* mention anything about how corpses were handled or arranged in medical practices. The other options are directly mentioned or implied as contributing factors:
    * **B: Umthetho wombuso onamandla onamasosha (The strong imperial law with the army):** The passage states the medical corps was established *after* wars, implying imperial law and the army played a role.
    * **C: Indlela okufundwa ngayo ezibhedlela (The way hospitals were taught):** The passage mentions the establishment of a medical corps, suggesting a system of training and teaching existed.
    * **D: Indlela Inkosi eqasha ngayo abodokotela (The way the emperor appointed doctors):** The passage says the emperor established the medical corps, so appointment procedures would have been involved.

Therefore, the only option not directly supported by the passage's claims of medical advancement is the handling of corpses.



"
"Ingabe ukubona, noma ukukwazi ukubona kuncike kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Uhlelo lwezinzwa zokubona noma amehlo**.

The first sentence of the passage directly states: ""Ukubona, noma ukukwazi ukubona kuncike ohlelweni lwezinzwa zokubona noma amehlo.""  The rest of the paragraph elaborates on the differences in eye structures and their capabilities, but the fundamental basis of sight depends on either the visual system or the auditory system.
"
Ukwakheka kweso kwezinto ezizizungezile ezincani zixhomeke kuphi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuhlukahluka kokwakheka kwezinto ezincani**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states that different eye structures have different capabilities and are sensitive to different wavelengths of light.  This implies that the *structure* of the eye is what dictates how it perceives things.
* Option D, ""Ukuhlukahluka kokwakheka kwezinto ezincani"" (Diversity of the structure of things) directly aligns with this idea. The diversity in eye structures leads to the diversity in how they perceive things.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ukuzwela kwe-wavelength (Sensitivity to wavelength):** While wavelength is *involved* in vision, the text emphasizes the physical *structure* as the foundation. Sensitivity to wavelength is a *result* of the structure, not the underlying cause.
* **B: Izinto ezidengekayo ezincani (Small details):**  The text doesn't focus on small details specifically, but rather on the general structure and its impact on perception.
* **C: Izinga lokuhluka (Degree of differentiation):**  While differentiation is important, the core focus is on the different *structures* themselves.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, isiphi isitatimende isikhuluma ngoSikhism esingaqondanga esiveza inkolo?","The correct answer is **D: Amasiko athile weSikhism anezimpande ezisuka kuHinduism.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ama-Sikh athatha ukholo lwawo njengenkolo ehlukile kubuHindu nakuba evuma umsuka wabo wobuHindu namasiko.""  This directly confirms that some Sikh customs have roots in Hinduism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: iSikhism bokuyisizathu kwakuyisizathu sokuhlukana phakathi kwesintu yesiHindu:** While the passage mentions a split in Hindu society, it doesn't say Sikhism *caused* that split. It says they took their faith as distinct.
* **B: Umfundisi wesiHindu uyena muntu obalulekile nohlukile weSikhism:** The passage emphasizes the importance of the *Guru* (teacher) in Sikhism, particularly Guru Nanak, but it doesn't claim a Hindu teacher is uniquely important or distinct. It focuses on the Sikh Guru.
* **C: Abafundisi besiHindu abayisishagalolunye balandela ngemva komsunguli wenkolo, Mfundii uNanak:** The passage states that *other* Gurus followed Guru Nanak, but it doesn't mention Hindu teachers following him.



"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, ikuphi okulandelayo okucatshangelwa ukuthi umgogotla wokukholwa kweSikh?","The correct answer is **C: Ukunqaba ukwazisa ezinye izinkolo zamaIndiya**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the Sikhs considered their faith a distinct religion from Hinduism, even while acknowledging their Hindu origins and customs. 
* The text highlights the importance of the Guru (teacher) in Sikhism, a crucial element in their belief system.
*  Option C, ""Ukunqaba ukwazisa ezinye izinkolo zamaIndiya"" (Rejecting/Ignoring other Indian religions) best reflects the Sikhs' deliberate separation and distinct identity from Hinduism as described in the passage.  The passage emphasizes their belief in a separate path (Gurmat).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uqondo womfundi wesiHindu (The concept of a Hindu Guru):** The text acknowledges the role of the Guru but stresses that it's a *distinctly* important element *within* the Sikh faith, not a continuation of the Hindu concept.
* **B: Isiko lamaHindu (Hindu customs):** While the Sikhs adopted some Hindu customs, the passage emphasizes that they were not a defining feature of their *distinct* faith.
* **D: Ukukhuluma ulwimi lwesiPunjabi (Speaking the Punjabi language):**  The passage mentions that Punjabi is the language of the Gurus, making it important to Sikhism, but not the core belief system itself.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, abantwana abanenkinga yokuzwa bangakuthola kunzima ukuxila kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Umsebenzi wesikole**.

The text states: ""Izingane ezine-ADD zibhekana nobunzima uma kufanele ukuthi zibhekane nemisebenzi yazo yesikole..."" which translates to ""Children with ADD struggle when they have to face their schoolwork...""
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani abantwana abanenkinga wokuzwa bangaze bazifake enkinga yokuziphatha okuyingozi?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuququzela izinqgondo zabo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lezi zingane zizithola zisobishini ngenxa ”yokuzigaxa ekuziphatheni okuyingozi, ziyalwa, zilwisana nabasegunyeni” ukuze nje zishukumise izingqondo zazo, njengoba izingqondo zazo zingashukunyiswa ngezindlela ezivamile.""

This indicates that children with ADD act out to stimulate their minds because their minds aren't stimulated in typical ways.  Therefore, they are trying to **seek stimulation** and engage their minds, which leads to risky behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukunciphisa ukunyakaza kakhulu:** The text describes *excessive* restlessness, not a lack of it.
* **B: Ukubasiza ukuba bakwazi ukwakha ubungani nontanga yabo:** The text says ADD *hinders* social relationships.
* **C: Ukunaka okumelwe kubuye kubazali:** The text doesn't mention parental expectations as a cause of risky behavior.



"
"Ngokuya kwalemininigwane kulesi sigaba, yikuphi okulandelayo okungekona isibonelo se-scaffolding?","The correct answer is **C: Uhlelo oluzimele lokufundisa (A self-paced learning program)**.

Here's why:

* **Scaffolding** provides temporary support to learners as they tackle a task. It's designed to be gradually removed as the learner gains proficiency.

Let's look at why the other options *are* examples of scaffolding:

* **A: Okokufundisa ekuqaleni kwegame yekhompuyutha (Tutorials at the beginning of a computer game):** Tutorials offer step-by-step guidance, helping new players learn the game's mechanics – a form of support.
* **B: Uthisha weSAT (SAT Teacher):** A teacher provides direct instruction, clarifies concepts, and offers feedback – all scaffolding techniques.
* **D: Umqeqeshi we-league yabancani (Help coach of the assistant league):**  A coach provides guidance, support, and feedback to help players improve – a form of scaffolding.

* **C: Uhlelo oluzimele lokufundisa (A self-paced learning program):**  This program *aims* for independence. Scaffolding, by definition, provides *support*. A self-paced program, while helpful, doesn't inherently offer the temporary, fading support that characterizes scaffolding. It assumes the learner will progress without direct, temporary assistance.



Therefore, a self-paced learning program doesn't fit the definition of scaffolding.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokuqondile umbono we- scaffolding?,"The correct answer is **A: IScaffolds iyakhona ezinkundleni zokuxhumana** (Scaffolding exists on social media).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that scaffolding is *not* about social media.** It describes scaffolding as a support structure for learning, making complex tasks easier. Social media is unrelated to this concept.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the passage:

* **B: Icebo kakhulu kunensiza kufundisa** (It's much more helpful than teaching). The passage argues that scaffolding *enhances* learning beyond simply teaching, providing support and guidance.
* **C: Iyaziwa ngokuthi uhlelo oluthile lokufundisa** (It's known as a specific learning program).  The passage clarifies that scaffolds can be both physical and digital, embedded within software.
* **D: AmaScaffolds asetshenjiselwa ukusekela ukufundeni kwasekuqaleni** (Scaffolds are used to support early learning).  The passage emphasizes scaffolding is for helping learners tackle new and challenging tasks, particularly when starting something new.



Therefore, option A is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iMySpace ingabasiza njani abafundi laba abakuthola kunzima ukufunda?","The correct answer is **C: IWeb address eyodwa (A Web address)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ingahlelwa ngokuqokwa ukuyenza ifundeke kalula futhi ngemibala iminingi noma emincane njengoba umuntu ethanda. Ingahlelwa ngokuqokwa ukuyenza ifundeke kalula futhi ngemibala iminingi noma emincane njengoba umuntu ethanda.""  and ""okwenza kube lula ukulikhumbula futhi kube lula nokulibhala kubafundi okungenzeka babe nenkinga yokusebenzisa ikhibhodi noma yesipelingi"".  This refers to the ease of access provided by a single web address.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukushintsha into esimwesayo uyise ezingeni eliphezulu (Converting something to a higher level):** The passage doesn't mention anything about transforming learning to a higher level.
* **B: amaBlogs (Blogs):** While blogs are a feature, the passage doesn't explain how blogs specifically help students with learning difficulties.
* **D: amaphrofayili angaba amamiliyoni ayi-54 (Profiles that can be millions):** The sheer number of profiles isn't directly related to helping students who find learning difficult. It just highlights the popularity of the platform.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo bekungekona ukusabela kwakaiKrushchev esitelekeni?","The correct answer is **C: Khuphula umholo (Raise wages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Krushchev *initially* sent troops to suppress the protests and *then* allowed some economic concessions, including potentially allowing for the raising of wages. However, the question asks what was *not* part of his response.  The passage explicitly mentions the troops and allowing economic concessions, but it *doesn't* say he initially raised wages.  In fact, the context suggests he was responding to demands for better wages *by* suppressing the protests.

Let's look at why the other options *were* part of his response:

*   **A: Ukukhethe ugqongqoshe omusha (Choosing a new minister):** Krushchev allowed Gomulka, a popular figure, to become the new leader, essentially a change in government.
*   **B: Sebenzisa izimoto ezinkulu zempi ukugcina ukuhleleka (Using military force to maintain order):**  The passage states Krushchev sent troops to suppress the protests.
*   **D: Cabangela izicelo zomnotho (Granting economic demands):** The passage indicates Krushchev eventually allowed for some economic concessions.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo bekungeyona imbangela yesiteleka sasePoland?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukukhethwa kukaWladyslaw Gomulka**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the protests were sparked by **food shortages and wage cuts** (B and C).
* The protests evolved into opposition to **Communism** (A).
* While Gomulka was a popular figure, the passage says Krushchev initially sent in troops *to suppress* him.  Gomulka's eventual appointment happened *after* the protests had already escalated. Therefore, his appointment wasn't a *cause* of the protests; it was a *consequence* of them.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kumoshe ubudlelwane phakathi neUSSR neUSA?","The correct answer is **B: Imibono ngeGermany**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that differences in ideology, systems, and culture *led* to the countries becoming enemies.** This directly connects to options A and C.
* **The passage mentions the Cold War lasting for 40 years and involving numerous conflicts globally.** This implies that disagreements over various geopolitical issues were a constant source of tension.
* **However, the passage *doesn't* specifically mention disagreements about Germany.** While Germany was a significant factor in post-WWII geopolitics, the passage focuses on the broader ideological and systemic differences that fueled the Cold War.  Therefore, it's the least directly supported by the text.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungacazi ngokuqondile injongo yenzinzwa yokuthumela ama-impulse emzimbeni wonke?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukwehlisa ukuhamba kwegazi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the purpose is to maintain uninterrupted blood circulation and protect the body from harm.**  This directly relates to maintaining a stable internal environment (homeostasis) and responding to threats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukulawula ukugeleza kwegazi:** While the system *influences* blood circulation, the passage focuses on *maintaining* it, not directly *controlling* it in the sense of adjusting blood flow to specific areas.
* **C: Ukulawula i-homeostasis:** This is a good answer because maintaining stable circulation *is* a key component of homeostasis. However, the question asks for what is *not directly* stated.
* **D: Ukubalekela izinto ezingalimaza umzimba:** The passage says the system helps the body *stay safe* from harm, but doesn't explicitly state that its purpose is to *flee* from dangers.  It's more about defense and maintaining a stable internal state.

Therefore, reducing blood flow is the opposite of what the system aims to do.



"
Yini etholakala kuGiza Plateau?,"The correct answer is **C: Okungamazayo okuyisikhombisa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""IThafa Eliphakeme laseGiza, noma “iGiza Necropolis” eSigodini sabaFile saseGibhithe linemibhoshongo emingxa-ntathu eminingana (leyo umbhoshongo omkhulu kuyiwo omkhulu kakhulu), amathuna amaningana amancane, amathempeli amaningana, kanye ne-Sphinx enkulu.""

This means the Giza Plateau contains a collection of monuments (okungamazayo okuyisikhombisa). While the other options are *part* of what's found there, ""monuments"" is the broadest and most accurate description of the overall content of the plateau, encompassing the pyramids, tombs, temples, and Sphinx.



"
Kwakuyini injongo yeGreat Pyramid?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlonipha uPharoah**.

The text explicitly states: ""IPhiramidi eliKhulu ngelinye lezakhiwo zamaphiramidi ezakhelwe ukuhlonipha uFaro oshonile."" This translates to ""The Great Pyramid is one of the pyramid structures built to honor the revered Pharaoh.""
"
Umthwalo wemfanelo kabani ukuze sazi ukuthi i-arsonist iyamosha ithempeli?,"The correct answer is **A: Abase Efesu**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ithempeli lika-Athemisi e-Efesu labhujiswa ngoJulayi 21, 356, BCE esenzweni sokuthungela ngomlilo esenzwe u-Herostratus. Ngokwendaba, okwakumshukumisa kwakuwukuthola udumo kumnyama kubomvu. **Abase-Efesu, bethukuthele begane unwabu, bamemezela ukuthi igama likaHerostratus lingagcinwa ngokubhalwa.**""

This clearly indicates that the people of Ephesus were the ones who decided to immortalize Herostratus's name, which is the basis of the legend surrounding his arson.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: uAlexander Omkhulu:** He requested funding to rebuild the temple, but his request was denied. He didn't cause the arson or immortalize the arsonist's name.
* **C: uStrabo:** He wrote down Herostratus's name, but he didn't initiate the legend or decide to make the arsonist famous. He simply recorded information.
* **D: uArtemis:** Artemis was the goddess the temple was dedicated to. She wasn't involved in the arson or the naming of the arsonist.



"
Isiphi isitatimende esiqondile mayelana nokukwakhiwa kabusha kwethempeli likaArtemis?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwakhiwa kabusha ngemva kokubusa kwakaAlexander Omkhulu.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""njengemva kokuba u-Alexander efile, ithempeli lakhiwa kabusha ngo-323 BCE."" This clearly indicates the temple was rebuilt *after* Alexander the Great's death.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukwakhiwa kabusha kwakhokhelwa uAlexander Omkhulu:** While Alexander *requested* funding for the rebuilding, the text says his request was denied.
* **C: UHerostratus watshelwa ukuba akhokhele izindleko zokwakhiwa kabusha:** The text implies the people of Ephesus were angry with Herostratus and wanted his name erased, not that he was held financially responsible.
* **D: Kwakhiwa kabusha ngo320 BCE:** The text explicitly states it was rebuilt in 323 BCE.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kwakukuni lapho izilwane zaqala ukuhamba ngezinyawo ezimbil?","The correct answer is **A: Iminyaka eyisigidi yesikhombisa eyadlula.**

The text states: ""nakuba ama-Sahelanthropus kungenzeka ayehamba ngezinyawo ezimbili ngaphambili kakhulu eminyakeni eyizigidi eziyisikhombisa edlule."" (even though *Sahelanthropus* may have walked on two legs much earlier, approximately 6 million years ago.)
"
Hlobo luni lwezilwane ezahamba ngezinyawo ezimbili?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Sahelanthropus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nakuba ama-Sahelanthropus kungenzeka ayehamba ngezinyawo ezimbili ngaphambili kakhulu eminyakeni eyizigidi eziyisikhombisa edlule."" This directly indicates that *Sahelanthropus* is a species that likely walked on two legs.

While *Homo Erectus* and *Australopithecus* also walked bipedally, the passage specifically mentions *Sahelanthropus* as potentially doing so much earlier. The option ""Ukusebenza ngezilwane ezinezinyawo ezimbili"" is too general.
"
Ibutho lamasosha aselwandle azama ukwenzani ngesikhathi seWWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuvimba abantu nezimpahla ukuze zingayi eBrithani.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the German U-boat fleet's primary goal was to **prevent** the Allies (specifically the Americans) from transporting people and supplies across the Atlantic to Britain.
* Option A is partially correct (it does involve preventing supplies), but doesn't include the people aspect, which is also crucial to the passage's description of the German effort.
* Options C and D are incorrect because the passage focuses solely on the Atlantic crossing between the US and Britain, and doesn't mention transporting supplies across the entire Atlantic or preventing transport to the US.



"
"Ngokuya kwalemniningwane enikeziwe esigabeni, ubani owaphumelela kangcono empini yaseNyakatho Atlantic Campaign?","The correct answer is **D: iBritish**.

The text states that the Allies (including Britain and the US) were trying to transport people and supplies across the Atlantic to help Britain, while the German U-boats were trying to stop them. The passage also says that if the Allies had failed, Germany might have conquered Britain and then all of Europe.  This implies that the Allies *succeeded* in their efforts, and therefore the British (as a key part of the Allied effort) were successful.
"
Yini ebeyingekho ngesikhathi AmaAsiriya athatha indawo?,"The correct answer is **B: amaCrossbows**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Assyrians *removed* the saddles from their warhorses to make them lighter and faster. This means they were *not* using them.
* The passage mentions Assyrian soldiers using chariots, and the focus is on the horses themselves (specifically, the lack of saddles).
* The passage describes the Assyrian soldiers' weaponry as spears and the impact of the chariots' wheels.  There's no mention of crossbows.
* The passage discusses protective clothing.
* The passage specifically mentions warhorses.



Therefore, the answer is **B: amaCrossbows**."
Beziliwa kanjani izimpi ebezinezinqola zokulwa?,"The correct answer is **C: Gibele ihashi**.

The passage states: ""Amasosha agibeleyo ibutho elilwa ligibele amahhashi."" This translates to ""The chariots were a fighting unit that rode on horses."" Therefore, the Assyrian war chariots fought *on* horses, making option C the correct answer.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kukuphi lapho ongeke uthole umuntu owaseBhabhiloni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuletha iminikelo ngaphakathi kwendawo engcwele**.

Here's why:

The passage states that only the priest was allowed to enter the inner sanctuary (endawo engcwele).  Therefore, common people would not be able to bring offerings inside that area. The other options are all actions described as happening at temples: bringing offerings, attending ceremonies, and visiting smaller temples."
Ikuphi okulandelayo kwanzelwa ngokuqondile amapristi?,"The correct answer is **B: Izindawo ezincwele**.

The passage states: ""...the temple had an outer sanctuary and a inner sacred area where only the priest could enter."" Therefore, the priests were specifically allowed in the inner sacred area, which is a type of sacred space.
"
Inkosi uTutankhamun waluthola nini udumo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemva ngokutholwa kwethuna lakhe**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nakuba amathuna amaningi wangezikhathi ezidlule egcekeziwe, leli thuna lalishiywe cishe lingaphazanyiswanga. Ukutholwa kwethuna lakhe ngo-1922 kwamenza usowaziwayo."" This directly indicates that he gained fame *after* his tomb was discovered.
"
Yini eyenza Inkosi uTutankhamun waduma njenge Nkosi yaseEgibhite?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukutholwa kwethuna lakhe elingathintwanga.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Nakuba amathuna amaningi wangezikhathi ezidlule egcekeziwe, leli thuna lalishiywe cishe lingaphazanyiswanga. Ukutholwa kwethuna lakhe ngo-1922 kwamenza usowaziwayo.""

While the other options are related, the discovery of his largely intact tomb is the *primary* reason for his fame. The passage emphasizes this as the key event that made him famous.
"
Imbongi yaseGreek uHomer yini ebeyimuhlulwa ukuyenza?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukukhuluma**.

The passage states that Homer was a ""famous poet, a soaring bard,"" indicating he was known for his *speaking* and composing poetry.
"
Yimuphi umuGrikhi odumile owazelwa okunye ngaphandle kwezincwadi?,"The correct answer is **C: u-Pythagorus**.

The text states: ""Omunye umGreki odumile usozibalo uPythagoras, owaziwa kakhulu ngomqondo wakhe oqinisekiswa ngokuchasiselwa odumile omayelana nokuhlangana phakathi kwezinhlangothi zonxantathu abanezinhlangothi ezimbili eziqondene ngqo.""  This implies Pythagoras is known for his mathematical work, not for writing epic poems like Homer or plays like Sophocles and Aristophanes.
"
Umdeni wesiHebheru bebacitha isikhathi kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Lapho kuvuleke khona**.

The passage states: ""Isikhathi esiningi impilo yemindeni yamaHebheru yenzeka endaweni evulekile."" (Much of the life of Hebrew families took place in an open space.)  This directly indicates they spent time in open, outdoor areas.
"
Yini okungabalulekanga emdenini wamaHebheru?,"The correct answer is **C: Imizi yabo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Indlu beyingabalulekanga kakhulu"" which translates to ""The house was not very important.""
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi umahluko phakathi kweScandanavia nezinye iziwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Indawo**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that while the Scandinavian countries were geographically close, there were significant differences in people, customs, and history. It *implies* differences in culture and people, and the text *mentions* history as a differentiating factor. However, it doesn't suggest a difference in *location* as a reason for the differences between Scandinavia and other regions. The text implies they were all in the same general region (Northern Europe).

Therefore, the answer is **B: Indawo**.
"
Ngubani owahlelwa e-Greenland kuqala?,"The correct answer is **A: Izizwe zama-Eskimo**.

The passage states: ""Naphezu kokuba etholakele, isizwe sama-Eskiro besilokhu sihlala lapho ngaleso sikhathi."" (Despite being discovered, the Eskimo people had been living there for quite some time.) This indicates they were the original inhabitants of Greenland. While Erik the Red is credited with discovering and naming it, the Eskimo people were already there.
"
Iliphi iqembu elikhetha ukudla ngaphandle kokusebenzisa izitulo?,"The correct answer is **C: Amadoda acebile aseRoma**.

The passage states: ""Nakuba abantu abampofu nabesifazane babedla ukudla kwabo babe behlezi ezihlalweni, amadoda acebile ayethanda ukuba namadili ndawonye lapho ayehlala khona ngezinhlangothi kuyilapho edla ukudla kwawo."" This means wealthy men ate while reclining on couches, not sitting on chairs.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungeyona inxenye yedile laseRoma lakudala?,"The correct answer is **D: Isitsha se-turkey eyosiwe (Smoked turkey).**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the ancient Romans *did not* have foods like tomatoes, potatoes, chili peppers, or cocoa, and they certainly didn't have smoked turkey, which is a later development.  The passage details the food of the Romans, and smoked turkey wasn't part of it.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Izivakashi ezimpofu zidlela ezitulweni (Poor visitors ate at tables):** The passage states that the poor ate at tables, unlike the wealthy.
*   **B: Ukuhalela iminenke (Hunting dormice):** The passage mentions dormice as part of the Romans' unusual foods.
*   **C: Amadoda ahlezi phansi adla ukudla kwakusihlwa (Wealthy men ate dinner together):** The passage states that wealthy men preferred to dine together.



"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, ikuphi okulandelayo okungeke kuhlala isikhathi eside?","The correct answer is **A: Umphakathi (Civilization)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that civilizations ""zandulela izizwe"" (evolve into nations). This implies a progression and change over time.  Civilizations are not static; they grow, change, and eventually transform.
* **Isiko elincani (Small culture)**: Small cultures are more likely to disappear without historical evidence.
* **Imiso sedolobha (City ruins)**: City ruins are remnants of past civilizations and are tangible historical evidence.
* **Isiko eselithuthukile (Advanced culture)**: While cultures evolve, an ""advanced culture"" is a characteristic of a civilization and thus, the *civilization* itself is subject to change and eventual decline, not a specific aspect of it.

Therefore, the passage suggests that a civilization is the most likely to change and not remain static over a very long period.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini eyeza kuqala kunesizwe?","The correct answer is **A: Isiko eselithuthukile (A well-developed culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izifundazwe zandulela izizwe.""  This means civilizations evolved from cultures. The passage further describes a civilization as a large group of people working together, implying a complex and developed cultural structure comes *before* the formation of a civilization.
"
Isiphi isitatimende okungesona iqiniso ngoDrukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Yakhiwa ukuze kuhalalise ukuhlulwa kwamasosha weTibetan-Mongol.**

Here's why:

* The text states the Dzong was built to commemorate Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory over the Mongol armies. It was *not* built to celebrate a defeat.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Ise Bhutan:** The text explicitly states it's located in the Paro region of Bhutan.
* **C: Umlilo wamosha izinsalela zezakhiwo:** The text clearly says a fire damaged the Dzong, leaving only some remains.
* **D: Yenziwa uZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:** The text directly attributes the construction to Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.



Therefore, the statement that is *not* true is that it was built to celebrate a defeat."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza imiphulela yomlimo eDrukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **A: Izinsalela ezasala zesithombe sikaZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngemva komlilo, inqaba yasindiswa yaphinde yavikelwa, yasala ingenye yezinto ezihehayo ngokuthinta inhliziyo zase-Bhutan. **Izinsalela ezasala zesithombe sikaZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel**.""  This directly links the remaining statue to what's left of the Dzong after the fire.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ibutho likaTibetan-Mongol yilona elanqoba:** While the passage mentions the victory over the Tibetan-Mongols, it doesn't say the *army* is a key feature of what's left of the Dzong.
*   **C: Indawo ethandiwa abantu ayikaze ithinteke:** The passage states the Dzong *was* damaged by a fire.
*   **D: Yagcinwa kahle uZhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel:**  While the Dzong was built by him, the passage focuses on the *remains* of the statue as something that endures and is touching. It doesn't state that he himself was preserved within the Dzong.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo ngeCambodia kuyiqiso?,"The correct answer is **D: AmaThais amosha iPhnom Phen**.

The passage states: ""I-Thailand kanye neVietnam babuye bahlasela i-Cambodia. Eminyakeni yokugcina yekhulu lama-18 leminyaka abantu baseVietnam babuye bahlasela i-Cambodia."" and ""ngo-1772 babhubhisa i-Phnom Phen."" It also says ""I-Thailand bahlasele i-Cambodia izikhathi eziningana ngekhulu lama-18 leminyaka..."" Therefore, the Thais were the ones who blew up Phnom Phen in 1772.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo kuchaza kahle ukuvinjezelwa kweCambodia?,"The best answer is **B: IThais neVietnam bavimbezela iCambodia ngo1772**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Phakathi nekhulu lama-18 leminyaka iKhambhodiya yazithola iminyene phakathi komakhelwne ababili abanamandla, i-Thailand kanye neVietnam.  I-Thailand bahlasele i-Cambodia izikhathi eziningana ngekhulu lama-18 leminyaka *yakho ngo-1772 babhubhisa i-Phnom Phen*. Eminyakeni yokugcina yekhulu lama-18 leminyaka abantu baseVietnam babuye bahlasela i-Cambodia.""

* **Option B directly reflects this information:** It correctly identifies both Thailand and Vietnam as aggressors in 1772.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: I-Vietman bavimbezela iCambodia kaningana:** While Vietnam did attack, the passage doesn't say they did so ""kaningana"" (often or frequently) throughout the entire century.
* **C: Abantu beVietnam bamosha iPhnom Phen:**  The passage states Vietnam *attacked* Phnom Phen, not that they *bombed* it. Also, it doesn't say Vietnam was the only one.
* **D: IThais yavimbezela iCambodia kaningana:** The passage mentions the Thais attacked ""izikhathi eziningana"" but specifically highlights the 1772 attack.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungeziwa iDutch East India Company ngesikhathi baseTaiwan?,"The correct answer is **C: Qasha amaShayina ezindaweni zokutshala**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ngo1624,inkampani yaseNdiya yeDutch East yamisa isikhungo eningizimu ntshonalanga Taiwan, iqalisa ukushintshwa kokukhiqizwa kokusanhlamvu komdabu futhi iqasha izisebenzi zaseShayina ukuba zisebenze emasimini welayisi noshukela."" (In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan, began the shift in sugar production, and recruited Chinese workers to work on the sugar and tobacco plantations.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuba nesisekelo eningizimu-tshonalanga yesiqhing:** While they did establish a base, the question asks what they did *following* the establishment of the base.
* **B: Ukuphrakthiza indlela yendabuko okutshala:** The passage mentions *shifting* production to sugar, not practicing traditional methods.
* **D: Ngokuzithandela ukunikela igunya elisuka eTaiwan liya kuQing dynasty:** There's no mention of voluntary granting of authority to the Qing dynasty in the provided text. They eventually transferred control to the Qing dynasty through the Treaty of Simonoseki, but not through voluntary concession initially.



"
Isivumelwani seShimonoseki saqnisa ini?,"The correct answer is **D: Igunya leJapani phezu kweTaiwan**.

The provided text states: ""Ngo-1895, ngemva kokuhlulwa eMpini Yokuqala yamaJapani yase—ino (1894-1895), uhulumeni wase-Qing usayina Isivumelwano se-Simonoseki, ngaso edlulisela iTaiwan eJapani, ebusa isiqhingi kuze kube ngu-1945."" This directly indicates that the treaty granted Japan authority over Taiwan.
"
Amazinga wepH wekhemikhali akaliswa njani?,"The correct answer is **C: Inani leHydrogen ions elikule khemikhali**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Izinga le-pH likhonjwa inani lama-ion weHydrogen (i-H kuyi-pH) kuyikhemikhali elihlolwayo."" This directly translates to pH being determined by the number of hydrogen ions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ilulla kangakani lekhemikali noma ine-asidi engakanani:** While acidity relates to the amount of acid, pH is specifically a measure of the hydrogen ion concentration, not just the quantity of the chemical.
* **B: Mangakhi amaprothoni akulekhemikhali:**  Protons (H+) are hydrogen ions, but the passage refers to the *number* of hydrogen *ions*, not just protons in general.
* **D: Mangakhi ama-electron akulekhemikhali:**  Electrons are not directly related to the pH scale.  The pH scale is based on hydrogen ions.



"
Yini eyakhishwa kuHydrogen ions?,"The correct answer is **A: ama-Protons**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Izinga le-pH likhonjwa inani lama-ion weHydrogen (i-H kuyi-pH) kuyikhemikhali elihlolwayo. Ama-ion weHydrogen amaphrothoni lawo ekususwe ama-elektroni wawo kuwo (njengoba ama-athomu weHydrogen enziwa iphrothoni elilodwa ne-elektroni elilodwa).""

This directly indicates that hydrogen ions (H+) are protons.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile amabhubesi?,"The correct answer is **A: Baziphathisa okwezinja ezeninengi (They behave like multiple dogs)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ivuyo lamabhubesi liziphatha njengomhlambi wamanketshane, izilwane ezifana namabhubesi ngokumangalisayo (kodwa hhayi amanye amakati amakhulu) ngokuziphatha, kanye futhi nokuba yingozi ezilwaneni ezizizingelayo.""  This indicates they behave like *cats*, not dogs.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **B: Isilinganiso samadoda nabesifazane asilingani (There is a significant male-to-female ratio):** The passage says, ""Abesifazane ngokuvamile bahlobene, okuwumndeni omkhulu wodadewabo noma amadodakazi,"" implying a larger female population.
* **C: Amadoda nabesifazane bayahlobana (Males and females are related):** The female lineage is described as involving sisters and daughters.
* **D: Bobabili bayingozi futhi banobungani (Both are dangerous and social):** The passage states, ""nokuba yingozi ezilwaneni ezizizingelayo,"" and that they ""liziphatha njengomhlambi wamanketshane,"" indicating social behavior.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile ukuziphatha kamabhubesi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuziphatha kwabo kuyafana nemindeni yamakathi amakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ivuyo lamabhubesi liziphatha njengomhlambi wamanketshane, izilwane ezifana namabhubesi ngokumangalisayo (kodwa hhayi amanye amakati amakhulu) ngokuziphatha, kanye futhi nokuba yingozi ezilwaneni ezizizingelayo.""

This directly contradicts option D. The passage explicitly says their behavior is *not* like typical big cat families. Options A, B, and C are all supported by the information in the passage. They indicate the social structure and behavior of lions.
"
Abonogwaja bathanda ukuzingelwa iziphi izilwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Amakati amancane**.

The text states: ""Ngaphansi kwazo kukhona amakati amancanyana ngobukhulu adla inyama ebanjelwa ukudliwakusuka kunogwaja..."" which translates to ""Beneath them are small cats in size that eat meat trapped from the snake...""  This indicates that the small cats are the ones that prey on snakes.
"
Amakati amancane athanda ukuzingela kuphi okulandelayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Abonogwaja**.

The text states: ""Ngaphansi kwazo kukhona amakati amancanyana ngobukhulu adla inyama ebanjelwa ukudliwakusuka kunogwaja..."" which translates to ""Under them are small cats that eat meat trapped from the badger...""  Therefore, the kittens hunt badgers.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona inxenye yokuzingela kwe-ocelot?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuzingela kuphela izilwane izincane ngosayizi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that ocelots hunt a variety of small animals (mice, snakes, rodents, birds).** It doesn't say they *only* hunt small animals.
* **The other options are all mentioned as part of the ocelot's hunting strategy:**
    * **A: Ukuzifihla kokuzifanisa nendawo:** The passage says they use camouflage to stalk prey.
    * **B: Ukulandela umnuko wenyamazane:**  The passage states they use their sense of smell to find prey.
    * **C: Ukulandela inyamazane phakathi nobusuku:** The passage mentions their excellent night vision.

Therefore, the statement that they *only* hunt small animals is incorrect based on the given text."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungachazi ngokunembile nge-ocelot? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ukunuka kwawo kubuthaka (Their sense of smell is sensitive)**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that ocelots hunt by smell, have excellent night vision, and are agile.
*   The passage *doesn't* say their sense of smell is particularly sensitive. It says they *use* their sense of smell to hunt.
*   Options A, B, and D are all directly supported by the information in the text.



Therefore, C is the only statement that cannot be confidently confirmed based on the provided text."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekhe kwathiwa ingwe iyakwazi ukukwenza kahle?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukugibela**.

Here's why:

* The text states that tigers can roar, stalk, jump long distances, and pounce with great force.
* It also mentions that tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars are the only four cat species that can roar.
* The text explicitly compares the roar of a tiger to a ""burst of rage, a growl of fury.""
* The text *does not* mention lions being able to climb.

Therefore, the only option that isn't mentioned as a capability of the animals discussed (and is unlikely for a lion) is climbing.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yimuphi umehluko phakathi kwebhbesi nengwe?","The correct answer is **A: Ikhono lokubhukuta (The ability to roar)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that tigers, lions, leopards, and jaguars are the *only* cats that can roar.
* It also differentiates the tiger's roar from a lion's, describing the tiger's roar as more akin to a growl or snarl.
* Options B, C, and D all describe physical capabilities that are not unique to lions and are mentioned in the text as traits shared with other cats, not as a distinction between lions and tigers.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okwenziwe uRobert Hooke ngaphambi kokuba kwenziwe amabiologist?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuqaphela amaseli afile**.

The passage states: ""Wayengumuntu wokuqala wokuhlola amangqamuzana afile."" (He was the first person to examine dead cells.) This directly answers the question.
"
Umsuka waleli gama elithi seli lisho ukuthini?,"The correct answer is **B: Igumbi elincani**.

The passage states: ""I-cell ivela egameni lesiLatin elithi cella elisho igumbi elincane.""  This directly translates to ""A cell comes from the Latin word cella which means a small room.""
"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, izilwane zinekhona lokwenza ini?","The correct answer is **D: Ukugubha**.

The passage states: ""Izilwane zidla izinto futhi zizigaye ngaphakathi."" This translates to ""Animals eat things and digest them inside."" Digestion is the process of breaking down food, or ""ukugubha"" in Zulu.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukudiza (To run):** While some animals run, the passage mentions more than just running.
* **B: Ukunyakaza (To move):** The passage says animals *can* move, but it doesn't say it's their only or defining characteristic.
* **C: Ukubhukuda (To swim):** The passage mentions swimming in the ocean, but again, it's not the only thing animals do.

Therefore, **ukugubha (to digest)** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, izilwane eziningi azinani?","The correct answer is **A: Amasela (Cells)**.

The passage states: ""Izilwane zenziwa amangqamuzana amaningi."" which translates to ""Animals are made of many cells.""
"
Ikuphi okuvuza isitshalo ngesikhathi se-photosynthesis?,"The correct answer is **D: Ilanga**.

Here's why:

* **Photosynthesis** is the process plants use to convert light energy (primarily from the sun) into chemical energy in the form of sugars. 
* **Chlorophyll**, the green pigment in plants, captures the sunlight needed for this process.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ithunzi (Soil):**  The soil provides nutrients and water, but isn't the source of energy for photosynthesis.
* **B: Izilwane (Animals):** Animals are consumers and rely on plants for food and oxygen.
* **C: Ukudla (Food):** Food is a result of photosynthesis, not the source of the energy.



"
Ukuphi okuphishwa abantu okuthathwa izilwane?,"The correct answer is **D: Umoya okhishwa umuntu ngemva kokuphefumula**.

The question asks where the animals take in the carbon dioxide that humans exhale. Animals breathe in the air, and that air contains carbon dioxide.  The carbon dioxide is taken in during respiration.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izibonelo eziveziwe ezingaphazamisa uhlelo lokuziphendukela kwemvelo?","The correct answer is **A: Iqembu elincane elihluleka ukuthuthuka endaweni entsha.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that a small group moving to a new location often ends up in a different place with different resources and competitors. To survive and thrive, the new group needs to develop new traits or adapt. If the small group *fails* to adapt and evolve in the new environment, it will be unable to compete effectively and is essentially failing at adapting to the natural selection process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Inxenye yabantu abanengi abathuthela endaweni entsha:** This describes a migration, not necessarily a situation where adaptation is failing.
* **C: Abantu abanengi abazama ukujwayela ukuhlala endaweni entsha:**  Trying to adapt is part of the process, not a failure of it.
* **D: Iqembu labantu elizophindeka kabili:** This is unrelated to the concept of adaptation and natural selection.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo akuchazi ngokunembile uhlelo lwezinto eziphilayo umazihlukana phakathi ukuzi zizimele? ,"The correct answer is **B: Into ebaluleke kakhulu ohlelweni lokuziphendukela kwemvelo.**

Here's why:

The passage describes speciation as the process where populations diverge and eventually become distinct species. It highlights that this process is a *major component of evolution*. Option B directly reflects this by stating that speciation is ""the most important part of the evolutionary process.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kwenzeka uma inengi lwabantu abasanda kuqala behluleka ukujwayela** - This is inaccurate. While initial adaptation is important, the passage describes speciation as happening over long periods and is not solely dependent on initial failure to adapt.
*   **C: Ibhekisela ohlelweni lwezinto ezintsha eziphilayo** -  While speciation *results* in new species, the passage isn't primarily focused on the creation of new species itself, but rather on *how* those species diverge from each other.
*   **D: Ukukwenzeka kwayo akuzibeki** - The passage explicitly states that speciation is a *non-random process*, being driven by environmental pressures and adaptation.

Therefore, Option B accurately captures the central theme of the passage: speciation is a critical and non-random part of evolution.



"
Iyiphi inxenye ejikelezayo ehambisa igazi enhliziweni?,"The correct answer is **A: ama-Arteries**.

Here's why:

* **Arteries** are the blood vessels that carry oxygenated blood *away* from the heart to the rest of the body. This is the direction of blood flow *into* the heart in the circulatory system.
* **Capillaries** are tiny blood vessels where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste occurs between the blood and the body's tissues. Blood flows *through* them.
* **Organs** are not blood vessels; they are the structures that the blood supplies.
* **Veins** carry deoxygenated blood *back* to the heart.
"
Yimaphi amathubu amancani lawa ajikeleza umzimba wonke?,"The correct answer is **A: ama-Capillaries**.

Here's why:

* **Capillaries** are the smallest blood vessels and form a vast network that connects arteries and veins. They are responsible for the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products between the blood and the body's tissues. They reach nearly every cell in the body.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Arteries:** Carry oxygen-rich blood *away* from the heart. They are larger than capillaries.
* **Veins:** Carry oxygen-poor blood *back* to the heart. They are also larger than capillaries.
* **Organs:** Are the organs in the body, not blood vessels.



"
Ikhono lenambuzane elikwazi ukugoqa izimpiko zayo emuva inyusa kuphi okulandelayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Izindawo zokufihla**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to fold their wings allows hummingbirds to create a safe place to shelter from predators. Therefore, it improves their ability to find *shelter*.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezwanga kulesi sigaba okubonisa ukuthi ikhono lokundiza lezinambuzane lithintekile?,"The answer is **B: Ubude bempilo**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how flight helped flamingos survive and thrive.** It mentions avoiding predators, finding food, and nesting.
* **Option A (Ukukhiqiza kabusha - Reproduction) is indirectly implied.**  Survival and thriving lead to successful reproduction.  The passage suggests flight aided in survival, which is necessary for reproduction.
* **Option C (Ukuqoqa kokudla - Food gathering) is directly mentioned.** The passage states that flight helped flamingos find food more successfully.
* **Option D (Ukusebenza kahle - Performance) is a broad term.** While flight *is* a performance, the passage doesn't specifically detail aspects of flight performance that were affected.
* **Option B (Ubude bempilo - Lifespan) is not directly addressed.** The passage doesn't say anything about how flight impacts the length of a flamingo's life.  It only focuses on survival and foraging advantages.

Therefore, the lifespan is the aspect *not* mentioned in the passage that could be affected by the ability to fly.
"
Iziphi izici ezilandelayo ezingahltshaniswanga nama-dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuhamba kokubuyela emuva kwenyawo elilodwa**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that birds *are* dinosaurs and have features like clawed feet, beaks, and bipedal locomotion (walking on two legs like a T-Rex).
* The passage *doesn't* mention any dinosaur having the ability to walk backwards on one foot. While some animals can do this, it's not a characteristic mentioned as being shared by dinosaurs or birds.

Therefore, the answer that doesn't fit the description of features shared with dinosaurs, as outlined in the passage, is the ability to walk backwards on one foot.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungajwayelekanga okwabelana nezici ezifanayo kwezinyoni nama dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuhamba kokubuyela emuva kwezinywo ezimbil**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions that some birds have teeth and can walk on two legs like a T-Rex. 
* **The passage *doesn't* mention birds having teeth.** While some dinosaurs did have teeth, most modern birds do not.
*  **""Ukuhamba kokubuyela emuva kwezinywo ezimbil"" (recoiling teeth)** is a characteristic found in some dinosaurs.  The passage highlights the similarity in how some birds and dinosaurs behave.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ukubeka amaqanda (laying eggs):**  Both dinosaurs and birds lay eggs, so this is a common trait and not particularly unusual.
* **C: Ikhona lokundiza (being able to fly):** While many birds can fly, the passage says that the debate is whether *some* dinosaurs evolved into birds.  Not all dinosaurs flew.
* **D: Izinyawo ezinezinzipho (having clawed feet):** Many dinosaurs had clawed feet, and many birds also have clawed feet. This is another common trait.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi ingxenye yesitshalo ye-cycad okungenzeka iTriceratops iyidle?","The correct answer is **A: Amahlamvu ahlabayo (Bark)**.

The passage states: ""Lezi zitshalo sibukeka njengesihlala sesundu namaqabunga acijile, ahlabayo."" This directly indicates that the Triceratops likely ate the bark of the cycad plants.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okungenzeka iTriceratops? ","The correct answer is **B: Isitshalo esinama gatsha aqinile**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Triceratops could crush strong shells and bones.
* It also mentions that Triceratops may have used its strong beak to crush cycads (which are described as having tough, cone-like structures).
* Therefore, the most likely food source for Triceratops, according to the passage, is a plant with a tough shell.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sloth:** Sloths are mammals and not mentioned in relation to Triceratops' diet.
* **C: Upholi (Monkey):** Monkeys are primates and not relevant to Triceratops' diet.
* **D: Isitshalo isinesithelo esinoshevu (Plant with fuzzy fruit):** While Triceratops *might* have eaten fuzzy fruit, the passage emphasizes its ability to crush tough shells and cones.  A fuzzy fruit is not the primary food source highlighted in the text.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi imidlalo ethandekayo nedumile enyakatho yezifunda ze-Italy?","The correct answer is **C: Snowboarding**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Imidlalo yasebusika ithandwa kakhulu ezindaweni eziseNyakatho, lapho amaNtaliyane encintisana khona emidlalweni yamazwe onke kanye nasemidlalweni yama-Olimpiki.""  Snowboarding is a winter sport. The other options are mentioned as popular sports, but the passage specifically links winter sports to the Northern regions of Italy.
"
"Ngokuya ngemininingwane enikeziwe, iwuphi umdlalo owanqobela ubuqawe bomhlaba be-Italy?","The correct answer is **A: Ibhola**.

The text states: ""Ibhola lezinyawo lezwe laseNtaliyane, kanye neqembu lebhola lezinyawo lezwe laseJalimane iqembu lesibili eliphumelele kakhulu emhlabeni futhi bekuyizingqwele zeNdebe yoMhlaba yeFIFA ngo-2006.""  This directly indicates that Italian football (bhola lezinyawo) won the FIFA World Cup.
"
Ngemva kwamuphi umcimbi inxenye yeLuxembourg yaba iBelgian?,"The correct answer is **C: Impi Yezwe yesibili**.

The text states: ""...zaba yingxenye yeBheljiyamu ngemva koShintsho lwaseBheljiyamu lwangawo-1830. ILuxembourg ibihlale iyizwe elizama ukungathathi uhlangothi...""  The Belgian Revolution of 1830 is when Luxembourg became part of Belgium. While Luxembourg was involved in both World Wars, the specific event mentioned in the question is the transition to being part of Belgium.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okwathinta ukungathathi uhlangothi kweLuxembourg?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukubusa kweBelgian**.

Here's why:

* The text states that parts of modern-day Belgium were once part of Luxembourg and later became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution of 1830.  This means Luxembourg was under Belgian rule for a period.
* The question asks what *affected* Luxembourg's neutrality.  Being under Belgian rule directly impacted its ability to be completely neutral, as it was essentially a part of another country.
* While the other options are relevant to Luxembourg's history, they don't directly relate to the *cause* of its struggles with neutrality.

Therefore, the period of Belgian rule is the key factor that impacted Luxembourg's ability to maintain neutrality.



"
Amakhilomitha ayingakhi waseTurkey ase-Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""Indawo yaseTheki, kuhlanganise namachibi, ingamakhilomitha skwele angu-783,562 (300,948 sq mi), lapho amakhilomitha skwele angu-755,688 (291,773 sq mi) ase-Asia eseningizimu ntshonalanga futhi amakhilomitha skwele angu-23,764 (9,174 sq mi) aseYurophu.""

This means the area of Turkey in Europe is 23,764 sq mi (or km²).
"
"Ngokuya kwesigaba, i-Turkey ingama mayila ayingakhi?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Indawo yaseTheki ingaphezu kwamakhilomitha angu-1,600 (1,000 mi) ubude..."" which translates to ""The length of Turkey is over 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)...""  The question asks for the length in miles, and 1600 kilometers is equivalent to 1000 miles.
"
Yiluphi ulwimi lwesiLathini esetshenjiswa eVatican City?,"The correct answer is **A: Imicimbi yezenkolo (Religious ceremonies)**.

The text explicitly states: ""isiLatin sibuye sibe ulimi lwansuku zonke olusetshenziswa iningi lalabo abasebenza esifundeni kuyilapho isiLatin sivame ukusebenziswa emikhosini engokwenkolo.""  This translates to: ""Latin is also used as the everyday language by many who work in the area, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.""
"
"EVatican City, yini okuyisiNtaliyana okungasetshenjiswa?","The correct answer is **A: Umthetho (Law)**.

The text states: ""Izwe elizimele elincane kunalo wonke emhlabeni nezwe elinabantu abancane kunabo bonke. Idolabha lase-Vatican lisebenzisa imithetho yaseNtaliyane...""  This directly indicates that Italian law is used in Vatican City.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo okuzuzisa ukuhlanganisa umculo kumakhompuyutha asezingeni eliphezulu?","The correct answer is **B: Amapopayi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umculo kaningi urekhodwa kusetshenziswa amakhompyutha ayinkimbinkimbi ukusebenzisa **nokuuhlanganisa imisindo ndawonye**.""  This directly links computers to the process of combining sounds, which is what ""amapopayi"" (which I understand to mean ""processors"" in this context - although the translation isn't perfect) would facilitate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umculo (Music):** Music is *created* or *recorded* using computers, but it's not the *process* of combining sounds.
* **C: Izithombe (Pictures):** While computers handle images, the passage focuses on audio.
* **D: Ukwakhiwa (Construction/Building):** This doesn't relate to the process of combining sounds in music.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, inengi lezindlu ezinama-toilet aflashayo zikuyiphi indawo?","The correct answer is **A: i-Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Amadolobha waseHarappa kanye naseMohenjo-daro ayenedlu yangasese eshaywayo cishe kuzo zonke izindlu..."" This directly links the presence of flush toilets to the Harappan and Mohenjo-daro civilizations.
"
Iziphi izindawo ezilandelayo ezatholwa zithuthukile ohlelweni lokucululwa indle?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Harappa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Amadolobha waseHarappa kanye naseMohenjo-daro ayenedlu yangasese eshaywayo cishe kuzo zonke izindlu, ehlanganiswe nendlela eyinkimbinkimbi yokuthutha indle.""  This directly links Harappa to the discovery of advanced drainage systems.

While Santorini, Egypt, Persia, and China also had drainage systems, the passage *specifically* mentions Harappa first in connection with advanced drainage. Therefore, it's the most direct answer based on the provided text.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okubangela ukuba i-skater sijike?,"The correct answer is **A: Ijika elincani ngaphansi kweblade lesi-skater**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngenxa yokuthi ingaphansi locezu lugobile kancane, njengoba ucezu lutshekela ohlangothini olulodwa noma kolunye, unqanqama oluthintene neqhwa nalo luyatsheka. Lokhu kubangela ukuthi abashushuluzi baphenduke.""

This directly points to a small bend (or tilt) of the blade causing the skier to turn.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Izinhlangothi ezisemaceleni zeblade yesi-skater:** While the edges of the blade *do* help with turning, the passage focuses on the *bend* under the blade as the primary cause of unexpected turns.
* **C: Konke, izinga nekhono lesi-skater:** The passage doesn't mention the skater's skill level. It specifically highlights a mechanical issue with the blade.
* **D: Izinga leqhwa:**  The passage notes that the blade *shakes* because of the bend and snow contact.  It doesn't attribute the turn *itself* to snow conditions.

Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text is **A**.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu,ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokunembile umgodi okublade yesi-skate zamanje?","The correct answer is **B: Ijika (Turn)**.

The passage explicitly states that the design, with its two fins and bent center, causes the snowboard to turn when the rider leans.  The passage details *how* the turn happens (the bending and the contact with the snow), confirming that the key characteristic is its ability to turn.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iluphi uhlelo oluvumela ama-atomu asuse amandla amanengi angadingekile emhlanyweni?","The correct answer is **B: Ukunyaka kwama-photons**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukuze zibuyele emazingeni wazo wangaphambili wamandla, kumelwe ziqede amandla engeziwe eziwathole ekukhanyeni. Zenza lokhu ngokukhipha inhlayiyana yokukhanya ebizwa """"nge-photon"""".""  This translates to: ""In order to return to their previous power levels, they must release excess energy they have gained in the light. They do this by emitting a light particle called a """"photon"""".""

The passage explains that atoms release photons to get rid of excess energy. Therefore, the process of releasing photons is the mechanism by which atoms lose excess energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Imisebe (Matter):** While atoms are made of matter, the passage focuses specifically on the release of *photons*, not matter in general.
*   **C: ama-Photon (Photons):** Photons are the *particles* released, not the *process* of losing energy.
*   **D: Ukunyaka kwemisebe (Emission of matter):** The passage describes the emission of *light particles (photons)*, not the emission of matter in general.

"
Yini ebangela i-athomu ikhiphe i-photon?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukukhipha amandla amakhulu angadingeki (Releasing excess energy)**.

The text states: ""Ukuze zibuyele emazingeni wazo wangaphambili wamandla, kumelwe ziqede amandla engeziwe eziwathole ekukhanyeni.""  This translates to: ""In order to return to their previous energy levels, they must release the excess energy they have gained from light.""  The energy is released in the form of photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukudelela okubangelwa umkhanyo okhanya kakhulu (Radiation caused by very bright light):** While light *can* cause atoms to release energy, the text emphasizes that it's about *excess* energy, not simply being exposed to bright light.
* **C: Izinga lamandla elingalawuleki (Uncontrolled energy levels):** The text describes a specific process (photon emission) linked to energy levels, not uncontrolled levels.
* **D: Ukusabela kwemisebe engathandekile (Undesirable molecular reaction):** The text doesn't refer to molecular reactions, but specifically to atomic behavior related to light.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini engabangela ukuba isibani sokukhanyisa sikagezi singasebenzi?","The correct answer is **D: Ukungena kukagesi phakathi kwe-socket kuyancipha**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kubalulekile ukuqaphela mawushintsha isibani sokukhanya. Okokuqala, isiqhebeza sesibani kumelwe sicinywe noma ikhebula ingaxhunywa. Lokhu kungenxa yokuba ugesi ungena kuyisokhethi lapho ingxenye yenzimbi yebhalubhu ingakubamba kabuhlungu ngogesi uma uthinta ingaphakathi lesokhethi noma ingaphansi lensimbi lapho isengaphakathi kwesokhethi ngokwengxenye.""

This directly indicates that a risk of electric shock exists if electricity is present in the socket while changing the lightbulb.  Therefore, if electricity is present in the socket (or is somehow leaking), the lightbulb won't work safely.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ukulungiswa kwe-light akucinyiwe kahle:** While turning off the power is important, the text focuses on the *danger of electricity in the socket*, not just about the light fixture being loose.
* **B: Ukuba nesisekelo sesibani esiyinsimbi phakwathi okwesikhana ku-socket:** The text mentions the metal part of the bulb *inside* the socket as a danger, not the base of the bulb in relation to the socket.
* **C: Okungaphakathi kwesibani okushayo:** The text doesn't provide information about an internal issue with the lightbulb itself causing the problem. It focuses on the electrical hazard.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungaba yingozi mawukuthinta njengoba mawushintsha isibani?,"The correct answer is **D: Intambo (The wire)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Kubalulekile ukuqaphela mawushintsha isibani sokukhanya. Okokuqala, isiqhebeza sesibani kumelwe sicinywe noma ikhebula ingaxhunywa. Lokhu kungenxa yokuba ugesi ungena kuyisokhethi lapho ingxenye yenzimbi yebhalubhu ingakubamba kabuhlungu ngogesi uma uthinta ingaphakathi lesokhethi noma ingaphansi lensimbi lapho isengaphakathi kwesokhethi ngokwengxenye.""

This means the wire (intambo) is the part that carries electricity and poses a shock hazard.  Touching it while changing the lightbulb is dangerous.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Imicu (The socket):** While potentially dangerous, the text emphasizes *avoiding* touching the metal parts *within* the socket when it's live. It doesn't highlight the socket itself as the primary hazard to touch while it's powered.
*   **B: La ucima khona isibani (Where you turn off the switch):** Turning off the switch is the *correct* first step to *prevent* a hazard. It's not a potential hazard itself.
*   **C: Isisekelo sesibani (The lightbulb base):** The base is where the bulb screws in, but the danger is in the metal components the base connects to which carry electricity.



"
"Ngokuya kwalesi sigaba, kwenzekani uma i-nucleus ihlukana?","The correct answer is **A: Kuzuzeka ama-protons**.

Here's why:

The passage states that nuclear fission involves the **splitting of the nucleus**. When the nucleus splits, it releases energy and also releases **protons** (along with neutrons).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amandla ayadedelwa (Energy is absorbed):** Fission *releases* energy, not absorbs it.
* **C: Ama-atomu awahlaliseki (Atoms do not remain stable):**  The passage mentions unstable atoms that are prone to splitting. The fission process *is* related to changes in atomic structure.
* **D: Kulahleka ama-neutrons (Neutrons are lost):** While neutrons *are* released during fission, the passage doesn't specifically say that they are *lost*.  It says the nucleus splits *and* energy is released.


Therefore, the most direct answer based on the provided text is that protons are released when the nucleus splits.
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo kuveza ukuthintana okukude okubuyela Emhlabeni,"The correct answer is **B: Amasathelayithi (Satellites)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes using a satellite to relay signals across vast distances.** The satellite receives a signal, processes it, and then transmits it back down to Earth. This is the core mechanism for long-distance communication described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ama-Telescopes (Telescopes)** While telescopes are used for observing the distant universe, they are primarily for *receiving* light, not transmitting signals for communication.
* **C: Izibani (Lights)**  While light is used for communication (e.g., laser communication), the passage specifically describes a satellite-based system for relaying signals.  The passage mentions using telescopes that are *in space* because of the interference in Earth's atmosphere, but it's the satellite itself doing the primary relay.
* **D: Amarokhethi (Rockets)** Rockets are used to *launch* objects into space, like the satellite. They are a *means* to enabling communication, but not the primary means of *communication* itself.



Therefore, **satellites** are the most accurate answer because the passage is directly about using a satellite for long-distance communication."
Yikuphi okulandelayo okusetshenjiselwa ukubeka i-telescope ku-space?,"The correct answer is **B: Amarokhethi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kudingeka irokhethi enkulu engaphezu kwamafidiangu-100 ukuphakama ukubeka isiphuphutheki noma ithelisikobho emkhathini."" (A large rocket above 100 kilometers in altitude is needed to put a satellite or telescope into space.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usebe lokhukanya (Use light):** Light is used for observation, not for launching objects into space.
* **C: Umkhathi womhlaba (Earth's atmosphere):**  The Earth's atmosphere is what rockets need to overcome to reach space.
* **D: Ubude bamasathelayithi, izinyawo eiziyi-100 (Length of satellites, 100 kilometers):** While the passage mentions 100 kilometers, it's the *rocket* that is used to reach that altitude, not the satellite's length.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okumelwe kuqaphelwe nge-cyclical event ukuze ubone ukudlula kwesikhathi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuphinda phinda (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ungaphawula ukudlula kwesikhathi ngokubheka impinda yesenzakalo somjikelozo. Isenzakalo somjikelezo yinto eyenzeka ngokuphindaphindiwe ngokuvamile.""  This translates to: ""You can notice the passage of time by looking at the period of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens repeatedly.""

The key here is *repetition*.  The fact that the event repeats is what allows us to measure and perceive the passage of time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ubude besikhathi (Duration of time):** While duration is *measured* by cyclical events, it's not the primary indicator *of* the passage of time itself.
* **C: Ithonya (Force):** Force is not directly related to observing the passage of time in a cyclical event.
* **D: Ubunzima (Weight):** Weight is not related to observing the passage of time in a cyclical event.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isice sento isikhathi esiqhathanisa naso?","The correct answer is **A: Ubude**.

The passage states: ""Siyindlela esiqhathanisa ngayo isikhathi (ubude) sezenzakalo.""  This directly translates to: ""It is the way we compare the (duration/length) of events.""

Therefore, the passage says time is used to *compare* the **duration/length (ubude)** of events.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo kucatshangelwa okujwayelekile kwendlalifa esikhundleni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuya enyuvesi ngaphambi kokujoyina ubusosha.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that traditionally, a chieftain would go directly to military training after school.
* Charles deviated from this tradition by going to university *before* joining the military.
* Therefore, going to university before joining the military is the opposite of the usual path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuthola i-2:2 degree:** While Charles obtained a 2:2 degree, it's not the *unusual* path; it's a result of his decision to go to university.
* **B: Ukungayi enyuvesi ukuze ujoyine ubusosha:** This is the traditional path, not what the question is asking about.
* **C: Ukufunda ngoMlando:** Charles studying history is part of *why* he went to university, but it's not the unusual path itself.



"
"Ngokuya ngalolulwazi olunikeziwe, uCharles bekungowokuqala ukwenza ini?","The correct answer is **A: Ukujoyini ubusosha ngaphambi kokuqeda isikole.**

The passage states: ""Ngokwesiko, indlalifa yobukhosi izoya ngokuqondile emabuthweni empi ngemva kokuqeda isikole..."" which translates to ""Traditionally, the heir to the throne goes directly to military training after finishing school...""  Charles *didn't* follow this tradition, instead going to university. Therefore, he was the first in his family to *not* go straight to military training after school.

Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the provided text.
"
Iliphi izwe lakuvela khona imikhumbi kaTrygvasson?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Norway**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Olaf Trygvasson, umuntu waseNorway owayenentshisekelo yokukhulula izwe lakhe ekuphathweni yi-Denmark."" (Olaf Trygvasson, a man from Norway who was interested in freeing his country from Danish rule.)
"
"Ngisiphi isikhathi emladweni, amaJalimane aququzela isiko e-Estonia?","The correct answer is **C: Phakathi neminyaka ey-600**.

The text states: ""Cishe ngekhulu lama-15 leminyaka, inyakatho Estonia beyingaphansi kwethonya elikhulu lesiko laseJalimane.""  This means the influence started around the 15th century.  The question asks for the *time period* in history when Germans influenced Estonian culture. The 15th century falls within the 600-year range, making C the most accurate option.
"
Ulwimi lwase Estonia lwathonywa yini?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Alphabet yesiJalimane**.

The text explicitly states: ""Belusekelwe kuma-alfabhethi wesiJalimane..."" which translates to ""It was based on the German alphabet...""
"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, inani labantu abakhuluma isiHindi luyashintshashitsha ngenxa yaliphi iqiniso?","The correct answer is **A: Amalimu lawo acishe afane nesiHindi ayabalwa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukulinganisela kusuka ezigidini ezingu-340 kuya ezigidini ezingu-500 zezikhulumi, *ngokuya ngokuthi ulimi lwesigodi oluhlobene kakhulu luyabalwa yini*."" This means the estimate of speakers varies depending on whether the speakers of closely related languages (like Urdu) are included in the count.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uma abantu abakhuluma isi-Urdu bayabalwa:** While including Urdu speakers *affects* the estimate, the passage focuses on the inclusion of *closely related languages* generally.
*   **C: Uma abantu abakwazi ukulizwisisa ulwimu bayabalwa:** The passage mentions that 800 million people *understand* Hindi, but this isn't the basis for the speaker count variation.
*   **D: Uma abantu abakwazi ukufunda lwimi bayabalwa:** The passage doesn't mention reading ability as a factor in the speaker count.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuliqiniso ngamalimu wesiHindo nesiUrdu?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuyahluka ngokombhalo**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""IsiHindi nesi-Urdu ziyafana ngohlelo lwamagama kodwa ziyahluka ngokubhala..."" (Hindi and Urdu have the same grammatical structure but differ in writing...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kunokungahlangani kwabantu abakhuluma amalimi:** The text indicates that speakers of Hindi and Urdu can understand each other in everyday conversation.
* **C: Achishe afane kokubile indlela akhulunywa ngawo nangendlela abhalwa ngayo:** The text clearly states they differ in writing.
* **D: Iyahluka ngokolwimi:** The text states they have the *same* grammatical structure. They are considered closely related languages, but distinct.



Therefore, option B is the only statement directly supported by the provided text."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okunganembile ngeqiniso leHangeul alphabet?,"The correct answer is **B: Igama langempela uHunan Jeongeum**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the alphabet was originally called **Hunmin Jeongeum**, not Hunan Jeongeum.  Therefore, option B is incorrect.
* Options A, C, and D are all explicitly stated as true in the passage.



Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
I-alphabet elithi Hunmin Jeongeum lashintsha laba yini?,"The correct answer is **B: u-Hangeul**.

The text states: ""Ekuqaleni unike igama i-alfabhethi yeHangeul ngokuthi iHunmin Jeongeum..."" This means that Hunmin Jeongeum is the original name, and it later became known as Hangeul.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iluphi ulwimi olwathonywa iSanskrit?","The correct answer is **A: Amalimi wesiLatin**.

The passage states: ""ISanskrit ulimi lwamandulo futhi lungaqhathaniswa nolimi lwesiLatin olukhulunywa eYurophu."" (Sanskrit is an ancient language and can be compared to the Latin language spoken in Europe.) Therefore, the passage explicitly says Sanskrit is comparable to Latin.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukusebenzisa iSanskirt kwasuswa ngenxa yasiphi isizathu?","The correct answer is **D: Izikundla (Social classes)**.

The passage states: ""Ngemva kokubhalwa kwama-Upanishad, iSanskrit yamane yanyamalala ngenxa yezigaba zokubaluleka."" This translates to ""After the writing of the Upanishads, Sanskrit declined due to social classes.""
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okuyiqiniso mayelana namandla adonsela phansi ku-lo?","The correct answer is **A: Amandla adonsela phansi angakudonsa kancani kunamandla adonsela phansi we-lo**

The passage explicitly states: ""Uma uma emhlabeni we-lo, uzoba nesisindo esincane kunaleso oba naso Emhlabeni... Ngakho amandla okudonsa, empeleni, akudonsa kancane.""  This directly supports option A.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso okuchaza ilingaphandle lenyanga?","The correct answer is **A: Uhlangothi oluseduze line-crust enkulu**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ingxenye engaphandle yeNyanga ibizwa ngokuthi uqweqwe. Ungqimba cishe lungugqinsi olungama-70 km ohlangothini oluseduze kanye nogqinsi olungama-100 km ohlangothini olukude."" (The outer part of the Moon is called the crust. The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.)
* ""Uqweqwe"" translates to ""crust.""
* The near side has a crust that is 70 km thick, while the far side's crust is 100 km thick.  Therefore, the near side has the *larger* crust.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uqweqwe incani kakhulu ngaphansi kwe-zindawo eziphakeme** (The crust is very thin under high elevations) - The passage doesn't mention the crust being thin under high elevations. It states the *thickness* of the crust on different sides.
* **C: Ngale kohlnangothi kungenzeka kube nokuncani kwe-maria** (There might be fewer maria on this side) - The passage states, ""Bekulula ngodaka olushisayo ukukhuphukela phezulu. Kungenzeka kube nezindawo zasenyangeni eziningi ezimnyama ohlangothini ngoba ungqimba luncane."" (It was easier to climb up with hot dust. There might be many dark lunar areas on the side because the crust is thin.)  This implies the presence of maria (dark lunar areas) is related to a *thin* crust, not necessarily fewer maria.
* **D: Kungenza kube ne-maria encani ngaphansi kwezindawo eziphakeme** (It can make maria thinner under high elevations) -  The passage does not connect maria presence with crust thickness under high elevations.

"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ingabe uqweqwe lweNyanga luwugqinsi kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Ohlangothini oluseduze** (Near shore).

The text states: ""Ingxenye engaphandle yeNyanga ibizwa ngokuthi uqweqwe. Ungqimba cishe lungugqinsi olungama-70 km ohlangothini oluseduze...""  This directly indicates that the ""uqweqwe"" (the outer part of the moon) is a solid mass near the shore.
"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, ikuphi okulandelayo okukholelwa abantu abathile?","The correct answer is **A: Abantu bahambe babona izinkanyezi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abantu abaningi baphupha ngosuku lapho beyokwazi ukuvakashela izinkanyezi...""  This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Abantu ngeke bakwazi ukubona imihlaba ekhona:** The passage mentions people wondering about other planets, implying the opposite – they *do* imagine the possibility of other worlds.
* **C: Ukuphila kukhona ngenxa yezinye izitshalo:** The passage discusses the possibility of life on other planets, but doesn't link it to ""other plants"" (izinye izitshalo).
* **D: Kunama miles angaphansi kwayi-trillion phakathi nezinkanyezi:** While the passage mentions ""zigidigidikazi zamamayela,"" it doesn't specify the *number* of galaxies or stars.  It focuses more on the potential for life elsewhere.



"
Ikuphi okunciphayo mawukususa kude maphakathi kwelanga?,"The correct answer is **C: i-Gas**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Igesi iba yincane njengoba uhamba uqhela enkabeni yeLanga."" This directly indicates that the amount of gas decreases as you move further from the center of the sun. While the sun is made of all those elements, the *amount of gas* is what diminishes outwards.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yiluphi uhlangothi lwelanga oluvela emhlabeni?","The correct answer is **C: iPhotosphere**.

The text states: ""Ingxenye engaphandle esiyibonayo lapho sibuka iLanga ibizwa ngokuthi yi-photosphere, okusho ukuthi “indilinga yokukhanya”.""  This directly translates to the visible surface of the sun being called the photosphere.
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okubhekiwe kusize kwaqinisekisa umbono kaCopernicus?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuhamba kweVenus (The motion of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Jeremiya Horrocks observed the path of Venus.""  This directly implies that studying Venus's movement was crucial in supporting Copernicus's model.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Izigaba zeVenus (The phases of Venus):** While the phases of Venus were important, the passage *already* mentions Galileo's observation of them and their support for Copernicus. It's not the *next* step in confirmation.
    * **C: Ukufana okukhona phakathi kweLanga neVenus (The similarity between the Sun and Venus):** The passage doesn't mention anything about comparing the Sun and Venus.
    * **D: Ukufana okukhona phakathi kweNyanga neLanga (The similarity between the Moon and the Sun):**  This is irrelevant to the confirmation of Copernicus's theory.

**The key is that accurately predicting Venus's position in the sky required a heliocentric model (Sun-centered) of the solar system.  The passage implies that Horrocks's observations of Venus's motion helped to refine and solidify that model.**



"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okwabonwa uGalileo Galilei ngo-1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Izigaba zeVenus**.

The passage explicitly states that Galileo observed ""that Venus has phases, like the moon."" These phases are a direct result of the planet reflecting sunlight from only one side at a time.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iAmazon River iwathatha kuphi amanzi?","The correct answer is **C: Izilwandle**.

The text states: ""Amaphesenti angu-20 agcwele amanzi ageleza esuka emifuleni yepulanethi aye ezilwandle asuka e-Amazon."" (20% of the planet's rivers flow into the oceans from the Amazon.)
"
Ikujphi ukuhlonishwa okungabangelwanga i-Amazon River?,"The best answer is **C: Umfula omude**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the Amazon River is the second longest river in the world.**  Options A and B are accurate descriptions.
* **Option C (""Umfula omude"" - Long River) is the most general and accurate.** While technically true, the passage emphasizes its ranking as the *second* longest, making ""long"" less specific.
* **Option D (""Umfula ovulekile"" - Open River) is not mentioned in the text.** It doesn't describe a characteristic of the Amazon River.



Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
Yimuphi umsebenzi okukhulunywa ngakho emushweni ongaqashi inani lanasebenzi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ezolimo (Agriculture)**.

The passage states: ""ingxenye yesithathu kwezimbili yabantu baseVenezuela abasebenzayo basebenza kwezokulima"" which translates to ""one-third of two-thirds of Venezuelan workers work in agriculture.""
"
"Ngokuya kwesiqephu, iyiphi imikhakha elandelayo eqasha inani labantu abanengi eVenezuela?","The correct answer is **A: Inkonzo (Service)**.

The passage states: ""Ngxenye yesithathu kwezimbili yabantu baseVenezuela abasebenzayo basebenza emkhakheni wokukhonza..."" This translates to ""Two-thirds of employed Venezuelans work in the service sector...""  This is the highest percentage mentioned for any sector.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuhlangana kuvumelana izinkanyezi ukuba zenze ini?","The correct answer is **C: Kukhipha ukukhanya nokushisa**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Izinkanyezi zikhipha ukukhanya nokushisa ngenxa yamandla enzekayo lapho ama-athomu e-hydrogen ahlangana (noma axubana) ndawonye ukwakha izakhi ezisinda kakhudlwana.""  (Stars produce light and heat because of the powerful energy that occurs when hydrogen atoms come together (or fuse) to create heavier elements.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kwenza izakhi ezisindayo:** While fusion *creates* heavier elements (which are often more stable), the primary result described in the passage is the production of light and heat.
* **B: Ukwakha ama-fusion reactors:** This is what scientists are *trying* to do, but the question asks what fusion *allows stars to do*.
* **D: Ukwenza ama-hydrogen athomu:**  The passage describes *hydrogen atoms combining* to create heavier elements, not making them.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuyi fusion reactor okungabalusizo ekwenzeni ini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ama-athomu**.

Here's why:

* The passage explains that fusion reactors aim to replicate the process that powers stars, where hydrogen atoms fuse to create heavier, more stable atoms and release energy.
* The core of the process is the interaction of **atoms**, specifically hydrogen atoms in this case. The reactor needs to manipulate atoms to make them fuse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hydrogen:** While hydrogen is *involved* in the fusion process, the reactor doesn't *use* hydrogen as a fuel in a simple sense. It uses hydrogen atoms as the *material* to be fused.
* **B: Stars:** Stars are the natural fusion reactors, but the question asks about what is *needed* to build a fusion reactor.  The process *occurs* in stars, but isn't a component *of* a reactor.
* **D: Power:** Power is the *result* of the fusion process, not what a fusion reactor manipulates to achieve that power.



"
Iyiphi ikhemikhali edala amanzi?,"The correct answer is **C: Amahydrogen athomu amabili nama amathomu we-oksijini amabili**.

The passage states that water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Option C accurately reflects this.
"
"Uma manzi ashintsha isimo sawo, yini engashintshi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukhwakheka kwama-ngqamuzana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nakuba isimo sawo esingokoqobo singashintsha, isimo sawo samakhemikhali asiguquki."" This means that even if water changes state (e.g., from liquid to gas), the chemical composition (the arrangement of atoms) remains the same: two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo kwakungeyona ikinga nge-sizwe seshumi nantathu njengoba kuzama ukuphoqa umthetho?","The correct answer is **A: Ukugadwa okukhulu okubuya emthethweni wesizwe**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the weaknesses of the Articles of Confederation.** It highlights the lack of a strong central government, particularly in areas like taxation and law enforcement.
* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Imithetho beyidinga ukuba zonke izifunda zivume ngaphambi kokuba ilungiswe"" and ""uncike ezikhulwini zombuso, ezazingabambisani izikhathi ezingi...ukuphoqelela yonke imithetho yawo."" This shows the difficulty in passing laws due to the requirement for unanimous consent and the lack of a central authority.
* **Option A, ""Ukugadwa okukhulu okubuya emthethweni wesizwe,""** refers to a major authority *reasserting* its power.  The passage describes a *lack* of a strong central authority, not one attempting to reassert itself.

Let's look at why the other options *are* weaknesses described in the passage:

* **B: Ukuswela amandla phakathi kwenhlangano:** The passage mentions the lack of a strong central government and the difficulties in getting all the states to cooperate, implying a struggle for power.
* **C: Imithetho edinga ukuvunyelwa abantu abangaziwa:** This refers to the requirement for unanimous consent from all states, which is a significant obstacle.
* **D: Isikhulu sezwe esingekho:** The passage refers to the lack of a strong central government and the lack of power to enforce laws, which implies a weak executive branch or ""no national head.""



Therefore, the only option that doesn't align with the weaknesses described in the passage is A."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ukuphi okuyiqiniso okuveza imiso sikahumeleni phakathi nesikhati nempi yokulwela Inkuleleko?","The correct answer is **B: Imithetho nezihloko bebethembele emagunyeni yomhlango.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ukukhokha intela, futhi, ngenxa yokuthi bokungekho sigungu sezwe noma noma isigungu sokwahlulela, uncike ezikhulwini zombuso, ezazingabambisani izikhathi ezingi, ukuphoqelela yonke imithetho yawo."" This means the Articles of Confederation relied heavily on the authority of the states (specifically, the state legislatures) to enforce laws, especially regarding taxes.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ukukhokha intela kwaphoqwa iCongress namagunya wezwe:** The passage says the *national* government (Congress) *could not* levy taxes.
    * **C: Abameli besizwe bebeshoda ngokuma kwabo:** The passage doesn't state that the representatives were weak; it highlights the *difficulty* in getting them to agree on anything.
    * **D: Uhulumeni ophakathi bewunezinxenye izimbili:** The passage describes the Articles of Confederation as a *single* government structure, though one with limited powers.



"
Amazwi asemuva kweDeclaration of Independence abhalwe kanjani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ibheke phansi**.

The text states: ""Umbhalo ovela ekugcineni kwencwadi, obheke phansi."" which translates to ""The text from the end of the book, facing down.""

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
ISingapore idume ngaziphi izinto ezilandelayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Idholobha elehlaza mgombala (The City in a Garden)**.

The text highlights the Singapore Botanic Gardens and how they contributed to transforming Singapore into a ""City in a Garden,"" emphasizing its green spaces and botanical importance. The mention of the Vanda orchid being chosen as a national symbol further reinforces this.
"
Yini iVanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **D: Indawo yezwe ehlonishwayo**

Here's why:

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim was *chosen as the national flower* of Singapore.  A national flower is a symbol of a country and is therefore a place of national significance and honor.  The other options don't accurately reflect what the text says.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi esimo seGiza pyramids ebesengeke sicaze i-New Kingdom Egyptians?","The correct answer is **A: Iminyaka yabo**.

The passage states: ""The pyramids of Giza remained unsurpassed in size and technical skill even at the end of the Old Kingdom. The New Kingdom Egyptians looked back at their forebears, whose monuments were over a thousand years old at that time."" This indicates the New Kingdom Egyptians were impressed by the **age** of the Giza pyramids.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, izilwane ezidla uhlaza zisuka kuphi ukuze zithole imvula?","The correct answer is **D: Izintaba zetshonalanga**.

The passage states: ""Minyaka yonke ngabo-Okthoba izilwane ezidla imifino ezicishe zibe yizigidi ezingu-1,5 ziyahamba zibheke emathafeni aseningizimu, ziwela uMfula i-Mara, zisuka emagqumeni asenyakatho ukuze zitole imvula. Futhi emuva enyakatho ngasentshonalanga, ukweqa umfula iMara futhi, ngemva kwezimvula cishe zango April.""  This means the animals migrate *from* the northern plains *to* the southern plains to get rain. And then return north after the rains. The passage explicitly mentions they come from the northern plains (""emagqumeni asenyakatho""). Therefore, the answer is the northern plains.

Looking at the options provided, the closest fit is **D: Izintaba zetshonalanga**. While the passage doesn't directly say ""northern mountains"", it indicates they originate from the northern plains and migrate southward to get rain. The northern plains are generally located near mountains.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi indawo lapho izilwane ezidla imifino eziyishiyayo ngo-April?","The correct answer is **D: IMaasai Mara National Reserve**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Futhi emuva enyakatho ngasentshonalanga, ukweqa umfula iMara futhi, ngemva kwezimvula cishe zango April. Indawo yaseSerengeti ineSerengeti National Park, iNgorongoro Conservation Area kanye neMaswa Game Reserve eTanzania kanye neMaasai Mara National Reserve eKenya.""

This indicates the animals return to the Maasai Mara National Reserve in April after the rains.
"
Uhlelo lweSealion bewukuvinjezelwa kwayiphi ilizwe?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Britain**.

The text explicitly states that ""IJalimane yaqala ukuzilungiselela ukuhlasela isiqhingi sase-Britain"" and that ""Operation Sealion"" was the codename for the planned invasion of Britain.
"
Ukuhlaselwa kwamaBrithani iJalimane yakubuza ngokuthi yini?,"The correct answer is **B: Uhlelo lweSealion**.

The text explicitly states: ""IJalimane libize ukuhlasela ngegama eliyisifekethiso elithi """"Operation Sealion"""".""  This means ""Operation Sealion"" was the name of the planned invasion of Britain by Germany.
"
Yini okungavezwanga njengoba kusinyathelo esibalukile ohlelweni lwase-Italy lokuvimbezela amazwe wase-Africa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukusungula indawo lapho amasosha azosukela khona.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Italy needed a staging point to deploy troops to Africa.  The passage highlights the importance of neutralizing British and Egyptian military forces *to facilitate* troop transport. It doesn't mention establishing a base of operations *in Africa* where troops could be launched.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukususa amikhumbi yaseGibhite:** The passage explicitly states that neutralizing Egyptian military forces was necessary.
*   **B: Ukwakha imikhumbu eningeleziwe:** The passage mentions Italy building new warships but doesn't say they built *English* warships. The focus is on neutralizing the British fleet.
*   **D: Ukumosha isisekelo samaNgisi:** While not explicitly stated, neutralizing British military forces inherently involves disrupting their bases and operations.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kwakuyini umgomo we-Italy ngempi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuthumba izizwe zase-Africa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Izinhloso eziphambili zase-Italy kwakungamazwe ase-Afrika."" (Italy's main goals were African countries.)  The passage further explains *why* they wanted to conquer Africa – to establish bases for launching troops via the Mediterranean.
"
Ubani owasungula ubudlelwane bobungani nabahlaseli?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Vichy French**.

The passage states that the Vichy French made peace with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the enemy instead of fighting them. Therefore, the Vichy French were the ones who initiated the friendly relationship with the aggressors (Germans).
"
Obani okungabasizi lohlelo lweDragoon?,"The correct answer is **A: AmaMelika neFree French**.

Here's why:

*   The question states that the US and Free French forces *liberated* southern France during Operation Dragoon. Therefore, they were the ones *conducting* the operation, not hindering it.
*   The Vichy French were the ones *opposing* the liberation.
*   The Germans were the ones being defeated.

Therefore, the US and Free French were actively involved in the operation, not hindering it."
Ukuthuthukiswa kwezobucwepheshe kubangele ukuba ama-submarine akwazi ukuhamba ngaphansi kwamanzi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuqondiswa kwendlela (Navigation)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that as radar technology improved, U-boats had to operate underwater to avoid detection. This implies that advancements in **navigation** (the ability to steer and control the submarine underwater) were crucial for their effectiveness. 
* The passage highlights the Germans' skill in controlling and utilizing these submarines underwater. This control would have been heavily reliant on advanced navigation systems.
* While other options are related to submarines, they aren't the direct reason *why* they could operate underwater effectively. 
    * **A: U-Boats** is a type of submarine, not the technology enabling underwater travel.
    * **B: Ibanga elidubulekayo (Depth charge)** is a weapon used *by* submarines, not a factor in their underwater movement.
    * **D: iRadar (Radar)** is a detection technology that *forced* submarines to operate underwater, but it wasn't the reason *why* they could do so.



"
"Ukusetshenjiwa kwawo kokuqala, ama-submarine bekanobubanzi obulinganiswe kuyiphi indawo?","The correct answer is **C: Ukudubula**.

The passage states: ""Imikhumbi yangaphansi kwamanzi yayisetshenziswa eMpini Yezwe I kanye naseMpini Yezwe II. Ngaleso sikhathi yayihamba kancane kakhulu futhi beyikwazi ukudubula ibanga elifishane."" This directly indicates that their initial use was for **shooting/attacking (ukudubula)**.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owaphula isivumelwano? ","The correct answer is **D: I-Soviet**.

The passage states: ""...amasosha angaphezu kuka-800,000 asuka kuyiSoviet's Union Red Army engena akha amabutho waseBelarussia ne-Ukraine...engena akha amabutho waseBelarussia ne-Ukraine ngemva kokuhlasela izindawo ezingasempumalanga zasePoland ephula Isivumelwano Sokuthula seRiga, i-Soveiet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact...""

This clearly indicates that the Soviet Red Army broke the Non-Aggression Pact.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungazange kwathwalwa iRed Army?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuvinjezelwa kwezizwe ezise-mpumalanga (The violation of eastern territories)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Red Army violated the Riga Treaty (which ended the Polish-Soviet War) and other international treaties, invading eastern Poland. This directly corresponds to the ""violation of eastern territories.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukwenziwa kwe-Ukrainian front (The creation of the Ukrainian front):** The passage describes the Red Army's advance into Ukraine, implying the creation of a front *in* Ukraine.
*   **C: Ukuhlwa kabusha ngasohlangathini lwekhanda lebhuloho (The revival of the anti-bullet head):** This is nonsensical and not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Ukuphulwa kwesivumelwano (The violation of the agreement):** While technically true, ""violation of eastern territories"" is a more specific and accurate description of what the Red Army *did*.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the passage."
Kwenzekani ngoEngineer-in-Chief we-Italian Tenth Army?,"The correct answer is **C: Wabanjwa amaNgisi**.

The text states: ""Phakathi neviki lokumemezela kweNtaliyane impi ngoJuni 10, 1940, amaBritish 11th Hussar ayethumbe iFort Capuzzo eLibya. Ekuqamekeleni kwasempumalanga yeBardia, abaseBhrithani bathumba uNjiniyela Oyinhloko weButho Leshumi womNtaliyane, uJenene Lastucci.""  This directly translates to ""During the week of Italy's declaration of war on June 10, 1940, the British 11th Hussar captured Engineer-in-Chief of the Italian Tenth Army, General Lastucci.""
"
Wabulawela kuphi uItalo Balbo?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Tobruk**.

The text states: ""Ngomhlaka 28 kuNhlangulana 28, u-Marshal Italo Balbo, uMbusi-Jikelele wase-Libya, wabulawa ngephutha ngozakwabongenkathi efika e-Tobruk ngendiza.""
"
"Ngokuya kwaloshu, iziphi izindlela ezilandelayo okuyinto ebalulekile yokuzindla kweTibetan?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuphrakthiza ukuphefumula (Practicing breathing)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngokuyisisekelo ubuBuddha baseTibet bulula kakhulu. Buhlanganisa iKundalini Yoga, **ukuzindla** kanye nendlela yothando olwamukela konke. Ngokwe-Kundali Yoga amandla e-Kundali (amandla okukhanyisa) avuselelwa ngoku **uzivocavoca ngohlobo lwe-yoga, ukuzivocavoca kokuphefumula, amazwi aphindwaphindwayo kanye nokubona ngeso lengqondo.**""

While options B, C, and D are all elements of Tibetan healing, the text highlights breathing as a key practice within Kundalini Yoga, which is fundamental to Tibetan Buddhism's healing methods.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ama-chakras avuleka kanjani “phakathi” nokuzindla kweTibetan?","The correct answer is **B: Ngokubona ngeso lenqgondo izinkolo (Through psychic vision)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngokubona ngeso lengqondo izithixo ezahlukahlukene imizila yamandla iba ehlanzekile, ama-chakra enziwa ukuthi asebenze futhi ukukhanya kokubakhona kuyakhiwa."" (Through psychic vision, the various deities purify the channels of energy, the chakras are activated, and the light of rebirth is built.)

While the other options are mentioned as parts of Tibetan healing practices, they are not the primary method for opening chakras according to this passage. Psychic vision is the key mechanism described.
"
Ubuni othule ingoma yesibili phakathi nomhlangano?,"The correct answer is **D: uJai Shankar Choudhary**.

The passage states: ""Umculi uSanju Sharma bekunguye oqalile kusihlwa, elandelwa uJai Shankar Choudhary."" This means Jai Shankar Choudhary was the second performer after Sanju Sharma.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani othule ingoma ngesikhathi kunikelwa ukudla?","The correct answer is **A: uLakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Ngakho, uLakkha Singh uholile ekuculeni i-bhajans."" This translates to ""Therefore, Lakkha Singh led the singing of bhajans."" and later ""uLakkha Singh wanikezela ngange-Chhappan bhog bhajan."" which translates to ""Lakkha Singh offered a Chhappan bhog bhajan."" This indicates that Lakkha Singh was the one singing bhajans when the food offering (Chhappan Bhog) was made.
"
Ubani odlale ekugcineni ebusuku?,"The correct answer is **B: Umlilo wase-Anatolia**.

The passage states: ""Ukuqedela, iqembu labadansi laseTheki uMlilo ka-Anatolia lenza umboniso we-“Troy”.""  This means they were the final act.
"
Uvela kuliphi izwe uAlessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Greek**.

The text states ""omculi wetena u-Alessandro Safina nomculi womGriki uHaris Alexiou,"" which directly indicates that Alessandro Safina is Greek.
"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, isiphi isitatimende okungesona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Kuthethe imizuzu eyi-60 ukuze bakhiphe umgibeli okuqala.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...and it took at least an hour to get the first person off the ride."" This directly contradicts option D which states ""Kuthethe imizuzu eyi-60"" (It took 60 minutes).

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the passage:

* **A: Bekunomlilo eSanta Clara** - The passage mentions the heat and the fire department responding, implying a situation requiring their presence, though it doesn't explicitly state there was an actual fire.
* **B: Abantu bebemile ku-roller coaster** - The passage says people were waiting in a hot environment, implying they were on a ride, likely a roller coaster.
* **C: Abagibeli bebenikwe amanzi** - The passage explicitly states ""Abagibeli banikwa amanzi njengoba belinde ekushiseni..."" (Passengers were given water as they waited in the heat...).



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owabeka umbono mayelana namazinga okushisa angathandeki?","The correct answer is **B: Ukaputeni womlilo**. 

The text states, ""Ukaputeni wezomlilo uScott Kouns uthe..."" which directly indicates that Scott Kouns, the fire marshal, is the one who expressed the opinion about the uncomfortable heat.
"
Ugesi ucime kuphi ngenxa kokubakhona kwe-tsunami?,"The correct answer is **A: isiTonga**.

The text states: ""Awukho umonakalo omkhulu noma ukulimala okubikiwe eTonga, kodwa ugesi ubungekho okwesikhashana, lokho okubikwa ukuthi kuvimebele iziphathimandla zaseTonga ekutholeni isexwayiso setsunami esikhishwe iPTWC."" This directly indicates that Tonga experienced a power outage due to the tsunami.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iTonga yathinteka kanjani ekuhambeni kukagesi?","The correct answer is **D: Iziphathi mandla azikwazanga ukuthola ukuxwayisa okudingekile.**

The passage states: ""...ugesi ubungekho okwesikhashana, lokho okubikwa ukuthi kuvimebele iziphathimandla zaseTonga ekutholeni isexwayiso setsunami esikhishwe iPTWC."" This directly indicates that the power outage prevented the authorities from receiving the tsunami warning.
"
Kunini lapho amaphoyisa akwazi ukusebenzisa izibhamu zabo zokubona isivivini sika Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngesikhathi sesikhombisa ngemva kwebhuloho**.

The text states: ""Amaphoyisa aseNyuzilandi abenenkinga yokusebenzisa izibhamu zawo zokubona isivinini ukubona ukuthi uMnu Reid wayeshesha kangakanani ngenxa yendlela i-Black Beauty ephansi ngayo, **okuwukuphela kwesikhathi lapho amaphoyisa ekwaze ukubona isivinini sikaMnu Reid bekuyilapho enciphisa isivinini eya ku-160km/h.**""

This means the police could only get a reading when he slowed down to 160km/h *after* going over the bridge.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani kwakunzima ngamaphoyisa ase-New Zealand ukuba abone isivinini sikaJonny Reid?","The correct answer is **A: Bekahamba ngaphansana kwe160km/h**.

The passage states: ""Amaphoyisa aseNyuzilandi abenenkinga yokusebenzisa izibhamu zawo zokubona isivinini ukubona ukuthi uMnu Reid wayeshesha kangakanani ngenxa yendlela i-Black Beauty ephansi ngayo..."" This means the car's low profile made it difficult for the police radar to accurately measure the speed because it was traveling *faster than* 160km/h.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Imoto beyihamba kancani** - The passage explicitly says the car was traveling very fast.
* **C: Uhambe kuleli bhuloho ngaphezu kwezinkathi eziyisikhombisa** -  While he did drive over the bridge multiple times, this doesn't explain why the police had trouble measuring his speed.
* **D: I-Auckland Harbour Bridge yindala kakhulu** - The age of the bridge is irrelevant to the police's difficulty measuring the speed.



"
Ukuzama zama komhlaba bekukuphi eButte?,"The correct answer is **B: Amamayela angu40 eningizimu**.

The text states: ""cishe nama-65 km (amamayela angu-40) eningizimu neButte.""
"
Kwenzekani ngesiteleka esiseAbu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlukunyezwa kwesiboshwa** (Prisoner abuse).

The question states that Abu Ghraib prison became notorious *after* it was discovered that prisoners were being abused by US soldiers. The other options are not directly related to the main reason for Abu Ghraib's notoriety.
"
Kungani ijele lase Iraqi naqala ukusatshwa kakhulu? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ukutholwa kokuhlukunyezwa kweziboshwa**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *why* the prison became infamous. The provided text explicitly states the prison gained notoriety *after* the discovery of prisoner abuse. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lashiswa (Destroyed)** - While the prison was eventually destroyed, that's a consequence of the notoriety, not the initial reason for it.
* **B: Amautho wase-US aqala ukulawula (US soldiers started to control)** - While US soldiers did take control, it wasn't the primary reason for the prison's infamy. The abuse happened *because* of that control.
* **C: Bekuneziteleka eziningi (There were many traditions)** - This option is irrelevant to the context of the prison's infamous reputation.



"
Hlobo luni lomcimbi okwakumelwe libe khona eMaui's War Memorial Stadium?,"The correct answer is **C: Ikhonsathi**.

The text states the stadium was supposed to host a ""bukiso"" which translates to ""show"" or ""performance."" Given the large attendance of 9,000 people and the context of a cancellation, a concert is the most likely type of event.
"
Ubani owanikeza isizathu mayelana nokukhanselwa komcimbi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikhampani yabaphathi (HK Management Inc.)**.

The text states: ""Inkampani yokuphatha amabhendi, iHK Ubuphathi Inc., ayinikanga isizathu sasekuqaleni sokukhansela ngoSeptemba 20..."".  This directly indicates that HK Management Inc. is the one who initially refused to give a reason. While they later provided a reason, the initial refusal came from them.
"
Abahlali abambalwa beBishkek bacabanga ukuthi ubani imbangela yokuphanga?,"The correct answer is **C: Ababikishi**.

The text states: ""Abahlali abaningana baseBishkek bathwese ababhikishi abasuka eningizimu icala lokwephulwa komthetho."" This translates to ""Many residents of Bishkek blamed the homeless people from the south for the lawlessness."" Therefore, residents blamed the homeless people (ababikishi) for the looting.
"
Obani abasole ababikishi ababuya ngase-ningizimu ngokuphanga?,"The correct answer is **A: Abahlali beBishkek**

The text explicitly states: """"Abahlali abaningana baseBishkek bathwese ababhikishi abasuka eningizimu icala lokwephulwa komthetho."" (Many residents of Bishkek accused the beggars coming from the south of violating the law.)

Therefore, the Bishkek residents are the ones accusing the beggars."
Kunini lapho uRing ebona ukunyuka kwama kwezokuthengisa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngemva kokuvela kuShark Tank**.

The text states: ""USminoff uthe izintengo zanyuka ngemva kokuvela kwakhe embukwisweni we-Shark Tank ngo-2013..."" which directly indicates the sales increase happened after appearing on Shark Tank. While options B and C are related events, the text explicitly links the price increase to Shark Tank. Option D is incorrect as the lawsuit with ADT happened later.
"
Kunini lapho uJamie Simioff ecabange ukuqala iRing?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngemva kokubona ukuthi isicabha sakhe asisafaneleki (After seeing that his front door wasn't secure).**

The text states: ""Phambilini, isikhulu esiphezulu sakwa-Ring, u-Jamie Siminoff, sathi le nkampani yaqala ngenkathi kungezwakali ukuthi kukhona ongqongqozayo emnyango uma esesitolo sakhe esisegalaji lakhe."" (Previously, Ring's CEO, Jamie Siminoff, said the company started when he noticed that there was a lack of security at his garage store front door.)
"
Uhlelo ngalunye lweReading Rainbow linikeze abantwana maphi amacebiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Izincwadi**.

The passage states: ""Uhlelo ngalunye luzotusa izincwadi lezo izingane okumelwe zizibheke lapho ziye elabhulali yazo."" This directly indicates that each episode of Reading Rainbow suggests books for children to read.
"
Yini eyaholela ekuthenini ihlelo leReading Rainbow livalwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukungabi nemali eyanele.**

The text explicitly states: """"Kholelwa abanye, kuhlanganise noJohn Grant, ukuthi ukusweleka okukhulu kwemali kanye nokushintsha kwefilosofi yezinhlelo zemfundo zethelevishini kube nomthelela ekupheleni kwezinhlelo ezilandelanayo."""" This directly points to financial constraints as a major factor.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo kwakungekona ukubanga okwenziwa abaphathi be-Amsterdam nemnuziyamu maqondana nesihlahla?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukugcineni izowa (Letting it be)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the city of Amsterdam and the Anne Frank Museum deemed the fungus a hazard to the public due to the risk of rapid decay. They were scheduled to be assessed but the assessment was postponed due to an emergency court decision. The other options (B, C, and D) all reflect concerns about managing the fungus – it needs to be stored, it's unstable, and it's a danger to people.  ""Letting it be"" contradicts the stated concern that it's a hazard and a potential risk.



"
"Ngokuya kwesikhulu esihlolayo seRSPCA, ukuhlola kumelwe kube into ekhona njalo ngenxa yaziphi izizathu ezilandelayo?","The correct answer is **B: Khona osebenza ngezilwane**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ukugadwa nokuhlolwa kwamadela kumelwe kube yinto evamile e-Australia.""  Davide O’Shannessy, the CEO of RSPCA NSW, says this is necessary because it will send a ""strong signal to people who work with animals that the welfare of their animals is paramount."" This implies the testing and inspection are needed *because* people work with animals – to ensure they are acting ethically and providing good care.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ama-khamera weCCTV:** While CCTV is mentioned as *part* of the solution, the text doesn't say the testing and inspection are *because* of the cameras themselves.
*   **C: Ukufaka kwamakhamera wokugada:** Same reasoning as A. Cameras are a tool to *facilitate* the testing/inspection, not the reason *why* it's necessary.
*   **D: Indawo yokuhlinza:** This is irrelevant to the text. The article discusses animal welfare, not cleaning facilities.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini engasiza iqinise ukubaluleka kwenhlalakahle yezilalwane kubahlinzi base-Australia?","The correct answer is **A: Ukufakwa kwama khamera yeCCTV**.

The text explicitly states that the RSPCA is advocating for the installation of CCTV cameras throughout Australia to help ensure animal welfare.  The quote from David O'Shannessy directly links the cameras to providing a strong visual deterrent for those working with animals.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuba nemihlangano edingekile neRSPCA** - While meetings with the RSPCA might be helpful, the text focuses on the CCTV cameras as the primary solution.
*   **C: Abahloli bezindawo zokuhlinza abajwayelekile** - The text doesn't mention the frequency of inspections.
*   **D: Ukwengamela okubuya e-ABC** -  The report being aired on ABC is simply a way the RSPCA is raising awareness, not a solution for ensuring animal welfare.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, uyini umsebenzi womuntu oboshiwe?","The correct answer is **A: Umfundi**.

The text states: ""...one student is being held in connection with the school shooting on March 21."" Therefore, the person being held is a student.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, njengoba izindaba bezigcwele ngokunye ukuboshwa,kwakukhona imigcwabo yezisulu eziyingakhi?","The correct answer is **B: Kuthathu**.

The text explicitly states ""... kanye nezisulu ezintathu kweziyisishiyagalolunye zaziqhubeka..."" which translates to ""...and three victims of the age of sixteen continue..."" meaning there were three victims.
"
"Ngokuphendula isiteleka, yiliphi izwe elingazange liqhubeke ngesivumelwano esisayiniwe seACTA?","The correct answer is **B: i-Poland**.

The text states: ""Ngenyanga edlule, bekunokubhikisha okukhulu e-Poland lapho lelozwe lisayina i-ACTA, okwaholela ekubeni uhulumeni wase-Poland unqume ukungamukeli isivumelwano, okwamanje."" This means Poland signed ACTA but then *decided not to accept* it.

The text explicitly states that Poland decided *not to accept* the ACTA agreement. Therefore, it is the only country listed that did not fully embrace the agreement.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yimaphi amazwe alandelayo anquma ukuyekela inqubo yokujoyina i-ACTA?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The text states: ""ILatvia neSlovakia zombili zilibazise inqubo yokujoyina i-ACTA. Ngenyanga edlule, bekunokubhikisha okukhulu e-Poland lapho lelozwe lisayina i-ACTA, okwaholela ekubeni uhulumeni wase-Poland unqume ukungamukeli isivumelwano, okwamanje.""

While Slovakia also announced it would join, Latvia is listed as one of the countries that announced it would *reject* the process of joining. The options provided only list Latvia. The other options (Estonia, Lithuania, and Scotland) are mentioned as locations of protests but not as countries that rejected ACTA.
"
Bangaki abantu abalimala ngemiphumela yokushisa kakhulu kwama iPod?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...and left four people with minor burns.""
"
Ubani owathi izigameko zokushisa kakhulu azikababuleki?,"The correct answer is **D: i-Apple**.

The text states: ""Ngeviki elidlule, iMETI imemezele ukuthi i-Apple iyazise ngezigameko zokushisa ngokweqile ezengeziwe ezingu-34, lezo inkampani ezibize ngokuthi """"into engeyona enkulu."""" "" This directly indicates that Apple considered the excessive heat issues to be ""not a big deal.""
"
"Phakathi nenkulumo, utheni uSteve Jobs nge-Apple mayelana nokwenziwa futhi?","The correct answer is **A: Umlando**.

The quote says: """"Namuhla i-Apple izokwakha ngenye indlela ifoni, Sizokwenza umlando namuhla"""" which translates to ""Today Apple will create a new way of the phone, We will make history today."" 

Therefore, the answer is **A: Umlando** (History).
"
Kwakuyini injongo yenkulumo kaSteve Jobs yamahora amabili?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukukhipha i-phone entsha**.

The text explicitly states that Steve Jobs presented the iPhone and said, ""Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone..."" This directly indicates the goal of his two-hour presentation was to launch a new phone.
"
Yini uCristina Fernandez de Krichner ayisho eArgentine Theatre?,"The correct answer is **A: Ithuba lakhe lokuba wumongameli**.

The text states: ""UNkk. Kirchner umemezelo inhloso yakhe yokukhankasela ukuba umongameli eThiyetheni yase-Ajenthina..."" which translates to ""Ms. Kirchner announced her intention to campaign to become president at the Argentinian Theatre...""

Therefore, she announced her candidacy for president.
"
Usenze kuphi isaziso sakhe uFernandez de Kirchner sokufuna ukuphatha?,"The correct answer is **A: E-theatre eqele ngama mayili angu-31 kuLa Plata**

The text states: ""Ilungu lesigele lamanje noNkosikazi kaMongameli wase-Argentina uCristina Fernandez de Kirchner umemezele ukungenela kwakhe ukhetho lokuba umongameli izolo ntambama eLa Plata, idolobha elingamakhilomitha angu-50 (amamayela angu-31) kusuka eBuenos Aires."" This directly translates to ""The current vice president and First Lady of Argentina, Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her intention to run for president last night in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires.""  Option A accurately reflects this information.
"
Yini okutholwe yi-ACMA mayelana neBig Brother?,"The correct answer is **B: Izithombe namavidiyo kwatholwa kubekwe kuwubhusayithi yeBig Brother.**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""I-ACMA iphinde yathola ukuthi ngaphezu kokuboniswa kwevidiyo kuyi-inthanethi, i-Big Brother ayiphulanga imithetho yokubonisa izinto kuyi-inthanethi njengoba okwakuboniswa bekungagcinwanga ewebhusayithini ye-Big Brother."" This directly indicates that the content was found on the Big Brother website.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umthetho wokufihla ulwimi olungahlanzekile awuphulwanga:** The text doesn't mention anything about language laws.
*   **C: Imithetho wokufihla ulwimi olungahlanzekile iphuliwe:** Again, the text doesn't mention anything about language laws being violated.
*   **D: Udaba lwatholwa luhlezi ngokoqobo ku-server:** While the text mentions the need for content to be on a real server to be considered online content, it doesn't state that this was the specific finding regarding Big Brother. The key finding was that content was *on the Big Brother website*.



"
I-Media kumelwe ibe kuyiphi imincele ukuze kuthiwe izinto ze-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kumelwe ihlale ngokoqobo ku-server**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ukuze kuthathwe njengokuquketho kwe-inthanethi, kumelwe kuhlale kuyi-server ngokoqobo.""  This means the content must be actively hosted on a server to be considered online content under the Broadcasting Services Act.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kumelwe isakazwe ku-inthanethi:** While streaming is online, simply streaming isn't the defining factor. The content needs to be *hosted* on a server.
* **C: Ayikwazi ukubekwa ku-webhusayithi:**  Content *can* be on a website, but only if that website is actively hosted and accessible (i.e., running on a server).  The presence of a website isn't enough.
* **D: Kumelwe igunyazwe yi-ACMA:**  While ACMA enforces the rules, the act of being hosted on a server is the primary requirement, not just authorization.



Therefore, the key requirement for content to be considered ""online content"" under the Act is that it must be hosted on a real server."
Ubani umholi weLiberal Party?,"The correct answer is **A: uPeter Costello**.

The passage explicitly states: ""UMnu Costello ukusho lokho lapho kuzalwa amandla enuzi iba namandla kwezomnotho, i-Australia kufanele iphishekele ukusetshenziswa kwayo."" and ""...njengomholi weqembu i-Liberal ubonise ukweseka kwakhe..."" This clearly identifies Peter Costello as the leader of the Liberal Party."
Kungani i-Australia inganawo imboni ye-nuclear?,"Based on the provided text, the answer is **C: Ngozi kakhulu (Too dangerous)**.

Here's why:

* The quote from Peter Costello says, ""Uma ethengiswa, kumelwe sibe nawo. Okungukuthi, akukho ukwenqaba okuyisimiso amandla wenuzi"" which translates to ""If it's sold, we should have it. That is to say, there is no moral objection to nuclear power."" This implies that the main hurdle isn't public opposition, disagreement, or economic concerns, but rather a perceived lack of a moral objection to nuclear power. The implication is the *danger* associated with nuclear power is the primary reason Australia doesn't have an industry.

The other options are less supported by the text:

* **A: Ukuswela isekelo lomphakathi (Lack of public support):** The text doesn't mention a lack of public support. Costello is advocating *for* nuclear power.
* **B: Ukungavumelani okukhulu (Widespread disagreement):** While there might be disagreement, the quote focuses on the potential benefits and lack of moral objection, not widespread disagreement.
* **D: Ibiza kakhulu (Too expensive):** The quote doesn't mention cost as a factor.



"
Yimuphi umshushuluzu owaqeda ngosizo lweziqondiso?,"The correct answer is **C: uMaciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Umshushuluzi waseqhweni wase-Poland wesigaba sabesilisa abangaboni kahle u-Maciej Krezel nomqondisi u-Anna Ogarzynska uqede endaweni yeshumi nantathu kuyi-Super-G."" This indicates that Maciej Krezel was the guide who finished in 13th place with the support of his guides.
"
Iliphi izwe laqeda endaweni yesishumi ku-Super-G yabesifazane?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Netherlands**.

The text states: ""i-Netherlands, ngo-Anna Jochemsen oqede endaweni yesishiyagalolunye esigabeni sabesifazane abamile kuyiSuper-G izolo..."" which means Anna Jochemsen from the Netherlands finished in 16th place in the women's Super-G.

The text also says ""Finland ngoKatja Saarinen oqede endaweni yeshumi emdlalweni ofanayo."" meaning Katja Saarinen from Finland finished in 10th place in the same race.

Therefore, the question asks about the country that finished in 10th place in Super-G for women. The answer is Finland. However, Finland is not among the options, and the question asks about Super-G for women. The question is asking about the race in general, not specifically for women.

The question is asking about the country that finished in 10th place in Super-G for women. The text says ""Finland ngoKatja Saarinen oqede endaweni yeshumi emdlalweni ofanayo"", which means Finland, Katja Saarinen, finished in 10th place in the same race. Since Finland is among the options, it is the correct answer.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okushiwo ngoBlake okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Wavuma ukuthi uhlaselile.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the broadcaster **denied the assault** and said he used pepper spray to defend himself.
* Option B states that Blake *admitted* to the assault, which is the opposite of what the passage says.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Waboshelwa endaweni enze ikulo icala:** The passage states he was arrested *at the scene* of the incident. This is consistent with the information given.
* **C: Wasebenzisa ipali ukuze ashaye:** The passage explicitly states he used pepper spray.
* **D: Uthe bebemujikijela ngamabhodlela:** The passage mentions he was thrown against bottles.
"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, ikuphi okulandeyo okungenzekanga kuBlake?","The correct answer is **A: Watholwa anecala lokuziphatha okuphula umthetho**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Blake was charged with attempting to obstruct justice. This directly implies he was charged with a crime.
* The passage says he was arrested (""iboshiwe"").
* The passage mentions he was attacked with bottles.
* The passage indicates he was told he would likely go to jail (""cishe kwakungagwemeki ukuthi uzothunyelwa ejele"").

Therefore, the only action *not* mentioned is being charged with a crime. While it's highly likely he was charged with obstructing justice, the passage doesn't explicitly state that. The other options are all explicitly mentioned.
"
Ukutholwa kwemali Yenhlangano Yezizwe Ezihlangene yokufudumala kwembulunga ngeke isetshenziswe kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukwabelana ngezobuchwepheshe ukusiza amazwe athuthukayo.**

The passage explicitly states that funding will be used for things like ""ukwabelana ngezobuchwepheshe ukusiza amazwe athuthukayo ukuba akhule ngezindlela ezingangcolisi kakhulu"" (sharing technology to help developing countries grow in a less polluting way). Therefore, it *will* be used for this.

The passage *does* say that funding will be used for:

*   Izidlu ezingakhukhuleki (non-climate resilient housing)
*   Indlela yokuphatha amanzi engcono (better water management)
*   Izinhlobonhlobo zezitshalo (various types of plants)
*   Ukunciphisa izinkinga ezithintwe ukufudumala kwembulunga (mitigating the impacts of climate change)

Therefore, option B is the only one that is *not* mentioned as a potential use of the funds.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi iNhlangano Yezizwe Ezihlangane efisa ukukusiza?","The correct answer is **D: Abantu abathinteka mayelana nendlela yokuphatha amanzi engcono.**

The passage states: ""Inhlangano Yezizwe Ezihlangene ifuna ukuqedela isikhwama sokusiza amazwe athintwe ukufudumala kwembulunga yonke ukuba abhekane namathonya.""  This indicates the UN is aiming to help *people* affected by climate change.  The passage also mentions using funds for ""indlela yokuphatha amanzi engcono"" (better water management).

While options A, B, and C are mentioned as areas where the money *could* be used, the UN's *target* is the people impacted by climate change.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okwacaphunwa u-Albert Muchanga njengento okumelwe idingwe sivumelane nayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umsuka womthetho**.

Here's why:

The passage states: """"Asikavumelani ngokuthi izothini imithetho yesiqalo nokuncishiswa kwamanani wezimpahla ezilethwa ezweni..."""".  This directly indicates disagreement regarding the **rules of origin**, which fall under the legal framework of the agreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukube iBenin ingajoyina i-AfCTA** - The passage states Benin *has* joined.
* **B: Ukusuku lapho kungaqalisa i-trading** - The passage says trading *can* start on July 1, 2020, regardless of the legal details.
* **D: Izikhathi zokukhokha kwentela** - This is not mentioned as an area of disagreement.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kungani itrading ingaqala ngoJuly?","The correct answer is **B: Kunokuhleleka okuthile nemithetho kuhlanganise nenokuvumelana.**

Here's why:

The text states: """"Asikavumelani ngokuthi izothini imithetho yesiqalo nokuncishiswa kwamanani wezimpahla ezilethwa ezweni, **ngakho kepha isimiso esinaso sanele ukuqala ukuhweba ngomhlaka-1 July, 2020**"""" (We do not agree on the rules of origin and the reduction of tariffs on goods brought into the country, **but the framework we have is sufficient to start trading on July 1, 2020**).

This clearly indicates that despite disagreements on specific details, a framework *was established*, allowing trade to begin. Options A, C, and D are not directly supported by the text.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, i- Atlanta Journal-Constitution ithwesa bani kubaphathi yezefundo?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuhluleka ukuthuthukisa imfundo endaweni zasedolobheni**.

Here's why: The passage states that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution published an article revealing concerns about the test score increases and *accused* the school system of failing to address internal problems. This implies a failure to improve education in the city. While option C is partially true (they didn't address internal problems), option A captures the broader accusation made by the newspaper regarding their overall performance in urban education.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuhluleka ukuthuthukisa imfundo endaweni zasedolobheni** - While technically correct in that the newspaper accused them of this, A is a more direct reflection of the language used.
* **C: Akwenziwe lutho ekuboneni izikinga ezingaphakathi** - This is a component of the accusation, but not the main thrust of the newspaper's criticism.
* **D: Ukubika inani eliphansi ku-test** - The article actually reported *increased* test scores, which is what made the newspaper suspicious.



"
"Ngokuya ngalokho okunikeziwe kulo musho, ukuphi okungaqinisekiswanga kumbiko weAtlanta Journal-Constitution?","The correct answer is **B: Ubufakazi bokuthi amaphepha we-test aphazamisiwe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the article *alleged* that the school had internal problems and did nothing about them, and *accused* Hall and other officials of tampering with test papers.** The word ""alleged"" is key. It means the article *claimed* something happened, but there's no definitive proof presented in the passage that the tampering actually occurred.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuthola inani elingalindelekile ku-test:** The passage explicitly states that test scores *increased rapidly* after Hall's appointment. This is a verifiable fact presented in the passage.
* **C: Owinile ku-2013’s National Superintendent:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the National Superintendent being involved or blamed.
* **D: Imibono ngokuthuthukisa imfundo emadolobheni:** The passage mentions Hall's initial success and the focus on improving urban education. This is a fact presented in the passage.



Therefore, the only claim made by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that isn't definitively supported by the evidence presented is the accusation of test paper tampering."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okwaziwayo ngokuqhum kwebhomu?","The correct answer is **B: Yimaphi amabhilidi lapho kuqhume amabhomu khona.**

Here's why:

* The question states: ""Ibhomu eyodwa iqhume ngaphandle kwehhovisi likandunankulu. Amabhomu amanye amathathu aqhumile eduze nezakhiwo zikahulumeni...""  This directly tells us the locations where the bombs detonated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isikhathi sokubala esise esisemqoka esibalulekile:** While the time frame is mentioned, it's not the primary *location* of the explosions.
* **C: Ukube amabhomu angezelelwe ayaqunyiswa:**  The text doesn't mention anything about bombs being delivered or detonated by remote control.
* **D: Inani labantu abashonile:** The question states that the official number of casualties is unconfirmed and the initial estimate is 36. Therefore, this information is not definitively known.



"
"Njengoba ajoyina i-Manchester City ngo2017, mingakhi imidlalo uJesus sekayidlalile?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Kusukela ngaleso sikhathi, umdlali waseBrazil wadlala emidlalweni engu-53 emincintiswaneni yonke..."" which translates to ""Since then, the Brazilian player has played in 53 matches in all competitions...""
"
Iliphiiqembu lebhola uJesus elafuna ukumnikela i-£27 million ngokulijoyina?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Palmeiras**.

The text states: ""...wasuka eqembini lase-Brazil i-Palmeira ngemali eyizigidi ezingu-£27.""  This means Palmeiras is the club that sold Jesus for that amount.
"
Isiphi isitatimende okungelona iqiniso mayelana nesivakashi sasehostela?,"The correct answer is **D: Iningi lezivakashi babuya edolobheni elingcwele** (Most of the visitors are returning to the holy city).

Here's why:

* The text states the hostel *hosts* visitors who are *coming* to the holy city for the upcoming Hajj pilgrimage. It doesn't say they are returning.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

* **A: Izivakashi ziye eMecca ukuze bathathe uhambo olungcwele** (Visitors have come to Mecca to perform a pilgrimage): This is directly stated in the text.
* **B: Izivakashi ezinye bekungezona izakhamuzi zendawo** (Some visitors were not locals): The text explicitly mentions that many visitors were from the United Arab Emirates.
* **C: Izivakashi bezikhona ku-eve ye-hajj** (Visitors were present on the eve of Hajj): The text says the hostel hosts visitors the day *before* the Hajj pilgrimage.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso?","The correct answer is **C: Izivakashi bezikhona ku-eve ye-hajj olungcwele**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Isakhiwo besihlalisa abahambeli ababezovakasha edolobheni elingcwele ngosuku olwandulela i-hajj pilgrimage."" This translates to ""The building houses travelers who are visiting the holy city in the day before the Hajj pilgrimage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Akekho olimele (There is no representative):**  The text doesn't mention anything about a representative.
* **B: Zonke izivakashi babuya eUnited Arab Emirates (All visitors return to the United Arab Emirates):** The text doesn't state this. They are visiting for the pilgrimage.
* **D: Iningi lezivakashi bezizakhamuzi zaseMecca (The majority of visitors are residents of Mecca):** The text states the majority are from the UAE, not Mecca.



"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, iluphi ulwazi mayelana nokushayisana okungaqondeki?","The correct answer is **A: Ubukhulu bokushayisana (The size of the collision)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that scientists are trying to determine ""ukuqhuma okudalwe ukushayisana kwakukukhulu"" (the size of the explosion caused by the collision).  The passage also mentions that the collision was ""kukhulu kangakanani ukugqubuzana"" (so significant in its energy release).

While the other options are related to the event, the passage focuses most directly on the size/magnitude of the collision itself.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, okuphi okusafanele kubhekwe ngaloku kushayisana?","The correct answer is **C: Umphulela kokuhlela kombiko kuzokwabelana.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that scientists are trying to determine **how much energy was released** and **how the Earth will be affected.** This implies a need for a report or analysis of the event.
* The passage also mentions that the results of the analysis will be published on a website.
* Therefore, a ""reporting framework"" (umphulela kokuhlela kombiko) is the most relevant element to be considered to document and share the findings of the event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ubani uzohola ekufuneni izinsalela** - While important, finding debris isn't the primary focus of the scientific investigation mentioned.
* **B: Ama-Satellites ebegijima isivinini esingakanani ngesikhathi sokushayisana** - The passage *does* mention the speed of the objects, but it doesn't say that the speed of satellites is the primary concern. It's about the impact itself.
* **D: Isikali esiqondile sokushayisa** - This refers to the missile itself, not the consequences or analysis of the event.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iyiphi indawo lapho uBatten abambe khona ilisti yabantu abaseMelika abacebile?","The correct answer is **A: yesi-400**.

The text states: ""UBatten walinganiswa ngokuthi usesikhundleni sama-190 ohlwini luka-2008 Lwabantu baseMelika Abacebe Kunabo Bonke abangu-400..."" This directly indicates that he was ranked 190th out of 400 people on the list.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okubonisa ukuthi uBatten wafaka umnikelo khona?,"The correct answer is **A: Uhlu lwabantu abacebile baseMelika**.

Here's why:

The passage states that UBatten was ranked among the top 190 individuals on a list of the 2008 wealthiest Americans, with an estimated net worth of $2.3 billion. This directly indicates his inclusion on a list of wealthy individuals.

The other options are less direct:

*   **B: INyuvesi yaseVirginia:** While he attended and was distinguished at UVA, this doesn't directly show a *donation*.
*   **C: Inani lezindawo zokufundisa:** This is irrelevant to the question.
*   **D: Amakoloji azimisele ngobuciko nesayensi:** While UVA falls under this category, it doesn't prove a donation was made.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**."
Ikuphi okungeyona isivumelwano esasyinwa uMongameli u Arnold Schwarzenegger?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukungasagunyazwa ukuthengisa noma ukuqashisa amavidyo game kubantwana abancani abangaphandle kweCalifornia.**

Here's why:

* **The question states:** The law specifically applies *within* the state of California. 
* **Options A and B** are directly supported by the information provided: the law prohibits selling/distributing games with violence to minors in California, and there's a fine for violations.
* **Option D** is not mentioned in the text. 
* **Option C** is incorrect because the law only applies to California, not to minors outside of the state.

Therefore, the only statement *not* supported by the provided text is that the law prohibits sales/distribution of violent video games to minors *outside* of California.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani ongazwanga izinto ebezikhulunywa?","The correct answer is **C: uMiller**.

The passage states: ""Lapho ecelwa ukuthi aphawule, u-Miller uthe, “U-Mike ukhuluma kakhulu phakathi nokuthethwa kwecala...bengizilungiselela ngakho angikuzwanga ayekusho.”"" This translates to: ""When asked to take note, Miller said, “Mike talks too much during the trial…I was prepared for that so I didn’t hear what he said.”""

Therefore, Miller didn't hear what Mike was saying because he was expecting Mike to talk.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso mayelana nokulalela icala lakaMiller?","The correct answer is **B: Ebengakalaleli njengoba bekasazilungisa.**

The text states: ""U-Miller uthe, “U-Mike ukhuluma kakhulu phakathi nokuthethwa kwecala...bengizilungiselela ngakho angikuzwanga ayekusho.”"" This directly indicates that Miller wasn't listening because he was preparing for his turn to speak.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: UDuvall uveze umbono ngoMiller phakathi nokulala icala** - The text doesn't say Duvall made an observation *during* the trial; it says Duvall told Miller a story.
* **C: Abantwana bakaDuvall bebekhuluma kakhulu njengoba icala beliqhubeka** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
* **D: Ebelalelisisa kahle indaba kaDuvall** - The text clearly states Miller *wasn't* listening well.



"
Ubani oweza necebo lokuthi kumelwe kubuyekezwe i’Clean Air Act’?,"The correct answer is **D: uStephen Harper**.

The text states: ""UNdunankulu uStephen Harper uvumile ukuthumela 'Umthetho woMoya Ohlanzekile' ukuba uhlolwe ikomiti lamaqembu onke...""  This indicates that Stephen Harper, the Prime Minister at the time, is the one who submitted the Clean Air Act for review.
"
Ubani ongayithandanga i“Clean Air Act” ngoba ecabanga ukuthi isetshenjiswa ngaphambi kokuvota?,"The correct answer is **C: Umholi weNDP**. 

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uhulumeni wezwe kanye namanye amalungu kahulumeni wenhlangano yamazwe asola lesi senzo njengesandulela sokhetho lukahulumeni oluzokwenziwa ngoNovemba."" This means the federal government and other members of the NDP (New Democratic Party) view the ""Clean Air Act"" as a political move ahead of the election. Therefore, Jack Layton, the NDP leader, would likely be critical of it for that reason.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhulumeni wesifunda ogunyaziwe** - The passage indicates the Tasmanian government *benefited* from the act.
* **B: Uqgoqngoshe** - The passage doesn't mention any specific opposition from a particular minister.
* **D: I-Federal MP** - While it's possible some federal MPs might have concerns, the passage specifically highlights the NDP leader's opposition due to the timing of the act.



"
ICompound cyanuric ne-melamine umazihlanganiswa nomchamo wekati kuphume ube yini umphumela?,"The correct answer is **A: Izinso (Kidney)**.

The text states that the crystals formed from the combination of cyanuric acid and melamine can block the function of the kidneys. Therefore, the outcome in the cat's urine is kidney damage.
"
Abagcwaningi basebenzise i-infrared spectroscopy ukuze babone ini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukwakheka okuyi-kristalu komcamo wekati**.

Here's why:

* The question states that the researchers used FTIR (infrared spectroscopy) to compare the crystals found in cat urine to those found in the urine of deceased animals. 
* The text explicitly says that the crystal formation in cat urine *resembles* what was found in the urine of deceased animals, and that FTIR spectroscopy was used to *compare* the crystal structures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umsebenzi we-zinso:** While melamine and cyanuric acid affect kidney function, the FTIR spectroscopy directly analyzed the crystal structure, not the kidney function itself.
* **C: Izilwane zasekhaya ezithintekile:**  The FTIR analysis was comparing the crystals found in cat urine to crystals found in the urine of deceased animals, not to the animals themselves.
* **D: Ukudla kwezilwane ezifuwayo okonakele:** The FTIR analysis was on the crystals *in the urine*, not on the deceased food.



"
Ubani obhekisele kuLuna njenge “Queen of Extreme”?,"The correct answer is **D: uTommy Dreamer**.

The text states: ""Tommy Dreamer wathi “uLuna bekuyiNdlovukazi Yokwedlulele yokuqala."" which translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said 'Luna was the first Queen of Extreme.'""
"
Ubani obhekisele kuLuna njengo “freaky”?,"The correct answer is **B: uDustin Runnels**.

The text states, ""Dustin “Thulilwegolide” Runnels waphawula ngokuthi “uLuna wayehlanya njengami...mhlawumbe ukungidlula...ngiyamthanda futhi ngizomkhumbula...ngiyethemba usendaweni engcono.”""  While the question asks who called Luna ""freaky,"" the text uses the word ""ehlanya"" which translates to ""wild"" or ""crazy"" in this context. Dustin Runnels is the one making this statement about Luna.  The other options are incorrect as the text attributes the other statements to different individuals.
"
Ikuphi okungenzekanga kumshayeli obekasengozini yemoto?,"The correct answer is **B: Akalimazanga abantu ebebasendlini** (He didn't injure the people in the house).

The text explicitly states ""Nakuba bekunabantu abathathu phakathi kwendlu ngenkathi imoto iyishayisa, akekho kubo olimele."" (Although there were three people in the house when the car crashed, none of them were injured.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ulimele ekhanda** (He was injured in the head): The text says the driver *did* sustain serious head injuries.
* **C: Uthunyelwe esibhedlela isise Cambridge waya kulesi esise Great Yarmouth** (He was sent to the hospital in Cambridge after being taken to Great Yarmouth): The text states he was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth and then transferred to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge.
* **D: Abezimo eziphuthumayo bamsizile bamukhipha emontweni** (Emergency services helped get him out of the car): The text confirms emergency services freed the driver from the car.



"
Yikuphi okungagqamanga ngendlela iNingizimu Afrika eyayidlala ngayo ngenkathi kungumdlalo webhola lombhoxo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikhono lokuvimba (Defensive skills)**.

The passage explicitly states that South Africa's *organized defense* was a key factor in their success. It also mentions their teamwork and ball handling. While the passage says they played well overall, it **doesn't mention anything about their defensive skills**.

Let's look at why the other options are wrong:

* **A: Ukusebenzisana njengeqembu okuhle (Good teamwork):**  The passage directly states this as a strength.
* **C: Ukudlala okumangazayo ekuqaleni komqhudelwano (Impressive play at the start of the competition):** The passage says they started strong and won easily.
* **D: Isivikelo esihlelekile (Organized defense):** The passage highlights this as a strength.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, umdlalo weNingizimu Afrika uqale nini ukuthuthuka?","The correct answer is **D: Njengoba umqhudelwano bewuqhubeka**.

The text states: ""...njengoba umncintiswano uqhubeka, isivikelo sabo esihlelekile, amakhono wokuphatha ibhola nokusebenzisana njengeqembu okuhle kwabenza bavelela..."" This indicates the improvement happened *during* the competition, not at the beginning."
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okunga vezi okuqondile ngomnotho waseChina?","The correct answer is **A: Umnotho waseChina ukhule ngendlela emangazayo njengoba benza ushintsho (The Chinese economy has grown remarkably as it underwent transformation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""ubukhulu bomnotho waseShayina buye bakhula izikhathi eziphindwe ngo-90"" (the size of the Chinese economy has grown repeatedly in the 90s). This highlights the remarkable growth and transformation.
* Options B and C are presented as *examples* of this growth, but option A is the most direct and encompassing statement about the overall economic shift.
* Option D is factually incorrect based on the passage (""ngonyaka odlule iShayina ithumele izimoto eziningi kwamanye amazwe kuneJalimane"").

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the main point made in the passage about China's economic development.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, i-GDP yeChina ingayidlula nini i-GDP yase United States?","The answer is **B: Phakathi neshumi leminyaka amabili**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""I-GDP yaseShayina ingaba nkulu kuneyaseMelika emashumini amabili eminyaka."" This directly translates to ""China's GDP could be larger than that of the United States in two decades.""
"
U-Hu wanikeza kuphi ukwazisa kwamazwe asethuthukile?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuthatha isibopho leso esizophusha izinga labo lokuthuthuka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...they should be asked to take commitments beyond their development tier, environmental burdens, and capabilities."" This directly implies that Hu is urging developed countries to take on more responsibility and commitment to achieve higher development standards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukugxila okukhishwa umnotho:** While economic growth is mentioned in the context of China's GDP, the focus of Hu's statement to developed countries isn't solely on economic output.
*   **C: Ukuya ngale kwemithwalo yemfanelo yabo:**  While environmental burdens are mentioned, it's not the core of the message. The emphasis is on broader commitments beyond their current development.
*   **D: Balekela izindlela zakudala zokungcolisa:**  Hu actually advises developed countries to avoid the ""old way of polluting first and cleaning up later.""



"
Yini engakhulunywanga ngoHu?,"The correct answer is **D: Inani lokususwa kwamakhaboni (The amount of carbon removal)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states what Hu *did* say: about reducing carbon intensity of GDP, urging developing nations to avoid the ""old way"" of polluting first and cleaning later, and the need for commitment based on development level.
* The text *doesn't* mention any specific numbers or targets for carbon removal. Options A, B, and C are all discussed or implied in Hu's statement.

Therefore, the only thing Hu *didn't* discuss is the specific amount of carbon removal.
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo uVeerman wathi isimo sakho sibi?,"The correct answer is **B: i-Angola**.

The quote clearly states: ""Angola izobhekana nobhubhane olukhulu futhi isimo siqhubeka sisibi **e-Angola**...""
"
"Ngenxa yokushushiswa, ubani ozothatha isikhundla sekhabinethi sikaHuhne?","The correct answer is **A: uDavey**.

The statement clearly says: ""UHuhne ushiye phansi futhi uzothathelwa isikhundla kuyiKhabhinethi ngu- **Ed Davey** oyiLungu lePhalamende.""
"
Makuphakama ushushiso ubani ozothatha indima yokuba u-Ungqongqoshe wezamaBhizinisi?,"The correct answer is **C: uDavey**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb oyiLungu lePhalamende kulindelwe ukuthi athathe umsebenzi kaNgqongqoshe weBhizinisi oyekwa uDavey."" Therefore, Ed Davey is taking over the role.
"
Abadlali bakhuza isizalela ukuba zenzeni njesikhathi kuzodlala i-opera yeCamille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlanganyela ekusebenziseni i-cannabis**.

The question states that the opera is about the ""life and love of drugs and Japan"" and that the performers rolled cannabis on stage, encouraging the audience to participate. Therefore, the answer is that the performers encouraged audience members to participate in using cannabis.



"
Ubani obhema instango ngesikhathi se-opera?,"The correct answer is **C: Abadlali**.

The text states: ""abaculi babhema insangu ye-cannabis esiteji"" which translates to ""the performers smoked cannabis on stage"".  ""Abaculi"" refers to the performers or actors.
"
Iliphi elinye igama le- “spacewalk” lelo uLeonov alidlalile?,"The correct answer is **C: Umsebenzi owenziwa e-space**.

The text explicitly states that Leonov's first EVA was called ""ukuhamba emkhathini,"" which translates to ""work in space"" or ""activity in space."" While the other options relate to space activities, they aren't the direct synonym used for a spacewalk in the provided text.
"
ULeonov wahola yiphi inxenye ye-Soviet yempi?,"The correct answer is **B: u-Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Ngemva kweminyaka eyishumi, wahola ingxenye yomkhankaso we-Apollo-Soyuz Soviet ebonisa ukuthi Umshudiliswano Wasemkhathini wase uphelile."" This directly indicates that he led a part of the Apollo-Soyuz Soviet program. While the Apollo-Soyuz mission is related to space exploration, it's a specific program, not a general ""space war"" (A) or his personal designation (C) or the activity he performed (D).
"
Ubani owalimala engozini?,"The correct answer is **A: uGibson**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngemva kokuba kwenzeke ingozi, uGibson wayiswa esibhedlela kodwa washona ngokushesha ngemva kwalokho."" (After the accident happened, Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.)

While the other options mention people present, the text only confirms that Gibson was injured and died. The other individuals are described as witnesses or people who reacted to the accident, not as having suffered injuries themselves.
"
Kwenzekeni ngabantu ebebahilele engozini?,"The correct answer is **C: Bebememeza bekhala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umuntu osebenza egalaji eduze nalapho okwenzeke khona inhlekelele uthe: """"Bekunezingane ezilinde ukuwela umgwaqo futhi zonke bezimemeza futhi zikhala."""" Bonke bagijima babuyela lapho ingozi yenzeke khona.""  This directly indicates the children were screaming.

The passage also states that Gibson was hospitalized but died shortly after and the driver was not injured. Therefore, options A, B, and D are incorrect.
"
Abososayensi bebesenza kuhlelo elithi benethemba lokuqaphela okuyimbangela yaziphi izinto ezilandelayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Izinxenye ezincani**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isichasiselo sithi okumnyama okuzungeze umthala kuzungeze umthala njengendingilizi yokukhanya yohlobo oluthile, futhi kwenziwe ngezinto ezincane eziningi."" (The definition says that the black matter surrounding the galaxy revolves around the galaxy like a light-emitting shell of a certain type, and it is made of many small things.)

The scientists were hoping to detect these ""many small things"" that make up the shell of black matter.
"
Ososayensi bebebheka kuphi okuthile kwe-zinto okulandelayo?,"The correct answer is **B: Umhlaba neSagittarius galaxy**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the scientists were observing the interaction between the Milky Way galaxy and the Sagittarius galaxy. It mentions the Moon's gravitational pull on Earth and the Milky Way's gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy, and how these pulls affect the black matter surrounding the Sagittarius galaxy. Therefore, the scientists were looking at the Earth and the Sagittarius galaxy.
"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, ikuphi okungagxekwanga ama-Conservatives?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuntula imizamo yokwakha kabusha.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the ""Inkulumo-mpikiswano idalwe ukuphikisana ngokuchitha imali eningi yokusiza nokwakha kabusha ngemva kokudlula kweSiphepho iKatrina."" This means the opposition was focused on the rebuilding efforts themselves.
* The passage also mentions criticism regarding the promise of contract renewals to benefit insiders in Washington. This reinforces the focus on *how* the rebuilding was being done, not necessarily the idea of helping people or using money for rebuilding.
* The options A, C, and D all relate to aspects of the rebuilding process or the use of funds, which were the primary targets of the opposition.  However, the passage *doesn't* say conservatives opposed the rebuilding efforts themselves. It says the opposition was *against* the rebuilding efforts.

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
Ubani oxeka ukukwakhiwa kabusha kwesivumelwano yemizamo yokusiza yeHurricane Katrina?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukungavumelani nohulumeni mayelana nemali.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the controversy surrounding the rebuilding efforts focused on the **promise of contract renewals to understand Washington insiders**. This indicates a dispute about how money was being allocated and potentially misused or unfairly distributed. 
* Option A, ""Ukungavumelani nohulumeni mayelana nemali"" (Disagreement with the government about money) accurately reflects this core issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umsekeli wemithetho zomphakathi** (Public interest advocate) - While public interest groups may have criticized the rebuilding, the passage doesn't directly state they were the ones objecting to the contracts.
* **C: Ihlathi** (The swamp) - This is a metaphorical reference and doesn't represent an entity objecting to the rebuilding.
* **D: Ama-Washington insiders** (Washington insiders) - The passage describes them as the *target* of the contract renewal promises, not the ones objecting to the rebuilding itself.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, kunini lapho ukukhanya okubuya kuStardust spacecraft azobonakala khona?","The correct answer is **B: Inyakatho California**.

The text states: ""Lapho umkhumbi-mkhathi ufika eMhlabeni futhi ungena emkhathini, cishe ngo-5 ekuseni (ngokwesikhathi sasempumalanga) kulindeleke ukuba wenze umbukwane wokukhanya wabantu baseNyakatho California, e-Oregon, eNavada, nase-Utah.""

This clearly indicates the light show will be visible in Northern California.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, i-spacecraft izobeka liphi i-rekhordi kwezinto ezilandelayo?","The correct answer is **C: Ukubuyela emhlabeni ngokushesha**.

The text explicitly states: ""I-Stardust uzobeka irekhodi elisha elizohlala-njalo ngokuba indizamshini esheshayo ukubuya emhlabeni, iphule irekhodi eledlule elabekwa ngo-May 1969 phakathi nokubuya kuka-Apollo X.""

While the spacecraft will be visible in certain areas (B) and travel quickly (D), the primary record it will break is for the fastest return to Earth (C). Option A is incorrect because the text focuses on the visibility of the spacecraft, not the extent of the light show.
"
uDr. Malar Balasubramanian uhlobana kanjani noSaroja Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **C: Umama**.

The text states that Saroja Balasubramanian was Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's mother.
"
Umzimba kaSara Balasubramanian watholwa kuphi?,"The correct answer is **B: Eceleni komgwaqgo**.

The text states: ""UDkt. Malar Balasubramanian watholwa eMlotha Oluhlaza, e-Ohio, idolobha elicishe libe amamayela angu-15 enyakatho neSinsinathi elele phansi eceleni komgwaqo ngesikibha kanye nezingubo zangaphansi...""  This clearly indicates the body was found *across the street*.
"
Yini eyatholwa ku-eBay?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The question states that eBay hopes to expand its business in areas where Skype is strong. This implies that eBay made a deal or acquisition related to Skype, resulting in a significant profit.
"
I-eBay izama ukufeza ini ngalokho ekuzuzile?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukukhulisa ezindaweni ezintsha.**

The passage states eBay aims to expand its business and grow in regions where Skype is strong (China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil). This directly points to a focus on expanding into new geographical markets.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ukuhlanganisa imali engenayo:** While a good outcome, it's not the *stated goal* resulting from the profit.
* **C: Ukukhulisa iphrofayili yayo:**  Growing in new regions *will* boost the profile, but it's a *result* of the expansion, not the primary goal mentioned.
* **D: Ukujabulisa abaninimasheya:**  While profitability benefits shareholders, the passage focuses on geographical expansion as the immediate action eBay is taking.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani ongazange akhulumisane neziboshwa ezasala endaweni yokulwa?","The correct answer is **A: Abaxoxisani (Negotiators)**.

The text states that ""Abaxoxisanyao bazama ukulungisa isimo..."" which implies they were trying to communicate and address the prisoners. The other groups – fire crews, police chiefs, and hospital staff – are described as responding to the situation (putting on protective gear, entering the prison, fighting the fire, and extinguishing it) but there is no mention of them attempting to communicate directly with the prisoners.
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okwabangela ukuba iziboshwa zingasaqubeki nesiteleka?,"The correct answer is **C: Iziboshwa ezilimele**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Lapho impi inqamukangemva kokuba abalimele bathunyelwe esibhedlele, iziboshwa ezicishe zibe ngu-40 ezisele zihlale egcekeni futhi zenqaba ukubuyela ezitokisini zazo."" This directly indicates the prisoners' injuries and reluctance to return to their cells are a major factor in their continued unrest.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ukuxoxisana okuphumelelayo:** The passage doesn't mention any successful communication that resolved the prisoners' issues.
* **B: Isisi esikhalisa izinyembezi:** While the tear gas caused distress, it was a *response* to the prisoners' behavior, not the *cause* of their ongoing unrest.
* **D: Umlilo:** The fire was an *event* that *caused* a response, but the prisoners' continued unrest stems from the underlying issue of their injuries and reluctance to return to their cells.



Therefore, the prisoners' injuries and unwillingness to return to their cells are the most likely reason for their continued unrest.



"
"Ngokombono ka-Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, izwe i-Iran kumelwe izikhulule kuphi?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuzimel kuka-owela (Oil independence)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...lokho izwe okumelwe lizikhulule kukho."" referring to the reliance on oil. Ayatollah Khamenei calls this dependence ""a weakness"" that has existed since before the 1979 revolution.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani owavuma imiphumela yesixwayiso kumnotho yeIran?","The correct answer is **A: Imithombo ephezulu (High-level sources)**.

The passage states: ""Ukuphawula, okwenzeka ngaleso sikhathi kuthelevishini, bekungokokuqala lapho imithombo emikhulu yase-Iran ivume ukuthi ukujezisa kunethonya elithile.""  This directly indicates that high-level sources in Iran acknowledged the impact of the sanctions.

While OPEC and Ayatollah Khamenei discuss the situation, the initial acknowledgement of the impact is attributed to ""imithombo emikhulu yase-Iran"" (high-level sources in Iran). The European Union is mentioned regarding the oil embargo, but not in the context of acknowledging the economic impact.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona indlela yokuvota kweFrance?,"The correct answer is **D: Amavoti abalwe abameli bamakhandidethi (Votes are counted by candidates' representatives)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kusihlwa, amavoti abalwa amavolontiya abekwe iso elibukhali, alandela izinqubo ezithile.""  This means the votes are counted by volunteers, not the candidates' representatives.

The other options are all described as part of the French voting process in the text:

* **A: Amabhokisi okuvota abonkalayo (Transparent ballot boxes):** The text explicitly mentions that ballot boxes must be transparent.
* **B: Abameli abathunywe amakhandidethi (Candidates' representatives):** The text states that candidates can send representatives to observe the entire process.
* **C: Ukusayinela ukuvota (Signing the voter list):** The text mentions that voters sign the voter list.



"
Abavotayo babonisa kuphi ukuthi bakhethe amakhandidethi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ku-imvilophu**.

The passage states: ""...babeka iphepha eliphrintiwe ekuqaleni elibonisa ukhetho lwabo ngaphakathi kwemvilophi."" This directly indicates that voters show their choice on a paper within the envelope.
"
Yini eyaholela u-Allen aqale ukufuna uMusashi iminyka eyisishagalombili?,"The correct answer is **D: Isithakazelo sakhe empini (His interest in warfare)**.

The passage states: ""...waqala ukucinga iMusashi ngemva kwesithakazelo sempilo yonke empini."" This directly indicates that his interest in warfare led him to search for the ship.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umnotho wakhe (His economy):** While he invested heavily in the research, the passage doesn't explicitly link this investment to his desire to find the Musashi.
* **B: Isithakazelo sakhe ku-seabed mapping (His interest in seabed mapping):**  The passage mentions seabed mapping, but it's presented as a tool used *to find* the Musashi, not the *reason* he started the search.
* **C: Utshalomali lwakhe ekuhloleni olwandle (His investment in ocean research):** Similar to A, the investment is mentioned but not directly tied to his motivation for finding the Musashi.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, uAllen usebenzisa imali enengi kuphi?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlola ezolwandle (Seabed exploration)**.

The text states: ""Allen kubikwa ukuthi utshale ingcebo yakhe eningi ekuhloleni okwenzeka olwandle..."" This means he invested heavily in seabed exploration.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ikuphi okulandelayo okwholela ekutheni isakhiwo sibe yingozi nangaphandle?","The correct answer is **A: Amafutha e-Uranium**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the authorities suspect that **uranium-containing materials** might have been involved in the explosion, leading to the release of radioactive substances. The other options are either directly identified as radioactive (cesium and iodine) or are simply part of the scene (white truck). The passage links the potential danger to the presence of uranium-containing *fats*.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona icebo lezokuphepha elinikezwe abantu bendawo mayelana nalokho okwenzeke esakhiweni?,"The correct answer is **A: Balekela ukusebenzisa ama-air conditioning units (Escape using air conditioning units)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Nendawo yemboni ukuba bahlale ezindlini, bacime izipholisa-moya futhi bangaphuzi amanzi ompompi."" This translates to: ""...that residents near the industrial site should stay indoors, turn off air conditioners, and not drink well water.""

* **The other options align with the warnings:**
    * **B: Hlala ngaphakathi (Stay indoors):** This is directly mentioned as a safety precaution.
    * **C: Kubalekele ukuphefumula intuthu emhlophe (Avoid breathing the white smoke):**  The text indicates the white smoke is a concern and that residents should avoid inhaling it.
    * **D: Balekela ukuphuza amanzi empompi (Avoid drinking well water):** This is also directly mentioned as a safety precaution.

Therefore, escaping *using* air conditioning units is the only option that contradicts the provided safety instructions.  In fact, turning *off* air conditioning units is part of the recommended safety measures.
"
"Ngokuya kuka Dr. Moll, yini okukhathazayo mayelana neXDR-TB?","The correct answer is **A: Okuhlukile kwegciwane elisesibhedlela**.

The text states, ""Ezinye iziguli zithole igciwane esibhedlela..."" which translates to ""Some patients got the germ in the hospital..."" This indicates that the multi-drug resistant nature of XDR-TB is concerning because it's spreading within healthcare settings.  The text also emphasizes the high mortality rate, but the *primary* concern highlighted by Dr. Moll in the provided text is the hospital-acquired nature of the infection.



Let's look at why the other options are less accurate based on the text:

* **B: Igciwane elibalekela izidakamizwa** While XDR-TB *is* drug-resistant, the text doesn't explicitly state that this is Dr. Moll's *primary* concern. It mentions the resistance as part of the overall alarming nature.
* **C: Inengi labantu umuntu onegciwane angabathelela** The text *does* say a person can infect 10-15 people, but Dr. Moll's initial concern isn't specifically the high transmissibility, but the hospital spread.
* **D: Amathuba wokufa manengi** The text mentions a high mortality rate, but Dr. Moll's initial concern is the hospital spread of the germ.
"
Iziguli eziyingakhi ezithole leligciwane elisha kwaqinisekiswa ukuthi abasebenzi bezibhedlela?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""...okungenani ababili bekuyizisebenzi zempilo zasesibhedlela."" ( ""...at least two were hospital staff."")
"
I-NextGen isebenzisa luphi uhlelo lwezobuchwepheshe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ubuchwepheshe obusekelwe kwisathelayithi**.

The text explicitly states: ""It uses technology based on satellites...""
"
I-NextGen izuzisa kanjani ngokuqondile ukulawula umoya we-traffic?,"The correct answer is **B: Izindawo zokundiza ezicacile.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that NextGen uses technology based on **satellite-based** systems to allow air traffic controllers to **locate aircraft with greater accuracy** and provide pilots with more precise information. This directly relates to creating clearer and more defined airspace.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Izindlela ezifishani zokundiza:** While shorter routes are a *result* of NextGen, the core way it directly improves air traffic control isn't just about shortening routes. It's about *how* controllers track and guide aircraft.
* **C: Ukunciphisa bokukhishwa kwekhabhoni:** This is a *benefit* of NextGen, not a direct way it improves air traffic control.
* **D: Amafutha amancani:** This refers to the increased fuel capacity, which is a consequence of the improved efficiency, but not a direct method of air traffic control.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini izazi-mlando ezingayigxekanga mayelana nalokho i-FBI egxile kikho?","The correct answer is **C: Ukugxila kakhulu mayelana namacala wokubukela izithombe ezincolile.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the Abezomlando (presumably referring to the FBI) disregarded past regulations by focusing on ""amacaleni alula ukuwaxazulula, ikakhulukazi amacala okuntshontshwa kwezimoto"" (cases that are easy to solve, especially car theft) to boost success rates.
* The passage highlights that the Abezomlando then started supporting a scheme involving exploiting vulnerable people in the country and requested 10 agents be assigned to this specific, problematic area.
* This strongly indicates the FBI's focus on exploitative crimes involving vulnerable individuals is the questionable aspect, and the passage implies it's a deviation from proper conduct.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukunyusa izinga lokuphumelela (Boosting success rates):** While the FBI's stated motivation was to increase success rates, the passage presents this as the *reason* for disregarding regulations, not as a historically unproblematic focus itself.
* **B: Ukukhiph izinto ezidingekayo ukuze kugxazululwe izinkinga (Extracting necessary elements to solve problems):** This is a general statement about law enforcement work and not specifically criticized in the passage.
* **D: Amacala wokwetshiwa kwezimoto (Car theft cases):**  The passage mentions car theft as an *example* of the ""easy to solve"" cases the FBI initially focused on, but the problem isn't car theft itself. The problem is the shift to exploiting vulnerable people.



"
Isinyathelo sokuziphatha okungadingekile kuphoqelele i-FBI ukuba yenzeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Sinikela ngamaphoyisa ezindabeni zezithombe ezingcolile**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the *unnecessary* action.** The passage states the Abezomlando disregarded rules to focus on simpler cases (car thefts) to boost success. The corrupt official then requested the FBI provide agents for a potentially illegal scheme. This implies the unnecessary action is providing agents for the illegal scheme, which involves exploiting vulnerable individuals (elderly people).

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sithathe okudingekayo sikusebenzisele amacala wezimoto ezintshontshiwe:** While the FBI *did* focus on car theft, the core issue is not the car thefts themselves, but the corrupt official's demand for agents to participate in something illegal.
* **B: Ukuphula ukuphumelela kwama agency:**  The corrupt official's actions were about personal gain and illegal activity, not about improving the FBI's overall success.
* **C: Sigxile ebugebengwini obugxazululeka lula:** Focusing on simple cases was a *stated reason* for the FBI's actions, not an unnecessary one.



Therefore, providing agents to participate in the illegal scheme involving vulnerable people is the most unnecessary and problematic action.



"
Kwenzekeni ngesicima mlilo esasabela engozini ye-JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **B: Iginqikile (It crashed)**.

The text states: ""...umshayeli wabhanoyi wahlonzwa njengoMholi we-Squadron u-Dilokrit Pattavee. Abezindaba bendawo babika ukuthi imoto yomlilo yasesikhumulweni sezindiza yaginqikangenkathi iphuthuma."" which translates to ""...the helicopter pilot was identified as Squadron Leader Dilokrit Pattavee. Local news reported that the airport's fire truck crashed while responding.""
"
"Ukulandela ukushayisa kwe-JAS 39C Gripen, isiteshi sezindiza savela ngenxa?","The correct answer is **A: Izindiza ezihamba endaweni (Air traffic)**.

The text states: ""...okwavala izindiza zabantu bonke esikhumulweni sezindiza"" which translates to ""...which closed all air traffic at the airfield.""
"
UBrzezinsk wanikeza bani iziqondiso ngesikhathi kubusa i-Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: uCarter**.

The text explicitly states: ""Njenge-NSA, usize uKhatha ngokuphatha izindaba zezwe ngokuhlakanipha, njengeSivumelwano seKamu Davide, ngo-1978; ukwenza kube nobudlelwane obuvamile phakathi kweMelika neShayina ekupheleni kwawo-1970; Ushintsho lwase-Iran, olwaholela enhlekeleleni yezithunjwa zase-Iran, ngo-1979; kanye nokuhlasela kweSoviet e-Afghanistan, ngo-1979.""  This indicates that Brzezinski advised Carter during the Iranian Revolution."
Ubani obekasesikhundleni seNational Security Advisor kwaze kwaba ngo-1977?,"The correct answer is **B: uKissinger**.

The text states: ""...ethatha isikhundla sikaHenry Kissinger."" which directly indicates that Kissinger was the National Security Advisor before Brzezinski.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungavezi ngokuqondile umsebenzi kaBobek ngoPartizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukore amagoli angaphezu kuka-468 njengoba bekasadlalela iqembu lakhe.**

Here's why:

* The passage *directly* states that Bobek scored 403 goals in 468 games for Partizan. Option A is a slightly reworded version of this direct information.
* Options B, C, and D are also directly mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the question asks which option is *not* directly stated. Since all other options are, A is the correct answer.
"
Yisiphi isitatimende esiyiqiniso esikhuluma ngomlando kaBobek ne-Partizan Belgrade?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuqale ukudlalela i-Partizan ngo-1945**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Wajoyine ngo-1945 futhi wahlala kwaze kwaba u-1958."" (He joined in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Udlalele iZagreb ngaphambi kwe-Partizan Belgrade:** The passage doesn't mention him playing for Zagreb before Partizan.
* **C: Udlalele iPartizan kufikela ku-1995:** He stopped playing for Partizan in 1958, not 1995. The 1995 vote was *after* his playing career.
* **D: Wathola udumo ngemva kokuvotelwa njengomdlali ohamba phambili kunabo bonke wePartizan:** The passage says he gained fame *while* playing for Partizan, not after being voted the best.

Therefore, option A is the only statement directly supported by the provided text.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, iziphi izici ezihlukanisa iHesperonychus ku-Velociraptor?","The correct answer is **C: Umziba ogcwele izimpaphe**. 

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""Lenyoni esinezimpaphe ngokugcwele..."" which means ""This bird was covered entirely in feathers...""
* While the text mentions it's a relative of Velociraptor and *may* have walked on two legs, it doesn't state that two-legged walking is a unique feature of Hesperonychus. 
* Option B is correct but doesn't differentiate it from other dromaeosaurids.
* Option D (warm-blooded) is not mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the feathered body is the most distinct feature highlighted as belonging to Hesperonychus.
"
Isizathu esichaza i- “Hesperonychus” lithathelwa kusiphi isici salesi silwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Izinzipho (inzipho)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Izipho layo lesibili belilikhudlwana, okwenza yabizwa ngokuthi yi-Hesperonychus okusho ukuthi “izipho lasentshonalanga.”"" (Its second toe was enlarged, which led to it being called Hesperonychus, meaning ""western claw."")
"
Ikuphi okulandeyo okuyiniqiniso mayelana nokudubula?,"The best answer is **A: UMyeni nonkosikaze bobabili abaseTexas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Izithandani zashadela e-Texas ngonyaka odlule... Umyeni oneminyaka engu-30, owazalelwa eNyathi, wayengomunye wabane oshonile ngenkathi kudutshulwa..."" This establishes that both the groom and the best man are from Texas.
* **The passage doesn't say:** Anything about a shooting occurring in Buffalo (D), or that five people were injured (B), or that the groom had a previous wedding (C). 

Therefore, the only fact directly supported by the provided text is that both the groom and the best man are from Texas.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuyiqiniso mayelana nokuthi ukudutshulwa kwenzeke kuphi?,"The correct answer is **C: Kwenzeke emcimbini eTexas**.

The text states: ""Izithandani zashadela e-Texas ngonyaka odlule..."" which directly indicates the wedding (and therefore the divorce/anniversary being commemorated) took place in Texas. The text then mentions the anniversary celebration is in Buffalo. The divorce/anniversary is based on the wedding in Texas.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini into eyinhloko ebeyikhathaza izikhulu mayelana neLuno?","The correct answer is **D: Ukulimala okungenzeka zenzeke ebantwini (Potential injuries to the people)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Izindiza ezinophephela emhlane zisindise amalungu ayishumi nambili eqembu *nesokuphuka kwekhala*."" (Helicopters rescued twelve crew members and *a broken leg*).  The initial concern was that the helicopter might not be able to carry the usual cargo *and that the people on board could be injured*. This makes the potential injuries to the people the primary concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukungabi nomanyolo emthwaleni (Lack of cargo)**: While cargo was mentioned, the initial concern was not the lack of cargo, but the safety of the people.
*   **B: Amagagasi nomoya ophezulu (Hail and strong winds)**: While the weather played a role, the core worry was the safety of the people and avoiding injuries.
*   **C: Ukuchitheka kopethiloli (Fuel leak)**: The text mentions the fuel leak but does not indicate that that was the primary concern."
"Ngokuya kwawlomusho, ikuphi okulandelayo okukhuluma ngemvelaphi yeLuno okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuphuka kwenzeke ngaphambi kokulandwa kwezimpahla** (The rupture happened before the loading of goods).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Umkhumbi ongamamitha angu-100 wawusendleleni yokulanda impahla yawo evamile engumquba *nokuqaleni iziphathimandla zazesaba ukuthi umkhumbi ungachitha umthwalo*.""  This means the ship was *in the process of loading cargo* when the rupture occurred. Therefore, the rupture and the loading happened concurrently, not in sequence with the rupture happening *before* loading.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

*   **B: Umkhumbi bewune pethiloli okungaba ama-metre angu-100 ngesikhathi siphuka** (The ship was 100 meters long when it ruptured) - The passage explicitly says the ship was 100 meters long.
*   **C: Phakathi kwabantu abayi shumi nambili, oyedwa owalimala** (Among the twenty-two people, only one was injured) - The text states that 12 members of the crew were saved and ""okuwukuphela kokulimala bekuwukuphuka kwekhala"" (the only injury was the rupture).  This implies only one person was injured.
*   **D: Isikhephe saphushelwa ngasethekwini** (The hull was pushed by the sea) - The passage says ""Isikhephe saphushelwa ngasethekwini"" which is literally ""The hull was pushed by the sea.""
"
Kungayiphi ikhulu lapho i-Algeria yaqa ukuzimela?,"The correct answer is **C: ngo-1960s**.

The provided text states that Vautier returned to a newly independent Algeria in the 1960s to teach film directing. This directly indicates Algeria gained independence in the 1960s.
"
Kukuphi lapho ama-sikirini we-thelevishini angaxunywanga emcimbini womgcwabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kulolonke laseRoma**.

Here's why:

The passage states that screens were set up in *various locations throughout Rome* because the crowds were too large to fit everyone in St. Peter's Square.  Therefore, the screens weren't limited to specific cities or regions within Italy or Poland. They were distributed *across* Rome.
"
Umcwabo bewubanjelwe kuphi?,"The correct answer is **C: e-St. Peter’s Square**.

The passage states: ""...kwakungenzeki ukuba wonke umuntu angene enkonzweni yomngcwabo eSt. Peter's Square."" This directly indicates that the funeral was held in St. Peter's Square.
"
"Ukulandela ukuqhuma, obani owanakwa ngenxa yokulimala?","The correct answer is **A: Okungesanani abantu abahlanu**.

The text states: ""kodwa okungenani abantu abahlanu abakade bese ndaweni yesigameko ngesikhathi sokuqhuma balashelwe izimpawu zokuthuka."" This directly indicates that at least five people were affected by the explosion.
"
Ubani obike ukuvuza kwe-gas?,"The correct answer is **A: Umakhelwane ngaphakathi komakhiwo (A neighbor inside the building)**.

The text states: ""Lapho kufika izikhulu, ifulethi yaqhuma. Akukho ukulimala okutheni okubikiwe, kodwa okungenani abantu abahlanu abakade bese ndaweni yesigameko ngesikhathi sokuqhuma balashelwe izimpawu zokuthuka. Ngaleso sikhathi, zibalelwa cishe ku-100 izakhamuzi ezakhishwa endawe$ni. **Umakhelwane ebike ukuvuza kwegesi**.""
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, bangakhi abantu abafa kulokhu kuhlaselwa?","The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states that Nicholas Alden (25) and Zachary Cuddeback (21) died. Edga Veguilla was injured, and Kristoffer Schneider suffered severe injuries. Therefore, a total of 4 people were fatally injured.
"
Isikhali sakabani esahluleka ukusebenza ngesikhathi sokuhlasela?,"The correct answer is **B: u-Uka**.

The text states: ""I sikhali sika-Uka sahluleka lapho wayekhombe indoda yesihlanu ekhanda."" (Uka's knife failed when he aimed at the fifth man in the head.)
"
Iwuphi umdlalo iyavotelwa ukuba ikhishwe ohlelweni lwe-Olympic?,"The correct answer is **A: i-Squash**.

The text states: ""I-squash, i-karate, kanye nemidlalo ye-roller izame ukungena ohlelweni lwama-Olimpiki..."" This indicates that squash was one of the sports being considered for removal from the Olympic program. The question asks which sport was *voted to be removed*, and the passage specifically mentions squash as being among those vying for inclusion but also facing potential removal.
"
Iwuphi umdlalo owavotelwa yi-International Olympic Committee okumelwe ufake emidlalweni?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuhlangana kwe-rugby**.

The text states: ""I-rugby, ngokukhethekhile inyunyoni ye-rugby, kanye negalufu zikhethiwe emidlalweni emihlanu eminye ukucatshangalwe ukuthi ihlanganyele kuma-Olimpiki."" This means rugby was one of the sports voted to be included.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   A: Rollersports is not mentioned in the text.
*   B: Baseball and Softball were voted *out* of the Olympics.
*   D: Softball was voted out of the Olympics.



"
U-Arthur Guinness waqashisa i-St James’ Gate Brewery iminyaka emingakhi?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The passage states: ""Eminyakeni engama-250 kamuva, i-Guinness ikhule yaba..."" which translates to ""250 years later, Guinness grew to become..."".
"
I-Guinness iletha ama-bhiliyoni wama dollar amangakhi ngonyaka?,"The correct answer is **D: 10**.

The text states: ""Eminyakeni engama-250 kamuva, i-Guinness ikhule yaba ibhizinisi lembulunga yonke elenza ama-euro angamabhiliyoni angu-10 (u-$14.7 wamabhiliyoni waseMelika ) njalo ngonyaka."" This translates to ""In the following 250 years, Guinness grew into a global brewing business that makes billions of euros (10 billion dollars) annually.""
"
Emazweni amangakhi lapho ase-European Union anegciwane i- H5N1 esebaboniwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Isithupha**.

The text states that France is the sixth European Union country to report the H5N1 virus. The other countries mentioned are Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy. Therefore, there are six countries.
"
Kukhuphi lapho igciwane i- H5N1 esanda kutholwa khona?,"The correct answer is **A: i-France**.

The text states: ""IFulansi yizwe lesikhombisa esiGungwini saseYurophu lokuthola leligciwane..."" which translates to ""France is the European Union country where this virus was found...""
"
Kunini lapho iGreece agcina khona ukuhlangabezana negciwane ngaphambi kokuthi lisakazeke abenzi bokuthula?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngezi khathi ze-1800s**.

The text states: ""Ngaphambi kokufika kwamabutho, iHaiti beyingakahlangabezani nezinkinga ezihlobene nesifo kusukela ngawo-1800."" This directly indicates that Haiti had encountered disease issues as early as the 1800s, well before the UN peacekeepers arrived.
"
Ukungcola okwayiphi ndawo lapho kwasakazeka isifo?,"The correct answer is **A: Umfula i-Artibonite**.

The passage states: ""Ngokwecala, ukungcola okuvela ekamu le-UN akukhucululwanga kahle, okwabangela ukuthi amabhakithiliya angene emingeneleni yoMfula i-Artibonite..."" (According to the indictment, the disease from the UN camp was not properly contained, which caused bacteria to enter the waters of the Artibonite River...).
"
Uhulumende wama-Irish uhlela ukwenzani?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukungezelela imithetho eqinile endabeni yezidakamizwa.**

The text states: ""Uhulumeni wase-Ireland ugcizelela ukwenza umthetho wasephalamende ngokushesha ukulungisa isimo."" This directly indicates they are creating new laws. The rest of the text elaborates on *why* they are doing this – to address public health and justice concerns related to drug use.
"
Yini okwakugunyaziwe isikhashana e-Ireland?,"The correct answer is **D: Izidakamizwa (Drugs)**.

The text states: ""...the government is determined to quickly legislate to address the situation. The government spokesperson said it was now important for both public health and justice to ensure that the legislation played a role as quickly as possible. The Minister of Health expressed concern about both public unrest among those who have been impacted by the temporary suspension of **controlled drugs**...""
"
Umsolwa uphenywa ngaziphi izizathu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukungena ngokungafanelwe (Riot)**.

The passage explicitly states that the suspect is being investigated for ""ukweqa kunokuhuluza"" which translates to ""rioting and looting"". Therefore, ""ukungena ngokungafanelwe"" (riot) is the accurate translation and answer.
"
"Uma ushintsha uphawu, yini into umsolwa engayenzanga?","The correct answer is **A: Shintsha okukodwa emagameni**.

Here's why:

The passage states the suspect is being investigated for forgery. Forgery is the act of falsely altering something to make it appear genuine. Changing a single letter in a name *is* a form of altering something to make it appear different and potentially false.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ihlobise ngopawu lokuthula:** While he *did* use a peace sign, the core act of forgery is the alteration of the name itself. The peace sign is a disguise, not the forgery.
*   **C: Imoshe ngokoqobo:** The passage doesn't mention anything about physical impersonation or disguise.
*   **D: Sebenzisa i-tarpaulins ukuze uyithuthukise:** Tarpaulins are irrelevant to the act of changing a name.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yikuphi okulandelayo utisha wesingisi uKarno ongazange asolwe ngakho?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuthandana nomfundi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that u-Karno was accused of copyright infringement (A) and printing unauthorized ads (C).
* The passage *mentions* that he was accused of using a whip in class and having a close relationship with his students (D), but it says he was *accused* and not ultimately charged. 
* However, the passage explicitly states that he **was not charged** with copyright infringement. Therefore, it's the only option that definitively says he wasn't accused of something.
* The passage refers to his style of teaching which involved interacting with students which made some parents uncomfortable, but he was not accused of inappropriately interacting with them in a criminal or legal sense.

Therefore, the best answer is **B: Ukuthandana nomfundi** because the passage suggests this was the reason for parental concern but he was not formally charged for it.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani ongathathwanga njenge sithunjwa uRolando Mendoza?","The correct answer is **B: Amaphoyisa**.

The passage states that Rolando Mendoza is the perpetrator (he shot the tourists). It explicitly says the tourists were taken hostage, and the photographers took their place. Therefore, he could not be a hostage himself.
"
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, iziphi izithunjwa ezingaqinisekiswanga ukuthi zidedelwe ngokushesha?","The correct answer is **A: Izivakashi ezihambayo**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""okungenani eziyisithupha zishonile kuze kube manje."" This implies that the number of victims is still being assessed, and the exact number of tourists is not yet confirmed. The other options (photographers, children, etc.) are specifically mentioned as being among those released, indicating their status is known.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ubani othatha amaphepha asayiniwe okugunyaza umshado wobulili obufanayo eBrazil?","The correct answer is **B: uRoberto Jefferson**.

The text states: ""Umthetho ohlongozwayo, ngemva kokuba ulungiswe, manje usezandleni zikaRoberto Jefferson."" (The amended law, after being revised, is now in the hands of Roberto Jefferson.) This indicates that Roberto Jefferson is currently holding the law related to legalizing same-sex marriage in Brazil.
"
Ababhikishi bazonika izicelo zabo kubani?,"The correct answer is **C: i-National Congress of Brazil**.

The text states: ""Ababhikishi banethemba lokuthi bazothola abantu abazosayina isicelo abayizigidi ezingu-1.2 **ukusethula kuKhongolose Wezwe ngoNovemba**.""  This translates to ""The advocates hope to get 1.2 million people to sign a petition **to present to the National Congress in November**.""
"
"Ngokuya kuka Armand Versace, yini okwenzeka ngaphambi kokuba inengi lisabele kusimo sezulu?","The correct answer is **C: Bekunomoya osindayo.**

The passage states: ""Imizuzu emihlanu umbukiso uqalile umoya uqala ukungena..."" which translates to ""The show started after five minutes, the wind started coming in...""

Therefore, the wind starting was the first event mentioned *before* the heavy rain and flooding.
"
"Ngokuya kuka Versace, umoya onamandla uqale nini?","The correct answer is **A: Ngemva kwemizuzu embalwa ngemva kwesibukiso siqale ukudlala**

The passage clearly states: ""Imizuzu emihlanu umbukiso uqalile umoya uqala ukungena..."" which translates to ""Five minutes after the show started, the wind began to enter...""
"
"Ngaphambi kukaFred, zingakhi izivunguvungu ezimandla ezibikiwe ezibuya empumalanga 35°W?","The correct answer is **A: Lutho**.

The passage states: ""Fred is the strongest cyclone ever recorded in the central and eastern Atlantic since the inception of satellite imagery, and it is only the third major cyclone west of 35°W in history.""

This directly implies that there were no other strong cyclones reported before Fred in that region. Therefore, the answer is A.
"
"Lapho uFred etholwa ukuthi usesiqhingini seCape Verde , beyihamba isondela ngakuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Entshonalanga**.

The text states: ""Isiphepho, esisendaweni ecishe ibe amamayela angu-645 (1040 km) entshonalanga yeziqhingi zaseCape Verde..."" This translates to ""The storm, located approximately 645 (1040 km) **north** of the Cape Verde Islands...""
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okugijima ngejubane elikhulu kunalaba abangaphambi kwabo?,"The correct answer is **A: i-802.11n**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ijubane lika-802.11n liphezulu kakhulu kunelangaphambili elaligcina ejubaneni elingu-600Mbit/s.""  This directly confirms that 802.11n is the fastest of the technologies mentioned.
"
Yini okudingekile nge 802.11n ukuze ibesemuva ihambisane ne802.11b?,"The correct answer is **D: Ama-radios womabili**.

Here's why:

* **802.11n is backward compatible with older standards (802.11a, b, and g) because it uses the same radio frequencies.**  To achieve backward compatibility with 802.11b, the 802.11n device *must* have radios that can operate on the 2.4GHz frequency band, which is the same band used by 802.11b.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ijubane eligijimayo:** While 802.11n's speed is higher, backward compatibility isn't *dependent* on that speed. It's about the underlying radio technology.
* **B: Ikhono le 802.11b likwazi ukusebenza ku5.0Ghz:**  802.11b operates on the 2.4GHz band. The 5.0GHz band is used by 802.11a.
* **C: Ukudluliswa kwenani le 600Mbit/s:**  The 600Mbit/s speed is a characteristic of 802.11n, not a requirement for backward compatibility.  Older standards have lower speeds.



"
Bekuma event ayingakhi lapho indondo yegolide bekumelwe izobhukuda kumaCommonwealth Games?,"The correct answer is **C: Kubili**.

The passage states the athlete *could* have competed in the 100m and 200m sprint at the Commonwealth Games. Therefore, the answer is two events.
"
Kungani indondo beyingathathi imithi yakhe yama-pain?,"The correct answer is **D: Ayikavunyelwa kuma-Commonwealth Games**.

The text explicitly states: ""Akakwazanga ukuthatha imithi edingekayo yokulwisana nobuhlungu bakhe njengoba ingavunyelwe eMidlalweni."" (He couldn't take the necessary medication to fight his pain because it wouldn't be allowed at the Games.)

While the other options *could* be contributing factors, the text directly points to the restriction on medication at the Commonwealth Games as the reason.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, yini ebeyibanga ukudideka ngokuzamazama komhlaba?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuba khona kwamafu amnyama**.

The passage states: ""Amafu amnyama angahlobene nokuqhuma kwentabamlilo abikiwe esiqwini sentaba. Amafu enze kwaba nokudideka kokuthi ukuqubuka kube khona yini.""  This directly links the dark fumes to the confusion about whether an earthquake was occurring.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, ushintsho lwenzeke nini?","The correct answer is **C: Ngezi10 zikaMarch**.

The passage states: ""Ngokuuzamazama komhlaba okukhulu kuye kwaholela kwinguquko yesigaba esenzeka mhlaka-10 kuNdasa ohlangothini olusenyakatho-mpumalanga yesifunda sentaba-mlilo."" This translates to: ""The major earthquake led to a change in seismic activity that occurred on March 10th in the North-Eastern part of the volcanic region.""
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungelona iqiniso nge-Chandrayaan-1’s lunar probe?,"The correct answer is **A: I-orbit yethule i-probe beyineqembu (The launch orbit of the probe had a team)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the probe's successful deployment and mission.** It details its speed, successful maneuvers, scientific instruments, and the flag.
* **The passage *doesn't* mention a team being part of the launch orbit.** The focus is on the probe itself. Options B, C and D are all implied or directly stated in the text.

Therefore, option A is the statement that's *not* supported by the passage.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okuchaza ngokuqondile i-lunar probe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukushayisa kwayo kube yimpumelelo.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...and successfully maneuvered towards the south of the Moon."" This directly confirms the mission was successful in maneuvering and reaching its target.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ifike eduze ne-nyakatho yenyanga (It arrived near the north of the Moon):** The passage explicitly says it went *south*, not north.
* **C: Ikhishwe inabantu phakathi i-orbiter (It was launched with people inside the orbiter):** The passage mentions the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter, but doesn't say it carried people. The MIP is a probe.
* **D: Beyiphethe izinsimbi ezimbili ezibalulekile (It carried two important instruments):** The passage mentions carrying *three* important scientific instruments, not just two.

Therefore, option B is the only one directly supported by the text."
"Ngokuya kwalomusho, iziphi izinyathelo okumelwe zithathwe ukuzivikela ngenxa yesifo?","The correct answer is **D: Amakhethini wemiyane (Snake charmers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the disease is transmitted to humans through snake bites. Therefore, protecting oneself from snake bites is the primary preventative measure mentioned. Snake charmers are directly involved with snakes, making them at higher risk and thus a focus of the preventative measures described (and the context suggests protecting *from* them).

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

*   **A: Amanzi abulala izinambuzane (Snake killing water):** While related to snake control, it's a method *used* by authorities, not a direct preventative measure for individuals.
*   **B: Ababambi bezingulube (Snake catchers):** They are part of the response to the outbreak (catching snakes), not a preventative measure for the general public.
*   **C: Imigomo yesifo sengqondo (Snake venom antivenom):** Antivenom is for *treating* snake bites after they occur, not preventing them in the first place.

"
Isifo sidlulela kanjani ebantwini?,"The correct answer is **A: Imiyane**.

The text states: ""Lesi sifo sitholakala ezingulubeni, esidlulela ebantwini ngominyane."" which translates to ""The disease was found in the big cats, and spreads to humans through ticks.""
"
Ukuhluleka komusho wesibili kungaholela kumuphi umphumela?,"The correct answer is **B: Amalungelo wakusasa wobulili obufanayo agunyazwa inyunyana yabantu.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ukwehluleka kwesigwebo sesibili, esifaka isiphakamiso ukwenqabeli umshado wokuhlalisana okusemthethweni kwabantu bobulili obufanayo, kungavulela umnyango ukuhlalisana okusemthethweni esikhathini esizayo."" This directly indicates that the failure of the second chamber to act on the amendment *could* lead to the legalization of same-sex marriage in the future.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukubuyekeza ngokushesha iHJR-3:**  The passage mentions HJR-3 will be reviewed, but not *immediately* after the failure of the second chamber. It will depend on the elected lawmakers of 2015 or 2016.
* **C: Umthetho wezokuphuthuma wesikhathi:** The passage doesn't mention anything about a time-sensitive law.
* **D: Ukunqabela ubulili obufanayo kuma nyunyana wabantu:** The amendment *aimed* to prevent this, so its failure doesn't lead to the *opposite* outcome.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, umusho wesibili ususwe nini?","The correct answer is **C: Ngomsombuluko**.

The passage states: ""Ushintsho lwenziwe kulengxenye yomthetho lapho imusho wesibili wasuswa okokuqala yi-House of Representatives futhi wadluliswa ngendlela efanayo yi-Senate Monday."" This translates to ""The change was made to a section of the law where the second sentence was removed first by the House of Representatives and then passed in the same way by the Senate Monday.""  Therefore, the second sentence was removed on Monday.
"
Yaphumela kubani ngokungemthetho i“Panama Papers”?,"The correct answer is **A: Inkampani kaMossack Fonseca**.

The text states that the ""Amaphepha wasePanama"" (Panama Papers) are a collection of nearly ten million documents *from the law firm Mossack Fonseca*. Therefore, the illegal activity originated with that company. While the news outlets published the documents and the banks were involved in facilitating the activities, the source of the documents and the core of the scandal lies with Mossack Fonseca.

Option D is incorrect as the text mentions leaders of Iceland (Icelandic leaders) but doesn't say they were the ones who committed the illegal activity.
"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, bezindaba baseBritish bebathi ubani olawula umnotho wamakhampani njengoba ufihliwe?","The correct answer is **C: Ibhange laseDeutshce**.

The text states: ""Iphephandaba laseBhrithani iThe Guardian lisikisele ukuthi iDeutsche Bank yayilawula cishe ingxenye yesithathu yezinkampani eziseceleni ezingu-1200 ezisetshenziselwe ukufeza lokhu."" This directly indicates that the Deutsche Bank was controlling the hidden economy of these companies.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo izindiza ezibe nengozi okulimelee abantu kakhulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Indiza iphahlazeke endleleni eza e-Armenia esuka e-Iran.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ngenyanga edlule i-Iran yavelelwa inhlekelele enkulu yezindiza ngemva kweminyaka lapho indiza eyayiphokophele e-Armenia yaphahlazeka khona, yabulala abangu-168 ababekuyo."" (Last month, Iran experienced a major plane disaster after years when a plane crashed in Armenia, killing 168 people on board.)
* Option A directly refers to this event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Indiza enophephela emhlane uyamaphoyisa iphahlazekile:** While the plane crash of a police helicopter is mentioned, the text explicitly states it killed only three and injured three, making it less deadly than the Armenia crash.
* **C: Indiza iphahlazeke endleleni eza e- esuka Irane esuka e-Iran:** This is a repetition and grammatically incorrect.
* **D: Ukuphahlazeka kwendiza eMashhad:** The text says the Mashhad crash killed ten, which is less deadly than the Armenia crash.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona isizathu sokuba inengi lezingozi zendiza zenzeka e-Iran?,"The correct answer is **A: Uquqaba lwezindiza zempi zakudala**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on the poor condition and lack of new aircraft in Iran.** It explicitly states that ""many old, poorly maintained aircraft are used for both civilian and military purposes"" and that ""international sanctions mean new aircraft cannot be purchased.""
* **B: Ukungabi nemali yokuvumela kuthengwe izindiza ezintsha:**  This is directly supported by the statement about international sanctions.
* **C: Amaqembu anqabela ukuba kuthengwe izindiza ezintsha:** This aligns with the reason for the lack of new aircraft – the sanctions prevent purchases.
* **D: Ukunakekelwa kwezindiza ngezinga eliphansi:** The passage explicitly mentions ""poorly maintained aircraft"" as a contributing factor to the dangers.
* **A: Uquqaba lwezindiza zempi zakudala:** While old aircraft *are* a problem, the passage doesn't emphasize a *lack of new military aircraft* as the primary issue. The emphasis is on the overall problem of aging and poorly maintained planes, both civilian and military, due to sanctions. The passage does not highlight the problem of *old military aircraft* being the core of the issue.

Therefore, the statement about the aging military aircraft is not the primary or most direct reason for the dangers described in the passage."
Ikuphi okungabikwanga kureport okuvela kuIraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **B: Umthetho enoshintsho, ubudlova obukhona e-Iraq bungaqedwa.**

Here's why:

The report explicitly states that ""Akekho ongaqinisekisa ukuthi nanoma iyiphi inkambo e-Iraq okwamanje izoqeda impi yamahlelo, ubudlova obukhulayo, noma ukuthambekela ebuxakalaleni."" This means the report *doesn't* claim a solution exists or that the violence *can* be stopped with the current approach.  It highlights the uncertainty and lack of guaranteed success.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukugxekwa kwemithetho yamanje:** The report *does* heavily criticize the current policies.
* **C: Imvume yokuvelela imincele yase-Iraq:** The report *requests* an open dialogue and cooperation in the US regarding the Middle East situation, which implies a willingness to listen to Iraq's concerns.
* **D: Isicelo esenziwa i-US consesus:** The report calls for a shift in policy and cooperation *in the US*, suggesting the current US consensus isn't working and needs to change.



"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okunganxuswanga i-Iraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuqinisekswa besivumalwo sokuyela ubudlova**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Iraq Study Group ""criticizes almost all aspects of the current U.S. policy in Iraq"" and ""calls for a swift change in course."" It also emphasizes the need for dialogue and cooperation. While the passage mentions the need to take steps to secure Iraq's borders, it **doesn't explicitly state that the group *doesn't* want to ensure a cessation of violence.** In fact, the entire premise of the report is to *end* the violence. 

The passage *does* mention the need for:

* **B: Ukushitsha indlela ngokushesha (a swift change in course)**
* **C: Ukusebenzisa kokukhulumisana (the use of dialogue)** 
* **D: Ukusungulwa kwemithetho emisha (the establishment of new rules)** - implied by the need for a change in policy.



Therefore, the statement the report *doesn't* address is ensuring a cessation of violence, even though that's the overall goal.



"
"Ngokuya ngamaphoyisa, ubani ebebamucabangela ukuthi bekamphathi wezinto zakaProvenzano?","The correct answer is **B: i-Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""Amaphoyisa athe uLo Piccolo uyaphumelela ngoba abe yisithenjwa sikaProvenzano ePalermo..."" (The police say that Lo Piccolo succeeded because he became a trusted lieutenant of Provenzano in Palermo...).
"
"Ngokuya nge-information enikeziwe lapha, kwakuyini imbangela yokufa kwakaFalcone?","The correct answer is **A: Wabulawa ngesikhathi sempi yakaRiina**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Provenzano once ended the war led by Riina against the kingdom of Mafia that killed Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992."" This directly links Falcone and Borsellino's deaths to the war between Riina and Provenzano. While the text doesn't detail the exact circumstances of their killings, it explicitly places them within the context of that conflict.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **B: Wabulawa maphoyisa:** The text doesn't suggest police were responsible.
*   **C: ULo Poccolo watshela ukuba ambulale:** There's no mention of Lo Piccolo being involved in Falcone's murder.
*   **D: Wabulawa omunye wezigebengu obekasebenza naye uPaolo Borsellino:** The text doesn't specify who killed Falcone and Borsellino.

Therefore, option A is the only one logically derived from the provided text."
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungekona imiklomelo kaHitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **B: Usihlalo wekomidi wawonke kuhlanganise eJapan Judo Federation**.

Here's why:

* The passage states he was the chairman of the All Japan Judo Federation's training committee. It *doesn't* say he was the chairman of the entire federation.
* The passage *does* mention he won two Olympic gold medals (C).
* The passage *does* mention he was a two-time World Champion (A).
* The passage states he was a Judo expert (D).

Therefore, the only statement that's *not* mentioned in the text is that he was the chairman of the entire federation.
"
Kukuphi lapho uIwasaki ebalekela ukwenza izifungo?,"The correct answer is **B: eNepal**.

The text states: ""wabalekela umshado e-Nepal"" which translates to ""he escaped a wedding in Nepal"".
"
Ubani ohlasele uIwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: Inja**.

The text states that Iwasaki was attacked by a rabid dog in Tibet.
"
Umjaho uwumise nini?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngemva kokuthi uSchumacher aqede umdlalo wakhe**.

The text states: ""Umichael Schumacher waqeda umjaho wakhe kungekudala ngemva kuka-Alonso..."" which directly indicates that Schumacher finishing his race is when the race effectively ended for him. While other events contributed to the race's conclusion, Schumacher's retirement is explicitly mentioned as happening soon after Alonso's issue.
"
Yini ebangele uSchumacher aqede umdlalo kusese early?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukumosheka elingenzansi kwemoto**.

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher waqeda umjaho wakhe kungekudala ngemva kuka-Alonso, ngenxa yokulimala kwesimo esigcina imoto iphakeme emishikashikeni eminingi phakathi nomjaho."" This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher finished his race soon after Alonso, due to damage from an incident that left the car elevated in many crashes during the race.""

While the text mentions crashes, it specifically attributes Schumacher's early retirement to damage caused by being elevated in crashes, which implies an issue with the underside of the car getting damaged.  The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Ngokuya walomusho, ubani okumelwe akhiphe ama-bail wabantu ababoshiwe?","The correct answer is **D: Ukhomishani was-court**.

The passage states: ""Ukhomishinali ubeka ibheyili, uma inikezwa..."" This directly indicates that the court commissioner is responsible for setting bail.
"
"Ngokuya kokubamba isigebengu okwesikhashaba,ikuphi ababoshiwe okumelwe babe nakho ukuze bavunyelwe bagedwe amahora angu24?","The correct answer is **A: Bail**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ukhomishinali ubeka ibheyili, uma inikezwa, futhi wenza ukubekwa kwecala okwenziwe yiphoyisa elibophe isiboshwa kube ngokomthetho."" This means bail is a requirement for the prisoner to be released after being held for more than 24 hours without formal charges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuhlangana namaphoyisa abophayo:** While interaction with police is part of the process, it's not the *requirement* for release on bail.
* **C: Amacala aqondiwe akhishwe uJudge Glynn:** The Judge's temporary restraining order *prevented* further detentions, but it doesn't explain the requirement for release after 24 hours.
* **D: Ukuyolalela icala:**  The prisoner needs to appear in court later to answer the charges, but that doesn't grant release after 24 hours.



"
"Ngokusho kwesiqephu, isiphi isizathu esingachazwanga mayelana nokususwa kwe-runoff?","The correct answer is **D: Ukungaqondakali okukhona emthethweni (Lack of sufficient legal basis)**.

The passage states that ""Amanxusa athe athole ukungacaci okwanele emthethweni-sisekelo wase-Afghanistan ukunquma ukuthi ukhetho oluqhubekayo aludingeki."" This directly points to the lack of a solid legal justification as the reason for the decision.

While the other options might be contributing factors (safety concerns, costs, legal opposition), the passage explicitly highlights the lack of a proper legal basis as the core issue."
Kungani amanxusa agcizelela ukungabi nasidingo kwe-runoff?,"The correct answer is **C: Bekunokuphikisana phakathi emthethweni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amanxusa athe athole ukungacaci okwanele emthethweni-sisekelo wase-Afghanistan ukunquma ukuthi ukhetho oluqhubekayo aludingeki."" This directly points to a conflict or lack of clear legal basis for the decision to halt the election.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ihambe ngokumelene nomthetho:** While the actions *might* be against the law, the passage explicitly says there's *no sufficient legal basis* for the decision, implying a legal conflict rather than just a disregard for the law.
* **B: Kube nezingozi zokuphepha:** The passage mentions safety concerns as a reason *for* the decision, but it doesn't say the lack of a legal basis is *because* of safety concerns.
* **D: Ukhetho belubiza kakhulu:** The cost of the election isn't mentioned as a reason for the decision.



"
Ubani onikela iFATA isevisi yokwahlulela?,"The correct answer is **A: Uhulumeni wasePakistan**.

The passage states: ""...uMongameli wasePakistan umise ""Abaphatheli Bombusazwe"" ukuba babuse iFATA, abanokulawula okucishe kuphelele kulezi zindawo. Laba baphatheli banomthwalo wokunikeza izinkonzo zikahulumeni **n kanye nezokwahlulela** ngaphansi koMthetho 247 woMthetho-sisekelo wasePakistan.""

This clearly indicates that the Pakistani government, through the appointed tribal rangers, is responsible for providing judicial services in FATA.
"
Ikuphi okulandelayo okungelona iqiniso “Ngabasebenzi besePolotiki yeFATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Bakhethwe umongameli wasePakistani**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the ""Azadi March"" appointed the tribal leaders to govern FATA.**  It doesn't mention they are elected by the Pakistani President. The tribal leaders were chosen *before* Pakistan was formed, and this structure has persisted.

* **A: Banikeza isevisi yokwahlulela (Provide judicial services):**  The text explicitly states they provide judicial services under Legal Framework 247. This is true.

* **C: Balandela ngokuqophelela umthetho wasePakistani (Strictly follow Pakistani law):** The passage mentions they operate *under* Pakistani law, implying a degree of adherence. This is likely true, although the text doesn't explicitly detail the extent to which they *strictly* follow it.  However, it's a reasonable assumption.

* **D: Banokulawula okuphelele ezindaweni ezithile (Have complete control of certain areas):**  The passage states they have near-complete control of FATA. This is true.



Therefore, the statement that is *not* supported by the passage is that the tribal leaders are elected by the Pakistani President.



"
Yimuphi umklomelo uEmma akhethwe kuwo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umlingisikazi obadlula bonke**.

The text states: ""Ifilimu, eno-Ryan Gosling noEmma Stone, ikhethelwe ukuwina kuzo zonke izigaba ezinkulu."" which translates to ""The film, starring Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone, has been nominated to win in all major categories."" The question asks where Emma Stone was nominated for an award, and the text directly states she was nominated for ""all major categories,"" implying an award for acting.
"
Yimuphi umklomelo imuvi engakhethwanga kuyo?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuhlanganiswa Komsindo Okuhle Kakhulu**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Ukuhlanganiswa Komsindo Okuhle Kakhulu"" is *included* in the categories of nominees, but ""Isithombe esizidlula bonke"" (Best Picture), ""Indlela Enhle Okuvezwa Ngayo Okubukwayo"" (Best Cinematography), and ""Ingoma Emnandi Eqanjiwe"" (Best Original Song) are not mentioned as being part of the nominees.

Therefore, the movie was not nominated in the category of Best Sound Mixing.
"
Yiziphi izinto ezilandelayo ezaqhubeka zisebenza ngemva kokuzamazama komhlaba?,"The correct answer is **B: Isikhumulo sezindiza e-Ishikawa**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""neSikhumulo Sezindiza saseNoto sasesifundazweni sase-Ishikawa sisavaliwe."" (and the Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture was closed).
* The text mentions the power plants (Kashiwazaki-Kariwa) and power lines being affected, but doesn't specify if those industries immediately resumed operation.
* The text mentions train service disruptions, but doesn't say that trains were running afterwards.

Therefore, the only thing explicitly stated as being affected and having its operational status mentioned as being closed is the Ishikawa airport.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yiziphi izinto ezilandelayo ezilimele ngenxa yokuzamazama komhlaba?","The correct answer is **A: Amanye amakhaya (Some homes)** and **C: Eminye imigwaqo (Some roads)** and **D: Isikhumulo Sezindiza EsiseNoto (Noto Airport)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:**
    * ""Amakhaya angaba ngu-9400 endaweni awanawo amanzi..."" (Around 9400 homes in the area have no water...) - This implies homes were affected.
    * ""Eminye imigwaqo ibe nomonakalo..."" (Some roads were damaged...) - This directly states roads were damaged.
    * ""...neSikhumulo Sezindiza saseNoto sasesifundazweni sase-Ishikawa sisavaliwe."" (...and Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture was closed.) - This directly states the airport was closed.

* **B: Imishini emibili kwezempi eShika (Two military facilities in Ishikawa)**  The text *doesn't* mention any damage to military facilities.

Therefore, options A, C, and D are all accurate based on the information provided.  Since only one answer can be chosen, and the question asks which *of the following* things were damaged,  A, C, and D are the best answers, however, since you have to pick just one, and considering the scale of the water shortage, **A: Amanye amakhaya (Some homes)** is arguably the most significant impact mentioned in the text. However, all three are correct.
"
"Ngokwendaba, iziphi izinkinga ezingafakwanga kuyidokhuyumenti?","The correct answer is **B: Imbangela yempi yango-1967**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states the document will discuss the **borders** and the Palestinian desire for statehood *before* the 1967 Six-Day War.  While the war is a crucial context, the document's focus isn't on *why* the war happened. The text is specifically about the border situation *leading up to* the war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ikusasa leJerusalem (The future of Jerusalem):** The text mentions Jerusalem as a topic, so it *could* be included.
*   **C: Ukuba khona kwezempiesigodini (The presence of militias):** The text touches on the presence of Israeli troops in Jerusalem, so it *could* be included.
*   **D: Ukumpikiswano emayelana nemingcele (Disputes over borders):** The text explicitly mentions disputes over borders as a key topic.

Therefore, the war's *cause* is the only issue specifically excluded based on the information given.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungekho phakathi kwezinto ezifunwa yiPalestine?,"The correct answer is **D: Unyaka wesihlanu kukhona ezempi eSigodini SaseJordan**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Palestine wants borders based on pre-1967 borders.
* It mentions the future of Jerusalem as a key issue.
* It references the issue of the Church of Jordan.
* **Crucially, the passage says the PA is willing to have Israeli soldiers present in Jordan for *five years* if a treaty is signed.** Option D directly contradicts this by suggesting a longer period of Israeli military presence.

Therefore, the statement that the Palestine wants Israeli soldiers to be present for five years in Jordan is *not* among the things they are seeking, according to the provided text. The other options are all mentioned as concerns or requests of the Palestine.
"
U-Ma wazifundela kuliphi izwe ezomthetho?,"The correct answer is **A: E-United States of America**.

The passage states: ""uMa wafunda eNyuvesi yaseNew York naseSikoleni soMthetho sase-Havard futhi wabuye waba “nomazisi” waseMelika...""  This clearly indicates he studied in the United States.
"
"Ngokwendaba, ukungenelwa kwaliphi izwe okwasiza u-Ma ekuphumeleleni kokhetho ?","The correct answer is **A: E-United States of America**.

The text states that Ma became a ""permanent resident"" of the United States and that Hsieh suggested Ma flee to the US during the crisis.
"
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, uCarolyn Wilson wasebenzela ubani ngaphambi kokuhamba edolobheni?","The correct answer is **C: I-OHA**.

The text states: ""Lapho abaqashi beqala ukukhuluma ngalokho okwenzeke kubo, iningi lemindeni ehilelekile laqapela ngokushesha ukuthi uCarolyn Wilson we-OHA webe imali yabo yesibambiso, futhi wabaleka edolobheni."" This clearly indicates that Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA (Oregon Housing Authority) before fleeing.
"
"Njengoba kusele imijaho emine kule nkathi, ubani osendaweni yesine kuyi-Drivers Championship?","The answer is **D: UBowyer**.

The text states: ""Okwesithathu, i-Hamlin isele emuva ngamaphuzu ayishumi nambili, kodwa amahlanu ngaphambi kuka-Bowyer."" This means Bowyer is fourth.
"
"Umjaho olandelayo okukhulunywe ngawo kule ndaba, uKahne unamaphoyinti amangaki kuyiDrivers’ Championship?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""UKahne kanye ne-Truex, i-Jr. ingeyesihlanu kanye nesithupha ngokulandelana ngamaphuzu angu-2,220 nangu-2,207."" This means Kahne has 2220 points.

"Ngokwendaba, sekukangaki abantu bebona kuwa uhlobo oluthile lwetshe kamuva okwabonakala ukuthi imvelaphi yalo eyase-martian?","The correct answer is **A: Izikhathi eziyishumi**.

The passage states: ""Amadwala ayishumi nanhlanlan kulawa kuthiwa enziwe amatshe awa emkhathini ngoJulayi odlule."" (Fifteen of these are said to be meteorites that fell to Earth last July.)

This means fifteen meteorites were discovered, and the question asks how many *times* a certain type of Martian-origin stone has been seen. The passage refers to the 15 meteorites discovered last July, so the answer is ""Izikhathi eziyishumi"" (Fifteen times). However, the closest answer to the option listed is **A: Izikhathi eziyishumi** because the question is asking how many specific meteorites have been seen that are confirmed to be Martian.

Let me re-evaluate this. The question asks about ""how many times a *certain type* of Martian-origin stone has been seen *later*"". The passage states that 34 out of 24,000 meteorites are confirmed to be Martian. Of those 34, 15 were discovered last July. So, the answer should refer to the 15 meteorites discovered in July. 

Looking at the options, **A: Izikhathi eziyishumi** (Fifteen times) is the best fit, even though it's worded slightly differently than what's explicitly stated. The question implies how many times *specifically* Martian meteorites have been observed, and the passage provides the count of those observed last July.

Given the available options and the passage, I must choose A. There seems to be a slight ambiguity in the question's wording. However, ""Izikhathi eziyishumi"" is the best interpretation of what the passage conveys about the discovery of Martian meteorites in July.



"
"Njengoba kubonisiwe endabeni, yini eyiqiniso ngetshe elitholakale ukuthi imvelaphi yalo eyase-martian?","The correct answer is **D: Angu-34**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Phakathi kwamatshe acishe abe ngu-24,000 awaziwayo awele eMhlabeni, cishe angu-34 kuphela aqinisekiswe ukuthi avela e-Mars."" This translates to ""Among nearly 24,000 unknown meteorites that fell to Earth, only about 34 have been confirmed to have come from Mars.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wonke atholakala phakathi ne-July meteorite shower:** While 15 of the confirmed Martian meteorites were found during a July meteor shower, not *all* of them were.
* **B: Angu-24,000:** This is the total number of *unknown* meteorites, not the number confirmed to be Martian.
* **C: Alinganiselwa ku-$11,000 ngaphezulu kwegolide:**  While some Martian meteorites are very expensive, the passage compares their price to gold, not sets a price limit.



"
USchumacher wawuthatha nini umhlalaphansi?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngemva kokunqoba indebe yakhe yesikhombisa**.

The question states: ""P: UShumacher othathe umhlalaphansi ngo-2006 ngomva kokuwina umncintiswano weFormula 1 izikhathi eziyisikhombisa..."" which translates to ""P: Schumacher retired in 2006 after winning his Formula 1 championship...""
"
Walimala nini uMassa?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngaphambi kokuthatha umhlalaphansi kukaSchumacher**.

The text states that Felipe Massa was seriously injured in a collision during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, and he was unable to race for the entire 2009 season. This happened *before* Michael Schumacher retired in 2006.
"
"Ngokwendaba, amalungiselelo azoyithinta kanjani i-AOL?","The most logical answer is **C: Inani labasebenzisa i-AOL lizoqhudelana nabasebenzisa i-Yahoo kanye neMicrosoft.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Ngokusebenza kwaleli lungiselelo, inkululeko ingaphela."" This implies a shift in the market, where AOL's dominance is being challenged.
* **The passage also states:** ""Isibalo sabasebenzisa izinkonzo ze-Yahoo! ne-Microsoft sihlangene sizodlula isibalo samakhasimende we-AOL.""  This directly indicates increased competition.

Therefore, the most likely outcome is that AOL will face increased competition for users.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Kungenzeka ande amanani abasebenzisa i-AOL** - While possible, the passage focuses on the market shift, not necessarily a direct price increase.
* **B: I-AOL izoyiphatha yodwa inkampani ethuthukisa ukukhangiswa kwe-IM** - This isn't directly supported by the passage and is a weaker inference.
* **D: I-AOL angeke isasetshenziswa e-United States** -  The passage doesn't suggest AOL will disappear from the US; it simply indicates a change in its market position.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kuphele kulandela isivumelwano esisha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukusetshenziswa kwe-IM mayelana nokudayisa.**

Here's why:

The passage states that AOL has been driving the IM market's growth and that the combined user base of Yahoo! and Microsoft will surpass AOL's. This suggests a shift in power and influence within the IM market.

Therefore, a likely consequence of this shift is that the *usage of IM for advertising* will change.  The passage hints that the increased competition and growth might impact how IM is used for marketing and sales.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ukuthuthukiswa okusabalele kwe-inthanethi e-United States:** While the overall internet may continue to grow, the passage focuses specifically on the IM market and the competitive dynamics within it.
* **C: Inkululeko ye-AOL yokuthuthukisa ezokudayisa ngendlela ethanda ngayo:**  The passage implies that AOL's dominance is waning. A new agreement would likely *limit* AOL's freedom, not enhance it.
* **D: Ukubambisana kweYahoo kanye neMicrosoft:** The question asks what *will end* as a result of a new agreement. The agreement is *creating* a partnership between Yahoo! and Microsoft, not ending it.



"
Bangaki abantu ababulawa ngesikhathi kuhlaselwa ababengewona amaphoyisa?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The question asks about civilians killed. The text states that ""yalimaza abantu abanye abangaphezu kweshumi nambili"" (injured more than twenty other people) and ""Ibhomu esemotweni eqhume esikhungweni samaphoyisa eGaziantep...ibulale amaphoyisa amabili"" (A car bomb exploded at the police headquarters in Gaziantep...killed two police officers).  The question specifically asks about civilians killed, and the text does not state that any civilians were killed. Therefore, the answer is 2 (the two police officers killed are not civilians).
"
Ubani owabika owayesolwa kulokho kuhlasela?,"The correct answer is **A: Amaphoyisa**.

The text states: ""Amaphoyisa athi asola osolwa ngokuba isosha leDaesh (ISIL) elinesikhundla ngenxa yalokhu kuhlasela.""  This translates to ""The police said they suspect the accused to be a Daesh (ISIL) member with a position because of this attack.""
"
"Ngenxa yesimo sendawo yaseFlorida sokuthi owinile uthatha konke, yimuphi umklomelo owanikezwa uMitt Romney?","The correct answer is **C: Zonke izithunywa zombuso**.

The passage states: ""Njengoba owina lesi sifunda ethatha konke, iFlorida inklomelise uRomney ngazo zonke izihambeli zayo ezingu-50...""  This means he received all 50 electoral votes from Florida.
"
"Ngokwendaba, uGingrich wathola amaphesenti amangaki amavoti okhethweni lokuqala?","The correct answer is **B: Amaphesenti angu-32**.

The text states: ""Owayengumkhulumeli Wendlu i-Newt Gingrich e-U.S. ube ngowesibili ngamaphesenti angu-32."""
"Ngokwendaba, ubani ongazange aqhubeke nokufuna isikhundla ngemva kwemiphumela yamakhokhasi?","The correct answer is **B: UBachmann**.

The passage explicitly states: ""UBachmann, owawina Ukuvota kwe-Ames Straw ngo-Agasti, wanquma ukuqeda umkhankaso."" This means she decided to end her campaign.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: UGingrich:** The passage mentions Gingrich speaking to Santorum and having harsh words for Romney, but it doesn't say he ended his campaign.
* **C: UPerry:** The passage says Perry will ""stay in the race and compete in the South Carolina primary on February 21st.""
* **D: URomney:**  The passage mentions Romney being the target of negative ads from Gingrich, but it doesn't say Romney ended his campaign.



"
"Ngokwendaba, ubani owayikhulumela kahle imbangi ngemva kwemiphumela yamakhakhasi?","The correct answer is **B: UGingrich**.

The text states: ""Ngemva kokuba kufike imiphumela, uGingrich ubabaze uSantorum, kodwa wayenamazwi anzima kuRomney, lowo owenzelwa umkhankaso wezikhangiso ezimbi e-Iowa ngokumelene noGingrich."" This clearly indicates Gingrich was speaking out strongly after the results.
"
Iyiphi okwakuwukuphela kwendawo ebonisa indawo uhlelo olwalufakiwe kulo ngaphambi kuka-2015?,"The correct answer is **A: Umsakazo iTogiNet**.

The passage states: ""Ngesikhathi lusaqala, lolu hlelo lwalufaka lodwa isikhathi eside emsakazweni we-inthanethi i-TogiNet..."" This directly indicates that TogiNet was the only place the program was broadcast before 2015.
"
Isiteshi sichaza uhlelo njengolunezinhlelo ezinjani?,"The correct answer is **B: IGeeky**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Iwebhusayithi yesiteshi ichaza uhlelo """"njengomdlalo womsakazo odla ngoludala onokwaziswa okusha kwezobuchwepheshe!"""" (The station's website describes the program as an old-fashioned radio game with new technology news!). The use of ""new technology news"" combined with the description of being ""old-fashioned"" suggests a ""geeky"" or tech-enthusiast leaning.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Amafunda (Academic):** While there's a learning aspect, it's not the primary descriptor.
*   **C: I-Old school:**  This is partially true (it's old-fashioned), but it doesn't capture the technology aspect.
*   **D: Okwendawo (Local):** The program is described as being hosted by amateur voice actors from East Texas, indicating a local element, but not the overall defining characteristic of the program itself.



"
Yini lena uDavid Headley ayihlanganisa eyasiza kakhulu ukuhlasela kweqembu lezidlamlilo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ulwazi (Information)**.

The text states: ""Ukuhlola nokuqongelela ukwaziswa kukaDavid Headley kwasiza ekuvumeleni umsebenzi wamasosha..."" This directly indicates that David Headley's information was crucial in enabling the terrorists' operation.  The other options describe elements *of* the attack, not what Headley *provided*.
"
Yiluphi uhlobo lwezokuthutha olwasetshenziswa yiqembu lezidlamlilo lapho zibheke eMumbai?,"The correct answer is **A: Isitimela**.

The text states that the attackers targeted the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus, which is a major train station in Mumbai.
"
Yisiphi isitatimende eziwuveza kahle imiphumela womidlalo kaNadal kanye noRaonic kwiBrisbane Open obalulwe kule ndaba?,"The correct answer is **C: UNadal ubhaxabule uRaonic**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Usanda kwehluleka muva nje ebhekene no-Raonic eBrisbane Open."" This translates to ""He recently lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open.""  Therefore, Nadal lost to Raonic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: URaonic ubhaxabule uNadal** - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **B: URaonic ube namaphuzu angamaphesenti angu-88** - This refers to Nadal's win percentage, not Raonic's.
* **D: URaonic ufake amaphuzu angu-76** - This refers to Nadal's total points won in the first set, not Raonic's.



"
"Ngokwendaba, umdlalo kaNadal noRaonic wawukusiphi isigaba ngemva kokuqalwa komdlalo?","The correct answer is **B: UNadal wawina ngamaphuzu angu-76**.

The text states: ""UNadal uthole amaphuzu angu-88% ahlangene emaphuzwini angu-76 okuwina umdlalo engxenyeni yokuqala."" This directly indicates that Nadal won 76 points.
"
Yiluphi uhlelo lolimi olungafakiwe emsakazweni emithathu emisha yeNaked News?,"The correct answer is **D: IsiPenishi**.

The text explicitly states that the new language programs are in Spanish, Italian, and Korean.  Portuguese is not mentioned."
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi lapho ingeke itholakale khona iNaked News?","The correct answer is **C: Endaweni yokubuka amamuvi**.

Here's why:

The news states that Naked News is expanding its language coverage to include television, the internet, and mobile devices.  It doesn't mention them being located in movie theaters. The other options are all places where you *can* find content now or potentially in the future, given the expansion.



"
Zingaki izimbangi ezingazange ziyiqede iGiant Slalom?,"The correct answer is **B: 117**.

Here's why:

The text states that 4 female alpine skiers failed to finish their Giant Slalom run, and 45 female alpine skiers failed to finish their Giant Slalom run in slalom.

Therefore, the total number of female alpine skiers who failed to finish the Giant Slalom is 4 + 45 = 49.

However, the question asks for the number of competitors who *didn't* finish the *Giant Slalom*. The passage also mentions that 36 skiers had the same result as Carpanedo in the Slalom, which implies they didn't finish that race. It also says 117 skiers failed to finish their slalom run.

So to answer the question, we should consider that 45 skiers failed to finish their giant slalom run. The passage also mentions that 4 female alpine skiers failed to finish their giant slalom run. Therefore, we should add those skiers to the total number of skiers who failed to finish their giant slalom run, resulting in 45 + 4 = 49.

The question asks for the number of competitors who *didn't* finish the *Giant Slalom*. The passage also mentions that 36 skiers had the same result as Carpanedo in the Slalom, which implies they didn't finish that race. It also says 117 skiers failed to finish their slalom run.

So, we should choose the answer that represents the total number of competitors who didn't finish the giant slalom. It is mentioned that 45 skiers failed to finish their giant slalom run.

Therefore, the answer is **B: 117**.

**There is some confusion in the prompt.** The prompt presents a seemingly contradictory situation. It states that 45 skiers failed the *Slalom* race, yet the question asks about *Giant Slalom*. It is also stated that 4 skiers failed the *Giant Slalom*, and that 117 skiers failed the *Slalom* race.

Based on the available text, the most appropriate answer is **B: 117** as it represents the number of competitors who failed the *Slalom* race. However, if the question is really asking about *Giant Slalom*, then the prompt is flawed, as the text does not provide an adequate answer.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende esilandelayo esiyiveza kahle imiphumela yomjaho weChampionships?,"The correct answer is **C: Abatshuzi abaningi bayiqeda iGiant Slalom kuneSlalom (More racers finished the Giant Slalom than the Slalom)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""36 out of 116 racers had the same result in that Slalom race."" This means a significant portion (36/116) *didn't* finish the Slalom race.
* **The passage also states:** ""four downhill racers in the women's downhill failed to finish their races...""  and ""...45 out of 117 downhill racers failed to get a position in the Giant Slalom."" This means a large number of racers failed to finish the Giant Slalom.
* **However:** The text doesn't directly state how *many* finished each race. The question focuses on how many *failed* to finish, which is more directly addressed by the numbers provided. 
* **Option C** implies that a larger number of racers completed the Giant Slalom compared to the Slalom. While not explicitly stated, it's the most logical conclusion based on the information available and the fact that a large number failed in both races.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emjahweni wesibili, uCarpenado waqeda ngaphambi komtshuzi waseHungary (In the second race, Carpenado finished before the Hungarian racer).** The passage doesn't mention the position of the Hungarian racer relative to Carpenado.
* **B: Abatshuzi abangu-45 abazange baqede umjaho wabo kuyiGiant Slalom (45 racers failed their Giant Slalom race).** While true, this statement doesn't provide a good overall summary of the *results* of the championships as a whole.
* **D: UCarpenado walala indawo yeshumi kuyiSlalom (Carpenado finished in tenth place in the Slalom).** The passage states Carpenado failed the Slalom, not that he finished tenth.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo iNBA eyakhetha ukukuyeka?,"The correct answer is **A: Inkathi ye-basketball (The season)**.

The passage states the NBA suspended *all* professional basketball games for the season due to COVID-19 concerns. While the Utah Jazz player's diagnosis was the catalyst, the decision was to pause the entire season.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyaholela ekukhathazekeni kweNBA ngokuphathelene negciwane?","The correct answer is **D: Umdlali we-Utah Jazz watholakala enegciwane**.

The text explicitly states: ""Isinqumo se-NBA silandele lapho umdlali we-Utah Jazz etholakale ukuthi unegciwane le-COVID-19."" (The NBA's decision followed when a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19.)

While options A and B are related, option D is the *direct* cause mentioned in the text that led to the league halting all games. Option C is not mentioned.
"
Ubani owafaka igoli lokuwina kwiWashington Capitals emdlalweni wayo ne-Atlanta Thrashers?,"The correct answer is **A: UNicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Usizo luka-Ovechkin lokuqala lobusuku bekuyigoli elinqoba umqhudelwano ngosanda kuqala u-Nicklas backstrom"".
"
Ubani owafaka igoli lesi-60 emdlalweni owawuphakathi kweCapitals neThrashers?,"The correct answer is **C: U-Alex Ovechkin**.

The text states: ""Igoli lakhe lobusuku bekungelama-60 lesizini, eba ngumdlali wokuqala wokushaya amagoli angu-60 noma ngaphezulu ngesizini kusukela ngo-1995-96, lapho uJaromir Jagr noMario Lemieux befinyelela leyonqophamlando."" This directly confirms that Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in that game."
Ibhange laseNorthern Rock lakudinga nini ukusekelwa uhulumeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Phakathi nenkinga yokubanjiswa kwempahla ukuze kukhokhwe isikweletu**.

The text states: ""Northern Rock icele ukusekelwa ngenxa yokuchayeka kwayo phakathi nenhlekelele yesikweletu esibi sezindlu ngo-2007."" This directly links the need for government support to the mortgage crisis.
"
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isitatimende esilandelayo esikuchaza ngokunembile ukusebenzelana kweVirgin Group kanye nebhange iNorthern Rock?","The correct answer is **A: IVirgin Group yabe isithenga inkampani ephatha impahla yeNorthen Rock.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ng-2010, nakuba lenziwe elezwe, ibhange eliphezulu lamanje i-Northern Rock plc lahlukaniswa ‘ebhange elibi‘, i-Northern Rock (Ukuphatha Impahla) I-Virgin ithenge ‘ibhange elihle’ lase-Roch eseNyakatho kuphela, hhayi inkampani yokuphatha impahla.""  This directly translates to the Virgin Group buying the *asset management company* (inkampani ephatha impahla) of Northern Rock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: IVirgin Group yathenga ibhange ngaphambi kokuba lisetshenziswe yizwe:** The text explicitly says the bank was established *after* being established in the country.
* **C: IVirgin Group yanikeza ibhange usizo oluphuthumayo phakathi nenkinga yokubanjwa kwempahla ukuze kukhokhwe isikweletu:**  The text mentions emergency assistance given by the government, not by the Virgin Group.
* **D: IVirgin Group yenza ibhidi yokuqala yebhange ngemva kokuba ibhange lisetshenziswe yizwe:** The text indicates that the bank was divided into two entities (the 'bad bank' and the 'good bank'), and the Virgin Group purchased the 'good bank' asset management company, not making the initial bid for the entire bank after it was operational.



"
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, yiliphi izwe elathintwa ukusayinwa kweKyoto mayelana nesimo sezulu?","The correct answer is **A: United States**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Isinqumo sikaMnu. Rudd sokusayina isivumelwano sase-Kyoto sesimo sezulu sivalela ngaphandle iMelika..."" which translates to ""Mr. Rudd's decision to not sign the Kyoto climate agreement closed out the United States...""
"
Uhulumeni wangaphambili wase-Australia ucabanga ukuthi ukuqinisekiswa kwe-Kyoto kuzobangela ukulimala kwani?,"The correct answer is **B: Kwezomnotho kwezwe**.

The passage states: ""Uhulumeni wase-Australia odla ngoludala wenqabe ukuvumela iKyoto, uthi izolimaza umnotho ngokuxhomeka kwayo kakhulu ekuthunyelweni kwamalahle kwamanye amazwe...""  This directly links the government's concern with the economic impact on Australia.
"
Yiluphi uhlelo olwalungelokudubula olwaqokelwa lona?,"The correct answer is **D: Uhlelo lokuzingela lweSporting Shooters Association**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngokubambisana neNPWS kanye neSporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, amavolontiya afanelekayo abuthwa, ngaphansi kohlelo lokuzingela lweSporting Shooters Association.""
"
Yisiphi isitatimende ezingabonisi ukunemba kokuhlola kwendlela yokubulala izinambuzane?,"The correct answer is **A: Njengoba kwakuwukuhlola kokuqala kohlelo, akuzange kuhlolisiswe.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the statement that *doesn't* show a commitment to evaluating the hunting method.** The text explicitly states that the hunt was a *pilot* or *initial trial*.  If it was a trial, it logically follows that a full, comprehensive evaluation hadn't been conducted *yet*.  This doesn't mean there's no commitment to evaluation in the future, but that it's not a feature of this initial phase.

Let's look at why the other options *do* demonstrate a commitment to evaluation:

* **B: Abadubuli bathola iziqondiso zokuqeqesha:** Providing training emphasizes safety and proper procedures, which are essential for evaluating the effectiveness and responsible nature of the hunting method.
* **C: Abadubuli babegadwe umuntu oqaphile:** Having a responsible person overseeing the hunt demonstrates accountability and a commitment to ensuring the hunt is conducted safely and according to the rules, which is vital for evaluation.
* **D: Kwakhetha abadubuli abane:**  Selecting specific volunteers allows for monitoring their performance and gathering data on how the hunting method works in practice, contributing to the evaluation.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that indicates a lack of evaluation *at this stage*.



"
"Ngokwendaba, kwatholakala kuphi ukwehlukana?","The correct answer is **C: Ebufakazini bamangqamuzana**

The passage states: ""Ngokusekelwe kulomvubukulo, lokhu kusho ukuthi ukuhlukana okwangaphambili kakhulu kunalokho okwakusikiselwa ubufakazi bamangqamuzana."" This translates to: ""Based on this discovery, this means that the previous separation is much greater than what was limited by ancient evidence."" Therefore, the separation was found in **ancient evidence**.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyenzeka ngokushesha kunangesikhathi esilindelekile?","The correct answer is **B: Ukwehlukana**.

The quote states: ""This means that the earlier separation is much more extensive than what was limited by forensic evidence. This means everything has to be pushed back.""  The key word here is ""separation."" The passage implies that something is separating faster than expected, leading to the need to re-evaluate earlier findings.
"
Yini umdlali azodinga ukuyenza ukuze asebenzise ngezandla umdlalo wevidiyo?,"The correct answer is **D: Hambisa into oqondisa ngayo emoyeni (Move the controller in the air)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Lokhu kuzovumela abadlali ukuba balawule izenzo nokunyakaza emdlalweni wevidiyo ngokunyakazisa isisetshenziswa emoyeni."" (This will allow players to control actions and movement in the video game by moving the controller in the air.)

Yini eyenziwa yabukeka njengethuluzi lokusebenzisa iTv?,"The correct answer is **B: Umshini wokuqondisa iNintendo Revolution**.

The text explicitly states that the device unveiled was the ""Nintendo Revolution controller"" and describes its features. Option B is the only one that accurately identifies this device.
"
Yini engazange ishiwo embikweni wakamuva ovela kuyi-ejensi ezindaba zaseXinhau?,"The correct answer is **A: Ibhanoyi lithole izinsongo zokuthi kunebhomu**

Here's why:

* The question asks what information was *not* mentioned in the *latest* report.
* The prompt states the latest reports say the plane was targeted by a bomb.
* Option A states ""Ibhanoyi lithole izinsongo zokuthi kunebhomu"" which translates to ""The plane received intelligence that there was a bomb.""  This is information *not* mentioned in the *initial* report, but is in the *latest* reports.
* Options B, C, and D *were* mentioned in the reports, albeit with slight variations in the order of events.



Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Yini engashiwongo embikweni wokuqala ovela kuyi-enjensi yezindaba zaseXinhau?,"The correct answer is **B: Ibhanoyi alizange livunyelwe ukuhlala ngokwezimo eziphuthumayo.**

Here's why:

The question asks what information was **not** in the initial report. The initial report stated the plane was turned back *after* being denied a place to land at an emergency zone in Ürümqi.  The other options (A, C, and D) *were* mentioned in subsequent reports, but not necessarily in the *first* report.
"
"Phakathi nohlelo lwasemsakazweni, yini eyamenyezelwa uSara Danius?","The correct answer is **A: Owawina uMkolelo weNobel Ezincwadini**.

The question asks what Sara Danius announced *during* the radio program. The passage states she announced the committee had given up trying to contact Bob Dylan for the Nobel Prize in Literature.  The context implies she was announcing that Dylan *would* win the prize.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ikomiti alizange lithole impendulo kubahlanganyeli:** The passage says she *did* get responses, just not what she was hoping for.
* **C: Abaqokiwe ngo-2016 kuMklomelo WeNobel Ezincwadini:** While Dylan was nominated in 2016, the passage focuses on the current situation regarding contact.
* **D: Ikomiti lizoyeka ukuxhumana noBob Dylan:** Danius stated the committee *had already* stopped actively trying to contact him."
Ubani ongazange atholakale lapho kuxhunyanwa naye?,"The correct answer is **D: UBob Dylan**.

The passage states that the Swedish Academy has stopped trying to reach Bob Dylan. It mentions contacting people close to him, but it explicitly says they haven't been able to reach him directly.
"
Ubani owaphawula mayelana nesithembiso “sesinyathelo esikhulu”?,"The correct answer is **C: U-Gordon Johndroe**.

The text states: ""Umkhulumeli kaBush uGordon Johndroe ubize isithembiso seNyakatho Korea """"ngesinyathelo esiyinhloko emgomweni wokususwa kwezikhali zenuzi okungafakazelwa enhlonhlweni yaseKorea."""""" (Bush's spokesperson Gordon Johndroe called North Korea's promise ""a major step in the process of eliminating nuclear weapons and a sign of respect for Korea."")

Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who pointed out that the promise was a ""major step"".
"
USłania wakhiqiza izitembu ezingaki emazweni ahlukahlukene?,"The correct answer is **D: Ezingaphezu kuka-1,000**.

The text states: ""Wenzele iSweden izitembu ezingaphezu kuka-1,000 ne-28 zamanye amazwe."" This translates to ""He made stamps for Sweden and over 1,000 for other countries.""  Therefore, over 1,000 stamps were produced for *other* countries *in addition* to the stamps for Sweden.  The question asks how many stamps he produced *in different countries*.  The phrasing ""zingaphezu kuka-1,000 ne-28 zamanye amazwe"" means ""over 1,000 and 28 from other countries"".

The options are:

* **A: Ezingaki emazweni ahlukahlukene** - This option asks about the exact number of countries, which isn't specified in the text.
* **B: 1000** -  This is incorrect because the text says *over* 1,000 for other countries.
* **C: Ezicishe zibe ngu-2,000** - This is incorrect as the text states he made over 1,000 for *other* countries.
* **D: Ezingaphezu kuka-1,000** - This is correct, as the text directly states he made over 1,000 for other countries.

"Ngokwendaba, yini engase ibe imbangela yokuvuza kwamathangi okungenisa nokukhipha umoya?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuvuleka kwethuluzi elikala ukushisa (The vent valve opened due to rising temperatures)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ukungabi khona kukagesi ngemva kokuhlolwa okuvamile kohlelo lwezicima-mlilo lubangele umgudu wokufutha ukuba uvuleke..."" This indicates that the rising temperatures inside the storage tank caused the vent valve to open to release pressure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Indawo yesibili egcwaliswa ngomthamo (The second storage location being full):** While a full tank *could* contribute to pressure, the passage directly links the vent opening to rising temperatures.
* **B: Ukuhlolwa njalo okuhleliwe kwendlela okulawulwa ngayo umlilo (Regularly scheduled fire control system testing):**  The passage says testing *after* the power outage led to the vent opening, implying the outage was the primary cause.
* **D: Umlilo kwenye yeziteshi eziphampayo eFort Greely (Fire at another pumping station in Fort Greely):** There is no mention of a fire at Fort Greely in the passage.



"
Kungani avuleka amavalvu akhululayo?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwakuvuleka kwethuluzi lokukala ukushisa ngaphakathi kwethangi**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kusukela ngoLwesithathu emini, ama-tank vent ayesavuza cishe ngenxa yokwanda kwamanzi okubangelwa ukushisa phakathi kwethangi."" (Since Wednesday morning, the tank vents have been venting almost due to an increase in water caused by the temperature inside the tank.)

This directly links the opening of the valves to the increased temperature and water accumulation *inside the tank*. The other options aren't supported by the text.
"
"Okwamanje, liphezulu kangakanani izinga lamanzi eNinth Ward?","The correct answer is **C: Afika enqulwini**.

The passage states: ""Amanzi ayachitheka ngaphezu kohide lwezindundumela engxenyeni engamafidi angu-100 ububanzi."" This indicates the water level reached **feet** (enqulwini) within that 100-foot wide area.  None of the other options accurately reflect the information provided.
"
"Phakathi neSiphepho uKatrina, yini eyenzeka eNinth Ward?","The correct answer is **A: Amanzi ezikhukhula ayifinyelela ezilinganisweni sezinyathelo ezingu-100**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Amanzi ayachitheka ngaphezu kohide lwezindundumela engxenyeni engamafidi angu-100 ububanzi."" This means the floodwaters reached a width of 100 feet, not a height of 100 feet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Amanzi ayefika kwinqulu edlula udonga** - The passage doesn't mention flooding reaching beyond the levee.
*   **C: Amanzi ezikhukhula ayeyizinyathelo ezingu-20 ukuphakama** - The passage states the levee was 20 feet high, but the floodwaters didn't reach that height.
*   **D: Amayintshi angu-6 emvula eyayina alimaza udonga** - While the 6 inches of rain contributed to the flooding, the passage focuses on the levee being breached and the resulting water damage. The rain isn't presented as the primary cause of the damage.



"
Yini kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kuqinisekiswe uHamilton?,"The correct answer is **A: Lapho isiguli esayiswa khona (Where the patient was admitted)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that Hamilton *confirmed* the hospital admitted the patient.** This directly addresses the hospital's action.
* **The passage mentions the hospital *following* infection control protocols, which *implies* the patient was isolated.** This addresses the possibility of spread.
* **The passage *states* that infection control protocols were followed.** This is a direct confirmation.
* **The passage *describes* the patient's condition as critical.**  Hamilton didn't *confirm* the condition; it was reported.

Therefore, the only thing Hamilton *didn't* confirm is *where* the patient was admitted.  The question asks what was *not* confirmed.
"
Yini lena ososayensi abazama ukuyiqonda?,"The correct answer is **D: Indlela uMhlaba owakheke ngayo**.

The passage states that scientists are trying to understand how planets, *especially Earth*, formed, referencing meteorites as potential sources of water and organic molecules that contributed to life. This directly relates to understanding the composition and formation of Earth.

"Ngokwendaba, iyiphi indima amaphoyisa endawo ayidlala ekuvaleni?","The correct answer is **C: Aqondisa abashayela izimoto ukuba baphume ngenye indlela.**

The passage states: ""usizo lwamaphoyisa angu-80 belukhona ukuqondisa abashayeli bezimoto kwezinye izindlela."" This directly supports option C. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Akhuthaza iFBI ukuba ivale:** The passage says the FBI requested the closure, not that the police encouraged it.
*   **B: Anquma ukuvala:** The passage doesn't say the police decided to close the roads.
*   **D: Abika isiminyaminya ezindaweni obekungaphunywa ngazo:** While police might have been involved in reporting suspicious activity, the primary action described for their involvement in the closure is directing traffic."
Kwenzekani endaweni esapayipi yokudlula phakathi nokuvalwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Ayevaliwe**.

The passage states: ""Amaloli athutha imfucumfucu ayesetshenziselwa ukuvimba izindawo zokungena ojantshini ohamba ngaphansi komhlaba..."" This implies the tunnel was blocked, hence ""ayevaliwe"" (was closed).  The other options are not supported by the text.

"Ngokwendaba, yini engazange yenzeke ngaphambi kokuba umthwebuli wezithombe eshayiswe imoto?","The correct answer is **B: Umthwebuli wezithombe wapaka imoto yakhe eduze naseSepulveda Boulevard.**

The text states: ""iwebhusayithi yezindaba zokuzijabulisa i-TMZ iqonda ukuthi umthathi wezithombe wamisa imoto yakhe kolunye uhlangothi lweSepulveda Boulevard..."" This happened *before* he was hit by the car.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umthwebuli wezithombe wayalwa iPhoyisa Lasemgwaqweni Omkhulu ukuba abuyele emuva ngale komgwaqo:** While he did interact with the police, the text doesn't say he *argued* with them to back up. It says he tried to proceed after being stopped.
* **C: Umthwebuli wezithombe wathatha izithombe zalapho amaphoyisa ayevimbe khona:** He attempted to take photos of the police *before* the incident, but the text doesn't say he *actually* took them.
* **D: Umthwebuli wayekwazi ukuthatha isithombe sikaBieber:** The text mentions Bieber's presence, but it doesn't confirm that the photographer successfully took a picture of him.
"
Yini umthwebuli wezithombe ayezama ukuyenza ngaphambi kokuba ashayiswe yimoto?,"The correct answer is **B: Washutha izithombe zalapho amaphoyisa ayevimbe khona.**

The text states: ""umthwebuli wezithombe wamisa imoto yakhe kolunye uhlangothi lweSepulveda Boulevard futhi wazama ukuthatha izithombe zamaphoyisa ayevimbezele ngaphambi kokuwela umgwaqo...""
"
Isiphi isitatimende esingachazi ngokunembile isimo sikamongameli ngemva kokuthola ukuthi unegciwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Akazizwa kahle**

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Ngaphandle kwemfiva nomminzo obuhlungu obuhlungu, ngizizwa ngikahle..."" (Except for a slight fever and aching muscles, I feel well...). This directly contradicts the statement ""Akazizwa kahle"" (Doesn't feel well).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umphimbo wakhe ubuhlungu** - The passage explicitly mentions ""emfiva nomminzo obuhlungu"" (a slight fever and aching muscles).
* **C: Isimo sakhe sizinzile** - The passage states ""Isimo sikamongameli sizinzile"" (The President's condition is stable).
* **D: Unomkhuhlane** - The passage mentions ""emfiva nomminzo"" (fever and aching muscles), but not a cough specifically.



Therefore, the statement that *doesn't* accurately reflect the President's condition is that he doesn't feel well. He states he feels well *except* for the fever and aches.



"
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isitatimende kulezi ezilandelayo esiyiqiniso ngomongameli?","The correct answer is **B: Uzohlala ekhaya amasonto ambalwa.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""kusho uNgqongqoshe kaMongameli uRodrigo Arias. Isimo sikamongameli sizinzile, nakuba ezohlukaniswa abe yedwa ekhaya izinsukwana.""  This directly translates to ""the President's condition is stable, although he will be isolated at home for a few weeks.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Akanawo umkhuhlane** (He has no fever): The text says he has a fever and body aches.
* **C: Uphile ngokwanele ukuthi engaxhumana nabanye ngocingo** (He is well enough to communicate with others by phone): The text states he *is* communicating by phone.
* **D: Unegciwane elibi** (He has a bad germ): The text says he has a ""lingelibi kakhulu"" (not very severe) germ.  It's not ""bad.""

"Ngokwendaba, kwakulindeleke ukuba Isiphepho uGonu siqhubeke sidamba nini?","The correct answer is **A: Ngaphambi kokuba sifike eMaldives**

The passage states: ""Ngasekuseni namuhla, imimoya cishe beyiku-83 km/h, futhi bekulindeleke ukuthi iqhubeke iphelelwa amandla.""  This indicates the wind was already weakening *before* reaching the Maldives. The context implies it will continue to weaken *before* it arrives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lapho umoya wehla uya kuyisivinini samakhilomitha angu-83 ngehora:** The passage states the wind *is* at 83 km/h, and it was expected to *continue* weakening, not that it would weaken *to* that speed.
* **C: Ngaphambi kokuba sifinyelele uvuthondaba:** The passage doesn't mention a volcano, so this is irrelevant.
* **D: Ngaphambi kokuba imimoya ifinyelele isivinini samamayela angu149 ngehora:** The passage states the wind *is* at 83 km/h and can reach 149 km/h, but it was expected to *weaken* from that high speed.  The expectation is that it will weaken *before* reaching that speed, not *after*.



"
Wawushesha kangakanani umoya ovithondabeni lweSiphepho uGonu?,"The correct answer is **A: Angamakhilomitha angu-149 ngehora**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Lapho sinamandla khona, Isiphepho i-Gonu, esibizwe ngegama lesikhwama samahlamvu esundu ngolimi lwesi-Maldives, saba nemimoya engamakhilomitha angu-240 ngehora (amamayela ayi-149 ngehora).""
* This directly translates to the wind speed being 240 kilometers per hour.
* The question asks for the speed in kilometers per hour.
* Option A, ""Angamakhilomitha angu-149 ngehora,"" is the kilometers per hour equivalent of the miles per hour mentioned in the text (149 mph).

Therefore, the best answer, although not perfectly phrased in the options, is the one that accurately reflects the speed mentioned in the text.  The question is a bit confusing because it gives both km/h and mph, but it's asking for the km/h speed.

However, upon review, the question asks: ""Wawushesha kangakanani umoya ovithondabeni lweSiphepho uGonu?"" which translates to ""How fast was the wind in Storm Gonu?"". The text *directly* states Gonu had a wind speed of 240 km/h.  Therefore, none of the answer choices are correct.

The provided answer choices have some discrepancies. I'm assuming one of the answers is meant to be the wind speed in km/h. So, the answer should be:

**None of the above.**

But since I have to choose one, I'll choose the option closest to the correct information.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungaveli njengesici seKarenia?,"The correct answer is **C: Inamaseli amaningi (Many cells)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes *Karenia brevis* as a single-celled organism.
* Option C states ""Many cells,"" which directly contradicts the fact that *Karenia brevis* is a single cell.
* Options A, B, and D are all mentioned in the passage as characteristics or effects of *Karenia brevis*.



"
Yini kulokhu okulandelayo isici seKarena engakwazi ukukwenza?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukwanda ngokuphindaphinda ngesibalo ngaphansi kwanoma isiphi isimo**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ulwele lwenza ubuthi obungaxhwalisa izinzwa kokubili ebantwini nasezinhlanzini. Esikhathini esiningi izinhlanzi zibulawa ubuthi obuningi obusemanzini. Abantu bangathinteka ngokuphefumula amanzi athintekile ayiswa emoyeni umoya namagagasi.""  This indicates that *Karenia brevis* blooms and produces toxins.
* **Option B directly aligns with the text:** The text explains that *Karenia brevis* blooms and increases in number, leading to the toxic blooms.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ukukhubaza inzwa yofishi:** The text says the bloom *disrupts* the senses of fish, it doesn't say the *Karenia brevis* itself disrupts them. The toxins produced by the bloom are the culprit.
    * **C: Ukuthinta amanzi:**  *Karenia brevis* *does* affect the water by creating the bloom and toxins. However, the question asks what it *cannot* do.
    * **D: Ukukhiqiza ushevu othinta izinzwa:** The text says *Karenia brevis* produces *toxins*, not ""ushevu"" (which translates to ""sheen"" or ""gloss""). While toxins affect senses, the text specifically highlights toxins.



Therefore, the only ability the text explicitly states *Karenia brevis* *does* have is to bloom and increase in number.

"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kwenzeke ngenxa yeSiphepho uFelicia?","The correct answer is **D: Izikhukhula ezisemgwaqweni**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""nakuba njengamanje, ayikho imibiko yomonakalo noma izikhukhula ebekhona."" This means there were *no* road closures reported due to Hurricane Felicia.
* The text *does* mention:
    * ""Imvula, eyafinyelela amayintshi angu-6.34 esilinganisweni kuyi -Oahu, yachazwa ngokuthi """"inenzuzo""""."" - This supports option A.
    * ""Enye yemvula beyihambisana nokuduma kwezulu kanye nemibani eminingi."" - This supports option B.
    * The text doesn't say the rain continued continuously, so option C is not necessarily wrong, but option D is definitively stated as *not* happening.



"
Isiphi isitatimende esingelona iqiniso mayelana neSiphepho uFelicia?,"The correct answer is **A: Imvula eyazuzisa i-Oahu**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the rain in Oahu was described as ""beneficial."" This means it *helped* Oahu, not caused it to be satisfied.
* Let's look at the other options:
    * **B: Kwaqale kwacatshangwa kuyinto eshisayo ngaphambi kokujika kube seSigabeni 4 sesiphepho:** The text says ""yaphelelwa amandla ngenxa yokucindezela okushisayo ngaphambi kokunyamalala ngoLwesibili,"" which means a heating pressure preceded its intensification to Category 4. This is true.
    * **C: Iziqhingi eziningi zaba nemvula:** The text says ""Izinsalela zayo zakhiqiza imifafazo eziqhingini eziningi,"" meaning the remnants produced showers in many states. This is true.
    * **D: Ezinye izimvula zazihambisana nokubanika:** The text says ""Enye yemvula beyihambisana nokuduma kwezulu kanye nemibani eminingi."" This means some rain was accompanied by thunderstorms. This is true.

Therefore, only option A is not supported by the text."
Isiphi isitatimende esiwubonisa ngokunembile umphumela wango-2009 waseHungary weGrand Prix?,"The correct answer is **C: UPiquet Jr. waxoshwa ngemva kwalokho**.

The text explicitly states: ""UPiquet Jr. waxoshwa ngemva kwe-Grand Prix yase-Hungary ka-2009.""  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: UFernando Alonso waba sengozini yemoto:** While Alonso *did* have an incident, the text doesn't say he was in danger *because* of Piquet Jr.
* **B: UPiquet Jr. wadla umhlanganiso:** The text doesn't mention Piquet Jr. crashing.
* **D: Imoto ephephile yaba sengozini:** The text mentions the safety car, but not that it was in danger.



"
Yenzeka nini leyo ngozi?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngokusheshe nje ngemva kokuba u-Alonso ethathe ikhefu kancane endaweni lapho izimoto zima khona.**

The passage states: ""U-Piquet Jr. washayisa kwi- Singapore Grand Prix yango-2008 ngemuva nje kokumela kancane ngokushesha u-Fernando Alonso, ekhipha imoto yokuphepha."" This directly indicates the crash happened shortly after Alonso took a slight ""break"" (or slowed down) in the pit lane.

"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okwathatha isikhathi esincane kunaleso abacwaningi ababesikholelwa kwasekuqaleni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuziphendukela kwezinto eziphilayo (Evolution of living things)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the new species evolved in just two generations, which is significantly faster than what scientists previously believed. The question asks what took less time than initially thought.  The key information is that the evolution (or adaptation) of the species occurred in only two generations.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kubikwe abacwaningi?,"The correct answer is **C: Igama lento ephilayo entsha** (The name of the new living thing).

Here's why:

* **The passage *does* state the names of the new species:** *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza conirostris*.
* **The passage *does* describe the time frame of evolution:**  ""izizukulwane ezimbili kuphela"" (only two generations).
* **The passage *does* mention the species involved in the evolution:** ""izintaka zika-Darwin ezitholakala kuleyo ndawo kuphela"" (Darwin's finches found only in that location).
* **The passage *does* mention that the new species are based on structural changes:** ""Zakheka kuphi izinto eziphilayo"" means ""Where did living things develop?"" and is relevant to the passage's discussion of evolutionary changes.

Therefore, the only piece of information *not* explicitly mentioned in the passage is the specific names of the new species.

Izoba kuphi iCowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Edolobheni laseBucharest**.

The text states: ""Idolobha lizoba elokuqala eYurophu ngaseMpumalanga-mpumalanga lokubungaza iCowParade..."" which directly indicates the event will be in Bucharest.
"
Yiziphi izitatimende ezilandelayo eziyichaza ngokunembile iCowParade?,"The correct answer is **D: Umciphi womphakathi wezobuciko omkhulu kakhulu emhlabeni** (A public art event, the largest in the world).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Idolobha lizoba elokuqala eYurophu ngaseNqongweni Mpumalanga lokubungaza iCowParade, isehlakalo esikhulu kunazo zonke emhlabeni zezobuciko..."" (The city will be the first in Europe Southeast to host CowParade, the largest public art event in the world...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ibanjelwa kuphela emadolobheni abhekwa njengamadolobha “obuciko”** (It is only held in cities considered ""art"" cities): The text doesn't mention any such restriction.
* **B: Yasungulwa yiBucharest City Hall** (It was founded by Bucharest City Hall): The text only mentions that the Bucharest City Hall is part of the campaign to restart the thinking about Bucharest as a major founding and healthy city. It doesn't say they founded CowParade.
* **C: Umcimbi wobuciko obanjwa ehlobo kuyo yonke iningizimu-mpumalanga yeYurophu** (An art event held throughout all of Southeast Europe): The text specifies that Bucharest will be the first *in Europe Southeast* to host it, implying it might not be held throughout the entire region.

Yini eyabangela ukuba iRussia ivale ukusetshenziswa kwe-II-76s?,"The correct answer is **B: Ingozi**.

The text states: ""Isikhalazo sesifakiwe ukuze sicwaningwe. I-Il-76 ibe isici esikhulu kokubili sebutho laseRashiya kanye naseSoviet Union kusukela ngawo-1970, futhi isibone ingozi enkulu eRashiya ngenyanga edlule. Ngo-October 7 injini yaphuma lapho indiza isuka, kwangabi nolimalayo. IRashiya imise ama-ll-76 okwesikhashana ngemva kwaleyo ngozi.""

This clearly indicates that a *danger* (ingoxi) caused the temporary grounding of the Il-76 aircraft.
"
Iyini i-II-76?,"The correct answer is **B: Umbayimbayi** (An aircraft).

The text states: ""I-Il-76 ibe isici esikhulu kokubili sebutho laseRashiya kanye naseSoviet Union kusukela ngawo-1970..."" This clearly indicates that the Il-76 is a type of aircraft.

Ubani owaqasha iqembu lababhali ohlelweni oluthi The Simpsons?,"The correct answer is **B: USimon**.

The text states: ""Nge-1989 wasiza ukwakha i-The Simpsons no-Brooks kanye no-Groening, futhi wayenomthwalo wemfanelo wokuqasha iqembu lohlelo lokubhala lokuqala."" (In 1989 he helped create The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, and he had the responsibility of hiring the writing staff for the show.)"
"NgokweFluke, ubani owathumela ukuphawula kwakhe okuhle kanye nesikhuthazo?","The correct answer is **D: Kokubili abesilisa nabesifazane**.

The passage states: ""Ufike kulesi siphetho ngenxa yokuphawula okuhle okuningi nesikhuthazo athunyelwe sona kokubili abantu ngabanye besifazane **nabaesilisa** becela ukuthi imithi yokuvimbela inzalo ibhekwe njengesidingo sezokwelapha.""
"
"Ngokwendaba, yini abanye abantu ababengafuni abesifazane bakhulume ngayo?","The correct answer is **A: Abantu besilisa ngabanye**. 

The text explicitly states that Fluke concluded this based on ""much positive feedback and encouragement from both women and men seeking to have hormonal contraception considered a medical need."" This implies that some men were trying to prevent women from talking about female health issues, and Fluke believes those efforts have failed.

"Ngokwendaba, yimuphi umzimba wamapulanethi onamandla kakhulu?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngokwazi kwethu, iyodwa kuphela iplanethi ekwazi ukuveza amandla njenge-Titan..."" which translates to ""According to us, there is only one planet that can display power like Titan...""

Therefore, the answer is Titan.
"
Imifula kanye namadamu anoketshezi olukwazi ukubonakala ngale aye aziwa kumaphi amapulanethi?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The text explicitly states: ""Uma umile ogwini, ungakwazi ukubona noma yimaphi amatshe nokugcola okwakuphansi. Ngokwazi kwethu, iyodwa kuphela iplanethi ekwazi ukuveza amandla njenge-Titan...""  This directly links the described phenomenon to Titan.

Yiziphi kulezi zinto ezicwaningiwe ezingewona umphumela wocwaningo olwengeziwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuqonda mayelana nokuziphendukela kwezimpaphe**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ososayensi bathi iplamu lalesi silwane lalinesifuba esinsundu ngaphezulu siphaphathekile nokumibalabala emaceleni. Ucwaningo lunikeza nokuqonda ngokuvela kwezimpaphe ezinyonini.""  This directly confirms that dinosaurs *did* have feathers (D).
* **The text says:** ""Ucwaningo lunikeza nokuqonda ngokuvela kwezimpaphe ezinyonini."" This confirms feathers were studied, but it doesn't state how they were used for flight. While the text *suggests* they could be used for flight, it's not a definitive conclusion drawn *from* the research itself.
* **The text explicitly details:**  ""nakuba lona kungumsila we-dinosaur encane, isampula liveza izimpaphe zendala futhi hhayi isihluphe somntwanyana."" and ""Ukundiza kodwa kunalokho ukulawula ukushisa kanye nokuzibonakalisa."" The research provides evidence that the feathers are ancient and not just simple fuzz, and suggests uses beyond flight.
* **The text describes the research's findings about the structure of feathers:** ""Q: Yiziphi kulezi zinto ezicwaningiwe ezingewona umphumela wocwaningo olwengeziwe? A: Umbala wezimpaphe zesilwane B: Ukuqonda ukuthi izimpaphe zazingasetshenziswa uma kudizwa C: Ukuqonda mayelana nokuziphendukela kwezimpaphe D: Ukuqinisekisa ukuthi ama-dinosaur ayenezimpaphe.""  This states that the feathers had a structure (a ""backbone"" or ""shaft"" as alluded to in the options) that was researched. The text notes, ""Q: Yiziphi kulezi zinto ezicwaningiwe ezingewona umphumela wocwaningo olwengeziwe? A: Umphumela wocwaningo olwengeziwe"" Which suggests that the research found out the structure of"
Yini izimpaphe zama-dinosaur ayengenazo?,"The correct answer is **A: AmaBarbule**.

The passage states: ""...zinezinye izici zezimpaphe — izindlendla kanye nama-barbule — abacwaningi baphethe ngokuthi i-rachis cishe bekungukwakheka kokuziphendukela kunalezinye izici."" This means the researchers identified barbules as a feature *in addition to* the rachis. Therefore, the feathers lacked barbules.



"
Yiziphi izitatimende ezilandelayo ezingelona iqiniso mayelana neZMapp?,"The correct answer is **B: Ikwazi ukwelapha ukugula okukhona kodwa akukuvimbeli ukufa.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...ayikho imithi eboniswe ngokucacile ukuthi ifanelekela ukulapha isifo esikhona.""  This means ZMapp *doesn't* cure Ebola.
* **The text also states:** ""...ngokocwaningo kubonisa ukuthi inomthelela omncane kunalowo obucatshwangwa ekuvimbeleni ukufa."" This directly contradicts statement B.  ZMapp *does* have a small effect on preventing death.
* **C is correct:** The text says ZMapp was used as a comparator in the PALM trial.
* **D is correct:** The text explicitly states the clinical benefits were smaller than initially anticipated.



Therefore, statement B is the only one that is untrue based on the provided text.



"
Yiziphi izitatimende kulezi ezilandelayo ezikuchaza ngokuchaza ngokunembile ukusebenza kwePALM?,"The best answer is **B: Isidakamizwa esiqondiswayo saqhathaniswa nezinto zokwelapha ezintathu, enye yazo kwakuyiZMapp.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ekuhloleni kwe-PALM, i-ZMapp yasebenza njengesifaniso, okusho ukuthi ososayensi bayisebenzisa njengesiqalo sokuqhathanisa futhi baqhathanisa amanye amakhambi amathathu okwelapha nayo."" This directly confirms that the study compared a standard treatment (the placebo) with three different medications, one of which was ZMapp.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ucwaningo lubonisa ukuthi kungase kube nezinzuzo eziningi kunalokho obekucatshangwa ngaphambili:** While the passage mentions the initial promise of ZMapp, it doesn't say the *PALM* study showed significant unexpected benefits. It set the stage for comparison, not necessarily revealing surprising new advantages.
* **C: IZMapp yasetshenziswa ngesizathu sokuhlola:** This is true, but it's not the *defining* aspect of the PALM study. The study was about comparing ZMapp to *other* treatments.
* **D: Kwabonakala sengathi iyasebenza ekwelapheni izifo ezikhona:** The passage clarifies that ZMapp's effectiveness was not definitively established. It was being used as a starting point for *comparison*, not as a proven treatment within the PALM study.



Therefore, option B is the most precise and accurate description of what the PALM study involved, according to the given text."
Abacwaningi bacabanga ukuthi lolu cwephe olusha lungasebenza kakhulu kuphi?,"The correct answer is **A: Emazweni lapho abantu bakhona behola imali encane.**

The passage specifically states that the tool is intended to help with diseases in ""ziguliniezisemazweni ampofu"" (poorer countries) where access to resources is limited. The mention of the price being a cent indicates it's designed for affordability in resource-constrained settings.
"
Iyiphi indlela ezosetshenziswa ekwakheni ithuluzi lokwelapha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ucwecwe olungakwazi ukuprinteka**

Here's why:

The passage states the device is a ""tiny, disposable printer"" that can be printed using standard machines for a penny.  Option C directly reflects this description. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isitatimende esimayelana nezinto ezikwamanye amapulanethi okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Akutholakalanga okuningi kwakho ebusweni benyanga (We haven't found much of it on the face of the moon)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes lobate scars as evidence of relatively recent geological activity on the moon. This *directly* contradicts the statement that there isn't much evidence of activity on the moon's surface. The presence of these scars *is* evidence of activity.

Let's break down why the other options are more likely to be true:

* **A: Izinto ezenza lezi zinto kungenzeka ukuthi zisanda kwenzeka (These things could have happened relatively recently):** The passage explicitly states the lobate scars are evidence of ""recent geological events.""
* **B: Ukuba khona kwazo kusho ukuthi inyanga ayiyisweli imisebenzi yamatshe (Their presence suggests the moon is not geologically inactive):**  This is the *opposite* of what the passage implies. The existence of lobate scars *proves* the moon is geologically active.
* **C: Kungase kube imiphumela yokuncipha kwenyanga (It may be a result of lunar contraction):** The passage suggests lunar contraction as a possible explanation for the scars.  This is a plausible theory.



Therefore, option D is the statement that is *least* supported by the passage and is thus the correct answer.



"
"Ngokwendaba, ikuphi ukusikisela mayelana nokwakheka komhlaba okubonisa ukuthi kunemisebenzi yamatshe eyenzeka enyangeni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukwakheka komhlaba kwenzeka cishe muva nje**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ""lobate scarps"" are evidence of recent geological activity.  These scarps are described as ""appearing as if they have emerged from a gradual shrinking of the moon."" This implies the moon is still actively changing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kancane kancane inyanga iyancipha:** While the moon *is* shrinking, the passage is focusing on the *activity* of the moon, not just its shrinking.
* **B: Ukwakheka komhlaba kwenzeka kudala kakhulu:** The passage directly contradicts this by highlighting recent events.
* **C: Kumane kunesilinganiso esincane sokwakheka ebusweni benyanga:**  The passage describes noticeable features (lobate scarps) suggesting more than just minor activity.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini engeke ibe khona kakhulu kuze kube ukuthi sekubekwe icala?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuphawula okwengeziwe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Crown Office has told the press they will not comment *until after the trial*. This directly means they will not offer any additional commentary or remarks before the trial begins.
* The passage mentions the professor's statement about the media broadly referring to suspects. This relates to the *publication of photos*, not additional comments from the Crown Office.
* The passage discusses the potential damage to witness identification evidence due to the photos being published, which isn't related to additional commentary.
* The passage refers to the broad reporting of suspects and their photos, not specifically ""images of books"" or ""headlines of books"".



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini engayona inkinga yamuva mayelana nezinto zokuvikela?","The correct answer is **A: Izimo zezulu ezimbi kakhulu (The very bad weather)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the ""very bad weather"" is disrupting rescue efforts. Pittman says the conditions won't improve until next week.  He also emphasizes that the ice conditions are the worst in 15 years. 

While the other options are related to snow (amount, iciness, and falling snow), the passage focuses specifically on the *overall weather conditions* as the primary problem. The other options are mentioned as factors contributing to the difficulty, but the overarching issue is the severity of the weather.
"
"Ngaphezu kweqhwa, yini enye engaba umthelela emsebenzini wokusindisa?","The correct answer is **B: Izimo zezulu**.

The text explicitly states that ""isimo sezulu esibi kakhulu sasiphazamisa imizamo yokuhlenga"" (the very bad weather was disrupting rescue efforts).  The phrase ""isimo sezulu"" directly translates to ""weather conditions"" or ""sky conditions.""

While options A and C *could* be factors in a disaster, the provided text *only* mentions the weather as a specific problem. Option D is irrelevant.
"
Iyiphi inkolelo uRoberts akuxwaya ukuyiqinisekisa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukubaluleka kokukhishwa kwesinqumo esifanayo yiNkantolo Ephakeme.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that Roberts ""emphasized the importance of the Supreme Court issuing similar decisions going forward,"" referring to the Roe v. Wade case. This directly aligns with option B.
* The passage mentions his views on when life begins (option C), but this is presented as a related but separate point, not something he's specifically warning against *confirming*.
* Option A is incorrect because the passage discusses *not* making unacceptable comments about certain aspects of situations, not regarding good behavior in discussions.
* Option D is also incorrect because the passage mentions his belief in the protected right to privacy *as it related to the Roe v. Wade decision*, but doesn't frame it as something he's warning against affirming.



"
Isiphi isihloko uRobert ayenomuzwa wokuthi akufaneleki ukuba kuxoxwe ngaso?,"The correct answer is **C: Ilungelo lokusho izinto eziyimfihlo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that URoberts believes it's ""unacceptable to comment on specific features of events that occur."" This directly refers to the right to privacy, specifically in the context of the Roe v. Wade decision, which centered on a woman's right to an abortion - a deeply personal and private matter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukukhishwa kwesinqumo esifanayo eNkantolo Ephakeme:** The passage actually mentions that the Supreme Court should make similar decisions consistently.
* **B: Isinqumo esiphakathi kukaRoe noWade:** The passage explicitly references the Roe v. Wade decision.
* **D: Amacala athile:** While he doesn't want to comment on *specific* events, the passage isn't referring to a broad category of cases. It's about the principle of not commenting on sensitive, private matters.



"
Zikhanya kuphi izinsika zokukhanya ezicwebezelayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Lapho kuhlolwe ukuba kube khona indiza yokuqala.**

The text states: ""Imisebe yokukhanya emibili yanyuka ukuze ibheke emkhathini phakathi nobusuku."" (Two searchlights rose to look in the sky at night.)  This directly indicates the lights were used in the sky, specifically where the first plane was being searched for.
"
"Ngokwendaba, amabhilidi amakhulu zokwakhiwa nini endaweni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukwakhiwa kuyaqhubeka**.

The text states: ""Umsebenzi wokwakha amabhilidi amahlanu amade uyaqhubeka endaweni yesakhiwo..."" which translates to ""The work of building five long buildings continues in the construction area...""  This indicates the construction is ongoing, not that it started at a specific time like 8:46 AM.

While the text mentions the peace at 8:46 AM allowing the first flight to operate, it doesn't specify *when* the building started. The key is that the construction *is currently happening*.
"
Ikuphi ukwaziswa okusikisela ukuthi iSeven Sisters iyimigede?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlukahluka kwamazinga okushisa**.

The text explicitly states: ""Izithombe eziveza ukushisa zibonisa ukuthi ukuhlukahlukana kokushisa kwasebusuku nasemini kubonisa ukuthi zifana nomgede."" This directly points to the temperature variation as evidence supporting the conclusion that the Seven Sisters are impact craters.
"
Kunjani ukushisa kuyiSeven Sisters okuphawuliwe?,"The correct answer is **B: Kunemigodi ejulile phansi.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...its temperature behavior is similar to deep caves on Earth, **being cooler than the surrounding areas in the morning and warmer at night.**"" It also says, ""...it behaves like deep holes in the ground.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Izithombe ze-infrared (Infrared images):** While infrared images were used to *detect* the temperature differences, the key characteristic is the temperature behavior itself, not the type of image used.
* **C: Ukuvuleka komgede (Cave openings):** The text mentions ""izindawo zokungena emhumeni"" (cave openings), but the core characteristic isn't the openings themselves, but the temperature behavior *inside* those openings.
* **D: Ukuhlolwa kwemigede khona lapha eMhlabeni (Testing of caves here on Earth):** The Seven Sisters are compared to deep caves on Earth, but the text doesn't say they were *tested* like caves on Earth. It's a comparison of behavior.



"
"Ngokwencwadi, isiphi isitatimende mayelana nomsolwa esingelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **C: Ubuzwe bakhe buyaziwa abezomthetho (His name was known to the authorities)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Igama lakhe alikaziwa iziphathimandla..."" which translates to ""His name was unknown to the authorities...""  Option C directly contradicts this statement.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Wasebenzisa imoto phakathi nokuhlaselwa (He used a car during the attack):** The text says the attacker used a car with three wheels.
* **B: Kusolakala sengathi waqhumisa iziqhumane (It appears he detonated an explosive):** The text states, ""Indoda esolwa ngokuqhumisa ibhomu yabanjwa, ngemva kokulinyazwa ukuqhuma"" which translates to ""The man is accused of detonating a bomb after a blast.""
* **D: Wayengalimele (He was not acting on behalf of anyone):** The text doesn't explicitly say this, but the fact that his name was unknown to authorities suggests he was operating independently, without a known affiliation.

Therefore, only option C is definitively false based on the provided text.
"
Iyiphi imininingwane mayelana nokuhlasela esiqinisekiswe abezomthetho?,"The correct answer is **C: Isisusa sokuhlasela**.

Here's why:

The prompt states the man was arrested *after* a bomb exploded. The question asks about confirmed details about the attack. The most concrete detail mentioned is the presence of the explosive device (""ibhomu yabanjwa"").  While the other options *might* be investigated, they aren't confirmed facts. We don't know who was with him, his statement is unconfirmed, and the attacker's name is unknown.

Therefore, the **type of explosive used** (the bomb itself) is the confirmed detail about the attack.
"
Iliphi iqembu elizodlala e-Ellis Park?,"The correct answer is **C: ISouth Africa ne-Australia**.

The text states: ""Umdlalo wokugcina womqhudelwano uzokwenzeka e-Ellis Park eGoli ngeviki elizayo, lapho ama-Springbok edlala ne-Australia."" (The final match of the tournament will take place at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, where the Springboks will play Australia.)
"
AmaSpringbok azowudlalela kuphi umdlalo wawo olandelayo?,"The correct answer is **C: EJohannesburg**.

The text states: ""Umdlalo wokugcina womqhudelwano uzokwenzeka e-Ellis Park eGoli ngeviki elizayo, lapho ama-Springbok edlala ne-Australia.""  Ellis Park is located in Johannesburg.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo labo abasebenza emkhathini ababa nenkinga yabo phakathi nohambo lwabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukugcina ibanga elifanele emshinini wokuqondisa umshini okuhanjwa ngawo**.

Here's why:

The text describes a loss of spatial orientation (isiteshi sagcina isimo saso sengqondo) experienced by the cosmonauts. This loss is linked to a gyroscope malfunction initially and persisting throughout the mission.  ""Ukugcina ibanga elifanele emshinini wokuqondisa umshini okuhanjwa ngawo"" translates to ""Maintaining the correct orientation in the spacecraft's control system.""  This directly relates to the loss of spatial awareness described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ukugcina ithuluzi lokubonisa lapho umshini oya khona:** While important for navigation, it's not the primary issue highlighted in the text. The core problem is understanding *where* they are in space, not just tracking their position.
*   **C: Ukusebenza kwebhanoyi:**  ""Ukusebenza kwebhanoyi"" means the operation of the bathroom. This is completely unrelated to the spatial orientation problem.
*   **D: Ukuphinde ube sendaweni efanele:** ""Ukuphinde ube sendaweni efanele"" translates to ""returning to the correct location"". This is a consequence of losing orientation, not the root of the problem. The astronauts couldn't *get* back to the correct location because they lost their spatial awareness.



"
"Ngokwendaba, wawuyini umgomo walokho okwakuyokwenziwa emkhathini?","The correct answer is **B: Ukusondela nakakhulu ekulungiseni umshini wokuqondisa okuhanjwa ngawo.**

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where the station's mental state (presumably referring to its control and navigation systems) deteriorated. The mission involved a situation where the station was experiencing issues with its gyroscope and mental state, leading to the need for intervention.  The subsequent actions of the Russian controllers (launching combat aircraft) suggest a need to physically address the problem. Therefore, the primary goal would be to get closer to the malfunctioning navigation system to try and fix it.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ukuthola ukuthi sikuphi nendawo (Finding where we are):** While knowing location is important, the focus of the passage is on the station's *mental state* and the need for *fixing* a problem.
* **C: Ukuphothula umsebenzi wasemkhathini (Documenting the mission):**  Documentation is important, but it's not the primary driver of the intervention described.
* **D: Ukusebenzisa ibhanoyi (Using a gyroscopic stabilizer):** The problem is with the *gyroscope* itself, not with using a stabilizer.  The goal is to fix the existing gyroscope problem.



"
Yiziphi kulezi zitatimende mayelana necala ezingelona iqiniso?,"The statement that is **not true** based on the provided text is:

**A: Kwashushiswa embusweni lapho kukho khona indlukulu ye-AOL** (An indictment was issued when AOL had a lawsuit).

The text states that AOL *opened* the lawsuit. It doesn't mention an indictment being issued *against* AOL.  The other options are directly supported by the text:

* **B: Isinqumo ngecala sakhishwa** (A verdict in the case was issued) - The text says the case was ""lahlwa"" (dismissed), which implies a verdict or decision was made.
* **C: Umthetho mayelana nohlobo lwe-email engathembekile wasetshenziswa kuleli cala** (The law regarding unsolicited email was used in this case) - The text explicitly states that the case was brought using the 2003 law against spam.
* **D: I-AOL yatholakala inecala** (AOL was found guilty in the case) - The text states AOL *opened* the lawsuit, indicating they were the plaintiff and not found guilty.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.



"
Yiziphi izitatimende ezilandelayo ezilichaza ngokunembile icala?,"The best answer is **A: I-AOL yabekwa icala ngokusabalalisa izinto ezingagunyaziwe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Icala lihlanganisa ukuthi i-AOL yabekwa icala ngoba iyindawo eyinhloko yomhlinzeki we-inthanethi i-AOL, okuyinkampani eyavula icala..."" and ""...okuyinkampani eyavula icala ngokusabalalisa ama-imeyili aya ebantwini abaningi abazange bamiswe."" This directly indicates the core of the lawsuit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Icala lihlanganisa abalawuli abakhulu bezinkonzo ze-inthanethi:** While AOL is a major internet service provider, the passage doesn't explicitly state the lawsuit involves *other* major ISPs. It focuses on AOL's actions.
* **C: Icala laqulwa ngo-2003:**  The passage mentions the law used to file the lawsuit was passed in 2003, but it doesn't say the lawsuit itself was *filed* in 2003. It only indicates the context of the legal action.
* **D: I-AOL yaqa ukushushisa kuleli cala:** The passage doesn't mention AOL having settled the case.



Therefore, option A most accurately summarizes the lawsuit as described in the provided text.
"
"Ngokwendaba, iliphi iqembu uVidal aqala ukulidlalela ezinkathini zonyaka ezintathu ezedlule?","The correct answer is **C: IBarça**.

The text states: ""UVidal oneminyaka engu-28 wayejoyine i-Barça kumasizini amathathu adlule..."" which translates to ""UVidal is 28 years old and joined Barça three seasons ago...""
"
UVidal wadlala imidlalo emingaki kwiBarça?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The question states: ""kusukela ngenkathi ethuthele enhlokodolobha yase-Catalan, uVidal udlalele iqembu imidlalo engu-49."" (since he joined the Catalan city, Vidal has played 49 games for the team.)
"
Babedlala naliphi iqembu kulowo mdlalo?,"The correct answer is **B: IBolonia**.

The text states: ""Wayehlala ehhotela leqembu ngaphambi komdlalo ohlelelwe ngeSonto neBolonia."" This directly indicates that the team played against Bologna.
"
Kungani uJarque aqhubeka nokuhlala ehhotela?,"The best answer is **B: Wayenomhlangano ongaphambi kwenkathi yonyaka.**

Here's why:

* **The text states he was training in Coverciano before the season started.** This suggests he was part of pre-season preparations.
* **The phrases ""ngaphambi komdlalo ohlelelwe ngeSonto neBolonia"" (before the scheduled matches against Bologna) indicate he was part of the team's preparations for those games.**  Pre-season often involves training camps and staying with the team.
* **Option A (Kwakuudingeka azivocavoce - He needed to be discreet) is not supported by the text.**  The text doesn't mention anything about secrecy.
* **Option C (Wayenomdlalo ngoMgqibelo - He had a match on Saturday) is incorrect.** The text mentions matches against Bologna, but doesn't say he played on Saturday.
* **Option D (Wayeziqeqesha neBolonia - He was training with Bologna) is incorrect.** The text indicates he was training *before* the matches against Bologna, implying he was training with his own team.



Therefore, option B is the most logical inference based on the provided information. He was likely staying with the team as part of their pre-season preparations.



"
Kungani iJakarta i-ejensi yezinto eziphathelene nomhlaba ingazange ikhiphe isixwayiso?,"The correct answer is **D: Akuzange kulifinyelele izinga elidingekayo ukuze kube ukuzamazama komhlaba.**

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states: ""ngokusebenzisa kwesikhungo sezemvelo i-Jakarta, asikho isixwayiso sesiphepho esizokhishwa ngoba lokhu kuzamazama komhlaba akufinyelelanga ubukhulu buka-6.5."" 
* This means the earthquake's magnitude didn't reach the threshold required to trigger a tsunami warning.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kwakungekho ukusongela kwetsunami:** While the absence of a tsunami warning is a factor, the *reason* for the lack of a warning was the earthquake's magnitude, not the absence of a tsunami.
* **B: Ukugwema ukuthuka kubantu bendawo:** The text doesn't suggest that the agency was trying to avoid public panic. They were following established protocols based on earthquake magnitude.
* **C: Ukugwema ukuphazamisa amabhizinisi endawo:**  This is also not supported by the text. The agency's decisions are based on scientific data, not economic concerns.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyabangelwa ukuzamazama?","The correct answer is **D: Isilinganiso sokuzamazama esingu-6.5**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ngokuthi kuzamazama komhlaba akufinyelelanga ubukhulu buka-6.5.""  This indicates that the earthquake's magnitude was *less than* 6.5.  Option D directly reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukwethuka kwabantu bendawo:**  The text says people started evacuating *before* an official tsunami warning, suggesting the earthquake itself caused the initial concern.
*   **B: Ukwesatshiswa itsunami:**  The text clearly states ""yize kwakungekho ukusabisa kwe-tsunami"".
*   **C: Isixwayiso esakhishwa:**  The text says there *was no* warning issued because the earthquake wasn't strong enough.



"
Yiziphi kulezi zinto ekhuthaza ukusebenza kweLanga kanye nazo zonke izinkanyezi?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukukhanya, inombolo yeRossy kanye nokujikeleza.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ukukhanya nokuphenduka kusetshenziswa ndawonye ukuthola inombolo yeRossby yenkanyezi...""  and ""...umsebenzi wezinkanyezi zonke ohlelweni kutholakale ukuthi uqondiswa ukukhanya kwazo, ukuphenduka kwazo, futhi..."".  This means all three are involved.
* **The passage mentions:** ""inkanyezi ayibi namandla okudonsela emuva amakhulu"" which relates to Rossby number.
* **The passage refers to:** ""ukugeleza kwe-plasma"" which is inherently linked to the star's rotation.

Therefore, the options that accurately reflect the information in the passage are those including *ukhanya, inombolo yeRossy, and ukujikeleza.*
"
Ibonakala kanjani inkanyezi yenombolo yeRossy?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngokukhanya nokujikeleza**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""Ukukhanya nokuphenduka kusetshenziswa ndawonye ukuthola inombolo yeRossby yenkanyezi..."" This directly links the Rossby number to the star's brightness and rotation (revolving).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ngamanani okugeleza kweplasma:** While the Rossby number *is* related to plasma flow, the text says it's derived from the star's *light and rotation*, not directly from plasma flow values.
* **C: Izigaba zokusebenza:** This is too general. While different operating modes might influence the Rossby number, the text focuses on light and rotation as the primary factors.
* **D: Inani lokuguqulwa kukazibuthe:** This is irrelevant to the concept of the Rossby number as described in the text.



"
Lingakanani iphesenti labantu abahloliwe abasekela ukuba i-Australia ibe irepublic ngokushesha?,"The correct answer is **B: Amaphesenti angu-29**.

The question asks about the percentage of people surveyed who believed Australia *should* become a republic as soon as possible. The text states: ""Emananini adlulele wokuvota, amaphesentu angu-29 walabo ababuzwe imibuzo bakholelwa ukuthi i-Australia kumelwe ibe yiriphabhuliki ngokushesha ngangokunokwenzeka..."" (In more recent voting figures, 29 percent of those asked believed that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible...).
"
"NgokukaJulie Gillard, kufanele i-Australia ibe nini yi-republic?","The correct answer is **B: Ngemva kokubusa kweNdlovukazi u-Elizabeth II**.

The text states: ""UNdunankulu Wokunakekela uJulia Gillard wathi phakathi nomkhankaso wokhetho lwango-2010 wayekholelwa ukuthi i-Astralia kumelwe ibe izwe elibuswa ngentando yeningi ngemva kokubusa kweNdlovukazi uElizabeth II.""
"
Iyiphi inhlangano engaphansi kokuphenywa ngokwezomthetho?,"The correct answer is **C: IPlanned Parenthood**.

The text explicitly states: ""Inqubomgomo ka-Komen ukuyekise **Ubuzali Obuhleliwe** ngenxa yophenyo olusalindiwe...""  This means Planned Parenthood is the organization being targeted by the new law and Komen's policy change.
"
I-Cliff Stearns iyinhloko yaliphi ikomiti?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee**.

The text states that Cliff Stearns is conducting an investigation into Planned Parenthood ""as Chair of the Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee."" This means he chairs that subcommittee.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yini engazange yenzeke kowesifazane waseSwitzerland?","The correct answer is **C: Wadlwengulwa abantu abangu-5**.

The text states: ""Sibophe abantu abahlanu abanukubeze ngokocansi owesifazane waseSwitzerland"" which translates to ""We tied up five people who indecently assaulted a Swiss woman."" This indicates she was assaulted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izinto zakhe ezazebiwe zatholakala** - The text mentions she was returned with her belongings, but doesn't state they were *found*.
*   **B: Wabulawa** - The text doesn't say she was killed.
*   **D: Ifoni yakhe neLaptop kwantshontshwa** - The text says she *received* a laptop, implying it wasn't destroyed.

Therefore, the only fact explicitly stated about what happened *to* the Swiss woman, according to the text, is that she was indecently assaulted by five people."
Iyiphi inkampani eyaklonyeliswa iTaiwan Sustainable Award ngo-2007?,"The correct answer is **C: I-ASUS**.

The text states: ""Kepha abathengi bekhompyutha ye-laptop bazohluka kakhulu kakhulu ngemva kokuba i-ASUS iklomeliswe Eklomelweni Wokulondoloza wase-Taiwan ngo-2007 ilungu lesiGungu uYuan waseRiphabhulikini yaseShayina."" This directly indicates that ASUS was the company that received the award.
"
Iyini ikhompyutha ye-ASUS Eee?,"The correct answer is **B: Ilaptop**.

The text explicitly states ""I-ASUS Eee PC...okwaba wundabamlonyeni ngonyaka ka-2007 ngenyanga yeTaipei IT."" and later refers to it as a ""laptop."" While it was groundbreaking at the time, it was a netbook, a type of laptop.
"
Ubani owayenecala lokulahleka kwamadokhuyumenti eposi?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfana**.

The text states: ""izolo, ihhovisi leposi lixolisile kubahlali kanye nakwabezindaba ngemuva kokuthola ukuthi **umfana** ufihle izincwadi zaseposini..."" This clearly indicates the boy was responsible for the missing mail.
"
"Ngokwendaba, ubani owaxolisa mayelana nokulahleka kwamadokhuyumenti?","The correct answer is **D: Ihhovisi leposi lase-Obanazawa**.

The text states: ""Ihhovisi leposi lase-Obanazawa lixolisile kubahlali kanye nakwabezindaba..."" which translates to ""The Obanazawa Post Office apologized to the residents and the press...""
"
UDel Potro waphumela nini obala ngenkinga yehlombe lakhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Phakathi nengxenye yokuqala emdlalweni.**

The text states: ""UDel Potro wayesesimweni esiyinzuzo ekuqaleni engxenyeni yesibili yomdlalo, kodwa lona nawo ubudinga umdlalo wokubona ukuthi kuphumelela bani kwabalinganayo ngemva kokufika ku-6-6. U-Potro uthole ukwelashwa ehlombe ngaleso sikhathi kodwa wakwazi ukubuyela emdlalweni.""

This indicates that Del Potro was injured during the *first set* and had to receive treatment.



"
Waba yini umphumela ngokubambana okokuqala?,"The correct answer is **D: Kwawina uDel Potro kuyisethi yesibili**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""UDel Potro wayesesimweni esiyinzuzo ekuqaleni engxenyeni yesibili yomdlalo..."" This means he was leading at the start of the second set.  It also says ""...wakingazi ukubuyela emdlalweni.""  Therefore, he must have won the second set, which was decided by a tiebreak.
"
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, ubani ngokuqondile owachayekela esigulini?","The correct answer is **B: Ingane**.

The passage states: ""Namhlanje, sifunde ukuthi ezinye izingane zeminyaka yezingane zesikole ziphawulwe ngokuthi zibeseduze nesiguli.""  This directly indicates that children were found near the patient.
"
"Ngokwendaba, isiphi isiqinisekiso umbusi angazange asenze lapho ekhuluma nezakhamuzi zaseTexas?","The correct answer is **C: Bakuhlomele ukubhekana nezinselele**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ehamba nalezo ziphathimandla, uqinisekise izakhamuzi zaseTexas ukuthi izinyathelo zazithathwa zokuvikela ukuphepha komphakathi."" (He met with leaders, assured Texas residents that steps were taken to protect public safety.) This confirms that steps *were* taken.
* **The passage says:** ""Kunezindawo ezimbalwa emhlabeni ezilungele kangcono ukuhlangabezana nenselele ekhona kulesi simo."" (There are few places in the world better suited to meet the challenge in this situation.) This suggests that Texas was chosen to handle the situation, implying they *are* prepared.
* **The passage states:** ""Waqhubeka ngokuthi, “Lolu daba lubucayi."" (He continued by saying, ""This case is not serious."") This is a statement about the severity of the situation, not a guarantee that people are prepared for challenges.
* **The passage says:** “Qinisekani ukuthi uhlelo lwethu lusebenza kahle ngendlela okumelwe lusebenze ngayo.” (Make sure that our system is working as it should.) This is a reassurance about the system, not about how people are facing challenges.

Therefore, the only guarantee the President *didn't* make is that people are ready to face challenges. He reassured them about safety, the suitability of Texas, and the proper functioning of the system, but not about their preparedness for difficulties.



"
Yimuphi umthombo wezindaba owasungulwa ababengabafundi base-UW?,"The correct answer is **D: I-Onion**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kudala ngaphambi koHlelo lwaNsukuzonke noMbiko kaKholbhethi, uHeck noJohnson bacabanga ukushicilela okwakuzolingisa ngokubhuqa izindaba—kanye nokubika izindaba—lapho besengabafundi e-UW, ngo-1988. Kusukela ekusungulweni kwayo, iThe Onion ibe uhlelo olulingisa izindaba olukhulu...""
"
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungafakiwe ohlelweni olulingisa izindaba olukhulu lwe-The Onion?","The correct answer is **B: Ifilimu**.

The passage explicitly mentions the following as part of The Onion's offerings:

*   **Zindaba ezishicilelwayo (Published stories)**
*   **Iwebhusayithi (Website)**
*   **Inethiwekhi yezindaba yamahora angu-24 (24-hour news network)**
*   **Ama-podcast (Podcasts)**
*   **Incwadi yamabalazwe esanda kumiswa ebizwa ngokuthi Our Dumb World (Recently discontinued book of satire called Our Dumb World)**

However, the passage doesn't mention a **filimu (film)** as being part of The Onion's offerings."
"Ngokwendaba, yini eyayigadwe amaphoyisa?","The correct answer is **C: Indawo yokungena eseDowning Street**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukubhikisha kulaqe cishe ngo-11:00 isikhathi sendawo (UTC+1) eWhitehall ebhekene nendawo yokungena eDowning Street egadwe amaphoyisa..."" This means the police were guarding the entrance to Downing Street.
"
Amaphoyisa abacela ngobani isikhathi ababhikisi ukuba baqhele ukuze kugwemeke ukwakheka kwesiminyaminya?,"The correct answer is **D: Ngo-11:20**.

The text states: ""Ngo-11:20, amaphoyisa acele ababhikishi ukuthi bahlehlele endaweni yabahamba ngezinyawo, bethi kudingeka balinganisele phakathi kwelungelo lokubhikisha kanye nesiminyaminya esakhekayo."" (At 11:20, the police asked the couriers to move on foot, saying it was necessary to balance the right to courier with the existing congestion.)
"
Yini eyiqiniso ngokuphathelene nocwaningo olwenziwa uDkt. Ehud Ur?,"The correct answer is **B: Amanye amagundane ayekade enoshukela awasenawo manje.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Manje sinamagundane anezinyanga ezingu-4 angenawo ushukela ayenoshukela,"" (Now we have 4-month-old infants who were diabetic and are now without sugar).
* Dr. Ur's quote indicates the research is preliminary and doesn't yet apply to Type 1 diabetics.
* Option B directly reflects the information in the first sentence of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imiphumela ingabazuzisa labo abanoHlobo 1 olube khona ngaphambili lulashukela** - Dr. Ur explicitly states the findings don't affect Type 1 diabetics.
* **C: Unethemba lokuthi lokho akutholile kungaholela ekutholeni ikhambi** - While researchers *hope* for a cure, Dr. Ur's quote focuses on the preliminary nature of the findings, not hopes for a cure.
* **D: Amanye amagundane ayengenawo ushukela manje asenawo** - The passage states the infants *were* diabetic, not that they *had* diabetes. This option is a misinterpretation of the information.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini uDkt. Ur amanqikanqika ngayo?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuthi lokho akutholile kuzobasiza yini abantu abanoHlobo 1 lukashukela**.

The text explicitly states that Dr. Ur says the research is ""just starting"" and that this finding doesn't affect people with Type 1 diabetes. He expresses doubt about whether diabetes can be cured, and points out that the findings don't apply to Type 1 diabetics. Option A directly reflects this concern.
"
Yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezingakuchazi ngokunembile lokho okwenzeka ngesikhathi kuphahlazeka indiza CG4684?,"The correct answer is **C: Indiza yazama ukuhlala phansi izikhathi ezintathu ngaphambi kokuphahlazeka.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Cishe imizuzu eyishumi ngaphambi kwesikhathi okwakulindelwe ukuthi ifike ngaso kusuka ekusondeleni kwayo kwesibili yanyamalala."" This implies the plane was attempting to land.
* **The text doesn't say:** The plane attempted to land multiple times.  It only states it was preparing to land and then disappeared.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The text says the *same* bad weather conditions caused the crash that prevented the landing, it doesn't say the plane failed to land because of the weather *initially*.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text says the crash site was *found* today, not that the plane crashed far away.
* **Option D is incorrect:** While the weather *affected* the crash site search, the text doesn't directly state that the weather *affected* the plane crashing *at* the location.



"
Yini eyabangela ukuba iNdiza CG4684 ukuba ingahlali phansi?,"The correct answer is **D: Isimo sezulu sasisibi**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ukuthungatha kuthikamezwe isimo sezulu esibi esifanayo leso esibangele ukuhlika kwendiza okunqandiwe."" (The search was suspended due to the same bad weather conditions that caused the failed landing of the aircraft.)

While the other options might be related to the aftermath, the text clearly points to the weather as the *cause* of the failed landing. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo ezingelona iqiniso mayelana nalokho uFranciszek Kowal abhekana nakho?","The correct answer is **C: Waphula isitulo ngesikhathi ezama ukuphuma**.

Here's why:

* The quote states people were *breaking* windows with chairs, and the windows didn't break easily.  This implies they weren't *picking* the locks or using the chairs to manipulate a latch.
* The quote says people *eventually* broke a window and then escaped *through* it.

Let's look at why the other options *could* be true based on the information:

* **A: Wakwazi ukuphihliza ifasitela:** While the quote doesn't explicitly state *he* broke the window, he *witnessed* others breaking one, and the fact that they escaped through it implies a window was broken. So it's plausible he was involved in some way.
* **B: Waphuma enganamyocu:** The quote doesn't mention anything about whether he escaped with or without injuries. It's possible he escaped unharmed, or he might have been injured.
* **D: Walimala ngesikhathi ezama ukuphihliza ifasitela:**  The quote doesn't say he was injured. It just describes the desperate actions of others.


Therefore, the statement that is *most likely false* based *solely* on the provided quote is that he *picked* the lock (or manipulated the window latch) with a chair.



"
Kungani kuyinselele ukukala umonakalo ongabangelwa iSiphepho uDanielle?,"The correct answer is **C: Kusekude kuqale ukuwa kwesiphepho (It is far from making landfall)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks *why* it's difficult to estimate damage.** The text explicitly states, ""Isiphepho sikude nogu, kusenzima ukubona ithuba lokuthi sigadle eMelika noma e-Caribbean."" This means it's too far away to accurately predict the potential impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kubikezelwa ukuthi lesi siphepho sizoba namandla kakhulu (It is predicted that this storm will be very strong):** While a strong storm *increases* potential damage, the distance is the primary reason for difficulty in *estimating* damage.
* **B: Ososayensi abaqiniseki ngezivunguvungu eziqhubekayo (Scientists are certain about the continuing strengthening of the storm):**  Certainty about strengthening doesn't directly address the difficulty in assessing *damage*.
* **D: Isiphepho sibikwa ukuthi sikude kuneMiami (The storm is reported to be far from Miami):**  This is a *fact* stated in the text, but it doesn't explain *why* damage is hard to estimate. The distance *is* the key factor.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yiziphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana neSiphepho uDanielle esingelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Siseduzane nezwe (It's close to the country)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Isiphepho sikude nogu, kusenzima ukubona ithuba lokuthi sigadle eMelika noma e-Caribbean."" (The storm is far offshore, making it difficult to see a chance of landfall in America or the Caribbean.)

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the text:

* **A: Umonakalo esizowubangela eCaribbean asaziwa (The damage it will cause in the Caribbean is unknown):** The text doesn't mention damage yet, but it's a logical statement given the storm's current distance.
* **B: Sakhandeka Olwandle lwase-Atlantic (It formed in the Atlantic Ocean):** The text clearly states, ""Isiphepho Sasendaweni Efudumele uDanielle, isiphepho sesine esinikwe igama sangenkathi yezishingishane zase-Atlantic ngo-2010, sakhekile ngasempumalanga yoLwandlekazi i-Atlantic."" (Tropical Storm Danielle, the fourth storm to be named during the 2010 hurricane season, formed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean.)
* **C: Futhi singaphenduka isiphepho (And could strengthen into a hurricane):** The text says, ""Usosayensi weNational Hurricane Center uhlongoza ukuthi u-Danielle uzoqina abe isivunguvungu ngoLwesithathu."" (National Hurricane Center scientists forecast that Danielle will strengthen into a hurricane by Wednesday.)



"
"Ngokwendaba, yini okusikiselwa ukuba yenziwe ngesifo gnaphambi kokuba siphenduke ubhubhane oluthinta umhlaba wonke?","The correct answer is **D: Izingane kudingeka zibe nezimpawu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kunokukhathazeka kokuthi iziguli zingathelela abantu abaningi ngokuqhubeka nokuphila kwazo kwansuku zonke uma izimpawu zomkhuhlane zihlala zingezimbi."" This indicates the concern is about asymptomatic (without symptoms) carriers spreading the virus.  Therefore, the key to limiting the spread *before* a global pandemic is to identify and potentially manage individuals *with* symptoms, which is directly related to the children having symptoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kufanele lungabi ingozi kakhulu:** The text explicitly says it's a concern because of the potential for a deadly pandemic.
*   **B: Izimpawu kudingeka ukuba zingabi nzima kakhulu:** The text is concerned about *asymptomatic* spread, meaning individuals without severe symptoms.
*   **C: Abantu abaningi kudingeka bachaphazeleke:** While widespread infection is a concern, the primary focus for prevention *before* a pandemic is understanding the transmission dynamics *with* symptoms.



"
"Ngokwendaba, sasiqhele kangakanani isishingishane neFujian?","The correct answer is **D: Amakhilomitha angu-77**.

The question states: ""Kusukela ngobusuku buka-Agasti 9, iso lesiphepho iMorakot besicishe sibe amakhilomitha angamashumi ayisikhombisakude nesifundazwe saseShayina saseFujiana.""  This translates to: ""Since the night of August 9th, the Moroccan roof has almost been seventy-seven kilometers away from the Fujian province of China.""
"
Ubani owabingelela uGeorge W. Bush ngesikhathi efika e-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: UWong Kan Seng kanye noHsien Loong**.

The passage states: ""Wabingelelwa iPhini likaNdunankulu uWong Kan Seng futhi baxoxa ngezinkinga zezentengiselwano kanye nezokuvakasha kanye noNdunankulu waseSingapore uLee Hsien Loong."" This directly confirms that both Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong welcomed George W. Bush.
"
Umengameli wakhuluma nini ngokwandiswa kwezohwebo e-Asia?,"The correct answer is **C: Kulandela kokuhlulwa okhethweni oluphakathi nesikhathi sokubusa.**

The text states: ""Ngemva kweviki lokulahlekelwa okhethweni lwaphakathi nesikhathi, uBhush watshela izilaleli ngokukhulisa ezentengiselwano e-Asia."" This directly indicates he spoke about it after the election results.
"
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwumgomo oyinhloko kahulumeni?","The correct answer is **D: Ukususa umthwalo emakalishini agcwele kakhulu**.

Here's why:

The passage states the government commitment is ""to support **businesses**"" to ""reduce **disruptions**"".  Increasing the number of businesses to 1,300 is a *means* to that end – a way to address the disruptions caused by overloaded businesses. The goal isn't just to get 300 more businesses (B), or to help ""bad businesses"" (A) - the focus is on mitigating disruptions.

Therefore, option D best captures the overarching government goal.
"
Yini eyamenyezelwa uhulumeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwahlelwa ukuba kusizwe amakalishi engeziwe angu-300**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what the government pledged.** The first sentence of the prompt states the government pledged to support housing.
* **The second sentence gives the specific action:** The government pledged to build an *additional* 300 houses.
* **Option A directly reflects this pledged action.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bazibophezele ukuba baveze izinkinga zamakalishi** - The text doesn't mention the government pledging to *identify* housing problems.
* **C: Bahlela ukuba kusizwe ngezimali amakalishi engeziwe angu-1,300** -  The text mentions the goal of 1300 houses, but doesn't explicitly state the government pledged *financial resources* for 1300 houses. It mentions building 300 *additional* houses.
* **D: Inkinga yokugcwala kwamakalishi izolungiswa ngoMashi** - While the pledges were made in March, the text doesn't say the problem will *be solved* in March. It only states the commitment to building more houses.



"
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi ukwaziswa okwaziwayo?","The correct answer is **A: Izinga lokusongela seliye lancishiswa**.

Here's why:

The quote says: ""Nokho, ukuncishiswa kwezinga losongo ukuthi libe libi..."" which translates to ""However, the decrease in the level of threat means it's not as bad..."" This directly indicates that the threat level has been reduced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Abusekho ubungozi** - The quote explicitly states that the threat *isn't* completely gone, just reduced.
* **C: Kulindeleke ukuba kube nokuhlasela** - The quote says there are no reports *predicting* an imminent attack.
* **D: Iqembu elisebenza ngezezempi liqinisekisile ukuthi ukuhlasela kuzoba nzima** - The quote doesn't mention any military group or the difficulty of an attack.
"
Yisiphi isitatimende mayelana nemibhikisho esingelona iqiniso?,"The correct answer is **C: Ababhikishi babefuna ukuba kwesule iCEP yangaphambili (The protesters wanted to overthrow the previous CEP)**.

Here's why:

* The text states the protest was a *response* to the government's actions and the lack of a proper election. It doesn't say the protesters' goal was to *overthrow* the CEP.  The focus was on demanding a fair election.
* The text confirms options A and B are true.
* The text explicitly states the protest *did* involve violence (""Ubhikisho okuba nodlame ngezinye izikhathi kususwe ukuhluleka kokuba nokhetho..."").
* Option D is directly supported by the text.



Therefore, option C is the statement that is *not* supported by the provided text.
"
Ubani owasikisela ukuba iCEP yokugcina yesule?,"The correct answer is **A: UMartelly**.

The text states: ""UMartelly ufungiise i-Provisional Electora Council(CEP) entsha... Ngenyanga edlule ikhomishani yobumongameli ituse ukuyeka isikhundla kwe-CEP kwangaphambili... **Kuwenza bekuwukusabela kukaMartelly...**""

This indicates that Martelly initiated the new CEP and was behind the decision to dissolve the previous one. Therefore, he was the one who initiated the changes.
"
"Ngokwesitatimende, yini engasekelwa Abezokuzivocavoca base-USA kulandela ukuhlukunyezwa kwabadlali yiNassar?","The correct answer is **C: Ushintsho oludingekile ngaphakathi kwenhlangano.**

Here's why:

The statement explicitly says: ""Sivumelana nokushiwo yi-USOC ukuthi izithakazelo zabadlali kanye namaqembu, kanye nemidlalo yabo, zingakhonzwa kangcono ngoshintsho olunenjengo phakathi kwenhlangano yethu, kunokuthathelwa izitifiketi."" This directly supports the idea of necessary changes within the organization.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukunganeliseki:** The statement expresses agreement and support, not dissatisfaction.
*   **B: Ukusungula indawo enamandla:** While the statement mentions a safe and empowering environment, it doesn't specifically say they support the *establishment* of a new location. It focuses on internal changes.
*   **D: Ucwanigno oluzimele:** While they support an independent investigation, the primary focus of the statement is on the internal changes they're willing to make.



"
"Ngokwesitatimende, yimuphi umgomo oyinhloko kokubili Abezokuzivocavoca base-USA kanye Nekomiti Lama-Olympic Ase-United States njengoba isikhathi siqhubeka?","The correct answer is **D: Ukwenza kube nendawo ephephile yabadlali.**

Here's why:

* The statement repeatedly emphasizes the need for a safe environment for athletes. 
* Both USA Gymnastics and the USOC state their shared goal is to create a safe and empowering environment where athletes can pursue their dreams.
* While acknowledging the need for independent investigations and addressing the Larry Nassar situation, the overarching and shared goal is athlete safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukucacisa ukuhlukunyezwa kukaLarry Nassar:** While important, it's not presented as the *primary* or shared goal. It's a consequence of the larger issue.
* **B: Ukulwela indaba yokunganeliseki:** The statement doesn't focus on fighting discontent.
* **C: Ukulandelela ucwaningo oluzimele:**  Independent investigations are *a means* to achieving the goal of safety, not the goal itself.



"
Umkhumbi wawuphokophele kuphi lapho kwenzeka ingozi? ,"The correct answer is **C: EPalawan**.

The text states: ""Umkhumbi woMphindiseli wohlobo lwemayini wokuzivikela, umkhumbi bowusendleleni eya e e-Puerto Princesa ePalawan."" This means the ship was en route to Palawan when the incident occurred.
"
Yini engelona iqiniso mayelana nomkhumbi okukhulunywe ngawo endabeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Wawusendleleni eya ePuerto Princesa**.

The text explicitly states the submarine was *bound for* Puerto Princesa, but then clarifies it was destined for Sasebo, Nagasaki, Japan. Therefore, saying it was *on its way to* Puerto Princesa is inaccurate.

Here's why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **C: Umkhumbi wokulwa nemayini:** The text says it's a ""submersible mine warfare vessel.""
* **D: Wabelwe kuyiSeventh Fleet yezempi Yasemanzini Yase-U.S:** The text states, ""Inikezwe i-U.S. Navy Seventh Fleet.""
* **B: Wawusekelwe ePalawan:** The text says it was ""bound for"" Puerto Princesa *in Palawan*, which implies its destination, not its location. The ship was on the way.
"
Ubani owethula isitatimende mayelana nebutho lase-US?,"The correct answer is **A: UDonuld Trump**.

The question states: ""uMongameli waseMelika u-Donald Trump, esitatimendeni esikhishwe unobhala wephephandaba..."" which directly indicates that Donald Trump made the announcement.
"
"Mayelana nesitatimende, yiliphi izwe elacabanga ukuthi linomthwalo wokuqapha abalwi ababethunjiwe?","The correct answer is **D: ITurkey**.

The text states: ""iTheki izophatha ukugada amasosha we-ISIS athunjiwe lawo, ngokwesitatimende, amazwe waseYurophu anqabe ukuwalanda."" This directly indicates that Turkey will be responsible for guarding the captured ISIS soldiers.
"
Kukholakala sengathi yaba yini imbangela yokuphahlazeka?,"The correct answer is **B: Umlilo onamandla**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukuphahlazeka kwenzeke phezulu endaweni enezintaba, **kukholelwa ukuthi kubekhona ngenxa yomlilo onamandla.**"" (The earthquake occurred in a mountainous area, **it is believed that it was due to strong fire**.)  While the other options might contribute to the difficulty of the search, the passage directly attributes the earthquake to the strong fire.
"
Ingozi yenzeka kuluphi uhlobo lwesimo?,"The correct answer is **A: Esibi kakhulu (Very severe)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a major explosion, military involvement, difficult terrain, and bad weather hindering rescue efforts. This all points to a very serious and dangerous situation. The other options don't accurately capture the severity of the situation.
"
Iziphathimandla zithembe ini ngenxa yezikhukhula?,"The correct answer is **D: Izindawo ezengeziwe zokuhlala kwezilwane zasendle.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lenzika beyidingeka ekwenzeni izindunduma zesihlabathi nezingu, ezisebenza njengendawo yokuhlala yezilwane zasendle."" (The silt was needed to make gravel beds and riffles, which served as habitat for wildlife.)  The authorities are hoping the increased water level after the flood will replenish these gravel beds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukufakwa kwenhlabathi emasakeni** (The placement of silt in fields) - While silt *is* placed in fields for farming, this isn't the reason the authorities are hoping for the flood.
* **B: Ukwakhiwa kwamabhishi** (The construction of dams) - The dams were built *before* the flood, and the passage is discussing the *effect* of the flood.
* **C: Ukwanda kwesibalo sohlobo oluthile lukafishi onegquma** (An increase in the population of a particular type of bottom-feeding fish) -  The passage mentions the impact on fish, but it doesn't say they are hoping for an *increase* in a specific type of fish.  The concern is about the impact on the fish population at all.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okwathinta ngokuphelele ukwakhiwa kwedamu?,"The correct answer is **C: Indawo yokuhlala izilwane zasendle (Wildlife habitat)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the silt from the floods was used to make gravel beds, which serve as habitat for animals.
* The flooding *caused* the silt to be distributed, directly impacting the habitat.
* The passage discusses the effect on wildlife populations (whales and humpback chub), emphasizing the habitat's importance.

While the other options are mentioned, they are secondary to the primary impact on the wildlife habitat:

* **A: Izingxobo zesihlabathi (Earthquakes):** Earthquakes are not mentioned as a factor related to the dam's construction.
* **B: Uhlobo oluthile lukafishi onegquma (A specific type of gummy fish):** This is irrelevant and not mentioned in the text.
* **D: Ukusabalala kohlobo oluthile lwamatshe (The spread of a specific type of stone):** While the gravel beds are made of stone, the passage focuses on the *habitat* created by the gravel, not the stone itself.



"
"Ngokwendaba, ubani owanikeza i-United States ulwazi mayelana nokuhlasela okungase kwenzeke?","The correct answer is **C: Umthombo ongadalulwanga (An unnamed source)**.

The text explicitly states: ""IMelika ithi ithole ukwaziswa emthonjweni ongadalulwanga lowo okhuluma ngokukhethekile ngokusetshenziswa kwabantu abazibulala ngokuziqhumisa ukuqhumisa 'izindawo ezivelele' eTopiya naseKenya.""  This directly points to an unnamed source as the provider of the information.
"
Yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo eziluchaza ngokunembile uhlelo lontamolukhuni lokuba bahlasele?,"The most accurate answer is **C: Ukuqhumisa amabhomu ezindaweni ezinkulu emazweni amabili.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""abeqisi base-Somalia” bahlela ukuhlasela ngokuziqhumisa ngebhomu eKenya **naseTopiya**.""
* **It further mentions:** ""...okuqhumisa “izindawo ezivelele” eTopiya **naseKenya**.""
* Therefore, the attacks are planned for *both* countries and involve bombs (which are considered powerful explosives suitable for targeting significant locations).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ukuqhumisa amabhomu endaweni ezinkulu zendawo kwelinye lamazwe:** This only covers one country and doesn't mention the planned attacks in both.
* **B: Ukuqhumisa amabhomu emazweni amabili:**  While technically true, it doesn't specify the *type* of attack (bombs) or the target (significant locations).
* **D: Ukuqhumisa amabhomu ezweni elilodwa:** This is incorrect because the text clearly states attacks are planned in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia.



"
Ubani kulaba abalandelayo ongeyena ummeli?,"The correct answer is **D: UMakis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Petros Mantouvalos was dismissed from his position *because* of corruption. He is identified as a member of parliament and a ""speaker."" This indicates he was a person in a position of power.
* Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos are explicitly mentioned as being *imprisoned* for corruption.
* Makis Triantafylopoulos is identified as a journalist who *reported* the news of the corruption. He is not mentioned as being involved in the corrupt activities himself. He is the one who brought the issue to public attention.

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the only one who isn't described as being a perpetrator of corruption. He's a reporter."
Yiliphi iqembu labantu elingabaliwe njengeliyingxenye yesenzo esiyihlazo phakathi nomphakathi ongokomthetho wamaGreek?,"The correct answer is **A: Abezomthetho (Lawyers)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the public outcry is *against* the actions of judges, legal experts, legal advisors, and lawyers. This means lawyers are part of the problematic group being scrutinized. The other options are presented as those *being* scrutinized or involved in the scandals.

Therefore, lawyers are the group being described as ""uncounted"" or part of the problematic actions.
"
I-India yalahlekelwa ama-wicket amangaki?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The passage states: ""...India yenze amaphuzu angu-36 kuphela ilahlekelwa amawikhethi angu-7 kuze kube sekugcineni kwengxenye yomdlalo.""  This directly tells us India lost 7 wickets.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ayethini amaphuzu aphakeme kulowo mdlalo?","The correct answer is **A: ama-run angu-70**.

The passage states: ""URobin Uthappa wenza ama-innings abe aphezulu kakhulu, wenze ama-runs awe-70..."" which directly indicates that Robin Uthappa scored the highest number of runs in the match.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeyona imbangela yokukhungatheka kuka-Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **A: Umthetho omusha engosini mayelana nezinto zocansi**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states Adam Cuerden is upset because Wales initially made legal claims (which he believes were based on false premises), then ignored his attempts to communicate, and finally removed his artwork. 
* The text *doesn't* mention any new law about pornography.

The other options are directly mentioned as contributing to his frustration:

* **B: Ukususwa kobuciko baseWales:**  The text states this happened after he was seemingly ignored.
* **C: Ukungalalelwa yiWales:** This is directly stated as a reason for his unhappiness.
* **D: Amanga mayelana nembangela yokususwa kobuciko:** He believes the reasons given for the removal were false or misleading.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini eyasuswa kule ngosi?","The correct answer is **A: Ubuciko**.

The text states: ""...kuze kube sekususweni kobuciko bakhe."" ( ...until his art was removed.)
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungasekelwa u-Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **B: Izimbangi zaseBrithani**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""Ngaphezu kokuphawula kwakhe uthe uzosekela abaqophisana nabase-British emidlalweni yama-Olempikhi ayebanjelwa e-London ngo-2012."" (In addition to his comment, he said he would support the British competitors in the 2012 London Olympics.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Okuhlanganisa abalwayo babesifazane kwezama-Olympic:** While the passage mentions his initial belief that women shouldn't box, it also states he *will* support female competitors in the 2012 Olympics.  However, the passage doesn't say he's in favor of *including* female boxers in general.
* **C: Okungakhethwa abesifazane:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about female athletes being selected.
* **D: Ukuzingatha ama-Olympic eLondon:** While he's supporting the British team in the London Olympics, the question asks what he *will* support, and the more direct answer is the British competitors.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo u-Amir Khan azokweseka naphezu kwalokho yena angase akukhethe?","The correct answer is **C: Ama-Olympic ango-2012**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Amir Khan will support British athletes in the **2012 Olympics** *despite* his earlier statement opposing women fighting.
* While he initially expressed an opinion against female fighters (A), the question asks what he will support *in addition* to what he *might not* choose.
* He will support British athletes (B) but the context emphasizes his support for the games themselves.
* He has nothing to do with other athletes winning silver medals (D).

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that he will support the 2012 Olympics."
Washona nini uPeter Lenz?,"The correct answer is **B: Ngemva kokuwa ebhayisikilini**.

The passage states: ""washona ngemva kokuthinteka enhlekeleleni eyenzeke e-Indianapolis Motor Speedway."" and then explains he crashed his race car.  Therefore, he died *after* the crash.
"
Ubani uXavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Omunye wabagijimi (another racer)**.

The text states that Peter Lenz was hit by a competitor, and that competitor was Xavier Zayat. This implies Xavier Zayat is also a racer.
"
Kukusiphi isimo lapho oshayela izindiza engazuza ekuqondeni ukusebenza kwangaphakathi kwendiza?,"The best answer is **B: Ekwesabeni kwabo ukundiza ukuthi kumayelana nokwesaba into engaziwa.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt focuses on fear of the unknown.** The text explicitly states that fear of flying is often rooted in not understanding how planes work and the feeling of not being in control. 
* **Option B directly addresses this.**  It says the fear of flying stems from fearing the unknown, aligning perfectly with the text's explanation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Uma omunye wabagibeli enamahloni ngenxa yalokho akwesabayo:** While anxiety can be present, the text isn't specifically discussing individuals who are *already* anxious; it's discussing the *cause* of anxiety related to flying in the first place.
* **C: Uma umgibele esaba zonke izinhlobo zezinto zokuthutha:** This is too broad. The text focuses specifically on fear of flying, not a general fear of all transportation.
* **D: Uma ukwesaba kwabo kuqhamuka esenzakalweni esethusayo esingahlobene nokundiza:** This describes a situation where anxiety might be triggered by an external event, not necessarily a fundamental fear related to flying itself.



"
"Mayelana nale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo umuntu ohambayo okhathazeka ngamanani okufanele akhathazeke ngakho ekugcineni?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuqhathanisa amanani phakathi kwezinkampani eziningi zezokuthutha.**

Here's why:

The passage highlights that flight prices can vary significantly between different providers. The core concern for someone worried about getting a good price is to compare those prices. Options A, B, and D are steps *towards* comparison, but comparison itself is the crucial action to address the price concern."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini umuntu othatha uhambo okufanele ayenze kuqala ukuze athole amanani amahle endiza?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuqhathanisa amanani phakathi kwezinkampani ezahlukahlukene ezikoleka imininingwane bese zenza ama-link.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that it's often beneficial to compare prices across different sources before booking. This is because prices can vary significantly. Option B directly reflects this advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukubheka iwebusayithi yamabhanoyo:** While checking airline websites is a good practice, it's not the *first* step. Comparing prices across *multiple* websites is more effective.
* **C: Ukubhukha ngokuqondile enkampanini yezamabhanoyi:**  The passage highlights the benefit of comparison, implying booking directly might not always yield the best price.
* **D: Ukubhukha ngokuqondile ne-ejenti:**  This is irrelevant to the core message of the passage about price comparison.



"
Kunini lapho umngane kudingeka aphelezele ohambisa izinto?,"The correct answer is **C: Lapho izinto zithunyelwa njengemithwalo okuzodingeka ukuba ihlolwe.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uma bebathumele zonke izinto ngebhanoyi, kwezinye izindlela bekuzothatha izinsuku ukwehlisa imithwalo nokudlula kwabahlola amaphepha. Indlela elula yokuyingenisa ngokushesha ukuthi uyithumele njengomthwalo ohloliwe."" This directly connects the need for a forwarder (umngane) with shipments that require inspection and are sent as cargo.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lapho izinto zithunyelwa ngendiza:** While air shipments are mentioned, the passage highlights a problem with *all* air shipments (inspection delays), not just those.
* **B: Lapho inkampani isebenzisa ezayo izindiza:** This is irrelevant to the need for a forwarder.
* **D: Lapho okuthunyelwayo kuzosingathwa inkampani enkulu:** The passage doesn't specify anything about being consolidated by a larger company.

Therefore, option C is the only one supported by the text.
"
"Ngokusekelwe kule ndaba, lapho kukhethwa Ozoshayela Njalo Indiza yiziphi izinto ezilandelayo okufanele zibe semqoka?","The correct answer is **A: Inkampani yezindiza enikeza amaphuzu amaningi.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""name of your Fuest Flyer airline partner carefully. Even if you think you can just join the airline you use most often, you should note that the rights offered vary and points may be available on other routes for the same money.""

This highlights that the *number of points* earned is a key consideration.  While loyalty programs are beneficial, the passage emphasizes comparing *points availability* across different partners.  Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Inkampani yezindiza enomfelandawonye omkhulu:** The passage *doesn't* focus on the number of partnerships an airline has.
* **C: Inkampani yezindiza ovame ukuhamba ngayo:**  The passage warns *against* simply choosing the airline you use most often, suggesting that this might not be the most beneficial strategy.
* **D: Inkampani yezindiza engase yengeze amalungelo engeziwe:**  While potentially a benefit, the passage doesn't emphasize this as a primary factor. The focus is on the points system.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase anikeze amaphuzu okundiza amaningi?","The correct answer is **A: Inkampani ehlukile yomfelandawonye ohlukile (A different alliance partner)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the number of miles/points you earn can vary depending on the airline alliance partner. It also mentions that you might get more points by flying with a different airline within the same alliance compared to sticking with your usual airline.  

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B & C: Inkampani yezindiza ovame ukuhamba ngayo ngaphansi komfelandawonye ofanayo/hlukile (The airline you frequently fly with under the same/different alliance):** The text says to *carefully choose* an airline partner and that benefits can *change*. It doesn't imply that sticking with the same airline under an alliance is automatically the best option.  It suggests exploring other options.
* **D: Inkampani ehlukile yomfelandawonye ohlukile (A different alliance partner):**  This is also a possibility, as the text suggests comparing benefits across different alliance partners. However, **A is the broader and more encompassing answer** because the text is emphasizing the *difference* between partners.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izinzwa ezilandelayo ezingalimala ngokuphuza kakhulu utshwala?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuhogela (Blinding)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Izinto ezithinta impilo ngokuhamba kwesikhathi ngenxa yokuphuza ngokweqisa zingahlanganisa ukulimala kwesibindi **nobutshwala** nokufa.""  While ""ukulimala kwesibindi"" is mentioned, ""obutshwala"" is an error. It should be ""ukulimala kwesibindi **nobumpumputhe**"".  However, among the choices provided, ""Ukuhogela"" which means blinding, is a serious and long-term consequence of excessive alcohol consumption, particularly from illicit sources like bootleg liquor which can contain methanol.

Therefore, **D: Ukuhogela** is the best fit, even though the phrasing in the original text is slightly off.
"
"Njengoba kubonisiwe kule ndaba, yini enganciphisa ukulinyazwa utshwala?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuphuza utshwala ngezinga elifanele.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Phuza iziphuzo ezidakayo ngokulinganisela. Iziphuzo ezidakayo zithinta wonke umuntu ngokuhlukile. Ukwazi umkhawulo wakho kubaluleke kakhulu."" This directly supports the idea that drinking in moderation helps reduce the risk of alcohol-related harm.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuphuza utshwala kanye ne-methanol:**  The passage warns *against* drinking methanol, not that it helps reduce intoxication.
* **B: Ukuphuza utshwala obunamandla obuwumkhiqizo ongekho emthethweni:**  This is explicitly presented as dangerous and increases the risk of harm.
* **D: Ukuphuza nabantu abahlukahlukene:** The passage doesn't mention anything about drinking with different people and whether that reduces intoxication.

Therefore, only option C aligns with the information provided in the passage.
"
Yikuphi lapho emakhulu khona amanani ezindlu phakathi ne-Amsterdam?,"The correct answer is **A: EsiGodini saseCanal**.

The text explicitly states: ""...amanani wezindlu aphakathi kwamanye aphezulu ezweni"" (the average house prices are among the highest in the country) and that the Canal District is located around Binnenstad. Therefore, the Canal District is where the highest house prices are found.
"
Kungani isiGodi saseCanal sibekwe eNdaweni Yase-UNESCO World Heritage?,"The correct answer is **A: Kunamagugu ezomlando namasiko (Historical and cultural significance)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Indawo yonke imiswe njengeNdawo Yefa Lomhlaba ye-UNESCO ngenxa yesiko layo elihlukile negugu elingokomlando..."" which translates to ""...the entire area is designated as a UNESCO World Heritage site due to its unique culture and historical significance...""

While options B, C, and D are all true statements about the Canal District, they are *reasons* *why* it was designated a UNESCO site, but option A encompasses the overarching reason mentioned in the text.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okwenza ukuvakashela iPhnom Krom kube okwanelisayo?","The correct answer is **A: Indlela ebukeka ngayo indawo yaseTonle Sap**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically mentions that ""Isimo sokungabi nathemba sethempeli nokubona indawo ngaphezu kwechibi leTonle Sap kwenza ukugibela igqube kufanelwe umzamo."" This highlights the scenic view of Tonle Sap as a key aspect of the visit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuvakasha kulo lonke elase-Angkor Pass:** While an Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple, the passage doesn't say it's *what makes* the visit satisfying. It's a logistical requirement.
* **C: Ukubona iSiem Reap:** The text only mentions Phnom Krom's location *relative* to Siem Reap, but doesn't say seeing Siem Reap is a highlight of the temple visit itself.
* **D: Ukuhamba ngesikebhe edamini:** Taking a boat trip *to* the lake is mentioned as a good way to combine the visit, but the text emphasizes the view *of* the lake as the satisfying element.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini edingeka ezivakashini ukuze zingene ePhnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuthola i-Angkor Pass**.

The text explicitly states: ""Indawo Yokudlula yase-Angkor iyadingeka ukuze ungene ethempelini ngakho ungakhohlwa ukuza nephasiphothi yakho uma uya eTonle Sap."" (An Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your pass if you are going to Tonle Sap.)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuqwala udlule ithempeli iYasovarman** - While the temple was built during the reign of King Yasovarman, the text doesn't say you need to *visit* the temple to enter.
*   **B: Ukuhamba ngaseSiem Reap** - This is relevant to the general area, but not specifically required to enter Phnom Krom.
*   **D: Ukuhamba ngesikebhe ukuzungeza i-Tonle Sap** - Taking a boat trip is suggested as a complementary activity, but not a requirement to enter the temple.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungavimbel izivakashi ukuba zivakashele i-Antarctica?","The correct answer is **A: Izindleko ezinkulu zokuhamba (Expensive travel costs)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ukuvakasha kwezivakashi kuyabiza"" which translates to ""Tourist visits are expensive"".
* Option B is incorrect because the passage mentions visitors are restricted in the Ross Ice Shelf, not that they can't visit the Ross Sea itself.
* Option C is incorrect because the passage says the best time to visit is November to February.
* Option D is incorrect because the passage indicates that while it's challenging, travel *is* possible (although expensive).



"
Isivakashi esinesithakazelo ezintabeni singavakashela yiphi ingxenye yase-Antartica?,"The correct answer is **B: Indawo emaphakathi nezwe**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kwezinye izikhathi ukuvakasha kwasemoyeni kochwephesha kuya phakathi nezwe, ukugibela izintaba noma ukufinyelela kuyiPole, enesiqu esikhulu."" This directly indicates that exploring the mountains is possible in the interior of Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ULwandle LwaseRoss:** The text mentions the Ross Sea in the context of strict regulations, not mountain exploration.
*   **C: Indawo eyinhlonhlo:**  The text doesn't specify that the research stations are particularly suited for mountain exploration.
*   **D: Indawo eyisiqhingi:** Similar to research stations, the text doesn't highlight the stations as mountain exploration destinations.



"
Ijwayele ukuba kuphi indawo yasendulo yokubuka?,"The correct answer is **B: Enkabeni yedolobha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngokuvamile zitholakala emadolobheni noma ezikoleni, zitholakala kalula kunalezo ezakhiwe ngezikhathi zanamuhla."" This directly indicates that historical sites are commonly found in urban areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Endaweni engeneka kalula:** The passage says they are *not* usually found in inaccessible places.
* **C: Endaweni ecezile:**  While some might be in secluded spots, the passage emphasizes accessibility.
* **D: Ekolishi:** While some historical artifacts *might* be in schools, the passage states they are *more likely* to be found in cities.



"
Zijwayele ukubekwa kuphi izipopolo zokucwaninga zesimanje?,"The correct answer is **B: Enyuvesi (University)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that historical artifacts are often found in universities and schools, and are more accessible there than modern ones.
* While museums and libraries *can* house research collections, universities are primary centers for conducting research *using* those collections. Universities have the resources and academic environment to actively study and utilize artifacts.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Emuyuziyamu (Museum):** Museums are primarily for preservation and public viewing, not necessarily for active research.
* **C: Endaweni yokufunda (Library):** Libraries are also for preservation and access to information, but not specifically geared toward active research on physical artifacts.
* **D: Esakhiweni esikhulu (Main building):** This is too vague. It could be a university building, but the other options are more precise.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indawo ethule ukuze ujabulele usuku ebhishi?","The correct answer is **B: EMission Bay**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Lawa amabhishi wemindeni aba nabantu abaningi ngezinye izikhathi anezitolo ezihlukahlukene ezigcwele ogwini."" This refers to the ferries in the Waitemata harbor that stop at Mission Bay and St Heliers.
* It also says ""kucishe kube izingu ezinesihlabathi eziyindawo ephephile yokubhukuda"" referring to the ferries.
* While St Heliers is mentioned, the passage highlights Mission Bay and St Heliers as ferry stops with shops and a generally safe environment, suggesting a pleasant place to spend a day.
* The other options are either too general (North Harbor District, Waitemata Harbor) or not specifically mentioned as being suitable for a relaxing day of ferry travel (North Harbor District).



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izimo zasendaweni yokubhukuda ezibonakala siphephile?","The correct answer is **A: EDevonport**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kucishe kube izingu ezinesihlabathi eziyindawo ephephile yokubhukuda, kanti kugcwele nemithunzi eyenziwa izihlahla ze-pohutukawa."" Then it describes the Devonport ferry route as being safe for swimming.

While Devonport is *part of* the North Harbor District, the question asks for the *location* that is safe.  Devonport is the specific place mentioned. The other options aren't directly supported as safe swimming locations in the text.



"
"Ngesikhathi uvakashele indawo okukhulunywa ngayo kule ndaba, yikuphi okulandelayo okungabonakala kungafaneleki?","The correct answer is **B: Ukushiya umaka endaweni ethile kwenye yezindawo**.

Here's why:

* The prompt explicitly states: ""Musa ukungcolisa isiza ngokuphawula noma ukwenza imifanekiso esodongeni ezakhiweni.""  This directly addresses leaving marks or making images on the buildings.

Let's look at why the other options are less directly addressed:

* **A: Ukwenza izenzo ezinesizotha:** The prompt emphasizes respecting the site with dignity and reverence, so disrespectful actions would be inappropriate. However, the specific prohibition is on marking or photographing on the buildings.
* **C: Ukwenza amahlaya:**  The prompt specifically warns against making frivolous remarks about the national atrocities.
* **D: Ukunweba isakhiwo:** This is a destructive act and definitely inappropriate, but the prompt's main focus is on respecting the historical significance and avoiding actions that deface the site.

Therefore, leaving marks on the buildings is the most directly prohibited action based on the given instructions.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okuchaza kahle ulimi lokuxhumana?,"The correct answer is **C: Okwakhiwe**.

Here's why:

The definition of a conlang (constructed language) provided states that they are ""nezakhiwe ngenhloso yokulungiselela ukukhulumisana"".  This directly translates to ""constructed with the intention of facilitating communication"".  Therefore, a key characteristic of a conlang is that it is **constructed** (wakhiwe).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Okwenziwayo (Artificial):** While conlangs *are* artificial, ""constructed"" is a more specific and accurate descriptor.
*   **B: Okungekho ngokwemvelo (Non-natural):**  All conlangs are non-natural, but this is a general characteristic and not the defining feature.
*   **D: Okuphilayo (Living):** Conlangs are *not* living languages. They are intentionally created and not organically evolved.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende esingazichazi ngokunembile izilimi ezisizayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Kunezilimi ezakhiwe ukuze kuthuthukiswe izindlela zokuxhumana**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks which statement *doesn't* accurately describe auxiliary languages.** The passage defines auxiliary languages as constructed languages created *specifically* to facilitate communication between people who don't share a common native language.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kunezilimi ezingokwemvelo ezisetshenziswayo ukuxhumana nabantu okungenzeka abakwazi ukuqonda lokho omunye akushoyo.**  This statement is incorrect.  The passage explicitly states auxiliary languages are created *because* of difficulty in communication between speakers of different languages. It's the opposite of what this option describes.
* **B: Kunezilimi ezingokwemvelo kanti ezinye zakhiwe.** While it's true that some auxiliary languages *are* constructed, the key point of auxiliary languages is that they are *created* for a specific communication purpose. This option doesn't capture that nuance.
* **D: Kunezilimi ezenziwe ezikhonyayo phakathi kwezikhulumi zezilimi ezingafani.** This option describes the *purpose* of auxiliary languages well. The passage states they are created to bridge communication gaps between speakers of different languages.

Therefore, option C is the only one that doesn't accurately describe the fundamental purpose and nature of auxiliary languages as defined in the passage.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini umgibeli okufanele ayibheke emkhumbini uma kuhanjewa ebusika?","The correct answer is **B: Izimfuneko ze-Visa**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Kulindelwe ukuthi abahamba ngomkhumbi bahlangabezane nezimfuneko ze-visa (hlola imigomo).""  This directly highlights the importance of checking visa requirements.

While the other options are relevant to a trip, the passage *specifically* emphasizes visa requirements in the context of a winter cruise in the Baltic region.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uma umkhumbi uhamba ehlobo, yini okufuneka bakwazi ukuyigwema?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhamba eqhweni**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""njengoba ukuhamba eqhweni kubangela ukungaphatheki kahle emakhaleni kulaba abathinteke kakhulu."" (as ice skating causes instability on the ice for those who are affected the most). The question asks what the cruise ship needs to avoid if it's sailing in winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Isikhathi edolobheni (Time in the city):** The passage doesn't mention time in the city being an issue.
*   **C: Izimfuneko ze-Visa (Visa requirements):** While the passage mentions visa requirements, it doesn't frame avoiding them as a direct concern related to the cruise itself. It's a general requirement for passengers.
*   **D: ISaint Petersburg (Saint Petersburg):** The passage mentions Saint Petersburg as a destination, but not as something to avoid.

Therefore, the only issue the passage directly links to winter sailing and instability is **ukuhamba eqhweni (ice skating)**. This suggests that the cruise ship should avoid sailing in areas where ice skating is prevalent or where ice conditions are dangerous.
"
Kungani isiCatalan sivame ukusetshenziswa ezimpawini nasezazisweni zaseBarcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ulimi lokuqala olusemthethweni lwedolobha.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""izimpawu eziningi ziboniswe kuphela ngesi-Catalan ngoba simiswe ngokomthetho njengolimi lokuqala olungokomthetho."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngoba iqondakala kalula kuneSipnishi:** While comprehension might be higher for some, the reason for its mandated use isn't solely about ease of understanding.
* **C: Ulimi olukhethwayo eBarcelona:**  The text says it's *mandated*, not chosen.
* **D: IMetro kanye nezakhiwo zomphakathi zisetshenziswa njalo ngabantu abakhuluma isiCatalan:** This is a consequence of the law, not the reason *why* it's used.



"
Yiziphi kulezi zilimi ezilandelayo ezisetshenziswa uhlelo lwaseBarcelona iMetro ekwenzeni izaziso?,"The correct answers are **A: IsiNgisi** and **D: IsiFulentshi**.

The text explicitly states that the metro system uses multiple languages for unplanned disruptions, including English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, in addition to Spanish and Catalan.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izinto kulezi ezilandelayo ongase ungazitholi ezindaweni zokulala eziphezulu?","The correct answer is **D: I-inthanethi esheshayo**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes luxurious accommodations focusing on:

*   **Exceptional sleeping arrangements:** Handmade beds, antique beds.
*   **Gourmet breakfast:** Local, seasonal dishes, special meals.
*   **Atmosphere:** Historic buildings, antique furniture, well-maintained gardens, a swimming pool.

While the passage describes high-end amenities, it doesn't mention or imply that fast internet is a key feature of these establishments. The focus is on a more traditional, luxurious, and aesthetically-driven experience.  Options A, B, and C all align with the described features of upscale B&Bs."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi kulezi zinto ezilandelayo ezingelona iphuzu elisemqoka lomncintiswano wezindawo zokulala zomntakabani?","The correct answer is **A: Impahla yokuhlobisa evamile (Common decorations)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that B&Bs compete primarily on the quality of the sleeping arrangements and the breakfast. While decorations are *part* of the overall ambiance, the passage doesn't highlight them as a *primary* competitive factor. The emphasis is on the *quality* of the bed and breakfast offerings themselves.

Here's why the other options *are* considered important:

* **B: Ukudla kwasekuseni okuhlukahlukene (Varied breakfast)**: The text explicitly mentions ""ukudla okumnandi kwasendaweni"" and ""isidlo esikhethekile sombungazi"" as important breakfast elements.
* **C: Izinto zombhede ezisezingeni eliphezulu (High-quality bedding)**: The passage states that ""umuntu kufanele athole izinto zokulala zikanokusho"" and mentions examples like handmade blankets or antique beds.
* **D: Ukudla neziphuzo ezithathwe endaweni (Locally sourced food and drinks)**: The text mentions ""ukudla okumnandi kwasendaweni,"" suggesting the importance of sourcing ingredients locally.



Therefore, common decorations are the least emphasized aspect in the context of the B&B competition described in the passage."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kuze kubanjelwe eBeijing ngo-2022?","The correct answer is **B: Indawo yemicimbi iTaizicheng yokutshuza eqhweni**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the indoor snow sports events will be held in the Taizicheng bobsleigh and luge track in Zhangjiakou, which is *not* in Beijing. The opening, closing, and other snow events will be held in Beijing.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuzobanjelwa eBeijing ngo-2022?","The correct answer is **B: Izenzakalo ezenzeka endaweni eneqhwa engaphakathi.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Beijing izobungaza imicimbi yokuvula neyokuvala kanye nemidlalo yeqhwa yangaphakathi."" (Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor snow games.)

While Beijing is hosting the Winter Olympics (which includes snow games), option B is more specific and directly mentioned in the text. Options A and C are too general. Option D only mentions the closing ceremony, not all events."
Obani abasengcupheni enkulu yokuthola umkhuhlane wezinyoni?,"The correct answer is **A: Abantu abathanda ukubuka izinyoni (People who enjoy birdwatching)**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""Abaningi bahlanganisa abantu abasebenza ngezinkukhu, kodwa zikhona nezingozi kubabheki bezinyoni."" This translates to ""Many include people who work with chickens, but there are dangers for birdwatchers.""  This implies that birdwatchers are a significant group exposed to avian flu.

While the other options are mentioned as *potential* groups exposed, the text specifically highlights the risk to birdwatchers. Therefore, it's the most accurate answer.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwuchaza ngokunembile umkhuhlane wezinyoni?","The correct answer is **C: Abantu abathanda ukubuka izinyoni basengcupheni yokutheleleka.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Abaningi bahlanganisa abantu abasebenza ngezinkukhu, kodwa zikhona nezingozi kubabheki bezinyoni."" (Many associate people who work with chickens, but there are risks for birdwatchers.) This implies that birdwatchers are also at risk of contracting the Avian influenza.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The passage specifically mentions risks for *birdwatchers*, not just those who work with chickens.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage mentions human cases, but it doesn't say they are *more* frequent than in birds.  It just says cases *have been reported* in humans.
* **Option D is incorrect:**  The passage says the disease *has been reported* in humans; it does not state that *all* infected people died.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information given in the passage.

Umfula i-White Sea–Baltic Canal uxhumanisa ini nani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ulwandle i-Arctic noLwandle iBaltic**.

The text states: ""Ulwandle oluMhlophe–Umsele i-Baltic luhlanganisa uLwandlekazi i-Arctic noLwandle i-Baltic...""  This directly answers the question about what the White Sea-Baltic Canal connects.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, amaphasiphothi athathwa ohlotsheni lwezimoto ezinjani ukuze abagibeli bangaphazamiseki?","The correct answer is **B: Izitimela okwazi ukulala kuzo ebusuku**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kulezi zitimela okulalwa kuzo, iphasiphothi ingathathwa ukhondakta ukwenzela ukuthi ungaphazamiseki uma sewulele."" This translates to: ""In these sleeping trains, the passport can be taken by the conductor so that you are not disturbed when you sleep.""

Therefore, the passport is taken on **sleeping trains** to allow passengers to sleep undisturbed.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yinini lapho umazisi wakho engahlolwa khona kwezinye izitimela ezeqa umngcele?","The correct answer is **D: Esitimeleni esigijimayo**.

The passage states: ""Kwezinye izitimela eziya emazweni angomakhelwane ukuhlolwa kwenziwa esitimeleni esihambayo..."" which translates to ""On some trains going to neighboring countries, the inspection is done on the moving train..."" Therefore, the inspector can check you on a moving train.
"
Iziphi kulezi zinkinga ezilandelayo engase iphakame lapho usezindaweni ezisemahlathini zaseSingapore?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukushiselwa kakhulu**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that in the northern and inland parts of Singapore, you'll encounter ""heat (always) and very hot sun (rarely but it happens).""  This directly relates to extreme heat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukubanjwa inkunzi (Heatstroke):** While heatstroke is a risk in hot environments, the passage doesn't specifically mention it.  Extreme heat *can* lead to heatstroke, but it's not the directly stated problem.
* **B: Lapho izitolo zingekho (Stores are missing):** The passage states that you can buy almost anything upon arrival, so this is the opposite of what's described.
* **D: Ukuduka (Drought):** The passage focuses on heat, not a lack of water.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **C: Ukushiselwa kakhulu (Extreme Heat)**."
Obani okungase kudingeke ukuba bagweme ukudla izinto ezenziwe ngofulawa zaseJalimane?,"The correct answer is **A: Umuntu oguliswa amakinati (Someone allergic to nuts)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that German baked goods often contain almonds and hazelnuts. Nuts are a common allergen, so someone with a nut allergy would need to avoid these items.

The other options are not directly related to the text's description of German baked goods:

*   **B: Umuntu othanda idizethi enokhilimu (Someone who likes desserts with cream):**  The text doesn't mention cream being a common ingredient.
*   **C: Umuntu ongawuthandi ushokholethi (Someone who doesn't like chocolate):** The text doesn't mention chocolate as a common ingredient.
*   **D: Umuntu othanda izinto ezinoshukela kunezimuncu (Someone who prefers sweeter things over savory):** The text describes the baked goods as sweet, but doesn't mention a preference for sweetness over savory.



"
Yisiphi isithako esibhekwa njengesivela ngenkathi ethile yaseJalimane?,"The correct answer is **A: Ama-apula**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ukudla okubhakwayo kwezithelo kuvamile, okunama-apula aphekwayo afakwa ezintweni ezibhakwayo unyaka wonke..."" (Fruit pastries are common, with cooked apples being added to pastries year-round...)
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kukhuthazwe esilinganisweni semali yokuvakasha?","The correct answer is **C: Ukucela abantu imali (Asking people for money)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the advice focuses on ethical ways to travel cheaply and see the world without spending much money. It specifically *excludes* actions like stealing, illegal trading, or exploiting people. 

Asking people for money falls under unethical behavior and is therefore *not* encouraged. The other options are presented as acceptable strategies:

*   **A: Ukuthola umsebenzi ongafamile phakathi nokuvakasha (Getting a part-time job while traveling):** This is a legitimate way to earn money to fund travel.
*   **B: Ukuzivumelanisa nezimo ezingeni lakho elithokomele (Adapting to your budget):** This is core to the passage's message of responsible travel.
*   **D: Ukunciphisa imali ozoyisebenzisela ukudla nokulala (Reducing money spent on food and lodging):** This is a key strategy for budget travel.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase abe nesikhathi esinzima sokuvakasha ngemali encane kakhulu?","The correct answer is **B: Umuntu ongakwazi ukuzibamba uma kuziwa ekuchitheni isikhathi.**

Here's why:

The passage describes a type of travel focused on minimizing costs, even to the point of avoiding paying for things. Option B directly addresses a personality trait that would make this type of travel very difficult. Someone who can't resist taking things or being dishonest would struggle to adhere to the principles outlined in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Umuntu ozilethela izinkinga** - This is too general and doesn't directly relate to the specific challenges of budget travel.
*   **C: Umuntu ohlela ukusebenza lapho ekhona kuyilapho evakashile** - This is actually *aligned* with the passage's focus on working to reduce costs.
*   **D: Umuntu ojabulela ukulandela uhambo** - Enjoying travel doesn't preclude someone from wanting to travel cheaply."
Yisiphi kulezi zitatimende esingakuchazi ngokunembile ukushayela phakathi nePoint Marion kanye neFairmont?,"The correct answer is **D: Inethiwekhi yamaselula akufanele ibe inkinga (Mobile network won't be a problem)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Surprisingly, however, cell phone service is very strong here compared to many other roads, for example, the Pennsylvania State Woods."" This directly contradicts option D.  The text implies the opposite - that cell service *is* a benefit of driving that route.

Let's look at why the other options are plausible, according to the text:

*   **A: Kunebanga elide lendawo engenalutho emgwaqweni (There's a long stretch of nowhere on the road):** The text mentions that the route passes through ""isolated rural areas.""
*   **B: Olayini bancane emgwaqweni (The lines are narrow on the road):** The text describes the roads as ""very narrow.""
*   **C: Akulula ukulalela isivinini esiphakeme (It's hard to hear high speeds):** The text states that speed limits are low and caution is crucial.

Therefore, only option D is directly contradicted by the text."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okufanele kube inkinga kubashayeli abahamba kuthela wayeka waseBuffalo-Pittsburg?","The correct answer is **B: Ukungabikhona kwenethiwekhi yamaselula**.

Here's why: The passage explicitly states: ""Surprisingly, cell phone service is very strong here compared to many other roads, for example, Pennsylvania State Woods."" This implies that cell service is *reliable*, and therefore, the potential problem is the *lack* of cell service elsewhere. The text emphasizes the importance of being prepared because cell service might not always be available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukubanjwa isiminyaminya:** The passage doesn't mention traffic congestion as a primary issue.
* **C: Ukujika kungazelelwe:** The passage mentions winding roads, but not necessarily that turns are dangerous.
* **D: Ukuhlale uhlangana nabasebenza emgwaqweni:** The passage mentions rural areas and potentially animals, but not specifically workers on the road.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungadingi ukuba uqale umdlalo wokugxuma ezintabeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuqeqeshwa kancane**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""(uma kuqhathaniswa nokugibela amadwala amakhulu, i-scuba diving noma i-alpine skiing, ngokwesibonelo) ...kudinga ukuziqeqesha okuncane kakhulu noma isimo somziba ukuze uqale i-canyoning.""  This means you don't need extensive training to start.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ikhono lokubhukuda:**  The passage mentions that canyoning *involves* rappelling (ubhukuda).
* **B: Isimo esisendaweni ephezulu:**  While a good level of fitness is beneficial, the passage doesn't state that a high-altitude fitness level is *required* to begin.
* **C: Ukukwazi ukugxuma:** The passage describes canyoning as including jumping, so the ability to jump is necessary.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kudingeke lapho kuvakashelwa izindawo okugxunywa kuzo ezintabeni?,"The correct answer is **D: Amakhono okubhukuda**.

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoning involves navigating canyons using a combination of rappelling, swimming, and jumping.  **Rappelling** (descending a cliff or rock face using a rope) is a core skill in canyoning, making ""amakhono okubhukuda"" (rappelling skills) essential.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Amakhono amahle okukwazi ukwenza izinto (Good general skills):** While general fitness and problem-solving are helpful, the passage specifically highlights rappelling, swimming, and jumping as key activities.
*   **B: Okuhlangenwe nakho kwangaphambili kokutshuza emanzini (Previous experience swimming):** Swimming is *part* of canyoning, but not the defining skill.  The passage mentions swimming but doesn't say prior experience is *required*.
*   **C: Isitifiketi sokukwazi ukugxuma ezintabeni (Certificate of mountaineering skills):**  The passage specifically contrasts canyoning with activities like mountaineering, scuba diving, and alpine skiing, stating that canyoning requires less specialized training. While some canyoning trips might involve scrambling, a full mountaineering certificate isn't a standard requirement.



Therefore, **amakhono okubhukuda (rappelling skills)** are the most directly relevant skill needed for canyoning as described in the passage."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engaba usizo kumuntu ohlela ukulala emotweni yakhe?","The correct answer is **B: Imoto ekwazi ukuvumela izitulo ukuba zilale.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that using your own car for long trips is appealing because it's familiar and easy to drive. It also mentions that you can set up a tent in various locations.  However, the core point is that you need a car *capable of accommodating sleeping arrangements* – specifically, seats that can fold down or lie flat.  Options A, C, and D are related to the general benefits of using your car, but option B directly addresses the *necessary feature* for sleeping comfortably in a car, which is the key point the question asks about.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini abantu abakhempa ngezimoto abangafuna ukuyigwema uma befuna ukungalahleki?","The correct answer is **C: Ukumisa amatende edolobheni noma endaweni yomuntu.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukumisa itende endaweni enomnikazi noma edolobheni lanoma ibuphi ubukhulu kungabanga ukunakwa okungafunwa.""  The passage is advocating for a more discreet way to camp.  The other options aren't directly addressed as concerns in the passage.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani owaphinde wakha iCasablanca okwesibili?","The correct answer is **A: AmaPutukezi**.

The passage states: ""AmaPutukezi alichitha futhi alakha kabusha ngaphansi kwegama leCAsa Branca..."" which translates to ""The Portuguese conquered and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca...""
"
Ubani owalahla idolobha lesimanje laseCassablanca ngemva kwenhlekelele yemvelo?,"The correct answer is **B: AmaPutukezi**.

The text states: ""AmaPutukezi alichitha futhi alakha kabusha ngaphansi kwegama leCAsa Branca..."" which translates to ""The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca...""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iSintra yakuthola kanjani ukuqashelwa abantu bakwamanye amazwe?","The correct answer is **C: Imibiko emihle yeLord Byron**.

The passage states: ""...elenziwa laduma ebantwini bakwamanye amazwe ngemva komlando walo okuhle wobukhazikhazi balo obhalwe iNkosi uByron.""  This directly links Lord Byron's writings to Sintra's fame among international visitors.
"
Yini engaqashelwa abantu base-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **A: Isifunda saseNagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Nagorno-Karabakh region is disputed and lacks international legal recognition, even for Armenia. Therefore, Armenians might not be able to officially recognize or claim sovereignty over it.
* While the war and conflict are significant events, Armenians have been involved in them.
* While there are tensions with Azerbaijan, the passage implies the core issue is the unrecognized status of Nagorno-Karabakh.
* The existence of the ""new republic"" is precisely *the* issue causing the dispute and lack of recognition.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Armenians may not be able to claim legal recognition of the Nagorno-Karabakh region."
Yini eyaqhubeka nokuthinta ubudlelwane obuphakathi kwe-Azerbaijan ne-Armenia?,"The correct answer is **B: Impi yango-1994**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ngo-1994, uhlanga lwama-Amernian Nagorno-Karabakh esifundeni sase-Azerbaijan yahloma impi ngokumelene no-Azeris."" (In 1994, the Armenian population of Nagorno-Karabakh rebelled against the Azeris.)  This war is the root cause of the ongoing conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ama-Armenia ahlala e-Azerbaijan:** While there *are* Armenian populations in Azerbaijan, the *ongoing conflict* stems from the 1994 war and the unresolved status of Nagorno-Karabakh.
* **C: Izinxabano zamanxusa:**  The passage doesn't mention ongoing skirmishes. The core issue is the unresolved conflict stemming from the 1994 war.
* **D: Isifunda saseNagorno-Karabakh:** Nagorno-Karabakh is the *location* of the conflict, but the *reason* the conflict persists is the 1994 war and the subsequent unresolved political situation.



Therefore, the 1994 war is the fundamental event that continues to damage relations between Azerbaijan and Armenia."
"Njengoba ugibela itekisi eCharlotte, yini engakwenza ukhokhe imali eyengeziwe?","The correct answer is **B: Ukugibela nibathathu**.

The text states: ""Kunenhlawuliso engaphezulu yokuba nabagibeli abangaphezu kuka-2, ngisho noma engaba usizo kwezinye izimo. Lokhu ongakukhetha kungaba okubiza kakhulu kunalokho okudingekayo.""  This translates to ""There is an extra charge for having more than 2 passengers, even though it can be helpful in other situations. This can be more expensive than necessary.""

Therefore, riding with 3 or more people would likely incur an extra charge. The other options are not mentioned as reasons for extra charges in the text.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engabhekelwa phansi ngokuhlala nezingane eCharlotte?","The correct answer is **A: Amanani ezindawo zokuhlala**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Amatekisi awavamisanga ukusetshenziswa imindeni eCharlotte, ngisho noma engaba usizo kwezinye izimo. Kunenhlawuliso engaphezulu yokuba nabagibeli abangaphezu kuka-2, ngisho noma lokhu ongakukhetha kungaba okubiza kakhulu kunalokho okudingekayo."" This indicates a concern about the cost of living and specifically housing prices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukugibela itekisi:** The text mentions the lack of taxi usage for families and the high cost of rides, but it doesn't directly state it's a major concern *for* families looking to live in Charlotte. It's more of a problem *caused by* the family situation.
* **C: Abahlali ababuya kwezinye izindawo:**  The text says people move to Charlotte *because* of family-friendly things, not that their return is a concern for families living there.
* **D: Ukuzama ukujabulela idolobha:** The text says families *can* enjoy the city, it doesn't present it as a concern.



"
"Ngaphambi kokufika eSpain, ubani oqondisa ingxenye engenhla yaseChile?","The correct answer is **D: Ama-Incas**.

The passage states: ""Ngaphambi kokuba kufike abantu baseSpeyini ngekhulu lama-16 leminyaka, iChile esenyakatho beyingaphansi kokubusa kwama-Inca..."" (Before the arrival of the Spanish people in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the rule of the Incas...).
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kwenzeke ngo-1810?","The correct answer is **B: IChile yanqoba abaseSpain**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states, ""ukunqoba abantu baseSpeyini okungumnqamulajuqu akwenzekanga kwaze kwaba ngu-1818."" This means Chile did *not* defeat the Spanish in 1810.
* The text *does* state that Chile declared independence in 1810 (option D).
* Option A is incorrect because the text says there *was* a government (albeit a weakened one) in Spain due to the Napoleonic Wars.
* Option C is incorrect because the text doesn't mention the Napoleonic Wars ending in 1810.

Therefore, the only option that *didn't* happen in 1810, according to the text, is that Chile defeated the Spanish."
Abantu bangafinyelela kanjani esigodini esicezile esisesifundeni saseLiguria?,"The correct answer is **C: Ngesitimela noma ngesikebhe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Izindlela, izitimela kanye nezikebhe kuxhumanisa amadolobhana..."" (Roads, trains, and boats connect the towns...).
* It also states: ""...izimoto azikwazi ukuwafinyelela kusuka ngaphandle."" (...cars cannot access from outside).

Therefore, the only ways to reach the villages are by train or boat.
"
Libhekisela kuphi igama lesiNtaliyane elithi ‘Cinque Terre?,"The correct answer is **A: Izigodi ezinhlanu (Five Villages)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ICinque Terre, okusho ukuthi Amazwe Amahlanu..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means Five Villages...""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwamabhuzu esifanele izindawo ezinokushibilika ezimweni zasebusika?","The correct answer is **B: Amabhuzu anesoli enezinto zokubambelela.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Amanye amabhuzu anezinto ezicijile nokwezinto ezicijile ezifakwayo zezimo ezishelelayo, ezifaneleke izicathulo namabhuzu, ezezithende noma izithende namasoli.""  This directly points to salt and other gripping materials.
* It also mentions that ""Isihlabathi, inhlabathi enamatshana noma usawoti (i-calcium chloride) kuvame ukusakazeka ezindleleni noma emizileni ukuthuthukisa amandla okubamba."" This reinforces the importance of salt.
* Options A and C are incorrect because the text specifies *short* and *wide* studs, not long ones.
* Option D is incorrect because the text mentions a pattern size of at least 5mm.
"
Yini engeke ikusize uhambe kahle emgwaqweni oneqhwa phakathi nezimo zezulu zasebusika?,"The correct answer is **B: Ubhuqu (Ice)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Into eyimbangela evamile yezingozi ebusika imigwaqo eshelelayo, imigwaqo egandayiwe (izindawo zokuhamba) ikakhulukazi izitebhisi."" This means ice is a primary cause of hazardous winter road conditions.
* **The passage also discusses:** ""Izicathulo zasehlobo ngokuvamile ziyashelela eqhweni nasesithwathweni, ngisho nezinye izicathulo zasebusika azifaneleki."" This further emphasizes the slipperiness of ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usawoti (Calcium Chloride):** The passage mentions that salt (calcium chloride) is often used to improve traction.
* **C: Inhlabathi (Sand):** The passage also mentions that sand is often used to improve traction.
* **D: Amanzi (Water):** While water *can* be a hazard, the primary danger described in the passage is ice.

Therefore, ice is the condition that would *not* help you drive safely in winter conditions, according to the passage.  The passage explicitly identifies ice as the major hazard.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwukufana okunembile phakathi kweHawaii kanye neSiqhingi iCook?,"The correct answer is **D: Zombili lezi zindawo azinawo amadolobha**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""IziQhingi zaseCook azinawo noma imaphi amadolobha kodwa zenziwe yiziqhingi ezingu-15 ezihlukahlukene.""
* The text also says: ""Ngesikhathi sendawo esifana nesaseHawaii, iziqhingi ngezinye izikhathi zithathwa """"njengeziseHawaii"""".  ... ikhumbuza izivakashi ezikhulile i-Hawaii ngaphambi kokumiswa njengombuso ngaphandle kwamahhotela amakhulu wezivakashi **nezinye izakhiwo**."" This implies Hawaii *does* have settlements (cities) and hotels.

Therefore, the only similarity mentioned that is accurate for both is the lack of cities.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungayichazi ngokunembile iSiqhingi iCook?,"The correct answer is **C: Amadolobha ayinhloko yiRarotonga ne-Aitutaki.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""IziQhingi zaseCook azinawo noma imaphi amadolobha kodwa zenziwe yiziqhingi ezingu-15 ezihlukahlukene. Eziyinhloko iRarotong kanye ne-Aitutaki."" This means the Cook Islands *do not* have major cities.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurately described:

* **A: Incane kuneHawaii:** The text says ""Ngesikhathi sendawo esifana nesaseHawaii..."" implying they are similar in size, and then describes them as ""njengeziseHawaii,"" suggesting they are smaller than Hawaii.
* **B: Iyiqoqo leziqhingi:** The text clearly states, ""Yidlanzana leziqhingi elineziqhingi ezingu-15...""
* **D: Indawo eyisiqhingi ihlanganyela isikhathi esifanayo njengeHawaii:** The text states, ""Ngesikhathi sendawo esifana nesaseHawaii...""
"
Iyiphi indawo kulezi ezilandelayo zokuhlala ezisehlathini ezinikeza izinhlobo ezimbili ongazikhetha zokuhlala?,"The correct answer is **A: ESirena**.

The text explicitly states: ""ISirena yiso kuphela isiteshi sabanakekeli bamahlathi esinezindawo zokulala zamakamelo alala abantu abaningi nokudla okushisayo ngaphezu kokukanisa."" (Sirena is the only ranger station in the national park that has sleeping accommodations with rooms for many people and hot food in addition to lodging.)

The other options are described as offering only lodging or only lodging *without* food services.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ungayilondoloza kuphi imvume yokupaka uma ufuna ukusebenzisa imali engukheshi kunokusebenzisa ikhadi lezikweletu?","The correct answer is **C: ECafeNet El Sol**.

Here's why:

* The text states that The Park Service (MINAE) doesn't provide permits with credit cards if there's more than a month until your visit.
* CafeNet El Sol offers booking services for a fee, and you can pay with cash ($10 for a day pass).
* Puerto Jiménez is where you *can* get permits directly, but they don't accept credit cards.
* La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos only offer catering, not permits.
* Sirena is the only ranger station with lodging and food, but the text doesn't specify *how* to get a permit there.

Therefore, CafeNet El Sol is the only option explicitly mentioned as a place to obtain a park pass using cash.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lokutshuza olwenziwa ezindaweni ezenyukelayo?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuqwala intaba**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Cabanga ngendlela yokushushuluza eqhweni njengendlela efanayo yokuqwala izintaba."" (Think of ski touring as similar to mountaineering.)
* It further describes ski touring as ""ukushushuluza eqhweni kokuqwala izintaba."" (ski touring for mountaineering).

The other options are not directly supported by the passage:

* **A: Ukuqwala iqhwa** (Snowboarding) - Not mentioned in the text.
* **B: Ukuqwala endaweni engagadiwe** (Mountaineering in remote areas) - While related, the passage frames ski touring as a similar activity to mountaineering *in general*, not specifically in remote areas.
* **D: Ukuhamba eqhweni utete ubhakha** (Ski touring with a fixed heel) -  The passage mentions fixed heel touring in the context of more extreme conditions, but doesn't define it as the primary type of ski touring.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engasiza abashushuluza eqhweni emaphandleni uma befuna ukuhamba ngesivinini esiphezulu?","The correct answer is **B: Isikhwama esisindayo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ngokwethukela okukhulu kuphela ungathola isivinini sokushushuluza eqhweni ezindaweni ezingajwayelekile ngaphandle kwesikhwama esisindayo emizileni elungisiwe."" This directly links a sturdy backpack to achieving higher speeds while ski touring in challenging terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Izicathulo eziqinile (Sturdy bindings):** While important for skiing, the passage doesn't directly link sturdy bindings to higher speeds.
*   **C: Ezimweni ezinhle (Good conditions):** Good conditions allow for longer distances, but don't necessarily guarantee higher speeds *specifically* in ski touring.
*   **D: Emizileni elungisiwe (Groomed slopes):** Groomed slopes allow for faster skiing in general, but the passage contrasts ski touring in *ungroomed* terrain with speed, highlighting the need for a sturdy backpack for that.



"
Abathatha abahambo bahlabezana nokwethuka kokuphinde bangene banesikhathi esinzima sokwenzani?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuphinde uzivumelanise nesiko lasekhaya**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Lapho ubuyela ekhaya usuka phesheya, kuzodingeka ujwayele isiko elisha neminye yemikhuba yakho oyilahlile kusukela ezweni lakini."" (When you return home from abroad, you will need to adjust to a new culture and some of your old habits from your home country.)
* Options A, B, and C are related to the general experience of travel but don't capture the specific difficulty the passage highlights about readjusting *upon returning home*.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukuthuswa ukubuya kungase kube nzima ngokukhethekile kumuntu ovakashile onjani?","The correct answer is **A: Abahambi ababhekane nokuthuka okuthile ngenxa yesiko.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that returning home can be difficult because you need to readjust to your own culture *and* you've also adapted to a new one.
* It highlights the difference in understanding and patience shown to first-time visitors versus those returning home. 
* Option A directly addresses this difficulty related to cultural adjustment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Abahambi abasheshe bazivumelanise nempilo yakwelinye izwe:** While adapting to a new culture *is* part of traveling, the passage emphasizes the *difficulty* of readjusting to *your own* culture upon returning.
* **C: Abahambi abasesesikhathi sokuncebeleka ngezothando:**  The passage doesn't mention love or romance.
* **D: Abahambi abangenaso isikhathi sokuba nesineke:** The passage focuses on cultural readjustment, not time constraints.



"
Yini elandelayo abantu okufanele bagweme ukuyenza nge-moose?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukusondela kuyo kancane**.

Here's why:

The passage states that moose don't typically attack, but will defend themselves if they feel threatened.  Therefore, getting close to a moose increases the risk of provoking a defensive reaction.  The passage explicitly warns against assuming they aren't a threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukungakunaki ukuba khona kwayo** - This is not directly mentioned in the passage. While avoiding attention is good, the passage specifically warns about getting *close*.
*   **C: Ukunciphisa izinga lobungozi bayo** - The passage says people *might* not see them as a threat, but doesn't say it's safe to actively try to reduce the perceived danger.
*   **D: Ukuyibuka ukude** - While looking from a distance is generally a good idea with wild animals, the passage's main point is about *proximity* being the key issue.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende esilandelayo esingelona iqiniso nge-moose?","The correct answer is **A: Iyisilwane esinolaka (It is an aggressive animal)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that moose ""don't like to attack"" and only defend themselves when they feel threatened. 
* Option A directly contradicts this information. 
* Options B, C, and D are all supported by the text. The passage mentions they aren't usually aggressive, but can be dangerous if approached too closely or feel threatened, and will defend themselves if necessary.



Therefore, the statement that moose are aggressive is false according to the passage."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungase kube ingozi ngomuntu ohamba ogwadule?","The correct answer is **A: Ukungabi nazo izingubo ezifudumele ngobusuku obubandayo.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ukwehla kwezinga lokushisa komzimba ingozi yangempela ngaphandle kwezimpahla ezifudumele."" (A drop in body temperature is a real danger without warm clothing.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ukubona utalagu oluzenza sengathi amanzi:** This is mentioned as a potential *deception* that could lead a hiker astray, but it's not the primary danger.
* **C: Ukumosha amandla uzama ukujaha utalagu:** While losing strength can be a problem, the passage links it specifically to following the illusionary water.
* **D: Ukumosha amanzi njengoba ujaha utalagu:**  While losing water is a problem, the passage links it to following the illusionary water source.  The lack of warm clothing is a more direct and serious danger in cold conditions.



"
Yini elandelayo engaboniswanga njengengaba usongo kubantu abahamba ogwadule?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukushiswa ilanga (Sunburn)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on dangers related to cold weather and heat loss during hiking in cold conditions.** It specifically mentions:
    * **Hypothermia** (danger of body temperature dropping)
    * **Following mirages** (leading to dehydration and loss of energy)
    * **Cooling down at night** (leading to hypothermia)

* **Sunburn is a danger associated with *hot* weather, not cold weather.** The passage doesn't discuss sun-related hazards.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned as dangers:

* **A: Ukushodelwa amanzi (Dehydration):**  The passage explicitly mentions following mirages which can lead to dehydration.
* **B: Utalagu (Mirages):** The passage directly states that mirages can be dangerous because they lead hikers astray and deplete their energy and water.
* **C: Ukwehla kwamazinga okushisa komzimba (Hypothermia):** The passage specifically warns about the danger of body temperature dropping, especially without proper clothing.



Therefore, sunburn is the only option not mentioned as a risk in the provided passage about hiking in cold conditions."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiliphi iqembu labantu elathinteka kakhulu ngemva kokufika abahloli?","The correct answer is **C: AbaseTaínos**.

The text states that after the arrival of European explorers, the Taíno population was significantly reduced due to conquest by the Spanish. The text specifically mentions the actions of the Spanish conquistadors and the impact on the Taíno people.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiluphi ulimi olwalukhulunywa abantu baseCaribe?","The correct answer is **D: Isi-Arawaka**.

The passage states: ""AmaCaribe bekungabantu abakhuluma isi-Arawaka..."" which translates to ""The Caribbeans were people who spoke Arawakan...""
"
Ubani onganconywa ngokudumisa ukutshuza njengomdlalo?,"The correct answer is **B: Abantu baseNorway**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ngo-1861 iqembu lokushushuluza eqhweni kokuzilibazisa lavulwa abantu baseNorway e-Australia."" This directly links the Norwegians to the popularization of skiing as a recreational sport in Australia.

While ""Ski Bums"" refer to skiers, they aren't identified as the ones who *popularized* the sport.  The other options (people who live in the mountains, people from Australia) aren't mentioned in the context of popularizing skiing.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kwakungasiphi isikhathi lapho kwabhekwa khona okokuqala ukutshuza njengomdlalo?","The correct answer is **B: Ngo-5000 BC**.

The passage states: ""Umcabango wokushushuluza eqhweni owakudala kakhulu — imidwebo yasemihumeni eveza abashushuluzi baseqhweni ihlehlela emuva ku-5000 BC!"" This directly indicates that skiing was first depicted in cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okumane kuhlotshaniswe njengesiqhingi esikhulu esisogwini olusempumalanga ye-Afrika?,"The correct answer is **C: Izilwane zasendle**.

The passage states: ""IMadagascar yiyo enkulu kakhulu, futhi iyizwekazi ngokwayo uma kuziwa ezilwaneni zasendle."" (Madagascar is the largest, and is a republic in terms of wildlife.) This directly links Madagascar (and by extension, the region being described) to its wildlife.
"
Yini engesona isici seziqhingi ezincane eMpumalanga Ye-Afrika? ,"The correct answer is **D: Ukunganciki kwamanye amazwe (Independence from other countries)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""Eziningi zeziqhingi ezincane izizwe ezizimele, noma zihlangene neFulansi..."" (Many of the smaller states are independent countries, or allied with France...). This means *not all* are independent. 
* Options A, B, and C are all mentioned in the passage as characteristics of these countries. 

Therefore, the statement that these countries are *independent* is not universally true, making ""Ukunganciki kwamanye amazwe"" the incorrect answer.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ama-Easter agujwa kanjani ngamanye amasonto?","The correct answer is **D: Ukubukela ukushona kwelanga**.

The passage states: ""Kukhona isiko lokuhlala ungalali kuze kuhlwe ngobusuku bePhasika endaweni ethile ukuze ubone ukuphuma kwelanga."" (There is a custom of staying awake until Easter night in a certain place to see the sunrise.) This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Babamba imikhuba yokuzala** (They observe fertility customs): While there might be connections to ancient fertility rites, the passage doesn't explicitly state this is the primary way Easter is observed.
* **B: Kubanjwa umlindelo ngoMgqibelo ebusuku** (A vigil is held on Holy Saturday night): The passage mentions some churches holding Easter services on Holy Saturday night, but it doesn't describe this as the *primary* way Easter is observed.
* **C: Ukuba nomcimbi webandla** (Having a church event): While church events are part of Easter, the passage focuses on the sunrise aspect as a core tradition.



"
"Ukuze ugweme izimfuneko ezithile lapho ufika e-Ecuador, umuntu waseCuba kufanele abe nani kuqala?","The correct answer is **C: Ithikithi lokuza nelokubuyela emuva ukuze kubonakale ukuthi uzohlala isikhathi esingakanani.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Iphasiphoti yakho kumelwe ibe semthethweni okungenani izinyana ezingu-6 ngaphezu kwezinsuku zakho zohambo. **Ithikithi lokuya nokubuya liyadingeka ukufakazela ubude besikhathi ozosihlala.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iphasiphothi enezinyanga ezingu-6 ngale kwezinsuku abakasha ngazo** - While having a valid passport with at least 6 months validity is required, the question asks what someone *must have* to avoid certain requirements *upon arrival*. The text highlights the return ticket specifically for that purpose.
* **B: Incwadi engokomthetho yesimemo** -  The text mentions a letter of invitation as part of a structured travel process between the two countries, *but* it states that Cuban residents with permission to live and work in the US must go to the Ecuadorian Consulate to get released from this requirement. It doesn't say everyone needs this letter to avoid arriving requirements.
* **D: Igreen card yase-US** - This is irrelevant to avoiding requirements *upon arrival* in Ecuador. It pertains to permission to live and work in the US.



"
Izimfuneko zase-Ecuador zokuvakasha azenzelwe ini yona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuqondisa ukufika kwabantu abavela kwamanye amazwe.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Lezi zidingo zakhelwe ukunikeza indlela ehlelekile yokuthutha phakathi kwamazwe womabili.""  This directly indicates that the requirements are designed to organize and manage the arrival of people from other countries. The other options are not the primary focus of the text. While they might be *aspects* of the requirements, the main purpose is organized entry.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungabiza kakhulu kwelinye izwe kunasezweni lakini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ifuleyimu yezibuko**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Amafulemu aseqophelweni eliphezulu wamagama abizayo atholakala kulezi zindawo angaba nezinkinga ezimbili; amanye kungaba omgunyathi, **nganye avela kwamanye amazwe angabiza kakhulu kunasekhaya**.""  This directly points to eyeglasses as the item that is most likely to be expensive when purchased from another country.
"
Yibuphi ubungozi bokuthenga ifuleyimu kwelinye izwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Angase abe umbombayi (They may be counterfeit)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Amafulemu aseqophelweni eliphezulu wamagama abizayo atholakala kulezi zindawo angaba nezinkinga ezimbili; amanye kungaba omgunyathi, **nganye avela kwamanye amazwe angabiza kakhulu kunasekhaya.**"" This directly indicates that counterfeit frames are a risk.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Kungase kudingeke ukuba uphinde uhlole amehlo (You may need to have your eyes re-examined):** While it's good practice to get regular eye exams, the primary concern with buying frames abroad is the potential for fake or substandard products.
*   **B: Incwadi kadokotela ingase ingahlanganisi amanye amafuleyimu (The doctor's note may not include other frames):** This is a possible inconvenience but not a direct risk associated with buying frames from another country.
*   **D: Umshwalense ungase ungayikhokheli (Insurance may not cover it):**  The paragraph mentions insurance covering costs at home, but doesn't make a definitive claim about coverage when buying from abroad. It's a potential concern, but not the core risk highlighted in the text.

Therefore, the most accurate and directly supported answer is **C**."
"Mayelana nokusebenzisa imali eFalkland, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende eziyiqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Ngaphandle kwamaphawundi aseFalkland, iphawundi laseBrithani liyimali ngokuvamile eyamukelekayo.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Amaphawundi wase-Britain ngokuvamile azokwamukelwa noma yikuphi eziqhingini..."" This directly supports option D.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The text explicitly says credit cards are *rarely* accepted in the islands.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text says US dollars are *commonly* accepted, not that Stanley is the only place.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The text says it's best to exchange money *before* arriving in the islands.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that accurately reflects the information provided in the text."
"Ngokwale ndaba, lapho uvakashela iFalkland uqhamuka e-United States, iyiphi indlela yokukhokha engase ibe usizo ngaphandle kokusebenzisa ikhadi le-credit?","The correct answer is **A: Estolo iFIC West**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the Falkland Pound (FKP) and British Pound (GBP) have equal status.
* The only place to exchange money on the island is at the bank, specifically at the FIC West branch.
* While GBP and USD are often accepted, credit cards are rarely accepted in shops in the islands.

Therefore, if you arrive from the United States and don't want to use a credit card, exchanging money at FIC West would be the most helpful option.



"
Yisiphi isenzakalo esingahlobene nokugubha umkhosi wasethempelini?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukugubha ukuhlanganisa unyaka ethempelini**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that many temple festivals are celebrated as part of a temple anniversary or the anniversary of the deity's birth.
*  ""Ukugubha ukuhlanganisa unyaka ethempelini"" (Celebrating the temple anniversary) directly aligns with this statement.
* Options A and C are mentioned as *reasons* for festivals, not the festivals themselves.
* Option D is too general. While major events might include the temple, it doesn't specifically describe a type of festival.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided text.
"
Zingabonakala kuphi izindlovu ezihlotshisiwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Lapho kuqhubeka imikhosi ethempelini**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Iningi lemikhosi yethempeli ligujwa njengengxenye yesikhumbuzo sethempeli noma ukugujwa kosuku lokuzalwa likankulunkulu ophethe. Iningi lemikhosi yasethempelini laseKerala iyathakazelisa kakhulu ukuyibona, kanye nokumasha kwezindlovu ezihlotshisiwe...""  This indicates that the elephants are part of the temple festivals, not just generally visible everywhere.

While elephants might be seen *around* temples during the festival period, they are specifically associated with the festival celebrations themselves. Options A and D are too broad and not directly supported by the text. Option B is partially correct, but C is more precise as it connects the elephants directly to the festivals.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indlela kulezi ezilandelayo ongalondoloza ngayo imali uma ugibela i-business noma i-first class ebhanoyini?","The passage states that it's **difficult** to save money when flying business or first class. Airlines know this demographic is willing to pay a premium.  It also mentions that discounts are rare.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Ukuthola isaphulelo (Getting a discount)**.  While not guaranteed, it's the *only* option presented that has a chance of potentially lowering the price. The other options are stated to *not* be effective.

Here's why the other options are incorrect based on the passage:

* **A: Ukuthenga usebenzisa inkampani (Buying through a company):** The passage doesn't suggest this is a money-saving strategy.
* **B: Ukubhuka i-first class kunokubhuka i-business class (Booking first class instead of business class):** The passage implies first class is *more* expensive.
* **C: Bhuka i-first class ebhanoyini elingayi ngqo lapho oya khona (Booking first class on a connecting flight):** While potentially cheaper than a direct flight, the passage doesn't suggest this is a common or effective way to save money.



**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engaba ukumosha isikhathi ukuba uyifune lapho ufuna ukubhuka isigaba esithile?","The correct answer is **D: I-First class**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ngokuvamile, akusizi ngisho nokufuna izaphulelo ezihlalweni zabebhizinisi noma ezinethezekile ohabweni lwendiza oluqondile olusuka ku-A luye ku-B. Izinkampani zezindiza zazi kahle ukuthi kuneqembu elithile eliyisisekelo labagibeli bezindiza abazimisele ukukhokha ama-dollar aphezulu ukuze bathole ilungelo lofika endaweni ethile ngokushesha futhi ngokunethezeka, futhi babakhokhisa ngokufanele.""
* **This describes the characteristics of First Class travel:**  First class is known for its speed, convenience, and high price point. Passengers are willing to pay a premium for these benefits.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Amabhanoyi aya ngqo lapho oya khona:** While this can be true in some cases, it doesn't define the *premium* cabin class discussed.
    * **B: Isigaba se-Business:** Business class is expensive but usually not as expensive as First Class.
    * **C: Izaphulelo:** The passage says finding discounts is usually ineffective for these premium cabins.



"
Yini okungafanele yengezwe lapho uqhathanisa amanani okuya e-Afrika kanye namanani omhlaba wonke?,"The correct answer is **A: Izindleko ezengeziwe zama-visa ezindawo ezingaphandle we-Afrika**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically mentions including extra costs *outside* of Africa (visa fees, travel insurance, transportation) when comparing to a round-the-world trip.
* Option A directly reflects this.
* Options B and C mention costs *within* Africa, which are already considered in the comparison of flight costs.
* Option D mentions transportation costs *outside* of Africa, but the prompt is asking about costs to be *added* to the flight price comparison.  Visa fees are a more direct additional cost.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini izitolo ezinkulu eseziqala ukuyinikeza ehlukile ongayikhetha?","The correct answer is **A: Ukudla osekulungile (Ready-to-eat food)**.

The passage states: ""Ngaphandle kwamathuba okupheka, ongakukhetha nokho kulinganiselwe ekudleni okulungele udliwa."" This directly supports option A.

While options B and C are mentioned as *available* in some supermarkets, the passage focuses on the wider availability of ready-to-eat food as a key advantage. Option D (cheap prices) is a general statement about supermarkets, not something specifically *newly offered* as a distinguishing feature.
"
Yiluphi usizo olunikezwa ezinye izitolo ezinkulu okungase kuthandeke kumakhasimende athenga ukudla osekulungile?,"The correct answer is **D: Imicrowave enohhavini**.

The passage explicitly states that some supermarkets offer microwave ovens or other ways to heat prepared food. This is a direct benefit to customers buying ready-made meals.  The other options are either too broad (A and B) or not directly mentioned as a specific perk related to ready-made food (C).
"
Yini elandelayo engase ingaqondwa abantu abakhuluma isiFulentshi baseBelgium kanye nabaseSwitzerland?,"The correct answer is **A: Indlela yesiFulentshi yokusebenzisa izinombolo (The way French numbers are used)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the way numbers are counted in Belgium and Switzerland differs slightly from standard French.  It also mentions that translations of certain words differ slightly.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Amagama esiFulentshi angaqondakali (French words that are incomprehensible):** The passage states that while there are differences, the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is still mutually intelligible. Therefore, words aren't generally *incomprehensible*.
* **C: Indlela ethile yokuphimisela amagama esiFulentshi (A particular way of conjugating French verbs):** The passage doesn't mention differences in verb conjugation.
* **D: Abantu abakhuluma isiFulentshi baseFrance (French speakers from France):** The passage mentions that speakers from France *can* generally understand the other dialects, not that the other speakers can't understand *them*.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungafani eFrance njengoba kunjalo eBelgium noma eSwitzerland?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuphimisela wonke amagama (Translating all words)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that while there are differences in vocabulary and pronunciation (specifically in numbers), the core French language taught in school is common to all three regions (France, Belgium, and Switzerland). 
* The differences are primarily in *specific* words and number systems, not a fundamental inability to translate *all* words. While some translation might be tricky due to local variations, the general understanding remains.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **B: Indlela izinombolo ezibizwa ngayo (The way numbers are called):** The text specifically mentions differences in the number system in Belgium and Switzerland.
* **C: IsiFulentshi esifundiswa esikoleni (The French taught in school):** The text says people in Belgium and Switzerland learn the standard French taught in school.
* **D: Ukubiza amanye amagama esiFulentshi (Calling other French words):** The text mentions that vocabulary differs slightly, meaning some words are called differently.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the complete translation of *all* words isn't the primary point of difference. There are specific vocabulary variations, but the underlying understanding is generally maintained.



"
Kukusiphi isibonelo lapho kungabonakali khona ukuthi ungathola isibonelelo sokushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Uma ugibele iWestJet**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that WestJet is one of the airlines that *does* offer this benefit. Therefore, the question asking where you *wouldn't* find it points to WestJet.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Uma uzama ukubhukha ngokuqondile ibhanoyi kunokuba usebenzise ezinye izindlela** - The passage states you *must* book directly with the airline to get the benefit. So, trying other methods would likely *not* get you the benefit.
*   **C: Uma uhamba ngeLufthansa usuka ePeris uya e-United States** - The text lists Lufthansa as an airline that offers the benefit, so this is incorrect.
*   **D: Uma ugibele iDelta** - The text lists Delta as an airline that offers the benefit, so this is incorrect.

"
Ikuphi okuyiqiniso ngesibonelelo sokushonelwa?,"The correct answer is **D: Kufanele kubhukwe ngokuqondile nabezindiza usebenzisa ucingo.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Kusizathu konke, kumelwe ubhukhe ngefoni ngokuqondile nenkampani yezindiza."" (In all cases, you must book directly by phone with the airline.)
* Option A is incorrect because the passage mentions the benefit reduces the *number of flights* affected by last-minute changes, not that the cost of delays is covered.
* Option B is incorrect because the passage states bookings *must* be done directly with the airline, not through a website.
* Option C is incorrect because the benefit *reduces* the number of flights impacted by last-minute changes, not that the airline charges for those last-minute changes.



"
Kunini lapho ukusebenzisa khona iGPS ezimele kungaba usizo kakhulu kunokusebenzisa iGPS ekuyi-app?,"The correct answer is **C: Uma uya endaweni lapho ungalahlekelwa khona i-inthanethi.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that smartphone GPS relies on data connection.
* **Independent GPS** doesn't require a data connection, making it ideal for areas without internet access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uma uzama ukulondoloza imali:** While independent GPS can eventually save money compared to car tracking services, the passage doesn't directly connect this to its primary advantage.
* **B: Uma uqiniseka ukuthi uzoba nayo idata yokuxhuma:** This is the *opposite* of when independent GPS would be more useful.
* **D: Uma ungafuni ukuqasha umshini wayo:** This is not related to the functionality of the GPS itself.



"
Ikuphi okungesona isizathu esihle sokusebenzisa iGPS eyi-app kunokusebenzisa leyo ezimele?,"The correct answer is **A: Uma ungadingi ukukhathazeka ngokuxhuma kwidata (If you don't need to worry about data connection)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that GPS apps on smartphones are limited or unusable without data connection or in areas where the signal is weak. 
* The other options are *benefits* of using a GPS app compared to a standalone device:
    * **B: Ukulondoloza imali (Saving money):** GPS apps are often free or included with a smartphone.
    * **C: Ukugwema ukuqasha umshini (Avoiding renting a device):** You don't need to rent a separate GPS device.
    * **D: Ungadingi ukuthenga ibalazwe elisha (You don't need to buy a new device):** You're using the GPS functionality already built into your smartphone.

Therefore, the *opposite* of the advantages of a GPS app is being unaffected by the need for a data connection. The passage highlights this as a significant limitation of smartphone-based GPS.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ungaqiniseka kanjani ukuthi uqondaniswa nomkhumbi ofanele?","The correct answer is **C: Bhukha usebenzisa i-ejenti osebenza ngabavakashela eGalapago.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Qinisekisa ukuthi umuntu okubhukelayo unguchwepheshe wamaGalapago onalwazi oluhle lwezinhlobonhlobo eziningi zemikhumbi.""  Using a travel agent who specializes in Galapagos trips is the most direct way to ensure you're being guided by an expert.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Bhukha nibe iqembu labantu abangu-8+ eninezinto enizithandayo ezifanayo:** While having a group is common, it doesn't guarantee an expert guide.
* **B: Bhukha ngesikhathi lapho bengebaningi ababhukhayo:** Booking during the off-season *might* offer more availability, but it doesn't ensure expert guidance.
* **D: Bhukha kusasenesikhathi:** Booking early ensures availability, but not necessarily an expert guide.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungasetshenziswa njengeqhinga lokukhuthaza izivakashi ukuba ziqhubeke nokugembula?","The best answer is **B: Ukubakhuthaza ngokubapha amathikithi amahhala.**

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on how establishments encourage guests to spend more time and money.** Offering free tickets directly aligns with this goal, as it incentivizes further spending on activities within the establishment.
* **The passage highlights that these establishments use special food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and engaged.** Free tickets are a strong form of entertainment incentive.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ukuningi bokukhanya kwemvelo (Abundant natural light):** While nice, it doesn't directly encourage spending.
* **C: Ukubapha iziphuzo (Offering drinks):** While mentioned as a tactic, it's not as direct a financial incentive as free tickets. It also can be a cost for the establishment.
* **D: Ukungabikhona kwamawashi (Lack of clocks):** This is a strange and unrelated tactic and doesn't encourage spending.

Therefore, **B** is the most logical and effective option based on the passage's content."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini umuntu ogembulayo ohlakaniphile okufanele ayigweme?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuphuza kakhulu utshwala (Drinking too much alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukudakwa kudunga ingqondo, bonke abantu abagembulayo abahle bayakwazi ukubaluleka kokuhlala usangulukile."" This translates to ""Intoxication impairs the mind, all good hosts should be able to appreciate the importance of staying sober.""

Therefore, a good host should avoid drinking too much alcohol to maintain clarity and control. The other options aren't directly addressed as something a host should *avoid* based on the text.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi ingxenye yenkulumo eyenziwa osonhlamvukazi phakathi nomusho?","The correct answer is **A: Izenzo**.

The passage states that Wonke uses the particle ""Sie"" (which is a marker of action/verbs) at the beginning of a sentence, even in the middle of a sentence, to distinguish between actions and things. Therefore, the particle is used to mark *actions*.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engeza kuhluke ukwenza amabizo abe osonhlamvukazi?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuhlukanisa phakathi kwezenzo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wonke amabizo, kanye negama elithi Sie kuwe, ahlala aqala ngosonhlamvukazi, ngisho noma ephakathi komusho. Lena indlela enhle yokuhlukanisa phakathi kwezenzo ezinye kanye nezinto.""  (All names, including the name Sie, always start with an apostrophe, even in the middle of a sentence. This is a good way to distinguish between other actions and things.)

While the other options are *related* to the apostrophe, the passage directly links the apostrophe to the **distinction between actions and things**.  The passage also mentions that the apostrophe helps with reading, but the primary *reason* for the apostrophe is for differentiation.  The difficulty with writing is a *consequence* of the apostrophe's existence.
"
"Ezindaweni zasemaphandleni zaseMalaysia, isiphi isenzo esisho “ukuqoba”?","The correct answer is **A: Ukugobisa umunwe wokukhomba**.

The passage states: ""Ngokufanayo, isihambi saseBrithani eSpeyini singenza iphutha lokucabanga ukuthi ukuvayela okuhlanganisa intende yesandla ebheke umvayeli (kunomuntu ovayelwayo) isho ukuthi buya."" This implies that a similar misunderstanding could occur in Malaysia, where the same gesture (palm facing the person) means ""come"" instead of ""hello.""  The passage also explicitly states that a finger pointing is used to mean ""come."" Therefore, the most accurate answer is the one that represents a finger pointing.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isenzo esingase sisho “ukubuya”?","The correct answer is **C: Ukuhambisa isandla usebenzisa isihlakala sibheke ngaphandle.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ngokufanayo, isihambi saseBrithani eSpeyini singenza iphutha lokucabanga ukuthi ukuvayela okuhlanganisa intende yesandla ebheke umvayeli (kunomuntu ovayelwayo) isho ukuthi buya.""

This directly translates to: ""Similarly, a British traveler in Spain might mistakenly think that a handshake involving the palm facing the person being shaken is saying 'goodbye'."" 

Therefore, the action described as meaning ""goodbye"" (which is the opposite of ""come"" or ""welcome,"" the meaning of a palm-facing handshake in Malaysia) is shaking hands with the palm facing *outward*.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini ebangela imifantu?","The correct answer is **A: Amabhuloho eqhwa**.

The passage states: ""Lokhu kuzobangela ukuqhekeka, imifantu, engafihlwa amabhuloho eqhwa..."" which translates to ""This will cause cracking, **ice holes**, hidden ice holes..."" Therefore, ice holes are the cause of the ice formations (imifantu).
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungafihlwa amabhuloho amaqhwa?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuklayeka (Avalanches)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Izindonga kanye nophahla lwemihume yeqhwa lungawa futhi imiklayeko ingavaleka.""  ""Imiklayeko"" translates to avalanches.

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, abantu abahambayo kufanele bathathe izinyathelo zokuphepha ngaphambi kokuvakashela ziphi izindawo?","The correct answer is **B: Izindawo ezizungeze iGoma**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Nakuba iGoma iphephile ngokwezinga elithile, noma ikuphi ukuvakasha **ngaphandle kweGoma** kumelwe kucwaningwe ukuze uzwisise isimo sokulwa okusesifundazweni saseNyakatho Kivu."" This means travelers need to be cautious in areas surrounding Goma.

While the Nyiragongo volcano is a factor, the text emphasizes the need for caution *outside* of Goma itself. Rwanda is mentioned in relation to gorillas, but the security concern is focused on the North Kivu province, where Goma is located.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kube kuhle ngomuntu ovakashele iGoma?,"The correct answer is **C: Amabhayisikili izinto ezikahle kakhulu zokuhamba hamba (Boda-boda isikhuthazwa)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) are the common mode of transportation in Goma.** This implies they are the preferred and likely the best option.
* **The passage mentions the Nyiragongo volcano's impact on the city.**  This makes options A and D relevant considerations.
* **The passage highlights Goma as a prime location for Mountain Gorilla tracking.** So option B is accurate.
* **Option C suggests motorcycles are a *good* way to get around. However, the passage frames boda-boda as the *common* and therefore the *best* way to travel.** Therefore, bikes are not necessarily the *best* option for someone visiting Goma.



"
Imvume yokuhamba endawni engagadiwe mayelana nosuku lokuqala ngo-Agasti izotholakala nini?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngomhlaka-1 Januwari**.

Here's why:

The text states that backcountry permits are available on the 1st of the month, four months prior to the start of the month for which the permit is needed.  Since the permit is for August, the 1st of January is the date it becomes available.
"
Iyiphi inqubomgomo ekhona mayelana nokuvikela udonga olubangelwa umvula?,"The correct answer is **D: Kunamanani alinganiselwe ezimvume.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Imvume yasezintabeni yanoma iluphi usuku lokuqalisa ngoMeyi itholakala ngo-1 Jan."" This indicates a limited number of permits available.
* **It also states:** ""...kunenani elilinganiselwe lezimvume ezibekelwe izicelo zabafika kungahleliwe ezitholakala kulabo abafike kuqala."" This clearly indicates a limited quantity of permits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhlelo lokusiza ofike kuqala:** While being first might *help*, it's not the primary policy. The passage emphasizes limited permits.
* **B: Imvume itholakala kuphela ngomhlaka-1 Januwari:** This is incorrect. The passage says permits are available on the first day of each month, *four months* before the start of the month.
* **C: Imvume itholakala kuphela ngokuthi ungene ngenyawo uzoyicela:** The passage doesn't mention needing to apply in person.

Therefore, the best answer reflecting the policy described in the passage is that there's a limited number of permits available.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okungase kutholakale ohlotsheni lwehhotela elichazwe kule ndaba?,"The best answer is **C: Izivakashi ezaziwa kahle futhi eziqashelwayo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states these hotels were frequented by ""abacebile nabadumile"" (the wealthy and famous). This directly aligns with option C (""Izivakashi ezaziwa kahle futhi eziqashelwayo"" - well-known and exclusive guests).
* The passage also mentions a ""kuhla okuphambili nezenzakalo zasebusuku"" (a leading position and nightlife events), suggesting a certain level of exclusivity and social status.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Itafula elinotshwala (A bar table):** While hotels often have bars, the passage doesn't emphasize the presence of a bar table as a defining feature of these historic hotels.
* **B: Indawo yokudlela esesakhiweni yabantu abathanda ukudla (A dining room in the architectural style of people who like to eat):** The passage mentions luxury but doesn't particularly focus on the dining experience or architectural style related to food.
* **D: Amagumbi alungiswe ngezinto zesimanje (Rooms furnished with modern things):** The passage emphasizes *old* hotels and the contrasting ""wentuleka kwezakamuva"" (decay of the past), meaning the rooms would *not* be furnished with modern things.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate reflection of what you'd find in a hotel described in the passage.



"
"Ngokwalolu lwazi olulandelayo kule ndaba, yiziphi izinto ezinikezwayo lezo izivakashi zasehhotela ezingase zingakubheki njengokusemqoka?","The best answer is **A: Ifanisha yasendulo egcwele kuso sonke isakhiwo**. 

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the historical and aesthetic value of these hotels.** It mentions their ""old-fashioned ways of dressing, the remnants of past glory and the delightful way in which they grew."" This strongly suggests that the antique furniture is a key characteristic and a major draw for visitors interested in the hotels' historical significance.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Indawo yokudla enompheki ovelele:** While a good dining experience is important, the passage focuses more on the *atmosphere* and *history* of the hotels than the culinary offerings.
* **C: Indawo yokuphumula enomnandi basebusuku:** The passage mentions ""nightlife,"" but the overall tone is not primarily about partying. It's about experiencing a bygone era of elegance and history.
* **D: Amagumbi angabizi:** The passage explicitly states that these hotels were for the wealthy and often housed powerful figures. ""Affordable rooms"" are the *opposite* of what these hotels offered.



Therefore, the antique furniture aligns most closely with the passage's focus on the hotels' historical character and unique atmosphere.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engagwenya izivakashi lapho zivakashela iGreenland?","The correct answer is **D: Ukubhekisela kubantu baseGreenland ngokuthi “ama-Eskimo”**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nakuba ungezwa leli gama lisetshenziswa abantu Bendabuko baseZweni Eliluhlaza, kumelwe ligwenywe abantu bakwamanye amazwe."" This directly answers the question of what visitors should avoid doing.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Izindawo ezithile ezaziwa ngokuba namanani amakhulu obugebengu:** The passage states that ""nasemadolobheni, azikho “izindawo ezinodlame”"" (there are no ""dangerous areas"" in the cities).
* **B: Ukuza nezimpahla ezisindayo, njengoba izimo sezulu ngokuvamile sifudumele unyaka wonke:** The passage says the opposite - visitors should pack warm clothing, especially during snowy periods.
* **C: Ukulindela ukuthi uzosebenza ngenkathi ulapho, njengoba i-inthanethi itholakala kuphela ezindaweni ezithile:** The passage states that internet access is widespread.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini elandelayo engase ibe inkinga ngezivakashi ezingazilungiselele lapho zivakashela iGreenland?","The correct answer is **A: Omiyane be-Nordic**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions: ""Phakathi nehlobo, qapela omiyane base-Nordic. Nakuba bengadlulisi noma izifo, bangacasula."" (Among the winter, be careful of Nordic mosquitoes. Although they don't transmit diseases, they can bite.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ubugebengu** - The text states that ""ubugebengu kanye nokuphatha kabi abakwamanye amazwe ngokujwayelekile, kuyinto engaziwa e-Greenland."" (crime and bad behavior by foreigners are generally unknown in Greenland).
*   **C: Isimo sezulu** - While the text mentions the weather can be a factor, it focuses on dressing warmly for cold weather and the effects of long daylight hours.
*   **D: Abantu bendawo** - The text details that the people of Greenland are generally welcoming and that crime is rare.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo manje okusetshenziswa njengenkaba yezindawo zomphakathi edolobheni?,"The correct answer is **A: IJardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Manje isebenza njengesigcawu esiyinhloko edolobheni..."" which translates to ""Now it serves as the main square of the city...""  This directly refers to Jardín de la Unión. While the other locations are interesting, the text explicitly states Jardín de la Unión is the main square.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungatholakali eJardín de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: Izindawo ezimaphakathi zamatende ezinekhonsathi**.

Here's why:

* The text states that free concerts are *sometimes* offered from a main tent in the garden, but it doesn't say there are *permanent* or always-present public areas with tents for concerts.
* Options B, C, and D are all explicitly mentioned in the text.

Therefore, option A is the only thing *not* mentioned as being found in Jardín de la Unión.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende esilandelayo mayelana nosuku lokuqwala olubonakala lunganembile?","The correct answer is **A: Kuncane kakhulu ukulungiselela okudingekayo ngosuku lokuqwala endaweni ehambeka kalula.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ukuhamba emini emzileni olula kudinga ukuzilungiselela okuncane..."" (Hiking in easy trails requires little preparation...). Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Amabanga ayehluka, kodwa enzelwe ukuba ahambeke ngosuku olulodwa** - The passage says hikes can range from lower to higher elevations *within a single day*, but doesn't emphasize that the elevations *vary greatly*.
* **C: Abantu abanesimo esikahle sokufaneleka ngokomzimba ngokuvamile bayakujabulela okwenzekayo** - While the passage mentions people who are physically fit can enjoy it, it doesn't say this is *typically* the case. It just says they *can*.
* **D: Ukusuku lokuqwala alulona usuku okufanele lwangaphandle emndenini enabantwana** - The passage says families with young children *can* easily have a day out, implying it *is* a suitable outdoor activity for families.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kunini lapho usuku lokuqwala ludinga ukulungiselela okuncane?","The correct answer is **A: Uma oqwalayo ekulungele ngokomzimba**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ukuhamba emini emzileni olula kudinga ukuzilungiselela okuncane, futhi noma imuphi umuntu ophile kahle ngokomzimba angakujabulela."" (Hiking in a simple trail requires little preparation, and anyone in good physical condition can enjoy it.) This directly links good physical condition to needing less preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uma kuzohanjwa endaweni elula:** The passage states that a simple trail requires *little* preparation, not necessarily *no* preparation.
* **C: Lapho kuzohamba nezingane ziyoqwala:** While children might require more planning, the passage specifically mentions that families with young children *can* easily have a day out, suggesting it's not the *only* factor determining the level of preparation.
* **D: Uma ukuqwala kuzokwenziwa endaweni enemvelo:** Hiking in a natural environment is part of the definition of hiking, it doesn't directly relate to the amount of preparation needed.



"
Uyini umehluko ngamathafa aseRogaland noma e-Agder uma eqhathaniswa nawo wonke aseNorway?,"The correct answer is **D: Avame ukumbozwa izimbali eziphephuli (often covered in heather)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Rogaland and Agder are often called ""hei,"" which means open, treeless landscapes covered in heather.
* The other options are not mentioned in the text and contradict the description of ""hei.""

Therefore, the answer that best reflects the information provided is that the heide (open, treeless landscapes) in Rogaland and Agder are frequently covered in heather.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungeke kujwayeleke ngeNorway?","The correct answer is **C: Izindawo eziphakathi nezintaba ezikhuphukelayo (Places with high, steep mountains)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Norwegian landscapes are typically characterized by wide, open, treeless areas called ""vidde."" It further mentions that Rogaland and Agder are known for open, treeless heaths covered in heather. This contrasts with ""places with high, steep mountains,"" which are not mentioned as typical features of the Norwegian landscape described in the text.  The description emphasizes *openness* and *lack of trees*, not mountainous terrain.
"
Izivakashi ezithanda ukutshuza kufanele zisivakashele nini isiteshi esisegqumeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Phakathi nasebusika** (In winter).

The passage explicitly states: ""Inkathi yezivakashi ezindaweni zamagquma iyenyuka phakathi nehlobo laseNdiya. Nokho, zinenhlobo ehlukile yobuhle nokukhanga phakathi nobusika..."" (The tourist season in the mountainous regions peaks in the Indian summer. However, they have a different charm and appeal in winter...).  It then describes winter activities like snowshoeing and snowmobiling. Therefore, winter is the time tourists should visit if they enjoy snow-related activities.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kunini lapho kuvame ukuba khona nezivakashi eziningi esiteshini esisegqumeni?","The best answer is **A: Phakathi nalapho kunenqwaba yeqhwa** (When there is a lot of snow).

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states that visitors come to the snowy regions during winter for activities like snowshoeing and skiing.  The increase in visitors is linked to the presence of sufficient snow.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Phakathi naso sonke isikhathi sokuhamba eqhweni** (All the time during snow season): This is too broad. The passage indicates *increased* visits, not constant visits.
* **C: Phakathi nehlobo laseNdiya** (During the Indian winter): While the passage mentions the Indian winter, it focuses on the *snow* as the main draw.
* **D: Phakathi nazo zonke izinyanga zasebusika** (All the months of winter):  The passage implies that the peak of visitors occurs when there's abundant snow, not necessarily every single month of winter.



"
Yini okufanele uyigweme uma unethemba lokuthola isikebhe sidinga usizo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ukuba umngane nokaputeni (Being a friend to a beggar).**

Here's why:

The text emphasizes focusing on finding a ship in need of help. Beingfriend to a beggar is off-topic and detracts from the primary goal. The other options are relevant to the process:

*   **A: Lapho wehla wenyuka lapho zipaka khona (When you go up and down where ships are docked):** This is essential for finding opportunities.
*   **C: Uma ukhangisa ngezinkonzo ozenzayo (When you advertise the services you offer):** This is part of offering assistance and potentially finding a ship that needs specific skills.
*   **D: Ukugwema abantu abacela ukuhayikha isikembe (Avoiding people who ask for alms):** The goal is to help ships, not to give money directly to individuals. While compassion is good, it shouldn't distract from the main objective.

Therefore, beingfriend to a beggar isn't helpful and is a distraction from the core task of finding a ship needing assistance."
Yini okufanele uyenze eduzane nethekhu lesikebhe lapho ubheka isikebhe esidinga usizo?,"The correct answer is **B: Hlale usendaweni lapho ungabonakala khona.**

Here's why:

The prompt emphasizes interacting with people and looking for opportunities to help.  To be noticed and offered a task, you need to be visible and approachable near the ships. 

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Xhumana nomshayeli waso:** While eventually you might need to communicate with the captain, your immediate goal is to be *seen* by someone who needs help.
* **C: Iya kubantu kuphela lapho besahlanza izikebhe zabo:**  You should interact with anyone who needs assistance, not just those currently cleaning.
* **D: Gwema abacela ukuhayikha isikebhe:** You want to interact with *everyone* as they may need help.



"
Iyiphi indawo engabonakala ikhanga izivakashi ngomlando wamakholoni eziqhingini?,"The correct answer is **C: Edolobheni eliseHong Kong**.

The passage states: ""abenzi bamakoloni baseBrithani abayithatha njengendawo yabo ngakho uma ufuna ukubona ubufakazi besikhathi esedlule sobukoloni salendawo, lena indawo efanele ongaqala kuyo.""  This directly refers to Hong Kong Island as the place to see colonial relics.
"
Iyiphi indawo engakhanga izivakashi ebheka ukubukeka kwendawo njengokubalulekile?,"The correct answer is **C: Isiqhingi SaseHong Kong**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Isiqhingi saseHong Kong sinika indawo yaseHong Kong igama layo futhi yindawo leyo izivakashi eziningi eziyithatha njengendawo yokuvakashelwa eyinhloko."" (The Hong Kong Peninsula gives the place its name and is the place where many tourists take it as the main tourist destination.)

The passage also mentions that the Peninsula is where you can find evidence of the colonial history.  The question asks where visitors prioritize the *look* of a place.  The passage directly connects the Peninsula to being a major tourist destination and a place to see the ""look"" of Hong Kong.
"
Yini ezinye izinhlalo zamahhashi ezinakho ukusiza unciphise ukulimala konyawo lomgibeli lapho lubamnjwe umchilo?,"The correct answer is **B: Insimbi yokubambelela (Safety bar)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions that some saddles, particularly Western saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle horn to be secured to the saddle when the rider is thrown backward. This directly addresses the problem of the rider's foot getting trapped under the stirrup and potentially causing injury when the horse bolts.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Indawo yokufaka izinyawo lapho incane (Small foot placement):** This is not mentioned in the text as a safety feature. While foot placement is important for riding, the text doesn't associate a ""small foot placement"" with preventing injuries when the rider is thrown.
* **C: into yokunyathela eyisikhumba (Saddle horn):** The saddle horn itself isn't a safety feature designed to prevent foot injuries when a rider is thrown. It's primarily used for roping.
* **D: Ukuzinza okukhulu (Excessive grip):**  The text doesn't mention excessive grip as a safety feature related to foot injuries. A good rider maintains proper balance, but ""excessive grip"" isn't a recognized safety measure in this context.



"
Yisiphi isici esisiza unyawo lomgibeli ukuba andise amathuba okuphepha lapho esebenzisa into yokunyathela?,"The correct answer is **C: Isithende**.

Here's why:

The text states that many riders wear riding boots with a **cleated sole that is slippery**. This slippery sole is designed to help the rider *avoid* their foot getting caught in the stirrup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isoli ehayayo futhi encane (Non-slip and small sole):** While a non-slip sole is beneficial, the text specifically highlights the slipperiness of the sole as a safety feature.
* **B: Okuyisikhumba (The shell):** The shell is part of the stirrup, but it doesn't directly impact the rider's foot safety.
* **D: Isoli yonke (The entire sole):**  It's the slipperiness of the sole that's the key element.



"
Yini enikezwa izivakashi ngokuxhumana ngokushintshisana kwezihambi?,"The correct answer is **A: Izindawo zokuhlala bese kuba khona umuntu wendawo ozonakekela.**

The text states that the hospitality exchange network connects travelers with locals who offer them a place to stay. This means visitors receive accommodation and the hospitality of a local person. While options C might be *part* of the experience, the core offering is accommodation and a host. Options B and D aren't directly mentioned as a primary benefit.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana nokushintshana ngezokuxhumana okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Ukubukezwa kwabantu abamukelanayo bendawo ngezinye izikhathi kuyanikezwa abavakashi.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Uhlu lwababungazi abatholakalayolinikezwa ngokushicilelwa kanye/noma ku-inthanethi, kwesinye isikhathi nezinkomba kanye nokubuyekezwa kwabanye abahambi.""  This directly translates to ""A list of hosts is provided through publication and/or online, sometimes with reviews and recommendations from other travelers.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Abavakashi bahlale benikezwa ukusikiselwa ngabantu bendawo abamukelanayo:** The text doesn't say that *all* visitors are guaranteed accommodation.  It describes a system where hosts offer accommodation, but it's not a guarantee for everyone.
* **B: Abanye bangase badinge ukuqinisekisa okwengeziwe okuvela kwabazovakasha:** While host verification might occur, the text doesn't explicitly state that *some* hosts require extra verification from visitors.
* **C: Abavakashi bazonikezwa uhlu lwabantu abamukelanayo abakhona kuwo wonke amadolobha:** The text mentions a list of hosts, but it doesn't say the list covers *all* cities.

Therefore, option D is the only statement directly supported by the provided text.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwezivakashi olungase lutholakale luhlanganyele igumbi?","The correct answer is **A: Izivakashi ezineminyaka esekuqaleni kwamashumi amabili**.

The passage states that ""isivakashi esivamile siseminyakeni yamashumi amibili"". While older travelers can be found, the most common type is in their early twenties.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Isivakashi esihamba sodwa:** While possible, the passage doesn't emphasize solo travelers.
* **C: Isivakashi esihamba nezingane ezincane:** The passage mentions families are *not* common, and some hostels don't accommodate them.
* **D: Isivakashi esineminyaka ephakathi kwamashumi amathathu:** The passage states the *typical* visitor is in their early twenties.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase ahlale ehostela?","The correct answer is **B: Abantu abathathu abaneminyaka engu-22 abahamba ndawonye.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Amahostela ahlalisa abantu abasha ngokuyinhloko – isivakashi esivamile siseminyakeni yamashumi amibili..."" This indicates that people in their 20s are a typical hostel guest.
* **Option B** directly reflects this: ""Abantu abathathu abaneminyaka engu-22 abahamba ndawonye.""

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Umbhanqwana ohamba nosana:** While possible, the passage doesn't specifically mention this type of traveler.
* **C: Umbhanqwana oseminyakeni yabo-70:** The passage says hostels primarily cater to younger travelers. While older travelers *can* stay, it's not the primary demographic.
* **D: Imindeni emibili ehamba nezingane:** The passage states that families with children are *not* common in hostels, although some hostels may allow them.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende esikuchaza ngokunembile ukuphonswa kwe-boomerang?","The correct answer is **A: Ihlale ibuya kuwe esandleni uma uyiphonsi kahle (It will always return to you in your hand if you throw it well)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Uma ufuna ukufunda ukuphonsa ibhumerangi ebuyela esandleni sakho..."" (If you want to learn to throw a boomerang back to your hand...).  This implies that a properly thrown boomerang *does* return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ijwayeleke kakhulu kubantu bendawo kunezivakashi (It is much more common with locals than tourists):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the frequency of boomerang use by locals vs. tourists.
* **C: Aziziningi izindawo zokudlala iboomerang e-Australia (There are many boomerang throwing areas in Australia):** The passage doesn't mention designated throwing areas.
* **D: Amanye ama-boomerang avame ukubuya (Some boomerangs often return):** The passage specifically warns that many boomerangs found in Australia are *not* returning ones. It emphasizes the importance of getting a boomerang designed to return.

Therefore, option A is the only statement directly supported by the passage's main point."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okusetshenziswa kakhulu lapho kwenziwa uhlobo oluthile lokudla kwesiJavanese?,"The correct answer is **C: Ushukela kakhukhunathi (Coconut sugar)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...the staple ingredients for Javanese cuisine are rice, beans, sugar (especially **Java coconut sugar**)...""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isifo esithathelanayo sisakazeka kanjani?","The correct answer is **A: Abantu asebenaso isifo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isifo esithathelanayo isifo esidluliseka kalula ngokuba seduze nomuntu onalesosifo."" This directly translates to: ""Contagious diseases are easily transmitted by being close to someone who has the disease.""

While the other options are related to infectious diseases, the passage explicitly links the spread of contagious diseases to *people who have the disease*.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engaziwa njengebangela ukutheleleka kwesifo?","The correct answer is **B: Amagciwane**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isifo esithelelanayo sibangelwa amabhakithiliya adala izifo, njengegciwane, ibhakithiliya, isikhunta noma ezinye izilwane eziphila ngezinye.""  This means that the passage *does* mention bacteria (amabhakithiliya) as a cause of infectious diseases.

The question asks what is *not* mentioned as a cause of infectious disease. The options include:

*   **A: Ukugoma (Burns):** The passage doesn't mention burns as a cause of infectious diseases.
*   **B: Amagciwane (Viruses):** While the passage lists bacteria, it doesn't mention viruses as a cause.
*   **C: Amagciwane (Bacteria):** The passage *does* mention bacteria.
*   **D: Isikhunta (Parasites):** The passage mentions parasites as a cause of infectious diseases.

Therefore, the only option not specifically mentioned as a cause of infectious disease in the passage is viruses.

**So the answer is B.**



"
Kukusiphi isibonelo lapho ukukhetha khona iwebusayithi ezokumela esikhundleni sokusebenzisa iVPN kube okwanele kulabo abayisebenzisayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umuntu osebenzisayo ngokuyinhloko uchezukisa isiminyaminya se-http**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that VPNs are most effective at bypassing political censorship and geo-restrictions because they handle the entire internet traffic, not just HTTP.** This means they can encrypt and redirect *all* internet activity.
* **If someone *only* accesses HTTP websites, a simple proxy server (or even just a different IP address) might be sufficient.**  HTTP traffic is unencrypted, so changing the apparent IP address is often enough to circumvent basic restrictions.
* **Options A and B** relate to stronger security needs (masking all activity, avoiding surveillance) that VPNs are better suited for.
* **Option D** points to a need for high network performance, which might favor a direct connection or a VPN with optimized servers, not necessarily a simple proxy.



Therefore, if the user's primary goal is simply to access HTTP websites and the threat level isn't high, a proxy is adequate."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana namaVPN kanye newebusayithi ezokumelela okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Iwebusayithi engumsizi ayikwazi ukuchezukisa isiminyaminya.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states that VPNs (and by implication, better proxies) create an entire tunnel for internet traffic, not just HTTP.** This means they can handle all types of data, not just web traffic.
* **Web proxies, as described, don't have the same level of comprehensive traffic handling as VPNs.** Therefore, they are generally not capable of intercepting and modifying all types of data streams like VPNs can.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: IVPN imane nje ikunikeze amandla amaningi enethiwekhi kunewebusayithi engumsizi:** The text implies that VPNs are *better* than proxies, not just offering more power. The text highlights the superior traffic handling and privacy of VPNs.
* **C: Iwebusayithi engumsizi inekhwalithi ephansi yosizo uma uyiqhathanisa neVPN:** The text actually states that proxies *generally* offer a higher level of support than VPNs.
* **D: IVPN ingakwazi ukuchezukisa kuphela isiminyaminya se-http:** The text directly contradicts this, stating that VPNs handle traffic beyond just HTTP.



"
Yini evumela omunye umuntu ukuba asebenzise ucingo lwenkampani ngaphandle indawo yabo?,"The correct answer is **A: Izincingo ezisebenza nge-inthanethi** (Internet-based phones).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngenxa yokuthi izingcingo zixhunywa nge-Inthanethi, akumelwe usebenzise ifoni yenkampani esendaweni ohlala kuyo noma oyivakashele."" (Because phones are connected to the Internet, you don't have to use a company phone in the location where you live or visit.) This directly links internet connectivity to the ability to use a company phone remotely.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Inamba yakwelinye izwe** (A number in another country):  While getting a number in another country *can* allow others to call you, it doesn't fundamentally enable the use of a company phone *anywhere*.  It's just one way to obtain a phone number.
* **C: Isatellite** (Satellite): While satellite technology *can* enable communication, the passage focuses on the Internet as the enabling factor for remote phone usage.
* **D: Ucingo lwePSTN** (PSTN phone):  The passage mentions PSTN phones in the context of *incoming* calls, not the ability to *use* a company phone remotely.

Therefore, the key to using a company phone outside its location is the fact that it's an **Internet-based phone**.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yini okungase kudingeke ukuba yenziwe ukuze kutholakale izincingo ezithile?","The correct answer is **A: Thenga inombolo yocingo yomhlaba (Buy an international phone number)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kaningi, kufanele uthenge inombolo esebenza emhlabeni jikelele ngokuhlukile evumela amafoni we-PSTN ukuba akushayele."" (Often, you need to buy a globally-distinct phone number that allows PSTN phones to call you.)  This directly indicates that purchasing an international phone number is a solution to the problem described.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sebenzisa ucingo lwenkampani yendawo (Use a local company phone number):** The passage says *not* to use a company phone in a different location.
* **C: Thola inombolo emphakathini okuwo (Get a community number there):** The passage says there are no requirements to get a community number.
* **D: Thenga ucingo lwePSTN (Buy a PSTN number):** While mentioned, the passage says you need a *globally-distinct* number *allowing* PSTN calls.  Just buying a PSTN number isn't sufficient according to the text.

Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungakuchazi ngokunembile ukuphimisela amagama esiNtaliyani?,"The correct answer is **D: Ukuphimisela amagama amaningi kuyehluka kuyengohlamvu olulandelayo**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that pronunciation *does* change based on the following letter.** It says, ""...ukuziphimisela kuhluka ngokusekelwe kunkamisa olandelayo."" This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: O-rr ababili babizwa ngenye indlela kunokubiza u-r oyedwa:** This is stated directly in the passage: ""Qiniseka ukuthi ubiza uhlamvu u-r kanye nezinhlamvu u-rr ngokuhlukile...""
* **B: Amagama amaningi abizwa ngale ndlela asuke ebhalwe ngayo:** This is also mentioned in the passage: ""Ukuphimisela cishe kulula ngesiNtaliyane njengoba amagama amaningi aphinyiselwa ngedlela efanayo nabhalwe ngedlela efanayo...""
* **C: Amagama anohlamvu u-c kanye no-g angase adide:** This is also mentioned: ""...okumelwe uziqaphele u-c no-g, njengoba ukuziphimisela kuhluka ngokusekelwe kunkamisa olandelayo.""



Therefore, only option D is definitively *not* stated or implied in the passage."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo kwe-Izmir okwaba khona ngaphambi kwezinsuku zanamuhla?,"The correct answer is **D: Uphahla olungokwesiko olubomvu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...umphahla olungokwesiko olubomvu, imakethe yangekhulu lama-18 leminyaka..."".  This indicates the red-domed roof was present *before* the city's modern development. The other options are described as part of the *current* city.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungayichazi ngokunembile i-Izmir?,"The correct answer is **B: Isimo sendawo sibonakalisa amasiko aseTurkey**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states that Izmir has a mix of European and Mediterranean influences, *not* primarily Turkish cultural influences.** While it *is* in Turkey, the description emphasizes its European vibe.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Idolobha elizungezwe indawo enkulu:** The text says it's surrounded by mountains.
* **C: Ungathola kokubili isikhungo sokuthenga sesimanje kanye namasonto amadala:** The text mentions modern glass buildings *and* a 18th-century market and temples.
* **D: Kunetheku lesibili ngobukhulu eTurkey:** The text clearly states that it's the third largest city in Turkey.



Therefore, option B is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text."
Igama elithi hanami libhekisela ekubukeni ini?,"The correct answer is **A: Uhlobo oluthile lwamafulawa aqhakazayo**.

The passage states: ""Ukubuka ama-cherry eqhakaza, okwaziwa ngokuthi i-hanami..."" and then goes on to describe the tradition of viewing cherry blossoms. ""Hanami"" refers to the act of viewing the cherry blossoms.
"
Ubani owenza umcimbi wokuqala onikelelwe ekubukeni izimbali eziqhakazayo?,"The correct answer is **C: Umbusi waseJapan**.

The text states: ""EJapani, imicimbi yokuqala yokuqhakaza kwama-cherry yabungazwa umbusi eyibungazela yena kuphela namanye amalungu ohlobo lobukhosi lwasezweni Esigodlweni saseBukhosini."" This translates to: ""In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing events were reserved for the emperor and other members of the imperial family.""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isici esilandelayo ngeJerusalema esingeke sibakhange kakhulu abantu abavakashile?","The correct answer is **A: Ukubaluleka kwedolobha ngokwenkolo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Jerusalem is holy to three major religions (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam) and is a spiritual, religious, and cultural center.  While the other options are true about Jerusalem, the passage emphasizes its religious significance *most strongly*. The question asks what visitors *might not* encounter as much. Since the passage dedicates a significant portion to its religious importance, it's less likely that a visitor would *not* encounter it.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Idumela layo njengenhloko dolobha yase-Israel:**  The passage confirms this is a well-known fact.
* **C: Lokho elikunikezayo ngokwamasiko:** The passage mentions cultural sites, markets, cafes, and restaurants, suggesting visitors *will* encounter its cultural offerings.
* **D: Izindawo eziningi ezingokomlando:** The passage highlights the many historical sites, indicating visitors *will* see them.



Therefore, the religious significance is the most prominent aspect of Jerusalem emphasized in the text, and it's unlikely visitors would *not* encounter it.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungabaliwe endabeni njengento iJerusalema elaziwa ngako?,"The correct answer is **B: Ithonya lakhona kwezepolitiki (The resurgence of political tensions)**.

Here's why:

* The passage focuses on Jerusalem's historical and religious significance. It highlights its importance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, its ancient history, and its role as a center of pilgrimage and culture.
* While political tensions *do* exist in Jerusalem, the passage *doesn't* mention them. The emphasis is on its historical and religious aspects, not the current political climate.
* Options A, C, and D *are* mentioned in the passage as contributing to Jerusalem's renown:
    * **A: Ulamndo wakhona omangalisayo (Its amazing history)** - Directly stated.
    * **C: Ukubaluleka kwakhona kwezenkolo (Its religious importance)** - Directly stated.
    * **D: Izindawo zamasiko (Its cultural sites)** - Directly stated.



Therefore, the resurgence of political tensions is the only option not mentioned in the passage."
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwezivakashi ezingeke zizuze ekuthengeni i-Wild Card?","The correct answer is **A: Isivakashi esihlele ukuvakashela izindawo zaseSANParks eziningi kangangokunokwenzeka.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""kunamanani okuhlanga ngaphakathi usuku ngalunye kanye namanani okungena wepaki. Ingabe kuzuzise ukuba umuntu athenge iWild Card, elimvumela ukungena kwelinye lamapaki okungakhethwa kuwo waseNingizimu Afrika noma wonke amaPaki Wezwe waseNingizimu Afrika.""
* **Wild Card's Benefit:** The Wild Card allows entry to *multiple* SANParks locations or *all* of them.
* **Option A aligns with this benefit:**  A visitor planning to visit many SANParks locations would maximize the value of the Wild Card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isivakashi esivakashele kuphela iKruger National Park:**  While a Wild Card *covers* Kruger, the visitor wouldn't be getting the most value out of it if they only visit one park.
* **C: Isivakashi esinebhajethi esikhathazeke ngemali yasepaki:**  The Wild Card is designed to *help* with budgeting for park fees, not discourage it.
* **D: Isivakashi esihlele ukuvakashela iKruger National Park kanye nenye ipaki:** This visitor *would* benefit from a Wild Card, as it covers both parks.



"
Isiphi isitatimende esingayichazi ngokunembile iKruger National Park?,"The correct answer is **C: IKruger National Park yaseNingizimu Afrika ingenane kunazo zonke.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Kruger National Park is ""ingenye yezindawo ezivakashelwa kakhulu eNingizimu Afrika"" (one of the most visited places in South Africa).  This directly contradicts the statement that it *doesn't* have them all.
* A is true, as mentioned in the passage.
* B is true, as mentioned in the passage.
* D is true, as mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, option C is the statement that cannot be accurately inferred from the passage.
"
Ikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kubangele ubungozi ngokuqwala indawo ephakeme yentaba?,"The correct answer is **A: Izimo zezulu lapho indawo imanzi (Weather conditions when the area is wet)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Kunomhume omncane eduze nesiqongo okumelwe kudlulwe kuwo, usezansi kakhulu futhi uminyene. Kunomoya omnandi, futhi uziqaphele ezingxenyeni ezehlelayo, ikakhulukazi lapho kumanzi, njengoba kungaba yingozi ngokushesha."" (There is a small puddle near a gate that needs to be passed through, very low and slippery. There is a slight breeze, and be aware of the slippery sections, especially where it's wet, as it can be dangerous quickly.)

This directly points to wet conditions creating a slippery surface and therefore a danger. The other options are less directly linked to the immediate danger mentioned in the passage.



"
Yisiphi isitatimende esingakuvezi ngokunembile ukunyuka kwentaba yaseMachu Picchu njengoba kuchazwe endabeni?,"The correct answer is **A: Ngisho nabaqwali abanesimo somzimba esihle bengaphelelwa umoya (Even those with good physical condition may get winded)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kunomhume omncane eduze nesiqongo okumelwe kudlulwe kuwo, usezansi kakhulu futhi uminyene. Kunomhume omncane eduze nesiqongo okumelwe kudlulwe kuwo, usezansi kakhulu futhi uminyene. Lindela ukuphelelwa umoya..."" This directly indicates that even people in good shape *will* get winded.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage says there *are* handrails in the steeper sections.
* **Option C is correct:** The passage mentions crossing a narrow passage.
* **Option D is correct:** The passage warns of the danger of the path when wet.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that *cannot* be accurately inferred from the passage. It goes against the direct information provided."
"Ngokwendaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungesona isisekelo ekudleni kwamaMajorican?","The correct answer is **A: Inyama**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Majorcan cuisine is *based on fish, meat (especially rabbit), and vegetables*. While meat is *part* of the cuisine, the text highlights fish and vegetables as the primary foundations. Therefore, meat is not the *most* fundamental component.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende mayelana nokudla kwehangi okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Ihangi isebenzisa amatshe ashisayo ayatholakala eWellington.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""UmGodi ushiswa ngamatshe ashisayo avela emlilweni, noma kwezinye izindawo ukushisa okuvela ngaphansi komhlaba kwenze izingxenye zenhlabathi zishise ngokwemvelo."" (The hot springs are heated by hot stones from the fire, or other heat sources from underground that cause parts of the earth to heat up naturally.)  This indicates hot stones are used, but it *doesn't* specify that they are found in Wellington.
* **The passage mentions:** ""Izindawo ezimbalwa e-Rotorua zinikela ngokudla okuphekwe ngokushisa komhlaba..."" (Several places in Rotorua offer geothermal cooked food...). This confirms the use of hot stones in geothermal cooking.
* **The passage states:** ""I-hangi kaningi isetshenziselwa ukupheka ukudla kwakusihla okuthosiwe okungokwesiko."" (Hangi is often used to cook traditional slow-cooked food.) This confirms that hangi is used for cooking.
* **The passage states:** ""Amatshe ashisayo ihangi ayatholakala eRotorua"" (The hot stones used in hangi are found in Rotorua). This confirms the use of hot stones in hangi and that they are found in Rotorua.

Therefore, the statement that hangi uses hot stones found in Wellington is not supported by the text.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kubalwe njengendlela ejwayelekile yokushisisa umgodi ihangi?,"The correct answer is **A: Igesi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that hangi is cooked using:

*   **Hot stones from a fire**
*   **Heat from underground sources**

These are traditional methods.  Gas is a modern cooking method and not associated with the traditional hangi process.  Option B, C, and D all refer to methods mentioned in the text for creating the heat needed for hangi.
"
Yini engaphumela ekuqashelweni ama-monk noma ama-nun?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukugqoka into egqamile yokuzimboza.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lapho bevakashela amamonasteli, abesifazane kudingeka bagqoke iziketi ezemboza amadolo futhi bamboze namahlombe wabo. Amamonasteli amaningi anezembozo zabesifazane abeza bangalungile, kodwa uma uza nesakho, ikakhulukazi esinemibala ekhanyayo, ungamomothekelwa indela lowesilisa noma elesifazane esangeweni.""

This means bright or colorful robes can be problematic. Options B, C, and D are all generally acceptable practices.
"
Yiziphi izingubo ezingase zingabi khona ukuze zibolekwe endlini yezindela? ,"The correct answer is **A: Iziketi**.

The passage specifically mentions that women need to wear skirts that cover their knees and hips when visiting monasteries, and that monasteries often provide skirts for women. It also states that if you bring your own skirt, especially one with light colors, it might not be suitable as it could be mistaken for men's clothing. 

The passage mentions that men must wear trousers that cover their knees, and that these can be rented at the entrance. 

Therefore, skirts are explicitly mentioned as an item of clothing required for women when visiting monasteries.
"
Kunini lapho isivakashi singaba khona namathuba amaningi okubuka izinkanyezi njengoba zivakashele izindawo yaseAtarctic?,"The correct answer is **C: Phakathi nezinyanga zasebusika**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that in the Arctic and Antarctic during winter, the sun doesn't rise for over 24 hours, creating long periods of darkness. This is the ideal condition for stargazing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Phakathi nezinyanga zasehlobo:**  The passage describes winter as the time with prolonged darkness, not summer.
* **B: Lapho indawo ingenabo abantu abaningi:** While less light pollution is good for stargazing, it's not the primary reason for the long periods of darkness mentioned in the passage.  The passage highlights the sun's absence.
* **D: Lapho amazinga alula okugcola ephansi:**  The passage doesn't mention the ease of camping; it focuses on the availability of darkness for stargazing.



"
Kunini lapho kungekona ukuhlakanipha ukusebenzisa ucingo lwesatellite kuneselula?,"The correct answer is **A: Lapho ulayini wesatellite ungase uvimbeke khona.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ifoni ye-satellite ngokuvamile ayithatheli ifoni ephathwayo indawo, njengoba didingeka ube ngaphandle uqondene nesiphuphutheki ukuze ushaye ucingo."" This means satellite phones require a clear line of sight to a satellite.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uma indawo iceze kakhulu:** While a remote location is *where* a satellite phone is needed, it's not the *reason* you wouldn't use it over a cellular phone.  Cellular service also doesn't exist in remote locations.
* **C: Uma izosetshenziswa ngaphandle:**  The passage explicitly mentions satellite phones are for use *where cellular isn't available*.
* **D: Lapho uhambo luzodinga nibe nedata ethile:** Satellite phones *can* be used for data, as the passage states, ""Isevisi isetshenziswa kaningi yimikhumbi, kubandakanya umsebenzi wobungcweti, kanye nohambo olunezidingo zedatha nezwi elikude.""  Cellular phones are also used for data.



Therefore, the main reason you wouldn't choose a satellite phone over cellular is if the satellite line of sight is blocked.



"
Lungafiseleka nini ucingo lwesatellite ukwedlula iselula?,"The correct answer is **B: Phakathi nokuhamba ngesikebhe**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that satellite phones are often used by ships and for travel where cellular coverage is unavailable. This directly aligns with the scenario of traveling by sea (a ship).
* Option A is incorrect because the passage highlights that satellite phones are *needed* when cellular networks aren't available, which is often the case *outside* of cities.
* Option C is incorrect because the entire point of a satellite phone is to provide communication *without* data networks.
* Option D is incorrect because the passage clearly states that satellite phones are *used* when cellular networks are *not* available.



"
Izinxabano ezilandelayo zobani ezaholela ekusungulweni iTransnistria Republic?,"The correct answer is **B: Ubuzwe (Politics)**.

The text explicitly states that the Transnistria Republic was established as a result of a political split and the formation of a separatist region. The mention of the breakaway republic, its government, and its lack of UN recognition all point to a political conflict. While economic issues might have contributed, the core driver was political. The text mentions ""political disputes"" (zinxoxweni zepolitiki) hindering economic reintegration."
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo iTransnistria Republic enakho kodwa okuhlukile kunendawo yonke yaseMaldova?  ,"The correct answer is **C: Ukuqashelwa yi-UN**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Transnistria is not recognized by any UN member state.
* The text mentions that Transnistria has its own government and currency.
* While the language might be similar, it's not stated as a distinguishing factor.
* The text doesn't provide information about religious differences.

Therefore, the inability to be recognized by the UN is the unique characteristic of Transnistria mentioned in the passage.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isivakashi kufanele siyivakashele nini indawo yaseMontevideo uma sinethemba lokugwema izimo zezulu ezinomoya?","The correct answer is **B: Phakathi nesikhathi esomile saseMontevideo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that rainfall is fairly consistent throughout the year in Montevideo.
* It also mentions that while the winter can be cold (sometimes with frost), the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder.
*  The question asks when to avoid *windy* weather. The passage doesn't explicitly say the winter is windless, but the emphasis is on the cold and dampness. The phrase ""sikhathi esomile"" implies a drier time, which is more likely to be less windy than a period with consistent rainfall. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Phakathi nezinyanga zasebusika ZaseNyakatho Yezwe:** This is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that Montevideo's winter is cold, but it doesn't say it's more windy than other times.
* **C: Phakathi nezinyanga zasehlobo ZaseNyakatho Yezwe:**  This is incorrect because the passage says Montevideo's summer is very hot (above +30°C), making it unlikely to be a good time to avoid ""windy weather"".
* **D: Phakathi nezinyanga zaseMontevideo zasebusika:** This is incorrect because the passage describes Montevideo's winter as cold *and* damp, not necessarily windy.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isivakashi kufanele sivakashele indawo yaseMontevideo uma zincamela izimo sezulu esipholile?","The correct answer is **A: Lapho kuyisehlobo eMontevideo**.

Here's why:

* The text states that in the summer months in Montevideo, temperatures often exceed +30°C.
* The question asks when a visitor should visit for ""pleasant weather"".
* Summer is generally considered the time of year with the most comfortable temperatures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Uma kuyisehlobo Enyakatho Yezwe:** This is irrelevant to Montevideo's climate.
* **C: Uma kuyisikhathi sezimvula eMontevideo:** The text mentions that rainfall is consistent throughout the year, so this wouldn't guarantee pleasant weather.
* **D: Uma kuyisebusika Enyakatho Yezwe:** This is also irrelevant to Montevideo's climate."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungahlotshaniswa nokumiswa kwabadweba izindonga, kunokuthi bacekela phansi indawo?","The correct answer is **A: Lapho kunemicimbi yokudweba**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kulezi zinsuku kunezingcweti ze-graffiti ezizimele, izenzakalo ze-graffiti kanye nezindonga """"ezingokomthetho""""."" This indicates that there are organized events (like festivals or competitions) where graffiti artists can legally create art.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kube nezitolo:** The passage doesn't mention stores.
* **C: Ukungavumeleki kwemidwebo ezindaweni zomphakathi:** While this is a reason graffiti *is* often frowned upon, the passage discusses professional and legal graffiti, implying that it's not *always* unwelcome.
* **D: Omaka abangafundeki:** This is not directly related to the activities of graffiti artists.

Therefore, the statement about events where graffiti is created legally aligns most directly with the passage's discussion of professional and legal graffiti practices."
Yisiphi isici somculo abanye ababa khona kuwo abakubheka njengengxenye ebalulekile kulokho okusuke kwenzeka?,"The correct answer is **C: Umculo odlala kuze kube sebusuku.**

The paragraph states: ""Uma ufuna ukubona okwenzekayo useduze kuzomelwe ufike masinya ukuze uthole indawo yokukamisa eduze nomculo. Khumbula ukuthi nakuba umculo osesiteji esiyinhloko ungaphela, kungaba nezingxenye zomkhosi ezizoqhubeka zidlala umculo kuze kube sebusuku kakhulu.""  This indicates that the music playing late into the night is a key part of the festival experience that many attendees want to be close to.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuletha ingane yakho:** While some festivals have family areas, the paragraph doesn't highlight this as a core reason people want to be close to the music.
* **B: Ukukhempa endaweni:** Camping is a logistical aspect, not directly tied to wanting to be near the music.
* **D: Ukufika kusasenesikhathi:** Arriving early is about securing a good spot, but the core desire is to be close to the music.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini okufanele bayibheke njengebalulekile abafika kule micimbi uma befuna ukukhempa eduzane nalapho kudlalwa khona umculo?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlala kuze kube sebusuku**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ngokuba umculo osesiteji esiyinhloko ungaphela, kungaba nezingxenye zomkhosi ezizoqhubeka zidlala umculo kuze kube sebusuku kakhulu."" (Even though the main stage music ends, there may be parts of the festival that continue playing music until very late at night.)
* The question asks what's important for people wanting to camp *near* the music.  Staying until late allows them to enjoy the music as it continues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuhlala endaweni eseduze nemindeni:** The text mentions family camping areas, but it doesn't say that's a priority for everyone wanting to be near the music.
* **C: Ukukhempa ngaphandle kwendawo:** The text doesn't mention camping outside designated areas, nor does it imply it's necessary.
* **D: Ukufika kusasenesikhathi:** Arriving early is helpful, but it doesn't directly address the need to be near the music for the duration of the festival.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi izivakashi okufanele zikugweme lapho zifuna indawo enobumnandi enyakatho neNew Mexico?","The correct answer is **B: Izindawo zokuphuza edolobheni elincane.**

The passage explicitly states: ""izindawo zokuthiba ukoma zedolobha ezincanezalapha azihlali ziyizindawo ezilungele zivakashi ezivela ngaphandle kwesifundazwe ukuthi zingazipholela kuzo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pueblos:** The passage doesn't mention pueblos as places to avoid.
* **C: Indawo enenxakathela yezitolo:** The passage doesn't mention shopping areas at all.
* **D: Indawo yokugembula:** The passage mentions that most listed gambling locations sell alcohol, and some offer entertainment. It doesn't say to avoid gambling locations entirely.

Therefore, the only place the passage warns visitors to avoid is small-town drinking establishments.
"
"Ngokwa lendaba, kukuphi lapho emaningi amathuba okuba isivakashi sithole khona indawo eyaziwayo yobumnandi enyakatho neNew Mexico?","The correct answer is **C: Endaweni yokugembula eseduze neSante Fe.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that most listed places to gamble sell alcohol, and many offer a certain type of entertainment (often linked to Albuquerque and Santa Fe).
* It also mentions that the northern part of New Mexico has a problem with drunk drivers, and many drunk drivers are found near bars.
* The passage specifically says you'd need to go to Albuquerque or Santa Fe to find out what's happening at night.
* Therefore, a gambling establishment near Santa Fe would be a likely place to find a known entertainment spot in northern New Mexico.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Endaweni yokugembula engamahora amabili uma usuka e-Albuquerque:** While gambling places exist near Albuquerque, the passage doesn't pinpoint a specific one as being *the* place for northern New Mexico entertainment.
* **B: Endaweni yase-pueblo ecezile:** The passage doesn't mention pueblos as places for entertainment.
* **D: Izindawo zokucisha ukoma edolobheni elincane:** The passage explicitly states that small-town bars are *not* suitable for out-of-state visitors due to the drunk driving problem.



"
Izivakashi ezikhathazeke ngemali ezizoyisebenzisa zingase zifune ukugwema luphi uhlobo lweziphuzo?,"The correct answer is **D: Ijusi yezithelo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Iziphuzo ezenziwe ngezithelo ziyabiza kodwa zikahle kakhulu."" This translates to ""Fruit-based drinks are expensive but very good.""  Since the question asks what visitors on a budget should avoid, and fruit drinks are described as expensive, the answer is D.
"
"Ngokwale ndawo echazwe kule ndaba, yibuphi utshwala obungase buphambaniswe umuntu odayisayo?","The correct answer is **C: I-Sauvignon Blanc yaseNew Zealand**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kubantu base-Australia, umcabango wekhofi 'elinobisi oluthunqiswe ngomusi' awujwayelekile. Inkomishi encane 'yi-espresso', i-cappuccino iza igcwele ukhilimu ophezulu (hhayi ugwebu), futhi itiye liphuzwa ngaphandle kobisi.""  This tells us Australians might not be familiar with certain coffee drinks.
* The passage then continues: ""Amanzi asempompini yomphakathi aphephe ngokuphelele ukuthi aphuzwe, kodwa amanzi athengwayo atholakala kalula uma unokwesaba."" This implies a distinction between tap water and bottled water.
* Finally, it says: ""Iziphuzo ezenziwe ngezithelo ziyabiza kodwa zikahle kakhulu.""  This suggests fruit-based drinks are available and appreciated.
* **The passage explicitly states that New Zealand and Australian wines go down better than wines from other regions.**  Specifically, it mentions ""C: I-Sauvignon Blanc yaseNew Zealand"" as a wine that would be a good option to compare for someone who is selling drinks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: I-short black:** While mentioned, the passage doesn't directly link it to a beverage someone might be comparing.
* **B: I-Number One:** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: I-Flat White:** The passage discusses coffee preferences in Australia, but doesn't specifically say the Flat White is an option for comparison.

"Njengoba lahlala amakhulu weminyaka amathathu, isikhathi samakholoni saqalwa yiliphi iqembu?","The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

The passage states: ""Ngekhulu lama-16 leminyaka iParaguay, ngaphambili eyayibizwa ngokuthi """"Isifundazwe Esikhulukazi sama-Indie"""", yaba khona ngenxa yokuhlangana kwabanqobi baseSpeyini namaqembu abantu bomdabu ngokuzalwa."" (In the 16th century, before being called ""The Principality of the Indies"", Paraguay came into being due to the merging of Spanish conquerors and indigenous tribes.) This clearly indicates that the Spanish started the colonial period.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indlela enhle kakhulu yokwenza umuntu waseFrance afudumale?","The best answer is **C: Ukuba nenhlonipho (To be respectful)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes ""sephata kahle"" (to behave well) and being ""bien élevé"" (well-bred).  This points to proper etiquette and manners being highly valued. Respect is a core component of good manners and is essential to fitting in and being perceived positively.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the *best* fit:

* **A: Ukuzama ukulingisa isimo sengqondo somuntu waseFrance (Trying to imitate the mindset of a Frenchman):** While understanding the mindset might be helpful, the text focuses on outward behavior rather than internal thought processes.
* **B: Ukubonisa ukuzethemba (To show confidence):** Confidence is good, but not the central theme of the passage.  The passage focuses on conforming to social norms.
* **D: Ukubonisa isimo sokuthanda ukuxhumana nabantu (To show a desire to socialize):**  While being sociable is generally appreciated, the passage emphasizes proper *behavior* more than social interaction itself.

Therefore, **respect (Nhlonipho)** is the most directly relevant and crucial element for a positive impression based on the passage."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuyinto eshiwo abanye enganembile ngabantu basePherisi?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuba luhlaza**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Abantu basePherisi banedumela lokuqhosha, **ukuba luhlaza** nokuzidla."" This translates to ""People of Paris have a reputation for being snobbish, **being green** and being self-absorbed.""

Therefore, ""ukuba luhlaza"" (being green) is the characteristic the passage identifies as a false reputation about Parisians.
"
Iyiphi inzuzo yokugibela iFirst Class kuyiMetroRail yaseKapa?,"The correct answer is **C: Lishibhe kancane kunethikithi leThird Class**.

The text states: ""iMetroPlus inethezeke kakhudlwana futhi ayigcwali abantu kodwa ibiza kakhudlwana..."" This directly translates to ""MetroPlus is more comfortable and not crowded but costs more...""

Therefore, the benefit of riding First Class (MetroPlus) is that it's less crowded than the standard (Metro) option, even though it's more expensive.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini ekhona ezitimeleni zaseKapa ezithatha abantu abasebenzayo?","The correct answer is **A: Igumbi leMetro aligcwali kakhulu** (The Metro car is not crowded).

Here's why:

* The passage states that **MetroPlus (First Class)** is less crowded than Metro (Third Class), *even though* it's more expensive. 
* Option A directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ithikithi elifanayo lamakilasi womabili** (The ticket is the same for both classes) - The passage explicitly says the tickets are different prices.
* **C: Amakilasi amathathu angefani** (Three unequal classes) - The passage mentions two classes (MetroPlus and Metro), not three.
* **D: Amagumbi womabili eFirst Class neThird Class** (Both First Class and Third Class cars) - The passage states that all trains have *both* MetroPlus and Metro cars, but it doesn't say both are equally present. It implies the MetroPlus cars are more common.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo amagciwane ezilwane okungabonakali ukuthi engakwenza?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukubangela amashashaza**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that some animal diseases *can* cause illness, spread disease, and even be deadly.
* The question asks what animal pathogens *cannot* do.
* **The passage doesn't mention anything about animal pathogens causing seizures.** It focuses on illness, spreading disease, and causing injury.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ukuvukelwa yizigulo ezingakuphathi kahle:**  The passage mentions disease spread, which is related to uncontrolled illness.
* **C: Ukusabalala kokutheleleka:** The passage explicitly states that animals *can* spread disease.
* **D: Ukubangela ukulimala:** The passage mentions dangerous animals that can injure or kill.



Therefore, the only option not supported by the information in the passage is causing seizures."
Engathengwa kuphi amakhadi okufona akhokhelwayo?,"The best answer is **C: Ezitolo ezisemakhoneni (Convenience stores)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions ""izitolo ezincane"" (small shops) being a common place to find these cards.** Convenience stores fit this description.
* **The passage specifically states these cards are available for prepaid phone credit usable on social media or regular calls.** Convenience stores are known to sell prepaid phone cards.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Emazweni aqondile (Directly in countries):** This is too vague. It doesn't specify *where* in a country.
* **B: Emahhovisini ezitimela (Train stations):** While possible, train stations aren't the primary place for buying prepaid phone cards.
* **D: Endaweni okukhokhelwa kuyo amafoni (Where phones are paid for):** This is a very general answer and doesn't specify *what* is being paid for.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the text.
"
Yiziphi ezinye izinzuzo ezingcono ezinikezwa kulamakhadi?,"The best answer is **A: Ungakwazi ukulisebenzisa emazweni aqondile**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""...amanye enzelwe ukunikeza amanani aphansi wokufona emaqenjini athile wamazwe."" This directly implies that a key benefit is the ability to use the cards in specific countries.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ngokusebenzisa inombolo yamahhala:** While some cards might include a toll-free number, the primary benefit highlighted in the prompt is the international usage.
* **C: Ezitolo ezisemakhoneni:** The prompt mentions these cards are sold in small stores, but this is about *where* to buy them, not a benefit of the cards themselves.
* **D: Ngokusebenzisa ifoni ekhokhelwayo nokukhokhela izindleko ezengeziwe:**  This is the *opposite* of a benefit. The whole point is to avoid expensive phone charges.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of a key benefit of these prepaid phone cards.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yiziphi izihlahla ezilandelayo ayivamile kwipaki ezilwane ePlitvice Lakes?","The correct answer is **B: Isihlahla se-okhi**.

The text explicitly states that beech, spruce, and fir trees are *prominent* in Plitvice Lakes.  Therefore, oak is *not* mentioned as a prominent or common tree, implying it is less common.
"
Iziphi izilwane ezingandile ezilandelayo ongazithola esiqiwini esisePlitvice Lakes?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The text explicitly states: ""ngenxa yokwahluka kwesimo sezilu sayo esikahle, umhlabathi ongafani kanye namazinga okuphakama ahlukile. Lendawo ibuye ibe yikhaya lezinhlobo ezingi zezilwane kanye nezinyoni. Izilwane eziyivelakancane ezinjengebhere elinsundu laseYurophu, impisi efana nenketshane, ukhozi, isikhova, indabushe, ikati lasendle kanye ne-capercaillie zingatholakala lapho, kanye nezinye izinhlobo ezivamile.""

Therefore, the Capercaillie is listed as a bird found in Plitvice Lakes. The other options are not mentioned."
"Ngokwale ndaba, amakhodi esifunda asiza ngani kahle kahle?","The correct answer is **A: Ukukopisha idisk**.

The passage states that the code doesn't actually prevent illegal copying. It only makes the disk harder to play on different devices, but a bit-by-bit copy would still work. Therefore, the code's primary effect is related to copying the disk.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Ukuqondisa ezokudayisa:** The passage focuses on the code's impact on copying, not sales.
* **C: Ukugwema ukukopisha ngokungafanele:** The passage explicitly says the code doesn't prevent illegal copying.
* **D: Ukukopisha okungekho emthethweni:**  The passage argues that the code *doesn't* effectively stop illegal copying.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi okulandelayo okungamanga ngokuphathelene namakhodi esifundsa abhebhezelwa izinkampani zabezindaba?","The correct answer is **C: Kuyasiza ekutholeni imali eningi.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Injongo yangempela ukwenza lezo zinkampani zilawule kakhudlwana izimakethe zazo; konke kumayelana nokwenza inzuzo."" (The real purpose is for these companies to control their markets more closely; it's all about making profit.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuyadingeka ukuze kutholakale ukuqondisa okukhulu kokudayisa:** While controlling markets *can* lead to increased sales, the passage doesn't directly link the codes to *facilitating* sales.  The primary motive is profit, not necessarily driving sales.
* **B: Kusiza ekugwemeni ukukopisha okungemthetho:** The passage directly refutes this, saying the codes don't prevent illegal copying.
* **D: Kukancane kusize ekugwemeni ukophophisha ngokungafanele:**  Similar to B, the passage states the codes are ineffective against illegal copying.

Therefore, only option C aligns with the passage's main point about the companies' motivation: to make money."
"Lapho ufika nedaweni yakini, iyiphi inqubo ngokujwayelekile engekho ngokomthetho?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuhlolwa kwabantu abathuthela kwelinye izwe**.

Here's why:

The question asks about a typical, legal process upon arrival in a new country.  The initial paragraph describes the process of being checked upon arrival.  Option A directly reflects this process.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Izinto oziphethe okufanele uziveze:** While true, this is a component *of* the process, not the entire process itself.
*   **C: Inani elikaliwe lezinto okufanele uziphathe ngokomthetho:** This relates to customs and duty, a related but different aspect of arrival.
*   **D: Isikhungo esiqondisa abafikayo:** This is true (e.g., immigration authorities), but not the *process* itself.

Therefore, the most encompassing and accurate answer is **A**.
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okufanele ukwazi ngaphambi kokuba ufike ezweni lakini?,"The correct answer is **B: Uma kudingeka uveze ezinye izinto oziphethe ukubheka ukuthi azeqile yini enanini elingokomthetho.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes knowing what you are *not* allowed to bring.**  Option B directly addresses this by saying you need to know what possessions need to be declared to ensure they are legal.
* While knowing the location of the inspection (A) and the immigration office (C) might be helpful, the *most crucial* piece of information is what you need to declare.
* Option D (""that there are illegal things"") is too broad.  You need to know *what specific things* are illegal.

Therefore, knowing what you need to declare is the most important thing to know *before* arriving in a new country to avoid problems.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubuningi bani obuvumela abaqwalayo ukuba baqhubeke bethola izindlela ezintsha phakathi neCochamó Valley?","The correct answer is **B: Isiqongo sentaba**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...iziqongo zihlanganisa izindawo zokubona izindawo ezinhle kakhulu ezihlokweni. Abagibeli abavela kuzo zonke izingxenye zomhlaba bayaqhubeka ngokuthola imizila emisha phakathi kwezindawo ezingapheli ezingaba izindonga."" This directly links the ""ziqongo"" (mountain passes) to the ability for travelers to find new routes among the granite peaks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Indawo ebukwayo (Scenic spot):** While the valley is scenic, the text focuses on the *passes* as the places where routes are found.
* **C: Phezulu kwentaba (Top of the mountain):**  The text mentions granite peaks, but it's the passes *between* the peaks that are relevant to finding new routes.
* **D: Izindonga (Peaks/Mountains):** While the peaks are mentioned, the text emphasizes the passes (ziqongo) as the locations facilitating the discovery of new routes.



"
"Ngokokwaziswa okunikezwe kule ndaba, obani abakwazi ukuhamba kakhulu baklaye eNingizimu Yezwe?","The correct answer is **B: I-Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Inhlangano yeNkanyezi ihlanganisa yonke into ngaphandle kweNingizimu Phasifiki esempumalanga kusuka eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti, okuyindawo yokubalekela Yezwe elilodwa leLATAM."" This indicates that Star Alliance has the widest coverage in the Southern Cone, encompassing a significant portion of the region. The passage also explicitly says SkyTeam *doesn't* include all three major routes across the Southern and South American oceans. LATAM Oneworld isn't mentioned at all, and ""Ningizimu yePacific"" isn't a recognized airline alliance.
"
Imuphi umfelandawonye wamabhanoyi ohamba indawo encane olwandle uklaye iNingizimu Yezwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Inhlangano yeNkanyezi ihlanganisa yonke into ngaphandle kweNingizimu Phasifiki esempumalanga kusuka eSantiago de Chile kuya eTahiti..."" This directly indicates that Star Alliance is the alliance mentioned as encompassing routes in the Southern Pacific.  The question asks about a *small* airline alliance in the Southern Pacific, and the text implies Star Alliance is relevant to this region.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: INingizimu yePacific** is a region, not an airline alliance.
*   **C: ILATAM Oneworld** mentions LATAM, which is a major South American airline but doesn't define an alliance.
*   **D: I-SkyTeam** isn't mentioned in the text as relating to routes in the Southern Pacific.



"
Iyiphi inhlangano ebukisa abantu indawo eyalandela iGlobal Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **B: I-Go Running Tours**.

The passage states: ""I-Go Running Tours eyalandela i-Global Running Tours iqondisa izinkampani zezingosi emazwekazini amane."" This directly indicates that Go Running Tours followed Global Running Tours.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iGo Running Tour yasiza ekuxhumaniseni izinhlangano ezibuka indawo ezingaki?","The correct answer is **A: Ezine**.

The text mentions the following Go Running Tours locations:

*   Barcelona
*   Copenhagen
*   Prague
*   An unnamed location in ""mazwekazini amane"" (four countries) where they guide companies for jogging.

Therefore, iGo Running Tour assists with locations in **four** different places.
"
Yini isivakashi okufanele sikwenze uma sinethemba lokubona ngokucacile isilwane ingulele?,"The correct answer is **C: Sebenzisa izipopolo** (Use binoculars).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Amabhubesi, izingulule kanye nezingwe ziyexwaya futhi uzozibona kangcono ngezingilazi zokubuka kude."" (Lions, leopards, and hyenas are elusive and you will see them better with binoculars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hamba uyoqwala kuyisafari** (Go on a safari): While a safari is the overall experience, it doesn't specifically address seeing elusive animals clearly.
* **B: Hamba ehlathini** (Walk in the bush):  Walking in the bush is a type of safari, but it's not the *best* way to see elusive animals clearly. Binoculars are more helpful.
* **D: Thatha imoto bese usebenzisa amathuluzi afanele** (Take a car and use appropriate tools): While cars are used on safaris, the text directly points to binoculars as the tool for better viewing of elusive animals.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isilwane isivakashi okungenzeka sihlangane naso phakathi nokuvakasha kuyisafari ngemoto?","The correct answer is **A: Amabhubesi**.

The text states: ""Amabhubesi, izingulule kanye nezingwe ziyexwaya futhi uzozibona kangcono ngezingilazi zokubuka kude."" This directly indicates that visitors might see lions while on a safari in a vehicle.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini enganciphisa izindleko zokubona indawo?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuthola iqembu labantu abazobuka indawo.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that traveling in a group of 4-6 people can lead to lower individual costs.
* Options A, C, and D are either directly contradicted by the passage or don't address the cost-saving suggestion. Traveling alone (A) is presented as potentially more expensive. Traveling with one person (C) isn't mentioned as a cost-saving strategy. While option D aligns with the passage, option B is more encompassing and clearly outlines the benefit.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase athola amanani amahle okubuka indawo?","The correct answer is **A: Izivakashi ezizimisele ukuhambisana emotweni**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that solo travelers or those with one friend often pay more. 
* It also mentions that tours are often filled by matching travelers together to fill up vehicles.
* Therefore, those willing to join a tour with other travelers are more likely to get a better price (because they help fill the vehicle and reduce the cost per person).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iqembu labantu abathathu:** This is mentioned as a potential group size, but it doesn't inherently guarantee a better price.
* **C: Abangane ababili abahamba ndawonye:**  Like a group of three, this is a possible group size, but the passage implies smaller groups pay more.
* **D: Iqembu labantu abahlanu:** Same reasoning as C.  Larger groups *might* sometimes get better deals, but the passage focuses on the disadvantage of traveling alone or with one person.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini eyaba nesandla ekuqashelweni kwendawo yaseSan Francisco?","The best answer is **A: Ukuba khona kwezinto njalo ezihlukahlukene zobuciko nezabezindaba**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""I-San Francisco izungezwe izakhiwo ezinkulu zezivakashi ezinamahhotela amaningi, izitolo zokudlela, kanye nezakhiwo zemihlangano ezisezingeni eliphezulu. **Ukubukiswa kwalo njalo emculweni, kumafilimu, ezincwadini kanye nasemasikweni athandwayo kwenze idolobha kanye nezici ezibonwa ngalo izwe zaziwe emhlabeni wonke.**"" This directly links its prominence in art and media to its global recognition.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Izindawo eziphezulu zemihlangano:** While important, it's not the *primary* reason for its fame.
* **C: Ukwehlukahluka kwezomnotho:**  It contributes, but again, not as strongly as the cultural visibility.
* **D: Ukukhangiswa kwakhona ngokudla kwase-Asia:**  It's mentioned as a *feature* of San Francisco, but not the reason for its widespread fame.



Therefore, the consistent cultural visibility in media and art is the key factor highlighted in the passage as contributing to San Francisco's global recognition.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi kulezi zitatimende ezilandelayo mayelana neSan Francisco esingelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **D: Ezomnotho sezizonke zincike kakhulu ezivakashini** (The entire economy depends heavily on tourism).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that San Francisco's economy is **diverse**, with major sectors including tech, government, finance, trade, and tourism. It *doesn't* say the economy *depends heavily* on tourism. 
* While tourism is a significant contributor, the other sectors are also vital and contribute to the overall economic strength of the city.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: Isifakwe kakhulu kumamuvi kanye nasezincwadini** (Is heavily featured in movies and books): The text says San Francisco is ""always depicted in culture, in films, in books, and in popular ceremonies.""
* **B: Kwandile ukudla kwase-Asia okuhlotshisiwe** (Has a large selection of Asian cuisine): The text explicitly mentions Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese food being prominent.
* **C: Maningi amahhotela kanye nezikhungo zemihlangano** (Has many hotels and conference centers): The text states San Francisco is surrounded by ""large tourist facilities with many hotels, restaurants, and high-end conference facilities.""



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, izivakashi ezinjani ezingase zingazuzi ekusebenziseni izinkonzo zama-ejenti?","The correct answer is **B: Isivakashi esithanda ukuzenzela izinto (A traveler who likes to do things themselves)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the benefits of using travel agents, such as convenience, potential discounts, and handling logistics. A traveler who enjoys planning and booking everything themselves would not benefit from the services offered by a travel agent. They would prefer to handle the arrangements independently.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Isivakashi esimanqikanqika (A budget traveler):** While travel agents *can* sometimes offer budget options, the passage doesn't specifically say that budget travelers won't benefit. They might still benefit from deals the agent can secure.
* **C: Isivakashi esingakayitholi ivisa (A traveler who can't get a visa):** The passage mentions travel agents can hold reservations while you sort out visa issues, so this traveler *would* benefit.
* **D: Isivakashi esikhetha ukubhukha izindali eziyisamba (A traveler who chooses to book independent tours):** While this traveler books tours independently, they might still benefit from the travel agent handling the flights and hotel arrangements, especially if they value the convenience of a package.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungashiwongo endabeni njengenzuzo yokubhuka usebenzisa ama-ejenti okuvakasha?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukusheshisa amadokhuyumenti okuvakasha (Speeding up visa documents)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Noma iziphi izinguquko noma izicelo nokho kumelwe zidluliselwe enkampanini ehlela uhambo kuqala futhi hhayi nehhotela ngokuqondile."" This means visa processing is handled by the tour company, not directly by the hotel.

Let's look at why the other options are *not* the correct answer:

* **B: Imititilizo yamahhotela (Hotel discounts):** The passage says tour companies often have discounts with hotels.
* **C: Amaphakheji ahlanganisa yonke into (All-inclusive packages):**  The passage explains tour companies offer packages that include flights and hotels.
* **D: Ukubekisa isikhala sakho (Holding your space):** The passage states tour companies can hold your spot if you need time to decide or arrange things like a visa.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini izicelo zabahumushi abahumusha ngaso leso sikhathi abangakwazi ukuyenza?","The correct answer is **D: Ukuhumusha ngokunembe ngamaphesenti angu-100 ngaso sonke isikhathi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while real-time translation apps have advanced significantly and offer ""almost flawless"" translation, they can still be inaccurate. 
* Option D reflects this imperfection - the translation isn't perfect (100% accurate) all the time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuhumusha izimpawu zakwamanye amazwe:** While some real-time translation apps *can* translate signs, the passage doesn't highlight this as a primary capability or limitation.
* **B: Ukuhumusha yonke imibhalo yendaba:**  The passage mentions translating ""all text,"" but it also notes that the translations aren't always flawless, suggesting it's not a guarantee.
* **C: Ukuhumusha izinto ezibhaliwe ezintweni ezifana namafoni:** The passage explicitly states that real-time translation apps *do* translate written text on devices like phones.



"
Yini evumela ukuba ukuhumushwa kwento kungenziwa ku-inthanethi?,"The correct answer is **D: Izicelo zokuhumusha izinto ngaso leso sikhathi (Real-time translation apps)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Ama-app wokuhumusha we-Real-time – izinhlelo ezikwazi ukuhumusha ngokuzenzakalelayo zonke izingxenye zombhalo kusuka olimini olulodwa kuya kolunye.""  This highlights that *real-time translation apps* are what enable the instant translation.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the primary reason:

* **A: Izinto zokuhumusha ezithuthukisiwe** - While true that translation tools have advanced, this is a broad statement and not the specific *mechanism* that allows real-time translation.
* **B: Amafoni esimanje** -  Smartphones are a *platform* for running these apps, but they don't inherently *enable* real-time translation.
* **C: Ukudawuniloda idatha yolimi** - Downloading language data *allows* for offline translation, but it's not what makes the translation happen in real-time.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungasusi ukuwa kwamaqhwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Abantu (People)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kwezinye izikhathi isenzakalo sangempela esishukumisayo ilanga elifudumeza iqhwa, kwesinye isikhathi ukuwa kweqhwa elengeziwe, kwesinye isikhathi ezinye izenzakalo ezingokwemvelo, kaningi umuntu.""  This indicates that human activity can also cause snowfall.
* **The passage explains that the other options are factors *causing* snowfall:**
    * **Iqhwa elinamathelayo (Glittering snow):** The passage says snow needs to be disturbed to fall, and clinging snow can cause all the snow to fall. This is a factor *affecting* the falling of snow, but not the initial cause.
    * **Langa (Sun):** The passage explicitly states the sun warming the snow can cause snowfall.
    * **Ukuwa kwamanye amaqhwa (Falling of more snow):** The passage directly says falling more snow can cause snowfall.

Therefore, the only option that is presented as a *cause* of snowfall in the text is ""abantu"" (people).



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okwehla njengeqhwa eliwayo?","The correct answer is **D: Iqhwa elishiywe lingathintwanga abantu (Snow that has not been disturbed by people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that snow becomes ""powder snow"" when it's not disturbed.  The key is the lack of human interaction (""ukuthintithwa,"" or touching).  Options A, B, and C describe situations where snow *might* be present, but don't specifically address the condition that leads to powder snow (lack of disturbance).
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukhari usekelwe kuziphi izithako?","The correct answer is **B: Emakhambini kanye nezinongo**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukhari yisidlo esisuselwa kumakhambi nezinongo..."" which translates to ""Ukhari is a dish made from whey and curds...""
"
"Ezifundeni ezithile, ubisi lwekhukhunathi ngezinye izikhathi lusetshenziswa esikhundleni sasiphi isithako sikakhari?","The correct answer is **C: Iyogathi**.

The text states: ""eNingizimu neNdiya nasezindaweni ezinye ezisogwini zezwekazi, ubisi lukakhukhunathi luvamise ukusetshenziswa esikhundleni sasiphi isithako sikakhari? **Iyogathi**"".  This directly indicates that in those regions, yogurt is used instead of yogurt as an ingredient in the dish.
"
Kungani ukuphambuka eTransantarctic Mountains kudinga ukuba uye ethafeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Iqhwa elihlangene livame ukuba yingozi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lezi azilula kakhulu ngakho umzila kumelwe uphambukele kude uzungeze iziNtaba zeTransantarctic ukungena enkangaleni.""  This implies the mountains are a hazard.
* **The passage also describes the terrain as ""Iqhwa elihlangene eligcwele imisele ebekiswe ngamafulegi.""** This indicates a difficult, potentially dangerous, snowy landscape.
* **Option B directly addresses this:** ""Iqhwa elihlangene livame ukuba yingozi"" - a snowy, icy environment poses dangers to travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isiteshi iMcMurdo sivame ukuvalwa:** While weather can cause closures, the passage focuses on the terrain of the traverse itself, not the station's status.
* **C: Imishini ekhethekile ayikwazi ukuhamba kahle:** The passage mentions special vehicles designed for traversing the ice, so this is unlikely to be the primary reason for detouring.
* **D: Kulula kunokuhamba usebenzise iRoss Sea:** The passage explicitly states the route *must* go around the Transantarctic Mountains, implying it's *not* easier to use the Ross Sea.



"
"NgaseSouth Pole Traverse, yini emakwe ngamafulege?","The correct answer is **C: Imisele evulekile egcwele iqhwa**

The passage states: ""Kuyiqhwa elihlangene eligcwele imisele ebekiswe ngamafulegi."" This translates to ""It's a snow-covered expanse filled with lines marked by flags.""

Yini engazange ivezwe endabeni njengento izivakashi okufanele zikuqaphele lapho sibuka indawo yaseNingizimu Afrika?,"The correct answer is **A: Amazwe amaningi anemithetho ehlukahlukene ngokuphathelene nama-Visa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions visa requirements varying by country.** It states, ""Izimfuneko ze-visa nezindleko kuyahluka emazweni ngamazwe futhi kuthonywa yizwe ovela kulo."" (Visa requirements and costs vary by country and are determined by the country of origin.)
* **Option A directly reflects this point.**
* **Options B, C, and D are mentioned or implied but not the *main* point the question asks about.** While the passage talks about 4x4 vehicles, it focuses on the broader issue of country-specific regulations, particularly visas.

Therefore, the question is asking what *wasn't* highlighted as something visitors should be aware of. While the 4x4 vehicle is important, the varying visa requirements are a crucial piece of information that the passage emphasizes.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engabhekwa njengeseluleko esibi ezivakashini ezifuna ukuhlola iNingizimu Afrika zisebenzisa imoto?","The correct answer is **A: Ezinye izinto zezimo eziphuthumayo zingase zidingwe umthetho.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Izwe ngalinye libuye libe nemithetho ehlukile edinga okumelwe kube yizinto zesimo esiphuthumayo okumelwe zibe semotweni."" This directly supports option A.  Failing to comply with these laws could be a problem for visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nakuba i-4x4 ituseka, izindawo eziningi ziyahambeka ngemoto evamile:** The passage *does* say a 4x4 is highly recommended for accessing many places, but it doesn't say *most* places require one. This isn't necessarily a bad piece of advice.
* **C: Ukuhamba ngemoto kukahle kakhulu kulabo abafuna ukuchezuka kwezinye izindawo:** The passage states that driving is *good* for those who want to explore remote areas. This is accurate.
* **D: Akuwona wonke amazwe akhelene neNingizimu Afrika okuhle ukuwavakashela:** The passage actually states the opposite - that the diverse requirements for visiting different countries are a key consideration. This isn't a bad piece of advice.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kushiwo kule ndaba ngokuphathelene nobungozi bokushiya isikhwama sakho singagadiwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Zingase zebiwe**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions the risks of having unattended luggage being searched, planted with drugs, or mistaken for a bomb.
* While it's *possible* luggage could be damaged, the passage doesn't specifically address that risk. The other options are directly discussed within the text.
* The other options (B, C, and D) are all mentioned in the passage.



"
Yini engazange ishiwo endabeni mayelana nokuphatha izidakamizwa?,"The correct answer is **A: Kwamanye amazwe, abantu abaphula umthetho okokuqala bengase bathole isigwebo sokufa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions the potential for severe penalties, including a prison sentence of over 10 years or even death, in some countries for drug offenses.** Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ukuqapha okwengeziwe kufanele kuthathwe lapho uvakashela elinye izwe:** While the passage *implies* the need for increased vigilance, it doesn't explicitly state this as a separate point. It focuses on the specific risk of drug entanglement.
* **C: Izinja ezihlola izidakamizwa zingasebenzisa ngaphandle kokuthi wena wazi:** This is mentioned directly in the passage.
* **D: Iziphathimandla zingase zibambe isikhwama sakho ngisho noma izidakamizwa ungaziphethe:** This is a possibility mentioned in the passage, but option A covers a more extreme consequence of drug entanglement.



Therefore, option A is the best answer as it highlights a key, explicitly mentioned consequence of drug entanglement in some countries – the potential for the death penalty.
"
Yiluphi uhlobo lukatshwala olungazange lubalwe njengento ongazama ukuzenzela yona ekhaya uma uhlezi uphumule?,"The correct answer is **C: Ubhiya**.

Here's why:

The text specifically suggests making coffee in the morning, chamomile tea in the evening, and juices or fruit combinations. While tea and juice are explicitly mentioned as options to try making at home, the text doesn't mention or suggest making beer.
"
Yikuphi okulandelayo okufanele ukuvakashele phakathi nesikhathi sokuhlala ekhaya uma idolobha okulo laziwa ngenxa yeziphuzo ezenziwa khona?,"The correct answer is **C: Izindawo zokuphuza ongajwayele ukuya kuzo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uma uhlala edolobheni elinesiko lokuphuza elihlukile, yana ezinkantinini noma izindlini zokuphuzela emiphakathini ongavamisanga ukuya kuyo."" This translates to: ""If you live in a city with a distinctive drinking culture, visit cantinas or drinking houses in communities you don't usually go to.""

Option C directly reflects this instruction. The other options are not explicitly mentioned as ideal activities for exploring a city with a unique drinking culture.
"
Izithombe zamajuba zikuphi nendawo?,"The correct answer is **B: Emagcekeni esonto** (In the spokes of the wheel).

The text explicitly states: ""Egcekeni lesonto, kunemifanekiso yemabula ethakazelisayo yamajuba phezu kwamathuna amanye."" which translates to ""In the spokes of the wheel, there are interesting pictures of hair on some fish.""
"
Yiluphi uhlobo lwe-visa olungase ludingwe umuntu ukuze aveze uvufakazi ukuthi unemali eyanele ukuzisekela?,"The correct answer is **D: Ivisa yabafundi**.

The text specifically states: ""...you will typically need proof of funds for at least the first year of your studies."" and ""...student visas have different requirements than typical tourist or business visas.""  This points directly to a student visa being needed for longer stays for educational purposes.

While business and tourist visas *might* require proof of funds, the context of the passage emphasizes the specific needs of students.  ""Visa yesikhashana"" is too general.
"
Ubani ongase adinge ukwenezela isikhathi kuyivisa yakhe?,"The correct answer is **C: Umfundi ofunda phesheya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Amavisa wabafundi afuna izinto ezihlukahlukene nezindlela zokufaka isicelo ezivakashini ezivamile noma amavisa webhizinisi. Emazweni amaningi, uzodinga incwadi yalokho enivumelene ngakho engxoxweni yenu nesikhungweni ofisa ukufunda kuso, kanye nobufakazi bemali yokuziphilisa okungenani unyaka wokuqala wesifundo sakho.""

This directly indicates that students studying abroad require a visa for a longer stay than short-term visitors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Isivakashi esifika njalo:**  The passage describes short-term visitors.
* **B: Isivakashi esifika ngezikhathi ezithile:** This is also describing short-term visitors.
* **D: Isivakashi esize ngezamabhizinisi:** This is describing business visitors, and the passage notes that student visas have different requirements than business visas.



"
Kunini lapho kufanele uqaphele khona omiyane?,"The correct answer is **C: Ehlathini lemvula**.

The question specifically asks *where* you need to be aware of the stray animals. The passage states you should be particularly careful of stray animals when driving in the rainy season (hlathini lemvula).
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini okufanele uyigweme ukuyenza ukuze ugweme umiyane lapho ushayela ehlathini elimanzi?","The correct answer is **A: Ukushiya izicabha zemoto zivulwe isikhathi eside** (Leaving your car windows open for a long time).

Here's why:

The original text explicitly states that the speaker opens the car windows briefly to allow baboons to enter the car.  Leaving the windows open for an extended period would definitely invite baboons (and other animals) inside.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ukushayela phakathi nesikhathi sasehlobo** (Driving during the daytime):  While it might be wise to avoid driving when baboons are most active, the problem isn't the *time* of day, but the action of opening the windows.
* **C: Ukushayela endaweni engasolwandle** (Driving in a place not near the sea): The location isn't directly related to the baboon problem.
* **D: Ukushiya imoto yakho ingagadiwe kuyilapho usayoqwala izindawo** (Leaving your car unattended while exploring areas): While generally a good safety practice, the primary concern in this scenario is specifically about attracting baboons.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende kulezi ezilandelayo mayelana neSundarbans okungelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Uhhafu wayo yonke indawo umbozwe ixhaphozi (Half of its entire area is covered by mangrove forest)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ama-Sundarbans enza indawo engama-3,850 km², leyo ingxenye yesithathu yayo yembozwe yizindawo ezingamanzi/ubhuku.""  This means *one-third* of the area is covered by water/mangrove forest, not half.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true according to the passage:

* **A: Izici ezithile zasendle ezinkulu okungenzeka zisasele (Significant wildlife remains):**  The passage explicitly says ""kusukela ngo-1966 amaSundarbans abeyindawo yokuhlala izilwane zasendle..."" and ""...kulinganiselwa ukuthi manje sekunamahlosi waseBukhosini wase-Bengal kanye nezinyamazane ezinamabala ezicishe zibe ngu-30,000 endaweni.""
* **C: Ibhande elikhulu lomhlume emhlabeni wonke (The largest band of mangrove forest in the world):** The opening sentence states ""Ibhande elikhulu lomhlume emhlabeni wonke.""
* **D: Ikhaya lezinyamazane ezinamabala kunezingwe eziseBengal (Home to more spotted deer than Bengal tigers):**  The passage mentions ""amahlosi waseBukhosini wase-Bengal kanye nezinyamazane ezinamabala ezicishe zibe ngu-30,000 endaweni.""  While it doesn't directly compare to Bengal tigers, it confirms the presence of spotted deer.



Therefore, option B is the only false statement.



"
Iyiphi ingxenye yehlathi ephakathi nendawo yaseNdiya?,"The correct answer is **A: ISundarbans National Park**.

The text states: ""Ingxenye yehlathi elisensimini yabaseNdiya libizwa ngokuthi i-Ipaki Lesizwe i-Sundarbans Amahlathi..."" which translates to ""A part of the delta on the Indian side is called the Sundarbans National Park...""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ubani ongase abe nokuqonda okulinganiselwe kolimi lwesiNgisi?","The correct answer is **B: Abantu abasebasha ngokweminyaka**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Izizwe eziningi eziphelele zisikhuluma kahle isiNgisi, futhi nakwezinye ezengeziwe ungalindela ulwazi olulinganiselwe - ikakhulukazi phakathi kwabantu abasha."" This directly links limited English proficiency to newly arrived individuals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Umuntu okhuluma okungenani ezinye izilimi ezimbili:** While multilingualism *can* help with language acquisition, the passage doesn't explicitly state that multilingual people have limited English.
* **C: Abantu abavakashela iToronto:** Visiting a city doesn't automatically mean someone has limited English. They might be fluent, or they might have varying levels of proficiency.
* **D: Abantu asebekhulile ngokweminyaka:** The passage doesn't make any connection between age and limited English proficiency.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engase ibe nzima ukuyiphimisela?","The correct answer is **B: Amakheli**.

The passage specifically states: ""Kaningi kulula ukuqonda amazwi abhaliwe kunakhulunywayo, futhi. Lokhu kuyiqiniso ngokukhethekile ngamakheli, lawo kaningi okunzima ukuwaphimisela kahle.""

Translation: ""It is often easier to understand written words than spoken words, and this is especially true of accents, which are often difficult to decipher.""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isibonelo esingasiza umuntu ovakashayo ohlele ukuthatha ibhasi esuka esiteshini sesigodi se-inter?","The correct answer is **A: Umuntu ovakashile ubheke eJakar futhi uselithengile kusengaphambili ithikithi.**

Here's why:

The text states that a large number of buses, especially from the east and Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30. It also advises buying tickets in advance because the buses are often full. Jakar is specifically mentioned as a location where people from the east and Bumthang frequently depart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Umuntu ovakashile ubheke eBumthang futhi udinga ukuhamba ngo-7** - While Bumthang is mentioned, the text doesn't specifically say someone *needs* to leave at 7:00.
* **C: Umuntu ovakashile ubheke eParo futhi udinga ukuhamba ngemva kuka-11** - Paro is mentioned as being served by Coaster buses, but there's no indication of when someone would need to travel there.
* **D: Umuntu ovakashile ubheke empumalanga futhi ufika esiteshini ngaphambi kuka-6:20** - This option is too specific and doesn't directly relate to the information provided about Jakar and Bumthang. The text focuses on the departures *from* those locations.



"
Yikuphi okungaba icebiso elihle ngomuntu ovakashile ofuna ukuhamba aye empumalanga esuka ngebhasi esigodini sase-inter?,"The correct answer is **B: Thenga ithikithi kusengaphambili.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Njengoba amabhasi esifunda ngokuvamile egcwala, kuyatuseka ukuthi uthenge ithikithi ezinsukwini ezimbalwa ngaphambili.""  (Because the buses are usually full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amabhasi ahamba kuphela ngemva kuka-8:30** - The text says buses run ""all day,"" contradicting this statement.
* **C: Amabhasi amaningi ahamba phakathi nosuku** - The text implies buses are often full, making it advisable to buy tickets beforehand.  This doesn't necessarily mean they run *all* day.
* **D: Utekisi elihlanganyelwano lingaba indlela enhle yokuhamba** - While true, the question asks for the best option for traveling *by bus* eastward from the inter-city station. Buying a ticket in advance is a direct benefit for bus travel.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungayichazi kahle iTimbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Akufikeki khona ngebhanoyi (It's inaccessible by plane)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ngo-1990, yafakwa ohlwini lwezindawo zefa lomhlaba ezisengozini, ngenxa yosongo lwesihlabathi sasohlane."" This means it *was* inaccessible by plane in 1990 due to the earthquake damage. While it might have improved since then, the passage *doesn't* say it's currently inaccessible.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Inomthelela omningi wase-Arabh kunezwe lonke (It has a strong Arab influence compared to the rest of the country):** The passage directly says, ""Idolobha lihlukile ngokuphelele kwamanye amadolobha ezwe, ngoba linomoya wase-Arabhiya kakhulu ukudlula owaseAfrika.""
* **B: Ukukhahlamezwa inhlupheko (It has a history of misfortune):** The passage mentions the earthquake in 1990, which is a clear example of misfortune. It also being on the list of endangered places further supports this.
* **D: Isalokhu iyindawo ekhangayo kubantu abanelukuluku (It is still a place of interest for travelers):**  The passage says it was featured in Henry Louis Gates's ""Africa's Wonders"" and is described as ""ekhangayo"" (interesting/remarkable).



Therefore, the only statement that isn't accurately reflected in the passage is that it's currently inaccessible by plane.



"
Yiliphi iqiniso elilandelayo elimayelana neTimbuktu?,"The correct answer is **B: Indawo ecebile kunokuba mpofu** (A place that is both rich and poor).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ngo-1990, yafakwa ohlwini lwezindawo zefa lomhlaba ezisengozini, ngenxa yosongo lwesihlabathi sasohlane."" (In 1990, it was included in the list of endangered places in the world due to the threat of earthquakes.) This implies vulnerability and potentially economic hardship.
* However, it also says: ""Ngemuva kwalokho, iTimbuktu idolobha eliphundlekile, nakuba idumela lalo lilenza lithandwe izivakashi, futhi linesikhumulo sezindiza."" (Since then, Timbuktu is a beautiful city, although its reputation makes it popular with tourists, and it has an airport.) This indicates economic activity driven by tourism.

Therefore, the city embodies a combination of richness (due to tourism and historical significance) and poverty (due to vulnerability to natural disasters).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ibhanoyi liyakwazi ukufika kule ndawo** (The railway can reach this place): The text doesn't mention a railway.
* **C: Inezinto ezimbalwa zase-Afrika kunamadolobha azungezile** (It has few African things compared to surrounding towns): The text says the city has a *very* strong Arab influence, *more* than African.
* **D: Idolobha elingasazikhangi izivakashi** (A city that no longer attracts tourists): The text explicitly states that it *is* popular with tourists.



"
Ahlelwa nini Olympic asehlobo kwasekuqalenni? ,"The correct answer is **A: NgoAgasti 2021**.

The text states: ""Ama-Paralympic azokwenzeka kusukela ngomhla ka-24 Agasti kuya ku-5 Septemba 2021."" which translates to ""The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021.""
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kungasiphi isikhathi lapho umoya onjengefanela uba isivunguvungu?","The correct answer is **A: Lapho imimoya ifinyelela kumamayela angu-100 ngehora**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zingenza imimoya ephakeme (ngokuvamile amamayeli angu-100-200/ihora) futhi zingaphakamisa izinto ezisindayo emoyeni, zizithwale njengoba isivunguvungu sihamba.""  The passage also says they ""begin as wisps of dust in the air, then become 'whirlwinds' when they descend.""  Therefore, the transition from a wisp to a whirlwind happens *when the wind reaches those higher speeds (around 100 mph)*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lapho ingxenye yomoya iqala ukuzungeza:**  While swirling is part of a whirlwind, the speed is the key factor in defining it.
* **C: Kuyilapho yehla efwini eliyisivunguvungu:**  The action of descending is part of the whirlwind's behavior, but it's not the trigger for it becoming a whirlwind.
* **D: Ngemva kokuthinta umhlabathi:** The passage describes them *before* they reach the ground, becoming whirlwinds *as* they descend.  Touching the ground is a consequence of the whirlwind, not the cause of it becoming one.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okuyisici esinembile mayelana nesivunguvungu?,"The best answer is **B: Sivame ukuhamba nezinto ezisindayo.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Zingaphakamisa izinto ezisindayo emoyeni, zizithwale njengoba isivunguvungu sihamba."" This is a key characteristic highlighted in the description.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kuhlale kwenza umoya oyisivinini esingamamayela nagu100 kuya ku-200 ngehora:** While the passage mentions high winds, it doesn't say the wind *always* reaches that speed. It describes the *potential* for high winds.
* **C: Ziba njengefanela lapho nje sithinta phansi:** The passage says they *start* as streamers, but they *become* whirlwinds after descending. This isn't the defining characteristic.
* **D: Kuzungeza ingxenye leyo ephusha umoya phansi:** This is a more technical description of the swirling motion, not a defining characteristic in the way that carrying objects is.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, umuntu ovakashayo kufanele alithole kuphi icebiso mayelana nesixazululo sezepolitiki edolobheni alivakashelayo?","The correct answer is **D: Kuhulumeni wabo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that government advice is often tailored to its own citizens and might not be relevant to visitors from other countries.  Therefore, the most reliable source of advice for a traveler would be their *own* government. Their government will have information and warnings specifically designed for their citizens traveling abroad.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kuhulumeni wezwe azobe elivakashele:**  This is incorrect because the passage says that advice from the host country is tailored to its own citizens and may not be applicable to visitors.
* **B: Emibonweni ekhona endaweni yezivakashi yokuthola usizo:** While visitor centers *might* offer some general information, they are unlikely to have in-depth political advice tailored to a visitor's country of origin.
* **C: Ezakhamuzini zezwe umuntu azobe elivakashele:** The passage indicates host country citizens are likely to have different experiences than visitors and their advice isn't always reliable for outsiders.



"
"Ezimweni zonikeza izivakashi usizo, yini umuntu wakwelinye izwe angase ayilindele?","The best answer is **A: Ukukhanseleka komushwalense okuthintekile**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that travel insurance and health insurance could be affected by alerts and warnings. Option A directly reflects this.
* Option B mentions the need for political situation updates, but the passage notes that these updates are often general and not very detailed. 
* Option C is possible, but not directly guaranteed according to the passage.
* Option D is the opposite of what the passage describes – it says the information is often *not* detailed.



Therefore, the most accurate and directly supported answer is A."
"Ngokwale ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lohambo olungadinga ubhukhe ukuba uthole usizo kuyi-ejent yezokuvakasha?","The correct answer is **C: Uhambo oluzoba nezinkinga zolimi.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that travel agents are helpful when dealing with trips that involve language barriers. This is because agents can assist with translation, communication, and navigating cultural differences.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Uhambo lwenkomfa yomsebenzi edolobheni lowo ovakashile ake walivakashela ngaphambili:**  This trip is likely straightforward to book and doesn't require specialized assistance. The traveler already knows the area.
* **B: Uhambo lwamasonto amabili amade ahlelelwe izimali ezithile:** This type of trip could be booked online and doesn't necessarily require an agent, although an agent *could* be helpful for finding the best deals.
* **D: Uhambo lokuqala lwapheshela lomuntu ohambayo:** While an agent could offer reassurance, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as a trip type requiring an agent's assistance.  The main benefit of an agent is typically for more complex or challenging trips.



Therefore, **C** is the best fit based on the information provided in the passage.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isibonelo ovakashile angazuza kuzo ngokuphathelene nosizo lwe-ejenti yezokuvakasha?","The best answer is **B: Lapho ovakashile enesithakazelo sokubhukha uhambo okokuqala ngqa.**

Here's why:

* **The paragraph emphasizes the value of travel agents for first-time travelers.** The text states that travel agents are helpful because they can provide expertise in specific destinations, trip types, and price points. It also mentions that it can be easy to use an agent who books trips similar to the one you want.
* **Option B directly aligns with this emphasis.** A first-time traveler is likely to benefit most from an agent's guidance and experience.
* **The other options are less directly related:**
    * **A:** Booking a round-trip ticket to a familiar place doesn't necessarily require an agent.
    * **C:** Knowing the local language isn't the primary reason to use a travel agent.
    * **D:** Experiencing cultural differences might be interesting, but it doesn't specifically highlight the need for an agent.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical choice based on the provided text."
"Ngokwale ndaba elandelayo, yini engasiza ovakashile agweme ukuphoxeka kuyilapho evakashele indawo entsha?","The correct answer is **B: Ukuzimisela ukuzama ukudla ukudla ongakujwayela.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes adapting to the new environment.** It highlights that things like food, customs, and manners will be different.
* **Option B directly addresses this adaptation.** Trying new foods is a common way to immerse oneself in a new culture and show respect for local customs.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** Waiting for things to be the same as home is *the opposite* of what the passage advises.
    * **C:**  Following the same rules as home can lead to offending locals.
    * **D:**  Researching accommodation beforehand is helpful for planning but doesn't directly address avoiding offense through cultural sensitivity.



Therefore, embracing the local cuisine is a great way to avoid being perceived as disrespectful or out of touch."
"Ngokusekelwe kulokhu kwaziswa okukule ndaba, uhlobo olunjani lwabantu olungaphoxeka lapho luvakashele enye indawo?","The correct answer is **B: Umuntu ochumayo ngoshintsho**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of being adaptable and understanding that things will be different when traveling. It warns against expecting everything to be the same as at home and discourages being resistant to new ways of doing things. This aligns with the description of someone who is ""ochumayo ngoshintsho"" - someone who embraces change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Umuntu othanda ukudla okuphezulu** (Someone who loves fancy food): The passage doesn't mention food preferences at all.
*   **C: Umuntu ongafuni ukucabanga kakhulu** (Someone who doesn't want to think too much): The passage actually *emphasizes* the need to think about different aspects of a new place.
*   **D: Umuntu othanda ukufunda izinto** (Someone who loves to learn things): While learning *could* be a positive outcome of traveling, the passage focuses more on the *attitude* needed to navigate a new environment, not necessarily a love of learning.

Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungakhutazwa kubantu abavakashela amazwe asathuthuka okokuqala?,"The correct answer is **A: Thola ulwazi ngezilwane zendawo ngaphambi kokuba ulale phansi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically warns about sleeping on the ground in unfamiliar places due to potential pests.** Therefore, knowing about local wildlife beforehand is crucial for safety.
* **Option B is incorrect** The passage doesn't mention avoiding eating a lot.
* **Option C is incorrect.** While a camp cot or hammock is recommended for camping, the passage doesn't explicitly say it's *encouraged* generally. It's presented as a way to protect yourself from insects and other elements.
* **Option D is incorrect.** The passage advises *against* spending a lot of money on nice hotels initially to help adjust.



"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungabalwanga njengento ongachitha imali yakho eningi kukho lapho ujwayele amazwe asathuthuka?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukudla okukhethekile wasentshonalanga (Specialized Western food)**.

Here's why:

The passage advises *against* overspending on Western-style comforts when traveling to developing countries. It specifically mentions being cautious about expensive Western food. Options B, C, and D (high-end services, a sleeping surface for camping, and luxurious hotels) all fall under the category of things that might be tempting to spend money on, but the passage cautions against it. Specialized Western food is the most directly implied item to avoid overspending on.

"Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungaba kuhle kumuntu onenqubomgomo ofuna ikhophi yakhe naye ezobasemshinini wezobuchwepheshe, kodwa engenayo i-inthanethi?","The correct answer is **C: Ukugcina ikhophi igciniwe kuyilaptop yabo**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt specifically states:** ""If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, keep a copy of it on it or on a disc (it will be accessible even if you don't have internet)."" This directly addresses the scenario of someone traveling without internet access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nikeza lowo ahamba naye ikhophi:** While helpful, this doesn't fulfill the requirement of having a copy *available* even if there's no internet. The person traveling might not always be with that individual.
* **B: Yithumele kuye nge-email:**  The prompt advises to keep a copy *offline* as well, because relying solely on email means you need internet access to retrieve it.
* **D: Ukugcina ikhophi “kuyi-cloud”:** This requires internet access to retrieve the copy.

Therefore, keeping a copy on a laptop or disc is the only option that meets the requirements of being accessible offline.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungadingeki ukuba kuboniswe kuyinqubomgomo?","The correct answer is **A: Inombolo kazwelonke yokwenza izicelo**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically requests the email address of the insurance provider, contact numbers for various countries, and copies of the policy. It emphasizes having these readily available for access during travel and for sharing with others who might assist.

The passage **doesn't mention or require** a national number to submit claims. Options B, C, and D all directly align with the requirements outlined in the passage.

"Ngokwale ndaba, yimuphi usayizi ongemuhle oveza uhlelo lwefilimu oluvame ukusetshenziswa kakhulu?","The correct answer is **C: U-35 mm kokungekuhle**.

The text explicitly states that ""ngokuvamile kugcwaliseka futhi kalula kakhulu uma uphelelwa, futhi inikeza okubukeka okulinganiselwa kulokho okukhona kwe-DSLR"" refers to the 35mm film format. This indicates it's the most common and therefore the ""best"" option in terms of usability. The question asks for the *unsuitable* option, so the best answer is the one that is *not* the most common. The text describes the 35mm format as common and easy to use. Therefore, the other options are the less common formats.
"
Ikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo mayelana nohlelo lwefilimu olunikeza ukubukeka kwesithombe esifanayo neDSLR?,"The correct answer is **A: Ifilimu engu-35 mm**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngokuvamile kugcwaliseka futhi kalula kakhulu uma uphelelwa, futhi inikeza okubukeka okulinganiselwa kulokho okukhona kwe-DSLR."" This directly refers to the 35mm film format.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okungaba isinyathelo sokugcina ekuqaliseni ibhizinisi lokubhala elikhuluma ngokuvakasha?","The correct answer is **C: Khanda eyakho iwebusayithi.**

Here's why:

The prompt outlines a progression:

1. **Start a travel blog on a hosted website:** This is the initial step to build skills.
2. **Eventually, create your own website:** This is presented as the next logical step.

Building your own website is the final step in establishing your online presence and truly launching your travel writing business.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuzama ukwenza uhlelo lwewebusayithi:**  This is too early. You need a blog first to have content for a website.
* **B: Ukubhala izihloko eziningana ze-blog enokwethenjelwa yezokuvakasha:** This is part of the initial skill-building phase, but not the final step in starting a business.
* **D: Cijisa amakhono akho okulungisa:**  While important, this is a continuous process and not a specific final step in launching the business.



"
"Lapho uqala ibhizinisi lokubhala ngohambo, yiliphi ikhono kulawa alandelayo okungase kudingeke uwacijise kuqala?","The correct answer is **A: Ukukwazi ukubhala i-blog**.

Here's why:

The prompt states the easiest way to start a travel writing business is through a travel blog on an existing website.  Therefore, the foundational skill needed is the ability to write blog posts.  The other options are more advanced and would come later in the process.
"
Izinkinga zamathumbu zivame ukutholakala ngaphansi kwaziphi izimo zezulu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ezimweni zezulu ezishisayo**.

The text explicitly states: ""izinkinga zesisu ezindaweni ezinesimo sezulu esishisayo zivamile..."" 
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukuchayeka njalo kungaholela ekuchayekeni kuphi?","The correct answer is **A: Ezinkingeni zamathumbu (Intestinal problems)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly links the increasing prevalence of local pathogens (bacteria) with issues like ""Delhi Belly, Pharaoh's Curse, Montezuma's Revenge"" - all of which are diseases affecting the intestines. The passage also mentions stomach problems in hot climates, further supporting this connection.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo yinto enhle lapho uhamba phakathi nendawo yaseSchengen?,"The correct answer is **A: Gwema ukufaka izicelo ezihlukahlukene zama-visa**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that a Schengen visa allows you to travel to multiple Schengen countries without needing individual visas for each country. This directly relates to avoiding the hassle of applying for multiple visas.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ukulondoloza imali** While avoiding multiple visa fees *does* save money, the primary benefit highlighted is the convenience of a single visa.
* **C: Gwema izindawo okuhlolwa kuzo amaphasiphothi**  This is not directly mentioned or implied. While passport checks happen, the core benefit of Schengen is simplified border crossing.
* **D: Awekho amaphasiphothi adingekayo** This is incorrect. A passport is *always* required to travel internationally, including within the Schengen area.

Therefore, the best answer reflecting the text's main point is avoiding multiple visa applications.
"
Yini engasatholakala ethuneni likaTutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **D: Umcebo (The sarcophagus)**.

The text states: ""Ngcebo emangalisayo yethuna ayisekho kulo..."" which translates to ""The amazing sarcophagus of the tomb is not in it..."" 

Therefore, the sarcophagus is what is missing.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indawo yaseVancouver engabakhanga kancane abantu abavakashile abakhathazeke kakhulu ngamanani? ","The correct answer is **C: Isiqhingi iBowen**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that you can easily get to Bowen Island with a scheduled ferry from **Grandville Island** in the middle of downtown Vancouver.  This suggests it's a more accessible and potentially more affordable option compared to the other choices.
* The passage mentions Whistler as ""expensive"" (iyabiza kodwa iyaziwa kakhulu ngenxa yama-Olimpiki aseBusika ango-2010).
* The Sea to Sky Highway is a route *to* Whistler, not a destination itself.
*  While Grandville Island is a starting point for the ferry to Bowen Island, the question asks for a destination for those concerned about costs, and Bowen Island is the destination described as accessible from Grandville Island.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iyiphi indawo ebonakala inganikeza izivakashi isikhathi esimnandi eVancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Isiqhingi iBowen**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island is a ""real community just off of Howe Sound near Vancouver"" and offers a variety of activities like ferries, hiking, shops, restaurants, and more. It's presented as a place for a favorite day trip or weekend getaway.
* While Whistler and Downtown Vancouver are mentioned, they are discussed in relation to specific activities (skiing/mountain biking in Whistler, and just being a general area in Downtown Vancouver), and Bowen Island is highlighted as the place offering a comprehensive and enjoyable experience.
* Granville Island is mentioned as a departure point for ferries *to* Bowen Island, not as a destination in itself.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, kufanele abavakashi bayivakashele nini i-Fall uma befuna ukubuka ngaphandle kwezithiyo?","The correct answer is **D: Ngaphandle kwenkathi ezimvula**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ngesikhathi semvula (Novemba ukuya kuMashi), izinga lamanzi lizobaphezulu futhi iZimpophoma zizoba namandla kakhulu... ukubona iMpophoma ngokwayo kuzositheka—yiwo wonke amanzi!""
* This means that during the rainy season (November to March), it's difficult to see the rapids because of the high water levels.
* Therefore, to see the rapids ""ngaphandle kwenkathi ezimvula"" (outside the rainy season), you would have a better chance of seeing them.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: NgoNovemba kuze kube uMashi** - This is the rainy season when visibility is poor.
* **B: Phakathi nenkathi yezivakashi** - The passage doesn't specify a particular time within the tourist season.
* **C: Lapho amazinga amanzi ephakame** - High water levels make it difficult to see the rapids.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini ejabulisayo ngokuvakashela iVictorial Falls phakathi noNovemba noMashi?","The correct answer is **C: Isimangaliso sokubuka lo mfula**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""ziheha kakhulu"" (they attract a lot) and that the Falls are a popular tourist destination offering something for both thrill-seekers and nature lovers. This highlights the wonder and awe-inspiring nature of the falls.
* Option A is incorrect because the passage says seeing the Falls *itself* can be difficult during the rainy season due to the high water levels.
* Option B is not mentioned in the passage.
* Option D is incorrect because the passage explicitly mentions that the rainy season (November to March) is when the Falls are at their most powerful and impressive.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungatuswa lapho usebenzisa i-drone ukushe wenze ifilimu?","The correct answer is **A: Ukubheka kusengaphambili ukuthi unayo yini imvume yokushutha.**

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the importance of checking permissions *before* filming with a drone. It explicitly states: ""If it's not allowed to take a photo of something, you shouldn't even think about recording a video of it.""  Checking for permissions falls directly under this principle.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Thola amalayisense engeziwe:** While you *might* need additional licenses depending on the location, the passage focuses more on the initial permission to film in the first place. It doesn't say you *must* get additional licenses, only that you should check.
* **C: Izimvume zokucwaninga:** This is too specific. The passage isn't talking about research; it's about general filming permissions.
* **D: Ukushutha ezindaweni ezinabantu abaningi lapho ama-drone engaqapheleki:** This contradicts the passage's warning about flying drones near airports and crowds. The passage stresses caution around these areas, not that drones can be flown without any consideration.



Therefore, the most directly supported advice from the passage is to *check for filming permissions.*



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, zikuphi izindaba ezinhle kakhulu zokusebenzisa i-drone?","The correct answer is **D: Ezindaweni lapho uthole khona imvume kusengaphambili.**

Here's why:

The text emphasizes respecting local laws and regulations regarding drone use. It explicitly states that if taking a photo is restricted, recording video is also likely prohibited. It also advises checking for permissions and licenses *before* filming or recording.

Option D directly aligns with this principle: getting permission *before* flying a drone ensures you're operating legally and ethically.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukuba seduzane nequlu labantu elingenandaba nokuba khona kwe-drone:** This is generally *not* a good idea and could be dangerous, regardless of drone legality.
*   **B: Ezindaweni lapho ukushutha izithombe kungayidingi imvume:** While technically you *could* do this, the text's primary concern is *respecting the law*, not just avoiding a potential fine for a photo.
*   **C: Ezindaweni ezimatasa lapho i-drone engeke ibonakale kahle:**  This focuses on aesthetics, which isn't the core message of the text. The text focuses on legality and respect for others.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yisiphi isitatimende mayelana nezimfuneko zokubhalisela ivisa esingelona iqiniso?","The correct answer is **B: Wonke amazwe adinga ukubhalisa kuyiziphathimandla zendawo.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that **not** all countries require registration. It mentions that in some countries, only those staying outside of accommodations need to register.  Therefore, option B is the false statement.

Here's why the other options are true according to the passage:

* **A: Uma uhlala endaweni yezivakashi ungase ungadingi ukubhalisa:** The passage says ""In some situations, only those staying outside of accommodations need to register.""
* **C: Ukuvakashela ihhovisi labantu abayohlala kwamanye amazwe kungase kudingeke:** The passage states ""you may need to visit the local authorities or the embassy of your country.""
* **D: Kwezinye izindawo, amahhotela endawo ayakusingatha ukubhalisa:** The passage mentions ""In many countries, local hotels will register (make sure to ask).""



"
"Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo, okungeyona indawo labo abavakashile abangaya khona ukuze bayobhalisa?","The correct answer is **C: Ehhovisili leposi lendawo (Local post office)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that in many countries, hotels are responsible for registering visitors.
* It also mentions that in some cases, only those staying outside of tourist accommodations need to register.
* Police stations and the embassy/consulate are mentioned as potential places for registration. 
* A local post office is not listed as a place where visitors would typically register for a visa extension. 

Therefore, the post office is the most likely incorrect option.
"
Yini engase ingabi inzuzo ekuvolontiyeni kuyilapho usohambeni?,"The correct answer is **B: Umuntu ozama ukuthola umholo omncane**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many volunteer opportunities *provide accommodation and food*, and some even *offer a stipend (holo)*.  Option B suggests someone is *trying to get a low salary*, which isn't directly supported by the text. In fact, the passage implies volunteering can be a *way to save money* because accommodation and food are often provided.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Umuntu ozama ukwakha abangane abasha:** The passage says it's a way to meet new people.
* **C: Umuntu onethemba lokuthola ikhono elisha:** The passage specifically mentions gaining new skills.
* **D: Umuntu ongase abe nesifiso sendlu nendawo yokuhlala:** The passage states many volunteer placements *provide accommodation*.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, ukuvolontiya lapho uhambile kungamzuzisa kanjani umuntu ovakashile ngokwezimali?","The correct answer is **C: Indlu nendawo yokuhlala kuvame ukunikezwa.**

The passage explicitly states: ""Ngisho nokuthola amakhono amasha. Kungabuye kube indlela ekahle yokusebenzisa kahle imali ukukuvumela ukuba uhlale isikhathi eside kakhudlwana kwenye indawo njengoba imisebenzi eminingi yokuvolontiya ihlinzeka indawo yokuhlala nokudla futhi embalwa iholela iholo.""  This directly indicates that housing and food are often provided as part of volunteer work.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Uzohlale enayo imali ayitholayo:** While you *might* not have to spend as much money, the passage doesn't guarantee you'll have more money. It focuses on saving money.
* **B: Lokho kuvame ukuholela emathubeni omsebenzi:** The passage mentions learning skills but doesn't link volunteering to job opportunities.
* **D: Kungakusiza ukwazi ukuba nombono omuhle:** While gaining new perspectives is mentioned, it's not the primary way volunteering helps financially.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engase ibhekwe njengohambo nje lokuya eWalt Disney World?","The correct answer is **A: Ukuchitha isonto lonke ubuka amapaki.**

Here's why:

The passage defines a ""typical"" Disney World trip as a multi-day visit *primarily* focused on experiencing the parks. While other elements like flights, hotels, and transportation are involved, the core of the experience is spending a significant amount of time within the Disney parks. Option A best reflects this core element.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ukuhlala ehhotela elingaphandle:** The passage explicitly states the trip *includes* staying at a Disney hotel.
*   **C: Ukuchitha isikhathi sonke uhlala endaweni yaseDisney:** The passage says people *leave* the Disney area, so this isn't a typical trip.
*   **D: Ukuthatha ibhasi usuka esikhumulweni samabhanoyo uye ehhotela:** This is just transportation and not the main activity of the trip.

"
Yisiphi isitatimende mayelana neWalt Disney World esingelona iqiniso?,"The correct answer is **A: Amathikithi ePark-hopper ayakwazi ukuthunyelwa nakwabanye abantu** (Park-hopper tickets can be transferred to other people).

The text explicitly states: ""Nguna kuwumsebenzi ovamile kakhulu, wenqatshelwe yi-Disney: amathikithi awadluliselwa."" (Although it's a very common thing, Disney prohibits it: tickets are not transferable.)

Here's why the other options are true based on the text:

* **B: Kunendawo yokuhlala ekhona ngaphakathi** (There is accommodation within): The text mentions staying at a Disney hotel.
* **C: Kunamabhasi akhona athutha izivakashi ezisusa esikhumulweni samabhanoyi ziye ezindaweni zokuhlala** (There are buses that transport visitors from the airport to their accommodation): The text mentions buses for transportation within the Disney area.
* **D: Amathikithi aphakathi nosuku engase atholakale kuyiwebusayithi yokudayisa** (Day tickets may be available on a resale website): The text mentions tickets being sold on websites like eBay or Craigslist.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, iziphi izinkinga ezilandelayo engaze kungaxoxwa ngayo ekuqeqeshweni okusezingeni eliphezulu noma ezincwadini?","The best answer is **A: Ukukwazi ukusinda endle**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the training includes ""midlalo yokulingisa"" (simulation games) which imply scenarios where survival skills are practiced.** The focus on ""isizinda sempi"" (war zone) strongly suggests a need for survival techniques.
* **While B (Ukulungela ukusebenzisa into yosizo lokuqala - Being prepared to use first aid) and C (Ukulungela izindawo ezinempi - Being prepared for war zones) are relevant, the text highlights the *immersive* and *practical* training.** The focus is not just on knowledge but on applying it in realistic situations, making survival a central concern.  The phrase "" ngokuvamile ngendlela yokukusebenzisa engokoqobo"" (usually in a practical way) supports this.
* **D (Ukudlala izindima - Role-playing) is less specific.** While role-playing is *part* of the training, it doesn't cover the *content* of what might be discussed or practiced.

Therefore, survival skills are the most likely topic to be covered in detail during the advanced training, and thus the most likely to be mentioned in books related to this subject.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isifundo esilandelayo okungenzela kwaxoxwa ngayo ekuqeqeshweni okusezingeni eliphezulu?","The correct answer is **B: Izindawo ezinezimpi**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ngokuvamile, isifundo sizohlanganisa zonke izindaba okuxoxwe ngazo lapha ngokujulile, ngokuvamile ngendlela yokukusebenzisa engokoqobo. Inkambo izohamba ngokujwayelekile kusukela ezinsukwini ezingu-2-5 futhi izobandakanya imidlalo yokulingisa, insiza yezimo eziphuthumayo eningi futhi kwesinye isikhathi ukuqeqeshwa ekusebenziseni izikhali … Izincwadi nomagazini abakhuluma ngokuphila endle zivamile, kodwa izincwadi ezikhuluma ngezindawo zezimpi zimbalwa.""  This directly points to the focus on combat zones.
* While first aid (A) and survival skills (C) are *part* of the training, the passage emphasizes the unique challenges and specific situations found *within combat zones* (B).
* ""Izindawo ezihlukumezayo"" (D) is too broad. While combat zones are dangerous, ""izindawo zezimpi"" is the more accurate and specific term used in the context of the passage.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi ongakukhetha okungcono ekugwemeni ukugcola kwamanzi?","The correct answer is **B: Thenga amanzi asebhodleleni.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that if you have concerns about water safety, you should **buy bottled water from a reputable company.** This is presented as the best option if you're worried about potential contamination.
* While boiling water can be effective (options A and C), the passage indicates that the required boiling time varies depending on the specific circumstances.  Bottled water offers a guaranteed level of safety.
* Option D (checking water for hazards) is important, but it doesn't address the immediate need for safe drinking water if you are unsure of the water's quality. Buying bottled water is a proactive solution.



Therefore, buying bottled water is the most reliable and recommended option when concerned about water contamination according to the passage."
"Ngokwale ndaba, yini engase ingabi nakwenzeka ngisho nakubabhukudi abanekhono?","The correct answer is **A: Ukubhukuda eduze kakhulu nesisekelo solwandle (Swimming too close to the reef)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ukufa okuningi kwenzeka ngenxa yokukhathala kokuzama ukubhukuda uya emuva ngokuphambene nomsinga, **okungaba yinto engenakwenzeka**.""  This refers to trying to swim *backwards* against the current.

Swimming *too close to the reef* (option A) would likely result in hitting the reef, which is a dangerous situation and arguably impossible to avoid if you're too close. The passage doesn't specifically say this is impossible, but it is a highly dangerous situation.

The other options are not directly addressed as being impossible:

*   **B: Ukubhukuda emanzini ajulile (Swimming in deep water):** The passage says fast currents in deep water are dangerous, but not impossible.
*   **C: Ukubhukuda uphambane namagagasi (Swimming ahead of the reef):**  The passage suggests swimming ahead of the reef is generally okay, and the danger arises when trying to swim *backwards* against the current.
*   **D: Ukubhukuda eduze kwamagagasi (Swimming near the reef):** While dangerous, the passage doesn't state it's impossible to do. The danger is mainly swimming *backwards* against the current.



"
Yini okufanele uyenze lapho ubanjwa amagagasi?,"The correct answer is **A: Zama ukuphuma kuwo ngokubheka kolunye uhlangothi, yibe usubhukuda uye ogwini**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the danger of fighting against the current.** It specifically mentions that trying to swim back against the current is often futile and leads to exhaustion and potentially drowning.
* **Option A aligns with the advice in the passage.** Looking to the side and swimming towards the shore (the direction *with* the current) is the safest strategy.
* **Option B is incorrect.**  The passage explicitly warns against swimming against the current.
* **Option C is not specific enough.** Simply looking to the side isn't a full strategy for escaping.
* **Option D is generally not recommended.** Swimming underwater can be dangerous, especially in a strong current, as you can easily become disoriented.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate and helpful advice based on the provided text.
"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi lapho ukungavakashela khona inqaba kungaba isikhathi esiyinqophamlando eholidini lakho?","The correct answer is **C: Rhine Valley**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions ""ukuvakashela izigodlo eSigodini saseLoire, isigodi saseRhine"" as an example of supporting a holiday with a water theme. This directly points to the Rhine Valley.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Edolobheni eliseduze neDanube:** While visiting cities near the Danube is mentioned, the Rhine Valley is specifically highlighted.
* **B: Eduze ne-Erie Canal:** Visiting near the Erie Canal is mentioned as an option, but the Rhine Valley is a more direct example given in the passage.
* **D: Eduze nendawo ezinamanzi:** This is too general. The passage is providing specific examples, and the Rhine Valley is one of them.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungatuswa ngabesifazane abavakashele lezi zindawo?","The correct answer is **B: Kugade ukuthi ukungafani kwamasiko kungase kugqugquzele okunye ukuziphatha kubantu bendawo.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly warns women about cultural differences leading to misunderstandings and potentially unwanted attention (like being followed or touched). This directly addresses how cultural differences can influence the behavior of locals.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kugweme ukukhuluma ngokuthi ushadile yini noma cha:** The text states that it's *helpful* to indicate marital status, regardless of whether you are married or not. So this is the opposite of what's advised.
* **C: Gwema ukufaka ubucwebe obukhangayo:** While the text advises against expensive jewelry, it doesn't specifically mention avoiding flashy clothing in general.
* **D: Qina uma kunesidingo:**  The text *encourages* women to be strong and independent, regardless of cultural differences. This is consistent with the advice given.

Therefore, option B is the only one that accurately reflects a key point made in the text about the impact of cultural differences on behavior.
"
"Ngokwalokho indawo echazwe ngayo endabeni, yikuphi okungasiza abesifazane abavakashile?","The correct answer is **D: Uma ungakuthandi lokho othile akwenzayo qina ngokweqaba ngokucacile.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Qina lapho wenqaba amadoda, futhi ungesabi ukuzimela (umehluko wamasiko noma cha, awenzi kube okulungile!)."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bephawule ukuthi akujwayelekile ukuba balandelwe:** The text actually warns against this, saying ""kusuka ukuthi noma ngabe yiziphi izivakashi zesifazane zithi zishadile, kungakhathalekile ukuthi zishadile yini noma azishadile"" and mentions that being followed or grabbed can be misinterpreted.
* **B: Ukugqoka indandatho enkulu ebonisa ukuthi ushadile yini noma cha:** The text advises *against* this, stating that even having a modest scarf can lead to misunderstandings due to cultural differences.
* **C: Ukuqonda ukungefani kwamasiko kusho ukuthi gweme ukuqina:** While understanding cultural differences is important, the text says to *stand firm* when rejecting unwanted attention.  It doesn't advise avoiding assertiveness.



"
"Ngokwale ndaba, isiphi isibonelo esingadinga umuntu oshutha izilwane angakusebenzisa ngezinto ze-lens?","The best answer is **A: Ikakhulu uma beshutha isilwane esincane**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically mentions needing different lenses for smaller animals like birds or small creatures.** This directly links the need for specialized lenses to photographing smaller wildlife.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **B: Uma izithombe zizosetshenziselwa izinjongo zokudayisa:** While permits or permissions might be needed for commercial photography, the text focuses on the technical challenges of the shoot itself, not the legal aspects. Lens choice is a technical challenge.
* **C: Uma isilwane esishuthwayo sinamahloni:**  Handling wary animals is a challenge, but not specifically tied to lens requirements.
* **D: Uma ipaki linemithetho ekhethekile mayelana nokushutha izilwane:** Park regulations are important, but again, the text emphasizes the technical challenges of capturing the image.

Therefore, option A is the most directly supported by the provided text.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungazange kubalwe endabeni engase ibe inkinga kulabo abashutha izilwane?,"The correct answer is **A: Ukuthola izilwane ezithile (Getting specific animals)**.

Here's why:

The passage extensively discusses the *challenges* of wildlife photography. It mentions the need for luck, patience, knowledge, good equipment, specialized lenses, and dealing with unpredictable animal behavior and environments. It also touches upon regulations and safety concerns.

Option A, ""Ukuthola izilwane ezithile"" (Getting specific animals), is a *challenge* but it's not explicitly mentioned as one of the problems or difficulties in the passage. The passage focuses more on the general difficulties and potential dangers. The other options (B, C, and D) are all directly discussed within the passage.
"
Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okungase kubangele izinkinga ngomshayeli odlula izintaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Kungabonakali kahle phambili (Visibility may be obstructed)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ngakolunye uhlangothi, izimo zeqhwa noma zesithwathwa zivamile emazweni amaningi, futhi izimoto zihamba ngaphandle kokuphazamiseka cishe unyaka wonke. **Ngakolunye uhlangothi, ukubonakala kungavinjelwa ukuwa noma ukufuthwa kweqhwa noma noma ngomswakama noma iqhwa efasiteleni lemoto.**""

This directly connects poor visibility with snowy or icy conditions, making it a major concern for drivers.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Lapho kunesiminyaminya esinamandla (Strong winds):** While strong winds can be difficult to manage, the passage focuses on the direct impacts of snow and ice.
*   **B: Kungase kube nokungqubuzana (Possible mechanical failure):** Mechanical failure is a general concern, but not explicitly linked to the specific dangers of mountain driving in the passage.
*   **C: Kunomjuluko ohlezi emawindini (Frost constantly on the windows):** Frost is a symptom of cold temperatures, but poor visibility is a more immediate and direct hazard described in the passage.

Therefore, **D** is the best answer based on the information provided."
Yini engase iqhubeke ikhona mayelana nentela emazweni amaningi?,"The correct answer is **B: Izakhiwo (Structures)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Intela yomholo ihlelwe ngendlela ehlukile emazweni ahlukene, futhi namanani nezingxenye ezehlukile zentelaziyehlukahlukakusuka kwelinye izwe kuya kwelinye."" This means the *structure* or *way it's organized* of income tax varies from country to country.  The passage also mentions national and local levels, highlighting different components of the structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amanani (Values):** While values *do* vary, the passage focuses more on how the tax *system* is structured, not just the specific numbers.
* **C: Lapho ogcina khona izinto (Where things are kept):** This refers to storage locations and is irrelevant to income tax structure.
* **D: Ezinye izinhlobo zentela (Other types of taxes):** The passage focuses *specifically* on income tax, not other types of taxes.

"Ngokwale ndaba, uma usebenza phesheya kodwa ukwenye indawo ikuphi lapho kubonakala sengathi ungathumela khona izinto zakho zentela?","The correct answer is **C: Ezweni osebenza kulo**.

Here's why:

The passage states that if you work abroad, you'll likely need to pay taxes in the country you are working *in*. It also mentions that tax systems vary by country, and taxes are collected at both national and local levels in some countries. Therefore, the taxes would be paid in the country where you are employed.

Yiziphi izitatimende kwezilandelayo esingayichazi kahle Imibukiso Yomhlaba?,"The correct answer is **D: Amazwe awaphoqelekile ukuba abambe iqhaza (Countries are not required to participate)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Amazwe athathe ingxenye abemele amaciko nemfundo..."" (Countries take part representing exhibits and education...) This implies participation is *not* mandatory. 

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the text:

* **A: Imibukiso yalokho amazwe anakho ezintweni zamagugu noma amasiko (Exhibitions of what countries have in terms of cultural or historical items):**  The text explicitly mentions ""...izinkinga zomhlaba wonke *noma isiko lezwe labo kanye nomlando*."" (global issues *or the culture and history of their country*).
* **B: Ukubonisa isayensi yezitshalo eduzane nezobuciko nezemfundo (Showcasing plant science close to art and education):** The text says ""International Horticultural Exposition ezenzakalo ezikhethekile ezikhangisa ngezimbali, izingadi zezimbali *nanoma yini ehlangene nezitshalo*."" (International Horticultural Exhibitions that showcase flowers, flower gardens *and anything related to plants*). It also mentions ""Ukubonisa isayensi yezitshalo"" (Showcasing plant science).
* **C: Le micimbi ingathaha izinyanga eziyisithupha (This event can last for six months):** The text says ""...Zibanjelwa ezindaweni okungenani ezingamahektare angu-50"" (...they are held in locations of at least 50 hectares). It also states ""...ingathaha izinyanga eziyisithupha."" (can last for six months).

Therefore, the only option contradicting the text is D.

Yikuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okuwuthetho weWorld Fair noma i-International Exposition?,"The correct answer is **A: Imibukiso kufanele ibonise kokubili umlando wezwe nezinkinga zomhlaba.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...to showcase global issues or their country's culture and history."" This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Izwe elifanayo alikwazi ukubamba le mibukiso minyaka yonke:** The text says these events *don't* happen annually, but doesn't restrict a country from hosting multiple times over a longer period.
* **C: Imibukiso kufanele ithathe izinyanga eziyisithupha:** The text states the events typically take *three to six months*, not six.
* **D: Ukuze lo mbukiso ube khona wonke amazwe kufanele abambe iqhaza:** While participation is key, the text doesn't say *all* countries have to participate for the fair to exist."
Ukwenza kuphi kulokhu okulandelayo okunganciphisa ukuhlasela kwezilwane?,"The correct answer is **C: Ukugcina ibanga elingamayadi angu-25 nezimpisi.**

The text explicitly states that park regulations require visitors to maintain a distance of at least 100 yards from bears and 25 yards from other wildlife to prevent encounters and potential attacks.  The passage emphasizes this as a key safety precaution.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ukuphatha amakhambi anephunga elimnandi** - The text says to *avoid* handling scented food because it attracts bears.
* **B: Ukususa udoti ezindaweni olahlwa kuzo** - While cleaning up food scraps is good practice, the main preventative measure mentioned in the text is maintaining distance.
* **D: Ukuvimba izilwane lapho zifuna ukudla okulahliwe** - This is a consequence of not maintaining distance, not a preventative measure *in itself*.

Therefore, option C directly addresses the primary recommendation for reducing the risk of animal attacks according to the provided text.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that many injuries happen because visitors don't maintain a safe distance from animals.
* While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they aren't directly identified as the primary cause of attacks. The passage emphasizes the importance of maintaining distance.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Iphunga elinamandla:** The passage mentions that baiting animals with scented food attracts bears and other wildlife. However, it states that *avoiding* scented food is recommended, not that it *causes* attacks.
* **C: Ukondla izilwane zasendle:** The passage mentions avoiding feeding wildlife, but it isn't presented as the *main* reason for attacks.
* **D: Izilwane ezingabajwayele abantu:** While the passage says animals aren't afraid of people because they are used to them, it's the *lack of distance maintained* that's highlighted as the leading cause of injuries.
