Here's why:

* The passage states that the ""ႁူင်းၵၢၼ်ဢၼ်ၸတ်းၵၢၼ် ဝူင်းႁႆႇတိုင်ႈလႄႈ HK Management Inc."" (the management company of the stadium) failed to provide an explanation.
* The question asks which *group* issued the statement.
* Therefore, the management company is the group responsible for issuing the statement regarding the lack of explanation."

Here's why:

The text states that the reason for the recurring theft is that the authorities in Bishkek don't have a proper system. A student mentions that Bishkek is like an ""unfriendly country"" for entrepreneurs due to a large population of those who illegally seek quick money by selling stolen goods.  People living in Bishkek often protect newcomers who have arrived from afar due to their illegal activities.

This implies that **entrepreneurs** are the ones being targeted and experiencing the theft, because they are perceived as having valuable goods to steal. They are the ones who are suffering the consequences of the lack of a proper system for protecting property.



The other options are less likely:

*   **B: ၸဝ်ႈၶွင်ႁၢၼ်ႉ (Shopkeeper):** While shopkeepers can be victims of theft, the text focuses on a larger pattern of recurring theft impacting entrepreneurs.
*   **C: ၵူၼ်းၼေၵၢင်ၸႂ် (Individual):** This is too general. The text specifically mentions entrepreneurs.
*   **D: ၵူၼ်းသိၵ်ႉႁိၵ်ႉ (Poor person):**  While poor people might be *involved* in the theft, the text frames the problem around the theft *affecting* entrepreneurs.

ပဵၼ်ၽႂ်ၵေႃႉႁႃတၢင်းၽိတ်းတေႃႇ ၵူၼ််းၼေၵၢင်ၸႂ်ၶဝ် တီႈပွတ်းၸၢၼ်း။,"The correct answer is **C: ၵူၼ်းၵေႃႇၵၢၼ်ႁၢႆႉ (Khun kaobkan hait - Displaced people)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Bishkek is like an ""unwelcoming country"" due to a large number of displaced people (""displaced people"" or ""khun kaobkan hait"").
* The displaced people are resorting to selling scrap metal to survive.
* Locals are taking advantage of their vulnerability, exploiting their lack of documentation and rights.

Therefore, the question is about finding someone to help the displaced people. Option C directly addresses this by identifying the vulnerable group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၵူၼ်းယူႇသဝ်း တီႈ Bishkek (Khun youn sao ti Bishkek - Lonely people in Bishkek):** While some displaced people might be lonely, the text focuses on their larger, more systemic displacement and vulnerability.
* **B: ၽူႈဢုပ်ႉပိူင်ႇ (Phu uppiung - Politicians):** The text indicates that politicians are *exploiting* the displaced people, not necessarily being the ones to help them.
* **D: ၵိူင်း (Kiung - Child):** The text mentions displaced people in general, not specifically children.

The text explicitly states that Ring's financial troubles were dramatically reversed after appearing on Shark Tank in 2013. Therefore, appearing on Shark Tank was the key turning point for Ring's sales and financial success.

The passage repeatedly emphasizes how *Reading Rainbow* encourages a love of reading and helps children connect with books. The quotes from Reading Rainbow's creator and the expert highlight its role in fostering literacy and a positive attitude towards books. The program's aim is to get children to engage with books.

Here's why:

The passage clearly states that the fire was the reason for the damage to the tree and the subsequent concerns about the safety of the surrounding area. Option C directly reflects this issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ပူၼ်ႉလိူဝ်ဢၼ်ၸၢင်ႊပဵၼ်ၼၼ်ႉၵႂႃႇ (The potential cause of the fire)** - While a cause might be investigated, the passage focuses on the *result* of the fire, not its potential origin.
* **B: ထုၵ်ႇလီထိင်း ငဝ်းလၢႆးၵဝ်ႇ (The need to properly extinguish the fire)** -  The passage mentions the fire being extinguished, but the core issue isn't about the extinguishing process itself.
* **D: ၽေးၶဵၼ် ပၢႆးယူႇလီ တႃႇၵူၼ်းၼမ် (A public safety issue)** - While the fire *did* create a public safety issue, option C is a more direct and encompassing description of the central problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: မၵ်းမၼ်ႈပၼ် ပၵ်းပိူင်ပၢင်ၵုမ်ၸွမ်း RSPCA:** While RSPCA (Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) might be involved in animal welfare, the text doesn't mention any specific regulations or guidelines from them.

Here's why:

* **The text states that Steve Jobs said ""Apple is reinventing itself, we are reinventing our history.""** This means Apple is *not* becoming outdated or irrelevant. In fact, they are making a fresh start and redefining their past.
* **""မိုဝ်းထိုဝ်"" (Incorrect)** means ""to be irrelevant"" or ""outdated"". This is the opposite of what Jobs stated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ပိုၼ်း (Therefore/Consequently)** - While the statement implies a positive outcome, the text doesn't explicitly state a consequence.
* **C: ႁူင်းၵၢၼ် (Management)** - This is unrelated to the content of the statement.
* **D: ပၢႆးၸၢင်ႊ (Potential/Possibility)** - While there's always potential, the statement focuses on Apple's active reinvention, not just a possibility.

Therefore, **မိုဝ်းထိုဝ် (Incorrect)** is the most incorrect option as it directly contradicts Jobs' statement."

Here's why:

The provided text states that Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone in a press conference, describing it as a revolutionary moment for Apple and the company's history. The phrasing ""Apple is reinventing itself, Apple is being reborn"" strongly suggests the launch of a new product category.  The iPhone was the first major step in Apple's entry into the tablet market.

The other options are less likely:

* **B: တႃႇႁဵတ်းဢွၵ်ႇ ၶွမ်းမႂ်ႇ (To create a new computer):** Apple already had a history of creating computers. The focus on ""reinventing"" implies something more significant than just a new computer.
* **C: တႃႇႁဵတ်းဢွၵ်ႇ မိုဝ်းထိုဝ်မႂ်ႇ (To create a new watch):** Apple launched the Apple Watch *after* the iPhone and iPad.
* **D: တႃႇပိုၼ်ႊၽၢဝ်ႇ လွင်ႈမၼ်းတေလိုဝ်ႈၵၢၼ် (To announce the end of the era):** The statement is about a *beginning*, not an end.



Therefore, the most logical interpretation is that Steve Jobs was announcing Apple's entry into the tablet market with the iPhone.

The text states that Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner expressed her desire to run for Senate after the presidential inauguration. Option B accurately reflects this. 

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၽူႈတၢင်တူဝ် ၸွမ်ၸိုင်ႈ (Presidential candidate)** - While she *was* a presidential candidate, the text focuses on her plans *after* the inauguration.
* **C: ႁဵတ်းလွင်ႈတူင်ႉၼိုင် တႃႇၽူႈတၢင်တူဝ်လိူၵ်ႈတင်ႈ the Buenos Aires (Taking a stand for Buenos Aires)** - While her plans likely benefit Buenos Aires, the text specifically mentions her Senate aspirations.
* **D: ၽႅၼ်ၵၢၼ်မၼ်း တႃႇလိုဝ်ႈၵၢၼ် တႅၼ်းၽွင်း (Her plan for becoming a judge)** - The text doesn't mention any plans to become a judge."

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the passage clearly indicates the location is *near* La Plata, not *in* Buenos Aires or a different location."

Here's why:

The passage states that ACMA is concerned about content guidelines being ignored online.  It specifically mentions that the guidelines for handling controversial news are being implemented to monitor online activity, and that servers are needed to do so.

Option A directly reflects this concern – that content guidelines are not being properly enforced or deleted. The other options are incorrect because:

* **C: ပၵ်းပိူင် ႁၢင်ႈၶိူင်ႈၸိူင်း ထုၵ်ႇပူၼ်ႉပႅၼ် (Content guidelines must be properly deleted).** This is the opposite of what the passage implies. ACMA is concerned about guidelines *not* being deleted, but being enforced.
* **D: လႆႈႁၼ် ၶေႃႈၼမ်း မီးဝႆႉၼႂ်း ၸၢၵ်ႈၶွမ်းသႃႇဝႃႇ (Posts are stored in the Vault).**  This is irrelevant to the ACMA's concerns about online content guidelines.

Here's why:

The text states that ACMA (Australian Communications and Media Authority) requires media outlets to manage their online content and prevent the storage of private information within their websites. The example of Big Brother highlights this – the show's staff are trained to avoid posting private internet information on the Big Brother website and they need servers to manage this.

Here's why:

* **The question asks why Australia doesn't have a large nuclear industry.**
* **The provided text states that Australia has a developed energy sector and has historically focused on fossil fuels.** This explains why there hasn't been a significant push for nuclear energy. 
* **The text mentions that the development of nuclear energy in Australia was linked to the desire to utilize uranium, which is now managed differently.** This further supports the idea of a focus on existing energy sources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ဢမ်ႇလႆႈၶႂၢင်ႉတီႈ ၵူၼ်းမိူင်း (Doesn't want people)** - This is irrelevant to the discussion of energy sectors.
* **C: မီးၽေးၼမ်ၼႃႇ (Is rich in coal)** - While Australia is rich in coal, this doesn't directly explain the lack of a nuclear industry. It just points to the existing energy focus.

Here's why:

The passage states that Albert Muchanga mentioned Benin's planned entry into AfCFTA during the major summit. However, he clarified that they haven't finalized arrangements regarding rules and regulations, and their capacity to implement trade will be ready by July 1st, 2020.

The question asks why Albert Muchanga wasn't invited to a later meeting due to a change of heart. The passage implies that Muchanga's statement regarding the July 1st, 2020 deadline is the key factor.  If Benin's readiness for trade is tied to that specific date, any discussion about trade arrangements *before* that date would be premature and potentially irrelevant, making further invitations to discuss those matters unnecessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: သင် Benin ၶေႃႈႁူမ် AfCTA လႆႈ** (If Benin enters AfCFTA): While a fact, it doesn't explain why Muchanga wasn't invited *later*.
* **C: ၵဝ်ႉငဝ်ႈပၵ်းပိူင်** (Person in charge):  The passage doesn't say Muchanga is in charge of *arrangements* or regulations; he's simply representing the African Union.
* **D: လွင်ႈငူပ်ႉၺီႉၶွၼ်ႇ** (Conflict): The passage doesn't mention any conflict. The issue is about the timeline for trade implementation.

* **The text highlights Hu's criticism of developed countries for trying to impose their successful methods on others.** Hu specifically states they shouldn't try to ""take their methods, privileges, and achievements."" 
* **Hu advocates for developing countries to create their own paths to prosperity.** They call for a way to ""build a path to prosperity after that.""
* **Option C directly reflects Hu's rejection of simply adopting developed countries' methods.**  Hu suggests continuing to use existing methods, implying a focus on developing independent solutions.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Hu criticized foreign companies for:

Here's why:

The passage states that Camille Saint-Saens' donation of a cannabis-related sculpture inspired young cannabis users to openly use cannabis on stage.  This led to increased attendance at theatre performances, encouraging more people to join the ""cult"" or group of cannabis users.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Partake ၸႂ်ႉတိုင်းယႃႈပၢင်း (Partake in drug use):** While related, this is too general. The passage is about joining a specific group associated with cannabis.

Here's why:

* The passage describes how drug dealers (""ၸိူင်းဢၼ်တီႈ ၸၢတ်ႈသႅင်း French"" - French hashish dealers) were involved in providing cannabis on the stage.
* The text states that this led to young people using cannabis on stage and the theatre becoming a place where people were drawn to participate.
* Therefore, the people who were involved in supplying the drugs during the performances are the drug dealers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၸဝ်ႈပၢႆးမွၼ်း (The manager)** - While the manager might have been affected by the situation, the passage doesn't identify them as the ones actively distributing the drugs.
* **B: ၵူၼ်ႈပၼ်ႁႅင်း ၾရႅၼ်ႇသဵတ်ႈ (French suppliers)** - This is too broad. The passage specifically refers to ""drug dealers"" (ၸိူင်းဢၼ်တီႈ ၸၢတ်ႈသႅင်း French) who are the ones providing the drugs *during* performances.
* **D: Camille Saint-Saens** - Camille Saint-Saens is mentioned as the composer, but the passage doesn't say he was involved in supplying the drugs. He is simply the person whose music was performed.

(Later on, Leonov joined the Soviet side and immediately participated in the Apollo-Soyuz project, which was a milestone for space rendezvous.)  The question asks what ""spacewalk"" Leonov was called for. The answer is that he was Cosmonaut No. 11. While the Apollo-Soyuz project is mentioned, it's the *event* he participated in after the spacewalk, not what he was called *for* the spacewalk. The Space Race is the broader context, not the specific title for the spacewalk.

* The text states that after his spacewalk, Leonov later flew with the Soviet Union and was immediately involved in the Apollo-Soyuz project, which was a significant step in international cooperation in space.
* The Apollo-Soyuz project was a joint mission between the US and the Soviet Union, marking a thaw in the Space Race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: The Space Race:** While Leonov's actions were *part* of the Space Race, the question asks what he was involved with *after* his spacewalk. The Apollo-Soyuz project is the direct answer to that.
* **C: Cosmonaut No. 11:** While Leonov *was* Cosmonaut No. 11, the question isn't asking for his title, but rather what he was involved with next.

The text describes gravitational lensing as a phenomenon where the gravity of a massive object (like the Sagittarius galaxy) bends the light from a more distant object (like the Sagittarius dwarf galaxy). This bending of light creates multiple images or distorted appearances of the background object, acting like a lens.

The question asks what astronomers are studying to observe this phenomenon. The text explicitly states that astronomers are studying the ""light from distant objects"" to understand how it is bent and distorted by massive objects, which is the core of gravitational lensing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The answer options relate to the study of the sky and celestial bodies, specifically mentioning ""star streams"" and ""trails of stars.""

The passage states that after Hurricane Katrina, the ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"" was criticized. The liberal side accused the rebuilding efforts of being ego-driven, a display of political posturing by Washington officials. The question asks which option best reflects that the original perpetrators (those in power) didn't seek solutions.

Option C directly aligns with this criticism. It suggests that those in power could be accused of building their own ego through these rebuilding efforts, implying a lack of genuine concern or solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: ဢီးယွမ်ၸႂ်ႉၸၢႆႇ (Eager to serve):** This is the opposite of what the passage implies. It suggests they were motivated by a desire to serve, not ego.
*   **B: ႁၢမ်းလွင်ႈၵေႃႇသၢင်ႈ ၸႂ်ဢိုၼ်ႇ (Resist building ego):** This contradicts the passage, which accuses them of building ego.
*   **D: ၵၢၼ်ၶွတ်ႈၽွတ်ႈ လၢႆးၽိမ်းၸၢႆႇ (Political maneuvering):** While political maneuvering *is* mentioned, it's not the core accusation. The main criticism is that the motives were ego-driven.

This directly links the release of radiation to the Uranium being present and its nucleus splitting.  Therefore, Uranium is the substance that should be observed.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: ထၢတ်ႈ Radioactive caesium (Radioactive Caesium):**  Caesium is mentioned, but Uranium is the primary substance causing the issue according to the text.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes avoiding contact with radioactive substances.** It specifically mentions not washing hands in water, and avoiding detergents.
* **The passage connects the radioactive release to the splitting of Uranium.** This suggests the risk isn't just from the detergents themselves, but from potential contamination.
* **Option C directly reflects the passage's warning to avoid washing and scrubbing, which is a preventative measure against potential contamination from radioactive materials.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ​​ငိူင်ႉ​ဝႄႈလွင်ႈၸႂ်ႉတိုဝ်း ငဝ်းလၢႆးလူမ်း (Avoid using strong detergents):** While detergents might contribute to spreading contamination, the passage's primary warning is against contact with radioactive substances in general, not just the detergents themselves.

* **D: ဝႄႈလွင်ႈၵိၼ်ၼမ်ႉ ပႅၵ်ႉ (Avoid drinking water):** The passage does mention avoiding water contact, but it's more about preventing contamination of the body than directly about drinking water.

Blockchain is a key technology for secure and transparent tracking of assets and transactions, aligning with the passage's description of precisely managing and tracking the location of airport infrastructure and aircraft. While other technologies are involved, blockchain is a core element for the specific purpose described.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ပၢႆးၸၢင်ႊဢိင်ၼိူဝ် လွင်ႈၵပ်းသိုပ်ႇ (Internet of Things - IoT)**: IoT is used for connecting devices, but the passage focuses on tracking and managing *infrastructure and aircraft* with precision, making blockchain a more fitting core technology.

Here's why:

* **The text describes NextGen as a system designed to optimize air traffic and reduce carbon emissions.**  It mentions creating a ""precise and efficient"" route system for air traffic.
* **Option B accurately reflects this.** ""A network of interconnected, highly efficient routes"" perfectly captures the essence of NextGen's goal of improving air traffic management.
* **Options A, C, and D are not as suitable:**
    * **A: သဵၼ်တၢင်းဝိၼ်ပွတ်း (A clear path):** While NextGen aims for better routes, it's more than just a single clear path; it's a comprehensive network.
    * **C: လူတ်ႈယွမ်းထၢၼ်ႈ ၵႃႇပုၼ်ႇ (Carbon footprint):**  While NextGen addresses carbon emissions, this option focuses solely on the environmental impact, not the route system itself.
    * **D: ၸႂ်ႉႁႅင်းယိူဝ်ႇဢေႇတိူဝ်း (Alternative energy sources):** NextGen promotes efficiency, but it doesn't solely focus on alternative energy sources. While it can facilitate the use of more efficient aircraft, it's not the core concept.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q)** states that politicians are wary of the FBI's intrusion.  It implies a power imbalance and a feeling of being watched and potentially manipulated.
* **The Passage (A)** explains the context of the FBI's increased involvement and the political funding behind it. This further reinforces the idea of power dynamics at play.
* **Option C** directly addresses this power dynamic by suggesting a focus on the power dynamics within the political field. This aligns perfectly with the question's implication that politicians are concerned about the FBI's influence.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ၸွၺ်ႈႁႂ်ႈတၢင်းယိူင်းဢၢၼ်းၶဝ် တိူဝ်းဝႆး (Make the opposing forces wary)** - This is a general statement and doesn't specifically address the relationship between politicians and the FBI.

Here's why:

The passage states that the FBI's intelligence capabilities were strengthened by the ability to:

* **Analyze raw data:**  The passage mentions the FBI being able to ""identify intelligence from raw data to actionable intelligence."" This is a core aspect of intelligence work.
* **Connect the dots:** The passage indicates the FBI could connect different pieces of information.
* **Predict future events:** The passage indirectly suggests predictive capabilities by mentioning the focus on preventing future attacks.

Option A directly addresses the process of turning raw intelligence data into useful, actionable information - a key aspect of what intelligence agencies do.

* **B: ႁဵၸွၺ်ႈႁႂ်ႈ ၵၢၼ်ႈၸွပ်ႇၶၢဝ်ႇ တိူဝ်းဢွင်ႇမၢၼ် (Facilitating large-scale cooperation):** While cooperation is important, the passage doesn't primarily focus on the role of intelligence in facilitating cooperation, but rather in the analysis of data.

*  Air Traffic Control is responsible for managing aircraft movements on the runway and ensuring safe operations.  When an aircraft crashes, air traffic control would be directly involved in managing the aftermath, including diverting incoming flights.

Here's why:

The provided text states that Brzezinski helped Carter with diplomatic efforts, including the Camp David Accords, which led to improved US-China relations and normalized US-Iran relations. The question asks who Brzezinski could have been a key player in the Iranian hostage crisis. Since he worked with Carter during a time when Iranian relations were strained, it's logical to assume he was involved in attempts to resolve the crisis under Carter's administration. Kissinger was a Secretary of State *before* Carter, and Kennedy and Johnson were presidents during different periods. Therefore, Carter is the most likely answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: မၼ်းမီးၶူၼ်ၼင်ႇၼူၵ်ႉ ႁူမ်ႇတင်းတူဝ်ၶိင်း** - This is mentioned, but not as a differentiating factor *from Velociraptor*. Both have feathers.

Option A best captures the essence of the manager's actions: living quietly (secluded room) within the ruined head office (where the collapse occurred). The other options are not fitting descriptions.

The text clearly states that the Irish government is considering implementing penalties for drug users, particularly those involved in organized crime and those who use drugs. The question asks what the government intends to do. Option A directly addresses this by mentioning penalties for drug users.

The passage mentions that people who misuse drugs (related to the ethnic/cultural community) and those who misuse drugs in general are subject to **branding (ပိူင်မၢႆမီႈ)**, but *not* physical branding.  The question asks what the ""branding"" is referring to.  

In the context of Ireland and drug misuse, ""Lakh"" (လၵ်ႉ) is a term that refers to a system of tracking and labeling individuals who misuse drugs, often as a preventative measure.  It's not physical branding, but a method of record-keeping.

Here's why:

The text states that the person who claimed to be the creator of the disaster was investigated for **destroying the land** but not for the death of people. The text then mentions that the damage wasn't to physical things but to the mental well-being and emotional stability.

Therefore, the investigation focused on the destruction of the land/territory as claimed by the individual. Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ႁဵတ်းႁႂ်ႈ တွၼ်ႊတူဝ်ၶိင်းမၢတ်ႇ (Haeht hai tawn tuaw khiing maat)** - Making things more beautiful/elegant. This isn't related to the investigation's focus.

Here's why:

The passage states that Christopher Garcia reported that the alleged mastermind was being scrutinized for land corruption but *not* for the loss of human life.  It also mentions that the suspect's physical condition wasn't affected but he was undergoing mental rehabilitation to correct a focus problem (going from the letter ""O"" to the letter ""e"").

The question asks what wasn't reported at the time. The passage implies that the *loss of human life* wasn't reported despite the land corruption being scrutinized. Therefore, the answer should relate to the lack of reporting on something serious, which aligns with the phrase ""ႁၢင်ႈၶိူင်ႈတေႃႇ လၢႆးမိုဝ်းငမ်းယဵၼ်"" (from seriousness to calmness/stillness).  This suggests a suppression or lack of reporting on a significant issue.



The other options are incorrect:

This translates to: ""Mendoza gave M16 rifles to the soldiers. Those who became hostages in the process received assistance, and six people died. Six people were captured, including children and adults, who were rescued by the foreign fighters.""

The text clearly indicates that the foreign fighters rescued the captured individuals, including those who were hostages. Therefore, Rolando Mendoza was *not* the one who became a hostage. He was associated with the foreign fighters (ၸၢဝ်းၶိူဝ်းၾႅၼ်ႇၽႅၼ်ႇ).

This means that at the time the passage was written, there were three intense hurricanes tracked near 35°W, including Fred.  The question asks how many are remaining *after* Fred.  The passage doesn't give us information about whether the other two hurricanes have dissipated. Therefore, the best answer we can give is that there are *two* hurricanes remaining, the other two of the original three.

Therefore, **C: သွင် (Two)** is the most logical answer based on the information provided.

The text states that athletes tested positive for banned substances due to consuming 100mg and 200mg of something (implied to be a banned substance) in the Commonwealth Games.  The question asks about the number of ways athletes could have been caught. The passage implies there were multiple ways or scenarios that led to positive tests, and the context suggests there were at least five. The text doesn't explicitly list five different ways, but it frames the situation as athletes being caught through consuming different amounts of the substance.  Without more context, ""five"" is the most logical choice.

The key point is that **the fluid buildup was a result of his own physical exertion**, not a deficiency that could be cured by medication. The athletes were also prohibited from taking performance-enhancing drugs.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

The text states that a ""pile of lava rock"" was discovered near the volcano's peak. This lava rock is believed to be the cause of the recent tremors. The text also mentions that the rock showed signs of a ""violent outburst."" 

Therefore, the lava rock itself is the thing that led to the discovery and understanding of the lack of a direct connection between the tremors and the volcano's activity.

Therefore, option C, which states it ""created various ways"" (implying it created ways to gather data and explore), is the most accurate summary of the text's content regarding the Moon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: မၼ်းလူင်းၸမ် ၸိၵ်းႁွင်ႇ လိူၼ် (It landed on the Moon's surface).** While true, this only describes one aspect of the mission, not the overall narrative of the text.
* **B: မိူဝ်ႈလူင်းၼၼ်ႉ လူႉၵေႃႈ ဢွင်ႇမၢၼ်ယူႇ (During the landing, it also survived).** This is incorrect. The text states the probe *crashed* onto the Moon's surface, indicating it did *not* survive the landing.
* **D: မၼ်းတေႃႇဢဝ် ၶူဝ်းၶိူင်ႈ လမ်ႇလွင်ႈ သွင်ဢၼ် (It carried two kinds of materials).** The text mentions the probe had *instruments* (which are types of materials used for data collection), not necessarily ""two kinds of materials."" It doesn't specifically state the probe carried only two types"

    * B: ၵူၼ်းၺွပ်းမူ (Crowded houses) - Crowded houses can facilitate the spread of disease, but they aren't the medicine used to treat it.
    * D: သုတ်း (Scrub) - ""Thok"" doesn't have a relevant connection to encephalitis treatment.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions that Deutsche Bank was heavily involved in using shell companies to hide wealth. It states they had shell companies for approximately one-third (around 1200) of their clients. This directly relates to the question about how the UK became concerned about its financial dealings.  The role of Deutsche Bank in facilitating hidden wealth is a key element of the Panama Papers scandal and a major concern for financial regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ၽွၵ်ႈယေးငိုၼ်း လၢႆလၢႆဢၼ် (Various ways to hide money):** This is too broad. While various methods were used, the text focuses on Deutsche Bank's specific involvement with shell companies.
* **B: ပၵ်းပိူင်ၶိူင်ႇၶမ်ႉ Panamanian (Setting up Panamanian trusts):**  While Panama is mentioned (as the source of the leaked documents), the text's focus isn't *specifically* on Panamanian trusts.  It emphasizes Deutsche Bank"

The text isn't focused on a shortage of soldiers, lack of funding, or the desire to build more soldiers; it's about the disastrous consequences of inadequate roads.

Here's why:

The question asks when Alonso's racing career was disrupted. The provided text details how Fisichella's team (where Alonso was the number two driver) was essentially dismantled after Alonso's departure. It also explains how Michael Schumacher's career ended due to frequent accidents. Therefore, the disruption to Alonso's career is directly linked to Fisichella's team being broken up.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Alonso သၢတ်ႈပွၺ်းႁေႃႈလူတ်ႉၶႄႉမၼ်းမိူဝ်ႈလႂ် (Alonso's racing career ended in this instance).**  The text doesn't state that Alonso's career *ended*. It only describes a disruption to his team situation.
* **C: ဝၢႆးသေ Schumacher ႁုပ်ႈသိမ်းပၢင်ပွၺ်းမၼ်း (After Schumacher secured his championship).** While Schumacher's career ended after a series of accidents, the text primarily focuses on the disruption of Fisichella's team and Alonso's situation, not Schumacher's championship.
* **D: ၵွၼ်ႇပႆႇလႆႈ ႁပ်ႉဢွၼ်ႁူဝ် (Not yet recovered).** This option doesn't directly address the timing of Alonso's disruption.

Here's why:

The question asks why Schumacher's racing career was cut short. The text states: ""Waiy ling Alonso goot kaan kheeng pabet aem haing thin Michael Schumacher goot pabet kaan kheeng maan zai yun pio aen he loon than khon khon way lam wa kheeng pabet nai paang kheeng ziuw tii nan khiao haing yaw.""  This translates to: ""After Alonso ended his racing career, Michael Schumacher also ended his racing career because of repeated accidents during racing.""

The text further explains the accidents were *caused by* the same reason that affected Fisichella: ""Waiy laa Alonso goot kaan kheeng pabet pabet aem haing thin Michael Schumacher goot pabet kaan kheeng maan zai yun pio aen he loon thaan khon khwan khon way lam wa kheeng pabet nai paang kheeng ziuw tii nan khiao haing yaw."" This translates to ""After Alonso ended his racing career, Michael Schumacher also ended his racing career because of repeated accidents during racing.""  The text points out that Fisichella's accidents (caused by the same thing) also led to him not being able to continue racing.



Option A is incorrect because the text states Schumacher *didn't* cut his career short; it was cut short *for* him.
Option B is incorrect because the text mentions both Fisichella and Schumacher having accidents. While Alonso's actions might have influenced the overall circumstances, the direct cause of Schumacher's career ending was the accidents themselves.
Option D is incorrect; the text states he *ended* his career because of accidents, not that he *lost* it and then had it restored.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate based on the provided text."

Here's why:

The text states that Afghan officials claimed they saw irregularities within their own territory, arguing that further intervention (referring to the initial US-led invasion) was unnecessary. This directly relates to the principle of **state sovereignty**, which asserts the right of a nation to govern itself without external interference. The officials were essentially saying the US intervention was a violation of Afghanistan's sovereignty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ၸုတ်ႇယွမ်းၾၢႆႇႁူမ်ႇလူမ်ႈ (Collective security)** - While collective security is related to international relations, the text doesn't focus on it.
*   **C: ၵႃႊၸႂ်ႉၸၢႆႇသုင် (Self-interest)** - Although self-interest might be a factor in the US decision to intervene initially, the text doesn't discuss this.
*   **D: ၾိင်ႈမိူင်းဢၼ်ငမ်းငဝ်း (Neutral state)** - Afghanistan was not portrayed as a neutral state; it was the target of the initial US-led intervention.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Taliban claimed they saw inconsistencies within Afghanistan and that further elections were unnecessary. This contradicts previous reports that the destruction of infrastructure was a religious motivation. 

The question asks why diplomats thought the election wasn't significant.

The answer is that the Taliban's actions indicated they were maintaining control over the country's structure, making a formal election largely irrelevant to their power. They didn't need an election to consolidate their control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: မၼ်းၵႂႃႇၶတ်းၶႂၢင်တင်း ပၵ်းပိူင်လၵ်းမိူင်း (It went to claim the country's structure):** While the Taliban is claiming control, the phrasing isn't as accurate as saying they *maintained* it.
* **B: မၼ်းမီးလွင်ႈၸုတ်ႇယွမ်း ၾၢႆႇႁူမ်ႇလူမ်ႈ (It showed a strong sense of unity):** The passage actually indicates the opposite – internal inconsistencies and a lack of need for further elections suggest the Taliban's unity isn't the primary driver.
* **D: ပၢင်လိူၵ်ႈတင်ႈၼၼ်ႉ ၵႃႊယႂ်ႇပူၼ်ႉတီႈ (That election was very important):** The passage implies the election was *not* important given the Taliban's actions.

The text states that after independence in 1947, the Pakistani government appointed ""Political Agents"" to administer FATA. These agents were essentially representatives of the Pakistani government and were responsible for providing assistance to government and community organizations within FATA.  The President of Pakistan, as the head of state and government, would be the ultimate authority in appointing these agents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: လူင်ပွင်ၸိုင်ႈ Pakistan (Government of Pakistan)**: While the government of Pakistan was involved, the text specifically mentions the appointment of ""Political Agents,"" which were agents *of* the government. The President is the head of this government.
* **B: ၽူႈတၢင်တူဝ်ၵၢၼ်ပႆၢးမိူင်း (Political Representative)**:  ""Political Agents"" *were* political representatives, but the question asks who *made* them.

This translates to ""providing assistance to the main government and community organizations under Article 247 of the Pakistani state's territory.""  Providing financial assistance is a key part of offering assistance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ၶဝ်ထုၵ်ႇလိူၵ်ႈပဵၼ်မႃး ယွၼ်ႉ ၸွမ်ၸိုင်ႈ Pakistan (They were appointed because of the Pakistani government).** While the passage mentions the Pakistani government, it doesn't state that the Political Agents were *appointed* by it. It says they were a part of the administration in FATA.
* **C: ၶဝ်ႁိတ်းၸွမ်း ပၵ်းပိူင်လၵ်းမိူင်း Pakistan (They followed the guidelines of Pakistan).**  The passage says they *implemented* the guidelines of the Pakistani state, not that they followed them.
* **D: ၶဝ်ၵုမ်းၵမ်လႆႈ ၼႃႈလိၼ်မင်တီႈ တိမ်ထူၼ်ႈ (They gradually gained remote land).** This is not mentioned in the passage.  The focus is on providing administration and assistance.

It also mentions that Lionsgate received 26 nominations, the most of any studio, including for the original screenplay. Therefore, ""ၽဵင်းငဝ်ႈတိုၼ်း ၶႅမ်ႉသုတ်း"" (Original Screenplay) is the answer.

The question asks if the various operations are being resumed after the earthquake. Railway infrastructure is specifically mentioned as being damaged and affected, so its resumption is a key aspect of the recovery efforts.

The passage states that Ma has held a ""green card"" (permission to live and work) in the United States for a long time. The question asks why she could participate in the election. The passage indicates that this is possible because of her long-standing ties to the United States, specifically mentioning her ""interest in the long-term relations with mainland China.""  Her green card signifies her legal residency in the US, allowing her to participate in the election.

The other options are incorrect:

Here's why:

The passage states that the NBA postponed games because of the COVID-19 outbreak.  The context clearly indicates the postponement is related to basketball games, specifically the NBA's basketball league. While the Utah Jazz and COVID-19 are mentioned as the cause, the *reason for the postponement* is the basketball games themselves.

Here's why:

The passage states that the NBA's decision to postpone games was influenced by the Utah Jazz's COVID-19 outbreak.  The key phrase is ""ၸႅတ်ႈႁၼ်ၺႃးၸိူဝ်ႉမႅင်းတၢင်းပဵၼ် COVID-19 ၼၼ်ႉယဝ်ႉ"" which translates to ""noticed a COVID-19 outbreak.""  This outbreak happened *within* the Utah Jazz team, meaning their players tested positive.

Therefore, the NBA was influenced by the positive COVID-19 cases *among the Utah Jazz players*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၵူတ်ႇထတ်းႁၼ် ၽူႈၶဝ်ႈၸုမ်း NBA ပဵၼ် တၢင်းပဵၼ်** - While NBA players *can* test positive, the passage specifically highlights the Utah Jazz outbreak as the trigger.
* **B: ၵူတ်ႇထတ်းႁၼ် ၽူႈၶေႉၶဵင်ႇၵမ်ႈၼမ် ပဵၼ်တၢင်းပဵၼ် တီႈပၢင် Utah Jazz** -  The passage mentions a *COVID-19 outbreak*, not just ""many players"" being positive.
* **C: ဝၢႆးသေၵူတ်ႇထတ်းႁၼ်တၢင်းပဵၼ်ယဝ်ႉ ၽူႈလဵၼ်ႈ Utah Jazz ဢမ်ႇမႃးၼႄတူဝ်** - The passage doesn't mention any players not showing up. It's the positive cases that are the issue.

The question asks who scored the goal that put the Washington Capitals ahead against the Atlanta Thrashers. The provided text clearly states: ""Goal of Ovechkin was the goal that put the score ahead..."""
ၼႂ်းပၢင်ၶႄႉ Capitals တင်း Thrashers ၼၼ်ႉ ၵေႃႉလႂ်ယိုဝ်းသႂ်ႇ 60 လုၵ်ႈ?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text explicitly states that Ovechkin's second goal in the Capitals vs. Thrashers game was his 60th career goal. It also mentions that he was the first Capitals player to reach 60 goals in a single season since 1995-96, when Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux were playing. Therefore, the question asking which player reached 60 goals in that game refers to Alex Ovechkin."
ယေးငိုၼ်း Northern Rock လူဝ်ႇတၢင်းၵမ်ႉၸွႆႈတီႈ လူင်ပွင်ၸိုင်ႈၼၼ်ႉ မိူဝ်ႈၶၢဝ်းလႂ်?,"The correct answer is **B: မိူဝ်ႈယေးငိုၼ်းထုၵ်ႇၸႅၵ်ႇဢွၵ်ႇတီႈ ၶမ်ႇပၼီႇ ၸတ်းသၢင်ႈၼမ်ႉတွၼ်း (When the bank was split into a bad bank)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""In 2010, after the government intervened in the banking crisis, the high street bank Northern Rock plc, as it existed then, was split into a bad bank, Northern Rock (the banking operations), and a good bank.""

This directly answers the question of when Northern Rock was separated from the government's support. Options A and C are incorrect because the separation happened *before* Virgin took over the good bank. Option D describes the *cause* of the crisis (subprime mortgage failures), not the event of Northern Rock being split.

This directly identifies Australia as the country that took action to address the perceived threat from the Y2K bug.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: America** - The passage refers to Australia, not the United States.
* **B: India** -  India isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: China** - China isn't mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The text states that the political leadership of the United States (specifically referring to the government) declared that the reliance on foreign nations for vital resources could lead to the collapse of the political system. Option B directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: မိူင်းႁူမ်ႈတုမ်ဢမႄးရီးၵႃး (United States):** While the text is about the United States, the question asks *what* the political leadership declared *would collapse*.

*   **D: ယိူင်းမၢႆလွင်ႈသူင်ႇဢွၵ်ႇ ၶွင်ၼႂ်းမိူင်း (Domestic Independence):** This is the *opposite* of what the text suggests. The text warns against *lack* of independence from foreign nations.

Therefore, Option B is the only option that accurately reflects what the political leadership declared would collapse according to the text."

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Mick O'Flynn (Acting Director Park Conservation and Heritage of NPWS) emphasized the importance of conservation of heritage and natural resources to the Thai volunteers.
* The hunting program is linked to the conservation and heritage efforts of NPWS.
* The volunteers were trained on conservation and display techniques.

Therefore, option B best reflects the approach to engaging the Thai volunteers, as highlighted in the text.

Here's why:

The text mentions that initially, small sleepers (sleepers with small notches) were used on the railroad tracks in England starting around 1767.  The text also indicates that the problem of the tracks bending and breaking was addressed by using small sleepers. Therefore, the introduction of sleepers is closely linked to the development of railroad tracks.

*   **A: မႆႉၵၢင်ႇ သဵင်ႈတၢင်းလူတ်ႉၾႆး (Wooden sleepers, railway tracks)**: While wooden sleepers are used, the text emphasizes"

Here's why:

* The passage states that Romanticism emphasized **introspection (ၽိင်ႈထုင်း)** and the inner world as a source of creativity for writers. 
* It mentions how the rocky landscapes inspired a sense of unity and how the reverence for nature and the solitary life connected to the mountains were expressed in writings.
* The passage directly links the Romantic period with introspection as a key characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: လၵ်းမိူင်း (Nationalism):** While Romanticism *could* sometimes coincide with nationalism, the passage doesn't primarily focus on nationalism.
* **B: ပၢႆးလႅင်ႊမိူင်း (Patriotism):** Similar to nationalism, patriotism isn't the central theme discussed.
* **D: ၽိင်ႈငႄႈ (Reverence/Veneration):** Reverence for nature is mentioned, but it's presented as connected to introspection, not as the defining characteristic of the period.

* **Question Q asks what the stone remains signify about the evolution of feet.** The answer needs to relate the stone remains back to the process of how those remains were formed.

* **""ၸႅင်ႈဢွၵ်ႇပၼ် (Zႅင်ႈဢွၵ်ႇပၼ်)""** means ""to separate/divide and give"" which fits the context of separating something and distributing it.

* **C: လႅၵ်ႈလၢႆႇၾၢင်ႁၢင် ၸႆႉ (Lႅၵ်ႈလၢႆႇၾၢင်ႁၢင် ၸႆႉ)** - This translates to ""to change the form of the spiritual."" This focuses on transformation rather than separation.

It highlights how zoom lenses can replicate the image quality of prime lenses and offer flexibility in shooting.  It also mentions that zoom lenses often have a wide zoom range, which is beneficial for adapting to different shooting situations. Furthermore, zoom lenses are advantageous because they can be used for short-distance shooting, even without a lens adapter or flash. The core point is the zoom lens's versatility.

The passage states that the *Juwansamait* folding method was created in the 1970s to help people *without* folding skills or with *insufficient* folding tools.  It also highlights that a particular folding method allows for *divided, patterned* folds.  

Option D directly addresses this by saying that the folding method *must* include thick paper and a cutting board. This is necessary for achieving the divided, patterned folds, especially for those who lack proper tools.

* **A: ၶတ်းၸႂ်တႃႇလႆႈတူဝ်ထူပ်း တူပ်းၸေႈ (Decide to get folding tools):** While getting tools might *help*, it doesn't describe the core method that allows for the specific, divided folds. The passage is about the folding technique itself.

The passage describes theการณ์ (event) as a power struggle involving the party leadership (ၸုမ်းၵူၼ်းႁဵတ်းၵၢၼ် ၶွင် Krushchev). The passage then mentions Krushchev wanting to remove the ""trouble"" and promoting Wladyslaw Gomulka, a well-known figure, to become the new party leader.

The text states that Krushchev initially tried to suppress the unrest but then, faced with economic problems and popular discontent, he had to allow Wladyslaw Gomulka, a popular figure, to become the new leader.  The passage directly links Gomulka's rise to the unrest and Krushchev's inability to control it.

The text describes how Germany's defeat in WWII led to a political division between the USSR and the USA. This division manifested in the Cold War, characterized by proxy wars and a long period of tension. The text directly links the political division arising from WWII to the subsequent Cold War.

* **Option B (""ထိင်းလွင်ႈလိူတ်ႈလႆထိူင်း"" - Applying the method within the body)** directly reflects this core message.

* The passage also says the temple was finally rebuilt in 323 BCE, *after* Alexander the Great died.

This indicates that evidence of bipedalism (walking on two legs) in *Australopithecus* fossils was found between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago. Since option D (4.2 million years ago) is the earliest time frame mentioned, it's the most accurate choice.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes early hominins** (like *Sahelanthropus*, *Australopithecus*, and *Sahelanthropus*) as being the first to develop bipedalism (walking upright).
* **The question asks about animals that walked upright and cultivated land.**  Early hominins, while not cultivating land in the way modern humans do, represent the origin of the lineage that eventually led to humans, who *do* cultivate land.  The passage connects early hominins with the development of bipedalism, a key characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၶိူဝ်းၵူၼ်းၵဝ်ႉငဝ်ႈသေပိူၼ်ႈ (Modern humans)**:  While modern humans are bipedal and cultivate land, the passage is about *early* hominins, not modern humans.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Q** describes the ziggurat as a temple complex where sacrifices were performed. 
* **A** asks about a place that Babylonian people didn't often record. 
* The text mentions that the ""ti dzik tong thung an"" (the pure and sacred place) was for the ""phu chao"" (gods), implying sacrifices were performed there. 
* Sacrifices were likely performed **inside the temple** (ngoin thi thut mae) and the **place of sacrifice** (ti phang pua) would be something less commonly recorded in official records.

* **The passage describes ziggurats as central structures of the temples.**
* **It specifically mentions that the temples had large, open courtyards and spacious interiors where the deity could reside.**
* **The passage details the significance of the inner area as a sacred space for the deity.**

The term ""ziggurat"" itself refers to a stepped pyramid-like structure that housed the temple and was considered a sacred space within the temple complex. Therefore, the answer ""inside the ziggurat"" aligns with the information presented in the passage.

The question asks what Homer *didn't* use. The text states that Homer wrote the epic poems Iliad and Odyssey. The options relate to actions one might take with a book. ""Thwam"" (ထွမ်ႇ) means ""to forget"" or ""to not use"". Since the question asks what Homer *didn't* use, ""thwam"" is the most appropriate answer. The other options refer to actions you *would* do with a book (read, look at, study, manage).

Therefore, the answer is **A: ထွမ်ႇ**.

Here's why:

* The question asks about pH levels in the opening of the stomach.
* The provided text explains that pH measures acidity. Lower pH indicates higher acidity (more hydrogen ions).
* The text states that hydrochloric acid (HCl) is a strong acid that helps to dissolve food. It also mentions that HCl creates a very acidic environment within the stomach.
* Therefore, ""excessive hydrogen ions"" accurately describes the highly acidic conditions in the stomach's opening, which is crucial for digestion.

pH is a measure of the acidity or alkalinity of a solution, and it is directly related to the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) and hydroxide ions (OH-).  The passage explains that hydrogen ions (H+) are responsible for the acidity of a solution.

Therefore, pH is the measurement that indicates the concentration of hydrogen ions, which are responsible for the release of hydrochloric acid (HCl).

Here's why:

* The passage describes the cat's historical role as a predator of rodents (rats and mice).
* The question asks what the *pangtai* (likely a term for a specific type of cat) was used for.
* The passage states that the *pangtai* was used to control the rat population, which was harmful to rice crops.
* This aligns with the description of a ""middle cat"" - not as small as a kitten, but not as large as a fully grown cat.  Middle cats are often effective at controlling rodent populations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: မႅဝ်ဢွၼ်ႇ (Domestic cat):** While domestic cats also control rodents, the passage focuses on the historical role of a specific type of cat (the *pangtai*) and doesn't explicitly say it was a domestic cat.  ""Middle cat"" is a more descriptive term in this context.
* **B: မႅဝ်လူင် (Large cat):** The passage describes the *pangtai* as not being as large as a fully grown cat.
* **D: ၵႂၢင်ပၢင်ႇ (Wild cat):** While the *pangtai* was a wild cat, the passage emphasizes its role in agricultural pest control, rather than simply its wild nature.

* **The question asks what tigers eat.**
* **""ပၢင်တၢႆး"" is the term used in the passage to describe what tigers eat.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The passage states that the meow of a domestic cat is not the same as the roar of a lion, but it is similar to the sound of a gentle purr or a soft meow. The question asks which of the options is *not* associated with the sound of a powerful lion. Since the passage focuses on the *sound* of the domestic cat, and compares it to the lion's roar, the sound of meowing is the most relevant option. The passage explicitly contrasts the domestic cat's meow with the lion's roar.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: လွင်ႈၶိုၼ်ႈတူၼ်ႈမႆႉ (Logging)**: This has nothing to do with the sound of a lion.
*   **C: လွင်ႈၵျွၵ်းဝႅၼ် (Hunting)**: Lions are hunters, and hunting can involve sounds, but it's not the *sound* itself.
*   **D: လွင်ႈတိုတ်ႉၸၼ် (Social interaction/bonding)**: Lions do social bonding, and this can involve sounds, but again, it's not the sound itself.

Therefore, the answer is **A**."

This translates to: ""The domestic cat is an animal that meows. The sound of the domestic cat's meow is not like the full cry of the wild cat, but it is similar to a purr and a meow.""

Therefore, the description of the domestic cat's meow directly relates to the options provided.  The other options are not mentioned in the text as characteristics that distinguish domestic cats from wild cats.

Option D, ""မီးလဵပ်ႉတိၼ်လႅမ်ငွင်ႉ (Have reptiles),"" is the most relevant connection. Dinosaurs are reptiles. The passage explicitly states that Nook is similar to a dinosaur, implying it shares reptilian characteristics.

The question asks what the creatures of the past and other animals could eat from the cycads.  The passage then goes on to say the cycads had tough, strong tissues, so it wasn't possible to say that dinosaurs could eat them, but that solitary dinosaurs and other animals like *Tyrannosaurus* (like crocodile dinosaurs) could eat the young leaves or even the branches.

It also mentions that the trees were very resilient, and it wasn't considered to be a definitive answer that dinosaurs could eat them, as the lone dinosaurs and other species of the past (like small dinosaurs) could eat the young trees or shrubs.

The passage describes how the blades of ice skates are designed with a curve and a heel-toe bevel. This design causes the skater to naturally lean and turn in the direction they want to go.

* Option B directly states this production of photons.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

Here's why:

The text explains that atoms emit photons (light particles) when they are influenced by external energy, specifically in a process called ""fuorrun"" (likely a transliteration of ""fluoron,"" which is related to fluorescence and emission). The text mentions that the photons are a result of atoms being excited by gaining energy from photons. This excitement is a result of the influence of external radiation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ႁဵတ်းဢွၵ်ႇဢဵၼ်ႁႅင်း (emitting energy)** - While emitting energy is part of the process, it's not the *cause* of the photon emission. The energy has to come from an external source.

* This electricity can cause the filament to overheat and burn, potentially leading to a fire.
* Option D directly states that the electrical current (power) enters the filament chamber, causing a short circuit (ထိူင်းၵႃႇ). A short circuit is exactly what can happen when electricity flows through an unintended path.

The passage describes the lunar maria (dark areas) as being on the ""sāmnan"" (near/distant) side of the Moon, specifically mentioning a distance of about 70,000 km. The maria are also described as being in the ""nīuဝ်ၽၢႆႇဢၼ်ၸမ်ၸမ်ၼၼ်ႉ"" (near side).

The text states that the receding of the waning moon gradually supported Copernicus's theory that the planets revolve around the sun.  This implies that the observation of the moon's recession was *evidence* or *support* for Copernicus's ideas. ""Grant to the scientist"" best captures this idea of providing support or evidence to a scientist's theory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ဢၼ်မၢင်ႈၽၢၵ်ႇ လူၵ်ႈသုၵ်း (The scientist's view):** This option describes the scientist's perspective, not the process of how the observation *influenced* Copernicus's theory.

* Option A (""မႄႈၼမ်ႉယၢဝ်းလိူဝ်ပိူၼ်ႈ (Is a long river)"") is accurate but doesn't capture the overwhelming emphasis on the *vastness* of the river.

It also talks about ""ႁႅင်းဢၼ်ႁဵတ်းႁႂ်ႈ မိူဝ်ႈတွမ်ႇတွမ်ႇထၢတ်ႈ hydrogen မႃး"" (energy that makes deuterium fuse).
* **Atomic fusion is the process:** Atomic fusion is the process where atomic nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, releasing a tremendous amount of energy. This is precisely what the passage describes.
* **The passage mentions the challenges:** The passage highlights the difficulty in achieving and sustaining nuclear fusion, mentioning that a viable and sustainable nuclear fusion reactor is still far off.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **D: သၢႆႁႅင်း (Energy):** While the passage discusses energy, it focuses on the *source* of that energy (nuclear fusion), not energy in a general sense.

The answer is that Marshal Italo Balbo (who was a significant figure and connected to the 9th Division's operations) was killed in action at Tobruk.  While the 9th division commander isn't explicitly stated as being killed at Tobruk, the text links Balbo's death to the fighting around Tobruk.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate based on the given information.  Option A is incorrect because he was *killed*, not simply detained.

However, his association with these bhajans, particularly in the context of film and public performance, has been questioned and linked to issues of caste and social hierarchy in India.  He's faced criticism for potentially perpetuating caste-based stereotypes or representing a particular caste in a way that reinforces social inequalities.

This translates to: ""Even on roller coasters, the situation of people being trapped will happen sooner or later; they will not have the opportunity to escape.

* **""ပွၺ်းၶႄႇမၢၵ်ႇလင်ႊလွမ်ႊ"" (Fighting for survival)** best captures the feeling of fans struggling to get answers and potentially having their plans disrupted, which aligns with the passage's description of their frustration and the organizers' inaction.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ၼေလွင်ႈၽၢမ်းတႃ (Transportation issues):** While transportation *could* be a factor, the passage focuses on the lack of information and organized response from the event organizers.
* **C: ပၢင်ပွၺ်းႁွင်ႉၵႂၢမ်း (Calling for help):**  The passage doesn't explicitly state fans were calling for help, though frustration certainly implies a desire for resolution.
* **D: ပၢင်ပွၺ်းႁႃ ငိုၼ်းၵွင်ၵၢင် (Searching for money):** This is completely unrelated to the situation described.

* **C: လွင်ႈထတ်းသၢင် လၵ်းထၢၼ်ၶႄးမီး (Parallel lines)** - While parallel lines might be an example of things being similar, the passage focuses on the active *imitation* process.

Option A states that the victim was found with a note detailing his identity and had been shot with a gun. This information is *already* included in the Xinhua report.

Options B, C, and D describe events mentioned *in* the Xinhua report:

*   **B: ႁိူဝ်းမိၼ်ၵိုတ်းလူင်း တီႈ Ürümqi (The victim was arrested in Ürümqi):**  The report mentioned the victim's trip to Afghanistan after failing to gain entry into Ürümqi.

*   **D: ပိူင်ပဵၼ်ၵူၼ်းပဵၼ်မိူဝ်ႈလဵဝ် (The evolution of humans):** The passage doesn't discuss human evolution.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Lao people have the ability to create and use spiritual objects that can influence and strengthen the spirit.  This is seen as admirable by business people.  The passage also mentions that the current earth we live on was created by a previous civilization, and the Lao people's abilities are a later development.  

Therefore, the business people are interested in the Lao's ability because it relates to the *loss of the original form of the earth* and the subsequent creation and manipulation of spiritual power. Option A directly addresses this concept of the earth's original form being altered and the resulting phenomenon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: လွင်ႈၶွတ်ႇပဵၼ် ပရူဝ်ႇတဵင်း (The phenomenon of creation of artificial intelligence):**  While creation is involved, the passage doesn't focus on artificial intelligence.

* **D: လွင်ႈၶွတ်ႇပဵၼ် လူၵ်ႈၵမ်ႇၾႃႇ (The phenomenon of the creation of the human race):** While related to creation, the passage's focus is more on the alteration of the earth's original state and the spiritual abilities developed after a previous civilization.

Option B, ""ၶဝ်တႅပ်းတတ်း တႃႇသိုပ်ႇႁဵတ်းၵၢၼ်ၵႂႃႇ"" (they are working to continue the investigation), best encapsulates the overall context of the passage.

The options describe characteristics of Karenia brevis itself (its species, its ability to harm humans, its cell structure, and its response to environmental factors). Therefore, the thing that is *not* harmful to Karenia brevis is simply that it's an algae species, which is a factual description and not a harmful element.

Option D, ""ၼမ်ႉလူၵ်ႈထူမ်ႈတၢင်း"" (flooding), is the only option that is *not* mentioned as occurring in the text.  The text mentions rain, flooding of the Oahu breakwater to 6.34 feet, and the presence of strong winds and heavy rain, but *not* flooding of buildings.



Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: ၽွၼ်းယွၼ်ႉၾူၼ်လူမ်း (Storm damage):**  The entire passage is about the damage caused by the storm.

Here's why:

The passage states that the incident occurred after Fernando Alonso had to retire from the race. The incident involved a deliberate re-introduction of fuel into the pit lane during the Hungarian Grand Prix 2009, which caused a crash and allowed Piquet Jr. to recover. This happened *after* Alonso's retirement.

* **B: မိူဝ်ႈၽွင်း လူတ်ႉတၢင်ႇလမ်းတိုၵ်ႉထႅမ်ၼမ်ႉမၼ်း (When the car was forced to re-introduce fuel)** - While this describes the *action* that caused the incident, it doesn't specify *when* it happened in relation to Alonso's retirement.

Here's why:

* The passage states that scientists have observed the evolution of finches over the past two centuries.
* They've classified this evolution as a long-term process.
* This long-term process is attributed to the divergence within the Darwin finch population, specifically between *Geospiza fortes* and the solitary cactus finch *Geospiza conirostris*.
* The key point is that this divergence happened *between* different finch populations, showing a *differentiation* or *separation* within the finch species.

* **A: လွင်ႈဢၼ်လႂ်လႆႈဢဝ်ၶၢဝ်းယၢမ်းဢႄႇသေ ဢၼ်ၽူႈၶူၼ်ႉၶဝ်ယုမ်ႇယမ်ဝႆႉ?** (The reason why it's a long-term process that scientists have observed) This is too general. The passage explains *why* it's a long-term process, not just stating it.
* **B: လၢႆးငၢႆးလွင်ႈသတ်ႉတဝႃႇ** (Easy evolution of finches) The passage indicates it's a *long-term* process, not an easy one.
* **D: လွင်ႈလႅၵ်ႈလၢႆႈ သတ်ႉတဝႃႇ** (Evolution of finches) While evolution is happening, the passage specifically highlights the *separation* or *divergence* between finch populations as the key to the long-term evolutionary process.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that scientists from Princeton and Uppsala University have demonstrated the **long-term evolution** of these finches over the past two centuries. 
*  The passage details how the finches have adapted due to geographical isolation and competition between species like Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
* Options A, C, and D are not the central focus of what the scientists have investigated or demonstrated in the passage. While the passage mentions new species (C) and that birds are involved in speciation (D), the primary emphasis is on the *evolutionary changes* over time (B).

Therefore, option B best captures the core finding of the research described in the passage.

The text states that 7 Il-76s were destroyed in a single crash in July, and later, Russia had to scrap a significant number of Il-76s. This happened ""following the failed incident."" The question asks why Russia started to withdraw from using the Il-76S.  The text implies the crashes were due to something that made it economically unviable, and the most likely reason for a military to withdraw from equipment after a series of failures is budget cuts.

The text states that the positive outcomes for sex workers are due to the ""care and encouragement given to them, especially by men and women who specially support them.""  Option D directly reflects this.

* **A: မေႃယႃ (Doctors):** While doctors are part of the healthcare system, the text doesn't emphasize doctors as the primary source of positive outcomes for sex workers.
* **B: ၼၢင်းယိင်း ၵၢၼ်တူင်ႉၼိုင်ၽၢႆႇပၢႆးယူႇလီ (Women in nine fields of socio-economic activities):** This is too broad. The text specifically points to support *given to* sex workers, not just women involved in various activities.

Here's why:

The passage states that women didn't feel satisfaction from the things they received in the past due to the lack of kindness and encouragement from men, especially men and boys.  It mentions that special efforts by men led to women feeling fulfilled in their nursing work.

Therefore, the ""special efforts"" referred to are specifically those made by men (ၵူၼ်းၸၢႆး).

The text states that the extracted cell can be used to create a test for diseases like cancer, diabetes, HIV, and hepatitis for people in wealthy countries. The cell is obtained from a specific source (implied to be a certain type of waste product based on the context) and the key to using it lies in the cell itself.

This translates to: ""Pittman said that the climate will not change much even in the future. Based on Pittman's statement, the increasing trend in ocean temperatures is a gradual decline over the past 15 years for the sake of human beings.""

The passage specifically links the ""increasing trend in ocean temperatures"" to ""gradual decline"" which is related to a warming climate (climate change). Option A, ""ငဝ်းလၢႆးၾိင်ႈၾႃႉႁၢႆႉၸႃႉ (Warming climate)"" most accurately reflects this connection.

The other options are incorrect:

Here's why:

The passage highlights Roberts' careful maneuvering around the Roe v. Wade decision. He doesn't overturn Roe directly but suggests that the right to abortion is a matter for individual states to decide. This approach demonstrates **judicial prudence** - the Supreme Court's tendency to consider the practical consequences of its decisions and to avoid making sweeping changes to established legal principles. Roberts is essentially trying to maintain the stability of the legal system while still achieving his desired outcome (shifting the power to regulate abortion to the states).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: လွင်ႈဢုပ်ႇဢူဝ်းသိုဝ်ႈသႂ် (Political maneuvering):** While there is certainly a political aspect to Roberts' decision, the passage emphasizes his legal reasoning and the practical implications of his approach, not just political calculations.
* **C: လွင်ႈတႄႇတင်ႈၸၢတ်ႈပၢၼ် (Starting a new era):** Roberts is not trying to start a new era. He is attempting a more gradual and pragmatic shift in the legal landscape.
* **D: သုၼ်ႇႁဵတ်းပုၼ်ႈၸဝ်ႈၵဝ်ႇ (Acting on a principle):** While principles are involved, Roberts' actions are driven by a complex interplay of legal prudence and the practical consequences of his"

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Roberts strongly criticized the precedent set by Roe v. Wade, calling it ""a deeply flawed constitutional decision."" He argued that the right to abortion was not constitutionally protected and that Roe was an overreach of judicial power.  The entire passage revolves around Roberts' disagreement with Roe v. Wade and his attempts to overturn it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: လွင်ႈသၢင်ႇတေႃဢၼ်လုမ်းတတ်းသိၼ် တတ်း (Judicial precedent):** While Roe *is* a judicial precedent, the passage focuses on Roberts' specific criticism *of* that precedent.
* **C: သုၼ်ႇႁဵတ်းပုၼ်ႈၸဝ်ႈၵဝ်ႇထၢင်ႇထိူမ် (Originalism):** While Roberts is often associated with originalism, the passage highlights his specific disagreement with Roe, not his broader judicial philosophy.
* **D: လွင်ႈတၢင်းၼမ်ဢၼ်ယွႆႈ (Political maneuvering):** The passage focuses on the legal and constitutional arguments, not on political strategy.

This translates to: ""Two tall cranes were towering into the sky. The place there was also undergoing construction of gleaming new skyscrapers, with five high-rise buildings, plus office buildings and plans for a business district in the middle.""

The text also mentions ""ႁိူဝ်းဝိၼ်ၵျႅတ်ႉဢွၼ်တၢင်းသုတ်း"" (Westside viaduct).  The cranes are located *near* the Westside viaduct, and the skyscrapers are being built *in the middle* of the area near the viaduct.  Therefore, option C is the most accurate.

The passage states: ""မႅၼ်ႈမိူဝ်ႈယၢမ်းၵၢင်ၼႂ် 8:46 ၼၼ်ႉလီလီ..."" which translates to ""At 8:46 a.m. exactly...""  Therefore, the skyscrapers were visible at that specific time.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Glen Cushing, of the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and a professor at Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, said the wood is **not like that of a typical stump**, but **resembles that of rock**.""  This directly connects the wood's appearance to rock-like fractures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: တၢင်းၵႂၢင်ႈႁူးၶဝ်ႈထမ်ႈ (The breadth of entering the stump):** The text doesn't mention the width of the stump's entrance.
*   **C: ထတ်းသၢင်ၽႅၼ်ႇလိၼ် (The slope of the terrain):** The text discusses the wood's similarity to rock, not the terrain's slope.

The passage states that the ""seasonal changes in vegetation"" are visible using infrared imagery.  It also mentions that the trees lose their leaves in the summer and regrow them in the fall, which creates these visible changes.  The passage then goes on to discuss how these changes are different from those in dense forests.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ႁူးလိုၵ်ႉၼိူဝ်လိၼ် (Surface erosion):** While erosion can occur, the passage focuses on changes in vegetation, not erosion patterns.
*   **C: တၢင်းၵႂၢင်ႈထမ်ႈ (Vastness of the plateau):** The passage mentions the plateau's vastness but doesn't claim it *creates* the visible changes.
*   **D: လဵပ်ႈႁဵၼ်းထမ်ႈၼိူဝ်လိၼ်မိူင်း (Studying vegetation on land):**  This is about studying the vegetation, not *what* creates the visible changes in the vegetation.

Here's why:

* **The scenario describes a situation where someone is falsely accused of a crime (related to a drug) and then repeatedly slandered.**  The authorities haven't confirmed the accused's identity publicly, but have identified their ethnic group (Uighur).
* **Defamation** involves damaging someone's reputation through false statements.  
* **Repeated slandering** (ဢွၼ်တၢင်းလႄႈလိုၼ်းသုတ်း) emphasizes the ongoing nature of the false accusations.
* **Option A** is incorrect because it refers to the suppression of the perpetrator's activities, which isn't the primary issue in the text.
* **Option B** is too narrow. While the accused is Uighur, the core of the issue is the false accusations and defamation, not just their ethnicity.
* **Option C** is a bit vague. While there's conflict, the focus is on the defamation and false accusations, not just the conflict itself.

Here's why:

The text states that Chiao and Sharipov claimed to have maintained a precise distance to overcome the problem of the gyroscope spinning during the construction of the space station.  The key to solving the problem was maintaining a specific, precise distance between the components.  Options B, C, and D are incorrect because the text doesn't say a gyroscope was given, a rocket was used, or a dream was recreated.

The text clearly states that the tsunami didn't occur because the earthquake's magnitude wasn't strong enough (less than 6.5 on the Richter scale). Therefore, the agency didn't need to issue a warning.

* **Rossby Number (မၢႆ Rossby):** The passage mentions that Rossby waves of a certain length are linked to a specific vorticity and Rossby number.
* **Rossby Waves (လွင်ႈပၼ်ႇ):** The passage highlights the relationship between intensity and Rossby waves, and the Rossby number is a key factor in determining the characteristics of these waves.

This indicates that the recovery period was approximately three months. The text also mentions he had to undergo surgery and was struggling to return to the court.  The timeframe of ""6 to 6 months of rest"" strongly suggests a recovery time of roughly three months.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Del Potro had a shoulder injury (""ၼႂ်းၸုပ်ႈဢၼ်တေတႅတ်းသိၼ်ၸႂ်ၽႂ်​ပႄႉၽႂ်သုမ်း"") and that after 6-6, he had to take care of the injury (""ဝၢႆးသေႁွတ်ႈထိုင် 6 တေႃႇ 6 ၵူၺ်ၼႃႇ လူဝ်ႇလႆႈထိင်းသိမ်းလွင်ႈပဵင်းၵၼ် ႁၢၼ်ႉတေႃႇထိုင်ႇၶၢဝ်းလိုဝ်ႈယူႇ"").
* The passage also mentions he sought medical treatment (""Potro လႆႈႁပ်ႉၵၢၼ်ယူတ်းယႃတီႈႁူဝ်မႃႇသေတႃႇ"").
*  While Murray is mentioned, the reason for Del Potro losing isn't attributed to Murray's performance. It's directly tied to his injury.



The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Murray ႁႂ်ႈႁၢႆမိူဝ်ႈၵူႈဢွၼ်တၢင်း (Murray caused Del Potro to lose every time):** The passage doesn't suggest Murray deliberately caused Del Potro to lose.
* **C: Murray ပေႉၵႂႃႇမိူဝ်ႈၵမ်းထီႈသွင် (Murray lost at the second game):**  The passage doesn't state Murray lost at the second game.
* **D: Del Potro ပေႉၵႂႃႇမိူဝ်ႈၵမ်းထီႈသွင် (Del Potro lost at the second game):** The passage indicates Del Potro lost *because* of the injury, not necessarily at the second game.  The passage mentions the problem started around the 6-6 mark.

This means the official (ၽူႈၽွင်းငမ်း) is the one who needs to be persuaded to act in a certain way. The official's ""tính cách"" (character/nature) is described as being strong, and they want to influence the official to act according to their desires.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that Stephen Colbert and Al Gore (and General Tommy Franks) gained fame through *The Onion*. Colbert's satirical news persona on *The Colbert Report* was heavily influenced by the style and humor of *The Onion*. While the other options might have contributed to the broader satirical landscape, Colbert's show is the most directly linked to *The Onion's* influence on mainstream news satire.

The passage describes The Onion as a satirical news website. The question asks what *isn't* a part of The Onion's content. A website itself is the platform *for* The Onion's content, so it wouldn't be considered a part of the *content* itself. The other options (a kitten atlas, a rubber duck, and a bizarre writing style) are all examples of the satirical content The Onion creates.

Therefore, the protestors left Whitehall around 11:20. The question asks when the protestors marched, and the text describes their march starting around 11:20."

Here's why:

Dr. Ehud Ur stated that the immune response is a normal occurrence and that the observed immune response level 1 is not linked to the top immune-related pathogen (immune-related marker 1). He essentially said it's a normal bodily function. Option A reflects this by saying it's a result of the human body.

Here's why:

The question asks what Dr. Ur stated according to the text. The text says: ""...the phenomenon is likely to be coincidental. Like a lottery winner, he may feel a penchant for the fact that the cure for cancer he has seen is not linked to the number 1 cancer patient.""

This means Dr. Ur stated that the coincidence (the cure being linked to a non-number 1 cancer patient) is likely unrelated to the most common cancer patient. Option A captures this accurately.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ၸွမ်းၼင်ႇလိၵ်ႈလၢႆး၊ Dr. Ur ထၢင်ႇပိူင်ႈသင်?** (According to the text, what did Dr. Ur say?) This is the question itself, not an answer.

This indicates that the tire *had* broken before, and Franciszek Kowal found a way to break it *again* to get out. Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: မၼ်းႁဵတ်းႁႂ်ႈ ႁူးလႅင်းတႅၵ်ႇ (He made the tire break)** - While he ultimately helped break the tire again, the passage implies it already broke beforehand.
* **C: မၼ်းဢဝ်တင်ႇလႅဝ် မိူဝ်ႈမၼ်းတေလုၵ်ႉ (He took the lever when he was going)** - The passage doesn't mention a lever.
* **D: မၼ်းလႆႈတၢင်းၸဵပ်း မိူဝ်ႈမၼ်းဝတ်း တင်ႇၵႃႇတီႈ ႁူးလႅင်း (He found a way to break it when he was walking on the tire)** - The passage mentions he found a way *after* the tire had already broken (beforehand).

The news report states that European countries are concerned about the consequences of the US troop withdrawal. This indicates that Europe is the entity watching the situation for potential repercussions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Syria:** While Syria is directly affected by the ISIS situation, the news focuses on the *European* concern about the broader implications of the US withdrawal.
*   **C: United States:** The US is the one withdrawing troops, not the entity concerned about the consequences.
*   **D: Turkey:** Turkey is involved in the fight against ISIS and has a relationship with the US and Erdoğan, but the main focus of the news is on the European reaction.

Therefore, Europe is the region that is watching the situation closely for potential consequences."

Here's why:

The passage states that the conflict occurred in mountainous terrain. It then says, ""To find a fortified place to attack, they fought fiercely across the dry and barren land.""  ""Harsh land"" directly implies a difficult, dry, and barren environment, consistent with the description.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ၾႆးႁႃၶဵၼ် (Searching for fire)** - While fire might be important, the passage focuses on the *environment* that made the conflict difficult.
* **C: လိၼ်ဢၼ်ၵုမ်းထိင်းဝႆႉ (Well-cultivated land)** - This is the opposite of what the passage describes.  The land is ""dry and barren.""
* **D: ၾိင်ႈၾႃႉဢမ်ႇလီ (Unforgiving weather)** -  While weather is a factor, the passage emphasizes the *land itself* as a difficult obstacle.

Therefore, ""Harsh land"" best captures the reason for the losses described in the passage."

(Coalition forces and Afghan security forces entered the land to reclaim territory, and coalition forces were ordered to provide assistance.)

The question asks what is being lost due to the conflict.  The text emphasizes the involvement and assistance of the coalition forces. Therefore, the coalition is the entity linked to the loss being described.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ႁႃၶဵၼ် (Workers):** While workers might be affected by conflict, the text doesn't directly link the loss to workers.
* **B: ၵႅမ်း (Camels):** Camels might be used for transportation in the region, but the text doesn't mention them in relation to the loss.
* **D: ႁၢဝ်းလွၺ် (Thunder):** Thunder is a natural phenomenon related to the weather, but the text connects the losses to military conflict and terrain.

This refers to the **huckleberry** (a type of fish) becoming endangered.

The question asks what caused the formation of the **huckleberry** population. The answer is the decline in water levels, which led to the fish being trapped and unable to escape predation. The text says the water levels dropped significantly and officials planned to repair the dam to allow the fish to return.

Here's why:

* The text states that the U.S. is reportedly planning to use ""self-styled militias"" to carry out attacks and ""detonate bombs"" in Kenya and Ethiopia. 
* Option C accurately reflects this by saying the bombs will be detonated ""on the ground in both countries.""
* Option B is incorrect because it only mentions detonating bombs in two countries, which is not explicitly stated as simultaneous.
* Option A and D are incorrect because they mention detonating bombs ""on the ground"" in only one country or ""in the country,"" which doesn't align with the reported plan to use militias for attacks across both Kenya and Ethiopia.

* **The passage mentions that the market's website could offer a solution.** By checking the website, potential customers can find information about available goods, suppliers, and possibly even online ordering options.
* **Options A, B, and C are less directly relevant.** While finding a management office, identifying a central market location, and breaking down goods are all *potential* steps, they aren't the immediate, most practical action suggested by the passage.

The passage states that due to the similarity of items from different vendors, it's difficult to find items that are truly authentic. The passage then suggests that vendors need to find ways to differentiate their items to allow customers to easily identify authentic products and to further combat counterfeit goods.

Option B directly addresses this by suggesting that vendors need to **examine items in the market that are dissimilar**. This implies that by comparing and contrasting items, vendors can find ways to distinguish authentic products.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The text discusses the increasing need for office space due to the rise of remote work and flexible work arrangements. It also mentions the challenges of finding suitable office spaces that are easily accessible and can support activities like collaboration and meetings. The final paragraph talks about the difficulty in obtaining flexible office spaces and the current trend of large corporations increasingly focusing on flexible work environments.

* **A: သၢႆလူမ်းဢၼ်ပၼ်မၢႆမၼ်းၼမ် (A frequent flyer with many miles):** While frequent flyers often accumulate miles, the passage doesn't emphasize the *number* of miles as the defining characteristic. The *benefits* associated with the miles are more important.

* **Option C directly reflects this incompatibility.** It says ""လူၺ်ႈၶူင်ႇႁိူင်းဝိၼ် ဢမ်ႇမိူၼ်ၵၼ်"" (with incompatible partners).

* **Option A is a paraphrase** and doesn't specifically address the action of ""ဢွၵ်ႇတၢင်း"" (to be wary/to be cautious) as suggested by the question.
* **Option D is incomplete** and doesn't clearly state the relationship between the partners and the potential consequences.

Here's why:

The text describes how ancient temples were often built in remote or spacious locations, not in the city center.  They were also intentionally placed along easily accessible routes.  Modern temples, however, are increasingly built in areas with good views and convenient transportation.

The question asks where to look for temples to view. The text specifically mentions that ancient temples were often situated in scenic, remote locations. Option C, ""ဢွင်ႈတီႈလႅၼ်ႊ ပၢႆးပၺ်ႇၺႃႇ (Scenic location)"", aligns directly with this description.

It specifically mentions that Tamaki Drive (which includes St Heliers) is near Waitemata Harbor and Mission Bay.  The passage also states that St Heliers is a place for leisurely strolls and shopping.

While Mission Bay and the North Harbor District are also mentioned as locations with harbor walks, St Heliers is specifically cited as a desirable spot for short, easy walks. Waitemata Harbor is the overall harbor, not a specific location for a short walk.

The text specifically states: ""ၵမ်ႉပႃႈၼမ် တေပဵၼ်ၵူၼ်းၸိူဝ်းႁဵတ်းၵၢၼ်ငၢၼ်းၼႂ်းၵၢၼ်လဵင်ႉၵႆႇ..."" (Most often it affects people who work in poultry farming...). This directly aligns with option A.

* **B: လွင်ႈတၢင်းၵမ်ႈၼမ် ပွင်ႈၼႄၵူၼ်းသေၼူၵ်ႉ (Commonly affects humans and chickens):** While humans *can* get it, the text emphasizes the risk to poultry workers.

Here's why:

The passage explains that people often cross borders by train.  It also highlights the risks associated with this, particularly for those traveling on overnight trains where they might be vulnerable to theft.  The question asks what kind of train would allow travelers to avoid these risks.  Therefore, a ""cross-border train"" is the most relevant option because it directly relates to the context of international travel by train, which is the focus of the passage.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ႁိူဝ်းမိၼ်တင်းၼမ် (Most countries):** While many countries have trains, this doesn't specifically address the cross-border travel context.
*   **B: Night sleeper လူတ်ႉၽႆး (Night sleeper train):**  The passage focuses on the risks associated with *night sleeper* trains, not how to avoid them. It specifically says that night sleepers are more vulnerable to theft.
*   **C: သၢင်းၽူဝ်း (Conductor):** A conductor is a train employee, but they don't prevent theft or address the core issue of safe cross-border travel.

(Cross-border trains are often boarded by people who do not have the ability to monitor/observe and are therefore easily targeted by thieves.)

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the text's implication that those traveling on these trains are vulnerable because they lack the ability to observe their surroundings and protect their belongings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၶၢဝ်းမိူဝ်ႈတေၼိူဝ် လူႉၽႆးလူင်းမႃး (The news is about long-distance trains):**  While the text discusses long-distance trains, this option doesn't address the core vulnerability described.

Here's why:

The text states that Singapore is located near the equator. Because of this, it doesn't experience extreme seasons like tropical or temperate regions.  The phrase ""ၶၢမ်ႆၺႃး လွင်ႈႁိူဝ်ႈမႆႉ"" directly translates to ""must cross the tropics,"" which is a consequence of its equatorial location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၺႃးဢၼ်ယမ်းယိမ်း (Hot and humid)**: While Singapore is hot and humid, the text doesn't focus on this as the defining characteristic related to its location. It emphasizes the lack of extreme seasons.

*   **Variable speeds:**  Speeds are now more variable and dependent on factors like the Pennsylvania Wilds.
*   **Limited usage:** The route isn't as heavily used as other trails like the Pennsylvania Wilds.

Here's why:

* The passage states that while Chile declared independence in 1810, there was no significant victory against the Spanish until 1818. 
* The passage specifically mentions the Napoleonic Wars as a period of instability in Spain that prevented a central government from organizing a proper response for a few years.

* **Soil for clean land:** It repeatedly mentions creating soil suitable for planting and cultivating clean land.
* **Proper soil structure:** It discusses soil structure and the need for it to be suitable for the plants and land.
* **Drainage:** It mentions the importance of drainage and using materials like calcium chloride to improve it.
* **Soil amendments:** It talks about using soil amendments to improve"

Here's why:

* **Hoe (ၢႆး)** is a traditional tool used for weeding gardens. It's ideal for loosening the soil around plants and removing weeds, which helps improve drainage and reduces competition for nutrients and water.
* **Calcium chloride (ၵိူဝ်)** is used to firm up the soil and reduce dust, but it doesn't directly help with weeding.
* **Pickaxe (မၢၵ်ႇႁိၼ်ၽွင်)** is a heavy tool used for breaking up hard soil, not weeding.
* **Water (ၼမ်ႉ)** is essential for plant growth but doesn't directly help with weeding.

Therefore, the hoe is the most effective tool for weeding and improving drainage in a garden."

The most direct shared characteristic mentioned in the text is the presence of major islands. The other options aren't supported by the provided text.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ski hiking"" and ""Alpine style"" are related to skiing on groomed slopes, while ""Backcountry skiing"" involves venturing into ungroomed areas, often requiring traversing and crossing difficult terrain. The text highlights the challenges of backcountry skiing in terms of steep slopes, potential dangers, and the need for navigation. 
* **The text describes backcountry skiing as:** involving navigating through forests and ungroomed terrain with obstacles like rocks and roots. 
* **""Backcountry skiing"" directly relates to:** skiing in areas away from ski resorts, often requiring hiking and navigating steep, challenging terrain.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ski hiking:** This is described as being more similar to groomed ski slopes, not steep, ungroomed terrain.
* **C: Alpine style:**  This refers to skiing on groomed slopes with fixed pistes, not venturing into backcountry terrain.

* Humans initially didn't realize elk were a resource.
* Elk have since evolved to become more formidable.

This implies that humans need to change their approach (tactics) to avoid conflict with elk, rather than simply hoping for the best (B), ignoring the issue (D), or trying to capture and domesticate them (A).  The passage focuses on avoiding conflict, making option C the most relevant.

* The text describes how elk, due to their evolutionary history, are not aggressive. However, they will defend themselves if threatened.
* The text also states that humans didn't initially realize elk were a food source, but over time, elk evolved to become more robust.
* This perfectly illustrates the concept of ""survival of the fittest,"" where organisms with traits that help them survive and reproduce are more likely to pass those traits on.  Elk's increased robustness is a result of natural selection favoring those individuals.

The text states that Hypothermia can occur if people walk along unbroken icy paths, expend energy, and have existing body heat loss.  The key issue is a lack of body heat reserves.  Options B, C, and D all involve attempting to interact with the mirage itself, which is not a solution to the core problem of body heat loss.

*   Hypothermia is defined as a dangerous drop in body temperature.
*   The passage explicitly states that Hypothermia can be a fatal consequence if not treated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The text explains that if someone has a prescription for glasses, they should carry it with them when traveling. If they get new glasses in another country, the prescription for the original glasses becomes void. This is because the new glasses will be adjusted to their current vision.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the instrument's sound is produced. It mentions that the keys cause the strings to vibrate, and this vibration is amplified by the soundboard. To make the sound louder, the passage states that the soundboard is vibrated strongly, either with little or much force. 

Therefore, **ယွမ်းႁႅင်းတဵၵ်း (Strong vibration)** best describes the action needed to increase the volume of the instrument.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: တိူဝ်းဝႆး (Soft tone):** This is the opposite of what's needed to increase volume.

The text explains ""overscan"" as the excess border around the image in a TV screen that isn't intended to be part of the picture.  When you manually adjust the focus of your TV, overscan can become more noticeable.  The question asks what you can do about overscan.

The text describes how Gridley and Stark's forces built a breastwork (a low wall of earth and stone) on the high water level of the river. They also laid down a line of trees 100 yards (30 m) from the breastwork, stating that it would be difficult to overcome until the middle of the campaign. 

This indicates that they specifically built their defenses when the river was high to utilize the existing water level as part of their protection.

The question asks which period was a time of strong military power in China. The passage details the violent conflicts that characterized the Three Kingdoms period as leaders fought to gain control and eventually try to reclaim the capital city of Xi'an.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ပၢၼ်ႁေႃၶမ်းၸိၼ်း (The Jin Dynasty)** - While the Jin Dynasty was a significant period, the passage focuses on the preceding period of the Three Kingdoms.

* This implies that the ants *plan* their foraging routes and use a kind of ""map"" to navigate.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that **biological clocks** are internal oscillators that generate cycles. 
* It also mentions that these clocks are linked to various bodily processes like sleep, body temperature, and hormone release.
* The question asks what keeps an organism alive and regulates cycles.  Biological clocks fulfill both those roles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ဝူင်းပၼ်ႇၶွပ်ႈ (Circuits)** - While circuits are important for biological processes, they don't inherently regulate cyclical changes like biological clocks do.
* **B: ၵီးသဵင်ႁႆႇတိုင်ႈ (Constant sound)** - Constant sound doesn't explain the cyclical changes within an organism.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes amoebae:** The text talks about single-celled organisms that are initially morphologically similar (monomorphic) and can change shape to feed. This is a key characteristic of amoebae.
* **The question describes amoebae:** The question describes a single-celled organism with a changing, irregular shape.  This perfectly matches the behavior of amoebae.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the physical appearance (phenotype) of individuals within a species is often very similar, described as ""monomorphic."" However, it also mentions that there are subtle variations among them. These variations are related to the species' ability to adapt to their environment.

The question asks what is related to the environment that the nervous system of these creatures faces. The passage states that these variations are related to the ability to adapt. The physical variations, or head/body, are the part of the organism that directly faces and interacts with the environment. The nervous system processes information from the environment and coordinates responses, and its function is heavily influenced by the environment.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ႁႅင်းတွတ်ႇၽဵၼ်ႈ (Active force):** While force is involved in interaction with the environment, it doesn't directly relate to the body/head itself.

The text describes the activity of ""orangutans"" (specifically, the care and learning related to their environment) as a parallel to activities like ""enrichment, foraging, and learning about reproductive behavior in nature.""

Option B, ""ထၢႆႇၶႅပ်းႁၢင်ႊ မွၵ်ႉယႃႈထိူၼ်ႇ"" (Forest Canopy Bridging), directly relates to providing a more complex and stimulating environment for orangutans, mimicking their natural habitat and encouraging exploration, foraging, and learning. It's a form of environmental enrichment.

* It mentions people finding ways to adapt and create new social structures, but the core event is a massive loss of human life and the potential for human extinction.

**A: ၶွၵ်ႈတႂ်ႈလိၼ်**

**Explanation:**

The passage describes a scene where a person in a mid-ancient warship is deeply affected by the sounds of the waves hitting the ship's hull. They are so immersed in these sounds that they can almost feel the waves rising from the depths of the sea.

The question asks for something that is inseparable from the mid-ancient warship. The passage specifically mentions the ""hull"" (ၶွၵ်ႈ) of the ship and the ""waves rising from the depths"" (ၶွၵ်ႈတႂ်ႈလိၼ်). 

Therefore, ""ၶွၵ်ႈတႂ်ႈလိၼ်"" (waves rising from the depths) is the most inseparable element mentioned in the passage and relevant to a mid-ancient warship.

**Therefore, the correct answer is A: ၶွၵ်ႈတႂ်ႈလိၼ်.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Lord Hastings built Kirby Muxloe as a strategic location to suppress rebellions and control smaller, unruly groups. Option B accurately reflects this by saying that the kingdom needed a strong defensive system and to manage internal affairs. It aligns with the reason for building Kirby Muxloe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lord Hastings ယိုၼ်ႈယွၼ်းဝႆႉ ၽႃၼႃလူင် ႁူင်းႁေႃ** - While Lord Hastings built the hall, this option doesn't explain *why* he built it.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Lord Hastings built Kirby Muxloe in 1480 as a fortified structure to suppress rebellions and control local groups. The description highlights its defensive nature (""လွင်ႈၵၢၼ်ၶွတ်ႇၽွတ်ႈဢၼ်ၼိူင်ႈ တီႈဢၼ်ဝၢၼ်ႈမိူင်း လႆႈမီးလွင်ႈငမ်းယဵၼ်ၵဵဝ်ႇၵပ်းၸွမ်း"").

Here's why:

The passage states that even with a short distance (100 meters), there's a significant difference in speed and reaction time due to age differences. It also mentions that long-distance running and strength training are crucial for success.  

Option B directly reflects this by saying to continue training with an emphasis on age differences. This implies that training should be tailored to address the speed and reaction time discrepancies caused by age.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၽိုၵ်းလႅၼ်ႈပၼ်ႇမိူင်း မိဝ်ႈလိူၼ်ၶၢဝ်းၵတ်း (Train with an emphasis on the short distance in the rainy season)** - The passage focuses on age differences and long-distance preparation, not specific weather conditions.

* **The question asks what is indispensable for the poor so they can afford food.**  This directly relates to showing kindness and respect through providing necessary support.

This indicates that the children's reluctance to part with the treasure stems from a personal attachment and strong feelings for it.  Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: မၼ်းမီးလွင်ႈ ၽွၼ်းလီတေႉတေႉ (It has a fortunate aspect)** - The passage discusses the reluctance to part with the treasure *even if* they claim it's not fortunate, implying the opposite.

The passage describes people with a certain ""sharpness"" or ""keenness"" of mind. This sharpness allows them to:

* **Understand the hidden intentions of others:** They can see beyond surface-level actions and understand what people *really* want.
* **Analyze situations from multiple angles:** They are able to break down complex scenarios and see the various possibilities and potential outcomes.
* **Distinguish between genuine and insincere actions:** They can tell when someone is being sincere or manipulative.

* **The question asks what the Renaissance *didn't* manage to preserve.**  While the Renaissance brought about advancements in knowledge, the passage implies that something was lost or not adequately maintained.
* **Manuscript printing (C) directly relates to the revolution in knowledge.** It wasn't a preservation of something existing; it was a new process that fundamentally changed how information was produced and shared. The passage contrasts the pre-Renaissance world with the Renaissance world where manuscript printing arose.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

Options A, C, and D are not directly linked to fostering these social connections.

Option A, ""ႁႃတူၺ်းလႆၢးတူမ်ႈႁူင်ၽၵ်း"" (which translates to ""can find a group/community"") is the most relevant as it aligns with the text's discussion of online connections and belonging.

Here's why:

* **The question asks when Europeans started to actively seek refuge and consolidate their power.** The text explicitly mentions that during the Middle Ages (specifically referencing the Byzantine period), Europeans increasingly focused on building defenses to protect themselves. This is a direct consequence of the constant wars and invasions during that time.
* **The Byzantine Empire was a continuation of the Eastern Roman Empire**, which faced relentless pressure from various enemies. The need for strong defenses was a defining characteristic of the Byzantine era.
* **Option B directly links the action of seeking refuge and consolidating power to the Byzantine period**, making it the most accurate answer.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: မွၵ်ႈၵၢပ်ႈပၢၼ်ၵၢင်ၸမ်တေသုတ်း (Late Middle Ages):** While consolidation continued into the Late Middle Ages, the text specifically anchors the initial surge in defensive efforts to the earlier Byzantine period.

Here's why:

The provided text states that during the Middle Ages, a significant development was the creation of flying buttresses to support tall walls. This development is directly associated with the Gothic period. 

* **Gothic period:** Known for its soaring heights, large windows, and the innovative use of flying buttresses to support the walls.
* **Byzantine period:** While they built impressive structures, flying buttresses weren't a key element of their architecture.
* **Crusades:** These were military expeditions, not primarily focused on architectural innovation.
* **Middle Ages:** This is a broad term encompassing many periods, but the flying buttress technology is specifically linked to Gothic architecture within that period.

This means people who engage in managing both long-term goals and immediate desires have a greater sense of contentment and joy. Therefore, ""ၸႂ်သုၵ်းသၢၵ်း"" (joyful/contented) best describes the outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ႁၼ်ၽိတ်းတေႃႇ လွင်ႈတၢင်းၸဵပ်း (Seeing through the surface):** While relevant to understanding the passage, it doesn't directly answer the question about what people gain from managing goals and desires.

* Option D, ""ၶဝ်ႈလၢႆး ၶႄႉၵေႃႉတေႃႇၵေႃႉ,"" directly translates to ""face-to-face interaction"" or ""interaction between individuals."" This aligns with the description of the learning method in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: တီႈၸၼ်ႉထၢၼ်ႈ ဢူဝ်ႇလၢမ်းပိၵ်ႉ (Olympic level):**  This is completely unrelated to the learning method described in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes observing the poor's situation to understand their needs and find solutions.** It mentions needing to see the environment to make it better for their well-being and paying attention to their reactions when approached.
* **Option C directly aligns with this emphasis on observation.**  ""ၸႅတ်ႈတူၺ်း ႁဵင်းၶွင်"" means to observe behavior or conduct.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ပႂ်ႉတူၺ်းတီႈပဵၼ်ပၢင်လိူင်ႈ (Look at the streets):** This is too general.  The passage isn't just about looking at streets; it's about understanding the people living in those streets.

* **D: ပႂ်ႉထႃႈတၢင်းၸွၺ်ႈထႅမ် (Offer assistance):**  Offering assistance is a consequence of understanding the situation, not the initial step.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate reflection of the passage's core message.

Here's why:

The prompt describes a situation where someone wants to help a person who is in a difficult situation. However, it also emphasizes the importance of:

* **Not interfering rashly:**  Waiting to understand the situation fully.
* **Being aware of potential consequences:**  Considering the impact of their actions and avoiding unintentionally making things worse.

Option B, ""Observe the situation before intervening,"" directly addresses this key principle.  It highlights the need for careful observation and understanding *before* taking any action.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the French Revolution created an opportunity for ambitious individuals to rise in power. The revolution dismantled the old feudal system and allowed talented people, regardless of their birth, to gain positions of authority.  The question asks what was needed to capitalize on the revolution's aftermath and advance in politics. Ambition is the driving force behind wanting to climb the political ladder and take advantage of new opportunities.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: လွင်ႈဢွင်ႇမၢင်ႇ (opportunity)** - While the revolution *created* opportunities, the question asks what was *needed* to take advantage of them.
* **B: ႁွင်ႈ (hall/room)** -  Hall or room is irrelevant to political advancement.
* **D: ပၢၵ်ႇၵွင်ႈ (phase/stage)** - While the revolution had different phases, it's the underlying characteristic needed to succeed, not a specific phase.



Therefore, ambition is the most logical answer.

* **The text states:** ""The variations in germline meiosis can lead to different phenotypes depending on the meiotic variations and the genetic interactions of the chromosomes, even if the allele itself is not undesirable."" This means changes in chromosomes (changes in the number or structure of chromosomes) are a key factor in creating phenotypic variation.
* **The question states:** ""The offspring inherit these variations.""  Variations are directly linked to changes in chromosomes.
* **Option C** directly addresses this relationship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ပေႃးတွမ်ႇတွမ်ႊ ပဵၼ်ၼႂ်း သၢႆၸႆႉ (If the mutation is within a cell):** While mutations within cells are possible, the text specifically focuses on *meiotic* variations in the *germline* (cells that produce sperm and eggs), which are inherited.
* **B: လွင်ႈၼေၾၢင်ႁၢင်ႊ ၸႆႉၾၼ်း (Changes in paternal chromosomes):** This is too narrow. The text mentions variations in *both* chromosomes, not just paternal ones.
* **D: မိူဝ်ႈလႅၵ်ႈလၢႆႊၸႆႉၼၼ်ႉ တွမ်ႇတွမ်ႊၶဝ်တၢႆ (At the time of chromosomal changes, the offspring die):**  The text doesn't imply that chromosomal changes always lead to offspring death. Variations are a normal part of genetic inheritance.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** describes a scenario where genetic variations arise due to mutations in germline cells. These mutations can be harmful, neutral, or even beneficial. They can also lead to changes in the characteristics of offspring.
* **The provided text (A)** states that these variations are caused by mutations in germline cells and can potentially be passed on to offspring, leading to various outcomes.
* **Option D** directly addresses the core issue raised in the question – the variability in genetic traits due to mutations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၽွၼ်းယွၼ်ႈမႃး တုမ်ႉတေႃႇ ၸိူဝ်ႉၸႆႉ ၼႆႉၵႃႊႁိုဝ် (Variations arise in cells)** - While true, it doesn't specifically address *why* these variations occur (mutations in germline cells) or their *impact* on inherited traits.
* **B: ပေႃးလွင်ႈတုမ်ႉတိူဝ်ႉတွမ်ႇတွမ်ႊၶဝ် ပဵၼ် သၢႆၸႆႉ (If the variations are characteristics)** - This is too broad. Variations can be more than just characteristics; they can affect health, disease susceptibility, etc.
* **C: ၼေၾၢင်ႁၢင်ႊ ဢၼ်တုမ်ႉယွၼ်ႈတေႃႇ ၸိူဝ်ႉၸႆႉ (Genes that arise in cells)** - This is partially correct but doesn't fully capture the essence of the question about genetic variation and its inheritance.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that early humans used traps and hunting strategies that involved cooperation and communication with other humans. They weren't just hunting alone.
* Option C directly reflects this cooperative hunting behavior. The passage states that humans would set traps and communicate with others who knew about the traps, suggesting a coordinated effort.
* Options A, B, and D are too narrow. While the passage mentions food, traps, and water, it's the cooperative *process* of hunting that is the core point related to the question.

Therefore, the bamboo stick is used to allow entry into the **hole (ႁူး)**.



The other options are incorrect:

* **A: မၢၵ်ႇၵွပ်ႉ (Bamboo stick)** - While the game uses a bamboo stick, the question asks where the stick *leads*.
* **B: ၵၼ်းေပႃႉၵွၵ်ႉ (Rough/Uneven ground)** - The game doesn't involve rough ground.

Here's why:

* The passage describes the game as involving players trying to get others into a deep pit (ႁူးမၢႆ သိပ်းပႅတ်ႈ). 
* The question asks where players are trying to get others to fall into.
* Option A directly matches this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: တီႈႁူးဢွၼ်တၢင်းသုတ်း (The pit entrance)** - While relevant, the question asks about the *location players are trying to get others to fall into*, not just the entrance.
* **D: ၽွင်းၶိုင်ႈၵၢင်ယၢမ်းႁဵၼ်း (During the observation period)** - This refers to a time frame, not a physical location.

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of management skills in aquaculture.** It highlights how a good manager can prevent problems and utilize resources effectively.
* **Question Q asks how to reach a high level of aquaculture.**
* **Option D directly addresses this by suggesting that improving the ability to cultivate and manage is the key to achieving a high level of aquaculture.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: တေၼေလႆႈတေႃႇ တၢင်းယိူင်းဢၢၼ်း တူဝ်ထူပ်းၶဝ် (Will lead to the path of the aquaculture itself).** This is a bit vague and doesn't directly address *how* to reach a high level.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Lân"" (Land) is designed for stable operations and avoids scrutiny.  It also mentions that asking questions and carefully reviewing information are helpful for maintaining stability.  This implies that a key part of maintaining stability is identifying and mitigating potential risks or problems *before* they arise.

The passage then mentions that two types of telescopes were used to make distant and large objects appear closer and bigger. This implies that people were *making* telescopes during that time.

Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the passage. While people *did* want to observe things (B) and *did* use lenses (A and D), the passage focuses on the creation of telescopes themselves.

The text emphasizes the importance of understanding visa requirements for travel to Africa, especially for those of East Asian descent. It mentions visas are necessary for entry into African countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ၵႃႊဝီႇသႃႇ ပုၼ်ႈတႃႇၼွၵ်ႈတီႈ Africa:** While visas are required for entry, this option is too broad. It doesn't specify *which* type of visa is needed.

The passage states that while there are differences in pronunciation and vocabulary between French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland, French speakers in these regions are still familiar with the classic French taught in schools.  The passage emphasizes that they can understand and appreciate standard French.

Option C is the most comprehensive answer because it includes both the vocabulary (words) and pronunciation (how words are spoken) of French, which are key elements for understanding and appreciation.

Here's why:

The text highlights that while French is the official language in Belgium and Switzerland, there are differences in spelling and pronunciation compared to France. However, because students in Belgium and Switzerland learn the standard French of the time in school, they can understand and appreciate French from France.

Option C directly addresses this point – the French spelling used *in schools* – which provides a common ground for understanding despite the regional differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Here's why:

* **The prompt emphasizes the importance of GPS when venturing into unknown areas.**  The text explicitly states that without a GPS device or a reliable cell phone signal, getting lost and encountering difficulties is highly likely.  Venturing into unfamiliar territory is precisely when the risk of getting lost is greatest.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: မိူဝ်ႈလူဝ်ႇၽိမ်းၸၢႆႇငိုၼ်း (When you are going home)** - While GPS can be helpful when returning home, it's not as critical as when exploring new areas.

The prompt highlights the problems with *lack* of signal, not the presence of a signal.

* **D: မိူဝ်ႈသူဢမ်ႇလႂ်ႈ ၸေႇယိမ် ၸၢၵ်ႈ (When you are not sure where you are going)** -  While being unsure of your destination is a problem, the prompt focuses more on the difficulty of *navigating* *to* a destination, especially when in unfamiliar territory.  GPS is about getting *there*, not just being lost.



Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it aligns directly with the prompt's message about the usefulness of GPS when exploring unknown environments."

The passage states that if a user doesn't have a smartphone or isn't within a continuous connection range, the GPS functionality may be affected or not work at all.  Therefore, *not following the connection instructions* is a key reason why a GPS navigation app might not work properly when using a GPS receiver.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that Darwin's voyage was influenced by the fact that he was the ""land agent"" of Galapagos and had knowledge of the fauna there. This implies he had a specific area of interest and a desire to study it. The key to his success wasn't just *any* voyage, but one where individuals with *similar interests* set sail together.

The text describes the dire situation of those who are deeply in debt, highlighting the lack of food, water, and hope, and the potential for despair and even suicide. It states that the place (presumably a debt collection agency or a similar organization) offers stories and comfort, but ultimately doesn't solve the underlying problem of debt, and even exacerbates it.

Option D directly reflects this – the text implies there's no real solution to their debt problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: ယုၵ်ႉယွင်ႈလဝ်ႈ (Tell stories, amuse):** The text *does* mention that the place offers stories and comfort. However, it then states these are *not* solutions to the debt problem. Therefore, this option isn't the best fit.

Here's why:

* **The problem described in the initial text:**  Old debts and lack of resources are causing significant hardship for the elderly. The text emphasizes the importance of providing them with food, water, comfort, and emotional support.  It also mentions that old debts and poor health can lead to conflict and mental distress.
* **Why option C is the best response:**  Option C directly addresses the root cause of the problem.  ""Carefully examining old debts and resources"" is the first step towards resolving the issue.  Understanding the extent of the debts and what resources are available is crucial to developing a plan to help the elderly.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: ၵိၼ်လဝ်ႈၼမ်လူၼ်ႉ (Eat heartily):**  Eating well is important for health, but it doesn't solve the problem of old debts and resource scarcity.
    * **B: ႁပ်ႉလွင်ႈပိူၼ်ႈယွင်ႈၵူၼ်ႈ (Suppress emotional outbursts):**  While emotional stability is important, suppressing outbursts doesn't address the financial or resource problems.

The passage states that the reason for the ""hik"" (which is a type of verb/adjective combination) being formed is because of the process of **writing (ၵၢၼ်တႅမ်ႈ)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in the village of Nawak, Malaysia, the phrase ""ມາၼႆႉလူး (Ma noi lu)"" is used to describe a situation where someone approaches another person with the intention of... (the passage trails off). The closest translation and meaning in this context is ""တူပ်းမိုဝ်းတေႃႇၵၼ်,"" which means ""to approach and converse"" or ""to go and talk to each other.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ၶူတ်းသေ တူပ်းၼိဝ်ႉမိုဝ်း (Khut sei tup nie moe):** This translates to ""to make and feel moe"" which has no relevance to the context.

Therefore, ""တူပ်းမိုဝ်းတေႃႇၵၼ်"" is the most accurate translation of the phrase ""ມາၼႆႉလူး"" in the context of the"

Here's why:

The passage explains that the phrase ""buffalo buffalo buffalo"" is a type of linguistic trick. The trick lies in the way the word ""buffalo"" is used, particularly the part that indicates direction.  The question asks about the part of the word that, when spoken, is said to mean ""come back.""  The trick is that the part of the word indicating going *past* the buffalo is what creates the confusion and allows the phrase to be interpreted as ""come back.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ၼမ်ႉႁႃၽူး ဢၼ်ဢမ်ႇမၼ်ႈၵိုမ်း (Unstable soil)** - While unstable soil can contribute to cracking, the text specifically highlights the *lack* of water as the primary cause affecting the foundation.

The passage directly links saturated soil to structural weakness (ႁွႆးၸတ်ႉ).  The other options are not mentioned or supported by the text:

This directly implies that Rogaland and Agder, in general, are *not* treeless.  Therefore, they differ from other parts of Norway that *do* have forests.

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

* **B: ဢမ်ႇမီးငိူပ်ႇမၢၵ်ႇႁိၼ် (Do not have granite rocks)**: The text doesn't mention granite rocks at all.

While ""vidde"" are open areas without trees, the text doesn't mention mountains as a defining characteristic *in contrast* to the other features.

The original text describes how the person who helped the yacht owner did the following:

* **Immediately informed the yacht owner** that they were the one who helped.
* **Made a good impression** on the other people present.
* **Reconnected the yacht owner** with the bar owner.
* **Asked the others to be friendly.**

The question asks about the *proper procedure* when the yacht owner was assisted.  The most logical and helpful action is to **announce the assistance to the ship owner**.  This is what the text emphasizes as the immediate follow-up action.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that to prevent livestock from straying and to facilitate communal grazing, fences and hedges should be built. It also mentions using clean, fertile soil to plant grass and creating hedges to separate pastures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: သွၵ်းတိၼ်ၼင် (Planting soil)** While soil is important, the passage refers to planting grass *on* the soil, not just planting soil itself.
*   **C: ၶႅပ်းတိၼ်သူၼ်ႈ (Cultivated land)** The passage focuses on creating boundaries and managing pastures, not just general cultivated land.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၵူပ်းၵူႈ ၼႂ်း ပီႊ 70** (Any person within 70 years) - This is too broad. The passage focuses on families with young children.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The question describes how certain providers offer web proxies (essentially HTTP proxies) with high bandwidth, but also with potential data logging and throttling. The text indicates that these providers are actively tracking data for later exploitation.

Therefore, users who are concerned about privacy and being tracked would *not* want to use these web proxies, even if they offer high bandwidth. They would prefer a solution that doesn't involve potential data logging and throttling, which is why they'd want to use a dedicated VPN.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the person is using the internet to establish an internet connection in Alaska despite not having a local phone number. They then use a phone number to connect with others. The passage also mentions using Caller ID to connect with people and that the phone number they use connects to the person they are trying to reach. 

Option A best reflects this use of the internet to continue communication. While the passage mentions PSTN, the primary method of establishing a connection in this scenario is via the internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: သိုပ်ႇၾူၼ်းၸူး တင်းလူၵ်ႈ (Continue calling to the other person)** - While they do call, the passage emphasizes the use of the internet *first* to get connected in the first place.

Here's why:

* **The passage explains that the person can get internet in Alaska and Arizona without a local phone number.** This implies they are using a roaming service.
* **To be reachable by phone, they need to have a phone number that can be routed to them, regardless of their location.** A roaming phone number is exactly that - it allows calls to be forwarded to their current location.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that in Italian, the pronunciation of ""r"" changes depending on whether it's followed by a vowel or not. Specifically, ""r"" followed by a vowel is pronounced differently from ""rr"" (which is a stronger, rolled ""r"").  The example of ""caro"" (dear) and ""carro"" (cart) illustrates this perfectly.

* **B: တူဝ်လိၵ်ႈၵမ်ႈၼမ် ဢွၵ်ႇသဵင်ၸွမ်း ၼင်ႇၶဝ် တႅမ်ႈၼၼ်ႉ:** This is generally true, but the passage highlights the exceptions and the specific rules governing the ""r"" sound.  It's not a universally applicable rule.

The text explains that hangi is traditionally cooked using wood from fires, specifically from fires that have burned for a long time, and wood found within the earth, which has been transformed by geothermal activity. While ""wood from fires"" and ""wood within the earth"" (which implies geothermal influence) are part of the hangi process, **geothermal wood** itself isn't a specific ingredient or technique in the hangi process mentioned in the text.

The text highlights the use of:

* **Wood from fires:** This is mentioned as the source of wood for hangi.
* **Wood within the earth:**  This is linked to geothermal activity and influences the wood's properties.
* **Magma stones:**  These are used to heat the hangi.

Therefore, geothermal wood isn't directly involved in the hangi cooking method explained in the text.

Here's why:

The passage describes that both the monks and the nobles offered polished wood as a donation. The question asks what the monks and nobles offered. The answer C directly states that they brought polished wood to the temple, which aligns with the passage's description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: မႆၽႅၼ်ႇပိုၼ်ႉလင် ႁိူဝ်ႈႁိူဝ်ႈ** (Polished wood, shiny): While polished wood is mentioned, this option is too general. The question asks what they *offered*.

* **D: ၼုင်ႈသိၼ်ႈသၵၢတ်ႉ သုင်ၼိူဝ်ႁူဝ်ၶဝ်ႇ** (Offering wealth, respectfully on their heads): The passage mentions offering polished wood, not wealth, and the placement is not specified.

This implies that skirts are a common garment and don't have special restrictions regarding wearing them in a temple.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ၵူၼ်ပွတ်း (Men)** - The text discusses skirts for women.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that people go to the Antarctic to see the polar night (24 hours of darkness), which allows them to observe the aurora (Northern Lights).
* It also highlights the lack of human population and light pollution in these remote regions, making aurora viewing easier.
* Option B, ""Remote polar regions,"" accurately describes the location where these conditions are found.

Here's why:

The provided text explains that satellite internet is often unavailable in remote locations due to the difficulty in transmitting signals to satellites. The question asks why satellite internet might not be able to reach a remote area. Option C directly addresses this by stating that it's unavailable if used in a remote area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ပေႃးလႅင်းမႃးၵဝ်း လၢဝ်တဵမ်းၸၢင်ႊသုၵ်ႉ (If it gets warmer, the satellite can be repaired)** - While temperature can affect electronics, it's not the primary reason satellite internet is unavailable in remote areas.

The text emphasizes the difficulties older people face in accessing communication due to their location and limited resources. The answer D directly addresses the eventual solution to this problem: as the population ages, mobile phone ownership will become common, providing older people with the communication access they need.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Transnistria Republic's existence is rooted in the unresolved conflict following the dissolution of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic. It mentions the lack of a clear status and the political implications of its existence, including issues related to governance, economy, and the failure to define it as a state. The text also notes the political tensions between the two banks of the Dniester River. Therefore, the core reason for Transnistria's existence is political.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ၸၢဝ်းၶိူဝ်း (Ethnic):** While there are ethnic components involved (primarily Russian and Ukrainian), the text doesn't frame the conflict *primarily* as an ethnic one. It emphasizes the political vacuum and the failure to establish statehood.
* **C: ၵႂၢမ်းလၢတ်ႈလိၵ်ႈလၢႆး (Language):** The text mentions the language issue (Moldavian vs. Russian), but it's presented as one contributing factor within the broader political context, not the primary reason for Transnistria's emergence.

Here's why:

The text mentions that the Transnistria Republic emerged from the Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic, which was part of the Soviet Union. This republic was predominantly inhabited by ethnic Russians and Ukrainians, and they felt marginalized by the Moldavian leadership. This ethnic composition was a key factor in the declaration of independence and the subsequent conflict with Moldova.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ၵႂၢမ်းလၢတ်ႈလိၵ်ႈလၢႆး (Language):** While language played a role, the text emphasizes the ethnic composition as the primary driver. The official language was Moldavian (which was considered closely related to Romanian), and the Russian and Ukrainian populations felt their languages and cultures were not adequately represented.

The question asks what keeps the fairs appealing and attracts people. The answer is that they are attracting families with young children. Therefore, the primary goal is to attract children (and their parents). Options B, C, and D are consequences of attracting children, not the main reason *why* the fairs are designed to be attractive.

Question Q asks what they need to do to establish a spiritual residence (päk-säw lon) according to the writing. The text directly links establishing a spiritual residence to entering the hall and prostrating oneself. Therefore, option D accurately reflects this requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The passage states that Parisians are ""bien élevé"" (well-bred) and that they have a refined lifestyle. The passage also says that to integrate into Parisian society and live like a Parisian, you need to be respectful and appreciate their sophisticated ways.  The last sentence implies that failing to understand and appreciate Parisian customs will lead to the loss of the ""charming facade"" of the Parisians.

* **The passage describes the suffering of those bound to the earth.** They are unable to easily interact with the living, experience fluctuations in their emotions, or have harmonious relationships. They are also prone to illness and weak. 
* **The question asks if these bound beings cannot go to Sukkhata (a realm of bliss).**
* **Option D directly addresses this by suggesting providing them with a way out.** This aligns with the passage's description of their suffering and implies a need for liberation or escape from their current state.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ႁဵတ်းတီႈၶဝ် (Make their homes):** While providing shelter might help, it doesn't address the deeper issue of their suffering and their inability to interact with the living.
* **B: ၸႂ်လမ်တေႃႇၶဝ် (Their minds are attached):** This describes a potential cause of their suffering but doesn't offer a solution to their predicament.
* **C: ပိုၼ်ႊတၢင်းပဵၼ် (Their karma is accumulated):** Similar to option B, this identifies a cause but doesn't suggest a way to alleviate their suffering.

Here's why:

* **The text describes how toll-free numbers facilitate the collection of donations.**  This is the ""ၸၢႆႉၸွမ်းၾူၼ်း"" (use toll-free numbers) part.
* **The text also mentions the ability to pay by card (ၼပ်ႉလၢႆလၢႆ)**, implying using a payment card. This is the ""ၸၢႆႇၸွမ်း ၶႅပ်းဝႂ်"" (pay by card) part.
* **Option D combines both of these key elements.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၶဝ်ၵွၺ်းပၼ်ၵႂႃႇၸွမ်း မိူင်းဢၼ်သပ်းသေးဝႆႉၼၼ်ႉၵွၺ်း (They donate to underdeveloped countries only)** - The text doesn't limit donations to only underdeveloped countries.
* **B: ပိုၼ်ႊပၼ် မၢႆၼပ်ႉလၢႆလၢႆ (They collect various phone numbers)** -  The text focuses on *toll-free* numbers, not just collecting any phone number.
* **C: တီႈၸဵင်ႇႁၢၼ်ႉတၢင်းၶၢႆ (At the nearest sales point)** - The text discusses online donations and not physical sales points.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately reflects the information provided in the text.

Here's why:

The passage criticizes the media for claiming their actions (""spreading rumors"" to ""protect the reputation"") are for the sake of ""good governance."" The author argues this is a facade.  They suggest the real motive behind the media's sensationalism (yìng ဢၢၼ်းဢၼ်တေႉ) is to create excessive, chaotic attention (ၵၢၼ်ၵုမ်းၵမ်လွၵ်းၵၢတ်ႇတိူဝ်းၼမ်) so that these media outlets can earn a lot of money (ဢၼ်ၶႂ်ႈဝႃႈတႄႉ ပဵၼ်လွင်ႈတႃႇႁႃငိုၼ်းလႆႈၼမ်ၼမ်ၼႉ).

The word ""ႁေႉႁၢမ်ႈ Piracy"" (Piracy) best encapsulates the idea of spreading false information and creating chaos, which is what the passage accuses the media of doing for financial gain.  Piracy in this context isn't just about illegal copying; it's about spreading harmful and misleading content.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၶႅပ်းပွမ် (Information/Data)**: While information is involved, the passage is not primarily discussing the nature of the information itself.
* **B: ထိင်းလွၵ်းၵၢတ်ႇ (Corruption)**: While corruption *could* be a consequence of the media's actions, the passage focuses more on the *motive* behind their actions (financial gain).
* **D: ပၵ်းပိူင်ပွမ် (Planning/Organizing)**: The passage doesn't discuss planning or organization; it discusses the *results* of the media's actions.

The text goes on to explain that the ""stability"" (လွၵ်းၵၢတ်ႇ) that media outlets and news organizations are claiming is not genuine.  They are trying to create the illusion of stability (လွင်ႈတႃႇႁႃငိုၼ်းလႆႈၼမ်ၼမ်ၼႉ) to ultimately make more money (ငိုၼ်း).  Therefore, the core issue is a lack of genuine stability.

* **The question asks:** ""When people arrive in the country, should they declare things?"" The initial statement (P) describes a history of people concealing goods entering the country to see if they could get away with it, and to then report the details of their dealings.
* **Option C directly addresses this:** It says goods should be declared ""according to the regulations."" This aligns with the historical context in P about reporting transactions.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: ၸႅတ်ႈတူၺ်း ၵူၼ်းၶၢႆႉယူႇၼႂ်းမိူင်း (Inspect traders within the country):**  This is about inspecting traders, not necessarily declaring goods upon arrival.

* **The passage emphasizes:** The immigrants kept things *carefully* to show whether they could take them with them.  Option C, ""ၸွင်ႇလႆႈထုၵ်ႇ ထိင်းၵွၼ်းဝႆႉ,"" (He had to store them carefully) perfectly captures this meaning.

The text explicitly states: ""Sky Team ၵေႃႈဢမ်ႇလတ်းၽၢၼ်ႇၵႂႃႇမႃႉ ၼိူဝ်ပၢင်ႇလၢႆႇၸိူဝ်းၼႆႉသေတီႈ"" (SkyTeam also doesn't fly over certain regions).

This implies that the alliance (likely referring to a broader alliance than just LATAM Oneworld) has routes that cover the South Pacific. While LATAM Oneworld *is* mentioned, it's presented as one *example* of an alliance route, not the alliance itself. The text also states a lack of suitable routes for crossing the South Pacific *unless* flying over the US West Coast.

Therefore, ""ၸုမ်းဢူၺ်းလီလၢဝ်"" (Alliance of Airlines) is the best answer.

This means LATAM Oneworld has a codeshare agreement that connects the Eastern Pacific (Santiago de Chile to Tahiti) and facilitates flights across the Southern Hemisphere. The question asks which entity offers flights across the Southern Hemisphere, and LATAM Oneworld is the correct answer according to the text.

The passage states that moles burrow because they are compelled to by instinct.  They need to dig tunnels, and often the tunnels they create can be used by other animals.  The passage also mentions that the burrowing is influenced by several factors: instinct, the need for more burrows, natural conditions, and sometimes even humans.

Option C, ""ထႅင်ႈထၢပ်ႈမူၺ်ႁႃ တီႈၼိူဝ် ၽႃၸၼ်း"" (Additional burrows on the surface of the farmland), directly reflects this.  Moles create tunnels, and these tunnels can manifest on the surface, particularly on farmland. This is an extension of their natural burrowing behavior and the impact it has on the environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: မူၺ်ၸပ်းယိုၵ်းယိုၵ်း ဢၼ်ဢမ်ႇမီးဢၼ်ၶင်ႉ** (Loose, uncompacted soil without roots): While moles do tunnel through soil, this option focuses on the soil composition, not the action of burrowing itself as described in the passage.
* **B: တၢင်းၸၼ်းဢၼ် ဢမ်ႇမီးမူၺ်ႁႃ** (Surface area without burrowing): The passage describes *burrowing*, not the absence of it.
* **D: ၵူၼ်းၶီႇမၼ်းဢမ်ႇလႆႈတိူဝ်ႉမူၺ်ႁႃ** (Humans cannot control burrowing): The passage *mentions* humans' influence, but it's not the core principle of *why* moles burrow.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that in Northern India and Pakistan, *dahi* (curd/yogurt) is commonly paired with *pakoras*.
* It also mentions that in Southern India and other regions, *buttermilk* is more commonly used.
* The question asks what *pakoras* are typically eaten with, and the text gives *yogurt/dahi* and *buttermilk/namkhaan* as the typical pairings.

Therefore, **yogurt/dahi (ၼမ်ႉၼူမ်းသူမ်ႈ)** and **buttermilk (ၼမ်ႉ)** are the likely pairings.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that in Northern India and Pakistan, curd is often eaten with **yogurt (ၼမ်ႉၼူမ်းသူမ်ႈ)**.  It also mentions that in Southern India and other regions, **buttermilk (ၼမ်ႉၼူမ်းမၢၵ်ႇပၢဝ်ႉ)** is frequently used.  The question asks which is good for curd, and yogurt is directly mentioned as being paired with curd.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၼိူဝ်ႉ (Ghee/Clarified Butter):**  While ghee is used in Indian cuisine, it's not specifically mentioned as being paired with curd in the provided text.
* **B: ၽၵ်းယိူဝ်ႈၼၢင်းၶဵဝ် (Fermented Cow Dung):** This is a traditional, and less common, ingredient in some parts of India.  It's not mentioned in connection with curd.
* **D: မၢၵ်ႇၽိတ်း (Whey):** Whey is a byproduct of cheese-making and not commonly used with curd.

ယွၼ်ႉသင် ၸိူဝ်းႁိမ်းႁွမ်း Transantarctic Mountains လူဝ်ႇလႆႈၶိုၼ်ႈတီႈ ဢၼ်ပဵင်း?,"The correct answer is **C: ၸၢၵ်ႈထုၺ်မူၺ်ၼႆႉ ဢမ်ႇၵႂႃႇၶႅမ်ႉၵႃႊၼၼ်ႉ (Glaciers do not extend far)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Transantarctic Mountains are very large and prevent travel.
*  The passage also mentions that glaciers are carefully monitored and used for travel along the route.
* **The key reason glaciers don't extend far is because of the extreme cold.** The cold prevents the glaciers from growing and extending across the Transantarctic Mountains. Therefore, there are gaps between the glaciers, allowing for travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: တႃႈလူတ်ႉ McMurdo ၵႆႉဢိုတ်းဝႆႉ (McMurdo station is located):** While McMurdo station is a starting point, it doesn't directly explain why travel is possible across the Transantarctic Mountains.
* **B: မူၺ်ႁႃဢၼ်ႁတ်းၼႆႉ မီးၽေးတေႉတေႉ (The ice is very thick):** Thick ice would make travel *more* difficult, not easier.
* **D: မၼ်းၵႂႃႇလႄႈငၢႆႈလိူဝ် ၵႂႃႇလႄႈ ပၢင်ႇလၢႆႇတီႈၵုၼ် Ross ၵွၼ်ႇ (It goes back and forth quickly, to and from Ross Sea):** The passage describes a route across the continent, not back and forth to the Ross Sea. The movement is about traversing the Transantarctic Mountains.

The text states: ""မၼ်းပဵၼ်သဵၼ်ႈတၢင်းဢၼ်မီးမူၺ်ႁူမ်ႇၸွမ်းႁွႆးၼမ်ႉၶႅင်တႅၵ်ႇၼၼ်ႉ..."" which translates to ""It is a road that runs along the ice sheet..."" and ""...ၸႂ်ႉၶီႇၸွမ်းမူၺ်ၼၼ်ႉၵူၺ်ႉ"" which means ""...using the ice sheet.""  Therefore, the drilling sites are located on the ice sheet. Option C, ""တီႈထၢပ်ႈမူၺ်ႁႃ တႅၵ်ႈဢႃႈ"" (drilling sites on the ice sheet), is the most accurate description.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ၸွမ်းတႃႈလူတ်ႉ McMurdo** (Along the McMurdo road):  While the traverse starts near McMurdo, the drilling sites themselves are not *along* the road.
*   **B: ၸၢၵ်ႈထုၺ် ၸၼ်ၸႂ်ႉ ယိူဝ်ႇၼမ်ႉမၼ်း** (Near the ice sheet's edge): The drilling sites are not necessarily *at* the edge of the ice sheet, but rather *within* it.

The text states that leaving a person with a disability unattended is a sign of negligence and potentially a form of exploitation. It also mentions that authorities will investigate such cases, especially if there's suspicion of intentional harm or death.  The question asks what happens if someone leaves a disabled person unattended. The text clearly indicates that they will face legal consequences (""တေထုၵ်ႇလၵ်ႉ"").

The passage describes how the person enjoys different drinks to relax and unwind after a long day. It specifically mentions coffee as one of the drinks they would choose.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: ၼမ်ႉသူမ်ႈၸဵမ်း (Chamomile tea)** - While chamomile tea is relaxing, the passage doesn't specifically mention it.
* **C: ပီႊယႃႇ (Beer)** - Beer is typically associated with socializing and relaxation, but the passage emphasizes a focus on personal relaxation and avoiding anything that might disrupt their sleep.
* **D: ၼမ်ႉၼဵင်ႈ (Water)** - Water is essential, but the passage focuses on drinks that provide a specific relaxing effect.

Therefore, based on the passage's description of relaxing drinks, **coffee** is the most likely answer to what the person would choose to make at home when they want to unwind in the evening."

* **Option C directly addresses this:** It suggests riding on a path (เลน) through the forest, implying a designated and safer route to avoid ravines.
* **Options A & B are too general:** They don't specify the method of avoiding ravines.

* They use their unique local dialects and slang, which are different from standard written language.
* The example of them playfully teasing each other about their roots and using dialect in a non-formal setting reinforces this.

Therefore, the passage emphasizes the use of **local dialects** as a key element of their communication in Toronto. The question asks where Toronto is ""yapping"" (talking) about, which refers to the **local dialect**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how people who are displaced often try to recreate aspects of their former lives in their new environment. This includes customs, traditions, and ways of doing things. The goal is to cope with the loss and maintain a sense of familiarity and control.  The passage specifically mentions that mimicking the customs of their homeland can help ease the transition and reduce feelings of discomfort or frustration.

Option C directly reflects this idea of emulating the customs of their homeland to make their new environment feel more familiar and comfortable.

* **A: လၵ်းၸဵင်မၼ်း မိူၼ်ၵၼ်တင်း မိူင်းဢၼ်ၶဝ် မႃးၼၼ်ႉ (The layout is the same as their homeland)** - While layout can be a factor, the passage emphasizes *customs and traditions*, not just physical layout.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes personal transformation.** It states that when people move to a new place, they will change their habits, ways of life, and even their thoughts. This change is driven by a desire to improve and overcome dissatisfaction.
* **Option B directly reflects this desire for improvement.**  The passage says people are motivated by wanting to ""escape worries, negative emotions, and unsatisfactory aspects of life.""  This aligns perfectly with the idea of wanting to ""change and improve themselves.""

The text emphasizes the importance of having the source files available *even if* the recipients don't have internet access.  The repeated mention of ""in case of no internet access"" and providing a ""backup"" directly points to the need to physically give the files to people.

Let's analyze why the other options are less suitable:

Here's why:

The passage states that the new lens is designed to be compatible with DSLR cameras. It also mentions that the lens has a focal length of 6 to 6 cm.  The question asks which negative size would be appropriate for a lens with a 6 x 6 cm negative.

The passage details that using a 35mm negative (36x24mm) allows for easy cropping to fit modern DSLRs. However, the question is asking which negative *size* would match the 6x6 cm lens design. The passage specifies the lens has a focal length of 6 x 6 cm.

Therefore, the lens is designed to work with a 6 x 6 cm negative.

* **The passage explicitly states that the 35mm negative can be easily copied using a modern DSLR.** This implies the existence of a 35mm lens that is compatible.
* **The passage describes the 6x6 cm lens as having a focal length of 56-56mm.** This is different from the focal length of the 35mm lens.
* **The passage mentions the 6x6 cm lens is used for copying at distances of 6-6 cm.**  This information is relevant to its usage but doesn't directly describe its compatibility with a DSLR in the same way the 35mm lens does.

Therefore, the most direct answer based on the passage's comparison to DSLR compatibility is the 35mm lens.

Option C directly aligns with this final goal: developing a website specifically *for the owner*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Here's why:

* **The original text emphasizes that providing financial support to those returning from overseas can be a way to help them rebuild their lives and find new opportunities.** Option B directly reflects this core idea.
* **Option A** is too vague. ""Money is abundant"" doesn't explain *how* the support helps.
* **Option C** is irrelevant. ""Training and equipment"" aren't the primary focus of the text's argument about financial support.
* **Option D** is too narrow. While supporting someone's personal traits might be helpful, the text focuses more broadly on providing a way to *earn* a living.

Here's why:

The text describes a survival course focused on preparing individuals for dangerous situations, including combat, medical emergencies, and harsh environmental conditions.  The course emphasizes survival skills needed to endure extremely difficult and potentially life-threatening circumstances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ႁၢင်ႈႁႅၼ်းတႃႇယူတ်းယႃၽႂ်း (Preparation for medical emergencies):** While medical training is part of the course, it's not the"

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that the training includes:

* **Luyện tập sơ cứu (First Aid practice)**
* **Sơ cứu ban đầu (Initial First Aid)**
* **Cứu thương chiến trường (Combat Trauma Rescue)**

The question asks what skill is needed to survive in a battlefield.  First Aid is a crucial skill for survival as it addresses immediate injuries and helps prevent further complications, especially in the harsh conditions of combat. While the other options are relevant to survival, First Aid is the *most immediate* and necessary skill for initial survival.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""သင်ဝႃႈသူမီးလွင်ႈလွင်ႈၶမ်ၸႂ်ၼႆၵေႃႈ သူထုၵ်ႇလီဝူၼ်ႉသွၼ်ႇတူၺ်းတႃႇသိုဝ်ႉၼမ်ႉဢၼ်သႂ်ႇတဝ်ႈသေပိၵ်ႇၵႅၼ်ႇဝႆႉ တီႈၶွမ်ႇပၼီႇဢၼ်ယုမ်ႇၸႂ်လႆႈၼၼ်ႉယဝ်ႉ."" (If the fire is out of control, you should also watch and store the added water in a company that has the ability to do so.)

* **This implies:**  The proper action when the fire is out of control is to *store* the water. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: တင်ႈၼမ်ႉ ႁိုင်ႁိုင် လၢႆလၢႆမဵတ်ႉ (Ding nang hang hang lai lai met)** - ""Water level, various meters"" - This refers to measuring the water level, not what to do with the water.
* **C: တင်ႈၼမ်ႉ ၼိူင်ႈမဵတ်ႉ (Ding nang ning met)** - ""Water level, rising meters"" - Similar to A, this is about measuring, not handling.
* **D: ၸႅတ်ႈတူၺ်းၼမ်ႉ တႃႇယႃႇႁႂ်ႈမီးၽေး (Zai tuo nang daxia huai mi feng)** - ""Watch the water to extinguish the fire"" - The text already discusses extinguishing the fire with water. 



Therefore, option B, **သိုဝ်ႉငွၺ်းၼမ်ႉ (Suaikan nang)**, which means ""Store water,"" is the most relevant and correct answer."

Here's why:

The text describes a scenario where a person is trapped in a leaking well. The key to survival is to grab the leaking water to stay hydrated. The passage explicitly states that if the person can get into the leaking water, their situation won't worsen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where someone has fallen into a deep, murky water and is struggling. The key advice given in the text is to look for a floating object to hold onto. This is because the water is too murky to see the bottom, and the person can't swim to safety. 

Option B directly reflects this advice. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ၶတ်းၸႂ်တႃႇဢွၵ်ႇပူၼ်ႉ (Try to swim out)** -  The text explicitly states that swimming to safety is not possible due to the murky water.

Here's why:

The text states that waterways were historically important for travel and connecting to interesting cities. It specifically mentions cities along the Danube River as examples. Therefore, to travel east, you would likely go to a city located on the Danube River.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ၶၢမ်ႈႁွင်ႈၶုတ်ႉ Erie Canal ၵႂႃႇ:** While Erie Canal is mentioned, the text doesn't specifically link it to traveling east.

* **""လၢႆးၵေႃႇသၢင်ႈ"" (Mechanism) directly refers to the system, process, or method by which things operate.** This perfectly aligns with the passage's description of international financial flows.

The passage explicitly states that when someone leaves their country to work abroad, they rely on the **country where they work** for their income (เงินตรา). The question asks where they should rely on for the money they earn. Therefore, the answer must be the country where they are working.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The text explicitly states that the weasel population increased significantly due to the availability of food (mice and other small animals) and the lack of natural predators. It emphasizes the need to keep a distance from weasels because they are strong and potentially dangerous. Therefore, weasels won't be eliminated by simply being kept away; the problem stems from the abundance of their food source.
