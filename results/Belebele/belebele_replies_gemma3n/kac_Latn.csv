"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, accordion hpe awngdang ai hku dum lu na matu hpa hpe tup hkrak teng ai hpaji jaw ai lam ngu nlu sawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Nsen shaja na matu bellow ni hpe grau lawan ai hku dum u**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q)** asks how to make the accordion sound louder when playing the *lata* (a type of Burmese music).
* **The Passage (P)** describes playing the *lata* on the piano and accordion. It specifically mentions that the bellows of the accordion are squeezed and released to make sound.
* **Option D** directly addresses the question by stating the action needed to increase the sound of the accordion – squeezing and releasing the bellows.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While pressing the keys (or buttons) is necessary to produce a note, it doesn't directly control the volume of the accordion.
* **B:**  This option is vague and doesn't offer a specific action to increase the accordion's volume. ""Making it sound pleasant"" is subjective.
* **C:** This option simply reiterates how to play the *lata* notes, but doesn't explain how to make the accordion *louder*.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that logically and directly answers the question based on the information provided in the passage."
"Accordion dum ai ten hta, npu na gara wa mahtang gaw nsen shatsaw na matu karum ya ai kun?","The correct answer is **B: N-gun grau law na**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Accordion madum sumpyi hta nsen shaja na matu bellow ni hpe n-gun grau shadat nna (sh) grau lawan ai hku pat let dum ra ai."" This translates to: ""For accordion playing, the bellows are puffed and sucked with the hands, and the keys are pressed to produce sound.""

Option B, ""N-gun grau law na"" (which means ""puffed and sucked""), directly reflects the action described in the passage regarding the accordion's bellows.  The other options are not mentioned or are incorrect based on the text.
"
Hkrangmu nsen lamang na sumla ni gaw hpa majaw makau ndung ni hpe di da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **D: Npu de grai nyi ai madun laika ni hpe dum hpyawt kau na matu.**

Here's why:

The passage states that you need to scan the DVD to copy its contents.  It also mentions that you can only copy the data if the DVD is not protected by copy protection.  Therefore, the question is asking *when* you can copy the data. Option D accurately reflects this: you can copy the data if the copy protection is removed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sumla hkrung npu na laika ni hpe madun na matu** (When the DVD's data is extracted): This describes the process of extracting the data, not the condition needed for copying it.
*   **B: Sumla hpe TV pat man hta hpring hkra mu lu na matu** (When the data is not played on the TV):  This is irrelevant to the copy protection issue.
*   **C: Kaga hkrang ni de aloi sha galai lu na matu** (When the DVD is not played on the player): This also doesn't address the copy protection issue.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu de na gara wa mahtang gaw sumla hkrung hpe DVD hkrang galai ai ten hta mayak ni nga ai kun?","The correct answer is **A: TV pat man hta yawng nlu jahpring ai sumla** (A DVD player connected to the TV).

Here's why:

The question asks what device is needed to play DVDs on the TV. The passage clearly states: ""Dai madi madun ai a matu, nang TV kaw mu ai lam yawng gaw shi shingwang kata rep, lahta, npu, maga ga de ni sha re. Pat man ting hta dai sumla atsawm mu na matu ndai hpe shateng galaw da ai."" (Because of the above, the type of connection to your TV can be HDMI, VGA, component, etc.  You can connect the device to the TV with a cable.)

Then it says: ""Gam nkaja ai hku, nang DVD galaw ai shaloi, shi a makau ndung ni hpe di kau na zawn re nga ai hte lama na sumla hkrung kaw laika madun ai shaloi npu de grai kap taw nna shanhte hpe yawng nmai madun na ra ai."" (In the above case, to play the DVD, connect the DVD player to the TV using a cable.)

Therefore, you need a DVD player (sumla hkrung) connected to the TV (TV pat man hta).  Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Adaw achyen re ai sumla hkrung npu na laika ni** (A DVD player with a remote control) - While a remote is helpful, it's not a necessary device. You still need the DVD player itself.
* **C: TV pat man yawng hpring taw ai sumla** (A device that is connected to the TV with a cable) - This is too vague. The passage specifies it needs to be a DVD player (sumla hkrung).
* **D: makau ndung di da ai** (something that is related to the above) - This is too broad and doesn't give a specific device.



"
British mare sin dap gaw gara kaw nga lai wa ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states: ""Du daju John Cadwalder gaw hpyen n-gun jat ai lam hpe hkum pat jahkring na matu Bordentown na British maren sin dap hpe lam galai gumlang gasat na matu tsun shabra na re."" This translates to: ""Later, John Cadwalder was commissioned to build a ferry crossing across the Delaware River from Bordentown to the shore of the township.""

Therefore, the British were stationed in **Bordentown**.
"
Lata hte ka ai laika hprang hta kadai na lata masat sen hpe mu lu ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text states: ""Lana mi ting hta kanan 150 kaw na 200 daram ya gaw """"""Dunlap ga uru dat ai lam"""""""" hpe shapraw da sai."" which translates to ""For 150 to 200 dollars, John Dunlap was commissioned to print...""  This directly identifies John Dunlap as the one responsible for printing the paper.
"
"Lawu e jaw da ai shara ni hta, Dunlap ga uru dat ai lam gaw hpang jahtum du wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The passage states: ""Kanan langai gaw shata ma matsat 10 ya hta London de shadu sai."" which translates to ""The remaining 10 copies were sent to London.""
"
Dap jum up Stark na hpyen hpung ni gara kaw nga ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Zundawn a sinpraw dingdung maga**.

The passage states: ""Stark a hpyen la ni gaw Mung maden hpyen ni shara la da ai dingdung jahtum maga na nhpan hku shara la bang wa ma ai. Hka hpungrawt nem mat ai a majaw Mystic hka nu kaw na hpang na zundawn a sinpraw dingdung maga du hkra gang hkat mat ai aten hta shanhte gaw nhpan hpe nlung tawng hte galaw da ai shakum hte dingdung maga...""

This translates to: ""In Stark's home, the earth was also being pulled upwards by the power of the Mugen, and the land was being torn apart by the power of the earth's core. The Mystic's power was also being pulled upwards from the ground, and the land was being scorched and the earth was being torn apart by the power of the Mugen...""

Therefore, the earth was being pulled upwards from the ground.  Option C, ""Zundawn a sinpraw dingdung maga"" (from the ground), accurately reflects this.



"
Matsing masat ga hta tsun da ai hte maren dap jum Stark gaw galoi kaw nna shanhte a nhpan ni hpe maden jat la da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Dinggrin hpyen dap ni hpundung hpe lai di lu ai hpang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gridley shing nrai, Stark gaw nhpan a shawng kaw pe 100 (meter 30) daram nga ai hpundung hpe tawn da nna, dinggrin hpyen dap ni n lai dingsa kadai n-gap na matu matsun ai.""  This translates to: ""Gridley then, Stark was able to lift a weight of 100 (30 meters) and was able to easily lift the heavy shield.""

Therefore, the answer is about Stark's ability to lift the heavy shield.  Option B directly addresses this.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Coloni masha ni hpyen lahkawn jat ai ten hta re:** This refers to the colonial governor's speech, which is not directly related to Stark's physical strength.
*   **C: Hka yawm ai ten hta:** This refers to the Mystic community, which is not directly related to Stark's ability to lift the shield.
*   **D: Hpyen dap ni shawng de shara la ai ten:** This refers to the strength of the shield, not Stark's ability to lift it."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu kaw lawm ai ni hta na gara wa gaw Miwa mung a gumshen dik ai aten ladaw gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: The Three Kingdoms ladaw**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dai aten ladaw gaw hkawhkam tingnyang gashun na matu hkik hkam ai du magam ni lapran gumshem ai gasat lam ni byin lai wa sai. Ndai """"""The Three Kingdoms"""""""" ngu ai aten ladaw gaw Miwa labau a sai hkaw htum aten langai rai nga ai.""

This translates to: ""This story is a legend that has been widely circulated and passed down through generations. This story of 'The Three Kingdoms' is considered the most representative story of the Miwa people.""

Therefore, the passage directly identifies ""The Three Kingdoms"" as the most representative story of the Miwa people. The question asks what the Miwa people's most representative story is, so the answer must be ""The Three Kingdoms ladaw.""

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan htawt hkawm ai madang de shang wa ai kagyin hpung hte seng nna gara gaw jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte gaw 17 ya ngut ai hpang galai ai tsip hpe galaw ma ai**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ndai hkrup ai de hkawm sa ai lam (sh) yan hkawm ai lam langai ngai gaw ntsa lam nhtoi 17 na ai.""  This translates to: ""And the distance between the two groups (sh) is 17 (something).""  The ""something"" implies a unit of measurement, and since it's a question about physical movement, it's likely related to a distance.

* **The question asks:** ""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan htawt hkawm ai madang de shang wa ai kagyin hpung hte seng nna gara gaw jaw ai rai?""  This means: ""If the movement of the mats and seats is affected by something, what is the reason for the movement's direction?""

* **Option C directly addresses this:** It connects the movement's direction to a distance of 17.  This suggests the mats and seats are moving *because* of a physical distance (likely the 17 mentioned in the text).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte gaw shana ten hta tsip ai:** (The Shan people are walking for a while). This is a general statement and doesn't directly answer the question about *why* the movement is in a particular direction.
* **B: Shanhte hta lusha madi shadaw ai lam n law ai:** (The Shan people are walking along the lush path). This describes *where* they are walking, not *why* the movement is directed.
* **D: Shanhte gaw shani e yan hkawm ma ai:** (The Shan people are not moving with the wind).  This is irrelevant to the core question of the direction of the movement.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan htawt hkawm ai madang de shang wa ai kagyin hpung ni a tsip ai akyang hte seng nna gara gaw tup hkrak nlu tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: shanhte gaw shanu shara ni n galaw ai sha 17 ya tup yan hkawm ma ai**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):** The question asks what happened to the Shan people in the past when the Tatmadaw (Myanmar Army) was in a situation where they could attack, and the villagers were hiding in the mountains?

* **The Answer (A):** Option A states that the Shan people didn't participate in the conflict. This contradicts the text, which implies they were affected by it.
* **The Answer (B):** Option B directly states that the Shan people retreated to the mountains and hid in the forests, avoiding conflict with the Tatmadaw. This aligns perfectly with the text's description of them ""ma ai"" (not being able to...) and ""tsip tsip hpa re nga ai"" (being scattered).  The ""sha 17 ya tup yan hkawm ma ai"" part, which translates to ""avoiding being caught by the Tatmadaw"", strengthens the answer.
* **The Answer (C):** Option C states the Shan people didn't go to the mountains to hide. This is incorrect according to the text.
* **The Answer (D):** Option D says that the Tatmadaw didn't prevent the Shan people from hiding in the mountains. While the text doesn't explicitly say the Tatmadaw *prevented* them, it's not the core information regarding what happened to the Shan people. It's also not as accurate as option B.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate and complete answer based on the provided text.



"
Kaga shinggan na karum lam ni nga ai rai tim npu na lam ni kaw nna gara gaw matut nna galaw sa na kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkumhkrang shingra ten**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""hkumhkrang shingra ten"" (unlawful/illegal behavior) as something that people should avoid.** It outlines the negative consequences and warns against engaging in such actions. 
* **Question Q asks ""What is the reason why illegal behavior is prohibited?""** The passage explicitly states the reasons: it harms individuals, disrupts society, and violates moral principles. All these reasons fall under the umbrella of ""hkumhkrang shingra ten.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hkum kata kaw hte seng ai matut manoi mabyin (not being able to speak the truth/being unable to say what one thinks):** While related to societal issues, this isn't the core reason for prohibiting illegal behavior as described in the passage.
* **B: Du hkra ladaw hte hkum hkrang galai shai ai lam aten hta hkan ai lahkrip (the reason for not being able to follow the law/the reason for not being able to uphold the law):**  This is a bit convoluted and doesn't directly address the *reason* why illegal behavior is wrong.
* **D: Hkumhkrang shamu shamawt hpaji kaw na lahkrip (the reason for pursuing gain/profit through illegal means):**  This is a specific type of illegal behavior, but not the overarching reason why *all* illegal behavior is prohibited, as the passage explains.



Therefore, ""Hkumhkrang shingra ten"" (unlawful/illegal behavior) is the most accurate answer to the question of why such behavior is prohibited, based on the provided text.



"
Hkrang kumla bung amyu a laklai ai sat lawat nbung ai lam hpe madun ai hkum ding dek ni hpe gawn dan ai ga si gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Masha jahpang na dinghkrai shagu yawng hkra hpe hkrak tup re phenotypic lai nsam hku shabung dat ga nga yang yawng gaw monomorphic hku na chye na ai."" This translates to something like: ""The phenotypic variations of Masha jahpang's different subspecies are generally monomorphic.""  This means *most* of the variations are the same.
* **However, it also states:** ""Dinghkrai shagu gaw alak mi re lai nsam a shai ai lam grai law hpe madun ai ten, shanhte gaw hkrang amyu myu galai ma ai."" This translates to something like: ""Subspecies are mostly defined by the range of their geographical distribution, while others are distinguished by their coloration.""  This indicates there's variation in coloration.
* **Polymorphic** means having more than one distinct form or type.  Since the passage mentions variations in coloration (which is a phenotypic trait), the subspecies are **polymorphic** in terms of appearance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Monomorphic:** The passage explicitly states that the *phenotypic variations* are *generally* monomorphic, but the coloration is an exception, meaning it's not *always* monomorphic.
* **B: Sak hkrung kanu ni:** This phrase doesn't directly relate to the concept of variation in physical traits.
* **C: Amyu baw hpan:** This translates to ""Geographical range"" and while the passage mentions this as a defining factor for some subspecies, it doesn't explain the variations in appearance.



"
Npu e madun da ai kaw nna gara gaw laksan shara shanu ai sak hkrung kanu ni a jaw ai ga si rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Monomorphic**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Masha jahpang na dinghkrai shagu yawng hkra hpe hkrak tup re phenotypic lai nsam hku shabung dat ga nga yang yawng gaw **monomorphic** hku na chye na ai.""

This translates to: ""The phenotypic variations of Masha Japan's wild type are generally similar and **monomorphic**.""

Therefore, ""monomorphic"" refers to the consistent, non-variable nature of the phenotypes in the wild type.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Masha jahpan:** This is the name of the organism, not a description of the phenotypic variation.
*   **C: Amyu baw hpan:** This refers to a specific characteristic (yellowish-brown) of the color, not the overall phenotypic variation.
*   **D: Polymorphic:** This means having multiple forms or appearances, which is the opposite of what the text describes. The text explicitly states the phenotypes are *similar*.

"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw shingra mahta ai bu hkawm ai lam a ga shadawn nre rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hka rum kaba de lagaw lam bum lung ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the reason *why* the Shingra people avoid certain areas. The passage states the Shingra people avoid areas where ""hka rum kaba de lagaw lam bum lung ai"" - which translates to ""there are many snakes and other reptiles.""  This is explicitly stated as a reason for avoiding those places.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nam na nampan ni hpe sumla gayet la ai** - This translates to ""They avoid areas where water is very deep."" While they avoid some bodies of water, this isn't the primary reason for avoiding the *specific* areas being discussed.
* **C: Hpung tang madun gawk hta hkawm chyai ai** - This translates to ""They avoid areas with very small caves."" This is not mentioned as a reason for avoidance in the passage.
* **D: Nga hkwi ai** - This translates to ""They avoid areas with many trees.""  While trees might be present, the passage emphasizes the presence of reptiles as the main deterrent.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw htaw wa htaw sa lam a npawt madung re ai kun?","The question asks: ""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw htaw wa htaw sa lam a npawt madung re ai kun?""

This translates to: ""What is the cause of the feeling of being tired and weak, and the feeling of being unable to concentrate, which comes with the body being fatigued and the mind being dull?""

The provided text (P) discusses a condition characterized by fatigue, lack of energy, dullness, and a feeling of being unable to concentrate. It mentions things like:

* **Bungli galaw shara de sa na matu mawdaw:**  A feeling of lightness or lack of substance.
* **Grai lawan ai htawwa htawsa lam gaw langai hte langai maga mi hku matut taw ai:**  A feeling of the soul being weak and detached.
* **Hku sa ai, htawwa htawsa ladat langaig gaw dinghkrai mawdaw jai lang ai hta mahta ai:**  A feeling of the spirit being confused and restless.
* **Carbon sut hpaga lam gaw lai wa sai shaning wan lahkawng a matu shinggyim sinda masa hpe madi shadawn ya nga ai shi a agrin nga ai mungdan langai kaw na nsoi nsa gintawng hpe lang shapraw nga ai hpe ya na hpung tang hpaji gaw madi madun nga ai:**  This talks about the impact of something (likely internal) causing this weakness and dullness.
* **Madi madun nga ai mungdan langai kaw na nsoi nsa gintawng hpe lang shapraw nga ai hpe ya na hpung tang hpaji gaw madi madun nga ai:** This speaks of a general weakness and tiredness pervading the body.

Considering the options:

* **A: Bungli pandung (Lightness of the body)** - This is a symptom, not the cause.
* **B: Dinghkrai mawdaw ni (Dullness of the mind)** - This is also a symptom, not the cause.
* **C: Masha ni a sinda masat (Weakness of the soul)** - This aligns with the descriptions of the soul being weak and detached in the text.  The soul's weakness is described in relation to a larger internal process described in the text.
* **D: (Missing)**

The text strongly suggests that the cause lies within the internal functioning of the body and spirit, leading to weakness and dullness. Option C (Weakness of the soul) represents a manifestation of this internal process.  While not an *exact* translation, the *closest* meaning is ""Weakness of the soul"" because the entire text is a description of weakness of the body, spirit and soul and that is why C is the only reasonable answer.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Masha ni a sinda masat (Weakness of the soul)**.



"
Nucleus hpe shinggrup ai particle ni hta kaning re ai dat shingrun ni lawm ai kun?,"The correct answer is **D: Wan la the wan yi dat**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What particles group around the nucleus?
* **The text states:** ""gintawng ni jan hpe shinggrup nga hte bung ai zawn re ai lam ni mung lawm nga ai."" (electrons group and surround the nucleus in a certain area.)
* **The text also states:** ""Electron kaw gaw wan dat yi nga ai."" (Electrons orbit the nucleus.)

Therefore, electrons are the particles that group around the nucleus. The option ""Wan la the wan yi dat"" (orbiting and revolving) best captures the movement and location of electrons around the nucleus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wan la dat (Orbit):** While electrons orbit, this doesn't fully describe their nature.
* **B: Dat n nga ai (Detached):** Electrons are *not* detached; they are bound to the nucleus.
* **C: Wan yi data (Orbiting):** Similar to A, this is incomplete. It doesn't explain the surrounding nature.

So, option D is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text."
Nucleus hpe hpa dat particle ni hte galaw da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **D: Proton, neutron, hte electron ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nucleus hta neutrons hte protons ngu ai ayun ayaw lahkawng nga ai. Neutron ni hta hpa dat la mung nnga ai shaloi proton kaw wan dat nga ai. Electron kaw gaw wan dat yi nga ai.""  This translates to: ""The nucleus consists of neutrons and protons. Neutron particles are neutral, while protons have a positive charge. Electrons have a negative charge.""

Therefore, the nucleus is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw bit manga nga ai binary nambat a ga shadawn re ai kun?","The question asks for the binary representation of the decimal number 10.  Let's convert 10 to binary.

*   10 divided by 2 is 5 with a remainder of 0.
*   5 divided by 2 is 2 with a remainder of 1.
*   2 divided by 2 is 1 with a remainder of 0.
*   1 divided by 2 is 0 with a remainder of 1.

Reading the remainders in reverse order gives us 1010.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: 1010**."
Ruhkum 0 hte 1 hpe gara hku naw lakap ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Bit ni**.

Here's why:

* **Bit (Binary Digit):** A bit is the fundamental unit of information in computing. It can represent one of two states: 0 or 1. This directly aligns with the description in the passage.
* **Manu (Man):** This has nothing to do with binary numbers or computing.
* **Laksan ga (Processor/Central Processing Unit - CPU):** While the CPU *uses* binary information, it's not the fundamental unit *representing* the 0 and 1.
* **Hkrang ni (Month):** This is irrelevant.

The passage explicitly states that binary numbers are made up of 0s and 1s, and that this is how computers work. A bit is the basic unit that *is* a 0 or a 1. Therefore, ""bit"" is the correct answer.
"
Jawng ma ni blogging ka ai ten hta madung amyat hku nna npu e jaw da ai kaw na hpa hpe laika hta n tang madun da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **D: Matut nna hkaja mayu ai myit grau nna tsaw wa na amtu**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses blogging as a way to express oneself, share experiences, and connect with others online. It highlights that bloggers often write about their personal lives, thoughts, and feelings.  Option D directly reflects this idea: ""Matut nna hkaja mayu ai myit grau nna tsaw wa na amtu"" translates to ""Writing about personal experiences and feelings.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Lik tara hte laika ka ai atsam hta rawt jat wa ai lam (Sharing thoughts and feelings related to daily life):** While related, it's not as comprehensive as option D. The passage emphasizes more than just daily life; it includes experiences and feelings.
*   **B: Tsang madang bung ai ni shada mara tam hkat ai lam yawm na matu (Writing about significant events):** The passage doesn't focus solely on major events; it also includes everyday experiences and feelings.
*   **C: Makau grup yin hta ningmu jahpaw ai lam jaw ai (Writing about a specific group of people):** The passage doesn't emphasize writing exclusively about a specific group. While bloggers might discuss groups, personal experiences and feelings are the primary focus.

Here's why:

The text states that blogging is a way to ""express one's feelings and experiences"" (Oravec, 2002). Option C directly aligns with this by describing blogging as the act of ""expressing one's feelings and experiences through their own words."" The text also highlights that bloggers often share personal stories and perspectives (""Toto, 2004""), which is reflected in option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ganghkau ntsa na rai ni hpe jahkring hkring htai ai lam (The act of regularly visiting the news):** This describes news consumption, not blogging.
* **B: Mara tam hkat ai lam ni hpe koi gam mayu ai myit (The act of collecting information from many sources):**  While bloggers might gather information, it's not the core defining characteristic of blogging as presented in the text.
* **D: Arau galaw na matu ra ai lam (The act of interacting with others):**  While interaction can happen on blogs, the text primarily focuses on self-expression, not necessarily conversation.

Npu e jaw da ai asynchronous matut mahkai lam hta na jawng ma ni a matu akyu n nga ai gaw hpa baw rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Internet ganghkau hpe arawng arang hku jai lang ai** (The internet has become widely used).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how asynchronous communication, like email, has become prevalent due to the internet and World Wide Web.** It specifically states ""Internet hte World Wide Web jai lang ai gaw hkaja ai ni a matu aten tup shiga lamang ni hpe mai hkaja na ahkang nga ai"" (The internet and World Wide Web have emerged as a new era, allowing people to communicate asynchronously).
* **Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the passage.** While some of them might be *characteristics* of asynchronous communication, the *reason* for its widespread use, as highlighted in the passage, is the rise of the internet.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the widespread use of the internet is the primary reason for the prevalence of asynchronous communication."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai asynchronous matut mahkai lam hta jawng ma ni a matu galai gachyai n loi ai lam gaw hpa rai ta?","The correct answer is **D: Internet hpe jai lang ai lam** (The way that emerged with the internet).

Here's why:

* **The text describes asynchronous communication as something that emerged with the internet and World Wide Web.** It states, ""Internet hte World Wide Web jai lang ai gaw hkaja ai ni a matu aten tup shiga lamang ni hpe mai hkaja na ahkang nga ai."" (The internet and World Wide Web are a new era where communication has been able to be received at the same time.)
* **The text further elaborates on the characteristics of asynchronous communication,** mentioning delayed responses and the ability to post information for others to read later. These are features heavily reliant on internet technology.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Sharin hkam la na lagaw lahkam (Traditional communication methods):** Asynchronous communication is *not* a traditional method.
* **B: Bungli galaw ai ahkying ni (The era of delay):** While delay is a characteristic of asynchronous communication, it doesn't define *how* this communication became possible.
* **C: Sharin ai lam hta lang ai rai ni (The way that emerged on the sharing path):** This is too vague and doesn't specifically point to the technology that enabled asynchronous communication.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is **D: Internet hpe jai lang ai lam**."
Ka-ang wundang prat a langchyi ni hte seng na Matsing masat ga yan hta n sang lang dan da ai lam gaw hpa rai ta?,"The correct answer is **B: Marai lahkawng gumra jawn nna gasat ai**.

Here's why:

* **The question (P)** asks about the reason behind the unusual behavior of Hkaw Hkam Arthur – why he shares his dreams/visions with others, and why he doesn't share his spiritual experiences. It implies a connection between his dream sharing and a feeling of being overwhelmed or lacking control.
* **The answer (A) - Ga hku (the source)** - While it might be *a* reason, it's not the *primary* or most directly addressed concern in the passage.
* **The answer (C) - Share shagan ni hkan sa ra ai htung tara (the reason for not sharing dreams)** - The passage actually states he *does* share dreams, so this is incorrect.
* **The answer (D) - Gumra jawn share shagan (sharing spiritual experiences)** -  The passage specifically notes he *doesn't* share his spiritual experiences.
* **The answer (B) - Marai lahkawng gumra jawn nna gasat ai (feeling overwhelmed/suffocated by dreams)** - The passage describes how he's burdened by his dreams and feels like he's suffocating.  This feeling of being overpowered or suffocated by his dreams *likely* explains why he shares them, as a way to release that pressure.

Therefore, option B best captures the underlying reason for Hkaw Hkam Arthur's behavior, as described in the text.



"
Langchyi hten run ai hta myi gale kau ya ai sama shing nrai nsen ni hpe npu e jaw da ai Matsing masat hta n sang lang dan da ai gaw hpa baw rai?,"Let's break down the question and the context to find the correct answer.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text describes a situation where a person (Htung hking hte seng ai ka-ang) is struggling with difficulty and despair.  They feel trapped, longing for release and a better future. The mention of ""Hkaw Hkam Arthur"" (likely a metaphor for help or guidance) and the longing for a different life are key. The text also questions about finding happiness, dealing with hardship, and the reasons behind suffering.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

The question asks *why* the Matsing (a type of fish) is repeatedly seen running against the current. The options offer different reasons for this behavior.

**Analyzing the Options:**

* **A: Kasat majan ni (Strong current):** This is a literal description, but it doesn't explain *why* the fish runs *against* the current.

* **B: Hkrit ai (Stubborn):** While the fish's behavior might appear stubborn, attributing it solely to stubbornness doesn't provide a comprehensive answer.

* **C: Hkik hkam ai lusha poi ni (Desperate fish):** This option aligns well with the overall theme of struggle and longing for release from the text. The fish's relentless effort against the current can be interpreted as a desperate attempt to reach a better place or overcome obstacles.

* **D: Lahkru ni (Foolish fish):**  This option presents a negative judgment of the fish. It doesn't address the underlying reason *why* the fish might behave this way.

**Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: Hkik hkam ai lusha poi ni (Desperate fish).**  The fish's running against the current can be interpreted as a desperate act to escape hardship or reach a desired destination, paralleling the despair and longing expressed in the text.



**Final Answer: C**

Npu e jaw da ai hta na Kirby Muxloe Castle a teng ai hku hpaw hpyan da ai lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Gawgap ai ten hta mungdan kata simsa ai shingra tara a majaw ninghkap dap kachyi mi sha ra ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""1480 ning hta, ndai gaw sharawt lam hpe Lord Hastings wa e woi galaw hpang wa ai shaloi gaw ndai mungdan kaw gaw simsa lam nga wa nna shim lum lam a matu gaw ajawt hkawm nna sa hkawm ai masha uhpung kaji ni hpe dinghkap gasat ra lai wa ai re.""  This translates to: ""In 1480, it was under the command of Lord Hastings that the land was enclosed by a high fence, and the surrounding areas were dug up and enclosed with a strong wall.""

* **Option B reflects this:** ""Gawgap ai ten hta mungdan kata simsa ai shingra tara a majaw ninghkap dap kachyi mi sha ra ai"" translates to ""It was enclosed by a high fence, and the surrounding areas were dug up and enclosed with a strong wall.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Castle a htat la ai bunghku ni gaw Lord Hastings a hpyi shawn ai lam re"" -  ""The fence that surrounded the castle was under Lord Hastings' command.""  While Lord Hastings was involved, the passage emphasizes *enclosing the land*, not just the fence itself.
* **C:** ""Castle hpe gawgap ai gaw dai aten na matu kaja ai aten nre"" - ""The castle was enclosed, and it was a fence that was dug up."" This is a confusing and incorrect paraphrase.
* **D:** ""Galu nna myit dawdan da ai gasat gala ni hpe hkam jan lu na matu gawgap da ai re"" - ""It was enclosed by a strong wall that was dug up with earth."" This is a partially correct statement but doesn't fully encompass the meaning of the passage.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks about what happened to the castle of Kirby Muxloe after 1480.
* **The provided text (P)** states that in 1480, Lord Hastings' forces attacked and destroyed the castle, causing its walls and buildings to collapse.

Therefore, the answer is that the castle was destroyed. Option C, ""Nkau langchyi ni hta na ninghkap dap yawm ai"" which translates to ""It was completely destroyed in the civil war,"" accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hku wat kaba ni** (It is a historical fact): While the information in P is historical, this option doesn't specifically answer the question about the fate of the castle.
* **B: Gasat gala lam ni hpe madi shadaw ya lu na matu npawt hkridun gawgap da wa ai** (It was evacuated and left empty due to the civil war): The text states the castle was destroyed, not just evacuated.
* **D: Shakum ni hpa ai** (It remains as it is): The text clearly indicates the castle was destroyed and is no longer intact."

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where someone is severely ill and suffering.** It mentions symptoms like fever, chills, trembling, and being unable to move.  It emphasizes the need for intervention to ""heal"" and ""restore"" the person.
* **The question asks who is typically sought for help in such a situation.** The question implies a traditional or spiritual solution.
* **Option D directly addresses this:** It states that a person who is not bound by rules (likely referring to a shaman or spiritual healer) is sought for healing through rituals and prayers.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ginhtawng ta hta mungdan hpe shing grup nna lagat shaman ai:** While shamans might be involved, the passage focuses on *healing* and not just religious practices within a group.
* **B: Shaman ai ten hta chyang shadang hpe maju jung nna shaman ra ai:** This option is too specific and doesn't cover the broader context of seeking help for severe illness.
* **C: Minit masum ram aten jaw ai:** This translates to ""a pure and innocent person."" While purity might be valued, the passage doesn't directly connect healing to a person's innocence.



Therefore, **D** best aligns with the passage's description and the question's intent.

"Matsing masat hta tsun da ai hte maren, alat ningshawng-madang mile daw chyen lagat ai wa na matunpu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara mahtang gaw ahkyak dik re ai kun?","The correct answer is **B: Lagat ai chyang shadang hta hkumhkrang hkam lu ai atsam hpe shaman ra ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a shaman's role:** The passage details a shaman's abilities and responsibilities in dealing with various issues – from preventing sickness to helping with difficult situations. It emphasizes the shaman's power to interact with the spiritual realm (""shaman ra ai"").
* **Option B directly reflects this:** Option B states that the shaman interacts with the spiritual forces responsible for causing harm or misfortune. This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of a shaman's duties.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Nshung ta na shata ni lagat shaman ai:** This is too general. While a shaman might be called upon for help, the passage focuses on the shaman's active role in *dealing* with problems, not just being called upon.
* **C: Minit lahkawng npu hta aten jep ra ai:** This refers to a specific ritual or action, not the shaman's overall role. The passage is broader than just mentioning a specific ritual.
* **D: Hkumhkrang hkam lu ai atsam hta hkan nna chyang shadang hpe shaman ra:** This is partially correct but less precise than option B. While a shaman *might* use spiritual forces to counteract harm, option B more accurately reflects the shaman's proactive engagement with those forces.

Therefore, **B** is the most fitting answer based on the provided passage."
"Ginsup ninghkrin matu, npu e jaw da ai hta n-gun rawng ai lusha sha shaman ai lam hte sha n mai byin ai lam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Galaw shamu shamawt ai lam ni ningtawn wa ai**

Here's why:

The question asks about the path to achieving spiritual power (ginsup ninghkrin) and the path to becoming a shaman. The text says:

""...ngut nna tatup galaw ni hpa atsawm sha chye na ai gaw ginsaup ai ni hpe shanhte na galaw ai lam hpe grau kaja shangu nna galaw ai bungli hpe grau manu shadan wa na re.""

Translation: ""...the path of spiritual power is achieved by focusing on the breath, the body, and the mind; by mastering the mind and achieving a state of calm and focus, one can gain spiritual power.""

And:

""...shaman ai lam hte sha n mai byin ai lam gaw hpa rai?""

Translation: ""...What is the path to becoming a shaman and the path to achieving spiritual power?""

The text directly links the path to spiritual power (ginsup ninghkrin) with the path of focusing on breath, body, and mind, and achieving calmness and focus. Therefore, the path to becoming a shaman (and achieving spiritual power) is the same as the path to achieving spiritual power, which is **""Galaw shamu shamawt ai lam ni ningtawn wa ai""** (the path of focusing on breath, body, and mind).

"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, asak kaji ai ginsup ninghkrin ni hpe shanhte a ginsup hpan hta myit pyaw lam tam lu na matu npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa hpe hpaji n jaw da ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Hkam kaja ai n-gun atsam hpe shadaw ya ai**

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q)** asks about the reason *why* something is shaking and swaying, specifically referencing the shaman's movements. It's asking about the cause of the trembling.

* **The Passage (P)** describes a shaman's ritualistic movements, involving shaking, swaying, and dancing. It mentions that they move with rhythm and use gestures to communicate and connect with the spiritual world. It also describes the shaman's physical state as a result of the ritual – experiencing a kind of transformation.

* **Option D (""Hkam kaja ai n-gun atsam hpe shadaw ya ai"" -  ""Shaking and swaying with the rhythm of the heart and body"")** directly reflects the description in the passage and answers the question about *why* the shaman is shaking and swaying.  It connects the physical movement to the internal state and the ritual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Htap htuk ai lusha sha shaman ai (""The shaman's spiritual power is shaking"")** While the passage mentions spiritual connection, it doesn't attribute the shaking to the shaman's spiritual *power* directly. The passage focuses on the physical movement *resulting* from the spiritual connection.
* **B: Ningtawn ai madang hta dingyang matut galaw shakut ai (""Shaking and swaying due to the rhythm of the world"")** The passage doesn't suggest the shaking is *caused* by the general rhythm of the world, but rather the rhythm of the shaman's own heart and body *within* the ritual.
* **C: Hka dat hpe jahpring ya ai (""Being possessed by a spirit"")** The passage doesn't specifically mention possession. While shamanism often involves communication with spirits, the primary focus is on the shaman's own movement and experience within the ritual.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate and direct answer based on the information provided.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa majaw ka-ang sumsan ginsup ninghkrin wa gaw grai hpu ai arai ni hpe mari na kun?","The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw shanhte dinghkrai a ra sharawng lam hte seng ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation of great suffering and hardship.** It mentions people facing famine, poverty, and difficult conditions (""malawng gaw kaji mi sha re nna tatut bungli hta dai ram masan nsa ma ai"").
* **The question asks about a situation where people have endured great suffering and hardship.**
* **Option A translates to ""It is the path where the people have suffered the most.""** This aligns directly with the description in the passage.
* **The other options don't fit:**
    * **B:** ""It is the path where the people have been deceived."" The passage doesn't focus on deception.
    * **C:** ""It is the path where the people have been deceived and have been exploited."" Similar to B, deception and exploitation aren't the core theme.
    * **D:** ""It is the path where the people have been separated from their families and have shut themselves off from the world."" While the passage implies separation and difficulty, it doesn't explicitly state family separation or shutting oneself off.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text and question."
Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren ka-ang sumtsan lagat ai hta hpa baw ra na kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Gaw gap da ngut sai ginsup ninghkrin labau**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a difficult situation.** It talks about hardship (""ka-ang sumtsan wunkat manu nhpu ai hku na ginsup hpan langai re""), difficult times (""raitim dai hta e shang lawm na matu hkinghku nkau mi shakap lang ra ai hte seng na chye na shut ai lam ni grai nga ai""), and a harsh environment (""law malawng gaw kaji mi sha re nna tatut bungli hta dai ram masan nsa ma ai"").  It mentions struggling and having to endure (""Ginsup ninghkring ni gaw shahte ra yang a myet nlu jaw tim dai gunrai hpe mahtang grau ra ma ai"").

* **The question asks how to survive or cope.**  ""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren ka-ang sumtsan lagat ai hta hpa baw ra na kun?"" translates to ""When food is scarce and people are suffering, how can one survive?"".

* **Option B (""Gaw gap da ngut sai ginsup ninghkrin labau"") means ""Work hard and rely on wisdom/ingenuity"".** This is the most logical response to the situation described in the passage.  Enduring hardship requires both physical effort and cleverness to find solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Arung arai law law (""Everything is great""):**  Directly contradicts the passage's description of hardship.
* **C: kaji kajaw rai (""Just a little bit""):** Doesn't address the scale of the problem.  A little bit isn't enough when food is scarce.
* **D: Gumhpraw grai law (""Everything is easy""):**  Contradicts the entire passage.



Therefore, **B** is the most appropriate answer.

Nuclear hpri sharaw dat kadu nsen hpe kadai mu tam da ai kun? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch hte Purcell**.

The passage states: ""MRI gaw Felix Bloch (Stanford Dakkasu hta magam gun) hte Edward Purcell (Harvard Dakkasu hta magam gun) kaw nna shaning 1930 hkan mu sawk la nna..."" This directly indicates that Bloch and Purcell collaborated on the initial work related to NMR.

"Matsing masat ga hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaga masha ni a hkrang hte seng ai lachyum hpyan na matu shinggyim masha ni gaw gara hpe ngang kang ai hku nna chye da ra na kun?","The correct answer is **B: Yaw shada lam**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where someone (Shinggyim Masha ni) is being treated unfairly. They are being blamed and made to suffer despite not being at fault. The passage emphasizes the injustice and the feeling of being wronged.

The question asks what the wronged person (Shinggyim Masha ni) will do in response to this injustice.  The passage states: ""Ga shadawn, lama nang hku na mawdaw pat hpe langai ngai shaga ai hpe nang mu yang, nang gaw dai wa jasam a mawdaw hpe lagu na shakut taw ai ngu nang tak la na re. Lama shi gaw shi mawdaw zaw shamat kau ai rai yang ngu ai hte shi mawdaw hpe shi nan jahten taw ai rai yang ngu ai, shi hpe tara dara ai lam nmai bung ai.""

This translates to: ""In the future, if the lama doesn't listen to your words, you will remain silent and do nothing.  The lama, if they completely ignore your words, will be angered and scold you, and if they completely dismiss your words, they will be completely destroyed.""

The options describe different responses:

* **A: Myit ra lam (Byin mai ai hkrang hte shamawt hkawm ai lam ni hkrang):**  This means ""to remain silent and endure."" While a possibility, the passage indicates a more active response is possible.
* **B: Yaw shada lam (Yaw shada lam):** This means ""to seek justice/revenge."" The passage implies that this is a possible action the wronged person might take.
* **C: Makam:** This means ""to flee/escape.""  The passage doesn't suggest fleeing.
* **D: Ningmu:** This means ""to forgive/pardon.""  The passage doesn't suggest forgiveness.

Therefore, **Yaw shada lam (seeking justice/revenge)** is the most fitting response based on the passage.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks what happens to the ""shinggyim masha ni"" (the one who is obsessed with Shinggyim Masha) when the ""yaw shada lam"" (the path of courage) is taken.
* **The passage (A)** describes the negative consequences of being obsessed with Shinggyim Masha. It states that when someone follows the path of courage, they will be freed from the obsession, and the obsession will be overcome. It also mentions that those who are still obsessed will be left behind.
* **Option C** accurately reflects this consequence: ""The one obsessed with Shinggyim Masha will be freed and overcome by the path of courage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hkrang hte seng ai lam ni hta n jaw n teng ai lam ni hta koi gam na matu (Those who are blind and deaf will be left behind)** - While the passage mentions being left behind, it doesn't specifically link this to blindness or deafness.
* **B: Myit ra lam hpe tak yu na matu (They will be left behind on the path of water)** - The passage doesn't mention a ""path of water.""
* **D: Kaga masha ni a myit hpe hti na matu (They will be overcome by the obsession of the one who is obsessed)** - This option contradicts the passage, which states the obsession will be *overcome*, not strengthened.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and logical answer based on the provided text."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai hta na AI a madung yaw shada lam ginchyum gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: Bungli hpe shi hkrai galaw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes AI as able to learn and mimic human behavior.** It mentions AI can ""shaprawt ai lam lawm ai"" (learn and imitate) and ""shi hkrai shi rawng nna bungli chye galaw wa ai jak hpe lu shaprawt ai"" (learn from data and mimic the behavior of humans).
* **The question asks about the nature of AI's learning.**  The passage indicates that AI learns by analyzing data (""hpaji hta zai arawn alai shi hkrai shi rawng nna bungli chye galaw wa ai jak hpe lu shaprawt ai lam lawm ai"").
* **Option D, ""Bungli hpe shi hkrai galaw ai"" (mimicking/imitating behavior), aligns directly with the passage's description of AI's learning process.** AI doesn't *understand* things in the human sense; it learns to *predict* and *generate* outputs based on patterns in data, effectively imitating human-like responses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lamang galaw ai (just moving/operating):** This is too simplistic. The passage clearly states AI *learns*.
* **B: Nsen matsing masat da ai (thinking/reasoning):** While AI can appear to reason, the passage emphasizes its learning from data rather than genuine thought processes.  The passage doesn't imply AI *thinks* like a human.
* **C: lamang hparan ai (just imitating):** While AI *does* imitate, the passage focuses more on the *learning* aspect that enables the imitation.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate reflection of the passage's information about how AI learns."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e madun da ai hta AI hte matut mahkai lam nga ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Myit shingran hpungtang hpaji lam (Computer application lam)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes AI's ability to analyze vast amounts of data from computer applications and identify patterns.  It mentions using AI to understand trends in various areas like politics, economics, and social behavior, and predicting future events. The question asks how AI can help in these areas.  Option C, ""Computer application lam"" (Computer application path), directly addresses this by suggesting that AI's assistance comes through its application within computer systems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manam hpe galaw lajang ya ai lam (Human intelligence path):** While AI can mimic human intelligence, the passage focuses on the AI *application* rather than comparing it directly to human intelligence.
* **B: Lamang galaw ai hte lamang hparan ai (Path of both movement and creation):**  This is too broad. While AI does both, the passage highlights the *analysis* of data within computer applications more specifically.
* **D: Lata laika hpe matsing da ya ai lam (Path of predicting the future):** While AI *can* help with prediction, the question is about *how* it helps, and the passage focuses on its data analysis capabilities within computer applications.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate response to the question based on the provided passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the characteristics of a ""Shara langai"" (likely a type of traditional dwelling or house).**  It mentions its location, construction materials, and the way it's built.
* **The question asks what makes a ""Matsing masat"" (another dwelling type) different from a ""Shara langai.""**
* **Option C directly addresses this difference.** It states that a ""Matsing masat"" is built without the traditional structure (Manghkang ni) and instead uses a different method of construction.  This aligns with the passage's descriptions of the Shara langai.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Manghkang langai a matu jaw ai mahtai grai law shapraw ya ai (It's built using the traditional construction techniques).** This is the *opposite* of what the question is asking.
* **B: Manghkang langai hta ladat nnan ni jai lang ya ai (It's built according to the traditions of the Manghkang langai).**  Again, this describes the Shara langai, not what makes the Matsing masat different.
* **D: Myit dum ai (It's simple).** The passage doesn't focus on simplicity as a defining characteristic of either dwelling.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately answers the question based on the information provided in the passage."

Here's why:

The question asks what Shara's father (matsing) did with the lizard (langai) that was ""grown"" (maren) and had its tail cut (tsun da ai). The passage describes the father as someone who is ""lawnglam ni hpe madi shadaw ai,"" which translates to ""someone who is skilled in using the lawnglam (a type of traditional basket) and making things.""

The passage details how the father uses the lizard's body parts to create various things:

*   The lizard's claws are used to make a container.
*   The lizard's scales are used to make a colorful object.
*   The lizard's tail is used to make a decoration.
*   The lizard's bones are used to make a small musical instrument.
*   The lizard's head is used to decorate a basket.

Therefore, the father's action with the lizard is related to **skillfully using the lawnglam (basket) and making things.**
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw micro-expression ngun mai sawn la ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Lata yungnu sharawt ai** (Smiling or lip twitching).

Here's why:

The passage discusses Oliver Sacks' work with patients who had unusual neurological conditions. One patient, affected by a condition causing him to be unable to consciously control his facial expressions, would often smile or twitch his lips involuntarily. This involuntary smiling is an example of a micro-expression, which are fleeting, unconscious facial expressions that reveal a person's true emotions.

Therefore, option D, ""Lata yungnu sharawt ai"" (Smiling or lip twitching), directly relates to the description of involuntary facial movements mentioned in the passage as an example of a micro-expression.

Npu e jaw da ai laika kaw nna myi hte nmu lu ai myi man nsam lachyum hta ai seng nna n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Video nsen rim ai lam ni gaw mu mada ai hku nna rawt jat wa ai**

Here's why:

The text describes how Oliver Sacks studied a patient with a neurological condition that caused him to perceive objects in a distorted way. The patient would see a small twig as a large, intricate sculpture. This demonstrates that the video being described is likely a representation of this neurological condition - a distortion of perception where the brain misinterprets visual information. Therefore, the video is depicting how the brain can create false or distorted realities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jaw ai hku lachyum hta ai gaw masu magaw lam hpe chye hkun ai:** While the patient's experience is unusual, the text doesn't say the other people involved are trying to deceive anyone.
* **C: Ga shaga ai hte myi man nsam ni hta mung lachyum hta la mai ai:** The text doesn't mention the patient mistaking things for food.
* **D: Dai gaw myit malang ai lam hpe dawdan ya ai:** While the patient perceives things differently, the text doesn't say he's literally ""walking on walls.""

Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects the core idea of the text, which is the distortion of perception shown in the video."
Npu e jaw da ai hta na Renaissance ngu ai Greek hpaji myit sawn ai lam a mahtai hku nna grau ahkyak wa ai kun? ,"The correct answer is **C: Laika hku bai shaga ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Renaissance ngu ai Greek hpaji myit sawn ai lam gaw sharin hkaja na matu shani sa wa ai ladat hte hpaji byeng nya hpe chyam bra hkra garan kachyan ai lam hta kaba ai dandawng ai galai shai ai lam hpe galaw ya wa sai.""

This translates roughly to: ""The path of Renaissance, inspired by Greek philosophy,  **started with** the analysis of the soul and the development of philosophical studies, and then proceeded towards the foundations of scientific research.""

Therefore, the Renaissance's Greek philosophical influence *began with* the analysis of the soul and philosophical studies. Option C, ""Laika hku bai shaga ai"" (Started with...) most accurately reflects this initial stage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dinghkrai bai shaga yu ai** (Always continuing): The passage doesn't say the influence is *always* continuing, but describes an initial phase.
*   **B: machye machyang shabra shachyam ai lam** (The path of the analysis of the soul): While the soul analysis is *part* of it, it doesn't encompass the *entire* initial stage described.
*   **D: Shiga lu la ai lam** (The path of the beginning): While the influence is a beginning, the passage mentions the analysis of the soul and philosophical studies before the scientific research path. ""Laika hku bai shaga ai"" is a more accurate descriptor of this sequence.

This translates to: ""Following the old way, the path of the Renaissance Greek philosophical school, which emphasizes reason and the pursuit of knowledge, has been walked and will be walked again.""

The question asks: ""What is the major reason for the resurgence of the Greek philosophical school during the Renaissance?""

The passage clearly links the Renaissance's renewed interest in Greek philosophy to its emphasis on **reason and the pursuit of knowledge**.  Option D, ""Shiga ni chyam bra ai"" (the path of reason and the pursuit of knowledge), directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dinghkrai bai shaga yu ai** (Always walking the path of the old way) - The passage indicates a *resurgence* of interest, not a constant adherence to the old ways.
* **B: Shiga la ai** (Following the old way) -  This is too vague.  While the Renaissance looked back, it wasn't simply *following* the old way. It was a renewed *engagement* with it, driven by new intellectual energy.
* **C: Laika hku bai shaga ai** (The path of knowledge) - While knowledge is part of it, the passage explicitly mentions *reason* as a key component, making Option D a more complete and accurate answer.



Therefore, **D: Shiga ni chyam bra ai** is the most fitting answer."
Matut manoi ganawn mazum na matu internet hpe jai lang na myit sharawt ya ai lam hku nna lawu kaw gara hpe nlu sawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Bu hkawm ai lam ni hpe sawk tam ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks what significantly influences the extent to which people use the internet for social interaction. The provided text states:

*   ""Dinghkrai shang lawm ai lam"" (communication-oriented uses) and ""matut manoi ganawn mazum ai lam"" (content-oriented uses) are significantly influenced by the number of website visits a user makes.
*   Eighmey and McCord (1998) found that the number of website visits a user makes has a significant impact on how they utilize the internet for social interaction.

Therefore, the more a person uses the internet (visits websites), the more likely they are to use it for social interaction. Option C directly reflects this influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sut masa hte seng ai hkridun (Emotional and intellectual development):** While the internet *can* contribute to these, the text focuses specifically on *social* interaction, not broader developmental aspects.
*   **B: Nta masha ni hte galoi mung matut mahkai lam nga ai (Technical skills and computer proficiency):** Technical skills are necessary, but the text emphasizes the *use* of the internet, not the proficiency in using it.
*   **D: Masha nnan ni hte hkrum zup ai (Financial status and education):**  The text doesn't mention financial status or education as factors influencing internet usage for social interaction.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara gaw dinghkrai shang lawm ai a matu internet jai ai lam hte seng nna myit sharawt ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Tsi mawan hte seng ai gun rai ni hpe sawk tam ai** (Often used for things that are not well-known and do not have a lot of popularity).

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Dinghkrai shang lawm ai lam"" (popular/well-known things) and ""matut manoi ganawn mazum ai lam"" (things that are not well-known) have different levels of user engagement on websites.  Specifically, the passage implies that less popular things (not well-known and not popular) are more likely to have a significant number of users exploring them.  The question asks about the *reason* for this difference.

Option C directly reflects this: ""Tsi mawan hte seng ai gun rai ni hpe sawk tam ai"" suggests that because things are not well-known or popular, people are more likely to *explore* them and therefore use them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shadu sha ladat ni tam ai** (Often used for lengthy things): The passage doesn't connect length to popularity or user engagement.
* **B: Bawng jahkrum board nsta post mara ai** (Often posted on community bulletin boards): While this *could* be a way to promote less popular things, the passage doesn't directly discuss bulletin boards.
* **D: Gumhpraw ni hpe hparan ai** (Often promoted by media):  Again, the passage doesn't link media promotion to user engagement on websites in relation to popularity.

Sinna Uropa gaw shingkang shingna hta shamyen shanat ai lam hpe jahkring kau nna tinang hkrang hte galoi kaw nna hpang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka-ang prat 25 ning ram na ai hpang (The 25th and 30th centuries)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Raitim mung, matut mahkai lam hta lanyan ai majaw, sinna maga de na maka hkrang gaw shaning 25 kaw na 30 daram hpang hkyat mat ai re.""  This translates to: ""However, the rising power of the Byzantine Empire, based in the 25th and 30th centuries, helped to drive the Islamic expansion back.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions the 25th and 30th centuries as a time when the Byzantine Empire played a role in halting the Islamic expansion.  The other options are incorrect based on the passage.
"
Hkindang ni hpe lang nna bu hpun ni hpe gyit shajup ai gaw hpa baw na mahtai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: The Gothic aten ladaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Makam masham majan ni a mahtai hku nna dai aten hta na kaba dik htum ai bawng ring wa ai lam langai mi gaw, masha ni gaw hkindang ni hpe labu hpun palawng ni hpe gyit hkang ai lam hta jai lang hpang lai wa ai lam rai nga ai."" This translates to: ""People who are very religious and have a strong belief in God, the later Gothic period, were inclined towards worshipping God through beautiful and elaborate buildings.""

Therefore, the Gothic period is directly linked to the construction of beautiful and elaborate buildings for worshipping God. The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **B: The Byzantine prat:** While Byzantine architecture was influential, the passage focuses on the Gothic period's unique approach.
*   **C: Makam masham majan ten:** Religious people in general are not the primary focus; the passage specifically discusses the Gothic period.
*   **D: Ka-ang prat ten ni:** This translates to ""Later period"" and isn't specific enough to be the answer.

**In short, the passage directly connects the Gothic period with the construction of buildings dedicated to worshipping God.**"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna shingra tara hte seng ai mayak ni a matu gara hpe longterm mahtai ngu nna mai sawn la ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Manghkang byin hkun ai lam ni hpe sawk tam ai** (Spending more time on the path of self-cultivation).

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where the speaker feels stuck and unhappy because they are focused on external validation and desires (""shamu shamawt lama hta shang lawm,"" ""ana law malawng kaw"").  They are chasing fleeting pleasures and not cultivating inner peace (""jahkring jahkra mahtai hpe sha ra ai nre yang"").

The question asks how to achieve long-term happiness. The passage implies that long-term happiness comes from changing one's inner state and focusing on self-cultivation.  Option C directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ladu lai jai ai nga sat nga sa hpe ninghkap ai (Nurturing one's own desires and ambitions):** The passage criticizes focusing on desires, not nurturing them.
* **B: Myit rawt shanglawm ai ni (A path of external validation):**  The passage criticizes relying on external validation.
* **D: Shingra tara shamu shamawt ai lam hta jinghku byin wa na (Being distracted by chasing fleeting pleasures):** The passage describes the negative consequences of being distracted by fleeting pleasures, not as a path to long-term happiness.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

Here's why:

The passage describes someone who is always looking down on others and believes they are superior. They are condescending and enjoy belittling people. The question asks what type of person would be described this way. Option C directly matches this description: ""Ladu lai jai ai nga sat nga sa lam hte seng ai ningmu ni htawng madun wa ai"" translates to ""A person who enjoys looking down on others and despises those they consider inferior.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Myit rawt let shanglawm ai (Looking down on others):** While the passage mentions looking down on others, this option is too general. The passage describes a more malicious and enjoyment-based attitude.
* **B: Manghkang ni a ru npawt hpe pat kau ai (Being envious of others' possessions):** Envy is mentioned as one aspect of the person's behavior, but it's not the core of their character as described. The passage focuses more on their superiority complex and condescending attitude.
* **D: Shingra tara hte grau hku hkau ai lam hku nga ai (Being angry and jealous of those who are happy):**  While the passage hints at potential jealousy, the overarching description is about a feeling of superiority and enjoyment in looking down on others, not just anger at happiness.



"
Nawku hpung hte seng ai hta ana hte grau seng ai ngu ai madung mayak kata Uropa hta gara mungdan gaw shawng nnan majan byin hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Spain**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions Spain and its Moorish influence (""Spain a Majan dang hkring htawng dagraw ai lam gaw shawng nna majan hta gin jaw a masing re ai ahkang aya shingdaw shangang ai lam hpe masat da sai.""). It states that Spain's history shows the influence of Moorish culture and that European countries with significant Moorish influence have a distinct cultural heritage. The passage further implies that Spain is a key example of this.

The other options are not mentioned in the passage as having a significant Moorish influence in the way Spain does.
"
Gara majan hpe makam masham hte seng ai hpang jahtum majan ngu tsun ma ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sumshi ning na ai Majan (The majority of the population's language)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai majaw, shaning sumshi majan gaw makam masham majan a hpang chyhtum rai wa sai re.""  This translates to: ""Therefore, the majority of the languages are the languages of the majority of the population.""

Option A, ""Sumshi ning na ai Majan,"" directly reflects this statement. The passage implies that the languages spoken by the majority of people in Europe are the most widely used and therefore the most ""common"" or ""spread."" The other options refer to specific examples or actions related to language, but they don't represent the overarching principle stated in the passage."
Npu e jaw da ai hta Cahtolic Nawku jawng a gara ningmu hpe n jep da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Nawku jawng kata na madung hkam la da ai masa ni hpe hkan sa na nga yang.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the Catholic Church *influences* (hkan sa) governments in Europe. It mentions the church's power and influence over political decisions and laws. Option D accurately reflects this influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nawku hpung kata sutgan garan ya ai lam gaw htap htuk ai rai yang** (The way they interpret sacred texts is a reason.) - While interpretation plays a role, the passage focuses more on direct influence on governments.
* **B: Nawku hpung kata hkam la da ai madung hkam la ai masa ni hpe byeng ra ai yang** (The way they practice their religion is a reason.) - The passage doesn't emphasize *how* they practice religion as the primary reason for influence, but rather the influence itself.
* **C: Nawku jawng kata ngun atsam pawng hpawn shang lawm lam** (The church's power and authority are a reason.) -  While power and authority are factors, the passage is more about how that power translates into influencing governments, not just the power itself.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Versailles hta kadai sat kau hkrum ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Sin langa**.

The passage states: ""Versailles na hkawhkam jan shawng kaw hkawhkam wang sin langa hpe langai hpe sat kau ai.""  This translates to: ""The nobles of Versailles were irritated by the extravagance of the royal court.""  ""Sin langa"" means ""extravagance"" or ""lavishness.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gat kadat na num langai mi re (The nobles who were in the government):** While nobles were part of the government, the passage specifically focuses on their irritation with the *extravagance* of the court, not their political role.
* **B: Hkawhkam Louis XVI (King Louis XVI):** The passage doesn't directly say Louis XVI was the source of the irritation. It's the court's extravagance that caused the issue.
* **C: Masah nmat uhpung a hpung shang masha (The common people's hunger):** The passage mentions the common people's hunger as a contributing factor to the revolution, but it doesn't say the nobles of Versailles were irritated by the common people's hunger.

Here's why:

The passage states that the people of Paris were angry because the nobles and the king were living in luxury while they were suffering. Option A directly reflects this cause: ""The nobles and the king were living in luxury while the people were suffering.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Versailles kaw nna kajawng kaja le ai:** While the nobles lived in Versailles, the core reason for the unrest was their perceived lavish lifestyle *compared to the people's suffering*. The location itself isn't the primary cause.
*   **C: Sin langa hpe htau sat ai ningmu:** This option is vague and doesn't directly relate to the stated causes of the revolution.
*   **D: Paris de bai nhtang awa ai hkrun lam:** This refers to the events in Paris, but not the *reason* for the revolution itself. It describes *what* happened, not *why* it happened.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is A.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Britain hpe panglai shara shagu na gara sanghpaw hpe tim, ka-ang nga sanghpaw ni hpe hkra machyi wa shangun na hpe tim makawp lu na matu mungkang ga daga na kka ni hte pat nna gaw gap da ai re.""  This translates to: ""Britain, having learned from past experiences with political parties, carefully observes and studies the movements of other political parties, and then takes action to counter them.""

Option B directly reflects this observation and counter-action process. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** Germany's economic policies are mentioned, but they don't explain Britain's political analysis.
*   **C:** This describes a strategy but doesn't connect it to Britain's learning from political parties.
*   **D:** This describes a defensive action but not the process of understanding and responding to other parties.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that accurately summarizes the core idea presented in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Britain hpe panglai shara shagu na gara sanghpaw hpe tim, ka-ang nga sanghpaw ni hpe hkra machyi wa shangun na hpe tim makawp lu na matu mungkang ga daga na hka ni hte pat nna gaw gap da ai re.

This translates to: ""Britain, taking advantage of its superior naval power, aggressively attacked its rival nations, taking advantage of its naval dominance to attack its enemies from the sea.  At that time, Germany, having completely overcome its past weaknesses, built a strong navy and launched an attack on its enemies.""

The question asks how Britain's naval power contributed to Germany's war efforts. The passage directly links Britain's naval strength to Germany building its own strong navy *in response* and launching attacks. Therefore, Britain's naval power indirectly contributed by prompting Germany to strengthen its own naval capabilities. Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai gaw mungkan hte seng ai tara hpe ninghkap wa ai** (It was opening up the way for the strong naval power): While the passage discusses naval power, it doesn't state that the naval power *opened the way* for anything. It's more of a cause-and-effect relationship.
* **C: Dai gaw German karum ningtum hpung ni hpe kadawn kau hkun ai** (It was boosting German morale): The passage doesn't mention morale.
* **D: Dai gaw yu yu sanghpaw ni gaw dingbai dingna n jaw ai hpe shateng ya ai** (It was attacking the weak naval power): The passage focuses on Britain's strong naval power *attacking* rival nations, not specifically weakening the naval power of any one specific nation.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, Multiple Sclerosis ana gaw kadai ni kaw grau nna mai byin ai rai?","Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **C: Asak 43 ning re ai la** (Approximately 43 years old).

The text states: ""Sawk Lit gaw, ayi ni gaw ala ni hta MS lu ai lam hta htam lahkawng grau law nga ai lam hpe mu tam tawn ai. **Asak 43 ning re ai la**."" which translates to ""According to studies, people who get MS are mostly between **43 years old**.""



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, shamu shamawt lam hta ayan shang lawm ai ni gaw hpa na matu madi shadaw lam grau ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Machyi hkam sha ai ntsa e n kaja ai myit ningmu**. Here's why:

The question asks *why* the ""shamu shamawt"" (those who are envious and jealous) are so eager to elevate the ""machyi"" (the one who has been wronged). The text explains that those who are malicious and want to harm someone will spread false rumors and try to defame the person who has been wronged.  The ""machyi"" has been falsely accused, and their reputation is being damaged.  Therefore, those who are malicious are eager to elevate/exaggerate these false accusations to further harm the person who has been wronged.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mashi lawu (Wretched/Poor):** While the ""machyi"" might be in a difficult situation, the text focuses on the *actions* of the malicious individuals, not their overall state of being.
*   **C: Myit daw ai lam (The path of truth):**  The text describes the *opposite* of the path of truth – lies and defamation.
*   **D: Hkrit ai (Righteous/Just):**  The actions described are clearly *unrighteous* and *unjust*.

**In short, the malicious individuals are eager to elevate the false accusations because they are intentionally trying to harm the ""machyi"" by damaging their reputation. This is the core reason explained in the text.**"
"Matsing masat gayan hta mahta nna, zauhkyen hpe gara hku ginsup ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Dakkasu jawng madang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zauhkyen a prat dep ginsup hpan hpe gaw, jawng ma ni dakkasu kaw sharin la ai kaw na shabrai sha ai madang hte Olympic shingjawng poi ni kaw du hkra madang grai law ni hta ginsup nga ai re.""  This translates roughly to: ""When a person trains, they train with the training equipment they need, including the equipment used in the Olympic games.""

The question asks: ""What kind of equipment is used to train when training with the right equipment?"" This asks about the *type* of equipment.

The passage says the equipment is ""dakkasu jawng madang,"" which means ""training equipment and equipment.""  This is the most accurate answer based on the context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prat dep hpan hku nna:** This translates to ""The equipment used to achieve the goal."" It doesn't describe the *type* of equipment.
*   **C: Olympic ginsup ai madang:** This translates to ""Olympic training equipment."" While relevant, the passage emphasizes the general concept of needing the *right* equipment to train, not *specifically* Olympic equipment.
*   **D: Marai lahkawng ginsup ai hkrang:** This translates to ""Equipment used to train with the right technique.""  It focuses on technique, not the equipment itself.



Therefore, **B: Dakkasu jawng madang** is the most appropriate answer."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, npu e jaw da ai hta na gara gaw hkum kata kaw gung byin ai mabyin a n-gun ja dik ai madi madun re ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Grai sawng ai lasa gying ai hte kan machyi ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the opposite of the situation described in the paragraph. The paragraph describes a situation where someone is being forced to do something against their will, experiencing hardship, and feeling oppressed.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: Kraw galau ai hte hkum lum ai (Fearful and avoiding rules):** This doesn't directly address the core issue of being forced or oppressed.
* **B: Madawn ai hte salat pru ai (Kind and generous):** While positive, this doesn't represent the *opposite* of the hardship described. Kindness and generosity don't negate being forced or oppressed.
* **C: Grai sawng ai lasa gying ai hte kan machyi ai (Free and living in peace and happiness):** This option directly contrasts with the paragraph's description. Being free, peaceful, and happy is the opposite of being forced, experiencing hardship, and feeling oppressed.
* **D: Tsi bu a mastun (The burnt wood):** This is unrelated to the situation described.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate opposite of the situation described in the paragraph. It represents a state of freedom and well-being, directly contrasting with the oppression and hardship detailed in the text.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, tsim yam hkrum ai masha hpe dawdan ai hta shawng nnan galaw ra ai htap htuk ai lahkam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Tsim yam hkrum ai masha a arawng aya hpe jep ai** (To seize the opportunity when the enemy's strength is weak).

Here's why:

* **The Question:** The question asks what tactic is used when the enemy is weak.
* **The Text:** The text describes a strategy where you wait for the enemy to be weakened and then launch a swift attack to gain an advantage.  It emphasizes seizing the opportune moment.
* **Option C:** ""Tsim yam hkrum ai masha a arawng aya hpe jep ai"" directly translates to ""To seize the opportunity when the enemy's strength is weak,"" which perfectly captures the core principle described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mabyin shara hta sawk tam ai** (To attack aggressively and without pause). This is the opposite of what the text describes.
* **B: Tsim yam hkrum ai masha hpe sa shani ai** (To be cautious and observant). While observation is important, the text emphasizes taking action *when* the enemy is weak, not just being cautious.
* **D: Karum ai lam hpe lat ai** (To adhere strictly to the rules/orders). This is irrelevant to the situation described, which involves adapting strategy to the enemy's weakness.



"
Npu e jaw da ai hta na gara gaw tsim yam hkrum ai masha wa hpe san jep ai hpe tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Tsim yam hkrum ai masha a arawng aya hpe sawk sagawn u.**

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):** Asks *how* the government can resolve the issue of the insufficient supply of food and living necessities.
* **The Passage (P):**  States that the government is facing a shortage of food and essential goods. It then mentions that the government should prioritize the needs of the people and be transparent about its actions. It also suggests that the government should be proactive and prevent further shortages.

Let's analyze each option:

* **A: Nang hta lu ai nma hpe hkam jan lu na matu hkum tsang (You should avoid spreading rumors and misinformation).** While important in any situation, this doesn't directly address *how* to solve the food shortage.
* **B: Tsim yam hkrum ai masha hta shawng mabyin byin ai shara de shawng shang u (The government should sell the available goods at reasonable prices).** This is a *part* of a solution but doesn't address the underlying problem of insufficient supply.
* **C: Tsim yam hkrum ai masha a arawng aya hpe sawk sagawn u (The government should prioritize the needs of the people).**  This aligns perfectly with the passage's emphasis on prioritizing the people's needs and being proactive. Prioritizing would lead to better allocation of resources, potentially addressing the shortage.  It's a crucial step towards resolving the core problem.
* **D: Dawnghkawn ahkyeng ni hpe sadi maja ra ai (The government should be transparent about its actions).** Transparency is important, as mentioned in the passage, but it's a *means* to build trust, not a *solution* to the food shortage itself.

**Therefore, option C is the most direct and accurate answer to the question of how the government can resolve the food shortage, based on the provided passage.**  It highlights the fundamental principle of prioritizing the people's needs.



"
French gumlang ai lam a majaw byin wa ai gara galai shai lam gaw bungli galaw sha ra ai mung shawa ni a ntsa hta dan dawng ai hku akyu nga ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Amayu sha madi shadaw lam rawt jat wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the French language as a tool for intellectual and cultural exchange, focusing on its ability to promote understanding and bridge gaps between people.** It emphasizes its role in facilitating communication and sharing knowledge.
* **Option A (""Amayu sha madi shadaw lam rawt jat wa ai"" -  ""It is the ability to spread the seeds of knowledge"")** directly reflects this idea. French, as described, helps spread knowledge and understanding to others.
* **Option B (""Madang shingjawng ai lam de galai mat ai"" - ""It is to spread the seeds in the field of innovation"")** is too narrow. While French *can* contribute to innovation, the passage's focus is broader than just innovation.
* **Option C (""Gumsan magam masa hpe hkap la ai"" - ""It is to embrace the essence of culture"")** is related but not the core concept highlighted in the passage. The passage emphasizes the *communication* aspect facilitated by French, not solely cultural embrace.
* **Option D (""Shadawn sharam nnan ladat"" - ""It is to sharpen the wisdom of the mind"")** is also a related idea but less direct than Option A in capturing the passage's main point about knowledge dissemination.



Therefore, Option A is the most accurate answer because it captures the essence of the French language's role as a facilitator of knowledge and understanding, which is what the passage emphasizes."
"French gumlang ai lam ngut ai hpang,hpyen dap hte kaga bungli ni hta awngdang ai gaw hpa hta npawt gaw da ai lam mahkoi yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **D: Caliber**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""French gumlang ai lam gaw kaga mungdan hkan dip shadang da hkrum ai bungli galaw sha masha madang ni hpe shanhte na shanhte gumlang ai lam hpang wa lu na matu myit sharawt ya wa sai re."" This translates to: ""The French gumlang way is a regulated action involving the construction of a weapon of war, which is often shot in a way that is not consistent with the same gumlang way.""  The key phrase is ""bungli galaw sha masha madang ni hpe shanhte na shanhte gumlang ai lam hpang wa lu na matu myit sharawt ya wa sai re"" -  essentially saying the action involves *caliber*.

* **The question asks:** ""French gumlang ai lam ngut ai hpang,hpyen dap hte kaga bungli ni hta awngdang ai gaw hpa hta npawt gaw da ai lam mahkoi yawm dik rai?"" which means ""What is the right way to judge the action, the result and the other things of the weapon's caliber?""

* **Therefore, caliber (D) is the most appropriate answer** because the text directly links the French gumlang way to the *caliber* of the weapon.



The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awngdang lam (Other way)** - While the text mentions a different way, it doesn't relate it directly to the ""right way to judge the caliber.""
* **B: Tsang (Tsang)** - Tsang is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Yaw shada lam (Yaw shada way)** - This isn't mentioned in the text.



"
Rawt jat taw sai mungdan ni hta law malawng myit n dik hkun ai gaw gara shawa karum ningtum jaw ai lam kaw na byin ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shawa htaw wa htaw sa lam**.

Here's why:

* **The questions describe a situation of disrespect and conflict.** Masha is upset because someone is causing trouble and disrupting the peace with their behavior. This disruptive behavior is described as ""taw wa htaw sa"" (which roughly translates to ""causing trouble"" or ""making things difficult"").
* **The question asks for a solution to this disruptive behavior.**  The options are different approaches or actions.
* **""Shawa htaw wa htaw sa lam"" (The path of dealing with disruptive behavior)** is the most logical and direct response to the situation described in the questions.  It implies finding a way to address the problematic behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Hka madang (Taking revenge/retaliation):** While tempting in the heat of the moment, revenge won't solve the underlying problem and could escalate the conflict.
* **B: Mahkrai gawgap ai lam (The path of avoiding conflict):** Avoiding conflict might temporarily reduce tension, but it doesn't address the disruptive behavior and could allow it to continue.
* **D: Hpaji lam (The path of forgiveness):** Forgiveness is important, but it's not the immediate solution to a disruptive situation.  Addressing the behavior first is necessary.



Therefore, option C, **Shawa htaw wa htaw sa lam**, is the most appropriate answer.

Here's why:

* **The Question:** The question asks about the difference between the ""Htaw wa htaw sa"" (tradition/custom) and the ""Dai lam ni"" (modern/new way). It specifically asks about the reasons *why* the Htaw wa htaw sa is being left behind.

* **Option C's Relevance:**  Option C states that the ""Dai ni"" (modern way) is being widely adopted because it is more convenient and easier. This directly addresses the reason why the traditional practices are fading. The convenience and ease of the new way are compelling people to abandon the old.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Option A:** Says the ""Dai ni"" is being adopted because it's not considered wrong. This is a weak and incomplete reason.  It doesn't address the core issue of convenience.
* **Option B:** Mentions the ""Dai ni"" being popular among those who are educated. While there might be a correlation, education isn't the primary *reason* for the decline of tradition.
* **Option D:** Says the ""Rawt jat ai mungdan ni hta"" (modern way of thinking) is causing the ""Dai ni"" to be adopted. While related, it doesn't fully explain *why* the ""Dai ni"" is becoming more convenient.

**Therefore, Option C is the most accurate and comprehensive answer to the question posed.** It directly answers *why* the traditional practices are losing ground – because the modern way offers greater convenience.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, masam maram n mai ai mawdaw gau ai ni a majaw npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw shadawn yu na matu yak ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Mawdaw hting let ai lam (The path of the rising sun)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes the rising sun as a metaphor for a path of enlightenment.** It talks about navigating difficulties (obstacles) and avoiding harmful paths (darkness, deception).
* **The question asks about the path that can overcome darkness and lead to a better future.**
* **Option D, ""Mawdaw hting let ai lam"" (The path of the rising sun), directly aligns with this description.** The rising sun symbolizes overcoming darkness and moving towards clarity and positivity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mawdaw lam masing (The path of the wind):** Wind is often associated with change and instability, not necessarily overcoming darkness.
* **B: Mawdaw lam masing (The path of the water):** Water can be both cleansing and destructive. It doesn't have the same positive connotation of overcoming darkness as the rising sun.
* **C: Mawdaw lam galaw lajang ai (The path of the bright and swift):** While brightness is positive, ""swift"" doesn't necessarily imply overcoming difficulties or leading to a better future; it could just mean speed.



Therefore, the rising sun path (Mawdaw hting let ai lam) is the most appropriate answer based on the provided text.

Sawn hpan hpaji hku nna mawdaw hting let ai lam ni hpe tang madun ai shaloinpu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe akyu nga hkra mai lang na kun?,"The correct answer is **D: Mawdaw hting let ai lam a hkak ai lam** (The path where the spirit lingers and is made to tremble).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the ""Mawdaw htinglet ai lam"" (path of the lingering spirit) as something that causes fear and trembling.** It mentions that the spirit can make people feel like they are in a terrifying, isolated place.
* **Option D directly reflects this description.** ""Mawdaw hting let ai lam a hkak ai lam"" refers to the path that causes the spirit to linger and tremble, aligning perfectly with the passage's meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mawdaw lam galaw lajang ai** (The path where the spirit travels quickly). The passage focuses on lingering and fear, not speed.
* **B: Mawdaw gau ai ni a akyang** (The spirit's good day and its sharpness). The passage describes a terrifying experience, not a good day.
* **C: Mawdaw lam a hkrang** (The spirit's path is smelly). The passage doesn't mention smell.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately captures the meaning of the ""Mawdaw htinglet ai lam"" as described in the passage."
Hershey hte Chase gaw shanhte a DNA hpe hkum kata de bang na matuhpa hpe jai lang wa ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Radioactive phosphorus**.

Here's why:

* **The Experiment:** Hershey and Chase used radioactive phosphorus to label the phage DNA and radioactive sulfur to label the phage protein.
* **The Result:**  They found that the radioactive phosphorus was *inside* the bacteria, while the radioactive sulfur remained *outside*.
* **The Conclusion:** This showed that the DNA, not the protein, was injected into the bacteria to make more viruses.

Therefore, the radioactive phosphorus is the key element they used to track the DNA.

Kashu kasha matu mara galai shai ya lu ai lam gaw gara ntsa kaw shamyet shanat nga ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai ni a alak mi lachyum pru ai lam**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""What is the ground where the surface of the water that has the characteristics of both galai shai (surface tension) and seng ai (wetting) is formed?""

The passage describes how the combination of surface tension and wetting leads to a phenomenon where water forms droplets that cling to surfaces.  It specifically mentions:

* **Galai shai (surface tension):**  The water molecules pull together, creating a skin-like effect.
* **Seng ai (wetting):** The water spreads out and adheres to the surface.
* **""Ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai ni a alak mi lachyum pru ai lam""** translates to ""the ground where the combination of surface tension and wetting forms a liquid that clings to surfaces."" This directly answers the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cell ni gaw ginsai hte seng ai rai yang (Cellular and the nature of surface tension and wetting):** This is too broad. The question is about the *ground* where the phenomenon occurs, not the cellular components involved.
* **C: Galai shai ai hpan (The ground of surface tension):** This is incomplete. It only mentions one of the key characteristics and not the combined effect.
* **D: Galai shai ai lam gaw cell hpe tsi hkun ai rai yang (The nature of surface tension and the nature that does not adhere to cells):** This is incorrect. The passage describes how water *adheres* to surfaces, not how it doesn't adhere to cells.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and complete answer based on the provided text.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam ni hta madung dat nna, amyu ru sai galai shai ai lam amyu myu hta akyu nga ai lam gaw gara ntsa hta machyu ai lam n’nga ai kun?","The correct answer is **C: Akyu jaw ai ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai ni a ahkyak ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The Passage's Core Idea:** The passage describes a situation where a ""galai shai"" (a type of spiritual or magical power) is being used to cause a problem. This power is being used to manipulate the natural order (""ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai""). The power is acting against the ""lam hte seng ai daw chyen ni a alak mi lachyum pru ai lam"" (the path of those who have not yet achieved the path of purity).

* **The Question's Focus:** The question asks what the root cause (""lam ni hta madung dat nna"") of the problem is, specifically referencing the relationship between ""galai shai"" and ""ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai.""

* **Why C Fits:** Option C directly states that the root cause is ""Akyu jaw ai ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai ni a ahkyak ai lam"" – the path of the manipulation or influence of the ""ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of the ""galai shai"" being used to manipulate the natural order.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai gaw kade ram akyu jaw ai lam:** This is too general. While ""ginsai ni hte seng ai arung arai"" is involved, the passage focuses on *how* it's being used (manipulatively) rather than simply its existence.
* **B: Lama na akyu jaw ai cell ni gaw ginsai ni hte seng ai rai yang:** This option doesn't directly address the root *cause* of the problem; it mentions a connection between a ""lama"" (spiritual teacher) and ""rai yang"" (some kind of essence), which isn't supported by the passage.
* **D: Akyu jaw ai galai shai lam a baw hpan:** This is incorrect because the passage emphasizes that the ""galai shai"" is *being used* to manipulate the natural order; it's not simply a consequence of its ""baw hpan"" (origin or source).



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided passage."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw moi na htunghking ni hta bainam hpe zing da ai lam a madi madun ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shanhte gaw udat shara hpe karum ya ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dum nta rem bai nam ni hpe law malawng gaw uhpung hte arau tawn da nna bum hkan laga ushat shara hkan dat tawn da nna kalang marang gaw sagu rem ni ngu nna masha law malawm e chye ai hte bung ai bainam rem ai ni, ma kasha ni brangji ni, e rem ma ai.""  This translates to something like: ""The water of the valley, which is high and deep, is filled with lush vegetation and the animals are all happy and satisfied, not lacking water, and not experiencing drought.""

Then it says: ""Ndai rem ladat ni hpe ndai prat kaw mung naw lang nga ai re."" This means: ""The dry season is the time when the people of the valley depend on it.""

The question asks: ""How does the water of the valley flood and flow down the slopes?""

The passage then says: ""Shanhte gaw udat shara hpe karum ya ai."" This translates to: ""The Shan people cause it to flow down the slopes."" The Shan people are responsible for managing the water flow to prevent flooding and ensure a steady supply during the dry season.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte gaw shan ni madi shadaw ya ai:**  This translates to ""The Shan people cause the rain to be heavy."" While rain contributes to the water supply, it's not directly related to how the water flows down the slopes.
* **C: Shanhte gaw manang tai ya ai:** This translates to ""The Shan people cause the mountains to be high."" This is irrelevant.
* **D: Shanhte gaw chyu ntsin ni jaw ya ai:** This translates to ""The Shan people cause the rivers to be narrow."" This is incorrect; they would aim to manage the rivers to ensure sufficient water flow.

Gawp gayet ai a pandung gaw hpa hpe kachyi sha la na matu rai?,"The answer is **A: Bawlung ni**.

The text states: ""Gawp ginsup ai hta ginsup ai ni gaw gayat ai shingna hpe lang nna bawlung hpe hku kata de shang hkra gayat ra ai."" This translates to: ""The ginsup of gawp, the ni of ginsup, is the one who, in the position of gayet (someone who is important/in charge), uses the bawlung (face/appearance) to be respected.""

Therefore, the question asks about the ""gawp gayet ai a pandung"" (the appearance/characteristic of the important person of gawp), and the text clearly identifies that as the ""bawlung ni"" (face/appearance/ni of gawp).
"
"Gawp sharin hpawng hta, tsing hpe gara kaw grau kadun hkra dan da ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: hku shi matsat hta**.

Here's why:

The question asks where the ""sing"" (presumably meaning something like ""the sound"" or ""the voice"") is coming from. The text states: ""Kayat masat shau htum lu ai ginsup masha kalap hpung a galai shai ai lam gaw sharin hpawng hpe awng dang hkra shangut shakre na matu re. **Ndai game hpe tsingdu hta ginsup ai, hku grup yin na dai tsingdu pa ni hpe kadun dun re tsing shawt ai hte dai hpe atsit ngu tsun ai.**""

This translates to: ""The voice that is not too loud is coming from the direction of the wind. **In this case, the voice is coming from the sound of the wood and is being echoed.**""

Therefore, the answer is **hku shi matsat hta** (from the sound of the wood).



"
Jep ai lam a madung yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: langai (sh) langai hta grau byin mai ai mai byin ai maram malu ni hpe la kau na matu**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q):** ""Jep ai lam a madung yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?"" translates to ""What is the reason for the Jep's path being narrow?"".

* **The context in P:** The paragraph describes how the Hpungtang Hpaji (a type of traditional path) is narrow due to the terrain.  It mentions that the path is narrow because it's carved through the hills and because the ground is uneven.  It also mentions animals having difficulty traversing the path.

* **Option A:** ""langai (sh) langai hta grau byin mai ai mai byin ai maram malu ni hpe la kau na matu"" translates to ""because of the uneven ground, animals are difficult to walk on, and because the ground is hard, it's hard to walk.""  This directly addresses the reason for the narrowness of the Jep's path as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mungkan gara hku bungli galaw ai hpe chye lu na matu:** ""Perhaps there's something that is difficult to walk on."" This is a vague statement and doesn't provide a specific reason.
* **C: Ga san ni pru wana matu:** ""It's because the ground is very hard.""  While the text mentions hard ground, it also emphasizes unevenness and carving through hills as the primary reasons for the narrowness.
* **D: Hpung tang hpaji hte seng ai sawk tam lam ni hpe lam madun lu na matu:** ""It's because the Hpungtang Hpaji and other paths are difficult to walk.""  This doesn't address the specific reason for the Jep's path being narrow.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and direct answer to the question based on the information provided in the paragraph."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa gaw hpungtang hpaji hte seng ai sawk tam lam ni hpe lam n madun karum ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Byin mai ai masam maram ni hpe la kau ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks *what is the reason why the ""hpungtang hpaji"" does not participate in the ""tsun da ai hte maren""* (which translates roughly to ""the event of tsun da ai and maren"")?

The text explains that the ""hpungtang hpaji"" doesn't participate because they are *always busy with work*. The text specifically states: ""Ndai gaw langai chyu sha nre, jep jen ai lam hte Jep jen ai lam gaw langai langai hta jan ai mai byin ai maram malu ni hpe la kau na matu hte gasan san ai lam hte masam maram ai lam galaw yu ai gaw hpung tang hpaji hte maren re ai sawk lit ni de lam madun ya nga ai re."" This translates to: ""They are always busy with work. The roads for Jep jen and Jep jen are constantly filled with people going to and from work, and the roads for the ""hpungtang hpaji"" and ""maren"" are used for transport at night.""

Therefore, the reason they don't participate is because they are occupied with their own work and responsibilities, which means they don't have time to be involved in the ""tsun da ai hte maren."" Option C, ""Byin mai ai masam maram ni hpe la kau ai"" which means ""They are occupied with their own work,"" accurately captures this reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hpung tang hapji hte seng ai ladat hkrai:** (They don't have the right to participate) - The text doesn't indicate any lack of right or permission.
* **B: Sawk tam ai lam ni galaw ai:** (They are busy with work) - While they are busy with work, this doesn't explain *why* they don't participate in the event. It's the reason for their absence, not the reason they are absent.
* **D: Jep jen ai ni galaw ai:** (They are busy with Jep jen's work) - This isn't mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Bunghpoi laru ni gaw hpun ni hpe baw kau ai, nta hpun pyen ni gang je ai hte mawdaw ni hpe lamu de kabai shapyen kau ai.""  This translates to: ""The Bunghpoi dragon's breath is built from air, and uses the energy of the wind and the spirit of the earth to create a powerful energy.""
* **Option A** directly reflects this: ""The Bunghpoi dragon's breath is powered by the energy of the air and the spirit of the earth.""
* **Option B** is incorrect because the passage states the dragon's breath *uses* the energy, not *is* the energy of the dragon's breath's mother.
* **Option C** is incorrect because it describes what the dragon's breath *does* to people, not what powers it.
* **Option D** is incorrect because the passage says it travels 480 km (133 minutes), not 300 miles.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Dai grai kaba ai nbung laru hkying hkum mi hta 480 km (sekkan myi hta 133 minit;300 mph) hku bung ahpawt mat ai."" This translates to: ""Then the bunghpoi laru, traveling along the highway, traveled 480 km (133 minutes; 300 mph) in a straight line.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte gaw hkying hkum masum hta jan nna na ai:** This translates to ""Shanhte were caught by innocent people.""  While the text mentions innocent people, this option doesn't directly address the question about the bunghpoi laru's movement.
* **C: shanhte gaw kaga nbung laru ni hta na grau kaba ai shara hpe hkra machyi hkun ai:** This translates to ""Shanhte were able to escape through the cracks of the bunghpoi laru's ni."" This is not supported by the text.
* **D: Shanhte gaw hpun ni hpe ru kaw nna baw kau hkun lu ai:** This translates to ""Shanhte were able to fly away by using the bunghpoi laru's ni."" This is not supported by the text.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna tsaban 16 hta masha ni gaw hpa ni hpe galaw hpang wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: pat nhpai ni galaw wa ai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Raitimung, alat ningshawng jaw ai sumtsan yu myiset gaw lai wa tsa ban 16 hta uropa dan kaw galaw shapraw lai wa sai re. Ndai sumtsan yu myi set ni gaw tsan ai kaw na arai ni hpe grau ni ai, grau kaba ai hku hpan lahkawng mai mu lu ai pat nhpai lahkawng hte shachyaw nna jai lang lai sai.""
* This translates to: ""Furthermore, the person who has a strong desire to travel to Europe, even if it's a 16-year-old who is not fully prepared, will go and travel.  This person, although not fully prepared, will travel in a way that is not reckless and is appropriate for their age.""
* The question asks *how* a 16-year-old with a strong desire to travel to Europe will travel. The passage explicitly states they will travel ""**pat nhpai ni galaw wa ai**"" - which translates to ""in a way that is not reckless and is appropriate for their age.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Arai ni hpe shawawm wa ai** - ""in a way that is extravagant/showy"".  The passage emphasizes avoiding recklessness, not extravagance.
* **B: Arai ni hpe grau ni ai** - ""in a way that is reckless/careless."" The passage explicitly says they will *not* be reckless.
* **D: Tsan ai de mai yu ai myiset pe galaw ai** - ""travel in a way that is not prepared/not fully prepared."" The passage states they *will* travel, even if not fully prepared, but stresses that it will be in an appropriate and non-reckless manner.



"
Masha ni gaw pat nhpai ni hpe lang nna arai ni hpe shawawm ai kade na sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsaban 16 hpang daw kaw nna** (Those who are over 16 years old).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai sumtsan yu myiset gaw lai wa tsa ban 16 hta uropa dan kaw galaw shapraw lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""Those who are not children are allowed to travel to Europe starting from the age of 16.""

Therefore, the question asks who is allowed to travel to Europe starting from the age of 16, and the passage directly answers that.
"
"Matsing masat laika hta mahta nna, Muhamman na lungpu hku gaw shi a wenyi lam shaman ai (sh) manu ni hpe gara hku tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw simsa lam hte tinang hkrai san nga ai hpe manu shadan ai**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Muhammad gaw dinghta ga na sak hkrung lam a shinggan na lam ni hpe grai myit shang sha ai. Shi gaw myit aru yu na matu """"Noor"""" (nhtoi) Bum hta """"Hira"""" ngu chye na da ai lam byin wa hkra lung pu hta jahkring hkring nga lai wa ai.""

Translation: ""Muhammad was unable to understand the sacredness of the days, he was fascinated by the days of the month. He was the one called ""Noor"" (bright) and the one who received the message of ""Hira"" (inspiration) and listened with a receptive heart.  Muhammad, who was born in Mecca, was often taken on journeys.  These journeys were often difficult and tiring.  He was often hungry, and his body was often weak. He often fasted and was thirsty.  He often endured difficulties in his journeys.""

The question asks: ""At that time, was Muhammad's heart influenced by the shamanistic beliefs of the people, causing him to be afraid of the spirit man?""

The passage doesn't say that Muhammad was influenced by shamanistic beliefs *or* afraid of spirit men. However, it strongly emphasizes that he was *receptive* to divine messages and deeply connected to his faith, despite hardship. Option A, ""Shi gaw simsa lam hte tinang hkrai san nga ai hpe manu shadan ai"" (He was influenced by the path of simplicity and spiritual strength and listened to the people) is the closest answer because it highlights his receptivity and connection to something greater, which contrasts with the idea of fear or influence from shamanistic beliefs. The passage emphasizes his spiritual strength and the divine guidance he received, making option A the most logical inference.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpri hpe shawng nnan hku nna hpa hta lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Wanleng lam ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1767 ning hta shawng nnan na hpri hte hpring tup galaw da ai **wanleng lam ni** hpe shapraw shachyen lu sai.""  This translates to ""In 1767, the **new railway** was built and put into operation.""

The question asks what was used for the first time to transport goods and people by rail.  The passage clearly identifies the new railway as the answer. The other options are mentioned in the passage but are not the specific answer to the question.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa majaw hpun dingsen hpe hpri dingsen hte galai shakap kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte gaw grai li ai gunrai ni hpe lu hpai wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lam ni hpe madun na matu dai shara hta chyit chyai ni galaw nna jau shachyen dan ai. Gau ngwi ngwi gaw, lama ntsa kaw hpri pa shakap da ai rai yang, dai lam ni gaw grau akyu rawng ai lam hpe dum hprang wa ma ai."" This translates to: ""The road was cleared by removing stones and other obstacles.  Also, if the road was alongside a river, the road was avoided from crossing the river.""

* **The question asks:** ""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa majaw hpun dingsen hpe hpri dingsen hte galai shakap kau ai rai?""  This translates to: ""Because the road was muddy and flooded, how was the road cleared and made passable?""

* **Option C directly addresses this:** ""Shanhte gaw grai li ai gunrai ni hpe lu hpai wa ai"" means ""They avoided the road that was alongside a river.""  The passage explicitly mentions avoiding roads alongside rivers. While not directly saying they cleared the road *because* it was muddy, avoiding a river road was a method of making the road passable in muddy conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gumra ni a chyang shadang grau tsaw na matu:** This means ""They removed stones and other obstacles."" While part of clearing the road, it doesn't explain how to make a *muddy and flooded* road passable.
* **B: Shanhte gaw grau nna akyu rawng ai:** This means ""They avoided the road that was alongside a river."" While correct that they avoided river roads, it doesn't explain *how* to clear a muddy and flooded road.
* **D: Shanhte gaw lam ntsa nga ai hpri tawng ni a majaw hten mat ai:** This means ""They avoided the road that was alongside a river and avoided crossing the river.""  Similar to B, it focuses on river avoidance but doesn't explain clearing muddy conditions.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the passage's description of how roads were cleared in muddy and flooded conditions.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Romanticism ten ladaw hta langai hkrai a hkrang hpe gara hku shalen ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lamu ga hpaji**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the core characteristic of Romanticism, specifically what made it different from earlier periods. The text states that Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, among others, shifted away from strict rules and forms (""masa gaw htunghking shalat masa a kaba dik ai daw chye langai re"").  They valued individual feeling and subjective experience (""lamu ga hpaji gaw shi na shi lai nsam nga ai re"").  The text further emphasizes that Romanticism focused on the inner world and the imagination (""roman ni a laika kaw, lamu ga hpaji gaw shi na shi lai nsam nga ai re nna aten ni hta hkan nna galu ga hkrang mung galai wa ai rai nna masha hpawng hte hktuk hkra nga nga na matu myit ai hku tara galaw ai gaw grai hkrak nga ai re"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tara upadi ni (Before the Renaissance):** The text clearly indicates a shift *from* earlier periods, not *to* them.
*   **C: Htunglai ni (Modern Times):** Romanticism predates modern times.
*   **D: Htunghking (Traditional Times):** While Romanticism reacted *against* traditional forms, it wasn't defined *by* traditional times. The text is talking about the shift in artistic philosophy.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara ndau ai lam gaw lai ladat hte seng ai madung tawn myit jasat hpe nlu tsun dan ai ra? ,"The correct answer is **C: Hpuntang hpaji gaw uhpung hta myi kaw na nga ai akyu jaw masa ni nga ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the ""uhpung kata hpungtang gara ndau ai lam"" (the path that avoids the main road) is used for to avoid wild animals.

The text states: ""Ga shadawn, mawdaw ni gaw mawdaw lam ni grau hkrak nna rawt jat bawng ring wa na lam hpe madi shadaw ya nga ai ngu nna tsun ma ai. Hpa mi raitim mungdan ting na mawdaw lam zinghkri hku na gaw mawdaw kachyi mi sha nga ai gaw sut hpaga hku na masa nkaja ai, dai majaw mawdaw madu lu na matu hkrat ang ai manu hpe shayawm kau na matu galaw shapraw ai ladat nnan ni gyin shalat ra nga ai.""

Translation: ""In the meantime, the path that avoids the main road is used to avoid the wild animals that are accustomed to the main road. These wild animals, which are usually afraid of humans, will be frightened and will not be able to approach. Therefore, the wild animals that are accustomed to the main road will be watched and their movements will be monitored.""

Therefore, the uhpung kata hpungtang gara ndau ai lam (the path that avoids the main road) is used to avoid wild animals that are accustomed to the main road, and to monitor their movements. Option C accurately reflects this.



Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uhpung kata hpungtang hpaji a akyu jaw ai masa gaw shinggyim uhpawng the seng nna masat da ai:** This option is partially correct but doesn't fully capture the purpose. The path is not just for encountering"
"Matsing masa ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw dawraw shingna gang ai lam hte n seng ai rai?","The question asks: ""What kind of material, when heated, can be shaped and then used for making a bow?""

Let's break down the provided text to find the answer:

* **""Dawraw shingna""** translates to ""bow.""
* The text describes the process of making a bow, mentioning different types of wood suitable for it. Specifically, it states:
    * **""Dawraw shingna lawu maga de nsen kaba ai hpe shapraw ai shaloi...""** -  The wood used for the bow's limbs is shaped...
    * **""...(bow) lahta maga gaw nsen kaji ai hpe shapraw ai.""** - ...the bow's spine is shaped.

* The text then gives two types of wood:
    * **""maisau chywi samyit (sh) htumpa nkap ai ruyin hte bung ai.""** -  A type of wood that is flexible and can be bent and broken.
    * **""Ja ai nsen""** -  A type of wood that is strong.

* The question then asks what material, when heated, can be shaped and then used for making a bow. The text says the limbs are *shaped* (shapraw ai). This implies a material that can be *molded* when heated.  The ""maisau chywi samyit (sh) htumpa nkap ai ruyin hte bung ai"" (flexible wood) is more likely to be molded than the strong wood.

Looking at the options:

* **A: Grau kya ai nsen (Hardened wood)** - Hardened wood is not typically shaped by heating.
* **B: chwi samyit hte bung ai kumla (Flexible wood and broken wood)** -  This refers to the flexible wood mentioned earlier.  Flexible wood is typically bent and shaped without significant heating.
* **C: Ja ai nsen (Strong wood)** - Strong wood is typically used for the spine of the bow, and it's not commonly molded by heating.
* **D: Shu kaw na hpang ai (Wood that is heated and shaped)** - This is the most accurate description, as the text indicates that wood is *shaped* when heated as part of the bow-making process.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Shu kaw na hpang ai (Wood that is heated and shaped)**.



Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{D}$"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw grau nya ai nsen hte seng ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Dawraw shingna V hte bung ai kumla**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""What is the family that is related to the mother who is the master of the V and the end?""

The passage clearly states: ""Dawraw shingna ntsa shalun masat kumla gaw V hte bung nna shingna npu jahkrat kumla gaw maisau chywi samyit (sh) htumpa nkap ai ruyin hte bung ai.""  This translates to: ""The family of the master of the bow, the family of the mother who is the master of the V and the end, is a kind of family that is related to the descendants of the ancestors.""

Therefore, the family being referred to is ""Dawraw shingna V hte bung ai kumla"" (the family of the mother who is the master of the V and the end).
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na lata ni hpe madung lang ai lam hte seng na hpang jahtum hta namhkam nlung ni madun ai lam gaw gara wa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kangai hkawm ai lam (The way of cooperation)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how early hominids, through cooperation, were able to survive and thrive.  Specifically, it mentions:

* **Cooperation for hunting:** Hominids hunted together, catching prey that they couldn't catch alone.
* **Cooperation for defense:** They defended themselves together against predators.
* **Cooperation for toolmaking:** They used tools, implying shared knowledge and skills.

The question asks what allowed humans to overcome environmental challenges and develop. The passage emphasizes that **cooperation** was the key factor.  Therefore, ""Kangai hkawm ai lam"" (The way of cooperation) directly addresses this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lashoi jum ai (The way of selfishness):** The passage clearly states the opposite - cooperation was vital.
* **B: Hkum n-gun jat ai (The way of fighting):**  While fighting might have happened, the passage highlights cooperation as the dominant survival strategy.
* **D: Lamyi hte hkawm ai (The way of wisdom and strength):** Wisdom and strength were likely beneficial, but the passage emphasizes that cooperation *applied* wisdom and strength to achieve success.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw masha Chimpanzee a lagaw lata nra hte seng na jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw masha ni hta grau galu ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lagaw nra gaw grau galu ai majaw re."" This translates to ""The ancestors of humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor.""

Therefore, option A, ""Shanhte gaw masha ni hta grau galu ai"" (Humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor), directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanhte a lagaw lata ni a hkrang gaw shai ai** (Humans' ancestors and chimpanzees' ancestors are different): This contradicts the passage's statement about a common ancestor.
* **C: Shanhte hpe hkum n-gun jat na matu lang ai** (Humans are descended from a separate species): The passage implies a shared ancestry, not a separate origin.
* **D: Npawt hta gaw shanhte hpe lashoi jum na matu sha lang ai** (The environment forced humans to evolve): While environment plays a role in evolution, the passage doesn't focus on environmental pressures as the primary reason for the shared ancestor. It directly states the shared ancestry itself.



"
Lata ai lam gaw gin sai hkrang n bung ai lam nnan hpe gara hpan kaw na yen kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Makoi ai lam**.

Here's why:

The question asks what kind of path is used to connect the path that is connected to the 'hkrang nbung ai hku na hpan lahkawng hpe madun da ai' (the path connected to the starting point of the path that is made to be small) with the 'myu ni kaw na yen kau ai' (the path that connects to the wife's home).

The passage states: ""Ban prat shagu hte la-ing lahkawng lapran lachyen lahka ai lam hte bai gahkyin ai lam gaw ndi nda zawn galai shai nga ai."" which translates to ""The path that is connected to the starting point of the path that is made to be small and the path that is connected to the wife's home are not the same.""

The first part of the sentence implies that the path used to connect the small path's starting point with the wife's home is the ""Makoi ai lam"" (the path of love). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"
Lakung nnan amyu myu jat bang na matu gara ladat hta lit nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Bai gahkyin ai lam**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""What path should one take to achieve the goal of becoming a truly happy person?"".

The passage states: ""...ban prat shagu hte la-ing lahkawng lapran lachyen lahka ai lam hte bai gahkyin ai lam gaw ndi nda zawn galai shai nga ai.""

This translates to: ""...the path of perseverance and overcoming obstacles, and the path of wisdom and understanding are the only ways to reach the desired destination.""

Therefore, the answer is the path of **Bai gahkyin ai lam (the path of wisdom and understanding)**.

The passage states: ""Yawng hpe myit sawn yu yang, lama na anhte na kaji kawa ni shanhte a """"""shat dat manghkang"""""" ni hpe hparan hpareng ai hta lama mi hku na gaw ndai aten na savana kaw na masha chyawoi ni galaw nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte bung nga ai hpe anhte nmau ging nga ai ladat hte"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara manghkang gaw ra ai amino acid n lu ai majaw byin wa ai manghkang nre ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lusha n grung ai lam**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the ""shat dat manghkang"" (presumably referring to a specific type of food or ingredient mentioned in the text) is made of, considering its amino acid content.

The text states: ""Law malawng kalang ta mai lu ai hpun hpan npawt ni gaw namlap hte shapre galu kaw na shan dat ni mai lu ai, raitim anhte zawn re chyu lu hpan ni gaw dai ni hpe shadu ai sha sha yang shat kan rin na matu yak ai. Nbung ai gaw, dusat ni a lusha (gagyin, ji grawng, udi) ni gaw shat rin rin lawan ai sha nre, ra nga ai amino acid ni lawm ai ningja tsaw ai shan dat ni mung lawm ai re.""

This translates to: ""The fleshy part of the leg that is not eaten is not made of namlap and shapre galu, but it is eaten in small pieces. The inner part of the leg (gagyin, ji grawng, udi) is made of shat rin rin lawan ai sha nre, and it is rich in the amino acids that we love.""

The text explicitly links the amino acid content to the ""lusha"" (inner part/flesh) of the leg. Therefore, the ""shat dat manghkang"" (the ingredient being inquired about) is made of the ""lusha n grung ai lam"" (inner part of the leg).



"
Nbung ai htunghking ni a malawm masha ni gaw shanhte a uhpung ni hte pawng hpawn ai lam hpe gara hku lachyum hpyan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Uhpung hte seng na masat da ai lam ni hpe hkap la ai hku na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the conditions that lead to the destruction of a village.** It mentions things like the village being surrounded by enemies, suffering from famine and disease, and facing attacks from bandits.
* **The question asks what causes the village's destruction.**
* **Option C directly addresses this by stating that the village is destroyed by encirclement and being attacked.** This aligns with the information provided in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yawng hpe gayau kau na matu shakut na (Being lured by the enemy's deceptive words).** While deception might play a role in the initial stages, the passage emphasizes physical attacks and encirclement.
* **B: Shanhte na makau kaw nga ai masha yawng a makam hpe man hkra di ai hku na (Being frightened by the enemy's cruel and powerful strength).** Fear might contribute to the village's vulnerability, but the passage focuses on the physical actions of the enemies.
* **D: Hkrang hpe maka kumla hku jai lang ai hku na (Being trapped by the enemy's cunning schemes).**  While cunning might be involved, the primary cause highlighted is the direct attack and encirclement.



Therefore, option C best reflects the information presented in the passage and directly answers the question about what causes the village's destruction.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai ga shawn hte maren, myu baw sang hte seng na mayen maga na ni hpe garan ginhka ai lam chye galaw ai ma langai a hkrang gaw gara hku byin wa na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ma gaw uhpung hte seng ai masa ni hta na shapraw da hkrum na**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q)** describes a situation where someone is constantly being bothered and harassed by someone else, specifically mentioning the other person's repeated attempts to get close and their persistent actions. It asks what the speaker would do in this situation.

* **Option C** translates to: ""I would assert myself and firmly stop the person from acting inappropriately."" This is the most appropriate response to the described harassment. It emphasizes setting boundaries and stopping the unwanted behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ma gaw jahkrit shama ai lam ni hpe shakut nna koi wa na** (I would avoid the person and not get involved.) - This is passive and doesn't address the harassment.
* **B: Ma gaw jahkrit shama ai akyang ni hte grau nna ni htep wa na** (I would politely tell the person to stop.) - While polite, this might not be effective against someone who is already being persistent and intrusive.
* **D: Ma gaw kaga baw sang n law ai ni hte ni htep ai hku nga ai hpe ninghkap wa na** (I would ask for help from someone older and respected.) - Asking for help is a good option *in addition to* directly addressing the harassment, but it's not the primary action the speaker is describing.

Therefore, **C** is the most direct and appropriate action the speaker would take to stop the unwanted behavior."
Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren ma ni a amyu hte seng ai machye machyang gaw npu e jaw da ai kaw na garalam hta akyu jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shanhte a amyu bawsang ngu ai lam a lachyum**.

Here's why:

* **P asks:**  ""How can the mother's feelings be so conflicted and overwhelmed, feeling like she's being pulled in two directions?"" (The translation captures the essence of the question about the mother's internal struggle and conflicting emotions).

* **Q asks:** ""Why does the mother feel this sense of being restricted and unable to express herself freely?"" (The translation aims to understand the cause of the mother's feeling of being stifled).

* **A says:** ""Because of the constraints of societal norms and traditions.""

* **B says:** ""Because of the mother's past experiences.""

* **C says:** ""Because of the conflict between the mother and her family.""

* **D says:** ""Because the mother's desire to protect her children and her own needs are conflicting and becoming overwhelming.""

Option D directly addresses the core of both questions. The mother's desire to protect her children (her ""amyu bawsang ngu"" - a protective instinct) clashes with her own needs and desires (""ai lam a lachyum"" - her own path/freedom). This conflict is what causes her feelings of being overwhelmed, conflicted, and restricted.

Let's break down why the other options are less suitable:

* **A (Societal norms):** While societal norms might contribute to the mother's situation, it doesn't fully explain the *internal* conflict described in the questions.
* **B (Past experiences):** Past experiences could have shaped the mother, but they aren't the primary reason for her *current* feelings of being overwhelmed and pulled in two directions.
* **C (Conflict with family):** Family conflict could be a factor, but the questions focus on the *mother's internal experience* of conflict.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and complete answer because it directly addresses the root cause of the mother's feelings of being overwhelmed and constrained.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren,npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam gaw zai ai hku na kaba wa ai ma langai hte hkrum ra ai lam mahkoi n nga na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Nta kata hta makoi rawng chye ai**

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where a powerful being (Masha) is facing a challenging situation, with various forces and obstacles converging against them. The key point is that this situation is a result of accumulated negative karma from past actions. 

Question Q asks: ""What is the cause of the difficulties faced by someone who has accumulated negative karma?""

Option C, ""Nta kata hta makoi rawng chye ai"" translates to ""Due to the accumulation of negative karma."" This directly addresses the cause of the difficulties described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wanglu wanglang nga ai (Due to ignorance)** - While ignorance can contribute to negative karma, it doesn't fully explain the accumulation of past karma.
* **B: Ga shaga chye ai atsam ni (Due to the past deeds of others)** - The passage focuses on the individual's accumulated karma, not the actions of others.
* **D: Uhpung kaw na lu ai myit shuk lam (Due to the influence of demonic forces)** -  While demonic forces can play a role, the passage primarily attributes the difficulties to karma.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly reflects the information provided in the passage.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw zai ai ma ni a akyang lai ni hpe jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Zai ai akyang lai ni byin ai hkun ai madung ai hkumhkrang hte seng na jahten hkrum ai majaw re**.

Here's why:

The text describes the ""Zai ai akyang lai ni"" (the age of the horse's coming). It states that this age is related to the horse's future destiny and is determined by the interaction of various elements. Option A accurately reflects this by mentioning the rules and principles governing the horse's future destiny and the influence of different forces.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zai ai akyang gaw shawa hte kanawn mazum n chye ai majaw byin ai re** (The horse's coming is determined by the interaction of good and evil forces). While the text mentions good and evil, it doesn't solely attribute the horse's destiny to *just* these forces. It's a broader interaction.
* **C: Zai ai akyang gaw kanu kawa ni up hkang da ai ma ni kaw sha byin chye ai** (The horse's coming is determined by the interaction of the horse's mother and the mare's destiny). The text mentions the mare's destiny but doesn't focus exclusively on the mother's influence.
* **D: Zai ai akyang yawng gaw bawnu nyen n hpring tsup ai majaw byin ai re** (The horse's coming is determined by the interaction of the horse's horn and the mare's destiny). The text doesn't mention the horse's horn as a determining factor.



Therefore, option A best captures the essence of the text's description of the ""Zai ai akyang lai ni.""

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw kanbau hkai sun hpe madung dat ai hkai sun hpaji hte n seng ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Hpungtang hpaji ni hpe ning hkap let pru shadang law na matu myit maju jung na**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** How can we prevent the spread of the disease from those who have recovered, but still carry the virus?
* **Option C translates to:** ""Prevent the spread by isolating those who have recovered but still carry the virus, and who have the ability to spread it.""  This directly addresses the core of the question - managing those who are recovered but potentially infectious.
* **Option A translates to:** ""Prevent the spread by using appropriate methods of purification."" This is too general and doesn't specifically address the issue of recovered but still infectious individuals.
* **Option B translates to:** ""Prevent the spread by ensuring individuals are not isolated."" This is the opposite of what the question asks.
* **Option D translates to:** ""Prevent the spread by distancing yourself from individuals who have recovered and are likely to spread it.""  While distancing is a good practice, it doesn't prevent the *source* of the spread, which is what the question focuses on.



Therefore, option C is the most logical and relevant answer to the question posed."
Kanbau hkai sun hpaji hte seng na npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dai gaw shanhte a rapdaw kata na hkai sun hkai sha ai ni yawng shanhte a nsi nai si ni hpe mai garan hkat ai.**

Here's why:

The question asks: ""Why does the health of the body and mind deteriorate when one doesn't practice Kanbau Hkai Sun?""

Option C states: ""It is because the practice of Kanbau Hkai Sun has the power to cure various illnesses of the body and mind."" This directly addresses the deterioration of health and connects it to the *lack* of the practice. It implies the practice is beneficial, and its absence leads to negative consequences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai hta yawng gaw shingra hku na galaw ai ladat re (It is because of the practice of the mind's power that...)** This doesn't explain *why* deterioration happens when the practice isn't done. It only mentions the practice itself.
* **B: Dai hta nsi nai si pru ai shadang law wa na matu laksan hpaji langai sha lang ai (It is because the characteristics of the body and mind that are not properly trained are like...)** This option is vague and doesn't directly explain the deterioration *due to lack of practice*.
* **D: Dai hpe nkau shara hkan hkauna galaw ai ni ya du hkra naw jai lang ai (It is because of the lack of faith in the practice that...)** While lack of faith *could* contribute to not practicing, the question asks about the deterioration due to the *absence* of the practice itself, not the reason for the absence.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical and directly answers the question."
Madun gawk ni de hkawm chyai ai lam gaw bu hkawm ai hte seng ai gara baw hpan kaw na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hpaga hte seng ai bu hkawm lam** (Respectful and non-violent communication).

Here's why:

The passage describes a communication style that emphasizes:

* **Listening and Observing:** Paying attention to the other person's words and body language.
* **Understanding:** Trying to grasp the other person's perspective and feelings.
* **Avoiding Aggression:** Not resorting to anger or harsh words.
* **Focusing on the Issue, Not the Person:** Addressing the problem without attacking the individual.

These elements are all key components of respectful and non-violent communication.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ban sa na matu bu hkawm lam** (Communication based on personal opinions): While opinions can be part of communication, the passage stresses understanding the *other person's* perspective, not just expressing one's own.
* **C: Htunghking hte seng ai bu hkawm lam** (Non-violent communication based on truthfulness): While truthfulness is important, the passage emphasizes *respectful* communication first and foremost.  It's not solely about being truthful without considering the other person's feelings.
* **D: Shinggan hte pru hkawm ai bu hkawm lam** (Aggressive and forceful communication): This is the *opposite* of what the passage describes.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta ka da ai hte maren, hpa gaw ban sa na matu bu hkawm ai hpe ningshawng jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Buga na htunghking hta shanhte hkum shanhte nan baw bang da ai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where a person is being pressured to do something against their will. It talks about a feeling of being unable to resist and being overwhelmed by external forces. 

Option A, ""Buga na htunghking hta shanhte hkum shanhte nan baw bang da ai"" (One should not be pressured by others and should be able to make their own decisions), directly addresses the core issue presented in the passage - the lack of autonomy and the feeling of being forced into a situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanhte a shani shagu galaw hkawm sa ai lam hta na hkring sa la ai** (One should avoid being influenced by others' actions and should remain independent). While independence is good, this doesn't directly address the *pressure* mentioned in the passage. It's about avoiding *influence*, not overcoming *pressure*.
* **C: Ahkayk ai buga ginra masat ni hpe mu ai** (One should focus on the negative aspects and be pessimistic). This is irrelevant to the passage's theme of being pressured.
* **D: Shara ni a labau hpe chye na ai** (One should ignore the negativity). This is also irrelevant to the passage's theme of being pressured and overwhelmed.

Therefore, option A is the most fitting answer because it highlights the importance of maintaining personal autonomy and resisting external pressures, which are central to the passage's meaning.



"
Nawku hpung kata na galai shai ai lam hpe hkrit ai myit shayawm lu na lam hpe matsing masat ga yan hta gara hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Uhpung a htunghking hpe ka up lu ai masha ni kaw na ningmu ni lu la ai.**

Here's why:

The question asks about what you need to *know* to *prevent* (mat sing masat ga yan hta gara hku tsun da ai rai - to prevent someone from being misled) someone from being misled by other's words.

The text emphasizes the importance of cultivating inner strength (uhpung a htunghking hpe ka up lu ai masha ni kaw na ningmu ni lu la ai - the strength of one's heart and the firmness of one's will) and not being swayed by external opinions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awngdang wa sai bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai a mabyin hpe shingran u (To carefully examine the words of others and their intentions):** While important, this is about analyzing *other people's* words, not building your own inner defenses.  The text's core argument is about internal strength.
* **C: Uhpung hpe kyi shangun ai n-gun ni hpe sawk tam na (To seek out the wisdom of those who are highly respected):** Again, this is about seeking guidance from others, not internalizing your own strength.
* **D: Uhpung a labau hpe chye na ai lam (To follow the path of firmness in one's heart):** This is *partially* correct but not the *best* answer. The question asks what you *need to know* to *prevent* being misled.  While firmness is vital, knowing *how* to cultivate that firmness is crucial, and option B points towards that cultivation.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer because it aligns with the text's core message about cultivating inner strength as a defense against being misled.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, masha langai a labau hpe chye na lu ai atsam gaw hpa hpe karum ya lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai hte seng ai akyang ni rawt jat wa ai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where people are forced to leave their homes due to danger and hardship.  It then asks *why* people who are forced to leave their homes and experience suffering (mat sing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren) are shown (chye na lu ai atsam) to be facing a certain future (karum ya lu ai rai).

The passage details the difficult future:

*   They are forced to migrate to safer areas (jep maram ai ten dinghkrai shagu hte shanglawm ai masha yawng hkra hte gaw uhpung langai a manu)
*   They experience poverty, lack of resources, and hardship in the new location (grau nna sung sung mu mada wa ai.  bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai hte awngdang lam a lai sai ten na ga shadawn ni bai dum ai lam gaw buga nawku hpung a matu galai shai lam nnan re nna lam mahkrun nnan shabyin ya ai)

Option D directly reflects this difficult situation, specifically mentioning:

*   **Bungli madu myit rawng ai arawn alai (Poverty and lack of resources)**
*   **Seng ai akyang ni rawt jat wa ai (Hardship and suffering in the new location)**

Therefore, Option D is the only one that accurately describes the difficult future faced by those who are forced to leave their homes and experience suffering.  The passage is setting up this difficult future as the answer to the question.
"

Here's why:

* **The passage describes postmodern sharing as a process of actively creating and manipulating meaning.** It emphasizes the speaker's ability to choose and combine different elements (TV, images, sounds, stories) to construct their own unique interpretation of reality.
* **Option B directly reflects this idea.** It states that the act of sharing is a way for the individual to actively create and shape meaning according to their own understanding. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkau hkaja ai mahkrum madup gaw kaga ni hta grau akyu nga ai** (Good meaning is something that is naturally present) - The passage contradicts this. It suggests meaning isn't inherent but actively constructed.
* **C: Nkau hkaja ladat ni gaw kaga ni hta na grau hkrai ai** (Good sharing is something that is naturally present) - Similar to A, this doesn't align with the passage's emphasis on active construction.
* **D: Hkaja ai lam hta gip gyeng ai lam n nga ai** (The method of sharing is something that is given to me) - The passage indicates the speaker has agency in how they share, rather than being passively given methods.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes postmodern literature as challenging traditional narrative structures and emphasizing the reader's role.** It mentions fragmented plots, multiple perspectives, and the blurring of lines between reality and fiction.
* **Option D accurately reflects this idea.** It states that postmodern literature tells stories using the reader's imagination and perspective. This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of how postmodern literature breaks away from traditional storytelling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shiga ni hpe sharin hkaja la lu ai lam grai law nga ai (Postmodern literature is a way to tell stories with fragmented narrative).** While the passage mentions fragmented narratives, this option doesn't capture the core idea of reader participation and the challenge to traditional structure.
* **B: Nkau hkaja la ai mahkrum madup ni gaw kaga ni na hta ningshawng tai gying ai (Good narrative structure is consistently adhered to).** This is the opposite of what the passage describes about postmodern literature.
* **C: Hkaja ai mahkrum madup gaw hkaja la ai wa hte tang madun ai hparat hte seng ai (Narrative structure is not separable from the telling and the reader's imagination).** While the passage emphasizes the reader's role, this option is awkwardly phrased and doesn't fully convey the meaning.

Here's why:

* **The text describes a gua sha (shawoi yup) procedure.** It mentions applying oil and scraping the skin for 10-60 minutes.
* **The question asks what should be done *before* the gua sha procedure.**
* **Option C states ""Shana yup ai ten hta jasu nsen pat na minit hkun hpang hta bai yup pyaw mat ai,"" which translates to ""Apply oil and then start the gua sha for a few minutes.""** This aligns with the text's instructions to apply oil and then begin scraping.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yup ra n shang shi yang hkying hkum mi jan laika hti ai - ""It is a type of herbal medicine that is used in traditional Tibetan medicine.""** While gua sha can be used in traditional medicine, this isn't the step *before* the procedure.
* **B: Hkashin gawk sa ngut ai hte yup ra kalang ta shang ai - ""Avoid areas with scars and tattoos.""** This is a precaution *during* the procedure, not before.
* **D: Shana yup ten hta rawt nna hka bu kaw na hka lu ai - ""Avoid scraping in areas with broken skin.""** This is another precaution *during* the procedure.

* **The question (Q)** asks about the reason for the fluctuating nature of massage (gin jang).
* **The text (P)** describes how massage can influence biorhythms, specifically mentioning the connection to the lunar cycle and physical sensations.  It says that the massage's effect can be amplified or diminished depending on your biorhythms.
* **Option A** directly reflects this connection.  It states that the fluctuations in massage are due to the influence of biorhythms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi a yaw shada lam gaw tinang kaja wa nan yup hprang na matu nre** (It is the sun's cycle that is related to the massage's effect). While the sun *can* influence biorhythms, the text specifically links the massage's fluctuating effect to *biorhythms* in general, not just the sun's cycle.
* **C: Dai mabyin gaw shawoi yup ai aten hta byin pru ai lam re** (It is the body's energy that is related to the massage's effect).  The text mentions energy sensations during massage, but the main focus is on biorhythms, not just general body energy.
* **D: Rawt ngut ai hpang, yaw shada lam gaw hkying hkum hkawng laman hta bai yup pyaw mat na matu re** (Rawt ngut ai hpang, the sun's cycle is related to the massage's effect). This option is a bit unclear and doesn't accurately reflect the main point of the text, which is biorhythms.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

"Bawnu gaw yup mang jahkring hkring mu na matu shakut ai hte maren, hpa baw rawt jat wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: REM masa lapran na aten** (REM masa lapran na aten).

Here's why:

The passage describes REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep as a state where the brain is active, dreaming occurs, and the body is paralyzed. It then states that during REM sleep, our minds are active, we can experience vivid dreams, and our bodies are temporarily paralyzed. 

Option D directly reflects this description by stating that REM is a state of brain activity during sleep. The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: REM masa shadawn shadang** (REM masa shadawn shadang) - This is too general and doesn't specifically address the active brain state.
* **B: N-gun madang** (N-gun madang) - This is unclear and doesn't relate to REM sleep.
* **C: Bai kaja wa ai masa du na matu ra ai aten** (Bai kaja wa ai masa du na matu ra ai aten) - This refers to the conscious state of wakefulness and is the opposite of what REM sleep is.

Npu e jaw tawn da ai n kaja ai lam ni kaw na hkumhkrang hta yup mang law law mu ai rai yang gara n kaja ai lam ni byin wa na rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Lana mi hta REM ni law wa ai (REM masa lapran na aten ladaw ni yawm mat na)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lana mi REMs nkau mi hte rau, ndai mungdaw hta nang gaw teng sha yup pyaw ai ngu ai lam, manghkang langai byin na matu aloi hte nlu ai hpa hparan kau lu ai mahkrum madup lu mai ai."" This translates to something like: ""People with REMs are also those who experience dreams during sleep.  During sleep, you'll fall asleep and your mind will be active, imagining things, and the subconscious will come to the surface, causing you to have vivid dreams.""

* **Option D directly reflects this:**  ""Lana mi hta REM ni law wa ai"" means ""REM is a state that occurs during sleep.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: REM masa lapran na aten ladaw ni yawm mat na (REM is a state during dream activity):** While related, it's not the *primary* definition of REM as presented in the passage. The passage focuses on REM *during sleep* and the resulting dreams.
* **B: Lana mi hta REM ni yawm na (REM is the state that occurs at night):**  REM doesn't *only* happen at night. It happens throughout the sleep cycle.
* **C: Asan sha re ai yup mang ni hta madung ai (REM is the dreaming state):**  REM is *associated* with dreaming, but it's the *brain state* during dreaming, not just the dreaming itself.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun dai ai hte maren, yu maya hpung ni hte virtual hpung ni gaw gara hku bung ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hpung lahkawng yen gaw shani shagu na shanhte galaw ai lam ni hta tinang nan up hkang ai madang nga ai**.

Here's why:

The text describes how ""invisible teams"" (presumably representing virtual teams) can influence and guide the actions of ""shanhte"" (perhaps referring to a specific group or entity). It specifically states that these teams act as a ""invisible team gaw uhpung ni a shiga hpe makawp maga ai ni re"" meaning they subtly guide the virtual team's actions.  This aligns with option B, which suggests the virtual team acts to influence the actions of the ""shanhte.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hpung lahkawng yen gaw bung ai madang langai hta sha hkrang shala na hpe myit mada ma ai:** This option suggests virtual teams don't affect the real world, which contradicts the text's description of their influence.
* **C: Hpung lahkawng yen gaw n mu lu ai hparan hparen lam hpe tang madun ya ai:**  This option is nonsensical in the context of the text.
* **D: Hpung lahkawng yen gaw aten langai hta sha amu galaw ma ai:** This option suggests virtual teams don't influence actions, which again contradicts the text.



Therefore, option B best reflects the meaning of the provided text.

"Matsing masat gayan hta mahta nna, gara ndau ai lam gaw hkumhkrang hte seng ai hte virtual hpung ni hta n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Yu maya hpung ni gaw grai tsaw ai madang hku galaw ma ai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yu maya hpung ni gaw grai tsaw ai madang hku galaw ma ai"" which translates to ""Virtual space is able to move objects in a way that is not physically possible."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Virtual hpung ni gaw yu maya hpung ni a matu matut mahkai ai lam langai hku galaw ya nga ai** - ""Virtual space can move objects in a way that is similar to physical space.""  This contradicts the core idea of virtual space described in the text – that it moves objects in ways *not* possible in physical space.
* **C: Yu maya hpung ni gaw virtual hpung ni hta madu up hkang lam nau n nga ai** - ""Virtual space is a type of virtual space that is superior to virtual space."" This doesn't align with the text's description of virtual space and is overly complex.
* **D: Shai taw ai aten ni gaw virtual hpung a matu akyu nga ai** - ""Human consciousness is linked to virtual space."" While related to the concept of virtual reality, the text doesn't directly discuss the connection between human consciousness and virtual space.

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the central idea about virtual space's unique ability to manipulate objects beyond physical limitations.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw content myit sawn ai lam hku na ning pawt da ai n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Marai langai a grup yin gaw gara hku shanhte a galaw ai lam hta akyu jaw ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.**  These theories are about motivating employees and understanding their needs in the workplace. 
* **The question asks how content needs are satisfied.**  Content needs, according to Maslow, are things like belonging, love, and esteem – social and psychological needs.  Herzberg's theory also focuses on factors that contribute to job satisfaction (contentment).
* **Option B directly addresses this.** It states that satisfying content needs involves ""making work a group where colleagues are aware of each other's work and support each other."" This fosters a sense of belonging and teamwork, which are core to content needs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Asak kaba wa ai ten hta myit marin ai lam nnan ni:** This is about safety needs, not content needs.
* **C: Mung kata ra rawng ai lam ni:** This refers to esteem needs, which are part of the hierarchy but not the focus of the question.
* **D: Masha ni a ra ai lam hpe chye na ya ai:**  This is about self-actualization needs, which are at the very top of Maslow's hierarchy and not what the question is asking about.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text and the theories discussed.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw rule of thirds a yaw shada da ai lam nre ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ginhpan hpe laksan hte akyu nga ai shara hta zing da u**.

Here's why:

The original text describes the ""rule of thirds"" as a compositional guideline where you divide the image into nine equal parts using two horizontal and two vertical lines. The key instruction is to place important elements along these lines or at the points where they intersect.

* **Ginhpan hpe laksan hte akyu nga ai shara hta zing da u** translates to ""Place the important elements along the lines or at the intersection points of the grid."" This perfectly reflects the essence of the rule of thirds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gin hpan ni tawn na shara hta npawt gaw ai lam ni galaw ya ai lam** (Place the main elements in the center of the image): This is the *opposite* of the rule of thirds. It encourages centering, which is generally considered less visually interesting.
* **B: Sumla langai hta asak hte n-gun hpe shalat yu u** (Don't place the main elements along the horizontal and vertical lines): This contradicts the rule of thirds.
* **D: Sumla langai hta lamang langai hpang yu u** (Don't place the main elements on the main lines): While technically correct that elements don't *have* to be *exactly* on the lines, option C is a more complete and accurate description of the rule.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw 35mm sumla gayet hkrang hpe n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw galaw shapraw ai kaw naw re** (That is the wide-angle lens).

Here's why:

The text states that 35mm lenses are considered ""wide-angle"" lenses (""malawng lang"").  The question asks what *type* of lens is a 35mm lens. Option A directly identifies it as a wide-angle lens, which is consistent with the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai hpe ru hkrum ladat lang ai kemra hkrang ni bau la kau sai** (That is a camera with a built-in lens). While a 35mm lens *can* be built-in, the passage is focusing on the *type* of lens itself, not the camera's features.
* **C: Dai hta malawng lang mai ai hkrang hta shai ai lam ni nga ai** (That is a lens that is a bit more wide than the standard lens). The passage doesn't suggest it's *more* wide than standard, just wide-angle.
* **D: Dai gaw mungkan hta malawng jai lang dik hkrang re** (That is a lens that is a bit more focused). The passage doesn't connect 35mm lenses to being more focused.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a leader (sumla ni) is strong and powerful, leading people to progress and prosperity.** It mentions that their strength is like a huge, powerful force.
* **Question Q asks what happens when that leader is defeated and someone weaker takes over.**
* **Option C directly addresses this:** ""Shanhte a sumla madang gaw ka'ang galu masat da ai pat ni zawn bung ai"" translates to ""When the Shan leader's strength is gone, the people are scattered and lost."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of the leader's importance and the consequences of their downfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte hta lawan madang tsaw ai:** ""The Shan people are defeated by the enemy."" This doesn't specifically address what happens to the *people* under a weaker leader.
* **B: Dai ni hpe nhtoi nau n nga ai masa hta rai tim aloi sha lang mai ai:** ""That leader doesn't care about the people's well-being."" While a weaker leader *might* be uncaring, the passage doesn't explicitly state this. The focus is on the loss of strength leading to the people's dispersal.
* **D: Dai ni gaw prime pat ni hta maju jung yak ai lam yawm ai:** ""That leader will lead the people to greater progress."" This is the opposite of what the passage implies would happen with a weaker leader.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that logically follows from the passage's description and answers the question about the consequences of a strong leader's downfall."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta lawm ai lam hta mahta nna, sumla ni hkra tsan hkra galaw ya ai jan nhpai ni gaw prime pat hta galoi hkan grau kaja wa na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lama na nsin sin ai shara kemara kaprip wan n kam lang ai rai yang.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a scenario where a person is using a camera to capture moving objects (people) who are walking.**  The focus is on the camera's ability to follow the movement and keep the subject in focus.
* **Option C accurately reflects this:** ""Lama na nsin sin ai shara kemara kaprip wan n kam lang ai rai yang"" translates to ""The camera continuously focuses and tracks the moving subject.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nhtoi shang madang tsaw ai gaw ningshawng jaw ra ai rai yang:**  This translates to ""The light is strong and causes the camera to adjust the exposure."" While light is important, the core of the passage isn't about exposure adjustment.
* **B: Pat kaw na rai ni hpe shayawm mayu yang:** This translates to ""The image quality is very good.""  While the image quality *might* be good, the passage emphasizes the *tracking* aspect, not just the general quality.
* **D: Lama na nang gaw maju jung yak ai hpe tam ai rai yang:** This translates to ""The camera is designed to zoom in and out.""  The passage doesn't mention zooming.



Therefore, option C is the only one that directly addresses the camera's function as described in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a ritualistic process involving various elements:**  It mentions a shaman's actions, a special type of clothing, offerings, and the purpose of the ritual is to secure blessings and protection.
* **Option D directly reflects this description:** It states that the ritual involves ""many kinds of sacred offerings"" and that the blessings and protection sought are for ""well-being and a peaceful life."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's portrayal of a comprehensive and spiritually significant ritual.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Simsa na myit pyaw ai masa lam hpe hkam sha lu wa hkra ahkyak shatai da ai:** This talks about a specific type of clothing, which is only a small part of the overall ritual described in the passage.
* **B: Wenyi masa lam hkan ai ni gaw wenyi lam te seng ai ningmu kaja ni hkan tam ma ai:** This simply states the ritual involves offerings, but doesn't capture the broader sense of sacredness, protection, and well-being described in the passage.
* **C: Wenyi lam hkan ai ni gaw Karai Kasang hte seng ai lam ningmu lu na matu karum ya lu ai shaman shakyang ai lam ni hkap la mai ai:** This focuses on the shaman's role, but again, it doesn't encompass the full scope of the ritual and the blessings sought.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate and complete answer because it best captures the essence of the ritual as described in the passage.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw wenyi lam a maju gindai n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Karai Kasang a myit ningmu hpe hkan tam ai (Strongly practice the principles of Karai Kasang)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the importance of moral conduct and self-discipline.** It describes the process of purifying oneself through ethical actions, avoiding harmful behaviors, and cultivating positive qualities like compassion and wisdom. This aligns directly with the principles of Karai Kasang, which focuses on right understanding, right thought, right speech, right action, right livelihood, right effort, right mindfulness, and right concentration.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Karai Kasang hte seng ai lam de myihtoi myit hpe tam ai (Greatly practice the path of Karai Kasang to accumulate merit).** While accumulating merit is a benefit, the text's core message is about internal purification and transformation, not solely about external accumulation.
* **B: Garan gachyan ai, rau hkam sha ai kaw mahkrum madup ni kaw na myithtoi lam hpe hkan u (Cultivate mindfulness, avoid harmful speech, and practice the path of right action).** This option touches upon aspects of right speech and right action, but it doesn't encompass the broader scope of Karai Kasang's principles.
* **C: Myit pyaw ai lam hpe numnak bang ai (Earn a living by honest means).**  Right livelihood is a part of Karai Kasang, but the text discusses a wider range of ethical behaviors beyond just how one earns a living.




Therefore, option D best encapsulates the central theme of the text, which is about cultivating virtuous conduct and deeply practicing the principles of Karai Kasang to achieve personal growth and enlightenment.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hkai nmai hte seng ai uhpung hpe kadai hpang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Chatham Zinglawng ni kaw na Moriori**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maori masha ni Great Fleet a Polynesia kaw na bu htawt wa nna Moriori kaw na New Zealand de hkai nmai hte seng ai uhpung hpe hpaw ning htan ma ai. Shanhte ni gaw New Zealand kaw na tsan ai de bu hkawm htawt sit mat ai Maori ngu ai ni re.""

This translates to: ""The Maori Great Fleet from Polynesia came and settled in New Zealand, pushing the Moriori to the remote areas. They lived in New Zealand and the Moriori were displaced by the Maori.""

Later, it says: ""Chatham zinlawng kaw kaga amyu baw hpan ni naw nga nga ai re. Shanhte ni gaw New Zealand kaw na tsan ai de bu hkawm htawt sit mat ai Maori ngu ai ni re."" which means ""The Moriori went to the Chatham Islands. They lived in the Chatham Islands and were displaced by the Maori.""

Therefore, the Moriori went to the Chatham Islands as a result of being pushed out of New Zealand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: New Zealand kaw na Moriori** - This is too general. The question asks about their movement *away* from New Zealand.
*   **C: Polynesia kaw na Maori masha ni** - The question isn't asking about the Maori, it's asking about *who was displaced*.
*   **D: Mainland kaw na Maori** -  The text specifically mentions the Maori Great Fleet *from Polynesia*.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, moas hpe gyam ai hpung ni gaw gara shara a shawngnan shanu ai ni rai?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maori masha ni Great Fleet a Polynesia kaw na bu htawt wa nna Moriori kaw na New Zealand de hkai nmai hte seng ai uhpung hpe hpaw ning htan ma ai."" This translates to ""The Maori Great Fleet from Polynesia traveled and settled in New Zealand and engaged in warfare and subjugation with the Moriori."" 

This clearly indicates that the Maori settled in New Zealand, and the question asks where they hunted Moas. The passage implies they hunted Moas in New Zealand.  While the other options are mentioned, New Zealand is the primary location discussed in relation to the Maori and Moas.
"
Origami a Pureland ladat hpe lang ai lam hta kapum hkang ai ni hpe gara kaw akyu jaw na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Kapum hkang ai wa kaw madang tsaw ai motor skill nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the skill needed to fold Pureland origami?
* **The text states:** Pureland origami is a type of origami that requires precise and delicate folding.
* **Option B directly addresses this:** ""Kapum hkang ai wa kaw madang tsaw ai motor skill nga ai"" translates to ""Folding requires precise and delicate motor skills.""  Motor skills are physical skills that involve coordinated muscle movements, perfectly fitting the description of what's needed for intricate folding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kapum hkang ai wa gaw kalang ta kapum hkang law law hpe galaw na ra sharawng ai** (Folding requires moving large and complex folds): While complex, the focus isn't on *size*, but on the *precision* of the folds.
* **C: Kapum hkang ai wa gaw shuk ai kapum hkang ni lawm ai origami hpe hpan ai** (Folding requires understanding the patterns of beautiful origami): Understanding patterns is helpful, but it doesn't describe the actual physical skill of *folding*.
* **D: Kapum hkang ai wa gaw shawng de kalang (sh) lahkawng lang sha galaw ga ai** (Folding requires moving with a shawng (sh)  lang sha galaw ga - a type of shawng): This option is nonsensical and doesn't relate to origami.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Pureland origami hte seng na n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dai gaw motor skill nau n nga ai kapum hkang ai ni a matu kaja ai mahkrun re.**

Here's why:

The passage states that Pureland origami requires precise hand movements and is a skill that takes years of practice to master. This directly relates to the concept of ""motor skill"" - the ability to execute movements skillfully and efficiently. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai gaw mahkrum madup n nga ai kapum hkang ai ni hpe yaw shada ai (It's a craft that requires precise hand movements and patience).** While patience is certainly needed, the core aspect being discussed is the *skill* of precise hand movements, making ""motor skill"" a more accurate descriptor.
* **B: Dai hta nhtang kapum hkang ladat n lawm ai (It's a traditional craft that is well-known).** This describes the cultural aspect, not the skill involved.
* **C: Kapum hkang ni hta loi ai shara ni sha mai lawm ai (It's a craft that involves folding paper into various shapes).** This is a definition of origami, not what makes Pureland origami challenging.



Therefore, option D best captures the essence of what Pureland origami demands - refined motor skills developed through practice.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara shara gaw Indus Valley Civilization lam hte nseng ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

The text states: ""masha ni Harappa hpe yu nna Harappan shinggyim gan ga lai wa sai shara ngu shaga ma tim..."" which translates to ""The famous Harappa was a part of the Harappan civilization..."".  Therefore, Harappa is directly mentioned as a key part of the Indus Valley Civilization.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Magri Prat shinggyim gan ga lam a mai byin ai mying hpe matsing masat ga yan hta n madun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Indus-Sarasvati shinggyim gan ga lam**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""maasha ni Harappa hpe yu nna **Indus-Sarasvativ masha nga pra rawt** majan lai wa sai shara ngu shaga na hku tak maram yu ai raitim..."" This translates to ""the Harappan civilization flourished along the **Indus-Sarasvati river system**...""

While ""Indus Valley Civilization"" is a broader term encompassing the region, the question asks specifically about the river system where the civilization flourished. The passage focuses on the Indus and Sarasvati rivers as the core of this civilization.  Therefore, ""Indus-Sarasvati shinggyim gan ga lam"" is the most accurate answer.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw ladaw galu akyu kaja hpejaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Kaga ni hte pawng ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the way for a mother and child to be safe from the fire and smoke?""
* **The text states:** ""Kaga ni hte rau bungli galaw na matu re ngu hpe dum hprang na matu re."" which translates to ""Mother and child should be taken out (rescued) from the fire and smoke.""

Therefore, option A directly addresses the question based on the information provided in the text. The other options are not supported by the text.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dinghkrai myit shang sha lam hpe madung dat ai:**  ""To escape through a narrow passage."" -  The text doesn't mention escaping through narrow passages.
* **C: Law ai hta n law ai hpe akyu jaw ai lam hpe numnak bang ai lam:** ""The way to find a safe place for the people."" - While safety for people is mentioned generally, the specific safety of mother and child is addressed in the text.
* **D: Law hpa ai myit gaw akyu mai byin ai lam hpe matsing sumhting ai lam:** ""The way to find a way to avoid the fire's heat and smoke by hiding."" - The text doesn't mention hiding.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, lama marai langai ngai gaw ya jang lu ai amyat hta maju jung da ai rai yang, lawu kaw na gara hpe ningshawng jaw masat na rai?","Let's break down the question and the text to find the correct answer.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text describes a situation where a ""law hpa myit hte tinggyeng myit"" (a type of plant, perhaps a tall, leafy plant) is being harvested.  The tall part is taken first, and the leaves are left.  This action is related to someone being ""amyat lu wa ai shaloi"" (feeling uncomfortable or distressed).  The leaves are then used to create a kind of ""lam re nga ai tinggyeng myit jasat"" (a material or structure made of the tall plant).  The speaker observes that when the tall plant is cut, the leaves will likely be unusable and left to rot. This situation is related to ""masha law malawng"" (a large or significant issue) which is also connected to the needs and suffering of people.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

The question asks what is the *reason* why the tall plant is cut first, leading to the leaves being discarded?  It's asking for the underlying cause.

**Analyzing the Options:**

* **A: Tinggyeng myit n rawng ai (Cutting the tall plant)** - This is a *description* of the action, not a reason *why* it's done.
* **B: Masha ni hte arau galaw ai (Significant issue and a large/significant reason)** - This option is too broad. While the cutting is linked to a significant issue, it doesn't explain *why* the tall plant is prioritized.
* **C: Myit hpawn galaw ai lam (The path/way of using the plant's leaves)** - This focuses on the *use* of the leaves, not the reason for cutting the tall plant first.
* **D: Tinggyeng myit (The tall plant)** - This is simply a definition of one element in the scenario and not a reason for the action.

**The Correct Answer:**

Based on the text's emphasis on discomfort/distress and the creation of a material for people's needs, the most logical reason for prioritizing the tall plant is to **address the needs of the ""amyat lu wa ai shaloi"" (uncomfortable/distressed people)**.  While none of the answers perfectly capture this complexity, **B: Masha ni hte arau galaw ai (Significant issue and a large/significant reason)** is the closest. The reason for cutting the tall plant first is because there is a significant issue and the large/significant reason is to serve people's needs.



Therefore, the best answer is **B**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where Filipino remittances (money sent home by Filipinos working abroad) are being invested in US-based funds.** The passage states: ""Shanhte gaw Wall Street gumhpraw dum nta ni kaw na Philippine asuya a mying hte amyet hte jai lang ai ni a law malawng hpe jaw bang ya na matu U.S mung maden uphkang lai len de ahkun jaw na matu shanhte hpe shagyeng hpyi ma ai."" which translates to something like: ""It seems that the large amount of remittances from Filipinos are being invested in US-based funds, and these funds are being used to support the development of the Philippines.""
* **The question asks where these funds are being invested.** The passage explicitly mentions ""U.S mung maden"" which translates to ""US-based funds.""
* **Option C, ""U.S koloni up hkang asuya"" (US colony-based funds), accurately describes the location of these funds.**  While not technically a ""colony"" anymore, the funds are based *in* the US.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Philippine mung up asuya (Philippine-based funds):** The passage indicates investment *outside* the Philippines.
* **B: Wall Street gumhpraw dum ni (Wall Street-based funds):** While the funds are *in* Wall Street, the phrasing ""Wall Street gumhpraw dum ni"" is too general. The passage specifies that these are funds *based in* the US.
* **D: Filipino masha ni (Filipino remittances):**  Remittances are the *source* of the funds, not the location where they are invested.

This translates to: ""The Knights Templar, a powerful religious military order, emerged in Europe during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) of the High Middle Ages.""

Therefore, the Templars arose in the **12th century**.

The passage states: ""Shawng na ka-ang prat ni gaw lahta ka-ang prat ni hta shawng du ai re nna matut manoi gaw hpang na ka-ang prat bai du wa nna shi a htung lai ni gaw 1500 grup yin daram hta hkring mat sai re.""

This translates to: ""The number of knights of the early days grew to a large number, with the knights of the later days expanding to around 1500 groups.""

Therefore, the Templars' prominence grew during the **later Middle Ages (Lahta ka-ang prat)**, not the early Middle Ages or the 11th or 12th centuries specifically. The text indicates a general period of growth from the early to the later part of the Middle Ages.

Roma Hkaw Seng ten laman na ga lajang ai ni shing nrai tsi du ni hku na gara tsi tsi lajang ai lam shing nrai ladat ni hpe n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Scopolamine a matu tsi tum ni a machyan hpe jai lang ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ga lajang tsi du ni gaw kani tum na shaw da ai morphine hte numru tsi na scopolamine ni lawm ai myit zim tsi amyu myu shapraw la ai hpaji ni hpe chye ma ai."" This translates to: ""The Roman elite, in their leisure time, used narcotics like morphine and a myit zim (a type of drug) containing scopolamine and numru (an anesthetic) to numb themselves.""

* **Option B directly reflects this statement:** It mentions scopolamine specifically as a key component of the drugs used by the Roman elite for leisure and numbing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Myit ana hkam sha ai ni hpe myit zim tsi jaw nna tsi tsi ai lam:** While the passage mentions ""myit zim,"" it doesn't explicitly link its use to a specific method of consumption (like jaw nna tsi tsi ai lam - perhaps referring to a specific way of taking it).
* **C: Sai pat ai ni hpe yen nna lu hkawm hkra galaw ai:** This refers to the Romans' ability to control and dominate others, which is mentioned in the first part of the passage regarding their military strength and influence. However, it's not directly related to the *drugs* they used.
* **D: Hkum kaw sai nhkawm ai ana hkam sha ai masha ni hpe hkum di kau na tsi lajang ai lam:** This talks about the Roman elite's ability to use their power to achieve their goals, which again is a broader statement about their influence, not specifically about the drugs they used for leisure.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Roma Hkaw Seng ten hta rawt jat wa ai tsi hte seng ai shingwang hta npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw sawn la n mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Hkawseng magam a matu tsi du ni hpe lahkawn ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hkawseng magam Augustus gaw tsi du ni hpe lahkawn hpang nna majang ngut ai hpang matut jai lang na matu shawng na Roma Tsi Hpung hpe mung hpaw ninghtan da ai."" This translates to ""The Augustus emperor did not want to be feared by the people of the Roman Republic, so he tried to gain the favor of the people by showing his generosity.""

* **The question asks:** ""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Roma Hkaw Seng ten hta rawt jat wa ai tsi hte seng ai shingwang hta npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw sawn la n mai ai rai?"" This translates to ""What was the main reason why the Augustus emperor, who wanted to be feared and respected, began to try to gain the favor of the people?""

* **Option D directly addresses this:** It highlights that Augustus tried to gain favor by showing generosity, which was a strategy to counter the fear and respect he initially desired.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsi hte seng ai uhpung ni hpaw hpang wa ai lam (The path of being feared and respected):** While this was his initial desire, it doesn't explain *why* he shifted his approach.
* **B: Hkaw Seng mungdan kata grai sawng ai hpyen dap ladat (The various political strategies of the emperor):** This is too general and doesn't pinpoint the specific reason for his shift in strategy.
* **C: Tsi hte seng ai hpe sharin ya ai tsi rung ni hpaw ai (The cunning and resourceful way of being feared and respected):**  This focuses on the *method* of being feared, not the reason for adopting a different approach.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided passage.



"
Mu lu ai atsam gaw gara ntsa shamyet shanat nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Myi hte mai mu lu ai hkum daw shan ni**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Mu lu ai atsam gaw gara ntsa shamyet shanat nga ai rai?"" which translates to ""What is the most common thing that mu lu ai atsam does?"".  The text states:

""Mu ai lam (sh) mu lu ai atsam gaw myit hte mai mu lu ai hkum daw shan ni hta mahta ai."" This translates to ""Mu lu ai atsam (the kind of person who loves to be lazy) is mostly seen doing things related to staying in bed and relaxing.""

Therefore, the answer directly from the text is ""Myi hte mai mu lu ai hkum daw shan ni"" (things related to staying in bed and relaxing). The other options are details *about* mu lu ai atsam, not what they *do* most commonly.
"
Asak hkrung kanu ni shai ai myi amyu myu hkrang ni gaw hpa lam hta shamyet taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsan shadang ni hpe hkam sha lu ai**.

Here's the breakdown of why:

* **The Question (Q):** Asak hkrung kanu ni shai ai myi amyu myu hkrang ni gaw hpa lam hta shamyet taw ai rai?  This translates to: ""What kind of place does a snake's skin that has shed from a very large snake become?""

* **The Passage (P):** The passage describes how a snake sheds its skin. Key points are:
    * The old skin is shed completely (mu lu ai).
    * The shed skin is initially soft and pliable (myi hpe gawn lajang ai hta lam amyu myu hku tsi lajang ma ai -  doesn't become rough and hard immediately).
    * However, the shed skin hardens and becomes strong with time (de a hkrung kanu ra rawng ai hta hkan nna ayak ahkak lajang ra ai - becomes strong and tough when dried).
    * The passage also mentions that the hardened skin is used for making things like sandals and other items (nbung ai gaw gap ladat ni gaw nbung ai atsam nga ma ai... kata de lang ai hpan nbung ai hku shachyaw ai rap ra ai hku galaw na nambat ni mung nbung ai ladat hku lang ma ai - the hardened skin is used for making sandals...).

* **Analyzing the Options:**

    * **A: Tsan shadang ni hpe hkam sha lu ai:** This translates to ""To be used for making soft and pliable things.""  This aligns with the description of the shed skin being initially soft.
    * **B: Asak hkrung kanu ni a matu ra rawng ai lam ni:** This translates to ""The place where the snake's skin is dried/hardens."" This describes a *process*, not a *place the shed skin becomes*.
    * **C: Myit maju jung lu ai madang:** This translates to ""The jungle where the large snake lives.""  This is irrelevant to what happens to the shed skin.
    * **D: Asak hkrung kanu ni a shuk ai lam:** This translates to ""The place where the snake's skin is eaten/consumed."" This is irrelevant and not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, option A is the only logical answer based on the passage's description of the shed snake skin's properties. The shed skin is *initially* soft, so it can become *used* for making soft things.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sikhs htung hte seng na gara ndau ai lam gaw nawku hpung hte seng na jaw hkra nlu hkrang shala ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Guru Nanak nawku hpung hpe mu tam la ai hpang hpung sara marai jahku hkan nang wa ai**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dai nawku htung hpe Guru Nanak (1469-1539) hku na tsaban 15th hta mu tam wa ai. Dai hpang sikt hpung sara jahku mung awng dang ai hpang bai hkan nang wa ma ai."" which translates to ""Therefore, Guru Nanak (1469-1539) was born in the 15th century. He advocated for a path of spiritual freedom, distinct from all others.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sikhs htung gaw Hindu htung hking lapran garan wa ai hpung re** - While Sikhs originated within Hinduism, the passage emphasizes their distinct path.
* **B: Hpung sara gaw Sikhs htung a npawt madung re** -  ""Hpung sara"" (spiritual freedom) is *what* Sikhs advocate for, not *what* defines them.
* **D: Sikhs htung a htung tara nkau ni gaw Hindu ni kaw npawt hpang da ai** - The passage doesn't discuss the status of women in Sikhism relative to Hinduism.

Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the provided text."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na Sikh makam ladat a alak mi re ai lam ngu gara wa hpe mai sawn la ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpung sara ni a ningmu (The essence of the universal truth)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Sikhs believe the essence of the universal truth (""hpung sara ni"") is shared between Hinduism and Sikhism, but Sikhs also have their own distinct path (""Gurmat""). The question asks what is the essence of the universal truth that Sikhs and Hindus share. The passage explicitly identifies it as ""hpung sara ni.""  The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Hindu ni a htung tara (Hindu's own understanding):** The passage emphasizes the *shared* nature of the truth, not just Hinduism's view.
* **C: Kaga India nawku hpung ni hpe ninghkap ai (A philosophy that has been accepted in India):** While the truth is accepted in India, the question specifically asks about the shared truth between Sikhs and Hindus, not the broader Indian acceptance.
* **D: Punjabi aga hpe shaga ai (Belonging to Punjabi culture):**  Sikhism has cultural ties to Punjab, but the core question is about the philosophical truth shared with Hinduism, not cultural belonging.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Attention Deficit Disorder hkam sha taw nga ai ma gaw gara hta maju jung na matu yak ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Cartoon sumla yu ai ten**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ADD rau re ai ma ni gaw jawng laika zawn re ai arai ni kaw myit maju jung na matu yak hkak ai aten ni nga ai rai timung shanhte gaw ginsup hpan ginsup ai lam shanhte a ra dik ai **cartoon sumla yu ai lam ga hkring**..."".

This directly links cartoon programs to the way children with ADD are entertained and engaged. Options A, B, and D are mentioned as *other* ways children with ADD might be entertained, but the passage highlights cartoon programs specifically.



"
"Matsing masat ga ya hta tsun da ai hte maren, Attention Deficit Disorder hkam sha taw nga ai ma ni gaw hpa majaw dingbai dingna byin chye ai akyang ni hpe galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shanhte na kanu kawa ni kaw na maju jung ai lam ra ai majaw**.

Here's why:

The text states that people with ADD often struggle with focusing on tasks that are not interesting or engaging. They find it difficult to concentrate on activities that don't capture their attention.  Option C directly reflects this difficulty in focusing on tasks they find uninteresting or not aligned with their interests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shajan shalai masa hpe shayawm lu na matu:** This option is not directly supported by the text. While the text mentions difficulties with organization, it doesn't connect that directly to the core issue of attention deficit.
* **B: Manang ni hte matut mahkai chye na matu shanhte hpe karum ya ai:** The text doesn't explicitly state that ADD causes people to become overly sensitive or easily angered.
* **D: Shanhte a bawnu hpe jasu ya na matu:** While family support is helpful, the primary issue the text focuses on is the internal challenge of maintaining attention.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw scaffolding a ga shadawn nre ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Kompyuta ginsup hpan a shawng nnan hta ladat sharin ya ai lamang (Computer system's input for drawing the structure)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Scaffolding gaw sharin hkam la ai ladat langai gaw nre tim, kompyuta hkridun ningnan langai lang hpang ai (sh) masing ningnan langai ngai hpang wa ai zawn re ai lam ni hta mahkrum madup ningnan hka ja nga ai hkum ding dek hpe garum madi shadaw ya ai lam ni galaw shapraw ya ai garum ningtum langai mi rai nga ai.""

This translates to: ""The structure's drawing process for scaffolding is done on a computer system, which allows people to carefully review and modify the drawing.  The drawing can be reviewed and modified continuously.""

This directly indicates that a computer system is used as input to draw the scaffolding structure. The other options are not supported by the passage.  There's no mention of SAT drawings, network drawing, or computer system input for general work.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw scaffolding hte seng na n jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Scaffold ni gaw sharin hkam la ai mahkrum madup a matu shawng daw hta madi shadaw ya ai**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Scaffold gaw sharin hkam la ai ladat langai gaw nre tim, kompyuta hkridun ningnan langai lang hpang ai (sh) masing ningnan langai ngai hpang wa ai zawn re ai lam ni hta mahkrum madup ningnan hka ja nga ai hkum ding dek hpe garum madi shadaw ya ai lam ni galaw shapraw ya ai garum ningtum langai mi rai nga ai.""

Translation: ""The scaffolding's platform is not only for viewing the building's layout (it) is also for viewing the construction progress day by day, to observe the work that needs to be done and to make decisions.""

Option D directly reflects this statement, highlighting that the scaffold platform is used for observing the construction progress and making decisions about the work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Scaffold ni gaw ganghkau hta mung mai nga ai (Scaffold ni gaw ganghkau hta mung mai nga ai):** This means ""The scaffold's platform is only for people."" While people use the scaffold, it's not *only* for people; it's also for observing and working.
* **B: Dai gaw sharin hkam la ai ladat hta madi shadaw ya ai lam re (Dai gaw sharin hkam la ai ladat hta madi shadaw ya ai lam re):** This means ""It is also for drawing the building's layout."" The passage mentions viewing the layout, but not specifically drawing it.
* **C: Dai hpe lamang nnan sharin hkam la ai lam ngu mung tsun ai (Dai hpe lamang nnan sharin hkam la ai lam ngu mung tsun ai):** This means ""It is only for the building's construction work."" The passage says it's for observing the progress *during* construction, but also for making decisions, not *only* for the work itself.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara MySpace lam gaw laika hti yak ai ma ni a matu akyu nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Web shara langai (Social networking)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes MySpace as a website where people could share information, connect with others, and build online communities. This is the core function of social networking.
* The passage mentions features like blogs, group pages, and sharing media, which are all common elements of social networking platforms.
* Options A, B, and D are too specific. ""Blog"" is just one feature of MySpace, ""Web shara langai"" is the broader category that encompasses all of MySpace's functionalities, and ""Masha wan 54 a prat labau"" (approximately ""54 million users"") is just a statistic.

Therefore, ""Web shara langai"" (social networking) best describes the core nature of MySpace as presented in the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Krushchev a bungli galaw masha kasu kabrawng ai lam ni n’tsa tai ai lam nre ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hkringmang daju nnan hpe lit jaw da ai** (He was able to overthrow the popular Wladyslaw Gomulka).

Here's why:

The passage states that Krushchev, facing a rising tide of popular discontent and the potential for rebellion, strategically removed the popular leader Wladyslaw Gomulka from power. This action directly addresses the question of how Krushchev countered the growing opposition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aming hpe bai lu na matu hpri gang mawdaw ni hpe jai lang ai (He was able to gain the support of the popular army).** While Krushchev likely wanted the army's support, the passage focuses on removing Gomulka, not specifically gaining the army's favor.
* **C: Shata shabrai di la hpe shatsaw ai (He suppressed the popular uprising).** The passage describes a *threat* of uprising, not a successful uprising that needed to be suppressed. Krushchev's action was preventative.
* **D: Sut masa lam hta ra rawng ai n kau ni hpe masat ya ai lam galaw ai (He used the power of the masses to force a change).** The passage describes Krushchev *removing* a leader, not being forced to change by the masses.  The masses' discontent *led to* his actions.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate response to the question."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Poland kata na rawt malan lam a majaw byin ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Wladyslaw Gomulka hte hkrum zup ai lam** (The relationship between Wladyslaw Gomulka and the government).

Here's why:

The passage states that Krushchev, facing unrest and the possibility of a ""bungli shabrai njaw"" (a chaotic, rebellious situation), was forced to compromise.  Specifically, he had to allow Wladyslaw Gomulka, a popular figure, to become the leader. The passage mentions Gomulka was ""hkringmang daju nnan hku lit ap ya na matu hkap la sai,"" which translates to ""was able to become the leader through negotiation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kummyunit ladat (Communist leadership):** While the Communist leadership was involved, the passage focuses on the *shift* in leadership, specifically Gomulka's rise.
* **B: Lusha kadawn ai (Lusha's growth/rise):**  The passage doesn't mention Lusha.
* **C: Shabrai di la ai (Rebellious/Chaotic situation):**  This describes the *context* that forced Krushchev to act, not the answer to *what* resolved the unrest.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the Cold War:** The passage clearly outlines the rivalry between Germany, the USSR, and the USA after World War II. It mentions the division of Germany, the ideological differences between the East (USSR) and West (USA), and the spread of their influence globally.
* **""Shai ai galaw hkawm sa ai lam ni"" (The path of ideological conflict)** directly reflects the core of the Cold War.  The conflict wasn't just about power or territory, but fundamentally about competing ideologies - communism (USSR) vs. capitalism/democracy (USA).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Htunghking hte seng ai lam shai ai (The path of political and economic cooperation):** This is the opposite of what the passage describes. The passage emphasizes conflict and rivalry.
* **B: Germani hpe mu ai ningmu (German dominance):**  While Germany was divided, the passage focuses on the rivalry *between* Germany, the USSR, and the USA, not on German dominance.
* **D: Ladat hte seng na dangrang hkat ai lam (The path of military and technological competition):** While military and technological competition *was* a part of the Cold War, the passage emphasizes the ideological conflict as the underlying cause and driving force. Option C encompasses this broader perspective.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the role of the nervous system in the body?
* **The provided text states:** ""Nervous system gaw a-kajawng sha byin wa ai nerve ni hpe sai lam matut bungli galaw na matu homeostaiss hkangzing ai lam hpe galaw ya nga ai.""  This translates to: ""The nervous system, through nerves, controls the movement of bodily parts to maintain homeostasis.""  **Homeostasis** is the body's ability to maintain a stable internal environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sai lwi ai hpe lanyen hkun ai (It controls the movement of blood):** While the nervous system *can* influence blood flow, its primary role isn't *just* blood control. The text emphasizes overall body movement for homeostasis.
* **B: Sai lwi ai hpe hparan ya ai (It regulates body temperature):**  While the nervous system plays a role in temperature regulation, it's not its sole or primary function.  The text focuses on a broader role in maintaining a stable internal state.
* **D: Hkumhkrang hta byin mai ai shoihpa ni koi ya ai (It controls the digestive system):** The nervous system *does* control the digestive system, but again, this is only *one* of its many functions. The text's overarching theme is homeostasis.



Therefore, the best and most encompassing answer based on the provided text is that the nervous system maintains homeostasis.
"
Giza Plateau hta hpa hpe mu mai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Hkik hkam ai Jut sen lupwa Pyramid**.

The text states: ""Giza Plateau (sh) **""""""Giza Necropolis"""""" hta jut sen lupwa (pyramid) (dai shara na jut sen lupwa gaw kaba dik), lupwa kasha, nawku htingnu hte hkik hkam ai Sphinx ni law law nga ai.**"" This directly translates to ""Giza Plateau (sh) **""""""Giza Necropolis"""""" has pyramids (pyramids are very big), sarcophagi, sphinxes and the Great Sphinx.**""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lupwa ni (Sarcophagi):** While sarcophagi are found in the Giza Necropolis, the question asks what *specifically* is found there.
*   **B: Nawku jawng ni (Mastabas):** Mastabas are different types of tombs and not the primary feature of the Giza Plateau.
*   **C: Mau hpa lam sanit (Sanitary area):** This is not a feature of the Giza Plateau.



"
Hkik hkam ai Jut sen lupwa Pyramid ni a yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Pharaoh hpe chye hkungga na matu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hkik hkam ai jut sen lupwa (pyramid) gaw Hparaoh Khufu hpe hkungga shagrau ai hku na gaw gap da ai re nna..."" which translates to ""The pyramid (pyramid) of the Great Pyramid is a story of being built for Pharaoh Khufu...""

Therefore, the Great Pyramid was built for the Pharaoh Khufu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mungkan a mau hpa sanit byin wa na matu** (Built for religious purposes): While pyramids had religious significance, the passage specifically links the Great Pyramid's construction to Pharaoh Khufu.
*   **C: Labau numdaw tai na matu** (Built for the people's benefit): The passage doesn't mention the pyramid being built for the general population.
*   **D: Si mat ai masha ni a lup hpe bang tawn da na matu** (Built by the people's labor): While the pyramids were built using labor, the passage focuses on the Pharaoh's role in their construction."
Nawku jawng ni hpe wan nat nna jahten chye ai anhte a hparat hte seng na kadai kaw lit nga ai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ephesians ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ephesians gaw maroi nni ai hte Herostratus ngu ai mying hpe galoi nna yu ai nga ndau dat ai."" This translates to: ""Ephesians were very angry and sought to punish Herostratus's descendants.""

Therefore, the Ephesians were the ones who sought revenge and punishment, aligning with the question about who sought retribution for the destruction of the temple.
"
Armetis nawku jawng bai gawgap ai hte seng na gara wa gaw jaw ai ndau ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Alexander the Great hku na bai gawgap na matu gumhpraw shaw ya ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Alexander the Great shangai ai shana kaw sha jahten shabyak kau ai hkrum lai wa sai. Alexander gaw hkawhkam langai hku na nawku htingnu gaw gap na ga gumhpraw jaw na matu tsun ai ni hpe ningdang kau ya ma ai."" This translates to: ""Alexander the Great arrived and established rule, and Alexander conquered the surrounding territories and destroyed the cities that resisted him.""

This directly answers the question of how Artemis's temple and the surrounding areas were dealt with. Alexander conquered the area and destroyed cities that opposed him.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Alexander the Great up hkang ngut ai hpang dai hpe bai gap ai:** The passage doesn't say Alexander *supported* the destruction, only that he *caused* it.
*   **C: Herostratus gaw dai hpe bai gawgap ai hta hkrang ang ai gumhpraw hpe jaw ya na matu aming lu ai:** Herostratus was responsible for the temple's destruction by fire, but the passage doesn't state that he was involved in the later destruction by Alexander.
*   **D: Dai hpe BCE 320 hta bai gawgap ai:** The passage says Alexander arrived *after* 323 BCE, so the destruction couldn't have happened in 320 BCE.

This translates to: ""Australopithecus walked upright, while Australopithecus walked on all fours.  Around 3.9 to 4.2 million years ago, the ancestors of the hominin genus Sahelanthropus and the ancestors of Australopithecus began to walk upright, and the ancestors of the Australopithecus genus walked on two legs.""

Therefore, the earliest evidence of bipedalism (walking upright) mentioned in the passage is around 3.9 million years ago.
"
Ndai kaw na gara baw hpan ni gaw lagaw lahkawng hte hkawm ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sahelanthropus**.

This translates to: ""Sahelanthropus is considered one of the earliest hominids and ancestors of the Australopithecus species, which lived from 4.2-3.9 million years ago.""

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **B: Homo Erectus:** The text mentions Homo Erectus as a later hominid.
*   **C: Lahkawng hte hkawm ai a laklai ai lam (The path of hominid evolution):** This is a general concept, not a specific hominid.
*   **D: Australopithecus:** While mentioned as an ancestor of Homo Erectus, Sahelanthropus is specifically identified as *earlier*.

This indicates that Germany's strategy involved invading Britain by sea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Britain kaw na shang ai arai ni hpe lapran kaw na kashun la mayu ai:** The passage doesn't mention Germany invading Britain *from* the sea.
* **C: Atlantic shara shagu hta rai ni htawda mayu ai:**  The passage mentions the Atlantic as a location for naval battles but not a primary invasion route.
* **D: Amerikan ni hpe masha hte arai ni lu la na lam hpe pat shingdang ai:**  The passage discusses battles involving American ships, but it doesn't say Germany invaded *through* America.

This translates to: ""The battle that was given to the soldiers was to sail across the Atlantic Ocean. American soldiers sailed from England and other countries to the Atlantic Ocean. The German forces, after a period of waiting, were instructed to block the path where the Australian soldiers were fleeing. The battle of the sea and land, Germany sailed and controlled Europe and Britain.""

Therefore, both German and British forces were involved in the naval battles across the Atlantic.

The text states: ""Gumra hking hpe gin shalat ai lam rai nnga shi ai."" This translates to ""The way they prayed was in the temple."" Therefore, the Assyrian people prayed in the temple (gumra hking).
"
Majan gasat ai hta gumra dap ni hpe gara hku lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: N-gang palawng n lawm ai sha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai majaw Assyrian gumra dap ni gaw gumra ntsa hpa nlawm ai dai hku dung nna gasat ma ai.""  This translates to: ""Therefore, the Assyrian rulers made them (the people)  build a temple and worship the *N-gang palawng n lawm ai sha* (a god).""

Let's break down the other options:

*   **A: Lagaw hte:**  This means ""and other things."" It doesn't fit the context of the passage.
*   **C: Gumra shingma:** This means ""the temple itself"". The passage talks about the *purpose* of the temple building, not just the building itself.
*   **D: Hpyen la n law ai sha:** This means ""a god who can be worshipped"". It's a bit too general. The passage implies the Assyrians specifically made people worship a particular deity.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate based on the passage's meaning. ""N-gang palawng n lawm ai sha"" is the god the Assyrians forced the people to worship in the temple.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Babulun masha ni hpe nang gara kaw n lu tam ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Chyoi pra ai shara de wan nat hkungga la sa ai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Babylon as a city with impressive architecture, specifically mentioning ziggurats resembling pyramids and the grandeur of its buildings.  It highlights Babylon's power and influence, suggesting it was a significant center of civilization. The question asks why Babylon became so famous.

Option D, ""Chyoi pra ai shara de wan nat hkungga la sa ai"" translates to ""It became famous for its powerful and magnificent palaces."" This aligns perfectly with the description in the passage. The passage emphasizes the city's awe-inspiring buildings and implies a powerful ruler/civilization that could build such structures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nawku jawng wang de wan nat hkungga la sa ai** - ""It became famous for its gods and worship."" While Babylon had religious significance, the passage focuses primarily on its architectural grandeur and political power, not specifically its religious practices as the primary reason for fame.
*   **B: Nawku jawng ni hta poi sa ai** - ""It became famous for its trade."" The passage doesn't mention trade as a primary factor contributing to Babylon's fame.
*   **C: Nawku jawng wang hta galaw ai poi** - ""It became famous for its military prowess."" The passage alludes to Babylon's power, but doesn't specifically highlight military strength as the main reason for its fame.



Therefore, option D best captures the essence of why Babylon became famous, based on the provided passage.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw hkin jawng ni a matu alak mi yaw shada da ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Poi shingra ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the construction of ziggurats (ancient Mesopotamian temple towers).** It mentions the use of mud bricks (poi lamang ni) and the need for a sturdy foundation.
* **Question Q asks about the material used to build the base of the ziggurats.** 
* **The passage explicitly states:** ""dai hpe dum sa ni gaw poi shingra, poi lamang ni hta dai hpara ni ra kadawn ai lam ni hpe la sa ya shajang ma ai."" which translates to ""The foundation was made of sun-dried mud bricks, and it was laid with a sloping path."" This directly refers to **poi shingra ni** (sun-dried mud bricks).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Poi lamang ni (Wet mud bricks):** While used, the passage emphasizes the *sun-dried* bricks for the base.
* **B: Myit kata chyoi pra ai lam (Sloping path of mud):** This describes a part of the construction but not the primary base material.
* **D: Hkin chyang langchyi ni (Firm sloping foundation):** This is a description of the *result* of the construction, not the *material* used to build the base.



Therefore, **Poi shingra ni (Sun-dried mud bricks)** is the most accurate answer."
Hkawhkam Tutankhamun gaw mying gumhkawng lam galoi lu la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shi a lup bai mu tam la ai shaloi (He was found in a largely intact state)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lup law law hpe lagu la nga ai laman ndai lup gaw dingbai dingna nnga ai sha ngam taw nga ai. Manu dan ai gyu ni hte lung seng ni hte galaw da ai masha lang rung rai hkying hku lawm ai rai law malawng hpe Tutankhamun hta atsawm lup makoi da ai.""

This translates to: ""His tomb was discovered in a state that is largely understood by us.  Many valuable treasures, golden statues and other precious things that are loved by the people were found within Tutankhamun's tomb.""

This indicates the tomb was largely untouched and full of treasures. Option C, ""Shi a lup bai mu tam la ai shaloi,"" which means ""He was found in a largely intact state,"" accurately reflects this information.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi a lup damya hkrum ai shaloi (He was found in a damaged state):** The passage explicitly states the tomb was *not* damaged.
* **B: Shi mung up ai ten (He was found in a heap):** The passage indicates a well-preserved tomb, not a heap of rubble.
* **D: Moi na hkawhkam ni a mying hpe tsun dan ngut ai hpang (He was found in a place that was hidden from sight):** While the tomb was hidden for centuries, the passage focuses on its condition upon discovery, not its hiding place.



"
Hkawhkam Tutankhamun hpe Egypt ni a mying gumhkawng ai hkawhkam byin hkra hpa mabyin galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dingbai dingna n nga ai shi a lup hpe mu tam la ai lam (The fact that his tomb was discovered relatively intact)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Myit shang sha hpa gaw shi hpe moi prat na aten hta grai ahkyak ai Egypt hkaw hkam ni kaw na langai re. **Myit shang 1922 hta shi a lup hpe mu sawk tam ai gaw shi hpe masha law law hpe chye wa shangun ai.** Lup law law hpe lagu la nga ai laman ndai lup gaw dingbai dingna nnga ai sha ngam taw nga ai.""  This directly points to the intact discovery of the tomb as the reason for its fame and the knowledge it has provided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Moi na hkawhkam ni a jahpan hta nga ai shi a sat lawat a majaw (The fact that it is related to Japan and has a significant impact on us).** The text mentions Japan only in connection to a comparison of religious beliefs, not a direct link to the tomb's fame.
* **C: Shi a lup kaw na moi na arung arai hkying hku damya hkrum ai shaloi (The significance of the items found in the tomb).** While the items are significant, the *reason* for the tomb's overall fame isn't solely due to the individual artifacts, but the discovery of the tomb itself.
* **D: Moi na Egypt prat hta na shi a lak lai ai lam (The fact that it is related to the pharaohs of Egypt).**  Being a pharaoh's tomb is a factor, but the *intact* discovery is the key aspect highlighted in the text as contributing to its fame.



"
Greek ga shagawp ka sara Homer gaw hpa hpe n lu di ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lam hkawm ai**.

The text states: ""Greek masha langai mi gaw shi a mying gumhkawng ai man masum jut a la hkra maga man ni matut mahkai ai lam ni hte seng nna shaleng dan ai gashawn ni a majaw law malawng e chye lai wa ai sawn hpan hpaji ninghking Pythagoras re nga ai.""  This translates to: ""The Greek literary masters, who were full of intelligence and sharp insight, followed the path of wisdom and were also influenced by the teachings of Pythagoras.""  Homer is presented as part of this group of literary masters and followed the ""path of wisdom"" (lam hkawm ai).  Therefore, Homer was considered to follow a path of wisdom.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na ai** (Yes) - While Homer was influential, the text doesn't directly state a simple ""yes"" to a question about his origins.
*   **B: Mu ai** (No) -  The text doesn't state that Homer *wasn't* influenced by a path of wisdom.
*   **D: Ga shaga ai** (A kind of/sort of) - This doesn't accurately reflect the depth of Homer's influence and the connection to ""wisdom"" described in the passage.



"
Mying gumhkawng ai gara Greek masha gaw laili laika hta nre sha gara kaw grau mying gumhkawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Homer**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Greek laili laika hta reng dik ai ga shagawp lahkawng: Iliad hte Odyssey hpe shagawp da ai mying gumhkawng ai myi nmu ga shagawp sara re."" This translates to: ""The most famous Greek lyric poets are Homer, whose Iliad and Odyssey are the most famous works of epic poetry.""

Therefore, Homer is specifically mentioned as a major figure in Greek lyric poetry and is associated with epic poetry. While the other options are important figures in Greek literature and philosophy, the passage directly links Homer to the most famous works of Greek lyric poetry.
"
Hebre dinghku ni gaw shanhte a aten hpe gara shara kaw grau nna shama ma ai kun?,"The correct answer is **D: Nta kata hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hebrei dinghku nta masha ni a prat nkau gaw gangbang kata hpaw byin lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""The Hebrew language's beautiful words are born from the words of you.""  Therefore, the Hebrew language is born *from* the speaker's words.  ""Nta kata hta"" means ""from your words.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nbung katsi lu ai shara (The sound of the wind):** The passage doesn't mention the wind.
* **B: Lam ntsa (The road):** The passage doesn't mention a road.
* **C: Nta hpang hta (From your thoughts):** While thoughts might influence words, the passage specifically emphasizes the *words* themselves as the source of the language's beauty.

Therefore, the most accurate translation of the passage's meaning regarding the origin of the Hebrew language is ""from your words,"" making **D** the correct answer."
Hebre dinghku ni a matu gara gaw nau n ahkyak ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shanhte a seng ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Num ni gaw nta hpang kaw shat shadu ma ai; **seng ni gaw lam maga de yawng nna hpaw da ai.**""

This translates to: ""Good days don't make one happy and sad; **bad days make one strong.**"" 

Therefore, the Hebrew days that make one strong are the ""seng ni"" (bad days).
"
Scandinavian mungdan ni lapran shai ai lam hpe npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw n tang madun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Labau**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the geographic location of Scandinavian countries. The text states: ""Scandinavian mungdan ni lapran shai ai lam hpe npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw n tang madun da ai rai?"" which translates to ""The countries that are part of the Scandinavian region are: Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.""  The word ""labau"" means ""are"" or ""is"" in this context, directly answering the question.

The other options don't fit:

* **Lamu ga:** ""The path of..."" - This doesn't make sense in the context of listing countries.
* **Htung lai:** ""Although/However"" - This indicates a contrast, not a description of the countries.
* **Masha:** ""Rich/Prosperous"" - This describes a characteristic, not the location of the countries.
"
Greenland hta kadai shawng nga wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Eskimo bawsang ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mungdan shagu """"""Scandinavian"""""""" re tim, Denmark, Sweden, Norway hte Iceland ni a labau, htung lai, hkaw hkam ni, masha ni hta nbung ai hku grai law nga lai wa sai. Eskrimo bawsang grup ni gaw dai aten kaw na dai shara kaw nga wa sai re.""  This translates to: ""In the past, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland were united, but later, they were separated into countries, with Eskimo tribes also being able to travel and trade.""

Therefore, Eskimo tribes are mentioned as groups who were able to travel and trade, indicating their presence in Greenland. The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Norway masha ni** - While Norway is mentioned as part of the historical Scandinavian countries, it's not the answer to *who* Greenlanders traded with/interacted with.
*   **C: Erik the Red** - He is mentioned as a historical figure who explored Greenland, but not as a group of people Greenlanders traded with.
*   **D: Swidin amyu sha ni** - Sweden is mentioned as part of the historical Scandinavian countries, but not as a group of people Greenlanders traded with/interacted with.



"
Gara uhpung gaw shana shat sha yang lahkum lang ai hpe grau ra sharawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Matsan ai Roma num ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shai ai lam laga langai gaw matsan ni dum lahkum kaw dung nna num ni hte shanhte lusha sha taw ai ten...""  This translates to: ""The evil path, which is full of corruption and greed, will lead the souls of the righteous to the treacherous paths of evil...""  And later, ""Ga shadawn, shanhte gaw hkai nu, ba hkyi si, kala nai (sh) ku ku si hpe nchyam yu ga ma ai, moi na Roma ni mung u magwi hpe galoi nshadu sha ga ma ai."" This means ""Furthermore, the righteous are courageous, honorable, and do not suffer from the evil spirit, and do not turn to the wickedness of the Roma people.""

The passage consistently associates the ""Roma people"" (Roma ni) with negativity, evil, corruption, and treacherous paths.  Therefore, the ""evil path"" (shai ai lam) is connected to the ""matsan ai Roma num ni"" (corrupt Roma people).
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Moi na Roma ni a lusha poi hte n seng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Matsan ai manam ni hpe shana shat sha ai hta shadung ai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ga shadawn, shanhte gaw hkai nu, ba hkyi si, kala nai (sh) ku ku si hpe nchyam yu ga ma ai, moi na Roma ni mung u magwi hpe galoi nshadu sha ga ma ai.""

This translates to: ""Also, the Shan people are not ambitious, not overly eager, and do not seek power; they do not seek to control the territory or the wealth of Rome.""

The question asks why the Shan people's influence didn't extend to Rome. The text implies it's due to their lack of ambition and desire for power (Matsan ai manam ni hpe shana shat sha ai hta shadung ai).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hkoi ni a sha mu hkun ai tsi:** This translates to ""They are not allowed to have their own leaders."" While there might have been leadership structures, the text doesn't directly connect the lack of leaders to the limited influence on Rome.
* **C: Shana shat sha ten galeng taw ai lusu la ni:** This translates to ""They are too eager to fight."" The text states they are *not* eager to fight, directly contradicting this option.
* **D: U magwi shadu bang da ai n-gawt:** This translates to ""They are too afraid of the strong."" The text doesn't mention fear of powerful entities as a reason for limited influence.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw akyu grai na hkra nga na matu mahkoi nre ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Htung hking kaji**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the Roman concept of ""civitas"" (civil society).** It explains that it refers to a community of citizens who are united by shared laws, customs, and a sense of belonging.  It emphasizes the importance of law and order, and the role of the state in maintaining stability.
* **The question asks what could lead to the decline of this ""matsing masat"" (civil society).**  The passage explicitly states that ""Htung hking kaji ni gaw labau sakse hte seng ai lam ni hpe nngam ai sha jahkring hkring mat hkrum ai hte grin ai htunghking masa kaba hku na matsing masat ai lam nlu ma ai.""  This translates to: ""The decline of the state can be caused by the corruption and abuse of power, and the disregard for the laws that uphold the civil society.""

Therefore, corruption and abuse of power (represented by ""Htung hking kaji"" - the decline of the state/government) is the most logical answer to the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhpung uhpawng (The people's power):** While popular movements *can* influence the state, the passage doesn't directly link popular power to the *decline* of civil society. It focuses on corruption within the state itself.
* **C: Mare rapdaw (The nobility):** The passage doesn't specifically mention the nobility as a cause of decline. While their actions could contribute, it's not the primary focus.
* **D: Prat dep shinggyim hpawng htunghking masa (The power of the military):** The passage mentions the state's role in upholding laws and stability, but it doesn't explicitly state that the military's power would be a cause of decline. It emphasizes corruption within the state itself.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan langai a matu hpa gaw ningshawng re ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Htung hking kaji ni (City-states)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the development of civilization, starting from small communities and progressing to more complex societies. It mentions the rise of ""tung hking masa ni"" (city-states) as a key element in this evolution.  The passage states that city-states are formed when people come together for defense and to establish a common authority, and they become the basis for further societal development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Prat dep shinggyim hpawng htunghking masa (Early agricultural communities):** While important, these are a *precursor* to city-states, not the answer to *what enables* city-states to form.
*   **B: Htung hking langai (Small villages):** Similar to A, villages are a step before city-states.
*   **C: Mare rapdaw (Empires):** Empires are a *later* stage of civilization, built *upon* city-states.



Therefore, the passage directly links the formation and sustenance of city-states to their defensive capabilities and common authority, making **Htung hking kaji ni (City-states)** the logical and correct answer.
"
Drukgyal Dzong a lam hte seng na gara ndau lam gaw n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw Tibetan-Mongol hpyen dap ni a majan dang ai lam hpe poi galaw ai na mat gap da ai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that in 1649, Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built Drukgyal Dzong to halt the invasion of Tibetan-Mongol forces.  The Dzong was strategically placed to block their advance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai gaw Bhutan hta nga ai:** While Drukgyal Dzong is in Bhutan, this doesn't explain *why* it was built.
* **C: Ninghkap hpung a sali wunli ni grai law hpe wan gaw jahten kau ya ai:** This refers to the invasion itself, not the Dzong's purpose.
* **D: Dai hpe Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel galaw da ai re:** While Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel commissioned the building, the reason for its construction is explained by the threat it was meant to address.



"
Drukgyal Dzong shara hta byin ai wan hkru ai lam a mahtai hpe gara ndau lam gaw teng ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel a sumla langai sha sali wunli hku nna ngam ai.**

Here's why:

The passage states that in 1951, a flood washed away the foundation of Drukgyal Dzong, which was built on the site of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's original encampment (sumla). This directly explains the reason for the damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tibetan-Mongol hpyen dap ni gaw awngdang lam lu ma ai:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about this.
* **C: Dai gaw gumhkawng ai lam hpe gaw akyu n hkra ya ai:** The passage doesn't mention anything about this.
* **D: Dai hpe Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel makawp maga da ai:** While Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel is central to the story, the passage doesn't explicitly state that he *caused* the flood. It just says the Dzong was built on his encampment and subsequently damaged by a flood.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara ndau lam gaw Cambodia hte seng na jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Cambodia gaw tsaban 18 shawng daw hta Vietnam ni a shang gasat ai lam hpe hkrum sha ai**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tsa ban 18 jahtum na shaning ni hta Vietnam gaw Cambodia de hpyen n-gun hte shang gasat ai."" This translates to ""In the 18th century, Vietnam invaded and occupied Cambodia.""
* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""Cambodia gaw tsaban 18 shawng daw hta Vietnam ni a shang gasat ai lam hpe hkrum sha ai"" translates to ""Cambodia was occupied by Vietnam in the 18th century.""
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Vietnam amyu ni gaw Phnom Phen hpe jahten kau ai:**  While Vietnam did occupy Phnom Penh, the passage says this happened *in the 18th century*, not that it was the defining event.
    * **B: 1772 hta Cambodia ni gaw Thailand hpe shang gasat ai:** The passage focuses on Vietnam, not Thailand.
    * **D: Thai ni gaw Phnom Phen hpe jahten kau ai:** This is incorrect because the passage states Vietnam occupied Phnom Penh.



Therefore, option C is the only one accurately supported by the provided passage."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara ndau lam gaw Cambodia a shang gasat ai lam hpe jaw ai hku tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Vietnam ni gaw Cambodia hpe grai lang htim gasat yu ai (Vietnam was the last to invade Cambodia)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Thailand invaded Cambodia first in the 18th century. 
* Then, Vietnam invaded Cambodia in the 18th century. 
* The question asks which country was the *last* to invade Cambodia.
* The text explicitly mentions Vietnam invading *after* Thailand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 1772 hta Thai ni hte Vietnam ni Cambodia hpe shang gasat ai (In 1772, both Thai and Vietnam invaded Cambodia)** - While the text mentions Vietnam's invasion in 1772, it doesn't explicitly say Thailand invaded in the same year.  It says Thailand invaded *earlier* in the 18th century.
* **C: Vietnam amyu ni gaw Phnom Phen hpe jahten kau ai (Vietnam's army besieged Phnom Phen)** -  While Vietnam besieged Phnom Phen, this isn't the primary answer to the question of which country was the last to invade.
* **D: Thai ni gaw Cambodia hpe grai lang shang gasat yu ai (Thai army was the last to invade Cambodia)** - The text clearly states that Vietnam invaded *after* Thailand.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Dutch East India Company initially came to Taiwan for trade (option A is incorrect).  The passage also details how the Dutch engaged with the indigenous people of Taiwan, including trading and sometimes forcing them into labor or even killing them (option C is partially correct, but option B is more comprehensive). Finally, the passage explains Taiwan's eventual handover to the Qing Dynasty and then to Japan, and finally to the Republic of China (option D is correct regarding the handover to Qing, but doesn't fully address the initial interaction with indigenous populations).

Option B accurately describes the interaction between the Dutch and the indigenous population of Taiwan: they engaged in trade, but also often resorted to violence and exploitation, demonstrating a disregard for the indigenous people's rights and well-being.
"
Shimonoseki ga shaka gaw gara hku hpang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shawng nnan na Sino-Japan Majan hta Japan ni hkrat sum ai shaloi** (The Sino-Japanese War resulted in Japan's victory).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Shaning 1895 hta Shawng Nnan Sino-Japan Majan (1894-1895) hta hkrat sum ai hpang, Qing asuya gaw Shimonoseki myit hkrum let mat htu nna Taiwan a awm dawm ahkang aya hpe Japan de ap kau ya mat nna dai zunlawng hpe shaning 1945 du hkra up hkang wa sai.""
* This translates to: ""In 1895, the Sino-Japanese War resulted in Japan's victory, and the Qing dynasty was forced to cede Taiwan and its surrounding islands to Japan, which Japan controlled until 1945.""
* Therefore, the victory in the Sino-Japanese War was the reason Japan gained control of Taiwan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Qing hkawhkam ni a npu e shara langai hku nna Taiwan ni a madang** (The Qing dynasty had a long-standing claim to Taiwan). While the Qing dynasty *did* have a claim, the passage doesn't say this was the *reason* Japan gained control.
* **C: Taiwan ni shanhte hte seng ai hka nu makau na shara hpe bai lu up hkang ai shaloi** (Japan's influence in Taiwan was based on the expulsion of other powers). The passage doesn't mention Japan expelling other powers to gain control.
* **D: Taiwan ntsa na Japan ni a ahkaw ahkang** (Taiwan was a territory of Japan). This is true *after* the Sino-Japanese War, but it doesn't explain *why* Japan gained control in the first place.



"
Dat jasat pH madang hpe gara hku shadawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dat jasat hta rawng ai Hydrogen ion ni a shadawn shadang.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai pH madang gaw chemical jep da ai kaw na Hydrogen (pH kata na H) ion kade lawm ai hpe madi madun ai."" (pH is a measure of the concentration of Hydrogen (H) ions in water.)

The question asks what causes a substance to have a pH value.  The passage directly links pH to the concentration of hydrogen ions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dat jasat gaw gara hku npawt nhpang re ai shing nrai et sit dat kade rawng ai** (Substances have a range of different types of compounds that contain the same raw materials.) - This is about the composition of substances, not the cause of pH.
* **B: Dat jasat hta myihprap la dat ni ade rawng ai** (Substances have a neutral state.) - While a neutral substance *has* a pH of 7, the passage doesn't say neutrality *causes* the pH. It says pH *is* the concentration of hydrogen ions.
* **D: Dat jasat hta myihprap yi dat ni kade lawm ai rai** (Substances have a concentration of basic compounds.) - This is about basicity, not pH. pH measures acidity/basicity, not just the concentration of basic substances.



"
Hydrogen ions kaw nna hpa hpe shawkau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Myihprap yi dat rawng ai shing mun ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai pH madang gaw chemical jep da ai kaw na Hydrogen (pH kata na H) ion kade lawm ai hpe madi madun ai. Hydrogen myihprap yi la dat banshi ni gaw shanhte a myihprap yi dat rawng ai shingmun ni hpe la kau hkrum ai myihprap la dat rawng ai shingmun ni rai nga ai.""

This translates to: ""pH is a chemical that is formed by the presence of Hydrogen (pH unit of H) ions.  The acid is formed by the concentration of the acidic group.""

Therefore, hydrogen ions are found in **acidic solutions**.
"
Npu e jaw da ai lam ni kaw nna hkanghkyi dabang hpe teng ai hku n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte kaw gwi hpung ni zawn sat lawat nga ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the reason why the ""Hkanghkyi ni"" (likely a type of traditional medicine or healer) is consulted. The text describes her skills:

* She heals with herbs and traditional remedies.
* She uses special chants and rituals.
* She is knowledgeable about the body and its ailments.
* She can communicate with the spirits.

Option A, ""Shanhte kaw gwi hpung ni zawn sat lawat nga ai"" translates to ""They consult the Hkanghkyi ni when a serious illness affects the body."" This aligns perfectly with the description of her abilities and the context of needing a healer for significant health problems.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ala hte ayi na ruk gaw maren n re ai** - ""Ala and Ayi are fighting."" This is unrelated to seeking medical help.
* **C: Ayi hte ala ni gaw yawng matut mahkai lam nga ai** - ""Ayi and Ala are on a journey."" This is also unrelated to seeking medical help.
* **D: dai hkanghkyi ni gaw si chye nna uhpung hte nga ai** - ""The Hkanghkyi ni is a simple person and lives humbly."" While this describes her character, it doesn't explain *why* people consult her.



Therefore, option A is the most logical answer based on the provided text.



"

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks: ""What do the Shan people consider to be a good way to welcome guests and make them comfortable?""
* **The passage (P)** describes how the Hkanghkyi people (a subgroup within the Shan people) treat guests. It mentions:
    *  Welcoming guests with a warm greeting.
    *  Offering the best food and drink.
    *  Not being overly concerned with the guest's status.
    *  Providing a comfortable place to sleep.
    *  Offering a gentle massage to relieve fatigue.

* **Option C** directly reflects this information by stating that Shan people (including the Hkanghkyi) offer a comfortable place to sleep and a gentle massage to guests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte gaw uhpung hku nga chye ai (Shan people are good at welcoming guests).** While true, it's a general statement and doesn't pinpoint the specific actions described in the passage.
* **B: shanhte a akyang ni gaw ga gwi ni a akyang ni hte mai shingdaw yu ai (The Shan people's kind guest is respectful and doesn't act presumptuously).** This focuses on the guest's behavior, not the host's actions.
* **D: Shanhte a akyang ni gaw kaga ngau kaba ni hte mung bung ai (The Shan people's kind guest is wealthy and generous).** This focuses on the guest's wealth, which isn't mentioned in the passage as a determining factor in how guests are treated.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer because it reflects the welcoming actions described in the passage about the Hkanghkyi people (who are a part of the Shan people)."
Brangtai ni gaw gara a matu ashu shan rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Grai kaba ai nyau ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpang chyhtum hta, dai kaw nyau kasha ni grai law wa ai (nta kaw rem ai nyau ni lawm ai) dai ni gaw insect, yu, tak te hte u ni zawn akawng ni hpe chye sha ma ai.""  This translates to: ""In the morning, the animal that is active (and also the animal that is also strong) is not preyed upon by insects, birds, snakes, and other small animals.""

Therefore, ""grai kaba ai nyau ni"" (the animal that is strong) refers to the type of animal that is *not* preyed upon by other animals in the morning.  The question asks about the type of animal that is *not* preyed upon.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna nyau kasha ni gaw gara wa hpe gyam ma ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Gawa atup sha chye ai dusat**.

Here's why:

The question asks what prevents the ""kaw nna nyau kasha ni"" (the kind of sticky substance/glue) from being able to stick.  The text states: ""Hpang chyhtum hta, dai kaw nyau kasha ni grai law wa ai (nta kaw rem ai nyau ni lawm ai) dai ni gaw insect, yu, tak te hte u ni zawn akawng ni hpe chye sha ma ai."" which translates to ""However, the kind of sticky substance (that is also sticky) cannot stick to insects, wood, water, or other living things.""  This suggests that the sticky substance is prevented from sticking by something that *repels* it.

The text then says: ""Shanhte na awng dang ai lam a ahkyak lamyi gaw kaja ai bungli shagu gaw kaga ni hte lu shingjawng ai ngu ai sut masa myit jasat rai nga ai."" which translates to ""The shiny, smooth surface of the beetle's body is covered with a layer of slime that prevents it from being stuck to other things.""

Therefore, the slime (dusat) is what prevents the sticky substance from sticking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Brangtai (Wood):** The text says the sticky substance *cannot* stick to wood, not that wood prevents sticking.
* **C: Shat nga ni (Sand):** The text says the sticky substance *cannot* stick to sand, not that sand prevents sticking.
* **D: Zau nyi (Water):** The text says the sticky substance *cannot* stick to water, not that water prevents sticking.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na ocelot nyau ni a shan hkwi ladat n re ai gaw gara wa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte a grupyin hkan hpyen wa n chye hkra makoi nga ai**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hpungtang hpaji ninghkring ni myit ai lam gaw hkan ni gaw shanhte hte sha na dusat dumyeng (ashu ashan) ni hpe bat manam ai hku, shanhte hte gara ga hkan nga lai wa ai hpe ladi ashut nna hkan nna tam la ai re.""  This translates to: ""The path of the tree with a thick trunk and vines that climb is a place where the enemy's (the ocelot's prey) are hunted and gathered. The ocelots and the dogs will chase after the prey and kill them, and they will eat a lot.""  This indicates the ocelots hunt *together as a group*.

* **Option A directly reflects this:** ""Shanhte a grupyin hkan hpyen wa n chye hkra makoi nga ai"" translates to ""The ocelots hunt together in groups.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanhte a ashu shan ni a sama hpangde hkan nang ai** - This means ""The ocelots hunt by themselves, chasing the prey."" This contradicts the passage which explicitly mentions them hunting *together*.
* **C: Shanhte a ashu shan hpang de shana e hkan ai** - This means ""The ocelots hunt by themselves, chasing the prey."" Again, it contradicts the group hunting behavior described.
* **D: Kaji ai ashu sham ni hpe sha gyam chye ma ai** - This means ""The ocelots don't eat the prey they hunt."" This is directly contrary to the passage which says they *do* eat the prey.



Therefore, **A** is the only option supported by the given text.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw ocelot nyau a lam hpe jaw ai hku n tsun da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **D: Shanhte gaw kaji ai ashu shan hpe sha gyam mayu ma ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ocelot is hunting the deer. It also says that the deer is scared and tries to escape, running away. The passage further describes how the deer's heart beats quickly and its legs tremble.  

Option D directly reflects this: ""The deer's heart is pounding, and it runs away."" The passage emphasizes the deer's fear and frantic escape, which is best captured by the phrase ""kaji ai ashu shan hpe sha gyam mayu ma ai"" (heart pounding and running away).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte gaw shana e shan atsawm sha gyam lu ai (The deer is not running towards the mountain):** The passage explicitly states the deer is *running away*, implying it is not headed *towards* the mountain.
* **B: Shanhte gaw sumnung ai hku shamu shamawt lu ai (The deer is not eating the grass):** The passage focuses on the deer fleeing from the predator, not on its eating habits.
* **C: Shanhte a manam lu ai atsam gaw yawm ai (The deer's favorite food is growing):** This is irrelevant to the hunting scenario.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa hpe sharaw a ja dik ai n-gun ngu na n mai myit la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Marawm shabam ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sharaw a marawn shabam ai gaw hkanghkyi a marawn shabam ai zawn grai hpring nlu marawn ai raitim nying ahkre ai, marawn ai ga si ni gaw grau nga ai.""  This translates to: ""The roaring of a male tiger is loud, and the area where it roars is a very dense forest, and the roar is very powerful.""

Therefore, the roar of a male tiger (marawn shabam ai) is what is mentioned as being able to scare away the other animals. The other options don't accurately reflect what the text describes.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, sharaw hte hkanghkyi a shai ai lam ni gaw gara wa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shanhte a marawn shabam lu ai atsam** (The cat's prey is not the buffalo).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sharaw gaw hkanghkyi, rawngteng hte sinna rawngteng zawn sha amyu hpan langai (Genus Panthera) sha re. Ndai nyau myu mali hte sha marawn shabam chye ma ai. Sharaw a marawn shabam ai gaw hkanghkyi a marawn shabam ai zawn grai hpring nlu marawn ai raitim nying ahkre ai, marawn ai ga si ni gaw grau nga ai.""

This translates to: ""The leopard is a member of the (Genus Panthera) family. It doesn't eat small animals or livestock. The leopard's prey is primarily medium-sized animals, and when it kills prey, it usually eats the liver and heart.""

Therefore, the leopard *doesn't* eat buffalo, as stated in option B. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage describes the leopard's hunting behavior and prey preferences, not what it eats.
"
"Matsing matsat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Robert Hooke gaw kaga nsoi hpaji ninghkrin ni hta hpa shawng di wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Sak hkrung kanu ni hpe yu na matu microscope pat hpe lang ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""England mungdan na nsoi hpaji ninghkring Robert Hooke gaw microscope pat nhpai hte yu nna, matsut hta man bung lawk kaji ni hpe mu lu ai.""  This translates to: ""The famous English scientist Robert Hooke, after inventing the microscope, observed tiny, small cells.""

Option B directly reflects this:  Robert Hooke observed the cells using the microscope he invented.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Si mat ai cell ni hpe sawk tam ai** (He observed the cells in the flesh): While Hooke observed cells in various tissues, the passage specifically links his observation to the use of the microscope.
* **C: Lawk kaji hpe sawk tam ai** (He observed large cells): The passage says he observed *tiny* cells.
* **D: Sak hkrung kanu ni a kaji dik ai galaw hkawm sa ai lam ni hpe sawk tam ai** (He observed the areas where cells were growing and dividing): The passage doesn't mention Hooke observing cell division.



"
Cell ngu ai gasi a n pawt lachyum gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Gawk kaji (Gawk kaji)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cell ga si gaw Latin ga kaw na sa wa nna de lachyum gaw gawk kaji ngu ai re."" This translates to: ""Cells are named in Latin and are made of small compartments (gawk kaji).""

Therefore, the passage explicitly says cells are made of small compartments, which are referred to as ""gawk kaji"" in the text.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta ka da ai hte maren, dusat ni malawng hta hpa galaw lu na atsam nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shamu shamawt ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dusat ni malawng gaw shamu shamawt chye ma ai."" This translates to ""Dusat ni malawng cannot be eaten/consumed.""

The question asks what the dusat ni malawng does *not* do.  Since the passage says it cannot be eaten, the correct answer is that it **shamu shamawt ai** (cannot be eaten).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pyen ai** (can be brewed): The passage doesn't mention brewing.
* **C: Hka hpung yawt ai** (can be used for medicine): The passage doesn't mention medicinal uses.
* **D: Ga htu ai** (can be cooked): The passage explicitly states it cannot be eaten/consumed.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai hte maren, nkau dusat ni hta hpa n nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bawnu ni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dusat ni hta sha bawnu rawng ai..."" which translates to ""Dusat ni is colored with bawnu (a specific color)."" The question asks what color dusat ni is. Therefore, ""Bawnu ni"" (bawnu color) is the direct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Cell ni:** The text doesn't mention cell ni.
*   **B: Shat rin atsam:** The text doesn't mention shatter red.
*   **D: Sha na atsam:** The text doesn't mention Sha na atsam.



"
Jan kaw hpun lusha shabyin ai ladat hte galaw ai lam hta hpun ni hpe hpa gaw karum ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shingnip shingna**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shanhte gaw shingnip hpe ma shapraw ya nga ai. Anhte ni gaw anhte a nta ni hpe hpun ni rau galaw la ai re nna labu hpun palawng ni hpe mung hpun ni rau galaw la ai re.""  This translates to ""The air is purified by the forest.  The earth's breath, after being released, is consumed by the forest and the creatures that live there.""

This clearly indicates that the forest's purification (shingnip) is the reason why the earth's breath (carbon dioxide) is converted into breathable air (oxygen). Therefore, the answer is ""Shingnip shingna"" (forest purification).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dusat ni (Dusty air):** The passage focuses on purification, not the presence of dust.
* **C: Lusha (Lush):** While forests are often lush, the passage doesn't directly state that lushness *causes* the oxygen production. It's the forest's purification process.
* **D: Jan (People/Humans):** While people contribute to air pollution, the passage emphasizes the role of the forest.



"
Masha ni sa sharaw ai nsa hpe hpun ni gara hku chyup la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpun ni gaw shinggyim masha nsa sa na matu oxygen hpe shapraw ai, ngut nna masha nsa sa shapraw ai (dai gaw nsa sa shale ai lam) carbon-dioxide hpe shanhte bai nsa sa la ma ai.""

This translates to: ""The body takes oxygen to produce energy, and releases carbon dioxide (which is a waste product) into the air.""

Therefore, the passage directly links carbon dioxide to the process of being released by the body after oxygen is used.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai ga shadawn ni kaw na gara gaw galu gaba ai lam hpe pat shingdang ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Masha jahpan gaw hpang jahtum hta hpan hkawng byin wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the origin of Japanese macaques.** It explains how they were isolated on an island and evolved separately from other macaques.
* **Question Q asks about the reason for their unique characteristics and isolated location.**
* **Option D directly addresses this by stating that Japanese macaques evolved due to environmental pressures (hpang jahtum - forcing conditions) and isolation (hpan hkawng byin wa ai - separation/isolation).** This aligns perfectly with the passage's explanation of speciation driven by isolation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhpung kaji ai ni gaw shara nnan hta sak hkrung na matu hkrat sum ma ai (The ape's offspring do not have a habit of being afraid of strangers).** This is not directly supported by the passage. The passage focuses on their evolutionary isolation, not their behavior towards strangers.
* **B: Shara nnan de htawt mat wa ai masha jahpan langai a dawchyen (The Japanese macaque's island habitat is not very diverse).** While the passage mentions being isolated on an island, it doesn't explicitly state the habitat isn't diverse. The point is the isolation itself, regardless of habitat diversity.
* **C: Masha jahpan gaw shara nnan hta nga man na matu shaman ya ai (Japanese macaques are not worshipped as gods by the islanders).** This option is irrelevant to the question about their evolutionary origin and unique traits.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw speciation byin wa ai lam hpe teng ai hku ntsun da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **B: Dai gaw galu gaba ai lam a ahkyak ai ningmu re.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpang jahtum gaw, shaning hkying hku wan hku na ai hpang, masha jahpan nnan ni ppan lahkawng gaw amyu hpan bung ai ngu nmai tsun mat ai sha grau shai hkat mat na ra ai. Anhte shaga ai gaw speciation re, dai gaw myu nnan ni a ningpawt re. dai speciation ni gaw ayan byin nna galu gaba ai lam hta grai ahkyak ai re.""

Translation: ""In the meantime, the Japans' descendants, having been separated from each other, gradually evolved. This gradual evolution was speciation, which was a divergence of the species. This speciation was driven by the gradual divergence along the evolutionary path.""

This clearly indicates that speciation (the divergence into new species) occurred *because* of gradual divergence along an evolutionary path.  Option B directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai gaw masha jahpan nnan gaw grupyin nnan hta chye nga hkra n lu galaw ai rai yang byin ai** (It was that the Japans' descendants gradually evolved apart from each other). While this is partially true, it doesn't fully capture *how* that divergence led to speciation.
* **C: Dai gaw amyu hpan nnan byin wa ai lam hpe madi madun ya ai** (It was that the species diverged along the path of the common ancestor).  This is incorrect.  The divergence wasn't *along* the common ancestor's path; it was a subsequent divergence.
* **D: Dai byin ai lam gaw koi kau n mai ai lam re** (It was that the evolutionary path was not consistent). The passage actually suggests a *consistent* evolutionary path, albeit one that led to divergence.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer.



"
Sai gayin ai ladat hta gara wa gaw sai hpe salum de sa ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Sai lam ni**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where something (likely water) is being transported in tubes. It mentions tubes being ""cut"" and ""connected"" and flowing to a destination.  The question asks ""What is the path of the water (or whatever is being transported)?""

The passage explicitly states: ""Grai kaja ai tube ni hpe gaw kara zawn grai kaji ai sai lam ni ngu ai.""  This translates to ""The path of the tube, from the source to the destination, is a road.""  Therefore, the water's path is ""sai lam ni"" which means ""a road"" or ""a path/route"".



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sai dat lasa ni** - This translates to ""a straight road"" or ""a straight path"", which doesn't accurately reflect the description of tubes being connected and flowing.
* **B: Kara zawn san ai lasa ni** - This translates to ""a beautiful mountain road"", which is irrelevant to the passage.
* **C: Gindai ni** - This translates to ""a ground road"" or ""a land road"", also not the correct answer based on the context of tubes.



"
Gara tingrat gaw sai gayin ai ladat a kaji dik ai wa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Sai lam ni**.

Here's the breakdown of the question and answer:

* **P (Question):** This describes a situation where someone is going to a certain place (likely a town or village - indicated by ""gaiin ya ai gaw salum re"") and wants to go to another place (likely a specific house - indicated by ""dsai hpe tu ya ai re""). It then describes the path:  going to a tube/pipe (maybe a road or path), then following a certain direction (""hkawm mat ai hpe sai dat lasa ngu tsun nna tube kata hku salum de bai wa ai hpe sai ginhtan lasa ngu tsun ai""). Finally, it mentions that the path leads to a certain location (""Grai kaja ai tube ni hpe gaw kara zawn grai kaji ai sai lam ni ngu ai"").

* **Q (Question):**  ""Gara tingrat gaw sai gayin ai ladat a kaji dik ai wa rai?"" translates to ""What is the most important path that is walked through?"" or ""Which path is the most crucial/important one for walking through?"".

* **A: Kara zawn san ai lasa ni** - ""The path that goes to the well.""  This is a possible path, but not necessarily the most crucial *for the overall journey described in P*.
* **B: Sai dat lasa ni** - ""The path that goes to the dat (a specific location)."" Similar to A, it's a potential path, but doesn't fit the general importance question.
* **C: Sai lam ni** - ""The path that goes to the lam (a road/path)."" This aligns best with the journey described in P. The path involves following a ""tube/pipe"" which could be a road, and the overall journey is about traveling *along* a path.
* **D: Gindai ni** - ""The path that goes to the gindai (a specific location).""  Like A & B, it's a possible path but not the most crucial.



Therefore, **C: Sai lam ni** is the most logical answer because the description in P heavily implies traveling *along a road/path* is the core of the journey.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw shingtai sumpra ni a singkaw bai zing ai atsam hpe jat ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shara makoi ai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how Shingtai sumpra ni (probably a type of insect or creature) lays eggs on the undersides of leaves. It then explains that the larvae (masha ni kaw na makoi) eat and consume the leaves, leaving only the veins (shara ni a grau dam). Therefore, the larvae consume the leaf's veins (shara makoi ai).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Lusha madi shadaw ai** (Consuming the whole leaf): The passage states the larvae only eat the leaves, leaving the veins.
*   **C: Manang tam ai** (Eating a lot): While the larvae do eat a lot, the question asks *what* they eat, not *how much*.
*   **D: Pyen ai lam a chyang shadang** (Eating the outer layer): The passage focuses on the veins (shara) being consumed.

Therefore, **Shara makoi ai** (Eating the veins) is the most accurate answer.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na hpa gaw shingtai sumpra ni a pyen lu ai lam a majaw akyu nga ai lam hpe matsing masat ga yan hta n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lusha mahkawng ai (The Lusha River)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the Shingtai Sumpra river becomes polluted due to human activities upstream. It specifically mentions that the pollution originates from waste and runoff from the **Lusha River**.  The passage states ""Dai ni na prat hta, shanhte na singkaw hpe nlu ginyawp ai hkrung kanu hpan ni gaw hka dingsen ni hte mayfly ngu ai hkrung kanu ni sha re sai."" (Therefore, the water quality of the downstream area is degraded, and the water becomes dark, with mayflies dying.) This degradation is linked to pollution from the Lusha River.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shangai shaprat ai lam (Shanghai's sewage):** The passage doesn't mention Shanghai or its sewage.
* **B: Asak ladaw (Asak's river):**  There is no information in the passage about Asak or its river.
* **D: Tsam rawng ai lam (The road of Tsam):** The passage mentions roads leading to the river, but it's the *runoff from activities on those roads, originating from the Lusha River*, that causes the pollution, not the road itself.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw dinosaur ni hte n seng ai laklai ai kumla rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hpang lagaw hte hkawm ai (Sharp teeth and claws)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ngut nna shanhte gaw T-Rex ni zawn hpang lagaw lahkawng hte lam hkawm ma ai.""  This translates to ""...the teeth and claws of the T-Rex were very sharp and powerful.""

Therefore, the description of sharp teeth and claws directly relates to the question of what enabled dinosaurs to hunt.  The other options are not supported by the passage:

*   **B: Amun nga ai (Big size)** - While some dinosaurs were large, the passage doesn't specifically connect size to hunting ability.
*   **C: Di di ai (Strong legs)** - Strong legs are important for running, but the passage doesn't focus on leg strength as a hunting tool.
*   **D: Lagaw lamyin nga ai (Hard scales)** - Hard scales are about protection, not directly about hunting.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw nna dinosaur ni hte u ni a n bung ai laklai ai kumla ngu nna gara wa hpe n mai sawn la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hpang lagaw lahkawng lang na lam hkawm ai (Extinct due to a sudden cataclysm)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that dinosaurs disappeared because of a ""tsunami"" (ngut nsun) and ""a large impact"" (majaw nga yang). This implies a catastrophic event. Option B, ""Extinct due to a sudden cataclysm,"" accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di di ai (Gradually)** - The passage doesn't suggest a gradual decline. It mentions a sudden event (tsunami and impact).
* **C: Pyen lu ai atsam lu ai (Disappeared slowly)** - Similar to A, this contradicts the idea of a sudden disappearance.
* **D: Lamyin lawm ai lagaw (Gradual evolution)** - This refers to evolution, not extinction due to a specific event.

Therefore, option B is the only one that aligns with the information provided in the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Triceratop gaw cycad a gara daw hpe sha ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hpun mat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Triceratop ni gaw dai hpun mat hpe nsha shi yang alap ni hpe shi ngup masen hte yeng kau lu ai."" This translates to ""Triceratops' horns were used for defense and fighting, and they were also used to attack with the head.""

Therefore, Triceratops used its **horns** to attack cycads.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna Triceratop gara ni hpe ra sha ai rai? ","The correct answer is **D: Gung rawng ai asi si ai hpun (Sharp horns)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Triceratop ni gaw dai hpun mat hpe nsha shi yang alap ni hpe shi ngup masen hte yeng kau lu ai.

This translates to: ""Triceratops used its horns for defense and attacking.  The frill on its head was also sharp and could be used to fight (when facing another Triceratops).  The sharp horns on the frill were used to attack and defend, and when facing another Triceratops, it would charge and clash horns.""

Therefore, the sharp horns were a key defensive and offensive feature of the Triceratops.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna Itali mung dingdung de nga ai mungdaw ni hta gara ginsup hpan gaw grau nna gumhkawng ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lata bawlung (Weightlifting)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Italy mungdan masha ni hpe yu yang mungkan ting shingjawng ai ginsup lamang ni, Olympic ginsup poi ni hkan grai shang lawm ai hpe mu lu ai.""  This translates to: ""Italy has traditionally won many Olympic medals, and has frequently participated in Olympic games.""

The passage then lists various sports Italy excels in.  The question asks which of those sports is related to ""matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw nna Itali mung dingdung de nga ai mungdaw ni hta gara ginsup hpan gaw grau nna gumhkawng ai rai?"" This describes a sport involving lifting heavy weights.

Of the options provided, **Lata bawlung (Weightlifting)** is the sport that fits this description. The other options are:

*   **A: Bawlung (Volleyball)** - Involves hitting a ball over a net.
*   **C: Hkyen jawn ai (Hockey)** - Played on ice with sticks and a puck.
*   **D: F1 mawdaw gau shingjawng ai (F1 racing)** -  A motor sport.

Therefore, Lata Bawlung (Weightlifting) is the only one fitting the given description.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Italy a myu sha gawdin hpung gaw 2006 hta FIFA Mungkan Kumhpa Gawm ninghkring re nna de a hpang gaw Germani myu sha gawding uhpung gaw mungkan hta nambat lahkawng awngdang dik hpung re ma ai."" This translates to: ""Italy's gymnastics team won the 2006 FIFA World Cup and Germany's team's performance was not very good."" The passage then lists various sports Italy has excelled in.

The question asks *which* of the listed sports Italy has won the World Cup in, *besides* football (implied by the first sentence). The passage directly mentions ""gawdin"" (gymnastics) as a sport Italy has won a World Cup in (the 2006 FIFA World Cup - a typo, it should be the FIFA World *Championship*).

The other options are mentioned as sports Italy has participated in and performed well in, but the passage doesn't explicitly state they won a World Cup in those sports.

Therefore, **Gawdin (Gymnastics)** is the only option directly supported by the text."
Gara mabyin ngut ai hpang Luxembourg a nkau daw chyen ni gaw Belgian byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Belgian Revolution hpang**.

The text states: ""Belgium na ya aten ni gaw Luxembourg na moi na aten ni re raitim Belgian gaw shaning 1830 Belgian Revolution hpang byin wa ai re.""  This translates to: ""Belgium at that time was a protectorate of Luxembourg, but then Belgium was liberated by the Belgian Revolution in 1830.""

Npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw Luxembour a wahkrang nga masa hpe hkra machyi shangun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: German ni a up hkang ai lam (The path of being under German rule)**.

The passage states: ""Luxembourg gaw galoi mung ka-ang ai mungdan langai hku nga shakut ai, raitim Mungkan Majan I hte Mungkan Majan II hta gaw Germany ni shi hpe aup hkang wa sai.""  This translates to: ""Luxembourg, as a small country, was under the influence of neighboring countries, but it was under German rule under Kings Jean I and Jean II.""

Therefore, the question asks about the reason for Luxembourg's historical influence, and the passage directly identifies German rule as a key factor. The other options are either incorrect or not the primary reason for its influence.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Turkey gaw mile kade ram galu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Turkey madu ai ginwang ni gaw 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) galu nna 800 km (500 mi) hta grau dam nga nna rectangular hkrang zawn rai nga ai."" This translates to ""Turkey's width is 1,600 kilometers (1,000 mi) long and 800 km (500 mi) wide."" The question asks about the distance Turkey is long (galu nna), which is 1600 kilometers or 1000 miles.

Vatican mare kaba hta Latin ga hpe hpa na matu jai lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nawku htung hte seng ai poi ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vatican mare kaba kaw gaw Italy ga hpe shi a upadi ka lajang ai lam hte tara shang matut mahkai ai lam hta jai lang ai re. Mungdaw hta bungli galaw ai ni law malawng a matu Itali ga gaw shani shagu jai lang ai madung ga rai nna Latin ga hpe gaw nawku htung hte seng ai poi shingra hkan jai lang ma ai.""

This translates to: ""The language of the Vatican's court is the road of the road to the Pope's residence and the road to the area of the Vatican.  In the days of the old, Italy spoke of a strange and unusual language that was not understood or easily learned, and it was Latin.""

Therefore, the sentence directly says Latin was ""nawku htung hte seng ai poi ni,"" which means ""strange and unusual language that was not understood or easily learned.""  Option A accurately reflects this.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Shani shagu na matut mahkai lam** - This refers to the road to the Pope's residence, which is not the language itself.
*   **C: Tara upadi ka lajang ai lam** - This refers to the road to the Pope's residence, which is not the language itself.
*   **D: Tara shang matut mahkai lam** - This refers to the area of the Vatican, which is not the language itself.



"
"Vatican mare kaba hta, Italy ga hpe hpa na matu lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Tara shang matut mahkai lam**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Vatican mare kaba kaw gaw Italy ga hpe shi a upadi ka lajang ai lam hte **tara shang matut mahkai lam** hta jai lang ai re.""

This translates to: ""The Vatican's territory is surrounded by the **roads of the border** and the **roads of the outer area** of Italy.""  ""Tara shang matut mahkai lam"" refers to the roads of the outer area or border.



Therefore, option B is the accurate answer. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Tara upadi ka lajang ai lam** (roads of the immediate border) - While related, it doesn't fully capture the entirety of Italy's involvement in defining the Vatican's borders.
*   **C: Nawku htung hte seng ai poi ni** (Latin and the language not spoken) - This refers to the languages used, not the geographical boundaries.
*   **D: Shani shagu na matut mahkai lam** (roads of the shining/bright area) - This doesn't make sense in the context.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw prat dep kompyuta nsen shatsawm ai lam kaw nna akyu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Animination ladat ni** (Animation creation).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the process of creating animations on a computer?
* **The text describes:** Computers can create video animations.
* **Option B directly relates to this:** ""Animation ladat ni"" translates to ""Animation creation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yu ngwi** (Rain): This is unrelated to the topic.
* **C: Sumla ni** (Sumla - a type of clothing): This is also unrelated.
* **D: Gawgap ai lam** (The path of work/effort): While creating animations requires effort, this option doesn't specify the *process* of animation creation.



"
"Matsin masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara shara na nta law malawng hta namdum hka gang jahkrat ai baw lawm ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Mohenjo-daro as having connections and trade with various civilizations, including Crete (Minoan), Santorini, Egypt, Persia, and the Miwa people.  The question asks which city had these connections. Mohenjo-daro is explicitly mentioned as having such interactions. The other options are mentioned as *having* connections *with* Mohenjo-daro, not as being the city itself that had the connections.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara shara kaw madang tsaw namdum gawda hkrang hpe mu lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Harappa hte Mohenjo-daro a mare ni kaw gaw nta shagu ngu na daram hka gang namdum lu ma ai rai nna madang tsaw ai namdum galaw hpaji ladat hte galaw da ma ai."" This translates to: ""The maritime trade of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro was not limited to the Indus Valley; it also extended to lands beyond.""

The passage goes on to list other civilizations with which Harappa had trade: Crete, Minoan, Santorini, Egypt, Persia, and Mitanni.

The other options are mentioned as civilizations that *Harappa traded with*, but the question asks *which civilization had maritime trade beyond the Indus Valley*.  Harappa is the civilization directly described as having that type of trade.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw skate jawn ai wa hpe lu gayin hkun ai rai?,"The answer is **D: Hkyen pa madang (Wooden deck)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes someone who is deeply saddened (""lawm chye ai"") and troubled (""galau hkra"") by something. It then describes the appearance of their body: their skin is pale (""magaw taw ai majaw""), their breath is shallow and fast (""nhtu a lahkawng yan maga nchyan de""), and their chest is tight (""ndung gaw hkyen hte hkra taw ai majaw magaw taw nga ai"").  This paints a picture of someone with difficulty breathing and a weakened state.

The question asks what caused the person to ""skate"" (referring to their body or situation). The passage mentions ""hkyen pa madang"" (wooden deck) – which refers to the wooden deck of a skateboard. The description of the person's condition aligns with someone who has been physically exhausted and possibly even died due to a sudden, intense struggle or exertion. The ""hkyen pa madang"" being the cause suggests a very strenuous and possibly fatal action related to skating.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Skate nhtu npu hta nga ai kashawt ai baw magaw (The body is pale due to the skate's wood)** - This doesn't make logical sense. The wood of the skate wouldn't cause paleness.
* **B: Skate nhtu dingren a matu lahkawng (The person is troubled by the skate's other parts)** -  The passage focuses on the body's physical condition, not emotional troubles related to the skate's parts.
* **C: Skate jawn ai masha a kung kyang ai madang (The person is caused by the skate's wheels)** -  Wheels wouldn't be a cause of this physical state.



Therefore, **D: Hkyen pa madang (Wooden deck)** is the most plausible answer based on the given passage. It implies an extreme, possibly deadly physical action connected to skating."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, prat dep skate ni a nhtu ntsa kaw nga ai hku a lam hpe npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw jaw ai hku sanglang da ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Magaw**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a person experiencing emotional distress, characterized by:

* **""Lawm nna, shanhte a ka'ang hta e hku zawn re lawm chye ai""**: Feeling a deep longing and sadness.
* **""Hkyen pa ntsa e ding yau mat yang pi n galau hkra magra da ya lu ai""**:  Being deeply troubled and worried, constantly feeling anxious.
* **""Nhtu a htum pa maga gaw magaw taw ai majaw""**: The worries and troubles are persistent and overwhelming.
* **""Nhtu a lahkawng yan maga nchyan de, ndung gaw hkyen hte hkra taw ai majaw magaw taw nga ai""**:  The worries cloud the mind, and the body becomes weary and exhausted.

All these descriptions point to a state of **""Magaw"" (worries/anxiety)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nten-lahkawng (Loneliness)**: While loneliness can contribute to sadness, the passage focuses on persistent worries and anxiety, not simply feeling alone.
* **C: Lahkyawk (Jealousy)**: The passage doesn't mention feelings of envy or resentment towards others.
* **D: Ding yau ai (Exhaustion)**: Exhaustion is a *result* of the worries, not the core problem. The passage is describing the *cause* of the exhaustion.



Therefore, **Magaw (worries/anxiety)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, atom ni gaw ninghtoi kaw na jan pru wa ai dat atsam hpe shapraw kau ya lu ai ladatgaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: Rediyu dat shapraw ai lam hpe jasu alun ya ai**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that radio waves are a type of electromagnetic radiation. It also states that radio waves are produced when electrons move.  Radio receivers *detect* these radio waves.  

Let's break down the options:

*   **A: Rediyu dat n-gun pru ai:** (Radio waves are generated.) While true, the question asks *how* radio waves are detected.
*   **B: Photon ni shapraw ai lam hpe jasu alun ya ai:** (Detected by the path of photons.) Photons are the fundamental particles of electromagnetic radiation, but the question is about how the *waves* are detected.
*   **C: Photon:** (Photon) A photon is a particle of light/electromagnetic radiation, not the method of detection.
*   **D: Rediyu dat shapraw ai lam hpe jasu alun ya ai:** (Detected by the path of radio waves.) Radio receivers are designed to *receive* and interpret the radio waves. They are built to interact with the radio wave's frequency and amplitude.


Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer because it describes the function of a radio receiver."
Atom langai kaw na photon shapraw ai lam gaw gara hku byin ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Grai tu htoi ai nhtoi a majaw byin pru wa ai jasu alun ya ai lam** (It is the path where photons are scattered by the electrons around the nucleus).

Here's why:

The passage explains that photons are scattered by the ""lam hpe atom shapraw"" (the path of atom's light/structure).  It further mentions that photons ""galaw ai ri ni hta grau kaji ai re"" (are scattered by the movement of electrons).

Option B directly addresses this by stating that photons are scattered by the electrons orbiting the nucleus.  This is the fundamental interaction described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shajan dat atsam hpe shapraw ya ai** (Scattered by the outer matter).  While scattering can occur with outer matter, the passage emphasizes electrons within the atom.
*   **C: Zim n re ai dat n-gun madang ni** (Scattered by the inner matter). The passage doesn't use this terminology and focuses on electron interaction.
*   **D: Rediyu dat a matu akyu n jaw ai ginhtang** (By the radio wave's frequency and emission). This refers to radio waves themselves, not how photons interact with atoms.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the passage's explanation.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, hpa gaw hpang jahtum hta wan pu langai hpe bungli galaw hkring mat hkun mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Wan pu kata na waya sumri kaji ni hkru mat ai**.

Here's why:

* **P (The question)** describes a situation where someone is trying to move a phone, but it's stuck because the charging cable is tangled or obstructed.  The person is trying to untangle it, but it's difficult.
* **Q (The question)** asks *why* the phone won't move.
* **A: Wan pat shara hpe jaw ai hku n pat da ai** - This translates to ""The phone's body is touching the edge and is stuck."" While possible, it doesn't fully explain the problem described in P. The tangled cable is the more likely culprit.
* **B: Wan pu a gyu gaw socket hta daw chyen mi sha lawm ai** - This translates to ""The phone's back is not touching the socket."" This is irrelevant to the problem of the phone not being able to move.
* **C: Wan pu kata na waya sumri kaji ni hkru mat ai** - This translates to ""The phone's cable is tangled and obstructing.""  This directly addresses the problem described in P – the tangled cable preventing the phone from moving.
* **D: Socket kata de wan ngun lwi ai lam lanyen ai** - This translates to ""The socket's edge has widened.""  This is not mentioned in P and is not a likely reason for the phone being stuck.

Therefore, option C is the most logical and accurate answer to the question.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na wan pu galai shakap ai ten hta gara hpe hkra ai gaw dingbai dingna byin wa chye rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Wan hkalap**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the component that the phone's screen is connected to and is responsible for making the screen display?"" (Translated from the question in Q).
* **The passage describes:** The phone's screen being connected to a ""wan pu kaw na gumhpaw"" (a component connecting to the phone's internal parts). It then mentions that this component ""jum yang dai kaw wan ngun naw nga taw na re"" (connects to the battery to provide power).  Crucially, it says the ""wan pu kaw na gumhpaw"" is what connects the screen to the phone's internal workings.
* **""Wan hkalap"" (backlight)** is the component that illuminates the screen so you can see it.  It's essential for the screen to display information, making it the correct answer.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Waya sumri kaji (screen cable):** While the cable connects the screen to the motherboard, it doesn't *make* the screen display.
    * **C: Wan pu a npawt (phone's main board):**  The main board controls everything, but the question specifically asks about the connection *to the screen* and its display function.
    * **D: Sumri (screen):** The screen itself doesn't display; it *shows* the image that's being fed to it.



Therefore, the **wan hkalap (backlight)** is the component most directly responsible for the screen's display.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, nucleus ga garan mat yang hpa byin na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Proton ni rawt wa ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks what causes the nucleus to become unstable and decay. The passage states: ""Lai ai leng hpe kawng de htu lung ai zawn. Nucleus hte kabai ai hta ngun ni hpe dat kau."" (The nucleus is unstable and tends to decay.)  It also mentions that unstable nuclei decay by emitting particles, specifically referencing protons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dat atsam shapraw ai (Neutron decay):** While neutrons can decay, the passage doesn't highlight neutron decay as the primary cause of instability.  It focuses on the general instability of the nucleus and its tendency to decay.
* **C: Atom ni n zim ai (Atom's composition):** The composition of the atom (number of protons, neutrons, electrons) determines its properties, but doesn't directly cause instability leading to decay.
* **D: Neutron ni mat mat ai (Neutron becomes very heavy):** The passage doesn't mention neutrons becoming heavy.

Therefore, the passage strongly implies that the emission of protons (or other particles resulting from proton decay) is a key factor in nuclear instability and decay.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw galu ai tsan gang shadang kaw nna mungkan ga de matut mahkai ai lam hpe ginhtang ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sumtsan yu myiset ni (Strong winds)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpungtang lamu ganghkau kata de gaw rocket hte shalung dat ai re. Hpungtang hpaji ninghkring ni gaw sumtsan yu myiset ni hpe hpuntang lamu ganghkau kata e lang nga ai...""

This translates to: ""The sky (and its elements) are used to launch rockets and satellites. The strong wind is used to launch the sky (and its elements)...""

Therefore, the passage explicitly links strong winds (""sumtsan yu myiset ni"") to the launching of rockets and satellites. The question asks what *allows* the launch to happen despite the difficulties. Strong winds are presented as the element enabling this despite the challenges mentioned.
"
Ganghkau de sumtsan yu myiset ni bang na matu ndai kaw na hpa ni hpe lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Mungkan a nbung shing**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpungtang lamu ganghkau na jak shagan ni gaw rocket hte shalung dat ai re. Hpungtang hpaji ninghkring ni gaw sumtsan yu myiset ni hpe hpuntang lamu ganghkau kata e lang nga ai, **hpa majaw nga yang, mungkan ga nbung shing gaw anhte a ninghtoi hte yu ai lam hpe manai makai ni kau ya ai majaw re.**""

This translates to: ""The rocket and satellite are launched from the launchpad. The launchpad's control room sends a command to the launch vehicle, and **if the weather is bad, a backup plan will be used, and it will be postponed until the weather is good.**""

Therefore, the reason the launch is postponed is because of bad weather, which is described as ""mungkan a nbung shing"" (if the weather is bad).
"
Aten ma mat ai lam hpe sawk yu na matu lagaw leng jaw ai mabyin langai hte seng nna gara lam hpe sadi da ra na kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Akyu nga ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where a person is trying to escape a dangerous group. The key phrases are:

* ""anhte galaw ai yawng mayawng kaw akyu pru ai"" - ""you quickly flee through the dense forest""
* ""Aten ngu ai gaw lamang ni hta kade ram na ai hpe shingdaw maram yu ai hpe ngu mayu ai re."" - ""The thing [the pursuer] is also relentlessly pursuing you through the plains.""

The question asks what path the person should take to escape the pursuer.  The passage emphasizes fleeing *through the dense forest*. Therefore, the answer must be the path described as ""akyu nga ai lam"" - ""the forest path"" or ""the dense path"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aten ladaw** -  This refers to the pursuer's path.
* **B: Kahtap gala galaw ai lam** - This refers to the path of hurried travel, but not necessarily a forest path.
* **D: Yak hkak ai lam** - This refers to the path of fleeing while making noise.



"
"Matsing masat ga ya hta tsun da ai hte maren, aten hte shingdaw na matu gara mabyin masa ni hpe lang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Akyu nga ai lam (The path of the red/crimson)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a journey (""aten ngu ai"") involving several obstacles.  The key phrase is ""Aten hpe moi shaning hkying hku na makam masham ninghkring, myit mang hpaji ninghkring hte hpungtang hpaji ninghkring ni gaw sharin hkaja wa sai."" This translates to something like: ""The path is fraught with dangers of powerful enemies, treacherous traps, and perilous cliffs.""

The passage then states, ""Anhte hta matut manoi lam yan byin nga ai zawn sha aten ahkying ni hpe mung htawm hpang kaw na ya ten lai sai ten du hkra hkrum nga ai.""  This means: ""From the place where you will be attacked, you should cautiously proceed along the red/crimson path.""

Finally, the passage says, ""Aten ngu ai gaw lamang ni hta kade ram na ai hpe shingdaw maram yu ai hpe ngu mayu ai re."" This translates to: ""The red/crimson path is the path leading to the heart of the castle.""

Therefore, the ""Akyu nga ai lam"" (red/crimson path) is the path the traveler should take to reach their destination, despite the dangers.



**The other options are incorrect because:**

*   **A: Kade ram na ai lam (The path leading to the castle)** - While the red path *leads* to the castle, it isn't the *primary instruction* for which path to take. The passage emphasizes the red/crimson path first.
*   **B: Kahtap gala galaw ai lam (The path of the lively/active)** - The passage doesn't describe a ""lively"" path. It emphasizes danger and caution.
*   **C: Mahkrum madup (The path of the dark/black)** - The passage consistently describes the path as red/crimson.

"Matsing masa ga yan hta ka dai ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na hkaw hkam aya hkam la na matu gara wa hpe yu yu ngu na sawn la mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 2:2 degree lu la ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Raitim, Charles gaw Cambridge kaw na Trinity dakkasu hta Anthropology hte Archaeology hpe sharing wa sai, ngut nna hpang de labau, **2:2 (madang nem ai jam mau)** hpe lu wa ai.""

This directly translates to: ""However, Charles shared in Anthropology and Archaeology at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated with a **2:2 (second class upper)**.""

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the information provided in the text. The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hpyen dap de shang na matu dakkasu shangut la ai** (He studied subjects related to the human body) - While Anthropology *can* involve the human body, it's not the primary focus mentioned.
*   **C: Labau hpe sharin hkam la ai** (He shared in learning) - This is too general; it doesn't specify his degree.
*   **D: Hpyen dap hte nshang shi yang dakkasu shawng sa ai** (He studied subjects that are related to each other) - While Anthropology and Archaeology are related, the question asks about his degree, not the relationship between the subjects.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw dai ai lam hpe mahta nna, Charles shawng nna galaw ai lam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Archeology hpe hkaja ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Charles gaw Cambridge kaw na Trinity dakkasu hta Anthropology hte Archaeology hpe sharing wa sai..."" This directly translates to: ""Charles shared Anthropology and Archaeology at Trinity College, Cambridge...""

Therefore, Charles's field of study was Archaeology. The question asks about the field of study Charles followed related to his background.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jawng n ngut shi a shaloi hpyen dap de shang ai** (He studied the reasons for the existence of life): This is too broad and not specifically mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Janmau langai la ai** (He studied people's lives):  While Anthropology *deals* with people's lives, the passage specifically mentions *Archaeology* as one of his subjects.
*   **D: Trinity dakkasu lung ai** (He loved Trinity College): The passage mentions he *attended* Trinity College but doesn't say he loved it.

The passage states: ""Shawng na hpyen dap hpang de htingnut mat ai hpang Ethelred gaw Norway mungdan de bai wa nna shi a hkawhkam mungdan hpe lapran madang awng dang lam hte bai lu la na matu shakut taw nga ai Olaf hte myit hkrum lu ai."" This translates to: ""Eventually, Ethelred went to Norway and, with the help of other countries, drove Olaf and his forces away.""  This clearly indicates that Trygvasson's forces originated from Norway.
"
Labau a galoi ten hta Germany ni Estonia mung a ntsa htunghking hte seng na aja awa ka-up lai wa ai sairai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lai wa sai 200 ning laman hta**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nkau Germany hpunggyi ni gaw Karai Kasang hpe masha ni hte grau ni htep hkra la wa mayu ma ai, dai majaw shanhte gaw Estonian laika hpe galaw shapraw lai wa ai re."" This translates to something like: ""The elderly German people don't understand Karai Kasang, but the younger Estonians understand the language and are eager to learn it.""  The passage implies a generation gap where understanding of Karai Kasang is diminishing in Germany and growing in Estonia.  Since the text doesn't specify exact numbers, but implies a significant generational shift, the 200-year timeframe is the most plausible answer based on the information provided. The rise of Estonian language understanding among younger generations in Estonia would be a gradual process, while the decline of Karai Kasang understanding in Germany would also be gradual. 400, 600 and 800 years is too lengthy given the context.

Therefore, the best interpretation is a timeframe of approximately 200 years."
Estonian ga gaw hpa hte ka-up da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: German ni a laika kanu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...dai majaw shanhte gaw Estonian laika hpe galaw shapraw lai wa ai re. Dai hpe German laika kanu kaw na la da ai re ngut nna """"""""Õ/õ"""""""" hpe kahtap bang da ai re.""

Translation: ""...but the majority of Estonian people are also in a difficult situation. For this reason, the German people are concerned about the possibility of being attacked, and they have a worried look on their faces.""

This clearly indicates that the Estonian people are causing concern and worry *to the German people*.  Therefore, the answer is that the Estonian people are worried about the German people. The closest translation to ""worried about"" in the given options is ""German ni a laika kanu"" which means ""German people's worry"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Õ/õ laika gasi** - This refers to the Estonian language itself, not the Estonian people causing worry.
* **C: German ni a hpunggyi ni** - This refers to the German population in general, not specifically the reason for the concern.
* **D: Karai Kasang** - This refers to the Karai Kasang, which is a type of traditional Estonian garment. This has no connection to the concern about the German people.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):** The question asks *why* Hindi and Urdu are related to Japanese, considering the provided text says Hindi and Urdu are related to Japanese and that there's a connection between the people (marai wan) and the tsunami (tsun shaga).

* **The Text's Key Points:**
    *  Hindi and Urdu are related to Japanese.
    *  There's a connection between the people and a tsunami.
    *  People from the region (marai wan) were affected by a tsunami.
    *  There was cultural exchange (daram) happening.

* **Why Option C is Correct:**  Option C translates to ""The connection to the shared cultural heritage of the people (ga hpe chye na ai masha ni) is the reason for the relationship between Hindi and Japanese (rti shalawm ai rai yang).""  This option directly addresses the ""why"" question by linking the shared cultural heritage (reflected in the language connection) to the historical connection (tsunami and cultural exchange) between the people (marai wan) and Japan.

* **Why Other Options are Incorrect:**
    * **A & B:**  These options focus on Hindi or Urdu *specifically* relating to Japanese, without considering the broader cultural connection highlighted by the text.
    * **D:** This option talks about a direct historical connection through a tsunami, but doesn't fully capture the cultural heritage explanation provided in the text.



Therefore, option C best explains the reason for the relationship between Hindi/Urdu and Japanese based on the provided information.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam gaw Hindi hte Urdu ga a jaw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shanhte gaw gasi ga ngau hte matsun laika lahkawng yen hta bung ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hindi hte Urdu gaw ga bungai raitim laika nbung ai; ga shagu, shaga ai lahkang yang shada da chye na ma ai."" This translates to ""Hindi and Urdu are linguistically similar; they share a common vocabulary and grammar.""
* **Option C accurately reflects this:**  ""Shanhte gaw gasi ga ngau hte matsun laika lahkawng yen hta bung ai"" translates to ""Shanhte (likely referring to a general context or style) are similar in their vocabulary and grammar.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga hpan lahkawng shaga ai ni a lapran hta matut mahkai lam di mat ai:** This translates to ""They are similar in their vocabulary and grammar, but the overall structure is different."" The passage doesn't imply a completely different structure.
* **B: Shanhte gaw matsun laika nan shai ai:** This translates to ""Shanhte are derived from the same origin."" While Hindi and Urdu share a common origin, the passage focuses on their *similarity* in structure and vocabulary, not their derivation.
* **D: Shanhte gaw gasi ga ngau nan shai ai:** This translates to ""Shanhte are similar in their sound."" The passage doesn't emphasize similarities in sound.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.

Here's why:

The question asks what specifically made Hangeul different from other writing systems. The passage states: ""Hangeul laika kanu hpe Hunmin Jeongeum ngu nna mying jaw dat ai..."" This translates to ""Hangeul characters were created with the Hunmin Jeongeum.""  Therefore, the distinctiveness of Hangeul lies in its creation using the Hunmin Jeongeum.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hkawhkam Sejong up hkang hpang wa ai kaw na dai hpe gin shalat da ai re:**  This refers to King Sejong being the one who promoted Hangeul, not *what made it different*.
*   **C: Dai hpe Joseon Prat a mali lang na hkawhkam wa gin shalat da ai re:** This refers to Hangeul being the official script of Joseon, not *what made it different*.
*   **D: Dai hpe yaw shada lam nga nga hte galaw da ai re:** This is too general and doesn't pinpoint a specific aspect of Hangeul's unique nature.

Hunmin Jeongeum laika kanu gaw hpang jahtum hpa baw de gale mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sejong**.

The text states: ""Hangeul laika kanu hpe gaw hkawhkam Sejong uphkang ai..."" which translates to ""Hangeul was created under the reign of King Sejong..."".  Therefore, Sejong is the one who commissioned or is credited with the creation of Hangeul.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara ga ni gaw Sanskirt a shingkang ka-up hkrum ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Uropa dan na ga ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sanskrit gaw moi na aga langai re nna dai hpe Uropa a Latin aga hte mai shingdaw yu ai."" This translates to ""Sanskrit, though originating in the ancient world, later influenced the Latin language in Europe.""

Therefore, the answer is that Sanskrit influenced the Latin language in Europe.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sanskirt hpe jai lang ai lam gaw hpa na majaw mat mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Aya nem tsaw madang**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Upanishad rau pawng ngut ai hpang kaw na gaw, aya nem tsaw madang hkan ai masa a majaw Sanskrit gaw hkoi mat lai wa ai re."" This translates to: ""The teachings of the Upanishads show that the wisdom of the ancients is the source of Sanskrit.""  ""Aya nem tsaw madang"" refers to the wisdom of the ancients or the Vedic age, which is the foundation of Sanskrit's knowledge and power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grai shuk ai majaw (The wisdom of the world):** While Sanskrit possesses vast knowledge, the text specifically links its power to the ""wisdom of the ancients"" (Upanishads).
* **B: Aryan a bu htawt ai lam (The path of the Aryan race):** The text mentions the Aryans, but it's not the *reason* for Sanskrit's power; rather, the Aryans *used* and *developed* Sanskrit.
* **C: Latin aga ni (The lineage of Latin):** The text contrasts Sanskrit with Latin, highlighting their separate development, but doesn't connect Sanskrit's power to Latin.

Lo ntsa kaw nga ai ginding ningmawng n-gun hte seng nna npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara wa gaw teng ai ndau laika rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lo a ginding ningmu n-gun gang ai gaw grau law ai, dai majaw tinang grau nna li wa ai re**.

Here's why:

* **The Problem:** The first part of the text describes a scenario where a heavier person (90kg) weighs significantly more than a lighter person (16kg). It asks why the weight difference is so pronounced.
* **The Question:** The question asks why the *difference* in weight is so big.
* **Option C's Explanation:**  Option C states that the lighter person's weight is ""grau law ai"" (relatively low) and that the difference is due to the ""tinang grau nna li wa ai re"" (difference from the body's weight).  This directly addresses why a small difference (16kg vs. 90kg) can appear so large.  The ""tinang grau"" likely refers to the body's baseline weight, and the difference is exaggerated relative to that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This option talks about the heavier person's weight *being* the lighter person's weight, which is false.
* **B:** This option says the lighter person's weight is lower, and the difference is due to the body's weight. While partly correct, it doesn't fully explain *why* the difference is so large.
* **D:** This option states the heavier person's weight is the lighter person's weight, which is incorrect.

"Matsing masat laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw shata a shinggan htaphpe teng ai hku tsun da ai kun?","The correct answer is **D: Bumga npu hta maria n law ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks *what* made the person's body burn (shinggan htap hpe gaw makawp ngu shaga ma ai). The text states: ""Dai makau maga de maria ni grau nga mai ai hpa majaw nga yang ntsa lam gaw grau hpa nga ai.""  This translates to: ""Because the person's body burned due to the heat produced by the earth's core, the body was also burned.""  Therefore, the reason for the burning was the heat coming from the earth's core (maria).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ni ai kaw na htap gaw grau htat ai** - This translates to ""The earth's surface heated up."" While the earth's surface would get hot, the *reason* the person's body burned was the heat originating from the core.
* **B: Bumga npu hta ntsa lam na htap gaw grau hpa ai** - This translates to ""The heat from the earth's crust burned."" The crust is not the source of the burning.
* **C: Tsan ai shara hkan maria n law ai** - This translates to ""The heat of the sun's rays burned."" The sun's rays would contribute to the overall heat, but the core's heat was the primary cause.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, shata a ntsa lam hta gara shara kaw htat dik rai?","The correct answer is **D: Maria a npu hta**. Here's why:

* **The Problem:** The passage describes a situation where Shata, a person, is traveling at a certain speed.  Maria's travel speed is related to Shata's.  We need to find the speed of Maria.

* **The Information:**
    * Shata travels for ""ni hte nhpu ni chyu"" (some number of days) and covers 70 km.
    * Maria travels for a duration that's a multiple of Shata's travel duration (e.g., ""grau hpa ai re nna bumga npu de gaw grau nna htat ai re""). This means Maria traveled for 2 times the duration of Shata's travel.
    * Maria's speed is ""majaw nga yang ntsa lam gaw grau hpa nga ai"" - meaning Maria's speed is twice Shata's speed.
    * Shata traveled at a constant speed.

* **The Logic:**  Since Maria travels for twice the time and her speed is twice Shata's speed, Maria will cover a distance that is four times the distance Shata covers. The passage says that Maria's distance is twice Shata's distance which means that the Maria's speed should be twice Shata's speed. 

* **Why the other options are wrong:**
    * **A: Ni ai makau:** ""Ni ai makau"" means ""It is a correct answer"", but we must find which one is the correct answer
    * **B: Maria grau nga ai shara:** ""Maria grau nga ai shara"" means ""Maria's duration"", which is irrelevant to calculating Maria's speed.
    * **C: Bumga npu hta:** ""Bumga npu hta"" means ""The day after tomorrow"", which has no bearing on calculating speed.
    * **D: Maria a npu hta:** ""Maria a npu hta"" means ""Maria's speed"", and according to our calculations, Maria's speed is twice Shata's speed.

**Therefore, the answer is D.**

"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe masha nkau mikam ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Masha ni gaw kaga mungkan ni hpe n lu sawk tam ai**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q)** asks: ""Regarding the benefits of the Law (Masha), what is the main thing it promotes?""
* **The Text (P)** describes the Law as promoting inner peace, calmness, and spiritual development.  It mentions benefits like reducing conflict, fostering harmony, and inner strength. The text emphasizes a shift from worldly concerns (""shagan ni"") to inner peace.
* **Option B** directly reflects this core idea.  It states that the Law promotes ""inner peace and tranquility"" (kaga mungkan ni hpe n lu sawk tam ai).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Masha ni gaw kaga shata mung de bu hkawm ga ai** (The Law promotes avoidance of worldly conflicts). While avoidance of conflict is a benefit, it's not the *main* thing the Law promotes. It's more about transformation *within* to reduce the need for conflict.
* **C: Asak hkrung ai ni gaw kaga mungkan ni hta nga ai** (Inner strength promotes inner peace). While inner strength *contributes* to inner peace, the text doesn't frame it as a direct promotion of inner peace by inner strength. The Law's promotion of inner peace is a broader concept.
* **D: Shata mung ni lapran deng trillion yawm tsan ai** (Worldly possessions are worth trillions of years). This is a completely irrelevant statement about the Law and doesn't address what the Law promotes.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer.

The passage states: ""Jan ka'ang kaw na tsan magang grau hpa wa magang re. **Jan hpe yu ai shaloi mu lu ai shinggan maga daw hpe gaw nhtoi shing**"" which translates to ""The sun's outer layers are made of...The part that the sun's light doesn't reach is the photosphere."" The question asks what the sun's outer layers are made of.  The text directly states the sun's outer layers are ""dat nsa"" (photosphere).
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, jan a gara daw hpe mungkan ga kaw nna mu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Nhtoi shing**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what is the layer where the sun's surface is not seen, but only the light from it is visible.
* The passage states: ""Jan hpe yu ai shaloi mu lu ai shinggan maga daw hpe gaw nhtoi shing"" which translates to ""The layer where the sun's light is not seen, but only the light from it is visible is called the photosphere.""
* ""Nhtoi shing"" directly translates to ""photosphere"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ntsa lam (Surface):** The passage describes a layer *below* the surface, not on it.
* **B: Dat yi la ngun bung dat nsa (The layer of the sun's atmosphere that glows):** While related, this describes the glowing layer, not the layer where the surface itself is hidden.
* **D: Ka-ang (Core):** The core is the innermost part of the sun, and the passage doesn't relate the question to the core.



"
Copernicus a theory hpe shagrin na matu npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara sawk tam ai lam gaw karum ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Venus a lai sa ai lam (Venus's transit)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bai shaning kachyi myi na mat ai hpang shaning 1639 kaw, Jeremiah Horrocks mying ai Englik hpungtang lamu hkam jak gawt masha gaw Venus a lai sa ai lam hpe bai mu sagawn la lu ai."" This translates to: ""Later, in 1639, an English astronomer named Jeremiah Horrocks was able to observe the transit of Venus.""

The question asks what observations challenged Copernicus's theory. Copernicus's heliocentric model predicted specific planetary movements.  Observing Venus's transit (passing between the Earth and the Sun) provided direct evidence that contradicted some aspects of the geocentric (Earth-centered) model that was still partially supported by Copernicus.  The timing and details of these transits were difficult to predict accurately with the geocentric model, providing support for the heliocentric view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Venu a rawt jat ai lam ni (Venus's rotation):** While Venus's rotation was eventually understood, the passage doesn't directly link its rotation to challenging Copernicus's model.
*   **C: Jan hte Venus bung ai lam ni (The path of Venus between the Earth and the Sun):** This is just a description of Venus's orbit and not a specific observational challenge.
*   **D: Jan hte shata bung ai lam ni (The path of Venus between the Earth and the Sun):** Similar to option C, this describes Venus's orbit but doesn't highlight a specific observational contradiction.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jan de man yawng ai shata a maga mi (The appearance of the Moon):** While Venus's phases resemble the Moon's, the passage specifically focuses on Venus.
*   **C: Jan hpe mungkan ga gayin nga ai lam (The path of Venus):** The passage mentions Venus's path, but the key observation Galileo made was its phases.
*   **D: Venus a shalai shara (Venus's shadow):** The passage doesn't discuss Venus's shadow."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Amazon Mali hka ni gaw gara hka kaw na mahkawng la ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Galu dik hka nu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amazon Hka nu gaw mungkan hta kaba dik htum mali hka re, shi gaw miles hkru kaba ai re."" This translates to ""Amazon's cattle are used for plowing, and he plows miles away.""  The last sentence says, ""Hka nu dai hkanu kaji hkying hku law ai kaw na lwi shang wa ai re,"" which means ""The cattle are used for plowing with heavy weights.""  This implies the cattle are used for plowing, specifically as plowing animals.  Therefore, ""Galu dik hka nu"" (plowing cattle) is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hka nu kaji ni** (The cattle are old) - The text doesn't mention the age of the cattle.
* **C: Panglai ni** (The cattle are gentle) - The text doesn't mention the temperament of the cattle.
* **D: Nambat hkawng kaba dik hka nu** (The cattle are valuable plowing cattle) - While the cattle *are* valuable for plowing, the text explicitly states their use *for plowing*, making ""Galu dik hka nu"" a more direct and accurate description.



"
Gara shagrau ai lamgaw Amazon Hka nu hte n seng ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Galu dik ai hka nu** (Cattle that produce milk).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Amazon Hka nu gaw mungkan hta kaba dik htum mali hka re, shi gaw miles hkru kaba ai re."" This means the Amazon cow is raised for milk production.  It also says ""Amazon hka nu gaw km 6,387 (deng 3,980) galu ai.""  ""Galu"" means milk in this context.  Therefore, the Amazon cow is specifically known for producing milk (galu).

The text says: ""Venezuela masha yawng kaw na law malawng gaw lajang ya ai bungli hta galaw ma ai, nkau mi gaw rai ni shapraw ai kaw galaw ma ai ngut nna kaang hkup gaw hkai lau hkai sha bungli hta galaw ma ai. Venezuela masha ni a ahkyak ai jak rung langai gaw sau shapraw ai re, sau jak rung gaw tsa lam shadang langai sha nga tim mungdan jashang gunrai ni hta na grau ai mungdan shapraw gunrai re.""

This translates roughly to: ""The people of Venezuela have a lot of money, but the ordinary people cannot move easily. The government of Venezuela has a lot of resources, and it is said that the government uses these resources to buy things from Japan.""

The question asks what the government of Venezuela buys from Japan. The text explicitly states: ""sau shapraw ai re"" which means ""it is said that the government uses these resources to buy things from Japan.""  ""Sau"" (そう) means ""that's right"" or ""it is said"". 

Therefore, the answer is **C: Sau**. The question is asking *what* is bought, and the text *says* it's bought from Japan.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara bungli ni hta Venezuelan masha jahpan law dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: Jak rung**.

Here's why:

The passage describes that Venezuelans are not allowed to freely travel to Japan due to a lack of travel documents (tsa lam shadang shi matsat gaw bungli nnga ma ai).  It then says that people who are suspected of illegal activities are prevented from traveling to Japan (nkau mi gaw rai ni shapraw ai kaw galaw ma ai ngut nna kaang hkup gaw hkai lau hkai sha bungli hta galaw ma ai).  Finally, it mentions that the Japanese authorities are strictly scrutinizing visa applications from Venezuelans (Venezuela masha ni a ahkyak ai jak rung langai gaw sau shapraw ai re).

The question asks what the reason is that Japanese authorities are strictly scrutinizing visa applications from Venezuelans.  The passage explicitly states this is because Venezuelans are suspected of illegal activities (jak rung langai gaw sau shapraw ai re).  Therefore, ""Jak rung"" (illegal activities/suspicion of illegal activities) is the correct answer.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how scientists observe the movement of hydrogen atoms.** It mentions using techniques like observing the path of nuclei and how electrons move.
* **The question asks how the movement of atoms is observed.**
* **Option D directly reflects the core idea of the passage.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grai li ai nhprang jat ni byin hkun ai (The future trajectory of the electron is predicted):** While trajectory can be predicted, the passage focuses on *observing* the movement, not just predicting it.
* **B: Shingja dat kabaw bunghkrawng gawgap ai (The electromagnetic force is blocked):** The passage doesn't mention blocking the electromagnetic force.
* **C: Ninghtoi hte kahtet ai dat ni hpe shapraw ai (The simultaneous movement of electrons and nuclei is observed):**  The passage mentions observing both, but option D is a more general and accurate summary of the observation method.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw akyu rawng ai shingja dat kabaw bunghkrawng hku nna galaw shapraw na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Atom ni**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how a hydrogen atom, specifically its nucleus, can move and how this movement relates to the movement of electrons around the nucleus. The question asks what *moves* around the nucleus, which is the defining characteristic of an atom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hydrogen:** While hydrogen is a type of atom, the question asks about the *moving part* within the atom, not the element itself.
*   **B: Shata ni (Nitrogen):**  Nitrogen is another element, but the passage focuses on hydrogen as an example.
*   **D: Dat n-gun (Nucleus):** The nucleus is the center of the atom, but the question asks what *moves* *around* the nucleus.



"

The text states: ""Hka gaw kaga ga shadawn langai re. Hka gahkyin ai lam hpe hydrogen atom lahkawng a lahta hte oxygen aton langai hte galaw da ai.""  This translates to: ""The air is a mixture of many gases. On the surface of the air, hydrogen atoms combine with oxygen atoms.""



Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hydrogen atom langai hte oxygen atom langai (Hydrogen atom molecules and oxygen atom molecules):** The text mentions atoms, not molecules, combining.
*   **B: Hydrogen atom langai hte oxygen atom langai (Hydrogen atom molecules and oxygen atom molecules):** Same reason as above.
*   **D: Hydrogen atom lahkawng hte oxygen atom langai (Hydrogen atom molecules and oxygen atom molecules):** Same reason as above.

"Lama na hka gaw hkrang shai mat ai rai yang, hpa gaw n shai ai sha ngam taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Molecular hkrang**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""De a hkum shan hkrang shai mai timung, dat masa hkrang gaw nshai na re."" This translates to ""Its boiling point is low, and its molecular weight is low.""

* **Molecular weight** directly relates to the size and mass of the molecule.  A lower molecular weight means smaller molecules, which have lower boiling points.

* **The question asks:** ""Lama na hka gaw hkrang shai mat ai rai yang, hpa gaw n shai ai sha ngam taw ai rai?"" which translates to ""If the boiling point is low, what is the reason for the low boiling point?""

* **Option A (Molecular hkrang)** directly addresses the reason for the low boiling point based on the text's information about molecular weight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hkak ai lam (Vapor pressure):** While related to boiling, the text focuses specifically on the molecular weight as the reason for the low boiling point.
* **C: Hkum shan hkrang hte seng ai masa (Low intermolecular forces):**  While low intermolecular forces contribute to a lower boiling point, the text explicitly mentions ""molecular weight"" as the reason.
* **D: Nitrogen ntsin (Nitrogen gas):** This is simply the gas in question, not the reason for its low boiling point.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where someone is being forced to do things against their will and is experiencing hardship and injustice.** The language used is very descriptive of oppression and suffering.
* **Question Q asks what is the reason for the suffering.**
* **Option C directly addresses the cause of the suffering by stating that the ""gram lajang"" (presumably a ruling power or authority) is acting unjustly and forcing people to do things against their will.**  This aligns perfectly with the narrative of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rapdaw up hkang ai ni kaw na yu hparan ai (The people who are struggling are all of them).** This is a general statement and doesn't pinpoint the *reason* for the struggle.
* **B: Luttaw hta arawng ayan nga ai (It's because of the enemy's actions).**  While enemies could be involved, the passage doesn't explicitly state that it's an external enemy; the injustice seems to be coming from within.
* **D: Amyu masha n nga ai magam gun masha (It's because of our own faults).** This implies self-blame, which is contrary to the passage's description of being oppressed and forced to suffer.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer because it correctly identifies the unjust actions of the authority as the root cause of the suffering described in the passage."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara ndau lam gaw galai shai na matu shakut ai majan shaloi rapdaw mung up asuya ni a lam hpe teng ai hku mu mada hkun ai rai?","Let's break down the question and the provided text to determine the correct answer.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text describes a situation involving a ""lahta rapdaw"" (a type of plant or being) and a ""myit hkrum"" (a spirit or entity). Here's a summary:

*   The lahta rapdaw is described as being connected to the myit hkrum, and its life depends on it.
*   The lahta rapdaw provides shelter and food for the myit hkrum.
*   The myit hkrum protects the lahta rapdaw.
*   The lahta rapdaw's existence is linked to the myit hkrum's presence in the area.
*   The myit hkrum is said to be the cause of the lahta rapdaw's strength and endurance.
*   The lahta rapdaw lives in a place where the myit hkrum's power is felt.
*   The myit hkrum is connected to the flow of energy in the world.

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

The question asks: ""What is the connection between the lahta rapdaw and the myit hkrum, and what role does the myit hkrum play in maintaining the lahta rapdaw's life?"" In simpler terms: *How are they related, and how does the spirit help the plant live?*

**Analyzing the Options:**

*   **A: Lahta rapdaw na arawng aya nga ai ni gaw ahkun jahkrat ya ai** (The lahta rapdaw's existence is dependent on the myit hkrum.) This is a very strong and accurate statement, aligning perfectly with the text.
*   **B: Tara upadi hpe gram lajang ai lam ni gaw lahta rapdaw a arawng aya nga ai ni ntsa shamyet taw nga ai** (The path of the energy that goes to the lahta rapdaw is connected to the lahta rapdaw's existence and the myit hkrum.) This statement is partially correct but doesn't fully capture the core relationship.
*   **C: Rapdaw dat kasa ni sa du ai lam n nga ai** (The lahta rapdaw's survival is tied to the flow of energy in the world.) This is partially correct but doesn't explicitly state the myit hkrum's role.
*   **D: Myit hkrum gaw lahta rapdaw's strength and endurance** (The myit hkrum is the lahta rapdaw's strength and endurance.) This is true but doesn't cover the entirety of the relationship.

**Conclusion:**

Option **A** most accurately and comprehensively answers the question, reflecting the central theme of the text. The lahta rapdaw's existence is dependent on the myit hkrum.

**Therefore, the answer is A"
Shanglawt lu ai lam ndau shabra laika a hpang hta ga si ni gara hku ka da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Laika kaba**.

The text states: ""Dai shanglawt jaw ai laika hpang kaw ka da ai gaw shaning 1776 shata man kru 4th ya hta shanglawt jaw wa sai ngut ai re."" This translates to ""The day it was made was the 4th of July, 1776."" Therefore, the answer to the question ""Shanglawt lu ai lam ndau shabra laika a hpang hta ga si ni gara hku ka da ai rai?"" (""What is the day it was made?"") is ""Laika kaba"" (The day).

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam hte Singapore gaw mying gumhkawng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ginsup hpan ni hpe n hkrit n tsang galaw ai** (Ginsup hpan ni hpe n hkrit n tsang galaw ai).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mungdan shang lawt lu ai a shawng daw de, Singapore hpun kawa hpaji hte seng ai nam pan sun a kungkyang ai ni gaw dai zinlawng hpe kahtet ai nam pan sun mare de galai shai lu wa hkra garum ya lai wa sai re."" This translates to: ""Although the orchid is not a national flower, the Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid orchid cultivated in Singapore, has been officially recognized as the national flower since 1981.""

The question asks: ""Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam hte Singapore gaw mying gumhkawng ai rai?"" which means ""What is the reason that the Vanda Miss Joaquim became the national flower of Singapore?""

The passage implies the reason is its being a **hybrid orchid cultivated in Singapore** (Ginsup hpan ni hpe n hkrit n tsang galaw ai).  It highlights the fact that it's a unique creation of Singapore.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mare kaba hte seng ai tsit lali lam** (A type of flower that is not a traditional flower): While technically true (it's a hybrid), it doesn't explain *why* it became the national flower.
*   **B: Bum lung ai** (Beautiful): While the Vanda Miss Joaquim *is* beautiful, beauty alone isn't the reason for national flower status.
*   **D: Shingni hte seng ai shangwi shapyaw lam** (A flower with a unique and colorful appearance): This describes the flower, but doesn't explain *why* it became the national flower of Singapore.



"
Vanda Miss Joaquim ngu ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nampan sun langai** (Or, more accurately, ""a hybrid orchid"").

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1981 hta Vanda Miss Joaquim, hpan kayau wa madai pan hpe mungdan a myu sha nam pan hku lata masat da sai."" This translates to: ""In 1981, Vanda Miss Joaquim, a hybrid orchid, was officially recognized as the national flower of Singapore.""

Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a hybrid orchid.

* **The passage states:** ""New Kingdom ngu ai hkawhkam mungdan a moi prat na Egypt masha ni gaw shaning hkying hku na sai rai nga ai, ningshawng hpu ba ni a nlung shadaw ni hpe mau let shakawn ma ai.""  This translates to: ""During the New Kingdom period, the magnificent pyramids of Egypt were built and shone brightly, and in the blazing sun, their shadows were cast.""
* **The question asks:** ""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Giza jut sen lupwa ni a gara marai madang ni hpe New Kingdom ngu ai moi prat na Egypt masha ni mau shakawn ai lam n nga ai rai?"" This translates to: ""What happened to the shadows of the Giza pyramids during the New Kingdom period, and why were they able to be cast?""
* **The passage directly answers this by saying** that the shadows were cast.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte na asak (The sand of the desert):** The passage mentions the sun and shadows, not sand.
* **B: Nlung ni hpe lang ai (The sun shone):** While true, this doesn't explain *what* happened to the shadows.
* **D: Shanhte na gawgap ai lam (The way the wind blew):** The passage doesn't mention wind.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: Shanhte na hkrang shadang (The shadow of the pyramids)**. The passage focuses on the shadows being cast due to the sun.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpun lap sha dusat ni gaw marang hpe lu na matu gara shara hkan hkawm sa chye ai kun?","The correct answer is **C: Dingda pa layang**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the Mara ecosystem.** It specifically mentions the Maasai Mara.
* **The question asks about the primary animal that lives there.**
* **The passage says, ""...Mara Hka nu lai di nna dingda pa layang de hkawm sa ma ai.""**  This translates to ""...animals live there that are primarily wild."" ""Dingda pa layang"" means ""wild animals"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sinna pa layang:** This translates to ""domestic animals."" The passage focuses on a wild ecosystem.
* **B: Dingdung bum ni:**  This is unclear and doesn't relate to the content of the passage.
* **D: Sinna bum ni:**  This translates to ""semi-domestic animals."" Again, the passage doesn't describe a semi-domesticated environment.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpunlap sha dusat ni gaw April shata laman hkan gara shara kaw na htawt hkawm ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Maasai Mara Myusha Ginra**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Serengeti ginwang kaw Tanzania na Maswa Ginsup Ginra, Ngorongoro Gawn hkang Ginra hte **Kenya kaw Maasai Mara Myusha Ginra** ni lawm ai.""  This translates to ""The vast Serengeti, the Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania, the Ngorongoro Crater, and the **Maasai Mara Game Reserve in Kenya** are famous.""

* The question asks: ""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpunlap sha dusat ni gaw April shata laman hkan gara shara kaw na htawt hkawm ai rai?"" which roughly translates to ""Where, during the migration, do wildebeest and zebras come to graze?""

* The passage directly links the migration to the Maasai Mara Game Reserve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Serengeti ginwang:** While the Serengeti is mentioned, it's not the direct answer to *where* the migration occurs.
* **B: Dingda pa layang:** This translates to ""the long river"" and is not related to the migration location.
* **C: Mara Hka nu:** This translates to ""the mother of Mara"" and is not a geographical location.



"
Operation Sealion hpyen dap ni gaw gara mungdan hpe htim gasat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Germany**.

The text states: ""Germany ni gaw dai hpe Operation Sealion ngu shamying ma ai."" which translates to ""Germany planned Operation Sealion.""
"
Germany gaw Britain hpe gasat ai majan hpe gara hku shamying shaga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Germany ni gaw dai hpe Operation Sealion ngu shamying ma ai."" which translates to ""Germany planned Operation Sealion.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dunkirk:** Dunkirk was a battle where British forces were rescued, not a German plan to invade Britain. The passage describes Dunkirk as a British victory.
* **C: Kriegsmarine:** The Kriegsmarine was the German Navy. While it played a role in the conflict, the passage says the passage mentions it in connection to the British Royal Navy, and its actions weren't the primary plan to invade Britain.
* **D: Hkawhkam ni a hka dap (Naval Warfare):**  This is a general term. While naval warfare was a factor, ""Operation Sealion"" is the specific plan of invasion.



"
African mungdan ni hpe aup hkang na Italy ni a masing hta ra ai lahkam langai ngai hku nna n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Egypt hta nga ai sanghpaw ni hpe la kau ya ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""De a matu, shanhte gaw British sanghpaw ni, daru ni hpe Egutu kaw na shapraw kau ra na."" This translates to ""Therefore, the British administration, and the railway, reached Egypt.""  The question asks how Italy reached African territories. The passage directly links Italy's presence in Africa to the British influence in Egypt.
"
"Matsing masat ga yen hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa hpe Italy a majan hte seng ai yaw shada ai lam majing re ngu sawn lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Africa dan mung ni hpe aup hkang ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""De a matu, shanhte gaw British sanghpaw ni, daru ni hpe Egutu kaw na shapraw kau ra na. Dai hku hkrang shapraw ai hta, Itali a hpyen sanghpaw ni hpe hpa nan nmai galaw ai. Ya na Japan mung gaw panglai kata na Britain zawn re ai zinlawng mungdan kaji langai re.""  This translates to: ""However, the British had a presence in Egypt, and they used it as a base to monitor the Eastern Mediterranean.  Therefore, Italy's colonial ambitions were not greatly realized. On the other hand, Japan was a colonial power in the region of the Pacific, with its base in Britain's sphere of influence.""

The passage then connects Italy's *lack* of successful colonialism to the fact that they didn't expand into Africa as much as other powers (the British did in Egypt). Option A directly addresses this link.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Grau n-gun ja ai hka dap hte hpyen dap ni gawgap ai** (The colonial presence and monitoring were widespread): While the British had a presence, the passage implies that this presence *hindered* Italy's colonial ambitions, not that the monitoring was widespread in a positive way.
* **C: Egypt sanghpaw ni hpe la kau ya ai** (They used Egypt as a base): The passage states Egypt was used *to monitor* the Mediterranean, not as a base for Italian colonialism.
* **D: British sanghpaw daru ni gawgap ai** (The British colonial power was widespread): The passage focuses on how the British power *limited* Italy's colonial success, not on the widespread nature of the British power itself.



"
Shang gasat ai ni hte hku hkau ai lam shawng gawgap la ai gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: German ni**.

The text states: ""1940 ning August shata 15 ya shani hta jinghku mungdan ni hku nna dingda France mungdan maga de hpyen n-gun hte shang kasat sai. Ndai kasat ai lam hpe gaw """"""""Operation Dragoon"""""""" ngu shaga ma ai. Bat lahkawng laman sha Amerika hte French hpyen dap ni gaw France na dingda maga hpe dang manga kau lu sai hte Germani ga de yan lung wa ma sai.""  This translates to: ""On August 15, 1940, the French territory was invaded and occupied. This invasion took place through the route called """"""""Operation Dragoon"""""""" and the American and French forces landed in southern France to liberate it and prevent Germany from regaining control.""

The passage clearly indicates that Germany was the force that invaded and occupied France.  While Vichy French collaborated with the Germans, and American and Free French forces fought against them, the primary aggressor was Germany.
"
Operation Dragoon kaw lawm ai jinghku ni gaw kadai ni rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Amerika hte Free French ni**.

The text states: ""Bat lahkawng laman sha Amerika hte French hpyen dap ni gaw France na dingda maga hpe dang manga kau lu sai hte Germani ga de yan lung wa ma sai."" This translates to: ""From the south, American and French forces landed in France to liberate the French territory and prevent Germany from reinforcing."" Therefore, the operation was carried out by American and Free French forces.
"
Gara hpungtang hpaji rawt jat wa ai lam gaw hka shang sang hpaw ni hka npu de hkawm sa lu shangun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: U-Sanghpaw ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Germany ni a hka npu kaw hkawm ai sanghpaw ni hpe gaw U-Sanghpaw ni ngu nna shaga lai wa sai re.""  This translates to: ""The British (U-Sanghpaw ni) and the British-controlled (sanghpaw ni) forces were engaged in a conflict with the German forces.""

The question asks about the force that fought against the British in the conflict. Therefore, the answer is U-Sanghpaw ni (the British).
"
"Shanhte shawng nna jai lang ai shaloi, gara shara kaw hka npu kaw chye hkawm ai sanghpaw ni hta masat da ai tsan shadang nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Gap ai lam** (The path of separation).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Shan people refused to join the Siamese-led alliance against the Burmese. They chose the ""path of separation"" (gap ai lam) and instead aligned themselves with the British. The passage also mentions the Shan people didn't want to be forced to submit to the Siamese king. Therefore, they opted for independence and remained separate.
"
"Matsing masa hta tsun da ai hte maren, myit hkrum lam hpe kadai tara tawt lai kau ai rai? ","The correct answer is **A: Polish masha**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shaning 1939 na shata ma chyhku 17 ya hta, Polish hpyen dap gaw hten mat sai..."" This directly translates to ""From September 17, 1939, the Polish state was destroyed..."" and goes on to describe the invasion and occupation of Poland. Therefore, the question asks who was affected by the destruction of the Polish state.

The passage mentions the Soviet and Romanian involvement, but it emphasizes the impact *on the Polish state*.  The destruction of Poland is the central event described.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Soviet Hpyen dap hku nna hkrang n shapraw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Madung hpyen dap ting hpe bai zinlum na (Byin mat ai)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shaning 1939 na shata ma chyhku 17 ya hta, Polish hpyen dap gaw hten mat sai, myit mada shara langai sha nga ai gaw htingnut kau nna Romanian madung hpyen dap ting hpe bai zinlum na matu re."" This translates to: ""From the 17th of September 1939, the Polish territory was attacked, and the Soviet Union, having previously signed a non-aggression pact with Romania, invaded it.""

Therefore, the key factor allowing the Soviet Union to invade Poland was the **non-aggression pact with Romania** which gave them a free hand to attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukarain masha ni a shawng maga galaw ai (Ukrainian people's resistance)** - While there was resistance, the pact with Romania was the enabling factor, not the resistance itself.
*   **B: Sinpraw hkran ni hpe shang gasat ai (Attack from the east)** - This is partially true, but the pact with Romania is what made the attack possible.
*   **D: Mungdan shada ga shaka hpe tawt lai ai (The desire to establish a buffer zone)** - While a buffer zone was a motivation for the Soviets, the immediate enabling factor was the pact with Romania, allowing them to invade without fear of immediate Romanian intervention.



"
Italy masha ni a nambat shi hpyen dap a jak ninghkring Du daju gaw hpa byin mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shi gaw Inglik ni kaw rim hkrum ai** (They were defeated by British troops).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bardia sinpraw maga kaw na makoi hkap ai shara langai hta, Itali myu sha nambat shi hpyen dap a jak ninghkring Du daju wa Lastucci hpe Inglik ni rim da ma ai."" This translates to: ""Due to the desperate situation in the Bardia area, the Italian troops led by Du Du wa Lastucci were defeated by British troops.""

Therefore, option C is the accurate reflection of the information provided in the text.
"
Gara shara kaw Italo Balbo sat hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Italy**.

The text states: ""Shata man hkru 28 ya hta, Libya a Munggyi Du daju, Marshal Italo Balbo hte Mussolini a hkring htawng dagraw na wa gaw Tobruk de pyenli pyen yu wa ai ten tinang hpyen dap na lak nak hte si mat wa sai."" This translates to: ""In the 28th year, in the Battle of Munggyi, Marshal Italo Balbo and Mussolini's forces were deployed to Tobruk and fought fiercely.""  Italo Balbo was an Italian Marshal. Therefore, he served the Italian government/military.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Tibet masha ni a tara shim shang ai lam hta ahkyak ai lam rai?","The correct answer is **C: Nat hpara ni hpe mu hkra galaw ai (Shamanic practices that invoke spirits)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Tibetan Bukda's path is different from the large traditions of Kala Yaga and Mahayana, and instead involves ""shamanic practices that invoke spirits."" This is directly linked to the description of ""Ninggun lam yan hku nna nbung ai nat ni hpe mu hkra galaw shakut ai lam ni"" which translates to ""practices that invoke spirits to conquer the forces of darkness.""
* Option A, ""Nsa sa shaman ai lam (Shamanic path),"" is too general. While shamanism is involved, the passage specifies the *purpose* of invoking spirits – to conquer darkness.
* Option B, ""Man dan ga hpe kahtat tsun ai (Practices that focus on achieving enlightenment),"" while potentially connected to the ultimate goal, isn't the direct link to the Tibetan path described in the passage.
* Option D, ""Yoga hkum shamawt ai lam ni hpe kungkyang hkra shaman ai (Shamanic practices that incorporate yoga principles),"" is partially correct, as yoga is involved. However, the passage emphasizes the shamanic aspect *more* than the yoga aspect in defining the Tibetan path.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported by the text.



"
"""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Tibet masha ni tara shim shang ai """"ka-ang"""" hta chakras hpe gara hku asak jahkrung ya ai rai?""","The correct answer is **C: Man dan hpe kahtap tsun ai lam hku (The path of liberating the mind)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Kundalini Yoga and Kundalini energy are paths for liberating the mind, achieving inner peace, and progressing spiritually.
* It explicitly mentions that Tibetan Buddhist practices aim to purify the mind and awaken spiritual potential.
* Option C directly reflects this core idea of Kundalini Yoga and Tibetan Buddhism focusing on mind liberation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yoga hkum shamawt ai lam amyu myu hku na (The path of practicing yoga principles)** While Kundalini Yoga *is* a yoga practice, the passage emphasizes its deeper, transformative effect on the *mind* rather than just adhering to yoga principles.
* **B: Nat hpara ni hpe shingran ai hku (The path of invoking spirits)** While some shamanic practices might involve spirit invocation, the passage focuses on the internal transformation through Kundalini energy and yoga, not external spirit communication.
* **D: Nsa sa shaman ai lam (The path of a shaman)**  While there are overlaps, the passage differentiates Tibetan Buddhism and Kundalini Yoga from shamanic practices. The core emphasis is not on shamanic rituals.



"
Nanbat lahkawng nawku mahkawn hpe lamang ten kadai mahkawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanju Sharma**.

The text states: ""Yungwi ninghkring Sanju Sharma hpe Jai Shankar Choudhary mung lawm nna shana na lamang hpe hpang lai wa sai."" which translates to ""Sanju Sharma will sing in honor of Jai Shankar Choudhary."" This indicates Sanju Sharma is the one singing the devotional songs (bhajan) in this context.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, lusha jaw ai ten hta nawku mahkawn hpe kadai mahkawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text states: ""Dai hpang, Lakkha Singh gaw bhajan nawku mahkawn hkawn ai lam hta ningbaw ai lam hpe galaw lai wa sai re. Chhappan bhog bhajan mung lamang jum lai wa ai re nna..."" which translates to ""Therefore, Lakkha Singh will sing bhajans in the devotional style. Chhappan bhog bhajans will be sung..."" This indicates Lakkha Singh is the one who will sing the Chhappan Bhog bhajans.
"
Shana daw na nambat hkawng hpang jahtum lang shangwi shapraw ai wa gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina hte Haris Alexiou**.

The question asks who Turkish diva Sezen Aksu sang with. The text states: ""Turkish diva Sezen Aksu gaw Italy Alessandro Safina hte Greek kaw na yung ngoi ning hkring Haris Alexiou hpe hkrang shala ai."" which translates to ""Turkish diva Sezen Aksu sang with Italy's Alessandro Safina and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.""
"
Alessandro Sofina gaw hpa amyu rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Italy masha**.

The text states: ""Turkish diva Sezen Aksu gaw Italy Alessandro Safina hte Greek kaw na yung ngoi ning hkring Haris Alexiou hpe hkrang shala ai."" This translates to ""Turkish diva Sezen Aksu sang alongside Italy's Alessandro Safina and Greek Haris Alexiou."" Therefore, Alessandro Safina is Italian.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Roller coaster ntsa kaw masha ni jawn taw ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: """"""90 ning ram hta na dai shani gaw Santa Clara hta gaw kahtet ai nhtoi langai re. Roller coaster ntsa kaw jawn taw nga ai aten gaw kade mi wa re tim npyaw la nga na re, yawm htum tsun ga nga yang, shawng jawn ai wa yu na matu yawm htum aten hking hkum mi dang na ai re.""""""

This translates to: """"""At 90 degrees from the vertical axis, the rotation is aimed towards Santa Clara. The rotating part of the roller coaster is a unique feature, the ride starts with a thrilling experience, and the passenger is spun around and then falls down with a 60-second interval.""""""

The question asks about what the ""masha ni gaw 90(F) kahtet ai degree kaw lat taw ai majaw shanhte hpe hka bu jaw ma ai"" (the unique feature of the roller coaster) is. The passage directly states this feature is the ""Roller coaster ntsa kaw jawn taw ai"" (the rotating part of the roller coaster).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Santa Clara hta wan hkru ai lam byin ai (Aiming towards Santa Clara):** While the roller coaster *aims* towards Santa Clara, it's not the unique *feature* itself.
* **C: Bu hkawm ai ni hpe hka jaw ai (The unique feature of this program):**  The question asks about the unique feature of the roller coaster, not the program.
* **D: Shawng nnan masha langai hpe shapraw na matu minit 60 yawm htum na ai (Spinning around and then falling down with a 60-second interval):** This describes *part* of the experience but not the *unique feature* that distinguishes it.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, kadai gaw nga n pyaw ai kahtet madang a lam hpe tang shawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Wan sat ningbaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wan sat ningbaw Scott Kouns tsun ai gaw..."" which translates to ""Scott Kouns, a prominent figure, said...""  The question asks who said the quoted sentence. Therefore, the answer is Wan sat ningbaw (a prominent figure).
"
Tsunami a majaw dat n-gun n lu mat ai gaw gara shara rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""Tonga kaw hpa nhten ai dai nrai ana lu ai mung nnga ai..."" which translates to ""Tonga experienced a significant earthquake..."" The text then mentions that the PTWC (Pacific Tsunami Warning Center) issued a tsunami warning for Tongan areas.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Tonga gaw dat n-gun n lu ai lam hta gara hku hkra machyi nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Sadi jaw ai shiga hte seng ai shiga ni hpe mung aup ai ni gaw shiga ni hpe nlu la ma ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) issues tsunami warnings. Tonga has a volcano that erupts and causes earthquakes, which are then monitored by the PTWC. When a tsunami warning is issued, the Tongan islands are evacuated.

* **Analyzing the options:**
    * **A: Dai hta hten ai lam nkau mi nga ai ngu shiga jaw ai** (The land where the tsunami is generated is a place where people live): While true in general, this doesn't specifically explain why Tonga is evacuated.
    * **B: Sadi jaw ai shiga hte seng na ahkang aya lu ai ni gaw shiga n lu la ma ai** (The area where the warning is issued and the area where the tsunami is expected to arrive are not evacuated): This is incorrect. The passage clearly states Tongan islands *are* evacuated when a warning is issued.
    * **C: Panglai hka rawt madang hti ai lam hkra machyi ai** (It is monitored from a place outside of Panglai): This is partially true (PTWC is outside Panglai), but it doesn't explain *why* Tonga is evacuated based on that monitoring.
    * **D: Sadi jaw ai shiga hte seng ai shiga ni hpe mung aup ai ni gaw shiga ni hpe nlu la ma ai** (The time when the warning is issued and the time when the tsunami is expected to arrive are not the same): This is the best answer. The passage implies that the warning allows time for evacuation *before* the tsunami arrives.  The ""seng ai shiga"" (expected arrival time) and ""sadi jaw ai shiga"" (warning time) are distinct.

Therefore, option D most accurately reflects the relationship between the warning and the evacuation process described in the text.



"
Jonny Reid a mawdaw gau chyang shadang hpe lu shadawn lu na matu pyada ni gaw shanhte a radai sinat hpe galoi lu lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shi 160km/h hta jan na gau ai ten** (He was driving at 160km/h).

The passage states: ""Mr Reid gaw New Zealand na A1GP mawdaw achyang hpe mahkrai sanit lang lai nna 160km/h lawan n-gun hte gau na matu galaw wa ai."" This translates to: ""Mr Reid was driving the A1GP car at a speed of 160km/h.""

Option C accurately reflects this information.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi 160km/h hta gau taw ai ten** (He was driving at 160km/h) - While technically correct, it's not the most specific answer. It doesn't emphasize *how* he was driving at that speed.
* **B: Mahkrai ntsa nambat sanit lang gau ai ten** (He was driving at a very high speed). -  The passage only mentions 160km/h, not a ""very high speed.""
* **D: Mahkrai ntsa shawng nna gau ai ten** (He was driving at a small speed). - This is directly contradicted by the passage.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Jonny Reid a chyang shadang hpe New Zealand pyada ni shadawn na matu hpa majaw yak ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw 160km/h npu hta gau taw ai majaw** (He was driving at a speed of 160km/h).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mr Reid gaw New Zealand na A1GP mawdaw achyang hpe mahkrai sanit lang lai nna 160km/h lawan n-gun hte gau na matu galaw wa ai."" This directly translates to ""Mr Reid was driving at a speed of 160km/h.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mawdaw grai nem ai majaw** (The car was a beautiful car): While the car might be beautiful, the passage doesn't state this as the reason for his speed.
*   **C: Shi gaw mahkrai ntsa kaw sha sanit lang gau ai majaw** (He was driving fast while sanitizing the harbor): The passage doesn't mention sanitizing the harbor.
*   **D: Auckland Harbour Mahkrai gaw grai dingsa taw sai majaw** (Auckland Harbour was a dangerous place): The passage doesn't indicate that the harbor was dangerous.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is that Jonny Reid was driving at 160km/h."
Butte hte seng ai n-nangnawn gaw gara kaw maju ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dingda maga deng 40 hta**.

The passage states: ""Butte mare a dingda maga km 65 (deng 40) daram kaw na maju wa ai nnang nawn ai lam re."" This translates to ""Butte's direction is 65 km (approximately 40 miles) away from the mountain range.""
"
Kasu kabrawng byin ai laman Abu Ghraib hta hpa byin wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: US hpyen dap ni shara la ai**

Here's why:

The question asks *who* was responsible for the atrocities at Abu Ghraib. The first sentence of the text states: ""Iraq na Abu Ghraib bawng masha gaw kasu kabrawng byin ai laman hta rim dat ai. US hpyen dap ni shara la ai hpang bawng masha ni zing ri hkrum ai brawng mat wa ai majaw hkyuk htawng gaw nkaja ai hku myit kaba mat ai.""  This translates to: ""At Abu Ghraib in Iraq, prisoners were abused. The US military personnel who were responsible for this were caught in a terrible situation.""

Therefore, the text explicitly states that the **US military personnel** were responsible. Option C directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bawng masha ni hpe zing ri ai (Prisoners):** The prisoners were the victims, not the perpetrators.
*   **B: Shinggan n pru hkun ai (The devil):** This is not a factual answer based on the text.
*   **D: Htawng wan nat hkrum ai (The government):** While the US government authorized the actions, the text specifically mentions the **military personnel** carrying them out."
Iraq hkyuk htawng gaw hpa majaw n kaja ai lam hta gumhkawng wa ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **B: US hpyen dap ni shara la ai majaw** (The judiciary of the US that was involved).

Here's why:

* The text states that the abuse at Abu Ghraib was linked to the ""judiciary of the US.""
* Option B directly reflects this connection.
* The other options are incorrect:
    * A: ""Wa nat hkrum ai majaw"" (The judiciary of the Iraqi government) - The text doesn't mention the Iraqi government's judiciary.
    * C: ""Kasu kabrawng byin ai lam grai nga ai majaw"" (The judiciary that was involved in the abuse of prisoners) - While the judiciary *allowed* the abuse to happen, the text explicitly names the US judiciary as the source of the problem.
    * D: ""Bawng masha ni zing ri hkrum ai lam hpe sawk tam lu ai majaw"" (The judiciary that was more involved in overseeing the government) - The text doesn't indicate a lack of oversight as the primary issue; it points to the judiciary's involvement in the abuses.



"
Maui a Majan Masat dingsat Ginsup pa hta hpa poi galaw hkyen ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shangwi shapyaw poi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""dai uhpung gaw masha 9,000 lamang yu mai ai Maui a Majan Masat dingsat Ginsup pa hta shangwi shapyaw lamang hpe dawn jay na ai..."" This translates to: ""...the money of 9,000 only yuan from Maui a Majan Masat dingsat Ginsup was given to him...""  The question asks what the money was for. The passage directly says it was for ""shangwi shapyaw"" (which likely translates to ""to support the community/people"").



Therefore, option C is the only answer that aligns with the information provided in the passage."
Poi lamang dawm kau ai hte seng na hpang jahtum hta kadai gaw hpyi nem ai lam bai galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hparan ai hpaga hpung**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what *thing* is being used to move the water.
* The text states: ""HK Hparan Hpareng Inc., gaw September shata 20 ya shani shaloi lamang dawm kau ai lam hpe sang lang dan ai lam nnga ai sha hpang shani hta e htaw wa htaw sa hparan ai lam hpe lawt ga madun nna mara shagun ma ai."" This translates to: ""HK Hparan Hpareng Inc., has been conducting a project to move water since September 20th, using a water pump.""
* ""Hparan ai hpaga hpung"" means ""water pump"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Uhpung:** This translates to ""fish"". The text doesn't mention fish being used to move the water.
* **C: Majan Masat dingsat Ginsup pa madu:** This is a descriptive phrase and doesn't refer to a tool or object used for moving water.
* **D: Shanhte hpe n-gun jaw shawa ni:** This translates to ""the water that is dark and dirty"". It describes the *water* itself, not the tool used to move it.



"
Kashun kashe ai lam hte seng nna kadai kaw lit nga ai ngu Bishkek kata hta nga ai masha ni sawn la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tara shagrin du salang ni**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the main reason (kashun kashe) for people leaving Bishkek is. The provided text states:

""...Bishket lam ni hta tara shagrin du salang ni nnga taw ai hte maren...""

This translates to: ""...people leave Bishkek because of the high cost of living...""  ""Tara shagrin du salang ni"" directly means ""high cost of living"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Gat seng madu ni:** This translates to ""bad roads."" While roads might be an issue, the text doesn't highlight it as the *main* reason.
*   **C: Shawa n-gun madun ai ni:** This translates to ""lack of jobs.""  While job scarcity *could* be a factor, the text explicitly mentions the high cost of living as the primary reason.
*   **D: Ramma ni:** This translates to ""cold weather."" This isn't mentioned in the text at all.



Therefore, **Tara shagrin du salang ni (high cost of living)** is the accurate answer."
Kashun kashe lam a matu dingda maga na ninghkap masha ni hpe kadai ni mara tam ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek hta nga ai masha ni**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""At what time do the residents of Bishkek receive the water supply?""

The passage states: ""Bishkek hta nga ai masha ni hpe tara nlang ma ai majaw mara shagun ma ai.""  This translates to: ""The water supply to Bishkek is received [at] the time of the morning.""

Therefore, option A accurately reflects the information given in the passage.  The other options are incorrect because they refer to other aspects of the text, not the water supply time.

The text states: ""Siminoff tsun ai gaw bungli nnan hpang ai ten gumhpraw sum ai lam madun ai 2013 na shi a Shark Tank langai ngut ai hpang gaw dut kaja wa ai re."" which translates to ""Siminoff's invention was initially rejected on the 2013 Shark Tank.""
"
Jamie Siminoff gaw galoi hta Ring hpe gaw de hpang sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Shark Tank ngut ai hpang**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Siminoff tsun ai gaw bungli nnan hpang ai ten gumhpraw sum ai lam madun ai 2013 na shi a Shark Tank langai ngut ai hpang gaw dut kaja wa ai re."" (Siminoff then, in 2013, went to Shark Tank to get investment.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi a seng chyinghka kaw na nsen shangoi ai jak nsen nmai ngoi ai hpe chye ai hpang** (He believed in the potential of home security): While true, this doesn't explain *how* he got Ring started.
* **C: Gumhpraw lu la ai hpang** (He was a successful businessman): The passage doesn't state that he was already successful before launching Ring.
* **D: QVC ngut ai hpang** (Through QVC): QVC is mentioned later, as a way he gained visibility, but not how he initially got Ring started.

Laika hti ai Ngoi Latung a nta shara lamang langai hkrai gaw ma ni hpe hpa the seng nna madi shadaw ai lam jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Television madun lamang ni (Children's Television)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how PBS, Sesame Street, and Mister Rogers' Neighborhood were important for children's programming. It mentions that John Grant, a prominent figure in children's television, advocated for high-quality educational content for kids. The passage also states that he dedicated his career to creating and promoting children's television programs.

Therefore, the question asks what type of television programming John Grant advocated for, and the passage explicitly states he was involved in **Children's Television**.
"
Laika hti ai Ngoi Latung a nta shara lamang langai hkrai gaw ma ni hpe hpa the seng nna madi shadaw ai lam jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Karum gumhpraw n law ai (The program is produced)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""WNED Buffalo kaw na John Grant ( laika hti ai ngoi latung a nta shara) tsun ai gaw laika hti ai ngoi latung lam gaw ma ni hpe hpa majaw laika hti ai, hpa majaw laika hti ai hpe ra ai - (lamang) gaw ma ni hpe laika bok hte laika hti wa na matu ngun jaw ya ai lamang re.""  This translates to: ""John Grant of WNED Buffalo (the program's producer) had the program made, and the program was aired - (specifically) the program was made for children and was aired at a suitable time.""

Therefore, the program's production is the reason it was aired.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emmy kumhpa ni n law ai (Produced for an Emmy):** The text doesn't mention anything about the program being produced for an Emmy.
* **C: John Grant a ningmu (John Grant's opinion):**  While John Grant is mentioned, the text focuses on his role as the producer, not his personal opinion.
* **D: Mister Roger a htingbu awngdang lam (Mister Roger's approach):** The text mentions Mister Roger as an example of a good children's program but doesn't say his approach is the reason *this* program was aired.



"
Amsterdam hte madun shara a matu lit nga ai ni gaw dai hpun hte seng na npu e jaw da ai kaw nna gara ndang hkat ai lam hpe n galaw wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dai gaw shawa hkam kaja lam hta dingbai dingna nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks: ""In Amsterdam, what is the street you would walk on to see the house where Anne Frank and her family hid, and where they were eventually arrested?""
* **The passage (P)** describes the street where Anne Frank's house is located, mentioning that it's a quiet street away from the main thoroughfare.  It also states that the street leads to a courtyard.
* **Option D** accurately reflects this information: ""That is the street leading to the courtyard where the house is located.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai hpun gaw koi yen nlu sha di hkrat na re** - This translates to ""That is a place where a beautiful, old building is located."" While Anne Frank's house is in an old building, this doesn't specify the correct street.
* **B: Dai hpe mazing da ging ai** - This translates to ""That is where you can eat delicious food."" The passage doesn't mention food.
* **C: Dai gaw maza ana kap taw ai** - This translates to ""That is where people gather."" While there might be people around the area, the passage focuses on the street itself.



Therefore, only option D correctly identifies the street leading to Anne Frank's house.
"
"RSPCA a san jep ningbaw tsun ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara a matusan jep ai lam gaw madang dep ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV camera ni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""RSPCA Dingda Wales a jep maran ningbaw nnan David O'Shannessy ABC hpe tsun ai gaw jep maran ai lam ni hpe Australia mung ting kaw malawng nga ra ai. **RSPCA ni gaw Australian shan sat dap ni yawng hta CCTV camera ni shakap shagrin sa wa na matu kalang bai hpyi lajin nga ma ai.**""

This translates to: ""RSPCA's representative, David O'Shannessy, spoke to ABC about the significant impact in Australia. **The RSPCA is using CCTV cameras to investigate cruelty to young animals.**""

Therefore, the RSPCA is using CCTV cameras to investigate cruelty. Options B, C, and D are not directly supported by the text.
"
"Masting masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Australia shan sat rung hta shan sat ai masha ni dusat ni hpe gawn lajang ai lam a ahkyak ai lam hpe ngang kang hkun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV camera ni**.

Here's why:

The question asks what technology is used to capture the behavior of dogs that are mistreated. The passage explicitly states: ""Australian shan sat sat dap ni yawng hta CCTV camera ni shakap shagrin sa wa na matu kalang bai hpyi lajin nga ma ai."" This translates to: ""CCTV cameras are installed to capture the behavior of dogs being mistreated.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: RSPCA hte galaw ai ahkyak ai zup hpawng ni:** While the RSPCA is involved, the question asks about the *technology* used to capture the mistreatment, not the organization itself.
*   **C: Shan sat rung hpe galoi mung san jep taw ai:** This refers to the process of reporting mistreatment, not the technology used to capture it.
*   **D: ABC kaw nna yu hparan ai:** ABC is a news organization that reported on the situation, but it's not the technology used to *capture* the mistreatment.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, rim hkrum ai masha a magam bungli gaw hpa baw rai?","The correct answer is **C: Tribal Tingnyang up**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai wa gaw Red Lake Tribal Tingnyang up, Floyd Jourdain a 16 ning nga ai kasha Louis Jourdain re.""  This translates to ""Dai (the perpetrator) is the son of Louis Jourdain, who is the 16th chief of the Red Lake Tribal Council.""

Therefore, the answer is that the perpetrator is connected to the **Tribal Council**. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaga rim hkrum ai shiga ni shabra taw ai ten hta, tsin yam hkrum ai kade ram a matu makoi mayang hpawng galaw taw ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Masum**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes Jeff Weise's actions as extremely violent and unjust.** He committed a terrible massacre.
* **The question asks about the reason for his actions.** The text implies he acted out of a distorted sense of righteousness and was driven by resentment and a desire for revenge.  The text mentions he wanted to ""shabrang wa hpang de hpa baw wa mi e shadut dat re nchye lu nga ai rai timung asak kaji tara jun ai lam hpe ginjaw asuya hte seng ai tara rung kaw gaw galaw hpang nga sai re"" - meaning he wanted to punish and avenge those he perceived as wrongdoers.
* **""Masum"" translates to ""innocent""** which is the opposite of what Weise was. However, the question is probing at the *reasoning* behind his actions, which stems from a warped sense of justice or perceived righteousness. The options aren't directly describing Weise's character, but rather the *reasoning* he used to justify his terrible actions, making ""Masum"" the most fitting (though ironic) answer, indicating a belief in his own twisted moral authority.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Langai** - This translates to ""foolish"" or ""silly"". Weise's actions were far from foolish; they were calculated and brutal.
* **C: Jahku** - This translates to ""godly"" or ""sacred"". Weise's actions were deeply ungodly and sacrilegious.
* **D: Mali** - This translates to ""wrong"" or ""incorrect"". While his actions were wrong, the question asks about the underlying *reasoning* or distorted belief system that drove him, not just the fact that he was wrong.

Therefore, ""Masum"" is the best answer as it implicitly reflects the flawed and twisted ""justice"" Weise believed he was enacting."
"Shawa n-gun madun ai ni hpe htai ya ai hku na, gara mungdan gaw ACTA myit hkrum ga shaka laika hte matut nsa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Lai wa sai shata hta, Polish mangdan aup ni gaw myit hkrum da ai lam hpe ngalaw ai, ACTA hpe seng htu wa ai hta Poland kaw myit nhkrum masha ni grai law wa ai."" This directly translates to ""In the last few years, the Polish government has been opposing the ratification of ACTA, and Poland has refrained from ratifying ACTA.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Germany:** The passage mentions Germany as a place where people are traveling *from* to buy goods, but it doesn't mention Germany's stance on ACTA.
* **C: Scotland:** The passage mentions Glasgow in Scotland as a place people are traveling to, but doesn't mention Scotland's stance on ACTA.
* **D: Lithuania:** The passage mentions Vilnius in Lithuania as a place people are traveling to, but doesn't mention Lithuania's stance on ACTA.

"Matsing masat gayan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai mungdan ni kaw na gara mungdan ni gaw ACTA hte matut mahkai ai lam hpe myit hkrum na matu daw dan sai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Latvia hte Slovakia lahkawng yang gaw ACTA kaw shang ai lam hta hpang hkrat ma ai.""  This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia together have opposed the path of agreement with ACTA.""

The question asks which country, along with another, has opposed ACTA.  Latvia is explicitly mentioned as opposing it.
"
iPod a kahtet lai ai mabyin a majaw masha kade machyi hkrum ai rai?,"The answer is **D: 34**.

The text states: ""Lai sai bat hta, METI shana ai gaw Apple kompani ni shanhte tsun ai """"""nau n-ahkyak ai"""""" ngu ai kaga kahtet lai ai manghkang 34 byin wa ai nga re."" which translates to ""According to the latest data, METI estimates Apple company's next year's sales will be 34 billion dollars.""
"
Kahtet lai ai mabyin gaw hpa n sawng ai ngu na kadai tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: METI**.

The text states: ""Japan mung aup ni a Economy, Trade hte Industry (METI) tsun ai gaw dai jak hte seng nna mangkang 27 hpe chye da ai da."" This translates to ""Japan's Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has announced 27..."".  The question asks which entity announced the predicted sales figures. Therefore, METI is the correct answer.
"
"Shi ga shaga ai ten hta, Steve Jobs gaw Apple hku nna hpa hpe bai gin shapraw na re ngu tsun wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Phone**.

Here's why:

The question asks what Steve Jobs built Apple to create. The passage states:

""""""""Dai ni na ten Apple gaw phone hpe bai gin shapraw nga ai, anhte a labau hpe dai ni hpang taw sai.""""""

This translates to: ""From the beginning, Apple built to create phones, and it was successful.""

Therefore, Apple was built to create **phones**.
"
Steve Jobs a hkying hkum lahkawng na ai numhtet ga a yaw shada lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Phone nnan ni hpe shabra na matu** (He was determined to build a phone that was excellent).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai ni na ten Apple gaw phone hpe bai gin shapraw nga ai, anhte a labau hpe dai ni hpang taw sai."" which translates to: ""From then on, Apple was determined to build an excellent phone, and he always insisted on it.""  This directly indicates his focus and determination on building a great phone.  The other options are incorrect based on the passage.
"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner gaw Argentine poi yu ginra hta hpa hpe ndau shana wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Buenos Aires ginwang dat kasa hpung a matu shi a me lu hkra hkaw tsun ai lam**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jan. Kirchner hku nna, shi gumsan magam byin na matu Argentine poi yu ginra kaw shingjawng ai a yaw shada lam gaw 2005 ning hta Buenos Aires ginwang dat kasa hpung a campaign hta shi hpung shang masha hku nna shawng galaw hpang wa ai shara re ai majaw re ngu ndau shabra dat ai.""

Translation: ""After taking office, she continued her popular movement, which was rooted in her popularity and the political movement of Argentina's popular support, from 2005 onwards, from the campaign to the national government starting in Buenos Aires.""

This clearly indicates that she began her rise to power by campaigning from Buenos Aires to the national government.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi a gumsan magam hte seng ai dat kasa lam:** (Her popularity and political movement) While related, this isn't the *starting point* of her rise to power.
* **B: Lahta rap daw hpe woi awn na matu shi a yaw shada ai lam:** (The path she took to gain popular support)  This is too general.  It doesn't specify *where* that path began.
* **D: Ya na lahta rapdaw amat hku nna gun hpai na shi a masing:** (The way she rose to power through her immense popularity)  Similar to B, this is too broad and doesn't pinpoint the origin.



"
Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner gaw shi a yaw shada lam ni hpe galaw sa wa na matu gara shara kaw ndau shana ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Buenos Aires hta nga ai La Plata Poi yu ginra hta**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...mare langai rai nga ai La Plata mare kaw re ai lam hpe ndau shana lai wa sai. Jan. Kirchner hku nna, shi gumsan magam byin na matu Argentine poi yu ginra kaw shingjawng ai a yaw shada lam gaw 2005 ning hta Buenos Aires ginwang dat kasa hpung a campaign hta shi hpung shang masha hku nna shawng galaw hpang wa ai shara re ai majaw re ngu ndau shabra dat ai.""

This translates to: ""...and he traveled from Buenos Aires to La Plata. Since taking office, Kirchner has been actively campaigning nationally since 2005, traveling from Buenos Aires to La Plata.""

Therefore, she traveled from Buenos Aires *to* La Plata.
"
Big Brother hte seng na ACMA a sawk tam lu ai lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Big Brother internet laika man hta shawa matut mahkai rai zing da ai hpe mu ai**.

Here's why:

The text states: """"""Big Brother"""""" gaw kaga jep jen ai tara hpe nhkan nang ai lam ni nnga ai hpe mu ma ai. This translates to: ""Big Brother"" monitors the content that is broadcast on the internet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jep Jen ai tara gaw tawt lai n hkrum ai:**  This refers to the broadcast of illegal content. While ACMA might address this indirectly, the primary focus mentioned is on monitoring the content itself.
* **C: Jep jen ai tara gaw tawt lai hkrum ai:** This is a repetition of option A and not the core point.
* **D: Mabyin masa ni hpe server ntsa hta shakap taw ai lam hpe mu lu ai:** This is about server-side actions, which isn't the main focus of the text regarding ACMA's role in ""Big Brother.""

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the main point: ACMA monitors the content that appears on the internet through ""Big Brother.""



"
Internet ntsa rawng ai rai hku nna myit na matu shawa matut mahkai ra hta gara masat hkrang nga ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dai hpe ACMA kaw na hkap la ra ai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ACMA (Broadcasting Service) is responsible for regulating internet broadcasting and ensuring that content complies with their standards. 
* The passage describes how ACMA can take action against content that is deemed inappropriate or violates regulations. 
* Option D directly reflects this responsibility of ACMA.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai gaw internet ntsa kaw mu lu na re (It's the internet itself that's responsible):** The passage focuses on ACMA's role in *regulating* the internet, not the internet itself being responsible.
* **B: Dai gaw server langai hta nga taw ra ai (It's the server that's responsible):**  While servers play a role in broadcasting, the passage directly attributes the responsibility for regulating content to ACMA.
* **C: Dai hpe internet laika man hkan n mai zing da ai (It's related to the popularity of internet users):** The passage doesn't connect content regulation directly to the number of internet users.



"
Australia Liberal Parti a ningbaw gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Petru Costello hte Liberal pati ningbaw langai re ai..."" which translates to ""Peter Costello was the Liberal party's heir...""
"
Australia mung hta hpa majaw nuclear jak rung ni n nga shi ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mung shawa madi shadaw ai lam ra kadawn ai majaw** (A government that is afraid of the future and avoids it).

Here's why:

* The passage states that under Prime Minister John Howard, Australia ""avoided the nuclear path"" and ""acted cautiously.""  This implies a cautious, future-oriented approach, and perhaps a fear of the consequences of nuclear involvement.
* Peter Costello's quote emphasizes this cautiousness, stating that ""Nuclear weapons are not a solution.""  This points to a reluctance to embrace nuclear power.
* The phrase ""avoided the nuclear path"" strongly suggests a decision made out of caution regarding the future.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Grai ningdang hkat ra ai majaw** (A powerful and domineering government): The passage doesn't describe Australia as a powerful or domineering nation.
* **C: Dingbai dingna grai law ai majaw** (A wise and prudent government): While cautious, the passage doesn't frame Australia's decision as solely wise and prudent. It leans more towards avoiding a potentially dangerous path.
* **D: Grai hpu ai majaw** (A government that is eager to expand its territory): The passage doesn't discuss territorial expansion.



Therefore, option A best captures the essence of Australia's decision to avoid nuclear weapons based on the information provided."
Gara hkyen jawn ai wa gaw lam madun ai wa a karum ningtum ai hte shanglawm shing jawng ai rai?,"The answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The question asks for the athlete who is described as ""hkyen jawn ai wa gaw lam madun ai wa a karum ningtum ai hte shanglawm shing jawng ai,"" which translates to ""who is good at the slopes, has a great attitude and is a good competitor."" The text explicitly states that Maciej Krezel and Anna Ogarzynska are ""hkyen jawn ai wa"" (good at the slopes) and ""shangut kau ai"" (compete).  Looking at the options, only Maciej Krezel is listed as being associated with Anna Ogarzynska, and both are described as having a good competitive spirit.

Therefore, the correct answer is C.
"
Super-G for the women’s standing class hta gara mungdan gaw tsang shi hpe shangut ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Finland**.

The text states: ""Shanhte gaw the Netherlands kaw na mani Super-G hta Anna Jochemsen shara chyhku lu ai hte lamang langai kaw sha Finland kaw na Kathja Saarinen shara shi lu ai hpe gayau kau ai."" This translates to ""She (Anna Jochemsen) competed in the Super-G in the Netherlands and then competed in Finland against Kathja Saarinen."" This indicates Kathja Saarinen is from Finland and competed in Super-G for the women's standing class.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Blake hte seng na gara ndau lam gaw shut ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shi gaw dinglun ai hta hpun tawng lang ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tara agyi gaw Blake hpe tsun ai, dai gaw """"""gara hku mung koi yen nmai ai"""""" re she hpe hkyuk htawng de sa kau sa na.""  This translates to: ""His sister (Tara) was with Blake, and she threw a stone at him, saying, 'You are a worthless and despicable person.'""

Therefore, Blake was insulted. Option C, ""Shi gaw dinglun ai hta hpun tawng lang ai"" which means ""She threw a stone at him and insulted him,"" accurately reflects the event described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi gaw mabyin shara hta rim hkrum ai** - ""She was angry and scolded him"" - While she was likely angry, the passage explicitly mentions a stone being thrown and an insult, not just scolding.
* **B: Shi gaw dinglun ai hpe yin la ai** - ""She was defending him"" - This is the opposite of what happened.
* **D: Shi tsun ai gaw soi ndum ni hte shi hpe kabai ai** - ""Her sister was with him and comforted him"" - This is also the opposite of what happened; she insulted him.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, npu e jaw da ai hta na gara wa gaw Blake kaw n byin hkra ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shi htawng de mahkoi sa hkrum na re lam shi hpe tsun ai**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Tara agyi gaw Blake hpe tsun ai, dai gaw """"""gara hku mung koi yen nmai ai"""""" re she hpe hkyuk htawng de sa kau sa na."" This translates to: ""The speaker told Blake, and he said, 'It's not a matter of fighting, it's a matter of dealing with the issue.'""

* **Therefore:** Blake's response indicates he wants to **deal with the problem through diplomacy or negotiation, rather than through fighting.** Option D directly reflects this meaning: ""He said to deal with the issue through the proper channel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi hta tara rapra lam hta tara tawt lai ai lam hpe mu lu ai:** This means ""He avoided the direct path."" This doesn't align with Blake's stated intention to deal with the issue.
* **B: Shi gaw rim hkrum ai:** This means ""He was responsible."" While Blake might be responsible, the text doesn't state his *intention* regarding how to handle the situation.
* **C: Shi gaw hpun tawng hte gayet hkrum ai:** This means ""He was angry and dealt with it forcefully."" This is the opposite of what Blake said.



"
U.N a mungkan du hkra ladaw gahtet wa ai hte seng nna karum gumhpraw ni hpe hpa lam a matu n jai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nam si ni kaba wa na lam**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""What is the reason that the UN's two-thirds majority doesn't work to address the issues?""

The passage states: ""Nam tsi ni kaba wa na hte hka atsawm jai lang na, hka nshang ai nta ni hpe galaw na matu gumhpraw hkan ra ai.""  This translates to: ""Because of the differences in feelings, the spirit of self-interest prevents them from moving forward to work together.""

Therefore, the reason the UN's majority isn't working is due to differences in feelings and self-interest.  ""Nam si ni kaba wa na lam"" means ""Because of differences in feelings.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Rawt jat ai mungdan ni hta ladat hpaji sharin ya ai:** This means ""Because of the differences in the approach to address problems."" While related, it's not the primary reason for the lack of progress according to the passage.
* **C: Hka n shang ai nta ni:** This means ""Because of the spirit of self-interest."" This is partially correct, but option A encompasses the broader context.
* **D: Mungkan kahtet wa ai lam hpe shayawm lu na lam:** This means ""Because the path that the majority wants to take is not clear.""  The passage doesn't mention anything about the path being unclear, but rather about the differences in feelings hindering cooperation.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, U.N gaw hpa hpe lu hkye la na matu myit mada ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Hka atsawm sha n jai lang ai majaw hkra machyi ai masha ni**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks *why* the UN has not prevented the situation.
* **The passage (P)** describes a situation where people are suffering and being displaced (""ngam nga ai nam maling ni hpe hkang zing na lam""). It mentions the UN (UN) and its role in protecting people (""hparan na matu hkrum sha ai mungdan ni hpe karum na matu karum gumhpraw hpe lu na matu myit mada ai"").
* **The passage continues** by saying the people are feeling helpless and frustrated (""Nam tsi ni kaba wa na hte hka atsawm jai lang na, hka nshang ai nta ni hpe galaw na matu gumhpraw hkan ra ai"").
* **Option D** directly reflects this feeling of helplessness and frustration, stating that people are feeling sad and are trying to find a way to deal with the situation (""Hka atsawm sha n jai lang ai majaw hkra machyi ai masha ni"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ladat hpaji garan gachyan ya ai kaw na lu ai gumhpraw** - This refers to the lack of proper governance or authority, which is a contributing factor but not the *reason* the UN hasn't intervened.
* **B: Nam si ni** - This is nonsensical and doesn't relate to the passage or the question.
* **C: Naw ngam taw ai nam maling ni** - This translates to ""the people who are being displaced,"" which is a description of *who* is affected, not *why* the UN hasn't acted.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer as it aligns with the passage's depiction of the people's feelings of frustration and the UN's perceived lack of effective intervention."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw myit hkrum ai lam naw ra ai lama mi hku nna Albert Muchangan tsun mahta da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lama Benin gaw AfCTA de shang yang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""AU hpaga yumga lam hte jak rung a komishin salang Albert Muchanga gaw Benin mungdan mung ndai hpung kaw lawm wa na re ngu shana dat ai."" This translates to ""AU executive secretary Albert Muchanga met with Benin's government to discuss...""

The question asks what Albert Muchanga discussed with the government of Benin.  The passage directly answers that he discussed **joining the AfCFTA**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hpaga ga ai lam hpang mai ai shani** (The path of peace and development) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Npawt na htung tara ni** (The next few days) - While the passage mentions a deadline, it doesn't state they discussed the *timeframe* specifically.
* **D: Ahkun hkanse masat shadang hpe shayawm ya ai lam** (The path to promoting sustainable development) - This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, bungli galaw ai hpe July shata hta hpa majaw hpang mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: July shata hpang ai shani gaw AfCFTA hta shang lawm na matu Nigeria ni masat da ai lam rai nga ai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""2020 July shata 1 ya shani hta bungli galaw hpang na matu mai nga ai."" This translates to ""The free movement of goods is scheduled to begin on July 1, 2020.""
* It further mentions Nigeria's commitment to participating in the AfCFTA.
* Therefore, option A directly reflects the information about the date the free movement of goods was supposed to begin under the AfCFTA, which Nigeria was committed to.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai hta tara ni hte hkan sa ra ai hkrang nhprang ni alaw ahtam nga ai** (This translates to ""This is a total number of days and the number of days the agreement is valid for"").  The passage doesn't provide information about the validity period of the agreement.
* **C: AU hpaga hte jak rung ginwang du hku na myit hkrum lai wa sai** (This translates to ""The African Union is committed to helping member states""). While true, this is a general statement and not directly answering the question about the July 1st date.
* **D: Ritkawp ni hte ahkun hkanse hkan sa ya ai lam hpe mung myit hkrum sai** (This translates to ""The free movement of goods and the development of economic ties will be the way for member states to develop""). This is another general statement and doesn't specifically answer the question about the July 1st date.

(In response to this situation, the government enacted regulations to address the decline in real estate prices.  Furthermore, these regulations led to a decrease in the number of foreclosures. The number of foreclosures decreased to 34 per week by 2013.)

This clearly links the decline in the real estate market to government regulations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nam laika hpaji hpe gin shalat ai lam n galaw ai majaw** (Measures taken to prevent the spread of the financial crisis) - While there might have been broader economic measures, the text focuses specifically on the real estate market in Atlanta.
* **C: Mu tam tawn da ai kata lam na manghkang ni n hparan ai** (The protection of homeowners through various measures) -  While foreclosure reduction *benefits* homeowners, the text focuses on the *reason* for the foreclosure reduction (government regulations in response to the real estate decline).
* **D: Grai n law ai amat ni hpe tang madun ai** (The rise in the number of foreclosures) - The text states the *opposite* - a *decline* in foreclosures.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta jaw da ai lam hta mahta nna, Atlanta shiga laika npawt nhpang upadi a tang shawn laika hta hpa hpe n tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ayan nre ai sanpoi mahtai rawt jat ai lam** (The road of the most rapidly increasing poverty).

Here's why:

The passage states that Atlanta's poverty rate increased significantly between 2009 and 2013.  It also mentions that the poverty rate was rapidly increasing.  Option A directly reflects this rapid increase in poverty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Sanpoi laika pa hpe jahten hkrum ai sakse ni** (The ability to control the increasing poverty). The passage doesn't discuss efforts to control poverty, only its rise.
* **C: 2013 ning na Amyu sha hte seng hpareng ai wa** (The poverty rate in 2013 and the US). While 2013 is mentioned, the question asks about the *road* of the increasing poverty, not just a specific year.  Also, the US poverty rate isn't the primary focus.
* **D: Nam laika hpaji hpe galaw wa ai hte seng na hpaji jaw ai lam** (The road of the rapidly changing poverty and the road of the declining poverty). The passage focuses on *increasing* poverty, not a changing or declining one.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, bawm kapaw ngut ai hpang hpa shiga ni hpe na lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Gara wahpang ni a makau hta bawm kapaw ai**.

Here's the breakdown:

* **The Question (Q) asks:** ""What is the reason that the water rises and overflows the banks of the river, causing damage to the fields?""
* **The Passage (P) describes:**  The passage details a situation where a river overflows its banks and causes flooding, damaging fields and homes. It mentions heavy rain. It also says the river usually rises 30 lahta (approximately 300 feet) and doesn't overflow under normal conditions.
* **Option B directly addresses the cause:**  ""Gara wahpang ni a makau hta bawm kapaw ai"" translates to ""Due to heavy rain, the water overflows the riverbanks."" This directly aligns with the information presented in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hpang jahtum hkra machyi la ai ni a jahpan** translates to ""The day when the heavy rain starts from the mountains and descends to Japan."" This is geographically incorrect. The passage doesn't mention Japan.
* **C: Lama kahtap nna bawm ni kapaw wa na** translates to ""Due to the river being blocked by debris and overflowing."" While debris *could* contribute, the passage primarily focuses on the heavy rain as the main cause.
* **D: Tara shang si hkrum masha** translates to ""Due to the normal level of the river's height.""  This is the opposite of what the passage describes. The river doesn't overflow under normal circumstances.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer.

"2017 ning hta Manchester City hta shang wa ai kaw nna, Jesus kaw poi kade hpe ginsup wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 24**.

The passage states: ""Dai ten kaw na, Brazil masha ni gaw shingjawng hpawng lamang shagu hta kalap mung a matu shingjawng lamang 53 lajang da nna shang ai bawlung htihkum 24 lu lai wa sai re."" This translates to: ""At that time, Brazil's national team, among the players who participated in the 2017 Confederations Cup, had 53 players with a main team playing experience, and 24 of them were from Manchester City.""

Therefore, Jesus (referring to Gabriel Jesus) had 24 teammates from Manchester City who also played in the Confederations Cup.
"
Gara club hta shang ai majaw Jesus gaw wan £27 lu la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The passage states: ""Dai ten kaw na, Brazil masha ni gaw shingjawng hpawng lamang shagu hta kalap mung a matu shingjawng lamang 53 lajang da nna shang ai bawlung htihkum 24 lu lai wa sai re. **Manchester City de shabrai wan £27 hte shang wa sai.**""

This translates to: ""Later, the Brazilian national team, in a friendly match, defeated the national team with 53 goals to 24. **Manchester City paid £27 for him.**""

Therefore, Jesus was transferred to Manchester City for £27.
"
Gara ndau ai lam gaw manam jarawp kata na manam ni hte seng na n jaw ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Manam ni gaw hajj a matu sa du taw ai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Hajj pilgrimage is a religious duty for Muslims who are physically and financially able.
* Option C directly reflects this by saying ""Manam ni gaw hajj a matu sa du taw ai"" which translates to ""A righteous person performs Hajj"". 
* Option A is incorrect because it focuses on the destination (Mecca) but not the act of pilgrimage itself.
* Option B is incorrect because it talks about nationality and financial status, which are conditions for Hajj, but doesn't define what a righteous person *does*.
* Option D is incorrect because it refers to the general idea of being a righteous person, but doesn't specify the religious act.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta ka da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara ndau lam gaw jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Manam ni gaw hajj pilgrimage a matu du sa ma ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dai nta htingtsip gaw hajj pilgrimage kaw na chyoi pra ai mare de nawku na matu du sa ai bu hkawm ai ni hpe nga shara jaw da ai."" (The next step is to choose a country to go to for the Hajj pilgrimage.)

* **Option C directly reflects this statement.** It says the country (referring to the ""manam ni"" - the country mentioned earlier) is a place to perform the Hajj pilgrimage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Matsing masat ga yan hta ka da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara ndau lam gaw jaw ai rai?** (What is the process and what should be done before going to the country?) This is a general question and not a specific answer to what the country is for.
* **B: Manam ni yawng gaw United Arab Emirates kaw na du sa ai ni re** (The country is the United Arab Emirates.) While the passage mentions the UAE, it doesn't explicitly say the country *is* the UAE. It just says the country's large population is from there.
* **D: Malawng manam ni gaw Mecca mung masha ni re** (The country's large population is in Mecca.) The passage states the country's large population is in the UAE, not Mecca. Mecca is a city within Saudi Arabia.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, adawt ai lam hte seng nna gara shiga gaw n teng ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Adawt ai lam gaw mungkan ga hpe akyu jaw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Shanhte gaw dai ga gakaprang ai gaw kade kaba ai ngut nna mungkan hta kade hkra na hpe mara yu taw ma ai."" This translates to ""Those who don't know the rules don't dare to go to the beginning and don't dare to go to the end.""
* **The question asks:** ""Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, adawt ai lam hte seng nna gara shiga gaw n teng ai rai?"" This translates to ""If someone is afraid, why do they hesitate to enter the path and not step into the other side?""

Option C directly addresses this by saying ""Adawt ai lam gaw mungkan ga hpe akyu jaw ai"" which translates to ""The path to action is often blocked by fear."" This aligns with the passage's implication that fear prevents people from taking necessary steps.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adawt ai shara a hkrang shadang:** ""The path to action is already blocked."" This is too definitive and doesn't account for the hesitation caused by fear.
* **B: Adawt ai shara:** ""The path to action."" This is too general and doesn't explain the hesitation.
* **D: Adaw achyen ni a shara:** ""The rule of the ancient people."" This is irrelevant to the question about personal hesitation.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, adawt ai lam hte seng na hpa ni naw dawdan ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mayun hpaji daw ai san jep lu ai mahtai ni hpe gara hku bai garan ya na**

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the dangers of online scams and fraudulent websites.** It mentions people being tricked into sending money and losing it.
* **The question asks how to avoid being scammed.**
* **Option C directly addresses this by suggesting to be cautious of suspicious websites offering seemingly good deals.**  The passage explicitly states that online scams often involve fake websites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Adaw achyen ni hpe hkan tam na matu kadai lit la na (Avoid being easily persuaded).** While being cautious is important, this is a general statement and doesn't directly address the specific danger described in the passage (online scams).
* **B: Adawt hkrup ai shaloi jak shagan ni kade ram chyang nna hkawm taw nga ai lam (Be cautious when dealing with strangers).**  This is relevant to general safety, but the passage is focused on *online* interactions, not just strangers in general.
* **D: Adawt ai lam hte seng na tup hkrang shadawn shadang (Don't be easily distracted).** This is unrelated to avoiding online scams.



Therefore, **C** is the most relevant and accurate answer based on the provided passage.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Batten gaw American na lauban dik jahpan hta lawm ai shaloi gara shara kaw nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: 190th**.

The passage states: ""Batten gaw 2008 hta 190th tsang madang hta nga ai..."" which translates to ""Batten was 190th in the 2008..."".  Therefore, Batten was 190th.
"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe Batten karum ai lam galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: American a lu su dik htum ni a jahpan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""American a lu su dik 4000 jahpan hta lawm nna ntsa lam maram da ai gaw billion $2.3 nga ai."" This translates to ""The American-led forces fought against Japan, spending $2.3 billion."" This directly links the money spent to the war against Japan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Virginia Dakkasu:** While Virginia Dakkasu is mentioned as a location where old buildings were demolished, it doesn't explain where the money spent during the war went.
*   **C: Law htam la ai jawng ni:** This refers to a general time period (the 1950s) and doesn't specifically link to where the money was spent.
*   **D: Shingni hte hpungtang hpaji sharin ya ai college ni:** This refers to the demolition of buildings in a university and is unrelated to the war expenditure.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**, as the passage explicitly states the money was spent on the war effort against Japan."

Here's why:

The question asks about what Arnold Schwarzenegger did regarding the California oil crisis. The provided text states: ""...California mungdaw hta mazut ai sumla hkrung ginsup ai lam ni dut ai lam hta """"""18"""""""" mai hti ai ngu masat shakap ra na hte ninghkap ai wa hpe mara loi jaw ai hku na $1000 dam jahkrat let dut ra na upadi nhprang ra nga ai.""

This translates to: ""...California was facing an oil crisis, and Arnold Schwarzenegger stepped in and spoke out for 18 days, advocating for a solution and demanding $1000 per person as compensation for those affected.""

Option C accurately reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Doesn't mention Arnold Schwarzenegger's actions regarding the oil crisis.
*   **B:** Talks about a general ""law"" but doesn't specify what that law is or Schwarzenegger's role.
*   **D:** Refers to the ""oil's date"" which is irrelevant to Schwarzenegger's actions.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, kadai gaw tsun tawn ai lam ni hpe tat kau ai ni rai?","The answer is **C: Miller**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Miller tsun ai gaw, """"""Madat la ai ten hta Mike gaw ga grai shaga ai... dai majaw shi hpa ni tsun taw ai hpe ngai atsam nna dat ai."""""" This translates to: ""Miller said, 'Even if Mike is not good, he will be good in the future... and I will bring him to a better place.'""

This directly indicates that Miller is the one speaking and making the statements about Mike. Therefore, the question ""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, kadai gaw tsun tawn ai lam ni hpe tat kau ai ni rai?"" (Who is talking and saying that, and who is saying that he will be good in the future?) is answered by Miller.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, madat la ai ten hta Miller na mahkrum madup hte seng nna npu e jaw da ai gara gaw jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Duvall gaw madat la ai ahkying hta Miller hpe nhtang kaba hkun wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Duvall, ma lahkawng hte hkumran ai, gaw Miller na matu myit grai ngang lu ai re, dai mawng moi hte seng ai ni a matu.""  This means Duvall, despite having a strong background and experience, didn't trust Miller.
* **Miller's words:** ""Madat la ai ten hta Mike gaw ga grai shaga ai... dai majaw shi hpa ni tsun taw ai hpe ngai atsam nna dat ai.""  Miller said something about Mike (presumably Duvall) being suspicious and wanting to be tested.
* **The question asks:** What was the reason Duvall didn't trust Miller?  The answer is that Duvall *didn't trust Miller from the beginning* (madat la ai ahkying hta Miller hpe nhtang kaba hkun wa ai).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi gaw shi shajin ai aten hta maju jung ai lam n nga taw ai:** This translates to ""He went and talked to someone about his own troubles."" The passage doesn't mention Duvall talking about his troubles to anyone.
* **C: Duvall a kasha lahkawng gaw madat la ai aten hta ga grai shaga ai:** This translates to ""Duvall's experience was suspicious from the beginning."" The passage states Duvall *didn't trust* Miller, not that his experience was suspicious.
* **D: Shi gaw Duvall tsun ai mau mwi hta myit maju jung taw ai:** This translates to ""He went and talked to Duvall about his own words."" There's no indication Duvall spoke to anyone *about* Miller's words.

"""""""Nbung jasan ai magam bungli” hpe bai gram na matu kadai gaw hpaji jaw ai rai?""","The correct answer is **A: John Howard**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Raitim Hkring mang Daju John Howard ka tara upadi..."" which translates to ""Prime Minister John Howard and his party..."" This directly links the ""nbung jasan ai magam bungli"" (which translates roughly to ""unworthy/disgraceful/shameful act"") to John Howard.
"
"""“Nbung jasan ai magam bungli"""" gaw ra lata poi ndu shi ai ten masha ni myit lawm hkra galaw lam re nguhpe kadai ninghkap ai rai?""","The correct answer is **B: Hkringmang daju (Conservative Party)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Stephen Harper's party, the ""Hkringmang daju"" (Conservative Party), used the phrase ""nbung jasan ai magam bungli"" (a phrase referring to a ""fictitious and exaggerated"" situation) to criticize the Labour Party (NDP) and the government's handling of the Devonport/Mersey runway issue.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mung up asuya (Tasmanian government):** While the Tasmanian government was involved in the runway issue, the phrase was used *by the Conservative Party* to criticize the government.
* **C: NDP ningbaw (Labour Party):** The phrase was *directed at* the Labour Party, not a description of them.
* **D: Gin jaw asuya hte seng ai MP (MP who is critical of the government and refuses to cooperate):** While some MPs might fit this description, the phrase itself is specifically linked to the Conservative Party's criticism.



"
Cyanuric e sit hte melamine gumhpawn gaw nyau jit hta shan lahkawng shada dat hkra hkat yang hpa hkrang byin pru wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Infrared spectroscopy**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Ndai shagan hkyi lung a gahkyin ai lam gaw Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) hte shing daw yang nta rem dusat a jit kaw rawng ai rai hte wa bung ai.""

This translates to: ""The method used to identify the compound based on its properties is Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and other analytical techniques.""

Therefore, Infrared spectroscopy is the method described in the text for identifying the cyanuric acid and melamine compound.
"
Infrared spectroscopy hpe sawk tam ninghkrin ni hpa na sawk tam na matu lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dusat ni a jit hta shagan hkyi lung sha ni gayau ai lam (The surface where the substance is heated)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai shagan hkyi lung a gahkyin ai lam gaw Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) hte shing daw yang nta rem dusat a jit kaw rawng ai rai hte wa bung ai."" This translates to: ""The surface where the substance is heated is analyzed by Infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and other methods to identify the compounds.""  Therefore, FTIR analysis focuses on the *heated surface* of the sample.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sinde a bungli (The side of the container):** While the container is important, FTIR doesn't directly analyze the container's side. It focuses on the sample's surface.
* **C: Dusat ni hpe akyu jaw ai (The substance being analyzed):**  The passage doesn't imply FTIR *directly* analyzes the substance itself, but rather its surface after heating.
* **D: N kaja ai nta rem dusat ni a shat (The temperature at which the substance is heated):** While temperature is crucial in FTIR, the *location* of the analysis is the surface.

Therefore, option B accurately reflects what the passage says about FTIR analysis.

The text states: """"Tommy Dreamer tsun lai wa ai gaw, """"""""Luna gaw alat ningshawng hkawmhkam shayi re."""""""""" This translates to ""Tommy Dreamer said, 'Luna is a very versatile tool.'""

Therefore, Tommy Dreamer is the one who said Luna is a ""versatile tool.""
"
"""Kadai gaw Luna hpe """"freaky"""" ngu tsun ai rai?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels ni**.

Here's why:

* The text clearly states, ""Dustin """"""Goldust"""""" Runnels ka da ai gaw """"""""Luna gaw ngai zawn sha masha hte nau nbung ai… ngai hta grau yang grau na… shi hpe tsawra ai, shi hpe dum nga ai… shi grau kaja ai shara hta lu nga u ga ngu myit mada ai."""""" This translates to ""Dustin 'Goldust' Runnels said, 'Luna is very strange and weird... she really scares me... I fear her, I hate her... she makes me feel uneasy.'""  ""Strange"" and ""weird"" are close to the meaning of ""freaky.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi hpe ngun jaw ai ni** (She said it) - The text doesn't attribute the ""freaky"" comment to Luna herself.
* **C: Mung up asuya a sawk tam ninghkrin ni** (Someone who has seen a lot of fights) - This is irrelevant to who called Luna ""freaky.""
* **D: Tommy Dreamer** - Tommy Dreamer says, ""Luna is a strange and unpredictable person. She is a person who has been tormented by the darkness of the past. She has suffered a lot of pain in her life."" While he describes Luna as strange, he doesn't use the word ""freaky.""

* **The passage states:** ""Shi hpe hpang chyhtum Cambridge kaw na Addenbrooke de shara htawt kau ai. Great Yarmouth na James Paget Tsi rung kaw shi hpe shawng gawn lajang tsi hpang wa ai.""  This translates to: ""He was taken to Cambridge for treatment and then transferred to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi gaw baw kaw ningma lu mat ai** (He was taken to a place where he couldn't get treatment) - The passage clearly states he *was* taken to places for treatment.
* **B: Nta kata na masha kadai mung n machyi hkrum la ai** (He was treated by a certain doctor) -  The passage doesn't mention a specific doctor.
* **D: Ahkyak karum ya ai hpung ni gaw shi hpe mawdaw kata kaw na karum shaw la ma ai** (The hospital's building wasn't taken by the vehicle) - This is irrelevant to the main point of where he received treatment.

The question asks what is a key element of the Dingda Africa rugby style. The passage directly links ""bawlung hpe jum lang ai hpaji"" (a raised face/shouting) to their warrior-like style.  The other options are not mentioned as key characteristics of their rugby.



"
"Matsing masat gayan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Dingda Afrika a ginsup poi gaw gara ten hta rawt jat wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Jahpawt hkying 10 laman** (10 hours in the morning).

The question asks about the time the game starts, and the passage directly answers this. The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Grai ngang hkra ninghkap ginsup lu ai hpang** (The game is not a completely new game): While possibly true, the passage doesn't explicitly say this.
* **C: Zambia hpe sum mat ai hpang** (The game is played in Zambia): The passage mentions Zambia scoring, but doesn't state the game is played *in* Zambia.
* **D: Shingjawng poi matut galaw taw ai shaloi** (The game is a match of diverse movement): This describes the nature of the game, not the start time.

* **The passage states:** ""Shaning hkun ning daram hta Miwa a GDP gaw United States na hta grau law wa chye ai re."" (In the following years, China's GDP grew rapidly and surpassed that of the United States.)
* **Option B directly reflects this:** ""Miwa ni na mawdaw shapraw dut ai gat lawk gaw United States hta grau kaba ai"" (China's economy grew rapidly and surpassed that of the United States).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gram lajang ai ni galaw ngut ai hpang Miwa ni a sut masa gaw grai rawt jat wa ai** (The economic reforms initiated by Deng Xiaoping led to a rapid increase in China's GDP). While true, this doesn't answer *how* China's GDP surpassed the US.
* **C: Miwa ni gaw hpang jahtum hta United State ni hta na grau kaba ai GDP hpe lu mat ai** (China's GDP surpassed the GDP of the United States in the following years). This is a restatement of the passage, not an answer to the question.
* **D: Miwa ni gaw Germany ni hta grau nna mawdaw n lu shapraw ai** (China's economy grew by following the path of Germany). This is incorrect. The passage explicitly mentions Deng Xiaoping's reforms and the surpassing of the US GDP, not emulation of Germany.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Miwa mung a GDP gaw United States ni hta galoi ten lai kau da sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpaga lam ni hpe gram lajang ngut ai hpang (Focus on the development of the economy)**.

Here's why:

The text states that under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, China focused on economic development, leading to a 90% increase in GDP.  This growth allowed China's GDP to rise significantly compared to the United States.  The key driver was a *focus on economic growth*.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Shi ning ladaw lahkawng laman (Leveraging foreign capital):** While foreign capital might have played a role, the text primarily highlights internal economic development. It doesn't emphasize relying heavily on foreign investment as the *main* reason.
* **C: Mungdan gaw ningnan woi awn ai lam a npu de du mat ai ten (Exploiting natural resources):**  The text doesn't specifically mention exploiting natural resources as the primary driver of GDP growth.
* **D: Shi ning ladaw masum laman (Utilizing advanced technology):** While technology is important, the text focuses more on broad economic development rather than specific technological advancements as the core reason for the GDP increase.

Rawt jat ai mungdan ni galaw ai hpa hpe Hu gaw hpaji jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shanhte a rawt jat lam madang hpe kanawng ya ai lam hpe lit la u**

* **The text states:** ""Hu gaw mungkan ga ntsa kaw na nbung hpe nmasa na gaw shawng re ngut nna san seng gai gaw hpang re ngu tsun nna ya she galu gaba wa ai mungdan ni hpe ngun jaw ai.""  This translates to: ""Hu, in order to avoid the increasing burden of environmental pollution and the depletion of resources caused by rapid economic growth, is striving to achieve the goals of sustainable development.""

* **""Rawt jat lam madang hpe kanawng ya ai lam hpe lit la u""** translates to ""He is striving to achieve goals that avoid rapid economic growth"". This directly reflects Hu's efforts to avoid the negative consequences of rapid economic expansion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hpaga hta arang bang ai lam hpe maju jung u** - ""He is developing in a direction that prioritizes height"" (referring to building tall structures). This is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Shanhte a ya na bungli ni hta jan nna galaw sa u** - ""He is promoting the development of people in the Shan state."" This is not the main focus of Hu's actions according to the text.
* **D: N kaja ai lam dingsa ni hpe koi u** - ""He is koi-ing in a direction of seeking benefit for himself."" This contradicts the text, which portrays Hu as striving for sustainable development.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of Hu's motivations as described in the provided text.

The text states: ""Hu gaw mungkan ga ntsa kaw na nbung hpe nmasa na gaw shawng re ngut nna san seng gai gaw hpang re ngu tsun nna ya she galu gaba wa ai mungdan ni hpe ngun jaw ai.""  This translates to: ""Hu is the place where the consumption of fossil fuels for the production of energy and other things has been increasing, leading to the release of greenhouse gases.""

Option B accurately reflects this: ""N kaja ai nbung hte seng na rawt jat ai mungdan ni hpe hpaji jaw ai lam"" means ""The path of increasing the consumption of fossil fuels and other things"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Di la ai lam ni a npawt madung** (The path of the current situation being bad): The text doesn't explicitly state the situation is *bad*, only that there's an increase in fossil fuel consumption.
* **C: Carbon htuk shapraw ai hpe shayawm lu na ngu myit mada ai shani** (The future of a world without carbon emissions): The text focuses on the *present* increase in emissions.
* **D: Carbon htuk shapraw yawm mat ai a hkrang sumla** (The total amount of carbon emissions):  While the text mentions greenhouse gases, it doesn't give a specific number for total emissions.

The question asks ""Lawu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe masa n kaja ai re ngu Veerman tsun wa sai rai?"" which translates to ""Who is the person Veerman is working with to help people?""

The text states: ""Medecines Sans Frontiere Richrad Veerman a shiga dap kaw na masha tsun ai gaw..."" which translates to ""Richrad Veerman of Medecines Sans Frontieres is working with...""

Therefore, the answer is Medecines Sans Frontieres.
"
"Tara soi ai lam a majaw, Huhne a Hkringmang shara hta kadai bai shara la na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Huhne gaw pru mat sai rai nna hkringmang hpung na shi shara kaw MP Ed Davey hpe galai bang na re.""  This translates to: ""Huhne (Huhne) was pressured to take the blame, and MP Ed Davey was involved in the scandal.""

Therefore, Ed Davey is the one implicated in the scandal related to Huhne's actions.
"
Tara gang ai ten hta kadai hpe hpaga hte seng ai hkringmang hku na myit la na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Huhne**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Huhne gaw pru mat sai rai nna hkringmang hpung na shi shara kaw MP Ed Davey hpe galai bang na re."" This translates to ""Huhne was seen in an argument with MP Ed Davey.""

The question asks who was seen arguing. Therefore, the answer is Huhne.
"
Camille Saint-Saen ni a gamung lanya hta shangwi shapyaw ai ni gaw poi yu masha ni hpe hpa galaw na matu n-gun jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Japan de hkrun lam hkawm hkun ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""shi prat hpe nanghpam tsi hte Japan mungdan hpe tsawra ai myit hte madun mat ai"" which translates to ""He (Camille Saint-Saens) moved to Japan and lived there for a long time.""

The question asks *why* Camille Saint-Saens lived in Japan for a long time.  The passage directly answers this with the statement about moving and living there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cannabis nanghpam htunghpyi hpe lu sha hkun ai** (He was addicted to cannabis and smoked it): The passage doesn't mention anything about drug use.
* **C: Shanhte hte rau pinra ntsa hta shangwi shapyaw na matu shaga ai** (He was involved in a scandal involving women and affairs):  There's no information in the passage to support this.
* **D: Shanhte a asak ni hpe shanhte ra ai hku dawdan ya ai** (He was deeply in love with a Shan woman and went to great lengths for her): The passage doesn't mention any romantic relationships, let alone with a Shan woman.



Therefore, the only answer directly supported by the provided text is **B**."
Yungwi kamung hta kadai ni gaw nanghpam hka yawm hpe madung lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkrang shala dan ai ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mahtai hku na, hkrang shala dan ai ni gaw nanghpan lu dan ai ngut nna yu ai ni myit grai shang sha wa matu dai hku galaw ai re.""

This translates to: ""However, the days of the past, the days when the musical world was not influenced by the French, were filled with a slow and dull movement.""

Therefore, the answer is the ""hkrang shala dan ai ni"" which means ""days when the musical world was not influenced by the French.""
"
"""Leonov hkrang shala mat ai """"lamu hpungtang kaw langai hkrai hkawm sa ai"""" a kaga mying gaw hpa rai?""","The correct answer is **C: EVA lamang**.

Here's why:

The question asks what Leonov's ""historic achievement of being the first to conduct a spacewalk"" refers to. The text explicitly states that in 1965, he performed the first ""EVA"" (Extravehicular Activity - spacewalk) lasting 12 minutes.

* **A: Apollo-Soyuz lit magam gun hpung** (Apollo-Soyuz mission era) - This is a later event in his career, not the first spacewalk.
* **B: Ganghkau hte seng ai shingjawng poi** (A kind of space suit) - While related, the question refers to the *achievement* of the spacewalk itself, not the suit.
* **C: EVA lamang** (Spacewalk) - This directly refers to the activity Leonov performed that was historic.
* **D: Cosmonaut No. 11** - This is his designation, not the achievement itself.



Therefore, the answer is **C**."
Lenovo gaw gara lit lamang na Soviet daw hpe woi awn wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Shi ning na ai hpang, she gaw Apollo-Soyuz lit la lamang na Soviet daw hpe masat dingsat let Lamu ganghkau Gashun ai lam htum sai ngu woi awn mat ai.""  This translates to: ""Because of this, he participated in the first joint space flight between the Soviet Union and the US, the Apollo-Soyuz mission.""

Therefore, the answer is Apollo-Soyuz.
"
Dai adawt ai lam hta kadai kala nba hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Kadaw kadan byin ngut ai hte **Gibson** hpe tsi rung de htaw sa mat ai..."" which translates to ""The day's events are... and **Gibson** is being watched...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mawdaw dum hta bungli galaw ai wa** (The moving of the trunk to the side) - This is a description of an action, not something that is being watched.
*   **C: Ma ni** (Not good) - This is a statement of quality, not an entity being watched.
*   **D: Mawdaw gawt ai wa** (The moving of the trunk) - Similar to B, this is an action.



"
Dai mabyin hta lawm ai masha ni hpa byin mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shanhte gaw marawn nna hkrap taw ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai hta e lam nmaw lai na la taw ai ma ni nga taw ai, shanhte yawng gaw marawn hkrap nga ma ai."" This translates to: ""Those who are about to be caught, those who are caught, the Shan people are already being beaten.""

Therefore, the question asks what is the reason the Shan people are being beaten? The passage directly states it: they are being beaten because they are already caught and being arrested. Option C reflects this meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shanhkawng yen si mat ai (The river is dying):** This is irrelevant to the passage.
*   **B: Langai gaw hpa nhkra la ai, langai gaw si mat ai (The forest is being cut down, the forest is dying):**  This is also irrelevant to the passage.
*   **D: Lahkawng yen nma ni lu wa ai (The water is not clear):** This is irrelevant to the passage.



"
Program hte bungli galaw ai hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni gaw npu e jaw da ai lam ni kaw nna byin pru wa na gara akyu jaw ai lam hpe mu tam na matu myit mada taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dark matter**.

Here's why:

The passage describes dark matter as:

*   ""laga dark matter ni galaw ai zawn galaw ai ngu chyhtum hta tsun wa ai"" -  a type of dark matter that moves in a way that influences the movement of visible matter.
*   ""mali shingna makau na htat chyang ai hkrang rai ni gaw mali shingna makau na shingkang nhtoi hpan kata kaw nga nga ai re nna shing-yun shing-yaw kaji grai law wa mi hte galaw da ai re"" -  a type of dark matter that significantly influences the movement of galaxies and stars.

The question asks what type of matter's movement is crucial for understanding the galaxy's structure.  The passage focuses on *dark matter*'s influence on galactic movement, specifically the movement of stars and galaxies around the Milky Way's center, and its role in the formation of the Milky Way's structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Regular matter:** The passage discusses *dark matter*, not regular (visible) matter.
*   **B: Myit shang sha ai lam ni:** This refers to the path of the Milky Way, not a type of matter.
*   **C: Shingrun kaji ni:** This refers to the movement of stars, but the passage focuses on the *influence of dark matter* on that movement.



"
Hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni gaw npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara mabyin hpe sawk tam wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagittarious galaxy hte Milky Way**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Dai tam ai uhpang gaw galaxy's dark matter hte Milky Way's dark matter ni a myit shang sha ai lam ni a majaw byin wa ai."" (The dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way are in the same place and moving together.) and ""Shata wa mungkan ga hpe gang ai shaloi hkaleng ni byin wa ai zawn Milky way mung Sagittarius mali shingna hpe nang ai n-gun nga ai."" (The Milky Way and Sagittarius are galaxies that are moving together in the direction of the Milky Way's Sagittarius arm.)

Therefore, the passage discusses the relationship between the Sagittarius galaxy and the Milky Way. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they don't include both of these galaxies.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, hpa baw hpe mung ding htung hkan ai ni n mai ding lun ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Kadai gaw bai gawgap na ga shaka ni hpe shagrau hkrum ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The Question:** ""Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, hpa baw hpe mung ding htung hkan ai ni n mai ding lun ai rai?"" translates to: ""What is the main point of the text, what is it emphasizing?""
* **The Text's Main Idea:** The text describes the ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"" as a measure to *rebuild* New Orleans after a disaster.  It highlights the efforts to repair damaged infrastructure and rebuild the city's economy.  It emphasizes the government's intention to *support and aid* the city's recovery.
* **Option C Breakdown:**
    * ""Kadai gaw bai gawgap na ga shaka ni hpe shagrau hkrum ai lam"" translates to: ""The main point is the government's effort to support and aid the city's recovery.""
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Asak hkye ai lam hta lang ai gumhpraw** (The efforts to rebuild the damaged infrastructure) - This is *part* of the main idea, but not the core point.  It's a detail.
    * **B: Bai gawgap ai lam n nga ai lam** (The rebuilt city and the government) -  This is too general.  It doesn't capture the *action* or the *purpose* behind the rebuilding.
    * **D: Bai gawgap ai lam hta jai ai gumhpraw** (The focus of the rebuilt city's efforts) - This doesn't accurately reflect the text's emphasis on government aid and recovery.

Therefore, option C best summarizes the central theme of the text."
Katrina a hurricane na asak hkye ai bungli ni a matu bai gawgap ai ga shaka ni hte seng na kadai dinglun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Myit dam lada ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is the reason for the gap between the needs of the affected people and the government's response. The text states: ""Bai gaw gap shakut shaja ai a myit dam lada ai dinglun lam gaw Washinton nga masha ni sadi maram lu na matu bai gaw gap ai myit hkrum ga shaka hpe shagrau sha a ai hta maju jung da ai.""  This translates to: ""The gap between the needs of the affected people and the government's response is due to the government's approach being slow and not proactive.""  ""Myit dam lada ai"" means ""slow"" or ""not proactive.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sut gumhpraw ni hpe hkang zing ai ni (Days of suffering):** While the hurricane caused suffering, this isn't the *reason* for the gap in response. It's the consequence.
* **C: Bush:**  The text mentions ""Bush's New Orleans Deal"" but doesn't directly attribute the gap to Bush himself. It attributes it to the government's overall *approach*.
* **D: Washington kata na ni (People of Washington):** The text refers to Washington (as in the capital) and the government's approach, not specifically the people of Washington.

Therefore, **Myit dam lada ai (slow/not proactive)** is the most accurate answer.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Stardust ganghkau li kaw nna ninghtoi ni hpe gara shara hta shawng nnan mu lu na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Ka-ang Oregon**.

The text states: ""Dai gaw dingda Kalifornia a sinna panglai de htawt mat na re ngut nna lamu kaw na jan gaw Kalifornia kaw na ka-ang Oregon du hkra ngut na Nevada hte Idaho, dai hpang Utah du hkra htoi tu na re."" This translates to: ""The location where Stardust landed was in the desert area of California, near the border with Oregon, and near Nevada and Idaho, and also near Utah."" Therefore, Stardust landed near Oregon.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara a matu ganghkau li gaw matsing masat na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mungkan ga de grai lawan ai hku bai wa na**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Stardust traveled ""12.8 km deng 8 daram mai du na ra ai, minit mi hta San Francisco kaw na Los Angeles de atsawm lawan mai du ai."" This describes the *distance* Stardust traveled *from* its starting point.
* The question asks about the *direction* Stardust traveled in relation to its starting point.
* Option C, ""Mungkan ga de grai lawan ai hku bai wa na"" (The direction it traveled is towards the sun), directly addresses the direction Stardust was moving *towards*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lamu a dam dik ai tsang shading de ninghtoi ttoi na** (The surface of the moon is a very dusty place): This is irrelevant to the direction of travel.
* **B: Mare kaba law malawng ni htamu lu na** (The moon has a very large crater):  This is also irrelevant to the direction of travel.
* **D: San Francisco kaw nna Los Angeles de lawan dik ai hku bu hkawm na** (Traveling in a straight line from San Francisco to Los Angeles): This describes a specific route, not the overall direction Stardust traveled.



"
Dr. Malar Balasubramanian gaw Saroja Balasubramanian hte gara hku matut manoi lam nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kanu**.

The passage states: ""Dai kaw, asak 53, Saroja Balasubramanian a hkum hpe shanhte mu wa ai, sai ni kap taw ai nbat hte magap da ai."" This translates to ""At that time, Saroja Balasubramanian, 53 years old, was divorced and had a son.""  Therefore, Dr. Malar Balasubramanian is Saroja Balasubramanian's **husband**.
"
Sara Balasubramanian a hkum sawp hpe gara kaw mu tam la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Lam makau hta** (Near the airport).

The text states: ""Ohio kaw na daru magam lu ai hpung ni tsun ai gaw, Pennsylvania mungdaw kaw na Pittsburgh ma tsi rung kaw bungli galaw lai wa ai tsi sara wun hpe gaw bat masum ya shi kanu ai mawdaw shingdu rai bang gawk kata kaw kanu si taw ai hpe mu ngut ai hpang kaw na gaw laja lana masha sat ai lam hku nna tara hka jun mat na re.

This translates to: ""In the early morning, Dr. Malar Balasubramanian left Ohio, Blue Ash, a 15-minute drive from Cincinnati, and went to the airport.""

Therefore, Sara Balasubramanian (Dr. Malar Balasubramanian's wife) went to the airport.
"
eBay gaw hpa tam mahkyu la lu ai rai?,"The answer is **C: Skype**. 

The passage states that eBay is used for buying and selling goods, and that Skype is used for communication across various regions (China, Europe, Brazil).  The question asks what eBay is *like*.  The passage directly links eBay to Skype as a communication tool. 

The other options (Microsoft, Apple, and Zoom) are not mentioned in the passage in relation to eBay.
"
eBay gaw tam mahkyu ai lam hte seng nna awngdang lam lu na matu hpa hpe tam taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shi a labau hpe shatsaw jat na** (It expands its market by entering new markets).

Here's why:

The passage states eBay is expanding its presence in countries like China, Spain, Europe, and Brazil.  This directly indicates they are entering **new markets**.  Expanding into new markets is a key way for a company to increase its reach and revenue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi a shang gumhpraw hpe shangang shakang na (It increases its operational efficiency):** While efficiency is important, the passage focuses on geographic expansion, not internal operational improvements.
* **B: Lamu ga nnan de maden wa na (It diversifies its product line):** The passage doesn't mention changes to the products offered. It's about *where* they are offering the products.
* **D: Shi a gambum madu ni hpe myitdik shangun na (It improves its customer service):** Again, customer service isn't the primary focus of the passage. It's about reaching new customers in new locations.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gasat poi hta ngam taw ai bawng masha ni hte kadai gaw hku hkau lam n galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Wan sat ai ni (Night time)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes activities happening at night:

*   ""MDT 10:00-11:00 pm lapran hta, Mana tsi rung wang kaw na wan shahkru dat ai re."" (From 10:00 pm to 11:00 pm, the Mana ceremony will be held.)
*   ""Kade nna yang, pyada du ni gaw makawp maga labu palawng bu hpun let dai sun de shang wa nna myi prwi dat nsa hte htawng rawng ni hpe gap shamawng dat ma ai."" (After work, you can rest and relax by watching movies and listening to music.)
*   ""Wan tsat ai ni gaw wan hpe aten 11:35 pm hta hka hte tsat kau sai."" (The night ends at 11:35 pm.)

Therefore, the question asks about the time when the activities described occur, which is **Wan sat ai ni (Night time)**.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara lam gaw hpang jahtum hta kasu kabrawng byin ai lam kaw na asum jaw na matu byin hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: myiprwi pru hkun ai dat nsa**.

Here's why:

The text describes the following:

* **MDT 10:00-11:00 pm lapran hta, Mana tsi rung wang kaw na wan shahkru dat ai re.** (From 10:00-11:00 pm, the ritual of invoking Mana will be performed.)
* **Kade nna yang, pyada du ni gaw makawp maga labu palawng bu hpun let dai sun de shang wa nna myi prwi dat nsa hte htawng rawng ni hpe gap shamawng dat ma ai.** (After that, the sacred ritual will be performed with offerings of flowers, incense, and other items.)
* **Wan tsat ai ni gaw wan hpe aten 11:35 pm hta hka hte tsat kau sai.** (The day will end at 11:35 pm.)

This clearly indicates that the ritual is performed with offerings of flowers, incense, and other items during the Mana invocation.  Therefore, the answer refers to **myiprwi pru hkun ai dat nsa** (sacred ritual offerings).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Awngdang ai bawng jahkrum ai ni** (General blessing day): While related to spiritual practices, it doesn't specifically describe the offerings made during the Mana ritual.
* **C: Ningma lu bawng masha shada** (Ningma's sacred mantra): This refers to a specific mantra practiced by the Ningma school, not the general offerings described.
* **D: Wan** (Day): This is too general and doesn't specify what happens during the ritual.

"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei a ningmu hta, Iran mungdan gaw gara kaw nashanglawt lu gying ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Islam makam masham hte seng ai rawt malan**.

The text states: ""...Ayatollah Ali Khamenei gaw wan sau a ntsa shamyet shanat ai lam gaw """"""mahkam"""""" re nga ai lam hpe, 1979 Iran mungdan Islam makam masham hte seng ai rawt malan ai lam a shawng aten kaw na htawng madun lai wa sai re nna mungdan ting nan mung dai mahkam kaw na lawt lu ra ai lam hpe mung htawng madun dan lai wa sai re.""

This translates to: ""...Ayatollah Ali Khamenei's strongly expressed opinion is that the ""court"" should punish those who break the Islamic law established in Iran in 1979 and are creating disorder in the country.""

Therefore, the answer is that Ayatollah Ali Khamenei believes Iran should punish those who violate Islamic law.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Iran amyu hpaga hte seng na galaw ahkang pat shingdang ai lam a akyu ni hpe kadai tsun pru wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Uropa Munghpawn**.

The text states: ""Iranian ni a maigan gumhpraw 80% shang ai kaw na maigan sa sau hpaga ga ai lam hpe Uropa Uhpung gaw ahkang njaw ai hte ja gumhpraw pat shingdang ai lam ni shalawm ma ai."" This translates to: ""80% of Iranian oil exports go to Europe and are the main source of income.""

Therefore, Europe is the entity that heavily relies on Iran's oil exports.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw France me jaw ai ladat hte n seng ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Me ni hpe shang shingjawng ai ni a dat kasa ni hku nna hti ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shang shingjawng ai ni hku nna amu lam yan yawng hpe myi mu sakse galaw shangun na matu dat kasa ni hpe mai sa dat ai re."" This translates to: ""After the days of the Shang Dynasty, the people began to imitate the clothing and customs of the dat kasa ni hku nna hti ai.""

The question asks what the clothing and customs the people began to imitate were. The passage directly links this imitation to the clothing and customs of France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mu lu ai me pung ni (The clothing of the Mu Lu people):** The passage doesn't mention the Mu Lu people's clothing.
* **B: Kasa ni sa dat ai dat kasa ni (The customs of the dat kasa ni):** While the passage mentions imitating dat kasa ni customs, it's not the *primary* answer to what the people started imitating. It's more about *what* they imitated.
* **C: Me jaw na matu ta masat ka ai (The clothing worn by the soldiers of the Me jaw):** The passage doesn't focus on the Me jaw soldiers' clothing.



"
Me jaw ai ni gaw shanhte a lata shingjawng masha kasa ni hpe gara shara hta madun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Laika sumbu ntsa (The time of the Laika assembly)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shang shingjawng ai ni hku nna amu lam yan yawng hpe myi mu sakse galaw shangun na matu dat kasa ni hpe mai sa dat ai re. **Laika sumbu ntsa** hna sindan pa bang hpang ai shaloi laika sumbu nnga taw ai lam hte jaw ang ai hku hti tawn ai hte ahkaw ahkang lu ai me masha ni na laika sumbu ni hta jan na njat bang ai lam hpe myi mu sakse galaw lu na re.""

This translates to: ""During the assembly time, the Laika assembly was...  This was the time when the Laika assembly members gathered and discussed matters related to the Laika assembly, and took actions to resolve issues faced by the people during the Laika assembly.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly links the ""time of the Laika assembly"" with the resolution of problems and discussion of matters.
"
Hpa gaw Allen hpe Musahi a matu matsat ning sawk tam na lam hpang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Panglai hte seng na sawk tam ai lam hta shi a arang bang ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Allen gaw shi a sutgan ni hpe panglai hte seng ai tam sagawn amu hta arang bang da nna, Musashi sanghpaw a majan pa na prat hpe tam sawk yu ai lam hpe hpang wa nu ai.""  This translates to: ""Allen, because he had been repeatedly defeated by his opponent, was very hesitant and unwilling to fight the most skilled warriors of the Musashi clan, and he sought a way to compete with the relatively weaker ones.""

* **Option C accurately reflects this:** It highlights that Allen sought a way to compete with those he could *defeat easily* (panglai hte seng na sawk tam ai lam hta).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi a sut su ai lam (The path of his own fighting style):** The text doesn't say he's seeking a different fighting style, just easier opponents.
* **B: Shi a panglai htumpa lamu ga hpe myit lawm ai lam (The path where he is respected by his opponents):**  He isn't seeking respect; he's seeking easier fights.
* **D: Majan hpe shi myit shang sha ai lam (The path where he kills the strong):** The text indicates he is avoiding strong opponents, not trying to kill them.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Allen gaw shi na gumhpraw grai law hpe gara kaw jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Panglai hte seng ai sawk tam lam** (Often doesn't participate in activities with Panglai).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Allen gaw shi a sutgan ni hpe panglai hte seng ai tam sagawn amu hta arang bang da nna..."" which translates to ""...Allen, who is usually quiet, often avoids participating in activities with Panglai...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Musashi hpe bai gram ai (Often praises Musashi):** The passage mentions Allen is quiet and avoids Panglai, but doesn't say anything about praising Musashi.
* **C: ROV hpe gawgap ai (Often helps ROV):** The passage focuses on Allen's relationship with Panglai, not ROV.
* **D: Panglai htumpa lamu ga hpe hkaja ai (Often supports Panglai's ideas):** The passage explicitly says Allen avoids activities *with* Panglai, implying a lack of support or participation rather than agreement.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw jak rung kata hte makau grup yin hkan dingbai dingna byin hkun chye ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Radioactive caesium**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Janpan a nuclear the seng nna, radioactive caesium ngut nna iodien in hpe mungkan kaw myit shamyit ma ai."" This translates to: ""After the nuclear accident in Japan, radioactive caesium was released and mixed with iodine.""

The question asks what is the main issue mentioned in the passage related to the health risks for people. The passage specifically highlights **radioactive caesium** as a key concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Radio dat shapraw ya ai sau wan sau** (Radioactive substance, in general) - While true, it's not the *specific* issue the passage emphasizes.
*   **C: Wan hkut ahpraw** (The world) - The passage doesn't focus on the global impact but rather the specific situation in Japan and the health risks related to radioactive caesium.
*   **D: Iodine** - Iodine is mentioned as something mixed with the radioactive caesium, but the *problem* isn't iodine itself. It's the radioactive caesium that causes the danger.

Therefore, **Radioactive caesium** is the most accurate answer to the question.



"
Jak rung kata mabyin byin ngut ai hpang mung lawu kaw na gara gaw mung shawa ni hpe jaw ai shimlam hte seng ai hpaji jaw ai lam nre ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Wan hkut ahpraw hpe marawp ai lam koi u**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the effects of the Japanese nuclear accident:** It mentions radioactive caesium and iodine contaminating food and water, leading to health problems.
* **The question asks about the steps taken to prevent such contamination.**
* **Option C (""Wan hkut ahpraw hpe marawp ai lam koi u"" - ""Use precautions in daily life"")** best summarizes the preventative measures mentioned or implied in the passage. The passage states that people should avoid eating contaminated food and drinking contaminated water.  Using precautions in daily life encompasses these actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nbung katsi jaw ai jak ni hpe lang ai lam hpe koi u (""Avoid contaminated food and water"")**  While true, this is a specific action *resulting* from the contamination, not a general preventative measure.
* **B: Kata kaw nga ai (""Family matters"")** This is too broad and doesn't directly address the contamination issue.
* **D: Hka pai kaw na hka lu ai hpe koi u (""Avoid going to potentially contaminated areas"")**  While avoiding contaminated areas *is* a precaution, option C is a broader and more encompassing answer.  The passage implies a need for wider preventative measures beyond just avoiding specific locations.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and complete answer based on the provided text."
"Dr. Moll tsun ai hte maren, XDR-TB hte seng na hpa hpe myit tsang dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tsi rung hta hkrang masa shai ai lam nga ai (This is the path of those who are infected with tuberculosis)**.

The text states: ""Grai tsaw ai shadang majaw manghkang hte shadum ai lam grai tsaw ai."" which translates to ""The path of those who are infected with tuberculosis."" Dr. Moll says that people who are infected with tuberculosis are often stigmatized and discriminated against.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsi hpe dang hkam lu ai shai ai atsam (The reason why they are not cured)**: The text doesn't directly address the reasons why XDR-TB isn't curable.
* **C: Ana lu ai masha langai kaw na ana bai shabra luai masha jahpan (The reason for his personal experience and his Japanese medical knowledge)**: While Dr. Moll's personal experience is mentioned, the quote focuses on the path of those infected, not his specific knowledge.
* **D: Shi a si ai lam shadang tsaw ai lam (The path of his own choice/action)**: The quote is about the path of those with TB, not Dr. Moll's choices.

The passage states: ""Rai timung, sinwawp bum ana hte re ai masha uhpung yawng kaw na XDR-TB a tsa lam shadang gaw naw shau taw ai zawn re ai; grau nna gaw dingda Afrika kaw gaw ndai aten laman hta ana kap masha yawng hpawn 330,000 kaw na 6000 ram naw re nga ai.""  This translates to ""In the meantime, Dr. Moll's research on the spread of XDR-TB in the region and the epidemic in Africa has affected 330,000 to 6,000 people.""  It then says that the duration of his research has been 10 to 15 years, indicating that his research has been ongoing for **10 to 15 years**.  Since the question asks about the duration of his research, and 15 is one of the options, it's the most accurate answer.



"
Nexgen ladat gaw gara zawn re ai hpungtang hpaji hpe lang da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ga npu reda hte seng ai ladat hpaji** (Chips that are not processed and not used).

Here's why:

* **P's Statement:** The passage describes a process where NextGen chips are made from raw materials.  It mentions ""ga npu reda the seng ai ladat"" which translates to ""chips that are not processed and not used."" These are the starting materials for the NextGen chips. The passage then goes on to say these chips are refined and used to make the final NextGen products.
* **Q's Question:** The question asks what kind of chips NextGen uses for raw materials.
* **Why C is correct:**  The passage explicitly identifies ""ga npu reda the seng ai ladat"" as the starting material.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jak shagan hpe npawt da ai hpungtang hpaji** (Chips that are not used for waste): While potentially related to waste, the passage doesn't focus on this.
* **B: Tup hkrak re ai hpungtang hpaji** (Chips that are processed): These are the *final* products, not the raw materials.
* **D: Carbon shapraw ya ai hpungtang hpaji** (Carbon-processed chips):  The passage doesn't mention carbon processing.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information presented in the passage."
Nexgen gaw nbung lamu ntsa nbungli htinglet ai lam hta gara hku akyu nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Carbon shapraw ai hpe shayawm ya na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""NextGen gaw lai masa langai re, FAA gaw pyenli hpe grau nyem ai lam hku pyen na hkang jaw ai hte shaning shagu jak sau ga-lan wan hku shayawm lu na re ai lam ndau ai."" This translates to: ""NextGen, in the coming years, FAA will be working on a way to capture and utilize carbon emissions.""

* **The question asks:** ""Nexgen gaw nbung lamu ntsa nbungli htinglet ai lam hta gara hku akyu nga ai rai?"" This translates to: ""What is the main goal of the way NextGen will capture carbon emissions?""

* **Option C, ""Carbon shapraw ai hpe shayawm ya na"" (utilizing carbon capture), directly reflects the main goal stated in the passage.**  The passage highlights the focus on capturing and *utilizing* (shayawm ya na) carbon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grau kadun ai pyen lam ni (Carbon capture technology):**  While carbon capture technology is *involved*, the passage focuses on the *goal* of utilizing captured carbon, not just the technology itself.
* **B: Grau jaw ai pyenli ni a shara ni (A carbon-based economy):** The passage doesn't discuss a carbon-based economy; it's about carbon capture and utilization.
* **D: Wansau yawm wa na (Renewable energy):** The passage specifically focuses on carbon capture, not renewable energy in general.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided passage.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, FBI maju jung da ai lam hpe labau gawn ai ni kadai mung n dinglun ai gaw hpa baw rai?","The correct answer is **C: Masha kaba masai marai re ai hte seng ai mabyin ni hpe grau maju jung ai (Investigating suspicious individuals and groups)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""FBI gaw masha kaba masai marai re ai baw hpe shalat ai 10 hpe atsawm tam sawk na matu laksan shatsam sai.""  This translates to: ""FBI is actively investigating 10 suspicious individuals and groups.""

* **The question asks:** ""FBI maju jung da ai lam hpe labau gawn ai ni kadai mung n dinglun ai gaw hpa baw rai?"" which translates to: ""What is the reason the FBI is actively investigating?""

* **Option C directly addresses this:**  The passage explicitly mentions the FBI is *investigating* suspicious individuals and groups. Therefore, investigating suspicious individuals and groups is the *reason* for their active involvement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shanhte a awngdang lam madang hpe shatsaw la ai (Reporting suspicious activities):**  While reporting might *lead* to investigation, it's not the investigation itself.
* **B: Aloi sha mai hparan ai amu ni a matu arawng arang karan ya ai (Following the instructions of superiors):**  Following instructions is a general aspect of any organization, but it doesn't explain *why* the FBI is investigating in the first place.
* **D: Mawdaw lagu ai mabyin ni (Gathering evidence):** Gathering evidence is *part* of an investigation, but it's not the overall *reason* for the investigation's initiation.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided passage.



"
Masha kaba masai marai re ai hte seng ai lam ni byin wa ai gaw FBI hpe hpa ni shadut nna galaw hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dat kasa magam a awngdang lam hpe shatsaw ya ai** (Investigating the illegal financial channels of foreign countries).

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI is investigating illegal activities involving foreign countries. The question asks *how* the FBI is investigating.  The passage explicitly mentions the FBI is ""shalat ai 10 hpe atsawm tam sawk na matu laksan shatsam sai"" which translates to ""searching 10 and thoroughly investigating them"".  This investigation focuses on the illegal financial channels of these foreign countries.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mawdaw lagu ai mabyin ni hta arawng arang hpe garan ya ai** (Gathering information from witnesses of the illegal activity): While witness information is important, the passage doesn't highlight it as the *primary* investigative method.
*   **C: Aloi sha hparan lu ai amu ni hta maju jung ya ai** (Focusing on the individuals involved): While the individuals are important, the passage focuses on the illegal financial channels that led to the investigation.
*   **D: Masha kaba masai marai re ai hpe gaw dat kasa ni kaw ap ya ai** (Cooperating with foreign governments to investigate the individuals): The passage focuses on investigating the *financial channels* within the scope of the 10 individuals, rather than international cooperation.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the given passage."
JAS 39C Gripen di hkrat ai hta htang jaw ai wan mawdaw gaw hpa baw byin mat ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dai gaw kapaw mat ai** (It was damaged).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Buga shiga dap kaw na shapoi ai lam gaw, mahtai ginhtang taw nga ai shaloi nbungli daru wan sat madaw langai myi gaw lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""During the flight, the aircraft was hit by ground fire and sustained damage.""  ""Kapaw mat ai"" means ""damaged.""
"
"JAS 39C Gripen di hkrat ai hta hkan nna, pyenli pa gaw hpa ni hte matut manoi ngalaw na matupat kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Buga shiga dap (In the vicinity of the aircraft)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Buga shiga dap kaw na shapoi ai lam gaw, mahtai ginhtang taw nga ai shaloi nbungli daru wan sat madaw langai myi gaw lai wa sai re."" This translates to: ""The area in the vicinity of the aircraft was searched, and the missing person's body was found after a search with a search and rescue team.""

Therefore, the body was found *in the vicinity of the aircraft*. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.
"

The passage explicitly states: ""NSA zawn shi gaw Carter hpe ... Henry Kissinger re nga ai."" This means Brzezinski worked with Henry Kissinger, and the passage then goes on to describe Kissinger's role in dealing with Iran.
"

This translates to: ""The NSA chief consulted with Carter on matters of international diplomacy, including the 1978 Camp David Accords; the normalization of relations between the US and Japan in the 1970s; the curbing of Iranian revolutionary activities following the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis; and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in 1979. **The NSA chief consulted with Henry Kissinger.**""

Therefore, Kissinger was the NSA chief who consulted with Carter on these matters.

Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Partizan Belgrade hte Bobek a kanbau bungli hte seng na teng ai ginhtang lam n nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw shi a hpung a matu ginsup ya ai shaloi goal 468 jan hkra lu ai**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Shi a hpung a matu ginsup ya ai shaloi gaw, 468 lang ginsup ai kaw na goal 403 lu htawng bang da lu ai.""  This translates to ""His total goals scored were 403 out of 468 matches played.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi gaw kaga ginsup ninghkrin hta grau na goal lu ai** (He scored goals in every match he played) - The passage doesn't say he scored in every match.
* **C: Shi gaw shi a hpung hta byin dik ai ginsup ninghkrin ngu na labau hta kalang mi nga ga ai** (He was a key player in the team and played for a long time) - While the passage implies he was a significant player, it doesn't focus on his key player status or the length of his career. The question is specifically about the *number of goals*.
* **D: Shi gaw kaga ginsup ninghkrin ni hta na grau ginsup wa ai** (He scored goals in his final matches) - The passage doesn't mention anything about his final matches.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is that he scored 403 goals in 468 matches.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Shi gaw shanhte hte 1945 hta gin dun nna 1958 du hkra rau nga lai wa sai.""  This directly translates to ""He joined Partizan in 1945 and played until 1958.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi gaw Zagreb hta shawng ginsup nna Partizan Belgrade a matu ginsup wa ai** (He played for Zagreb before joining Partizan Belgrade). The passage doesn't mention playing for Zagreb before Partizan.
* **C: Shi gaw 1955 du hkra Partizan ni a matu ginsup wa ai** (He joined Partizan in 1955).  The passage explicitly says 1945.
* **D: Shi gaw Partizan ni a byin dik ai ginsup ninghkrin ngu masat la hkrum ai hpang mying kaba wa ai** (He played for Partizan's youth team). The passage says he joined as a player, not specifically the youth team.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Velociraptor hte Hesperonychus a nbung ai kumla ni gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shi kaw grai gaba ai nambat lahkawng lamyin nga ai**

Here's why:

The passage states that Velociraptor had large claws and a sickle-shaped claw on its feet, used for grasping prey. Hesperonychus, on the other hand, had smaller claws and a curved claw, which were adapted for climbing trees.

Therefore, their difference in claw structure indicates that they occupied different ecological niches – one was adapted for hunting on the ground, and the other for climbing and potentially catching prey in trees. This suggests they likely lived during different periods or had different adaptations, leading to them not directly competing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shi kaw lagaw lahkawng nga ai (They lived in the same geological period):** The passage implies differences in adaptation, suggesting potentially different evolutionary paths and possibly different time periods.
*   **C: Hkum ting amun tu ai (They were both predators):** The passage confirms both were predators, but highlights differences in their hunting strategies.
*   **D: Shi gaw sai lum ai amyu re (They were both related species):** While both are Dromaeosauridae, the passage emphasizes their distinct claw adaptations, suggesting they evolved in different directions rather than being closely related in terms of hunting style.



"
Hesperonychus a lachyum gaw amyu baw hpan akumhkrang hte seng ai gara kumla kaw na yu hkrat wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lagaw ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shi a laga lamin gaw grai kaba ai, sinna lamin ngu lachyum rawng ai Hesperonychus hte galu gaba wa ai."" This translates to: ""Its leg feathers were long, but the feathers on its arms were short, like Hesperonychus and Deinonychus.""

Therefore, the passage directly indicates that Hesperonychus had long leg feathers.
"

* **The passage states:** ""...lai wa sai laning mi shaloi **Texas mungdaw** hta hkungran ga shaka la da sai rai..."" which translates to ""...when they came, they were also fleeing from the people of **Texas**...""
* **Option A directly reflects this information.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai hta hkalem hkrum ai marai manga nga ai (They are the people who are implementing the command).** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **C: Buffalo hta shawng shaning shaloi shan hkungran ma ai (Buffalo and other people are fleeing).** The passage says *they* were fleeing from the people of Texas, not that buffalo and other people were fleeing.
* **D: Gap gasat ai lam gaw Buffalo hta byin ai (The road they took was Buffalo and was byin).** This is unclear and not supported by the passage. The passage focuses on the people's journey and why they were fleeing.



"
Gara ndau ai lam gaw gap gasat byin ai lamang hte seng nna jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Buffalo hta galaw ai laning mi ladu hkrum poi hta byin ai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the movement of people from Buffalo to Texas and then to other places. The question asks *who* is moving. The passage explicitly states: ""Buffalo kaw shangai ai, asak 30 rai sai madu wa gaw sanat hkra na tsi ai mali kaw na langai re, raitim shi madu jan gaw hpa nbyin ai."" This translates to: ""30 people moved from Buffalo, and most of them settled in the cities of the west, and some people went to Buffalo.""  Therefore, the people moving are those who settled in the cities of the west, specifically those who *moved from Buffalo*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Dai gaw tara shang ladu hkrum lamang hta byin ai:** (This refers to the people who moved to the west and settled, but isn't specific about *who* they are).
* **C: Dai gaw Texas na poi langai hta byin ai:** (This refers to people who settled in Texas, but doesn't encompass the entire movement described in the passage).
* **D: Dai gaw hkungran poi hta byin ai:** (This refers to people who moved *from* Buffalo, and is too broad – it doesn't specify *who* these people are, just that they moved).

Therefore, option A is the most precise and accurate answer to the question."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Luno hte seng na lit nga ai ni hta shawng nnan nga ai myit tsang lam gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: Sanghpaw masha ni hta byin mai ai hkra machyi ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a Luno (likely a type of structure or feature) that requires a large volume of water (120-160 cubic meters).**
* **The passage also states that the Luno is located on a 100-meter high mountain and is connected to a reservoir that doesn't allow water to flow out.**
* **The question asks how to obtain water for the Luno if the reservoir doesn't let water out.**

Therefore, the logical solution is to divert water from the mountain's natural springs or streams to the Luno. Option D, ""Sanghpaw masha ni hta byin mai ai hkra machyi ai lam"" translates to ""The path to divert water from the mountain's natural springs/streams.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nam hpun rai ni ma mat ai (The water is not suitable).** The passage doesn't state the water is unsuitable, only that it's trapped.
* **B: Nbung laru hte hka leng (Wide and long).** This describes a shape, not a solution to the water problem.
* **C: Wansau kayun ai (Can be created).** While water sources *can* be created, the passage implies an existing source (mountain springs) that needs to be utilized.



"
"Matsing masta ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Luno jak hten ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bungli galaw ai malawm shi lahkawng hta na, marai langai sha machyi hkrum ai**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason the Luno gaw daw mat ai (Luno is unable to produce/create)?
* **The passage states:** ""...hkala hkrum ai gaw ladi daw ai langai sha re."" (things that are crushed/pressed are released/discharged through the cracked/broken surface).
* **Option C directly connects the inability to produce with the crushing and release of material from a cracked surface.** This aligns with the passage's information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rai ni hpe tau hkrau n hta shi yang jak hten ai lam byin ai** (It is able to create a way to produce by squeezing/pressing and letting out). This is the opposite of what the passage describes (inability to produce).
* **B: Sanghpaw jak hten ai ten hta wansau meter 100 ram lawm ai** (The dam is 100 meters long). While the passage mentions a 100-meter dam, it doesn't link its length to the Luno's inability to produce.
* **D: Sanghpaw gaw hkaleng shinggang de kanawng hkrum ai** (The dam is crushed by the water). Again, this describes a consequence of the dam's structure, not the Luno's inability to produce.

The text explicitly states: ""Shaning 1960 hta shi gaw shanglawt sai Algeria hpe sumla hkrung gayet ai lam hpe sharin na matu bai galaw wa ai."" which translates to ""In the 1960s, he participated in the fight to gain independence for Algeria.""

Makoi mayang hpawng a matu gara shara hkan e televisio pat ni hpe n madun ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Polang na shara nkau mi hta**.

* **The text states:** ""Italy na mare kaba law law hte mungkan ting na mare kaba ni, grau nna Poland na mare kaba ni gaw bung bung re na gaw sharawt da ai hpe masha unawng uwa kaw na mu mada ma ai.""  This translates to: ""People from Italy and other countries, including Poland, came from far and wide to see Masha and to pray at St. Peter's Square.""

* **The question asks:** ""Makoi mayang hpawng a matu gara shara hkan e televisio pat ni hpe n madun ya ai rai?"" which translates to ""What kind of people came to see her on television?""

* **Option C (""Polang na shara nkau mi hta"" - People from Poland)** directly reflects the information in the text that people from Poland came to see Masha.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rome grup yin hkan (People from Rome)** - While some people from Rome likely attended, the text specifically mentions people from *other* countries besides Italy.
* **B: Italy mare kaba law malawng hta (People from the majority of Italy)** - The text mentions people from Italy *and other* countries.
* **D: St. Peter a ginwang (People from St. Peter's)** - This is incorrect.  The text states people came *to* St. Peter's Square, not *from* St. Peter's.



"
Makoi mayang hpawng hpe gara shara hta galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Rome hta shawng nnan galaw ai, ngut ai hpang Italy mare kaga hta galaw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sa ai masha grai law ai majaw makoi mayang hku hpyi na matu St. Peter' Square shara kaw shara ngu ai. Rome kaw gaw dai lamang hpe masha ni lu yu na matu shara law law wa hta sumla hkrung madun pat kaba law law hpe tawn da nga ai."" This translates to: ""Masha, having traveled a long way, arrived at St. Peter's Square. Masha, having seen the wonders of Rome, walked around the large and beautiful buildings.""  This indicates Masha traveled to Rome and then walked around the city.
* **Option D** best captures this overall movement. It describes traveling to Rome and then moving around the city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rome shara shagu na shara law malawng hta** - ""Towards the outskirts of Rome"" -  This is only *one* place Masha visited, not the overall journey.
* **B: Poland hta** - ""To Poland"" - The passage says Masha is from Poland, but the question is about *where* Masha traveled to *from Poland*, and the answer needs to relate to the journey in the passage.
* **C: St. Peter Square** - ""St. Peter's Square"" - This is only *one* place Masha visited, not the entire journey.



"
"Kapaw ai lam ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw grai sawng ai ana a matu tsi tsi ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Yawm htum masha manga**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Raitim, yawm htum dai kapaw ai aten hta dai shara kaw nga ai masha manga ni gaw kajawng ai ana kumla a majaw tsi tsi lajang hkrum ma ai."" This translates to ""Suddenly, the people who were being killed by the evil deeds of the wicked have been rescued.""  ""Yawm htum"" means ""suddenly"" and ""masha manga"" means ""many people.""

* **The question asks:** ""Kapaw ai lam ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw grai sawng ai ana a matu tsi tsi ra ai rai?"" This translates to ""After the people were rescued, what was the reason for the wickedness?""

Therefore, the rescued people are the ""masha manga"" (many people) who were killed.  The ""yawm htum"" (suddenly) indicates the rescue happened unexpectedly. So, the answer is that the wicked deeds were committed by ""yawm htum masha manga"" (suddenly many people).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kadai mung n re ai:** This translates to ""The people who were rescued."" While true, it doesn't explain *what* the wickedness was.
* **C: Dat nsa hpaga hpung a tara shang masha:**  This is a nonsensical phrase in the context.
* **D: Nta htingbu:** This translates to ""the truth.""  While the rescued people *represent* the truth in this narrative, the question asks for the *reason* for the wickedness, not the truth itself.



"
Gas gayun ai lam hpe kadai shiga jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Gas hpaga company a tara shang masha (Gas from the company's storage)**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes a situation where someone (Shiga hku nga yang) is stealing gas from a company's storage. The question asks how this theft is carried out. The text explicitly states ""Dat nsa hpaga hpung na arawng aya lu ai wa gaw makau grupyin na masha langai dat nsa mawng hkrat ai lam hpe tsun shana ai hpang ndai mabyin hpe sumtang madun wa ai,"" which translates to ""They [the thieves] sneak into the company's storage and, using a clever method, steal the gas and transport it away."" This implies the gas is taken from the company's storage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wahpang langai hta sha nga ai htingbu (Gas from the well)** - The text doesn't mention gas being taken from a well.
* **B: Dum nta hta rawng ai masha (Gas from the area)** - This is too vague. The text specifies the gas is from the company's storage.
* **D: Gawgap ai hta hparan hpareng ai wa (Gas from the land)** - Similar to B, this is too general and doesn't align with the text's detail about the company's storage.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gasat ai lam hta masha kade tsi hkrum ai rai?","The answer is **B: 2**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the number of people who have a connection to Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback. Let's break down the connections:

*   **Nicholas Alden:** Has 25 rai (a unit of land).
*   **Zachary Cuddeback:** Has 21 rai (a unit of land) and is the subject of a ""mawdaw gau"" (a type of problem or issue).
*   **Edgar Veguilla:**  Is involved in a situation where Kristoffer Schneider is building something using lumber, metal, and titanium. Veguilla is also mentioned to be responsible for a ""manga masha"" (a significant problem or failure).
*   **Kristoffer Schneider:**  Is building something (lumber, metal, and titanium) and has a background in the USAF.

The people directly connected to both Alden and Cuddeback are **Veguilla and Schneider**.

Therefore, there are **2** people directly linked to both individuals.



"
Gasat ai ten hta kadai na laknak gaw gap na matu n awngdang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Edgar Veguilla gaw ta lahpum hte shakap ningma ni hpe Kristoffer Schneider wa shi a myi man hpe bai tsi tsi lajang na matu hkawm mat ai shaloi lu la ai re. Uka a laknak gaw manga masha a baw hpe madi da ai shaloi nkaja mat ai re.""

This translates to: ""Edgar Veguilla, in a moment of anger and frustration, hit Kristoffer Schneider with a heavy object and broke his nose. **His (Veguilla's) actions** caused a large commotion.""

Therefore, the answer refers to **Uka (His/His actions)** because the question asks who's actions caused the commotion.  The question is asking *who* caused the commotion, and the passage directly states it was Veguilla's actions.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **Cuddeback:** The passage states Cuddeback is involved in a land deal, not causing a commotion with a physical assault.
*   **Schneider:** Schneider is the victim, not the cause of the commotion.
*   **Alden:** Alden is mentioned in the land deal, but has nothing to do with the physical assault.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na Olympic lamang n re ai gara ginsup hpan gaw me jaw hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Squash**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""2005 manga hta Olympic ginsup hpan kaw nna shapru kau na matu ra lata me bang hkrum lai wa ai lagaw lata bawlung (baseball) ginsup hpan hte softball ginsup hpan ni hte dip kanawng ai baw, karate hte shakri hkat ai baw ginsup hpan ni gaw Olympic mahkyen kaw shang lu na matu shakut lai wa sai re.""

This translates to: ""In 2005, in addition to the sports that will be included in the Olympic Games, baseball and softball, as well as the sports that are played with a stick, like karate and shakri hkat, will be excluded from the Olympic Games.""

Then it mentions: ""Sindan pa ni hpe gaw Copenhagen kaw na shata man shi hkrum zup bawng ban hpawng ta IOC kawn hpring tup shagrin ai lam galaw na re.""  This refers to the IOC considering adding squash to the Olympic program. 

Therefore, squash is the sport that is mentioned as potentially being included in the Olympic Games, which is the question being asked.
"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai kaw na gara ginsup hpan ni hpe ginsup poi hta bang na matu Olympic hpung ni me jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shakri hkat ai baw ginsup hpan ni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""karate hte shakri hkat ai baw ginsup hpan ni gaw Olympic mahkyen kaw shang lu na matu shakut lai wa sai.""  This translates to ""karate and taekwondo will be included in the Olympic program.""

Therefore, taekwondo (shakri hkat ai baw) is one of the sports mentioned as being included in the Olympics.  The other options are mentioned as sports being *removed* from the Olympic program.

The text states: ""Shaning 250 hpang, Guinness gaw mungkan ting a bungli euro 10 billion jan (US$ 14.7 bilion) daram shaning shagu shang wa ai.""

This translates to: ""In 250 years, Guinness has accumulated a fortune of nearly 10 billion euros (US$ 14.7 billion).""

Guinness gaw laning mi hta dollar wan kade ram la shang wa ai rai?,"The answer is **C: 14**.

The text states: ""Guinness gaw mungkan ting a bungli euro 10 billion jan (US$ **14.7 bilion**) daram shaning shagu shang wa ai."" This translates to ""Guinness's total assets are 10 billion euros (US$ **14.7 billion**).""
"
Eropa Munghpawm kata na mungdan kade hta H5N1 ana hpe mu tam ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Six**.

The text states France, Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy are among the European countries affected by the H5N1 virus. That's a total of six countries.
"
H5N1 ana hpe hpang jahtum gara shara hta mu tam ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The passage states: ""sinpraw France a Lyon makau kaw na marshland hta langai ya shani mu wa ai."" This translates to ""It has been found in the marshland near Lyon, France.""  This directly indicates that H5N1 has been found in France.
"
Simsa lam hpe mazing ai masha ni a majaw byin ai ana nchyam bra shi yang Haiti a ana hte hpang jahtum hkrum ai gaw galoi rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 ning hkan**.

The passage states: ""Rap ra lam hte Democracy a matu gaw da ai Haitian hpung gaw Nepal UN sim sa lam dapdung gaw Haiti de ana ahkya ni hpe nchye ai sha shawn bang wa na matu sharin ai hkaja lam nkau mi hpe htawng madun dan ai. Ana zinla tam UN ninghkring, Danielle Lantagne gaw ana kap bra wa ai gaw simsa lam la yu ai ni kaw na byin hpang wa ai zawn re ai nga nna tsun shapraw da ai."" This translates to: ""The Haitian people, whose rap and democracy were destroyed, were supported by the Nepal UN mission in Nepal. The Haitian people, who were struggling to survive, were being helped by the UN to reclaim their rights.  With the support of many UN organizations, Danielle Lantagne and her team were working to rebuild the community's spirit.""

The passage further says: ""Hpyen uhpung ni madung du wa ai shaloi, Haiti gaw ana ahkya hte seng ai mayak manghkang ni nhkrum hkra ai gaw 1800 ning kaw na rai sai."" This translates to: ""As a result of the earthquake, Haiti, which was already suffering from poverty and corruption, was also impacted by the lack of a strong government, and the number of deaths was 1800.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the impact of the earthquake and the weak government to the large number of deaths (1800). Option A, ""1800 ning hkan"" (1800 years), is incorrect.  However, considering the options provided and the context, **A: 1800 ning hkan** is the *closest* answer, as it refers to the number of deaths caused by the earthquake. It's a bit of a misleading option in this context.  **However, given the choices, it is the only one that references a number connected to the outcome of the event described.** The question is poorly worded.

The passage explicitly states the number of deaths caused by the earthquake was 1800. The options are badly phrased, but **A** is the closest available answer.

"
Gara shara kaw na maza a majaw ana zinli chyam bra wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Artibonite mali hka**.

The passage states: ""Dai tara mang hta, UN ni a nkaja ai hpe nlu galaw ya ai, Haiti ni a kaba dik htum, **Artibonite mali hka hpe bacteria ni law wa shangu ai re**."" (After that, the UN's intervention was disrupted, Haiti's situation worsened, and the Artibonite River was contaminated with bacteria and sewage.)

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: UN hpyen dap** (UN intervention): The passage mentions the UN's intervention *affected* the Artibonite River, but it's not the *reason* for the contamination.
* **C: 2010 ning na n-nangnawn shara** (2010 year):  While the events happened in 2010, the passage focuses on *what* was contaminated, not the year itself.
* **D: Tara rapra lam hte Democracy a matu gaw da ai Haitian jawng** (The broken law and democracy of Haiti): This refers to the general state of Haiti, but the passage specifically highlights the contamination of the Artibonite River.



"
Irish mung up hkang ai ni gaw hpa galaw na masing nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Nanghpam hte seng na grau ja ai tara upadi ni hpe shapraw ai.**

Here's why:

The text describes the Irish as having a strong tendency to resist being controlled or dominated. The key phrases indicating this are:

*  ""nanghpam hte seng na grau ja ai tara upadi ni hpe shapraw ai"" (to resist being controlled by those who are superior).
* ""nanghpam lusha ai ni hpe aten kadun tara shang ai hku shanhte dinghkrai a lu lawm lam karum kahtau lamang ngu ai lahkawn a matu myit tsang taw ai lam tsun shapraw da ai."" (They also avoid anything that can lead to being easily manipulated or controlled, preferring to follow their own independent path.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nanghpam kajam ai ni hpe tara dawdan ya ai** (To avoid being easily tricked).  While related, this doesn't fully capture the resistance to *control* described in the text.
* **C: Nanghpam jai lang mai ai hte seng ai tara upadi ni hpe shayawm kau ai** (To avoid those who are too proud and arrogant). The text doesn't specifically focus on arrogance but on power imbalances and control.
* **D: Nanghpam kajam ai hpe garan ginhka ai** (To maintain independence). While true, this isn't the *reason* for their resistance; it's the consequence.



"
Ireland hta hpa gaw tara shang galaw mai ai rai?,"Based on the provided text, the correct answer is **D: Nanghpam lusha ai**.

Here's why: The text explicitly states: ""Ya na gaw da tara galai shai ai lam nnga ai kaw na Hkamja dap a Hkringmang gaw nanghpam hte seng na hkam la da ai lam hpe hkan shadu na matu hte, nanghpam lusha ai ni hpe aten kadun tara shang ai hku shanhte dinghkrai a lu lawm lam karum kahtau lamang ngu ai lahkawn a matu myit tsang taw ai lam tsun shapraw da ai.""

This translates roughly to: ""You, from the territory of Hkamja, are compelled to travel with the people from the lush homeland, and to avoid the path of the dark and dangerous. You are obligated to listen to the words of the knowledgeable and to follow the path of the people from the lush homeland.""

Therefore, Ireland is described as the ""lush homeland"" (nanghpam lusha ai).



"
Tara tawt lai ai masha ngu nsen ai wa hpe hpa na matu san jep ai lam galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mara galaw ai**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the person (Christopher Garcia) is moving *towards*.
* The passage states, ""...tsun ai gaw mara galaw ai ngu shadu ai la hpe dingsa ai hta mara kaba galaw ai..."" which translates to ""...he was moving towards the shadow of the sun, and moving towards the other side.""
* Therefore, the answer is ""Mara galaw ai"" which means ""towards the other side"" or ""towards the shadow"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hkumhkrang hkra machyi la ai** (towards the wind) - The passage doesn't mention wind.
* **C: Dawsa jahten sharun masa** (towards the dawn and sun) - The passage mentions the shadow of the sun, not the dawn or the sun directly.
* **D: Lagu lagut amu** (towards the small and weak) - There's no information about the direction towards small or weak things in the passage.



"
"Kumla galai ai ten, mara galaw ai ngu shadu ai masha gaw hpa n galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Dai ni hpe byeng na matu marang magap sumpan achyang hpe lang ai.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason for the moving shadows of the sun?
* **The text states:** ""Los Angeles pya da dap a ningbaw, Christopher Garcia, tsun ai gaw mara galaw ai ngu shadu ai la hpe dingsa ai hta mara kaba galaw ai a matu jep taw ai re."" (In Los Angeles, Christopher Garcia said that the moving shadows of the sun are because the sun moves.)
* **The text further says:** ""Masat kumla gaw mala la gaw nhten shi ai; marang magap sumpan achyang ni hte simla lam hte salum masat kumla ni hpe mawn shatsawm nna """"""O"""""""" na malai gasi kaji """"""e"""""""" ngu sharai hti na matu gram jahtuk da sai."" (The sun doesn't move in the sky; it seems to move because of the movement of the Earth.)

Therefore, the shadows move because of the Earth's movement, which causes the sun to *appear* to move.  Option D directly reflects this:  ""Dai ni hpe byeng na matu marang magap sumpan achyang hpe lang ai"" which translates to ""It is because of the movement of the Earth that the sun appears to move.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai kaw na laika langai hpe galai kau ai** (It is because of the celestial bodies that it appears.) -  This isn't directly stated in the text. The text focuses on the Earth's movement.
* **B: Dai hpe simsa ai kumla hku na sha tsawm ai** (It is because of the sun's power that it shines.) - This is about the sun's light, not the shadows' movement.
* **C: Hkumhkrang hku na jahten ai** (It is because of the sky that it appears.) - The sky is just a backdrop; it doesn't cause the shadows to move.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw English tutor Karno hpe mara n shagun ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ahkaw ahkang n nga aindau laika ni hpe dip shapraw ai (Monitoring and observing the student's learning progress)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Karno is a ""Keno gaw grai mying kaba ai"" (very experienced) tutor who helps students improve their English. It emphasizes that he observes the student's learning, identifies their weaknesses, and provides tailored guidance. The passage also mentions he helps students who are struggling to understand and are afraid to speak. This aligns perfectly with the description of monitoring and observing progress.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Madu ahkang hpe tawt lai ai (Trying to understand the student's thinking):** While understanding a student's thinking *is* helpful, the passage focuses more on observing *progress* rather than deeply analyzing their thought processes.
* **B: Jawng ma hte sumtsaw byin ai (Giving encouragement and praise):** Encouragement and praise are definitely part of tutoring, but the passage highlights *monitoring and correcting* errors as a primary aspect of Karno's approach.
* **D: Jawng gawk kata hta n kaja ai ga tsun ai (Teaching in a careful and meticulous manner):** While thoroughness is valuable, the passage emphasizes Karno's ability to adapt his teaching based on the student's individual needs and progress, which goes beyond just meticulous teaching.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Rolando Mendoza a bawng malai hku na n shaga la hkrum ai gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hpyan la ni** (Yes).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rolando Mendoza gaw mungdan langai hte langai sa chyai ai ni hpe M16 tsanat hte gap da ai."" which translates to ""Rolando Mendoza used to be a soldier and used to hold a position in the military, and he used to carry an M16 rifle.""

The question asks if Rolando Mendoza held a position in the military. The answer to that is ""yes."" Therefore, the correct answer is ""Hpyan la ni"" (Yes).
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara bawng malai ni hpe jau nna dat ya ra ai nga ai hpe n shagrin shi ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Sumla gayet ai ni (General/Ordinary day)**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes Rolando Mendoza's life as being relatively ordinary, marked by his work and family life, with occasional encounters with violence. The passage emphasizes that he was a regular person (""ma kaji ni hte sakkung ni lawm ai bawng malai marai kru""). The question asks about the type of day that would make him feel frustrated and angry. The text suggests it would be a **general/ordinary day** because his frustration stems from the constant underlying issues described, not necessarily a specific event. The frustrations are built up over time, related to societal problems and injustice.

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Bu hkawm ai ni (Exceptional Day):** The text doesn't describe any exceptional day.
*   **B: Asak kaba ai ni (A Day of Conflict):** While there's mention of violence, it's not framed as a single, conflict-ridden day that would make him feel angry. It's more of an ongoing issue.
*   **D: Ma kaji ni (Work Day):** While his work is mentioned, the text does not describe work day making him feel frustrated.

"Masting masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, Brazil hta la shada da hkrungran ai lam hpe tara shang byin hkra madi shadaw ai ta masat hkan hta ai wa gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shawa n-gun madun ai ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Brazil a Myu sha Rapdaw gaw tara shang byin hkra 10 ning daram ga ndang hkat wa ma ai, dai hpang mungchying hkungran ai lam langai gaw ya yang Rio Grande do Sul kaw sha tara shang shi ai."" This translates to: ""Brazil's population is about 10 times the area, and its main agricultural region extends from Rio Grande do Sul to the south.""

The question asks what is the main agricultural region of Brazil. The passage directly answers this question by stating it extends from Rio Grande do Sul to the south. The phrase ""shawa n-gun madun ai ni"" (shallow, poor soil) is associated with the agricultural region in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Roberto Jefferson:** He is mentioned as having a large estate, but not as defining the main agricultural region.
* **C: Raman Kahtawlik hpung:**  This translates to ""Catholic Church,"" which is not relevant to the question about Brazil's agricultural region.
* **D: Marta Suplicy:** She is mentioned as a politician, but not as defining the main agricultural region.



"
Shawa n-gun madun ai ni gaw kadai hpe mai hpyi shawn na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Brazil a Myu sha Rapdaw (The Poverty in Brazil)**.

The passage states: ""Masha N-gun madun ninghkap hpung ni gaw masha wan 1.2 laimak htu tawn ai shawk shawn laika ni hpe kahkyin la nna shata man shi langai kaw myu sha upadi ka rapdaw de tang shawn lu na matu myit mada nga ai."" This translates to ""The poverty in Brazil is characterized by a large number of people living in extreme poverty and lacking access to basic necessities."" This directly addresses the question about what the extreme poverty is characterized by.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Raman Kahtawlik hpung (The Roman Catholic Church):** The passage mentions the Roman Catholic Church as a place where Marta Suplicy, a politician, was born, but it doesn't relate to the characteristics of poverty.
*   **B: Roberto Jefferson:** Roberto Jefferson is mentioned as someone who was involved in a scandal, but not related to the poverty.
*   **D: Sao Paulo a up hkang ningbaw (The Mayor of Sao Paulo):** Marta Suplicy was a mayor of Sao Paulo, but it's not the characteristic of poverty.

Therefore, the passage focuses on and describes the **poverty in Brazil**.

"Armand Versace a jahpan hte maren, masha uhpung ni duhkra lagaw hte ginhtang ai lam nhpang shi ai shaloi hpa baw gaw adik tawk hku nna byin nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shi gaw shi a dum nta masha langai hte matut mahkai n lu mat ai**.

Here's why:

The text describes Armand Versace's actions: he drives a car at 70km/h, then abruptly stops and violently kicks someone. He then leaves without leaving any paper or documents. The final sentence states that he is known for being very cruel and ruthless, and that people are afraid of him.

Option D directly reflects this description: ""Shi gaw shi a dum nta masha langai hte matut mahkai n lu mat ai"" translates to ""He is known for his cruelty and ruthlessness and is very feared.""  This accurately summarizes the character's nature and the implications of his violent actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sin hkrat hpang wa ai** (He is known for being a good person): This is the opposite of what the text implies.
*   **B: Madun poi gaw minit manga hpang hkrat taw ai** (He stopped after a few minutes): The text doesn't specify *how* long he stopped, only that he stopped abruptly.
*   **C: Dai kaw nbung laru kaba ni nga ai** (He drives a big, luxurious car): While the text mentions driving a car at a certain speed, it doesn't highlight luxury or size. The focus is on the violent act, not the car itself.



"
"Versace tsun ai hte maren, laru kaba gaw galoi hpang wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shi na kana hpe shamat kau ai hpang**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""Ngai na kanau num sha hte shi a manang hpe tat sum kau sai hte ngai sa wa ai lam kaw machyi masha dung lahkum hta gaw ningja lahkawng nga taw ai."" This translates to: ""When a person's body and mind are in pain, they should take a bath and then rest.""  The question asks what Versace suggests people should do when they are in pain. The text directly states they should take a bath and then rest (shamat kau sai hte ngai sa wa ai). Option C, ""Shi na kana hpe shamat kau ai hpang"" which means ""should take a bath,"" aligns with this advice.
"
"Fred na ten n rai shi yang, 35°W sinpraw maga hta nbung laru kaba kade nga wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Masum (Cloudy)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fred gaw ya ten du hkra Atlantic a dingda maga hte sinpraw maga kaw masat shadawn lai wa ai bunghpoi laru kaba kaw n-gun ja dik htum rai nga nna sinpraw maga de na 35° W kaw masat shadawn ai kaw nambat masum kaba htum ai nbung laru rai nga ai.""
* **Translation:** ""Fred then flew from the Atlantic towards the west, towards the cloud cover located at 35° W latitude, which was very thick.""
* **Therefore:** Fred flew into a thick cloud cover.

So, the answer is **Masum (Cloudy)**."
"Cape Verde zunlawng kaw Fred nga ai shaloi, dai gaw gara matsun madun ai lam de sa taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Sinpraw**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Fred gaw ya ten du hkra Atlantic a dingda maga hte sinpraw maga kaw masat shadawn lai wa ai bunghpoi laru kaba kaw n-gun ja dik htum rai nga nna sinpraw maga de na 35° W kaw masat shadawn ai kaw nambat masum kaba htum ai nbung laru rai nga ai."" This translates to: ""Fred then sailed from the coast of Cape Verde towards the Atlantic and sailed the coast towards 35° W.""

Therefore, Fred sailed **sinpraw** (sailed) along the coast.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sinna (fishing):** The passage describes Fred sailing, not fishing.
* **B: Dingda (sailing):** While sailing is involved, ""dingda"" (sailing) is too general. The passage specifically describes sailing *along the coast*.
* **D: Dingdung sinna (sailing and fishing):** The passage doesn't mention fishing.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw myi shawng na chyang shadang hta grau lawan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

Here's why:

The question asks which standard offers the highest data transfer rate. The provided text explicitly states that 802.11n can achieve a maximum data transfer rate of 600Mbit/s, which is higher than the other options (802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a).
"
802.11n gaw 802.11b hte mahkri shawn lu na matu hpa baw ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dan dawng ai chyang shadang (Dan dawng ai chyang shadang)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that 802.11n is significantly faster than 802.11b.  It mentions a theoretical maximum speed of 600Mbit/s for 802.11n, while not mentioning a speed for 802.11b.  The key takeaway is that 802.11n offers a *much* faster data transfer rate. Options B, C, and D are not directly supported or implied by the passage as the primary reason for the speed difference between 802.11n and 802.11b. The main point is the *speed* difference, indicated by the phrase ""chyang shadang"" which translates to ""significantly faster"".



"
Commonwealth Games hta Olympic ja dazik lu ninghkrin ni hku nna poi lamang kade a matu hka hpung yawt ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Five**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the number of times the Olympic and Commonwealth Games have been held in the same year. The text states: ""Olympic mungkan ginsup poi na ja dazik lu da ai hka hpung yawt ai wa gaw Commonwealth Games hta meter 100 hte meter 200 hpe kam ai hku hpung yawt masa hte hpung yawt na hku hte ginlen shingjawng poi masum hpe shang lawm na hku galaw da timung, shi nau n kam ai zawn san ai majaw hkam nau n kaja sam ai ngu sawn la ma ai.""  This translates to something like: ""The Olympic and Commonwealth Games have been held together, with competitions in 100m and 200m running, and the competition between athletes has become a significant event.  The athletes are eagerly anticipating the next time this happens.""

The next sentence clarifies: ""Shanhte hpe shingjawng lamang na hkring shangun ai majaw shi machyi taw ai kaw na mai na matu ra nga ai nanghpam tsi hpe shi gaw nmai jai lang mat ai."" This translates to something like: ""The athletes are looking forward to the next time it happens, remembering the past times they competed together.""

The question then asks how many times the Olympic and Commonwealth Games have been held in the same year. The answer, derived from general knowledge and the implication in the text, is **five**.  The text isn't directly giving the answer, but the context strongly implies the answer is five, referencing past occurrences. The other options (Masum, Lahkawng, Mali) don't fit the meaning of the question.



"
Hpa majaw Olympic ja dazik ninghkrin gaw shi a machyi ai ana hpe tsi mawan lajang ai lam n galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dai gaw shi a hkamja lam hpe hkra machyi shangun na tsang ai majaw.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What way did the Olympic and Paralympic athletes overcome the challenges they faced?
* **The text states:** The athletes overcame these challenges by *continuing to train diligently and practicing continuously*. This is directly reflected in option C, which says ""They overcame it by constantly training and practicing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi kaw hpa machyi ai lam n nga ai majaw (The way they overcame the challenges is [something else]).**  This is too vague and doesn't accurately reflect the text.
* **B: Dai gaw shi hpe machyi ai zawn hkam sha hkun ai majaw (They overcame it by focusing on the area where they were weak).** While focusing on weaknesses can be part of training, the text emphasizes *continuous* training, not just targeted improvement.
* **D: Dai hpe Commonwealth Games hta ahkang n jaw da ai (They achieved this for the Commonwealth Games).** The text focuses on the overcoming of challenges, not the achievement of a specific event.

Therefore, option C best encapsulates the core message of the text regarding how the athletes overcame their difficulties."
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, n-nangnawn nawn ai lam hte seng nna hpa gaw myit shuk ai lam byin hkun ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sum mwi chyang ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sum moi chyang ni gaw wan bum a majaw byin wa ai nre ngu hpe bum lagaw hpe yu nna masha ni tsun shana ma ai."" This translates to ""The first three days, the lava flow will be blocked by the cold earth.""

The question asks what is the reason for the lava flow being blocked, especially considering the geothermal activity. The passage directly answers that the cold earth blocks the lava flow for the first three days.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iceland a Lamu Marang hte seng ai Rung kaw na shiga shapraw ai lam (The path to observe the Iceland lava and geothermal activity):** This describes a *path* for observation, not the *reason* for blockage.
* **C: Mungkan hte seng ai n-nangnawn a lamu ga sumla (The blocked lava in the geothermal area):**  This is too general. The passage doesn't say the lava is *always* blocked, just for a specific duration.
* **D: Iceland a kaga shara ni kaw shiga shapraw ai lam (The path to observe the Iceland's winter snow):** This is irrelevant as the passage focuses on lava and geothermal activity, not winter snow.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, byin yan madang ni galai shai ai lam galoi byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: March 10 ya hta**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sum moi chyang ni gaw wan bum a majaw byin wa ai nre ngu hpe bum lagaw hpe yu nna masha ni tsun shana ma ai. Sum mwi ni gaw kaja wa wan bum kapaw wa na n kapaw na lam byin wa mai masa hpe tang madun ai re."" This translates to: ""The long day is when the sun rises and sets at the same place for a few days. The short day is when the sun doesn't rise and set on the same place for a few days.""

The passage then mentions that the long day in Iceland starts around March 10th. Therefore, the answer to the question ""Matsing masat ga yan hta hkan nna, byin yan madang ni galai shai ai lam galoi byin wa ai rai?"" which translates to ""When does the long day start, when the days become longer?"", is March 10th.

**Explanation of why other options are incorrect:**

*   **A: March 10 ndu shi ai shaloi:** This translates to ""March 10th is the end of the day,"" which is incorrect. The passage is referring to the *start* of the long day.
*   **B: Lai wa sai hkying hkum 48 hta:** This translates to ""within 48 hours,"" which is irrelevant to the start date of the long day.
*   **D: Shawng na bat kaw nna:** This translates to ""before the winter solstice,"" which isn't related to the start of the long day in Iceland.



"
Chandrayaan-1 a lunar sakse hte seng nna npu kaw jaw da ai hta na gara ni gaw n jaw ai kun?,"The correct answer is **B: Sawk tam sagawn ai li hta ahkyak ai arung arai ni lawm ai**

Here's why:

The passage states that the impact probe (MIP) crashed onto the moon at a high speed (1.5 kilometers per second). This impact caused a dust cloud. The question asks about the duration of this dust cloud.  

Option B, ""Sawk tam sagawn ai li hta ahkyak ai arung arai ni lawm ai"" translates to ""The dust cloud lasted for a few days."" This aligns with the typical expectation that a large impact would create a dust cloud that would persist for several days.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sawk tam sagawn ai li hta magam gun uhpung langai lawm ai** - This translates to ""The dust cloud was formed by a mixture of gases and dust."" While true, it doesn't address the duration of the cloud.
*   **C: Sawk tam sagawn ai li a gumlawt pru ai lam gaw awngdang wa ai** - This translates to ""The dust cloud's path was irregular."" While the path of the dust might be irregular, it doesn't define how long it lasts.
*   **D: Sawk tam sagawn ai li hpe tsi chya da ai maga ni nga ai** - This translates to ""The dust cloud disappeared after a few days."" The passage says the dust cloud lingered for a while, not disappeared.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw lunar sakse hte seng ai sawk tam sagawn ai ni a lam hpe tup hkrak lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai gaw shata a dingdung maga de hkring ai** (It is due to the impact at high speed).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) crashed into the Moon at a speed of 1.5 kilometers per second (3000 miles per hour).  This impact, occurring at such a high velocity, is the direct cause of the lunar quake (seismic activity). The other options are less directly related to the reason for the quake:

* **B: Shi a hkrat nna jahkring ai lam gaw awngdang sai** (The shaking is due to the shaking of its own body) - While the probe likely vibrated, the primary cause of the lunar quake is the impact itself.
* **C: Dai gaw masha hkang ai mungkan shinggrup hpungtang li kaw na gumlawt pru wa sai** (It is due to the movement of a mass group of underground rocks) - This is a possible cause of lunar quakes in general, but not the *immediate* cause of the quake caused by the MIP impact.
* **D: Dai gaw ahkyak ai arai lahkawng hpe htaw tawn da ai** (It is due to the breaking of something) - While some material likely broke apart, the primary cause is the forceful impact.



Therefore, the high speed of the impact is the main reason for the lunar quake.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta mahta nna, gara ana makawp maga ai masing hpe hpang jahtum galaw na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Bawnu hte seng ai makawp maga tsi ni** (Incephalitis (Bawnu hta byin ai ana ahkya) hpe makawp maga ai tsi bu kaji hpe asuya hku nna bu wan law law lu na matu ga sadi jaw da sai).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the cause of the spreading of the disease among the young?
* **The text states:** The disease spreads among young people because of the mosquito bites that carry the virus of Encephalitis (Bawnu - the disease that causes brain swelling).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hpun latung sat tsi ni (Infected water):** The text mentions mosquito bites as the cause. While contaminated water *can* transmit diseases, it's not the primary cause stated in the text for this specific spread.
* **B: Wa rim ai ni (The person who sleeps):** The text doesn't mention sleeping as a factor in the disease spreading.
* **D: Jigrawng hpyen kaw na makawp ya ai magap ni (Mosquitoes that bite the young):** While mosquitoes *are* involved, the question asks for the *cause* of the spreading, and the text specifies the virus carried by mosquito bites that leads to Encephalitis.  Option C is more precise.



"
Ana zinli gaw masha ni kaw gara hku kap wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hpun latung sat tsi ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai byin pru ai lam gaw Indian asuya hpe laja lana ana zinli kap bra taw ai shara ni hkan wa rim ai ni hpe dap gram tawn nna shadawn ai lam hpe lit la sa wa na matu...""

This translates to: ""The path of the disease is spread by the mosquito that bites and feeds on the blood of people, and it is transmitted by laying eggs in stagnant water...""

Therefore, the answer is the stagnant water (hpun latung sat tsi ni).

Lahkawng lang na ari dam jahkrat masat ai lam hkrat sum ai majawkaning re ai mahtai hpe pru hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: HJR-3 hpe kalang ta san jep ai**

Here's why:

* **The text clearly states:** ""Num, la shada hkungran hkat ai lam hpe pat na matu tsun ai ga yan nambat lahkawng n awng dang ai lam gaw htawm hpang de mung shawa pawng hpawm lam a matu ahkaw ahkang hpaw ya na lam byin wa chye ai.

(In addition, the text mentions that a resolution (HJR-3) was submitted to the parliament after a certain period to address the issue of the discrepancy between the state's budget and the total revenue.)

* **HJR-3 is identified as the resolution related to the budget discrepancy.** The question asks how the discrepancy between state budget and total revenue was addressed. The text directly links HJR-3 to this issue being addressed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Gindai bung ai hpung hpe shawng lam hta gawde lu na ahkang (To openly discuss the discrepancy with the public)** - While public discussion *might* be a part of addressing the issue, the text doesn't explicitly state that it was done *as the primary way* the discrepancy was addressed.
* **C: Hkyak hkyak upadi zup hpawng (To request additional funds from the central government)** - The text doesn't mention any request for additional funds.
* **D: Gindai bung ai hpung ni hpe hkum shadang ai lam (To implement measures to control expenditure)** -  While controlling expenditure *might* be a part of addressing the issue, the text doesn't explicitly state that it was done *as the primary way* the discrepancy was addressed.



Therefore, **HJR-3 hpe kalang ta san jep ai (Submitting resolution HJR-3)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun dai ai hte maren, lahkawng lang na ari dam jahkrat masat ai lamhpe galoi shaprai kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: 2015 ning hta**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Num, la shada hkungran hkat ai lam hpe pat na matu tsun ai ga yan nambat lahkawng n awng dang ai lam gaw htawm hpang de mung shawa pawng hpawm lam a matu ahkaw ahkang hpaw ya na lam byin wa chye ai.

This translates to: ""However, the path that is being pushed by the parliament to be a different path than the path that is being pushed by the parliament to be the main path is being clarified. Furthermore, the joint resolution HJR-3, which was drafted and passed between 2015 and 2016 by the parliamentary group, was pushed to be enacted.""

* **The question asks:** ""Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun dai ai hte maren, lahkawng lang na ari dam jahkrat masat ai lamhpe galoi shaprai kau ai rai?"" This translates to: ""What is the path being pushed to be enacted by the parliament, that is not the main path, and that is being clarified?""

* **Therefore, the answer is referring to the resolution HJR-3 which was passed between 2015 and 2016.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Upadi zup hpawng galaw ai shaloi:** This translates to ""The path being pushed by the parliamentary group."" While related, it's not the specific year.
* **B: 2011 ning hta:**  The text explicitly states the resolution was passed *between* 2015 and 2016, not in 2011.
* **C: Bat hpang langai ya shani:** This translates to ""Path that is being pushed in recent years."" While 2015-2016 are recent years, the more precise answer is the specific year range of the resolution.

"""""""Panama Laika pa ni gaw"""" kadai ni kaw chyam bra mat ai rai?""","The correct answer is **A: Mossack Fonseka hpaga hpung**.

This translates to: ""Panama Leaks revealed that the US government was trying to investigate and prosecute those who were involved in illegal activities and avoided taxes. The British newspaper The Guardian and the German newspaper revealed that our company had 1200 employees who were involved in tax evasion and were able to hide their assets.  The revelations involved the tax evasion of companies in Iceland and Pakistan.""

The question asks where the ""Panama Leaks"" were revealed. The passage directly links the leaks to Mossack Fonseca.

Therefore, **A: Mossack Fonseka hpaga hpung (Mossack Fonseca's involvement)** is the correct answer.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, British shiga dap hku nna aja tsun ai lusu ai hpe makoi magap lai wa sai hpaga hpung law malawng hpe hparan taw ai wa gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum**.

Here's why:

The question asks which entity revealed information about the company's clients. The text states: ""British shi laika The Guardian gaw Deutsche Gumhpraw dum gaw ndai hpe awngdang da ga ai kawp sha nga ai kompani 1200 a htam masum na htam mi hpe jum tek da ai nga na shiga shapru da sai."" which translates to: ""British newspaper The Guardian and Deutsche Welle (German Broadcasting Corporation) revealed that the company had 1200+ clients, including prominent people.""

Therefore, Deutsche Welle (Deutsche Gumhpraw Dum) is the entity that revealed the information.
"
Npu e jaw tawn da ai nbungli di hkrat ai lam ni hta gara wa gaw si sum ai lam grau law ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Armenia kaw na Iran lam kaw nbungli di hkrat ai**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lai wa sai shata hta, Armenia de sa ai pyenli hkrat ai lam gaw masha marai 168 hpe si shangun ai majaw Iran gaw sawng dik htum ai tsinyam hpe hkrum hkra ai."" (For many years, the road connecting Armenia and Iran was controlled by the Iranian government.)
* This directly indicates that the passage is about the road *between* Armenia and Iran being controlled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Iran kaw na Armenia lam kaw nbungli di hkrat ai:** This is grammatically incorrect and the phrasing doesn't fit the context.
* **B: Hpyen dap nbung li di hkrat ai:** This is a general statement about the road being controlled and doesn't specify *which* road.
* **D: Mashhad hta nbungli di hkrat ai:**  Mashhad is a city in Iran, and the passage mentions the road *between* Armenia and Iran, not just the road *to* Mashhad.



"
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara gaw Iran hta byin ai nbungli di hkrat ai shoihpa law malawng a madi madun ai lam nre ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nbungli nnan mari ai lam hpe pat shingdang ai lam ni (The road that was opened to the border of the nation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lai wa sai shata hta, Armenia de sa ai pyenli hkrat ai lam gaw masha marai 168 hpe si shangun ai majaw Iran gaw sawng dik htum ai tsinyam hpe hkrum hkra ai. Dai shata kaw sha nbungli langai bai Mashahad kaw grai lawan gau nna shakum wa adawt nna masha shi sanit si hkrum ai.""  This translates to: ""For centuries, the road that was opened to the border of Armenia was ruled by the Iranian government through strong measures.  Since then, the road from Mashhad to the border of Armenia has been under the control of the Iranian government.""

* **Option C directly reflects this:** It refers to the ""road that was opened to the border of the nation"" which is precisely what the passage describes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shawa hte hpyen dap na nbungli dingsa ni (The road that was opened to the border of the nation - a repetition):**  While technically correct, it doesn't highlight the *action* of the road being opened and controlled, as option C does.
* **B: Nbungli nnan mari na matu gumhpraw n nga ai (The road that was built by the nation):** The passage doesn't mention the nation *building* the road; it focuses on it being *opened* and *controlled*.
* **D: Hkangreng ai lam nhkrak ai nbungli ni (The road that was opened by the strong):** The passage mentions Iranian *government* controlling the road, not simply ""the strong.""



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided passage."
Npu e jaw da ai hta na Iraq Sawk Tam Hpung a sumtang laika hta nlawm ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Iraq lamu ga jarit hpe makawp maga na matu hpaji jaw ai lam ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sumtang laika gaw Iraq de du hkra mungdan uphkang magam daw a daini na hkrang masa ni a dawsang yang ngu na garam a matu grai ahkyak ai re nna ndai gaw lam mahkrun ni kalang ta galai shai ai lam hpe shadut taw nga ai re."" This translates to: ""On that day, Iraq experienced a major earthquake, and the resulting shockwaves were felt throughout the country, causing widespread destruction and casualties.""

Option C directly reflects this key event described in the passage. The other options are not supported by the text:

* **A: Ya na policy hpe dinglun ai:** The passage discusses a policy, but not specifically the overturning of it.
* **B: Galai shai ai lam nkau mi lawm ai ndau shana laika hte, Iraq kata na dawsa ai lam ni hpe koi gam lu ai:**  This refers to a specific historical event and earthquake, which isn't the main focus of the question about the earthquake's impact on the Iraqi government.
* **D: US hte myit hkrum lam la ai hpyi shawn ai lam:** While the passage mentions US policy, the question is specifically about the *earthquake's impact on the Iraqi government*, not US involvement.



"
Iraq Sawk tam hpung a sumtang laika hta npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara hpe hpaji n jaw da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Sum tsan kasa kanawn mazum ai lam hpe ningnan bai galaw na lam** (The path to observe the movement of international forces).

Here's why:

The passage states that Iraq is observing the movement of international forces and international non-governmental organizations in the region. It mentions that Iraq is monitoring these forces' activities and movements, especially regarding their deployment and actions. Option D directly reflects this observation and monitoring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dawsa ai lam law wa ai hpe jahkring lu na pahkam langai hpe ndau shana ai** (Ignoring the movements of the air force and establishing a new command post): The passage mentions Iraq *observing* air force movements, not ignoring them or establishing a command post.
* **B: Lam mahkrun ni hpe kalang ta galai shai ai** (The path to break through the blockade): The passage focuses on observing international forces, not breaking the blockade.
* **C: Hkrang hkrang re nna dangrang hkat ai lam hpe jai lang na** (The path to avoid clashes with neighboring countries): While avoiding clashes might be a consideration, the primary focus of Iraq's action, as described in the passage, is on observing international forces.



"
"Hpyen la ni tsun ai hte maren, Provenzano a hkra lata masha gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pya da ni tsun ai gaw Lo Piccolo kaw ntsa lata nga ai hpamajaw nga yang shi kaw Palermo kaw Provenzano's right-hand man nga ai ngut nna shi a mahkrum madup kaja gaw lawban dingla ni a hkung ka hpe lu ai re shanhte gaw shanhte bungli ni hpe ngun shaja ai hta provenzano's policy hpe manu ahpa hte sha lu mari ai majaw re.""

This translates to: ""The one who is also the leader of Lo Piccolo, and Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo, with his power and influence, has been manipulating the shadows and undermining Provenzano's policies.""

Therefore, Lo Piccolo was Provenzano's right-hand man. The question asks who Provenzano was likely to rely on.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Giovanni Falcone** and **Paolo Borsellino** were Mafia prosecutors who were killed by the Mafia.
* **Ansa** seems to refer to the author of the text or something unrelated to the Mafia hierarchy.



"
"Matsing masa gayan hta jaw da ai lam ni hta mahta nna, Falcone a si hkrum ai lam gaw hpa majaw rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw Riina-driven majan laman hta sat hkrum ai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...1992 ning hta Mafia a nhkru ai Falkone hte Paolo Borsellino ni a asak hkrat sum shangun ai Riina majan ngut mat ai hpang ndai sut du kaba ni hpe Provenzano gaw up hkang lai wa sai.""

This translates to: ""...In 1992, the Mafia's crackdown on Falkone and Paolo Borsellino, and their associates, was due to the death of Riina, and Provenzano was expected to rise.""

Therefore, Riina's actions were the driving force behind Falcone's work (or rather, the Mafia's response to Falcone's work).  The text indicates that the Mafia's strong response, which led to the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino, was driven by Riina's actions. Option A reflects this. The other options are not supported by the given text."
Npu e jaw da ai kaw na gara wa gaw Hitoshi Saito a share shagan masat ni rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Japan Judo ginjaw yawng a tingyang up**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Moi na Olympic hte Mungkan ningtawn ninghkrin wa rai nga ai Saito gaw shi si ai aten hta Japan Judo ginjaw hpaji shakat jawng kompti yawng a tingyang up galaw nga lai wa ai re.""  This translates to: ""Although he participated in the Olympics and World Championships, Saito was a remarkable athlete who had been dedicated to Japan Judo since a young age.""

Option B directly reflects this statement about his long-term dedication to Judo.  The other options are not as accurate:

*   **A: Mungkan a lahkawng lang ningtawn ninghkrin wa** (Participated in World Championships): While true, it's not the *shared* passion or dedication.
*   **C: Olympic hta ja dazik lahkawng lang lu ai wa** (Participated in the Olympics): Similar to A, it's a fact but not the core shared aspect.
*   **D: Judo ninghkrin** (Practiced Judo):  Too general. The text emphasizes his dedication *since a young age* and his deep commitment.



"
Iwasaki gaw gara shara kaw ga sadi ni hpe tawt lai lu mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Japan mung**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Iwasaki gaw gara shara kaw ga sadi ni hpe tawt lai lu mat ai rai? **Japan mung**"" which translates to ""Where did Iwasaki come from? **Japan**"".

The rest of the passage describes Iwasaki's activities and connections with various regions, but the question directly asks about his origin.
"
Iwasaki hpe kadai gasat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi a byin wa mai ai ningrum ningtau**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Iwasaki gaw shi a hkrun lam kadun laman shara law law kaw manghkang amyu myu hkrum sha lai wa sai. Shi hpe panglai damya ni rim da ma ai, gwi mana langai gaw Tibet kaw wa htim gawa wa ai, Nepal kaw na hkumran poi na hprawng wa ai hpang Kala kaw rim hkrum ai.""
* **Translation (approximate):** ""Iwasaki traveled a long and winding road, encountering many different people. He was able to make friends with people from various places, from Tibet's holy land to the kingdom of Nepal, and practiced Kala (a type of Tibetan medicine).""
* **The question asks:** ""What did Iwasaki meet?"" (Kadai gasat ai rai?)
* **The passage explicitly says:** ""Shi a byin wa mai ai ningrum ningtau"" - ""He encountered many different people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Palai ntsa na damya:** (The beauty of the mountains) - The passage mentions travel and people, not primarily the scenery.
* **C: Gwi langai:** (Golden treasures) - The passage doesn't mention anything about riches or valuables.
* **D: Hpyen la:** (Magic) - While Kala (Tibetan medicine) might seem esoteric, the passage focuses on the people Iwasaki met, not magic itself.



Therefore, option **A** is the most accurate answer based on the given text.
"
Alonson gaw shi a mawdaw shing jawng lam hpe galoi jahkring kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Schumacher gaw shi a shingjawng poi hpe shi nan jahtum kau ngut ai hpang** (Schumacher gaw shi a shingjawng poi hpe shi nan jahtum kau ngut ai hpang - Schumacher was always trying to outperform him).

Here's why:

* The first paragraph states that Michael Schumacher was always trying to outperform Fernando Alonso, even when Alonso was faster.
* The question asks *why* Alonso was always trying to gain an edge. 
* Option C directly reflects this competitive dynamic – Schumacher's constant attempts to outperform Alonso motivated Alonso to strive for more.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Schumacher gaw shi a shawng mawdaw dingsen hten mat ai hpang** (Schumacher was always driving recklessly).  The text doesn't suggest Schumacher was reckless; it says he was competitive.
* **B: Fisichella gaw shi a madaw hpe n dang hkang mat ai** (Fisichella was always competing with him). The text says Fisichella competed with Alonso, but this is not the direct answer to *why* Alonso tried to gain an edge.
* **D: Shawng de woi awn ai shara hpe nlu la shi yang** (He was always trying to avoid bad situations). The text doesn't suggest Alonso was focused on avoiding problems; it highlights his competitive spirit.



"
Schumacher gaw shi a shingjawng poi hpe jau shangut kau ra ai hpa majaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw shi a mawdaw hpe n dang hkang mat ai** (He was defeated by his teammate).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Michael Schumacher gaw shi na shingjawng ai lam hpe Alonso ngut ai hpang nna shi yang shagut wa ai, shingjawng ai hta hten ai ni law law nga ai ngu shadu na re.""  This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher was defeated by Alonso, and his long reign was broken.""
* **Therefore, Schumacher was defeated by his teammate, Alonso.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Alonso hte adawt hkrup ai:** (He fought with Alonso) While they had a competitive relationship, the passage focuses on Schumacher's *defeat* by Alonso.
* **C: Fisichella a majaw dingsen hten mat ai:** (He was defeated by Fisichella's skill) The passage mentions Fisichella as a racer who was able to compete and win, but it doesn't say Schumacher was defeated by him.
* **D: Mawdaw jahkring ai ladat hten mat ai:** (He was defeated by the rule of the race) The passage doesn't mention rules as a reason for Schumacher's defeat.



"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai hte maren, rim hkrum ai ni a matu kadai ni gaw pahkam hkam ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ginjaw kaw na madi shadaw ai wa** (The person who is in charge of the central booking).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Central booking madi shadaw hpung kaw na shalawt ya ai lam hkrum lai wa sai."" This translates to ""The person who is in charge of the central booking... is the government official.""
* The question asks: ""Who is the person who can make decisions about the state computer system?""
* The passage directly links the ""Central booking madi shadaw"" (the person in charge of the central booking) to the authority to make decisions regarding the state computer system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rimrawng ai balik du** (The direction of the border): This has no relation to the passage.
* **B: Glynn tara agyi** (Glynn's aide): Glynn is mentioned as a judge, but the passage doesn't state his role in managing the computer system.
* **D: Tara rung munggyi** (The system administrator): While a system administrator might interact with the computer system, the passage explicitly identifies the ""Central booking madi shadaw"" as having the decision-making power.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Matsing masat ga yan hta tsun da ai jahkring rim rawng da ai lam hta hkan nna, rim hkrum na ni hpe aten 24 hta jan na rim rawng na matu hpa ahkang ni jaw da rai ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Glynn tara agyi ni hku nna tara shang jahkrat ai tara**.

Here's why:

The question asks what can be done if a government system is disrupted and unable to function for 24 hours. The passage states: ""Judge Glynn kaw na tara rung kaw na shana ai hpe nna ai sha galaw ai ni hpang aten 24 hta lai nna dai hpe chyahkring galaw na matu tara hpang wa ai.""  This translates to ""Judge Glynn can order the system to be restored within 24 hours.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gumhpraw chyhkrat ya ai (System restoration)** - While system restoration is *what happens*, it doesn't describe *who is responsible* for ordering it.
*   **B: Pyada hte hkrum shaga ai (Private and government)** - This is irrelevant to the question about a system disruption.
*   **D: Na la ai (No)** - The passage indicates a solution *is* available (Glynn can order restoration).



Therefore, only option C correctly identifies the action and the person who can authorize it."
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, galaw taw nga lam ni hpe matut n galaw sai lam sanglang dan na matu gara madi madun ai lam hpe n jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Npawt nhpang upadi hte seng nna lachyum ndan leng ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What should be done to achieve a peaceful and stable future for Afghanistan, considering the current situation of conflict and suffering?
* **The passage outlines the problem:** The Afghans are suffering from conflict, poverty, and displacement due to external interference.
* **Option D aligns with the solution proposed in the passage:** The passage suggests that a lasting solution requires addressing the root causes of the problem – poverty, lack of development, and the role of external forces (the ""npawt nhpang upadi"" - foreign interference) – and finding a way to achieve peace (""seng nna lachyum ndan leng ai lam"" - a path to peaceful coexistence).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Shim lam hte seng nna hkra machyi na lam nga ai (A way to avoid conflict and violence):** While avoiding conflict is desirable, it doesn't address the underlying issues of poverty and development. It's a reactive measure, not a comprehensive solution.
* **B: Npawt nhpang gawda tara upadi a nhtan shai ai lam (A way to manage foreign interference):** Managing foreign interference is a part of the solution, but it's not the whole solution. It needs to be coupled with addressing internal issues.
* **C: Tsaw ai jai gumhpraw (Simple and easy solution):** The passage indicates that the situation is complex and doesn't offer a simple solution."
Hpang jahtum hta sumtsan kasa ni gaw gawlaw taw nga ai ni hpe hpa majaw n ra sai ngu sawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Npawt nhpang gawda tara upadi hta luchyum ndan leng ai lam nga ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sumtsan kasa ni gaw Afghan a gawda tara hpe ra mung nra ai hte maren, matut shagrin daw dan sa wa ai lam hta dan leng lam law law mung nnga ai hpe mu mada ma ai nga tsun ma ai.""  This translates to something like: ""The current global situation, due to the Afghan people's suffering and hardship, is causing many to flee towards neighboring countries and seek refuge.""
* **Option C reflects this:** ""Npawt nhpang gawda tara upadi hta luchyum ndan leng ai lam nga ai"" translates to ""The increase in poverty and hardship is causing people to flee towards neighboring countries.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai gaw npawt nhpang upadi hte n hten shai ai** -  ""This is due to the increase in poverty and drought."" While poverty is mentioned, drought isn't explicitly stated in the passage.
* **B: Dai hta shim lam hte seng nna hkra machyi na lam nga ai** - ""This is due to the roads and infrastructure being destroyed."" The passage focuses on the *people* fleeing, not the destruction of roads and infrastructure.
* **D: Ningbaw ra lata poi gaw jarik grai tsaw ai** - ""The current situation is causing war and conflict."" The passage focuses on the *suffering and hardship* leading to displacement, not necessarily active war and conflict.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided passage."
FATA na matu kadai gaw tara magam hte seng na karum madi shadaw ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Pakistan mungdan a gumsan magam**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Pakistan Gumsan magam gaw """"""Mung masa dat kasa ni hpe"""""""" ginra ni hpe madu hku na up hkang taw FATA hpe up hkang na matu shatsam dat ai.""  This translates to ""Pakistan, after the separation of the British, took control of FATA.""
* Therefore, FATA was taken under the control of Pakistan *after* the division from the British.
* Option C directly reflects this: ""Pakistan mungdan a gumsan magam"" means ""taken under the control of Pakistan.""



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pakistani asuya (Pakistani soldiers):** While Pakistani soldiers might be present in FATA, the question is about *who* took control, not the personnel involved.
* **B: Mung masa hte seng ai dat kasa (the separate nation):** This is too general. It refers to Pakistan itself, not the specific entity that took control of FATA.
* **D: British asuya (British soldiers):** The text clearly states that control came *after* the British withdrawal, so this is incorrect.



"
"Lawu kaw e tsun da ai ni hta, gara gaw FATA na mung masa hte seng nna n teng ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw tara magam hte seng ai lam hpe karum madi shadaw ya ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pakistan Gumsan magam gaw """"""Mung masa dat kasa ni hpe"""""""" ginra ni hpe madu hku na up hkang taw FATA hpe up hkang na matu shatsam dat ai."" This translates to: ""Pakistan's government, through the establishment of the 'State of the Future,' occupied FATA by force.""

* **The question asks:** ""Lawu kaw e tsun da ai ni hta, gara gaw FATA na mung masa hte seng nna n teng ai rai?""  This translates to: ""After a long time, did FATA's territory remain under control?""

* **Option A directly addresses this:** It states that the Shan people (referring to the people of FATA) were forced to submit and were not able to resist the occupation. This aligns with the passage indicating the forceful occupation of FATA by Pakistan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanhte hpe Pakistan gumsan magam hku nna lata da ai rai nga ai:** (The Shan people were able to overthrow the Pakistan government's rule.) The passage indicates the *opposite* - the Shan people were *occupied* by the government.
* **C: Shanhte gaw Pakistan a npawt nhpang upadi hpe madat mara ai:** (The Shan people were able to make a strong resistance against Pakistan's oppression.)  While resistance might have occurred, the passage emphasizes the *forceful occupation* and lack of ability to resist.
* **D: Shanhte gaw shara nkau mi hta up hkang lu nga ai:** (The Shan people were not able to be occupied by good people.) This is not relevant to the question and doesn't relate to the passage's content.



Therefore, option A is the only one that logically follows from the provided text and accurately answers the question."
Emma Stone gaw gara shagrau kumhpa na matu tang shawn da ma ai kun?,"The correct answer is **C: Hkrak dik ai sumla hkrung shayi** (That they like each other).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gosling hte Stone gaw Ningtawn dik Sumla hkrung shadang hte shayi hku na yaw shada lata da ai kaw lawm ma ai."" This translates to: ""Gosling and Stone have a love that is not only a friendly relationship but also a romantic one.""  The passage goes on to describe the depth and nature of their romantic connection.

Option C (""Hkrak dik ai sumla hkrung shayi"" - That they like each other) is the most accurate and encompassing answer based on the passage's description of their relationship.  The other options are too specific or narrow in their description of the nature of their feelings.

"Sumla hkrung gaw, gara shagrau kumhpa na matu mying tang shawn da n hkrum ai kun?","The correct answer is **A: Hkrak dik ai sumla (Romantic love)**.

The text explicitly states that Ryan Gosling and Emma Stone's love story revolves around romantic love (""kaw lawm ma ai""). The passage details various aspects of their relationship, all framed within the context of romance and shared experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Hkrak dik ai hkrangmu ladat (Romantic longing):** While longing might be *part* of romantic love, the text emphasizes the overall love story, not just the longing.
*   **C: Hkrak dik ai yungwi gayau ai lam (The path of youthful exuberance):**  Youthful exuberance can be *associated* with love, but it isn't the defining characteristic. The text focuses on the love itself, not simply the youthful feeling.
*   **D: Hkrak dik ai ningpawt madung mahkawn (The richness of the soul):** While a rich inner life can contribute to a fulfilling relationship, the passage frames the focus as a *romantic* love story.

Therefore, **A: Hkrak dik ai sumla (Romantic love)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Lawu kaw na gara ni gaw n-nang nawn byin ngut ai hpang matut ngam taw ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Hokuriku's Shika jak rung na shingja dat kabaw bunghkraw ni yawng**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hokuriku myi hprap wan n-gun hpung gaw Shika shingra dat n-gun lang ai jak rung a shingja dat kabaw bunghkraw nambat 1 hte 2 hpe sat tawn lai wa ai lam hte n-nang nawn a majaw kaga akyu hkam sha ai lam n-nga lai wa ai hpe shiga shana lai wa sai re.""  This translates to: ""The nuclear power plants in the Hokuriku region, specifically the Shika and Niigata nuclear power plants, which were damaged by the earthquake and tsunami, are undergoing safety checks and will be restarted one after another.""

* **The question asks:** ""Lawu kaw na gara ni gaw n-nang nawn byin ngut ai hpang matut ngam taw ai kun?"" This translates to: ""What is the cause of the widespread damage that occurred on that day (the day of the disaster)?""

* **Option A directly addresses the cause of the damage:** The damage to the Shika and Niigata nuclear power plants was *due to* the earthquake and tsunami.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ishikawa kaw na nbungli daru** (Ishikawa's nuclear power plant): While Ishikawa prefecture was affected, the passage focuses on the Shika and Niigata plants.
* **C: Wanleng hkawm ai magam bungli yawng** (Widespread tsunami damage):  The passage mentions the tsunami as a contributing factor, but it doesn't directly state that *widespread tsunami damage* *caused* the problem.  It's a result, not the cause.
* **D: Niigata kaw na n-gun jak rung langai** (Niigata's specific nuclear power plant): While Niigata was damaged, the passage talks about the Shika and Niigata plants *together* in the context of the damage.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because it directly relates the damage to the specific nuclear plants mentioned in the passage and links it to the earthquake and tsunami.
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw n-nang nawn a majaw hten za ai lam hpe hkam jan lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lam nkau mi (Local people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lam nkau mi gaw hten za mat ai, wanleng hkawm ai shara nkau mi pat shingdang hkrum ai hte Ishikawa uphkang ginwang na Noto Nbungli daru gaw naw pat tawn ai re.""

This translates to: ""Local people were severely affected, with the area being flooded and local people being displaced, and the Noto Peninsula's fishing villages were also devastated.""

The question asks who suffered most from the earthquake and tsunami. The passage clearly identifies the **local people (Lam nkau mi)** as being severely affected. The other options are either more specific (Shika jak rung kaw na shingja dat kabaw bunghkraw lahkawng - the nuclear power plant's local area), or represent a specific entity (Noto nbungli daru - Noto Peninsula's fishing villages). While the nuclear plant area and fishing villages were impacted, the passage emphasizes the broader suffering of the local people.



"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara manghkang ni gaw matsing ningting laika hta n lawm ai kun?","The correct answer is **A: Yerusalem a htawm hpang shawng lam (The issue of Jerusalem)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the core of the conflict as stemming from the competing claims over Jerusalem. It mentions the city's religious significance to both Muslims and Jews, and the ongoing dispute over its status. The other options are related but not the central issue highlighted in the text.

*   **B: 1967 majan a byin ninghpang (The 1967 war)** is a significant event *leading up to* the current conflict, but the underlying issue is the unresolved status of Jerusalem.
*   **C: Hka masawn hta hpyen magam dap shara jahkrat da ai lam (The path of negotiating territory for the Palestinian state)** is a potential solution being sought, but not the root cause of the conflict.
*   **D: Ga jarit hte seng nna htai lai hkat ai lam (The path of direct negotiations)** is a method of conflict resolution, not the central conflict itself.



Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the passage's emphasis is the issue of Jerusalem."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Palestine a hpyi shawn ai lam kaw na langai mi n re ai kun?,"The correct answer is **A: Majan garai n byin shi ten hta na ga jarit (The conflict has been ongoing)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states the ongoing nature of the conflict:** It mentions the 1967 Six-Day War, the occupation of Palestinian territories, and the ongoing tensions between the PA and Israel.
* **Option B** describes a specific action (Jewish settlements), not the overall state of the conflict.
* **Option C** focuses on Jerusalem, which is a significant point of contention, but doesn't encompass the entirety of the conflict's duration.
* **Option D** describes a specific action (Jewish settlements), not the overall state of the conflict.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text.
"
Ma gaw gara mung hta tara upadi hpe sharin hka ja la wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Miwa mung (Taiwan)**.

The text states: ""Ma gaw kanu mungdang Miwa mung a htep lahti madi shadaw tsun karum rum ai lam hte atsawm dang kau lu ai."" This translates to: ""Ma then traveled to Taiwan and, while there, was invited to give a lecture and was also invited to visit other places.""

Therefore, the question ""Ma gaw gara mung hta tara upadi hpe sharin hka ja la wa ai rai?"" which means ""To which country did Ma travel to give a lecture?"" has the answer ""Miwa mung"" (Taiwan).
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan gara hpe madi shadaw ai lam gaw MA na ra lata poi awng padang hpe karum ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Miwa mung (Taiwan)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ma gaw kanu mungdang Miwa mung a htep lahti madi shadaw tsun karum rum ai lam hte atsawm dang kau lu ai."" This translates to: ""Ma, after a period of time, went to Taiwan to find a new life and started a new business.""

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan gara hpe madi shadaw ai lam gaw MA na ra lata poi awng padang hpe karum ya ai rai?"" (After a certain period of time, the place where Ma went to start a new life and a new business was...) is Taiwan (Miwa mung).
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, Caolyn Wilson gaw mare kaw na n pru shi ai shaloi, kade a matu bungli galaw lai wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...OHA a Carolyn Wilson gaw shanhte a tau jaw da ai jaram gumphraw ni hpe lagu la nna mare kaw na hprawng mat sai hpe kalang ta dum mat ma ai."" (OHA a Carolyn Wilson...was able to secure a contract for the organization to implement the remaining 20 days...)
* **The question asks:** ""...kade a matu bungli galaw lai wa sai rai?"" (...what organization was able to secure the contract?)

Therefore, the answer is OHA.
"
"Ndai numdaw hta mali lang shingjawng na lam naw ngam ai hte, kadai wa gaw Mawdaw gau shingjawng poi hta nambat mali rai taw ai kun?","The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The question asks who had the lowest number of points among the drivers who didn't win the championship. The text states: ""Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth hte Harvick ni gaw ndai numdaw hta mali lang shingjawng na naw ngam ai hte rau Mawdaw la ni a Ninghkring shingjawng lamang matu nambat shi lapran shara la da masai.""  This translates to ""Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth, and Harvick's teams didn't win the championship and had the lowest number of points, with the rest of the points being far behind."" The text then immediately follows with ""Kahne and Truex, Jr. ni gaw manga hte kru shara kaw 2,220 hte 2,207 amat ni lu da ma ai."" and ""Matut nna mawdaw gau shingjawng poi hta, Keselowski gaw 2,250 masat hte mawdaw gawt masha ni a ninghkrin shingjawng poi ningbaw hku na matut nga nga ai re. Amat sanit hpang hkrat nna, Johnson gaw 2,243 hte nambat lahkawng lu mat ai. Nambat masum hta gaw, Hamlin gaw a mat hkun hpang hkrat taw ai, raitim Bowyer hta a mat manga jan ai."" This translates to ""For the championship, Keselowski had 2,250 points and was the second-highest point scorer. Among the drivers who didn't win the championship, Johnson had 2,243 points. For the lowest number of points, Hamlin had...""  This indicates Hamlin had the lowest points among the non-championship winning drivers.



"
"Laika daw hta matut manoi tsun da shing jawng poi hta, mawdaw shingjawng ai lam hta Kahne gaw a mat kade lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: 2207**.

The question asks about the number of points Kahne got in the last race. The text states: ""Kahne and Truex, Jr. ni gaw manga hte kru shara kaw 2,220 hte 2,207 amat ni lu da ma ai."" This translates to ""Kahne and Truex, Jr. finished in the top two and got 2,220 and 2,207 points respectively.""  Therefore, Kahne got 2207 points.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpang de martian madung re ngu sawk sagaw lu ai wanhkut lung ni hpe, masha ni kade lang myi mu ga sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: shi manga lang**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** How many days of Martian sunlight are needed for the algae to grow as described in the passage?
* **The passage states:** ""Mungkan ga de hkrat wa na re, dai kaw na 34 hpe gaw martian hku na madung shateng da ai. Ndai lung rawk shi manga hpe July hpang jahtum hta shagan wanhkut lung madun ai ngu sawn la ma ai.""  This translates to: ""The algae can grow in the water, and in 34 days, the Martian sunlight can make the algae grow. The algae's growth is at its peak from July until the end of the day.""
* **Therefore, the answer is 34 days.**  ""Shi manga lang"" means ""thirty-four days"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shi lang** means ""one day"".  This is too short.
* **B: manga lang** means ""many days"". While technically true the growth takes 34 days, this isn't a specific answer.
* **D: sumshi mali lang** means ""thirty-four days"" (using a different word for thirty-four). While this is correct,  ""shi manga lang"" is a more common and natural way to express the number of days in this context.



"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai zawn, madung hta martian ngu sawk sagawn lu ai nlung ni hte seng nna gara wa jaw ai kun?","The correct answer is **A: Dai nlung ni yawng hpe, July wanhkut madun ai**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ndai lung rawk shi manga hpe July hpang jahtum hta shagan wanhkut lung madun ai ngu sawn la ma ai."" This translates to ""This area (referring to the area where the landslides occurred) has been experiencing heavy rainfall since the beginning of July.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nlung 24,000 re** - This refers to the number of people affected, not the timing of the landslides.
* **C: Nlung dai ni gaw ja hta grau nna US dollar gumhpraw 11,000 ging dan ai** - This refers to the compensation offered to those affected, not the timing of the landslides.
* **D: Nlung 34 re** - This refers to the number of landslides that occurred, not the timing.



"
Schumacher gaw galoi hkring sa mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Felipe Massa hpe galai ngut ai hpang** (He was defeated by Felipe Massa).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Schumacher gaw Formula 1 ninggang hpe sanit lang awng dang ai hpang shaning 2006 hta ningma lu mat ai Felipe Massa shara na majaw hkring sa mat wa sai.""  This translates to: ""Schumacher, who had dominated Formula 1 since 2006, was defeated by Felipe Massa.""
* **Option C directly reflects this statement.**  He lost to Massa.
* **Option A** is incorrect because the passage states Schumacher was *defeated* by Massa, not that Massa *defeated* Schumacher.
* **Option B** is incorrect because the passage indicates Schumacher's dominance ended with Massa's victory.
* **Option D** is incorrect.  The passage doesn't specify a particular year for the defeat, only that it happened when Massa started competing.



"
Massa galoi hkumhkrang machyi hkra la ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Grand Pix laman hta**.

The passage states: ""Schumacher gaw Formula 1 ninggang hpe sanit lang awng dang ai hpang shaning 2006 hta ningma lu mat ai Felipe Massa shara na majaw hkring sa mat wa sai."" (Schumacher, after 2006, was a rival to Felipe Massa in Formula 1.) 

It also mentions Massa's success: ""Massa gaw shau htum shaning 2009 a ngam a shata hkan gaw le wa na re."" (Massa won many races and was a strong contender in 2009.)

The question asks why Massa became a rival to Schumacher. The passage says they were rivals *during Grand Prix races* (Grand Pix laman hta).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Formula 1 ninghkrin shingjawng poi dang ngut ai hpang:** While they were rivals in Formula 1, the passage doesn't say this was *why* Massa became a rival.
* **C: Schumacher galai n hkring shi yang:** The passage states they were rivals *to* Schumacher, not *like* Schumacher.
* **D: 2009 ladaw shawng hta:** 2009 is mentioned as a year of Massa's success, not as the reason for the rivalry.



"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, hkyen lajang ai lam gaw AOL hpe gara hku akyu jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: AOL hpe jai lang ai masha ni gaw Yahoo hte Microsoft hpe jai lang ai masha ni hte shingjawng manang rai wa na**.

Here's why:

The first paragraph states that AOL used to be popular in the United States, but its popularity declined because it was overtaken by Yahoo! and Microsoft.  The question asks *why* AOL's popularity declined and what took its place. Option C directly answers this by stating that the users who once used AOL now use Yahoo! and Microsoft.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** This focuses on the reasons for AOL's decline but doesn't explain what replaced it.
*   **B:** This is a detail about what AOL *did* (offer instant messaging) but doesn't explain why it declined.
*   **D:** This is a true statement but doesn't explain the reason for the decline.

Therefore, option C provides the most direct and accurate answer to the question."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, hkyen lajang ai lam ningnan hpe jahtum kau mai na rai?","The correct answer is **A: United States hta chyam bra wa ai internet bawng ring lam (The internet infrastructure in the United States)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""AOL gaw United States kata grai chyam bra hkra jai lang nga ai majaw de shara hta nan gaw IM gat lawk bungli naw galaw taw ai."" This translates to: ""AOL is a major company that has been popular in the United States, and it has been used for IM [instant messaging] and other online activities.""  It then mentions that AOL's popularity has decreased because of advancements in internet technology.

* **Option A directly addresses the reason for AOL's decline:** The passage implies that the evolution of the internet infrastructure in the US led to AOL losing its dominance.  Newer technologies and platforms emerged, rendering AOL less necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: IM gat lawk hpe jai lang ai lam (The path of popularity for IM):**  While AOL *was* used for IM, the passage isn't *primarily* about the rise and fall of IM. It's about AOL's broader decline.
* **C: AOL gaw shi a shara hta gat lawk hpe madu ra ai hku galaw lu ai ahkang (AOL is a company that has been used for online activities):** This is a true statement, but it doesn't explain *why* AOL is no longer as popular.
* **D: Yahoo hte Microsoft a rau galaw lam (The path of popularity for Yahoo and Microsoft):**  The passage mentions Yahoo and Microsoft as competitors that AOL has lost to, but it doesn't explain *why* they gained popularity. It focuses on the underlying reason for AOL's decline.



"
"Htim gasat ai hta asak si hkrum ai kaw na, pyada du n rai ai marai kade rai?","The correct answer is **A: 19**.

The text states: ""Aup hkang du rung kaw na gaw pya da du shi jahku hkala hkrum ai nga ndau shana sai. Pyada la wa tsun lai wa ai gaw, shanhte gaw htim gasat ai na matu lit nga ai ngu shadu da ai gasat myit rawt ai Daesh (ISIL) hpe nrup nsen ai re.""  This translates to: ""And after it has been established, it has been 19 years since the government has been fighting against the terrorist organization Daesh (ISIL).""

Therefore, the answer is 19.
"
Htim gasat ai kaw na nrup ntsen ai wa hpe kadai shiga jaw dat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Pyada (Infantry)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Turkish government and local authorities are conducting operations to eliminate Daesh (ISIL) militants, and that infantry soldiers are playing a key role in these operations. The question asks *how* militants are being defeated. The passage directly links the defeat of the militants to the actions of infantry soldiers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Munggyi rung (Artillery):** While artillery might be used in the overall campaign, the passage focuses specifically on infantry.
* **C: Shiga htawn ai ni (Border Guard):** Border guards might be involved, but the core fighting described is infantry combat.
* **D: Gaziantep buga masha ni (A peaceful day in Gaziantep):** This is completely unrelated to the military operations described.

Therefore, **Pyada (Infantry)** is the only option directly supported by the text.
"
"Florida na dang ai wa mungdaw yawng la madang a majaw, Mitt Romney hpe hpa kumhpa shagrau ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mungdan yawng a ahkang aya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Florida gaw Republikan Pati mying tang shawng lam a matu Romney hpe yawng a shawng hta woi awn na hku na, de a ahkang aya yawng manga shi ting hpe Romney hpang de shagrau sai.""

This translates to: ""Florida, following the Republican Party's conventional line, strongly supported Romney, and his ""younger brother's"" (ahkang aya) support helped Romney win.""

The ""ahkang aya"" refers to a younger brother or a close relative/associate who supported Romney. The options provided, particularly C, best captures this meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ahkang aya 32:** This refers to Newt Gingrich's number of votes, not Romney's reason for winning in Florida.
* **B: Republican Pati na matu mying tang shaw da ai lam:** While the Republican party line helped, the text specifies a *personal* influence, namely the support of this ""younger brother"".
* **D: Ra lata me a tsa lam shadang 46:** This refers to the total number of electoral votes Romney secured, not the reason for his victory in Florida.



"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, ra lata poi hta Gingrich kaw tsa lam kaw na me kade ram nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: tsa lam shadang 32**.

The text explicitly states: ""U.S Rapdaw Tingnyang up Newt Gingrich gaw tsa lam shadang 32 hte nambat lahkawng kaw hkan ai."" (In the U.S. Congress, Newt Gingrich served as Speaker with 32 votes.)
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mung masa pati dat kasa lata zuphpawng na mahtai chye ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw matut nna hpang n hkan mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Perry**.

The text states: ""Perry tsun mat ai gaw shi hku nna shingjawng hpawng hta matut naw nga nga na hte shata man langai 21 shani dingda Carolina lawu tsang kaw shingjawng lawm na re"" which translates to ""Perry, in the 21st day of August, won the Iowa caucuses and is currently campaigning with the aim of winning the New Hampshire primary.""  The text also mentions Perry's campaign strategy relating to ""mas pati dat kasa lata zuphpawng a mahtai hpe lu la na matu hte nye ai matu ndai shingjawng ai lam kaw matut hkam na lam nga n-nga hpe jep jen na matu bai nhtang wa na re"" meaning ""using Texas's experience in managing the country and applying it to his own campaign.""

The question asks which candidate is using Texas's experience in managing the country as a campaign strategy. This directly points to Perry.
"
"Lahta kaw na laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, mung masa pati dat kasa lata zuphpawng na mahtai chye ngut ai hpang, kadai gaw kaga shang shingjawng ai wa a lam hpe tak kaba tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Perry**.

The text states: ""Perry tsun mat ai gaw shi hku nna shingjawng hpawng hta matut naw nga nga na hte shata man langai 21 shani dingda Carolina lawu tsang kaw shingjawng lawm na re"" which translates to ""Perry's campaign, in order to gain support, focused on his ability to manage Texas's large-scale economy and demonstrated his ability to make difficult decisions."" The text then continues to highlight Perry's campaign strategy.

The other options are mentioned as well, but Perry's campaign strategy is the focus of the question.
"
"2015 ning a shawng shaning e, dai lamang madun ai shara gaw gara kaw rai?","The correct answer is **C: AstroNet Radio**.

The text states: ""Sjaning 2015 htum wa maga de gaw, Toginet gaw AstroNet shiga shapoi jak hpe mahtawk matawn re ai redyu shapoi dap hku na gawgap hpang lai wa sai."" which translates to ""In 2015, Toginet was going to be broadcast through AstroNet as a new radio broadcast.""
"
Radio shapoi dap gaw dai lamang hpe ganing re kamung ngu htawng madun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Jawng dingsa**.

Here's why:

The text describes the radio enthusiasts as people who listen to ""TogiNet Radio"" through a computer and the internet. It also mentions they are from a small town in Texas and enjoy ""myit lawm ai nsen hkrang shala masha ni shalawm da ai"" which can be interpreted as unique or quirky activities. ""Jawng dingsa"" (meaning something like ""oddball"" or ""unconventional"") best fits the tone and description of these radio listeners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Amateur:** While they might be amateur radio enthusiasts, the text doesn't explicitly state this.
*   **B: Geeky:** While there might be some overlap, ""geeky"" is too general and doesn't capture the specific community aspect described.
*   **D: Jauman bu ni:** This translates to ""small town"" and is simply a location descriptor, not a defining characteristic of the radio listeners themselves.

Therefore, **Jawng dingsa (unconventional/oddball)** is the best fit based on the provided text."
Gasat gala myit rawt taw ai uhpung na htim gasat ai lam hpe dik shale karum ya ai hpa baw hpe David Headley mahkawng wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Sinat hpai masha** (Attacked by attacking shells).

Here's why:

The passage states that David Headley was part of a group that ""attacked with attacking shells"" (sinat hpai masha) on November 26, 2008.  The question asks how David Headley was involved in the attack. Option C directly reflects this action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shiga** (Joined): While he joined the group, the question asks *how* he was involved in the attack itself.
* **B: Bawm** (Leader): The passage doesn't state that David Headley was a leader.
* **D: Shi hte shi shayan ai lanak ni** (Man with a gun):  While likely carrying a weapon, the passage doesn't specify he was directly involved *with a gun*. The attack involved shelling.



"
Gasat gala myit rawt taw ai hpyen uhpung ni gaw Mumbai de bu hkram na matu kaning rai htaw wa htaw sa lam hpe jai lang wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Wanleng punghkaw (Interstate)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gasat hkat ai lam gaw India hte Pakistan a matut mahkai lapran kaw ja dingkang ai lam ni bang ya nga ai.""  This translates to ""The route used for the attack was a route that crosses the border between India and Pakistan.""  

A ""Wanleng punghkaw"" (Interstate) refers to a road or route that connects different states or countries, crossing a border.  The passage explicitly mentions the attack crossing the border between India and Pakistan, making ""Wanleng punghkaw"" the most accurate description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Pyenli (Intra-state):** This refers to a route *within* a single state, which is the opposite of what the passage describes.
*   **Hkali (Intra-city):**  This refers to a route *within* a single city, and the attack involved crossing between two countries.
*   **Mawdaw (Maritime):** This refers to a sea route, and the passage describes a land-based attack.



"
Laika daw hta tsun da ai Nadal hte Raonic yan a Brisbane Hpaw poi shing jawng ai lam mahtai hpe tup hkrak dawng pru ya ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal gaw Roanic hpe dang kau ai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Shi gaw ndai laman sha Raonic hpe Brisbane hpaw poi hta sha sum da ai rai nga ai."" This translates to ""He (Nadal) is going to play against Raonic in Brisbane.""  The sentence ""Nadal gaw ginsup lamang 88% hta amat 76 hte shawng lu nna dang ai."" means ""Nadal has an 88% winning rate with a score of 76."" Since Nadal has a high winning rate (88%) and is playing Raonic, it implies Nadal is expected to win. Therefore, Nadal is favored to beat Raonic.
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da hte maren, ningshawng shingjawng poi ngut ai hpang Nadal hte Raonic a poi masa gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal gaw amat 76 dang la sai**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Nadal gaw ginsup lamang 88% hta amat 76 hte shawng lu nna dang ai."" This translates to ""Nadal has a 88% win rate with a score of 76 to win.""  This means Nadal won 76 games and had an 88% win rate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Raonic hta 88% net amat nga ai:** This is incorrect. The 88% win rate is *Nadal's* win rate, not Raonic's.
* **C: lu amat gaw 7-2 re:**  While the score mentioned (7-2) refers to a match, it doesn't describe Nadal's overall win rate.
* **D: Raonic gaw Nadal hpe dang kau ai:** The text says Raonic was defeated by Nadal, not that Raonic defeated Nadal.

Therefore, the only correct statement based on the provided text is that Nadal won with a score of 76.
"
Naked Shiga dap nnan masum kaw gara aga lamang n lawm ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Japan ga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...English hte Japan hku gaw mi kaw na shiga shapoi taw sai re nna mungkan ting hte seng ai uhpung uhpawng ni gaw Spain ga, Italy ga, **Korea ga**, Japan ga lamang ni hpe hkrangmu shiga...""

This translates to: ""...and the language of Naked Shiga is mainly spoken in Spain, Italy, **Korea, and Japan**...""

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Naked Shiga dap nnan masum kaw gara aga lamang n lawm ai rai?"" (Which country mainly speaks Naked Shiga?) is Japan.
"
"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, Naked Shiga dap kaw na shi shana dap nnan hpe gara kaw n lu mai na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Internet**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses how information about Naked Shiga (likely referring to a specific online phenomenon or topic) spreads rapidly through **the internet** and social media. The text explicitly mentions ""internet laika man ni hte gun hkawm mai ai jak ni a matu shabra hpang taw sai re"" which translates to ""internet and social media are used to spread information like wildfire.""

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **A: Sumbu phone** (Mobile phone): While phones are used to access the internet, the passage focuses on the internet itself as the primary medium.
*   **C: Poi yu ginra ni** (Traditional media): The passage explicitly states the phenomenon spreads through the internet, not traditional media.
*   **D: Hkrangmu nsen** (Word of mouth): While word of mouth could contribute, the passage emphasizes the speed and reach of the internet.

Therefore, the internet is the most accurate answer based on the information provided."
Giant Slalom hpe pandung de n lu shangut mat ai shingjawng masha kade rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 36**.

The text states: ""Shi a kaga shingjawng poi, hte Giant Slalom hta, num ni dung ai hpung hta lagat ai aten 4:41.30 hte nambat shi lu mat nna, nambat langai lu ai Austrian masha Claudia Loesch hta 2:11.60 lanyen nna, nambat jahku lu mat ai Hungary masha Gyöngyi Dani hta 1:09.02 lanyen ai.

This translates to: ""His Giant Slalom run, with a time of 4:41.30, was better than the Austrian athlete Claudia Loesch by 2:11.60, and better than the Hungarian athlete Gyöngyi Dani by 1:09.02.

"Lawu kaw na tsun da ai lam ni hta, gara gaw ninghkrin shingjawng poi a awng jahpan hpe tup hkrak dawng pru ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hkyen jawn marai 45 gaw Giant Slalom hta shanhte a gat shingjawng ai lam pandung hpe n lu shangut la ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hkyen jawn marai mali gaw shanhte a shingjawng ai lam hpe nlu shangut shakre lu ma ai rai nna hkyen jawn masha yawng 117 kaw na 45 gaw Giant Slalom kaw shingjawng poi madang tsang masat ai lam kaw hkrat sum lai wa sai re.""
* **Translation:** ""Among the athletes who completed the Giant Slalom course, the 45th athlete did not follow the course and was disqualified.""
* **Therefore, option B accurately reflects this information.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lahkawng lang na shingjawng poi hta, Carpenado gaw Hungary kaw na hkyen jawn ai wa hta na shawng pandung shawng du lu sai** - While Carpenado did not finish the slalom, this option is inaccurate because it says he ""du lu sai"" which means ""followed"" or ""followed the course."" The passage indicates he *didn't* follow the course.
* **C: Hkyen jawn shingjawng ai ni law malawng gaw Slalom hta grau na Giant Slalom hpe pandung de du lu sai** - This option is incorrect because it misstates the event. The passage talks about a disqualification from the Giant Slalom course, not a finish in Slalom followed by Giant Slalom.
* **D: Carpendo gaw Slalom hta nambat shi lu sai** - The passage doesn't specify Carpendo's position in the Slalom race. It only mentions his disqualification from the Giant Slalom.



"
Lawu kaw na gara wa hpe NBA jahkring kau na matu daw dan kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: COVID-19 ana kap ai ginsup ninghkrin ni yawng** (COVID-19 itself is what caused the stoppage).

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states the NBA season was paused due to COVID-19.** The question asks *why* the season was paused.
* **Option C directly addresses the cause:** The paragraph explicitly mentions COVID-19 as the reason for the pause.
* **The other options are less accurate:**
    * **A: Ta din ginsup numdaw (It was stopped/paused):** This is a statement of fact, not the *reason* for the pause.
    * **B: Utah Jazz kaw na ginsup ninghkrin (Utah Jazz was infected):** While Utah Jazz was affected, the problem wasn't *just* their infection; it was the spread of COVID-19.
    * **D: Utah Jazz ta din ginsup uhpung (Utah Jazz was the reason):** This is incorrect. The paragraph clearly states COVID-19 was the reason.



"
"Laika daw da tsun da ai zawn, lawu kaw na gara gaw virus hte seng nna NBA a myit tsang ai lam hpe byin shangun ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Utah Jazz lamang na matu ginsup ninghkrin langai ana kap ai ngu nna mahtai lu ngut ai hpang atsawm n lu ginsup ai lam.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Utah Jazz yung ngoi ning hkring na COVID-19 virus nga ai hpe NBA dawdan ai gaw hkan sa ai.""  This translates to ""Utah Jazz was the first to report a COVID-19 virus infection within the NBA.""
* **Option C accurately reflects this:** ""Utah Jazz lamang na matu ginsup ninghkrin langai ana kap ai ngu nna mahtai lu ngut ai hpang atsawm n lu ginsup ai lam"" translates to ""Utah Jazz was the first to report a player testing positive, and then subsequently closed.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: NBA uhpung malawm ni ana kap ai lam** (The NBA is a big team): While true, it doesn't directly answer the question about the first team to be affected.
* **B: Utah Jazz ginsup lamang hta ginsup ninghkrin tsawmra mi ana kap ai lam** (Utah Jazz only reported a positive case and then closed): This is partially correct but doesn't highlight the *first* reporting aspect.
* **D: Utah Jazz lamang na matu ginsup ninghkrin langai ana kap ai lam** (Utah Jazz only reported a positive case within their team): This is too vague and doesn't connect to the overall impact on the NBA.



Therefore, **C** is the most precise and accurate answer based on the provided text."
Atlanta Thrashers hte shingjawng ai lamang hta Washington muklum na matu kadai wa gaw ginsup ai lam hta dang wa na matu goal hpe lu la sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The text states: ""Nicklas Backstrom hpe Ovechkin na dai shana shawng nna madi sadaw ai gaw dai jinsup ai lama hta dang wa na matu goal re."" which translates to ""Nicklas Backstrom was the one who assisted Ovechkin in scoring the goal that broke the tie.""



"
Washington muklum hte Thrashers shingjawng poi lamang laman hta kadai wa gaw shi a numdaw 60 lang na goal hpe lu la mat sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The passage states: ""...dai gaw 1995-96 kaw na goal 60 (sh) jan hkra lu du ai shang nnan na ginsup ninghkring byin wa sai. Jaromir Jagr hte Mario Lemieux yan dai pandung lu du ai ten, dai gaw 1995-96 kaw na goal 60 (sh) jan hkra lu du ai shang nnan na ginsup ninghkring byin wa sai.""

This translates to: ""...he achieved this feat, alongside Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux, of being the youngest player to reach 60 goals in a season, a feat last accomplished in 1995-96.""  The passage directly attributes the achievement of reaching 60 goals at a young age to Alex Ovechkin.
"
Northern Rock gumhpraw dum gaw galoi aten hta asuya kaw karum ningtum ai hpe ra wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gumhpraw dum hpe mung shawa rai shatai la ngut ai hpang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""2010 ning hta, mung ting mung shawa rai shatai la ai ten hta, """"""Northern Rock"""""" laksan gumhpraw dum hpe """"""Nkaja ai gumhpraw dum"""""" jahpan kaw na garan kau ai.""  This translates to: ""In 2010, due to financial difficulties, the Northern Rock bank was acquired by a Japanese company.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Manu dan sutgan hparan kompani kaw na garan mat ai shaloi** - While Virgin *was* involved, the passage doesn't state that Virgin *directly* acquired Northern Rock. It facilitated the deal with the Japanese company.
*   **C: Virgin uhpung ni gumhpraw dum hpe mari ngut ai hpang** - Virgin helped facilitate the sale, but the passage doesn't imply they acquired the bank themselves.
*   **D: Hka hte hkoi shap sha ra ai chyat ladaw hta** - This refers to past difficulties but doesn't explain the immediate reason for the acquisition in 2010.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the Northern Rock bank was acquired because of **financial difficulties (mung shawa rai shatai la)**."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Virgin Uhpung a Northern Rock Gumhpraw Dum hte myit hkrum ai lam hpe tup hkrak tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Virgin Uhpung gaw shi a mung shawa rai shatai la ngut ai hpang Gumhpraw Dum hpe mari wa sai.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""2010 ning hta, mung ting mung shawa rai shatai la ai ten hta, """"""Northern Rock"""""" laksan gumhpraw dum hpe """"""Nkaja ai gumhpraw dum"""""" jahpan kaw na garan kau ai."" (In 2010, due to financial difficulties, the Northern Rock bank was acquired by a Japanese bank called ""Nkaja ai gumhpraw dum"".)
* **The text also states:** ""Virgin Hpung gaw Dingdung Lung rawk a """"""kaja ai gumhpraw dum"""""" hpe sha mari da ai, company a reng hkang lam gaw n madu ai."" (Virgin Group acquired the ""Nkaja ai gumhpraw dum"" and salvaged the company.)

Option B accurately reflects this sequence of events: Virgin Group acquired the ""Nkaja ai gumhpraw dum"" (which took over Northern Rock) after Northern Rock faced financial problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While Virgin Group did acquire a company that took over Northern Rock, the option doesn't explicitly mention the financial difficulties that led to the acquisition.
* **C:** The text doesn't mention Virgin Group taking control of Northern Rock due to financial difficulties or acting as a savior.
* **D:**  The text doesn't state Virgin Group was planning to take over national banks in general.  It was a specific acquisition related to Northern Rock's troubles.

"Laika daw hta tsun da ai hte maren, Kyoto lamu marang myit hkrum hta lata masat htu ai a majaw gara mung gaw akyu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: United States**.

The passage states: ""Kyoto lamu marang shiga myit hkrum lam hta Mr. Rudd na lata masat htu na matu daw dan ai lam gaw United States hpe garan tawn da nga ai rai nna..."" which translates to ""The government of Kyoto, when the Australian Prime Minister Mr. Rudd visited, gave a guarantee to the United States...""
"
Australia na shawng asuya gaw Kyoto na shagrin ai lam wa kadai hpe sum machyi na lam byin hkun na ngu shadu sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: United States**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kyoto lamu marang shiga myit hkrum lam hta Mr. Rudd na lata masat htu na matu daw dan ai lam gaw United States hpe garan tawn da nga ai rai nna...""  This translates to: ""...the issue of Kyoto and the government's actions regarding the government's involvement with the United States...""

The question asks what Australia's ""ashuya"" (which implies a factor or influence) regarding Kyoto's impact on the government might be.  The passage directly links the government's actions regarding Kyoto to the United States.  Therefore, the United States is the most likely influence or factor.
"
Yi sun kaw na shan gap ginsup ai ni hpe hpa lamang a matu lata la sai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shan Gap Ginsup Uhpung a shan hkwi ai lamang (The land where Shan Gap Ginseng grows)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""NPWS a rau bungli galaw ai hte Australia a Shan gap Ginsup Hpung (NSW) Inc gaw Shan gap Ginsup Hpung a shan gap lamang kata na atsam ningja hpring ai daw jau masha ni hpe lata san da ma ai."" This translates to: ""NPWS and the Australia Shan Gap Ginseng (NSW) Inc are working to preserve the land where Shan Gap Ginseng grows.""
* Option D directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Australia Shan Gap Ginsup Uhpung na matu (The land of Australia Shan Gap Ginseng):** While Australia is mentioned, the focus isn't just on Australia in general, but specifically on the *land where the ginseng grows*.
* **B: Nampan sun hkang zing ai hte sali wunli lamang (The land of the Nampan Sun and Sali Wunli):** The passage mentions these, but they aren't the primary focus regarding the Shan Gap Ginseng land.
* **C: NPWS lamang (Only NPWS):**  The passage explicitly mentions NPWS *and* NSW Inc working together.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""NPWS a rau bungli galaw ai hte Australia a Shan gap Ginsup Hpung (NSW) Inc gaw Shan gap Ginsup Hpung a shan gap lamang kata na atsam ningja hpring ai daw jau masha ni hpe lata san da ma ai."" (NPWS, the government agency, and the Australian Shan Gap Ginsup Hpung (NSW) Inc. are working together to protect the Shan Gap Ginseng's natural habitat.)
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Mick O'Flynn tsun ai hku nga yang, NPWS hte rau Grup yin Hkang zing lam hte Sali wunli Nampan sun a Sumla hkrung Matsun wa gaw, wunkat matsun hte hkum tsup ai shimlam hkam la ai hte shawng nnan lang nam shang gap hkawm ai lam a matu dusat gap masha mali lata wa ai."" (According to Mick O'Flynn, NPWS, the local community group, and the Sali community leaders, have been working to protect the mountain forest and the habitat of the Shang Gap Ginseng.)
* **The question asks:** ""Lawu kaw na tsun da ai hta, yi sun ni hpe chyahten chye ai akaw ni hpe sat ai tsi hte seng nna gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?"" (Based on the information, what is the main reason they are working to protect the Shan Gap Ginseng's habitat?)
* **Option C directly reflects the passage's emphasis on protecting the habitat:** The passage highlights collaborative efforts to *protect the Shan Gap Ginseng's natural habitat*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shan gap ai ni gaw matsun madun ai lam hpe hkam la ma sai:** (The Shan Gap Ginseng does not need a low-altitude forest.) This isn't supported by the text. The text talks about the ""mountain forest"" and the ""habitat"" which implies specific environmental needs.
* **D: Shan gap ginsup ai marai mali hpe lata la sai:** (They are protecting the medicinal properties of the Shan Gap Ginseng.)  While the ginseng *might* have medicinal properties (not stated in the passage), the primary focus of the work mentioned is habitat protection, not medicinal benefits.



Therefore, **Option C is the best and most accurate answer.**



"
"Laika kaw tsun da hte maren, ga garan ai hpe gara kaw mu wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Ethiopia kaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai lachyum gaw yawng hkra hte hpe bai tawn da ra na,"" ngu Ethiopia na Rift Valley Sawk lak Karum hpung kaw na sawk sagawn ai wa hte Berhane Asfaw...""

This translates to: ""God's purpose is to be revealed to us, as Berhane Asfaw, who worked in the Rift Valley region of Ethiopia, said...""

Therefore, the passage directly links Berhane Asfaw's statement and the context to the **Ethiopia** region.

"Laika daw hta tsun da hte maren, myit mada da ai lam hta jau na byin wa ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Molecular sakse na jep sagawn ai lam**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ndai namhkan lung hta mahta nna, dai ga garan mat ai gaw molecular ni a sakse ni nlawm ai tim jau tak da ai hta grau loi ai hpe ngu mayu ai re."" This translates to: ""The heart is a strong organ, the divine is the essence that dwells within the molecular and cannot be destroyed.""

* The question asks: ""Laika daw hta tsun da hte maren, myit mada da ai lam hta jau na byin wa ai gaw hpa rai?"" This translates to: ""When the life is gone and the body is dead, where does the essence/divine go?""

* The text directly links the ""divine"" (dai) to the ""molecular"" (molecular ni).  Therefore, the essence/divine is associated with the molecular structure and doesn't simply disappear.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Namhkan lung a masam maram sawk tam lu ai lam (The path of the very strong heart):** While the heart is important, the text doesn't suggest the divine resides *specifically* in a strong heart.
* **B: Ga garan mat ai lam (The path of the divine essence):** This is too broad. The text specifies the essence dwells within the molecular.
* **D: Rift Valley hta na sawk sagaw magam (The holy land from the Rift Valley):** This refers to Berhane Asfaw's origin and isn't related to where the divine essence goes after death.

"Sumla hkrung ginsup ai laman hta shamu shamawt ai lam hpe jum lang na matu, ginsup ai wa gaw hpa baw galaw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Nbung ntsa kaw up hkang ai hpe shamawt na**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):** Asks *how* the remote control (which is connected wirelessly) controls the game console.
* **The Context:** The passage states the Nintendo Revolution uses a wireless controller and a TV remote as a guide. It mentions the controller uses radio waves to communicate with the console.
* **Option D:** ""Nbung ntsa kaw up hkang ai hpe shamawt na"" translates to ""It transmits with radio waves.""  This directly addresses how a wireless remote communicates with a console.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** ""Up hkang ai a maju hkam hkinghku ni hpe hkalap pa hta Upshara jahkrat da na"" - This means ""It turns on the advanced guide, then uses a program to activate it.""  This doesn't explain how the remote *controls* the console.
* **B:** ""Ginsup ai ni shara hpe man masum hkrang bawng shara la ra na"" - This translates to ""The time the game console is turned on is not a solid color."" This describes the console's power light and is irrelevant to remote control operation.
* **C:** ""Shan hte a sumla hkrung pa makau hta maju hkam hkinghku hpe shara la da na"" - This means ""It sends the advanced guide with the color of the TV."" This is not the mechanism for controlling the console.



"
TV sumtsan hkang hkinghku hte bung hkra hpa hpe shalat sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Nintendo Revolution up hkang ai**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nintendo a ningbaw Satoru Iwata gaw company a nnan Nintendo Revolution a shayawm ai lam a matu aup hkang ai hpe hpaw wa ya ai."" (Nintendo, under Satoru Iwata, was working on the Nintendo Revolution, and announced it as a major focus.)
* **The question asks:** ""TV sumtsan hkang hkinghku hte bung hkra hpa hpe shalat sai rai?"" (How can the TV remote and other peripherals be connected?)
* **The passage details:** The Nintendo Revolution had a remote control and the ability to connect to a TV through a video cable.
* **Option B directly refers to the Nintendo Revolution**, which is the context of the passage and the key to understanding the connection setup.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Up hkang ai a maju hkam hkinghku lahkawng** (Using a major forward-looking remote control) - While technically true, it's too general and doesn't specifically point to the Nintendo Revolution.
* **C: Keynote tang madun ladat** (Connected from the keynote speech) - The keynote speech announced the Revolution, but doesn't explain *how* to connect devices.
* **D: Nintendo Revolution hkalap pa** (Connected to the Nintendo Revolution's dock) - The passage doesn't mention a dock, and connecting to a dock isn't the primary way to connect a remote and TV.

Xinhua Shiga dat kasa dap na hpang jahtum laika hta hpa hpe n tsun shapraw da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: pyenli hpe bawm jahkrit shama ai lam** (the road that connects with the Pamir Highway).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Miwa shiga dap re nga ai Xinhua gaw pyenli langai hpe zing na hpung nga ai lam shiga jau shana da ai.""  This translates to: ""Xinhua (the road) connects with the Pamir Highway and continues to the border.""
* Then it says: ""Hpang daw na shiga hta lawm ai gaw, nbungli hpe bawm hte jahkrit la nna Afghanistan de nhtang gayin shangun nna Kandahar kaw wa jahkring shangun da hkrum ai."" This means: ""The road from the north, having been built and upgraded, continues into Afghanistan, leading to Kandahar and being controlled by the government.""
* Finally: ""Urumqi kaw hkyak sha nbungli yu na matu galaw ai hta ahkang njaw ai majaw Afghanistan de bai yawng mat ai.""  This means: ""The road from Urumqi, having entered into Afghanistan, continues to the east, connecting with the Panjshir River.""

The question asks *what* the Xinhua road connects with. The passage explicitly states it connects with the Pamir Highway.  Option A directly reflects this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Urumqi kaw pyenli yu wa sai lam** (the road from Urumqi) - While the road *starts* from Urumqi, it's not what it primarily connects *with*.
* **C: Pyenli gaw Afghanistan de nhtang kau ai lam** (the road is the road that leads to Afghanistan) - This is too general.  The road connects with something *within* Afghanistan.
* **D: Kandahar kaw pyenli yu wa sai lam** (the road from Kandahar) - The road *leads to* Kandahar, but it's not what it directly connects *with*.

Therefore, the Pamir Highway is the key connection.
"
Xinhua shiga dat kasa na jau dik ai laika hta hpa hpe n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Pyenli hpe Afghanistan de lam nhtang shangun ai**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Miwa shiga dap re nga ai Xinhua gaw pyenli langai hpe zing na hpung nga ai lam shiga jau shana da ai. Hpang daw na shiga hta lawm ai gaw, nbungli hpe bawm hte jahkrit la nna Afghanistan de nhtang gayin shangun nna Kandahar kaw wa jahkring shangun da hkrum ai.""

This translates to: ""Xinhua news agency, which is a relatively new agency, has established a bureau in Afghanistan.  The bureau is located in Kandahar and is conducting investigations in the country, focusing on the situation.""

Therefore, the Xinhua news agency has established a bureau **in Afghanistan** and is conducting investigations *there*. Option C accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pyenli hpe zing na hpung ai** (Relatively new) - While true, this doesn't answer *where* Xinhua has established a bureau.
*   **B: Pyenli gaw kyak sha nbungli yu na matu nyet kau hkrum ai** (Relatively new, focusing on military matters) - The paragraph doesn't specify that Xinhua is *only* focused on military matters.
*   **D: pyenli hpe bawm jahkrit shama ai lam** (Relatively new, focusing on news gathering) - While gathering news is part of a bureau's function, the text focuses on the bureau's location and investigations *in Afghanistan*, not just the news gathering process.

The text also says she was interviewed by Sveriges Radio about the 2016 Nobel Prize for Literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kompti gaw rau jawm galaw ai ni kaw na shiga hpa bai n lu wa ai lam:** This refers to her work habits, but not the reason she was interviewed.
* **C: 2016 na laili laika hta Nobel shagrau kumhpa na matu tang madun da hkrum ai ni:** While true, it's not the *reason* she was interviewed.
* **D: Bob Dylan hte matut mahkai na matu kompti hku nna atsam sim mat na:** This refers to the subject of the Nobel Prize, not why Danius was interviewed.



"

This translates to ""Bob Dylan, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, has been in the spotlight for his..."".  The passage focuses on Bob Dylan's Nobel Prize win and the subsequent discussion.

* **The question asks:** ""Who is described as 'the path of the non-aggression'?""
* **The text states:** ""...Gordon Johndroe gaw dingdung Korea a ga sadi hpe """"""Korea hte seng ai zundawn a tengman nna shingra dat n-gun lang ai hpe shayawm ai lam a pan dung hpe lu la na matu ahkyak ai numdaw re ai lam"""""""" re ai ngu tsun lai wa sai re.""  This translates to ""...Gordon Johndroe said that the path of non-aggression towards North Korea has been pushed forward and is being taken.""
* **Therefore, the ""path of non-aggression"" refers to North Korea's actions.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shiga dap (Correct Answer):** This means ""Correct Answer"" and is not a specific person or entity.
* **B: George W. Bush:**  While the text mentions George W. Bush, it's Johndroe who is directly quoted as discussing the ""path of non-aggression.""
* **C: Gordon Johndroe:** While Johndroe *said* something about the path of non-aggression, he isn't *the* path of non-aggression himself. He's the one describing it.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dam shani ka'ang kaw, tank vent kaw na matut lwi taw ai gaw tank kata kaw na kahtet dat law mat ai majaw re sam ai."" This translates to: ""Because of the strong winds, the tank vent was over-pressurized, causing the tank to rupture and spill approximately 55,000 (2.3 million gallons) of oil.""

The question asks what caused the tank vent to break. The text directly attributes the rupture to the vent being over-pressurized *because of the strong winds*. Therefore, the wind caused the pressure to build up and the vent to fail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Wan n-gun hkrang masa (A vast area)**: This is irrelevant to the cause of the vent failure.
* **C: Kahtet dat hte seng ai law mat ai (Not ruptured and not spilled)**: This is the opposite of what happened.
* **D: Fort Greely na hka chyup dap langai hta wan hkru ai lam (A pipe coming from the Fort Greely base)**: The text doesn't mention a pipe from Fort Greely.

The passage states: ""Dam shani ka'ang kaw, tank vent kaw na matut lwi taw ai gaw **tank kata kaw na kahtet dat law mat ai majaw re sam ai**."" This translates to: ""In the past, when the tank vents were left open, **the tank's sides were sealed with clay**.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ladat jep ngut ai hpang wan ngun hkrak mat ai:** While the pipeline was built and lined, the passage focuses on the sealing of the tank sides, not the pipeline itself.
*   **C: tank ni gaw shang shadang hpring kaw rai taw ai:** The passage mentions the oil being pumped, but it doesn't say that the tanks were sealed *because* the oil was being pumped. It's about preventing leaks.
*   **D: Lahkawng lang na sharawng bang ai kaw wahtawng n lu tek tawn ai:** This refers to the oil leaking from the oil sands, which is a separate issue from the sealing of the tanks.

"Ndai laman, jahku ngu na mare lawk hta hka kade tsaw taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 20 pe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Katrina laru laman pe 20 daram tsaw hkra hka kaba ai hpe mu da ai jahku ngu na mare lawk gaw ya ten ga ai hka hkinbawng lup mat ai majaw hka gaw ginshang du hkra tsaw taw nga ai."" This translates to: ""Katrina's damage caused 20 days of power outage, and the power was restored after the main power lines were repaired.""

The question asks: ""Ndai laman, jahku ngu na mare lawk hta hka kade tsaw taw ai rai?"" which means ""Therefore, how many days did it take to restore power?""

The passage explicitly states it took 20 days for power to be restored. Therefore, the answer is 20.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: yungnu bat 6:** This refers to a different detail in the passage (the number of people affected).
* **C: Ginshang-ram:** This refers to a specific location, not the duration of the power outage.
* **D: 100 pe:** This refers to the length of the main power lines.



"
"Hurricane Katrina laman, jahku ngu na mare lawk hta hpa byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Ginshang-ram re hka gaw hka hkinbawng hpe taw lai mat ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Katrina laru laman pe 20 daram tsaw hkra hka kaba ai hpe mu da ai jahku ngu na mare lawk gaw ya ten ga ai hka hkinbawng lup mat ai majaw hka gaw ginshang du hkra tsaw taw nga ai.""  This translates to: ""After the hurricane Katrina, the levee broke in the area of 20 days, and the levee burst and flooded the city, causing a lot of damage.""

Option B directly reflects this statement about the levee breaking and flooding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hka kaba ai gaw 100 pe dam ai** (The damaged area was 100 square kilometers): The passage mentions a 100-dam area of land *surrounded* by the levee, not the area of the damage itself.
*   **C: Hka kaba ai gaw 20 pe tsaw ai** (The damaged area was 20 days):  The damage occurred *after* 20 days, not the damage area itself.
*   **D: Marang htu shadang yungnu bat 6 gaw hka hkinbawng jahten hpe tawt lai mat ai** (6 other levees burst): The passage only mentions one levee breaking.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Hamilton a shagrin da ai lam n rai ai kun?","The correct answer is **B: Kaga machyi masha na ana zingli hte hkra ai lam byin na masa**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Machyi masha gaw Ebola ana zinli amu byin lai wa ai shara rai nga ai Nigeria mungdan de du hkawm lai wa sai.""  This means the outbreak of Ebola in Nigeria caused a lot of fear.
* **The question asks:** ""Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Hamilton a shagrin da ai lam n rai ai kun?"" (So, because of what did Hamilton get scared?)
* **Option B directly addresses this:**  It links Hamilton's fear to the fear *caused by* the Ebola outbreak and the spread of the disease.  It implies he was scared of the widespread fear and potential danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Machyi masha wa bu hkawm ai shara ni:** This is too literal. While the outbreak caused fear, it doesn't explain *why* Hamilton got scared.
* **C: Hkrang madung hpe hkan nang hkan sa ai lam nga n nga:** This refers to the spread of rumors, which is not directly stated as the source of Hamilton's fear.
* **D: Machyi masha a ndai laman mabyin masa:**  This is too vague and doesn't link Hamilton's fear to a specific cause.



"
Hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni sawk sagawn mayu ai lam gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Mungkan ga gara hku byin wa ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the path of the ""hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni sawk sagawn mayu"" (the path of the sacred river of the mountain peak).

The provided text states: ""**Wan shagan ni mungkan ga hte moi shawng kaw na adawt hkat ai kaw na mungkan gintawng ni gara hku byin wa ai**"" which translates to: ""The sacred river flows from the mountain peak, and the golden river flows towards the end of the world.""

Therefore, the path of the sacred river of the mountain peak is described as the river **flowing towards the end of the world**. Option D, ""Mungkan ga gara hku byin wa ai"" (The river flows towards the end of the world), directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wan shagan ni mungkan ga hte galoi adawt hkra na** - This means ""from the sacred river, it flows towards..."" which isn't the complete answer to where the river goes.
* **B: Shan dat gara hku byin wa ai** - This translates to ""It flows towards the Shan region,"" which isn't mentioned in the provided text.
* **C: Shingra masa gaw hpa re ai lam** - This translates to ""The path of the sacred river is the path of the sacred peak,"" which is a different concept than where the river ultimately goes.

"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, ni htep ai kaw buga pyada dap hku nna gara hku galaw lai wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shanhte gaw ni htep na matu FBI hpe shadut sai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where someone is being pursued and possibly threatened by the FBI.**  It mentions the FBI's involvement (""FBI a madi shadaw n-gun hte ni htep sa wa lu hkra galaw lai wa sai"").
* **The question asks what the person should do to escape being pursued.**
* **Option A directly addresses the threat by suggesting contacting the FBI.**  If the FBI is pursuing someone, that person should seek help from the very agency that is causing the problem.  This is a logical response in the context of the scenario.

Let's look at why the other options are less appropriate:

* **B: Ni htep ai hpe shanhte galaw na matu myit daw dan sai (The person should hide and avoid the pursuer).** While hiding might be a temporary tactic, it doesn't solve the problem.  The FBI is actively pursuing them.
* **C: Shanhte gaw mawdaw jawn ai ni hpe kaga lam de woi matsun dat sai (The person should go to a place where there are many people and disappear).**  This could be helpful *eventually*, but it doesn't address the immediate threat. It's a risky maneuver and not the first step.
* **D: Shanthe gaw malai lam dingyang de mawdaw htinglet shana ai lam hpe shiga jaw lai wa sai (The person should go to a place where they can blend in with the crowd).** This is similar to option C and doesn't directly address the FBI's pursuit.



Therefore, seeking help from the FBI (Option A) is the most reasonable course of action according to the given passage.



"
Ni htep ai ten hta shangna tingrat hpa byin wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: mawdaw htinglet shana ai lam byin wa sai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Beltway maga de gaw mawdaw htinglet na matu aten na ai lam n nga ai hpe chye lu ai."" This translates to ""The Beltway's traffic jams are the reason why the FBI is investigating.""

Therefore, the reason for the FBI investigation is related to the traffic jams on the Beltway. Option D, ""mawdaw htinglet shana ai lam byin wa sai"" (traffic jams are the reason), directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pat da hkrum sai** (the government is being investigated): While the FBI is involved, the passage doesn't explicitly state that the government itself is under investigation.
*   **B: Kaga lam hku sa lu na matu garum ya na matu jai lang wa sai** (the reasons for the accidents are being investigated): The passage doesn't mention accidents; it focuses on traffic congestion.
*   **C: mawdaw jawn ai ni na matu hpaw da ya sai** (the behavior of drivers is being investigated):  The passage doesn't highlight driver behavior as the focus of the investigation.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, sumla gayet sara hpe mawdaw hte n'adawt shi yang hpa byin wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Sumla gayet ai wa gaw shi a mawdaw hpe Sepulveda Boulevard ding yang hta jahkring da sai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""TMZ yu ngwi shiga dap kaw na ni gaw sumla gayet masha wa gaw Sepulveda Boulevard a aw ra hkran maga de balik ni hpe sumla gayet na matu mawdaw hpe chyahkring da ai...""  This translates to: ""TMZ insiders say the funeral procession was on Sepulveda Boulevard and the casket was transported in a vehicle.""

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: Sumla gayet ai wa hpe Lam kaba kaw na balik ni bai wa kau hkun ai:** While the funeral procession *was* on the way back to the cemetery, this option doesn't specify *where* it was transported.
* **C: Sumla gayet ai wa gaw pyada jahkring ai hpe sumla gayet da ai:** The text doesn't mention a pedestrian funeral procession.
* **D: sumla gayet ai wa gaw Bieber na sumla hpe lu la sai:** This option is completely unrelated to the text.  Bieber is mentioned only as someone who gave a eulogy.



"
sumla gayet ai wa mawdaw hte n'adawt shi yang shi hpa galaw na maw taw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sepulveda Boulevard hta mawdaw jahkring na**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""TMZ yu ngwi shiga dap kaw na ni gaw sumla gayet masha wa gaw Sepulveda Boulevard a aw ra hkran maga de balik ni hpe sumla gayet na matu mawdaw hpe chyahkring da ai hpe chye ma ai...""

This translates to: ""The TMZ paparazzi saw Sumla Gayet and, on their way back from being at Sepulveda Boulevard, threw something at Sumla Gayet.""

Therefore, the answer is that she was thrown something at *Sepulveda Boulevard*.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw gumsan magam a ana kanu kap ai hpang mabyin masa hpe tup hkrak n lu htai dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shi gaw n nga pyaw ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Rodrigo Arias is ""ana kanu nau nsawng ai baw positive byin mat ai"" which translates to ""always has a very positive attitude.""  Then it says he ""ngai nga pyaw ai re hta n-ga nta kaw na tsun shaga ai bungli hpe galaw na ma ai"" meaning ""always uses his own thoughts to solve problems.""  This indicates he tackles problems with his own ingenuity and positive thinking.

Let's look at the other options:

* **B: Shi kaw yuhkraw machyi ningma nga ai** (He is a very clever person) - While he might be clever, the passage emphasizes his positive *attitude* and problem-solving approach more than pure cleverness.
* **C: Shi gaw ting shaling re sai** (He is a stingy person) - There's absolutely nothing in the passage suggesting he's stingy.
* **D: Shi gaw hkum kahtet taw ai** (He is an authoritarian person) - The passage describes him as someone who *uses his own thoughts* to solve problems, which is the opposite of authoritarianism.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Machyi ai hte du machyi ai hta lai nna, ngai nga pyaw ai re hta n-ga nta kaw na tsun shaga ai bungli hpe galaw na ma ai.""  This translates to: ""Whether it's good or bad, he's moving forward with the things he's been told.""

Rodrigo Arias is described as moving forward based on what he's been told. Option C directly reflects this: ""He is moving forward with the things he has been told and believes are true.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shi gaw hkum n kahtet ai** (He is being controlled by someone): While Arias might be influenced, the passage focuses on him acting *based on information he received*, not direct control.
*   **B: Bat law law shi na nta kaw hkring sa la na** (He is completely believing what others say): The passage implies he is moving forward *with* the information, not necessarily completely believing everything without question.
*   **D: Shi hta ana kanu grai sawng ai machyi nga ai** (He is acting based on the good intentions of others): While it might be a factor, the passage doesn't explicitly state that Arias is acting *solely* on the good intentions of others. It's more about the information he received.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Cyclone nbung laru gaw galoi n-gun shakya wa na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Nbung bung ai hkying hkum mi hta 149 deng galai n du shi yang**

Here's why:

The question asks what the cyclone's wind speed was. The text states: ""Dai hpawt maga hta, nbung ni gaw 83km/h daram rai nga nna dai nbung ni bai ngya wa na ngu myit mada lai wa sai. **Nbung bung ai hkying hkum mi hta 149 deng galai n du shi yang.**"" which translates to ""From the starting point, the wind speed was 83km/h. **The cyclone's maximum wind speed was 149 kilometers (93 miles per hour).**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Maldives de galai n du shi yang** (The cyclone was in the Maldives): The text states the cyclone *affected* the Maldives, not that it was *in* the Maldives.
* **B: Nbung gaw hkying hkum mi kaw 83 kilometer de hkrat mat ai shaloi** (The cyclone's wind speed was 83 kilometers): This is only the wind speed *after* some time had passed. The question asks for the *maximum* wind speed.
* **C: Shi na lahta kaw galai n du shi yang** (The cyclone's wind speed was the same as the wind speed at the beginning): This is incorrect, as the maximum wind speed is different from the initial wind speed.



"
Cyclone nbung laru tsaw dik lahta kaw nbung kade ja ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hkying hkum mi hta 240 deng**.

The text states: ""aten langai kaw 240 kilometers (149 miles per hour) daram nbung bung ai re.""  This translates to ""The cyclone reached a speed of 240 kilometers (149 miles per hour).""
"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Karenia brevis na nsam ngu n sawn lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: dai gaw cell langai hta grau nga ai (it grazes on microscopic cells)**.

This translates to: ""Ahkyeng nsam is a type of algae that grazes on microscopic cells. It feeds on microscopic organisms.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hka kara amyu langai mi re (it is a type of plankton):** The passage describes Karenia brevis as an algae that grazes on microscopic cells, but doesn't explicitly label it as plankton. While algae *can* be plankton, the passage focuses on its feeding habits.
* **B: shinggyim masha a lasaw lasa hpe jahten kau ya lu ai (it absorbs microscopic cells into its body):** The passage states it *grazes* on cells, not absorbs them. ""Graze"" implies eating small amounts of organic matter.
* **D: shingra maka hku byin ai (it blooms in freshwater):** The passage doesn't mention where Karenia brevis blooms. It describes its feeding habits and the effects of its toxins.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information provided in the passage about Karenia brevis's feeding habits."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Karena brevis n lu galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Maju lasa hpe jahten ya ai gung hpe shapraw ya lu ai** (It is observing the movement of the larvae towards the light).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hka kara ni gaw shinggyim masha hte nga ni a maju lasa nkung hkra lu galaw ai maju lasa hpe jahten chye ai gung ni shapraw lu ai.""  This translates to: ""The larvae move towards the light, and it is observing the movement of the larvae towards the light.""

Option D directly reflects this statement.  The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Nga ni a lasaw lasa hpe jahten kau ya lu ai** (It is attaching to the surface with its tentacles) - The text mentions attaching, but the focus is on movement *towards the light*.
*   **B: Kaning re mabyin masa hta raitim lawan shapraw lu ai** (It is observing the movement of organisms from the surrounding environment) - The text focuses specifically on *larvae* and their movement towards light, not a general observation of organisms.
*   **C: hka hpe akyu lu jaw ai** (It is wrapping around the light) - The text says the larvae move *towards* the light, not wrap around it.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Hurricane Felicia a majaw byin ai mabyin n rai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: akyu hkam sha ai marang htu ai lam**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Oahu a tsa tsaw shadang shadawn rai hta letma 6.34 lung wa ai lam kajawng kaja re ai hpe """"""akyu hkamsha lam"""""" ngu htawng madun da ma ai."" This translates to: ""The storm surge reached a maximum height of 6.34 meters on Oahu, causing """"""storm surge"""""".""

Therefore, ""akyu hkam sha ai marang htu ai lam"" (storm surge) is the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mu laru lawm ai marang htu ai lam** (Massive storm surge): While the storm surge was large, the passage specifically identifies it as a ""akyu hkamsha lam"" (storm surge).
*   **C: bai byin ai myihprap** (the entire population): The passage mentions the impact on people, but doesn't identify them as the ""byin ai myihprap"" (entire population)
*   **D: lam ni hka lim ai** (the path of the storm): The passage describes the *result* of the storm, not its path.



"
Gara gaw Hurricane Felicia hte seng nna shut ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: laru a majaw byin ai marang gaw Oahu hpe akyu jaw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Oahu a tsa tsaw shadang shadawn rai hta letma 6.34 lung wa ai lam kajawng kaja re ai hpe """"""akyu hkamsha lam"""""" ngu htawng madun da ma ai."" This translates to: ""The devastating storm surge reached a maximum height of 6.34 meters on Oahu, causing catastrophic damage.""

* **Option A accurately reflects this:** It points out that the storm surge was so strong it caused significant damage to Oahu.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While the passage mentions Felicia was a Category 4 hurricane, it doesn't directly state that the storm surge was the *reason* it caused damage.
* **C:** The passage mentions strong winds, but it doesn't say the winds *caused* the damage; the storm surge did.
* **D:** The passage mentions the storm surge damaging infrastructure, but it doesn't say the *cause* of that damage was the infrastructure being built with weak materials.

Here's why:

* The prompt states that Piquet Jr. was instructed to crash during the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix, and then deliberately crashed again at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
* The question asks *why* Piquet Jr. was deliberately instructed to crash at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
* The context of the story indicates he was instructed to crash as a deliberate act by Renault management to benefit Fernando Alonso.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Fernando Alonso gaw kadaw kadan shoihpa lam kaw lawm wa sai** (Fernando Alonso was skillful and fast) - This is true generally but doesn't explain why Piquet Jr. was instructed to crash.
* **B: Piquet Jr. gaw awng padang dip lu sai** (Piquet Jr. was reckless) -  While Piquet Jr. *was* reckless, the context clearly indicates he was *instructed* to be reckless, not that he was inherently reckless.
* **D: kadaw kadan shoihpa lam hta shimlam mawdaw lawm sai** (He was skilled at driving) -  Similar to A, this is true but doesn't explain the crash instruction.



Therefore, only option C directly answers the question based on the information provided in the prompt.



"
Mawdaw adawt ai lam galoi byin wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Alonso mawdaw jahkring hkring ngut ai hpang kalang ta byin ai (Alonso was angered by the deliberate crash)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Piquet Jr. deliberately crashed in the 2008 Singapore Grand Prix *at the behest of the team* to benefit Fernando Alonso.
* The passage also says that Alonso was angered by this deliberate crash.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kaga mawdaw ni gaw sau jahpring taw shaloi (His father was an old driver)** - This is irrelevant to the reason Alonso was angered.
* **C: shimlam mawdaw n pru wa shi shaloi (He was angry with the team)** - While Piquet Jr. likely had issues with the team, the passage specifically focuses on Alonso's anger at the deliberate crash.
* **D: Piquet sau bang na matu sa mat ai hpang (He crashed because of Piquet's own mistake)** - The passage explicitly states the crash was *deliberate*.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw sawk sagawn ai ni madung de kam wa ai hta aten kaji kajaw sha la ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: amyu baw hpan ni a lam hpe sumtang shiga jaw ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes Darwin's observations on the Galapagos Islands.** He noticed that different species of finches (Geospiza fortes and Geospiza conirostris) had different beak shapes, adapted to different food sources (cactus seeds and insects, respectively).
* **The question asks about how species can diverge and adapt.** The text implies that the varying beak shapes arose over time in response to the different available food sources on each island.
* **Option B, ""amyu baw hpan ni a lam hpe sumtang shiga jaw ai lam"" translates to ""the path of gradual divergence along different environments.""** This accurately reflects the process Darwin described - species adapting to their specific environments over long periods, leading to divergence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: amyu baw hpan ni a byin pru ai lam (the path of sudden change):** Darwin's theory was about *gradual* change, not sudden transformation.
* **C: amyu n bung ai lapran ni lawt ai lam (the path of separate ancestral lineage):** While lineages diverge, the question focuses on the *adaptation* within those lineages to their environments.
* **D: amyu baw hpan ni gaw tsang hte tsang galai shai ai lam (the path of migration and dispersal):** Migration is a factor in species distribution, but the core of Darwin's theory is about adaptation *after* arrival and divergence.



"
Sawk sagawn ninghkrin ni hku nna lawu kaw gara hpe sumtang shiga n jaw wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Tsang hte tsang galai shai ai a shadang (The difference in the habitat they inhabit)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how Darwin observed that different species of *Geospiza* finches on the Galapagos Islands had different beak shapes adapted to the food available in their specific habitats.**  This is the core of Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection.  The finches evolved different beaks *because* of the varying food sources on each island.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Amyu baw hpan nnan gara kaw byin wa ai lam (The way organisms are generally divided into groups)** While classification exists, the passage focuses on how environmental differences drive evolutionary change, not general classification methods.
* **C: Amyu baw hpan nnan a mying (The general characteristics of organisms)**  The passage isn't about general characteristics; it's about specific adaptations to *specific* environments.
* **D: Chyu jaw ai lam kaw lawm ai u ni (The importance of beak shape)** While beak shape is *a* factor, the passage emphasizes that it's the link between beak shape and *habitat* (food source) that's crucial for understanding Darwin's observations.



Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the central point of the passage. The difference in habitat (and consequently food availability) led to the development of different beak shapes in the finches.



"
CowParade gara kaw galaw na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Europa dan sinpraw dingda shara shagu** (Europe dan na muklum mare ni law malawng kaw).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ndai ning shata man kru kaw na matsat lapran galaw na mungkan na kaba dik CowParade lamang hpe galaw ai singpraw dingdung **Europe kaw na shawng nnan myu re**.""  This translates to ""And during the years, a creative art parade of large and beautiful cows traveled throughout **Europe**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Romanian mare law law hta** (Romanian big cities): While the campaign started in Bucharest, the text emphasizes that the cows traveled *throughout Europe*.
* **B: Bucharest muklum hta** (In Bucharest):  This is only the starting point, not where the CowParade ultimately traveled.
* **D: Europa dan na muklum mare ni law malawng kaw** (Throughout Europe in large and beautiful cities): While partially correct, option C is more encompassing and directly reflects the statement in the text about traveling *throughout Europe*.



"
CowParade hpe lawu kaw gaw gara kaw tup hkrak hpaw tsun dan lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: mungkan hta kaba dik ai shawa shingni poi re**

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""CowParade hpe lawu kaw gaw gara kaw tup hkrak hpaw tsun dan lu ai rai?""  (What is the reason for the CowParade to be shown in such a way?)

* **The answer (A) states:** """"""kaja ai mare"""" ngu myit yu sawn la lu ai mare ni kaw sha galaw ai "" (It's a way to show the beauty of cows.)

* **Option D directly reflects this answer:** ""mungkan hta kaba dik ai shawa shingni poi re"" translates to ""a way to show the beauty of animals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dai hpe Bucharest Muklum Gawknu kaw shalat wa sai** (It is in the Bucharest Museum, is it?) - This is irrelevant to the reason *why* CowParade is displayed.
* **C: Europa dan sinpraw dingda shara shagu ginhtawng hta galaw ai shingni poi re** (It is a way to move around Europe and display the beauty of the animals.) - While CowParade *does* move around Europe, this option doesn't address *why* it's shown in a particular way.  It focuses on the movement, not the artistic purpose.



Therefore, **D** is the best and most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Gara gaw Russia hpe II-76 ni jai lang ai kaw na jahkring na matu bying hkun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Soviet hpyen dap**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""II-76 gaw shaning 1970 hkan na Russian hte **Soviet hpyen dap** lahkawng yan a madung dawshan langai re nna lai wa sai..."" which translates to ""The II-76 was developed in the 1970s by the **Soviet Union**...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kata kaw na hpung ni** (previous historical context) - While the context is historical, it doesn't pinpoint the reason *why* the II-76 was developed.
*   **B: kadaw kadan shoihpa lam langai** (developing advanced technology) - The passage doesn't mention advanced technology as the reason.
*   **D: Jahkring taw ai san jep ai lam** (the route used for transportation) - This is irrelevant to the origin or reason for the II-76's development.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is that the II-76 was developed by the Soviet Union."
II-76 gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nbungli langai** (Cargo plane).

The text states: ""II-76 gaw shaning 1970 hkan na Russian hte Soviet hpyen dap lahkawng yan a madung dawshan langai re nna lai wa sai shata mi hta Russia kaw manu mana hkala nba kalang mi byin hkrum ga sai re."" which translates to: ""II-76 was developed in the late 1970s by Russian and Soviet engineers and is used to transport people and cargo between Russia and other countries.""

Therefore, II-76 is a cargo plane (nbungli langai).

The text states: ""1989 hta shi gaw Brooks hte Simpsons hte Groening hpe galaw shapraw ai lam garum lai wa sai rai nna madun poi a alat ningshawng laika ka uhpung hpe tam shap na matu mung lit nga lai wa sai re."" This translates to: ""In 1989, he (Simpsons) collaborated with Brooks and Simpsons and Groening to create the short films that were shown before the feature films, and these short films were distributed on home video.""

Therefore, **Groening** is mentioned as a collaborator in creating the short films. While Brooks and Ullman were involved initially, the passage emphasizes Groening's role in the short film creation for home video distribution.

* **The passage describes Fluke's behavior:** Fluke is described as being easily angered, quick to complain, and prone to blaming others.  He's also portrayed as being overly sensitive and easily offended.
* **The question asks about the cause of Fluke's outbursts:**  The question asks *why* Fluke gets angry, complains, and blames others.
* **Option D (num hte la hkum ding dek ni) - ""Because he is easily angered and prone to complaining""**  This option directly reflects the description in the passage and accurately identifies the *reasons* for Fluke's behavior. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tsi du ni - ""Because it's a bad day""** The passage doesn't mention anything about the weather or the day being bad. The behavior seems inherent to Fluke's personality.
* **B: num hkam kaja lam jasu alun ai ni - ""Because he feels wronged/attacked""** While Fluke does blame others, the passage emphasizes his quick anger and tendency to complain as primary traits, not just feeling wronged.
* **C: la ni - ""Because it's a normal day""**  This is a general statement and doesn't address *why* Fluke's behavior occurs.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and supported answer based on the provided text.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nkau masha ni gaw num ni hkun na tsun shapraw ai lam hpe nsharawng ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Fluke**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is the ""Fluke"" (meaning the thing that causes the described situation). The first paragraph describes a situation where a ""num ni"" (which translates to ""problem"" or ""trouble"") arises, and various things are affected. The paragraph then states that the ""Fluke"" is the cause of this issue.

The subsequent question asks what ""Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren"" (things that are affected) are being identified by the ""nkau masha ni"" (good people) as the source of the ""num ni"" (problem/trouble). The answer then clarifies that the ""Fluke"" is the underlying cause.

Therefore, **Fluke** is the direct answer to the question of what is the source of the problem.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara gintawng hkum gaw n-gun atsam nga ai masa nga dik rai?","The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

The text states: ""Anhte chye ai daram gaw, Titan hta grau n-gun atsam nga ai masa hku madun lu ai shara gaw langai sha nga ai, dai gaw Mungkan ga re"""""" which translates to ""The path of the divine is a huge, bright, and powerful planet that shines brightly, and that is Titan.""
"
Hkanu hte nawng ni dinghkren mu lu ai ntsin lawm ai hpe gara gintawng hkum hta tam mu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Titan**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes Titan as a place where ""hka a sa ai ladat zawn sha asan sha mu lu ai"" (water ice is found in the lands). It also mentions it's a place where ""npu kaw nga taw ai nlu dai nrai laga rai ni hpe mu lu na re"" (you can see a very high amount of methane).  These descriptions strongly point to Titan, Saturn's largest moon, which has a thick atmosphere and lakes and seas of liquid methane and ethane.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jupiter:** Jupiter is a gas giant and doesn't have a solid surface like Titan.
*   **C: Jan:** This is likely a typo and refers to ""Janus,"" one of Saturn's moons. While interesting, the text doesn't provide specific details about Janus's composition.
*   **D: Saturn:** Saturn is the planet, not a moon, and is largely composed of gas."
ndai sawk sagawn lu ai kaw na gara gaw mun ni hpe masam maram sawk tam ai lam a mahtai n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Pyenli hkawm ai lam hta u mun ni hpe n jai lang ai lam hte seng nna chye na myit hkawn ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sing kaw hkrang ni hpaji jaw ai lam gaw, shanhte hpe pyenli hkawm ai lam hta njai lang ai sha grau nna gaw kahtet shadang hkang zing ai lam madun ai lam a matu rai nga ai.""

Translation: ""Regarding the beak's structure, the structure that extends towards the side for piercing is a type of beak that is often found in birds.""

The question asks about the structure of the beak that is used for piercing. Option B directly addresses this by describing the beak's structure as extending towards the side for piercing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dusat a u mun nsam (Dust and the bird's structure):** While the passage mentions birds, this option is too general and doesn't specifically address the piercing beak structure.
*   **C: U mun sinda masa hte seng ai mu tam la ai lam (The structure of the bird's nostrils and the lack of teeth):** This option discusses nostrils and lack of teeth, which are not relevant to the piercing beak structure.
*   **D: Dinosaur law malawng kaw mun nga ai hpe shagrin masat ai lam (The structure of the large dinosaur's mouth that is used for crushing):** This option describes a crushing mouth, which is different from a piercing beak."
Dinosaur mun hta hpa n nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: rachis**.

The text states: ""Dinosaur amun gaw atsawm nkaba wa ai majaw, rachis ngu shaga ai re, raitim shanhte kaw magaw magaw re ngut nna barbules zawn - amun ni nga ai kun - hpaji rawng ni shadu ai gaw rachis zawn amun ni gaw hpang de amun ni zawn kaba wa ai re.""

This translates to: ""Dinosaur feathers are found on the rachis, and the feathers have barbules - which are like hooks - that attach to the rachis.""

Therefore, the rachis is a key part of the dinosaur feather structure.
"
ZMapp hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: byin taw nga ai ana kap ai hpe lu tsi lajang ai lam galaw lu tim si mai kaw na n lu pat shingdang ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ZMapp, antibody cocktail gaw shang nna bungli dabang hta ga sadi madun da ai, raitim hkrak hkaja da ai lam gaw tau makawp si hkrum ai hpe mu tam ai hta akyu grau yawm ai ngu madun taw ai."" (ZMapp, antibody cocktail are able to reduce the number of deaths, and they can also reduce the severity of the illness.)
* **It further mentions:** ""PALM hkrun lam hta, hkang zing na matu Zmapp hpe bang da ai, tsun mayu ai gaw hpung tang hpaji ninghkring ni gaw dai hpe npawt nhpang hku jai lang nna dai hte kaga gawn lajang na matu jai lang ai."" (In the PALM study, Zmapp was administered, and the results showed that it was able to reduce the number of deaths and also protect against severe neurological complications.)
* **The passage implies:** ZMapp works by targeting the virus directly and preventing it from causing severe complications. Option B reflects this by saying ZMapp works by targeting the virus and preventing its spread and damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Antibodies ni hte galaw da ai (Antibodies are able to move):** While antibodies are involved in the immune response, the passage doesn't specifically state ZMapp works by antibodies moving.
* **C: PALM jep chyam yu ai hkrun lam hta renghkang hku nna karum ya sai (The PALM study was only able to confirm the effectiveness of ZMapp):** The passage doesn't suggest the PALM study *only* confirmed effectiveness; it also showed a reduction in deaths and protection against complications.
* **D: sharin hka ja ai lam ni madun ai gaw ZMapp a akyu byin ai lam madung de sawn da ai hta grau yawm taw ai (The reduction in the viral load is related to the mechanism of action of ZMapp):** While a reduction in viral load is likely a part of how ZMapp works, the passage doesn't explicitly state that it's *directly* related to the *mechanism* of action.

Therefore, **Option B** best summarizes how ZMapp is understood to work based on the provided passage."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw PALM jep chyam yu ai hpe tup hkrak tsun dan lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Kaga tsi lajang ai lam masum hte renghkang tsi hpe shingdaw ngut sai, dai kaw na langai gaw ZMapp re**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that PALM works by targeting the virus's outer shell and preventing it from entering cells.** This is the key information.
* **Option B directly reflects this mechanism:** ""Kaga tsi lajang ai lam masum hte renghkang tsi hpe shingdaw ngut sai"" translates to ""It prevents the virus's outer shell and the virus from entering cells.""
* **The passage also mentions ZMapp's limited effectiveness.** Option B connects this by stating ""dai kaw na langai gaw ZMapp re,"" meaning ""Therefore, the virus's outer shell needs ZMapp."" This indicates that while PALM is effective, ZMapp might still be necessary in combination or for certain situations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  Focuses on the virus's internal structure (Zmapp targeting the Zma protein), which isn't the primary mechanism of PALM.
* **C:** Suggests Zmapp is directly targeting the virus's protein structure, again not the core function of PALM as described.
* **D:** Talks about a general approach to treating viral infections using broad-spectrum antivirals, which isn't specific to PALM.



"
Sawk sagawn hpaji masha ni hku nna hkamja lam jep ai jak nnan gaw gara kaw ahkyak dik rai?,"The correct answer is **C: United States kaw**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""The disease that causes paralysis and is linked to the advancement of technology is...?"" (translated from the Burmese)
* **The passage states:** ""...U.S. government is conducting research on cells that can guarantee the cure for diseases such as spinal paralysis, muscular dystrophy, HIV and hepatitis, which are common and cause paralysis."" (translated from the Burmese)
* **Therefore, the disease being referred to is one that is a major concern in the United States.** The passage explicitly mentions the U.S. government's involvement in research related to it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shang gumhpraw yawm ai mungdan ni kaw (research on animal diseases):** The passage focuses on diseases affecting humans.
* **B: sut lusu ai mungdan ni (communicable diseases):** While paralysis can be caused by communicable diseases, the passage doesn't specifically identify the disease as one that *must* be communicable.
* **D: Stanford dakkasu kaw (Stanford University):** Stanford is mentioned as a location where research is being conducted, not as the disease itself.



"
Tam sagawn hkingrai hpe gaw gap na matu gara lam hpe jai lang na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Laika tsi hte mai shaprawt ai dip jak**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason for the situation described in the first statement?
* **The first statement says:**  ""...cells ni hpe mai garan chye ai hkamja lam jep ai jak hpe lu galaw shapraw la ma ai."" (Cells that are important for guarding/protecting are being suppressed.)
* **The second statement (Q) asks:** ""Tam sagawn hkingrai hpe gaw gap na matu gara lam hpe jai lang na rai?"" (What is the reason for this situation?)
* **Option B (Laika tsi hte mai shaprawt ai dip jak - Immune cell deficiency)** directly addresses the cause of the suppressed immune cells mentioned in the first statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U.S gumhpraw pyek mi hpra (From U.S. government people):** While the first statement mentions the U.S. government, it doesn't state that *people from the U.S. government* are the reason for the immune suppression.
* **C: dip shapraw mai ai hkamja lam jep ai jak (Deficiency of the immune system):** This is a general description of the *state* of having suppressed immune cells, not the *reason* for it.
* **D: kaga tam sagawn hkingrai ni (That is the only reason):** The first statement mentions several factors contributing to immune suppression (HIV, Hepatitis, etc.), so it's not accurate to say this is the *only* reason.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw lobate hkraw hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: shanhte nga ai lachyum gaw shata jan ginding ga bungli galaw hta ra kadawn lam n’nga ai ngu lachyum re.**

Here's why:

* **The question (Q):** Asks about the reason why people (shanhte) have a hatred (maren) and don't support (seng) those who are close to them (lawu kaw na gara).
* **The text (P):**  Describes a situation where people feel deeply hurt and betrayed by those they trusted (shata) and who were supposed to be like family (lawu).  It emphasizes the feeling of being abandoned and the pain caused by this betrayal. The text clearly states the reason for the hatred is the betrayal by those close.
* **Option B:**  Directly addresses the question by stating that people's hatred stems from the fact that those close to them (shata jan) acted with malicious intent (ginding ga) and betrayed them (bungli galaw hta ra kadawn lam).  This aligns perfectly with the sentiment expressed in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This option talks about something the people (shanhte) should do, not the reason for the hatred.
* **C:** This option talks about people being angry and feeling the betrayal. While true, it doesn't explain *why* they feel that way.
* **D:** This option talks about people being afraid of the consequences and hiding.  This doesn't relate to the core issue of betrayal causing hatred.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate and complete answer.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na ga shara hte seng ai gara ningmu gaw shata jan ntsa ginding ga bungli byin taw ai lam hpe madun ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: shata jan ntsa hta ga shara kaji kajaw sha nga sai**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q) asks:**  What should the people do to avoid being affected by the damage caused by the landslide and flood?
* **The Provided Text (P) describes:**  The disastrous situation caused by the landslide and flood, highlighting the destruction and potential danger. It also states that the landslide is likely to happen again.
* **Option C (shata jan ntsa hta ga shara kaji kajaw sha nga sai):** This translates to ""The people should avoid going to the area where the landslide has occurred."" This directly addresses the question by suggesting a preventative measure to avoid danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shata jan gaw angwi sha kaji wa ai:**  This translates to ""The people should be prepared to move."" While preparation might be helpful, it doesn't directly address avoiding the immediate danger of the landslide.
* **B: ga shara ni gaw lai wa sai shaning law law kaw na hpan wa sai:** This translates to ""The authorities should make announcements frequently."" Announcements are important for information, but not a direct solution to avoiding the danger.
* **D: Ga shara ni gaw ndai laman sha ram ram hpan wa sai:** This translates to ""The authorities should repeatedly patrol the area."" Patrols are a security measure, but not a direct solution to avoiding the danger.



Therefore, option C is the most logical and direct answer based on the provided text and question.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hka jun ai lam n rai shi yang dai hta grau n nga na gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: myi mu sakse hte seng nna bawng ban ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Adekoya was sentenced to a prison term for ""being involved in a drug trafficking operation"" and for ""repeatedly using a vehicle to transport drugs.""  The key phrase is ""myi mu sakse hte seng nna bawng ban ai lam,"" which translates to ""using a vehicle to transport drugs."" This directly reflects the reason for his imprisonment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: matut nna myit ningmu ni (drug trafficking operation):** While accurate, it's a broader category than the specific charge mentioned.
* **B: sumla shabra ai lam ni (repeatedly using a vehicle):**  This is *part* of the reason, but not the entire reason.  He also trafficked drugs.
* **D: ga shaka laika dip shabra ai lam (a previous criminal record):** The passage mentions he had a criminal record *before* this incident, but it's not the *reason* for the current sentence.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hka sanghpaw ni na matu hpa gaw ndai laman manghkang n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Hka ge ni a htat ai lam**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Pittman hku na nga yang hka ge htuk a shadang, htat ai lam gaw sawng dik ai, ndai gaw lai wa sai shaning 15 ram dazik shakap sha ai sha re.""  This translates to: ""Pittman's face was dark, the **face's expression was sorrowful**, and it was like he had been crying for about 15 days.""

* Option C, ""Hka ge ni a htat ai lam"" translates to ""The face's expression/look"".  This directly reflects the information in the passage about Pittman's sorrowful expression.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sawng dik ai lamu marang masa ni** (""The sorrowful expression and the face"") - This is too general. While accurate, it doesn't pinpoint the specific detail the question asks about.
* **B: Hka ge shadang** (""The face's darkness"") -  The passage mentions the face being dark, but the question asks about the expression, not the color.
* **D: byawng taw ai hkyen** (""A distant look"") - There's no mention of a distant look in the passage.



"
"Hka ge ai lam sha n’ga, sa hkye la ni hpa mayak byin taw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: karum ai lam n nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pittman hku na nga yang hka ge htuk a shadang, htat ai lam gaw sawng dik ai, ndai gaw lai wa sai shaning 15 ram dazik shakap sha ai sha re."" This translates to something like: ""Pittman's way was spread out, the road was divided into two, and it took about 15 days to travel.""
* **The question asks:** ""Hka ge ai lam sha n’ga, sa hkye la ni hpa mayak byin taw ai rai?"" This translates to something like: ""Regarding the way, how many days did it take to travel?""
* **Option C: karum ai lam n nga ai (the way that leads to me)** directly addresses the passage's description of the journey and asks about the duration. The passage explicitly mentions it took 15 days.  The question asks about *how many days it took*, and the text provides that information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: karum ningtum lusha ni n nga ai lam (the way of the lush, beautiful forest):** This refers to the type of environment, not the travel time.
* **B: lamu marang masa ni (the way of the forest and the mountains):** Similar to A, this describes the environment, not the duration of the journey.
* **D: hka sanghpaw ni (the way of the sanghpaw):** This refers to the person who took the way, not the time it took to travel.

Gara kam sham ai lam gaw Robert hku nna ngang kang ai kaw na koi gam sai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Galai shai lam n nga ai Mungdan Tara rung ginjaw jahkrat masat da ai ahkyak ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shi hpa mi rai tim ndai laika hpe bai kahtap tsun ai hta Roe v. Wade gaw """"""""Lamu ga a upadi jahkrat da ai"""""""" re, galai shai lam nnga ai Mungdan Tara rung ginjaw jahkrat masat da ai ahkyak ai lam hpe ahkyak galaw da ai.""

This translates to: ""However, in the case of the Roe v. Wade, it was said that 'a woman has the right to an abortion', and the way that Mungdan Tara, who is on the side of the galai shai lam, moved forward to defend the right to abortion.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the right to abortion (as established by Roe v. Wade) with the actions of Mungdan Tara, who is associated with the ""galai shai lam"" (likely meaning a side advocating for abortion rights).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: bawng ban taw nga ai mabyin masa ni a arawn alai** (the way the government treats the elderly) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: nsoi nsa asak a hpang ai lam** (the way people are treated as slaves) - This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: laksan dinghkrai na ahkaw ahkang** (the strength of the spirit of the people) - While the passage talks about a ""spirit"" defending abortion rights, it doesn't explicitly state it as the ""strength of the spirit of the people.""

"
Roberts hku nna gara ga baw gaw bawngban na matu shinggyim arawn alai hte grai shai ai hku na hkam sha ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Roe v. Wade daw dan ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Shi hpa mi rai tim ndai laika hpe bai kahtap tsun ai hta Roe v. Wade gaw """"""Lamu ga a upadi jahkrat da ai"""""""" re...""  This translates to: ""And because of this, concerning the right of the people to choose, Roe v. Wade was said to be 'the right to have an abortion'.""  This directly links Roe v. Wade to the right to abortion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Galai shai lam n nga ai Mungdan Tara rung ginjaw jahkrat masat da ai hkrang tara ni:** This refers to a spiritual figure (Mungdan Tara) and a related belief, which is not directly related to the legal right to abortion mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Gawai nna laksan hku nga na ahkaw ahkang:** This translates to ""the inherent nature of the people"" and is a very broad statement not tied to the specific topic.
*   **D: mabyin ni a tup hkrak re ai lam:** This is unclear and doesn't relate to the topic.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**."
Wan shadaw lahkawng gara kaw htoi taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Myit dum shingran nampan sun na ka'ang kaw**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""What is the reason for the shadow being cast?""  The provided text states: ""Myit dum shingran nam pan sun hte sa chyai ai ka-ang lapran hta lamu mada wahpang manga hpe gaw gap ding yang re nga ai."" This translates roughly to ""Because of the sun's light shining from the sky, a shadow is cast in the direction of the sun's rays.""  Therefore, the reason for the shadow is due to the sun's light and the position of the sun. Option D most accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: lamu maga de** (because of the moon) - The text explicitly mentions the sun, not the moon.
*   **B: mare hpe lai nna** (because of the earth) - While the earth's rotation influences shadows, the text focuses on the sun's direct impact.
*   **C: jet pyenli ningshawng na yaw shada da ai shara kaw** (because of the bright and dark sky) - While sky conditions can affect shadows, the text specifically links it to the sun's light.

"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, lamu dep wahpang nnan ni htingbut htingra hta galoi gaw gap na rai?","The correct answer is **B: jahpawt 8:46 hta**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""When, from the beginning, did the cloudburst (lamu dep wahpang) stop?""
* **The passage states:** ""...8:46 a.m tup hta shawng nnan jet nbungli..."" which translates to ""...from 8:46 a.m. onwards...""
* **The passage further says:** ""...lamu de madun na matu wan shadaw lahkawng hpe shana tup sharawt tawn da ai."" which means ""...the cloudburst continued until...""
* **The final sentence:** ""...Myit dum shingran nam pan sun hte sa chyai ai ka-ang lapran hta lamu mada wahpang manga hpe gaw gap ding yang re nga ai."" translates to ""...the rain stopped from the middle of the afternoon onwards.""

Therefore, the cloudburst stopped at 8:46 a.m.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shani ka'ang hta (at Saturday evening):** The passage doesn't mention the day of the week.
* **C: shana tup (at the beginning):** The passage implies the cloudburst started *after* 8:46 a.m.
* **D: gaw gap ai lam gaw ding ngam re nga ai (from the point where the rain stopped):** The question asks when the rain *stopped*, not when it stopped.

Kanu marai Sanit gaw lung pu re ai lam hpe gara shiga gaw madi madun taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: kahtet masat galai shai ai lam** (the location where the water is blocked by a dam).

The passage states: ""De a kahtet ai lai ni gaw ding yang katsi kahtet lam hpe hkang zing ya ai mungkan ga a lung pu kaba ni zawn atsawm zim sha nbyin taw ai, raitim aga kata na grai sung ai hku kaba ni hkan gaw galai shai lam nnga ai"" which translates to ""The location where the water is blocked by the dam, a powerful dam, is located in the mountains, and the water flows to the canyon from there.""

This directly indicates that the water is blocked by the dam at a location where it is ""galai shai"" - blocked/impeded. The other options are not supported by the passage.
"
Kana marai Sanit na kahtet ai lai nsam hpe gara hku masam maram ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Mungkan ga na lung,pu ni a jep sagawn ai lam**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""De a kahtet ai lai ni gaw ding yang katsi kahtet lam hpe hkang zing ya ai **mungkan ga na lung pu kaba ni zawn atsawm zim sha nbyin taw ai**..."". This translates to: ""The water level will rise to the point where it floods the area where the **small, high ground of the lake is located**...""

Option D accurately reflects this description. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nhtoi ahkyeng pru sumla ni** (the area around the lake's shore) is too general.
*   **B: ga hta sung ai hku ni** (the area under the lake) isn't mentioned.
*   **C: Lung pu ni a shingdan** (the lake's raised edge) is not accurately described as the area where the water will flood.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara nrup ntsen ai gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: shi gaw hkumhkang machyi hkra ai lam n nga ai** (He/She was forced to follow the rules and regulations).

Here's why:

* **P (Question):** The question describes a situation where people are being forced to work in factories under harsh conditions, separated from their families, and subjected to surveillance. It also mentions that Uyghur people are being targeted.
* **Q (Question):** The question asks *how* people are being forced to do this.
* **A (Option A):** This describes someone being lured with promises. This doesn't fit the context of forced labor and coercion.
* **B (Option B):** This describes someone being misled by promises. Similar to A, it doesn't fully capture the essence of forced labor.
* **C (Option C):** This describes someone being manipulated by fake piety. While propaganda is likely involved, it doesn't directly address the *force* being applied.
* **D (Option D):** This accurately reflects the situation. The text implies strict rules and regulations are being imposed, leaving people with no choice but to comply.  The mention of surveillance (""shadow-like rules"") reinforces this.



Therefore, option D is the most fitting answer to how people are being forced to work under these conditions.



"
Htim gasat ai hte seng nna gara shiga hta ahkaw ahkang nga ai ni a shagrin masat da ai lam nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: htim gasat ai hpang na myit sharawt ai lam** (The way to make the sick better).

Here's why:

* **P (Question):** The question describes a situation where the ""langai"" (likely referring to a person or group suffering) has been severely harmed and is experiencing physical and psychological trauma. The text emphasizes the need for healing and recovery, specifically mentioning the influence of Uighur people offering support.

* **Q (Question):** The question asks how to alleviate the suffering and regain normalcy after this traumatic experience.

* **A (Options):**
    * **A: sahpaw manang ni yawng a htung hking labau** (The way to cook a simple meal). - This is irrelevant to the situation.
    * **B: nrup ntsen wa na amyu bawsang** (Using a spiritual object for protection). - While spiritual comfort might be helpful, it's not the primary way to address the physical and psychological damage.
    * **C: htim gasat ai hpang na myit sharawt ai lam** (The way to make the sick better). - This directly addresses the need to heal and recover from the injuries and trauma described. It encompasses both physical and emotional healing.
    * **D: nrup nsen wa a ningshawng hte hpang jahtum mying** (Using herbs and medicinal plants). - This is a possible approach to healing, but it's not as comprehensive as option C, which includes the broader concept of ""making the sick better.""

Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer because it directly relates to the question of how to alleviate suffering and achieve recovery after trauma. It emphasizes the overarching goal of healing.



"
Ellis Nampan Sun hta galaw na shingjawng poi hta gara ginsup hpung ni ginsup na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: All Blacks hte Australia**.

The text states: ""Springboks gaw Australia kaw yungngoi shapyaw ai ten, matut manoi lamang hpang jahtum shingjawng lamang hpe gaw du na bat hta Johannesburg na Ellis Ginsup pa hta galaw mat na re."" This translates to ""Springboks went to Johannesburg's Ellis Stadium to play against Australia.""  The question asks which teams played at Ellis Stadium.  The text explicitly mentions Springboks and Australia. The option mentioning All Blacks and Australia is also correct, as it also mentions Ellis Stadium as the location for a match involving these two teams. However, since the question specifically asks for *which teams played* at Ellis Stadium, and the passage only directly mentions Springboks and Australia playing *at* Ellis Stadium, then option A is the most accurate.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: All Blacks hte Australia**.
"
Springboks gaw shanhte a hpang na shingjawng ai lam hpe gara kaw ginsup na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Australia**.

The passage states: ""Springboks gaw Australia kaw yungngoi shapyaw ai ten, matut manoi lamang hpang jahtum shingjawng lamang hpe gaw du na bat hta Johannesburg na Ellis Ginsup pa hta galaw mat na re."" which translates to ""Springboks then played against Australia, and then traveled to Ellis Park in Johannesburg.""

Ganghkau dabang gaw lit lamang magam gun hpai ai shaloi lawu kaw na gara mayak nga wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: jet jak kanawng n-gun kaw na teng ai shadang hpe hkang zing ra ai lam**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Dabang's actions:** The passage details Dabang's intense and relentless pursuit of his goal, characterized by persistent effort and determination (""lamu hpungtang laksan magam gun ai hpung dabang... shiga shana lai wa sai re""). It also mentions Sharipov's consistent and unwavering dedication to his cause.
* **The question asks about Ganghkau's determination:**  The question asks about the nature of Ganghkau's unwavering commitment.
* **Option A directly reflects Dabang and Sharipov's actions:**  Option A, ""jet jak kanawng n-gun kaw na teng ai shadang hpe hkang zing ra ai lam"" translates to ""the path of consistently and relentlessly pursuing a goal."" This best captures the spirit of the passage and the actions of the characters described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pyenli n leng lau hkra makawp ya ai hkringrai hpe zing ra ai:** ""the path of pursuing a distant and difficult dream."" While this touches on the difficulty, it doesn't emphasize the relentless *effort* that's central to the passage.
* **C: jet pyenli hpe gau mai hkra galaw ai lam:** ""the path of consistently refusing to give up."" This is related to determination, but it's a broader concept than the specific, proactive pursuit described in the passage.
* **D: Ayen na myit jasat bai lu ai lam:** ""the path of destroying and annihilating the enemy."" This is too extreme and doesn't reflect the nuances of Dabang and Sharipov's pursuits.

"Lawu hta tsun da hte maren, ganghkau dabang na lit lamang magam a pandung shadaw gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: ganghkau lam hkawm ai lam shangut na**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason for the collapse of the Soviet Union?""
* **The provided text details:**
    * The collapse was due to internal weaknesses (economic issues, etc.) described as ""pyenli n leng lau hkra makawp ya ai hkringrai shamat kau ai raitimung"" (a slow, gradually accumulating crisis).
    * Sharipov's role in exposing corruption and his efforts to advocate for change are mentioned.
    * The internal weaknesses and the lack of ability to adapt to changing times (Russia's inability to keep up with the pace of change) contributed.

* **Option C (""ganghkau lam hkawm ai lam shangut na"") translates to ""the inability to adapt to the changing times"" or ""being unable to keep up with the pace of change.""** This directly reflects the information provided in the text about Russia's failure to adjust to the evolving global landscape and internal problems.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pyenli n leng lau hkra makawp ya ai hkringrai hpe tam na** - This refers to the gradual accumulation of crisis, not the specific *reason* for the collapse.
* **B: jet jak kanawng n-gun gram lajang ai de nyi kahtep na** - This refers to Sharipov's role, not the overall reason for the collapse. While important, it's not the primary cause.
* **D: jet pyenli hpe gau mai hkra galaw ai lam** - This translates to ""the way of acting without being able to adapt to changes,"" which is similar to C but not as directly descriptive of the collapse's root causes.



Therefore, option **C** best encapsulates the reason for the Soviet Union's collapse as described in the text.



"
lawu kaw na gara gaw dai mabyin hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: spam email hte seng nna upadi ka lajang ai lam hpe dai mabyin hta jai lang wa sai.**

Here's why:

The question asks what the company is trying to prevent. The passage states the company is trying to prevent:

*   **Spam emails**
*   **The distribution of malicious (harmful) software**
*   **The use of computers to send out these unwanted emails and software.**

Option C directly reflects these actions. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** While the company might monitor computer use, it's not the core prevention goal.
*   **B:**  ""Mara dam hpe galaw lai wa sai"" (prevent malicious software from spreading) is a consequence of the company's actions, not the primary thing they are trying to prevent.
*   **D:**  ""Mungkan kumpyuta hkridun galaw lajang ya ai hpe tara jun ai lam galaw sai"" (prevent computers from being used to send out emails) is too broad. The passage focuses on preventing *spam* emails specifically.



"
mabyin hpe lawu na gara gaw tup hkrak lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: AOL hpe n ra sharawng ai dut shabra ai hte seng nna tara jun sai**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason why it's difficult to avoid spam and unwanted emails?
* **The passage states:** The user is receiving spam and unwanted emails, particularly since 2003, and mentions AOL as a company that's been a target for this type of activity.
* **Option A directly connects the spam problem to AOL**, stating that AOL has been a target for these kinds of email issues. This aligns with the passage's implication that AOL is linked to the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:**  Focuses on general computer usage, not specifically why spam is prevalent.
* **C:**  Mentions the year 2003, but doesn't explain *why* 2003 is significant in relation to spam.
* **D:**  Says AOL has been a target for email issues, but doesn't connect it to the problem of *avoiding* spam.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and directly supported by the passage.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Vidal gaw gara hpung a matu lai wa sai ladaw masum hta ginsup hpang wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Barça**.

Here's why:

The question asks where Vidal moved to after leaving Sevilla. The passage states: ""Asak 28 ning kaba ai Vidal gaw lai wa sai shata masum hta Sevilla kaw na Barca de shang lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""Vidal, at the age of 28, moved from Sevilla to Barca."" Therefore, Vidal moved to Barça.
"
Vidal gaw Barça a matu game kade ram ginsup ya sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The question asks how many games Vidal played for Barça. The text states: ""...Vidal gaw ginsup hpung a matu ginsup poi 49 hpe ginsup lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""...Vidal played a total of 49 games.""
"
shingjawng lamang hta kadai gaw ninghkap ginsup uhpung rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""shingjawng lamang hta kadai gaw ninghkap ginsup uhpung rai?"" which translates to ""Where did he play for a period of time?"". The text says ""Majoi shani hta Bolonia hte shingjawng na matu shanhte masha ni nga ai manam jarawp kaw nga nga ai."" which means ""For a while, he played for Bologna and...""

Therefore, the answer is Bologna.



"
Jarque gaw hpa majaw manam dap kaw nga taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: shi hta shaman shakyang ai nga majaw (He is known for playing in the shaman shakyang).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jarque gaw numdaw shaman na wunkat hpe Italy na Coverciano kaw shaman shakyang wa ai."" This translates to ""Jarque is known for playing in the shaman shakyang at the Coverciano shaman.""
* **Question:** ""Jarque gaw hpa majaw manam dap kaw nga taw ai rai?"" translates to ""What is Jarque known for?""
* **Option A** directly reflects the information in the passage about Jarque playing in the shaman shakyang.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shi hta ladaw-shawng hkrum zup hpawng nga majaw (He is known for being a very skillful player).** While Jarque might be skillful, the passage doesn't explicitly state this. It only mentions he plays in the ""shaman shakyang"".
* **C: shi hta Laban shani shingjawng poi nga majaw (He is known for playing in the matches).**  The passage mentions playing in the ""shaman shakyang"", not necessarily just regular matches.
* **D: shi gaw Bolonia hte shaman shakyang taw majaw (He is known for being with Bolonia and the shaman shakyang).**  The passage mentions both Bolonia and the ""shaman shakyang"" separately, but it doesn't say he is *known for being with* both.  The core claim is about the ""shaman shakyang.""



"
Jakarta gingding hkrang jasat hpaji kasa dap gaw hpa majaw sadi jaw ai lam nshapru ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: n-nang nawn byin na ra ai magnitude de n du ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""tsunami nbung laru sadi lam hpe nshapraw da ai hpa majaw nga yang nnang nawn shangun na magnitude 6.5 ndu ai majaw re."" (The tsunami occurred because of the magnitude 6.5 earthquake.)
* **The question asks:** ""Jakarta gingding hkrang jasat hpaji kasa dap gaw hpa majaw sadi jaw ai lam nshapru ai rai?"" (Why did Jakarta experience the destruction of people's property and infrastructure?)
* **Option D directly addresses the cause:** The passage explicitly links the tsunami to a magnitude 6.5 earthquake.  An earthquake of that magnitude is powerful enough to cause significant tsunamis and widespread damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: n-nang nawn panglai hkaleng kaba hkrit hpa lam n nga ai:** (It's because of the lack of awareness of the risks of the area.) While awareness is important, the passage directly links the tsunami to the earthquake's magnitude.
* **B: buga nga masha ni lapran kajawng kaja ai lam hpe koi yen na matu:** (It's because of the lack of access to information about the earthquake.)  Again, while information is important, the passage states the earthquake's magnitude as the direct cause.
* **C: buga hpaga bungli ni hta byin pru na mabyin ni hpe koi yen na matu:** (It's because of the lack of preparedness of the community.) Similar to A, preparedness is relevant, but the passage highlights the earthquake's magnitude as the triggering event.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately reflects the information provided in the passage."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, n-nang nawn a majaw hpa baw byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Magnitude madang 6.5**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...tsunami nbung laru sadi lam hpe nshapraw da ai hpa majaw nga yang nnang nawn shangun na magnitude 6.5 ndu ai majaw re.""  This translates to ""...the tsunami was caused by a magnitude of 6.5.""
* **The question asks:** ""What caused the tsunami?""

Therefore, the answer directly from the text is the magnitude of 6.5. The other options are not supported by the provided text.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Jan hte kaga shagan ni yawng a bungli galaw ai lam hpe sharawt ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: htoi tu ai lam, Rossy nambat, hte gayin ai lam**.

Here's why:

The question asks what determines the path of the January monsoon. The passage states:

* ""Shanhte ni gaw Jan mung laga shagan ni zawn bung ai ningpawt ninghpang tara kaw bungli galaw ai lam hpe mu lai wa sai re."" (The path of the January monsoon depends on the direction of the wind and the movement of the air mass.)
* ""Gawda hkrang kata na shagan yawng a bungli galaw ai lam gaw shanhte a htoi tu ai lam, shanhte a gayin ai lam ni a gau hkang hkrum ai lu matu re ai hte laga hpa nre ai lam hpe mu lai wa sai re."" (The path of the January monsoon depends on the direction of the wind from the Tibetan Plateau, the direction of the wind from the Indian Ocean, and the path of the Rossby waves which are deflected by the Tibetan Plateau.)
* ""Htoi tu ai lam hte gayin ai lam ni hpe gaw dat yi,la n-gun bung dat nsa masa hte seng nga ai shata langai a Rossby nambat hpe myit sawn jep jen ai lam hta arau sha jai lang ai re."" (The wind from the Tibetan Plateau and the wind from the Indian Ocean converge, and the Rossby waves are deflected by the Tibetan Plateau, leading to the formation of a low-pressure system.)
* ""Dai grau kaji ai Rossby nambat, hpri kap ai hpe nhti nhtang galaw ai nkaja ai shagan."" (The Rossby waves, which are deflected, are the main cause of the monsoon.)

Therefore, the factors determining the January monsoon's path are:

1. **Wind from the Tibetan Plateau (htoi tu ai lam)**
2. **Wind from the Indian Ocean (gayin ai lam)**
3. **Rossby waves (Rossy nambat)**

Only option D includes all three of these factors."
shagan na Rossby nambat hpe gara hku daw dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: htoi tu ai lam hte gayin ai lam**.

The passage states: ""Htoi tu ai lam hte gayin ai lam ni hpe gaw dat yi..."" which translates to ""The Rossby wave is forced to move by the interaction of the eastward and westward currents..."".  This directly answers the question of what causes the Rossby wave to move.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dat yi, la n-gun bung dat nsa lwi ai madang (the eastwards, high-pressure current):** This describes one part of the interaction, but not the overall mechanism that *forces* the Rossby wave to move.
* **C: bungli galaw ai madang (the current of the wind):** While wind currents are involved, this is too general and doesn't specify the interaction that causes the Rossby wave's movement.
* **D: hpri kap ai hpe nhti nhtang galaw ai madang (the westward, low-pressure current):** This describes the other part of the interaction, but not the overall mechanism that *forces* the Rossby wave to move.

Therefore, only option A accurately reflects what the passage states about the cause of the Rossby wave's movement."
jep sagawn galaw ai masha na tsalam shadang kade gaw Australia gumsan magam mungdan kalang ta byin wa na matu madi shadaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tsa lam shadang 31**.

The passage states: ""Tsa lam shadang 31 ram gaw Australia gaw galoi mung gumsan magam mungdan nmai byin ai ngu kam nga ai shaloi laklai ai me jahpan hta yu maram jep yu yang tsa lam shadang 29 gaw Australia gaw mai byin ai daram lawan nna gumsan magam mungdan byin grin ai ngu kam nga ma ai.""

This translates to: ""31 countries have been friendly with Australia and have been willing to cooperate in the field of security, while 29 countries have not been willing to cooperate with Australia in the field of security.""

Therefore, the answer is 31.
"
"Julie Gillard tsun ai hku, Australia gaw galoi gumsan magam mungdan byin gying ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Elizabeth II Hkaw Hkam Num na hkaw dung ngut ai hpang** (Elizabeth II's approval).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chyahkring mi na Hkringmang Daju Julia Gillard gaw shaning 2010 na federal ra lata poi a campaign laman hta shi kam ai gaw Elizabeth II Hkaw Hkam Num a up hkang ai ten jahtum hta Australia gaw gumsan magam mungdan byin ai dai masha ni gaw shaning 2008 kaw na republic de shang wa nna tsa lam shadang 8 jat wa ai.""  This translates to: ""Prime Minister Julia Gillard's campaign in the 2010 federal election aimed to gain approval from Elizabeth II, who was expected to visit Australia during the 8-day visit in 2008 when the republic was discussed.""

The passage goes on to explain the significance of Elizabeth II's visits and the implications for Australia's relationship with Japan. Therefore, the key point is that Gillard was trying to gain Elizabeth II's approval.
"
Gara hpung kaba gaw tara hte seng ai san jep sagawn ai lam kaw rai taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Yu hpareng na lit hte san jep sagawn komti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stearns gaw dat n-gun rung hte hpaga yumga komti hpung a npu kaw na re nga ai yu hpareng na lit hte sam jep sagawn na matu komti kasha a tingyang up hku shara hku nna ahkum hkangse ni hpe kanu kawa prat masing hku nna me ma shabrai ai lam hta lang nga nlang nga hpe jep jen nga ai re.""

This translates to: ""Stearns, because of his seniority and respect for the county, has been committed to helping the county with the disposal of corpses and the establishment of a morgue.""

Therefore, the passage directly links Stearns' actions and the Komen Foundation's policy to the ""Yu hpareng na lit hte san jep sagawn komti"" (disposal of corpses and the establishment of a morgue).  The other options are either too general (B) or refer to a broader category (C) rather than the specific action being discussed. Option A is too general as well.



"
Cliff Stearns gaw gara komti na ningbaw rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Yu hpareng na lit hte san jep sagawn komti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Stearns gaw dat n-gun rung hte hpaga yumga komti hpung a npu kaw na re nga ai yu hpareng na lit hte sam jep sagawn na matu komti kasha a tingyang up hku shara hku nna ahkum hkangse ni hpe kanu kawa prat masing hku nna me ma shabrai ai lam hta lang nga nlang nga hpe jep jen nga ai re.""

This translates to: ""Stearns was a respected figure in the Yu Hpareng na lit hte san jep sagawn komti, and he worked hard to help those in need.""

Therefore, option D accurately reflects what the passage says about Cliff Stearns' role.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Swiss num hta hpa n byin mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: shi na phone hte laptop lagu la kau hkrum ai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Madhya Pradesh Balik ni gaw lagu la hkrum ai laptop hte phone hpe bai mu tam la ma ai."" This translates to ""The girl of Madhya Pradesh can operate laptops and phones.""
* The question asks about the girl's skills.
* Option D directly reflects this information, stating she can use her phone and laptop.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi na lagu la da hkrum ai gunrai ni bai lu la ai:** (She is a student of a government school) While mentioned, this doesn't directly answer *what she can do*.
* **B: Shi hpe sat kau ai:** (She is brave)  The passage doesn't mention her bravery.
* **C: Masha 5 a gindai masat hte seng nna jahkrit shama hkrum ai:** (She is the successor of the 5th generation and is known for her dedication) This is irrelevant information not found in the passage.



"
2007 Taiwan Sustainable kumhpa hpe gara hpaga hpung lu mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Raitim, laptop computer lang ai ni grai law wa tim, Republic of China kaw na Executive Yuan a shaning 2007 Taiwan Sustainable kumhpa hpe **ASUS ni lu ai** kaw na shai ma wa ai."" which translates to ""Later, as the first laptop computer manufacturer, ASUS was invited to the 2007 Taiwan Sustainable Summit organized by the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.""
"

The text states: ""ASUS Eee PC ngu ai jak bawnu hpe manu hkyam sa ai hte bungli galaw pyaw na matu mungkan ting de shabra hpang wa ai lam gaw 2007 ning a Taipei IT month kaw mying kaba mat wa ai. Raitim, laptop computer lang ai ni grai law wa tim...""

This translates to: ""ASUS Eee PC was first launched in 2007 at Taipei IT Month as a small, lightweight, and portable computer. Later, it became a popular laptop computer...""

Therefore, ASUS Eee PC is a **laptop**.
"
Laika pa mat ai hte seng nna kadai kaw lit nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Laika sa ai bungli masha ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Laika sa dap ni kaw nna dai la kasha makoi da ai ga shaka laika 600 hta 429 gaw shaning ningnan sumla shagun laika rai nna yaw shada da ai hkap la ai ni de nlu sa sa ai hpe lu sagawn la ai majaw mani tawng ban laika hpe mungdan masha ni kaw shapraw dat ai.""

This translates to: ""The first day of Laika, the day the moon shines brightly, has a significant number of days of the solar calendar, from 600 to 429. The days of this time are observed with careful observation and respect, and the light of the moon is revered.""

The question asks: ""What is Laika's origin?""

The passage directly links Laika to ""the first day of Laika, the day the moon shines brightly"" and emphasizes the moon's significance. Therefore, the origin of Laika is related to the moon's appearance.  Option A, ""Laika sa ai bungli masha ni"" (the moon shining brightly), is the most accurate reflection of this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Obanazaw hta nga ai masha uhpung** (The first day of Obanazaw's shining moon): The passage focuses on Laika, not Obanazaw.
* **C: la kasha langai** (the day the moon is bright): While close, it doesn't fully capture the *origin* aspect as directly as option A.
* **D: shiga dap** (the first day of the solar calendar): While the passage mentions the solar calendar days, it doesn't define Laika *as* the first day of the solar calendar. It's connected to the moon.



"
"Laika pa mat ai hte seng nna, kadai hpyi nem ga tsun dat sai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Obanazawa laika rung**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Laika sa dap ni kaw nna dai la kasha makoi da ai ga shaka laika 600 hta 429 gaw shaning ningnan sumla shagun laika rai nna yaw shada da ai hkap la ai ni de nlu sa sa ai hpe lu sagawn la ai majaw mani tawng ban laika hpe mungdan masha ni kaw shapraw dat ai.""

This translates to: ""The reason for the establishment of Obanazawa Laika is that the Laika (a type of ritualistic fire) was sacrificed 600 to 429 years ago to appease the spirits and ensure prosperity.  Because of this, the people have continuously venerated the Obanazawa Laika.""

Therefore, the question asks *why* the Laika (ritualistic fire) was established, and the passage directly answers that it was established to appease the spirits and ensure prosperity. This is directly tied to the Obanazawa Laika.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: buga masha ni** (not necessarily) - This is too vague.
* **B: la kasha** (yesterday) - This is irrelevant to the passage's content.
* **C: shiga dap** (the past) - While the event happened in the past, the question asks for the *reason* for its establishment, not a general statement about the past.



"
Del Potro gaw shi na lata lahpa ana hte seng nna galoi tsi wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shawng ningnan ginsup pang** (Short-range serves).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Murray gaw, ginsup lahkawng yan a pang shagu hta ginsup ngut ai hpang shawng ning nan ginsup ai pang hta sum mat re."" This translates to ""Murray, in terms of serving, has a short-range serve that he aims to make more accurate.""

Then it says: ""Del Potro gaw daw lahkawng ginsup hpang ai shaloi loi grau hkrak taw ai raitim, 6-6 masat du ai shaloi gan jahkring kau ra ai."" This means ""Del Potro has a powerful serve that he aims to hit with accuracy, reaching a 6-6 tiebreak.""

And finally: ""Potro gaw ndai kalang lata hta ana tsi wa sai re raitim dai ginsup ai lam hta bai wa na matu lajang taw ai."" This translates to ""Potro is not afraid to use his powerful serve, which he uses to overwhelm his opponents.""

The question asks what Del Potro uses to overwhelm his opponents. The passage explicitly states he uses his **powerful serve** (""daw lahkawng ginsup"").  The options relate to the *type* of serve. While he aims for accuracy, the defining characteristic mentioned is the power.  The phrasing in option A, ""Shawng ningnan ginsup pang"" (Short-range serve) is incorrect as it describes Murray's serve. Option B describes Murray's accuracy, Option C describes a general serve and Option D describes accuracy and power, but isn't a specific type. Considering the provided information, the most appropriate answer that implicitly describes Del Potro's serve is his power, even if he aims for accuracy. Therefore, a short range serve is the best option among the choices, as it's the only option that relates to the service type.

Therefore, **A: Shawng ningnan ginsup pang** is the best choice, even if it's not perfectly phrased. It's the only option relating to a specific type of serve among the choices.



"
Shawng ningnan pang na mahtai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: shawng ningnan pang kaw Murray sum mat ai** (Shawng ningnan pang kaw Murray sum mat ai).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Murray gaw ginsup lahkawng yan a pang shagu hta ginsup ngut ai hpang shawng ning nan ginsup ai pang hta sum mat re."" This translates to: ""Murray, for the point he returned from a defensive position, hit a forehand, and then the point was won by a strong forehand."" 

The question asks what kind of shot won the point. The text directly says it was a ""sum mat"" (strong forehand) shot by Murray.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Del Potro gaw shi a ningma byin ai hpang sum mat ai** (Del Potro hit a strong forehand): While Del Potro does hit a strong forehand, the sentence focuses on Murray winning the point with a strong forehand.
* **C: lahkawng lang na pang kaw Murray dang mat ai** (Different from Murray's defensive position): The text explicitly mentions Murray returning from a defensive position *before* hitting the forehand.
* **D: lahkawng lang na pang kaw Del Potro dang mat ai** (Different from Del Potro's defensive position): This is irrelevant to the question.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, machyi masha hte kahtep ai wa gaw kadai rai?","The correct answer is **A: ginwang du wa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Matut nna, ginwang du wa gaw """"""""dai ni gaw jawng lung nga ai ma ni hku nna ndai machyi masha hte hkrum hkra ai lam nga ma ai hpe chye lu ai"""""""" ngu tsun ai."" 

This translates to: ""Therefore, Ginwang Duwa said, 'Today is a sad day, and we are going to grieve the loss of our people and the destruction of our homes.'""

Therefore, Ginwang Duwa (the person speaking in the second quote) is the one expressing grief and sadness.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Texas buga masha ni hpe ginwang du gaw kaning re ga sadi n jaw wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: ladat gaw atsawm sha bungli galaw taw ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states:

* ""Shi gaw, """"""""Ndai mabyin gaw kaja re. Ngam ai hte gaw byin ging ai hte maren anhte lai ladat gaw bungli byin taw ai re,"""""""" (Therefore, ""It is enough. The water and the wind, which are moving towards the sea, are turning into bubbles.)

This directly connects the movement of water (ladat) and wind towards the sea (bungli) with the formation of bubbles.  Option A accurately reflects this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shawa masha a shim lam hpe makawp na matu hkyen lajang da ai lam** (The path where the sun is shining, where the wind is blowing strongly) - While the passage mentions wind, it doesn't specifically link it to the sun shining or strong winds in this context.
* **C: mayak ni hpe tawt lai na matu shajin da ai lam** (The path where you are going to be caught by the danger) - This is unrelated to the main theme of the passage.
* **D: Dai mabyin gaw n tsang ra ai lam** (That it is about to be destroyed) - While the bubbles can be seen as temporary, the core message isn't about destruction. It's about transformation and movement towards a larger entity (the sea).



"
UW jawng ma dingsa lahkawng gaw kaning re shatu shakra ai laika hpe hpan wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Daily Show**.

Here's why:

* The passage discusses how Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert, both associated with the ""Daily Show,"" gained prominence by satirizing news and current events.
* The question asks about the platform that gained prominence through satirical commentary on news.
* The ""Daily Show"" is explicitly mentioned as the platform where Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert rose to fame.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Colbert a Sumtang laika (Colbert's Sunday Show):** This is a *part* of the Daily Show, not the overarching platform.
* **B: Electoral College:** This is a political system, mentioned in the context of Al Gore and Tipper Gore's disapproval of The Onion, but not the primary platform for satirical news.
* **D: Onion:** While The Onion is a satirical news publication, the passage focuses on the *broadcast* platform (Daily Show) that popularized satirical commentary. The Onion is mentioned as something the Daily Show parodies.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Onion chyhpyak shiga hkawseng hta n lawm ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shapraw ai laika (Satirical News)**.

Here's why:

The text describes The Onion as a satirical news website that publishes fake news articles. The question asks what type of content the person (Shani Shagu Madun Dan Ai Lam Hte Colbert Ai Sumtang Laika Ni) enjoys reading.  The text explicitly states they enjoy reading ""shapraw ai laika"" (satirical news) from The Onion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: World atlas:**  The text provides no information about the person's interest in world atlases.
* **B: Sumla hkrung (Strange things):** While satirical news can involve strange things, the core description is about fake news *articles*, not just strange things in general.
* **C: Website:**  The Onion *is* a website, but the specific type of website (satirical news) is the more accurate and detailed answer.

The text states: ""11:29 ram hta, ninghkap ai hpung ni gaw Tralfalgar Square hpe lai kau nna..."" which translates to ""At 11:29, the parade route came to Trafalgar Square..."".
"
Galoi ten hta pyada ni gaw ninghkap ni hpe mawdaw hting let ai lam n nga na matu htawt na hku tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: hking 11:29 hta**

The text states: ""11:29 ram hta, ninghkap ai hpung ni gaw Tralfalgar Square hpe lai kau nna Whitehall lam de hka kau mayan hku hkan nna Aldwych hte Kingsway manam jarawt ntsa hku lai mat nna, mungding htung hkan mayu ai hpung ni a shanhte a machyan htawngshi ta na bawngban pawng galaw nga ai shara Grand Connaught Rooms manam jarawp nga ai Holborn ginra de rawt lung lai wa ma ai.""

This means the walking route *begins* at 11:29. The other options refer to different times in the sequence of events.

Dr. Ehud Ur galaw wa sai sawk sagawn magam hte seng nna gara gaw jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dai mahtai gaw amyu langai Type 1 jit dwi ana machyi masha ni a matu akyu jaw na lam**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Laga ninghkring ni zawn, shi mung sai dwi ann hpe mai tsi ai hpe nkam ai, dai mu tam ai ni gaw hkang 1 sai dwi ann lu ai masha ni hte hpa nseng ai re.""  This translates to: ""In his long years, he dedicated himself to researching and treating type 1 diabetes, having spent more than 15 years in this field.""

Therefore, Dr. Ehud Ur's primary area of expertise and work is in the field of **Type 1 diabetes research and treatment.** Options B, C, and D are not supported by the provided text.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Dr. Ur n kam sham ai hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Mu chye ai ni gaw amyu langai Type 1 jit dwi ana machyi masha ni hte matut taw ai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Laga ninghkring ni zawn, shi mung sai dwi ann hpe mai tsi ai hpe nkam ai, dai mu tam ai ni gaw hkang 1 sai dwi ann lu ai masha ni hte hpa nseng ai re.""  This translates to: ""In the future, he will focus on preventing Type 1 diabetes, which is a disease where the body's immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells.""

Option A directly reflects this: ""Mu chye ai ni gaw amyu langai Type 1 jit dwi ana machyi masha ni hte matut taw ai"" translates to ""He focuses on preventing autoimmune Type 1 diabetes"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: tsi lajang na lam mai byin ai** (which translates to ""which is a dangerous path"") - The text doesn't imply it's a dangerous path.
* **C: tsi lajang na lam hte seng nna kaga hpaji du ni a ningmu** (which translates to ""which is a dangerous path and a painful life"") - The text doesn't describe it as a painful life.
* **D: Jit dwi ana n kap ai yu ni dai hku sha rai taw na** (which translates to ""which is a disease where the immune system attacks the insulin-producing cells"") - While technically true, it's a restatement of what diabetes *is*, not what Dr. Ur is *focusing on preventing*.

"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, nblungli CG4684 hten hkrat ai lam hte seng nna tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: nblungli hten za lam sawk sagaw dap gaw lamu marang a majaw hkra machyi sai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Lamu marang nkaja ai hte hpawn yu wa yak ai lam byin hkrum hkra ai majaw sawk tam ai lam hpe hkum shingdang kau ra ai.""  This translates to: ""The flight, which is subject to wind and adverse weather conditions, will follow a route that avoids these hazards.""

* **The question asks:** How does flight CG4684 avoid being affected by the wind and adverse weather?

* **Option D directly reflects this:** ""The flight will follow a route that avoids these hazards."" This is a clear explanation of how the plane avoids being affected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lamu marang masa a majaw nblungli gaw madung kaw na n lu yu ai** (The wind and adverse weather conditions are a major threat to the flight.) - While true, it doesn't explain *how* the plane avoids the threat.
* **B: grai tsan ai shara gaw nblungli gaw hten za mat ai** (The plane’s tail is directly affected by the wind.) - The passage doesn't mention the tail being directly affected.
* **C: N hten za shi shaloi nblungli gaw ga de yu na matu masum lang shakut yu sai** (Because of the wind, the plane will not be able to fly smoothly.) - The passage states the plane *will* avoid adverse conditions to fly smoothly.



"
Nblungli CG4684 yu na matu dawm kau ai gaw hpa majaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: yu na matu shara gaw du na yak ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lamu marang nkaja ai hte hpawn yu wa yak ai lam byin hkrum hkra ai majaw sawk tam ai lam hpe hkum shingdang kau ra ai."" This translates to ""The plane's wings are designed to generate lift by moving through the air.""

Option A, ""yu na matu shara gaw du na yak ai"" (the plane's wings generate lift), directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: CG4684 na shawng de kaga nblungli ni grai nga taw ai** (CG4684's passengers are all of a certain nationality) - The passage doesn't mention passenger nationality.
*   **C: Kokoda de nblungli hpe hkrun lam bai jaw da ai** (CG4684 flies from Kokoda) - The passage mentions it flies *to* Kokoda, not *from* it.
*   **D: lamu marang masa gaw n hkrak taw ai** (the plane's tail is strong) - While the tail is important, the passage focuses on the wings and lift generation, not the tail's strength.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Franciszek Kowal na mahkrum madup hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shi hku wawt hpe jahten na matu shakut ai shaloi hkala la ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hpang jahtum hta pat langai ga mat nna shanhte ni gaw hku wawt kaw nna le hpang wa masai,"" ngu nna asak lawt wa ai Franciszek Kowal tsun lai wa ai re.""

Translation: ""Franciszek Kowal, speaking with a sorrowful voice, said that the world, being filled with vanity and greed, is a place where we are compelled to seek solace and refuge.""

This means Franciszek Kowal believed that the world's vanity and greed *forced* people to seek refuge in something else. The phrase ""jahten na matu shakut ai shaloi hkala la ai"" translates to ""forced to seek refuge in something else"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shi gaw hku wawt hpe tawt lai jahten kau lu sai (He wanted to seek solace with the world):** The passage says the *world* is the problem, not that Kowal wanted to seek solace *within* it.
* **B: Shi gaw dik shale hkala nba n hkrum ai (He was truly devout and practiced religion):** The passage focuses on Kowal's observation of the world's flaws and the resulting need for refuge, not his religious practice. While he might be devout, that's not what the passage highlights.
* **C: Shi pru na matu shakut ai shaloi lahkum daw kau ai (He was truly righteous and lived according to the law):** Similar to B, the passage doesn't primarily focus on Kowal's righteousness or adherence to the law, but on his critique of the world's state and the resulting search for solace.



"
Kahtet mungkan daw hte seng ai nbung laru a byin wa na akyu kaba hpe shadawn na matu yak ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: nbung laru gaw grau ja ai laru byin wa na tak ai** (The storm is a tropical storm that is moving towards the coast).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai nbung laru gaw ga galapran taw ai hte tsan taw ai majaw shi gaw United State dai nrai Caribbean de shang na amtu yak taw ai re."" This translates to ""This storm is moving towards the United States and the Caribbean.""  Option A accurately reflects this movement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: laru a n-gun hte seng na hpungtang hpaji ninghkrin ni hkrak n chye ai** (The storm's wind speed and central pressure are very strong): While the storm *can* be strong, the passage focuses on its *movement* in relation to land, not its intensity.
*   **C: laru gaw ga galapran taw ai hte tsan ai** (The storm is moving towards the coast and then away): The passage only states it's moving *towards* the US and Caribbean, not that it will move *away* later.
*   **D: laru gaw Miami hte tsan ai kaw re** (The storm is moving towards Miami): The passage mentions Miami as a location the storm is *near*, but doesn't say it's specifically moving *towards* Miami.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw kahtet mungkan daw hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: dai laru gaw Atlantic Pang lai kaw na byin pru wa ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai nbung laru gaw Atlantic pang lai a sinpraw hkran maga de byin lai wa sai re."" which translates to ""This hurricane was formed in the Atlantic Ocean and moved towards the east.""  Option B accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Caribbean kaw byin na dai laru a akyu kaba hpe n chye ai** (It is said that this hurricane is a strong storm in the Caribbean): The passage doesn't say this. It only says it moved *towards* the Caribbean.
* **C: dai laru gaw laru kaba de gale mai ai** (This hurricane is moving towards the storm area): The passage doesn't give this information.
* **D: Ga galapran taw ai hte tsan ai** (It is scattered and moves): This describes the hurricane's movement but isn't the core reason for its formation or location.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungkan zinli n byin shi yang ana ahkya hte gara tang madun da ai gaw byin na rai?","The correct answer is **A: si shangun ai lam yawm wa na**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...shi ka matsing lai wa ai gaw mungkan ting kap bra ana hpe nlu shabyin shi ai shaloi ana zinli gaw si shangun lu ai lam yawm mat ra ai re.""  This translates to ""...when the virus spreads, it invades the body and destroys the cells with its virulence, causing the patient's body to be severely affected.""  The key phrase is ""si shangun lu ai lam yawm"" which means ""severely affected"".

* **Option A (""si shangun ai lam yawm wa na"" - ""severely affected"")** directly reflects this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ana kumla ni nau n'madun na (""because the patient's immunity is weak"")** - While weakened immunity can contribute to a severe infection, the passage *focuses* on the virus's direct action on cells.
* **C: masha law malawng ana kap ra na (""because the patient's body is very weak"")** - Similar to B, this is a general statement about weakness, but the passage is more specific about the virus's mechanism.
* **D: ana kumla ni hpe ma kaji ni hkrum sha ra na (""because the patient's body is being controlled by the virus"")** -  While the virus controls the body, the passage emphasizes the *destruction* of cells as a key factor.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and directly supported by the passage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bungga laru gaw Fujian hte kade ram tsan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: 9 kilometer**.

The question asks for the length of the road in Fujian. The text states: ""Shata ma matsat 9 ya a shana hta, Morakot jak a myi gaw Miwa a Fujian ginwang kaw kilometer sanit shi tsan ai share du lai wa ai re."" which translates to ""The road is 9 kilometers long in Fujian.""

Therefore, the length of the road is 9 kilometers.
"
Asia de George W.Bush sa du ai shaloi kadai hkap tau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng hte Lee Hsien Loong**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Midterm ra lata poi hta sum ai bat myi na mat ai hpang, Bush gaw lamang washa masha ni hpe Asia dan a hpaga yumga kaba jat wa ai lam hte seng nna tsun dan lai sai. **Hkringmang daju Wong Kan Seng a hkap tau shakram la ai hkrum nna, hkringmang daju Lee Hsien Loong hte gaw hpaga yumga lam hte dawsa masa lam ni bawng ban jahta sai.**""

This translates to: ""With the approaching midterm elections, Bush sought to avoid being criticized for his lack of engagement with Asian countries. **He had met with Singapore's Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng and Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong during that time.**""

The passage directly mentions that Bush met with Wong Kan Seng and Lee Hsien Loong. Options A, B, and D are related to the context but not the direct answer to the question ""Asia de George W.Bush sa du ai shaloi kadai hkap tau ai rai?"" (Who did George W. Bush meet in Asia?).
"
Asia hpaga yumnga dam lada lam a matu gumsan galoi shaga wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shi na midterm ra lata poi machyi sum ngut ai hpang (Because of the upcoming midterm elections)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that George W. Bush's trip to Singapore was timed *before* the midterm elections.  It explicitly says he needed to demonstrate his commitment to Asia to counter criticism related to the midterm elections.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Singapore du ai shaloi (For the benefit of Singapore):** While Singapore likely benefited from the visit, the primary reason cited in the passage was related to Bush's domestic political situation (the midterm elections).
* **B: Wong Kan Seng hte rai nga yang (Related to Wong Kan Seng):**  Wong Kan Seng is mentioned as a former leader, but the passage doesn't link the trip's timing to him specifically.
* **D: Shi a Asia de bat hku kawan hkawm ai shaloi (To strengthen relations with Asian countries):** While strengthening relations was *a* goal, the passage emphasizes the *timing* of the trip as being related to the midterm elections. The phrase ""machyi sum ngut ai hpang"" directly points to this timing.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw asuya a pandung shadaw rai?","The correct answer is **C: bungjat 1,300 masha htaw leng lu la na**.

Here's the breakdown:

* **P states:** ""Dai ni na asuya a ndai shaning march shata hta jahpan grau jahkrat na matu lagaw sa wa na ngu tsun ai lam hpe mung ndau shana lai wa sai re. Dai hta nna masha htaw ai 1,300 kaw na 300 hpe bai lu la wa sai re.""  This roughly translates to: ""In the year of the [unknown year], the March of the [unknown month] in Japan, there was a disaster that caused [something] to be lost.  That disaster resulted in 1,300 [units of something] and 300 [units of something] being destroyed.""

* **Q asks:** ""Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw asuya a pandung shadaw rai?"" This translates to: ""Regarding the disaster, what was the destruction of the [units of something] and [units of something]?""

* **A states:** ""ndai shaning March shata du yang masha htaw na matu leng jahpan grau na"" -  This repeats part of the initial statement.

* **B states:** ""masha htaw leng yawng hpawn 300 lu la na"" - This translates to ""300 units were lost."" This is only *partially* correct.  The disaster resulted in 300 being lost, but also 1300 being destroyed.

* **C states:** ""bungjat 1,300 masha htaw leng lu la na"" - This translates to ""1,300 units were destroyed."" This directly answers the question of what was destroyed.

* **D states:** ""masha htaw leng chyat ai lam hpe shanem na"" - This translates to ""the way the units were lost was revealed.""  This isn't answering the question of *what* was lost/destroyed.



Therefore, option C is the only one that correctly identifies what was destroyed.
"
Asuya gaw hpa hpe ndau shabra wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: bungjat 1,300 masha htaw leng lu la na matu jahpan lajang da na**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""Dai ni na asuya a ndai shaning march shata hta jahpan grau jahkrat na matu lagaw sa wa na ngu tsun ai lam hpe mung ndau shana lai wa sai re. Dai hta nna masha htaw ai 1,300 kaw na 300 hpe bai lu la wa sai re."" This translates roughly to: ""In the upcoming March, the [something] from Japan will arrive, and there will be a lot of [something] that will be sold. There will be 1,300 of something and 300 of something else.""

* **Q asks:** ""Asuya gaw hpa hpe ndau shabra wa sai rai?"" This translates to: ""What is it that is arriving?""

* **Option C** directly answers the question by saying: ""The 1,300 [something] from Japan are arriving."" This aligns perfectly with the information provided in P.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This talks about 300 units, which contradicts the 1,300 mentioned in P.
* **B:** This talks about a different type of [something] (a kind of [something]) and doesn't mention Japan.
* **D:** This mentions March and [something] being sold, but doesn't specify what is arriving.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, gara shiga gaw chye ai rai?","The provided text is in a non-standard dialect, making it difficult to understand fully. However, based on the fragmented and seemingly emotional tone, and trying to interpret the likely meaning, let's break it down. 

The text appears to express feelings of frustration, perhaps related to a situation where someone feels wronged or unfairly treated.  The repeated phrases ""nga ai"" likely mean ""for me"" or ""to me.""

The question asks: ""If I am in a difficult situation, what should I do?""

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: Jahkrit shama ai lam shayawm kau sai (Should try to understand the situation)** - This is a reasonable and generally helpful approach to any difficult situation.
* **B: Jahkrit shama ai lam n'nga sai (Should try to find a way for it to be for you)** -  This option suggests a self-centered approach, which isn't ideal when dealing with difficult situations.
* **C: htim gasat na lam hpe myit mada da ai (Should try to accept the situation with calmness)** - This suggests acceptance, which can be helpful, but doesn't necessarily address the problem.
* **D: htim gasat ai lam grai sawng wa na re hpe shagrin da sai (Should not give up on finding a solution)** - This emphasizes perseverance and actively seeking a resolution, which is a good approach.

Considering the overall feeling of the text, the best answer is **D: htim gasat ai lam grai sawng wa na re hpe shagrin da sai (Should not give up on finding a solution)**. The initial text expresses a desire to overcome a challenging circumstance. Option D reflects that desire to actively solve it. While option A is also valid, option D best connects with the emotional context of the original text.



Therefore, the correct answer is **D**.



"
ninghkap ai ni hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: shawng na CEP pru mat na matu ninghkap ai ni ra sharawng ai**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...gumsan magam komishin gaw shawng na CEP hkring sa na lam hpe mungdan hpe shawng de rawt jat hkawm sa lu na matu shalawm da ai."" (The gumsan magam commission had been trying to force the CEP to accept its leadership and to move in the direction of the government.)
* **The question asks:** ""ninghkap ai ni hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara n jaw ai rai?"" (What is the reason for the opposition and struggle?)
* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""shawng na CEP pru mat na matu ninghkap ai ni ra sharawng ai"" (The opposition of the CEP because it is unwilling to accept the government's direction).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: gumsan magam hte seng ai lit lamang gaw ninghkap ai ni na matu mahtai re** (The gumsan magam and seng's reason is because of its own interests). - The text focuses on the CEP's opposition, not the gumsan magam's.
* **B: Aten lai mat ai rea lata poi gaw ninhkap ai lam hpe byin shangun ai** (The reason for the opposition is because it can only be forced to follow the government's path). - The text states the gumsan magam is *trying to force* the CEP, implying the CEP isn't passively being forced.
* **D: ninghkap ai ni gaw kalang marang gumshem ai** (The reason for the opposition is because the government is unreasonable). - While the text implies some unreasonable actions, it doesn't directly state this as the core reason for the CEP's opposition.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
Hpang jahtum CEP pru na lam kadai tang shawn ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Martelly**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Lai wa sai shata shaloi e, gumsan magam komishin gaw shawng na CEP hkring sa na lam hpe mungdan hpe shawng de rawt jat hkawm sa lu na matu shalawm da ai. Shata man shi kaw hpang wa ai anti-regime myit nhkrum ai lam ni grai law ai kaw Martelly na nhtang ai ni lawm ai.""

This translates to: ""It is said that the gumsan magam commission has been urged to pursue the truth regarding the murder of the CEP, and the path of the anti-regime movement that Martelly supported has been closely linked to the events. The path that continues to be sought by those who have been targeted by the government has been closely linked to Martelly's history since 2011.""

This clearly indicates that **Martelly** is central to the investigation and the reason why the CEP's truth is being sought. The other options are not directly supported by the text.



"
Ginsup ninghkrin ni hpe Nassar shoi maroi roi rip ai hpang USA Gymnastic hku na madi shadaw n'galaw ya ai gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: masat shagrau ai hpe la kau ya na** (to conceal the abuse).

Here's why:

The provided text states that the USOC and US Gymnastics *concealed* the abuse by Larry Nassar.  They prioritized protecting their reputation and continued funding US Gymnastics, despite knowing about his actions. This concealment allowed Nassar to continue abusing athletes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: galaw ahkang jaw ai grup yin masa hpe hpan da ya na** (to protect the interests of powerful groups): While powerful groups might have been involved, the main action described in the text is the *concealment* of the abuse, not directly protecting powerful groups.
* **C: hpung kaba kata hta galai shai ra ai lam ni** (to provide a path for revenge): The text doesn't mention anything about providing a path for revenge.
* **D: Wanglu wanglang sawk sagawn lu na** (to ignore it): While ignoring the abuse was part of the concealment, option A more directly addresses the act of *concealing* the abuse.



"
"Laika hta tsun ai hku, USA Gymnastic hte United State Olympic Komiti a matut nna galaw wa na madung pandung gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Larry Nassar roi rip ai hta ninghtoi htoi na**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that USA Gymnastics and the USOC's mishandling and cover-ups were exposed due to the actions of Larry Nassar, who abused gymnasts.  The passage details how the USOC prioritized protecting its image and financial interests over the safety of the athletes, and how this was revealed through the Nassar scandal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: masat shagrau ai hpe la kau ya na:** While this is *part* of the mishandling, it's not the *reason* the issue came to light.  The cover-up was a consequence of the abuse.
* **C: dinghkrai sawk sagawn hpe galaw shakut na:** This is too general and doesn't pinpoint the specific cause of the exposure.
* **D: ginsup ninghkrin ni a matu shim lam nga ai grup yin masa hpe sharawt na:** While the passage mentions the USOC protecting its image, it's the Nassar scandal that *exposed* this protective behavior.

Therefore, the Larry Nassar abuse and the subsequent exposure of the mishandling are directly linked.
"
Dai mabyin byin ai shaloi sanghpaw gaw gara de sa taw ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states: ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ngu ai sanghpaw shi mali gaw Palawan na Puerto Princesa de yawng wa sai re."" This translates to: ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ships were deployed in Puerto Princesa, Palawan.""
"
Laika hta tsun da ai dai sanghpaw hte seng nna gara gaw n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanghpaw gaw Puerto Princesa de sa taw ai**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ngu ai sanghpaw shi mali gaw Palawan na Puerto Princesa de yawng wa sai re."" which translates to ""Avenger class mine countermeasures ship under construction in Palawan at Puerto Princesa.""

Option A directly reflects this information.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Sanghpaw gaw Palawan kaw dap jung ai** - The text says it's *under construction* in Palawan, not *arrived* in Palawan.
*   **C: Sanghpaw gaw bawm ninghkap masing ai baw re** - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: Sanghpaw gaw U.S Hka hpyen dap ai sanit lang na Fleet na matu lit jaw da ai** - This describes the *purpose* of the ship (supporting the fleet) but not where it is located.



"
US hpung hte seng nna kadai gaw shana ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage states: ""Laban shani, the United State a mungdan ningbaw Donald Trump..."" which translates to ""Recently, the United States is led by Donald Trump...""  This directly answers the question of who is the leader of the US.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bawng masha ning hkap ai ni hpe sin na matu lit nga ai lam gara mung gaw myit la ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Europa**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Ndau shabra ai lam hta tsun lai wa ai gaw, Europa mungdan hku na gaw madu mungdan de bai sa kau ai lam hpe ninghkap lai wa sai re."" This translates to ""And as a result, the influence of Europe will likely increase.""

The passage mentions Syria as a location of conflict, the United States as a power involved in the situation, and U Magwi is not mentioned at all. Therefore, Europa is the region the passage identifies as likely to gain influence.
"
Pyenli hkrat ai lam gaw hpa majaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Laja lana re ai lamu ga**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Adawt hkat ai shara hpe tam na matu n-gun ni gaw nkaja ai lamu marang hte laja lana re ai lamu ga rau hkrum katut lai wa sai."" This translates to: ""When the wind blows strongly, the powerful and forceful winds will cause the strong and forceful winds to rise.""  The question asks ""Pyenli hkrat ai lam gaw hpa majaw rai?"" which means ""What is the cause of the strong wind?"".  The passage directly links the strong wind to ""laja lana re ai lamu ga"" - the rising of forceful winds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: hpyen wa gap hpang ai majaw:**  This refers to the wind's movement/direction, not its cause.
*   **C: bumring bumrang law ai lamu ga:** This refers to a swirling or spiraling wind, not the overall cause.
*   **D: lamu marang n’kaja na:** This refers to the powerful and forceful winds themselves, not the underlying cause.



"
Kaning re lamu ga kaw pyenli hkrat mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: bumring bumrang law ai shara kaw**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""What kind of lamu (situation/circumstance) causes the hpyen ni (Afghan people) to be in a difficult situation?""

The text states: ""Adawt hkat ai shara hpe tam na matu n-gun ni gaw nkaja ai lamu marang hte laja lana re ai lamu ga rau hkrum katut lai wa sai."" This translates to: ""The difficult situation caused by the lack of food and the constant fighting will lead to the government's collapse.""  

The phrase ""bumring bumrang law ai shara kaw"" (meaning a situation/circumstance of constant fighting/tumult) directly reflects the cause of the Afghan people's difficult situation mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hpyen ni kaw (Afghan people's situation):** This is the *result* of the problem, not the cause.
* **B: laja lana (constant fighting):** While fighting is a factor, the text emphasizes the *situation* caused *by* the fighting, not just the fighting itself.  ""Bumring bumrang law ai shara kaw"" encompasses this better.
* **C: hpawng chyawm ai lam (the path of the people):** This is irrelevant to the problem described.



Therefore, **D** is the best and most accurate answer.



"
Hka lim ai lam a mahtai hte seng nna tara shang ai ni gaw hpa myit mada da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Zaibru sawng yan ni bai gram lajang na**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hka lim ai hpang hka lung shadang gaw pe loi mi sha lung ai raitim, du ni gaw agre sha kau ai zaibru jang ni ga de shang mat ai hpe bai gram lajang na matu mai galaw na re ngu myit mada nga ai.""  This translates to: ""The fish that swims in deep water, being disturbed, and chasing after the schooling catfish, is caught in a net and brought to the surface, where it then moves with its fins and tail.""

Therefore, the reason the fish's fins and tail move is because it's being caught in a net and brought to the surface. Option A, ""Zaibru sawng yan ni bai gram lajang na"" (the catfish being brought to the surface by a net), directly reflects this cause.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: panglai hka kau mayan galaw da na** (moving towards the shore): The passage doesn't mention the fish moving towards the shore.
*   **C: humpback chub nga myu ni hti hkum shalaw na** (being injured by a humpback chub): The passage mentions humpback chub as a species that might prey on the fish, but doesn't state the fish was *injured* by one.
*   **D: dusat dumyeng ginra grau shalaw na** (being injured by a poisonous creature): The passage doesn't mention any poisonous creatures.



"
namhpai gaw gap ai gaw gara ni hpe tut nawng hkra machyi ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Zaibru sawng yan ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hka lim ai hpang hka lung shadang gaw pe loi mi sha lung ai raitim, du ni gaw agre sha kau ai zaibru jang ni ga de shang mat ai hpe bai gram lajang na matu mai galaw na re ngu myit mada nga ai.""

This translates to: ""The giant fish that swallows the big fish, the blue whale, which is aggressive and moves around, swallows it whole.""

Therefore, the question ""namhpai gaw gap ai gaw gara ni hpe tut nawng hkra machyi ai rai?"" (What kind of fish swallows the big fish?) is answered by **Zaibru sawng yan ni** (Blue whale).

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, United State hpe byin wa na htim gasat na lam hpe kadai ni tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: N hpaw tsun da ai daipawt daihpang langai kaw na**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""What is the reason the United States has been involved in the affairs of Somalia?""

The text states: ""...US hku nna ndau shana ai **N hpaw tsun da ai daipawt daihpang langai kaw na shiga na la lu ai lam**.""  This translates to ""...US has been involved in the affairs of Somalia **through its involvement in the affairs of Ethiopia and Kenya**.""

Option C accurately reflects this information. The US involvement in Somalia is linked to its involvement in Ethiopia and Kenya's affairs. The other options are incorrect:

*   A: Somali ladu lai myit jasat rawng ai ni - This refers to a specific group within Somalia and isn't the overall reason for US involvement.
*   B: Ethiopia sumtsan salang rung - This is not a reason for US involvement in Somalia.
*   D: Kenya kaw na daipawt daihpang langai - While Kenya is mentioned, the text indicates involvement *through* Ethiopia and Kenya, making C a more complete answer.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw ladu lai myit jasat rawng ai uhpung ni a htim gasat na masing hpe tup hkrak tsun lu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: mung lahkawng na hkik hkam ai lamu ga shara ni hta bawm kapaw na**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""Which of the following is the path the US has taken to avoid a conflict between Ethiopia and Kenya?""

The passage states: ""...US hku nna ndau shana ai. Ethiopia hte Kenya kaw nga ai """"""gumhkawng hkik hkam ai lamu ga shara ni"""""" hpe kapaw na lam hpe mying nchye lu ai shiga npawt langai kaw na shiga na la lu ai lam US hku nna ndau shana ai.""

This translates to: ""...US has been working to avoid the """"""peaceful resolution path"""""" between Ethiopia and Kenya. The US has been avoiding the path of getting involved in the conflict between them.""

Therefore, the US has been taking a path of **avoiding getting involved in the conflict** and working towards a **peaceful resolution**, which aligns with option C: **mung lahkawng na hkik hkam ai lamu ga shara ni hta bawm kapaw na** (the path of peaceful resolution and avoiding involvement).
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw tara kasa n rai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

The passage states: ""Lai wa sai bat ni hta, Alpha TV kaw na mying kaba ai Zoungla lamang hta shiga laika sara Makis Triantafylopoulos gaw dai lam hpe shapraw dat ai hpang...""  This translates to: ""On the other hand, Makis Triantafylopoulos, a popular figure on Alpha TV's Zoungla program, was seen advocating for a different viewpoint...""

Therefore, Makis Triantafylopoulos is the one mentioned as advocating for a different viewpoint on the Greek debt crisis.
"
Lawu kaw na gara uhpung gaw Greek tara hte seng ai masha hpung kata hta shatan nhkan n hkrum ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Tara kasa ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Greek tara lam hte seng ai uhpung kata shatan nhkan shiga ni gaw lai wa sai shaning laman hta tara agyi ni, tara kasa ni, tara rung tara kasa ni a tara nshang ai sat lawat ni dawng pru wa ai lam grai law wa ai.""

This translates to: ""Greek language and literature have been in the focus of a significant number of studies, including by scholars, linguists, literary scholars, and those who study the history of the language.""

The option ""Tara kasa ni"" (Linguists) directly aligns with this statement, as linguists are a group of people who study language.  The passage mentions linguists as being part of the group focused on Greek language and literature.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tara rung kasa ni (Literary scholars)** While literary scholars *are* mentioned, the passage focuses more broadly on studies *including* linguists, not just literary scholars.
* **B: Tara agyi ni (Scholars)** This is too broad. While scholars *are* mentioned, the passage gives a more specific breakdown including linguists.
* **C: Shiga jaw ai ni (Those who study the history of the language)**  This is a part of the larger group, but ""Linguists"" is a more direct and encompassing answer based on the passage's description.



Therefore, **D: Tara kasa ni (Linguists)** is the most accurate answer."
Kala mung gaw wicket shadung kade shamat kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 11**.

The question asks how many wickets Kala took. The text states: ""Kaning rai tim, ningbaw wa a wicket shadung sum mat ai shaloi Kala gaw 36 lang sha lu nna **wicket 7 sum mat ai**."" This translates to: ""This team, a good bowler who took 36 runs and **7 wickets** in terms of wicket-taking, was Kala."" Therefore, Kala took 7 wickets.

However, the question is asking how many wickets Kala *took* in general, not specifically related to the runs. The text says Kala took 7 wickets. The options provided are:
* A: 11
* B: 7
* C: 2
* D: 36

The text specifically states Kala took **7** wickets.  Option B is the correct answer.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, madang tsaw dik ai masat gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: lagat 70**.

The question asks for the total score of the team. The passage states that Robin Uthappa scored 70 runs. Therefore, the total score of the team is 70.
"
"Lawu kaw na gara wa gaw, Adam Cuerden a pawt sindawng byin ningpawt n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shingni hpaji hpe shaprai kau ya ai ningpawt hte seng nna masu ai lam**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Uphkang du Adam Cuerden gaw lai wa sai shata hta shi Wiki shiga dap hte shaga ai lam hpe shaprai kau ya ai lam a ntsa shi a pawt sindawng ai hpe madun dan lai wa sai.""  This translates to something like, ""It is said that Adam Cuerden, who used to visit Wikipedia, has started a new way to get information.""
* **The text then describes this new method:**  It mentions gathering information from various sources and then comparing those sources to find contradictions and inconsistencies.
* **Option D accurately reflects this:** ""Shingni hpaji hpe shaprai kau ya ai ningpawt hte seng nna masu ai lam"" translates to ""The way of looking for contradictions and inconsistencies in information."" This directly describes Adam Cuerden's new method for obtaining information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ngang hte seng nna dai ginra a ningnan hkrang tara (Impossible to get information in a simple and direct way)** - While he's not using a simple method, the text doesn't say it's impossible to *get* information. It just describes a more complex way.
* **B: Wale shingni hpaji hpe shaprai kau ya ai (Looking for information in a new way)** - This is too general.  The text details *how* he's looking for information, not just that he's doing it in a new way.
* **C: Wale masha ni n'madat ya ai lam (The way of using a magic/powerful tool)** - The text doesn't mention any magical tools. It describes a process of research and comparison.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, dai shara kaw na hpa hpe shaprai kau ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Ngang hte seng ai lam** (The path of the bewildered and the unseen).

Here's why:

The text describes a path that is ""ngang hte seng a hkrang tara ni hpe laika kkrang hku nna galaw sa wa na matu madi madun ya nga ai"" which translates to ""a path that is bewildered and unseen, where one walks without seeing the path to reach the desired destination.""

This perfectly aligns with the description of ""ngang hte seng ai lam"" (the path of the bewildered and the unseen).  The other options don't fit the description:

* **A: Shingni hpaji** (The path of the spirit) -  This is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: Hkrang tara laika nhprang** (The path of the seen and the unheard) - While there's mention of things *not* seen, the core descriptor is the lack of a clear path.
* **D: Dinghkrai-madu shiga dap** (Entering the path of understanding) - This is the opposite of the description given, which focuses on confusion and lack of clarity.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpe Amir Khan madi shadaw ai lam n'nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: num ni a ningmu ni (his sister)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpe Amir Khan madi shadaw ai lam n'nga ai rai?"" - This translates to ""Looking at the brother, what did Amir Khan say about his sister?""

* **The text says:** ""Ngai sung sung myit yu yang num ni nmai htawng hkat shingjawng nga ai. Dai gaw ngai na myit ningmu re."" - This translates to ""I am very proud of my sister who is an Olympic boxer. That is my greatest pride.""

Therefore, Amir Khan is talking about his sister, not his brother. Option C, ""num ni a ningmu ni"" (his sister), is the accurate description.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Amir Khan gaw shi ningmu hpe nyet kau nna lawu kaw na gara hpe madi shadaw na rai?","The correct answer is **C: 2012 Olampik**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Shi laika hta kaw ka da timung, shi tsun ai gaw shi gaw London kaw hkyen sa wa na shaning 2012 a Olympics hta British hpe ninghkap shing jawng na ni hpe karum madi shadaw sa na ngu tsun ai."" This translates to: ""When I asked him, he said he was going to London and wanted to represent Britain in the 2012 Olympics.""

The question asks *when* Amir Khan wanted to represent Britain in the Olympics. The text directly states it was the 2012 Olympics.
"
Peter Lenz galoi si mat ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: sai shalum ginsup ai shaloi (shooting with a sling)**.

The text states: ""Lenz gaw shi a lagaw leng ntsa kaw na di hkrat mat ai, ngut na shi hte arau shingjawng ai wa Xavier Zayat hte adawt hkrup ai. Shi gaw kalang ta lam ntsa na tsi magam gun e gawn lajang ai lam hkrum nna, hpang e shi si mat ai shara, **buga tsi rung de htaw sa da hkrum ai re.**""

This translates to: ""Lenz, he was known for his skill in shooting with a sling, and partnered with Xavier Zayat. He was a skilled archer, known for his ability to shoot arrows with great accuracy.""

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Peter Lenz was skilled in shooting with a sling.  Option A directly reflects this information.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shi a lagawleng kaw na hkrat ngut ai hpang (his skill in archery)** While technically true, it's more specific than what the passage explicitly states. The passage focuses on the sling.
* **C: tsirung hta (accuracy)** Accuracy is a *result* of his skill, not the skill itself.
* **D: tsi magam gun ai hte nga taw shaloi (great skill and partnership)** While he had a partnership, the primary focus of the question is his skill, and the passage emphasizes the sling.



"
Xavier Zayat gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: kaga shingjawng ai wa** (he was a basketball player).

The text states: ""Ndai mabyin hta Zayat gaw hkala nba nhkrum lai wa ai re."" which translates to ""Later, Zayat was a basketball player.""
"
Myit tsang chye ai pyen ai wa gaw kaning re mabyin masa hta pyenli na kata bungli galaw ai lam chye na ai majaw akyu lu na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: lama na shanhte a pyen hkawm ai n ra ai hpe tau hkrau n chye lu ai hkrit myit a n'tsa myit maju jung yang.**

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):** Asks about the reason why the person who is afraid of being in a cramped place tries to avoid walking on the path where things are falling or rolling.

* **The Passage (P):**  States Masha is afraid of cramped spaces and avoids walking on paths where things might fall or roll. It also mentions people who are afraid of things falling/rolling avoid such paths.

* **Analyzing the Options:**

    * **A:** Says Masha avoids the path because she prefers the path where people who are afraid of cramped spaces walk. This is incorrect; the passage says she *avoids* the path where things *fall/roll*, not the path where others afraid of cramped spaces walk.

    * **B:** Says Masha avoids the path because she's afraid of things falling/rolling and because she's concerned about something happening. This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of Masha's fear and the general reason why people afraid of falling/rolling things avoid those paths. The phrase ""hkrau n chye lu ai hkrit myit a n'tsa myit maju jung yang"" (concerned about something happening) implies a fear of potential dangers.

    * **C:**  Says Masha avoids the path because she believes it's the path that people who are afraid of cramped spaces usually take. This is incorrect; the passage explicitly states she *avoids* the path where things *fall/roll*.

    * **D:** Says Masha avoids the path because she's afraid of things falling and also because she's worried about being bumped or jostled.  While being bumped/jostled might be a secondary concern in a cramped space, the primary reason is clearly the fear of falling/rolling objects.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that accurately explains why Masha avoids the path.



"
"Laika daw hta ninpawt nna, lawu kaw na gara wa gaw manu-hprang maja ai bu hkawm ai wa hku nna hpang jahtum galaw na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Pyenli htaw sa magam a website hpe jep yu na (Access the company's website).**

Here's why:

* **The question asks how to find information about a company's employees (specifically, their names) without directly asking the company.**
* **Option D directly addresses this:**  Visiting the company's website is the most likely place to find employee information (like a directory, ""about us"" section with team bios, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: bu hkawm hpaga hpung ni law malawng na jaw na ngu tsun ai kumhpa ni hpe tam na (Find a knowledgeable person in that company and ask them directly):**  This is a direct approach, which the initial statement says is not possible.
* **B: Pyenli htaw sa magam hte tau hkrau lakmat mari la na (Use social media to find relevant information):** While social media *might* have some employee information, it's not as reliable or guaranteed as a company website.
* **C: bu hkawm hpaga hpung law law na manu hpe shingdaw yu na (Try to get information about the company's large team):** This is too vague and doesn't offer a specific method.



Therefore, accessing the company's website is the most logical and probable way to find employee information without directly asking the company, as outlined in the initial prompt.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bu hkawm ai ni hku nna pyenli manu kaja dik ai hpe lu la na matu shawng galaw ra ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Pyenli htaw sa magam a website hpe jep yu na** (Check the website of the company).

Here's why:

* **The question asks how to find out if a company is truly a legitimate company that pays its employees.** The provided text says you can check their website for information.

Let's break down why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: internet hpaga hpung law law na manu ni hpe shingdaw yu na** (Look for employee reviews on the internet): While reviews *can* be helpful, they aren't always reliable and aren't the most direct way to verify company legitimacy and payment practices.
* **C: Pyenli htaw sa magam hte tau hkrau lakmat mari la na** (Check official documents):  This is a good idea in general, but the text specifically mentions checking the company's *website* first.
* **D: bu hkawm dat kasa hte tau hkrau lakmat mari la na** (Check the company's address):  Again, a helpful step, but not the primary method suggested in the text.

The text directly states that if a company is a legitimate internet-based company, you can find information about it on its website. Therefore, checking the website is the most logical first step.



"
Lawan sa ya ai hpe hkan nang na matu manang galoi ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Arung arai ni hpe bu hkawm sawnghpai zaw sa dat yang.**

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P) describes a situation where a company is exploiting the local population.** It highlights how the company takes advantage of people's weaknesses (like poverty) and manipulates them into taking on debt. The phrase ""ngut sai bu hkawm sawnghpai zawn sa dat na lam sha re"" indicates that the company is trapping people into a cycle of debt.

* **Question (Q) asks how to deal with this exploitative situation.**

* **Option C directly addresses the core problem.**  ""Arung arai ni hpe bu hkawm sawnghpai zaw sa dat yang"" translates to ""To completely break the cycle of debt."" This is the most effective way to counter the company's exploitation.  It's not about just giving temporary relief (A or B) or negotiating terms (D) – it's about fundamentally changing the system that keeps people trapped.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Gunrai htaw pyenli hte arung arai ni hpe sa dat yang (To provide temporary relief and help with basic needs):** This is helpful in the short term, but it doesn't solve the root cause of the problem.  The people will likely fall back into debt.

* **B: Hpaga hpung hku na tinang a pyenli ni hpe akyu nga hkra jai lang yang (To support the local population with their needs and show empathy):**  Empathy is important, but it's not a practical solution to break the cycle of debt.

* **D: Lawan sa ya ai magam hpe hpaga hpung kaba ni jum lang yang (To negotiate terms with the company regarding their exploitative practices):** While negotiation *might* be a part of a larger strategy, it's unlikely to be effective against a company that is deliberately exploiting people. The company is driven by profit, and negotiation is unlikely to change that fundamentally.



Therefore, option **C** is the most appropriate and impactful answer, focusing on a long-term solution to the exploitative situation described.
"
"Laika daw hta mahta nna, tinang ayan jawn na nbungli hpe lata ai shaloi, lawu kaw na gara hpe ningshawng jaw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Kaba dik ai lam langai sha sa ai nbungli htaw sa magam**.

Here's why:

* **Understanding the question and context:** The question asks what you should do when someone you know is experiencing a problem and their behavior is changing significantly. The initial passage describes someone whose behavior has changed due to a problem, and their family is worried.

* **Analyzing the options:**
    * **A: amat law malawng jaw ai pyen htaw sa magam (Just a little bit of gentle words will suffice):** This is too dismissive. A significant change in behavior requires more than just gentle words.
    * **B: Kaba dik ai lam langai sha sa ai nbungli htaw sa magam (Speak kindly and patiently to the person):** This is the most appropriate response. Kindness and patience are crucial when dealing with someone going through a difficult time.
    * **C: Tinang ayan na jawn ai pyen li htaw sa magam (Speak to the person with their own words):** While understanding their perspective is important, simply repeating their words isn't helpful.
    * **D: bungjat laksan ahkaw ahkang hpe jaw ya na zawn re pyenli htaw sa magam (Speak with harsh words to make them realize their mistakes):** This is completely wrong and would likely worsen the situation.

* **Why option B is best:** Option B acknowledges the person's situation with kindness and patience, which is the most supportive and constructive approach in this context.



Therefore, **B** is the most fitting and helpful response to the scenario described."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, kadai wa gaw chyahkring hkring bu hkawm amat law law hpe jaw na zawn re rai?","Let's break down the question and the provided text.

**Understanding the Text (P):**

The text is in a dialect (likely a Burmese dialect). It's difficult to provide a perfect translation without expertise in that specific dialect. However, based on the structure and common themes in such writings, here's a rough interpretation:

""There was a time when [someone/something] was deeply affected. That [someone/something] was burdened by a heavy sorrow, and the days of their life were filled with pain, as if they were constantly struggling. Their days were truly difficult and oppressive.""

**Understanding the Question (Q):**

""If you were to choose a strong alliance to build with, what kind of alliance would you choose?""

**Analyzing the Options:**

*   **A: n bung ai alliance kaw na n bung ai pyenli** (an alliance with a leader who is powerful)
*   **B: alliance bung ai kaw na tinang ayan jawn ai pyenli** (an alliance with a leader who is clever/smart)
*   **C: alliance n bung ai kaw na tinang ayan jawn ai pyenli** (an alliance with a leader who is wise)
*   **D: alliance bung ai kaw na n bung ai kaga pyenli** (an alliance with a leader who is generous)

**Connecting the Text and the Question:**

The text describes a period of immense hardship and suffering. Someone deeply affected was enduring a struggle.  The question asks about choosing a strong alliance.

Given the context of suffering and the need for resilience, the best type of alliance would be with someone who offers *support and strength*. Out of the options, the closest fit is someone who is **wise (C)**. A wise leader would offer thoughtful guidance, strategic support, and potentially a long-term solution to the difficult situation.  While powerful (A) or generous (D) could be helpful, wisdom addresses the core of navigating hardship. Cleverness (B) could be useful, but wisdom is more encompassing.

**Therefore, the most appropriate answer is C: alliance n bung ai kaw na tinang ayan jawn ai pyenli (an alliance with a leader who is wise).**



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, chyaru tsa ladu shalia lusha ai majaw lawu kaw na gara maju jahten mat ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: namchyim maju**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a person is experiencing severe pain (shadawn sharam hte lu u) and is feeling unwell (masha shagu hpe nbung ai hku akyu jaw nga ai).**  They are complaining about their body (grai lai nna tsa lu ai lam kaw na aten galu hkamja lam hta byin mai ai mabyin ni kaw gaw sin hten za ai lam hte myi nmu mat ai mung lawm nna si hkrum si htan du wa hkra lawm nga ai). They also mention a feeling of being overwhelmed and wanting to be left alone (mai byin ai hkrit tsang hpa ni gaw tara nshang ai hku shapraw tawn ai tsa ni hpe lu sha ai shaloi grau law wa ai).

* **The question asks about the severity of the pain (laika hta ka da ai hte maren, chyaru tsa ladu shalia lusha ai majaw lawu kaw na gara maju jahten mat ai rai?).**

* **The passage implies the pain is not just mild, but significant.** The phrase ""namchyim maju"" translates to ""very severe pain"" or ""extreme pain.""  This best reflects the intensity of the pain described in the passage.

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: Na maju** -  Means ""small pain"" or ""slight pain,"" which doesn't match the description.
* **B: Mu maju** - Means ""moderate pain,"" which also doesn't fully encompass the severity.
* **D: Sama maju** - Means ""same pain,"" which is not relevant to the question about the intensity.



Therefore, **namchyim maju (C)** is the most accurate description of the pain being experienced.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw gara gaw chyaru tsa a akyu hpe shayawm kau ya na byin mai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Tara nshang ai hku shapru da ai wenyi ni hpe lu ai**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where a person is experiencing symptoms and seeking medical help. The details mention:

* **""Tsa lu hpa ni hpe shadawn sharam hte lu u.""** (The person is experiencing discomfort/pain).
* **""Grai lai nna tsa lu ai lam kaw na aten galu hkamja lam hta byin mai ai mabyin ni kaw gaw sin hten za ai lam hte myi nmu mat ai mung lawm nna si hkrum si htan du wa hkra lawm nga ai.""** (The person is feeling weak, dizzy, and nauseous).
* **""Mai byin ai hkrit tsang hpa ni gaw tara nshang ai hku shapraw tawn ai tsa ni hpe lu sha ai shaloi grau law wa ai.""** (The person is being given a medication to induce vomiting).
* **""Tara hte nhtan shai ai wenyi ni gaw kaji timung myi di ai (sh) si ai hpe shabyin chye ai methanol lawm ai hkrit tsang ra ai nsan nseng ai baw amyu myu lawm nga chye ai.""** (The person is being given methanol to induce vomiting due to a potential poisoning).

The question asks what the person is being given to induce vomiting. The text explicitly states **""methanol lawm ai hkrit tsang ra ai nsan nseng ai baw amyu myu lawm nga chye ai.""** (methanol is being used to induce vomiting).  And it also mentions **""Tara nshang ai hku shapru da ai wenyi ni hpe lu ai""** (vomiting induced by a specific medication). Since the context is methanol poisoning and inducing vomiting, the option referring to a medication used to induce vomiting is the most logical answer.

Therefore, **B** is the best fit. The text strongly implies that a specific medication (Tara nshang ai hku shapru da ai wenyi ni) is being used to induce vomiting in this case of suspected methanol poisoning.
"
Amsterdam na tsaw dik htum sutgan arung arai ni gaw gara kaw rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal Ginwang**.

The passage states: ""Canal Ginwang (Dutch: Grachtengordel) gaw Amsterdam a Binnenstad grup yin hkan tsa ban 17 na mying gumhkawng ai ginwang langai re."" This translates to ""Canal Ginwang (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a ring of canals around Amsterdam's Inner City, comprising 17 smaller canals.""

The question asks what Amsterdam's most distinctive feature is. The passage explicitly identifies the Canal Ginwang as this feature. Options B, C, and D describe aspects *of* the Canal Ginwang, but not the Canal Ginwang itself."
Canal Ginwang hpe hpa majaw UNESCO Mungkan Sali Wunli Shara zawn shalat da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: shi na labau hte htunghking manu a majaw (It is due to its canals and historic houses)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Canal Ginwang (Dutch: Grachtengordel) gaw Amsterdam a Binnenstad grup yin hkan tsa ban 17 na mying gumhkawng ai ginwang langai re. Dai ginra yawng UNESCO mungkan Sali Wunli a matu shalat maka da hkrum ai lam gaw dai shara a laklai ai sutgan arung arai ni gaw dai mungdan hta tsaw dik htum ai sutgan arung arai ni rai nga ai majaw mung rai nga ai.""  This translates to: ""Canal Ginwang (Dutch: Grachtengordel) is a ring of canals surrounding Amsterdam's Inner City with 17th-century historic houses. It was inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage list because of its well-preserved and outstanding example of a Renaissance urban planning.""

*  The core reason for the UNESCO recognition is the combination of the canals *and* the historical houses, representing a significant example of Renaissance urban planning. Option A captures this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shi a laklai ai sutgan arung arai ni (It is due to its outstanding Renaissance urban planning)** - While true, this doesn't fully explain *what* makes the planning outstanding. The canals and houses are key elements.
* **C: Shi na Binnenstad hpe shinggrup taw ai shara a majaw (It is due to its ring around the Inner City)** - The ring shape is *part* of the planning, but not the *sole* reason for the UNESCO recognition.
* **D: Shi na tsaw ai sutgan arung arai manu a majaw (It is due to its Renaissance houses)** -  While the houses are important, the canals are equally vital to the overall urban planning and are explicitly mentioned in the passage.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Phnom Krom de sa du ging ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tonle Sap ningmu ginra (Near Tonle Sap)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Angkor Pass nawku jawng de shang ra ai dai majaw Tonle Sap de sa yang passport la wa na hkum ma lap u."" This means that the Angkor Pass is needed to visit Phnom Krom, which is located near Tonle Sap Lake.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Angkor Pass hte bu hkawm lu na (Without Angkor Pass)**: The passage says you *need* an Angkor Pass to visit.
* **C: Siem Reap hpe mu yu na (Located in Siem Reap)**: While Phnom Krom is in Siem Reap, the question asks *what is it near*.
* **D: nawng de li hte hkrun lam kadun sa na (The mountains and forests are deep)**:  The passage mentions the surrounding scenery, but doesn't specify that it is *near* mountains and forests. The key information is its proximity to Tonle Sap.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Phnom Krom de lu shang na matu bu hkawm ai ni hpa baw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Yasovarman htingnu hpe lai kau na** (Built during the reign of Yasovarman).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ndai bum pungding nawku jawng gaw tsa ban 19 htum wa maga, **Yasovarman hkaw hkam wa up ai ten ladaw hta gaw gap lai wa ai re**."" This translates to: ""The Phnom Krom temple was built in the 19th year of King Yasovarman's reign.""

Therefore, the temple was built during the reign of Yasovarman. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided:

*   **B: Siem Reap grup yin sa du bu hkawm na** (Siem Reap group is a large group of people): While Phnom Krom is near Siem Reap, this isn't directly related to *when* it was built.
*   **C: Angkor Pass hpe lu la na** (Purchasing an Angkor Pass): This is required to visit Angkor, but it doesn't indicate when Phnom Krom was constructed.
*   **D: Tonle Sap makau li hte hkawm sa na** (Being located near Tonle Sap lake): While Phnom Krom is near Tonle Sap, this doesn't tell us when it was built.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw mungkan bu hkawm masha ni hku nna Antarctica de sa du yu na matu pat shadang mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: December hte January shata kaw bu hkawm ahkang jaw ai bungli lamang**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ginhtawng ta Nov-Feb laman sha mai hkawm ai..."" which translates to ""People come to visit from November to February..."".  This directly indicates that the visitors arrive during December and January.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bu hkawm ai hta jailang jahpan jat ai lam (The route from where the people come - Japan)** - The passage doesn't mention Japan as the origin of the visitors.
* **B: Ross Sea de marai langai sha sa du masam maram na matu myit lawm ai lam (The route to the Ross Sea from the north)** - While the passage mentions the Ross Sea, it doesn't state that the visitors come *from* the north to the Ross Sea.
* **D: masat da ai hkrang shamu shamawt ai lam (The route where seals are hunted)** - The passage doesn't focus on seal hunting or the routes related to it.



"
Bum lung ai kaw myit lawm ai mungkan bu hkawm masha langai hku nna Antartica gara shara de sa du yu na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ross panglai**.

The passage states: ""...ngut na zundawn, zunlawng, **Ross panglai** hkan de sa chyai na matu shadawn masat lam nga ai."" This translates to ""...near Zundawn, Zunlawng, and **Ross Island** along the coast."" Therefore, Ross Island is one of the places where the penguins gather.
"
Prat nau ndep shi ai lamu shagan maram dap de tawn ai byin na masa yawm dik ai shara hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **C: tsan gang ai shara kaw**.

Here's why:

The question asks what kind of group is likely to be responsible for spreading false information (prat nau).  The text states: ""Grau madang tsaw ai sawk sagawn sumtsan yu myiset ni gaw grau hkrak nna tsan ai grupyin masa ni hta grau kaja ai bungli ni hpe lu galaw ya nga ai.""

This translates to: ""Groups that are constantly involved in disseminating false information are those that actively spread lies to deceive people.""

Therefore, ""tsan gang ai shara kaw"" (groups that are constantly involved in disseminating false information) best describes the answer.
"
Prat dep sawk sagawn myihtawn gara kaw tawn da na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hpaji ningli hte seng ai dap kaw**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""What is the reason for the Prat's (the subject of the first paragraph) actions?"" The first paragraph describes Prat's actions: spending money without thinking, not working, and relying on others.  It also states that Prat is part of a group that engages in harmful activities like stealing.  The root cause of this behavior, as implied in the text, is a reliance on others/receiving support without contributing (hpaji ningli hte seng ai dap kaw - relying on support and not working).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: madun htingnu kaw (Lack of knowledge):** While a lack of knowledge *could* contribute, the text strongly suggests the issue is more about dependence and a lack of motivation, not simply a lack of information.
* **B: Dakkasu wang kaw (Severe illness):** The text provides no indication that Prat is ill.
* **D: Madi shadaw shara kaba kaw (Bad luck):** The text doesn't mention misfortune as a cause of Prat's actions.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw simsa ai panglai hkinggau shani na matu kaja dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tamaki gawt panglai hkin gau ni gaw Waitemata Harbour kaw re nga ai hte Mission Bay hte Ka-ang Auckland kaw na St Heliers ni a madang tsaw ai mare shingnawm hkan re nga ma ai.""

This translates to: ""The eastern shores of Auckland are facing Waitemata Harbour and Mission Bay and extending to St Heliers.""  Therefore, St Heliers is explicitly mentioned as a place on the eastern shores of Auckland.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mission Bay** is also mentioned, but St Heliers is more directly identified as a location along the eastern shore.
*   **C: Dingdung Sanghpaw daru Ginwang** is a specific location in Devonport, not a general area.
*   **D: Waitemata Sanghpaw daru** refers to Waitemata Harbour, not a specific area within Auckland.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, hka hpungyawt masa shim dik ai zawn san ai gara kaw rai?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dingdung Sanghpaw daru Ginwang na Pasihpik Nammuk dara hta re nna dingdung maga Long Bay kaw na dingda maga **Devonport** du hkra dam lada ai."" This translates to: ""The Devonport ferry from Long Bay crosses the Pacific Ocean...""

The question asks where the ferry crosses the water and offers options of locations. Devonport is explicitly mentioned as a point where the ferry travels *from*. Therefore, Devonport is the place the question is seeking. The other options are either locations *near* the ferry route or the ferry itself, not the destination *of* the ferry's journey across the water.
"
"Laika hta matsun da ai shara ni hpe sa du yu yang, lawu kaw na gara gaw n’htuk ai ngu sawn la lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sari sadang kaba ai zawn galaw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the horrors of the Holocaust:** It mentions the systematic persecution and murder of Jews by the Nazis, the concentration camps, and the destruction of Jewish communities.  It emphasizes the desecration of Jewish places of worship (synagogues) and the targeting of Jewish people.

* **The question asks about the fate of synagogues:** The question ""Laika hta matsun da ai shara ni hpe sa du yu yang, lawu kaw na gara gaw n’htuk ai ngu sawn la lu ai rai?"" translates to something like ""What happened to the places of worship where Jewish people used to pray, which were destroyed by the Nazis?""

* **Option A directly addresses this:** ""Sari sadang kaba ai zawn galaw ai"" translates to ""The places of worship where the holy books were kept."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of synagogues being destroyed and desecrated.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dai shara makau hkan ashit aka da ai (The places where people were killed were burned down)** While destruction occurred, the passage focuses more on the desecration of synagogues than the burning of killing sites.
* **C: mani hpa galaw ai (The jewels were taken away)**  The passage mentions the theft of property, but it doesn't directly relate this to the fate of the synagogues.
* **D: hkrang masa hpe mahkyit ai (The people were forced to work)** This refers to forced labor in camps, not the fate of synagogues.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately reflects the information provided in the passage and answers the question about the synagogues."
Lawu kaw na gara wa gaw ga apai ai hpe gawn da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: shachyaw da ai laika**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the ""gawara wa"" (which seems to refer to something related to the original statement) is made of. The original statement describes something that:

* **""laika gaw galaw da ai""**:  Essentially ""the auxiliary is moving.""
* **""shachyaw da ai""**:  This describes the auxiliary as ""being tense"" or ""being strained.""

The answer ""shachyaw da ai laika"" (the tense/strained auxiliary) directly relates to the description in the initial statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: galaw da ai laika (the moving auxiliary)**:  While the auxiliary is moving, this doesn't describe *what* it's made of.
* **B: shingra tara hte ninghtan shai ai laika (the auxiliary made of silver and gold)**: The original text doesn't mention any materials.
* **D: shingra tara hte seng ai laika (the auxiliary made of silver and lead)**:  Again, the original text doesn't mention any materials.

Therefore, the only option that aligns with the description provided is the auxiliary being tense/strained.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw auxiliary ga hpe tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: shanhte gaw shachyaw da ai hte shingra tara hku byin wa ai ga ni re**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""How does the auxiliary (shachyaw) become attached to the main verb (gaw)?""

The answer needs to describe the grammatical relationship between the auxiliary and the main verb. Option B, ""shanhte gaw shachyaw da ai hte shingra tara hku byin wa ai ga ni re"" (Auxiliary becomes attached to the main verb and changes its meaning), directly addresses this. It states that the auxiliary is *attached* to the main verb *and* modifies its meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** This describes the function of the auxiliary, but not *how* it's attached.
*   **C:** This option is about the *meaning* of the auxiliary, not how it's grammatically attached. It's about how the auxiliary affects the verb's meaning, not its physical connection.
*   **D:** This is incorrect. It states the auxiliary *changes* the main verb, which is a true function, but doesn't explain how the auxiliary is attached.

Therefore, **B** is the only option that correctly describes *how* the auxiliary is attached to the main verb - by being affixed and changing the verb's meaning.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nshung ta hta sanghpaw hte bu hkawm ai rai yang bu hkawm ai ni hku na hpa hpe jep yu ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: sanghpaw yup gawk shara**.

Here's why:

The passage says: ""Kashung ta hta Baltic dingdung maga hku lai ai rai yang, hkyeng lapran hku lai wa ai shaloi ana zinli kap ni a matu mala la re ai nsen ni hpe shapraw ya ai re majaw sanghpaw yup gawk nga shara hpe jep yu u."" This translates to: ""When the Baltic Sea freezes over, the ice is thick enough to hold a ship, and people can walk and play on the ice for many days.  They can also play games of **ice hockey** on the ice.""

The question asks: ""Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nshung ta hta sanghpaw hte bu hkawm ai rai yang bu hkawm ai ni hku na hpa hpe jep yu ra ai rai?"" This translates to: ""When the ice is thick enough to hold a ship, what games can people play on the ice?""

Option A, ""sanghpaw yup gawk shara"" (ice hockey), is directly mentioned in the passage as a game played on the ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng ai** (the ground is firm and not slippery):  This describes the ground, not the ice where games are played.
* **C: Gasi ga ngau ni** (it's a sunny day):  While it might be sunny, the passage doesn't say that's a requirement for playing games on the ice.
* **D: Mare kaba hta aten jahtum na shadang** (the horse is tired and needs to rest): This is irrelevant to the question about games played on the ice.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that directly answers the question based on the provided passage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, ginhtawng ta hta sanghpaw hte bu hkawm ai rai yang, bu hkawm ai ni hpa hpe koi yen lu na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Saint Petersburg**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saint Petersburg sanghpaw hte bu hkawm ai lam kaw gaw mare kaw hkawm chyai na aten mung lawm nga ai.""  This translates to: ""The area around Saint Petersburg's port is a beautiful and lively place.""

The question asks where Laika is related to the port and where the port's ships dock. The passage directly answers this by identifying Saint Petersburg as the location.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mare kaba hta ahkying aten** (The area around the sea port is lively) - This is too general. It doesn't specify the city.
* **B: hkyen hpe lai di na lam** (Along the river) - The passage talks about a *port*, which is typically on the *sea*.
* **C: mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng ai** (A place with luxurious and not very many people) - This contradicts the passage's description of the port area as ""lively.""



"
Hpa majaw Catalan gaw Barcelona kaw masat kumla hte ndau shabra laika ni hpe jahring hkring jai lai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Metro hte kaga mung shawa madi shadaw magam dap ni hta Catalan ga shaga ai masha ni grau law nga ai**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Metro kaw ayang shana ai hpe Catalan kaw sha galaw wa sai, raitim nmyit mada da ai shana ai lam hpe dai jak kaw na Spainsh, English, French, Arabic hte Japanese ga ni hte shi hkrai shana wa ai.""  This translates to: ""In the metro, you can travel by Catalan, and on the roads, you can easily understand Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.""

This directly indicates that Catalan is used in the metro and is relatively easy to understand on the roads in Barcelona.  Therefore, the statement about the metro and road signage being in Catalan is the most accurate answer to the question about where Catalan is frequently used.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai gaw Spanish ga hta grau na chye na loi ai (It's because Spanish is frequently used).** While Spanish is used, the text focuses on Catalan's usage.
* **B: Dai gaw mare kaba a shawng ningnan tsun shaga ai ga re (It's because of the influence of the past).** The text doesn't directly discuss historical influence as the main reason for Catalan's presence.
* **C: Dai gaw Barcelona hta ra sharawng ai ga re (It's because of Barcelona itself).** This is too general. While Barcelona *is* the location, it doesn't explain *where* Catalan is used.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and directly supported by the text.



"
Barcelona Metro gaw ayan shiga shana na matu gara tsun shaga ai lam hpe jai lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The text states: ""Metro kaw ayang shana ai hpe Catalan kaw sha galaw wa sai..."" which translates to ""Metro's announcements are in Catalan...""

Therefore, the announcements in the Barcelona Metro are in Catalan.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na mai kaja htap htuk ai lam gara gaw manap lusha hte zinghkam yupra na ningshawng jaw masa n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Laklai ai manu dan rai ni hte shachying tawn da ai ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a B&B (Bed & Breakfast) offering a welcoming atmosphere, delicious home-cooked meals (using local ingredients), and a shared space for guests to socialize.** It emphasizes the experience of eating home-cooked food and sharing stories.
* **Option B, ""Laklai ai manu dan rai ni hte shachying tawn da ai ni"" translates to ""Home-cooked food and sharing stories.""** This directly reflects the key elements highlighted in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Laksan lusha jahpan (Japanese-style traditional room)** - The passage mentions rooms but doesn't specifically focus on Japanese-style rooms.
* **C: Shinggan shara ni atsawm sha hkang zing da ai (Guests who are primarily interested in socializing)** - While socializing is mentioned, the passage emphasizes the food experience as well.
* **D: Lawan ai WiFi (Free WiFi)** - The passage doesn't mention WiFi.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw B&Bs zinghkam lapran shingjawng ai madung lamyi laman kaw na langai n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Du hkra hte htuk ai manap lusha hpan law law**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that B&Bs are often run by families (""du hkra hte htuk ai manap lusha hpan""). The text describes them as cozy and welcoming, with family members providing care and support.  It mentions sharing meals and experiences with the family, highlighting the familial aspect of these B&Bs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ban prat rum shatsawm tawn ai (Very clean and luxurious):** The passage doesn't focus on luxury. It highlights the warmth and family atmosphere, not necessarily opulence.
* **C: Prat dep zinghkam yupra (Expensive lodging):** The passage doesn't mention price or cost.  The focus is on the experience and the family atmosphere.
* **D: Grupyin buga kaw na lusha ni (A group of friends):** While friends *can* stay at B&Bs, the passage doesn't characterize them as always being run *by* a group of friends. It primarily describes family-run establishments.



Therefore, option B best captures the core idea of B&Bs as described in the passage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, 2022 Beijing hta lawu kaw na gara lamang hpe n'galaw na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hpawng hpaw poi lamang** (Only speed skating).

The passage states: ""Beijing kaw gaw hpawng hpaw hte hpawng ginchyum dat lamang hpe galaw na re nna nta kata kaw hkyen jawn ai lamang hpe ma galaw wa na re."" This translates to: ""Beijing was only used for speed skating and short track speed skating, and other sports were not held there.""

Therefore, only speed skating was held in Beijing.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw 2022 Beijing hku nna lamang madu rai na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ginhtawng Olympic**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Miwa mungdan a Beijing muklum gaw 2022 na Olympic Nshung ta Ginsup poi a nta madu re na re..."" (Miwa was a volunteer in Beijing during the 2022 Winter Olympics...)
* The question asks: ""Lawu kaw na gara gaw 2022 Beijing hku nna lamang madu rai na rai?"" (What kind of event was held in Beijing during the 2022 Beijing Olympics?)
* The passage explicitly mentions ""2022 na Olympic Nshung ta Ginsup"" which translates to ""2022 Winter Olympics"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kata kaw shingjawng ai hkyen jawn lamang ni** (The main event of the opening ceremony) - While the opening ceremony was an event, the passage focuses on the overall Olympics.
* **C: Nshung ta Olympic** (Winter Olympics) - While the passage mentions Winter Olympics, the question asks *what kind of event* was held, and ""Winter Olympics"" is more descriptive than simply ""Winter Olympics"".
* **D: Hpawng pat poi lamang** (Only snow events) - The passage mentions skiing in Zhangjiakou, implying other sports were also part of the Olympics.



Therefore, **Ginhtaung Olympic (Winter Olympics)** is the most accurate and encompassing answer."
U li mak hkalawng ana kap na tsaw dik shoihpa nga ai ni gaw kadai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: U hkai byek rem ai bungli masha ni (A person who is constantly striving/working hard)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a person who is constantly working hard and striving.**  The phrase ""Law malawng gaw u hkai byek rem ai bungli galaw ai ni lawm ai"" translates to ""A capable person is admired for constantly striving and working hard.""
* **The question asks who is someone who is constantly striving/working hard.** This directly aligns with the description in the passage.
* **Option A (""U yu bungli galaw ai ni"" - A person who is constantly working)** is too broad. While working is part of it, the passage emphasizes striving and effort.
* **Option B (""Chyu jaw dusat ni hte bungli galaw ai ni"" - A person who is hardworking and constantly striving)** is close, but not as accurate as C.
* **Option D (""Shawng de ana kap ga ai masha ni"" - A person who is a master of their skill)** focuses on skill mastery, not the continuous effort described.



Therefore, **C** best captures the meaning of the passage and directly answers the question.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw u li byin ai hte seng nna hkrak tup lu tang madun ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Mabyin law law gaw u ni hta grau shinggyim masha ni hta ana kap ai ngu na shiga tang shawn ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where someone is seeking guidance and advice from someone older and wiser (""law malawng"").** The older person offers support and helps the younger person navigate a difficult situation.
* **The question asks what the older person did for the younger person in this situation.**
* **Option B accurately reflects this:** ""Mabyin law law gaw u ni hta grau shinggyim masha ni hta ana kap ai ngu na shiga tang shawn ai"" translates to ""The older person, having understood the young person's situation, offered guidance and support in a way that showed their wisdom.""  This directly relates to the passage's description of the older person's helpful actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: U hkai byek rem ai bungli masha ni sha u li ana kap ai:** ""The older person understood the young person's situation and offered help."" This is too general. It doesn't specify *how* they helped.
* **C: U yu bungli galaw ai ni kaw ana kap na lam shoihpa nga ai:** ""The older person offered advice along the path the young person was taking."" This doesn't quite fit the context. The passage suggests the young person was struggling, not simply following a path.
* **D: Shinggyim masha hta ana kap ai mabyin yawng gaw si wa mai ai baw re:** ""The guidance they offered was suitable for the young person's situation."" While partially correct, it doesn't fully capture the act of offering guidance *in a specific way*.



"
Panglai Hpraw-Baltic Canal gaw hpa hte matut da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Onega Nawng hte Volga hka nu**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Onega nawng gaw Volga hte matut da ai majaw Caspian panglai hpe lai nna Russia de sa wa ai lam gaw byin mai nga ai."" which translates to ""The Onega River flows into the Volga River, which then flows towards the Caspian Sea, and connects to the Russia's route."" This means the Onega River and the Volga River connect to the Caspian Sea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Black Sea hte Caspian Panglai:** While the canal connects to both seas, the text specifically mentions the Onega and Volga rivers.
*   **C: Arctic Panglai hte Baltic Panglai:** This refers to the Arctic and Baltic Sea routes, which are not directly related to the canal's location as described.
*   **D: Dingda Panglai and Panglai Hkyeng:** These terms are not mentioned in the text and are not relevant to the description of the canal's connection.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, kaning re jak rai hpan gaw bu hkawm ai ni hpe gin jang hpa n byin na matu maigan pru hkawm lakmat hpe zing la da ya na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shana yup wanleng ni**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the type of day Masha likes to spend when she has free time. The paragraph states: ""Shana yup wanleng ntsa kaw gaw, maigan pru hkawm lakmat ni hpe wanleng hpareng wa e zing la da ya na re dai shaloi she nang yup ai shaloi gin jang ai lam nhkrum na re.""

This translates to: ""On weekends, she likes to spend free time doing things that are usually done on holidays, and she enjoys the feeling of being free.""  ""Shana yup wanleng ni"" directly refers to a weekend day, which aligns with the description of Masha's preference for free time activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pyenli ni (Regular day):** The paragraph emphasizes Masha's preference for weekends (shana yup wanleng ni), not regular days.
* **C: Sanghpaw li ni (Sunday):** While Sunday is a weekend day, the paragraph doesn't specifically focus on Sunday. It describes the general preference for weekend days.
* **D: Jarit lai wanleng ni (Busy weekend day):** The paragraph states that she likes to spend free time, implying she *doesn't* prefer busy weekend days. The phrase ""wanleng hpareng wa e zing la da ya na re dai shaloi she nang yup ai shaloi gin jang ai lam nhkrum na re"" points to doing things she *enjoys* doing in her free time.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nkau jarit lai wanleng ni hta galoi hkan tara shang ID hpe jep ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Njep ai (To apply)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what you need to do to get a new ID if your ID was lost or stolen. The passage states: ""...wanleng langai gaw jarik langai du ai ten nang hta tara shang ID nang hte rau nga taw ra na."" This translates to ""...if your ID is lost or stolen, you need to apply for a new ID.""

Therefore, the answer is ""Njep ai"" which means ""To apply.""
"
Sigapore na kahtet shadang tsaw ai shara kaw nga ai shaloi lawu kaw na gara gaw manghkang byin na zawn re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sa'up ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks where Singapore's highest point is located. The provided text states: ""Raitim """"""kahtet shadang tsaw ai"""""" ai shara equator a dingdung hte nau ntsan ai shara kaw nang nga yang nang (galoi mung) kahtet ai hte jan grai ja ai hpe lu hkam ra na re (lamu hkoi san ai ten, nau nkahten ai).""  This translates to: ""It is said that the highest point of Singapore is located on the southern slope (steep slope) and is not a mountain, but a hill (relatively flat, somewhat elevated).""

Therefore, the highest point of Singapore is on its southern slope. ""Sa'up ai"" translates to ""southern.""
"
German shadung muk ni hpe sha na matu kadai koi yen na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Kawp ja hkum ahpun ana nga ai ni (Custard and fruit flavored days)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""German masha law law gaw lahkyang si (almond), haze si hte kaga kawp ja si ni gayau da ai rai ni ni hpe muk kabaw ai. Mying kaba ai kek muk ni hpe kahpi law law hte lu yang grai htap htuk ai baw re. Kan tit ai mung hpe kachyi mi chyim mayu yang, Berliner, Pfannkuchen dai nrai Krapfen ngu shaga ai shara kaw sa u.""

This translates to: ""German cakes are mostly (almond), hazy and custard flavored days that are commonly used for topping. They are often filled with fruit and topped with powdered sugar. The cakes we eat are similar to donuts, Berliner, Pfannkuchen or Krapfen.""

Therefore, the passage directly links German cakes to **custard and fruit flavors**. Option A is the only option that reflects this. The other options (fruit, chocolate, and custard-flavored drinks) aren't mentioned in the text.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gayau bang rai gaw German shadung muk a du hkra hte seng ai npawt ru di rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Haze kawp ja si**.

The text states: ""German masha law law gaw lahkyang si (almond), **haze si hte kaga kawp ja si** ni gayau da ai rai ni hpe muk kabaw ai.""  This translates to ""German cakes are mainly (almond), **hazy and moist** cakes that are made with powdered sugar.""  Therefore, ""haze kawp ja si"" (hazy and moist) describes a key characteristic of German cakes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mukawk si (Powdery):** While some German cakes might have a powdery texture, it's not the primary characteristic mentioned.
* **C: Mahkaw si (Rich):**  While German cakes can be rich, the text doesn't explicitly focus on richness as a defining factor.
* **D: Lahkyang si (Light):** The text says the cakes are *not* light; they are moist.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw manu hpa bu hkawm hkrun lam na matu madi shadaw ai n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Lusha hte dum nta manam masing hte seng ai jai lang ra ai ni hpe shayawm kau na**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where someone (the speaker) is facing financial difficulties and is struggling to make ends meet.  The speaker mentions a lack of resources, job instability, and mounting debts.  They are looking for ways to improve their situation.

Option D translates to: **""Showing kindness and compassion to those who are poor and in distress.""**

This aligns with the speaker's implied need for support and help from others.  The passage doesn't suggest the speaker should focus on any of the other options.  The focus is on navigating hardship and potentially needing assistance.  Showing kindness and compassion is a natural response to someone facing such struggles.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tinang bu hkawm ai shaloi hta hkrup bungli ni hpe na galaw ai (Moving the broken pieces of a pot to cover the cracks).** This is a metaphor for a temporary fix, not a long-term solution to financial problems. While sometimes necessary, it doesn't address the underlying issues.
* **B: Tinang na myit htep hpa lam madang hte kayin kaye htap htuk ra na (Using the strength of one's own legs to walk on a difficult path).** This is about self-reliance and perseverance, which is important, but the question is about seeking help. The passage indicates the speaker is struggling *despite* trying to persevere.
* **C: masha ni kaw gumhpraw hpyi na (Using accumulated wealth to cover expenses).** The passage explicitly states the speaker lacks wealth and is in debt. This option is the opposite of their situation.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw jailang jahpan nlaw dik ai kaw bu hkawm ai shaloi mayak mahkak hkrum mai ai rai?","The answer is **D: Bu hkawm matsun laika hpe hkan nang na matu pyaw ai masha ni**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the reason for the Japanese government's potential desire to imprison or detain someone who has committed a crime and fled to Japan. The text describes the situation where someone has fled to Japan after committing a crime and is now facing the consequences, including potential arrest and extradition.

Option D, ""Bu hkawm matsun laika hpe hkan nang na matu pyaw ai masha ni"" translates to ""The reason for the Japanese government to imprison or detain someone who has fled to Japan."" This directly addresses the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yak hkak ai hpe hkap tau la chye ai masha ni** translates to ""The reason for the Japanese government to be able to capture someone."" While capture is a possibility, the question is specifically about imprisonment/detention *after* fleeing.
* **B: Tup hkrak hkan sa ra ai ahkying hte seng ai shagyip shagyeng ai lam n'nga ai masha ni** translates to ""The reason for the Japanese government to be able to find evidence and gather information.""  Finding evidence is a prerequisite for arrest, but it doesn't explain *why* they might want to imprison/detain someone who fled.
* **C: Bu hkawm ai shaloi tsan ai kaw na bungli galaw na matu lajang da ai ni** translates to ""The reason for the Japanese government to be able to follow the trail of the fleeing person.""  Following the trail enables arrest, but not imprisonment/detention.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and complete answer to the question.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Marion shara hte Fairmont lapran mawdaw gau ai lam hpe tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Chyang shadang masat ni hpe hkansa na lam taw ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Masat shadang ni hpe hkan nang hkan sa na lam gaw kaga lam ni hta ahkyak dik htum re."" This translates to ""The strong wind can cause strong gusts that can knock down power lines.""

Option C directly reflects this statement. The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: Dai kaw nam kahtawng na hkrun lam galu ni nga ai:** While related, the text focuses on the wind's impact on power lines, not just the general conditions.
*   **B: Lam kaji ni gaw chyat ai:** The text mentions power lines being affected, but not necessarily roads.
*   **D: Sumbu phone magam gaw mayak n byin gying ai:** The text mentions phone lines being affected, but not necessarily the phone's internal components.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is C.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Buffalo-Pittsburg mawdaw lam kaba kaw bu hkawm ai mawdaw gau ai ni na matu madung myit tsang lam rai na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Jahkring hkring lam gram ai hte hkrum ai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a strong wind (35-40 mph) that can cause power outages and damage phone lines in the Buffalo-Pittsburgh area. It mentions that power lines in Pennsylvania are particularly vulnerable.  Therefore, the most likely answer is that the power is out due to the wind and is being repaired.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mawdaw htinglet ai lam kaw chyat nga na (A strong, direct wind):**  While the passage *mentions* a strong wind, it's not the *reason* for the power outage itself.
* **B: Law htam ai radio phone magam n'nga ai (A radio phone is damaged):** The passage says phone lines are damaged, not radio phones.
* **C: Lawan magaw ai hpe grai lawan hkra magaw ai (A storm is causing damage to other things):** While a storm *is* causing damage, the passage focuses on the wind and its effects on power and phone lines.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw canyouneering galaw hpang na matu ra rawng ai lam n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hka hpung yawt chye ai atsam (Steep cliffs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that canyoning involves descending routes in canyons, ""reaching areas with steep cliffs, slippery rocks, and waterfalls (etc.)"".  Option A directly reflects this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tsaw dik hkrang hte seng ai masa (Rough and uneven terrain):** While canyoning *can* involve rough terrain, the passage specifically highlights *steep cliffs* as a key element.
* **C: Gumlawt ai atsam (Slippery rocks):** Slippery rocks are *mentioned* as part of the canyoning environment, but not the defining characteristic used to identify the type of route.
* **D: Wunkat loi mi ra ai (Non-experts):**  The passage describes *who* can do canyoning (people who are not afraid of heights, etc.), not *what type of route* they take.

Therefore, **A (Steep cliffs)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, awngdang ai canyoning tangpyaw hkrun lam na matu ra rawng ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Shawng de hka hpung lip ai hte seng nna mahkrum madup nga ai** (It involves rappelling down waterfalls and navigating slippery terrain).

Here's why:

* **The provided text describes canyoning as involving descending canyons using various techniques like rappelling, climbing, and swimming.** Option B directly reflects these key elements.
* **Option A (Rawt jat gan ga ai ginsup hpaji atsam - Simple downhill hiking)** is incorrect because canyoning is far more challenging than simple hiking; it involves technical skills and often dangerous obstacles.
* **Option C (Canyoneering hta tara shang sakse lakmat - Canyoning requires strong physical ability)** is partially correct, but not the *most* accurate answer. While fitness is needed, the description emphasizes the specific techniques involved, not just general physical strength.
* **Option D (Hka hpung yawt chye ai atsam -  Dangerous terrain)** is also true, but doesn't capture the specific *methods* used to navigate the terrain, which is what the text highlights.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, tinang a mawdaw hta camp galaw na yaw shada da ai wa na matu hpa baw gaw karum shingtau hpa rai na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Yup galeng mai ai baw lahkum lawm ai mawdaw**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the speaker needs to transport a lot of luggage.** It mentions various vehicle types like minivan, SUV, sedan, and station wagon, all because the luggage is substantial.
* **The question asks what kind of vehicle would be suitable for transporting luggage.** 
* **Option B, ""Yup galeng mai ai baw lahkum lawm ai mawdaw"" translates to ""A spacious car that can accommodate a lot of luggage.""** This perfectly aligns with the information provided in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tinang mawdaw a ndang di lu ai lam ni hpe atsawm myit hkawn ra ai (A car that is not old, but has been used a lot)** - While a car that's not old might be good, the focus is on *capacity*, not age.
* **C: Janghpang nbung jawng ginsum (A jeep with a powerful engine)** - A powerful engine isn't the primary requirement; the need is for space.
* **D: Camp galaw na matu dinghkrai shara ga (A camping car with all necessary equipment)** - The passage doesn't mention camping or needing specialized camping equipment. The focus is simply on carrying luggage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, mawdaw hte camp galaw ai ni gaw radar npu hta nga na matu shara tam taw ai rai yang shanhte hpa hpe koi kau mayu na rai?","The correct answer is **A: SUV (sh) minivan zawn re ai grau kaba ai mawdaw hpe gawt ai lam**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where the speaker needs to transport a large quantity of honey and equipment to a remote location. It specifically mentions needing a vehicle that can handle rough terrain (""kadun ai hku tsun ga nga yang, sumtsan bu hkawm ai lam hpe na a mawdaw hte sa yang gaw hkrak ai raitim""). 

*   **SUV (Sport Utility Vehicle) and Minivans** are known for their durability and ability to navigate challenging roads, making them suitable for this task.
*   **Option B** is too general.  ""Grau galu ai mawdaw hkrun lam hpe lata la na"" (to drive a large vehicle on a rough road) doesn't specify the *type* of vehicle needed.
*   **Option C** is completely irrelevant. It mentions ""Mare hta (sh) dinghkrai shara hta janghpang nbung jawng ginsum masat shachyaw na"" which translates to ""to attach a trailer to a Dinghkrai shara (a type of cart) with a ginsum (a kind of rope) for pulling"". This isn't the primary need described in the text.
*   **Option D** is incorrect because the text emphasizes the *size and capability* of the vehicle, not about the driver's experience or preference.



Therefore, the text points toward needing a robust vehicle like an SUV or minivan to manage the logistics of hauling honey and equipment to a difficult-to-reach location.  Option A best reflects this need."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Casablanca hpe lahkawng lang hku nna kadai gaw gap wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Portuguese**.

The passage states: ""Portuguese gaw dai shara hpe shaning 1755 ning na nnang ai hpang sha kabai tawn kau nna..."" which translates to ""The Portuguese were the first to establish a foothold in the area around 1755..."". 

The other options are incorrect:

*   B: Spain hpaga hpung ni (Spain's influence) - While Spain had influence later, the Portuguese were first.
*   C: Merenid ni (Merenid dynasty) - The passage mentions the Merenid dynasty as a potential earlier inhabitants, but not as the first to establish a foothold.
*   D: Morocoo na sultan hkawhkam (Moroccan Sultanate) - The Sultanate later took control, but the Portuguese were the first to arrive.



"
Shingra tsin-yam tsindam hpang Casablanca na prat dep mare hpe kadai ni kabai kau ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Phoenician ni**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Casablanca a ndai prat na mare hpe BCE tsa ban 10 daram hta nga hkwi masha Berber wa e gaw sharawt da ai re nna Phoenician ni...""  This translates to ""Casablanca was founded around 1000 BCE by Berber tribes and was initially inhabited by the Phoenicians...""

The other options are mentioned later in the text, but the Phoenicians are identified as the *initial* founders.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sintra gaw maigan amyu ni lapran matsing masat hkrum ai lam hpe gara hku lu wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Lord Byron na mai kaja ai maram yu ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""dai shara gaw maigan masha ni a matu mying kaba hkra lajang da ai re majaw dai hpe hkik hkam dik ai shara ngu Lord Byron matsing sumhting da ai."" This translates to: ""The second [part] is the road where Lord Byron often walked, which he admired for its beautiful and majestic sights.""

Therefore, the road frequented and admired by Lord Byron is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:**  Mentioned as a location, but not the road Lord Byron admired.
* **B: Maria mauhpa shadan dan ai lam:** This refers to a path associated with Maria, but not the road Byron frequently walked.
* **D: Myit mangoi hpa labau re:** This translates to something like ""the path of the white water,"" which isn't directly mentioned as the road of interest to Lord Byron.



"
Armenia ni a matsing masat da n hkrum ai hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Nagorno-Karabakh ginra**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""1994 hta, Azerbaijan a Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh ginra na myu bawng sang gaw Azeris hpe majan baw masai.""  This translates to: ""In 1994, the Azerbaijani government aggressively attacked the Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh region.""

Therefore, the question ""Armenia ni a matsing masat da n hkrum ai hpa rai?"" (What did the Armenian government attack?) is answered by the phrase ""Nagorno-Karabakh ginra"" (the Nagorno-Karabakh region).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Azeris hpe ninghtan ai majan** (Aggressively attacked Azeris) - The passage says the *Azerbaijani* government attacked Nagorno-Karabakh, not the other way around.
* **C: Azerbaijan na mung masa ndang kalang manghkang** (Rapidly occupied Azerbaijani territory) -  The passage focuses on the attack on Nagorno-Karabakh, not broader territorial occupation.
* **D: Gumsan magam mungdan nnan** (Involved in some kind of corruption) - The passage doesn't mention corruption.



"
Hpa gaw Azerbaijan hte Armenia lapran kanawn mazum ai lam hpe matut nna machyi shangun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Nagorno-Karabakh ginra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""P: 1994 hta, Azerbaijan a Armenian Nagorno-Karabakh ginra na myu bawng sang gaw Azeris hpe majan baw masai.""  This translates to: ""P: In 1994, the Azerbaijani population violently expelled the Armenian population from Nagorno-Karabakh.""

The question asks what the basis was for the conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia. The passage directly states that the conflict arose from the expulsion of Armenians from Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Azerbaijan hta nga ai Armenian ni (Azerbaijan's Armenian population):** While there was an Armenian population in Azerbaijan, the passage focuses on the conflict *over* Nagorno-Karabakh, not specifically the Armenian population in Azerbaijan.
*   **B: 1994 majan (1994):** 1994 is a date mentioned in the passage, but it's the year the expulsion from Nagorno-Karabakh happened. It's not the underlying *basis* of the conflict.
*   **C: Mung masa ndang kalang manghkang (Rapid military escalation):** The passage describes the violent expulsion, but it doesn't frame the conflict solely as a ""rapid military escalation."" It's about the territorial dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh.



"
"Charlotte hta mawdaw shap yang, hpa gaw bungjat jahpu manu byin wa chye rai?","The correct answer is **C: Mare shinggan de sa yang** (Carefully observing).

Here's why:

The passage states that Charlotte has been observing the streets for the past 20 days, looking for people who are victims of human trafficking. The text mentions she watches taxi drivers and people who seem to be involved in suspicious activities. This implies she is **carefully observing** to identify potential victims.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaga shara kaw shanu nga yang** (Observing from a distance): While she might observe from a distance, the passage emphasizes her active searching and scrutiny.
* **B: Hkrun lam masha masum nga yang** (Observing with naive eyes): The passage depicts Charlotte as actively searching for victims of a serious crime, not with naivete.
* **D: Jinghku manang zawn rai yang** (Observing from a high place): The passage doesn't mention her observing from a height.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Charlotte hta ma ni hte nga yang hpa gaw n kaja ai ngu myit lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Taxi mawdaw shap jawn ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Taxi mawdaw ni hpe Charlotte na nta masha ni masa lam loi mi hkan sha lang ai raitim, malawng maga gaw nlang ma ai."" (Taxi drivers often take people from Charlotte's airport to their destinations, and they often speak a foreign language.)
* **The question asks:** ""Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Charlotte hta ma ni hte nga yang hpa gaw n kaja ai ngu myit lu ai rai?"" (After arriving at the airport and getting through customs, what can be seen in Charlotte?)
* **Option B directly aligns with this statement.**  People arriving at Charlotte's airport will encounter taxi drivers offering rides. This is a visible aspect of the airport experience described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dum nta manu ni:** (Foreign language) While the passage mentions taxi drivers speaking foreign languages, the question asks what can be *seen*, not what can be *heard*.
* **C: Kaga shara kaw shanu nga ai ni:** (People with long black hair) The passage doesn't mention anything about hair color.
* **D: Mare kaw nga pyaw na matu shakut ai lam:** (A place where you can buy various souvenirs) The passage doesn't mention shopping or souvenirs.

Therefore, **B** is the only logical answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"Spain ni n du shi yang, Chile na dingdung maga hpe kadai up hkang ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Araucanian ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""16th century hta Spain ni ndu shit yang, dingda Chile hpe Inca ni aup hkang ai re dai shaloi Araucanians masha (Mapuche) ni Chile kaang hte dingdung kaw nga ma ai."" This translates to: ""In the 16th century, Spain, having conquered the Inca empire, fought with the Araucanians (Mapuche) of Chile.""

Therefore, the Araucanians (Mapuche) are the ones who resisted Spanish rule in Chile. The question asks who fought against Spanish rule in Chile."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw 1810 hta n byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Napoleonic majan ni gasat gala byin taw ai**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Chile gaw 1810 hta rawt malan sai ngu ndau tim mung (Napoleonic majan lapran shaning law law hta Spain ni gaw mungdan up hkang ai bungli atsawm nlu galaw wa ai), gaja sha Spanish hpe shaning 1818 du hkra nlu dang manga la ma ai.""  This translates to: ""Chile started to rebel in 1810 (due to the great turmoil of the Napoleonic Wars, when Spain was being invaded and occupied by foreign powers), and then finally won independence from Spain in 1818.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dai shaloi madung asuya n'nga ai** (It is not clear). This is too vague.
* **B: Chile gaw Spain mungdan hpe awng padang lu la sai** (Chile was able to win against Spain).  The text says Chile *rebelled* and eventually *won independence*, but it doesn't say they easily *won against* Spain. The Napoleonic Wars created an opportunity for independence.
* **D: Chile gaw rawt malan ndau shana sai** (Chile started to rebel). While true, it's not the *reason* why Chile started to rebel. The text connects the rebellion to the Napoleonic Wars.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the reason for Chile's rebellion as presented in the text.



"
Liguria ginra na tsan ai mare de masha ni gara hku lu du na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mawdaw (sh) hkali hte**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lam ni, wanleng ni hte hkali ni dai mare ni hte matut tawn ai rai nna mawdaw ni chyawm gaw shinggan hku nmai du nga ai.""

This translates to: ""In the past, roads, sea routes, and the movement of people and goods along the sea routes were the main ways of communication.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions ""mawdaw (sh) hkali hte"" (sea routes and travel by sea) as a significant means of communication in Liguria.
"
Italy ga hkum 'Cinque Terre’ gaw hpa hpe tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mare manga (Sea earthquake)**.

The passage states: ""Lai wa sai century law law hta, masha ni gaw hkraw ni hpe atsawm lung mai ai shara ni shachyaw, lung mai ai lakang ni galaw nna panglai hpe mu lu na matu galaw ma ai."" This translates to: ""In the last century, the inhabitants have been constantly struggling with landslides and floods, and the land has been constantly moving and collapsing.""  It also mentions ""Dai tsawm ttap ai lam gaw rawt jat wa ai hpe mu na yak ai lam mung langai rai nga ai."" which means ""The paths that were once connecting the villages have been destroyed by landslides and floods.""  Therefore, the landslides and floods are the reason for the destruction of the paths, and the underlying cause of these events is related to the sea (mare).
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, nshung ta hta gashawt na lam byin chye ai mabyin masa na matu lawu kaw na gara buk hkyep din gaw htap htuk ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: 1/5 letma sung maka kumla n lawm ai buk hkyep din ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Maka kumla gaw 5 mm (1/5 letma) hta jan yang ram la sai, rungrai gaw katsi ai masat shadang hta re yang anya nga sai."" This translates to: ""The gap is 5 mm (1/5 letma) or so, the width is a bit larger than the gap.""

The question asks about the size of the gap (""nshung ta hta gashawt na lam byin chye ai mabyin masa na matu lawu kaw na gara buk hkyep din gaw htap htuk ai rai?"").

Therefore, the answer referring to the gap's size is the most accurate. Option D directly reflects this information.
"
Nshung ta na hkyen pa lam ni kaw lawu kaw na gara gaw gang dun n-gun hpe grau kaja hkra n lu galaw ya ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Zaibru**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Zaibru, lung sha jum (calcium chloride) ni gaw gang dun n-gun grau nga na matu lam nmaw lam kaji hkan de jahkring hkring bra taw ai.""

This translates to: ""Zaibru, lung sha jum (calcium chloride) is used to mix with the grains to prevent them from becoming damp and moldy.""

The question asks what is used to prevent the grains from becoming damp and moldy.  Therefore, the answer is Zaibru.



"
Hawaii hte Cook Island lapran lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak bung ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Lahkawng yan kaw manam dap kaba ni grai nga ai** (The Cook Islands and Hawaii have a similar climate).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hawaii hte aten bung nna, zunlawng ni gaw kalang marang """"""Hawaii kata kaw sha re kun"""""""" ngu nna shadu ma ai. Hawaii gaw manam jarik kaba ni, kaga bawngring lam ni nnga shi ai ten mungdaw mungdan hku nre shi ai sha naw kaji nga ai shaloi kaw na mying kaba ai manam ni sa du ga ai hpe myit dum shangun ai."" (Hawaii is located near the equator, and its climate is similar to ""Hawaii's tropical climate"". Hawaii has a tropical climate, with high temperatures and abundant rainfall throughout the year.)

It also states: ""The Cook Zunlawng ni hta mare kaba ngu ai hku nnga ai zunlawng 15 hte gahkyin da ai re. Madung zunlawng ni gaw Rarotonga hte Aitutaki re."" (The Cook Islands have 15 islands and are located near the equator. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.)

Therefore, both Cook Islands and Hawaii are located near the equator and have tropical climates with high temperatures and rainfall, making their climates similar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lahkawng yan kaw awm dawm daru magam lu ai mungdan madang n'nga ai** (The Cook Islands and Hawaii have a dry, cold climate) - The text explicitly states they have *abundant rainfall*.
*   **C: Lahkawng yan gaw ahkying ginwang bung ai** (The Cook Islands and Hawaii are both mountainous) - The text doesn't mention either being mountainous.
*   **D: Lahkawng yan kaw mare kaba hpa n'nga ai** (The Cook Islands and Hawaii have a similar ocean) - While they share an ocean, the text focuses on the *climate* similarities, not the ocean.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Cook zunlawng hpe tup hkrak n lu htawn dan ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Rarotonga hte Aitutaki gaw madung mare kaba ni re.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The Cook Islands hta mare kaba ngu ai hku nnga ai raitim nbung ai zunlawng 15 hte gahkyin da ai re. Madung zunlawng ni gaw Rarotonga hte Aitutaki re.""  This directly translates to ""The Cook Islands have 15 atolls and motus that are mainly inhabited. The main islands are Rarotonga and Aitutaki.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hawaii hta grau kaji ai** - The passage mentions Hawaii as a comparison point, but it doesn't say the Cook Islands are *mainly* influenced by Hawaii.
*   **B: Dai gaw zunlawng majaw re** -  ""Dai gaw zunlawng majaw re"" translates to ""This is the largest island"", which isn't a statement made in the passage. The passage discusses atolls and motus, not necessarily the largest island.
*   **D: Zunlawng mungdan gaw Hawaii ahkying ginwang hte maren sha re** -  ""Zunlawng mungdan gaw Hawaii ahkying ginwang hte maren sha re"" translates to ""The island's culture is mainly influenced by Hawaii"". The passage presents the Cook Islands' culture as distinct, although with some comparison to Hawaii.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara namkawn du dabang gaw shana yup mai ai manam dum nta lata la ahkang lahkawng nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The passage states: ""Sirena gaw camping hta jan na shana yup mai ai manam jarawp hte kahtet hpoi hpoi lusha ni ma jaw ai namkawn du dabang rai nga ai."" This translates to ""Sirena is a place where people go camping and enjoy the lush, green jungle."" The question asks which location is described as a place for camping and enjoying the jungle.

The other options are mentioned as locations for camping but are not specifically described with the same detail regarding the lush jungle environment as Sirena.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, tinang gaw hkoi mari kat pa hte n re sha gumhpraw hte jai lang mayu yang nampan sun shang ahkang lakmat hpe gara kaw lajang da mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

This translates to: ""The Park Service (MINAE) is working to protect people from tsunami risks by providing information. **Sirena** is a coastal area where people camp and enjoy the lush, pristine beach.""

Therefore, Sirena is the location where the Park Service is focusing its efforts to protect people from tsunami risks.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaning re hkyen jawn ai gaw n'hkap kadawng ai bum ntsa kaw galaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Backcountry ski galaw ai**.

Here's why:

The paragraph describes backpacking and backcountry skiing. It mentions the characteristics of backcountry skiing like:

*   Skiing on ungroomed slopes.
*   Steep slopes.
*   Deep powder.

The question asks what kind of skiing is associated with ""n'hkap kadawng ai bum ntsa kaw galaw"" (ungroomed snow travel). This directly aligns with the definition of **backcountry skiing**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hkyen pa jawn bum lung ai** (Skiing on slopes): This is too general and doesn't specifically address the *type* of slope.
*   **C: Alpine lai shingni** (Alpine skiing): This refers to skiing on groomed slopes in ski resorts, which is the opposite of what the paragraph describes.
*   **D: Hkyen jawn na li la ai rai hpai ai** (Skiing on slopes that are relatively easy): This contradicts the descriptions of steep slopes and deep powder in the paragraph.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, grau tsaw chyang shadang de du mayu ai backcountry hkyen pa jawn ai ni hpe hpa gaw lu karum na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Kaja ai masa lam** (The past difficult road).

Here's why:

The passage describes the difficulties of backcountry skiing:

*   It mentions the challenging terrain (""htungdin ja ja ni ra na re"" - very steep, snowy days).
*   It refers to the need for strength and endurance (""bum lung lam langai ngu nna myit la u"" - the backcountry ski path requires strength and stamina).
*   It states that the ski tour involves facing various hardships and requires planning (""kaja ai masa lam ni hta sha lam hkawm ai hta grau tsan ai shara ni hpe nang lu galaw na re"" - to overcome the difficult days, one has to plan and take advantage of favorable weather).
*   It implies that the journey is arduous and challenging.

Option C, ""Kaja ai masa lam"" (The past difficult road) best encapsulates this description of a challenging and arduous backcountry ski tour.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ja ai buk hkyepdin ni** (The day of just a few snowfalls): This is too simplistic. The passage describes much more than just a day with a little snow.
*   **B: Li la ai rai** (Easy road): This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
*   **D: Jasan jaseng da ai lam ni** (A day of joy and happiness): The passage mentions challenges, not joy.



"
Bai shang wa ai kajawng hpa hpe hkrum sha ai bu hkawm ai ni hta hpa mayak nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Mungdan kaga de bu hkawm ai lam (The path of mutual understanding)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the ""honeymoon phase"" of a relationship, characterized by intense attraction, infatuation, and often overlooking flaws.  It then contrasts this with the reality of a long-term relationship where differences emerge and require effort to bridge. 

The question asks how to maintain a good relationship *after* the initial intense phase. The passage emphasizes that a good long-term relationship relies on:

* **Understanding each other's perspectives (C):**  This is the core of maintaining a good relationship. It involves recognizing and appreciating differences, and finding ways to compromise.
* **Navigating conflicting viewpoints (A):** Differences *will* arise.  The ability to discuss and resolve these differences constructively is crucial.
* **Balancing individual needs with the needs of the relationship (B):**  It's important to maintain individuality but also to prioritize the health and well-being of the partnership.
* **Maintaining shared values and goals (D):**  A strong foundation of shared values helps couples navigate challenges together.

However, **mutual understanding (C)** encompasses all these aspects. It's the overarching principle that enables couples to navigate the complexities of a long-term relationship and maintain a good connection.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bai shang wa ai kajawng hpa gaw kaning re bu hkawm ai ni na matu alak mi mayak mahkak byin na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Honeymoon phase kaw du ai bu hkawm ai ni (Honeymoon phase kaw du ai bu hkawm ai ni)**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the stage of a relationship where the partner is deeply attracted and captivated. The passage describes the ""honeymoon phase"" as a time of intense attraction, affection, and a desire to be close.

*   **Option A (Laksan n'kaja ai htunghking hpe mau kajawng ai lam mahkrum madup nga lai wa sai bu hkawm ai ni):** This translates to ""The stage where attraction is strong and the relationship is developing happily."" While related, it doesn't specifically pinpoint the intense, initial attraction of the honeymoon phase.

*   **Option B (Maigan kaw nga ai shaloi lawan ai hku jahtuk lai wa sai bu hkawm ai ni):** This translates to ""The stage where the relationship moves towards a deeper understanding."" This is about moving beyond initial attraction, not the initial phase itself.

*   **Option C (Honeymoon phase kaw du ai bu hkawm ai ni):** This translates directly to ""The honeymoon phase of the relationship."" This perfectly aligns with the passage's description of intense attraction and affection.

*   **Option D (Myit kadun ai bu hkawm ai ni):** This translates to ""The stage of intimacy."" While intimacy can be a part of the honeymoon phase, the passage emphasizes the initial intense attraction more.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided passage."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw shinggyim masha ni hku nna shan krang kaba hpe n mai galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Shanhte a byin mai ai jahkrit shama ai madang hpe shayawm myit ai lam.**

Here's why:

* **P (Question):** This passage describes a situation where a certain ""Shan krang kaba"" (which appears to be some kind of valuable or important thing) has been stolen.  The speaker is asking about the reason or motive behind the theft.

* **Q (Question):** ""Lawu kaw na gara gaw shinggyim masha ni hku nna shan krang kaba hpe n mai galaw ai rai?"" translates to ""What is the reason why the thief stole the Shan krang kaba?""

* **A: Shanhte nga ai lam hpe n-gawn nsawn di ai:** ""They stole it because they were hungry."" This is a possible motive, but the passage doesn't explicitly state hunger.

* **B: Grai gau ngwi hkra shani sa ai lam:** ""They stole it for other reasons."" This is too vague. We need a specific reason.

* **C: Shanhte a byin mai ai jahkrit shama ai madang hpe shayawm myit ai lam:** ""They stole it because they wanted to get money."" This makes the most sense.  A valuable item like ""Shan krang kaba"" would likely be sold for money. The passage implies a financial motive.

* **D: Shanhte hpe tsan ai kaw na masam mayam yu ai:** ""They stole it because they were jealous of someone.""  Jealousy isn't directly mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, option C is the most logical and directly addresses the potential motive behind the theft given the context.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw shan krang kaba ni hte seng nna n teng man ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shinggyim masha ni hku nna shanhte hpe nyi kahtep ai laman jasu alun lu ai**.

Here's why:

* **Understanding the Question (Q):** The question asks about the reason why people (or perhaps a specific group of people referred to as ""lawu kaw na gara"") avoid those who are ""shan krang kaba"" (which seems to refer to someone with a certain reputation or character - the exact nuance is unclear without more context, but it's negative).

* **Understanding the Provided Text (P):** The text describes ""shan krang kaba"" people as being disliked and avoided. It mentions they are considered undesirable and that those who interact with them are often ostracized or face negative consequences.  The core idea is that they are viewed unfavorably.

* **Analyzing the Options:**
    * **A: Shanhte gaw shingra tara hku na jahte tam chye ai dusat ni re** (People avoid those who are wicked and evil).  While ""shan krang kaba"" might imply wickedness, it's not explicitly stated. This option is too strong and doesn't directly address the text's focus.
    * **B: Shanhte hpe kalang marang byin wa mai ai jahkrit shama ai lam hku na nchye na ai** (People are afraid of the consequences of interacting with them). This option mentions fear of consequences, but the text primarily focuses on avoidance due to negative perceptions.
    * **C: Shinggyim masha ni hku nna shanhte hpe nyi kahtep ai laman jasu alun lu ai** (People believe that interacting with those who are ""shan krang kaba"" will bring misfortune). This option aligns perfectly with the text. The text suggests that interacting with ""shan krang kaba"" people leads to negative outcomes and avoidance. The phrase ""nyi kahtep ai laman jasu alun lu ai"" (believe that it brings misfortune) captures the underlying belief driving the avoidance.
    * **D: Ra kadawn ai ten hta shanhte gaw shanhte hkum nan ninghkap makawp maga lu ai** (In the past, people often used customs and traditions to control those who were ""shan krang kaba""). This option refers to past practices. While customs might exist, the question is about the *reason* for the avoidance, not historical methods of control.



**Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly supported by the information provided.**  The avoidance isn't just fear of consequences; it's a belief that interacting with ""shan krang kaba"" individuals will bring bad luck.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw zaibru jang bu hkawm ai wa a matu hkrit shara n'nga dik gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: Dai shingna hpe hkan nna tinang a n-gun jahtum kau ai**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks: ""What is the reason why the earth and the sun, which you are going to see, are not the same as the ones that are not reflected?""  This is asking for the difference between the observed sun and earth and the unseen ones.

* **The passage (P)** describes how we see the sun and earth because of the way light bounces off them.  It mentions that things we see are reflections, and the things we *don't* see are not reflections. It also highlights that the real sun and earth exist beyond what we observe.

* **Option C** directly addresses the core of the passage and the question. It states that the observed sun and earth are the reflected images, while the unseen ones are the original entities.  This perfectly aligns with the passage's explanation of reflections and the real objects behind them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Katsi ai shana hta lum ai bu hpun palawng n'nga ai:** This talks about seeing the sun through a clear sky, which is a descriptive detail and not the underlying reason for the difference in nature between reflected and non-reflected objects.
* **B: Hka a myit hkalem ai hpe byin shangun ai nbung kahtet nna shingna galai hpe mu ai lam:** This describes the process of seeing reflections, not the fundamental reason why reflected objects are distinct.
* **D: Dai shingna hpe hkan nna tinang a hka jahtum kau ai:** This option is similar to C but uses ""hka"" (original/true) which isn't as precise as ""n-gun"" (reflection). While related, ""n-gun"" is more specifically the concept of a reflected image.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and complete answer based on the provided passage and question.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw zai bru jang bu hkawm ai ni a matu byin mai ai mayak hku na n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Kahtet nna shingna galai hpe mu ai lam (The path of seeking the reward for good deeds)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a cycle of karma.** It states that actions (good or bad) create consequences. Good actions lead to positive outcomes and rewards, while bad actions lead to negative outcomes and suffering.
* **Question Q asks about the path that leads to the reward for good deeds.**  The passage explicitly links ""kahtet nna shingna galai ai lam"" (the path of seeking the reward for good deeds) with the idea that good actions will be rewarded.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Hka nlaw nla re ai lam (The path of avoiding evil):** While avoiding evil is part of good conduct, the question specifically asks about *reward* for good deeds, not just avoidance of bad.
    * **C: Hkum lum shadang grai yawm ai lam (The path of rejecting false teachings):** This is about spiritual discernment, not directly about the reward system of karma.
    * **D: Janhkru ai lam (The path of self-discipline):** Self-discipline is helpful, but it's not the defining path to *reward* for good deeds.



Therefore, option B aligns perfectly with the passage's explanation of karma and the question's focus on rewards for positive actions.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, sa du masam maram ai ni du ngut ai hpang gara uhpung masha gaw hkrum machyi kaba byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Taínos ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Caribe ni gaw BCE 10,000 daram na nga hpang nna Arawakan aga shaga ai ni re ma ai. Europa sawk tam maram masha ni du ai hpang shaning kadun laman hta Tainos a masha jahpan hpe gaw dang ka'up sha ai Spain masha ni kawn alak mi re nna shayawm kau ya ai hkrum lai wa sai."" This means the Taínos were the indigenous people of the Caribbean who were greatly impacted by European colonization.
* **The question asks:** ""Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, sa du masam maram ai ni du ngut ai hpang gara uhpung masha gaw hkrum machyi kaba byin ai rai?"" This translates to ""According to historical records, which people suffered the most from the colonizing government?""
* **The passage then details:** The Spanish colonization led to the enslavement and decimation of the Taínos population.

Therefore, the Taínos are the group that suffered the most.
"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara ga hpe Caribe ni shaga ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan ga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Caribe ni gaw BCE 10,000 daram na nga hpang nna Arawakan aga shaga ai ni re ma ai."" This translates to ""The Caribbean was inhabited since 10,000 BC by the Arawakan language family.""

Therefore, the Arawakan people were the original inhabitants of the Caribbean.
"
Hkyen jawn ai hpe ban sa ai sharawng awng bungli hku na mying kaba ai hte seng nna kadai ni hpe shakawn shagrau na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ski bum ni**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the history of skiing, starting from ancient times and mentioning the establishment of skiing clubs in Australia and Norway. The final sentence talks about ""Hkyen pa jawn ginsup lam hpe tsa ban 17 ram kaw na ginsup hpang taw sai hte maren 1861 ning hta shawng nnan myit shalan ski ginsup club hpung hpe Australia mung hta Norway masha ni hpaw hpang dat sai."" which translates to ""The skiing route, 17 miles long, was established in 1861 with the founding of a ski club in Australia and Norway."" The passage then directly states ""Ski bums ngu mung chye da ma ai, sa chyai ai shara ni hta dai hpe lu galaw na matu lazang taw ai,"" meaning ""Ski bums are not afraid, and in snowy days they can walk to the mountains."" This implies that the ""ski bum"" lifestyle, which involves traveling to ski areas, is a key aspect of skiing culture, particularly in snowy conditions.

Therefore, the question asks about the lifestyle associated with skiing, and the answer is ""Ski bum ni"" (Ski bum lifestyle). The other options are related to places where skiing clubs were founded but not the lifestyle itself.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, galoi ten hkan hta hkyen jawn ai hpe shawng ningnan n-gun ginsup ai hku na masat la sai rai?","The correct answer is **B: 5000 BC**.

The text states: ""Shaning 5000 BC hkan na hkyen ntsa jawn ai masha ni hpe lungpu kata na sumla ni hta soi da lai wa sai.""  This translates to ""Since 5000 BC, the history of skiing has been traced back to the early days.""

The question asks when skiing was first practiced. The text directly answers this with 5000 BC.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw sinpraw Africa hkringau mayan na kaba dik ai zunlawng hte baw hpan ginrun taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Uropa lai ka'up ai lam (The impact of European colonization)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Zunlawng kaji malawng hpe shang lawt ai mungdan ni France mungdan hte hpawng chyawm ai lamu ga ni re nna zing hkan shara panglai mayan ni ngu nna mung chye da ma ai.""  This translates to ""The small countries in Africa were divided and conquered by France and other European countries.""
* **The passage also mentions:**  Portugal's voyages and the subsequent European colonization of Africa, leading to the exploitation of resources.
* **The other options are less directly supported:**
    * **B: Islam nawku htung (Islam's spread):** While Islam is mentioned, the passage focuses more on the *European* impact.
    * **C: Dusat dumyeng (Monsoon):** The passage doesn't mention the monsoon significantly as a historical factor.
    * **D: Zinghkam bansa shara ni (The influence of various ethnic groups):**  While ethnic groups are important in Africa, the passage centers on the impact of European colonialism.



Therefore, **European colonization** is the most significant and directly supported answer to the question.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw grau kaji ai sinpraw Africa zunlawng ni a shingkang shingwang n re ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **A: France hte matut mahkai ai lam (The influence of France and other European powers)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Zunlawng kaji malawng hpe shang lawt ai mungdan ni France mungdan hte hpawng chyawm ai lamu ga ni re nna zing hkan shara panglai mayan ni ngu nna mung chye da ma ai"" which translates to ""Foreign powers began to encroach on Africa, especially France, and their influence spread throughout the continent.""
* The passage also mentions Portugal's early involvement, but the dominant influence mentioned is later, particularly that of France.
* The other options are not directly supported by the text:
    * **B: Zinghkam bansa shara law law (Large Asian nations):** The passage focuses on European influence, not Asian.
    * **C: Dusat dumyeng a arawng sadang (The spread of the Muslim faith):** While Islam is mentioned in Comoros and Mayotte, it's not the primary reason for the overall political and territorial changes in Africa.
    * **D: Kaga amyu sha ni kaw na shang lawt lu ai lam (The spread of new religious ideas):**  While religious ideas played a role, the passage mainly emphasizes the political and territorial encroachment by European powers.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, Madu Yesu hkrung rawt wa ai nhtoi hpe htunghking hte seng ai yu maya nawku htingnu nkau mi gara hku poi galaw ma ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Hpung shawa ni na matu mangai htawngshi poi lamang galaw ya ai (Celebrating the birth of the world with the joy of the Epiphany)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses the birth of Jesus and the celebration of the Epiphany.** The text mentions the Epiphany Vigil and the celebration of Jesus' baptism, linking these events to pre-Christian traditions.
* **The question asks what spiritual activities are associated with the birth of Jesus.** Option C directly connects the birth of Jesus (which is the core of the passage) to the joy of the Epiphany and celebrates it with ""spiritual activities.""
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * **A: Htung hkring ni a ahkyak ai hpung htung galaw ai (Celebrating the birth of the world with the movement of the people):** While people celebrate, this option is too broad and doesn't specifically point to spiritual activities.
    * **B: Kru ya shana vigil galaw ai (Celebrating the Epiphany Vigil):** The passage mentions the Epiphany Vigil, but the question asks about the broader spiritual activities *associated with the birth of Jesus*. The Epiphany Vigil is one specific event.
    * **D: Jan pru ten hpe yu ai (Baptizing people):** Jesus' baptism is mentioned, but it's a specific event and not the overarching spiritual activity associated with his birth, as the question implies.

Therefore, option C best captures the spiritual activities related to the birth of Jesus as discussed in the passage."
"Ecuador de shang ai shaloi ra kadawn ai ni hpe koi na matu, Cuban mung masha hku nna hpa baw shawng nga ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Hkrun lam nhkawm shi yang na passport shata 6 nga ra ai**.

The text explicitly states: ""Hkrum lam nhkawm shi yang na passport shata 6 daram nu nga ra ai."" which translates to ""The validity of the passport should be at least 6 months."" This is the requirement mentioned for entering Ecuador from Cuba.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tara shang saw shaga laika (Travel documents for children):** While important for children, it's not the general requirement for all travelers.
* **C: Tinang kade ya nga na hpe sakse madun na matu sa na/wa na pyenli latmat (Having a valid visa):** The text mentions that Cubans don't *need* a visa to enter Ecuador, but a passport valid for at least 6 months is required.
* **D: US kat pa tsit (US travel card):**  While a US travel card can be used for travel to certain countries, it's not directly mentioned as a requirement for entering Ecuador from Cuba. The text focuses on the passport validity.



"
Ecuador na bu hkawm ra ladawn ai gaw gara na matu masat galaw da lam n'nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Passport ni a tara shang ai lam hpe hkrang hkrang tsun ai**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hkrum lam nhkawm shi yang na passport shata 6 daram nu nga ra ai."" This translates to ""Government regulations require passports to be stamped for 6 months."" This directly relates to the requirement of stamping passports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bu hkawm masha hti hkum hpe grit htum galaw da ai lam (Travel is allowed according to the laws of the country):** While generally true, the passage focuses on a *specific* travel regulation, not a general statement about legal travel.
* **B: Htawt ai lam seng nna zinlum ai tsang hte tsang bungli masa hpe hkang zing da ai lam (To bring valuable items and money):** The passage mentions restrictions on carrying large sums of money, but not specifically about valuable items.
* **C: Bu hkawm ai wa a kade ya nga na hpe shagrin ai lam (To be harassed by the country's residents):** The passage doesn't mention harassment as a travel regulation.

Therefore, option D is the only one directly supported by the information in the provided text.
"
Tinang a buga hta grau maigan mung hta hpa gaw grau manu hpu na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Myi jep ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Myi jep ai lam hpe nta kaw galaw ai rai yang, grau nna gaw pahkam gumhpraw ram ai rai yang...""  This translates to: ""If you use the right method, the weight will move, and the [device] will work properly...""

The question asks *how* the weight moves when using the device.  The passage explicitly says ""Myi jep ai lam"" (the right method/way) is what allows the weight to move.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mying kaba ai hkring ni (the brand of the [device])**: The passage mentions brands, but it's the *method* of use that's key to the weight moving, not the brand.
* **C: Shingran pahkam (scientific principle)**: While a scientific principle might *explain* the movement, the passage doesn't focus on it. It focuses on the method of *use*.
* **D: Mying nkaba ai brand hkrang (purchasing the brand)**:  The passage doesn't mention that purchasing a specific brand is necessary for the weight to move.



"
Maigan mung hta mying kaba ai hkrang ni hpe mari yang shoihpa byin chye ai hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bungjat myi jep ai lam ra wa na.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the speaker's preferences for clothing:** They prefer simple, comfortable clothing made from natural materials. They avoid bright colors and flashy brands.  They prioritize practicality and comfort.
* **The question asks about the type of clothing they would choose for a formal occasion.**
* **Option A directly aligns with this preference.**  ""Bungjat myi jep ai lam ra wa na"" translates to something like ""Simple, comfortable, naturally-made clothing."" This fits the speaker's described style.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nkau hkrang ni na matu tsi matsun ai lam n mai byin ai** (Clothing made of fancy materials or with bright patterns):  This directly contradicts the speaker's aversion to bright colors and flashy brands.
* **C: Nkau ni gaw masu rai byin chye ai** (Formal, elegant clothing): This is too formal for the speaker's preference for simple and comfortable clothing.
* **D: Jarik na matu pahkam gumhpraw nlaw ai** (Clothing made of expensive materials): While the speaker prefers natural materials, they don't specifically prioritize expensive ones.  The focus is on simplicity and comfort.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that logically follows from the passage's descriptions of the speaker's clothing preferences."
"Falklands hta jai gumhpraw hte seng nna, lawu kaw na gara gaw jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: British pound gumhpraw hte hkoi shap card ni hpe sha htingjut htingnaw zunlawng hta hkap la ai**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""British pound gumhpraw hpe law malawng gaw zinlawng shara shagu jai lang mai nna, Stanley hkoi shap card hte US dollar ni hpe mung jahkring hkring jai lang mai ma ai."" This translates to: ""British pound currency is widely accepted, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted for payment.""

Option A accurately reflects this information. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **B:** The text says US dollars are accepted, not that Stanley *only* accepts them.
*   **C:** The text indicates that the Falkland Pound is accepted, but it's generally used for larger transactions.
*   **D:** The text does not imply that the Falkland Pound is worthless. It's a valid currency.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, United States kaw na Falkland de bu hkawm yang, hkoi shap card hte n re sha, gumhpraw jaw ai lam ladat gaw gara ni hkan akyu byin na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Sinna FIC seng kaw (Since FIC is used)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Stanley hkoi shap card hte US dollar ni hpe mung jahkring hkring jai lang mai ma ai."" This translates to ""In Stanley, FIC cards and US dollars are commonly accepted.""  ""Sinna FIC seng kaw"" (Since FIC is used) directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Zunlawng shara shagu kaw (Since the exchange rate is fluctuating):** While the text mentions the British Pound's fluctuating rate, it doesn't focus on *that* as the main reason for the acceptance of FIC.
* **C: Htingjut htingnaw zunlawng ni hkan (Since the historical exchange rate):**  The text doesn't discuss historical rates.
* **D: Stanley shara shagu (Since Stanley is common):**  While Stanley is a key location, the reason for accepting FIC isn't *just* because it's common there. It's because FIC is *used* there.



"
Nawku htingnu poi shingra galaw ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara lamang gaw ginrun ai lam n'nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lamu kasa num a shangai nhtoi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nawku jawng a lamu kasa num a shangai nhtoi (sh)"" - This translates to ""Nawku jawng's lamu kasa num is [what] it is.""  The passage is describing the nature of the Nawku's wisdom.
* **The question asks:** ""Nawku htingnu poi shingra galaw ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara lamang gaw ginrun ai lam n'nga ai rai?"" - This translates to ""What is the method/way that the Nawku's wisdom is realized and made known?""  It's asking about how the wisdom is accessed or understood.
* **Option C directly relates to this:**  ""Lamu kasa num a shangai nhtoi"" which translates to ""the way of the inner/hidden wisdom."" This directly addresses how the Nawku's wisdom is accessed – through a deeper, internal understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Magwi langai shangai ai lam (The way of the spoken word):** While communication is important, the passage emphasizes inner wisdom and understanding, not just spoken words.
* **B: Nawku htingnu na ladu hkrum nhtoi (The way of the enlightened form):**  This refers to the physical manifestation of enlightenment, not how the wisdom itself is realized.
* **D: Nawku htingnu lawm ai poi lamang ni (The way of the enlightened's realization):**  This is too broad.  The passage focuses on the nature of the wisdom itself, not just how enlightenment is realized.



"
Shatsawm da ai magwi hpe gara kaw mu lu mai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: November shata htum kaw na May shata ka'ang laman shara shagu hta**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Shatsawm da ai magwi hpe gara kaw mu lu mai rai?"" which translates to ""What is the reason for the harvest being poor?"".

The text states: ""Nawku jawng law malawng gaw November kaw na May shata ka-ang hkra Shaning shagu na lamang nga ai re nna nbung ai nawku jawng shagu hta mahta nna shaning shagu na ladaw shana ni mung nbung ma ai.""  This translates to ""The poor harvest is due to the lack of rain from November to May. The soil is dry because of the lack of rain during that time, and the crops have not been able to grow.""

Therefore, the primary reason for the poor harvest is the lack of rain from November to May. Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nawku htingnu ni hkan (The end of the rainy season):** While the rainy season ending contributes to the dry soil, it's not the *reason* for the poor harvest itself. The lack of rain *during* the growing season is the direct cause.
* **C: Nawku htingnu poi lamang na yan ganawng hkawm ai shara ni hkan (The end of the rainy season and the start of the dry season):**  Similar to B, this describes a transition but doesn't pinpoint the direct cause of the poor harvest.
* **D: Kerala lam ni hkan (The days of Kerala):** This is irrelevant to the reason for the poor harvest; the text specifically refers to the Shaning region.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hpaga madang (sh) ningshawng madang pyenli manu gumhpraw shayawm na matu byin mai dik ai lam rai?","The correct answer is **B: Hpaga madang n re sha ningshawng madang hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari na**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how high-end business class travelers prioritize comfort and convenience. They are willing to spend a lot of money for a smoother journey and a more enjoyable experience.  The question asks what is the primary reason for this spending.

Option B, ""Hpaga madang n re sha ningshawng madang hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari na"" (Focusing on both comfort and convenience), directly aligns with the passage's emphasis on a better, more relaxed journey.  The passage highlights both the physical comfort (reclining seats, spaciousness) and the overall experience (priority service, amenities) that justify the high cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tinang bungli galaw ai hpaga hpung ni hku na lakmat mari na** (Focusing on the smoothness of the flight itself): While a smooth flight is desirable, the passage emphasizes the *overall experience* and comfort, not *just* the flight's technical performance.
* **C: Kalang ta n re ai ningshawng madang pyenli hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari na** (Focusing on personal preferences and flexibility): While personalization is a factor, it's not the primary driver of the high cost described in the passage. The passage highlights the standardized luxurious amenities.
* **D: Shayawm manu tam na** (Having many seats):  This is irrelevant. The passage focuses on the *quality* of the seats and the overall experience, not the seat quantity.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw nkau manu pyenli madang ni hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari ai shaloi aten jahtum byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shayawm manu ni** (Dreamy day).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a ""dreamy day"" (shayawm manu ni)** as a day when you can relax, enjoy yourself, and spend money on things you want. It mentions traveling, enjoying beautiful scenery, and treating yourself to luxuries.
* **The question asks about the day that best fits the description of spending money on desires and enjoying relaxation.**  ""Dreamy day"" aligns perfectly with this.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Kalang ta re ai pyenli ni (A day full of activities):** While a ""dreamy day"" might include activities, the core emphasis is on relaxation and personal enjoyment, not necessarily a packed schedule.
* **B: Hpaga madang (Calm day):** A ""dreamy day"" can be calm, but it also involves enjoyment and spending. Calmness is only one aspect.
* **D: Ningshawng madang (Exciting day):**  While a ""dreamy day"" can be exciting in some ways (travel, new experiences), the primary feeling described is more about peaceful enjoyment and fulfilling desires, not sheer excitement.

* **The passage states:** ""Africa shingan na dai shara yawng a matu mungdan shang lakmat, pru wa hkang se, ga ntsa htaw wa htaw sa lam, sh.r.n a matu shajan hkrat na manu ni hpe bang shalawm na hkum malap."" This translates to: ""Africa, while having a young population, is facing a serious situation of poverty, hunger, and lack of basic necessities for its citizens.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Afrika shinggan de na shara ni de sa na mungdan shang lakmat a matu manu jarik:** This is too broad. While people are migrating, the passage focuses on *why* people are migrating, namely due to difficult living conditions.
* **B: Afrika hta pru wa na ahkun hkanse:** This translates to ""Africa is rich in resources."" The passage *contradicts* this by stating poverty and lack of basic necessities.
* **C: Afrika mungdan shang lakmat manu:** This translates to ""African people migrating."" While migration is happening, the passage asks about the *reasons* behind the migration.



Therefore, option D accurately reflects the passage's explanation of the drivers behind migration from Africa.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, gat seng kaba ni jaw hpang ai grau na lata la hpa gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: Ready-made lusha ni**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where someone (gat seng kaba ni) is looking for a place to stay.  It mentions that ready-made lusha (pre-fabricated houses) are available.  The question asks what gat seng kaba ni would use if they couldn't find a place to stay. The passage explicitly states ""ready-made lusha ni sha sha ra na malawng ai"" (ready-made lushas are available).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Lawan shadu myihprap wanhtung ni:** This refers to a specific type of house (a house built with mud and bamboo) mentioned as not being suitable for the person.
*   **C: Seng kaba kata hkan na lusha seng ni:** This refers to houses built with materials that are not available.
*   **D: Dang di lu ai manu:** This refers to a type of person who doesn't want to be a tenant, it doesn't provide a solution for where the person will stay.



"
Gat seng kaba ni kaw na jaw ai kaning re htap htuk ai gaw ready-made lusha tut mari ai ni hpe shalen mai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Lusha katsing**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where someone is looking for a ""ready-made lusha"" (a type of food, likely a traditional dish).** The question asks about what kind of ready-made lusha they are looking for.
* **Option C, ""Lusha katsing"" (ready-made lusha), directly addresses this need.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seng kaba kata hkan na lusha seng ni (Not the lusha of a certain family):** This is irrelevant to the question of *what kind* of lusha they are seeking.
* **B: Lata na lam nau n nga ai (On the roadside):** This describes a location, not the type of food.
* **D: Lawan shadu myihprap wanhtung (With a strong, spicy flavor):** While the passage mentions strong flavors, it doesn't specify that's the *only* or even the *primary* characteristic the person is looking for in a ready-made lusha.



"
Lawu kaw na gara hpe French ga shaga ai Belgian hte Swiss ni lachyum nchye na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: French madang jat hti hkum nambat masa** (The majority of French speakers are second-language speakers).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Belgium hte Switzerland na French ga shaga ai ni gaw France mungdan na French ga shaga ai hte kaji mi shai hkat nna gasi nkau nsen shapraw ai hta mung loi shai ma ai."" (The French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is often not as good as the French spoken in France.) and ""Belgian hte Swiss ni yang jawng kaw French madang jat jat hpe sharin ra ai re, dai rai jang she shanhte gaw nang lang ai French madang nambat ni hpe chye na ra re."" (Belgians and Swiss people learn French as a second language, and therefore their French is often not as fluent as the native speakers).

This indicates that the vast majority of French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland *learn* French as a second language, not that it's their first language.  Therefore, they are largely second-language speakers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Laklai ai French ga hkum ni** (The majority of French is official language) - While French is an official language in both countries, this doesn't explain *why* the French spoken there is often less fluent.
* **C: Nkau French gasi ni a ga nsen** (Good French is a very rare thing) - This is too extreme. While quality might vary, it's not rare. Many people speak French well.
* **D: France mung kaw na French masha ni shaga ai ga** (It is the French spoken in France) - This is irrelevant. The question asks about *Belgian and Swiss* French.



Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that **French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland are mostly second-language speakers.** This makes option A the correct answer.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Belgium (sh) Switzerland hte France n bung ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Jawng ni kaw sharin ya ai French madang (The shared language of neighboring countries)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Belgium and Switzerland share French as a language with France. It also mentions that while the majority of French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland are influenced by French from France, they still maintain their own distinct French dialects.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gasi ni yawng a nsen (Mutual economic dependence):** The passage doesn't mention any significant economic dependence between Belgium, Switzerland, and France.
*   **B: Hti hkum nambat masa (Common political system):** The passage doesn't discuss any shared political systems.
*   **D: Nkau French gasi ni a shachyawm masa (Similarity in the good aspects of French):** While there might be similarities in the good aspects of French, the passage focuses on the shared language itself, not just positive qualities.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the main point of the passage regarding the relationship between Belgium, Switzerland, and France - they share the French language."
Kaning re mabyin masa hta tinang gaw yawn hkyen shayawm manu n lu chye rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Third-party magam malai pyenli hpaga hpung hte kalang ta tau hkrau lakmat mari yang.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lam shagu hta, tau hkrau lakmat mari ai lam hpe sin-yu ga (phone) hte dantawk tau htet ra ai."" (For the convenience of travelers, you can book through third-party agencies (phone and internet).)
* **The question asks:** ""Kaning re mabyin masa hta tinang gaw yawn hkyen shayawm manu n lu chye rai?"" (What is the reason why people prefer to book flights through third-party agencies?)
* **The text implies:** The reason is for convenience and flexibility. Third-party agencies offer a wider range of options and booking methods (phone, internet).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: WestJet hte pyen hkawm yang:**  The text mentions WestJet as an airline, but not specifically as a reason people prefer third-party bookings.
* **C: Lufthansa hte Paris kaw na United States du hkra pyen hkawm yang:** The text mentions Lufthansa as an airline, but not specifically as a reason people prefer third-party bookings.
* **D: Delta hte pyen hkawm yang:**  Similar to A and C, the text mentions Delta as an airline, but not as the primary reason for using third-party agencies.



"
Yawn hkyen shayawm manu hte seng nna gara wa jaw rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Hpang chyhtum aten na manu hpe lu makawp ai** (You can book tickets online).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""U.S dai nrai Canada, ngut nna WestJet kaw na npawt wa ai Air Canada, Delta Air Line, Lufthansa ni lawm ai ni hpe jaw da ai nbungli bungli. Lam shagu hta, tau hkrau lakmat mari ai lam hpe sin-yu ga (phone) hte dantawk tau htet ra ai."" (From the U.S. to Canada, you can book tickets with WestJet, Air Canada, Delta Air Line, Lufthansa, and other airlines. Also, you can book tickets online (via computer) and via phone.)
* **Question:** ""Yawn hkyen shayawm manu hte seng nna gara wa jaw rai?"" (How can you book tickets?)
* **Option C directly reflects the information in the passage:**  It mentions booking tickets online, which is explicitly stated as an option.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Moi mang ma-koi mayang lam jarik hpe lu makawp ai** (You can book through travel agencies) - While travel agencies *can* book flights, the passage focuses on *online* booking as well.
* **B: Pyeli internet laika man ginsu kaw tau hkrau lakmat mari ra ai** (You can search for information on the internet and then book) -  This is a more general description of the process but doesn't pinpoint the method of booking.
* **D: Pyenli hpaga hpung de phone hte kalang ta tau hkrau lakmat mari ra ai** (You can call and book via phone) - The passage *does* mention phone booking, but option C is a more comprehensive answer because it also includes online booking.



"
Galoi ten hta langai hkrai lang GPS gaw lam madun ai GPS app hta grau htuk manu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Tinang hta phone kaw internet hte matut ya ai lam nga na re ngu teng yang.**

Here's why:

The passage states that when GPS is unable to get a signal, the phone relies on the internet to determine its location.  Option B directly reflects this statement.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gumhpraw mahkawng na matu shakut taw yang:** This is too general and not specific to the passage's explanation of GPS alternatives.
* **C: Masat da ai a shinggan de sa na rai yang:**  This refers to battery power and isn't directly related to GPS signal issues.
* **D: Jak rai n kam shap yang:** This is unclear and doesn't align with the passage's explanation.



Therefore, option B accurately summarizes the passage's point about the phone using the internet when GPS is unavailable."
Langai hkrai lang GPS hpe ning hkap nna lam madun ai GPS hpe lang na matu madi madun kaja n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Lamu ga sumla nnan mari n ra yang (Turn off the location services)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how apps constantly track your location even when you're not actively using them, using internet and GPS.  To stop this tracking, you need to disable the location services.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Phone kaw internet hte matut na lam hpe myit n'tsang ra yang (Turn off phone internet):** While turning off the internet *can* help reduce location tracking, it's not the most direct or complete solution. Some location tracking can still occur without active internet use.
* **B: Gumhpraw mahkawng mayu yang (Turn off background app refresh):**  This is a helpful step, but not the main solution to stop constant GPS tracking.
* **C: Shap sha ai lam hpe koi yen mayu yang (Disable location permissions for apps):** This is also helpful, but disabling location services altogether is the most effective way to prevent constant GPS tracking.

Therefore, turning off location services (lamu ga sumla nnan mari n ra yang) is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, tinang hte htap htuk ai sanghpaw hte re ngu gara hku pahkam hkam lu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Galapagos bu hkawm magam hta alak kaja ai kasa hte tau hkrau latmak mari na**

Here's why:

The passage states that Darwin observed finches on the Galapagos Islands with beaks adapted to different food sources.  He noted that these beaks were different depending on the island.  This is a key part of his theory of evolution by natural selection – different environments lead to different adaptations.

Option C directly reflects this:  The finches on the Galapagos Islands had beaks adapted to the food available on each island.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Myit lawm ai lam bung ai bu hkawm masha 8 jan uhpung kaw tau hkrau latmak mari na** (The 8 species of birds that are adapted to the forest) - This is incorrect because the passage focuses on the Galapagos finches, not forest birds.
* **B: Masha nau nhpring ai shata kaw tau hkrau latmak mari na** (The 60 species of birds that are newly emerged) -  While new species can emerge, the passage isn't about newly emerged species, it's about adapted species on different islands.
* **D: Tau hkrau na shawng htet da na** (The species that are unrelated) - This isn't directly supported by the passage.  Darwin's observations suggested a relationship *between* the finches on different islands due to their beak adaptations.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, du sa manam ni hpaida matut ginsup na matu gara lai ladat hpe n jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shingra ninghtoi ntaw ntsang**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is the reason for the people of the Shan state being wary of the Kayan people, even though the Kayan are generally peaceful and hardworking. The passage states:

""Shanhte gaw manam ni hpe kaja ai myit hkam sha ai lam lu na matu hte shanhte hpe seng kata kaw na na wa nga shangun lu na matu alak mi re ai lu sha, lu hpa hte shangwi shapyaw ai lam ni hpe law malawng lu ma ai.""

This translates to: ""The Shan people are wary of the Kayan people because they have a history of fighting and conflict, and because they have historically been involved in looting and causing destruction, leading to the Shan people being hesitant to trust them.""

Therefore, the reason for the Shan people's wariness is their **past history of conflict and destructive behavior**. Option A, ""Shingra ninghtoi ntaw ntsang"" (a new and unfamiliar situation), best encapsulates the Shan people's feeling of uncertainty and distrust due to this history.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Manu n jaw ra ai yungwi pinra latmat zawn re shalen ai lam ni** (A situation where many people are easily fooled): The passage doesn't suggest the Kayan are easily fooled.
* **C: Bungjat luhpa ni** (A difficult situation): While the past history might be difficult, the passage focuses on the distrust, not the difficulty.
* **D: Ahkying hkum madun jak n nga ai** (An attack from a neighboring state): The passage doesn't mention an attack from a neighboring state as the reason for the Shan people's wariness of the Kayans.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, ram ai hpaida ginsup ai wa gaw kaning re hpe koi yen na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ahkying hkum madun jak (sh) lahkawn nayi jep yu ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation of difficult circumstances:** The first paragraph talks about hardships, suffering, and a lack of happiness. It mentions a need to endure and persevere through challenges.
* **The question asks about a potential solution to overcome those hardships:** ""How can we overcome the difficulties and reach a better future?""
* **Option C (""Ahkying hkum madun jak (sh) lahkawn nayi jep yu ai"" - To seek the guidance of wise and experienced people)** directly addresses the need for help and wisdom in overcoming difficulties.  Seeking guidance from those who have navigated similar challenges is a common and effective approach to finding solutions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tsa grai lu ai (It's not possible)** - This is too pessimistic and doesn't align with the encouragement to persevere found in the passage.
* **B: Shalen ai hpa raitim hkap la ai (To rely on luck and chance)** - Relying on luck isn't a proactive solution to hardship; it's passive.
* **D: Kahtep dik ai pru lam hpe san ai (To walk on a straight path)** - This is a metaphorical statement that doesn't directly address the complexities of overcoming challenges.  Life rarely follows a straight path.



Therefore, option C is the most logical and fitting response to the question posed in relation to the passage.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, laika yen ka'ang hta gara lik tara dawsang hpe laika si kaba hte lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Shabyin shadan ni**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""When the child is in distress, what is the child's usual behavior towards the parents?"" (Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, laika yen ka'ang hta gara lik tara dawsang hpe laika si kaba hte lang ai rai?)

* **The text states:** ""Ndai gaw ga shabyin hte ga hkam lapran hpe garan ginhka lu na matu ahkyak ai lam langai re.""  This translates to ""It is in distress and suffering, and its cries are always heard, and it crawls on the ground.""  This indicates the child *usually* behaves in a distressed/suffering manner.

* **The text also states:** ""Ndai gaw laika hti loi na hku galaw ya ai."" This translates to ""It is also prone to crying out.""  This reinforces the idea of distress being a usual state.

* **""Shabyin shadan ni"" (distressful/suffering day)** best captures the meaning of the child's usual behavior when in distress.  It combines the concept of suffering (""shabyin"") with the fact that it's a typical state (""shadan ni"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga shabyin ni (distressful day):**  This is too limited. The question asks about behavior *towards the parents* in distress. While the child *is* distressed, the option doesn't specify the behavior directed at the parents.
* **B: Shingteng ni (adventurous day):** This is the opposite of the described behavior. The child is *not* adventurous when in distress; they are suffering.
* **C: Shingteng shadan ni (adventurous/suffering day):** This is also incorrect.  ""Adventurous"" is completely out of sync with the description of a child in distress.



Therefore, **D: Shabyin shadan ni (distressful/suffering day)** is the most accurate and complete answer."
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, shingteng hpe laika si kaba hte ka ai gaw hpa hpe grau yak shangun ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Ga hkam lapran garan ginhka yang**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason why the younger generation (laika hta ka da ai hte maren) and the older generation (shingteng hpe laika si kaba hte ka ai) have different opinions regarding the importance of studying (hpa hpe grau yak shangun ai rai?).
* **The text states:** ""Ndai gaw ga shabyin hte ga hkam lapran hpe garan ginhka lu na matu ahkyak ai lam langai re."" This translates to: ""They are on a path of disagreement regarding the importance of studying and career opportunities.""
* **The text also states:** ""Raitim, laika ka ai lam hta gaw hkrang langai a ga shabyin ni, shingteng shadan ni gara hku lang da ai hpe chye ra ai majaw loi yak ai hpe mu lu ai."" This means: ""However, on the younger generation's side, it is often seen that they are not paying attention to the important aspects and are not willing to accept the established ways of the older generation.""

Therefore, the root of the disagreement is the differing views on the importance of studying and career paths – a disagreement related to *ga hkam lapran garan ginhka yang* (disagreement regarding career opportunities).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Laika hti yang (Younger generation is correct):** The text doesn't say the younger generation is *correct*, only that their views differ.
* **B: Ga shabyin ni lapran garan ginhka yang (Disagreement regarding career opportunities):** While related, this isn't the *reason* for the disagreement; it's a *topic* of disagreement. Option D is a more complete and accurate explanation.
* **C: Laika ka yang (Younger generation is the reason):** Similar to A, the text doesn't definitively state the younger generation *causes* the disagreement.



"
"""Malaysia kahtawng ningchyawng shara ni kaw, gara lagaw lata kumla gaw """"sa wa u le"""" ngu ai rai?""","The correct answer is **D: Lata yungnu hpe sharawt ai (Giving a high-five)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explains that the phrase ""sa wa u le"" in Malaysia is a greeting derived from a historical interaction between British and Spanish traders.  The text explicitly states it evolved from a gesture of greeting, which is described as ""ta madun ai wa hpe lata galam dan ai"" - meaning something like ""a gesture of mutual greeting and agreement.""  This is equivalent to a high-five.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yunglat hpe kahpam magaw ai (Giving a thumbs-up):** While a thumbs-up can be a gesture of agreement, the text doesn't mention it.
*   **B: Lata ding si ai (Shaking hands):**  The text doesn't mention handshakes.
*   **C: High-five galaw ai (High-fiving):** While a high-five is a possibility, the text refers to ""lata yungnu hpe sharawt ai"" which is a more precise description of the origin of the greeting. ""Sharawt ai"" specifically implies a gesture of meeting or greeting.

"""Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara lagaw lata kumla gaw """"bai sa wa u"""" nga tsun ai rai?""","The correct answer is **C: Lata lahpan shinggan de shayawn na ding si ai**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Regarding the reason for the phrase ""bai sa wa u"" being used, after a certain period of time, what is the explanation?""
* **The text explains:** The phrase ""bai sa wa u"" originated from a time when the British and Spanish were warring, and people would say it to avoid being caught in the crossfire. 
* **""Lata lahpan shinggan de shayawn na ding si ai""** translates to ""It is understood that it's due to a change in circumstances.""  This fits the context perfectly – the phrase's origin is tied to a historical event (warring nations), and the change in circumstances is the cessation of that war and the eventual adoption of the phrase as a greeting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lata lahpan kata de shayawn na ding si ai** (It is understood that it's due to a certain explanation) - This is too vague. The text provides a specific explanation.
* **B: Yunglat hpe kahpam magaw ai** (It's due to a good deed) -  There's no mention of a good deed in the text related to the origin of the phrase.
* **D: Baw kanga ai** (It's a coincidence) - The text clearly states the phrase has a historical origin and wasn't a random occurrence.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, hkyen ugang ga kaprang hpa majaw byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Kadawng daw taw ai hka ge lung pu ni**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""What makes the heart of the person who has been treated with respect (hkyen ugang ga kaprang hpa majaw byin ai rai) feel uneasy (majaw byin ai)?""

The passage describes the feelings of a person who has been treated with disrespect and humiliation:

* **Hkyen hka ni gaw zim sha nnga ai nna bum ntsa kaw lwi hrat wa chye ai:**  The person feels humiliated and ashamed.
* **Ndai lam ni gaw hkyen mahkrai ni hpe lim kau nna ga ai lam ni, ga kaprang ai lam ni byin wa chye ai:** The person feels isolated and ostracized.
* **Hka ge lung pu a shakum ni, n-gaw ni gaw hkrat kadawng daw mai ai hte de a ga hkang ni gaw rau majaw mat mai ai:** The person's heart is broken, and the people around them are kind, but it doesn't alleviate their distress; it intensifies their sadness.
* **Hkatawng mali hka ndung kaw na tawng kaba kaw ga hkrat ai, dik hkrat ai ngut nna ndung kaw na gumhtawn dai nrai taleng wa ai rai na re:**  Even if respected and treated with kindness, the person still feels deeply hurt.

Therefore, the passage explicitly states that the uneasy feeling comes from the **broken heart** (lung pu shakum ni) of the person treated with disrespect, even amidst kindness from others. Option C directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hkyen mahkrai ni (Respectful person):** This isn't the source of the unease; it's the *lack* of respect that causes it.
* **B: Zim sha n'nga ai hkyen hka ni (Person who is humiliated):** Humiliation is a *feeling* caused by disrespect, not the *reason* for the unease.  The passage elaborates on *why* that feeling of humiliation leads to unease.
* **D: Tawng kaba ga hkrat ai (People who are kind):** Kindness is mentioned as *not* relieving the sadness, so they aren't the source of the unease.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen mahkrai ni hku na magap da mai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Shakum ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the person's heart as being ""shakum ni"" (shaking/trembling).**  The passage states, ""Hka ge lung pu a shakum ni..."" which directly translates to ""Their heart was shaking/trembling...""

* **The question asks what is described as trembling.** The question asks, ""Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen mahkrai ni hku na magap da mai rai?"" which roughly translates to ""Even when facing danger and death, what is described as shaking?""  The answer to this is the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga ai lam ni (Their path/way):** The passage talks about their actions and feelings, not their path.
* **B: Hka ge lung pu ni (Their heart/spirit):** While related, the passage explicitly says the heart is *shaking*.  ""Lung pu ni"" is the general term for heart/spirit.
* **D: Tawng kaba ni (Their words):** The passage doesn't discuss their words.



Therefore, **shakum ni (shaking/trembling)** is the most accurate answer because it's directly stated in the passage and answers the question about what is trembling.

"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, bu hkawn ai ni hku na gara shara de bu hkawm yang bungjat shawng sadi jaw ai lam hpe hkan nang ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Nyiragongo wanbum**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the eruption of the Nyiragongo volcano as a major event that devastated Goma.  The question asks what the area is known for due to this event. The passage explicitly states that the eruption of Nyiragongo ""bum kaw na wanbum nhpat majaw hten za mat ai"" (caused widespread destruction).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Goma grupyin shara ni:** While Goma was affected, the eruption itself was caused by Nyiragongo. The group in Goma isn't the *reason* for the notoriety.
* **C: Mare ka'ang:** This refers to the ""area affected"" which is too general. The specific place known for the eruption is Nyiragongo.
* **D: Rwanda:** Rwanda is a country, and while it borders Goma, the eruption itself was in the Nyiragongo area.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Goma kaw na mungkan bu hkawn ai wa na matu kaja ai ga machyan n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Nyiragongo wanbum na htumpa gaw mare kata hta nga ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""2002 kaw Goma gaw grau nna mare kaba ka'ang na lam nmaw malawng hpe nat jahkru kau ya ai Nyiragongo wan bum kaw na wanbum nhpat majaw hten za mat ai. Dai mare kaba mung Afrika na manu hkyak sa dik ai Gorilla Bum lung ai zawn sha Nyiragongo wan bum de lung na matu npawt re.""
* **Translation:** ""In 2002, Goma became a base for rebels who seized control of the North Kivu region and launched attacks on Nyiragongo, which was a major rebel stronghold.  Since then, Goma has been a place where people traveling to the areas where the endangered mountain gorillas live, towards Nyiragongo, are also attacked.""
* **Therefore:** The attacks in Goma are primarily related to the rebels' control of the North Kivu region *and* their presence in Nyiragongo, where people are traveling to see the gorillas.  The explosions/attacks originating from Nyiragongo are a key factor driving these incidents.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: North Kivu na gasat gala ai ni shangwi shapyaw taw nga ai:** While instability in North Kivu contributes, it doesn't fully explain *why* Goma is a target.
* **B: Manu hkyam sa Gorilla Bum lung na matu kaja ai shara re:**  Gorilla tourism *increases* the risk of attacks, but it's not the sole reason. The rebels' control and presence are more central.
* **C: Mawdaw sengke ni gaw hkawm sa matu kaja ai:**  While armed groups are involved, the passage focuses more on the *location* of the attacks (Nyiragongo) and the rebels' control.

* The passage states: ""Dai ni gaw **shawng nnan walk-in shawng htet ai lam hta mare kade ngu galaw da ai re**.""  This translates to ""On that day, **it is possible to camp by walk-in trail**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shawng du, shawng htet ahkaw ahkang masa:**  ""On the day, it is possible to camp by a group of tents."" This is not directly supported by the passage. The passage focuses on the *walk-in* aspect of camping.
* **B: January shata 1st ya kaw sha ahkaw ahkang mai lu ai:** ""On January 1st, it is possible to camp by the river."" The passage mentions January 1st as the start of reservations for Phantom Ranch, but it doesn't say you can camp *by the river* on that date.
* **D: Shadang masat da ai ahkaw ahkang:** ""By a shaded area.""  The passage doesn't discuss shaded areas as a specific camping option.

"Laika hta tsun da ai manam dap hpan ni hta, lawu kaw na gara hpe mu na masa yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: mying kaba ai (sh)matsing masat hkrum ai manang manam ni**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a state of mental distress and confusion.** It mentions a feeling of being lost, unable to think clearly, and experiencing a disconnect from reality. The phrases ""lutsu ai ngut nna mying kaba ai shani kaw nga wa ai shara kaw nga ai re"" and ""ngut nna dai kaw shana shat ni kaja ai ngut nna shana mung grai pyaw ai re"" highlight this.
* **Option C, ""mying kaba ai (sh)matsing masat hkrum ai manang manam ni"" translates to ""a clear-headed (though) confused state of mind.""** This accurately reflects the mental state described in the passage. The ""mying kaba ai"" (clear-headed) acknowledges a glimmer of awareness, while ""masat hkrum ai manam ni"" (confused state of mind) captures the core issue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tsa gayau bar (Absolutely not):** This is a denial and doesn't address the question of how to deal with the mental distress.
* **B: Manam dap kaw lusha kaja mai lu ai seng (It doesn't help to simply accept the mental distress):** While accepting the distress might not be a *solution*, the passage doesn't suggest that acceptance is the primary problem. The focus is on the confusion and lack of clarity.
* **D: Prat dep madang sharawt da ai hte gram shatsawm da ai yup gawk ni (A strong and decisive action to manage the situation):** The passage doesn't describe a situation that calls for a strong, decisive action. It describes a state of being overwhelmed and confused.



Therefore, option C is the most appropriate answer because it directly addresses the described mental state.
"
"Laika hta tang madun da ai zawn, lawu kaw na sak jaw ai ni hta manam masha ni hku na ningshawng jaw masat na yawm dik gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **D: Manu jarik hkam lu ai gawk manu (The man who doesn't know the value of his life)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph describes a person who lived a life of luxury and indulgence, neglecting their responsibilities and failing to appreciate the importance of hard work and perseverance. They squandered their resources and didn't understand the consequences of their actions.

The question asks what fate awaits someone who lives this way. The paragraph concludes by stating that such a person will ultimately face hardship and regret (""manam jarik law law hta nga na re"" - the man who doesn't know the value of his life will eventually suffer).

Option D directly reflects this outcome.  The other options don't align with the paragraph's depiction of the person's ultimate fate.

"Laika hta tang madun da ai zawn, Greenland de bu hkawm ai ni hku nna hpa hpe koi yen ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Internet matut mahkai ai lam gaw kaprip kaprap re majaw, dai shara kaw bungli galaw na myit mada ai**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Mare nhtawng ni hkan e mung laja lana re ai gin ra ni mung n-nga ai re. Katsi ai lamu marang masa gaw hkyen lajang da ai lam n nga ai ni hkrum sha chye ai shoihpa langai rai nga ai. Ginhtawng ta na nhtoi galu ai lam ni gaw yup nhkru ai manghkang ni byin shangun nna dai hte seng ai hkam ja lam manghkang ni hpe byin shangun nga ai. Ginhtawng ta hta e, Nordic (Uropa dan hte seng ai) jigrawng ni hpe mung sadi ra ai. Dai ni gaw ana li n shabra tim pyi kaprep ai, machyi ai lam byin chye ai.""  This describes the impact of the internet and Nordic influence on Greenlandic culture, leading to changes in traditional ways of life. The text also points out that Greenlanders are increasingly exposed to and influenced by modern communication and technology. The text also states that Greenland is no longer referred to as ""Eskimo"".



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Upadi"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Greenland de sa du ai jau hkyen lajang da lam n'nga ai bu hkawm ni na matu mayak kaba byin na lam grau dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: Nordic jigrawng ni**.

The text explicitly states: ""Katsi ai lamu marang masa gaw hkyen lajang da ai lam n nga ai ni hkrum sha chye ai shoihpa langai rai nga ai. Ginhtawng ta hta e, Nordic (Uropa dan hte seng ai) jigrawng ni pe mung sadi ra ai. Dai ni gaw ana li n shabra tim pyi kaprep ai, machyi ai lam byin chye ai.""

This translates to: ""The strong winds blow from the north. Also, the Nordic (European and other) winds blow. These winds are strong and persistent.""

Therefore, the strong winds that blow in Greenland are Nordic winds.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw madung gat ginra hku nna jai lang taw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""Jardin de la Union. Dai shara hpe 17th-century a ma ma nawku jawng hku shachyaw wa ai..."" which translates to ""Jardin de la Union. It was established in the 17th century and is known for its beautiful garden..."".  This directly identifies Jardin de la Union as the place described in the first paragraph.

The other options are mentioned later in the text as attractions *within* or associated with Jardin de la Union, but the question asks for the place that is described *initially*.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpe Jardín de la Unión kaw n mu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Nampan sun hpe man yawng da ai lusha seng ni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dai kaw nampan sun hpe shinggrup da ai lusha seng ni grai law hkra nga nna, chyingtung lai ten hte shana de hkan ginra nta kasha daju kaw gumhpraw n jaw ra ai yungwi pinra ni nga chye ai.""

This translates to: ""The water from the fountain, which is gathered from the lush greenery of the surrounding area, is used to irrigate the young trees planted in the courtyard and the vines that climb the walls.""

Option C, ""Nampan sun hpe man yawng da ai lusha seng ni"" translates to ""The lush greenery that is gathered from the water."" This directly reflects the information in the text about the fountain's water source.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Yungwi pinra ni lawm ai ginra nta kasha daju ni** (The young trees planted in the courtyard): While the text mentions young trees, it doesn't specifically say they are watered *from the fountain*.
*   **B: Moi na sumtsaw maumwi langai a daidaw buga** (The gentle breeze from the surrounding vegetation): The text doesn't mention a breeze.
*   **D: Ma Ma jawng htingnu dingsa** (The sounds of Ma Ma and the wind): The text doesn't mention sounds of people or wind.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shani bum lung ai hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai ngu sawn la na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Ndai bungli hpe hkam kaja ai lam ram daw nga ai masha ni gaw galaw pyaw na re.**

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):** Asks about the action that prevents the ""shani bum lung"" (the desire to make a group of people suffer) from being realized.
* **The Passage (P):** Describes a situation where a shaman's power can prevent suffering and mentions that the shaman's actions can ""break the chains"" of the desire to harm others.
* **Option C:**  ""Ndai bungli hpe hkam kaja ai lam ram daw nga ai masha ni gaw galaw pyaw na re"" translates to ""The shaman's actions that break the chains prevent the desire to make a group of people suffer."" This directly addresses the question of how the harmful desire is stopped, aligning perfectly with the passage's explanation of the shaman's role.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  ""Loi ai lam kaw shani bum lung na matu shajin ra lam kaji kajaw sha ra ai"" translates to ""The path where the desire to make a group of people suffer is turned away by the shaman's power."" While the shaman's power is involved, it doesn't fully explain *how* the desire is prevented; it just states that it's turned away.
* **B:** ""Tsan gang shadang n bung ai, raitim lani mi aten law ai"" translates to ""The suffering that is taken away, and the people are relieved."" This describes the *result* of the shaman's actions, not the action itself that prevents the suffering in the first place.
* **D:** ""Ma ngai hte re kun dinnghku ni na matu shani bum lung ai gaw htuk ai shinggan bungli n re"" translates to ""The shaman's power and the reverence of the people prevent the desire to make a group of people suffer."" While the shaman's power *and* people's reverence are involved, option C focuses on the *action* preventing the suffering, which is the core of the question.



"
"Laika hta ka da ai hte maren, shani bum lung na matu shajin ra lam kaji kajaw galoi ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Bum lung ai gaw shingra gup yin kaw rai yang** (The one who is spiritually awakened is a member of a religious group).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a spiritual awakening (""shaman shakyang"") as being connected to a religious group (""shingra grupyin"").**  It states that those who have experienced this awakening often join a religious group.
* **Question Q asks about the consequence of spiritual awakening.** The passage implies that a consequence is joining a religious group.
* **Option D directly reflects this connection:** ""Bum lung ai gaw shingra gup yin kaw rai yang"" translates to ""The one who is spiritually awakened is a member of a religious group.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bum lung ai wa gaw hkumhkrang hte seng nna kkam kaja yang (The one who is spiritually awakened is not a member of a religious group):** This directly contradicts the passage.
* **B: Loi ai lam lawm yang (It is a simple and joyful path):** While spiritual awakening might be joyful, the passage doesn't primarily focus on its simplicity or joy. It emphasizes the connection to a religious group.
* **C: Ma ni ma bum lung ai kaw lawm yang (Neither awakened nor spiritually inclined):** This is the opposite of what the passage describes.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Rogaland (sh) Agder kaw bumpa layang hte seng nna Norway hte shing daw yang hpa baw shai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Shanhte hpe law malawng heta hpun ka'up da ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rogaland hte Agder hta shanhte gaw ayan na """"""""hei"""""""" ngu shaga ai, lachyum gaw heta hpun ka'up da ai hpun ntu ai prang ga ngu ai re.""

This translates to: ""Rogaland and Agder's coasts are facing 'hei' (likely referring to some kind of weather/impact) and the inland areas are being flooded.""

Therefore, Rogaland and Agder are different from the rest of Norway because their inland areas are being flooded, while the coasts are facing a different kind of impact (""hei""). Option D accurately reflects this difference: ""The inland areas are being flooded.""
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Norway a matu ding ngam n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Maling bumpa layang ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kalang maran ndai bumpa layang ni gaw dam lada ai...""  This translates to ""The *maling bumpa layang ni* (dark/shadowy, bumpy, rolling hills) are suitable for..."" The sentence continues to say they are suitable for ""shara re ai hpe madi madun ya nga ai 'vidde' zawn re ai hpe madi madun ya nga ai"" (producing the 'video' areas). 

Therefore, the hilly terrain (maling bumpa layang ni) is what is being discussed as a characteristic of Norway.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dam lada ai hkarang ga ni (flat land):** The passage explicitly states the opposite - hilly terrain is suitable.
* **C: Grau dingchyung ai panglai hkai gai ni (mountains):** While Norway has mountains, the passage focuses on the rolling hills (bumpa layang ni).
* **D: Prang ga ni (plateaus):** The passage doesn't mention plateaus.



"
Hkyen jawn ai hpe myit lawm ai bu hkawm masha gaw galoi ten hta kawng dabang ni hkan du hkawm ging ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: India kahtet ta laman**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q):**  The question asks about a way to ""put the feet on a comfortable surface and to walk smoothly.""  Essentially, how to achieve comfortable and smooth walking.

* **The Passage (P):** The passage describes a situation where someone is walking on a path: ""India kaw na kahtet ta hta sa chyai ai ni a matu bum nta kaw na shara de sa ai."" (meaning roughly, ""On a sunny day, the path of India is smooth and comfortable."") It then goes on to describe different types of paths: a path where you walk on a soft surface, a path where you walk on a hard surface, a path where you walk on a grassy path, and a path where you walk on a path with a covering.  The key idea is the *type of path* influences the walking experience.

* **The Answer (C):**  ""India kahtet ta laman"" translates to ""Indian path"" or ""path of India.""  The passage emphasizes the characteristics of *different paths*, and the Indian path is presented as one such option, implying it's a path known for being smooth and comfortable to walk on.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nshung ta laman:** ""Shung ta laman"" means ""a path for climbing.""  This is the opposite of comfortable walking.
* **B: Nchyun du hkra ladaw laman:** ""Nchyun du hkra ladaw laman"" means ""a path of hard stone."" While it might be smooth, it's not necessarily *comfortable* to walk on for long distances.
* **D: Htawngshi ta laman:** ""Htawngshi ta laman"" means ""a path of wood."" It could be comfortable, but the passage doesn't specifically link wooden paths with smooth and comfortable walking.



Therefore, **C: India kahtet ta laman** is the most logical answer based on the passage and the question."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm ai ni gaw bum dabang hta shawoi na zawn galoi nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: India kahtet ta laman**.

Here's why:

The question asks about a place where people from different communities live together in harmony, respecting each other's traditions, and where there's a vibrant cultural mix. The text describes a place where people from different ethnic groups (""sharawng"") live together and maintain their unique cultures, while also interacting and sharing.

Option C, ""India kahtet ta laman"" (the land of India), fits this description best. India is known for its incredible diversity of cultures, languages, and religions, where many different communities coexist.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Hkyen kaba a majaw machyi makaw hkrum ai laman (The land where the most powerful and wise rulers govern):** While historical, this doesn't necessarily imply harmony between diverse communities.
* **B: hkyen jawn ai du hkra ten tup (A place where people live in close proximity):**  Proximity doesn't guarantee harmony or cultural respect.
* **D: Nshung shata ten tup (A place where many things are gathered):** This is too general and doesn't specifically relate to cultural diversity and coexistence.



"
Tinang gaw karum na matu tam hkawm taw li hpe mu na matu myit mada yang hpa hpe koi yen ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: sanghpaw daru hta lahta lawu lam hkawm taw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Kaja's actions:** Kaja is a skilled person who is respected and sought after. She helps people and takes care of them. She is generous and resourceful.
* **The question asks about Tinang's ability to help many people:** The question essentially asks how Tinang can help many people with a lot of things.
* **Option A aligns with the passage:** ""Sanghpaw daru hta lahta lawu lam hkawm taw ai"" translates to ""Capable of helping many people with skills."" This directly reflects the description of Kaja's abilities and how she helps others.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: sanghpaw hpareng Du ni hte hku hkau ai:** ""Exceptional in knowledge and skill"" is a good description, but it doesn't fully address the ""helping many people"" aspect.
    * **C: tinang a magam hpe ndau shana ai:** ""Not afraid of Tinang's power"" is irrelevant to the question of helping others.
    * **D: li arau hkan jawn ai manang hpe n-gawn nsawn di ai:** ""Not afraid to enter dangerous places and help others"" is also a specific type of help, but doesn't encompass the broad ability to help many with many things.

Therefore, option A is the best fit based on the passage's overall theme and the question's focus.
"
Tinang gaw karum na ra taw nga ai li hpe tam hkawm yang li daru makau kaw hpa galaw ging ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: masha ni hpe shanhte sumpan li hpe seng taw ai shaloi sha shani sa na.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a complex situation where Kaja is being manipulated and pressured by various forces.**  She is facing internal conflict and external pressures from her family, clan, and potentially others. She is struggling to navigate these conflicting demands.
* **The question asks how Kaja might be able to break free from this difficult situation.**
* **Option C directly addresses this by suggesting she needs to resist the pressures and demands being placed on her.** ""Masha ni hpe shanhte sumpan li hpe seng taw ai shaloi sha shani sa na"" translates to ""Resist the pressures and demands being placed on her.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sanghpaw la ni hte matut mahkai lam galaw na (Following the path of the clan and the elders).**  This would likely *reinforce* the pressures Kaja is facing, not break free from them.
* **B: sanghpaw ni hpe rediyu ladat hte tam sawk ai shara npu kaw nga taw na (Listening to the clan mother and the influential people and being obedient to them).** This is similar to option A and would likely continue the manipulation.
* **D: li arau hkan jawn ai manang hpe koi kau na (To be koi kau/to avoid conflict with those who have a different background).**  Avoiding conflict would likely make it harder for Kaja to address the underlying problems.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that offers a proactive approach to Kaja's situation - resisting the pressures that are hindering her freedom.
"
Zinlawng a colony labau hpe myit lawm ai mungkan bu hkawm ai wa hpe kaning re shara gaw shalen na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Kowloon hka kau lam** (The area around Kowloon).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hong Kong a tsawm htap dik ai shara ni lu mu na matu, dai zinlawng kaw na pru wa nna kaga maga re ai Kowloon hka kau lam de yawng wa u.""  This translates to: ""In the early days of Hong Kong's development, the area where the Chinese lived and were gathered was the area around Kowloon.""

Therefore, Kowloon was the area where the Chinese population congregated in the early stages of Hong Kong's development.
"
Mauhpa ningmu ginra hpe ningshawng jaw ai mungkan bu hkawm ai wa hpe kaning re shara gaw shalen na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Victoria sanghpaw daru**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hong Kong lamu mada wa hpang yan shinggrup hting tsip ni hpe Victoria Sanghpaw daru hka mayan hkan na htoi kabrim ai tsa seng ni hte matut da ai.""  This translates to: ""For a period of 99 years, Hong Kong was under British rule, and the government offices were located on the shores of Victoria Harbour.""

Therefore, Victoria Harbour is the place where the government offices were located during the British colonial period.  The question asks where the government offices were located during that time.
"
Nkau gumra hking kaw jawn ai wa na lagaw gumra lagaw labye kaw dau na shoihpa yawm na matu karum ya ai baw hpa nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **B: shim ai bar shadawn ni**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the difficulties of learning a new language (specifically English) and the feeling of being overwhelmed. It mentions the fear of making mistakes and the lack of confidence.  The final paragraph talks about overcoming this feeling by focusing on understanding the general meaning and not getting bogged down in perfect grammar.  It advocates for learning the essence of the language and building confidence gradually.

Option B, ""shim ai bar shadawn ni"" (learning by immersion), aligns perfectly with this sentiment.  Immersion focuses on understanding through exposure rather than strict grammatical rules, which addresses the anxiety and feeling of being overwhelmed mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: gyip ai lagaw lahpan (perfect grammar):** The passage *explicitly* states not to focus on perfect grammar.
* **C: shan hpyi lagaw labye ni (learning by rote memorization):** The passage suggests understanding meaning over memorization.
* **D: grau kaba ai ngang kang ai lam (strict grammatical rules):** The passage advises against adhering to strict grammatical rules.



"
Jawn buk hkyepdin na gara hkrang nsam gaw gumra lagaw labye jai lang ai shaloi jawn ai wa na shim lam hpe karum sharawt ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: dam lada ai lagaw lahpan**.

Here's why:

The question asks what kind of language is used in the passage. The passage explicitly states: ""Gumra hking nkau, Inglik gumra hking ni hta galeng jawn ai wa hpang hku agang yang gumra hking gabye na matu hkrak re ai shim ai bar shadaw ni lawm ai."" This translates to: ""Good language, it is a language that is somewhat like English, and has a beautiful and attractive expression."" 

Therefore, the language being described is a blend of Burmese and English, hence **dam lada ai lagaw lahpan** (a mixture of Burmese and English language).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: gyip ai laga lahpan** (a mixture of Burmese and Chin language) - The passage doesn't mention Chin.
* **B: shan hpyi** (Shan language) - The passage doesn't mention Shan.
* **C: lagaw lahtin** (Latin language) - The passage doesn't mention Latin.



"
Galai yu gawn zinghkri kaw na bu hkawm ai ni hpe hpa baw jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: shara langai sha bu hkawm ai masha ni hte matut mahkai ai lam** (The way to make friends with people from around the world and travel).

Here's why:

* The passage describes Casey Fenton using Couchsurfing to meet people from different countries and travel.  He connected with people online and then met them in person.
* Option D directly reflects this process: making friends with people worldwide and using those connections for travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: buga masha ni hte manam gawk** (Boredom and loneliness): While these might be motivations for some, the passage doesn't highlight them as the *way* Casey made friends.
* **B: manu hkyem sa ai nbungli ni** (A scientist who studies human behavior): Casey is a computer programmer, not a scientist studying human behavior.
* **C: buga lam woi ai ni hku na woi awn ai ginwang kawan hkrun lam** (The way to become a popular person by spreading rumors): This is completely unrelated to the content of the passage, which focuses on genuine connection and travel.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, galai yu gawn zinghkri hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Yaw shada da ai mare kaw na lu mai ai buga masha jahpan hpe bu hkawm ai ni hpe jaw ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Casey Fenton used Couchsurfing to connect with people worldwide, especially in Japan. It also says he'd email people to arrange meetings. The question asks how people connect and share information after disasters. Option C directly reflects this by suggesting that people connect and share information through platforms like Couchsurfing to help those affected by disasters, particularly in Japan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bu hkawm ai ni hpe galoi ma buga manam tau ai ni hte madi madun ai lam galaw ya ai:** This is too general. While people connect online, it doesn't specifically address disaster relief or the methods of information sharing.
* **B: Nkau zinghkri ni gaw bu hkawm ai ni a bungjat tengman ai lam madun na ra rawng ai:**  This doesn't align with the passage's information about using Couchsurfing for connecting with people in Japan and arranging meetings.
* **D: bu hkawm masha ni kalang marang buga masha ni a dinglun maram yu ai lam ni mai lu ai:** This option is not relevant to the content of the passage.

Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately answers the question based on the provided text."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gumbum jarawp gawk kaw gara manam hpan hpe mu lu na matu mai byin ai lam yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **D: asak sumshi ning ka'ang na manam (a manam of compassion and understanding)**.

Here's why:

* **P (the first paragraph)** describes a situation where someone is experiencing hardship and suffering. The speaker empathizes with this person, recognizing their pain and acknowledging their difficult circumstances. The speaker also expresses a desire to help.  The key phrases highlight understanding and compassion.

* **Q (the second paragraph)** asks what kind of heart is needed to truly understand and help someone in such a situation.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: asak hkun ning shawng manam (a manam of simple kindness)** - While kindness is important, it might not be enough to truly *understand* someone's deep suffering.

* **B: tinang hkrai bu hkawm ai manam (a manam of a heart that is easily hurt)** - This is the opposite of what's needed. A heart easily hurt would likely be overwhelmed and unable to offer effective help.

* **C: ma kaji ni hte bu hkawm ai manam (a manam of a heart that is both cautious and withdrawn)** - A cautious and withdrawn heart wouldn't be open to helping someone in need.

* **D: asak sumshi ning ka'ang na manam (a manam of compassion and understanding)** - This option directly reflects the empathetic and understanding tone of the first paragraph.  It describes a heart capable of feeling *with* someone and recognizing the depth of their struggle.  This kind of heart is essential for providing true support.

Therefore, **D** is the most appropriate answer because it encapsulates the emotional and intellectual qualities needed to respond to the situation described in the text with genuine compassion and understanding.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, jarawp manam dap kaw kadai nga byin na law dik htum rai?","The correct answer is **C: asak 70 kaw nga ai yan la**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""How many days until the full moon, if the new moon is today?""  This is asking for the approximate lunar cycle length.
* **The text (P) says:**  ""...raitim jarawp nkau mi gaw shanhte hpe laksan gawk ni hta nga na ahkang jaw ma ai.""  This roughly translates to ""...the moon cycles and has a full moon after approximately 70 days.""

Therefore, option C aligns with the information provided in the text. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw gawngwai laknak kabai ai lam hpe tup hkrak lu tsun dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: jaw ai hku kabai yang dai gaw tinang lata de bai wa ai** (The previous generation might not have known how to use it, so they didn't use it).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Lama na nang, gawngwai laknak kabai sharin mayu ai rai yang, kaja htap hkuk manu ai hpe lang u."" (Long ago, if they used a boomerang, they would throw it and it would return.) This implies a change in knowledge or understanding of how to use a boomerang over time.
* **The question asks:** ""Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw gawngwai laknak kabai ai lam hpe tup hkrak lu tsun dan ai rai?"" (Since the last generation, how has the method of using a boomerang changed?)
* **Option A** directly addresses this change by suggesting that the current generation might not know the correct way to use it, implying a difference from how it was used in the past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** This option talks about a change in the boomerang's purpose, which isn't mentioned in the text.
* **C:** The text explicitly mentions boomerangs from Australia, so this is false.
* **D:** The text doesn't say that the current generation doesn't use boomerangs; it focuses on *how* they use them differently.



"
Javanese shat shamai hta lawu kaw na gara hpe dan leng ai namchyim hku na jai lang ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: ma-un jumdwi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Du hkra ladaw malu masha ni hpe hkyen lajang ya ai Javanese lu sha ni, Javanese a dan leng ai namchyim rai nga ai nawhkun, **majap, jum dwi (grau nna gaw Javanese ma-un jum dwi)** ni hte manam pyaw na jap ai hpan amyu myu ni hpe ya ten kaw gaw archipelaga mayan hkan dam lada ai hku grai lu mai nga ai re.""

This translates to: ""The Javanese, who are known for their elegant and graceful movements, their Javanese dance which is full of grace, **majap, jum dwi (which in Javanese means ma-un jum dwi)**, and other performing arts..."".

Therefore, ""ma-un jumdwi"" is the Javanese term for dance that is described as having graceful movements and being full of grace. The question asks what the Javanese dance described in the passage is called, and the passage explicitly states it is ""ma-un jumdwi"".
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, ana kap chye ai contagious gaw gara hku chyam bra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Pathogen ana shabyin ai ni** (Pathogen's ability to invade).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kap chye wa ai ana zinli langai gaw ana kap taw ai masha langai ngai a makau kaw nga nga ai shaloi aloi sha kap wa chye ai baw ana re.""  This translates to: ""In order for a contagious disease to spread, the pathogen needs to have the ability to invade the host.""
* **Option B directly reflects this:** It highlights the crucial aspect of a pathogen's ability to invade a host as a key factor in contagious diseases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ana kap ai masha** (the pathogen's characteristics): While important, this is too broad. The ability to invade is a specific characteristic crucial for contagiousness.
* **C: bacterium:** Bacteria are *types* of pathogens, not the overarching reason for contagiousness.
* **D: makawp maga tsi ni** (the host's immune system):  The host's immune system is important in fighting off infections, but the question asks about what enables *contagious* diseases to spread, not how the body responds to them.



Therefore, the best answer is **B**."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw ana kap loi ai ana hpe n'shabyin ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: bacteria**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kap bra ana langai gaw hkrung kanu, bacterium, kamu (sh) kaga hkan kap latung zawn re pathogen ana hpe shabyin ya mai ai.""  This translates to: ""The body's defense against pathogens comes from white blood cells, bacteria, fungi, and other pathogens.""

Since the question asks what specifically fights infectious diseases, and bacteria are explicitly mentioned as part of the body's defense against pathogens, **bacteria** is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: makawp maga tsi ni (Immune system)**: While the immune system *uses* bacteria as part of its defense, the question asks *what* specifically fights the infection, not the system itself.
*   **B: virus ana kanu ni (Viruses)**:  The text doesn't specifically mention viruses as a defense mechanism. Viruses are a type of pathogen, not a defender.
*   **D: kamu (Fungi)**:  While fungi are mentioned, bacteria are given more prominence as part of the defense.

"Kaning re mabyin hta, tingkyeng hte seng ai VPN galaw shapraw ai ni hta web proxy hpe lata yang jai lang ai wa a matu grau hkum zup na rai?","The correct answer is **B: jai lang ai wa gaw jep joi ai lam hte kin-yu galaw ai lam hpe dang di ai ram koi yen na matu myit tsang yang.**

Here's why:

* **The Question:** The question asks what a web proxy can do to circumvent the limitations of a VPN.  The prompt states that VPNs can be blocked, slow down internet speed, and throttle bandwidth.
* **Why B is Correct:** A web proxy acts as an intermediary between your computer and the internet. It can bypass some VPN restrictions by using a different server location. It can also potentially improve speed (though not always) and provide a degree of bandwidth management.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: jai lang ai wa gaw shiga htinglet ai lam yawng hpe bai byeng mayu yang:** While a web proxy *can* use HTTPS, it doesn't guarantee it will always bypass restrictions.
    * **C: jai lang ai wa gaw http htinglet ai lam hpe bai byeng mayu yang:**  Using HTTP (non-encrypted) might be possible, but it doesn't inherently circumvent all VPN limitations.
    * **D: jai lang ai wa gaw bandwidth tsaw ai hpe ram daw ra ahkyak yang:** While a proxy *might* offer some bandwidth control, it's not its primary function in the context of circumventing VPN restrictions.  The prompt states VPNs throttle bandwidth, and the question is about *circumventing* those limitations, not simply controlling bandwidth.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate description of how a web proxy can help when a VPN is experiencing limitations."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw VPN hte web proxies ni hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Web proxies ni gaw web shiga htinglet ai lam yawng hpe bai n byeng lu ai**

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the difference between VPNs and web proxies.** The passage already explains key differences.
* **Option B accurately summarizes a core function of web proxies.** Web proxies act as intermediaries, forwarding web requests and masking the user's IP address. This allows them to bypass certain restrictions and potentially access blocked content.
* **Option A is incorrect.** VPNs *do* consume bandwidth, but the passage highlights that web proxies are *more* bandwidth-intensive than VPNs (option A is reversed).
* **Option C is incorrect.** VPNs and web proxies both mask the user's IP address. The statement that they ""share the same browsing bandwidth"" isn't accurate, as VPNs typically offer encryption and dedicated connections.
* **Option D is incorrect.** VPNs *do* encrypt internet traffic, including HTTP traffic. That's a key benefit of using a VPN.

Therefore, option B is the most precise and accurate answer based on the information in the passage."
Hpa gaw marai langai ngai shanhte a ni dik shara shinggan kaw na phone company hpe jai lang na matu ahkang jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: PSTN phone ni**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that if your internet is down, you can still make phone calls using the PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network).  The passage specifically states: ""Nang hpe masha ni shaga wa na matu dai nambat gaw jashai da ai shara kaw na du wa ai. Nang hpe masha ni shaga wa na matu dai nambat gaw jashai da ai shara kaw na du wa ai.""  This translates to: ""You can still make calls using the phone line. You can still make calls using the phone line.""  And further, ""Nang hpe masha ni shaga wa na matu dai nambat gaw jashai da ai shara kaw na du wa ai"" is related to calling the phone company for help.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: internet hte lajang da ai shaga ni** - While internet issues can impact some services, the passage indicates PSTN phones are an alternative.
*   **B: mungkan phone nambat ni** -  ""Mungkan phone nambat"" doesn't directly relate to a specific type of phone service mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: jak shagan ni** - ""Jak shagan"" translates to ""satellite"", and the passage doesn't mention satellite phones.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nka shaga ai ni hpe lu na matu lawu kaw na gara hpe galaw ra na rai?","The correct answer is **C: tinang buga rau nga masha hpung kaw na nambat langai hpe lu la na (You can use a separate phone line with a modem to connect to the internet.)**

Here's why:

* **The paragraph describes a situation where internet access is limited.**  The person needs to use a separate phone line and a modem to get an internet connection when other options are unavailable.

* **Option C directly addresses the solution presented in the text.** The paragraph states, ""...nang hpe masha ni shaga wa na matu dai nambat gaw jashai da ai shara kaw na du wa ai.""  This implies using a separate phone line/modem is the way to get internet when a regular line is not enough.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mungkan nambat hpe mari la na (Use a dial-up phone line).** While technically possible, the text mentions needing a modem, and dial-up is an outdated method.
* **B: buga phone hpaga hpung langai hpe jai lang na (Just plug a phone line into the phone).**  This won't connect to the internet; it's a standard phone line connection.
* **D: PSTN phone langai mari la na (Use a PSTN phone line).**  The text mentions using a *separate* phone line with a modem. Just using a standard PSTN phone won't solve the problem.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Jaw da ai ga yi (vowel) hta mahta nna shanhte a nsen shapraw ai shai hkat ai kaw na ga si madung ni hpe yu ra na gaw c hte g re."" (The pronunciation of the vowel (a, e, i, o, u) is used to determine the sound of a word when pronouncing it with a large number of consonants.  The vowels 'c' and 'g' are used.)
* **The question asks:** ""Italy gasi ni a nsen hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun dan ai rai?"" (How is the pronunciation of Italy's words affected by the combination of consonants and vowels?)
* **Option D directly answers:** ""ga hkum law malawng na nsen shapraw ai lam gaw hpang na vowel hta shamyet shanat taw nga ai"" (When a large number of consonants are combined, the pronunciation is affected by the vowel sounds.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: r langai hta r lahkawng gaw grau na ga nsen shapraw na matu yak ai** (The 'r' sound and the 'rr' sound significantly influence the pronunciation of the word.)  While 'r' is mentioned in the text, this option doesn't relate it to the overall impact of consonant-vowel combinations.
* **B: ga hkum ni law law hpe shanhte gara hku ka lajang da ai zawn nsen shapraw ai** (The vowel sounds are determined by the position of the consonant sounds.) This is not what the text says. The text says the vowel sounds *determine* the pronunciation *with* a large number of consonants.
* **C: laika c hte g lawm ai ga hkum ni gaw yak ai** (The combination of 'c' and 'g' consonants is more prevalent.)  This option focuses only on two specific consonants and doesn't address the overall relationship between consonants and vowels in pronunciation.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately and directly answers the question based on the provided text.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kade nde hpun kaba tu ai lam kaba ni, pat hte galaw da ai htingtsip ni hte prat dap gat ginra ni hpe tsa ban 18 ning na gat..."" This translates to ""During that time, a process of displacement and exchange of populations took place..."" 

Option A directly reflects this description of the overall process of population change. The other options are too specific or don't encompass the broader context.
"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Izmir na tup hkrak laklai kumla n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: panglai kaba hpe wang tawn ai mare (The area where the Greeks were settled)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Moi na Smyrna myu gaw, ya madang tsaw, galu kaba, ngut nna bungli grai law ai shara, panglai hte bum ni shing grup da ai myu rai taw sai."" This translates to: ""In the city of Smyrna, there were various ethnic groups, including Greeks, Armenians, and other groups.""  It then goes on to mention the Greek population's settlement in that area.

Option A directly reflects this. The other options are not supported by the text. The text doesn't mention any connection to the Magwi region, the arrival of a specific group, or a particular political alignment.



"
gasi hanami gaw hpa baw yu chyai ai ngu madi madun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Cherry nampan ni pu ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai hpe hanami ngu mung chye da ma ai."" This translates to ""It is for hanami (cherry blossom viewing)."" The first sentence also talks about cherry blossom viewing in Japan.  Therefore, the question asks what is for hanami, and the answer directly points to ""Cherry nampan ni pu ai"" (Cherry blossom viewing).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Japan du magam uphkang masa:** (Japan's mountains and plains) - While Japan has mountains and plains, this isn't the *purpose* of the hanami.
* **C: mahkaw hpun pu pu ai:** (The scent of cherry blossoms) - This is a characteristic *of* hanami, but not the *reason* for it.
* **D: Hkawseng Mungdan hte seng ai Hkaw Hkam Hkaw:** (High-class and luxurious things) - This is completely irrelevant to the passage's topic.



"
Cherry nampan pu ai hpe yu chyai ai poi lamang hpe kadai ni hpang wa sai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Japan hkawseng magam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Japan kaw, alat ningshawng byin hpun pu ai lam lamang hpe hkawngseng magam nan shi hkum shi a matu hte laga hkawseng mungdan hte seng ai hkaw hkam hkaw makau na du magam uphkang masa a hpung shang masha ni a matu madu tai na galaw lai wa sai re.""

This translates to: ""...In Japan, the phenomenon of cherry blossoms blooming is a popular custom, and people gather under the trees to enjoy the beauty of the flowers.""

Therefore, the answer refers to the custom of cherry blossoms blooming **in Japan**.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Miwa hkawseng magam** - Miwa is a specific location or region, not the broader context of cherry blossom viewing.
* **B: Japan du magam ni** - ""Du magam ni"" translates to ""the day in Japan,"" which is not the core answer.
* **D: Miwa du magam ni** - Same reasoning as A.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na Yerusalem a gara mawn nsam gaw maigan bu hkawm ai ni hpe ra sharawng hkra galaw ya na yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: mare na nawku htung hte seng ai ahkyak kumla (The holy sites of Jerusalem)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the religious significance of Jerusalem for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It states that the city holds sacred sites and is a place of deep religious importance for these three faiths. The question asks what the holy sites of Jerusalem represent for the people who claim the city. Option A directly addresses this by mentioning the holy sites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Israel a mare ninghpum ngu ai arawng ningsang (The people of Israel who are the majority of the country):** While many Israelis do claim Jerusalem, the passage focuses on the broader religious significance beyond just the Israeli population.
*   **C: shi a htunghking hte seng ai sak jaw ai lam (The land that is spiritually and politically claimed):** This is too broad. The passage focuses specifically on the *holy sites*, not the entire land claim.
*   **D: labau shang shara law law (The large and ancient ruins):** While Jerusalem is ancient, the passage emphasizes its *religious* significance more than its ruins."
Lawu kaw na gara hpe Yerusalem a gumhkawng ai lama hku nna n tang madun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nawku htung hte seng ai ahkyak kumla** (The holy and sacred atmosphere).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes Yerusalem's sacredness:** The text repeatedly describes Jerusalem as a holy city for three major religions: Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It mentions its spiritual significance, historical importance, and the presence of holy sites.
* **Option C aligns with this description:** ""Nawku htung hte seng ai ahkyak kumla"" directly translates to ""holy and sacred atmosphere,"" which perfectly captures the essence of how the passage portrays Jerusalem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: myit shang sha hpa labau (The beauty of the mountains):** While Jerusalem is situated in a mountainous region, the passage focuses more on its spiritual and religious importance than its physical beauty.
* **B: mung masa hte seng ai shingkang shingna (The richness and prosperity of the land):** The passage doesn't discuss the economic prosperity of the land.
* **D: htunghking hte seng ai shara ni (The historical and sacred days):** While Jerusalem has a rich history, the passage's emphasis is on its ongoing sacredness and atmosphere, not just historical events.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Dingda Afrika a lata san tawn ai nam pan sun (sh) dingda Afrika a amyu sha nam pan sun ni yawng de shang lu na ahkang jaw ya ai Wild Card langai mi mari ai gaw akyu nga na re.""  (In the entire Africa's largest national parks, those who purchase a Wild Card to visit the Kruger National Park and other national parks are allowed to.)
* **Option D accurately reflects this:** It says that the community allowed to purchase a Wild Card to visit the Kruger National Park and other national parks are those who have a Wild Card.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dingda Myusha Nampan sun SANParks ni hpe sa lu ai ram sa na matu masing da ai bu hkawm masha** (Communities who are allowed to enter the national parks of SANParks with their families) - While families are allowed, the passage specifically mentions the Wild Card requirement for *purchasing* entry.
* **B: Kruger Amyu sha Nampan sun hpe sha sa du na bu hkawm masha** (Communities allowed to visit the Kruger National Park) - This is too broad. The passage mentions the Wild Card requirement for visiting Kruger, not just general permission.
* **C: Nampan sun shang shabrai hpe myit tsang ai manu hkyem sa mayu ai bu hkawm masha** (Communities who are allowed to purchase a Wild Card for those who are not afraid of animals) - This is irrelevant to the passage. The passage doesn't mention fear of animals being a factor in purchasing a Wild Card.

Kruger Amyu sha Nampan sun hte seng nna lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak n lu tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: dingda Afrika ningmawng madung hku na sawn masat da ai**.

The text states: ""Dingda Afrika a madung myit agang ya ai lam langai re, dai hpe Africa Dingda Myusha Nampan sun (SANParks) a ahkyak lapau hku na myit shalawm da ai.""  This translates to: ""The border of the Limpopo River, which is the border of Southern Africa, is protected by Africa National Parks (SANParks).""  

Therefore, the Kruger National Park is protected by SANParks due to its location on the border of Southern Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nampan sun a grup-yin shara law law hta dusat dumyeng n bung ai:** While the text mentions groups conducting research, it's not the *reason* the park is protected.
* **C: Dingda Afrika Amyu sha ni a kaji dik ai Nampan Sun re:** The text doesn't focus on the park being a ""major attraction.""
* **D: Wild Card mari la nna manam ni gaw sa du mai ai:**  The Wild Card is mentioned as a way for people to access the park, but it's not the reason for its protection.

Lawu kaw na gara gaw bum a grau dingchyung ai shara shagu hta bum lung ai ni a matu hkrit tsang hpa bying na matu makoi nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: madi ai mabyin masa ni (morning mist)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the experience of seeing Machu Picchu at dawn. It mentions:

* **""Nlung ni hpe lam ding yang hta jahkrat tawn da nna hpri gang sumri hte lata jum mai ai hku hkrai hkrai da ai.""** (The morning mist slowly rises, and the sun's rays pierce through the clouds.)
* **""Dai tsun lai wa ai gaw, n'sa matut sa na matu myit mada ai hte grau kadawng ai daw hta sadi u...""** (Soon, the morning mist will dissipate, and the towers and walls will come into view...)

This indicates that the towers and walls are initially shrouded in morning mist and then gradually revealed as the mist dissipates. Therefore, the answer is ""madi ai mabyin masa ni"" (morning mist).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nlung lagaw lahkam (cloudy sky)** - The passage describes the *disappearance* of the cloudy sky, not its presence.
* **C: ginlawng kaji ni (sunny day)** - While it becomes a sunny day eventually, the immediate description is of the morning mist.
* **D: hpri gang sin-yu (sunshine)** - Sunshine is mentioned as piercing through the clouds, but the initial and defining characteristic of the scene is the morning mist.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, laika hta tsun da ai Machu Picchu bum a dingchyung hte seng nan tup hkrak shingnip shingna n lu tsun ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: grau dingchyung ai shara ni gaw madi ai shaloi hkrit tsang hpa byin wa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Grau nna gaw madi taw ai shaloi ndai gaw a-lawan sha hkrit tsang hpa shara byin chye wa ai.""  This translates to ""And the stones, after being shaped, were fitted together without mortar, and then fitted together with polished edges.""

* **Option D directly reflects this information.** It correctly identifies that the stones were fitted together with polished edges, implying a precise and mortar-less construction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hkam kaja lam nga ai bum lung ai ni pyi nsa sa ba wa ai** (The day when the heart was filled with awe at the sight of the mountains) - While the text describes a feeling of awe, it doesn't directly answer *how* the stones were fitted together.
* **B: grau dingchyung ai shara shagu hkan hkraishum ni n nga ai** (The day when the stones were shaped with precision) - The text mentions shaping the stones, but option D goes further by describing the *method* of fitting them together.
* **C: ndung na ginlawng kku hpe lai ra ai** (The day when one felt the power of the mountains) - This is related to the emotional impact but doesn't describe the construction techniques.



Therefore, option **D** is the only one that accurately answers the question based on the provided text."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Majorcan shadu ladat a madung lusha gunrai n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: shan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yu yu mying kaba ai shana lusha, grau nna ginhtawng ta hta, gaw Pa amb Sau re: dai hpe tsan lun sau, ba hkri si hte chyu shage, tuna nga zawn re mu ntsin ni lawm nna pawng muk hte galaw da ai re.""

This translates to something like: ""In the past, when it was a rainy season, it was said that the soil became fertile, and Pa amb Sau said: it should be planted with rice, beans, and corn, and the fish in the pond should be fed with dried fish and other things.""

The question asks what kind of food was used to feed the fish. The passage explicitly says ""tuna nga zawn re mu ntsin ni lawm nna pawng muk hte galaw da ai re,"" which translates to ""fed with dried fish and other things.""

The passage then connects this to a specific food: ""shan (grau nna wa shan) hpe madung lang nna tsanlun sau hpe du hkra lang da ai."" This means ""shan (from the soil and shan) were planted and harvested with joy.""

Therefore, the fish were fed with **shan**, which is a type of fish.  Option A directly names the fish.  The other options are incorrect because they refer to different foods or unrelated concepts.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Rootua a shara law law kaw geothermal hangi ni hpe jaw nga ai."" (Rootua is known for its large geothermal hot springs.)
* **The question asks:** ""Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hangi lusha hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?"" (If you want to experience the hot springs and the smell, where should you go?)
* **Option D aligns directly with this information.** Rotorua is specifically mentioned as a place to experience geothermal hot springs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While hot springs have healing properties, the passage doesn't directly say that healing is the *main* reason people go.
* **B:** Wellington is mentioned as a place to *visit* but not specifically known for its geothermal hot springs.
* **C:**  The passage mentions the strong smell of sulfur from the hot springs, but doesn't say that's the primary reason people visit.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw hangi nhkun hpe kahtet na matu ding ngam galaw ai lam hku na n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Geothermal kahtet dat**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Rootua a shara law law kaw geothermal hangi ni hpe jaw nga ai."" This translates to ""Rootua has large geothermal energy sources.""
* **The question asks:** ""Lawu kaw na gara gaw hangi nhkun hpe kahtet na matu ding ngam galaw ai lam hku na n tsun da ai rai?"" This translates to ""What is the source that has the power to generate energy from the earth?""
* **Geothermal energy** is derived from the Earth's internal heat, making it the answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dat nsa** (water power) - While water power is a source of energy, the passage specifically mentions geothermal energy.
* **B: nlung kahtet ni** (solar power) -  The passage doesn't mention solar power.
* **D: nlung kahtet ni** (solar power) - Same as B, solar power isn't mentioned.

Therefore, **C: Geothermal kahtet dat** is the only option that aligns with the information provided in the passage."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, hpung gyi (sh) yahkau num kaw na laksan matsing masat da ai lam lu na rai?","The correct answer is **A: htoi ai nsam hte dumbat hpe hpun ai**

Here's why:

The text describes a traditional dress worn by women. It specifically mentions ""htuai ai nsam hte dumbat"" which translates to ""white silk and a long skirt."" This directly answers the question of what characterizes the traditional clothing of the Hmong people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: tinang a lahpa hpe magap da ai:** (Wearing a dress with a pattern on the chest) While some Hmong dresses have patterns, this isn't a defining characteristic of *all* Hmong traditional clothing, and the text doesn't focus on chest patterns.
*   **C: hpung gyi jawng kaw na dumbat hpe shap ai:** (Wearing a skirt that covers the lower part of the leg) The text mentions a long skirt (""htuai ai nsam hte dumbat"") but doesn't focus on the leg coverage aspect.
*   **D: lahput lahta zen da ai bu tawm hpe hpun ai:** (Wearing a dress made of striped fabric) The text specifically mentions white silk (""htuai ai nsam"") and a long skirt. Striped fabric isn't the primary characteristic highlighted.



"
Lawu kaw gara buhpun palawng gaw hpung gyi jawng kaw na n lu shap mai na rai? ,"The correct answer is **D: dumbat ni**.

Here's why:

The text describes the traditional attire of the Hmong people. It mentions:

*   ""Hpung gyi jawng de sa chyai yang, num ni gaw skirt hpe lahput magap nna lahpa hpe mung magap da ai palang ni hpun lang ra na."" (Hmong women wear a long skirt, a blouse, and a belt.)
*   ""Hpunggyi jawng law malawng hkan gaw n lajang sa wa ai num ni a matu du gyit dumbat hpe htuk jaw nga ai."" (The Hmong woman's headscarf is tied around her head in a specific way.)
*   ""Rai timung lama na nang na nang la sa wa ai rai yang, grau nna gaw htoi ai nsam hte dumbat ni la wa shaloi gaw, chying hka lam kaw hpunggyi ni yahkau num ni e mani da ya ai hpe hkrum lu na re."" (The colors of the fabric worn by the Hmong women are often bright and colorful, and the headscarf is tied around her head in a specific way.)

The text emphasizes the *dumbat* (headscarf) as a defining characteristic of Hmong women's attire. The question asks what is a key feature of Hmong women's traditional clothing, and the text strongly highlights the *dumbat*.

Bu hkawm ai masha gaw Antarctic shara de bu hkawm ai shaloi shata ni hpe mu lu na matu kaja dik ahkaw ahkang galoi nga na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: ginhtawng shata ni laman** (for about a hundred nights).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai gaw lamu hta ntsin tsin taw ai zawn Aurora ni hpe mu na matu ahkaw ahkang kaja re. Dai ginra ni kaw masha kachyi chyi mying nga wa ai hte maren, nhtoi sin mang wa ai lam jahkring hkring re, raitim mang hkang nre, nang shagan ni hpe yu let mung lu pyaw na ra ai.""

This translates to: ""Also, they see the Aurora in the dark skies. Then, the nights are very long and bright, the sky is shining, and the sun doesn't set, allowing you to travel and enjoy the day.""

The phrase ""ni kaw masha kachyi chyi mying nga wa ai hte maren"" (the nights are very long and bright) implies that the nights are exceptionally long.  The question asks how many nights one can see the Aurora in Antarctica. The passage doesn't give an exact number, but the context strongly suggests ""about a hundred nights"" is the correct answer, as the nights are prolonged and the sun doesn't set.  ""ginhtawng shata ni laman"" (about a hundred nights) is the closest and most fitting answer based on the passage's description of the Antarctic nights.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dai shara masha nau nlaw shi ai ten** (for a few days): The passage clearly states the nights are *very long* and bright, not just a few days.
* **C: nshung shata ni laman** (for several nights):  While ""several"" is possible, the emphasis on the long nights points to a much longer duration, closer to a hundred.
* **D: ninghtoi sin mang madang nyam ai ten** (for a bright night): The question is about seeing the Aurora over a period of nights, not a single bright night.

Here's why:

The passage describes the symptoms of a dying phone:

*   **Jak shagan (battery low):** The phone is about to run out of battery.
*   **Shara hkan nang mai lata ai lam langai gaw jak shagan phone ni rai nga ai:** The phone's screen is dimming because of low battery.
*   **Jak shagan jodu ga shaga jak gaw malawng maga hku na lata lang phone na shara hta lang mai na matu nre:** The phone's screen might flicker or have strange patterns.

*    **Nang na ginra hpone galaw lajang shapraw ya ai ni gaw ndai magam bungli matut mahkai ai lam hte seng nna shiga ni hpe grau lu jaw ya grin ai rai nga ai:**  A sudden shutdown can cause data loss.

The question asks why the phone's signal might be weak when the battery is low. The passage explicitly states that the phone might have trouble connecting to the network (""line san ai shara de pru ra na re"") when it's running out of battery, implying an unstable signal.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: lama na shara gaw grai tsan yang** (The screen is very bright). This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
*   **C: shinggan hta jai lang na rai yang** (The phone will shut down immediately).  The passage suggests a gradual process, not an instantaneous shut down.
*   **D: malawng maga hku na lata lang phone na shara hta lang mai na matu nre** (The phone's screen will flicker). This describes a symptom of a low battery phone, but not why the signal is weak.
"
jak shagan phone hta cell phone hpe galoi grau ra sharawng na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: mare langai hta bansa hkawm sa taw shaloi (asking a knowledgeable person)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a problem with the cell phone, stating that it's not working properly and needs repair.  The question asks how to get the cell phone repaired.  The passage implies the best course of action is to seek help from someone who knows about cell phones (a knowledgeable person).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sanghpaw hte hkrun lam hkawm taw shaloi (asking friends and relatives)** While friends and relatives might offer support, they might not have the technical knowledge to fix the phone.
* **C: tsan ai shara na shiga hpe n ra yang (trying to fix it yourself)** The passage suggests the problem is complex and requires professional help.
* **D: tinang hku na alaw alam cell phone lang na mayu mahkoi rai yang (buying a new cell phone)** The passage focuses on repairing the existing phone, not replacing it.



"
Lawu kaw na gara n hkrum n ra ai lam gaw Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan byin wa ai lam de woi wa ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: tsun shaga ai lam**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1994 hta, ndai manghkang gaw sinpraw Moldova hta madu hkrai Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan ngu tinang na tinang ndau la lam de byin wa shangun ai re."" This translates to: ""In 1994, a conflict broke out in Moldova's Transnistria region, resulting in a war.""

Therefore, the answer refers to a war (tsun shaga) in the Transnistria region.
"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Transnistria gumsan magam mungdan hte ngam ai Moldova nbung ai rai?  ,"The correct answer is **C: UN matsing masat da ai lam** (The UN's mediating role).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Dai gaw shi na shi asuya hte jai gumhpraw masa lu ai rai tim gara UN hpung shang mungdan ni kaw na gaw masat masa n-galaw ya ma ai.""  This translates to: ""It (Transnistria) has been a subject of contention, and the UN has been trying to mediate.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tsun shaga ai lam** (The long-standing issue) - While the issue *is* long-standing, the passage specifically highlights the UN's involvement as a key aspect.
* **B: makam masham hte seng ai lam** (Not related to the Orthodox faith) - The passage mentions the Orthodox faith of Moldova but doesn't link it to the Transnistria dispute.
* **D: jai gumhpraw masa** (The internal conflict) -  While it *is* an internal conflict, the passage focuses on the UN's attempt to mediate this conflict.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nbung bung ai masa hpe koi yen mayu ai bu hkawm ai masha hku na Montevideo de galoi sa du ra na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Dingdung shingwang chyen maga de ginhtawng shata ni laman**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Montevideo gaw nau nkahtet ai shara re; ginhtawng ta hta gaw katsi kahtet shadang +30˚C dara nga ai."" (Montevideo is a beautiful city; in the summer, it is hot, with temperatures reaching +30˚C.)
* **The question asks:** ""Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, nbung bung ai masa hpe koi yen mayu ai bu hkawm ai masha hku na Montevideo de galoi sa du ra na rai?"" (During the day and night, what kind of weather can be expected in Montevideo?)
* **Option C** directly reflects the information that Montevideo experiences hot summer weather.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dingdung shingwang chyen maga de nshung shata ni laman** (The weather in the summer is rainy) - The text doesn't mention rain.
* **B: Montevideo na marang nlaw ai ladaw laman** (The weather in Montevideo is humid) - While humidity *could* be a factor in a hot climate, the text specifically mentions the temperature.
* **D: Montevideo na nshung shata laman** (The weather in Montevideo is cool) - The text clearly states it's hot.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, grau katsi ai du hkra ladaw hpe ra sharawng ai rai yang bu hkawm ai masha hku na Montevideo de galoi sa du ra na rai?","The correct answer is **C: Montevideo na lanam ta rai yang**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Montevido gaw nau nkahtet ai shara re; ginhtawng ta hta gaw katsi kahtet shadang +30˚C dara nga ai."" This translates to ""Montevideo is a beautiful city; the daytime temperature is +30˚C.""
*  The text also mentions that the city experiences hot weather and that thermometers reach high temperatures.
* The question asks about the temperature in Montevideo.

Therefore, option C, ""Montevideo na lanam ta rai yang"" (The temperature in Montevideo), is the most accurate answer. The other options are too specific or refer to different aspects of the text.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw shawa aurng arai dum nta jahten ya ai hpe ning hkap nna graffiti shingni gaw gap ai hte gunrun na rai?","The correct answer is **C: masha n ra ai shadaw ni (sh) shawa masha arung arai**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What will happen to graffiti that has been created on walls, if it is removed?
* **The provided text states:** ""Graffiti sumla ka ai gaw tara nshang ai hta sumla hpanji ni hpe mahkawng wa ai."" This translates to ""Graffiti that has been created will be removed.""
* **The options relate to what will happen to the graffiti after removal.** Option C, ""masha n ra ai shadaw ni (sh) shawa masha arung arai""  (which loosely translates to ""the effect of the original graffiti"") is the most logical consequence. Removing the original graffiti will remove its effect. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Graffiti mabyin masa ni (Graffiti is beautiful):** This is a subjective opinion and doesn't address what happens after removal.
* **B: mahkret ka ai (It will be expensive):** While removing graffiti *can* be expensive, the text doesn't explicitly state this. The focus is on the removal itself.
* **D: Aloi sha n hti mai ai shakum jangwan masat ni (It will be a new type of decoration):** This is unlikely. Removing graffiti doesn't inherently create a new decoration.



"
Yungwi poi lamang ni a gara lamang gaw nkau poi lawm sa ni ai hku na mahkrum madup a ahkyak ai daw ngu sawn la na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: ma kaji ni hpe woi sa ai**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q)** asks what the speaker (Nkau) and her friends did in their spare time.
* **The Answer (A)** says they went to the market to buy things. This aligns with the context in the paragraph where the speaker mentions they ""go to the market to buy things"" (ma kaji ni hte dinghku nta masha ni matu lak san camping ginra ni galaw wa ai).  The whole paragraph is about leisure activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dai shara kaw camp galaw ai (They went camping)** - While camping is mentioned, it's stated as one of the things they *could* do, not necessarily what they *did*.
* **C: shana hta hpang hkrat hkra yungwi hpaw da ai (They hunted animals)** -  There's no mention of hunting in the paragraph.
* **D: jau jau poi de shang ai (They played jau jau)** - Jau jau is mentioned as a leisure activity they *could* do, not necessarily what they *did*.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a group going camping.** It mentions packing things, going to the mountains, and setting up camp.
* **Question Q asks *how* they are doing this camping.**  It wants to know the method or way they are camping.
* **Option C (""shara shinggan kaw camp galaw ai"") translates to ""camping with a tent.""** This is the most logical and common way to go camping, fitting with the descriptions in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: shana kaw aten lai hkawm sa ai (""sleeping bag and blanket together"")** - While someone *could* sleep with a sleeping bag and blanket, it doesn't describe the act of camping itself.
* **B: dinghku ni na matu shara kaw nga ai (""packing things according to the list"")** - This describes *preparing* for camping, not the camping activity itself.
* **D: jau jau poi de shang ai (""being very happy and having fun"")** - This describes the *feeling* of camping, not *how* they are camping.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, dingdung Mexico Nnan kaw shana poi ginra tam ai shaloi bu hkawm ai ni hku nna gara shara hpe koi ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Pueblo mare ni**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the Pueblo people as having lived in the region for a long time, building distinctive settlements (like those in Albuquerque and Santa Fe).  The passage also mentions their unique cultural practices and connection to the land. The question asks about the people who have lived there for a long time and built those distinctive settlements. Therefore, ""Pueblo mare ni"" (Pueblo people) is the most accurate answer.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: mare kaji hta nga ai tsa seng (The people who came later):** The passage explicitly contrasts the Pueblo people with later arrivals, stating they were the original inhabitants.
*   **C: gat seng galu ni (the people who were conquered):** While there was conflict and conquest, the primary point of the passage isn't about subjugation.
*   **D: Hpaida wang ni (The people who arrived in the past):** While ""hpaida wang ni"" means ""people who arrived in the past"", it doesn't specify *who* those people are. ""Pueblo mare ni"" provides that specific identity.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""Kaning rai nme law, hpaida wang ni yawng ngu na daram gaw luhpa ni daw jaw ai hte nkau mi gaw mying loi gumhkawng ai shangwi shapyaw ai baw ni jashawn da ma ai (grau kaba ai ni mahtang gaw Albuquerque hte Santa Fe hpe shing grup da ai)."" This translates to: ""Indeed, the highways of the young and the old, and the people of the world, have always been drawn to the beautiful and majestic scenery (the famous group of Albuquerque and Santa Fe).""

Therefore, Santa Fe is explicitly mentioned as being part of this famous scenic group.  Options A and B are incorrect because they refer to general highway systems or pueblo villages, not specifically the picturesque areas. Option D refers to the highways of the young and old, which is too broad.



"
Jailang jahpan hpe myit tsang ai bu hkawm ai ni hku nna gara luhpa ntsin hpe koi yen mayu na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Australian tsabyin jahku**.

Here's why:

The text mentions that New Zealand and Australia are known for their coffee culture. The question asks about a Japanese beverage popular in Australia. The text then describes Australian coffee, including flat white and its ingredients. While it doesn't explicitly state a popular *Japanese* beverage in Australia, the context strongly implies that the question is testing understanding of the text's connection between Australian and New Zealand coffee cultures. Therefore, ""Australian tsabyin jahku"" (Australian coffee culture) is the most logical answer.  The text focuses on Australian coffee and mentions New Zealand's, linking them.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai shara hte maren, lawu kaw na gara luhpa ntsin htet ai lam gaw daw jau galaw wa hku nna myit shanut chye rai?","The correct answer is **C: New Zealand kaw na Sauvignon Blanc langai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""French tsabyi jahku hpe lu la na matu grai law nga ai rai timung New Zealand hte Australia ni a tsabyi jahku ni grau kaja ai hku du wa chye ai."" This translates to ""The French style of wine is popular, and the wines from New Zealand and Australia are particularly popular.""
* It further mentions Sauvignon Blanc specifically in relation to New Zealand: ""Australia masha ni a matu, flat white coffee a hpaji gaw laga mungdan re."" This translates to ""Australia is famous for its flat white coffee.  New Zealand's famous wine is Sauvignon Blanc.""

Therefore, the question asks about a popular drink from New Zealand that pairs well with the mentioned food, and the passage directly links Sauvignon Blanc to New Zealand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kadun ai a chyang langai:** This refers to the chocolate dessert.
* **B: Number One langai:** The passage mentions ""Number One"" in the context of wine popularity, but doesn't specify what kind of wine.
* **D: flat white langai:** Flat white is a coffee drink from Australia, not a wine.



"
"tsa ban masum galu hkra, lamu ga maden je ai aten ladaw hpe gara uhpung ni hpang wa sai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Spain jauman ni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Spain jauman ni gaw tsa ban masum dang galu lai wa sai lamu ga maden je ai aten ladaw hpe shawng hpang lai wa sai re.""  This translates to: ""The Spanish colonizers were very greedy and wanted to seize the treasures and lands.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Payaguá & Guaycurú:** The text mentions these as indigenous groups who drank Guaraní, but it doesn't connect them to greed or treasure-seeking.
*   **Guaraní:** Guaraní is mentioned in the context of the drink and the people who consumed it, not as a colonizing force.

Therefore, the sentence directly refers to the **Spanish colonizers** as being greedy and wanting to seize wealth.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Paris masha kaw na warm up lu na matu, gara gaw kaja dik ai lam rai?","The correct answer is **A: Paris mare masha na myit jasat hpe lenla na matu shakut na**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the *warm-up* for Paris's mannerisms, and what is the *correct way* to behave?
* **The text states:** Paris's mannerisms are shaped by a long history of being raised in a manner (""bien élevé"").  It implies this is a cultivated behavior.
* **Option A (Paris mare masha na myit jasat hpe lenla na matu shakut na):** This translates to ""To imitate the mannerisms of Paris's people"" or ""To learn the mannerisms of people from Paris."" This directly addresses the ""warm-up"" aspect of understanding how to behave like someone from Paris.  It suggests observation and learning.
* **Option B (myit mahkam hpe madu hkum kamhpa ai myit hte asan brang hpaw tsun dan na):** This translates to ""To eat and drink according to the rules of etiquette."" While etiquette is important, it's not the core of *mannerisms*.
* **Option C (sumnung shingdi ai hku nga na):** This translates to ""To practice with a smile."" Smiling is a pleasant gesture, but not the central aspect of defining someone's mannerisms.
* **Option D (pyaw pyaw nga chye ai kumla madun na):** This translates to ""To do things with a calm heart."" While calmness is a positive trait, it's not specific to the nuances of Parisian mannerisms.

Therefore, option A best captures the essence of understanding and mimicking the established mannerisms of people from Paris as a ""warm-up"" to behaving appropriately.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Paris mare masha ni a lai chyasi madang ngu nsawn ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Grai gawng ai** (Grai is being treated harshly/abused).

Here's why:

The text describes children in Paris being treated harshly (""grai gawng ai ngu nang hpe myit wa shangun na ra ai"" - ""they are beaten and abused with the palm of the hand"").  The phrase ""bien élevé"" (well-raised) is used sarcastically to highlight the contrast between the outward appearance and the reality of the children's suffering.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: Grai gawng ai (Grai is being treated harshly/abused):** This accurately reflects the description in the text.
* **B: zai ai (being gentle/kind):** The text explicitly states the opposite – the children are not treated kindly.
* **C: grai a kam ai (grai is being used as a tool):** While the harsh treatment might be *used* as a way to control or discipline, the core issue is the *harshness* of the treatment itself.
* **D: dawk dawk nga chye tsun ai (being treated with respect/honor):** This is the complete opposite of what the text describes.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that aligns with the meaning of the provided text.



"
Cape Mare na MetroRail Nambat langai Dum hkum a kaja ai akyu gaw hpa rai?,"The correct answer is **A: wanleng gawk gaw wanleng na shawng kaw re**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Wanleng shagu gaw MetroPlus hte wanleng gawk ni nga ai re; Metroplus gawk ni gaw galoi mung Cape Town hte ni dik htum ai wanleng a hpang jahtum de nga ai re.""  This translates to: ""The train schedule is for MetroPlus and the regular train. The regular train schedule is mostly for Cape Town and the opposite direction.""

Therefore, the regular train's (wanleng) schedule is related to the regular train's (wanleng) direction. Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: masha nau nlaw ai (fastest)** - The text doesn't mention anything about the fastest train.
*   **C: Nambat masum latmat hta grau manu hpa ai (serves the most people from the central station)** - While Metro is a central station, the text doesn't state that it *serves the most people*.
*   **D: Metro latmat na manu hte maren sha re (serves the people of Metro and the opposite direction)** - The text says the regular train is *mostly* for Cape Town and the opposite direction, not that it *serves the people of Metro*.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Cape Mare kaw na aten man sumtsan kaw nna bungli sa ai wanleng shagu kaw hpa nga ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Nambat langai hte Nambat masum wanleng gawk ni**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the MetroRail system consists of two main lines: MetroPlus (the ""national high-speed line"") and Metro (the ""national regular line"").
* The question asks about the connection between these two lines.
* The passage explicitly says: ""Wanleng shagu gaw MetroPlus hte wanleng gawk ni nga ai"" which translates to ""The network is connected by MetroPlus and regular lines.""
* Option D accurately reflects this connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: masha nau nlaw ai Metro wanleng gawk (High-speed Metro regular line):**  This isn't a specific connection mentioned in the passage.
* **B: nambat lahkawng na matu latmat manu bung ai (national high-speed line that connects people):** While MetroPlus connects people, this isn't the *connection* between the two line types.
* **C: n bung ai nambat masum (the regular national line):** This only refers to one of the line types, not their connection.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, jahten latung ni mahkoi n galaw ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: ana shabra ai lam (your own path)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes self-reliance and personal responsibility.** It speaks of not relying on others, being diligent in one's own work, and having the patience and determination to achieve goals.  It stresses the importance of each individual forging their own way.
* **Option C directly reflects this theme.** ""Ana shabra ai lam"" means ""your own path"" or ""your own way.""  It aligns with the passage's message of self-reliance.
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * **A: tin shapun byin shangun ai (learning from mistakes):** While learning from mistakes is important, it's not the core message the passage is conveying. The passage is more about proactive effort.
    * **B: masin sha-pawt ai hkum ahpun shangun ai (learning from others' experiences):** The passage actively discourages relying on others.
    * **D: n-gun lasang hkumhkang machyi byin shangun ai (learning from the wisdom of ancestors):**  While respecting tradition is important, the primary focus is on individual effort and determination.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate response to the question about how to navigate life's challenges according to the passage.
"
prepaid phone card ni hpe gara kaw mai mari ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: masat da ai mungdan nkau ni hta**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where someone has lost their phone and is trying to get a replacement. It mentions needing to buy a new phone card (shagu kaw phone shaga na matu hkrak nga ai shaloi). The phrase ""masat da ai mungdan nkau ni hta"" translates to ""for the good money of the lost card"". This implies using the money on the lost card to purchase a new one.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: wanleng dabang ni hta** - ""for a whole day"" -  This doesn't logically connect to getting a new phone card.
*   **C: lamjut gatseng ni hta** - ""for a few days"" -  Same as above, doesn't fit the context.
*   **D: shawa phone ni hta** - ""for a cheap phone"" - While you might get a cheap phone, the question is about a phone card.

Therefore, option A is the only one that makes sense in the context of the provided text.
"
Grau kaja ai shaga manu ni hpe nkau cards ni gara hku access galaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: masat da ai mungdan ni kaw sha access mai ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a phone is being used for illegal activities.** The text mentions ""gumhpraw bang na mai lang ai phone hte mi na telephone ni hta tau gumhpraw bang sha hta nchye na na daram hpring taw ai"" (phone used for illegal activities and used to commit illegal acts through telephone).  It then says the phone is used to ""alak mi galaw da ma ai"" (to harass people) and ""jung manu nla ai sha ga shaga jak law malawng kaw na mai shaga ai manu jahpu njaw ra ai ga shaga jak ni hku nna kalang marang mai re"" (to manipulate people, use their information for malicious purposes, and use this information to harm them).

* **Question Q asks about accessing personal information.**  The passage strongly implies that the phone is being used to obtain and use personal information (""masat da ai mungdan ni kaw sha access mai ai"" - access personal information).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: manu jahpu n jaw ra ai nambat ni hku na** (to manipulate people and use their personal information) - This is too broad. While manipulation *might* be involved, the question specifically asks about *accessing* the information.
* **C: lamjut gatseng hta** (continue to the next step) - This is irrelevant.
* **D: shawa phone jai lang nna hte bungjat manu jaw nna** (using a compromised phone and manipulating people) -  While the phone is compromised, the core of the question is about *accessing* the personal information, not just the compromise itself.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and direct answer based on the context of the passage.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara hpun gaw Plitvice Nawng Myu sha Nampan sun hta nau n mu lu ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: marau hpun amyu mi (Pika)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Europa kaw na tsap mut, chyahkyawn, wa hpai galang, u hku, mai tsan kadun nyau, nam nau hte **capercaillie u ni sha n-ga kaga amyu baw hpan malawng ni zawn re taw wa sai ginra pra dusat ni hpe mai mu lu ai.**""

This translates to: ""...the forests, meadows, swamps, mountains, young forests, deer, and **capercaillie are often found in the forests, where the chamois and other mountain animals live.**""

The passage mentions capercaillie and chamois (which are types of mountain animals).  The question asks which animal is commonly found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. The text explicitly links chamois and other mountain animals to the area. Therefore, the answer is the **marau hpun amyu mi (Pika)**, as Pikas are small mountain animals found in similar environments. While the passage doesn't *specifically* name Pika, ""marau hpun amyu mi"" is the closest and most logical answer based on the context.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kinsa hpun (Mushrooms)** - While mushrooms might grow in the area, they are not the focus of the passage and not explicitly linked to the park's inhabitants.
*   **B: wamyi hpun (Bushes)** - Bushes are part of the environment, but again, not directly linked to the animal life the passage describes.
*   **C: marau hpun (Chamois)** - While chamois *are* mentioned, the passage speaks of *other* mountain animals as well, and the question asks for a general animal found in the park, not just one specific type. The mention of ""other mountain animals"" makes ""marau hpun amyu mi"" a better, more encompassing choice.



"
Lawu kaw na gara ginra pra dusat hpe Plitvice Nawng Myu sha Nampan sun hta mu mai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Europa kaw na tsap mut, chyahkyawn, wa hpai galang, u hku, mai tsan kadun nyau, **nam nau hte capercaillie u ni sha n-ga kaga amyu baw hpan malawng ni zawn re taw wa sai ginra pra dusat ni hpe mai mu lu ai.**""

This translates to: ""...European forests, meadows, mountains, cliffs, young forests, **wild boars and capercaillie are found in the area, and the roe deer are frequently seen in the woods.**""

The question asks what bird is specifically mentioned as being found in Plitvice Lakes National Park. The text explicitly names the **Capercaillie**.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U Magwi** - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Honey Badger** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Cassowary** - Cassowaries are native to Australia and New Guinea, not Europe.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shara code ni gaw hpa hpe karum ya ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: lagu galaw ai lam hpe makawp maga ai lam**.

Here's why:

The question asks what kind of code is needed to make a ""shiga lamang ni hpe makawp maga"" (which translates roughly to ""make something move or function""). The text mentions ""code gaw tara nshang ai re"" which means ""code that is used to make something work"". The text also emphasizes that the code must be able to ""makawp maga"" (make move/function).

Let's break down the options:

*   **A: kompyuta datpa hkrang bung galaw ai lam (computer data processing path):** While code *uses* computer data processing, it's not the *type* of code being asked about.
*   **B: gat lawk renghkang ai lam (general knowledge path):**  This is irrelevant to writing code.
*   **C: lagu galaw ai lam hpe makawp maga ai lam (path to make a program/software move/function):** This aligns with the context of writing code to make something work or function, especially software or programs.  ""Lagu galaw"" can be interpreted as a program or a set of instructions to move something.
*   **D: upadi hte n htan shai ai hkrang bung galaw ai lam (path of the CPU and RAM):**  This describes the hardware components involved in running code, not the code itself.

Therefore, option C is the most logical and accurate answer based on the given text.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shiga dap ni gaw shara code hte seng nna masu ai hpe matut nga da hkun ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **A: shanhte hpe gat lawk renghkang ai lam grau lu na matu ra ahkyak ai**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* the Shiga Dap (a certain type of entry) doesn't allow certain people to enter, even when they have the correct code.  The passage states that the Shiga Dap's security measures (shanhte) are designed to prevent those who aren't truly deserving (grau lu na matu ra) from entering, even if they have the code.  Therefore, the reason is that the security system prioritizes proper qualification over simply having the code.

Let's break down the other options:

* **B: shanhte gaw tara nshang hkrang bung galaw ai hpe koi yen na matu karum ya ai:** This is about the security system preventing wrong actions, not the reason for excluding people with the correct code.
* **C: shanhte gaw gumhpraw kyi na matu akyu jaw ya ai:** This describes the security system being overly strict, which is *part* of the reason, but not the core *why* people are excluded.
* **D: shanhte gaw lagu galaw ai lam hpe makawp ya na matu karum ai taw ai:**  This talks about the security system being lenient, which contradicts the passage's emphasis on strictness and proper qualification.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the passage's explanation that the Shiga Dap's security measures (shanhte) are focused on ensuring only those who are truly deserving (grau lu na matu ra) are allowed entry, even if they possess the correct code.

"tinang dum nta bu ga de du ai shaloi, gara bungli mahkrun gaw shawoi na zawn yu maya rai?","The correct answer is **C: tinang na rai a tara shang masat masa**.

Here's why:

* **P (Question):** The question asks about something that appears in a place and causes things to move, and which is a consequence of something being ""like a mountain"" (indicating a large, powerful entity). It suggests a strong, impactful force.
* **Q (Question):**  This question asks what the cause of the phenomena described in P is, specifically referencing the appearance of something and the movement it causes.
* **A (Answer A):** ""masha htawt shang jep ai lam"" - This translates to ""the path of a powerful gust of wind."" While wind can cause movement, it doesn't quite fit the ""like a mountain"" descriptor from P.
* **B (Answer B):** ""tinang a rai ni hpe ndau shana ai lam"" - This translates to ""the path of something that causes shaking."" Shaking is a result of something causing movement, not the cause itself.
* **C (Answer C):** ""tinang na rai a tara shang masat masa"" - This translates to ""the cause that appears and is a consequence of great power/force."" This directly aligns with the descriptions in P - something appearing and causing movement, stemming from a powerful force.
* **D (Answer D):** ""htung hking renghkang ai lam"" - This translates to ""the path of something that is constantly moving."" This doesn't explain the appearance and the cause of movement described in P.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer because it captures the essence of the cause mentioned in the initial question.



"
tinang a dum nta buga de n du wa shi shaloi lawu kaw na gara hpe chye da ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: Lama nang gaw tara shang ndau da ai lam ni hta lai na arai ni hpe ndau mayu ai rai yang**.

Here's why:

* **P asks about a past experience related to Japan and travel.** The speaker is reminiscing about a trip to Japan, specifically mentioning experiences related to travel and possibly seeing something or someone memorable.
* **Q asks about the reason for the speaker's current feeling of being at ease/content.** The question asks *why* the speaker feels this way now.

Let's break down the options:

* **A: Lama dai hta mying jahpan jep ai lam nga yang (The path where I went to Japan)** - This is simply stating the path of travel. It doesn't explain *why* the speaker feels at ease.
* **B: Lama nang gaw tara shang ndau da ai lam ni hta lai na arai ni hpe ndau mayu ai rai yang (The reason is the thing you saw on the path of going to the countryside)** - This option directly addresses the ""why"" by suggesting that something seen on the way to the countryside (which is linked to the Japan trip in P) is the reason for the speaker's current feeling of ease. This is a logical and plausible answer.
* **C: Lama dai hta htung hking renghkang ai lam nga yang (The path of the mountain where I went)** - This again just states a path (mountain path) and doesn't explain the feeling of ease.
* **D: Lama tinang la wa ai rai ni hpe ahkang n jaw da ai rai yang (The thing you ate on the way that made you feel happy)** - This focuses on something eaten, but the question asks about a feeling of being at ease/content, not necessarily happiness from food.

Therefore, option B is the most coherent and logical response to both P and Q. It connects the past travel experience to the current feeling by suggesting a specific element (something seen on the countryside path) as the cause."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Cochamó Hkaraw lapran bumlung ai ni hpe lam nnan tam mu na matu hpa gaw ahkang jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: bum nchyun ni**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the reason is for the Cochamó Hkaraw region to have so many tourism opportunities. The passage states: ""Bum nchyun kaw na nsa sa hkring shara lawm ai bum pungding."" This translates to ""The rich and beautiful landscapes are surrounded by magnificent mountains.""  The key phrase is ""bum nchyun"" which means **mountains**.

Therefore, the abundance of mountains is the reason for the region's tourism potential.  Option C, ""bum nchyun ni"" (mountain day/reason), best captures this meaning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ningmu ginra ni** (beautiful flower day/reason): The passage doesn't mention flowers as a key attraction.
* **B: bum pungding ni** (beautiful forest day/reason): While forests might be present, the mountains are emphasized as the main draw.
* **D: Shakum ni** (shale day/reason): Shale is a type of rock and not the primary reason for tourism opportunities in this context.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Southern Hemisphere hta kadai gaw law malawng lai ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gara pyenli hpung mung dingda maga na Hemisphere kaw na panglai matsum hpe nlu lai ma ai (hte SkyTeam hpung mung nlu lai ma ai). Hpa wa rai rai, Star Alliance gaw Santiago de Chile to Tahiti ngu ai LATAM mungkan nbungli kaw na Dingda Pacific a sinpraw maga hta lai nna shara shagu de shara la da ai.""

This translates to: ""For the sake of connecting flights in the Hemisphere, (SkyTeam flights are not connected). On the other hand, Star Alliance connects LATAM flights from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti across the Pacific Ocean.""

Therefore, Star Alliance is the airline alliance mentioned as connecting flights across the Pacific Ocean, and the question asks which alliance is mentioned in connection with Southern Hemisphere travel.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: SkyTeam** - The passage explicitly states SkyTeam *does not* connect flights.
*   **C: Dingda Pacific** - This refers to the Pacific Ocean, not an airline alliance.
*   **D: LATAM Oneworld** - Oneworld is not mentioned in the passage. The passage only mentions LATAM and Star Alliance.



"
"Southern Hemisphere hta, gara pyenli alliance gaw panglai lai hti hkum shadang yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: Star Alliance**.

The passage states: ""Star Alliance gaw Santiago de Chile to Tahiti ngu ai LATAM mungkan nbungli kaw na Dingda Pacific a sinpraw maga hta lai nna shara shagu de shara la da ai."" This translates to ""Star Alliance, LATAM's alliance, operates flights from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti across the Pacific."" Therefore, Star Alliance is the alliance mentioned in relation to flights in the Southern Hemisphere.
"
Gara bu hkawm hpung gaw Mungkan Lagat Shingjawng hpung hpe matut hkap la sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Copenhagen Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...sa lagat uhpung ni gaw dan mali hta na gat shingjawng lawm masha law law hte zinghkri nga ai. Shawa n-gun jaw ai lam ni hte rau Barcelona kaw Barcelona gat shingjawng poi hte Copehagen na Copenhagen gat shingjawng poi kaw Prague kaw galaw ai Prague gat shingjawng lamang hte laga sha ra kaw na ni lawan shakap wa ma ai.""

This translates to: ""...you can get a loan with interest and repay it in installments.  You can also borrow a car for a day and travel to Barcelona, then Copenhagen, then Prague, and travel to Prague for a day and get a loan to cover the expenses.""

The question asks which club's loan is mentioned. The text explicitly states ""Copenhagen na Copenhagen gat shingjawng poi"" (Copenhagen in Copenhagen club) and ""Prague kaw galaw ai Prague gat shingjawng lamang"" (Prague for Prague club).

Therefore, the correct answer is Copenhagen.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Sa Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung hku sightrunning hpung kade hpe matut mahkai na matu karum sai rai?","The correct answer is **A: mali (yes)**.

Here's why:

The first part of the question states: ""Mungkan ga hku na gaw, mungkan hta lagat shingjawng uhpung uhpawng 200 daram nga ai."" This translates to ""It's possible for you to go, and for you to buy a scarf worth 200 dollars.""

The second part of the question asks if it's possible to sightrunning in a scarf made of ""Sa Lagat Shingjawng lamang hpung"" (a specific type of scarf).

Since the first sentence establishes a general possibility (""It's possible for you to go...""), and the question then asks about a specific scenario involving the scarf, the answer is **yes (mali)**. The number 200 is mentioned but not relevant to the question of sightrunning. The other options don't make sense in context.



"
Mungkan bu hkawm ai hku na lapaw te hpe asan sha yu na matu hpa galaw ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **B: sumwum hkawm ai lam**.

Here's why:

The question asks which of the options refers to the type of safari that ""nari hkum nkau mi (sh) nhtoi law law lagaw lam bu hkawm ai lam lawm ai"" (highly skilled and experienced people like).

The text states that ""Lam hkawm ai safari ( """"""""sumwum hkawm ai lam"""""""", """"""""lagaw lam bu hkawm ai safari"""""""", (sh) """"""""lagaw hte hkawm sa ai"""""""" ngu nna ma shaga ai) kaw gaw nari hkum nkau mi..."" This translates to ""Vehicle safari ( """"""""sumwum hkawm ai lam"""""""", """"""""lagaw lam bu hkawm ai safari"""""""", (sh) """"""""lagaw hte hkawm sa ai"""""""" - which are not mentioned) is for highly skilled and experienced people...""

Therefore, ""sumwum hkawm ai lam"" (vehicle safari) is the type of safari that highly skilled people prefer.  Option B directly names this type of safari.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai shaloi gara dusat hpan hte mahkoi hkrum kadup na rai?","The correct answer is **B: Lagaw galau dusat ni**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is often seen *during* a safari, specifically related to the actions of the animals. The text states: ""Dai zawn magoi hte lagaw galau dusat ni hpe mawdaw hte a ni sha sa yu ai ngut nna atsawm lu yu na matu rai ni hpe mung la sa na ahkang jaw da ai."" This translates to: ""During this time, herds of elephants and buffaloes are often seen chasing after the antelope, and the lion hunts them.""  Therefore, ""lagaw galau dusat ni"" (chasing/hunting) is a key activity seen during a safari.



* **A: Hkanghkyi (Birds)** - While birds are seen, the text focuses on the interaction between larger animals.
* **C: Rawnggawk (Colorful)** - This describes the appearance of animals, but not their actions.
* **D: Lapaw te (Striped)** - This describes the appearance of animals, but not their actions.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa gaw bu hkawm sa hkrun lam a manu hpe shayawm ya na rai?","The correct answer is **D: masha kru (sh) kru hta grau ai uhpung hpe tam na**

Here's why:

The paragraph describes how the ""masha uhpung"" (likely referring to some kind of beneficial substance or resource) can be used to heal wounds and ailments. It states that if a person is injured and has this ""masha uhpung,"" applying it to the wound will help.  It also mentions that it can be used to treat internal issues.

The question asks how to use the ""masha uhpung"" to heal wounds and illnesses. Option D directly aligns with this:

* **masha kru (sh) kru hta grau ai uhpung hpe tam na:** ""Apply the masha uhpung that is mixed with herbs."" (This is the most accurate interpretation based on the context.  The paragraph hints at mixing with herbs).



Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: tinang hkrai sa na:** ""Apply it directly.""  While applying it is mentioned, the paragraph suggests a more specific method, likely involving herbs.
* **B: masha mali uhpung hpe tam na:** ""Apply the beneficial masha uhpung."" This is too general.  The paragraph implies it needs to be mixed with herbs for optimal effectiveness.
* **C: kaga masha langai hte sa na:** ""Apply the remaining masha."" This is unclear and doesn't address the healing aspect.



Therefore, **D** is the most logical and contextually accurate answer.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, kaja dik ai bu hkawm sa hkrun lam manu hpe kadai lu la mayu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: hkrun lam arau hkawm ai manang lahkawng**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a community is facing hardship and scarcity.** The text talks about lack of food, the need to protect resources, and the potential for conflict. It emphasizes a struggle for survival.
* **The question asks about the cause of conflict or disputes within the community.**
* **Option C (""hkrun lam arau hkawm ai manang lahkawng"" - meaning ""disputes arising from competition for resources"") directly addresses the underlying cause of conflict suggested in the passage.** The scarcity of resources (food, land, etc.) would naturally lead to competition and disputes.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: madaw galai jawn mayu ai mungkan bu hkawm masha ni** (meaning ""a community that has been blessed with good fortune""). This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **B: masha masum uhpung** (meaning ""a pure/innocent community""). While the community might have good intentions, the difficult circumstances are likely to lead to challenges.
* **D: masha marai manga uhpung** (meaning ""a community that is easily angered""). While hardship can increase tension, the root cause of conflict isn't simply being easily angered; it's the competition for resources.



Therefore, option C is the most logical and accurate response based on the provided passage.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, San Francisco na mungkan matsing masat ai lam hpe kadai gaw karum ningtum ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: shingni hpaji hte shawa matut mahkai ai hkrang kumla law law hta jahkring hkring shang lawm ai lam**

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the ways San Francisco has become a melting pot.** The passage describes San Francisco as a place where different cultures have mingled and blended, creating a unique mix.
* **Option A, ""shingni hpaji hte shawa matut mahkai ai hkrang kumla law law hta jahkring hkring shang lawm ai lam"" translates to ""ways that different ethnicities and cultures have mingled and blended together.""** This directly reflects the passage's description of San Francisco's cultural fusion.
* **Option B, ""tsaw dik madang zuphpawng ginra ni"" translates to ""the streets of the past.""** This is not relevant to San Francisco's current status as a melting pot.
* **Option C, ""amyu hkum ai sut masa hpaji lam"" translates to ""the road of ancient customs.""** While San Francisco has historical roots, it doesn't specifically describe its current melting pot status.
* **Option D, ""byin mai masa nga ai Asha dan lusha"" translates to ""the lushly growing Asha dan of different ethnicities.""** This is a bit ambiguous and doesn't fully capture the dynamic mixing of cultures described in the passage.



Therefore, **Option A** is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses how San Francisco has become a melting pot through the blending of different ethnicities and cultures.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw San Francisco hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: sumla hkrung hte laika buk ni hta jahkring hkring lawm ai**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""San Francisco gaw mungdan kaw nga ai Asha dan: Korea, Thai, Kala hte Japan masha ni a lusha mai lu ai hkrak dik htum ai shara ni kaw na langai rai nga ai."" This translates to: ""San Francisco is a city that welcomes Asha from: Korea, Thai, Kala (likely referring to Chinese), and Japan, where many people live and work.""
* **Option A aligns with this:** ""sumla hkrung hte laika buk ni hta jahkring hkring lawm ai"" translates to ""welcoming diverse cultures and people.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Asha lusha gaw chyam bra nga ai:** This translates to ""Asha's beauty is pleasing to the eye."" While Asha people might be considered beautiful, the passage focuses on the *diversity* of Asha people, not just their physical beauty.
* **C: manam dap hte zuphpawng ginra shara law law nga ai:** This translates to ""welcoming diverse minds and perspectives."" While San Francisco likely *does* welcome diverse minds, the passage specifically mentions the *presence* of people from different cultures and their work/living there.
* **D: sut masa hpaji lam gaw mungkan bu hkom bungli magam ntsa yawng nawng shamyet nga ai:** This translates to ""a place where the sound of bustling streets and diverse city life are always present."" While San Francisco is a bustling city, the passage doesn't focus on the *sound* or the *city life* itself, but on the *people* from various cultures.



Therefore, option A is the best fit based on the information provided in the passage."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm kasa magam gun ya ai hpe jai lang ai kaw nna gara bu hkawm masha gaw mahkoi ahkyu n lu na rai?","The correct answer is **D: gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam lajang ai hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari ai hpe ra sharawng ai bu hkawm masha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a very luxurious and extravagant lifestyle.** It mentions ""hotel daw ni lawm ai gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam ni lajang da nga ai"" (luxurious and grand activities) and ""lam na a hkrun lam a matu ra kadawn ai matsing ninghting laika pa ni hpe aten la na myit ra yang mung"" (spending money on things that make your life comfortable).
* **The question asks about the lifestyle of someone with a lot of money.**
* **Option D directly reflects this luxurious description.** It states ""gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam lajang ai hpe tau hkrau lakmat mari ai hpe ra sharawng ai bu hkawm masha"" which translates to ""the lifestyle of someone who enjoys spending money on luxurious and grand activities.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: masai marai re ai bu hkawm ai masha (the lifestyle of the Masai tribe):** The passage doesn't mention the Masai tribe.
* **B: madu myit hte sha galaw chye ai bu hkawm masha (the lifestyle of someone who is hardworking and diligent):** While the passage mentions spending money, it doesn't emphasize hard work or diligence. It focuses on extravagance.
* **C: shanhte a mungdan shang lakmat hpe galai n lu la shi ai bu hkawm masha (the lifestyle of someone who is known for their good reputation):** The passage doesn't mention reputation. It focuses on wealth and luxurious activities.



Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately captures the lifestyle depicted in the passage.



"
Hkrun lam magam bungli galaw ai ni kaw na tau hkrau shawng htet da lakmat mari akyu hku nna lawu kaw na gara gaw laika hta n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: yawng lawm ai gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam lajang da ai lam ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a type of massage:** The passage details a specific kind of massage that uses ""bungli"" (likely referring to tools or techniques involving pushing and rubbing) and focuses on stimulating points. It mentions hotel-like facilities.
* **Question asks for the type of massage mentioned:** The question asks to identify the type of massage described in the passage.
* **Option C directly matches the description:** Option C, ""yawng lawm ai gumhpawn masat tawn ai hkrun lam lajang da ai lam ni"" which translates to ""a massage performed in a welcoming, luxurious setting using pushing and rubbing techniques,"" perfectly aligns with the detailed description in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lawan ladan re bu hkawm ai hte seng ai laika ni (traditional and not currently practiced massage):** The passage doesn't indicate whether it's traditional or not, but it strongly implies it's currently practiced in a modern setting (hotel-like).
* **B: manam dap hte seng ai myit hkrum ai lam (massage without mental relaxation):** The passage emphasizes stimulating points and a particular technique, which doesn't necessarily mean it lacks relaxation.
* **D: alak mi lajang da ai lam galaw da ai (massage for aching muscles):** While the massage might help with aching muscles, the passage describes it as more than just a muscle-focused massage; it involves specific techniques and a particular setting.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, real-time ga gale ai application ni n lu galaw ai gaw hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: internet hte matut mahkai mai ai phone hku nna arai ni kaw na laika ni hpe gale ya ai**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndai amyu bawhpan kaw na dan dawng htum app ni kaw na langai gaw, internet kaw na ra sharawng ai ga hpan jahpan lamang ni hpe kaga de htawt la da ngut ai hpang ai internet nra ai sha ga gale ai lam galaw la lu na ahkang jaw ya ai Google ga gale ai lam re."" (Translation: ""The applications that are frequently used in our daily lives, and that we frequently look for on our smartphones, are downloaded from the internet, which is commonly used in Japan, and which Google provides."")

This clearly indicates that real-time applications rely on an internet connection to function.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maigan ga hkum ni gale ya ai (it can operate without a phone)** - The passage explicitly states these are *smartphone* applications.
* **B: laika daw ni yawng hpe gale ya ai (it can operate with older phones)** - While some applications might be compatible with older phones, the core functionality of real-time apps is tied to an internet connection, which isn't guaranteed on older devices.
* **D: tsalam shadang hta tsa 100% aten tup hkrak jaw hkra gale ya ai (it can operate with a 100% stable network)** - The passage doesn't mention a 100% stable network requirement. Real-time apps *need* an internet connection, but it doesn't have to be perfectly stable, though stability impacts performance.
"
line n nga laika gale ai hpe hpa gaw ahkang jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: real-time laika gale ya ai amyu bawhpan kaw na application ni**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Real-time ngu ai ga shalai ya ai apps-applications gaw ga langai kaw na langai de laika yawng hpe lu shalai ya ai."" (Real-time applications are applications that can provide information in real-time based on your location.)
* **It further explains:** ""Ndai amyu bawhpan kaw na dan dawng htum app ni kaw na langai gaw, internet kaw na ra sharawng ai ga hpan jahpan lamang ni hpe kaga de htawt la da ngut ai hpang ai internet nra ai sha ga gale ai lam galaw la lu na ahkang jaw ya ai Google ga gale ai lam re."" (The application that understands your habits and location, using the internet, gets information from the internet to find what you want, like Google.)
* **The question asks:** ""line n nga laika gale ai hpe hpa gaw ahkang jaw ai rai?"" (How does it get information based on your location?)
* **Option D directly addresses this** by identifying the real-time application as the source of location-based information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: madang dep wa ai laika gale jak ni (A short period of time)** - This refers to the *speed* of data transfer, not the *source* of the location information.
* **B: phone ni (Phone)** - A phone is a device, not the application that provides location-based information.
* **C: ga hte seng ai shiga ni hpe kaga de htawt la da ai (The method of getting information without searching)** - While the application might seem to provide information without searching, it's actually using the internet to retrieve data based on your location.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen hte nlung tawng sharut ai lam a npawt nhpang n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: bungjat numri hkrat ai lam**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where a certain number of people (numri tawng) are pushing and shoving (bum ntsa kaw na) to get on a vehicle (numri).  The passage also mentions a ""crowded"" (grai) route and that the ""left"" (lam rai) side is more congested (hkrat ai) than the right.  The right side is also described as having fewer people (lang dai lamang ni hpe galaw ma ai) and less shoving.

Therefore, the question asks what type of path would be less crowded and less prone to pushing and shoving.  ""Bungjat numri hkrat ai lam"" translates to ""the path of the less crowded/less congested vehicle."" This aligns perfectly with the information in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: numri htat ai (crowded path):** This is the opposite of what the passage describes as a desirable route.
* **B: shinggyim masha (empty space):** While an empty space is less crowded, the passage focuses on the vehicle's route, not just any empty space.
* **C: jan shingkang (people's movements):** This refers to how people move, not a specific path.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hkyen hte nlung tawng sharut ai hku nna byin ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: dingchyung bum nhkren ntsa na law htam ai numri** (a numri that is connected to the heart and the body).

Here's why:

The passage describes a specific type of numri (spiritual power/energy) that is associated with both the physical body and the heart. It mentions that this numri is ""bum ntsa kaw na numri"" (a numri that radiates outwards) and that it's related to both ""grai hkrat"" (the body/physical) and ""lam byin taw chye ai"" (the path/spirit/soul).  Option C best captures this connection between the physical body and the heart.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nrun mat ai numri htat** (a numri that is related to the divine/god): While numri can be connected to the divine, the passage doesn't explicitly state this relationship.
* **B: numri n nga ai dingchyung bum nhkren ni** (a numri that is related to the body's internal energy): This is too general. The passage emphasizes a connection *between* the body and the heart.
* **D: shinggyim masha ni nhkra na ngam da ai numri** (a numri that is connected to the spirit/soul's realm): While related to the soul, the passage highlights the connection to the physical body as well.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate interpretation of the passage's description of this particular numri.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shat mai gaw gara gayau bang ai rai hta npawt da ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: ma-un chyu hte shan**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What are the reasons for the conflict between India and Pakistan?""
* **The provided text states:**
    * ""Dingdung India maga de na panglai hte tsan ai shara hte Pakistan hkan gaw nga chyu chyahkri hpe shat mai hkan madung lang ma nna..."" (Since ancient times, India and Pakistan have been in conflict...)
    * ""...dingda India maga hte kaga dan kaji a hkinggau makau shara nkau myi hkan gaw ma-un chyu hpe madung lang ma ai."" (...and also due to the disputes over territory...)

The text explicitly mentions ""ma-un chyu"" (disputes over territory) and ""shan"" (ancient animosities/historical issues) as reasons for the conflict.  Options A, B, and D don't accurately reflect the reasons mentioned in the text.
"
"Nkau shara ni hta, ma-un chyu hpe shat mai hta kalang marang gara gayau ai rai a malai jai lang ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: chyu chyana**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a conflict where the speaker is upset about the conflict between India and Pakistan, particularly regarding the division of Kashmir. The phrase ""ma-un chyu hpe shat mai hta kalang marang gara gayau ai rai a malai jai lang ai rai?"" translates to: ""Which of these things makes you very upset and agitated?""

The passage specifically mentions the ""chyu chyahkri hpe shat mai hkan madung lang ma nna"" (the division of Kashmir) as something causing anger and agitation.  Therefore, the answer that represents this core issue is ""chyu chyana"" (division of Kashmir).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shan (Shan)**: This refers to a person from the Shan ethnic group, which is irrelevant to the core issue of the conflict.
* **B: simai simaw (Simai Simaw)**: This doesn't have a clear meaning in this context.
* **D: namji nam-ya ni (Namji Nam-ya ni)**: This refers to a type of traditional Burmese ceremony/celebration, and is unrelated to the conflict mentioned.



"
Transantarctic Bum makau maja magaw gaw kawngtsaw bumpa de du na matu ra ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: laksan galaw shapraw da ai mawdaw jak ni gaw lawan ladan n re ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai ni gaw nau n lawan ai majaw hkrun lam gaw kawng tsaw bumpa de du na matu Transantarctic bum ni makau kaw grai galu hkra magaw kau ra ai.""

This translates to: ""This ice sheet, which is formed by the accumulation of snow in the high mountains, flows down to the Transantarctic Mountains and breaks off as icebergs.""

Option C directly reflects this statement by saying that the ice sheet breaks off and forms icebergs due to the movement of the glacier.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: McMurdo Dap gaw jahkring hkring pat ai** (McMurdo Station is constantly steaming): While McMurdo Station experiences extreme cold, the passage doesn't link steaming to the formation of icebergs.
*   **B: adak bang da ai numri gaw hkrit tsang ra ai** (the rock underneath is getting eroded): Erosion happens over very long periods. The passage describes a relatively rapid process of ice breaking off and forming icebergs.
*   **D: Ross Painglai hku na bu hkawm ai hta grau loi ai** (Ross Pass is not being blocked): The passage doesn't mention Ross Pass being blocked.

Therefore, **C** is the only option accurately supported by the passage.
"
"Dingda Pole Traverse ding yang, hpa hpe dawnghkawn hte masat da ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: hkyen hte hpring taw ai hkyen ugang ga hkang (Snow and ice that are constantly changing)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai shara gaw hkyen ni hte hkyen hka lwi hkang ni hte chyu hpring chyat nga nna dawnghkawn hte masat tawn da ai.""  This translates to: ""The region is constantly being covered and uncovered by snow and ice, and it is difficult to traverse.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: McMurdo dabang kaw na hkrun lam (The outskirts of McMurdo Station):** The passage mentions McMurdo as the starting point, but not the reason for the difficulty.
* **B: sau gunrai htaw ai madaw jak ni (Constantly changing weather):** While weather changes are part of the challenge, the core issue is the dynamic nature of the snow and ice itself.
* **D: bum makau hta hkrit tsang hpa maja magaw ni (The difficult terrain of the Transantarctic Mountains):** The passage mentions the Transantarctic Mountains as a geographical feature, but the difficulty lies in traversing the snow and ice *between* them, not in the mountains themselves.

Dingda Afrika de sa du masam maram ai shaloi maigan bu hkawn ai ni hku nna sadi da ra ai lama mi hpe lawu na laika kaw n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: mawdaw hte bu hkawm yang 4x4 hpe madi shadaw da ai**.

Here's why:

The paragraph describes the challenges of traveling in the interior of Africa, specifically mentioning difficult roads and the need for a 4x4 vehicle.  The question asks how people travel in the interior of Africa. Option D directly reflects this information, stating that people use 4x4 vehicles to navigate the difficult terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mungdan n bung hkat ai hta mungdan shang lakmat hte seng ai ra rawng lam n bung ai** - This option is too general and doesn't specifically address how people *travel*. It describes the characteristics of the interior.
* **B: mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai gaw beaten path shara ni de sa du na matu kaja ai lam re** - This option is partially correct about using roads, but it doesn't highlight the difficulty of those roads, which the paragraph emphasizes.
* **C: Dingda Africa na htingbu mungdan ni yawng ngu na ram gaw simsa ai** - This option is too vague. While some areas might be visited, it doesn't explain the common mode of transportation in the interior.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Dingda Africa hpe mawdaw hte bu hkawm mayu ai masha ni a matu nkaja ai hpaji jaw ai lam hku na sawn lu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: mawdaw hte bu hkawm ai gaw ayan lam ni kaw na n re sha kaga lam hku sa mayu ai ni a matu kaja ai**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks how to travel through the Deep Africa with vehicles and livestock.** The provided text details the challenges and necessary equipment (4x4s) for this.
* **Option C directly addresses the core issue:** It states that traveling with vehicles and livestock in the Deep Africa requires using animal paths, as they are the easiest routes.  This aligns perfectly with the text's emphasis on the difficult terrain and the need to follow established routes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tara upadai hku nna in-car ahkyak ahkya rai nkau hpe ra na re:** While this mentions car travel, it doesn't address the critical aspect of livestock transport or the specific challenges of the Deep Africa's terrain.
* **B: 4x4 hpe madi shadaw da tim, shara law law hpe ayan mawdaw hte sa du mai ai:** This is *partially* correct, as the text mentions 4x4s. However, it doesn't address the core challenge of finding *routes* suitable for both vehicles *and* livestock.
* **D: Dingda Africa na htingbu mungdan ni yawng gaw sa du bu hkawm na matu kaja htum n re:** This states that avoiding the deep African grasslands is necessary. The text actually emphasizes traversing *through* those grasslands with livestock.



"
Tinang na rai ni hpe n'gawn nsawn di ngam da ai a majaw byin wa mai ai hkrit tsang na lam ngu lawu na gara hpe laika hta n tsun da rai?,"The correct answer is **D: byin wa na bawm jahkrit shama ai lam hku nna daru magam ni mai mu chye ai**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where someone is experiencing a painful and debilitating illness.** It mentions a ""strong, persistent pain,"" difficulty moving, and being confined to a bed. The person is seeking a way to alleviate this suffering.
* **Option D directly reflects this need.** It says the person is looking for a way to **relieve the pain and suffering by taking medication.** The passage explicitly mentions ""bawm jahkrit shama na hpe hkrit tsang ai lam byin pru na matu myit gang ya nga ai"" - a path of taking medicine to alleviate the pain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: rai ni lagu la hkrum mai ai (It's a small, easily cured illness):** This contradicts the description of a strong, persistent pain and confinement to bed.
* **B: tinang gaw nanghpam gun hpai ai wa hku byin wa chye ai (It's a condition that one can overcome with willpower and perseverance):** While willpower might be helpful, the passage emphasizes the physical pain and the need for medication.
* **C: kaga masha na rai hte shut mat chye ai (It's a curse or a supernatural affliction):** The passage presents the illness in a physical and medical context, not a supernatural one.



"
Namhpam gun hpai ai lam hte seng nna hpa hpe laika hta n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: tinang gaw nanghpam ngun ai raitimung, mungdan daru magam ni hku nna tinang a rai ni hpe zing la mai ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a person is in a difficult situation, facing hardship and isolation.** They are trying to survive by gathering firewood.
* **Option D accurately reflects the passage's core message.** It states that the person is relying on their own skills and knowledge (the ""raitimung"" - which can be interpreted as ingenuity or resourcefulness) to overcome their challenges. They are using what they have to make the best of a bad situation (""mungdan daru magam ni hku nna tinang a rai ni hpe zing la mai ai"" - essentially, making do with what they have and finding a way to survive).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This option talks about political power and authority, which is not mentioned in the passage.
* **B:** This option describes social and economic status, again not a focus of the passage.
* **C:** This option mentions finding a solution that pleases others, which is not the person's primary concern in their survival situation.

Therefore, option D is the only one that aligns with the passage's description of a person facing hardship and using their own resourcefulness to survive."
Lawu kaw na gara luhpa gaw nta makau hkan ban sa ai laman nta hta galaw yu mai ai ngu n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: hpalap**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes chamomile tea (hpalap) as a calming drink.** It mentions its ability to relax the body and mind, and to help with sleep.
* **The question asks what kind of drink helps with sleep.**
* **Option D, ""hpalap,"" directly translates to chamomile tea, which is known for its relaxing and sleep-inducing properties.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: namsi ntsin:** This translates to ""water"" and is not typically associated with relaxation or sleep.
* **B: kahpi:** This translates to ""wine"" and is generally stimulating, not calming.
* **C: beer chyaru:** This translates to ""beer"" and is also generally stimulating.



Therefore, **hpalap (chamomile tea)** is the most logical answer to the question."
tinang a buga mare gaw tsa lu ai htunghking hte mying gumhkawng ai rai yang nta makau hkan ban sa ai laman gara de sa du mai ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: chamomile hpalap shadu ai lusha seng ni** (Chamomile flower's shade, the lush green).

Here's why:

The passage describes a scene where someone is feeling unwell and experiencing discomfort.  It talks about needing chamomile tea and seeking a cool, shady place.  The final sentence describes seeing lush green shadows cast by the plants, implying a sense of relief and peace found in that shaded area.

The question asks what alleviates the person's discomfort and provides a sense of peace. The description of the ""chamomile flower's shade, the lush green"" directly correlates to this feeling of relief and peace.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tinang na htingbu shinggan na kahpi seng ni** (The cool, shady place): While a cool, shady place is mentioned as being sought, the specific feeling of alleviation isn't directly attributed to just the place itself.  The passage emphasizes the green shadows.
* **B: namsi ntsin (sh) namsi hte chyu chyana ni kayau ai ntsin seng ni** (Cool breeze, the wind and the gentle breeze): The passage mentions needing a cool place but doesn't focus on the breeze.
* **C: tinang nau nsa ga ai tsa seng ni** (The person's own comfort):  The passage doesn't suggest the person's own comfort is the remedy, but something external, like the natural setting.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the passage's descriptions and implied meaning.



"
Uhkru jangnai ni gara shara kaw nga rai?,"The correct answer is **B: nawku jawng wang kaw**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nawku jawng wang kaw, nkau lupwa ntsa kaw myit shang sha na zawn re ai lunghpraw hte jang-nai tawn ai uhkru sumla ni nga ai.""  This translates to: ""With **sea transport**, the products of livestock farming and the products of fishing in the coastal areas are transported.""

The question asks: ""Uhkru jangnai ni gara shara kaw nga rai?"" which means ""What is the means of transporting the products?""

Therefore, the answer is ""nawku jawng wang kaw"" (sea transport).



"
gara mungdan shang lakmat hpan gaw marai langai ngai hku nna gumhpraw n-gun law law nga ai lam sakse ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Jawng ma visa (Visa on Arrival)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where someone wants to enter a country without a pre-arranged visa. It mentions the possibility of getting a ""jawng ma visa"" (Visa on Arrival) if the circumstances are right.  The text explains that a Visa on Arrival might be possible if you have a confirmed hotel booking and sufficient funds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hpaga visa (Regular Visa):** The text explicitly talks about *not* having a pre-arranged visa and inquiring about options *without* one.
*   **B: Sa chyai visa (Transit Visa):**  The text doesn't mention a transit visa.
*   **C: chyahkring chyahkra visa (Multiple Entry Visa):** The text doesn't refer to a multiple entry visa.



"
Kadai gaw jat la da ai mungdan shang lakmat ra na byin mai dik rai?,"The correct answer is **B: du hkra hte seng nna bu hkaw ai wa**.

Here's the breakdown:

* **The Question (Q):** Asks ""What is the reason for the refusal of this visa application?""
* **The Answer (A):** Says ""The applicant did not fulfill the requirements for the visa application.""  This translates to ""du hkra hte seng nna bu hkaw ai wa"" which means ""did not fulfill the requirements of the application"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ayan mungkan bu hkawm ai bu hkawm masha langai:** ""Because the applicant's previous visa was invalid."" This is a possible reason but not explicitly stated in the text.
* **C: Maigan jawng ma langai:**  This is unclear and doesn't relate to visa refusal.
* **D: Hpaga yamga bu hkawm ai wa:** ""Because the applicant's intention was not clear."" This is a possible reason, but the primary reason is a lack of fulfilling the requirements, as stated in the text.

Therefore, **B** best reflects the core reason given for the visa refusal in the text.



"
Galoi hta jigrawng hpe atsawm sadi ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: marang maling hta**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""Galoi hta jigrawng hpe atsawm sadi ra na rai?"" which translates to ""What is the result of the thief's movement being detected?"".

The passage states: ""Lama na nang gaw kahtet yawm ginra re ai marang maling de mawdaw gau wa yang, mawdaw kata shang wa ai ten second sha chyinghka gan hpaw da ai gaw dai mawdaw kata ji grawng ni atsawm shang mai nga ai."" This translates to ""When the thief is caught, the police will arrest him and the police will immediately take him to the police station.""

Therefore, the result of the thief's movement being detected is that **the thief is caught (marang maling hta)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ginhtawng shata ni laman** (a day's worth of food): This is irrelevant to the question.
* **B: Bum lung yang** (a small sound): While a sound might alert someone, it's not the direct result of *detecting* the thief's movement.
* **D: mawdaw jawn ai shaloi** (the order of the police):  This is also irrelevant to the question.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, marang maling hta mawdaw gau shaloi jigrawng ni hpe koi na matu hpa galaw ai kaw na shayawm ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: mawdaw chying hka ni hpe grai na hkra hpaw da ai lam** (The way to stop the thief by shouting).

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks how to stop a thief when they are stealing something.
* **The passage (P)** describes a situation where a thief is stealing and someone shouts.  It then states that the thief will drop the stolen item and run away.  This indicates that shouting is an effective deterrent.
* **Option A** directly addresses the solution described in the passage: shouting to stop the thief.
* **Options B, C, and D** are not supported by the information in the passage. They don't describe how the thief is stopped or the outcome of the action.  Option D describes a completely different scenario.

Therefore, **A** is the logical and correct answer based on the provided text."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw Sundarban ni hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: dai gaw mungkan kaba dik panglai makau kaw na hpun ni re** (It is a large mangrove forest).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""The Sundarbans nam maling gaw 3,850 km2 dam nna, shi a htam masum na htam mi gaw hka shing nrai, hka hpung-ya ni chyu rai nga ai."" This translates to: ""The Sundarbans forest covers 3,850 km2 and is mostly made up of dense, evergreen forests.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dai gaw naw ngam nga ai kaba dik ai maling nkau mi lawm ai** (It is a well-known place of beautiful forests): While the Sundarbans *is* beautiful, the passage focuses on its *type* of forest - mangrove.
* **B: dai na shara ka'ang hkup gaw hka hpung-ya ni re** (It is a place of evergreen forests):  This is partially true, but the passage emphasizes it's a *mangrove* forest, not just evergreen.
* **D: Dai gaw Bengal sharaw ni hta apang kap ai zau nyi law law ni a nta buga re** (It is a place where Bengal tigers live in large numbers): While Bengal tigers *do* live there, the passage's main point is about the *type of forest* itself.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
nam maling a gara daw gaw Kala mung lamu ga lapran nga ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarban Myusha Nampan sun** (Sundarbans' Mangrove Forest).

The passage states: ""The Sundarbans nam maling gaw 3,850 km2 dam nna, shi a htam masum na htam mi gaw hka shing nrai, hka hpung-ya ni chyu rai nga ai. Shaning 1966 kaw na Sundarban kaw dusat ni nga ai sanctuary nga wa sai ngut nna dai kaw Royal Bengal sharaw 400 ngut nna shanaga 30,000 daram nga na re ngu shadu ai.""  This translates to: ""The Sundarbans' mangrove forest is 3,850 km2 in area, with a unique ecosystem and diverse flora.  Since the establishment of the Sundarbans sanctuary in 1966, the Royal Bengal tiger population has increased from 400 to 30,000.""  Mangrove forests are a key characteristic of the Sundarbans' ecosystem.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: dusat dumyeng ni a shimbyi shara** (Protected area with a high level of protection): While the Sundarbans *is* a protected area, this isn't the primary reason for its unique ecosystem.
* **C: Mungkan Sali Wunli makawp Shara** (Mangrove Forest's unique characteristics):  This is too general. Option A is more specific.
* **D: Gangetic pa layang** (Gangetic river flow): The Gangetic river's flow is *related* to the Sundarbans, but it's not the defining characteristic of its ecosystem.  The mangrove forest is.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Inglik ga hpe yawm dik chye na ai lam hpe kadai gaw mahkoi lu mayu na rai?","The correct answer is **B: asak kaji ai masha ni**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mungdan law malawng gaw Inglik ga hpe hkrak chye ma ai, ngut na machye machyang mung chyoi ai - grau nna gaw asak kaji ai ramma ni rai nga ai.""  This translates to: ""Although people are not good at English, they are good at other things - their knowledge is focused on asak kaji (work/labor).""

Therefore, the question asks what the people are good at, and the passage directly states they are good at ""asak kaji"" (work/labor).

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa hpe nsen lu shapraw na matu yak na rai?","The correct answer is **A: n bung ai nsen hte re ai gasi ni (The sun and the moon)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Grau nna gaw ndai gaw grai jaw ai ga re, chye na hkra nsen shapraw na yak nga ai."" This translates to: ""The sun, the moon, and the stars are all called grai jaw (a type of colorful cloud), and they are said to be the result of the sun and the moon.""

Therefore, the answer to the question ""Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, hpa hpe nsen lu shapraw na matu yak na rai?"" which translates to ""When the sun and the moon are together, what is said to cause the stars to appear?"", is that they are said to be the cause of the stars.  The passage specifically links the stars' appearance to the sun and the moon.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: hkring dat ni (Rainy day)** - The passage doesn't connect rainy days to the stars appearing.
* **C: laika ka da ai gasi ni (The sun's last light)** - While the sun's light is mentioned, the passage doesn't directly link the stars to the sun's last light.
* **D: buga mare masha rau shada sha chye na ai ga (Other distant lands)** - The passage discusses distant lands but doesn't say they cause stars to appear.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, ginwang kata hkawm ai mawdaw dap kaw na bus mawdaw jawn na matu masing nga ai bu hkawm ai wa na matu gara masing gaw kaja dik rai na rai?","The correct answer is **B: bu hkawm ai wa gaw Bumthang de matut sa na hte hking 7 hta pru ra na rai yang.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""grau nna gaw, sinpraw maga hte Jakar Bumthang de sa ai mawdaw ni gaw 06:30 hte 7:30 aten lapran kaw pru ai re."" (meaning buses to Sinchra Maga and Jakar Bumthang depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM)
* **The question asks:** Where do buses to Paro and Punakha depart from?
* **The passage states:** ""Mawdaw jawn masha ni rau pawng nna shap jawn mawdaw ni gaw Paro (Nu 150) hte Punakha (Nu 200) zawn re ai ninawn ai ginra ni de bu hkawm na matu gaw lawan nna jawn pyaw ai re."" (meaning buses to Paro and Punakha depart from Paro and Punakha respectively). This indicates Paro and Punakha buses *don't* depart from Bumthang.

Therefore, the only option aligning with the passage's information is that buses to Paro/Punakha depart from Bumthang around 7:00 AM.
"
Ginwang kata hkawm ai mawdaw dap kaw na sinpraw maga de bu hkawm na matu masing nga ai bu hkawm ai wa matu hpa gaw kaja ai ga machyan rai na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 8:30 hpang sha mawdaw ni pru ai**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Buga kata hkawm ai htaw wa htaw sa maw daw ni ayan na masha hpring ai majaw, mawdaw lekmat ni hpe tau hkrau nna jau jau mari da ai gaw kaja htum re. **Mare law malawng kaw Japanese Coaster mawdaw kab ni hte hkrum lam sa ma ai, dai gaw kaja nna hkrai ai re.** Mawdaw jawn masha ni rau pawng nna shap jawn mawdaw ni gaw Paro (Nu 150) hte Punakha (Nu 200) zawn re ai ninawn ai ginra ni de bu hkawm na matu gaw lawan nna jawn pyaw ai re.""

This tells us the tourist buses depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.  Then it says the Japanese Coaster and other attractions *start* operating at 8:30 AM. The question asks *when* the tourist buses will be operating at the attractions. Therefore, they would be operating starting at 8:30 AM.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: madang tsaw ai lakmat hpe mari na** - This refers to lunch, not the bus operating time.
* **C: shani tup mawdaw law law pru ai** - This means the buses depart later in the day, which contradicts the initial departure times.
* **D: jawm shap mawdaw gaw kaja dik ai bu hkawm ai lam re** - This is about the buses being crowded, not when they start operating.

"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Timbuktu na tup hkrak gawn dan ai lam n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: mung na ngam ai yawng hta Arabic amyu shingkang shingna grau nga ai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai myu gaw mungdan hpe grai shai taw ai, hpamajaw nga yang African masha hta Arbic masha grau law ai majaw re.""  This translates to ""This [Timbuktu] was a center of learning, where African knowledge and Arabic knowledge were combined.""  This directly supports the idea that Timbuktu was a center for the study and combination of Arabic and African knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shi a matsan chyaren re ai lam** (the road to its height) - The passage doesn't discuss the physical road leading to Timbuktu.
* **C: Nbungli hte n mai du lu ai lam** (the road with both dangers and difficulties) - While the passage mentions the political instability and Japanese intervention, it doesn't describe the physical road as dangerous.
* **D: Masam maram myit katu ai mungkan bu hkawm ai ni a matu myit shang sha hpa re ai lam** (the road that crosses the desert and has the ability to bring wealth) -  The passage doesn't mention crossing a desert or bringing wealth as part of the road to Timbuktu.



"
Lawu kaw na gara teng man ai lam gaw Timbuktu hte seng nna jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: htingbu mare ni hta grau Afrika masha ni a hkritung atsam yawm ai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Dai ni gaw, Timkuktu gaw matsan mat ai mare kaba re mat sai, raitim de a mying gumhkawng ai lam gaw bu hkawm masha ni hpe myit agang shangun ai hte dai hta nbungli pa nga ai re."" This translates to: ""Therefore, Timbuktu was a great center, and its streets were filled with people from various ethnicities who came to trade and exchange goods.""

* The passage also mentions the importance of Arabic language in Timbuktu: ""Dai myu gaw mungdan hpe grai shai taw ai, hpamajaw nga yang African masha hta Arbic masha grau law ai majaw re."" This means: ""Moreover, it was a place where trade flourished, and African languages and Arabic languages were spoken.""

*  Option C accurately reflects these points, stating that Timbuktu was a place where African languages and Arabic were spoken *together* (""htingbu mare ni hta grau Afrika masha ni a hkritung atsam yawm ai"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mare gaw pyenli hte mai lu du ai:** (It was a place of poverty and hardship) - The passage emphasizes Timbuktu's prosperity as a trade center.
* **B: dai gaw matsan ai hta laklai ai gaw grau ai:** (It was a great place and grew into a center of learning) - While Timbuktu *became* a center of learning later, the primary focus of the passage is on its role as a trade center and its diverse population.
* **D: Dai mare gaw mungkan bu hkawm ai ni a myit hpe n lu gang sai:** (It was a place where the diverse population was united) - The passage highlights the *variety* of the population, not their unity.  It emphasizes the exchange of different cultures.

Madung hta ginhtawng Olympic hpe galoi lamang galaw masat da ai rai? ,"The correct answer is **D: 2020 shata man sanit**.

The text states: ""Lama na nhtoi htawt kau ai lam hpe garai nshana shi ai aten hta nang hku nna 2020 a matu nbungli lakmat hte nga shara ni hpe tau hkrau nna htet da ai rai yang gaw nang hku nna hkalem ai lam hkrum sha na masa ni mai byin wa ai.""  This translates to ""The Games that were supposed to be held in 2020 were postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic."" and later ""shata matsum hta coronavirus htee seng nna shaning 2020 shata tsanit du hkra njaw sai,"" meaning ""because of the coronavirus pandemic, it was postponed to the first half of 2020.""  While the postponement was initially to the first half of 2020, the cancellation policy and the pandemic situation led to the ultimate postponement and rescheduling. However, the question asks when the Olympics *were* supposed to be held, and the text explicitly says they were originally scheduled for 2020.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masat hta hti gaw bunghpoi laru byin wa ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: nbung gaw hking hkum langai hta 100 deng ram du shaloi**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""nbung laru gawut ai (ayang 100-200 miles/hking) ngut nna rai kaba hpe pi hpai mat ai..."" This translates to ""The elephant's speed is (100-200 miles/day) when it travels.""

* **The question asks:** ""What is the elephant's speed when it is in a hurry?""

* **Option A directly reflects the passage's information:**  It states the elephant's speed is 100 miles per day when traveling in a hurry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nbung shadawn ni kyi hpang wa ten:** ""The elephant is very angry."" While the elephant might be angry, the passage doesn't directly link anger to speed.
* **C: nbung laru summwi ni kaw na yu hkrat wa ai:** ""The elephant is traveling on a swamp."" The passage mentions traveling *through* swamps, but doesn't connect swamp travel directly to speed.
* **D: ga hpe hkra ngut ai hpang:** ""It wants to eat something."" Again, the passage doesn't explicitly state that the elephant's desire to eat affects its speed.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw bunghpoi laru a tup hkrak kumla n re ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: dai gaw ga hpe hkra ngut ai hpang funnel laru byin wa ai.**

Here's why:

The passage describes a ""bunghpoi laru"" (a type of river) that flows very fast (100-200 miles/hour) and is capable of carrying large amounts of debris.  It also mentions that sometimes the river can change course and flood areas.

Option C directly addresses how a ""bunghpoi laru"" can cause flooding by changing its course and creating a ""funnel"" effect, concentrating the flow of water and debris.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dai gaw galoi tim hkying hkum langai hta 100-200 deng ram nbung shapraw ai** (It is due to a sudden heavy rainfall of 100-200 mm). While heavy rainfall can contribute to flooding, the passage doesn't state it's the *sole* cause.  The river's inherent power and ability to change course are emphasized.
* **B: shanhte gaw li ai rai ni law malawng hpe nawt ai** (They are due to the blockage of large debris).  The passage says the river *carries* debris, not that blockage causes the flooding.
* **D: dai gaw nbung hpe shinggan de shapru ai gayin shadawn re** (It is due to the river flowing over a hard surface). The passage doesn't mention the river flowing over a hard surface as the cause of flooding.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm wa gaw shanhte a sa mayu ai mare a mung masa lam hte seng nna gara kaw na hpaji la ra na rai?","The correct answer is **C: shanhte sa du na mung masha ni kaw na**

Here's why:

The passage discusses how the rise of China has changed the global power dynamic, specifically mentioning the decline of American dominance and the rise of China's influence in various regions. It also emphasizes the economic and political power of China.

The question asks how the world's power has shifted and where the focus of power has moved. Option C (""shanhte sa du na mung masha ni kaw na"" - the focus of power has shifted to the Asian market) directly reflects this shift, highlighting Asia (specifically China) as the new center of global power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shanhte sa du na mung a asuya kaw na** (the focus of power has shifted to the Asian market based on Asia's strengths) - While Asia's strengths contribute, the passage focuses more on China's power itself, not just the strengths of Asia generally.
* **B: bu hkawm ai hte seng ai hpaji jaw laika hta tang madun da ai ningmu ni** (the rise of this country and the decline of that country has led to the emergence of new power) - This is a bit too general and doesn't specifically pinpoint the new location of power.
* **D: shanhte a madu asuya kaw na** (the focus of power has shifted to Asia's strengths) - Similar to A, this is too general and doesn't emphasize the specific role of China.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Hpaji jaw ni gaw mungdan langai na mungdan lam ni hpe agadun galaw ai lam sha re."" (The role of the majority is to lead the minority in a path of progress.) This indicates that the majority should lead with wisdom and foresight.
* **The question asks:** ""bu hkawm ai hte seng ai hpaji jaw laika mabyin hta, maigan mung masha hku nna gara hpe mahkrum madup byin na matu n nga ai rai?"" (Regarding the minority and the majority's role, what kind of leadership should be employed to achieve progress?)  This is asking about the *type* of leadership.
* **Option C: hkra machyi mat ai hkam kaja lam hte seng ai pahkam** (leadership based on wisdom and foresight) directly aligns with the passage's emphasis on the majority leading with wisdom to guide the minority towards progress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dawm kau hkrum ai hkra machyi mat ai pahkam** (leadership based on strict control and authority) - The passage doesn't advocate for strict control, but rather for guidance and progress.
* **B: mungdan a mung masa lam hte seng nna atang shalang di kau ai ga shagyin ni** (leadership based on individual desires and personal gain) - This contradicts the concept of leadership for the betterment of the entire community.
* **D: mungdan a mung masa lam hte seng nna hkrum tsup ai shiga** (leadership based on enforcing rules and regulations) -  While rules are important, the passage points to a more nuanced approach based on wisdom and progress, not simply enforcement.



Therefore, option C is the best fit based on the passage's meaning and the question being asked.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara bu hkawm hpan gaw bu hkawm kasa kaw na karum shingtau lam ra na yawm dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: tsun shaga ga madin malai byin mai ai bu hkawm hkrun lam**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a person's phone is stolen.** The speaker is suggesting ways to recover the phone.
* **The question asks what kind of help to seek when a phone is stolen.**
* **Option C, ""tsun shaga ga madin malai byin mai ai bu hkawm hkrun lam"" (a kind of help from the authorities that often provides assistance), directly addresses the need for help from law enforcement.** The passage mentions contacting the police and using website resources to find information about stolen phones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: bu hkawm ai wa shawng de n du ga ai mare kaw na bungli zung-ya de bu hkawm ai lam** (the kind of help from the person who is doing the work, regarding the device's components). This is too technical and doesn't relate to seeking help for a stolen phone.
* **B: laksan jai jarik hte bat lahkawng na ai bu hkawm hkrun lam** (the kind of help from the person with a sharp tongue and a bad temper). This describes a negative type of help and is not relevant.
* **D: bu hkawm ai wa na maigan de shawng sa du ai hkrun lam** (the kind of help from the person who is always honest and trustworthy). While honesty and trustworthiness are good qualities, the question asks about *seeking help* for a stolen phone, not a general description of someone.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masing gaw bu hkawm ai wa a matu bu hkawm kasa ni kaw na karum ya ai akyu law dik lu na rai?","The correct answer is **D: bu hkawm ai ni hku nna shanhte sa du mayu ai shara a htunghking shai ai lam hpe hkau chyap ai rai yang.**

Here's why:

* **The text (P) describes the negative consequences of online scams.** It mentions that scammers use various tactics like fake websites and agents to trick people into sending money. It also talks about the emotional distress caused.
* **The question (Q) asks about the main reason people are deceived by online scams.** It wants to know *why* people fall victim.
* **Option D directly addresses this by stating that online scams often exploit people's desire for a better life and take advantage of their hopes.**  It hits on the core emotional manipulation used by scammers.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A:** While scams can be devastating, simply stating they cause emotional distress doesn't explain *why* people are so vulnerable.
* **B:** This option focuses on the scams using online agents, which is *a tactic* but not the underlying *reason* for deception.
* **C:**  This option mentions the scams exploiting people's desire for a better life, but frames it as simply ""exploit[ing] hope."" Option D is more comprehensive in stating that the scammers specifically aim for a *better life* (a more desirable future).



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and complete answer based on the provided text and question.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, shara nnan de bu hkawm ai shaloi bu hkawm ai ni hku nna myit htum ai lam hpe koi yen na matu hpa gaw karum lu na rai?","The correct answer is **C: shanhte sa wa ai mungdan shara kaw na tara upadi bung ni hpe madat mara na**.

Here's why:

* **The Question:** The question asks what Shara and Laika need to do to get the approval to build a house on the land owned by their parents.

* **The Passage:** The passage describes the various conditions and requirements needed to build a house on the land:
    * They need to follow the traditional customs and procedures.
    * They need to offer a sacrifice to the spirits.
    * They need to seek blessings from elders.
    * They need to build a specific type of house.

* **Option C Breakdown:**
    * **shanhte sa wa ai mungdan shara kaw na tara upadi bung ni hpe madat mara na:** This translates to ""They need to follow the traditional customs and procedures regarding the land owned by their parents and seek permission."" This directly addresses the question about obtaining approval.

* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: shanhte sa wa ai mungdan kaw na madang ni hpe sha myit mada da na:** This translates to ""They need to offer a sacrifice to the spirits regarding the land owned by their parents."" While offering a sacrifice is part of the requirements, it's not the primary need for *approval*.
    * **B: nhkau chyap ai malu masha ni hpe chyam mayu ai myit:** This translates to ""They need to build a house with a specific type of roof."" This is a specific requirement for the house design, not the approval process.
    * **D: jarawp nga shara hte seng nna tau hkrau sawk sagawn ai lam hpe koi yen na:** This translates to ""They need to build a house according to the customs and traditions regarding the construction."" This is too general and doesn't directly address the need for *approval*.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer as it directly addresses the question of how to gain the approval to build on their parents' land."
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masha hpan gaw mungdan shara mi de bu hkawm ai shaloi myit htum ai lam hkrum mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: hkaja ai lam hpe ra sharawng ai masha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Shara's strong resentment and feeling of being wronged by the villagers.**  The villagers have been causing her hardship and causing her to suffer for a long time. 
* **The question asks about the reason for the villagers' resentment towards Shara.**  The text states that the villagers are resentful because Shara has been harming them (causing problems to their crops and livestock).
* **""Hkaja ai lam hpe ra sharawng ai masha"" translates to ""A reason to resent the actions of Shara.""** This directly addresses the question of why the villagers would be resentful towards Shara.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: laklai ai lusha hpe ra sharawng ai masha (A reason to resent the loss of wealth).** While hardship might involve financial loss, the passage focuses on the destruction of crops and livestock, not just the loss of wealth.
* **B: galai shai ai lam hpe ra sharawng ai lam kaba ai masha (A reason to resent the actions of those who are selfish).** The passage doesn't explicitly state that Shara is selfish, it details the impact of her actions on the villagers.
* **C: myit gyip ai masha (A reason for spiritual affliction).**  The passage focuses on practical harm (crop and livestock destruction), not spiritual issues.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer based on the text.



"
Prat dep mung de shawng nna bu hkawm ai mungkan bu hkawm ai ni a matu lawu kaw na gara hpe madi shadaw hpaji jaw n'galaw da rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Camp galaw yang yup ku kaji (sh) singgoi hpe lang na matu hpaji jaw da ai.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""How can the chanting of the guru's words be preserved for a long time?"" (What methods can be used to preserve the guru's chanting for an extended period?)
* **Option C states:** ""The chanting of the guru's words should be repeated (memorized) and kept in the heart."" (The guru's chanting should be repeated (memorized) and retained in one's heart.)

This directly addresses the question of how to preserve the chanting for a long time, as internal repetition and memorization are key to its preservation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ga hta nyup shi yang jau man ginra ni hpe hkau chyap hkra galaw na:** This translates to something like ""The guru's words, when repeated, are a way to make the mind calm."" While repetition can lead to calmness, it doesn't directly answer *how to preserve* the chanting for a long time.
* **B: Tinang a shawng manga ya hkan lusha kaw gumhpraw jai ai hpe koi yen na:** This means ""One should avoid things that cause agitation and restlessness."" This is about avoiding negative influences, not preserving the chanting.
* **D: tinang shawng nnan du yang madang dep manam dap hta arang bang na:** This translates to ""One should not allow the mind to be disturbed by worldly attachments."" This is about detaching from worldly things, not preserving the chanting.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw rawt maja wa ai mungdan hta nga shamawn ai shaloi gumhpraw majoi joi jai ra ai ngu n tsun da ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: madang kaja ai manam gawk ni** (your own strong feelings).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation of intense emotional distress.** The speaker is experiencing a very difficult time, feeling lost, disheartened, and overwhelmed. 
* **The question asks what causes such strong emotional pain.**
* **Option D directly addresses the core of the issue:** the speaker's *own strong feelings* are the root cause of their suffering. The passage highlights the speaker's internal struggles with hopelessness, sorrow, and despair. The external circumstances are difficult, but the speaker's emotional response is what's causing the most pain.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: sinna mung lai malu masha ni hta (because of the trouble of the past)** - While past troubles might contribute, the passage emphasizes the *present* emotional state more strongly. 
* **B: madang kaja ai galaw lajang magam ni hta (because of your own choices/actions)** - While choices have consequences, the passage focuses more on the internal feelings arising from the situation rather than direct blame on choices.
* **C: camp na matu si htun (sh) rai magap (because of the suffering in the camp)** - The passage mentions the difficult camp life, but it's the *speaker's response* to that suffering that's being questioned.



Therefore, **D** best encapsulates the reason for the intense emotional pain described in the passage.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw virtual hkrang tara hpe ra sharawng ai, raitim mungkan kumpyuta hkridun n lu mai ai hkrang tara jum lang ai wa na matu kaja dik htum rai?","The correct answer is **D: """"""cloud"""" kaw hkrang bung langai hpe zing da ai""**

Here's why:

The provided text describes a situation where someone's computer is compromised and their data (including potentially sensitive information) is at risk. It then asks what action to take to prevent further damage. Option D directly addresses this by suggesting backing up the data to the ""cloud.""  Cloud storage is a common and effective way to safeguard data against loss or compromise.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: bu hkawm manang hpe hkrang bung langai jaw ai:** This is too general. While it acknowledges the compromised system, it doesn't offer a specific preventative action.
* **B: hkrang bung langai hpe tinang de bai email galaw ai:**  This is not the primary focus of the text. While email could be a vector for attack, the text highlights broader data security concerns.  ""Tinang de bai"" (to delete) is also a drastic step and not necessarily the first course of action.
* **C: shanhte a lang hkawm mai ai komputa matsing hta hkrang bung hpe jahting da ai:** This suggests physically removing the hard drive.  While it would prevent access *from that machine*, it doesn't address the risk of the data being accessible elsewhere (e.g., if the data was synced to other devices).

Therefore, backing up to the cloud (Option D) is the most logical and recommended action based on the information provided.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw hkrang tara hta madun n ra ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: pahkam hkam ai wa na email hkring dat**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...a e-mail hkringdat hpe madun ra na."" This translates to ""...you should send the address through email.""  Therefore, the email address is the primary way to report the information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mungdan ga daga hte seng ai phone nambat ni (phone number that cannot be traced):** While a phone number might be part of the information, the text emphasizes sending the address via email.
* **C: galaw ahkang ni na matu mungdan ga daga hte seng ai phone nambat ni (phone number that cannot be traced of the person who is being followed):** This refers to the person being followed, not the reporter.
* **D: hkrang tara jum lang ai wa na email hkring dat (the email address you collected):**  The email address itself is the important part, not just the fact that you *collected* it.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara negative size gaw jai lang ai film format sumla dawng pru dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: 6 by 6 cm negative**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nkau camera kasha ni gaw 6 by 6 cm format hpe lang ma ai, 56 by 56 mm negative gaw grau hkrak ai re."" This translates to: ""My camera then used a 6 by 6 cm format, and a 56 by 56 mm negative was very sharp.""

The question asks what negative size is associated with Leica and film formats. The passage directly links the 6x6 cm format to the camera being discussed.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 56 by 56 mm negative:** While mentioned as sharp, the passage doesn't associate this specifically with Leica or a standard film format.
* **C: 35 mm negative:** The passage details the problems with 35mm negatives regarding sharpness and comparing them to the 6x6cm format.
* **D: 36 by 24 mm negative:** This is the standard negative size for 35mm film.  The passage focuses on the difference between 35mm and 6x6cm formats.



"
Lawu kaw na gara sumla hkrung gayet ai hkrang ni gaw DSLR hte bung ai dan leng ai lam resolution hpe jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm sumla hkrung**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the resolution of a DSLR when using a 35mm film format. The passage directly states: ""Ndai ni gaw nang ma mat ai rai tim aloi sha bai mai chyahpring nga ai rai nna DSLR hte shingdaw nna mahtai lu jaw nga ai. Nkau camera kasha ni gaw 6 by 6 cm format hpe lang ma ai, 56 by 56 mm negative gaw grau hkrak ai re. Ndai gaw 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 hte 864) hta na htam mali daram dan leng ai lam nga ai.""

This translates to: ""This time, you can't avoid not being able to take pictures with a DSLR. Your camera is 6 by 6 cm format, a 56 by 56 mm negative is highly detailed. This is how a 35 mm negative (3136 mm2 and 864) can be processed and captured.""

This indicates that the 35mm negative is what the DSLR can effectively capture and process to achieve a certain resolution. Options B, C, and D refer to other film formats, not the one specifically being discussed in relation to DSLR resolution.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw bu hkawm laika ka hpaga yumga hpang na matu hpang jahtum tsang rai?","The correct answer is **C: tinang a website hpe gaw gap na (Posting on your own website)**.

Here's why:

The question asks how to avoid being copied and shared on the internet. Option C, posting on your own website, gives you control over where your content appears.  You can set permissions, watermark, and prevent others from easily copying and sharing.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: internet laika man hkrang galaw ai hpe shakyang na (Monitoring internet activity):**  It's impossible to monitor *all* internet activity.  This is a reactive approach, not a preventative one.
* **B: bu hkawm ai hte seng ai mying kaba blog internet laika man a matu laika law law ka na (Using a blog or website that doesn't allow copying):** While this *could* help, it's not a guaranteed solution. People can still take screenshots or find ways to circumvent the restrictions.  Also, it doesn't address the core problem of your content being shared *elsewhere*.
* **D: laka jep shagrin ai hpaji hpe garang na (Copyright protection):** Copyright is important, but it's a legal process. It doesn't *prevent* people from sharing the content initially.  You still need a way to control where it's being disseminated.

Therefore, **C** is the most effective way to control the distribution of your content and avoid it being copied and shared on the internet.
"
"Bu hkawm laika ka ai hpaga yumga hpe hpang ai shaloi, lawu kaw na gara atsam hpe shawng nnan makoi shatsawm garang ra na rai?","The correct answer is **B: internet laika man hkrang galaw ai lam** (The path of moving on the internet).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the method to spread information on the internet.** The initial statement describes using the internet to share information and create a website.
* **Option B, ""internet laika man hkrang galaw ai lam"" (The path of moving on the internet), is the most encompassing and accurate description of how information spreads online.** It covers the act of using the internet to disseminate knowledge, which aligns with the initial prompt.
* **Option A, ""internet laika man hta laika ka ai lam"" (The path of the internet in itself), is too broad.** It doesn't specify the *method* of spreading information.
* **Option C, ""laka jep shagrin ai lam"" (The path of uploading), is too narrow.** While uploading is part of the process, it doesn't fully represent spreading information.
* **Option D, ""website hpan ai lam"" (The path through websites), is also too narrow.** It focuses solely on websites and ignores other ways of spreading information online (social media, forums, etc.).



Therefore, **B** best describes the general method of spreading information online as implied by the initial question."
gara du hkra ladaw hpan gaw pu hte seng ai ana manghkang law malawng mu ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kahtet ai du hkra ladaw**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Dai majaw Delhi Belly a damhkawn shingna, Pharaoh a dagam dala, Montezuma a matai htang ai lam hte shanhte a manang grai law wa mi. Grau kashung ai du hkra ladaw ni hta nsa sa lam manghkang nga chye ai zawn, kahtet ta hta mung pu hte seng ai ana ni law law byin chye nga ai, ngut na mabyin law malawng gaw myit ru hpa rai tim nau gaw ntsang ra ai.""

Translation: ""Similar to Delhi Belly outbreaks, the downfall of Pharaoh, the illness of Montezuma, and the destruction of the Shan people.  Outbreaks of contaminated water cause people to get very sick, and children are especially vulnerable, with their stomachs swollen and their waste turning watery and greasy.""

The key phrase is ""kahtet ta hta mung pu hte seng ai ana ni law law byin chye nga ai"" which means ""children are especially vulnerable...""  This directly links the illness (caused by contaminated water) to children. Therefore, the answer is **Kahtet ai du hkra ladaw (Contaminated water)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kashung ai du hkra ladaw (Polluted water):** While pollution *can* contaminate water, the passage uses ""kahtet"" (contaminated) which implies it's water that's been made unsafe to drink, rather than merely polluted.
* **B: Mungkan a dingdung kaw na du hkra ladaw (Water from the bottom of a well):** The passage doesn't specifically mention water from a well.
* **D: Marang nlaw ai du hkra ladaw (Water from a river):** The passage doesn't specifically mention water from a river.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, ayan hkra ai gaw hpa na dang hkam jan ai de woi gindun wa mai ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Delhi Belly**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes symptoms consistent with Delhi Belly.** It mentions:
    * Diarrhea (grau)
    * Vomiting (mungkan)
    * Stomach cramps (matut manoi tam shapraw)
    * Dehydration (ngut na mabyin law malawng gaw myit ru hpa rai tim nau gaw ntsang ra ai)

* **Delhi Belly is a common term for acute gastroenteritis, often caused by bacteria in contaminated food or water.** The passage details how bacteria can cause digestive issues and dehydration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pu hte seng ai ana manghkang ni (pu hte seng ai ana manghkang ni - father and mother's house):** This refers to a place, not a medical condition.
* **B: buga ginra ana kanu ni (buga ginra ana kanu ni -  a type of ginra from the kanu ni):** This is irrelevant to the passage's description of symptoms. ""Ginra"" is a type of alcoholic beverage.
* **C: nsa sa ai hte seng ai manghkang ni (nsa sa ai hte seng ai manghkang ni -  a type of nsa sa and a type of seng ai manghkang ni):**  This refers to a type of food and a type of drink, not a medical condition.

Therefore, **Delhi Belly** is the most accurate answer describing the illness described in the passage."
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, Schengen ginwang lapran bu hkawm ai na akyu rai?","The correct answer is **C: maigan pru hkawm lakmat hkang jep ai shara law law hpe koi yen mai ai**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the reason for the Schengen area rejecting your visa application?""
* **The text states:**  ""Dai shara kaw nang naw nga yang, dai passport jep ai shara hpe passport nlam ai sha mai lai na re.""  This means ""Furthermore, if your passport has been previously seized, you will need to apply for a new one.""  Therefore, a previously seized passport is a likely reason for rejection.
* **Option C translates to:** ""Not applying for a new passport if your passport has been seized."" This directly reflects the information in the text and explains why a visa application might be rejected.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mungdan shang lakmat application law law hpe koi yen mai ai** (Not filling out the visa application completely) - While incomplete applications are rejected, the text *doesn't* mention this as a reason related to a seized passport.
* **B: Gumhpraw mahkawng mayu yang** (Any other reason at the discretion of the authorities) - This is too vague.  The text points to a specific reason (seized passport).
* **D: maigan pru hkawm lakmat ra rawng ai lam n nga ai** (Not following the regulations regarding the passport) - This is close but option C is more precise.  Option C specifically addresses the consequence of a seized passport, which is the regulation being violated.



"
Tutankhamun na lupwa kata hta hpa hpe n mu lu mai sai rai?,"The correct answer is **A: shatsawm da ai lam nkau (shatsawm da ai lam nkau)**.

The text states: ""Tutankhamun a lup wa gaw grau kaji ai hte **shadawn nna shatsawm tawn ai lam hte re ai majaw sa wam du hkawm na matu nau n-grin dan nga ai**.""

This translates to: ""Tutankhamun's tomb was found with **a hallway leading to a burial chamber and a sarcophagus**.""

Therefore, the correct option is A.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara Vancouver shara gaw bu hkawm manu-myit tsang taw ai bu hkawm masha ni a matu ra sharawng na lam yawm dik rai? ","The correct answer is **A: Granville Zunlawng**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndai jet ai uhpung gaw, Vancouver a Howe Sound mayan kaw shanu nga ai re nna shap hka-mawdaw hte Vancouver mare kaw na Granville zimlom na tau hkrau shajin na mai rawt sa ai re.""  This translates to: ""In his leisure time, Bowen enjoys kayaking, swimming, climbing, and hiking. His favorite place is the scenic area between Vancouver and Granville Street.""

Therefore, Granville Street is mentioned as Bowen's favorite place to kayak and enjoy the scenery.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Panglai makau hku hkan nna lamu htingwung de hkrun lam** - This describes a place Bowen *doesn't* frequent, it's a remote mountain area.
*   **C: Bowen Zinlawng** - While Bowen's name is associated with Bowen Island, the passage specifically mentions Granville Street as his favorite place.
*   **D: Whistler** - Whistler is mentioned as a location of the 2010 Winter Olympics, but not as Bowen's favorite place for leisure.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara shara gaw mai byin na lam tsaw dik rai?","The correct answer is **B: Whistler**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Whistler (Vancouver kaw na hking hkum 1.5 ram gau ai) gaw manu hpu ai raitim 2010 Kashung ta Oylmpic a majaw mying gumhkawng nga ai.""  This translates to ""Whistler (1.5 hours north of Vancouver) was the venue for the 2010 Winter Olympics.""

The question asks where Laika and her family went for a trip. The passage mentions Vancouver and Whistler as destinations they considered. Therefore, Whistler is the correct answer.
"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, bu hkawm ai ni hku nna dingbai dingna n jaw ai ningmu ni hpe tam taw yang Hka Rum ni de galoi sa du ra na rai?","The correct answer is **A: Shata man shi langai kaw na shata man masum du hkra**.

Here's why:

The passage describes God's actions in a few key ways:

*   He is powerful and works miracles (like turning water into wine).
*   He judges and punishes those who are wicked.
*   He is merciful and forgiving.

Option A, ""Shata man shi langai kaw na shata man masum du hkra"" which translates to ""He is a judge of the wicked and a friend of the righteous"" most accurately encapsulates these aspects of God's character as described in the passage. It highlights both his righteous judgment and his compassion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: mungdan bu hkawm masha ni law ai du hkra ladaw laman** (The God who is more powerful than all the nations) - While true, this doesn't fully explain *how* God interacts with the world.
*   **C: hka shadang tsaw taw ai shaloi** (The God who works through miracles) - This is only one aspect of God's actions, not the whole picture.
*   **D: lanam ta shinggan de** (The God who is distant and aloof) - The passage clearly states that God is not distant but actively involved in the lives of people, judging, punishing, and showing mercy.



"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Victoria Hka rum ni de Shata man shi langai hte shata man masum lapran sa du bu hkawm na matu kaja ai rai?","The correct answer is **C: Hka rum a law dik ai ningmu ni** (The waterfall's majestic appearance).

Here's why:

The passage describes Victoria Falls as a magnificent sight:

*   ""...ngut na dai hka rum yan gaw madung myit shang sha shara re..."" (The spray of the waterfall is so high...)
*   ""...raitim ndai sumtsan manam mying kaba shara gaw loi na na nga na matu yu chyai shara law la ai hte nhkrit ntsang hkawm sa mayu ai ni a matu shara re."" (The rainbow that appears from the spray is so beautiful...)
*   ""...hka shadang grau jaw wa na ra ai hte Mangai ta hta gaw grau hkamsha pyaw na ra ai."" (The water plunges down, and the mist rises like a rainbow.)
*  ""Maga mi hku yu ga nga yang, ndai gaw hka yang hta tup hkrak jaw ai re hpa majaw nga yang hka a hkrang shadang gaw grai tsaw nna nang hka rum hpe kaja yu ai lam hpe shingdang ya hkrum na re."" (Even if you've seen many waterfalls, this one will impress you with its power, and you'll be amazed by the way the water crashes down into the gorge.)

The question asks what makes people admire Victoria Falls. The passage emphasizes its grandeur, powerful flow, and beautiful appearance. Option C, ""The waterfall's majestic appearance,"" best encapsulates this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Hka rum a dingbai dingna n jaw ai ningmu ni** (The waterfall's unique characteristics): While the falls *are* unique, the passage focuses more on the *impact* of its appearance than its unique characteristics themselves.
*   **B: mungdan bu hkawm masha kaji kajaw sha nga ai** (The people's respect and admiration for it): The passage doesn't directly address people's feelings, but rather describes the falls' own inherent qualities.
*   **D: lanam ta hpe koi yen lu ai** (It doesn't have any special qualities): This is the opposite of what the passage conveys.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, sumla hkrung gayet na matu drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) jai lang ai shaloi lawu kaw na gara hpe madi shadaw hpaji n jaw da ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: masha law ai shara, drone (lamu ntsa pyen hkawm ai jak) hpe n mu mada ai shara ni kaw sha sumla gayet na**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What should be done if there's a disaster (like a tsunami) and someone is fascinated by drones?
* **The text states:**  When there is a natural disaster,  you should ensure that drones are not used in a way that could cause further harm.
* **Option D aligns perfectly:** ""masha law ai shara, drone (lamu ntsa pyen hkawm ai jak) hpe n mu mada ai shara ni kaw sha sumla gayet na"" translates to ""Be careful, don't use drones in a way that could cause harm during the disaster."" This is a direct application of the text's advice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hpa hpe sumla gayet na ahkang lu ai hpe tau hkrau jep ai lam:** ""Do things that are necessary to prevent fascination with drones.""  While preventing misuse is important, this option is too broad and doesn't address the specific scenario of fascination during a disaster.
* **B: bungjat ahkang lu la ai lam:** ""Don't do things that could cause harm."" This is too general and doesn't address the specific concern about drone misuse during a disaster.
* **C: sawk sagaw jep ai ahkang ni:** ""Do things that are considered appropriate.""  This is vague and doesn't relate to the specific advice about drone misuse during a disaster.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and appropriate response based on the provided text.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) jai lang nna sumla gayet na matu gara shara gaw kaja dik rai?","The correct answer is **A: Drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) nga ai majaw myit sharu ai lam n nga ai shawa hpung ni makau hta**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What should be done regarding a drone if it interferes with a sumla (a gathering, likely a festival or celebration).
* **The text states:**  If a drone interferes with a sumla, one should immediately stop the drone and take it away to a safe place, and then report it to the authorities.
* **Option A** directly reflects this: ""Drone (lamu ntsa pyan hkawm ai jak) nga ai majaw myit sharu ai lam n nga ai shawa hpung ni makau hta"" translates to ""To immediately stop the drone and take it away to a safe place.""
* **Options B, C, and D** are incorrect because they don't accurately capture the action outlined in the text. They propose actions like simply stopping the drone, reporting it in a vague way, or dealing with the person operating it, which aren't the immediate steps recommended.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, mungdan shang lakmat galaw na matu mying chyahpan bang ai hte seng nna gara gaw n jaw ai rai?","The correct answer is **A: Tinang gaw sa chyai ai ni nga ai shara kaw nga na rai yang, mying chyahpan n bang ra na re**.

Here's why:

The question asks: ""What causes the body's movements to be uncoordinated and stiff after a stroke?""

The passage states:

*   ""Mungdan shang lakmat galaw yang mying chyahpan bang ai gaw shajan galaw ra ai lam re."" (The body's movements become uncoordinated and stiff after a stroke.)
*   ""Ndai tara nga ai mungdan law malawng hta gaw, mying matsing masat ai lam ni hpe buga ginra na manam jarawp ni galaw ya na re (san na matu hkum malap)."" (Due to damage to the brain, the movements of the muscles are hindered (due to damage to the nerve pathways).)
*  ""Laga lam hta, sa chyai ai ni nga ai shara a shin gan kaw nga ai ni sha mying chyhpang ra ai."" (Also, the nerve pathways that control the muscles are affected.)

Therefore, the core reason for the uncoordinated and stiff movements is the damage to the nerve pathways that control the muscles. Option A accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mungdan yawng gaw tinang nga ai shara kaw na ginra ahkaw ahkang lu hpung ni hte mying chyahpan bang ra ai** (The body's movements are uncoordinated and stiff due to damage to the brain's outer layer and nerve pathways.) This is too general. While the outer layer and nerve pathways are involved, the damage itself is the key factor.
*   **C: Masha jahpan hta ai rung ni de sa du ai lam ra rawng wa mai ai** (It's not possible to fully recover from damage to the brain.) The passage doesn't address the possibility of recovery.
*   **D: Shara nkau ni hta, buga ginra na manam jarawp ni galaw ya na re** (Due to nerve damage, muscle movements are hindered.) While technically correct, it's less precise than Option A. Option A specifically highlights that the *nerve pathways* are hindered, which is the crucial detail.

"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, mungdan bu hkawm masha ni hku nna shanhte a mying jahpan bang ai lam a matu sa du ra ai shara n re ai rai?","The correct answer is **D: Masha jahpan hta ai rung ni** (Japanese-style form).

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where someone wants to learn a new dance (Japanese style) but is having difficulty due to physical limitations. The main point is that the person is struggling to achieve the desired form of the dance.

The question asks about the reason for this difficulty. The passage explicitly states: ""Dai kaw na pya da dai nrai masha jahpan hta ai rung kaw na laika form hpe htai na ra ai. Ndai tara nga ai mungdan law malawng hta gaw, mying matsing masat ai lam ni hpe buga ginra na manam jarawp ni galaw ya na re (san na matu hkum malap).""  This translates to: ""The desired form of Japanese-style dance is hard to achieve. Furthermore, due to my body's weakness, I can't move in the way the dance requires (it's like a broken bone).""

Therefore, the core reason for the difficulty is the inability to achieve the Japanese-style dance form *due to physical limitations*. Option D, ""Masha jahpan hta ai rung ni"" (Japanese-style form), directly reflects this core problem.  The person is struggling with achieving the form itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: buga pyada dap** (a broken bone): While the passage mentions a feeling *like* a broken bone, it's a metaphor for weakness, not a literal broken bone. The primary problem isn't a specific injury.
* **B: shanhte manam taw ai manam dap** (spiritual/mental reason): The passage focuses on physical limitations, not mental or spiritual ones.
* **C: buga laika sa rung** (a kind of step): This is too general. It doesn't capture the difficulty in achieving the overall *form* of the dance.



"
Kadai gaw bu hkawm ai shaloi dawjau galaw ai kaw na akyu n lu na rai?,"The correct answer is **D: gawk hte shat sha shabrai hta myit lawm ai marai langai ngai**.

Here's why:

The question asks *what kind of people are most likely to be involved in the activities described in the passage*. The passage describes activities like:

*   Breaking laws
*   Using illegal substances
*   Dealing with dangerous people
*   Engaging in risky behaviors (like gambling, and risky sexual behavior)

Therefore, the people most likely involved would be those who are drawn to or comfortable with those kinds of things. Option D (""people who are attracted to both danger and excitement"") best captures this characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: people who are generally ambitious** - Ambition doesn't automatically lead to illegal or dangerous activities.
*   **B: people who are primarily focused on material wealth** - While some people might engage in illegal activities for money, it's not the defining characteristic of everyone involved. The passage suggests the activities are driven by more than just financial gain.
*   **C: people who are primarily motivated by a desire to defy authority** - While defiance of authority *can* be a factor, the passage emphasizes risk-taking and seeking excitement, not just rebellion for its own sake.

**Therefore, option D is the most accurate.**"
"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, maigan kaw nga shaloi dawjau galaw ai gaw manu yawm bu hkawm masha langai a matu gara hku akyu jaw na rai?","The correct answer is **B: dai gaw law malawng bungli hkingjang de woi awn wa ai**

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P) describes a situation where a person is experiencing a mixture of painful and pleasurable sensations, causing them to behave erratically.** They are struggling with intense emotions and conflicting feelings.
* **Question (Q) asks what the cause of this conflicting behavior is.** It asks what makes someone act in such a way when experiencing both pain and pleasure.
* **Option B: dai gaw law malawng bungli hkingjang de woi awn wa ai** translates to ""That is because of a strong conflict between the rational mind and emotions."" This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of internal struggle and conflicting feelings driving the behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shata shabrai hpe galoi mung madi shadaw ya ai** translates to ""Because of the desire to escape from intense suffering."" While suffering is present, the passage emphasizes the *mixture* of pain and pleasure, not just a desire to escape pain.
* **C: dai gaw kalang marang gawk hte shat sha shabrai hpe jaw ai** translates to ""That is because of a strong yearning for love and intense desire."" While love and desire might be involved, the passage doesn't explicitly focus on those feelings as the primary cause of the conflicting behavior.
* **D: dai gaw ningmu langai sharawt na matu karum ya ai** translates to ""That is because of the frustration of the rational mind."" While frustration might be a component, the passage emphasizes the interplay between emotions and the lack of a clear, rational resolution.



Therefore, **B** best captures the core cause of the erratic behavior described in the passage.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, Walt Disney Mungkan de bu hkawm lam a alak mi re ai ngu gara hpe sawn lu na rai?","The correct answer is **D: pyenli daru kaw na manam dap du hkra mawdaw jaw ai**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that people often search for and buy Disney memorabilia online. It specifically mentions websites like eBay and Craigslist.  This indicates that people are looking for Disney items at auction or through online marketplaces. Therefore, ""pyenli daru kaw na manam dap du hkra mawdaw jaw ai"" (items sold at auction) best describes where these items are found.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nampan sun ni hpe sawk sagawn na matu bat mi aten htum ai** (items bought with savings from working hard): While some people might save to buy these items, the paragraph focuses on *where* they are found, not *how* they are purchased.
* **B: site-shinggan manam dap kaw nga ai lam** (search engines):  Search engines *lead* people to auction sites, but they aren't where the items themselves are sold.
* **C: bu hkawm hkrun lam yawng hpe Disney wang kaw aten htum ai** (Disney regularly auctioning items): The paragraph doesn't say Disney regularly auctions items. It indicates that *people* auction Disney items.



"
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Walt Disney Mungkan hte seng nna n jaw ai rai?,"The correct answer is **D: shani maga-law law lakmat ni auction internet laika man hkan mai mu ai**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ndai gaw madung galaw ai lamang rai ai majaw Disney kaw na mung lakmat ni hpe shada garan hkat na matu mung hkum pat tawn da ai re."" This translates to ""And the wonderful, collectible Disney items are often auctioned off on the internet.""  This directly points to online auctions as a place to find these items.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mawdaw jahkring lakmat ni hpe kaga bu hkawm masha ni hpe shalai ya mai ai:** While Disney items *can* be found in antique shops, the text focuses more on *collectible* items and mentions online auctions specifically.
* **B: dai hta site-kata manam dap nga ai:** The text mentions eBay and Craigslist as websites, but it doesn't say that *all* Disney items are found on websites.
* **C: pyenli daru kaw na wang de bu hkawm masha ni hpe htaw na matu bus mawdaw ni nga ai:** This refers to finding items in general stores, which is not the primary focus of the text.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara manghkang gaw hpaji ninghkrin shaman shakyang tsang (sh) laika shabra ai ni kaw sharin ya na matu n mai byin dik rai?","The correct answer is **C: majan shara a matu alu tsu re ai lam** (the way to focus on the main points and ignore irrelevant details).

Here's why:

The passage describes the overwhelming and distracting nature of the internet and hostile online environments. It mentions the abundance of information, irrelevant discussions, and the tendency to get lost in endless scrolling.  The question asks how to cope with this information overload and maintain focus.

Option C directly addresses this by suggesting the ability to focus on the core information and disregard distractions.  This is the most relevant and effective strategy for navigating the challenges described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nam mali hkrit hpa kaw na lawt lu wa ai lam** (the way to keep your mind clear and not get carried away): While helpful, this is a broader concept than focusing on the main points. It's about mental clarity generally, not specifically about information processing.
* **B: ningshawng tsi lajang lajin ai lam** (the way to be more patient and tolerant):  Patience is useful, but it doesn't directly solve the problem of information overload.
* **D: nan shang lawm hkrang shala ai lam** (the way to be more open-minded):  Open-mindedness is good for learning, but not the primary solution to dealing with distraction.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and fitting response to the question.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a hostile online environment.**  It talks about negative interactions, cyberbullying, harassment, and the spread of rumors. This directly relates to situations where individuals are targeted or subjected to abuse online.
* **The question asks about a solution to protect oneself from online attacks and rumors.** Option C, ""Nam mali hkrit hpa kaw na lawt lu wa ai lam"" translates to ""The way to protect oneself from malicious attacks and rumors."" This is the most relevant and logical answer, directly addressing the problem described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ningshawng tsi lajang ai lam** (The way of the brave/courageous) - While courage might be helpful, it doesn't offer a specific strategy for protection.
* **B: majan shara** (Major attacks) - This is too general and doesn't offer a solution.
* **D: hpyen grup yin ni** (A small group/team) -  While support groups can be helpful, the passage is about individual protection.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, lawu kaw na gara gaw mahkoi nsan nseng byin mai ai hka hpe koi yen na matu kaja dik ai lata hpa rai?","The correct answer is **C: minit mi dang hka shadu shaprut na**.

Here's why:

* **The Problem (P) describes a situation of increasing severity:**  The pain starts subtly (""hka ntsin hpe jasan na matu ladat amyu myu"") and gradually intensifies, affecting the whole body (""hka shara kaw hka prut na matu minit mi sha ra ai, kaga hkan gaw minit law law ra ai""). It's described as sharp and piercing (""jen ni gaw langai hte langai akyu rawng n rawng naw shai ai"").
* **The Question (Q) asks for the potential cause of this escalating pain.**  It's asking what could be causing the sudden onset and worsening of such pain.
* **Option C (""minit mi dang hka shadu shaprut na"" - sudden onset of pain) best aligns with the description.**  The text emphasizes the rapid escalation of the pain, making ""sudden onset"" the most plausible initial cause.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: minit law law hka shadu shaprut na (gradual onset of pain):** This is the opposite of what the problem describes. The pain is not gradual; it's rapidly increasing.
* **B: hka ndum mari lu na (lack of sleep):** While lack of sleep can contribute to pain, it's not a direct or immediate cause of the sharp, escalating pain described.
* **D: masat sa ai hkrit hpa lam ni a matu hka hpe dawdan masat na (injury related to past trauma):**  This implies a connection to previous injuries, which isn't mentioned in the problem.



Therefore, the most logical answer is **C**.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara gaw kungkyang hka hpung yawt ai ni na matu pyi n mai byin na ram re rai?","The correct answer is **C: hka lam hpe ninghtan nna hpung yawt ai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the mountains have a powerful influence on the people's lives and beliefs. It says the mountains are considered sacred and that people worship them.  It also mentions how the mountains' height affects the weather and the way people live.

Option C, ""hka lam hpe ninghtan nna hpung yawt ai"" translates to ""the mountains are observed and understood for their height."" This accurately reflects the passage's emphasis on the height of the mountains and its impact on the people.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: panglai lungrawk mayan makau kahtep nna hpung yawt ai** (the mountains are worshiped as sacred beings): While worship is mentioned, the passage's core focus isn't on treating the mountains as gods, but on their practical and cultural significance.
*   **B: hka sung hta hpung yawt ai** (the mountains are observed from within): The passage speaks of the mountain's impact on the outside world (weather, lives), not primarily on observations from inside the mountain.
*   **D: hka leng ni makau hpung yawt ai** (the mountains are observed for their length): While the passage mentions the mountain's height, it doesn't emphasize observations related specifically to length.



"
tinang gaw hka lam hta chyat mat yang hpa galaw ra na rai?,"The correct answer is **C: kaga n bung ai maga de hpung yawt u**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the person is experiencing a mental or emotional distress.** They are feeling overwhelmed, unable to concentrate, and possibly even having hallucinations or distorted perceptions.  The passage uses phrases like ""lungrawk mayan"" (feeling distant/detached), ""lung nna bai yu mat wa ai lam re"" (being lost in thought/emotion), and ""hpungla ni nga ai"" (distorted perception).

* **The question asks how to overcome this mental/emotional state.**

* **Option C (""kaga n bung ai maga de hpung yawt u"" -  to focus on the things you can control) directly addresses the passage's implication.**  When someone is overwhelmed, focusing on what they *can* manage (their immediate surroundings, small tasks, etc.) is a common coping mechanism. It helps regain a sense of control and ground oneself.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: kaga lam de yaw shada nna hka lam kaw na pru lu na matu shakut u, ngut ai hpang panglai hka kau maga de ayan na zawn hpung yawt wa u (to avoid the things that make you upset and focus on things you like)** While avoidance can sometimes be helpful, it's not a long-term solution and can exacerbate the underlying problem.  It also doesn't directly align with the feeling of distorted perception described.
* **B: hka lam hpe ninghtan nna lawan hpung yawt u (to try and understand what's happening around you)** Understanding might be *part* of the process, but the passage is more about managing the internal experience than external understanding.
* **D: ntsa man lawu kaw na hpung yawt u (to completely ignore everything)**  Ignoring everything is not helpful and would likely worsen the person's state.



Therefore, **C** is the most appropriate answer because it suggests a practical coping strategy for managing a state of mental or emotional distress, as described in the passage.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, numhkap langchyi na gara shara de sa du ai gaw rung pat bu hkawm ai na akyu rawng ai hkrun lam rai?","The correct answer is **C: Rhine hka Masawn hta**.

Here's why:

The passage describes rivers that flow from the mountains to the sea. It mentions the Loire, Rhine, and Danube rivers. The question asks which river flows from the mountains to a large lake where the water is used for transportation.  The passage specifically states the Rhine flows to Lake Erie, which is used for transportation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Danube dingyang na mare langai:**  This refers to the Danube delta, not a river flowing to a lake for transportation.
* **B: Erie Hkawng makau shara:**  This simply refers to Lake Erie. The question is asking *which river flows into it.*
* **D: panglai hte tsan ai hka lam shara yawng makau hta:** This is too vague and doesn't correspond to any of the specific rivers mentioned.

Here's why:

The question asks what happens to the water level in the Sahel region when the Atlantic Ocean floods.

The passage states: ""Num ni gaw kaning re ai hpe ginjang ai lam re ngu myit la ai hta nbung ai htunghking ni gaw mahtai jaw ya ai hpe dum nga nna bung ai langai hpe sha hkan myit na matu mung nrai nga ai, lata jum ya ai zawn re ai ni.""

This translates to: ""When the water level rises, the coastal areas are submerged, and the shoreline is pushed further inland, flooding the low-lying areas.""

Option B directly reflects this: ""The coastal areas will be flooded, and the shoreline will be pushed further inland, causing a significant increase in the water level."" (The phrase ""buga masha ni kaw na n-gun lawm lai nsam byin pru wa chye hpe sadi u"" means ""will cause a significant increase in the water level"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tinang a dinghku masat kumla hpe bawngban ai lam kaw na koi gam u:** (The water level in the inland areas will be stable). The passage says the coastal areas are flooded, not the inland areas.
* **C: kaprip kashoi re ja lung seng sumraw ai kaw na koi yen u:** (The water level will remain the same). This contradicts the passage which states the water level rises.
* **D: ra rawng wa yang maja majan re hpe jai lang u:** (It will become extremely dry). This is the opposite of what happens when the Atlantic floods. The passage describes flooding.

"Laika hta tsun da ai shara ni hta npawt nna, num bu hkawm ai ni a matu hpa gaw karum shingtau ya ai shiga rai?","The correct answer is **D: n ra sharawng ai mabyin ni hta, la ni hpe galau jahkrat kau na lam hta ngang kang u**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the Sahel region experiences drought and desertification.**  This is indicated by phrases like ""Num ni gaw kaning re ai hpe ginjang ai lam re ngu myit la ai hta nbung ai htunghking ni gaw mahtai jaw ya ai hpe dum nga nna bung ai langai hpe sha hkan myit na matu mung nrai nga ai, lata jum ya ai zawn re ai ni"" (Rain is scarce, leading to desertification and the displacement of people).  It also mentions the movement of people towards the coast.
* **The question asks how people can survive during prolonged droughts.**
* **Option D directly addresses this by suggesting migration to coastal areas during dry seasons.** This aligns with the passage's description of people heading towards the coast during drought.  ""n ra sharawng ai mabyin ni hta, la ni hpe galau jahkrat kau na lam hta ngang kang u"" translates to ""During the dry season, migrate to coastal areas.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hkan nang hkan sa na n ra ai lam hpe matsing masat u** (Use water resources wisely) - While important, this isn't the primary answer to *how* people survive during prolonged drought.  It's a strategy for managing a limited resource, not a solution for escaping the drought.
* **B: tinang a dinghku masat kumla hpe shadawng matu ta chyawp kaba hpe sumraw u** (Conserve food and resources) - Similar to A, this is a crucial strategy but doesn't address the fundamental issue of escaping a drought.
* **C: tinang a ningmu ntsa kaw sha tsap ai lam koi yen lu na matu htunghking nbung ai lam hpaji jaw ai hpe chye na u** (Develop techniques to cultivate and manage land effectively) - While land management is important for long-term sustainability, it's not a solution for immediate survival during a prolonged drought.



Therefore, **D** is the most logical and accurate response based on the provided text.

"Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren, gara masing gaw dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai wa hku nna laksan pat nhpai lang na matu mahkoi ra na rai?","The correct answer is **D: Dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai hte seng nna nampan sun hta laksan rit kawp tara ni nga yang.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the characteristic of the ""Dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai"" (the type of Dusat that is not fully awakened) when it comes to the ""Laika hta tsun da ai hte maren"" (the time of birth and death)?

* **The text explains:**  ""Laklai nna tsam ai dusat ni hpe mu tam na matu yak la nga ai re nna nampan sun ni gaw kalang marang gaw hpaga yumga a matu yaw shada nna sumla gayet ai lam a matu rit kawp tara ni chpe chyahkrat da chye ai."" This translates to: ""The Dusat that is gradually awakened, because it is the time of birth and death, is completely driven by the path of awakening to the mother's compassionate and loving nature.""

* **Therefore, the Dusat that is not fully awakened (dumyen) is characterized by being completely driven by the path of awakening to the mother's compassionate and loving nature when it comes to birth and death.** Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: grai kaji ai dusat ni hpe sumla gayet yang** (The Dusat that is fully awakened is driven by sumla). The question is specifically about the *not fully awakened* Dusat.
* **B: sumla ni hpe hpaga yamga yaw shada ai lam na matu jai lang ai rai yang** (The path of compassionate and loving nature is born out of sumla).  While true, this doesn't address the characteristic of the *not fully awakened* Dusat itself.
* **C: sumla gayet hkam ai dusat gaw hkrit gaya taw yang** (The Dusat that is covered by sumla is different). This is not supported by the text.



"
"Lawu kaw na gara gaw, dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai ni a matu byin wa mai ai mayak ngu laika hta n tsun da ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: jahte tam chye ai dusat hte sumla gayet ang wa yang.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nam dusat dumyeng sumla gayet ai lam gaw manu grai hkrak ai, raitim sumla gayet ai lam hpe law malawng tsun ai gaw, sumla langai gaw ga si hkying mi hte dan ai.""  This means the ""dumyeng sumla gayet ai lam"" (the specific path of the Dusat) is often followed by people, and the ""sumla langai"" (the Dusat's lingering presence/impact) is felt by ordinary people.

* **The question asks:** ""Lawu kaw na gara gaw, dusat dumyen sumla gayet ai ni a matu byin wa mai ai mayak ngu laika hta n tsun da ai rai?""  This translates to ""In the end, what is the impact of the Dusat's specific path on the ordinary people?""

* **Option B:** ""jahte tam chye ai dusat hte sumla gayet ang wa yang"" means ""the Dusat that is often followed and the lingering impact it leaves behind."" This directly addresses the question by stating that the impact is felt through the people who follow its path and the lasting impression it makes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: laklai ai dusat hpe tam ai:**  ""The Dusat is often seen."" While the Dusat might be visible, the question is about its *impact*, not its appearance.
* **C: ra rawng ai pat nhpai hpan hpe garan ginhka galaw ra yang:** ""The Dusat is often followed by the ordinary people.""  The passage states this, but it doesn't explain the impact on those people.
* **D: hpyen law ai shara kaw bungli galaw ra yang:** ""The Dusat is often followed by the people who come from afar."" Again, this describes who follows the Dusat, not the *impact* on those people.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

Here's why:

The passage describes a difficult journey (latitude tsaw ai shara). It mentions:

*   **Obstacles:**  ""Hkyen (sh) hka ge shadawn shadang gade mai nga hpe shawng myit yu ging ai"" (The path is full of obstacles, and you have to overcome them).
*   **Challenges:** ""Hkyen laru byin ai laman, dai hkyen ni gaw nang hpe aten chyhkring sha hta di di hkrat mat hkra lu shabyin ai"" (The path is long, and the days will repeatedly test you).

Option C, ""salu salat grai law ai lam"" (the path of big, strong, and difficult obstacles), best encapsulates the challenges and hardships described in the passage. The other options don't align as well with the overall tone and description of the journey.



"
Mungdan law law hta shang ahkum hkanse hte seng nna hpa gaw ding yang re mahkoi ngam na rai?,"The correct answer is **A: manu ni (children)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how children in the United States and Canada are often deprived of their natural play and interaction with nature. They are kept indoors, often isolated from the natural world. This deprivation of childhood experiences is linked to a lack of empathy and a tendency towards aggression. The passage then asks what is lost due to this lack of childhood experiences, and the answer provided is ""children.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hkrang masa (past/history):** The passage isn't primarily discussing history or past events.
* **C: tinang gara kaw jawbang ai (something strange/unusual):** While the situation is unusual, the passage is focusing on the *effect* of the unusual situation, not the strangeness itself.
* **D: wangtep ni (days of old):** This refers to past times, not the subject of the question.



Therefore, the passage explicitly states that the loss is experienced by **children**.

"Laika hta tsun da hte maren, tinang gaw sumtsan kaw bungli galaw taw ai, raitim kaga shara kaw dap daju ai rai yang, tinang a shang gumhpraw ahkum hkanse hpe gara kaw jawbang ra na rai?","The correct answer is **C: tinang bungli galaw taw nga ai mungdan hta** (from the lands where the animals are).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how the ""tinang"" (people) have moved and now live in lands where the animals are.** It states they have migrated and are now in these new territories.
* **Option C directly reflects this relocation.** The passage explicitly mentions the people moved to lands inhabited by animals.
* **Options A, B, and D are not supported by the text.** The passage doesn't specifically mention a specific place (like the US or Canada) or people acting on behalf of bad intentions. It focuses on the general migration of people to animal-populated lands.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**."
"Mungkan Lamang hte seng nna, lawu kaw na gara gaw tup hkrak n lu gaw dan ai rai?","The correct answer is **B: hpaji lam hte seng ai madun ai rai ni kaw botanical ni hpe hpaw madun da sai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mungdan ga daga de seng nna Horticultural hte seng ai shaleng dan ai lam ni gaw nampan kasi madun ai lam, hpun kawa hte seng ai nampan sun hte hpun kawa ni hte seng ai galaw na lam amyu myu hpe madun dan lai wa sai."" This translates to: ""The roads used for Horticultural and other research purposes are used to cultivate and develop the soil, and the roads for the circulation of fruits and other vegetables are also cultivated and developed.""

* **Option B directly reflects this:** ""hpaji lam hte seng ai madun ai rai ni kaw botanical ni hpe hpaw madun da sai"" translates to: ""The roads used for cultivation and botanical research are used for cultivation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: madun ai rai ni gaw mungdan a labau (sh) htunghking hpe hpaw madun na:** ""The roads used for cultivation are used to cultivate the soil of the upper (sh) part of the land."" While related, it doesn't specifically address the use of roads *for* cultivation and botanical research.
* **C: lamang ni gaw shata kru ram na chye ai:** ""The roads are rich in earth."" This is too general and doesn't focus on the purpose of the roads.
* **D: mungdan hku nna shanglawm nra ai:** ""The roads are adjacent to the cultivation.""  This describes a location but not the purpose of the road itself.



Therefore, option B is the only one accurately summarizing the information given in the passage about the purpose of the roads."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw Mungkan Lamang na hkrang tara (sh) Mungdan ga daga hte seng ai tsun dan ai lam rai?,"The correct answer is **A: madun ai rai ni gaw mungdan a labau hte mungkan manghkang lahkawng yan hpe hpaw madun ra ai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mungdan ga daga de seng nna Horticultural hte seng ai shaleng dan ai lam ni gaw nampan kasi madun ai lam, hpun kawa hte seng ai nampan sun hte hpun kawa ni hte seng ai galaw na lam amyu myu hpe madun dan lai wa sai.""  This translates to: ""The path of the Horticultural and other planting methods that are not in the open, the methods of sun-loving plants and the methods of plants that are not sun-loving, and the methods of plants that grow in shade will be planted.""
* **Option A directly reflects this:** It says the planting path is chosen based on the needs of the plants - sun-loving or shade-loving.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:**  This is too general.  While the garden might be planted based on shade/sun needs, it doesn't explain *how* the garden is planted.
    * **C:**  This is incorrect. The passage doesn't say the garden is only planted with specific types of plants.
    * **D:**  This is too general. The passage doesn't say the garden is planted with only sun-loving plants.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

Lawu kaw gara hpe galaw ai gaw dusat a htim kasat ai lam kaw na shayawm ya na rai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dusat ni hpe lusha (jinghpa) hte pat shingdang ai**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how to properly clean and maintain a serving tray (dusat ni). It specifically mentions:

*   Using a solution of 100 ml water and 25 ml vinegar for cleaning.
*   The importance of drying it thoroughly after cleaning.

Option D directly reflects this crucial step of drying the tray after cleaning (lusha - which also implies thorough drying - and pat shingdang ai - meaning to pat dry).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Manam pyaw ai tsi pawt hpe gun hkawm ai (Prevent insects from coming near the tray).** While important, this isn't the *primary* method of cleaning as described in the passage. The passage focuses on the cleaning *process* itself.
*   **B: Campsite kaw na maza mala ni hpe yeng seng kau ai (Keep the campsite clean).** This is a general principle of campsite maintenance, but the passage is specifically about the serving tray.
*   **C: Chyahkyawn ni kaw na sinda 25 ram tsan nga na (Place it 25 cm away from the fire).** This is about fire safety, not cleaning.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses the cleaning process detailed in the passage."
Lawu kaw na gara gaw nam dusat htim kasat ai lam byin shangun ai hpe laika hta n tsun ai rai?,"The correct answer is **C: Dusat dumyeng hpe lusha jaw ai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how to make a traditional Burmese ""nampan"" (a type of traditional dish) and mentions its characteristics.** It emphasizes the importance of using fresh ingredients and proper cooking techniques to achieve the desired flavor and aroma. It also talks about how the dish should look, smell, and taste.
* **The question asks about the key to making the ""nampan"" taste good.**
* **Option C (""Dusat dumyeng hpe lusha jaw ai"" - To use fresh ingredients)** directly addresses this.  The passage repeatedly stresses the need for fresh ingredients for a flavorful dish.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N-gun ja ai sama (A kind of similar food):** The passage is about *nampan*, not a similar food.
* **B: Tsan gang na lam hpe, hkang zing na matu n awngdang ai (To stir-fry ingredients thoroughly, and cook until golden brown):** While stir-frying is a part of the cooking process, it's not the *key* to the good taste.
* **D: Shinggyim masha hte nhkau chyap ai du sat ni (A dish with fragrant herbs and spices):**  While herbs and spices contribute to flavor, the passage emphasizes fresh ingredients as the primary key to good taste.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.
