"mema chedayata anuwa, nivaeradiva Ekodiyan wadanaya kirima sandaha niwaeredi igiyak lesa saelakillata gaeneemata nohaekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: vaedipura shabdayak labaa gaeneema sandaha, yaturu matha yodana balaya vaedi karanna.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What should you do to avoid a situation where you have to give a speech (nivaeradiva) and feel nervous?
* **The provided text suggests:** To prepare well for the speech, practice speaking in front of a mirror (ath lihilva aethi bawata vaga bala ganna) and try to control your nervousness (aegili amathara balayakin chalanaya nokirimata uthsaha karanna). It also emphasizes seeking guidance from an expert (vaedipura shabdayak labaa gaeneema sandaha, yaturu mata vaedipura balayak yedimata awashya novana bava mathaka thabaa ganna).  This guidance will help you manage your anxiety.
* **Option A directly reflects this advice:**  Seeking guidance from an expert (like a speech coach - ""yodana balaya vaedi karanna"") will help you handle the stressful situation of giving a speech.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While conserving energy is generally good, the text is specifically addressing the nervousness associated with *giving a speech*.
* **C:**  Writing down your speech is preparation, but it doesn't directly address the anxiety itself.  The text emphasizes *practicing* and *seeking expert advice*.
* **D:**  Being proactive is good, but the text focuses on managing anxiety through guidance and preparation, not necessarily through taking immediate action.



Therefore, **A** is the most aligned with the advice provided in the text.

"Ekodiyan wadanaya karana wita, shabdaya vaedi kirimata upakaaree wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: vaedi balaya (healing power)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a practice where chanting or speaking specific words is believed to activate the body's healing power.  The question asks what helps make the words effective in healing.  ""Vaedi balaya"" directly translates to ""healing power"" and is the core concept being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: vaedi wegaya (healing energy):** While related, ""healing power"" is a more encompassing term than just ""healing energy"".
*   **C: adu peedanaya (pain relief):** While healing *can* lead to pain relief, the passage doesn't focus on pain relief as the primary effect of the chanting.
*   **D: adu aegili chalanaya (muscle movement):**  While muscle movement might be a *result* of healing, it's not the key element that makes the chanting effective, according to the passage. The passage focuses on the inherent healing power activated.

rupavahiniye pinthura wala paethi maim kappadu kerenne aeyi?,"The correct answer is **A: upasiraesi sandaha ida labaa deemata (To get a clear view of the content)**.

Here's why:

* The text describes the DVD case as having a design that allows for a clear view of the movie's cover art. The phrase ""upasiraesi pahatha mayimata behevin asana wanne nam"" translates to ""if you place it in front of your eyes, it will be easy to see the image."" This indicates the primary purpose of the design is to facilitate viewing the cover art.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pinthuraya thiraya sampurnayen pireema sandaha (To completely cover the screen with the cover art):** The text doesn't suggest the cover art completely covers the screen; it implies it's designed to be viewed.
* **C: saralawa wenath aakruthi walata pariwarthanaya kirimata ida deema sandaha (To provide a way to transform the simple shape into a figure):**  While the design might have some visual elements, the main focus isn't on transforming the shape itself.
* **D: upasiraesi pahala maimata wada aasanna kirima sandaha (To bring the image closer to the eyes):** The text describes a design that *allows* you to see the image easily when placed in front of your eyes, not necessarily bringing it closer.



Therefore, the answer that best reflects the purpose described in the text is **A**.

mema chedayata anuwa DVD aakruthiyata chit‍rapatayak pariwarthanaya kirime dee muhuna deemata ida aethi gaetaluwa pahatha sandahan gaetaluwalin kumak wiya haekida?,"The correct answer is **B: ardha washayen kapaa daemunu upasiraesi (Partially cut and insert).**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the process of partially cutting out the image on the DVD to create a shape, then inserting it.** It mentions ""meya ovarskaen lesa haedinve"" (it's slightly crooked/off-center), implying a partial alteration rather than a full cover.
* **Option A (sampurna thiraya aawaranaya nokarana rupayak - a shape that doesn't cover the entire screen) is close, but not as precise.** While it's not a full cover, the description points to *cutting and inserting* a portion.
* **Option C (sampurna thiraya aawaranaya karana rupayak - a shape that covers the entire screen) is incorrect** because the passage says it's *not* a full cover.
* **Option D (kapa daemunu paethi maim - cutting and inserting the edges) is too narrow.**  The passage refers to altering the *image* within the DVD's shape, not just the edges.

Therefore, **partially cutting and inserting** is the closest and most accurate interpretation of the DVD creation process described.
"
ehi b‍rithan‍ya hamuda balakotuvak pihita thibune koheda?,"The correct answer is **C: bordantavun**.

The text states: ""General John Cadavelt, sahayak sena kisivak paminenne nam eya avahira karanu pinisa bordantavunhi brithanya hamuda balakotuvata erehiva haeravum praharayak diyath karanu atha."" This translates to: ""General John Cadavelt, having sent a message, took the British army's outposts at Bordentown and attacked them.""
"
athin liyana lada ketumpathe dis wu athsana kaageda?,"The correct answer is **A: John Dunlap**.

The text states: ""godanagili kipayak obben pihiti **John Dunlap ge mudranalayata yavana ladi**."" which translates to ""The broadside was printed at **John Dunlap's printing house**."" Therefore, John Dunlap is the person associated with printing the broadside.
"
"pahatha sandahan sthaana atharin, dunlap brodside ekak awasan warata paeminiye kothaenada?","The correct answer is **B: dunlapge mudranalaya**.

The text states: ""godanagili kipayak obben pihiti John Dunlap ge mudranalayata yavana ladi."" which translates to ""John Dunlap's printing house, after a long discussion, they went to.""  This indicates the broadside was printed at John Dunlap's printing house.
"
kerrnal starkge bhatayin sthanagathakara thibune koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: uthuru kelavare, mayima dige**.

The text states: ""Starkge minisun yatath janapadavaesiyange sthanaye uthuru kelavare mayima dige sthanagatha viya."" which translates to ""Stark's messenger and the people's representative, in the place of authority and prestige."" Therefore, the messenger was stationed in a position of authority and prestige."
"mema chedayata anuwa, starkge minisun owunge vaeta digu kale kawadada?","The correct answer is **D: bhatayin idiripasa sthaanawalata aethulu wana atharathura (The men were ordered to build fortifications at the front)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Girdley ho Stark vaetata adi 100 (meetara 30) k pamana idiriyen ritak thaebu athara nitya bhatayan eya pasu kara yana tek kisidu kenek vedi nothaebiya yuthu bavata niyoga kale ya.""  This translates to: ""Girdley ordered Stark's men to build fortifications at a distance of 100 (30 meters) in front, and each soldier was required to spend a certain amount of time daily on this fortification work.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yatath vijithavadeen siy hamuda shaktimath kireemata illa sitiya dee (The men were not able to build fortifications with great strength):** The passage *does* say they *were* building fortifications, even if the effectiveness is implied to be questionable later.
* **B: nith‍ya bhatayin kanuwa pasu kala pasuwa (After daily work):** The passage says they were required to do this *daily*, not *after* daily work.
* **C: adu badiya atharathura (This is a good result):** The passage implies the fortifications are a desperate measure, not necessarily a good result.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately reflects the information given in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, chinaye wadathma p‍rachandakaaree yugayan walin ekak wuye pahatha sandahan kumana yugayada?","The correct answer is **B: shiyaan yugaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...purathana chinaye vaediyenma le thaevarunu yugayak woo athara, shiyaanhi maha maligaye ihalama asunata yamata satan karamin dahas ganan minissu miya giyaha."" This translates to ""...in the era of ancient China, the gods and deities lived in the palace..."".  This directly refers to the ""Shiyaan Yugaya"" (千年 युग), meaning the ""Thousand Year Era"".

* **The passage also mentions:** ""mema kaala seema atharin vadaat ma prachalita vuye han saha jinn rajawanshaya athara vasara 60 k pura pawathi rajadhani tune vakavanuvayi.""  This indicates the Han and Jinn dynasties were prominent in this time period, but it doesn't define the *era* itself.

* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: jinn rajawanshaya:** While important, the passage doesn't define the entire time period by the Jinn dynasty.
    * **C: han rajawanshaya:**  Similar to the Jinn dynasty, the Han dynasty is mentioned as being *present* but doesn't *define* the era.
    * **D: thun-rajadhaani yugaya:** This refers to the ""Thun-Rajadhani Era"" (Third Capital Era), a specific period within the larger timeframe, not the defining era.



Therefore, the ""Shiyaan Yugaya"" (Thousand Year Era) is the most accurate answer as it's directly linked to the description of the gods and the palace.

"mema chedayata anuwa, hamuda kuhumbu kandayamak sancharaka awadhiyakata aethulu vime sath‍yaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: owun rath‍ree kaalaye koodu sadai** (They did not sleep during the night).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hamuda kuhumbuvo rathri kalaye gaman karana athara, divaa kala kandavuru laemata nathara wethi."" This translates to: ""After the Hamuda family traveled at night, they did not sleep during the day.""

The question asks what is true about the Hamuda family's travel duration.  Option A directly reflects the information provided in the passage regarding their lack of sleep during the daytime after traveling at night.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: owunta adu aahara saepayimak aetha** (They had to eat a special food) - This is mentioned as something they had to do *during* the travel, not necessarily the defining characteristic of the duration.
* **C: owun dina 17 kata pasu wenas karana lada koodu sadai** (They slept during the 17th day) - The passage indicates they *didn't* sleep during the 17th day.
* **D: owun divaa kalayedee gaman karai** (They traveled during the day) - The passage specifically states they traveled *at night*.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sancharaka awadhiyedee hamuda kuhumbu kandayamwala koodu saedeeme purudu niwaerediwa pilibimbu karanne kumana p‍rakaashayada?","The correct answer is **A: owun rath‍i kalayedee koodu sadai (They will sleep in the kandaayam at night.)**

Here's why:

The text states that the hamuda kuhumbu travels for various periods, including at night.  It also mentions that during the initial communication period, the hamuda kuhumbu doesn't need to get much sleep.  Finally, it says the journey is expected to last 17 days.

The question asks where the hamuda kuhumbu will sleep during the communication period. The text directly implies they will sleep in the kandaayam at night.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: owun dina 17k thisse kooduwalata noyaa gaman karai (They won't travel to the kandaayam after 17 days.)** - This is the opposite of what's implied in the text. The journey *is* expected to last 17 days.
* **C: owun dainikawa koodu wenas karai (They will get very little sleep.)** -  The text specifically says they don't *need* much sleep during this initial communication period.
* **D: owun mema awadhiya sandaha ekama koodu bhawitha karai (They will spend the entire period sleeping.)** - The text doesn't say they'll sleep *all* the time. It implies periods of travel and rest.



"
bahira ingi aethi witadeeth pahatha sandahan dae athurin digatama pawathinu aeththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: antharaasarga chackra (endocrine chakra)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the place where the outward (bahira) infections and the cyclical (aavartita) shedding of the body (ridmaya) are located?
* **The passage states:** ""...antharaasarga chackra pawatheema saha jiva vidyatmaka oralosu haraha eva nispadanaya kireema mata ya."" which translates to ""...it is the place where the endocrine chakra and the biological oralosu (a type of biological process) are located.""
* **The passage also mentions:** ""bahira aavartita ingi kerehi hudu prathicharayak pamanak novena aavartita ridmaya lekhanagatha kara aetha.""  This refers to external infections and cyclical shedding.  The question asks where these occur.
* **Therefore, the endocrine chakra (antharaasarga chackra) is the answer because the passage explicitly connects it to the location of these processes.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aavartita ridmayan (cyclical shedding):**  This is a *process*, not a *location*.
* **C: jiva vidyatmaka oralosu (biological oralosu):** This is another *process*, not a *location*.
* **D: nireekshanaya karana lada ridmayan (shedding due to observation):** This is not mentioned in the passage.



"
kisiyam lakshanayaka vichal‍yathavayan penwana pudgalayan wisthara karana wachanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: bahurupee**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** Which term describes individuals who deviate from a specific characteristic and are therefore diverse?
* **The passage states:** ""Thani pudgalayan yam kisi nishchita gathi lakshanayaka vichalyathavayan kihipayak penwana vita ovun bahurupi we.""  This translates to ""Individuals who deviate from any specific characteristic are called diverse.""
* **""Bahurupee"" means diverse or varied.** This perfectly matches the description in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ekarupee (uniform):** The passage describes a situation where people *don't* have a uniform characteristic.
* **B: jivin (livelihood):** While livelihood might be a factor, the core of the question is about diversity based on characteristics.
* **C: jivin visesha (specialized livelihood):** This also focuses on livelihood, not diversity.



"
kisiyam p‍radeshayaka vasaya karana jivin sandaha niwaeredi yeduma pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: jivin visesha (specialized livelihood)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where people in a specific geographical region have a unique, specialized livelihood.**  It states they all engage in the same kind of work, creating a consistent pattern.
* **The question asks about the common thread in the livelihoods of people in a particular region.**
* **""Jivin visesha"" directly translates to ""specialized livelihood"" or ""specialized occupation,""** which perfectly fits the description in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ekarupee (one rupee):** This refers to a currency and isn't related to livelihoods.
* **B: janagahanaya (population):** While related to the people in the region, it doesn't describe *what* they do for a living.
* **D: bahurupee (multi-faceted/diverse):** This is the opposite of what the passage describes.  The passage emphasizes a *single, specialized* livelihood.



"
sobadhahama matha padanamkaragath sanchaaraka kriyaakaarakamakata udaharanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: wanamal jaayaarupakaranaya (Flower arrangement)**.

Here's why:

The original text describes how local actors can attract tourism by showcasing the natural beauty and culture of their region.  It specifically mentions showcasing traditional crafts and skills. A flower arrangement (wanamal jaayaarupakaranaya) is a traditional craft and artistic expression that can be a visually appealing attraction for tourists, representing local culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: diya aellak wetha yaamata kandu naegeema (A fish-shaped pond with a waterfall)** While aesthetically pleasing, this is more about natural beauty than a specifically crafted skill or craft showcasing local expertise.
* **C: widyaa kavuthukaagarayak naerabima (A bookbinding workshop)**  While related to craftsmanship, a bookbinding workshop is less visually accessible and immediately appealing to tourists than a flower arrangement.  The text emphasizes visual attraction.
* **D: krumeen lesa wana dae haraha masun aelleema (A small fishing boat with a net)**  This is a means of livelihood and a way to obtain food, but it doesn't directly showcase a skill or artistic craft in the way the text intends. It's more functional than decorative.



Therefore, **B (wanamal jaayaarupakaranaya)** best exemplifies a traditional craft that local actors can use to attract tourism as described in the original text.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, p‍ravaahana paddhathiye padanama wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: pudgalika motor ratha (pneumatic motor vehicle)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on pneumatic motor vehicles.** It mentions their use in providing services, their role in traffic flow management, and a research project related to their efficiency.
* **The question asks about the system being studied.** The passage explicitly states a research project is analyzing the ""staying in place"" of pneumatic motor vehicles in relation to the traffic flow cycle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: raekiyaa gamanantha (railway transportation):** While mentioned as a comparison, the core focus is on pneumatic motor vehicles.
* **C: sthaawara jaiwa golayak (stationary biological sphere):** This is completely unrelated to the passage's topic.
* **D: minis parinamaya (human outcome):** While the research aims to help with human outcomes (e.g., efficiency), the system being studied is the pneumatic motor vehicle itself.



Therefore, the question asks what system is being studied to analyze its traffic flow impact, and the answer is **pneumatic motor vehicles.**
"
n‍yashtiya wata kakshagatha wana anshu walata kumana aakaaraye aaropanayak thibeda?,"The correct answer is **C: rina aaropanayak (negative charge)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""electronavalata aeththe rina viduli aaropanayaki"" which translates to ""electrons have a negative electrical charge"".
* **The question asks:** ""what kind of charge is present on the shelled particles in the electron shell?"".
* **Therefore, the answer must be negative charge.**



"
n‍yashtiya samanwitha wanne kumana anshu walin da?,"The correct answer is **D: p‍rotona, newtrona, saha elektrona**

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Nyashtiya- newtrona ha protona lesa ansu dekakin samanvitha we. electronavalata aeththe rina viduli aaropanayaki.""  This translates to ""The nucleus is composed of neutrons and protons. Electrons also have a negative electrical charge.""

Therefore, the nucleus (nyashtiya) is made up of protons, neutrons, and electrons (though electrons are not *part* of the nucleus, they are associated with it).  Option D is the only one that includes all three.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ilakkam pahaka dvimaya sankyaankayakata udaharanayak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The question asks for a binary number (a number represented using only 0s and 1s) that represents the given description. Let's break down the description:

*   **""Ada bhaavithaye aethi siyaluma pariganaka paahe padanam wee aeththe dvimaya sankhyaa svarupayen kethanaya kara aethi thorathuru haesiravima matah ya""**:  This roughly translates to ""Everything that can be conceived, that is the form of a binary number, is a number that can be represented by a tree-like structure."" This hints that the binary number is a simple representation.

*   **""Dvimaya sankhyaavakata thibiya haekke agayan dekakin ekak pamanak, enam 0 how 1 wana athara""**: This translates to ""Any binary number has a single digit that is either 0 or 1.""

*   **""mema sankhyaa dvimaya sankhyaanka lesa handunvayi - nathahoth pariganaka wanmaalawa thula bit lesa haedinve""**: This translates to ""This number can be easily reduced to a binary number - therefore, the number of bits is small.""

Considering these points, we're looking for a short binary number. Let's examine the options:

*   **A: 1010** - This is a valid binary number with 4 bits.
*   **B: 12001** - This is not a valid binary number because it contains the digit 2.
*   **C: 10010** - This is a valid binary number with 5 bits.
*   **D: 110101** - This is a valid binary number with 6 bits.

Since the description states that the number of bits is small, the best option is **A: 1010**.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
dvimaya sankyaanka handunwanu labanne pahatha ewayin kumak lesada?,"The correct answer is **A: bits**.

Here's why:

* **Bits** are the fundamental units of information in computing.  A bit represents a binary digit, which can be either a 0 or a 1.  All data in a computer is ultimately represented as a series of bits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Agayan (अगण्य):**  Means ""innumerable"" or ""countless.""  While binary numbers can be very large, the fundamental unit is a bit, not a concept of being uncountable.
* **Prabhashawa (प्रभाषा):** Means ""language"" or ""term."" This is unrelated to the fundamental unit of binary numbers.
* **Porama (पोरमा):**  This word doesn't have a standard meaning related to computing or binary numbers in Sinhala.



The passage clearly states that binary numbers are made up of 0s and 1s and that the computer uses ""bit"" to represent them. Therefore, ""bits"" is the correct answer."

This translates to: ""The child is motivated to write a blog with a spiritual and idealistic message, encouraging the blog writer to write with analysis and critical thinking. However, blogging is helpful in strengthening cooperation in traditional school days. Blogging should be easy to understand, and the child should write with analytical and critical thinking; the child should be able to see their perspective by focusing on the definition of their own stance in the context of online communication.""

The text emphasizes the importance of **grammar and writing skills** (""vyakarana ha livime kusalatha"") for effective blogging.  While other options are related to the *content* of a blog, the text highlights the *skill* of writing well.

Here's why:

The text states that a blogger's ability to write well is enhanced by their **Internet-based active communication**.  It specifically says: ""Blogkaranaya yanu sahayogitavayata anubala dene mevalamak wana athara sampradhaaika pasal dinakata vada hondin igenima pulul kirimata sisun dirimath karayi.

Translation: ""Blogging is a method that can strengthen the ability to contribute to traditional academic discourse.  **To make blogging easier, the blogger needs to be able to actively communicate with Internet-based resources**..."".

Options B, C, and D are related but not the *primary* factor emphasized in the text. While a desire for analysis (B), consideration for the audience (C), and helpfulness (D) are important aspects of blogging, the text directly links strong blogging skills to active online communication.

sisun sandaha aesinkronas sannivedanaye p‍rathilabhayak nowanne pahatha sandahan karunuwalin monavada? ,"The correct answer is **B: dawase onaema welawaka upadeshakayin wetha muhunata muhuna p‍raweshaya (Synchronous access to the teacher at any time)**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text emphasizes the benefit of asynchronous communication in allowing students to seek help and guidance from teachers at any time.**  It specifically mentions being able to ask questions and receive instruction ""even outside of regular class hours.""  This aligns directly with option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: mulashrayak lesa antharjalaya bhawitha kirima (Slight facilitation of the learning environment):** While asynchronous communication *can* facilitate learning, it's not the primary benefit highlighted in the text.  The text emphasizes direct access to the teacher.
* **C: nam‍yashili vaeda karana welawan (Non-traditional learning environments):**  Asynchronous communication *is* part of non-traditional learning environments, but the text focuses on the *specific benefit* of access to a teacher.
* **D: wega palanaya (Speed of results):**  While asynchronous communication can offer speed, the text doesn't primarily focus on speed; it focuses on the availability of the teacher.



Therefore, option B best captures the core advantage of asynchronous communication discussed in the text.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, aesinkronas sannivedanaye pahatha sandahan angawalin sisunta nam‍yashii nowana anga kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: upadeshathmaka drawya (instructional materials)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that asynchronous communication allows for the delivery of instructional materials.** The text states that it enables ""upadeshathmaka toraturuvala vegaya palanaya kireeme haekiyaawa aetikarayi"" - which translates to ""it enables delivering instruction and achieving desired results.""  This directly relates to the provision of instructional materials.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: igeneeme wegaya (interactive communication):** While asynchronous communication *can* have interactive elements, it's not its defining characteristic. Synchronous communication is more strongly associated with interactive elements.
* **B: waeda karana welawan (doing/practical work):** Asynchronous communication *might* be used for assignments involving practical work, but the passage doesn't focus on this aspect.
* **D: antharjala bhawithaya (internet future/potential):** The passage mentions the internet, but the main benefit highlighted is the delivery of instruction. The internet is a *means* to that end, not the core benefit itself.

Therefore, **upadeshathmaka drawya (instructional materials)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
madhya kaaleena maliga samaga sambandha kala haeki deyak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne kumakda?,"The question asks about the historical context of the Maliga (a type of alcoholic drink) in medieval times, specifically its association with warriors and the potential for it to be offered as a sacrifice. It then asks what could have been a ""lesa chedaye sandahan"" (a minor challenge or dispute) related to the Maliga in medieval times.

Let's break down the first part:

*   **Maliga and Warriors:** The text states that during the medieval period, Maliga was consumed by warriors as part of a feast, and it was believed to enhance their bravery.
*   **Sacrifice:** The text also mentions the possibility of Maliga being offered as a sacrifice.

Now, let's analyze the second part: ""lesa chedaye sandahan"" (a minor challenge/dispute) related to Maliga. This points to potential conflicts surrounding the drink. The options are:

*   **A: Dangeyan walawal:** This refers to a type of plant, not directly related to conflict around the drink.
*   **B: Jost:**  This is a type of strong alcoholic drink often associated with celebrations. While it *could* lead to minor disputes, it's not the primary association.
*   **C: Veerathwaya:** This refers to the warrior class.  Disputes could arise *between* warriors regarding Maliga's consumption, quality, or offering as sacrifice. This is a strong possibility.
*   **D: Nayitwaru:**  This term is not commonly understood or recognized in Sinhala historical context related to medieval practices or conflicts.

Considering the connection between Maliga, warriors, and sacrifice described in the text, **C: Veerathwaya (warriors)** is the most logical answer. Minor disputes could certainly have arisen among warriors regarding Maliga, its role in rituals, or access to it.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Veerathwaya**.

maligawe natabun lesa mava daekwiya haeki suwandak ho shabdayak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"Let's break down the question and the provided options to determine the correct answer.

**Understanding the Questions**

*   **Question P:** This question asks about historical accounts of royal feasts (""maligava ashva pora"") during the medieval period. It describes the lavishness of these feasts, including food, drink, and displays of valor. It then poses questions about the historical accuracy of these accounts, specifically whether the described opulence was actually practiced and whether the mentioned sacrifices (like animal sacrifices and offerings) were commonplace.  It essentially asks if the descriptions are exaggerated or reflect reality.

*   **Question Q:** This question is asking about the meaning of the Sinhala phrase ""maligawe natabun lesa mava daekwiya haeki suwandak ho shabdayak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?""  This translates roughly to: ""The sound of a golden bell that is supposed to be heard in the palace, but isn't, is a sign of what?""  It's asking for the meaning or significance of a missing bell sound in a palace setting.

**Analyzing the Options**

*   **A: satan (Satan)** -  While the context could be interpreted dramatically, it doesn't directly align with the meaning of a missing bell sound in a palace.

*   **B: biya (fear)** - A missing bell sound could create an atmosphere of unease or fear within the palace.

*   **C: bhojana sangraha (food provisions)** - This relates to the feasts described in Question P, not to a missing bell sound in a palace.

*   **D: kura (disaster/calamity)** -  A missing bell sound could be a premonition of something bad happening, signaling a disaster or calamity.

**The Correct Answer**

Based on the meaning of Question Q, the most appropriate answer is **D: kura (disaster/calamity)**.  A missing bell sound, especially in a palace, is often seen as an ominous sign, foreshadowing misfortune or disaster.

**Therefore, the correct answer to Question Q is D.**"
karbi makselo maligaya pilibanda niwaeredi wistharayak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: idikarana kaalawakavanuwe rate paewathi samakaamee swabhawaya hethuwen awama balakotu gananak awashya wiya.**

Here's why:

* **The provided text states:** ""...ehi vishaala opa daemuu kavulu saha thuni biththivalata sthira prahaarayakata erehiva digu kalak prathirodhiva siteemata nohaeki vannata atha. 1480 ganan valadi, haesting saamivaraya visin ehi idikireem aarambha karana vita rata saapekshava saamakami woo athara arakshava awashya vuye ibagathe saerisarana kudaa kollakaruvanta erehiva pamani.""

* **Translation of relevant parts:** ""...the large windows and walls are not resistant to the strong impact of the constant rain. Starting the demolition of Hastings's well in 1480, it became necessary to protect the surrounding area from the relatively tame behavior of the rate (water level) and from the damage caused by the water.""

* **Option B directly addresses this:** It explains that the demolition became necessary because of the *rate paewathi samakaamee swabhawaya* (the tame behavior/constant rise) of the water level, which required protection from the *awama balakotu gananak* (the force of the water).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maligaye ghana biththi illa sitiye haesting samivarayaa wisini (The absence of thick walls in the palace and the Hastings well...)** While the walls weren't thick, the text focuses on the *impact of the rain and water level* as the primary reason for the demolition, not just the lack of thick walls.

* **C: maligave idikireem adala kaalawakavanuwa sandaha saaman‍ya deyak noviya (Demolishing the palace is not a common occurrence...)** The text implies it *was* a common occurrence (demolishing things related to the Hastings well) due to the water damage.

* **D: idikarana kaalawakavanuwe rate paewathi samakaamee swabhawaya hethuwen awama balakotu gananak awashya wiya (Demolishing the palace is necessary due to the tame behavior of the water level and the force of the water.)** This is the correct answer.

mema chedaye wisthara kara aethi seemawa thula pahatha sandahan idikirim lakshana walin karbi makselo maligave asaaman‍ya lesa salakanu labanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: praharawalata muhuna diya haeki lesa godanaegunu aththivarama** (A slight sheen/gloss due to the moisture of the walls and the strength of the impact).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the walls as having a slight sheen/gloss (lesa salakanu) because of the moisture from the impact (praharawalata muhuna diya) and the strength of the walls (sthira prahaarayakata erehiva digu kalak prathirodhiva).** This aligns directly with option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: wishala kavulu (large cavities):** The passage doesn't mention large cavities.
* **C: samahara maliga walata wada adu balakotu (hidden cracks in the walls):**  While the walls might have subtle damage, the passage emphasizes the *sheen* caused by moisture and strength, not cracks.
* **D: thuni biththi (fabric lining):** The passage explicitly states the walls are *not* lined with fabric (""thuni biththivalata sthira prahaarayakata erehiva digu kalak prathirodhiva siteemata nohaeki vannata atha"" - not having a fabric lining that resists impacts).

"mema chedayata anuwa, elabena irthuva sandaha sudanam wana duwannekuta wadath p‍rayojanawath wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: shareeraye ihala kotasa sandaha vyaayaam kirimata kridaagaara shalawa bhawitha kirima (Making the body strong and fit through sports and gym activities).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of physical activity in winter.** It mentions needing a strong body to handle the cold and the benefits of sports and gym exercises for maintaining good health during this season.
* **Option D directly reflects this central theme.**  It highlights the strengthening of the body and fitness through exercise, which is presented as a crucial element for winter well-being.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: sisira irthuve dee gama haraha diweema puhunu vima (Drinking warm fluids and eating spicy food in winter):** While these practices might be common, the passage focuses more on *physical activity* as the primary way to stay healthy, not just dietary habits.
* **B: puhunuwa atharathura wegaya wardhanaya kirima kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima (Being careful and avoiding excessive intake of spicy food):**  This is a specific dietary consideration related to spicy food, which isn't the overarching message of the passage.
* **C: miniththu thunaka vaartha kaalaya binda daemeema (Resting for three hours during the day):**  Rest is important, but the passage strongly advocates for *active* engagement (sports and exercise) during winter, not just resting.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, palamu panthiye saethapum bhaga duwannekuta wadathma vaedgath wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: wegayata wada vindadaragaeneeme shakthiya wardhanaya kirima (Increasing the strength of the circulatory system)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the importance of physical activity, especially during the winter months, to improve blood circulation.**  It mentions that the circulatory system is strained during the cold, and regular exercise helps it function properly.
* **The question asks what is beneficial for the circulatory system.**
* **Option B directly addresses strengthening the circulatory system.**

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: sheetha irthuve dee gama haraha diweema puhunu vima (Avoiding cold weather and shivering):** While avoiding extreme cold is important, the passage emphasizes *exercise* to combat the effects of cold, not simply avoiding it.
* **C: miniththu dekak vaartha kirima (Doing it in two minutes):**  The passage doesn't specify a time limit for exercise; it focuses on consistency.
* **D: vindadaragaeneeme shakthiyata wada wegaya wardhanaya kirima (Increasing speed with blood circulation):** The passage emphasizes the overall strength and proper functioning of the circulatory system, not just speed.



"
"malala kridakayeku sandaha, poshana kriyaa piliweth thulin pamanak labaa gatha nohaekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: wishishta karya saadhanaya (specialized tools)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Soukyamath shakti tulanayak pavatvagaenima, phaladayi sajalana purudu aethi karagaenima saha athireka bhavithavange vividha paetikadayan therum gaeneema tulin, malala kridakayanta ovunge karya saadhanaya wadi diyunu karagaenimata saha kridave yedimen thamanta labena truptiya wadi karagaenimata haekiya.""

* **Translation:** ""...to provide them with specialized tools, so that they can achieve strength and power, produce fruitful and vibrant harvests, and achieve various other benefits, and to ensure they get satisfaction from the work and the game.""

The passage explicitly mentions ""karya saadhanaya"" (tools) and emphasizes that these tools are *specialized* (""wishishta"").  It's not just any tool; it's the *right* tool for the job to maximize benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: vaedi diyunu kala karya saadhanaya (basic tools):** While tools are provided, the passage emphasizes they aren't *basic* - they are specialized for optimal results.
* **B: vaedi thrupthiyak (basic satisfaction):** Satisfaction is mentioned, but the passage focuses more on the *tools* enabling the work and results. It's not just about basic satisfaction.
* **D: saaman‍ya subhasadhanaya (ordinary resources):**  The passage specifically highlights the *tools* and their impact, not just general resources.



Therefore, **C (wishishta karya saadhanaya)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, tharuna malala kridakayinta kridaven vaedi thrupthiyak labaa gaeneemata nirdesha nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: soukyamath shakthi thulayak pavatvagaenima (Achieving a balance between comfort and strength)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of balance.** It states that the goal is not just to gain strength, but to achieve a balance between comfort and strength, allowing for sustained activity and the ability to enjoy the sport.
* **The question asks for guidance on how young athletes can achieve satisfaction from their sport.**  Achieving a balance between comfort and strength is directly linked to this satisfaction. If an athlete is constantly pushing themselves beyond their limits (strength) without considering their body's needs (comfort), they are unlikely to find long-term enjoyment.
* **The other options are too specific or incomplete.**
    * **A: nisi poshana piliweth pilipaedeema (Focusing on nutrition):** Nutrition is important, but it's only one aspect of achieving balance.
    * **B: wishishta mattamin saema witama krida kirima (Practicing with specific intensity):**  While intensity is relevant, it needs to be balanced with recovery and comfort.
    * **C: phaladayi lesa sajalanaya kirima (Practicing lightly for results):**  This suggests an overly focused approach on results without consideration for the athlete's well-being.



Therefore, **D** best reflects the holistic approach outlined in the passage for young athletes to achieve satisfaction through their sport.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, maeda dura duwanneku wada mila adhika upakaranayak mila dee gaeneemata hethuwa kumak wiya haekida?","The correct answer is **C: eya owunge karya saadhanayata behewin balapanu aetha (it has strength beyond its intended function)**.

Here's why:

* **The Problem (P):** The passage describes a situation where the Maeda (likely a tool or device) is being used for purposes it wasn't originally designed for.  It emphasizes that for the Maeda to be successful in these new uses, it needs to have inherent strength and capabilities beyond its original intended purpose. It shouldn't just be a repurposed item; it needs to *possess* the qualities needed for the new task.

* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: eya owunge pawudgalika kaemaettaki (it has the materials/components):** While materials are necessary, the passage emphasizes *capability* and inherent strength, not just having parts.
    * **B: ehi oppu kala p‍rathilabha aetha (it has a shared/mutual benefit):**  The passage is focused on the Maeda's *own* strength and suitability for the new task, not a benefit to anyone else.
    * **D: adu milaethi upakarana pilibandawa vaeradi sankalpa aetha (there is a different idea regarding the intended use of the tool):** The question is about *why* an additional tool might be needed *to repurpose* the Maeda. The passage isn't about changing the *idea* of what the Maeda is for, but its ability to *function* in a new way.

**Therefore, the best answer is C because the passage stresses that the Maeda needs inherent strength and capabilities *beyond* its original design to be successfully repurposed.**



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, maedi dura dhaawanayata awashya wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: wishala mudalak (a strong starting point/foundation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage (P) emphasizes the importance of a strong foundation for success.** It states that achieving significant results requires a broad range of tools and a solid, fundamental approach. The analogy of a ""big (wishala) starting point"" aligns perfectly with this idea.
* **The question (Q) asks what is needed for long-distance running.**  Long-distance running requires a solid base of fitness, endurance, and training - a ""wishala mudalak"".
* **The other options are less suitable:**
    * **A: boho upakarana (many tools):**  While tools are helpful, the passage focuses on a fundamental approach, not just a collection of gadgets.
    * **B: sthaapitha malala krida pasubimak (established sports equipment):** This is too specific.  Long-distance running doesn't require specialized equipment, just a strong base.
    * **C: itha adu upakarana (other tools):** Similar to A, this is too general and misses the point of a foundational approach.



Therefore, **wishala mudalak (a strong starting point/foundation)** is the best answer that reflects the core message of the passage and the needs for long-distance running."
n‍yashtika chumbhaka anunadaya soyaagaththe kawuda? ,"The correct answer is **C: bloch saha parsel**.

The text states: ""MRI yana bhautika vidyaatmaka sansiddhiya matha padanam vuvaki. **Philix bloch (stanfod vishwa vidyalaye sevaye niyuthu) saha edward parsel (harvad vishwa vidyalaye)** visin soyagat...""  This indicates that Bloch and Purcell were the ones who discovered Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), which is the basis for MRI.
"
waidya rupakarana anunadaya sandaha palamu petant balapath‍raya labaa dunne kumana warshayeda? ,"The correct answer is **A: 1977**.

The text states: ""Vasara hatarakata pasu petant balapatrayak labunu athara, eya MRI ksetraye nikuth karana lada palamu petant balapatrayai. 1977 dee acharya Daemadiyan ohu visin """"yatath nokalaeki"""" lesa haedinvu palamu """"purna-kaaya"""" MRI skaenaraya nirmanaya kireema sampurna karana ladi.""  This translates to: ""After seven years, he obtained a patent. In 1977, Professor Daemadian completed the construction of a full-body MRI scanner.""



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, an ayage bhautika kriyaawan artha nirupanaya kirima sandaha minisunta daedi awabodhayak thibiya yuththe kumak pilibandawa da?","The correct answer is **D: awabodhaya (understanding)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes understanding others' perspectives and feelings.** It uses the analogy of a motor vehicle to illustrate how understanding someone else's situation (their ""physical actions"" - which metaphorically represent their circumstances) is crucial for effective communication and interaction. 
* **""Awabodhaya"" directly translates to understanding or comprehension.** The passage highlights the need to comprehend others' expectations and feelings to achieve meaningful communication.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: aashawa (hope):**  While hope might be involved, the central theme isn't about hope but about understanding.
* **B: abhip‍raya (opinion):** Opinion is a personal viewpoint. The passage is more about grasping the underlying circumstances that shape a person's viewpoints.
* **C: visvasaya (belief):** Belief refers to something one accepts as true. The passage is about understanding, not necessarily agreeing with, someone's beliefs.



Therefore, **awabodhaya (understanding)** is the most accurate answer because it aligns with the core message of the passage about grasping others' situations and perspectives."
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhip‍raya therum gaeneema minisunta kumak kirimata upakaaree weda?","The correct answer is **C: vinishchyakin thorawa an aya desa baeleema** (meaning ""clearly stating one's intention and direction"").

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of being clear and decisive in communication and action. It uses the analogy of a motorboat needing a clear direction to navigate.  Option C directly reflects this idea of clearly stating one's intention and direction.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: bhautika kriyaawan pitupasa aethi awinishchitha bawa iwath kirima** (meaning ""uncertain action in the presence of the opponent""):  This is the *opposite* of what the passage advocates. It highlights the negative outcome of being uncertain.
* **B: aashawan purokathanaya kirima** (meaning ""making a hopeful statement""): While hopefulness can be positive, the passage focuses on clear intention and action, not just hopeful words.
* **D: an ayage manasa kiyavima** (meaning ""what is in one's mind""):  Simply having thoughts isn't enough. The passage stresses the need to translate those thoughts into clear direction and action.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer aligning with the passage's central theme."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kruthima buddhiya hi p‍radhaana aramuna pilibanda niwaeredi saranshayak wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: karyayan svayankreeyawa kirimata (Performing tasks autonomously)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that a key characteristic of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is its ability to perform tasks autonomously.** The text states: ""AI sambandha paryeshana, buddhiya awashya karana karyayan svayankreeyawa kirimata yanthrayakata haekiyaawa labadima ha sambandha we.""  (Regarding AI, the ability to perform tasks requiring intelligence autonomously is a crucial aspect.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Selasum kirima (Decision making):** While AI *can* make decisions, the passage highlights autonomy *before* decision-making.  Decision-making is a consequence of autonomous task performance.
* **B: Hada handunagaeneema (Data processing):**  Data processing is a component of AI, but not the defining characteristic. Many systems process data without being considered AI.
* **C: Upalekhanagatha kirima (Application):** Application is what AI is *used for*, not a core defining characteristic of the technology itself.



Therefore, **autonomy in task performance** is the most accurate summary of a central aspect of AI according to the provided text.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kruthima buddhiya boho wita sambandha wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kumak samagada?","The correct answer is **B: saelasum kirima saha upalekhanagatha kirima (Ethical conduct and application)**.

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes the importance of ethical considerations and responsible application of Artificial Intelligence (AI). It mentions:

* **""AI sambandha paryeshana, buddhiya awashya karana karyayan svayankreeyawa kirimata yanthrayakata haekiyaawa labadima ha sambandha we.""** (AI-related environments, automatic execution of tasks requiring intelligence, and their relationship.) This implies the need for AI to be used ethically and responsibly.
* **""Paaribhogika dosa vinischayan saha prasnavalata pilituru dime haekiyaawa menma ath akuru handunaagaeneeme haekiyaawa palanaya kireema saha saelasum kireema ema udaharanavalata ayat we.""** (Examples include determining consumer defects and identifying fraud, as well as achieving results and ethical conduct in the handling of data.) This directly highlights the ethical aspect of AI and its application in various fields.

While options A, C, and D mention areas where AI is used, they don't capture the overarching theme of ethical considerations presented in the text. Option B best reflects the text's focus on ethical conduct *and* the application of AI in real-world scenarios.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhisaree chinthana rataawan aethi ayekuge shakthiyak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: gaetaluwakata niwaeredi pilithuru kihipayak handuna gaeneema**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes ""Abhisaari chintana"" as a type of thinking that involves a ""non-discriminating perspective"" (niwaeredi pilithurak).**  This means approaching problems without preconceived notions or biases.  The passage also states this thinking is used for strategic planning, decision-making, and intellectual examination.

* **Option A directly aligns with this description.**  The idea of ""handuna gaeneema"" (applying/utilizing) a non-discriminating perspective (niwaeredi pilithuru kihipayak) is the core of Abhisari chintana.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: gaetalu wisandeema sandaha nawa thaakshana yoda gaeneema (Applying new tactics immediately to problem-solving):**  While important, this isn't the defining characteristic of Abhisari chintana. The passage emphasizes the *type* of thinking first, then the action.

* **C: gaetalu wisandeemata owunta awashya kaalaya gaeneema (Requiring necessary time for problem-solving):** Time is often a factor, but not the *core* principle of this thinking style. It's about *how* you approach the problem, not just *how long* it takes.

* **D: ratawan mathakaye thabaa gaeneema (Engaging the brain in strategic thinking):** This is too general.  All strategic thinking engages the brain.  Abhisari chintana is *specific* type of strategic thinking.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because it directly connects to the central concept of non-discriminating perspective and applying it to problem-solving as described in the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, abhisaree manasikathwaye kendraya lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: ek niwaeredi pilithurak pamanak aethi bawa therum gaeneema (a single, unambiguous, and clear definition is obtained)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of clarity and precision in thought.**  It states that the goal is to ""construct a clear and structured thinking process"" that is ""consistent with rational action.""  This aligns directly with the need for a single, unambiguous definition.

* **Option A reflects this emphasis on clarity.**  Finding a single, unambiguous definition is the core of the described mental process.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ohuta awashya kaalaya labaa gaeneema (necessarily obtaining time)**:  While time management might be a factor in *applying* this thought process, it's not the central aim of *defining* the process itself.
* **C: karunu handuna gaeneema (obtaining consistent action)**: Consistency in action is a *result* of rational thought, not the goal of defining the thought process.
* **D: thorathuru raes kirima (performing a Thoraturu race)**: This is a metaphor used in the passage to illustrate a complex thought process. It's not a solution to the question about obtaining a single definition.



Therefore, option A directly addresses the need for a clear and unambiguous definition, which is the focal point of the passage's description of the desired thought process.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, k‍shudra p‍rakaashanayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: kathaa karana atharathura iwatha baeleema (Talking and misleading)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph describes a situation where a president's speech included small, misleading details and a complex, unclear explanation of economic concepts. It mentions that these confusing explanations were designed to mislead people and hide the harmful effects of a policy.

Option A, ""kathaa karana atharathura iwatha baeleema"" (Talking and misleading), directly reflects this deceptive tactic.  The speech used confusing language and small details (""kshudra prakaashana saha muhunu chalana artha kathanayehi"") to obscure the true negative consequences of the policy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nalale raeli gaeseema (Running a rally)** - While a rally *could* be part of a larger campaign, it's not directly related to the deceptive language and misleading economic explanations described in the paragraph.
* **C: wegayen aesipiya gaeseema (Using a clever strategy)** - The paragraph *doesn't* portray the strategy as clever. It portrays it as deliberately misleading.
* **D: thambs ap ekak labaa deema (Getting a thumbs up)** -  This option is completely unrelated to the context of the paragraph.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer because it encapsulates the core issue: the president's speech used deceptive language to mislead the public.



"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Video patigata kireem bhavithaya milithathpara kihipayakata pawathina kshudra prakaashana saha muhunu chalana artha kathanayehi, vaedagat soya gaeneem valata maga salasa atha."" This translates to: ""Due to the video being sent to the desired party, along with a small publication and animated explanatory narratives, a doctor's explanation was helpful.""

The question asks *why* the small publication (kshudra prakaashana) was sent. The passage directly says it was *because* the video was sent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: niwaeredi artha nirupanaya wisin boruwa handunagatha haeka** (It was sent to clarify the explanation). While clarifying is a *result* of sending the publication, it doesn't explain the *reason* for sending it.
* **C: kathanaya menma muhune iriyawda artha gaenwe** (The narrative conveyed a clear meaning). The passage says the *doctor's explanation* was helpful, not that the narrative itself conveyed a clear meaning.
* **D: eya awankabhawaya thakseru kirimata upakaaree we** (It was useful in reducing anxiety). The passage refers to reducing anxiety related to the patient's condition, but doesn't directly state the publication was useful for that purpose.
"
punarudaye p‍rathiphalayak lesa wadath vaedgath wuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kumakda? ,"The correct answer is **B: daenuma vyaaptha kireema (thorough investigation of the scene)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Saaranayak lesa, punarudaya igenime praveshaya ha daenuma vyaaptha kireemehi saelakiya yuthu venasak sidu kale ya.""

This translates to: ""Essentially, by entering the scene of the rebirth and conducting a thorough investigation of the scene, the culprit was successfully identified.""

Therefore, the thorough investigation of the scene (daenuma vyaaptha kireema) is what led to the culprit's identification.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pudgalika mathakaya (human brain)**: While the brain is involved in investigation, the text doesn't directly link the outcome to the brain itself.
* **C: pela mathakaya (clever brain)**: Similar to A, the text doesn't explicitly state that cleverness was the key factor.
* **D: thorathuru labaa gaeneema (obtaining the precious object)**:  The text focuses on the investigation, not the acquisition of an object.



"
punarudye p‍rathiphalayak lesa adu awadhaanayak labaa dee aeththe pahatha ewayin kumak sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **B: daenuma labaa gaeneema (the Daenuma labaagaenime)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saaranayak lesa, punarudaya igenime praveshaya ha daenuma vyaaptha kireemehi saelakiya yuthu venasak sidu kale ya.""  This translates to: ""Essentially, by entering the cycle of rebirth and thoroughly reading the Daenuma labaagaenime, one can achieve supreme victory.""

The question asks *what* the result of this is. The passage directly states the result is achieving supreme victory *through* reading the Daenuma labaagaenime. Therefore, the answer is the Daenuma labaagaenime itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pudgalika mathakaya (the mind of a sentient being):** While the mind is involved in the process of reading and understanding, the *result* isn't solely the mind.
* **C: pela mathakaya (the brain):** Similar to the mind, the brain facilitates the process but isn't the result of the Daenuma labaagaenime.
* **D: thorathuru beda haereema (the separation of the body and spirit):**  This is a stage in the cycle of rebirth but not the final outcome achieved *by* reading the Daenuma labaagaenime, according to the passage. The passage mentions achieving ""supreme victory.""

Here's why:

* The question asks about the motivation for creating an *antharjaalaya* (online presence) in relation to the audience.
* The provided text explicitly states that the motivation is to establish ""pudgalika sambandhaya"" (audience relationship) and ""akhanda sambandhataava"" (continuous connectivity) with the audience.
* Option B directly reflects this, focusing on managing the relationship with the audience.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: vyaapara jalakaranaya** (commercialization) - While an online presence *can* be commercial, the text primarily focuses on connection and relationship building, not direct sales.
* **C: sanchaara pilibanda paryeshana kirima** (communication related environment creation) - This is too broad. While communication is involved, the text specifically highlights *relationship* management.
* **D: nawa pudgalayin hamuvima** (attracting new audiences) - Attracting new audiences is a *result* of good relationship management, but not the primary motivation according to the text.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate representation of the motivation for creating an *antharjaalaya* according to the given text.

pudgalika sambandhaya sandaha antharjalaya bhawitha kirime abhip‍reranaya pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: margagatha sakachcha puwaruwaka pala kirima** (fostering the fruits of virtuous conduct).

Here's why:

The passage states that antharjaalaya (inner world) can be influenced by ideas like ""igenima"" (self-respect) and ""samaajaayanaya"" (social harmony) which are inspired by Buddhist teachings.  It further mentions that Ayime and MacCord (1998) found that these ideas contribute to the development of ""pudgalika sambandhaya"" (relationship with aggregates) and ""akhanda sambandhataava"" (wholeness/integrity).

Therefore, the inspiration for cultivating pudgalika sambandhaya in the antharjaalaya comes from *fostering the fruits of virtuous conduct* (margagatha sakachcha puwaruwaka pala kirima).  Virtuous conduct leads to positive mental states and relationships within the inner world.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wattoruwak sevima** (serving others): While serving others can be virtuous, it's not the *direct* inspiration for developing pudgalika sambandhaya within the inner world according to the passage.
* **C: sawukyaarak‍shaka nishpadana pilibanda paryeshana kirima** (investigating the fruits of safeguarding the precepts):  Safeguarding precepts is important, but the passage highlights ideas from Buddhist teachings (igenima & samaajaayanaya) as the initial inspirations.
* **D: mudal kalamanakaranaya kirima** (first-time thinking): This is too narrow. Pudgalika sambandhaya isn't just about initial thoughts; it's about developing a sustained relationship with mental aggregates.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Madyakalina yugaye avasan bhagayata vannata batahira yuropaya ovungema shailiyak vaedidiyunu karagaenimata patan gatteya.""  This translates to: ""Towards the end of the Middle Ages, a Gothic style began to take hold in Western Europe.""

Therefore, the Gothic style emerged in the late Middle Ages.
"
boththam bhawithayen aendum thada kirimata hethu sadhakaya wuye kumakda? ,"The correct answer is **C: kurusa yuddha (Crusades)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madyakalina yugaye avasan bhagayata vannata batahira yuropaya ovungema shailiyak vaedidiyunu karagaenimata patan gatteya. ehi pratiphalayak lesa ema kalaye siduvu visalatama sanvardhanayangen ekak vuye kurusa bhatayin aendum tada kirimata boththam bhavithaya aarambha kirimayi.""

This translates to: ""Towards the end of the Middle Ages, a new style of architecture spread throughout Europe. As a result, a kind of desire to undertake a pilgrimage to Jerusalem began to arise with a slight increase in prosperity at that time, namely the Crusades.""

The Crusades were a series of religious wars in the Middle Ages, primarily aimed at reclaiming the Holy Land from Muslim control. They significantly impacted European society, economy, and culture, and contributed to a renewed interest in pilgrimage and, consequently, the construction of grand cathedrals in the Gothic style. Therefore, the Crusades are the catalyst for the beginning of the pilgrimage and the subsequent construction of cathedrals.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gothik yugaya (Gothic era):** The Gothic era is *described* as the architectural style, not the *reason* for the pilgrimage.
*   **B: bisantianu yugaya (Byzantine era):**  The passage mentions the Byzantine era as a previous influence, but doesn't link it to the *cause* of the Crusades.
*   **D: madyakalina yugaya (Middle Ages):** While the Crusades occurred *during* the Middle Ages, the question asks for the *reason* that spurred the pilgrimage and the cathedral construction. The Crusades are the specific event that triggered this.

"mema chedayata anuwa, parisarika gaetalu sandaha shak‍ya digukaaleena visandumak lesa salakanu labanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: kriyaakaareethwaya (Proactive approach)**.

Here's why:

The question asks how to potentially avoid future environmental problems affecting one's life. The paragraph describes how environmental damage leads to various health issues, economic hardship, and ultimately threatens human existence.

Option B, a proactive approach, directly addresses the root cause of these problems.  Taking action *before* problems arise is the key to preventing future issues. This aligns with the paragraph's emphasis on avoiding the negative consequences by changing current behavior.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: p‍ramanaya ikmava yana sukhopabhogee jiwana rata thereem varjanaya kirima (Abandoning a materialistic and comfortable lifestyle):**  While reducing consumption is helpful, it's not the *primary* action to prevent future problems. It's more of a consequence of a proactive approach, not the direct solution.
* **C: gaetalu walata mul wana hethuwa handuna gaeneema (Identifying and eradicating the root cause of pollution):** This is a very ambitious and complex undertaking, typically requiring collective effort from governments and industries.  An individual cannot ""eradicate"" the root cause on their own.
* **D: paarisarika vyaapaaraye sagayeku bawata pathvima (Participating in environmental businesses):** While supporting environmentally friendly businesses is good, it's not a direct way to avoid *all* future environmental problems. It's more focused on mitigating existing damage and promoting sustainable practices.



Therefore, a proactive approach – taking actions to prevent environmental damage before it significantly affects one's life – is the most relevant and correct answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, parisarika gaetalu sandaha roga lakshana p‍rathikaarayak lesa saelakillata ganu nolabanne pahatha sandahan visandumwalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: gaetaluwe mula hethuwa akriya kireema (The root cause of the problem is inaction.)**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What can be done to prevent the recurrence of disease symptoms related to environmental pollution?
* **The text highlights:**  The text emphasizes that environmental pollution leads to various health problems and that inaction (lack of action) is a key factor in worsening the situation. It mentions that we are neglecting the root causes and not taking corrective measures.

Let's break down why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: kriyaakaaree katayuthuwala niratha vima (Stopping the implementation of active solutions):**  The text *doesn't* advocate stopping solutions. It advocates *better* solutions and addressing the root cause.
* **C: p‍ramanaya ikmawana sukhopabhogee jiwana rataa thereem pilibanda adhas p‍rakaasha kirima (Illuminating the relationship between proportional enjoyment of life and happiness):** While the text touches on how human aspirations and consumption patterns affect the environment, this option is too broad and doesn't directly address preventing disease recurrence.
* **D: wadath parisara hithakaamee aakaarayakin jiwath vima (Living a life in a more environmentally friendly manner):**  Living more sustainably is *part* of the solution, but the text argues that simply living ""environmentally friendly"" isn't enough if we don't address the underlying problems of inaction and neglect.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses the core issue raised in the text – the importance of taking action to prevent the recurrence of health problems caused by environmental pollution.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...Spangna anupraaptiya pilibanda yuddhaya, bala tulanaya pramukha gaetaluva kotagat palamu yuddhaya sanituhan kale ya.""  This directly translates to: ""...The Franco-Spanish War, a major war of balance of power, took place in the 17th century.""

The text is discussing the 17th-century balance of power in Europe, and specifically mentions the Franco-Spanish War as a key example of this dynamic. Therefore, France (Spangnaya) is the correct answer.
"
"""awasana """"aagamika yuddhaya"""" lesa samahara wita wisthara kerena yuddhaya kumakda?""","The correct answer is **D: Spangna siwil yuddhaya (Spangna Civil War)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes a shift from large-scale, conventional wars to a focus on ""agami yuddhaya"" (future war) which is essentially civil war.** The text mentions ""Spangna anupraaptiya pilibanda yuddhaya"" (Wars related to the attainment of Spangna), and then says that the emphasis shifted from large wars to the *potential* for civil wars. 
* **""Spangna civil yuddhaya"" directly refers to a civil war.**  The text implies that these ""agami yuddhaya"" are not traditional interstate wars but internal conflicts within nations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: this awurudu yuddhaya (this war):** This is too vague. The text is specifically discussing a *future* type of war, not just any war.
* **B: siyawas yuddhaya (international war):** The text *explicitly* states that the shift is *away* from large international wars.
* **C: spangna uruma yuddhaya (Spangna territorial war):** While related to the ""Spangna"" wars mentioned, this option doesn't capture the essence of the text's description of a shift to internal conflicts.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Devasthaanaye madyama adhikaariya avurudu dahasakata adhika kaalayak puravata romaye pawathi athara mema bala saha mudal sankendranaya ema siksava sapuranneda yanna pilibandava prashna paena naeguni."" This translates to: ""The middle authorities of the Church moved to ancient Rome for a long time, and the question of how to centralize this power and wealth for the implementation of this education remains.""

* **Option C directly reflects this idea** of the Church's power and wealth being concentrated, especially in Rome, to manage education.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: palliya thula dhanaya wen kirima sudusu lesa paewathiye da yana bawa** (The Church's focus on collecting wealth is the reason for this). While the Church did collect wealth, the passage emphasizes *power and wealth centralization* as the key issue related to education.
* **B: aagame p‍radhaana shikshaawa sanshodhanaya wiya yuthuda yana bawa** (The Church's emphasis on primary education led to this).  The passage doesn't state that a focus on primary education caused the centralization of power. Instead, it frames centralization as a *result* of the Church seeking to manage education effectively.
* **D: palliye p‍radhaana shikshaa sapura aethda yana bawa** (The Church's primary education is being implemented). This is too broad and doesn't address the core issue of power and wealth centralization related to education.

* **The question asks:** ""mema chedayata anuwa, warsayils hi dee ghaathanaya karanu laebuwe kawuda?"" (Which is the subject of this passage, who fought in the streets of Paris?)
* **The passage explicitly identifies the Welledapola Kanthaavan group as the participants in the Parisian fighting.**

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: luwis XVI raju:** While Louis XVI was a key figure in the French Revolution, the passage focuses on the Welledapola Kanthaavan group's involvement.
* **C: kalahakaaree pirise samajikayek:**  A ""kalahakaaree pirisa samajikayek"" (social group of opponents) is mentioned as a participant *with* the Welledapola Kanthaavan group, not as the subject of the passage.
* **D: aarak‍shakayek:** (A guard) This is not mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kalahakari pirisa rajuta ha raejinata thama riya maediriye kavulu vivurta karaganna lesa bala kaleya.""  This translates to ""The rebellious group lightly attacked the property of the king and queen.""  Option A, ""owunge karaththa kawulu wiwurtha kirima"" (the destruction of their property), directly reflects this action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: warsayils wethin hadisi pitavimak (a sudden attack within the royal palace):** While there was conflict, the text doesn't explicitly say the attack happened *within* the palace.  It says they attacked the king and queen's property.
* **C: aarak‍shakayaage hisa gasa daemeema naerabima (the seizure of the royal guards):** The text doesn't mention seizing the guards.
* **D: paereesiyata aapasu gamanak (the journey to Paris):** This describes a later action mentioned in the text, but isn't the primary action the question asks about concerning the conflict with the rebellious group.

Here's why:

* **The text describes the historical context of British colonialism in Germany.** It mentions the widespread violation of racial norms and the subsequent efforts to implement policies aimed at achieving racial equality.  The author states that after a period of widespread racial transgression, measures to achieve racial equality were deemed necessary.
* **Option C directly reflects this central theme.** The text emphasizes the movement towards racial equality as a response to the previous era of racial violations.
* **The other options are less accurate:**
    * **A: samana yudha upak‍rama bhawitha kirimata wu germaniye kaemaeththa (The British military effort to establish equality in Germany):** While there was a military component, the text focuses on policy and societal change, not primarily on military action.
    * **B: me ha sambandha nowana naew anathurudayak thathwayaka thaebeema (Establishing a non-racial, unorthodox principle):**  The text doesn't imply the establishment of an entirely ""non-racial"" principle. It emphasizes addressing the existing racial injustices.
    * **D: theeranathmaka saepaym p‍rawesha wiya nohaeki vima (The absence of courageous action entering):** The text implies action *was* taken, even if it was initially limited.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate reflection of the text's core message regarding the British approach to racial issues in Germany.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Samudure ema sampurna kotasatama nave paminima waelaekweemata brithaanyaya jaatyantara muhudu seemaawa bomba thabaana lada athara eya saamanya naevvalata da anaturudaayaka bhava aethi kaleya."" This translates to: ""Subsequently, due to Britain's bombing of neutral waters in the context of the complete naval blockade, it became commonplace and unconventional to use submarines.""

The passage further connects this to German actions: ""Mema upakramayata seemitha prathichaarayak tibunu baevin, ovunge seemaa rahitha sabmaerina yuddhayatada germaniya evaenima woo prathichaarayak apeksa kaleya."" This translates to: ""This program had limited rules, and in the context of their unrestricted submarine warfare, Germany also adhered to a similar rule.""

Therefore, Britain's actions (naval blockade and bombing of neutral waters) *caused* Germany to adopt unrestricted submarine warfare, which was a major factor in the escalation of the war.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya jaath‍yanthara neethiyata patahaeni wiya (It was justified by racial policy):** The passage doesn't say that racial policy justified Britain's actions. It focuses on the naval blockade.
* **C: eya germaniye saepaym p‍ravahaya kadakappal kaleya (It led to the flow of German money):** The passage doesn't mention anything about German money flow.
* **D: apak‍shapathee naewwalata tharjanayak nowana bawa eya sahathika kaleya (It led to the adoption of a ban on neutral shipping):**  While the naval blockade *effectively* banned neutral shipping, the passage focuses on the *bombing* of neutral waters as the trigger for using submarines.

"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, bahu sklerosis roga winishchaya boho durata ida aeththe kaa sandahada?","The correct answer is **C: 43 haewiridi pirimiyek (43 years old)**.

Here's why:

The text states that multiple sclerosis typically appears in young and middle-aged adults, around 30 to 40 years old. The question asks about the typical age of diagnosis.

The passage mentions that the individual in question is experiencing symptoms at age 40 (implied by ""400,000 k sitina athara"").  The passage then states that MS usually manifests in young and middle age. Therefore, 43 is the closest and most plausible age for diagnosis within the typical range. The other options are too young (15, 32, 10) or too old (40, which is already mentioned as when the symptoms are appearing, not necessarily diagnosis)."
"mema chedayata anuwa, nithipatha kriyaakaarakam walata sahabhagee wana ayata vaedi sahayogayak awashya wanne kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: wedanawa gaena rinathmaka awabodhaya (pain-relieving therapeutic understanding)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that consistent mindfulness practice (PA) can help manage pain, suffering, and addictive behaviors.** This implies a need to understand the *nature* of the pain and suffering.
* **The passage also mentions seeking medical help for negative emotional responses, emotional distress, and physical discomfort related to pain.** This suggests a need for therapeutic understanding to address these issues.
* **Therapeutic understanding (wedanawa gaena rinathmaka awabodhaya) is about gaining insight into the root causes of suffering, which is essential for lasting relief.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: thunatiya (sadness)** - While sadness can be related to pain, the passage focuses on broader emotional and physical experiences.
* **C: manasika awapeedanaya (mental anguish/suffering)** -  While related, therapeutic understanding is a more encompassing concept that goes beyond just general suffering.
* **D: biya (addiction)** - Addiction is mentioned as a related issue, but the passage emphasizes the need to understand the pain and suffering *behind* the addiction first.

Therefore, gaining a *pain-relieving therapeutic understanding* is the most appropriate supportive role for the therapeutic actor after the initial mindfulness practice.

* **The passage (P)** states: ""Kreedawa mulika washayen dvandha svarupayen kreeda karanu laebe..."" which translates to ""Athletes can participate in dueling/sparring style games...""

Therefore, the answer is the method of playing the games, which is dueling/sparring.

"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan dae atharin abhyanthara wisha vime p‍rabalathama saadhakaya wanuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: wamanaya saha dahadiya daemeema**

Here's why:

The question asks about the most prominent symptoms of internal poisoning (""abyantara visha vime""). The provided text mentions that symptoms include:

*   **Abnormal bodily functions:** (Abyantara vishavima ekenehima vidyaamana noweemata ida atha) - This suggests general systemic issues.
*   **Similarity to Vamana (emesis) and Virechana (purgation):** (Vamanaya yaama waeni lakshana saamanya evaa wana baevin ikmanin roga vinischayak kala nohaekivanu atha) - This is a key indicator. Vamana and Virechana are detoxification procedures.  If the symptoms resemble these, it points to internal poisoning.
*   **Presence of poison in household or chemical substances:** (Abyantara vishavima hodinma penwana saadhakaya wanne yam aushadha bhajanayak ho visha sahitha gruhastha rasaayanika bhaajanayak vivurtava tibimayi.) - This clarifies the source of the poisoning.

Therefore, the symptoms aligning with Vamana and Virechana strongly suggest that the most prominent symptoms would be related to those detoxification processes.  Wamanaya (emesis) and Dahadiya Daemeema (purgation) are the most likely responses in internal poisoning.



Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: okkaaraya ha una:**  This is too vague and doesn't relate to specific symptoms of poisoning.
*   **C: daedi kaekkuma saha bade wedanawa:** While pain can be a symptom, it's not as specifically linked to internal poisoning as the resemblance to Vamana/Virechana.
*   **D: niyama kala beheth pethi bothalayak:** This refers to a regular medical check-up, not the immediate prominent symptoms of poisoning.

Here's why:

The question asks what is being examined during the winditaya pariksha (wind test). The passage states: ""Oba vinditayage thathwaya wetha lagaa wana vita saha svayankreeya avadanam salakunu wetha lagaa wana vita ohuge/aeyage thathwaya oba daekagata yuthu ya."" This translates to: ""You will examine the property of the wind, including its speed and automatic movement, and you will see its property/characteristics.""

Therefore, option C directly reflects what the passage describes.  The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: adala sthaanaya pareekshaa kara baeleema (Examining the immediate location):** The passage focuses on the wind's properties, not the immediate location.
*   **B: windithayaata sameepa vima (Nearby area to the wind):** The passage talks about examining the wind itself, not the area around it.
*   **D: udaw balaporoththuwen sitinna (Sitting in a peaceful/calm state):** This describes a state of mind, not an examination of the wind.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes avoiding harm.** The first part of the passage clearly states, ""Upakaara kirimata uthsaha kireeme dee obata haaniyak siduvavahot, oba sidu karanuye ema thathwaya thavat ayahapat athata haeravimaki.""  This translates to: ""While trying to be helpful, if you cause harm to yourself, then the thing you did will be destroyed or damaged."" This directly links actions with potential harm.

* **Option A aligns with this principle.** Not causing harm is the fundamental ethical guideline presented in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: windithayaata pera sthaanaya pareekshaa karanna (to examine the windithaya thoroughly):** While examination might be part of the process, the core focus is on avoiding harm, not just thorough examination.

* **C: windithayaage thaththwaya pareekshaa karanna (to examine the nature of the windithaya):** Similar to B, examining the nature isn't the central theme; avoiding harm is.

* **D: onaema anathurudayaka wiya haeki karunu kerehi awadhaanaya yomu karanna (to be careful in all actions that could cause unintended consequences):** This is a broader statement about caution, but option A is more directly tied to the harm avoidance principle emphasized in the passage.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is A because it encapsulates the main ethical point of the passage: prioritizing avoidance of harm.

* **The passage states:** ""Pransha viplavaya wenath ratawala mardanaya karana lada kamkaru panthiye boho denekuta thamangema viplavayan aarambha kirimata da hetu viya.""  (After the French Revolution, many people who fought to overthrow the monarchy were motivated to start revolutions themselves.)
* **The passage also discusses:** The idea that the revolution created a sense of purpose and meaning for ordinary people.  It emphasizes a search for ""sarthakatvayata"" (meaning/purpose).
* **""Abhilashaya"" (desire/aspiration)** directly relates to the driving force behind people seeking a better life and a sense of purpose.  The revolution fueled their desires for change and a more fulfilling existence.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: saadhanaya (tool/instrument):** While revolution *can* be a tool, the passage focuses on *why* people were motivated to use it, not the tool itself.
* **B: panthiya (path/way):** The revolution wasn't necessarily a pre-determined path; it was a catalyst for creating new paths.
* **D: wargaya (class):** While class played a role, the passage emphasizes the individual's *desire* for something more than just their social class dictated.  The revolution allowed people to transcend their class boundaries in their aspirations.



Therefore, **abhilashaya (desire/aspiration)** best captures the motivation behind people seeking meaning and initiating further revolutions after the French Revolution.

"sanwardhitha ratawala, wadathma athrupthiyata hethu wana bawa kiyanu labana mahajana sevawan monavada?","Let's break down the questions and the context to arrive at the correct answer.

**Understanding Question P:**

This question is asking about the logic and reasoning behind hydrological (water flow) studies. It highlights a potential disconnect:

* **The Goal:** To understand the flow pattern of water in a river.
* **The Process:**  Analyzing factors like increased land area, water quality, and the resulting changes in the flow pattern.
* **The Question:** If the goal *is* to understand flow, and the analysis *does* reveal that changes happen, is the entire study pointless?  It then asks how hydrological engineers can approach this and if there's a deeper underlying principle.

The core of the question is about *purpose* and the *value of understanding change*. Even if the flow *changes*, the study provides valuable data for predicting future behavior, mitigating risks (flooding, droughts), and managing water resources.

**Understanding Question Q:**

This question asks what essential public service is *required* to address the dissatisfaction caused by increased land area and other factors affecting water quality. Essentially, what service prevents or mitigates the negative consequences of changes in the water system.

**Analyzing the Options:**

* **A: Jalaye gunathmakabhawaya (Water Quality):**  Improving water quality is *important*, but it's a *result* of good management, not the core essential service to *address dissatisfaction* caused by flow changes. While improved quality is desirable, it doesn't directly address the underlying issues of potential flooding, resource scarcity, or pollution *caused* by altered flow patterns.
* **B: Palam idikirima (Bridge Construction):** Building bridges is a *infrastructure project*. It's helpful, but not a fundamental public service required to address water-related dissatisfaction caused by flow changes. Bridges might be needed to compensate for lost crossing points due to flooding, but construction alone isn't the essential service.
* **C: Podu p‍ravahanaya (Sufficient Flow):**  While sufficient flow *is* desirable, it's not always achievable or the only solution.  It's a *goal* rather than the primary *public service* required to manage the consequences of flow changes.  A study might reveal that sufficient flow isn't possible given the land area increase.
* **D: Adhyaapanaya (Education):**  Education is *important* for public awareness and responsible water use.  However, it's *not* the core service that directly addresses dissatisfaction stemming from altered flow patterns.  While education promotes understanding, it doesn't solve the tangible problems of flooding, resource management, or pollution.

**The Best Answer and Why:**

Given the context, the best answer is **A: Jalaye gunathmakabhawaya (Water Quality)**. While it's a result,  water quality improvements are crucial for preventing or mitigating problems caused by changes in the water system. Addressing pollution due to land area increases and alterations to flow is paramount to satisfying citizens. Improved water quality is the ultimate outcome of effective management and the essential service needed to prevent dissatisfaction related to changes in the flow and land area.

"mema chedayata anuwa, podu p‍ravahana paddhathi pilibandawa kumak kiwa haekida?","The question is asking about the purpose of analyzing flow patterns in a system (like a river or a process) if the analysis doesn't lead to any actionable insights or improvements. It also asks about how to discuss a long flow pattern when the system is damaged.

Let's break down the options:

* **Q: mema chedayata anuwa, podu p‍ravahana paddhathi pilibandawa kumak kiwa haekida? (What can you say about the long flow pattern of the damaged system?)** This is asking for a statement about the *damaged* system's flow pattern.

Now let's analyze the options:

* **A: ewa bhawitha karana saema kenekutama owun hondin aadaraya karai (One should respect the inherent nature of the system).**  This is a philosophical point about respecting the system itself. While important, it doesn't directly address describing the *flow pattern* of a damaged system.
* **B: ewa jalaye gunathmakabhawaya tharam naraka naetha (The inherent qualities of the water are not necessarily bad).** This is a statement about the water's properties.  Again, it's not about the flow *pattern* of a damaged system.
* **C: ewa bhawitha karana pudgalayingen boho paeminili aethi weyi (There are many potential reasons for the damage to the system).** This is a valid point about the *cause* of the damage, but not about describing the *flow pattern* *after* the damage.
* **D: boho sanwardhitha ratawala ewa nomile laebe (The developed country does not have this [damaged system] readily available).** This is a comparative statement about developed countries. It doesn't address the flow pattern or the damaged system.

**Considering the question and the options, the best answer is C.** Option C acknowledges the *reason* for the damaged state, which is a crucial element when discussing the flow pattern of a system that has been disrupted.  You need to understand *why* the flow pattern is abnormal before describing it.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: ewa bhawitha karana pudgalayingen boho paeminili aethi weyi (There are many potential reasons for the damage to the system).**

"mema chedayata anuwa, riyadurange anapek‍shitha bawa nisa maeneemata apahasu wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: marga saelasumkaranaya (route optimization)**.

Here's why:

The text states that understanding and modeling traffic flow (riyadurana pravaahaaya) is crucial for effective traffic management and route planning.  It mentions that key factors affecting traffic flow are:

* **Praaahaaya (flow):**  The volume of vehicles.
* **Ghanatvaya (density):** How closely packed the vehicles are.
* **Pravegaya (velocity/speed):**  The speed of the vehicles.

The question asks what helps to reduce unexpected delays in traffic.  Route optimization (marga saelasumkaranaya) directly addresses this by considering all three of those factors to find the best possible route. A well-optimized route will minimize delays caused by flow, density, and speed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: gamanagamana p‍rawegaya (arrival velocity):** While speed is a factor, simply focusing on arrival velocity doesn't address the problem of unexpected delays.
* **C: marga meheyum (none of the above):**  As explained above, route optimization *is* relevant.
* **D: gamanagamana p‍ravahaya (arrival flow):** This is a less helpful factor than overall traffic flow in determining how to reduce delays.
"
gamanagamana p‍ravahayak ganithamaya washayen nirupanaya kirimedee pahatha sandahan de atharin bhawitha karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: gamanagamana ghanathwaya (Arrival density)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that to analyze arrival flow and plan for better management, key characteristics need to be established. These characteristics are:

1.   pravaahaya (Flow rate)
2.  ghanatvaya (Density)
3.  pravegaya (Velocity)

The question asks what needs to be expressed mathematically to analyze arrival flow. The passage explicitly mentions ""ghanatvaya"" (density) as one of the key characteristics that can be expressed mathematically. Therefore, the arrival density is the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: marga meheyum (This route)**:  While the route is part of the context, it's not the *mathematical representation* of arrival flow.
*   **B: riyaduru haesireema (Remote arrival)**: This refers to the remoteness of the arrival, not a mathematical characteristic.
*   **C: marga saelaesma (Route safety)**: Route safety is important, but not directly related to the mathematical representation of arrival flow.



"
hershe saha ches owunge DNA baddha kirimata bhawitha kale kumakda? ,"The correct answer is **A: wikiranasheelee posparas (virulence factor)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Hershey-Chase experiment showed that the DNA, not the protein, was injected into the bacteria. This DNA then programmed the bacteria to produce viral proteins.  The key point is that the DNA contained the instructions for the bacteria to become pathogenic (disease-causing). These instructions are considered **virulence factors**, meaning factors that contribute to the ability of a pathogen to cause disease.  Virulence factors often include genes that code for proteins that enhance the pathogen's ability to infect, survive, and cause damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: jaanamaya drawya (nucleic substance/genetic material):** While DNA *is* a nucleic substance, the question asks about what *caused* the bacteria to become pathogenic.
*   **C: wikiranasheelee salfar (sulfur):** The experiment ruled out sulfur as the material that entered the bacteria.
*   **D: wairasa (virus):** The experiment was about *how* genetic material enters bacteria to make them pathogenic, not about the virus itself.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **virulence factor**. The passage implies that the DNA's role in prompting the bacteria to produce specific proteins is what makes it harmful. Virulence factors are the key to understanding this process."
wikurthi kirim walata daruwan wetha gena yaamata aethi haekiyaawa randa pawathinne kumak matha da?,"The correct answer is **C: wikurthi kirim wargaya (the category of deformity)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that through practicing deformities (vikurti kirim), one can obtain various benefits and achieve a good life.  It also mentions that practicing deformities can lead to a life of longevity and a higher position.  Finally, it says that certain types of deformities can cause death.

The question asks what could be obtained by practicing deformities. The passage explicitly states ""vividha pratiphala labaa diya diya haekiya"" which translates to ""one can obtain various benefits"".  This refers to the **category of deformity** (wikurthi kirim wargaya) as the source of these benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sailaya wishabeeja walata mul we nam (it is the root of the wish-fulfilling jewel):** While the passage mentions a wish-fulfilling jewel, it doesn't directly link deformities to it being its origin.
* **B: jaanamaya drawyawala vaedgathkama (medical efficacy of the medicinal herb):**  The passage mentions the medicinal efficacy of a herb (""jaanamaya drawya""), but it's not the primary benefit obtained from practicing deformities.
* **D: wikurthiya saila maranayata hethu wiya haeki nam (deformity can cause death):** This describes a *negative* consequence of certain deformities, not the benefits obtained from practicing them.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**."
"mema chedaye dakva aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, wikurthi vimwala wiwidha balapaem randa nopawathinne kumak matha da?","The correct answer is **C: balapaemata lak wu jaanamaya drawyawala vaedgathkama (The medicinal properties of the substance used in the ritual)**.

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q)** asks what benefits the ""vikurti vimwala"" (ritual involving a specific type of impairment/deviation) can provide. It specifically mentions receiving various rewards and achieving a favorable rebirth.
* **The Text (P)** explains that the ritual involves a specific type of impairment, and doing it correctly can lead to various benefits, while doing it incorrectly can have negative consequences. It emphasizes that the benefits come from the *medicinal properties of the substance* used in the ritual.
* **Option C** directly addresses the source of these benefits – the medicinal properties of the substance.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: jaanamaya drawya kopamana p‍ramanayak balapaemata lakwa aethda? (Does the amount of medicinal substance used affect the potency of the ritual?)** While the amount *might* be a factor, the text focuses on the substance's inherent medicinal properties being the *primary* source of benefit.
* **B: balapaemata lak wu saila wishabeeja walata mul we nam (Is the origin of the ""saila wishabeeja"" crucial?)**  The text doesn't mention ""saila wishabeeja"" at all.
* **D: balapaemata lak wu wikurthi wargaya (Is the type of impairment crucial?)**  The text says the *correct* execution of the ritual (involving a specific impairment) is crucial, but the underlying benefit is derived from the medicinal substance.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of what the text implies about the benefits of the ritual."

Here's why:

The passage states that the ancient culture and traditions of the people in the region revolved around dairy (kiri - milk). It mentions they historically traveled 10,000 miles to obtain milk. This strong connection to milk is linked to their cultural and social practices, including marriage customs and the significance of young people.

Option D directly reflects this central theme of the passage. The other options don't align with the information provided."
golf kreedawe gatha yuthu aduma ilakkaya kumak sandaha weda?,"The correct answer is **A: pandu** (ball).

This translates to: ""...in this attack sport, usually the player starts with a small ball and finishes with it. To succeed in this sport, the ball has to be hit from the tee towards the green.""

Therefore, the object used in golf is a **ball (pandu)**. The other options (paharawal, vaara, walawal) are not relevant to the description of the game.
"
"golf pitiyaka, thanakola keti lesa kapa aeththe kothaenada?","The correct answer is **B: green p‍radeshaya thula**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Meya thana matha sidukarana kreedawak wana athara, sidura vata wana thanakola keti vannata kapanu laeba green yanuven haedunvayi.""

This translates to: ""In this game, to succeed, the ball must be hit towards the green area.""

Therefore, the ball is aimed at the green area.
"
athhada baeleeme saaman‍ya aramuna wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: Prashna idiripath kirimata (Asking questions)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that in a structured educational approach, the process of asking questions is crucial.  It states that through questioning and observation, one can gain a deeper understanding of the intellectual framework and receive guidance within the educational environment.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Wibhawya upakalpanayak ho kihipayak baehaera kirima (Making a hypothetical assumption):**  While assumptions can be part of learning, the text focuses on a more direct method of understanding – questioning.
* **B: Lokaya kriyaa karana aakaaraya therum gaeneemata (Understanding the form of worldly actions):** This is a broader concept and not the core focus of the text's description of a structured educational approach.
* **D: Widyaathmaka paryeshana sandaha maga penvimata (Following the path of the educational environment):**  Following the path is a consequence of the process, not the primary method. The text highlights *how* one follows that path – through questioning and observation.



Therefore, **C** best captures the importance of asking questions within the context of the described structured educational process."
"mema chedayata anuwa, widyaathmaka paryeshana sandaha maga penvimata upakaaree nowanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: nireekshana katayuthu sidu kirima (Observation and recording).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of systematic observation and recording in educational progress.**  It states that understanding the student's learning progress through a methodical approach provides valuable insights.  ""Nireekshana katayuthu sidu kirima"" directly reflects this emphasis on observing and recording progress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hudek widyaathmaka k‍ramaya pamanak (Lack of a systematic educational approach):** The passage explicitly argues *against* a lack of a systematic approach.
* **C: wiya haeki upakalpana baehaera kirimata (Making hypothetical assumptions):** The passage cautions against relying on hypothetical assumptions. It stresses the importance of evidence-based assessment.
* **D: athhada baeleem sidu kirima (Achieving overall success):** While the goal is success, the passage focuses on the *process* of understanding progress, not just achieving a final outcome.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer because it directly aligns with the core message of the passage regarding systematic observation and recording for educational improvement.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Tonado, gas mulinudura damamin, godanaegiliwala kotas kada damamin waahana ihala ahasata visi kara damayi."" (Tornadoes can uproot trees, damage buildings, and throw vehicles into the air.)
* **Option C directly reflects this:**  ""tonedo walin bahutharayak paeya thunakata wada pawathee"" means ""tornadoes can cause a lot of damage to property.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tonedo hata awata aethi saema deyakma winasha kirimata haekiyaawaetha** (Tornadoes can destroy everything in their path): While tornadoes are powerful, the text doesn't claim they destroy *everything*. It specifically mentions damage to property and vehicles.
* **B: tonedo anekuth suli kunatu walata wada kuda p‍radeshawalata pahara deyi** (Tornadoes can warn the local authorities in advance): The text doesn't mention any warning system for tornadoes.
* **D: samahara tonedo walata paeyata saethapum 300k pamana sulangak thibiya haekiya** (The average tornado has a width of 300 km): The text states the tornado in question has a width of 3 km, not 300 km.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mema ruduru kunatu, paeyata ki.mee. 480 (thatparayata meetara 133; paeyata saethapum 300) k dakva wana sulang sahitha wei."" This translates to ""This violent whirlwind, with a width of 480 (approximately 133 miles; width of 300) kilometers, can travel in a straight line.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ewa paeyata saethapum 480k pamana wegayen yuthu sulan nipadwayi** (It spreads out with a width of 480k kilometers). While the passage mentions the width, it doesn't say it *spreads out* in that way. It specifies the *length* it can travel in a straight line.
* **C: ewa anekuth kunatu walata wada wishala p‍radeshawalata balapayi** (It can strike many places and spread to large areas). The passage focuses on the *length* of its travel, not the number of places it hits.
* **D: ewata gas mulinudura daemeemata haekiya** (It doesn't have a wind-driven core). The passage describes it as a ""violent whirlwind,"" implying it *does* have a core of wind.

16 wana siyawasedee minisun kirimata patan gaththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: wasthu wishalanaya kirima (object diversification)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Visaalanaya sandaha minisun visin kaacha saedeema saha bhavitha kireema avurudu dasa dahas gananak thisse siduvannaki."" This translates to ""The volume of the company's profits was calculated based on the expansion of sales and the planned diversification of products.""
* **The passage emphasizes:** The company is planning to ""combine two different types of glass"" to create a larger volume of products. This directly relates to expanding the types of products offered, which is object diversification.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: kaacha bhawitha kirima (glass manufacturing):** While related, it's not the *primary* focus of the expansion. The passage emphasizes *what kind* of products they are manufacturing, not just manufacturing in general.
    * **C: kaacha saedeema (glass sales):** Sales expansion is mentioned, but the core of the expansion is introducing new product types.
    * **D: duradkna nipadavima (market penetration):** This refers to increasing sales within the existing market, not introducing new products or diversifying.

Therefore, the passage explicitly states the company is planning *diversification* of products.
"
kaacha bhawithakaramin minisun kopamana kaalayak wasthun wishalanaya kara thibeda?,"The correct answer is **C: awurudu dahas gananak thisse** (the year the large-scale damage occurred).

Here's why:

* **The question asks *when* the minister became angry.** The text states the minister became angry because of the damage caused by the large-scale hail.
* **Option C directly states the year the damage occurred (""awurudu dahas gananak thisse"" - the year the year 2000 occurred).** This is the most logical timeframe for the minister's anger to arise.
* The other options refer to different aspects of the situation:
    * **A: awurudu dhasak thisse** (the year 2010 occurred) - This is the year the hail was *predicted*, not the year it occurred.
    * **B: 16 wana siyawase aga bhagaye sita** (16 years ago, in the year 2008) - This refers to the time period *before* the hail, not the time when the minister became angry.
    * **D: 16 wana siyawase mul bhagaye sita** (16 years ago, in the year 2008) - Same as B, this refers to the time *before* the hail.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that directly relates to the time the minister became angry, which was when the hail damage happened."
"mema chedayata anuwa, muhammad thumage lena ethumage aadhyaathmika piliweth ho saradharma pilibandawa pawasanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: ohu samaya ha hudekalawa agayakarai (He was a disciplinarian regarding time and meditation)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Muhammad's experience in the cave. Key points include:

*   He was deeply focused on meditation (""dyaana waedeema sandaha"").
*   He experienced a radiant light (""noor"" - alokaaya) and a brilliant, jewel-like appearance (""hiraa"").
*   He was completely absorbed in meditation, oblivious to the outside world.
*   He remained in the cave for a long time, seemingly without needing food or water.

These details strongly suggest that Muhammad was a strict disciplinarian regarding his time and meditation practice. This discipline allowed him to achieve such profound spiritual experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: pitatha shabdaya menehi kirimata upakaaree we (He was helpful in speaking the truth)** - While Muhammad is known for his truthfulness, the passage doesn't directly highlight this aspect of his character *during* his cave experience.
*   **C: ohuta itha sulu hudekala kaalayak awashya wiya (It was necessary for him to meditate for a long time)** - The passage states he *did* meditate for a long time, but it doesn't imply it was a *necessity* to achieve the experience. It was more a result of his discipline.
*   **D: kawurun ho ohu daekeema ha aeseema pilibandawa saelakilimath wiya (He was hesitant to speak about what he saw and experienced)** - The passage doesn't mention Muhammad's reluctance to speak about his experiences. He eventually shared his experiences with others.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of Muhammad's spiritual practice based on the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, yakada mulinma bhawitha kale kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **D: rel peeli**.

The passage states: ""1767 dee palamu purna yakada rail peeli handunvaa dene ladi."" This translates to ""In 1767, the railway was built."" The question asks about what was built in that year. The passage explicitly says the railway was built.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: rel peeli haras kanu** - This translates to ""the railway was a beautiful sight"" which isn't directly supported by the passage.
*   **B: vaegan marga** - This means ""fast road"". While related to the concept, the passage specifically mentions the *railway*.
*   **C: roda** - This means ""road"". The passage mentions ""maarga"" (path/road), but specifically refers to the *railway* being built in 1767.

"mema chedayata anuwa, lee roda wenuwata yakada roda aadesha karanu laebuwe aeyi?","The correct answer is **A: ashwayange wegaya vaedi kirimata** (regarding the improvement of the horse-drawn carriage).

Here's why:

The passage states that the road was initially built to facilitate the movement of horse-drawn carriages (""ashvayinta eva wadi wegayakin aedagena yamatat"").  Later, the road was improved, and the passage implies this improvement was specifically for the better use and efficiency of these carriages (""kramayen, kese namudu, ovunta ihalin yakada pollak thabuwe nam vadaat karyaksama wana bhava waetahena ladi"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ewa wadath kaaryak‍shama lesa salakanu laebeeya** (to get a slightly more efficient work). The passage doesn't focus on general work efficiency, but specifically on the carriage travel.
* **C: wishala barak haesiravimata ewata haeki wiya** (to be able to reach a vast market). While improved roads *can* facilitate trade, the passage doesn't mention this as the primary reason for the road improvement.
* **D: rel peeli matha wu yakadawalin ewata haani vi thibuni** (the railway was built in such a way that it caused damage to the old road). The passage mentions the railway in 1767, after the road improvements. It doesn't say the railway *caused* damage to the existing road.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the road improvements were focused on making the journey with horse-drawn carriages easier and more efficient.

"mema chedayata anuwa, romaentikavada kaala parichchedayedee pudgalayan haedagasva aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: bhoogola widyaawa (geographer)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Romantikavadayata sanskruthika nirnayakaye vishaala angayak tibuni, eya gothe, fitch saha shlegal wani lekhakayingen labaa gannaa ladi.""  This translates to something like: ""In the expansive aspects of romanticism in cultural determination, it is difficult to obtain a complete understanding through just historical, philosophical, and linguistic writings.""  It implies a need for a broader perspective.
* **The text further explains:** ""Romantikavadaye sandarbhaya thula, bhoogola vidyava pudgalayan haedagaesvu athara...""  This translates to: ""For the context of romanticism, it is necessary to consider the field of geography...""
* **The following sentences elaborate on *why* geography is needed:**  ""...kaalayat samaga ema bhoogolayata adala sirith virit ha sanskruthiya paenanagunu athara, meva samaajaye sthaanayata anukula weema aththanomathika lesa panawana lada nitivalata vadaa sudusu viya."" This translates to: ""...along with time, the geographical aspects and the cultural characteristics, so that it aligns with the social situation, and can be understood with a subtle nuance.""

Therefore, the text explicitly states that the field of **geography (bhoogola widyaawa)** is necessary to fully understand romanticism.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: neethi (ethics):** While ethics might be *related* to cultural analysis, the text doesn't highlight ethics as the primary field needed.
* **C: sirith wirith (historical writings):**  The text states historical writings are *insufficient* on their own.
* **D: sanskruthiya (culture):** The text states that culture itself, while important, isn't enough; geography is a complementary field.

Translation: ""The pragmatic ideology proposes that this pragmatic power can achieve many difficult goals through cultural and political power. The pragmatist makes the pragmatist's path equivalent to a socially constructed society instead of a natural society, by creating 'power'.""

This directly addresses the core point of the question - what does the pragmatic decision-maker aim to establish regarding the power of pragmatism in society? The text clearly states that the pragmatist aims to establish the power of pragmatism within society as a socially constructed entity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: thaakshanaye diyunuwa sanskruthiyata balapanne naetha:** The text explicitly states that cultural power *is* used.
* **C: thaakshanaya samajayata aawenika balapaem aethi karai:** While pragmatism *can* be seen as a form of power, the text's focus is on establishing a *socially constructed* power within society, not simply asserting power.
* **D: thaak‍shanika sanwardhanaya deshapalana balapaem matha padanam nowe:** The text states the opposite - pragmatic growth is seen as aligned with political power.

"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan karunu walin dunna aedeema ha sambandha nowana karuna kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: shakthimath shabdayak (powerful sound)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the difference between the ""ihala dunna"" (the sound from the first half) and the ""pahala dunna"" (the sound from the second half). It explicitly states:

* **Ihala dunu wadanayak saamanyayen mrudu shabdayak jananaya karana athara (The sound from the first half usually produces a soft sound).**
* **Pahala dunu wadanayak vada saktimat saha niscita we (The sound from the second half was powerful and certain).**

Therefore, the ""pahala dunna"" is characterized as a powerful sound.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: wada mrudu shabdayak (very soft sound):** This describes the ""ihala dunna,"" not the ""pahala dunna.""
* **B: stepalayak menena salakunak (a step to a strong sound):**  While there's a transition, the key characteristic of the ""pahala dunna"" is its power, not just being a step in a sound.
* **D: dunne hasuruwen aarambha we (began with a laugh):** The passage focuses on sounds, not laughter.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mrudu shabdayakata sambandha wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: pahala dunna salakunak**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly contrasts the ""pahala dunu wadanayak"" (the initial sound) with the ""ihala dunu wadanayak"" (the later sound). The passage states that the ""ihala dunu wadanayak"" is a ""mrudu shabdayak"" (soft sound), whereas the ""pahala dunu wadanayak"" is ""vada saktimat saha niscita"" (loud and firm).  The question asks what is related to the soft sound. Therefore, the answer is ""pahala dunna salakunak"" - the initial sound which is described as the loud sound.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the migration of a large number of people (millions) during Avurudu (a festival).**  This is explicitly stated: ""Avurudu miliyana 2ka sita miliyana 3k paerani athe asthi kotasvala posila chalanaye sita samcalanaya dakva atha visesikaranaya weeme mema maruva pennum karayi.""  (During Avurudu, 2 million to 3 million people migrate, and I am observing this movement.)

* **The question asks what the fossil remains indicate about the movement of the people.** The passage implies that the fossil remains are evidence of this large-scale movement.  Therefore, the fossils would likely demonstrate patterns of migration.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: haesiravima (Hunting):** While hunting can be a reason for movement, the passage focuses on a massive, organized movement related to the festival.
* **B: bara dara gaeneema (Gathering firewood):** Gathering firewood usually involves shorter, more localized movements. It doesn't explain the scale of migration described.
* **D: athin gaman kirima (Walking in a line):** While people might walk in lines during migration, the fossil remains wouldn't necessarily *only* reveal this pattern.  They could reveal more about the direction and scale of the movement.



Therefore, **sancharanaya (migration)** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."

(Chimpanzees were fascinated by their agility and ability to climb trees and their ability to swing from branch to branch.)
* **Option B directly reflects this fascination.** The passage describes the chimpanzees being captivated by the human's movement and ability to move with agility and climb trees, suggesting a connection based on shared physical capabilities.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ewa minisunge ewata wada kelin we** (They were playing with the humans) - While possible, the passage doesn't explicitly say they were playing. It focuses on their fascination with the human's movement.
* **C: ewa bara dara gaeneema sandaha bhawitha we** (They were fascinated by their ability to climb trees) - This is too narrow. The passage mentions more than just climbing trees; it also includes swinging and agility.
* **D: ewa p‍radhaana washayen haesiravima sandaha yoda gaene** (They were trying to imitate the humans' main actions) -  The passage doesn't suggest imitation as the primary motivation. It highlights fascination.



"
kumana sanchithaya thora gaeneemen nawa jaana wichal‍yathawaya iwath weda?,"The correct answer is **B: pratisamyojana kirima**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is needed to avoid a new (vikrtiya) movement of people when combined with a known (prakashitha) movement. The passage states: ""...ek ek paramparava samaga samcita deka athara idiriyata saha pasupasata visamgamana ha **pr pratisamyojana** kavalam weeme vicalanaya venas we.""  This translates to ""...along with the combination of two traditions, avoid movement through joining and rejoining (pr pratisamyojana).""

Therefore, **pr pratisamyojana kirima (rejoining)** is the action required to prevent the new movement from disrupting the known one.
"
jana wichal‍yathawa ek kirima sandaha wagakiwa yuththe kumana kriyaawaliyada?,"The correct answer is **A: visamgamana (intercourse/union)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a process where a ""new human disruption"" (vikrtiya nava jana vicalyathavaya) occurs due to a specific cause. To resolve this, the passage states that a ""union"" (visamgamana) and ""re-joining/reconnection"" (pr pratisamyojana) of two things that were traditionally together are required.

Option A, **visamgamana**, directly translates to ""intercourse"" or ""union"" and fits the context of the passage, which emphasizes bringing things together to restore balance.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **B: pratisamyojana kirima (re-joining/reconnection):** While important, this is a *result* of the initial union described. The passage implies the union is the first step.
*   **C: wikurthiya (distortion/corruption):** This describes the *problem* that needs to be addressed, not a solution.
*   **D: p‍rakaashitha (evident/clear):** This describes a state of being, not an action.

Therefore, **visamgamana** is the most appropriate answer because it describes the core action required to address the disruption.

"mema chedaye aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, “p‍roteen gaetaluwak” wisandeema sandaha p‍raimetayeku anubhawa kala yuththe mevayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: miya giya kola**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Siyalla salaka baladdi, ape muthunmiththanda ada saewana bimwala sitina chimpansiyan aakarayatama siya """"protin gaetaluva"""" visanda gatte yaeyi pawasathoth, apa pudhuma viya yuthu naetha."" which translates to ""All the creatures, including our dear friends living in the forest, have been using the 'protein source' we have discovered for a long time, and we have just learned it.""

The passage then goes on to describe that the ""protein source"" is found in: ""cola varga saha ranila bijawala pawathina protina wana namudu, eva nopisuve nam apa waeni prayimetvarunta jirnaya apahasu we."" which translates to ""protein found in cola types and ranila seeds, and if we don't use our own primary food, we will lose our body's nutrition.""

Finally, the passage mentions ""miya giya kola"" (a type of cola) as a source of protein. Therefore, the passage directly associates the ""protein source"" with ""miya giya kola"".

"mema chedayata anuwa, ath‍yawashya aemaino amla nomaethikama nisa aethi nowana pahatha sandahan gaetalu walin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: mandposhanaya (malnutrition)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Thavada, ese kirimata nohaeki weemen thadabala prativipaka aethi we: vardhana athathiya, manda poshanaya, saha avasan washayen maranaya."" This translates to: ""However, doing this (the described food choices) can lead to the following adverse reactions: stunted growth, malnutrition, and death.""

Therefore, malnutrition (manda poshanaya) is listed as a direct consequence of the improper food choices discussed.

yam upa sanskruthiyaka samajikayan boho wita kandayama samaga owunge sambandhathawaya sankethawath karanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **D: shailiya sankethathmaka aakaarayak lesa bhawitha kirimen (Developing stylistic symbolic forms)**.

Here's why:

The question asks how *upa sanskruthi* (sub-culture) helps people easily identify their social groups. The provided text states that *upa sanskruthi* achieves this through:

* **Bhashamaya (Language):**  Using a specific language or dialect.
* **Saundaryatmaka (Aesthetic):**  Having distinct beauty standards.
* **Agamika (Rituals):**  Practicing particular rituals.
* **Deshapalanika (Regional):**  Reflecting local customs.
* **Lingika (Gender-specific):**  Having gender-related characteristics.
* **Bhugoliya (Geographical):**  Being tied to a particular region.
* **Sadhakavala ekathuvak weemata (A sense of unity):**  Fostering a sense of belonging.
* **Charithrare saha upabhasha harahaa vishesha saha sanketamaya akarayen sangna labaa dethi (Provides identity through history, special language, and symbolic signs).**

Option D directly aligns with this.  Developing stylistic symbolic forms (clothing, hairstyles, jewelry, etc.) is a key way *upa sanskruthi* visually identifies and distinguishes groups. These symbols communicate belonging and shared identity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ekaabaddha kirimata uthsaha kirimen (Encouraging uniformity):**  *Upa sanskruthi* is *not* about uniformity. It's about distinguishing oneself *within* a larger society.
* **B: owun wata sitina saema kenekugema wishvasayan piligaeneemen (Emulating the beliefs of anyone sitting nearby):** This describes conformity, not the formation of a distinct subculture.
* **C: samaja sammathayan piligaeneemen (Emulating social consensus):**  *Upa sanskruthi* often *challenges* social consensus, forming alternative values and practices.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer.

Here's why:

* **The Problem:** The problem states that the current organizational structure hinders performance and that a radical restructuring is needed to achieve better results.
* **The Question:** The question asks what the person (likely a manager or leader) should do in light of this, according to the accepted theory, to achieve radical restructuring.
* **Why A is correct:**  Radical restructuring *requires* encouragement and support. It's not something that happens passively.  The person in charge needs to actively promote and facilitate this change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: daruva tharjanathmaka haesireemata sambandha vimata vaedi idak aetha** (The person should not interfere with radical restructuring related principles). This is incorrect.  Interference is likely to *hinder* the restructuring.
* **C: samaja thathwayan wethin daruva iwath wanu aetha** (The person should stick to social norms within the organization).  Radical restructuring often *challenges* social norms.  Sticking to norms will prevent change.
* **D: daruva wenath vargika sulutharayan samaga katayuthu kirima p‍rathik‍shepa karanu aetha** (The person should reject working with the existing organizational solution).  Rejection is not a solution.  While the current solution is inadequate, dismissing it entirely without a plan is unproductive.  The focus should be on moving *beyond* it.



Therefore, **A** is the most appropriate and logical answer. It aligns with the need for proactive leadership in driving organizational change."
"mema chedayata anuwa, vargika ekaakruthi pilibanda daruwekuge daenuma balapaemak aethi kala haekke pahatha sandahan karunu walin kumana karunatada?","The best answer is **D: jathiya pilibanda owunge artha daekvima (Understanding their ethnic meaning)**. Here's why:

* **The problem states:** The core issue is that children are not achieving good results in quadratic equations *because* their ethnic background and related cultural factors are not considered. This implies a connection between cultural understanding and academic performance.
* **Option D directly addresses this:** Understanding the ethnic meaning and context of the material could help bridge the gap and improve understanding. It suggests a more holistic approach to teaching and learning.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: owun handuna gaeneemata thora ganna vargika sulutharaya (Telling them to solve quadratic equations):**  This is too simplistic.  It doesn't address the root cause of the problem, which seems to be a lack of foundational understanding influenced by cultural factors.
* **B: owunge haesireema (Their effort/work):** While effort is important, the problem suggests that effort alone isn't enough.  The cultural context is influencing how effort is applied and understood.
* **C: anek daruwan samaga owunge sambandhathawaya (Their relationship with many children):**  This is irrelevant to the mathematical problem and the ethnic/cultural context.

**Therefore, understanding the ethnic meaning of the quadratic equations is the most logical and appropriate solution.**

"mema chedayata anuwa, p‍rachanda daruwange wardhanayata anurupa wiya nohaeki wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: shakthimath sanvada kusalatha (powerful communication skills)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that powerful communication skills are crucial for managing ""prachanda"" (strong/violent) children. It states that such children often have a tendency towards harmful behaviors and difficulties in social interaction.  The text suggests that instead of simply suppressing their behavior, a more effective approach is to guide them with wisdom and to communicate with them in a way that addresses their underlying needs. This points directly to the importance of strong communication skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: thaniwama jiwath vima (self-reliance):** While self-reliance is good, the text doesn't primarily focus on this. It highlights the need for guidance and interaction rather than independent strength.
* **C: hudekala vime p‍rawanathawa (wisdom in practical matters):** Wisdom is mentioned, but the text links it to communication and guidance, not solely practical wisdom.
* **D: samaja kanassalla (social awareness):** Social awareness is important, but the core argument revolves around *how* to communicate with and manage strong children, not just being aware of social dynamics.  Effective communication *develops* social awareness in a positive way.

"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan karunu walin lamun thula p‍rachanda haesireema niwaerediwa wisthara karanne kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: shaareerika durwalathawayak nisa bahutharayak p‍rachanda haesireem aethi we (Due to physical weakness, many children exhibit aggression)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that aggressive behavior in children shouldn't be immediately labeled as ""prachanda"" (violent/extreme). Instead, it suggests considering the underlying reasons for the behavior.

The text states: ""Atahaera daemimata how palaa yamata pere mema prachanda daruvan thadabala lama apacarayata how chitta kampanayata lakwa athdaekim labuwan viya haekiya. Samaharu sathun visin aethi dadi karana ladaei codana kere; samaharu thanivama wanaye jivath woo bhava pawase.

This translates to: ""Therefore, it's possible that this aggressive child is lacking something - perhaps feeling powerless and unable to protect themselves.  The fight isn't about dominance; it's about survival. If we understand the complete context, we see that this child (in terms of their physical boundaries) is acting out of a need to protect themselves, driven by a feeling of vulnerability and a lack of strength.""

This indicates that the aggressive behavior might stem from a feeling of physical weakness or a lack of ability to protect oneself.  Therefore, option A directly addresses a possible underlying reason for the aggression.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: p‍rachanda haesireema adu samajagatha vimen aethiwiya haekiya (Aggressive behavior isn't necessarily a social problem)**: The text *does* imply that aggressive behavior can be a problem needing understanding, even if it isn't"

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks about factors that contribute to successful agriculture.**
* **The provided text (P) emphasizes the importance of livestock (specifically cows) in agriculture.** It states that livestock are essential for achieving agricultural goals and highlights their role in producing essential resources.
* **Option A directly relates to the text.**  The text mentions the necessity of livestock manure and fertilizer for agricultural production.  Therefore, paying attention to these aspects is crucial for successful farming.
* **The other options are less directly linked to the text's central theme:**
    * **B: an ayata wikineema sandaha aahara nishpadanaya kirima** (Producing food according to the needs of the population) - While important, it's not the primary focus of the text.
    * **C: diyunu thaak‍shanika k‍rama walata wada ihala asvaennak labaa gaeneema kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (Paying attention to obtaining income by cultivating in a quick and efficient manner) - The text doesn't prioritize quick income generation. It focuses on sustainable agricultural practices and the role of livestock.
    * **D: gowiyaage p‍radeshayata desheeya beeja labaa gaeneema** (Obtaining national seeds from the cow's region) -  While seed quality is important, the text focuses more on the overall contribution of livestock, including their waste products.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the given text."

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the long history of agriculture and the use of simple, traditional methods passed down through generations. It mentions the simplicity and adaptability of these methods. Option A directly reflects this emphasis on traditional techniques.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: eya asvaenna uparima kirimata anan‍ya thaak‍shanika k‍rarama bhawitha karai (It is based on exclusively modern techniques).** The passage explicitly contrasts this with traditional methods.
* **C: eya govinta owunge wagawan owunge kalapaya pura beda gaeneemata ida salasayi (It is suitable for adapting to the knowledge and ideas of the farmer).** While traditional methods *are* adaptable, the primary focus of the passage isn't on individual farmer ingenuity in the way this option suggests. It highlights the *inherent* adaptability of the methods themselves.
* **D: eya thawamath samahara ratawala govin wisin bhawithakaranu laebe (It can achieve further improvements in the agricultural sector).** The passage focuses on the historical success of traditional methods, not necessarily their potential for *further* improvements.

Therefore, option A best encapsulates the central theme of the provided text."

* **The passage explicitly defines ""winodatmaka sanchaaraka karmaanthaya"" as transportation for leisure and enjoyment.** It describes people traveling for fun, without needing to reach a specific destination. It mentions gardens and forests as destinations for pleasure.

* **The question asks which type of transportation is *directly* related to entertainment.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wyaaparika sanchaaraka karmanthaya (commercial transportation):**  This refers to transportation for business purposes, which isn't the focus of the passage's definition of ""winodatmaka.""
* **C: sanskruthika sanchaaraka karmanthaya (cultural transportation):** While the passage mentions cultural understanding, it's framed as a *benefit* of this type of transportation, not its primary defining characteristic.
* **D: elimahan sanchaaraka karmanthaya (scientific transportation):** The passage doesn't mention scientific transportation at all.



Therefore, the passage directly defines and focuses on entertainment-focused transportation, making option B the correct answer.

This translates to: ""For those who visit a certain place and gain understanding of its history and culture, this type of travel business is a cultural travel business.""  The emphasis is on gaining knowledge of local history and culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: desheeya sanskruthiyata anugatha vima** (Compliance with national culture): While cultural travel *can* be compliant with national culture, the passage doesn't highlight this as the *primary* focus of recreational travel.
* **B: owunge dainika katayuthu walin witawekayak labaa gaeneema** (Getting a break from their daily routine):  The passage mentions relaxation as a benefit, but it's not the main point.

Here's why:

The passage states that understanding the historical context of the region's temples (and the importance of self-reliance and entrepreneurship) is helpful. It also mentions that achieving benefits and self-reliance is crucial for the development of local temples, especially regarding new ventures and directions.  The final sentence emphasizes the importance of creating a positive environment for new ventures, which directly links to entrepreneurship and self-reliance.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: sanwidhaanaye sanskruthiyata balapaem kala pudgalayin pilibanda gaemburu awabodhayak labaa gaeneema (gaining an understanding of the cultural strength of the people and the role of the temple):** While important, this is a broader concept and not as directly tied to the *practical* benefits of entrepreneurship for the temples.
* **C: sanwidhaanaye gaamaka balawega soyaa gaeneema (understanding the power of the village community):**  The passage mentions community support, but entrepreneurship and self-reliance are highlighted as being particularly beneficial.
* **D: sanwidhaanaye ithihasaya awabodha kara gaeneema (understanding the history of the temple):**  Historical context is important, but the passage stresses the *benefits* of self-reliance and entrepreneurial endeavors, which are not solely tied to historical understanding.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that understanding the history of one's own culture is crucial for understanding the history of the constitution. It states that gaining an insight into the constitution's history, by understanding the culture's history, is beneficial. Therefore, focusing on the fundamental role and importance of the constitution is the key to gaining this understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wenas vima sandaha wu biya adu kirima** (conducting research related to new ideas): While research is important, the passage focuses on historical understanding, not just new ideas.
* **B: saaradharma shakthimath kirima** (performing actions with spiritual power): This is irrelevant to the passage's discussion of cultural and constitutional history.
* **D: vyavasayaka haesireema vaedi diyunu kirima** (conducting actions for entrepreneurial success): This is also unrelated to the core theme of understanding cultural and constitutional history.



Therefore, **C** directly addresses the core concept of the passage: the importance of understanding the constitution's history, which is intertwined with understanding one's own cultural history and its foundational importance."

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes a shift in perspective and a letting go of preconceived notions (""nirapeksatva nidahasak labaa dei"").** It suggests that new experiences can challenge our existing beliefs.
* **Option B directly reflects this by highlighting the importance of being attentive to the faith and beliefs of others (""igeneema apa athwindinu aethaeyi wishvasa karana dewal kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kala yuthuya"").**  This aligns with the idea that encountering new things can broaden our understanding of different perspectives.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: samahara igenum athdaekeem anek ewata wada p‍rayojanawath we (Sometimes a single experience is very useful):** While true, it doesn't capture the core message of the passage, which is about *multiple* new experiences challenging our beliefs.
* **C: samahara igenum k‍rama anek ewata wada hondayi (Sometimes a sequence of experiences is good):**  Similar to A, it's not the central point of the passage.
* **D: igeneemedee kisidu nirapek‍shathawayak nomaetha (The new is always detachment):** This is incorrect. The passage doesn't suggest that new experiences *always* lead to detachment. It's about challenging existing beliefs, not necessarily abandoning them.



Therefore, **B** best captures the essence of how new experiences can broaden our understanding and challenge our assumptions, as highlighted in the passage.

The passage describes the benefits of learning new things, emphasizing that it's not just about acquiring knowledge but also about developing skills and gaining perspectives. It mentions that learning can lead to changes in our behavior and outlook.

Option C accurately reflects this: ""Learning a new skill is beneficial in itself, and it also provides two advantages."" This captures the essence of the passage, which highlights both the intrinsic value of learning and its practical implications.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: thorathuru igena gaeneemata boho k‍rama thibe** (There are many ways to learn): While true, this is too general and doesn't capture the core idea of the passage.
*   **B: samahara igenum athdaekeem sandaha wenath athdaekeem walata wada p‍ramukhathwaya labaa diya yuthuya** (When learning a new skill, you will gain prominence in that area): The passage doesn't specifically focus on gaining prominence.
*   **D: api kawadawath bhawitha nokarana daenuma thawamath igena gaeneemata watee** (We learn even things we might not do in the future): While the passage mentions learning seemingly useless things, it doesn't emphasize this as the primary benefit.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Obey ninde oralosuva nawatha sakasanne nam, eya kamaraye anek paette thabiya haeki athara, evita eya akriya kirimata aenden nagitimata obata bala karayi."" (If the regular oral hygiene is not maintained, it can lead to many problems, and it can prevent you from achieving complete cavity elimination.) This implies that waiting a certain amount of time after oral hygiene practices is important.

* **Option C aligns with this:** ""aenda asala mesaya matha elam oralosuwa kriyaa witarahithakara winadi 20 kata pasu naewatha nindata yaama."" (Wait 20 minutes after the usual oral hygiene practice before eating.)  This waiting period allows the enamel to re-harden, making it less susceptible to damage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: naewata nida gaeneemata pera paeya eka hamarak kiyavima** (It is better to avoid regular oral hygiene.) - This is completely false and goes against the entire passage, which emphasizes the importance of oral hygiene.
* **B: vaesikiliya bhawitha kirima saha naewatha nindata yaama** (Brush and floss and then eat.) -  Eating immediately after brushing and flossing can wash away the fluoride in the toothpaste, reducing its effectiveness.
* **D: aenda asala mesaya matha bothalayen jalaya panaya kirimata awadi vima** (Wait before drinking water after brushing teeth.) - Similar to option B, drinking water immediately after brushing can wash away the fluoride.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and supported by the passage."

Here's why:

* **The question asks for a detailed explanation regarding the problem of delayed urination.** Option B directly addresses the core issue mentioned in the provided text:  *not completely emptying the bladder*. The text explicitly states this as a contributing factor to delayed urination.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: eya jiwa widyaathmaka ridmaya matha padanam wiya haekiya** (It's a matter of spiritual inclination).  This is irrelevant to the physical problem of delayed urination and leans towards a metaphysical explanation.
* **C: mema kriyaawaliya obe saaman‍ya nidi kaalaya thula sidu we** (My actions achieved the normal urination time). This is a bit vague and doesn't specifically address *why* the urination was delayed.
* **D: awadivimen pasu, ilakkaya wanne paeya dekak aethulatha naewatha nindata vaeteemai** (After urinating, ignoring the fact that you didn't completely empty your bladder will lead to delayed urination). This option *correctly* identifies the consequence of not emptying the bladder, but option B explains the root cause, making it the *more detailed explanation*.



Therefore, option B provides the most direct and crucial explanation for why delayed urination might occur, according to the text.

"molaya nithara nithara sihina daekeemata uthsaha karana wita, eyin vaedi wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: REM thathwayan athara kaalaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the experience of lucid dreaming (nitharama paahe).**  It states that the feeling of extraordinary abilities during lucid dreaming arises from the brain's ability to extend the normal timeframe of events. The passage specifically mentions that the ""wonder and extraordinary ability"" stems from the brain's capacity to make normal time seem longer during the dream.

* **REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep is the stage of sleep where most vivid dreaming occurs.**  And lucid dreaming is strongly associated with REM sleep.  The passage directly links the ""extended timeframe"" and ""wonder"" to REM-related processes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: REM thathwayan pramanaya (REM principle):** While REM is related, ""principle"" is too broad and doesn't capture the specific mechanism described in the passage.
* **B: shakthi mattama (pure willpower):** The passage emphasizes brain processes, not just willpower.
* **C: p‍rakurthi thathwayata path vime diga (long path towards natural principles):**  This is unrelated to the concept of lucid dreaming and brain activity during REM sleep.



Therefore, **REM thathwayan athara kaalaya (REM's extension of time)** is the most accurate answer based on the passage's content."

Here's why:

The text describes a scenario where someone experiences vivid dreams (paehaedili sihina) and believes it's due to prolonged scientific meditation (savignanika sihina magin samanya thathwayan athara kaalaya dirgha kireema). The text also states that simply meditating for a long time doesn't guarantee vivid dreams.

It then connects vivid dreams to REM sleep (paehaedili sihina daekeema) and suggests a potential connection to the body's innate psychic energy (rinathmaka balapaem).  The text links this to a single night of REM sleep.  It explains that experiencing vivid dreams is like a short-term (saema minittu vissakata) experience.

Option D, ""ek rath‍riyak sandaha wana REM vaedi vima"" (A single night's REM sleep), aligns best with this explanation.  The text is discussing *when* and *why* vivid dreams occur and linking them to a specific sleep stage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: REM thathwayan athara keti kaalaya (REM sleep stage)**: This is too general. While REM sleep *is* relevant, the text focuses on a specific night's experience rather than the broader stage.
* **B: ek rath‍riyak sandaha wana REM adu vima (A single night's REM sleep)**:  This option is very similar to D.  While the context is right, option D uses the term ""vaedi vima"" which means ""experience,"" which better fits the text.  Option B uses ""adu vima"" which means ""sleep"" which isn't as accurate.
* **C: paehaedili sihina daekeema matha randa paewatheema (Vivid dreams and the body's psychic energy)**: The text mentions the possibility of the connection between vivid dreams and body's psychic energy, but doesn't focus on the relation between vivid dreams and psychic energy in detail.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, samp‍radayika kandayam saha athathya kandayam eka ha samana wanne keseda?","The correct answer is **C: Kandayam dekama adrushyamana kalamanakarana kandayamakata vaartha karai.**

Here's why:

The text states that both traditional (sampradhaika) and modern (athathya) ""kandaayam"" (which seems to be a concept related to social context/perception) are related to the ""adrsyamana kandaayama"" (invisible/unseen social context).  The invisible social context is defined as the social context that influences perception. Therefore, both traditional and modern kandaayam are influenced by and relate to this unseen social context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kandayam deke kriyaakaarithwaya ekama mattamakin thibenu aethaeyi apekshaa kere (Both kandaayam have only one active element, and there is no expectation.)** - The text doesn't suggest they have only one active element. It highlights differences.
* **B: Kandayam dekatama owunge edineda katayuthu waladee wiwidha mattamwala svayaththathavak aetha (Kandayam are different in their self-sufficiency to a certain extent.)** - While there might be differences in self-sufficiency, the core point isn't about them being different in that aspect.
* **D: Kandayam dekama ekama kaala kalapayaka kriyaathmaka we (Both kandaayam are active in the same time frame.)** - The text doesn't provide information about them being active in the same timeframe.

"mema chedayata anuwa, bhawthika ha athathya kandayam sambandhayen sath‍ya nowana p‍rakaashaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: athathya kandayam boho wita samp‍radayika kandayam sandaha sambandhatha lak‍sh‍yaya lesa kriyaakarai.**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""...athathya kandaayam samaajikayin nitharama thamange aasannathama bhautika kandaayame sambandhatha sthaanaya lesa kriya karayi. Ovunge kandaayam ovunge pradeshiya kalamanakaritvayata noterena vividha kaala kalapa anuva rasviya haeki nisa ovunta nitharama sampradhaika kandaayam samaajikayekuta vadaa waedi svayaththathavak thibe.""

Translation: ""...abstract social norms are influenced by their nearby physical norms. Their norms, based on local customs and influenced by various historical periods, are often intertwined with traditional social norms and develop autonomously.""

This means abstract norms *often* relate to and are influenced by traditional norms. Option B accurately reflects this, stating that abstract norms *often* have a relationship with and are influenced by traditional norms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: samp‍radayika kandayam saaman‍yayen ihala p‍ramithiyaka pawathva ganu laebe (Traditional norms generally have a greater influence on perception):** While traditional norms *do* have influence, the text emphasizes the *intertwining* and *influence* of abstract norms on physical norms, not just the dominance of traditional norms.
* **C: samp‍radayika kandayam walata athathya kandayam walata wada adu svadheenathwayak aetha (Traditional norms are completely subordinate to abstract norms):** The text doesn't suggest complete subordination. It points to a *relationship* and *influence*, not complete control.
* **D: wiwidha kaala kalapawalata athathya kandayam walata p‍rathilabha labaa deemata haekiya (Abstract norms can gain advantages from various historical periods):** The text mentions historical periods influencing traditional norms, but not abstract norms gaining advantages *from* them.

Therefore, option B best encapsulates the information presented in the text.

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes that the ""strength of someone's temperament and the influence of their environment"" are key factors in determining whether individuals are capable of acting and whether they choose to do so.  It directly connects the environment to the shaping of actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: vaedihiti wiyedee saebae wana nawa aashawan (New aspirations related to scientific progress):**  While aspirations might be a factor, the text doesn't focus on aspirations specifically.
* **C: abhyanthara awashyatha (Internal necessity):**  While internal needs are relevant, the text also strongly emphasizes the influence of the external environment.
* **D: minisunge ruchikathwayan awabodha kara gaeneema (Understanding someone's taste):**  Understanding someone's taste is not directly linked to the concept of achieving satisfactory justice.



Therefore, option B most accurately reflects the core message of the text."
thekada neethiyata ayath nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: wasthuwak thula jiwitathaya saha shakthiya nirmanaya kirima.**

Here's why:

* **The question describes a method for creating a ""boho apavaadayata"" (likely referring to a type of energy or vibration) by focusing on a specific area of the head and forehead.** This is about building vitality and strength within the energy system, not just manipulating external forms.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: wasthuwa sthaanagatha kala haeki sthaanaya sandaha mulika rekhaawak nirmanaya kirima (Creating a root line by building the inherent energy and shape of the object).** While energy work *can* influence form, the initial description focuses more on internal energy building.
* **C: wasthuwa nishchitha ha phaladaayee sthaanayaka thabaa gaeneema (Obtaining a certain and fruitful place/location for the object).**  This is too focused on location and not the internal process described.
* **D: rupayak thula piliwelak aethi kirima (The act of filling the form with a weight).** This is a very literal interpretation and doesn't capture the energetic building described.



Therefore, option B best aligns with the description of building vitality and strength within the energy system of the ""boho apavaadayata.""

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Boho saamanya aaakruthi (udaharanayak lesa aps pavule aaakruthi) mema darshanaanupathayata samaana ho itha asanna ho wei."" This translates to ""A very common shape (for example, a slightly rectangular shape) is approximately equal to this aspect ratio.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya thawamath nishpadanaye pawathee** (It is also a result of its design): While design plays a role, the passage focuses on the *aspect ratio* being similar to common shapes.
* **B: eya dijital kaemara aakruthi wisin sammatha karana ladee** (It is a result of agreeing with digital camera shapes): The passage discusses the relationship between the 35mm format and digital camera aspect ratios, but the core point is about the aspect ratio's similarity to common shapes in general.
* **D: eya lokaye wadathma podu aakruthiyayi** (It is the smallest shape in the world):  The passage doesn't mention anything about being the smallest shape. The focus is on the aspect ratio and its commonness.



Therefore, **C** is the only option directly supported by the information presented in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that the visual perception of a large glass object is enhanced by the reflection of its surroundings, particularly the distant landscape.** The passage states, ""...visalana kacavalata ida dee atha. Kachaye uparima vivaraya (vegaya) saamanyayen pahala ekak weema visalana kacha wala thavat avasiyak wanne ya. Memagin mila adu visalana kacha flash bhavithayen torava adu aloka thathwayan yatathe bhavitha kirimata apahasu we."" (Translation: ""Large visual perception is enhanced. Generally, a large glass object requires a primary reflection.  This reflection, like a flash of light, helps to create a realistic illusion."")
* **Option C directly addresses this reflection.** It says, ""owunge chayaarupaye gunathmakabhawaya sthaawara naabhi durak sahitha kaacha walata samana we"" (Translation: ""The quality of its reflection is the same as in a large glass object with a distant landscape"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ewata ihala kaacha wegayak aetha** (Translation: ""There is a glass way""). This is too general and doesn't explain *why* the visual perception is enhanced.
* **B: adu aaloka thathwayan yatathe ewa bhawitha kirimata pahasuya** (Translation: ""It is a technique to make the light reflect realistically""). While realism is important, this doesn't explain the *source* of that realism – the reflection of the surroundings.
* **D: ewaye nabheeya dura sankeernathawa pradhaana kaachayata wada aduya** (Translation: ""The complexity of the distant landscape is in the primary glass object"").  The complexity of the landscape *contributes* to the realism, but the passage focuses on the *reflection* of that landscape.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and directly reflects the information presented in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of the ""upper part"" (upper part - uparima wiwaraya) of the large lens (visalana kacha) in focusing light.** It states that the upper part is crucial for achieving good quality images with long focal lengths. The text mentions that the large lens should be designed to focus light in a way that mimics the natural way our eyes work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: obata adu kaacha sanrachaka awashya we nam (You need a lens assembly):** While you *need* a lens assembly, the passage is specifically about the *design* of a large lens and not the entire assembly.
* **C: aduru aaloka thaththwayan thula dee obata flaesh bhawitha kirimata awashya naethinam (Extra light is not necessary for you to flash it):**  The passage is about the lens's focusing capabilities, not about needing extra light for flashing.
* **D: obata vaedi nabheeya sankeernathawayak awashya wanne nam (You need a complex lens):** The passage doesn't necessarily advocate for a *complex* lens, only a *large* one designed with specific optical properties.



Therefore, option A directly reflects the core message of the provided text regarding the importance of the lens's upper part for effective light focusing.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the guidance and nourishment offered to disciples by the Guptavadaya.** It states they are helped to develop their wisdom and sharp intellect to understand the divine reality (divyamaya yathaarthaya).
* **Option C directly reflects this central theme of discipleship and intellectual development within the Guptavadaya.**

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A:** While the passage mentions a shared philosophical basis and understanding, it doesn't focus on the disciples' *attention* being drawn to these shared aspects.  It's more about the *guiding* role.
* **B:**  The passage mentions understanding the ultimate truth (aathmaathika satya), but it's not presented as the primary *expectation* placed on disciples.  It's something they are *helped* to understand.
* **D:** The passage mentions a rejection of many traditional beliefs, but it's not the core reason disciples are drawn to the Guptavadaya.  The guidance and development of wisdom are more fundamental.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided passage.

"mema chedayata anuwa, gupthavadaye kendraya nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: wingaanaya pilibanda p‍reethimath thathwayak kerehi awadhaanaya kireemeni.**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Guptavadaya as a path to understand the ultimate reality.** It mentions devotion (devatvaya), intrinsic truth (adyaatmika sathyaya), and the realization of the divine (deviyan samaga sannivedanaya).  It also emphasizes sharp intellect (tikshna buddhiyen) and focus on a unique, self-aware reality (advitiya savignaanika thathwayaka riju pudhgalika).

* **The question asks what is central to understanding Guptavadaya.**

* **Option C directly reflects this central theme.** It states that understanding Guptavadaya involves paying attention to the underlying principles (wingaanaya pilibanda) and focusing on the inherent truth (preethimath thathwayak).  This aligns perfectly with the passage's descriptions of its core tenets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: diwyamaya yathaarthaya thula sahaja buddhiya sevima:** While service (sevima) is mentioned, the emphasis isn't solely on service, and ""thula sahaja buddhiya"" (weight of innate wisdom) isn't the central understanding of Guptavadaya as described.

* **B: hawul, podu athdaekeem haraha theekshana buddhiya labaa gaeneema:**  This focuses on gaining sharp intellect (theekshana buddhiya labaa gaeneema), but the passage describes more than just intellectual gain; it includes a deeper understanding of reality and the divine.

* **D: dewiyan pilibanda sawingaanika daenuwathbhawayak labaa gaeneema:**  This emphasizes gaining the ability to realize the divine (dewiyan pilibanda sawingaanika daenuwathbhawayak labaa gaeneema), which is *part* of Guptavadaya but not the *central* aspect of *understanding* it.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate response."
"mema chedayata anuwa, krushikaarmika samajayak aarambha kale kawurun wiya haekida?","The correct answer is **C: polineesiyaawe maori janathawa**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Maori janathava polyneesiawe sita vishaala yatraa haraha sankramanaya woo bawath..."" which translates to ""The Maori people migrated from Polynesia in a vast journey and settled here...""

This directly answers the question of who started the agricultural society in the early days. The text clearly indicates the Maori people from Polynesia were the ones who migrated and established the agricultural society.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nawaseelanthaye moriyori warun** - ""Navaseelanthaye moriyori warun"" means ""The Maori people in Navaseelanthaya"". While the Maori were *in* Navaseelanthaya, this doesn't explain *who started* the agricultural society.
*   **B: chaetham doopath wala moriyori warun** - ""Chaetham doopath wala moriyori warun"" means ""The Maori people after the arrival"". Again, this indicates a time frame but doesn't explain the origins of the agricultural society.
*   **D: p‍radhaana bhoomiye maori warun** - ""Pradhaana bhoomiye maori warun"" means ""The Maori people in the main land"". Similar to A, this indicates location but not the origin.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, maoree warun dadayam kala kandayama palamu vaesiyan wuye kumana sthaanayeda?","The correct answer is **B: nawaseelanthaya (New Zealand)**.

Here's why:

This translates to: ""The Maori people undertook a vast migration from Polynesia and, establishing an agricultural society, arrived in New Zealand and established their way of life.""

Therefore, the text explicitly mentions that the Maori people settled in New Zealand (Navasilantaya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pradhaana bhoomiya (Mainland):** While New Zealand is a landmass, the text specifically points to *New Zealand* as the location.
* **C: chaetham doopath (settlement/new land):**  This is a general term for settlement and doesn't pinpoint the specific location.
* **D: polineesiyaawa (Polynesia):** Polynesia is the origin of the Maori people, not their final destination.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eya 1970 gananvaladi, athdaekim rahitha namannanta how seemitha motor haekiyaawan yuth ayata upaakarayak lesa john smith visin sanvardhanaya kaleya."" (In the 1970s, a name, free from copyright, helped John Smith's origami gain recognition).

This clearly indicates that the name was *necessary* for the origami to be recognized and gain success. Options A, B, and D don't accurately reflect this.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Pureland origami yanu varakata ek naemimak pamanak kala haeki origami wana athara, naewatha naemim waeni vadaat sankirna naeweem valata ida nodena athara, siyalu naemim riju sthana sahitha we.""  This translates to ""Pureland origami, a type of paper folding art, has a unique appeal because it's not just about folding but also about the complex and intricate details that come together with all the pureland-themed elements.""
* The second sentence mentions its connection to John Smith and his contribution to the promotion of limited motor vehicles. 
* The crucial connection is the ""Pureland"" theme. The question asks *why* the Pureland origami gained popularity.  The passage indicates it was popular *because* it was built on a pureland-themed design.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mema k‍ramayata naewatha naemeem aethulath nowe** (It wasn't built in a sequential order). The passage doesn't mention anything about the order of construction.
* **C: naemeem walata riju sthaana thibiya yuthuyi** (It's a type of art with religious elements). While true, this doesn't explain *why* it gained popularity.
* **D: seemitha motar haekiyaawan aethi namannan sandaha eya honda k‍ramayaki** (It's a Honda-related design based on the limited motor vehicle concept). This is completely irrelevant; the passage doesn't link the origami to Honda.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, indu nimna shishtachaaraya ha sambandha nowana sthaanaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: Harappa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...ehi palamu bim kanina ladde 1920 gananvaladi ya. **harappavata pasu eyata harappa sistaachaaraya lesa samaharu handunvati**...""  This translates to ""...it is evident that Harappa also had similar customs and Harappa customs were found to be similar to Harappa...""

Therefore, the Indus Valley Civilization's customs are most directly linked to **Harappa**. The other options are incorrect:

*   **Sarasvati Ganga:**  While the text mentions the Sarasvati River and its association with the Indus Valley Civilization, it doesn't directly state that the customs are linked to the river itself.
*   **Eesanadiga Afghanistan:** The text positions this as a broader comparison to the whole subcontinent, not a specific location *where* the Indus Valley Civilization customs are found.
*   **Noothana Pakistanaye Boho Pradesha:** This refers to modern-day Pakistan and doesn't pinpoint a specific archaeological site or location tied to the ancient customs.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions ""Indu-Saraswati Civilization"" (indu-saraswathee sistaachaaraya) multiple times.** It states that the Indus Valley Civilization (which included Harappa) was a prominent civilization of that era, comparable to India and Afghanistan, and that it flourished along the banks of the Saraswati and Indus rivers.
* **The passage also connects this civilization to the Vedic period.** It speculates about potential links between the Indus Valley Civilization and the later Vedic culture, including the goddess Saraswati.
* **The other options are less accurate:**
    * **Harappan Civilization (harappanu shishtachaaraya):** While Harappa was a major city of the Indus Valley Civilization, ""Indu-Saraswati Civilization"" is a more comprehensive and accepted term for the entire culture.
    * **Indu Ganga Civilization (indu ganga shishtachaaraya):**  The passage highlights the importance of both the Indus and Saraswati rivers, not just the Ganga.
    * **Indu Nimna Civilization (indu nimna shishtachaaraya):**  ""Nimna"" suggests a lower or lesser civilization, which is not supported by the passage's description of the Indus Valley Civilization's grandeur.



Therefore, **Indu-Saraswati Civilization** best reflects the subject matter discussed in the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, digu kaaleena p‍rathilabha labaa gatha haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: an aya samaga sahayogayen katayuthu kirima (cooperation with others)**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks about the key to achieving long-term benefits. It's asking what leads to sustained gains.
* **The paragraph (P)** explains that being self-serving (aatmarthakami) might provide short-term gains, but ultimately cooperation and helping others (denaa siya) yields better long-term results.  It highlights the idea that working together prevents conflict and allows for mutual benefit.
* **Option A** directly reflects this: ""Cooperation with others.""  It's the most accurate interpretation of the paragraph's central point.
* **Options B, C, and D** focus on individual gain or short-term benefits, contradicting the main argument of the paragraph. Option B emphasizes self-interest, option C focuses on providing for many, and option D suggests giving only what's needed – not necessarily the best approach for long-term advantage as presented in the paragraph.



Therefore, **A** aligns perfectly with the paragraph's message and addresses the question's core concern about long-term benefits."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kenekuta k‍shanika awashyatha gaena saelakilimath wanne nam, owunta p‍ramukhathawaya deemata haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: sahayogaya (cooperation)**.

Here's why:

* **P's message:**  The passage in P describes how selfless actions and cooperation ultimately lead to greater benefit than selfish ones.  It emphasizes working *with* others.
* **Q's question:** Q asks about the best way to help someone in a moment of immediate need.
* **Hayogaya (cooperation/help):** This directly aligns with the spirit of the passage in P and the request in Q.  Offering help is the act of cooperation.
* **Pararthakaameethwaya (self-interest):**  This is the opposite of what P advocates for.
* **Sahayogeethawa (helpful attitude/spirit):** While a helpful attitude is important, *sahayogaya* (cooperation/action of helping) is the practical response to the question.
* **Aathmarthakaamithwaya (selfishness):**  Again, this contradicts the passage's message.



Therefore, **sahayogaya (cooperation)** is the best fit because it directly addresses the need for helping someone and aligns with the positive, collaborative message of the initial passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, yuddhaye pirivaeyen wishala kotasak gewwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **D: pilipeena janathawa (Filipino people)**.

Here's why:

* **The first paragraph (P)** talks about the historical exploitation of the Philippines by American imperialism and the resulting resentment among Filipinos.  It explicitly mentions that the Filipino people sought revenge.
* **The second question (Q)** asks what a large portion of the war resulted in.
* **Option D** directly connects to the sentiment expressed in the first paragraph. The Filipino people were the ones who ultimately experienced the consequences (and sought redress) from the American domination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pilipeena rajaya (Philippine state):** While the state was affected, the question asks about the *result* of the war, which is more about the people.
* **B: wol street baenku (Wall Street bank):**  While Wall Street banks benefited from the exploitation, they weren't the direct recipients of the war's outcome for the Filipino people.
* **C: aemarikaanu yatath witajitha palanaya (American victorious power):** The ""victorious power"" wasn't the recipient of the consequences for the Filipino people.

templarwarunge yugayata pera paewathiye kumana yugayada?,"The correct answer is **C: mul madhyakaaleena yugaya (early medieval age)**.

* **The passage states:** ""mema siduvim sidu woo kaalaya saamanyayen yuropiya ithihasaye ihala madyakalina avadhiye 11, 12 saha 13 satavarsa washayen saelake (kri.wa. 1000-1300)."" This translates to: ""generally speaking, in European history, the medieval period is considered to be the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).""
* **It further clarifies:** ""Ihala madyakalina yugayata pere purva madyakalina yugayatat pasuwa sammuthiyen 1500 pamana wanawita pamana avasan wana pascat madyakalina yugayat pawathee.""  This means the medieval period followed the early medieval period and ended around the 1500s.
* **The question asks:** ""templarwarunge yugayata pera paewathiye kumana yugayada?"" (In which age did the Templar era peak?)
* **The passage doesn't specifically mention the Templars peaking,** but it places the medieval period (11th-13th centuries) as the relevant timeframe for European history.  Therefore, the early medieval age is the most appropriate answer.

While the Templar era *occurred* within the 12th and 13th centuries, the question asks about the *age* in which it peaked. The 12th and 13th centuries fall within the early to high medieval period.  Option C, ""mul madhyakaaleena yugaya"" (early medieval age), is the best fit, as the Templar era is generally considered to have reached its height during that period.
"
templarwarunge yugayen pasu paeminiye kumana yugayada?,"The correct answer is **D: 11 wana shathawarshaya**

Here's why:

* **The provided text states:** ""mema siduvim sidu woo kaalaya saamanyayen yuropiya ithihasaye ihala madyakalina avadhiye 11, 12 saha 13 satavarsa washayen saelake (kri.wa. 1000-1300).""  This translates to: ""Generally speaking, in European history, the Middle Ages spanned the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300).""
* **The question asks:** ""templarwarunge yugayen pasu paeminiye kumana yugayada?"" which means ""What period came after the Templar period?"" (The text implies Templars were a part of the Middle Ages).
* **The text also states:**  ""...pawathee madyakalina yugayat pawathee."" which means ""...later Middle Ages.""

Therefore, the Templar period falls within the 11th, 12th and 13th centuries, and the period *after* the Templar period is the 12th and 13th centuries, or more specifically, **11 wana shathawarshaya (11th century)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Shalya vaidyavarunta poppy aetavalin ganna morphene saha harben aetavalin ganna scopolomin aetulu wedananashaka sambandhava daenumak tibini. Rogeen thuwala odu diweema menma le gala yaama walakana tiringa saha dhamani kalampavalin rudhiraya gala ema walakwa gaenimata pasuwa ovun amgachedanaye pravinayan bavata pathwi ya.""

Translation: ""Surgeons used morphine and hyoscine (scopolamine) for pain relief. After drawing blood with veins and stopping bleeding from the wounds of the sick, they began to find a way to cure them.""

This directly links drawing blood (vein and stopping bleeding) to the beginning of treatment.  The other options are either too general (A), focus on a specific drug (B), or describe a later stage of treatment (D).  Option C is the most accurate reflection of the initial medical practice described in the passage.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""yuddhayen ikbitiva bhavitha kireema sandaha palamu romanu vaidya balakaaya pava pihituvana ladi"" which translates to ""in order to be able to conquer with war, the Roman medical knowledge was fought to be hidden."" 

This clearly indicates that hiding medical knowledge was a key strategy employed by the Romans during their empire. The other options are related to aspects of Roman history but not directly connected to the question of how medical knowledge was advanced *within* the Roman Empire itself.

daekeeme haekiyaawa kumak matha randa pawatheeda?,"The correct answer is **C: aethaem tharanga aayaama sanwedeethawa (electromagnetic wave range sensitivity)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph describes how living beings perceive the world through different sensory organs.** It specifically mentions the importance of being able to detect a wide range of electromagnetic waves (venas tharanga).  It talks about the necessity of detecting different wavelengths, some subtle and some intense.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: drushya paddhathiye sanwedaka indreeyan (visual system's sensory organ):** While vision is a form of sensing, the paragraph discusses a broader spectrum than just visual perception.
* **B: jiwiyekuge awashyatha (the necessity of a living being):**  This is too general. The paragraph is focusing on *how* living beings perceive, not just *why* it's necessary.
* **D: wiwidha theewratha mattam (various intensity levels):** While the paragraph mentions intensity, it's the *range* of electromagnetic waves that's the core point.

Therefore, option C directly reflects the main idea of the paragraph regarding sensory perception of electromagnetic waves.
"
jivin athara ak‍shi wyuhaye witachalanaya randa pawathinne kumak mathada?,"The correct answer is **A: tharanga aayaama sanwedeethawa (wave amplitude perception)**.

Here's why:

* The first paragraph discusses how visual perception (drushya panjara sanvedana) works and how various wavelengths (tharanga) are detected by the retina. It mentions the importance of detecting different wavelengths for various visual tasks.
* The question asks what is crucial for the movement of the eye (ak‍shi wyuhaye witachalanaya). 
* The paragraph directly links the ability to detect wavelength *amplitude* (tharanga aayaama sanwedeethawa) as essential for eye movement.  The eye needs to track changes in light intensity and direction, which are related to the amplitude of the light waves.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: jivinge awashyatha (the necessity of life):**  While vital, this is a very broad concept and not directly linked to eye movement.
* **C: theewratha mattama (only sharpness):**  Sharpness is one aspect of vision, but not the primary driver of eye movement.
* **D: jivinge sankeernathwaya (the complexity of life):** This is too general and not related to the mechanics of eye movement.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, aagama niwaerediwa nirupanaya nokarana seek dhahama pilibanda wu p‍rakaashaya wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: guru yanu seek aagamata aawenika wu mulika angayaki**

Here's why:

The text states that the Sikh religion is a distinct faith that emerged from India during the 15th century, influenced by Hinduism but with its own unique characteristics.  It specifically mentions that the Sikh faith's core principles are derived from the teachings of the Gurus, particularly Guru Nanak (1469-1539).  The text emphasizes that the Guru's teachings, expressed in Punjabi (""Guruge Mata""), are fundamental to Sikh beliefs and are rooted in the spiritual truths of the Sikh faith.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: seek dhahama yanu hindu samp‍radaye nikaayavadee bedeemwala p‍rathiphalayaki** -  The text clearly states Sikhism is *not* simply a branch or sect of Hinduism.  It highlights Sikhism's distinct identity.
* **C: mema aagame nirmathru guru nanakgen pasuwa gurun nawa denek ohuwa anugamanaya kalaha** - While Guru Nanak is crucial, the text doesn't focus on a succession of gurus *after* him.  It emphasizes the *foundation* of Sikhism in Guru Nanak's teachings.
* **D: seek dhahame aethaem samp‍radayan hindu dhahame mul baesa aetha** - The text *contradicts* this. It states that while influenced by Hinduism, Sikhism has its own distinct core principles.

"mema chedayata anuwa, seek wishvasaye mulika angaya lesa salakanu labanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: wenath indiyaanu aagam piligaeneema p‍rathik‍shepa kirima** (The resistance to the Indian religious influences).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sikvaru thama hindu moola ha sampradhaayaval piligattada, ovunge dahama hindu dahamata venas dahamak lesa salakati."" This translates to ""Sikhs followed Hindu roots and traditions, their religion was somewhat affected by Hinduism.""  The passage then goes on to say that the core characteristic of Sikhism is its resistance to these Indian influences and its establishment of its own distinct beliefs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: guru sankalpaya (Guru's resolve):** While the Guru's resolve is important, the passage focuses on the *reason* for the distinctiveness of Sikhism, which is its rejection of Indian influences.
* **B: hindu samp‍radayan (Hindu tradition):**  The passage acknowledges the influence of Hinduism, but it's the *resistance* to that influence that is highlighted as a core characteristic.
* **D: panjabi bhashawa katha kirima (Speaking in Punjabi):** Speaking in Punjabi is a cultural aspect, but not the primary reason for Sikhism's distinct religious identity. The language is used to convey the Guru's teachings, but the *content* of those teachings is what makes Sikhism different.



Therefore, **C** accurately reflects the core characteristic of Sikhism as presented in the passage – its resistance to the dominant Indian religious influences."
"mema chedayata anuwa, awadhaana oonatha aabadhaya sahitha daruwanta awadhaanaya yomu kirimata apahasu wiya haekke kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **B: k‍reeda kirima**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ADD sahitha daruvanta paasal waeda waeni de wetha avadhaanaya yomu kireema apahasu wana namuth, **kreeda kireema how ovunge priyathama cartoon naerabima how virama luckshana nomaetiva waakya liweema wani ovun kaemati de kirimata avadhaanaya yomu kirimata haeki ya.**""

This translates to: ""Besides reading passages, there are ways to encourage attention in children with ADD, such as **playing games or watching their favorite cartoons with positive characteristics or motivational phrases, and encouraging them to focus on what they are doing.**""

The passage emphasizes games and cartoons as methods to improve attention in children with ADD. Therefore, option B is the most accurate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pasal vaeda (reading passages):** While mentioned as one method, the passage focuses more on active engagement like games and cartoons.
* **C: kaatoon naerabima (watching cartoons):**  While mentioned, it's framed *with positive characteristics and motivational phrases*, suggesting it's not just passive viewing.  ""Kreeda kirima"" encompasses more active engagement.
* **D: owun winodayen karana dewal (things done for fun):** This is too broad.  The passage focuses on specific activities like games and cartoons that have a demonstrated impact on attention.

Here's why:

The passage highlights that children with ADD often struggle with social interactions and may feel excluded.  It suggests that fostering connections with peers of the same age can help improve their attention span and reduce negative behaviors.  The passage specifically mentions that they may not get typical stimulation from their own families and therefore seek it from others. Option B directly addresses this need for peer interaction.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: adhi kreeyaakaareethwaya adu kirimata (Avoiding overstimulation)** - While managing overstimulation is important, it's not the primary solution to social difficulties.
* **C: owunge demawpiyangen awadhaanaya labaa gaeneemata (Getting attention from their parents)** - While parental attention is valuable, the passage indicates that children with ADD may not get sufficient stimulation from their parents.
* **D: owunge molaya uththejanaya kirimata (Stimulating their interests)** -  Stimulating interests is helpful, but it doesn't directly address the core social challenges described in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The text describes a system that helps people learn new things, specifically programming.** It mentions that this system provides ""nava pariganaka vaedasatahanak"" (new programming tutorials) and ""nava vyaaprtiyak aarambha kireema waeni"" (starting new projects).
* **The question asks for an example of such a system.**
* **A beginner's guide to programming directly aligns with the description of a system designed to help people start learning programming.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: SAT upadeshakayek (SAT tutor):** While SAT tutors help people learn, the text focuses specifically on *programming*.
* **C: svadheena adhyayana vaedasatahanak (Independent study tutorials):** This is a broader concept. The text describes a *specific* system that provides a structured learning path for programming.
* **D: podi leeg puhunukaruwek (Small league players):** This is completely unrelated to the topic of programming education.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes that ""nava igenume kramayak nova nava pariganaka vaedasatahanak bhavitha kireema ho nava vyaaprtiyak aarambha kireema waeni nava igenum athdaekimak labana ayata sahaya labaa dene aadharayak pamani.""** This translates to: ""It serves as a basis for providing support for obtaining a new venture's initial investment for the beginning of a new cycle of new calculations for a new expansion, and for obtaining a new initial investment.""

* This directly links palanchiya (the plan) to providing initial support for starting the new venture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: palanchiya athathya lesa paewathiya haekiya (Palanchiya is slightly flexible):**  While palanchiya might have some flexibility, the core purpose as described is support for initial investment.
* **B: eya igenum k‍ramayakata wada aadhaarayaki (It is based on the new cycle):**  Palanchiya is *for* the new cycle and expansion, it's not *based on* it in the sense of a foundation.
* **C: eya wyaapruthi padanam karagath igeneema lesa da haendinwe (It is easily considered a new venture's initial investment):** The text says palanchiya *serves as a basis* for that consideration, it doesn't say it *is* the initial investment.



Therefore, option D accurately reflects the text's meaning about palanchiya's role in providing initial support."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kiyavime apahasuthawayak aethi sisunta kumana MySpace wisheshangaya p‍rayojanawath wiya haekida?","The correct answer is **A: risikaranaya (censorship)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how MySpace allowed users to type and post content, but also had the ability to censor content, specifically mentioning the removal of words or phrases deemed inappropriate or risky. The passage states this censorship could be done by a committee. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bloga (blog):** While MySpace did have blog features, the passage doesn't highlight this as a *unique* or *important* aspect related to the censorship capabilities.
* **C: ek web lipinayak (a web page):**  The passage mentions web pages in general, but it's the censorship *of content on those pages* that's the key point.
* **D: paethikada miliyana 54 (54 million users):** The number of users is mentioned as a fact about MySpace's popularity, but it doesn't explain *how* censorship was implemented or why it was a key feature.

Here's why:

The text states that Kruschev, after initially being criticized by the Communist party for his opposition to the June 1956 Hungarian uprising and his disregard for Stalin's policies, shifted his approach. He actively promoted a new ideology, which included:

*   **Rehabilitation of victims of Stalinism:** This aligns with the idea of a ""new ideology"" that distanced itself from Stalin's methods.
*   **Emphasis on peaceful coexistence:** The text mentions Kruschev's focus on peaceful coexistence with the West, a significant departure from Stalin's confrontational stance.
*   **Focus on economic recovery:**  While Kruschev initially focused on military strength (like the tank deployment), his long-term strategy involved improving the economy, which contributed to his popularity and the rise of leaders like Gomulka.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: saamaya yali sthaapitha kirimata yudha taenki bhawitha kirima (Deploying tanks to establish socialism):** While the tank deployment happened, it was more of a reaction to unrest than a core element of a new ideology. It was also eventually withdrawn.
*   **C: vaetup kappaduwa vaedi kirima (Ending the Hungarian uprising):**  This was a direct consequence of Kruschev's initial stance and doesn't represent a shift in ideology.
*   **D: samahara aarthika illeem piligaeneema (Improving the overall economy):** Economic recovery was important, but it was a tool to bolster Kruschev's position, not the central idea of a new ideology.

Therefore, the promotion of a new ideology is the most comprehensive and accurate answer to the question of how Kruschev responded to the criticism surrounding the Hungarian uprising."

The passage states that the protests started because of a food shortage (aahara higayata) in June 1956.  This was the primary reason for the unrest and the subsequent challenges to Khrushchev's leadership.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: komiynistvadaya (communism):** While communism was the political system in place, the *immediate* cause was the food shortage, not a general opposition to communism.
* **C: vaetup kappaduwa (housing shortage):** The passage mentions housing shortage (vaetup kappaduwa) as part of the issues, but the *primary* catalyst for the protests was the food shortage.
* **D: wlaedislaw gomulkaa path kirima (Vladislav Gomulka's rise to power):** Gomulka's rise is mentioned as a *consequence* of the protests, not the cause.

Here's why:

The provided text states that after WWII, the USSR and the USA worked together to establish systems, protocols, and cultural developments for rebuilding countries. This indicates a period of mutual cooperation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: sanskruthika wenaskam (Cultural exchange):** While cultural exchange likely occurred, the text emphasizes broader cooperation in rebuilding after the war.
* **B: germaniya pilibanda adhas (Regarding Germany):**  The text mentions Germany's division, but the core focus isn't specifically on Germany.
* **D: paddhathi pilibanda aarawul (Regarding system protocols):**  While systems and protocols were established, the text highlights the broader context of cooperation *leading* to these developments, not just the protocols themselves.

Therefore, **mutual cooperation** best captures the nature of the initial relationship described in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The first statement (P)** describes the importance of blood circulation (rudhira gamanaagamanaya) for the body's overall health and function.  It highlights its role in providing nourishment and removing waste.

* **The second question (Q)** asks how the entire body's muscle activity (snayu aavegayan) is maintained.  

* **Option B (Maintaining blood circulation)** directly addresses this.  Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to muscles and removes waste products.  Without proper blood circulation, muscles cannot function effectively, and the entire body's activity suffers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: rudhira gamanagamanaya mandgamee vima (Reduced blood circulation)** - This is the opposite of what's needed for maintaining muscle activity. Reduced circulation would *impair* muscle function.
* **C: samasthithiya nisi lesa pawathvagena yaama (Staying in a slightly still position)** - While staying still might *reduce* the need for muscle activity, it doesn't explain how the *entire* body's muscle activity is maintained.
* **D: siduwiya haeki shareerika tharjana walakva gaeneema (Protecting vital bodily organs)** - While blood circulation *contributes* to protecting vital organs, it's not the primary mechanism for maintaining overall muscle activity.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and accurate answer."
geesa maha pirameedayehi soyaagatha haekke kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: sohon**.

The text states: ""Misaraye maranaye nimnaya thula aethi geesa saanuva hevat """"geesa susaana bhumiya"""" matha piramida (ein visaalatama wanne mahaa piramidayai) kihipayak, kudaa sohon bim kihipayak, pudabim kihipayak saha sphinx pihitaa thibe.""

This translates to: ""In Egypt, in the realm of death, there is a pyramid called the ""Giza Sanaa Bhumiya"" (a very large pyramid), and a smaller pyramid, a subsidiary pyramid, and the Sphinx are hidden.""

Therefore, ""sohon bim"" (smaller pyramid) is one of the things found at the Giza pyramids.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: pansal** -  This is a Buddhist prayer hall and has no relevance to the text.
*   **C: siyaluma puduma 7** - This translates to ""all 7 new"", which doesn't fit the context of what's found *at* the pyramids.
*   **D: maha pirameedaya** - This translates to ""the great pyramid"", which is the overall structure, not specifically *what* is located *within* it.



"
maha pirameedaye aramuna wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: parawo hata gawrawa kirima (honoring the pharaohs)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Maha piramidaya thanana ladde paravo khufuta gavravayak washayen wana athara, anek kudaa piramida, sohon bim saha pudabim thanana ladde khufuge birindaevarun saha pavule samaajikayinta gavravaya pudha kirimatayi."" This translates to: ""The construction of the Great Pyramid was undertaken to honor the pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, subsidiary temples, and causeways were built in the area to honor Khufu's family and the social standing of his officials.""

The text focuses on the pyramids being built *to honor the pharaohs*.  The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **A: lokaye puduma hathen ekak bawata pathvima (being the tallest structure in the world):** While it *is* the tallest, the text's primary focus isn't simply on its height.
*   **C: bim salakunak lesa thibeema (having a slight inclination of the sides):** The text doesn't mention any inclination of the sides.
*   **D: miyagiya ayage sohon gabada kirima sandaha (related to the construction of his subsidiary tomb):**  While there *are* subsidiary tombs and causeways, the text emphasizes honoring the pharaohs, not just the construction of their tombs.



"
dewamaligawa gini thabaa winasha kala bhatayaa gaena apa daenuwath vimata hethu wuye yuththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: maha aeleksaendar raju**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""maha aeleksaendar ipadunu rathriye ma devamaligava vinaasha viya."" (Great Alexander destroyed the temple at night.)  and later ""...pasuwa, aeleksaendar miya giya pasu, kri.poo. 323 dee palliya nawatha godanagana ladi."" (After Alexander left, in 323 BC, he fought the godanaga in the valley). This directly links Alexander to the destruction of the temple.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: epeesiyaanuwan (Ephesians):** The passage mentions the Ephesians complaining to Herostratus, but it doesn't say they were responsible for destroying the temple.
* **C: strabo:** Strabo is only mentioned as having recorded the story later. He didn't destroy the temple.
* **D: aatemis:**  Atemis is mentioned as a deity whose temple was destroyed. However, the passage states that Alexander destroyed the temple, not Atemis directly.

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""Pasuwa, aeleksaendar miya giya pasu, kri.poo. 323 dee palliya nawatha godanagana ladi.""  This translates to ""After Alexander died, in 323 BC, he fought against the new rulers of the Palliya kingdom.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maha aeleksaendar wisin naewatha godanaegeema sandaha mudal gewanu laebeeya:** While the text mentions Alexander, it doesn't say he *first* learned about the new rulers' actions.  The text implies he acted *against* them.
* **C: naewatha godanaegeeme pirivaeya piyava gaeneema sandaha herostratasta niyoga karana ladee:** The text states Herostratus destroyed the Temple of Artemis out of vanity. It doesn't mention him being employed to *cause* the destruction.
* **D: eya kristhu purwa 320 dee naewatha godanagana ladee:** The text explicitly states the battle occurred in 323 BC.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sahelaentropes vasara miliyana sathakata pere depayin aevidinnata aethi namuth, vasara miliyana 4.2 - 3.9 dakvaa kaalayakata pere ostrolopithekas posilawalin soyaganu labuye depa bhaavithaye visheshatha wei.""

This translates to: ""Although *Sahelanthropus* existed 7 million years ago, it is particularly noteworthy that fossil remains of *Australopithecus* were found between 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago.""

The question asks about the time when the ""jivi wisheshayak kakul dekin aewida giya mulma awasthaawa"" (the earliest stage of the specific living being) occurred. The passage highlights that the appearance of *Australopithecus* fossils between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago is significant. Since the question implies a timeframe around the emergence of a particular species, and *Australopithecus* is mentioned as a crucial development within that timeframe, 3.9 million years ago is the most relevant and accurate answer based on the provided information. The passage focuses on the timeframe around the emergence of Australopithecus, and 3.9 million years ago falls within that timeframe.

"
boho wita paada deken aewidinne mema wishesha athurin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: homo erectos**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Homo erectus (depayin sitagat minisa yana arthaya) mathu weemath samaga minissu aevidimata patan gathha."" This directly translates to ""Homo erectus (meaning upright man) emerged and accompanied humans in the migration."" This indicates Homo erectus is the species that became bipedal (walked on two legs).
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **Sahalanthropus:** While mentioned, the passage says they existed millions of years before Homo erectus and their bipedalism is less certain.
    * **Dwipaada wisheshee jivin (bipedal living being):** This is a general description, not a specific species.
    * **Australopithecus:** The passage notes that their skeletal remains are distinct from Homo erectus.

Therefore, the passage explicitly identifies **Homo erectus** as the species that became bipedal and migrated."

Mythrare paakshikayan asamath vuvanaam, germaniyata yuropaye ithiri kotasa yatath karagat aakarayatama brithaanyaya yatath kara gaenimata ida tibuni."" This translates to: ""Furthermore, German sailors, mainly using U-boats, were eager to disrupt the supply route to Britain.  The strategic aim was to cut off Britain's access to supplies and goods.""

The passage also mentions that the U-boats targeted the Atlantic to stop the flow of supplies and goods from America to Britain. Therefore, the German sailors were eager to disrupt the supply route *to Britain*. Option B accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: b‍rithanyayen ena bhaanda walata badhaa kirima** (Disrupting the flow of goods entering Britain): While disrupting supply routes *to* Britain was a goal, the passage focuses on disrupting supply routes *to* Britain, not goods *entering* Britain.
* **C: athlanthik sagaraya haraha drawya p‍ravahanaya kirima** (Disrupting the flow of goods in the Atlantic): Disrupting the flow in the Atlantic was a *method* to achieve the goal of supplying Britain. The goal wasn't just to disrupt the flow in the Atlantic.
* **D: aemarikaawata minisun saha bhaanda ema vaelaekvima** (Supplying America with supplies and goods): This is the opposite of what the German sailors were doing. They were trying to *stop* supplies from reaching Britain.

This section highlights that Britain and America significantly increased their naval power in the Atlantic, aiming to control sea lanes and trade routes. This was a direct response to German naval ambitions and a strategic move to counter German dominance in the Atlantic.  Therefore, Britain and America were the key players in expanding naval strength in the Atlantic.

aesiriyaanuwan ashvarohaka hamuda kriyaathmaka kala wita meyin nothibune kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: saedala**.

The passage states: ""Ovunge maarantika haras dunu valin ena ithala valata prathivaadi soldaaduvange sannaahayata vinivida yaa haekiya. kri poo 1000 k pamana asiriyanuvan visin palamu asvaarohaka hamudaava handunvaa dene ladi.

This translates roughly to: ""Their warriors, who would give a terrible shout, used spears and shields to attack their opponents. Before the year 1000 BCE, the Assyrians fought with chariots, which were considered the vehicles of their royal power. They would not use the 'saedala' (a type of chariot platform/seat) in battle.""

Therefore, the Assyrians did *not* use the 'saedala' when fighting with chariots.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: haras dunu** (terrible shout):  The passage says they *did* use terrible shouts.
* **C: ashwa ratha** (chariot): The passage states they *did* use chariots.
* **D: sannaha** (spear): The passage mentions they *did* use spears.



"
ashvarohaka hamudawak bhawitha karana satan waladee satan karanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **C: ashwayinge pita matha sita** (from the horse's father's side).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Asvaarohaka hamudaavak yanu asvayange pita matha sita satan karana hamudaavaki.""  This translates to ""A horse-riding warrior is a warrior who performs the ritual of sacrifice from the horse's father's side.""

Therefore, the ritual to become a horse-riding warrior is performed on the father's side of the horse's lineage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: depa matha** (from the mother's side): The text specifically mentions the *father's* side.
*   **B: sannaha nomaethiwa** (with a small offering): While offerings are likely involved, the text doesn't specify a *small* offering. It refers to the ritual itself.
*   **D: adu bhatayin samaga** (with a sacrificial offering):  While sacrificial offerings are related, the text specifies the *father's side* as the key element in performing the ritual.

Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the text.

"mema chedayata anuwa, saaman‍ya babiloneeya puravaesiyeku soyaa gaeneemata obata nohaeki wanne kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **A: devala anganayata puja raegena ema (participating in worship at the devalaya courtyard)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the importance of participating in worship at the devalaya courtyard.** It mentions that the priest and devotees enthusiastically follow the rituals and festivals.  This suggests that attending worship in the courtyard was a core activity.
* **Option B** focuses on being part of the main temple festival. While important, the text doesn't explicitly highlight that as a defining characteristic of a typical Babylonian citizen's involvement.
* **Option C** focuses on being the devalaya anganayaka (courtyard leader). This is a specific role, not the experience of a typical citizen.
* **Option D** focuses on worshiping at the inner sanctum. This is likely restricted to priests or special individuals, not the general populace.

Therefore, option A best reflects the most common experience described in the text for a typical Babylonian citizen."
pujakayan sandaha wishesha yana lesa adhas kale pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: uthsawa (festival)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Minisun deviyan venuven pudapujaa genena athara, pujakavaru pujaa vidhi saha **uthsava haraha** deviyange awashyathaa sapirimata uthsaaha kalaha.""

This translates to: ""After performing new worship of Minisun deities, the priest's enthusiasm for the necessity of the deity is increased by the **festival** and worship rituals.""

Therefore, the text directly links the festival (""uthsava"") to the priest's enthusiasm. The other options aren't directly mentioned as aspects related to the priest's special role.
"
tootankhaamun raju yam keerthiyak labaa gaththe kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: ohuge sohona soyaa gaeneemen pasu** (After the discovery of his tomb).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Kese vethath, 1922 dee ohuge sohon geya soyaagaenimat samaga ohu janapriya vuveya"" which translates to ""However, in 1922, along with the discovery of his tomb, he became famous.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuge sohona mankollakaemen pasuwa** (After his death) - While he's remembered *after* his death, the text focuses on the *discovery of his tomb* being the key event in his fame.
* **B: ohuge palana kaalaye dee** (During his reign) - The text doesn't mention anything specific about his reign that led to his fame.
* **D: purana rajawarunge laeyisthuwe sandahan kirimen pasuwa** (After studying ancient rulers) - The text doesn't mention that his fame came from studying other rulers.



"
tootankhaamun raju sup‍rasiddha eejipthu rajeku bawata path kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: ohuge sohonen kavuthuka wasthu dhas gananak sora gaeneema**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""atitaye boho sohon geval kollakaa thibu namuth mema sohon geyata sabawinma haani nowee tibini. Vatinaa lohavalin saha durlabha gal vargavalin thaenu kautuka bandha dahas gananakda aetuluva, tutankaaman samaga waelaluu baandawalin bohomayak itha hondin sanrakshanaya wee aetha.""

Translation: ""Later, although many treasures might have been there, this treasure remained unharmed. In it were various curious objects made of metals and rare stones, and Tutankhamun's sarcophagus along with many other treasures were well preserved.""

This indicates that Tutankhamun's fame and recognition arose from the discovery of his *treasure* - specifically the ""curious objects made of metals and rare stones"" and his well-preserved sarcophagus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kisima haaniyak nowu ohuge sohon geya soyaa gaeneema** (The discovery of his tomb remained unharmed): While true, this doesn't explain *how* he became famous.
* **B: purana raja laeyisthuwe ohuge thaththwaya** (The old king's religious beliefs): The text doesn't mention anything about Tutankhamun's religious beliefs.
* **D: purana eejipthu yugaye ohuge vaedgathkama** (The old Egyptian era's medicine): The text doesn't discuss Egyptian medicine.



"
greeka kawiyeku wana homarta kala nohaeki wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: katha kirima** (storytelling).

Here's why:

The passage states that Homer is famous for his poems *Iliad* and *Odyssey*.  While Homer was a poet, the question asks what *else* Greek poets were known for.  The options relate to different artistic expressions. While poetry is a core part of Greek culture, the question is implying something beyond just poetry.  Storytelling was a crucial part of Greek culture alongside poetry, particularly in the oral tradition before writing became widespread. The passage mentions plays by Sophocles and Aristophanes, further implying that dramatic storytelling was significant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aeseema, B: daekeema, C: aewideema:** These options do not appear to be related to Greek culture or artistic endeavors.
*   **D: katha kirima (storytelling):**  This is the best fit, as storytelling was integral to Greek culture alongside poetry and drama.
"
saahith‍yaya haera wenath deyak sandaha p‍rasiddha greeka jaathikayaa kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: sofoklis** and **D: aeristofnas**.

The text states: ""Sophocles saha Aeristophanis da evakata Janapriya naatya racakayan woo athara ovunge naatya, loka sahithyaye anarghathama nirmana athara lae saelake."" This translates to ""Sophocles and Aristophanes were popular playwrights and their plays are among the most important achievements in world literature.""

While Homer is mentioned as an influential figure, the question asks about a *literary* figure. Pythagoras is known for his mathematical theorem, not literature.

Therefore, both Sophocles and Aristophanes are correct answers. However, since only one option can be chosen, and the question implies a singular, best answer, **Sofoklis (Sophocles)** is a slightly better choice because he is explicitly mentioned first in the relevant sentence and is a more consistently celebrated playwright compared to Aristophanes.  But both are valid answers based on the text.
"
yudew pawula owunge kaalayen vaedi kaalayak gatha kale koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: elimahane**.

The passage states: ""Gahaenun midulehi ivum pihum katayutu kalaha; alevisael maargaya desata yomu woo vivurta kavulu pamanak viya. nivasa godanaegeemata gal yodaganna ladi. Kanan bhumiye vishaala wanaanthara notibu baevin, daewawala mila ithaamath adhika viya."" This translates to ""In the meantime, there was a great struggle with the people; the way of Alevisael was shown, and the stone was laid for the foundation of the dwelling. The land was not as vast as the endless expanse, nor were the gods as great as the Lord.""

The question asks where Paul told a story about his past. The passage explicitly says he told the story in ""elimahane"" (the great struggle/conflict/arena/field). Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"
yudew pawulata etharam vaedgath nowu de kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: owunge deshagunaya (his/her/their characteristic/nature)**.

Here's why:

* The first paragraph describes a person (Madaperadiga) who is described as having undesirable qualities (""madaperadiga unusum desagunaya"").  The question asks what is now needed from that person's ""yudew pawulata etharam vaedgath nowu de kumakda?"" which translates to ""what is needed from his/her/their characteristic/nature?"" 
* The paragraph states that a new purpose is needed for the person's existing characteristics. 
* Therefore, the answer is their characteristic/nature (deshagunaya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: owunge alewisael (his/her/their wisdom/knowledge):** While wisdom might be a characteristic, the paragraph focuses on overall undesirable traits, not specifically wisdom.
* **C: owunge niwes (his/her/their dwelling):**  This refers to their home, which isn't the core of what is needed to change their purpose.
* **D: owunge iwum pihum (his/her/their arrogance/pride):** Arrogance or pride might be one of the characteristics, but the question is broader and asks about the overall need for change in their *nature*.



"
skaendinewiyaanu ratawal athara wenasak lesa wisthara kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: ithihasaya (History)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...denmarkaya, svidanaya, norve saha ayislanthaye janathaavaava, rajawarun, sirith virit saha ithihaasaya athara boho venaskam paewathuni.""  This translates to ""...of the people, kings, traditions and **history** a lot of knowledge is gained.""

While the text mentions other aspects (people, traditions, geography), it emphasizes that history is a key area of study related to Scandinavian countries.  The question asks for what the text highlights as a focus of knowledge about Scandinavia, and history is directly named.
"
mulinma greenlanthaye padinchi wuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: eskeemo gothra**.

The passage states: ""Namuth ohuge soyaa gaeneema kumak vuvat, eskimo gothra evitath ema kalaye ehi jivath vemin sitiyo ya."" which translates to ""However, the name Eskimo is also used for the people who lived in this region for a long time."" 

While the passage mentions Erik the Red and the Scandinavian people, it specifically connects the term ""Eskimo"" to the people who were there for a long time.
"
putu nomaethiwa aahara gaeneemata kaemathi wuye mona kandayamada?,"The correct answer is **D: duppath romanu kaanthawan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...pohosat minisun kaemaettak daekvuye bhojana sangraha pawathwamin ekata ekva paettata vaetiri aahara gaenimatai. **Duppath romanu kaanthawan** saha gahaenun aahara ganu labuwe putuvala indagena wana athara...""

This translates to: ""...that the poor people looked at and imitated the food collections that the wealthy Romans ate. **The poor Romans imitated the food of the wealthy ones**...""

Therefore, the passage indicates that the poor Romans (duppath romanu) imitated the wealthy Romans' (kaanthawan) food.
"
purana roma mangal‍yayaka kotasak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarakda?,"The correct answer is **C: dhanawath minisun aahara ganna atharathura bima vaethira siteema** (Wealthy people had the luxury to eat diverse foods).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Duppat minisun saha gahaenun aahara ganu labuwe putuvala indagena wana athara, pohosat minisun kaemaettak daekvuye bhojana sangraha pawathwamin ekata ekva paettata vaetiri aahara gaenimatai."" This translates to: ""In wealthy homes, they had access to a variety of foods, and the wealthy (elite) would gather and compete to have the most lavish feasts.""

This directly supports option C, indicating that the wealthy had the means to acquire and enjoy a wider range of foods. The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
"chedaya matha padanamwa, kalpawathna balapaemak aethi kala nohaekke pahatha daekwena ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: nagara-rajyayak (Nagara-Rajya)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the concept of ""Sivilayisesan"" (civilized people) and related terms (civil, civilis, civis, civitas) were adopted from Sanskrit and became associated with the idea of ""Nagara-Rajya"" (city-state/urban-state). The passage states that the ""Nagara-Rajya"" was an early form of societal organization.

The passage emphasizes the connection between societal development, cultural traditions, and the emergence of the city-state as a significant societal model. Therefore, the answer that best reflects the central theme of the passage is ""Nagara-Rajya.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: samajayak (Society):** While the passage discusses society, ""Nagara-Rajya"" is the specific societal *model* being highlighted.
*   **B: sulu sanskruthiyak (Sulu Culture/High Culture):** The passage mentions ""sulu sanskruthiyak"" (high culture) but positions it *within the context* of the ""Nagara-Rajya"" and its development. High culture is a component of a larger societal organization.
*   **D: shishtachaara sanskrutiyak (Shishtachara Culture/Culture of Etiquette):** The passage discusses ""shishtachara sanskrutiyak"" (culture of etiquette) but it’s a part of the larger ""Nagara-Rajya"" society, not the defining factor.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, jathiyakata purwaga wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: shishtachaara sanskruthiyak (Shishtachara Sanskrithiyaka)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes ""Sistaacharayak"" (shishtachara) as a significant element of ancient Sri Lankan society, influencing culture and social norms.  It emphasizes the importance of tradition and its widespread practice.
* The question asks what was prevalent *before* the city-state (Nagara Rajya). The passage states that the Sistaachara Sanskrithi (customary culture/tradition) was prevalent before the emergence of city-states.
* The passage specifically mentions that the city-state (Nagara Rajya) arose later, building upon existing customs and traditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ekeeya sanskruthiyak (a unique culture):** While Sistaachara Sanskruthiyak is unique, the question asks what was prevalent *before* the city-state, not a general description of the culture itself.
* **C: nagara-rajyayak (city-state):** The city-state is what *emerged later*, not what was prevalent beforehand.
* **D: sulu sanskrutheen (golden culture):** The passage doesn't use the term ""golden culture"" or associate it with the period before the city-state.  It focuses on the influence of tradition and customs.



Therefore, **Shishtachaara Sanskruthiyak** is the accurate answer because the passage directly connects it to the period preceding the city-state."
drukgiyaal song pilibanda sath‍ya nowanne kumana p‍rakaashaya da?,"The correct answer is **A: eya idikarana ladde tibet-mongoliyaanu hamudawange jayagrahanaya saemareema sandahayi** (It was built to commemorate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian invasion).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""1649 dee, tibet-mongoliyaanu hamudaavalata viruddhava kala satanin thaman lath jayagrahanaya samarima pinisa..."" (In 1649, it was built to commemorate the victory over the Tibetan-Mongolian invasion).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eya bhoothanaye pihita aetha** (It is hidden in Bhutan). The text mentions it's a significant religious site in Bhutan, not hidden.
* **C: ginnakin balakotuwe natabun bohomayak winasha wiya** (A large part of the monastery was destroyed during the invasion). The text mentions it was destroyed in 1951, not during the 1649 invasion.
* **D: eya nirmanaya kale sabdrung ngavaeng namjiyel wisini** (It was built by Sabdrung Ngavaen Namgyel). While Sabdrung Ngavaen Namgyel is mentioned as being associated with the monastery, the text highlights the purpose of its construction - to commemorate the victory.



"
drukgiyaal song ginnehi p‍rathiphalaya niwaerediwa wisthara karana p‍rakaashaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: ithiri wu ekama natabun wuye sabdrung ngavaeng namjiyelge rupayaki**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1649 dee, tibet-mongoliyaanu hamudaavalata viruddhava kala satanin thaman lath jayagrahanaya samarima pinisa, subbedrang navang namgyel balakotuva thaenu bhava paewase."" This translates to ""In 1649, during the war against the Tibet-Mongolian invasion, the Subdrung Namgyel Balakotuwa became a hero.""

Later, the passage mentions the Balakotuwa's subsequent role in protecting and preserving the monastery, making it a spiritual pinnacle of Bhutan.  The phrase ""ithiri wu ekama natabun wuye sabdrung ngavaeng namjiyelge rupayaki"" translates to ""the image of the Subdrung Namgyel, a great hero."" This directly links the monastery's rise to fame and reverence to the hero's image.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: tibet-mongoliyaanu hamudawan jayagrahanaya kalaha (The war against the Tibet-Mongolian invasion):** While the war was a significant event, the passage focuses on the *outcome* of that war and how it contributed to the monastery's later importance, not the war itself.
* **C: mema aakarshanaye janap‍riyathawayata kisidu balapaemak sidu vi nomaetha (It became a popular and revered place due to its spiritual power):** This is true, but option A specifically points to *how* it became popular – through the image of the hero.
* **D: eya sabdrung ngavaeng namjiyel sanrakshanaya kale ya (He protected the Subdrung Namgyel):** The passage states he protected the *monastery*, not himself.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer as it directly addresses the reason for the monastery's growing fame and reverence according to the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""18 wana siyavase avasan vasara kihipaya thula viyatnaamavarun da kaambojaya arkramena kalaha.""  This translates to ""In the final years of the 18th century, Vietnam waged war against Cambodia.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wiyatnama jaathikayan nom pen winasha kalaha (Vietnam was a destructive war):** While the passage mentions a war between Vietnam and Cambodia, it doesn't describe the war itself as ""destructive"".
* **B: 1772 dee kaambojaya thailanthaya aakramanaya kaleya (Cambodia's invasion of Thailand in 1772):** The passage mentions Cambodia's actions against Vietnam, not Thailand, and the timing isn't accurate (the invasion happened in 1772, but the passage refers to the *end* of the 18th century).
* **D: thayiwarun nom pen winasha kalaha (The Thai king was a destructive war):** The passage doesn't mention the Thai king or a war initiated by the Thai king.



"
kaambojaye aak‍ramanaya niwaerediwa wisthara karanne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: thai saha wiyatnama jaathikayan 1772 dee kaambojaya aak‍ramanaya kalaha**

Here's why:

* **The provided text states:** ""18 wana siyavase avasan vasara kihipaya thula viyatnaamavarun da kaambojaya arkramena kalaha.""  This translates to ""In the last year of the 18th century, Vietnam fought a war with the Kambojas.""
* **The text also mentions:** ""18 wana siyavasedi thaayivarun kihipa varakma kaambojaya arkramena kala athara 1772 dee nom pen nagaraya vinasha kara daemuvoya.""  This translates to ""In the 18th century, the Khmer (Thai) destroyed the city of Angkor in 1772.""

Therefore, the Thai and Vietnamese populations fought the Kambojas and the Khmer (Thai) destroyed Angkor. Option B accurately reflects the conflict between the Thai and Vietnamese and the destruction of Angkor by the Khmer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wiyatnam jaathikayan kihipa wathawakma kaambojaya aak‍ramanaya kalaha** -  Only states that the Vietnamese fought the Kambojas, not the Thai involvement.
* **C: wiyatnama jaathikayan nom pen winasha kalaha** - Incorrectly claims that only the Vietnamese fought and that the Khmer destroyed Angkor.
* **D: thaiwaru kihipa wathawakma kaambojaya aak‍ramanaya kalaha** - Only states that the Thais fought the Kambojas, not the Vietnamese involvement or the destruction of Angkor.



"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1624 dee, landesi naegenahira indiya samaagama, nirithadiga thaiwaanaye sthaapitha woo athara sahal saha seeni vathuyaayan thula waeda kirimata china kamkaruvan yodaa ganimin **svadesika daanya nispaadana kriyaamarga parivaarthaanayakata lak kaleya.**""

This translates to: ""In 1624, the landese naegenahira indiya samaagama, after establishing a fort in Taiwan, **focused on changing the indigenous grain production methods to benefit the Chinese workers.**""

Therefore, the establishment of indigenous grain production methods was a key initiative of the landese naegenahira indiya samaagama in Taiwan. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided.



"
shimonoseki giwisuma magin sthaapitha kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: palamu china-japan yuddhayedee japanaye parajaya**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""1895 dee, palamu china-japan yuddhayen (1894-1895) paraajaya weemen pasu, kwing rajaya shimonoseki sammuthiyata athsan thabana athara emagin ovun thaiwaanaye paalanaya japanayata pavara dene athara...""
* This directly translates to: ""In 1895, after suffering defeat in the Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty, according to the Shimonoseki treaty, ceded Taiwan's administration to Japan...""

Therefore, the Shimonoseki treaty established Japan's control over Taiwan *because* of China's defeat in the Sino-Japanese War.
"
rasayanika drawyayaka pH mattama maninu labanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **C: rasayanikaya thula aethi hayid‍rajan ayana p‍ramanaya matha**

Here's why:

* **pH** is a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) in a solution.  A higher concentration of H⁺ means a lower pH (more acidic). A lower concentration of H⁺ means a higher pH (more basic or alkaline).

* The passage states that the experiment measured the concentration of hydrogen ions (H⁺) using a specific amount of hydrogen.  pH is directly related to the number of hydrogen ions present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: rasayanikaya ketharam mulika ho aamlika da yanna matha** (The substance is acidic or alkaline) - While pH indicates acidity or alkalinity, the direct measurement is of H⁺ concentration.
* **B: rasayanikaya thula p‍rotona keeyak thibe da yanna matha** (The substance has a certain number of protons) - While protons and hydrogen ions are related, pH specifically measures the *ions*, not the protons themselves.  Also, not all protons in a molecule are necessarily contributing to the pH.
* **D: rasayanikaya thula ilektrona keeyak thibeda yanna matha** (The substance has a certain number of electrons) - pH has *no direct relationship* to the number of electrons.  Electrons are involved in bonding and electrical conductivity but not in determining the hydrogen ion concentration.



"
hayidrajan ayana walin iwath karana ladde kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: protona**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what hydrogen ions (H+) are made of.**
* **The provided text states: ""hayiderajan ayana yanu ein electrona ivath woo protona wei...""**  This translates to ""a hydrogen ion has one electron and **one proton**...""

Therefore, the fundamental component of a hydrogen ion is a proton.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is a measure of acidity or alkalinity, not the component of a hydrogen ion.
* **C: aelkalayin (alkaline):** Alkaline refers to a substance with a pH above 7, not the composition of a hydrogen ion.
* **D: ilektrona (electron):** While hydrogen ions *do* have electrons, the text specifically states they have one *proton* as well.  The question asks for *what* they are made of, and the proton is a more fundamental component in this context.



"
sinha ranchuwak niwaerediwa wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: pirimi-gaehaenu anupathaya samana nowe (The ratio of the pyramids and the land purchased was not the same.)**

Here's why:

The question describes a situation where a large ranch was established, and a certain number of pyramids were built. The owner, who is compared to a lion, lived a long life alongside them. The key is the comparison to the lions.  The text states the pyramids are as durable as the lions and will last as long as the lions.  However, the question implies the ranch wasn't expanded to a greater extent.

This suggests the limiting factor wasn't the owner's resources, but rather the **ratio of the land purchased to the number of pyramids built.**  If the land purchase wasn't proportional to the pyramids, it would explain why the ranch wasn't expanded further despite the pyramids' longevity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun balu raelakata samana widihata haesireyi (They lived with the same durability as the powerful lions.)** While the pyramids are said to have similar durability, this doesn't explain why the ranch wasn't expanded.
* **C: pirimi saha gaehaenu haemoma sameepa lesa sambandhayi (The pyramids and the land purchased are closely related.)** The text mentions purchasing land, but doesn't establish a direct link between the pyramid construction and the land purchase.
* **D: e dekama maranthika saha samajiyai (Both are related to longevity and society.)** This is too broad. While longevity and societal implications might be involved, it doesn't explain the ranch expansion issue.



Therefore, option B provides the most logical explanation based on the information given.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Ek vishaala pavulaka sahodariyan saha diyanivarun vemin gaehaenu sathun saamaanyayen ekinekata sameepa gnatitvayak darayi. Sinha prayids kriya karanne haesirimen pudhuma sahagata lesa sinhayinta samaana vurka ho sunakha raelakata samaana ayurin wana athara (namuth wenath vishaala balalun nove) emenma haesirime dee ovunge godurata itha maaraantika ya."" This translates to ""A large sister and a younger sibling went with the one who went to the pyre. Usually, they had a close relationship with each other. The one who performed the rites, along with the new one, was slightly like a lion in strength, but (even then) they had the same lifespan as the sister and the younger sibling, and even their health was remarkably good.""
* **The key point is the remarkable health and lifespan:** The passage emphasizes that despite being slightly strong like a lion, the people associated with the rites had a lifespan *equal to* the sister and younger sibling, and their health was *remarkably good*. This implies that the pyre (and the ritual connected to it) granted them extraordinary health and longevity, almost as if they had a connection to the deities (dewargayama).
* **Let's analyze the other options:**
    * **A: owun godak samajasheeleeyi (They are very kind):** While they might be kind, the passage doesn't directly state their kindness. The focus is on their health and lifespan.
    * **B: owunge haesireema wurkayange haesireemata samanayi (Their strength is equal to the strength of their work):** The passage contrasts their strength with a lion's strength, suggesting it's not directly tied to their work.
    * **D: owunge haesireema anekuth wishala balalunta samanayi (Their strength is equal to many great strengths):** The passage clarifies their strength is *like* a lion's, not ""many great strengths.""

Therefore, option C best captures the essence of the passage - the remarkable health and longevity linked to the pyre/rituals, suggesting a connection to the deities.



"
haawan yanu saaman‍yayen kumana aakaaraye dadayam sathunge godurak weda?,"The answer is **C: madhyama p‍ramanaye balalun** (medium-sized strength).

Here's why:

The text states: ""madyama pramaanaye goduru aahaarayata ganna, madyama pramaanaye balalun ya."" This translates to ""eat a medium amount of honey, drink a medium amount of milk.""  The question asks about the size of the honeycomb that a ""haawan"" (likely referring to a bee) creates. The text links the bee's honey consumption to a ""medium amount"" of milk, implying a corresponding medium-sized honeycomb.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kuda balalun** (small strength) - The text associates honey with a *medium* amount, not a small one.
*   **B: wishala balalun** (large strength) - The text associates honey with a *medium* amount, not a large one.
*   **D: aentilop** -  ""Aentilopayan"" refers to antilopes and is irrelevant to the question.



"
kuda balalun saaman‍yayen goduruta ganne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: meeyan**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Avasaana washayen krumin, meeyan, katussan, saha paksheen waeni kudaa goduru aahaarayata ganna...""  This translates to: ""In the final stage, meeyan, katussan, and birds eat small seeds...""

The question asks which of the options eats small seeds.  ""Meeyan"" (meeyan) is explicitly listed as one of the animals that eats small seeds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: haawan (elephant):** The text mentions elephants eat a moderate amount of vegetation, but not specifically small seeds.
* **C: aentilop (antelope):**  The text says antelopes eat a moderate amount of vegetation and are strong. It doesn't mention seeds.
* **D: muwan (monkey):** The text says monkeys eat a moderate amount of vegetation and are strong. It doesn't mention seeds.

The provided text states: ""Vidyagnayan visvaasa karanne amarikaanu balalun aahaaraya sandaha sathun (godura) soyaganne pasupasa hambaa gos ovunge gandhayen bhumiyehi ovun siti sthaanaya iven handunaagaeneemen bavayi.  aemerikaanu balalun ovunta raathri darshanaya sahitava andure itha hondin as penena athara ithaa rahasin hemin seeruwe aevidimatada haekiya. aemerikaanu balalun ovunge vatapitaava samaga muhu vemin ovunge goduru dadayam kara ovunge godura mathata pani.""

Translation: ""According to Vidyagnayan's belief, the American people cook their food (milk) with cow urine, and the smell of the cow's urine is spread on the ground where they live. The American people have a very good night vision and it is said that there is a secret in this. The American people also mix their milk with their vatapitaava and cook their milk with their urine, which is good for their health.""

The key phrase is ""athara ithaa rahasin hemin seeruwe aevidimatada haekiya"" -  ""there is a secret in this.""  The text continues to describe cooking milk with urine at night. Option C directly reflects this detail.

Let's examine why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owunge watapitawa thula saegavi siteema** (They put a certain amount of their milk in their vatapitaava).  While milk and vatapitaava are mentioned, the text doesn't provide information about a specific amount.
* **B: owunge godure suwanda hamba yaama** (They cook their milk with sunlight). The text mentions cooking with *urine*, not sunlight.
* **D: kuda p‍ramanaye sathun pamanak godurata gaeneema** (They add a certain amount of something to the urine). The text doesn't specify adding anything to the urine.

aemerikaanu balalun niwaerediwa wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda? ,"The correct answer is **A: owunta rath‍riye hondin dadayam kirimata haekiya** (They needed to be able to see well at night).

Here's why:

The passage states that the American people were deeply interested in the food of the indigenous people, especially the taste of their meat.  The key point is that the indigenous people used a special technique to preserve their meat, which involved drying it and then using the smoke from burning the animal's fat to preserve it further.  This smoke also apparently helped them see better at night.

Option A directly relates to this key detail. The passage implies the smoke was essential for nighttime vision. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
kotiyakuge wishalathama shakthiya lesa salakanu nolabanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarakda?,"The correct answer is **A: garjanaya (roar)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the lion's roar is so powerful it can be heard from a kilometer away and is a powerful statement. The question asks what ability is most likely responsible for this impressive range. The passage directly links the lion's roar to its power.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: naegeema (greeting)** - While lions may have vocalizations used for greeting, the passage focuses on the *power* of their sound, not its social function.
*   **C: paeneema (running)** -  The passage mentions their speed, but the roar is highlighted as their most impressive and impactful ability.
*   **D: aedeema (thinking/understanding)** - This is irrelevant to the physical characteristics described in the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kotin saha sinhayan athara wenasa kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: owunge aedeeme balaya (their majestic power)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the jaguar as possessing immense power and strength.** It states the jaguar's roar can be heard from four people away and is filled with commanding words. 
* **The question asks what would make the lion, tiger, and jaguar retreat.**  The answer must relate to the jaguar's dominant characteristic highlighted in the passage.
* **Option D, ""owunge aedeeme balaya"" (their majestic power), best fits this description.**  The idea of being intimidated by a powerful force aligns with the passage's description of the jaguar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owunge pihinum haekiyaawa (their claws):** While claws are part of a predator's arsenal, the passage doesn't emphasize them as the primary deterrent.
* **B: owunge garjanaye handa (in their roar):** While the roar is intimidating, the passage emphasizes the jaguar's overall strength and commanding presence more than just the sound.
* **C: owun panina dura (far away from people):**  This isn't about the jaguar's power; it's about distance.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, robat hook wenath jiwa widyaangayinta pera kale kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: pranawath jiwiyeku baeleemata anvik‍shayak bhawitha kirima** (Conducting an experiment on the behavior of living beings).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the need for experimentation on living beings to understand their behavior.** The first part of the passage discusses the difficulty of creating a purely strategic and cooperative entity (sailaya) and suggests that to understand living beings' behavior, one needs to conduct experiments with them. It mentions using the ""Robot Hook"" methodology for this purpose.
* **Option B directly reflects this central idea.**  It states the action of conducting an experiment on the behavior of living beings, which is what the passage highlights as the necessary approach.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: miya giya saila nireekshanaya kirima (Conducting past strategic observation):** While observation might be a part of understanding, the passage stresses the need for active experimentation, not just observation of past events.
* **C: kuda samachathuras‍ra nireekshanaya kirima (Conducting observation of small intelligence):** This is too narrow. The passage refers to *all* living beings, not just those with ""small intelligence.""
* **D: jiwiyekuge kudama kriyaakaaree ekaka soyaa gaeneema (Extracting the smallest active element of a living being):** This is a very specific and unlikely approach mentioned in the passage.  The focus is on understanding *behavior* through experimentation, not just extracting individual components.



"
“sailaya” yana wachanaye mularambhaya yannen adhas karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: kuda wyuhaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Praanavat (de) jiviyakuge kudaa ma vyuhaatmaka saha kruthyaatmaka ekakaya wanne sailayaki."" This translates to something like: ""Even in the lives of beings, it's possible to do a strategic and cooperative thing, which is 'sailaya'.""  This implies ""sailaya"" is related to strategy or a plan.
* **The question asks:** ""sailaya"" yana wachanaye mularambhaya yannen adhas karanne kumakda?"" which means ""What is the root of the word 'sailaya'?""
* **""Wyuhaya"" (wyuhaya)** means strategy, plan, or scheme.  Therefore, it's the most likely root based on the context.
* The other options don't fit the context:
    * **Kuda samachathurasra** (smart/intelligent) - While intelligence might be *part* of a strategy, it's not the root word.
    * **Kuda kaamaraya** (room/chamber) -  Has no connection to the context.
    * **Kuda bola** (big/large) -  Also has no connection to the context.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, boho sathunta kumak kirimata haekiyaawak thibeda?","The correct answer is **A: piyaasara kirimata (To swim)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""boho sathunta chalanaya weemata haeki ya"" which translates to ""many suns can move."" This implies they are capable of movement.
* **The text also says:** ""lowa puraa jivath we. ovuhu polova saaramin, samuduruvala pihinamin saha ahase igilemin sititi"" which translates to ""lived in ancient times. They lived in the ocean, in the forest, and in the sky."" This confirms they are aquatic creatures.
* **Therefore, the most logical action they can perform is swimming (piyaasara kirimata).**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: chalanaya vimata (To move):** While true, it's too general. Swimming is a specific type of movement related to their aquatic nature.
* **C: pihineemata (To hide):** The text doesn't indicate they hide; it focuses on their movement.
* **D: haereemata (To fly):** The text explicitly states they lived in the ocean and forest, not the sky, making flying unlikely.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, samahara sathunta nomaethi de kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: molaya** (molaya means ""shell"" or ""exoskeleton"").

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""boho sathunta chalanaya weemata haeki ya. Molayak aeththe sathunta pamani..."" which translates to ""many shells are needed for a crab to move. A shell is like a crab's armor.""

The question asks what is the crab's body covered in. The text directly answers that the crab is covered in a shell (molaya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: saila** (mountain) -  The text doesn't relate a crab to a mountain.
* **B: aahara jirna haekiyaawa** (food digestion) - The text mentions digestion but not as a covering on the crab.
* **D: aahara gaeneeme haekiyaawa** (food intake) - The text mentions eating but not as a covering on the crab.



"
p‍rabhasanshleshanaya atharathura shaka walata upakaara karanne kumakda?,"Correct answer: **D: suryayaa**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Shaaka magin minisun aasvasa karana oxygen nipadawana athara, eva minisun praasvasa karana (enam, pita karana) carbon daioxaide avasosanaya karayi."" This translates to: ""While plants breathe by inhaling carbon dioxide, they exhale oxygen.  Plants need sunlight for photosynthesis to produce food.""

Photosynthesis is the process where plants use sunlight to create their food (sathunta). Therefore, sunlight is essential for plants to grow and thrive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sewana (water):** While water is essential for plants, the passage highlights sunlight as the primary driver of food production.
*   **B: sathun (nutrients):** Nutrients are important, but sunlight is the energy source that allows plants to convert carbon dioxide and water into nutrients (food).
*   **C: aahara (food):** Plants produce food *because* of sunlight, but sunlight is the cause, not the benefit in this context. The question asks what *benefits* from photosynthesis.



"
shaka aashvasa karana minisun p‍rashvasa karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: kaaban dayoksayid (carbon dioxide)**.

The text states: ""Shaaka magin minisun aasvasa karana oxygen nipadawana athara, eva minisun praasvasa karana (enam, pita karana) carbon daioxaide avasosanaya karayi."" This translates to: ""While plants respire, they release oxygen, and while they breathe (i.e., during photosynthesis), they absorb carbon dioxide.""

Therefore, during respiration, plants *absorb* carbon dioxide.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, parinamaye kriyaawaliyata badhaa karanne pahatha daekwena udaharanawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: nawa parisarayak thula anuwarthanaya vimata haeda gaeswena gahanayak**.

Here's why:

The question asks for examples of things that would hinder the sequence of actions described in the initial paragraph. The initial paragraph outlines a process where someone moves to a new environment, builds wealth and connections, and eventually achieves a significant accomplishment after many years.

Option C directly addresses a potential hindrance: **the lack of proper communication/relationship building in the new environment**. The paragraph stresses the importance of establishing strong relationships (pere) with the new environment's key players (saktimat tharangakaruvek). If this communication and relationship-building is lacking (thula anuwarthanaya vimata haeda gaeswena gahanayak -  meaning ""a person who doesn't properly build relationships in a new environment""), it would significantly impede the subsequent steps towards success.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: kuda kandayamakata nawa sthaanayaka samruddhimath vimata apohosath vima** - This option describes a situation where the new leader is wealthy and successful, which *supports* the initial sequence, not hinders it.
* **B: ek gahanayakin kotasak nawa parisarayakata wen vi yaama** - Simply moving to a new environment is the *starting point* of the sequence, not a hindrance.
* **D: eka janagahanayak awasanaye dekak bawata path vima** -  This describes a person who is not doing well in the new environment; however, the text mentions building up wealth and connections. So, this is not a direct hindrance to the sequence, more like a side effect or outcome.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses a key element (relationship building) that is crucial for the success described in the paragraph and could easily hinder that process.



"
wisheshap‍rapthiya nam kriyaawaliya niwaerediwa wisthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin kawareda? ,"The correct answer is **B: meya parinameeya kriyaawaliye p‍radhaana angayaki** (This is the main element of the resultant action sequence).

Here's why:

The text describes a process where a new acquisition (new territory, new people) leads to a series of actions and consequences.  The *final* and *primary* outcome of this process is the achievement of a ""special attainment"" (visheshapraptiya). The text emphasizes that this attainment is not something that happens easily and requires a significant amount of time and effort. 

Option B directly points to this ""special attainment"" as the core result of the entire process.  The other options are less accurate:

* **A:** While lack of support prevents attainment, it's not the *main* element of the *resultant action sequence* itself.
* **C:**  The text describes the process *leading to* a new special attainment, not solely focusing on the act of creating a new special person.
* **D:**  The text explicitly states that the attainment *is* achievable, albeit with difficulty.



"
hardaya wasthuwa desata rudhiraya gena enne rudhira sansarana paddhathiye kumana kotasada?,"The correct answer is **A: dhamani (arteries)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that arteries (""dhamani"") carry blood *away* from the heart to the head (""shiraa"").  This describes the function of arteries in the circulatory system. The other options are incorrect:

*   **kesha naalika (capillaries):** These are tiny vessels, not the primary carriers of blood *away* from the heart.
*   **awayawa (organ):** This is too general. The passage specifies the organ involved in blood circulation.
*   **shiraa (veins):** Veins carry blood *towards* the heart, not away."
rudhira sansarana paddhathiye kudama nala monavada?,"The correct answer is **A: kesha naalika** (capillary tube).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""kudaama naala kesha naalika lesa haedin we."" This translates to ""small vessels called capillary tubes are also present."" Capillaries are the smallest blood vessels, connecting arteries and veins and allowing for exchange of substances.
"
krumiyekuta piyaapath pitupasata naemeeme haekiyaawa vaedi wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarakda?,"The correct answer is **B: saegavime paraasa (saegavime paraasa)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Meya ovunta vilopingen saengava siteema sandahaa vadaa pulul paraasayak labaa dei."" This translates to ""It can obtain a vital substance by absorbing through its skin.""

The question asks what is the substance that a worm *cannot* absorb through its skin.  The passage goes on to say that a worm *cannot* absorb nutrients, water, or gases through its skin. Therefore, the answer is the substance that isn't absorbed through the skin, which is nutrients, water, and gases. The option that best represents the *lack* of absorption through the skin is **saegavime paraasa** (which means ""absorption through the skin""). Options A, C, and D all refer to things the worm *can* absorb through its skin.



"
krumiyekuge piyaasara kirimata aethi haekiyaawata balapana deyak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne pahatha sandahan evayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: prajananaya (reproduction)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that worms need to reproduce to survive and spread. It emphasizes that without reproduction, they wouldn't be able to continue their life cycle. The question asks what factor could hinder a worm's reproduction.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: aayu kaalaya (lifespan):** While lifespan is important, the passage focuses more on the ongoing process of survival and spreading, which is directly tied to reproduction.  A shorter lifespan *could* impact reproduction, but it's not the primary factor the passage highlights as a threat.
* **C: aahara raes kirima (feeding):** Feeding is crucial for survival, but the passage doesn't explicitly link *lack of food* to preventing reproduction.  They need to eat to reproduce, but the core issue is the *act* of reproduction itself.
* **D: kaaryakshamathawa (functionality/activity):**  While general functionality is important, the passage specifically points to the need to reproduce as essential for the worm's existence.  Loss of functionality *could* hinder reproduction, but reproduction is the core issue being addressed.

Therefore, **reproduction (prajananaya)** is the most directly relevant and logical answer based on the provided text.
"
pahatha daekwena lakshana walin saaman‍yayen dayinosarayan samaga sambandha nowanne kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: pasupasa kakul walin aewideema (Reptilian features)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that dinosaurs had reptilian features (""pasupasa kakul walin aewideema"") like scales and claws. The question asks what characteristic links dinosaurs to reptiles.  Option A directly addresses this. The other options are specific features of dinosaurs, but not the broader characteristic linking them to reptiles."
kurullange ha dayinosorayange podu lakshanayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: niyapothu sahitha paa (constant, powerful roar)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ovunta korapotu saha niya sahitha paa thibe... tee rex keneku men siya pasupasa kakul deken aevidi."" This translates to ""They had a constant, powerful roar along with their teeth and claws... they could roar like a powerful beast.""

This directly links the roar (paa) to a key characteristic of dinosaurs. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: biththara daemeema (large teeth):** While dinosaurs had teeth, the passage emphasizes the *roar* as a distinctive feature.
* **B: aewideemata pasupasa kakul deka bhawitha kirima (the ability to form powerful claws):** Similar to teeth, claws are mentioned, but the roar is presented as a more defining trait.
* **C: piyaasara kirimata aethi haekiyaawa (ability to drink and eat):** This is a basic biological function and not a unique characteristic specifically highlighted in the passage.



Therefore, the constant, powerful roar is the most accurate answer to the question of a defining characteristic of dinosaurs mentioned in the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, sayikaed shakaye kumana kotasa traisaratopsge hata aaharayata gatha haekida?","The correct answer is **A: katu sahitha kola (tough, leafy branches)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that *Triceratops* had specialized teeth for grinding tough, leafy branches. It also mentions that they ate plants with thorns, poisonous leaves, fruits, and roots. 

Therefore, the passage explicitly links *Triceratops* to eating tough, leafy branches. The other options are not mentioned as part of their diet in the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, traisaratops anubhawa kirimata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda? ","The correct answer is **D: wisha sahitha gedi aethi shaakayak (poisonous leafy plants)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Triceratops had a strong bite to chew tough, thorny leaves. It also mentions they consumed poisonous plants, fruits, and other things (including dinosaurs!). 

The question asks what potential explanation exists for Triceratops experiencing difficulties (presumably health issues or reduced success) when consuming these poisonous plants. The passage offers the most logical explanation in option D: that they ate poisonous leafy plants.  The passage suggests they *did* eat them, and the difficulty arose *because* they were poisonous.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: sloth:**  While Triceratops might have been slow-moving, the passage doesn't connect slowness to difficulties eating the plants.
* **B: daedi athu sahitha shakayak (plants with thorns):**  The passage *explicitly* says Triceratops had a strong bite to deal with thorny leaves.  This doesn't explain why they would have problems with *poisonous* plants.
* **C: giravek (dinosaurs):** The passage mentions dinosaurs were part of their diet, but doesn't relate dinosaur consumption to any difficulties.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ithaliye uthurudiga p‍radeshawala pulul lesa janap‍riya vimata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan kreeda walin monavada?","The correct answer is **A: paapandu (football)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that football (paapandu) is a popular sport in Italy, especially in the northern regions.
* The question asks which of the listed sports is popular among the northern Italians.
* The passage explicitly mentions football as being popular in northern Italy for both amateur and Olympic level play.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wolibol (volleyball):** While volleyball is played in Italy, the passage doesn't mention it as being particularly popular in the north.
* **C: hima puwaruwe lissa yaama (ice hockey):** The passage mentions ice hockey as a sport played in the north, but it doesn't explicitly state it's *more* popular than football. It's mentioned along with other winter sports, implying it might be less dominant.
* **D: F1 motor rathha dhaawana tharaga (F1 motor racing):** While F1 is popular in Italy, the passage lists it as a sport, not as one particularly favored by the northern Italians for amateur/Olympic levels. It's more of a spectator sport.

This translates to: ""Along with Italian national football, German national football, the most popular football was held in the arena in 2006, FIFA World Cup.""

Therefore, football (paapandu) is mentioned as a popular sport in Italy during the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
"
laksemberghi aethaem kotas beljiyama bawata path wuye kumana siduvimen pasuwada?,"The correct answer is **B: beljiyaanu viplavaya**.

The text states: ""Vartamaanaye beljiyame pradesha, atitaye laksembergaye kotas woo namuth 1830 gananvala belgiyaanu viplavayen pasu beljiyamata himi viya."" which translates to ""Currently it is part of Belgium, but in the past, the territory of Luxembourg was annexed to Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in 1830.""
"
laksemberghi nishk‍reeyabhawayata balapaewe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: germanu aak‍ramanaya** (German invasion).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Laksemberg saema vitama nishkriya ratak lesa siteemata uthsaha kalat palamu wana loka yuddhaya saha dewana loka yuddhaya yana dekehidima germaniya visin atpat karaganna ladi."" This translates to ""Luxembourg, being a relatively neutral country, was forced to fight against Germany in both World War I and World War II.""  This clearly indicates that the German invasions were a major factor in Luxembourg's neutrality being challenged.

While the other options are historically relevant, they aren't the primary reason for the *challenges* to Luxembourg's neutrality:

* **B: Yuropa sangamayata ekvima (Integration into the European Union):** This is a more recent development and a consequence of the country's history, not the initial reason for its neutrality.
* **C: Beljiyaanu viplavaya (Belgian Revolution):**  This event led to Luxembourg becoming part of Belgium, but it didn't inherently *challenge* its neutrality.
* **D: Svadheena ratak bawata pathvima (Becoming an independent state):** Luxembourg was independent *before* the German invasions, and the invasions were a challenge to that independence and neutrality.



Therefore, the German invasions are the most direct and significant factor mentioned in the text regarding challenges to Luxembourg's neutrality."
thurkiye mulu bhoomi p‍ramanayen warga kilomeetar keeyak yuropaye thibeda?,"The correct answer is **A: 9174**.

The passage states: ""aasiyave da varga kilo meetara 23,764 k (varga saethapum 9,174 k) yuropaye da pihitaa aetha."" This translates to ""in Asia it has a land area of 23,764 sq km (9,174 sq km) hidden in Europe.""  Therefore, the land area of Turkey hidden in Europe is 9,174 sq km, which is option A.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, thurkiya saethapum keeyak diga da?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The text states: ""Thurkey bhoomi pradeshaye diga kilo meetar 1,600 kata wadi (saethapum 1,000)"". This translates to ""Turkey's land area is 1,600 kilometers (approximately 1,000 miles).""
"
wathikaanu nagaraye lathin bhashawa bhawitha karanne kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **A: aagamika uthsawa (religious festivals)**.

The text states: ""Vatikaanu nagaraye siyalu puravaesiyo romaanu katolika wethi. Vatikanaye waeda karana boho denaa edineda bhavitha karana bhaashava da itaali wana athara latin bhaashava nitharama aagamika uthsavavaladi bhaavitha kere.""  This translates to: ""All the entries in Vatican City are Roman Catholic. The language to be used for all religious teachings and to provide information will be primarily Latin, along with Italian.""  Therefore, the reason for using Latin is for religious festivals (aagamika uthsawa).
"
wathikaanu nagaraye ithali bhashawa bhawitha nokaranne kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **A: vyavasthaa sampadanaya (administrative purposes)**.

The text states that Italian will be used for ""vyavasthaa sampadanaya"" which translates to administrative purposes.  The passage mentions that the Italian language will be used for administration and to communicate information. Therefore, the primary reason for using Italian in Vatican City is for administrative purposes.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, navina pariganakawala shabda mishra kirimen p‍rathilabha mevayin kawareda ?","The correct answer is **A: sangeethaya (music)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the new computer program is designed to combine words and music in a complex way, creating visual and cinematic presentations.  The last sentence explicitly mentions the program is ""highly influenced by music.""

Therefore, the question asks what the new computer program is complexly combining with words. The passage directly answers this is **music (sangeethaya)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Harappa saha Mohenjo-daro yana nagaravala saema nivasakama paahe navina malapavaahana paddhatiyakata sambandhitha jalayen sodaa harina vaesikili paddhatiyak savi kara tibuni.""  This translates to: ""In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, archaeologists have discovered a sophisticated drainage system related to a new transportation method."" The passage then goes on to mention that the technology was also found in other locations, but the initial discovery was in Mohenjo-daro.
"
pahatha sandahan sthaanawalin kumana sthaanayen diyunu malapavahana paddhathi soyaagena thibeda?,"The correct answer is **A: Harappawa**.

Here's why:

The question asks where the wheeled transportation system was found in relation to the Great Bath. The passage explicitly states: ""Harappa saha Mohenjo-daro yana nagaravala saema nivasakama paahe navina malapavaahana paddhatiyakata sambandhitha jalayen sodaa harina vaesikili paddhatiyak savi kara tibuni.""  This translates to: ""In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, the inhabitants were seen using a wheeled transportation system in connection with the Great Bath.""

While other civilizations used wheels, the passage directly links the discovery of wheeled transportation with the Great Bath in Harappa. Therefore, Harappa is the correct answer.
"
sketarayak haeravimata hethu wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: sket thalaye pathule aethi mada wak‍raya (The curved mark on the top of the sketch)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how the curved mark on top of the sketch (thalaye pathule aethi mada wakra) is the cause of the difficulty in sketching. It mentions that the hand struggles to follow the curve, and that even though the person can see the sketch, they can't replicate the curve with their hand.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sket thalaya dige diwena dwitathwa dara (The double-sided surface of the sketch's length)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the surface of the sketch's length being the cause of the difficulty.
* **C: sket karannage samastha kusalatha mattama (Only the overall skill of sketching)** - The passage explicitly states that the difficulty isn't due to a lack of skill, but a specific obstacle in the sketch itself.
* **D: ayiswala gunathmakabhawaya (The positive qualities of the hand)** -  The passage focuses on how the hand *struggles* with the curved mark, not on any positive qualities it possesses.



Therefore, the curved mark on the top of the sketch is the specific reason why sketching is challenging.

The passage describes a specific type of drawing where the line (sket) is always drawn touching the edges of two objects (the two ""magin depaettata paedduna da vadaat thadin ayis alla gaenimata haekiyaawa aethi karayi"").  It emphasizes that the line *cannot* be straight; it *must* follow the curves of the objects. The question asks what characteristic of the objects the new sketch should follow. Therefore, the curve is the essential element.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dara dekakin yuthuyi (two doors are used)** - This is irrelevant to the type of sketch.
*   **C: awathalawa aetha (a straight line is drawn)** - The passage explicitly states the line cannot be straight.
*   **D: aelavi aetha (a straight edge is drawn)** - Similar to C, the line is described as curved.

"mema chedayata anuwa, paramanu aalokayen athiriktha shakthiya muktha kirimata ida salasana kriyaawaliya kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: fotona wimochanaya uththejanaya kirima (Stimulation of photon emission)**.

Here's why:

The text describes how light (aloka) and photons are related. It explains that when an atom is stimulated by light, it releases photons.  The question asks about the action that causes the release of excess energy through atomic light.  Option B directly reflects this process.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: wikirana (Radiation):** While photon emission *is* a form of radiation, the question asks about the *process* that initiates it.
*   **C: fotona (Photon):** A photon is the particle of light, not the process of releasing it.
*   **D: wikirana wimochanaya uththejanaya kirima (Stimulation of radiation emission):**  This is a bit broader than the text's specific focus on *atomic light* and photon emission from atoms.  The text emphasizes the role of atoms in the process.

Therefore, **B** most accurately captures the key action described in the text.
"
paramanuwak fotonayak wimochanaya kirimata hethu wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: deepthimath aalokaya nisa aethiwana uththejanaya (excitation due to bright light)**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text explicitly states:** ""Vidyaagnayin mema kriyaavaliya 'vikirana vimochanaya uththejanaya kireema' lesa handunvanne diptimat aalokaya magin paramaanu uththejanayata path karana nisa, aalokaye fotonaya muktha weemak sidu weemath nisa, aalokaya vikiranaye aakarayak weemath nisa ya.""  This translates to: ""The learned one, by slightly influencing this action of 'excitation of emission', directs bright light towards the atom causing it to become excited, and consequently, the atom emits photons, and the shape of the light radiation is achieved.""

* **The text explains that photons are emitted when an atom is excited.** This excitation is caused by the influence of bright light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: athiriktha shakthiya muktha kirima (release of excess energy):** While energy is released, the text links this release *specifically* to excitation by light.  It's not simply about releasing excess energy in a general sense.
* **C: asthaayee shakthi mattam (temporary power level):**  The text doesn't refer to a temporary power level. It focuses on the excitation caused by light.
* **D: wikirana walata ahithakara p‍rathikriyaawak (radiation-friendly reaction):**  The text doesn't mention a radiation-friendly reaction. It's about the atom's response to light.

"mema chedayata anuwa, awasanayedee aaloka balbayak kriyaa witarahitha vimata hethu wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: balbaye loha padanama sokat eke ardha washayen pamanak paewatheema (Turning off the power switch at the halfway point of the bulb's metal base.)**

Here's why:

* **The Problem:** The text describes a situation where a light bulb is not working properly and poses a risk of electric shock if the metal base is touched while under voltage.
* **The Solution:** The text explicitly states that to avoid electric shock, you must turn off the power switch *at the halfway point of the bulb's metal base*. This action disconnects the electricity supply to the bulb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aaloka sawikura niwaerediwa kriyaa witarahithakara nomaethi vima (Turning off the switch or any other action that disconnects the power).** While turning off the switch is *part* of the solution, option B is *more precise* and addresses the specific danger outlined in the text.
* **C: balbaya thula aethi suth‍rikaawa pilissee yaama (Removing the glass envelope of the bulb).**  This is dangerous and not a recommended solution. Removing the glass exposes the internal components and increases the risk of electric shock.
* **D: sokattuwata widuliya gala yaama mandgamee we (Lowering the voltage in the circuit).** This is highly unlikely to be a simple solution for a malfunctioning bulb and is not mentioned in the text.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and directly supported answer from the provided text."
widuli bubulak p‍rathisthaapanaya kirimedee sparsha kirima bhayaanaka wiya haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: balbaye padanama (bulb's metal part)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly warns about the danger of touching the metal part (loha padanama) of the bulb when installing or removing it. It states that doing so could result in electric shock.  The question asks what is dangerous to touch during the installation of an electrical bulb.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: suthrikaa (wiring):** While working with wiring is dangerous, the text specifically highlights the danger of touching the metal bulb part.
* **B: balbaye switachaya (bulb's switch):** The switch is used to control the power, not directly involved in the risk of electric shock during bulb installation.
* **D: kebalaya (cable/wire):** While cables can be dangerous, the text doesn't specifically emphasize the danger of touching the cable itself during the bulb installation process.  The focus is on the bulb's metal part.



Therefore, based on the provided text, touching the bulb's metal part is the most dangerous action during bulb installation.
"
mema chedayata anuwa n‍yashtiyak bedeemen siduwanne kumakda?,"Correct Answer: **A: protona labaa gaene**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vikhandana bombaya kriya karanne boho protona saha newtrona samaga nyashtiyak ek kireemen aethi wana shakthiye mooladharmaya matha ya."" (The fundamental principle of the explosive action of a fission bomb is the emission of a large number of protons and neutrons together in a compound.)
* **The passage then describes the process:** ""Nyashtiya naevatat bedamin evita ehi shakthiya yam pramaanayak mudhaa hariyi."" (This power, emitted by the fission, is proportional to the amount of energy released.)
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Samahara paramaanu wala asthaayi nyasthi aethi athara ein adahas karanne eva mada chalanayak ho kisidu chalanayak naethiva bindee yaame pravanataavakin yukta vimayi."" (When a stable nucleus undergoes fission, it is accompanied by a slight movement that is proportional to the momentum of the emitted particles.)

The key takeaway is that the fission process *releases* protons.  The energy released is directly related to the *number* of protons and neutrons emitted.  Therefore, the release of protons is a fundamental part of the process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shakthiya muda harinu laebe (The power is obtained by releasing energy):** While true, this doesn't explain *what* is released.  The question asks *what* is emitted.
* **C: paramanu asthaayee we (The nucleus is stable):** The passage explicitly states that the process occurs in *unstable* nuclei (asthaayi nyasthi aethi athara).
* **D: niytrona naethi vi yayi (Neutrons are not emitted):** This is directly contradicted by the passage, which says neutrons are emitted along with protons.

digu dura aemathum pruthiwiyata wetha pahalata parawarthanaya wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: duradkna (distance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abyavakaasaye aethi duradakna bhaavitha karayi."" which translates to ""The distance in space influences it."" The question asks what causes the moon's reflected light to be seen from Earth. The passage directly links it to the distance.  The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: chandrikaa (moon)** - The moon itself doesn't cause the light to be seen; it reflects sunlight.
*   **C: widuli pahan (electrical phenomenon)** - While light is an electromagnetic phenomenon, the core issue here is the *distance*.
*   **D: rokattu (obstruction/blockage)** - The passage talks about the distance *allowing* the light to reach us, not blocking it.



"
duradknayak abhyawakaashaye raendavimata bhawitha karanne mevayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: pruthiwi vayugolaya (Earth's atmosphere)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pruthuwiye vaayugolaya apage aalokaya saha darshanaya samaharak vikurti karana baevin vidyaagnayan abyavakaasaye aethi duradakna bhaavitha karayi.""  This translates to: ""The Earth's atmosphere, by distorting our light and vision, makes the distant moon appear blurred in space.""

Therefore, the atmosphere is what distorts the view of the moon from space. The other options are incorrect:

* **A: aaloka kadambha (light reflection):** While reflection plays a role in seeing the moon, the problem described is *distortion*, not just reflection.
* **B: rokattu (blocking):** The atmosphere doesn't block the moon completely, it distorts the light.
* **D: adi 100 ta wada usa chandrikaa (a 100-year-old moon):** This is nonsensical in the context of the passage.



"
kaalaya gevi yaama nireekshanaya kirima sandaha chak‍reeya siduvimak gaena sandahan kala yuththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: punarawarthanaya (repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the cyclical nature of time (""Chakreeya siduweemaka punaraavartanaya"").  It explains that a cyclical achievement is something that is repeated.  The question asks how to study time through the observation of cyclical achievements. Therefore, focusing on the *repetition* or cyclical pattern is the key.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kaala seemawa (limit of time/duration):** While time has a duration, the passage emphasizes the cyclical nature rather than a strict limit.
* **C: balapaema (power/strength):**  The passage doesn't connect time study directly to power or strength.
* **D: dushkarathawaya (difficulty):** The passage doesn't frame studying time as inherently difficult.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, yam siduvimaka kumana angaya sansandanaya kirimata kaalaya bhawitha weda?","The correct answer is **B: punarawarthanaya (repetition)**.

Here's why:

* **Translation:** ""With time, the dimension (length) of our achievements will be understood. By observing the repetition of cyclical achievements, you can find a way to grasp time for yourself.""

This clearly indicates that the passage is connecting the concept of time to the **repetition** of achievements (cyclical patterns). The passage suggests understanding time by observing how things repeat.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: diga (length):** While related to time, the passage focuses on *understanding* time, not just its length.
* **C: athdaekeem (modernity):** The passage is discussing time generally, not specifically modernity.
* **D: balapaema (power/strength):** The passage doesn't directly link time to power or strength.

This translates to: ""Furthermore, Charles, he went to the University of Cambridge and studied both humanities and ancient studies, and subsequently obtained a history degree (the degree of the first class honors of the divine path) in 2:2.""

* **The question asks:** ""memachdayata anuwa, sinhasanaye urumakkaarayakuge saaman‍ya lakshanaya lesa salakanu labanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?"" This translates to: ""According to the above, what is the common characteristic of those who obtain a degree in the throne, particularly in relation to the first class honors?""

* **Option A directly reflects the passage's information:**  It mentions obtaining a degree in 2:2, which is the ""degree of the first class honors of the divine path"" mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hamudawata baendeemata wishwa widyaalayen iwath vima:** While he went to the university, the passage doesn't say this is a characteristic of those on the throne.
* **C: ithihasaya igeneema:** He studied history, but the passage focuses on *obtaining a degree* in history.
* **D: hamudawata baendeemata pera wishwa widyaalayata yaama:**  He went to the university, but the passage doesn't link this directly to being on the throne or a characteristic of those in that position.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**."

* **Translation:** ""He studied human and ancient studies at Trinity College, Cambridge, and in a short time (2:2 - indicating a second-class honours degree), he obtained a degree."" 

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions that Charles Darwin received a degree.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: pasala awasan kirimata pera hamudawata baendeema (He went to the school to study hard):** While likely true, the passage focuses on him *receiving* the degree.
* **B: pura widyaawa igeneema (He started studying ancient studies):** He studied many things, not just ancient studies.
* **D: triniti koleg ekata yaama (He came to Trinity College):** This is true, but not the key event being described.

This translates to: ""For a long time, the northern Estonian region was greatly influenced by the German cultural power.""  It then goes on to say the Germans created the Estonian written language by bringing German script and adapting it to fit the Estonian language, including using ""O/o"" for certain sounds.  And that many words were borrowed from German.

The passage implies a significant influence, but it doesn't give a precise timeframe.  However, the phrase ""mul kaalaya thula siduviya"" (in the early times) and the discussion of the written language development suggests a period of several centuries.  Of the options provided, the most reasonable estimate for a significant period of German cultural influence on Estonia, leading to the development of the written language, would be in the 600-800 year range.

Therefore, the best answer is:

**C: meeta wasara 600 kata pamana pera** (approximately 600 years)

estoniyaanu bhashawa kerehi balapaem kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: Õ/õ akura**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eya germanu hodiya matha padanam woo athara ek akurak """"O/o"""" ek kerini."" This translates to: ""It (Estonian language) was adapted to the German language and therefore adopted the 'O/o' sound.""

Therefore, the Estonian language's phonology was influenced by the German language, specifically adopting the ""O/o"" sound.  Option A (""Õ/õ akura"") is the closest representation of that influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: germanu hodiya** (German language): While German influenced Estonian, the question is about a specific *feature* of the language, not the language itself.
* **C: germanu pujakawaru** (German priests):  The priests are not directly related to the development of the language's phonetic features.
* **D: dewiyan** (gods):  The gods are unrelated to the question about the language's influence.

The passage states: ""Eya miliyana 340 sita miliyana 500 ka pudgalayan pramaanayak kathaa karana bavatat miliyana 800 ka pamana pramanayakata eya avabodha kara gatha haeki bavatat thakseru kere."" This translates to: ""While the number of people who can speak the language is between 340 million and 500 million, the number of people who can understand it is between 800 million and 1000 million.""

The passage also emphasizes that focusing on the *number of speakers* in local Hindi dictionaries and comparing them to the *number of people who understand* the language is not appropriate.

Therefore, the most accurate way to determine the number of Hindi speakers in Sri Lanka (as the question refers to) is to count the people who can *understand* the language, not just those who *speak* it. Option C reflects this understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hindi bhashawata behewin samana upabhasha ganan ganu labanne nam** (We can obtain the number of speakers by counting the equivalent sub-languages of Hindi). This is incorrect because the passage explicitly states against using local Hindi dictionary numbers.
*   **B: urdu bhashawa katha karana aya ganankaranu labanne nam** (We can obtain the number of speakers by counting the Urdu speakers).  The question is about Hindi speakers in Sri Lanka, not Urdu speakers.
*   **D: bhashawa kiyawiya haeki pudgalayin ganan ganu labanne nam** (We can obtain the number of speakers by counting the people who can say the language). This is similar to option A and incorrect because it only focuses on those who *speak*, not those who *understand*.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hangel hodiya ohu mulin nam kale hunmin jonjiyam yanuveni. ehi arthaya """"janatavage upades sandaha nivaeradi shabda"""" yannayi.""

This translates to: ""Hangul (the alphabet) was created when he (Sejong the Great) first made the Hunmin Jeongeum. Its meaning is ""the order in which the sounds are pronounced for the instruction of the common people.""

Option B directly reflects this: ""hodiye mul nama hunan jiyonjiyam wiya"" which translates to ""It was created with the Hunmin Jeongeum"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eya sejon rajuge palana samaye aarambhaye dee nirmanaya karana ladee** (It was built at the beginning of Sejong's reign): While the creation happened during Sejong's reign, the text focuses on the *creation of the alphabet* itself, not its construction.
*   **C: eya soyaa ganna ladde joson rajawanshaye siwwana raju wisini.** (It was made by a descendant of the Joseon royal family who wanted to gain popularity): The text doesn't mention Sejong's lineage or his desire for popularity.
*   **D: meya hithamathama nirmanaya karana laddki** (It was built with a certain intention): The text mentions a specific intention: to create an alphabet for the instruction of the common people.



"
hanmin jiyonjiyam hodiya awasanayedee wenas karana ladde kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **D: jiyonjiyam**.

Here's why:

The question asks *what* is the Hangul Jiyongjam (한글 훈민정음)  and why it was created. The provided text states:

*   ""Hangel hodiya ohu mulin nam kale hunmin jonjiyam yanuveni. ehi arthaya """"janatavage upades sandaha nivaeradi shabda"""""" which translates to: ""He (Sejong the Great) created the Hangul, the Hunmin Jiyongjam. Its meaning is 'words for the instruction of the people'.""

Therefore, the Hunmin Jiyongjam (Jiyongjam) *is* the answer to the question of what it is.  The text explicitly states it's the ""words for the instruction of the people.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Sejong** was the king who created it, not the writing system itself.
*   **Hangeyul** is another name for Hangul, but the question is asking for the *name of the writing system*, not just another term for it.

Here's why:

* **The problem states:** The problem establishes that the gravitational force you experience depends on the mass of the object attracting you and your own mass.
* **The key concept:**  Gravitational force is proportional to the *product* of the masses involved.
* **Your mass:** The problem tells us your mass is 90 kg.
* **The Earth's mass:** The problem tells us the Earth's mass is 90,000 kg.

Therefore, your gravitational force is a result of the Earth's massive size.  The answer B correctly identifies that your gravitational force is affected by both your mass *and* the Earth's mass. The wording ""obe bara adu wanu aetha"" (because your mass is small) indicates that your personal mass contributes to the overall gravitational interaction, even though the Earth's mass dominates.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ayoge guruthvakarshanayata wada pruthiwiye guruthvakarshanaya obata aeda noganee (Gravitational force doesn't affect you because of Earth's gravitational force):** This is wrong.  You *do* feel Earth's gravitational force; that's why you stay on the ground!
* **C: ayoge guruthvakarshanaya vaediyen aeda ganee, e nisa obe bara vaedu wanu aetha (Gravitational force affects you because your mass is small):**  This is incorrect. The force is affected by *both* your mass *and* the Earth's mass. Your small mass doesn't negate the Earth's huge influence.
* **D: pruthiwiye guruthvakarshanaya ayo hi guruthvakarshanayata wada obawa aeda ganu aetha (Earth's gravitational force is the reason you experience gravitational force):** This is partially true, but not the complete explanation. It doesn't address the impact of your own mass on the force.

The question asks what causes the Moon's surface to appear reddish when viewed from Earth. The text directly states that there's a layer of dust on the surface (""Prushtaya vadaa thuni nisa...""). This dust is the most likely cause of the reddish appearance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aasanna paeththata wada ghana prushtayak aetha (There is a thick layer of dust near the surface):** The text mentions dust, but doesn't say it's thick.

*   **D: usbim walata adu udam raela (Dust has accumulated):** This is similar to B, but doesn't point to the reason behind the color.

Therefore, option **C** accurately links the presence of dust on the Moon's surface to its reddish appearance as viewed from Earth."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: udam raela vaedi thaena (not rising and falling)**: The text explicitly mentions the dust has a ""rising and falling shape,"" so this is incorrect.
* **C: usbim walata pahalin (at the beginning of the USBim)**:  The text doesn't mention anything about a ""USBim"" or its connection to the dust.

"mema chedayata anuwa, samahara aya wishvasa karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: wenath grahaloka wala jiwaya pawathiyi (believe in living on other planets)**.

Here's why:

The passage contrasts the beliefs of ordinary people (""boho pudgalayin"") with those of the educated (""samahara pudgalayin"").  It states that ordinary people are unaware of the vastness of the universe and the possibility of life elsewhere.  In contrast, educated people believe in life on other planets (""grahalokayaka pitaththarayan ho wenath jivin aethi bhava visvaasa karati"").

The question asks what the passage suggests the educated believe. Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pudgalayin wenath tharu walata gaman kara aetha (ordinary people go on pilgrimages to the stars):** The passage implies ordinary people *don't* do this, but rather are unaware of it.
* **B: pudgalayinta wenath lokayan gaweshanaya kirime haekiyaawak naetha (ordinary people don't need to search for the universe):**  The passage says they are *unaware* of the universe, not that they don't need to search for it.
* **D: tharakaa athara dura saethapum triliyanayakata wada aduya (calculating the immense distances to stars):** The passage mentions the distance, but doesn't say educated people *calculate* it. It simply states they *believe* in life on other planets.



"
oba suryayaage kendrayen iwathata yana wita thuneenee wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: plasma**.

The text states: ""Suryayage madyayen kramayen ivathata yaddi vayuva kramayen thuni we."" This translates to: ""If you go inwards through the center of the sun, you will find it is made of layers of air, fire, and **plasma**.""  Therefore, plasma is what you would find in the center of the sun.
"
"chedaya anuwa, pruthiwiye sita daekiya haekke suryayaage kumana kotasa da?","The correct answer is **C: prabhagolaya (radiation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes the Sun as being made of ""vayu, gindara saha plasma valini"" (air, fire, and plasma). 
* It then states that if the Sun's interior were to become denser, it would emit ""aaloka bolaya"" (a radiant glow).
* ""Prabhagolaya"" translates to radiation or electromagnetic radiation, which is the light and energy emitted by the Sun. 
* The passage is describing the Sun emitting light, and radiation is the correct term for that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: prushtaya (surface)** - While the surface is involved in emitting light, the passage describes a more fundamental process happening within the Sun, leading to the overall ""aaloka bolaya"".
* **B: plasmawa (plasma)** - Plasma is a *component* of the Sun, not the light it emits.
* **D: maeda (mass)** - Mass is a property of the Sun, but it doesn't directly describe the light it gives off.



"
koparnikas n‍yaaya thahawuru kirimata pahatha sandahan nireekshana walin upakaaree wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: sikuruge sankrantiya (equinox)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Galileo observed the phases of Venus in 1610.  These phases were difficult to explain under the geocentric (Earth-centered) model.  Galileo's observations *supported* Copernicus's heliocentric (Sun-centered) model, which suggested that Venus orbits the Sun, just like Earth.  Crucially,  **understanding the equinoxes (sukuruge sankrantiya) was vital in accurately predicting Venus's phases.** The equinoxes mark the points in Earth's orbit where the Sun's direct rays shine equally on both hemispheres.  This made Venus's phases more predictable and consistent with a heliocentric view.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sikuruge adiyara (solstice):** Solstices are also important, but equinoxes were specifically key to Venus's phases.
* **C: suryayaa saha sikuru athara samanakam (equal distance between Sun and Venus):** While important, equal distance isn't the primary factor in explaining the phases.
* **D: suryayaa saha chandrayaa athara samanakam (equal distance between Sun and Moon):**  The Moon's orbit isn't directly relevant to explaining Venus's phases.
"
1610 dee gaeleeliyo gaeleeli wisin nireekshanaya karana ladde pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: sikuruge sankrantiya (solstice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Galileo observed the moons of Jupiter in 1610 and then, in 1639, Jeremiah Horox observed the *solstice* (sukuruge sankrantiya) to help prove Copernicus's theory.  The question asks what Galileo observed in 1610. The passage explicitly states he observed the moons of Jupiter.  While the other options are related to astronomy, they are not what Galileo was observing in 1610 according to the text.
"
mema chedayata anuwa aemasan gangawa jalaya ekathukara ganne kohenda?,"The correct answer is **D: dewana wishalathama gangawa** (the most colossal river).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""eya devaeniyata vishaala gangata vada 8 gunayaka jala pramaanayak darayi."" This translates to ""it (the Amazon River) shows a volume of water 8 times greater than the most colossal river.""  Therefore, to calculate the total water volume of the Amazon, you need to consider the volume of the most colossal river.
"
aemasan gagata lak‍shanika nowanne mevayin kumana piligaeneem da?,"The correct answer is **B: eya wishalathama gangawayi (It is the widest river)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""eya devaeniyata vishaala gangata vada 8 gunayaka jala pramaanayak darayi.""  This translates to ""It (Amazon river) has a water volume 8 times greater than the Devaeniyata river, and it is the widest river.""  The other options don't reflect the information provided."
mema chedaye sandahan awama washayen wenisiyulanuwan sankyaawak sewaye yodava aeththe kumana vaeda wargayada?,"The correct answer is **A: krushikarmaya (agriculture)**.

Here's why:

The first paragraph describes a situation where someone took a job in a large, competitive (atak viraekiya) industry (venisiyulanuvangen siyayata). They were unable to manage the financial pressures (aarthikaya thula) and had to leave.  They then took a job in a more stable, regular (niratava) agricultural job (krushikarmaanthaye).  The passage also implies a connection between the oil industry and agriculture in the region (thel apanayanaya).

The question asks what type of work the person is now doing. The paragraph clearly states they are now working in agriculture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: karmanthaya (labor/manual work):** While agriculture involves labor, ""krushikarmaya"" is the specific field of work.  ""Karmanthaya"" is too general.
* **C: thel (oil):** This refers to the oil industry, which the person *left*, not the job they now have.
* **D: sevawan (service):** While the person did a service job before, the text specifically mentions a shift *to* agriculture.



"
mema chedaye sandahan vaedima wenisiylanuwan sankyaawak sewaye yodava aeththe kumana vaeda anshayada?,"The correct answer is **A: sevawan (service)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Venisiyulanuvangen siyayata daha atak viraekiyaaven pelena athara, raekiya niyuktikayingen bohomayak avidhimath aarthikaya thula raekiya karati. Raekiya niyuktika venisiyulanuvangen thunen dekak seva ansaye raekiya karana athara...""
   This translates roughly to: ""Because of the strong attacks on the city, many illegal and financially burdensome taxes were imposed. The appointed official, Venisiyulanuwan, began to collect service taxes...""

* **The question asks:** ""mema chedaye sandahan vaedima wenisiylanuwan sankyaawak sewaye yodava aeththe kumana vaeda anshayada?""
   This translates roughly to: ""In this context, what is the component of service that is being counted?""

The passage explicitly says Venisiyulanuwan (Venisiyulan) began collecting **service taxes (seva ansaye raekiya karana)**. Therefore, the component being counted is **sevawan (service)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: krushikarmaya (agriculture):** Agriculture is mentioned as a competing economic activity, but not the component being counted.
* **C: karmanthaya (labor):** Labor is a part of service, but the question is asking for the *component* of service being counted, and 'sevawan' directly refers to the service itself.
* **D: thel (oil):** Oil is mentioned in relation to potential oil extraction, but not the component of service being counted.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, wilayanaya tharakaawalata kirimata ida denne kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **B: wilayana p‍rathikriyaakaaraka thaeneema (the dissolving reactant)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a reaction where a reactant is dissolved.** It mentions ""vilayana prathikriyakaraka"" which directly translates to ""dissolving reactant.""
* **The passage highlights that the reactant gains energy (light and heat) and then undergoes a transformation to produce useful products.** This is typical of a reaction where a reactant is dissolving and participating in a chemical change.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wadath bara sanghataka thaeneema (the solvent)** - The passage focuses on the reactant, not the solvent. The solvent is the substance that dissolves the other substance.
* **C: aalokaya ha ushnathwaya labaa deema (gaining light and heat)** - This is a consequence of the reaction, not the identity of the reactant.
* **D: hayidrajan paramanu thaeneema (hydrogen atom)** - While hydrogen atoms might be involved, the passage doesn't specify the identity of the reactant as simply hydrogen atoms.  It describes a chemical substance that dissolves and reacts.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the question refers to the dissolving reactant.
"
pahatha sandahan dewalin p‍rayojanawath wilayana p‍rathikriyaakaarakayak nirmanaya karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: paramanu (atom)**.

Here's why:

The question describes a process where atoms (specifically hydrogen atoms) are used to generate power through a reaction. The text mentions ""balashakthiya uthpaadanaya"" (energy production) and ""prathikriyakarakayak"" (reactor), indicating a chemical or nuclear reaction involving atoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hayidrajan (hydrogen)** - While hydrogen is involved, the question asks about the fundamental building block.
*   **B: tharu (tree)** - Trees are organic matter and not directly involved in generating power in this context.
*   **D: balashakthiya (energy)** - Energy is the *result* of the process, not the component used to create it.

Therefore, the answer is **paramanu (atom)**."
jalaye rasayanika sanyuthiya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: ek hayidrajan paramanuwak ha oksijan paramanuwak**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Sanyukta jalaya haiderajan paramaanu dekakin saha ek oxygen paramaanuvakin saedee aetha.""  This translates to: ""In compound water, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""
* Option B accurately reflects this information: ""ek hayidrajan paramanuwak ha oksijan paramanuwak"" which means ""one hydrogen atom and one oxygen atom"".

The other options are incorrect because they either change the number of hydrogen or oxygen atoms, or incorrectly use ""dekak"" (meaning ""two"") when the passage specifies ""ek"" (meaning ""one"") for oxygen.
"
jalaya ehi svabhaya wenas karana wita esema pawathinne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: anuka wyuhaya (anular arrangement)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ehi vayuvak, dravayak how ghanayak vuvat eyata aeththe ekama anuka vyuhayaki."" This translates to ""It is a gas, it is a liquid, it can be a solid, and it all has a regular arrangement.""

The passage emphasizes that the regular arrangement of particles is a key characteristic that distinguishes the state of matter (like water) and influences its properties, connecting it to both physical and chemical properties. Therefore, ""anuka wyuhaya"" (anular arrangement) is the primary reason the passage highlights this characteristic.
"
"chedayata anuwa, aethaem neethi paenavimata uthsaha kirimedee p‍rantha dahathuna sandaha pahatha sandahan karunuwalin gaetaluwak nowuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: ekamathika anumaethiya awashya sanshodhana (Uniform necessity research)**.

Here's why:

* **The problem described in the first part (P) highlights a lack of standardized policies and coordination across different regions.** The central government (national authority) lacks the power to enforce uniform policies, and regional authorities aren't following the same guidelines. This results in inefficiency and unmet needs.

* **Option C, ""ekamathika anumaethiya awashya sanshodhana"" (Uniform necessity research), directly addresses this issue.** It suggests a comprehensive study of the fundamental needs of all regions to establish a standardized approach.  This is the logical step to take to create consistent policies and ensure that all regions receive the necessary support.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: jaathika baladhaareenge daedi adheekshanaya (Monitoring of national authority's power)** While monitoring is important, it doesn't solve the problem of inconsistent regional policies.
* **B: kongrasaya thula balaya nomaethikama (Increased power/ethics of the Congress)** Increasing the Congress's power or ethics alone wouldn't guarantee uniform policies. It needs a framework for establishing and enforcing those policies.
* **D: nopawathina jaathika widhaayakayak (Unenforceable national authority)** This describes the current situation, but doesn't offer a solution to create uniform policies.



Therefore, **C** is the best answer because it directly addresses the core problem outlined in the first part of the question – the lack of standardized policies and the need for a uniform approach to addressing regional needs."
"mema chedayata anuwa, wiplaviya yuddhaya atharathura madhyama aanduwe thathwaya niwaerediwa pilibimbu karanne kumana p‍rakaashayada?","The correct answer is **A: badu balathmaka karanu laebuwe kongrasaya ha p‍rantha baladhaareen wisinya (The congress, which had the power of armed force, and the provincial authorities.)**

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where the central government (represented by the Congress) lacked the necessary authority and resources to effectively govern and implement policies. It also highlights the limitations of the federal authorities.  Furthermore, the provincial authorities were unwilling or unable to cooperate, and their policies didn't align with the central government's objectives.

Option A directly addresses the core problem: the weakness of the Congress's power *and* the resistance of the provincial authorities.  These two factors combined created the governing crisis described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vyavasthaawa sanshodhanaya kirima kongrasaye adhikaariya matha randa pawathee (The congress's right to conduct administrative research.)** While the passage mentions administrative research, it's not the *primary* issue. The problem is the lack of power to *implement* the research findings.
* **C: rajya niyojithayinta paevaethmak nomaethi wiya (The state's ability to enforce regulations.)**  The passage indicates the state *cannot* effectively enforce regulations due to the lack of authority and cooperation.
* **D: madhyama rajaya p‍radhaana kotas dekakin samanwitatha wiya (The provincial government being fully aligned with the central government's policies.)** This is the opposite of what the passage describes. The provinces are *not* aligned and actively resist central government policies.



"

The passage states: ""Mema pela lekhanaye pitupasa udu yatikuru athata disve."" which translates to ""I saw a small label on the top of the writing.""
"
singappuruwa keerthimath wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **A: nagarika harithabhawaya (urban greening)**.

Here's why:

* The question mentions Nidahase, a Singaporean landscape architect, and her contribution to transforming Singapore into a garden city. 
* Singapore is world-renowned for its urban greening initiatives and commitment to creating a lush, green environment within a city-state.  This is a major aspect of what Singapore is famous for.

The other options are not the primary reason for Singapore's global recognition:

* **B: kandu naegeema (tourism)** - While tourism is important to Singapore, it's not the reason for its reputation as a ""garden city.""
* **C: wik‍ramanwitatha kreeda (Vikramanta sports)** -  Vikramanta sports are not a prominent feature of Singapore's global image.
* **D: ranga kalawa (fine arts)** - Singapore has a vibrant arts scene, but it's not the defining characteristic of its reputation as a garden city.



"
vaenda mis jokim yanu kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: doopathak**.

Here's why:

The question asks what ""vaenda mis jokim"" means. The text says ""demuhun okid vargayak wana vaenda miss jokim"" which translates to ""They wanted a Miss Jokim from the same class"". The text further states she was looking for a ""miss jokim"" in the same class.  ""Doopathak"" is a Sinhala word that often refers to a young woman or girl, particularly in a context of beauty or attractiveness.  This fits the context of a beauty pageant (""Miss"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: malak (flower):** While related to beauty, it doesn't fit the context of a competition or a person.
*   **C: udbhida udyaanayak (exotic garden):** This is a place, not a person or title.
*   **D: jaathika smarakayak (national monument):** This is a memorial, not a person or title.

"mema chedayata anuwa, geesa piramidawala kumana gunathmakabhawayata nawa rajadhaaniye egypthuwerun mawitha kala nohaeki vi da?","The correct answer is **C: ewage wishalathwaya (its vastness/size)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nava raajadhaniye puraathana misaravaru ovunge muthunmiththange smaaraka mavita kalaha, eva evitath avurudu dahasak paerani wee tibuni.""  This translates to: ""The new capital is a memorial of the ancient Egyptians' close friends, and also has been raised for ten thousand years.""  This implies the new capital is built to be monumental and impressive, reflecting the grandeur of the ancient Egyptians.

* **The question asks:**  ""What characteristic of the pyramids did the new capital not emulate?""  The passage emphasizes the memorial aspect and the longevity of the pyramids.

* **The other options:**
    * **A: ewage wayasa (its age):**  While the new capital is described as being raised for ten thousand years, the passage doesn't explicitly say the pyramids were *that* old.  The age is implied, not directly stated as a defining characteristic being emulated.
    * **B: gal bhawithaya (stone material):** The passage doesn't specify the building material of the pyramids.  It's a reasonable assumption they are made of stone, but the text doesn't confirm this.
    * **D: ewaye idikirim (its construction method):** The passage doesn't discuss the construction methods of the pyramids.

* **Therefore, the vastness (size) is the most likely characteristic that the new capital did *not* emulate.** The passage describes it as a large memorial, suggesting it might differ in size from the original pyramids.  It's the most plausible answer given the information.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, shaka bhak‍shakayan vaesi luhubaendeema sandaha gaman karanne kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **A: batahira thaenithalawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saema wasarakama october masayedi pamana, shaaka bhaksakayan miliyana 1.5 k pamana uthuru kandukaraye sita maaraa ganga tharanaya karamin dakshina thaenithalawa wetha varshaava balaaporottuven gaman karati."" This translates to: ""Saema undertakes the migration of 1.5 million herbivores from the northern grasslands to the southern plains, fighting for water.""

Then it continues: ""Inpasu batahira desin uthurata apasu gaman kara, aprel maasaye vaesivalin pasuwa nawatha varak maaraa ganga tharanaya karayi.""  This translates to: ""Afterwards, it travels to the eastern country and migrates again in April after the rains.""

Therefore, the wildebeest migrate from the northern grasslands to the **southern plains (batahira thaenithalawa)**.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, shaka bhak‍shakayan ap‍rel masayedee yam welawaka pitath wanne kumana p‍radeshayen da?","The correct answer is **A: serengeti kalapaya**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Inpasu batahira desin uthurata apasu gaman kara, aprel maasaye vaesivalin pasuwa nawatha varak maaraa ganga tharanaya karayi. Serengeti kalaapaye serengeti jaathika vanodyaanaya, tansaaniave engorongoro sanrakshana pradeshaya saha masva vanajivi raksitaya saha kenyave maasaayi maaraa jaathika raksitaya anthargatha we.""

* This translates to: ""Then went to a distant country, after the floods in April, and crossed the Mara River again. This is within the Serengeti ecosystem, including the Serengeti National Park, Tanzania's Ngorongoro Conservation Area, the Wildlife Management Area, and Kenya's Maasai Mara National Reserve.""

* The question asks where the herbivores grazed in April after the floods. The text directly connects the herbivores grazing in April to the Serengeti ecosystem.

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"

The text explicitly states: ""Germaniya mema prahaaraya """"operation seelayan"""" lesa nam karana ladi."" This translates to ""Germany fought this attack under the name """"Operation Seelayan"""".""
"
germaniya b‍rithan‍yayata ella kala p‍raharaya haendinwuye keseda?,"The correct answer is **B: opareshan seelayan**.

The passage states: ""Germaniya mema prahaaraya """"operation seelayan"""" lesa nam karana ladi."" This translates to ""Germany fought this attack under the name """"operation seelayan"""".""

Therefore, ""Operation Seelayan"" was the name of Germany's attack on Britain.

The passage states: ""Italiye ratawal alla gaeneema sandaha bata piris madyadharani muhuda haraha yatraa kara aprikaava aakramanaya kirimata haeki wana paridi ovunta hamudaa diyath kireeme sthaanayak tibiya yutuya.""

This translates to: ""Italy, driven by the desire to gain territory, had the possibility of invading Africa and establishing a base for delivering supplies to its troops.""

The passage goes on to say that Italy attempted to take Egypt, British mandates, and navals to gain this.

Therefore, the action Italy took to prevent the delivery of supplies to their enemies is the most relevant answer. Options A, B, and D are actions Italy *considered* or *did* but aren't directly related to preventing supply delivery.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ithaliye yuddhaye p‍radhaana aramuna lesa saelakuwe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: aprikaanu ratawal alla gaeneema (invading African countries)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Italiye pradhaana aramunu vuye aprikaaanu ratawal ya. ema ratawal alla gaeneema sandaha bata piris madyadharani muhuda haraha yatraa kara aprikaava aakramanaya kirimata haeki wana paridi ovunta hamudaa diyath kireeme sthaanayak tibiya yutuya.""  This translates to: ""Italy's main ambition was to invade African countries. It was widely believed that by undertaking frequent expeditions, Italy could establish a foothold for its people to conquer and provide resources.""

The other options are related but not the *primary* ambition described in the passage:

*   **B: shakthimath hamudawak saha nawika hamudawak godanaegeema (building a strong army and navy):** This was a *means* to achieve their goals, but not the ultimate ambition itself.
*   **C: eejipthu naew iwath kirima (conquering Egypt):** This was one of their actions, but not the main ambition.
*   **D: b‍rithan‍ya kandawuru pihituvima (taking over British colonies):** While Italy had aspirations, the passage focuses on Africa as their main target.

Therefore, option A best reflects Italy's primary ambition as outlined in the text."
aak‍ramanikayan samaga mith‍ra sabandatha aethikara gaththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: wichi p‍ransha jaathikayin**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eya """"vichi"""" pransha jathikayan visin palanaya karana ladi. ovun, 1940 dee germanuvan samaga saamaya goda nagaagena aethi..."" 

This translates to: ""They fought for the liberation of the ""Wichi"" French people. They had a close association with the 1940 Germans...""

Therefore, the ""Wichi"" French people (wichi pransha jaathikayan) had a close association with the Germans. While the passage mentions the Germans, Americans, and the French people, the question specifically asks about the alliance of the attackers. The passage directly links the attackers' alliance to the ""Wichi"" French people.



"

The passage states: ""Mithra paarsvaya 1940 agosthu 15 wana dina dakunu pranshaya aakramanaya kala athara, ema aakramanaya """"draegan meheyuma"""" lesa haedinviya. Hudek sati dekak thula aemerikanuvan saha nidahas pransha hamuda yana eva dakunu pranshaya nidahas kara gene thibu athara germaniya desata haeremin tibini.""

This translates to: ""On the Allied side, after the German invasion of France on August 15, 1940, this invasion was lightly defended.  With the help of a large number of Americans and the French Resistance, France was liberated from the German forces.""

Therefore, the Allied forces (Americans and the French Resistance) are responsible for the ""draegan meheyuma"" (Dragon's Fury) operation.



"

The text states: ""Germanu sabmaerina handunvana ladde you-bottu yana namini."" This translates to ""The German army attacked the submarine with depth charges."" Therefore, the submarine sank because of depth charges (yu-bottu).
"
"p‍rathama warata bhawitha karana wita, sabmaereena walata itha seemitha parasayak thibune kumana k‍sheth‍raye da?","The correct answer is **A: sanchalanaya (movement)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sabmaerina palawana loka yuddhayedi menma dewana loka yuddhayedida bhavitha karana ladi. ekala eva ithaama mandagami menma seemitha prahaaraka seemaawak sahitha viya.""  This translates to: ""Sabmarine fought in the World War, aiming to prevent a World War.  It moved with a limited range of attack, like a slow-moving, limited-range fortress.""

The key phrase is ""ithaama mandagami menma seemitha prahaaraka seemaawak sahitha viya,"" meaning ""it moved with a limited range of attack, like a slow-moving, limited-range fortress.""  This directly points to **movement (sanchalanaya)** as the primary capability of the submarine.  The other options don't fit the context:

*   **B: sanchaaraya kirima (communication)**: While submarines might have communication capabilities, the passage focuses on their physical movement.
*   **C: wedi thaebeema (submerging)**:  Submerging is a capability, but the passage emphasizes its limited range of attack *while* moving.
*   **D: kriyaakara vima (operational effectiveness)**: Operational effectiveness is a result of many factors, not a primary capability in itself.

"mema chedayata anuwa, giwisumak ullanghanaya kale kawuda? ","The correct answer is **D: sowiyatwaru**.

The text clearly states: ""...soviyat polantha aakramanaya nokirime givisuma... soviyat samuhaandu ratu hamudaave sebalun 800,000 ta wadi praremanayak pivisa belarusiyaanu ha yukrena peramunu nirmanaya kala vita...""  This translates to ""...the Soviet invasion... the Soviet group sent a force of 800,000 to occupy Belarus and Ukraine..."".  Therefore, the Soviet Union was the one who violated Poland's borders.



"
rathu hamudawa wisin sidu nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: yukrena peramunak nirmanaya kirima**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""soviyat samuhaandu ratu hamudaave sebalun 800,000 ta wadi praremanayak pivisa belarusiyaanu ha yukrena peramunu nirmanaya kala vita..."" This directly translates to ""Soviet forces invaded and built a construction of Ukrainian territory...""  Option A accurately reflects this action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: naegenahira p‍radesha aak‍ramanaya kirima:** While the text mentions aggression in general, the specific detail about the 800,000 troops focuses on the *construction* of Ukrainian territory.
*   **C: paalama dige p‍rathisanwidhaanayak:** This refers to a constitution related to a bridge and is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: giwisumak ullanghanaya kirima:**  While aggression *is* a violation of international law, the passage highlights the specific action of building a construction, not just the general violation.

Therefore, **A** is the most precise and accurate answer based on the given text."

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...brithaanyayo itaali jaathika dasavana yudha injineru pradhaani general laestusi alla gathha. Juni masa 28 wanada, libiyave palaka general saha musolinige anupraaptikaya bhava penennata thibu marshal itaelo baelbo, torbuk wetha goda basina vita, ohuge paarsvaye ma athvaeradeemakin vedi vaedee marumuvata path vuye ya."" 
* This translates to: ""...the British brought in Italian wartime engineer chief general Lasrucci. On June 28th, Marshal Itaelo Baelbo, the Libyan commander and Mussolini's confidant, arrived near Tobruk, and the battlefront extended to its surroundings.""
* Therefore, Lasrucci, the Italian wartime engineer chief, was involved in the defense of Tobruk.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohu kaepuso kotuwe dee alla ganna ladee** (He was trying to capture a fortress). While capturing Tobruk *was* an objective, the text focuses on his role in *defending* it.
* **C: ohu b‍rithan‍yayan wisin alla ganna ladee** (He was trying to defeat the British).  The text doesn't state that his primary goal was to defeat the British. His role was as an engineer during the defense.
* **D: mith‍ra hamudawange wedi thaebeemakin ohu miya giyeya** (He was helping allied forces). The text doesn't mention him helping allied forces. He was an Italian general.



"
italo baelbo mara daemuwe koheda?,"The correct answer is **D: tobruk**.

The passage states: ""Juni masa 28 wanada, libiyave palaka general saha musolinige anupraaptikaya bhava penennata thibu marshal itaelo baelbo, torbuk wetha goda basina vita, ohuge paarsvaye ma athvaeradeemakin vedi vaedee marumuvata path vuye ya.""

This translates to: ""On June 28th, Marshal Italo Balbo, the deputy general and recipient of Mussolini's approval, moved his forces to the area near Tobruk, where the battle was raging.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, tibet bhawanawe vaedgath angayak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: yoga anga vinyasa praguna kireema.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kundalini yoga mangin yoga anga vinyasa, svasana abyaasa, mathra saha drushyamana kireem haraha kundalini shakthiya (sambodha shakthiya) avadi kere.""  This translates to ""Kundalini yoga, using yoga anga vinyasa, svasana practice, mantra recitation and visualization, awakens the kundalini power (awakening power).""

Option D directly reflects this statement. Let's look at why the other options are not the primary focus mentioned in that specific sentence:

*   **A: svasana abyaasa puhunu kireema (practicing relaxation pose):** While mentioned as part of the Kundalini yoga practice, it's listed *along with* other elements, not as the core component mentioned in that sentence.
*   **B: naewatha naewathath manth‍ra gayana kirima (reciting mantras):** Mantras are mentioned, but not the central element highlighted in the sentence about Kundalini awakening.
*   **C: devaganan daekima (seeing deities):** Seeing deities is part of Tibetan bhavana (meditation) and a way to gain power, but not the main component of the Kundalini awakening process described in the given sentence.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer because the text explicitly links yoga anga vinyasa to awakening kundalini power.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, tibet bhawanawe “madhyaya” thula chak‍ra sak‍reeya wanne keseda?","The correct answer is **B: dewathawan drushyamana kirimen (visualizing deities)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tibet bhawanawe madyaya wanne devataaviyage yogaaya. vividha devaganan daekima haraha shakti galaa yana maarga pirisidu we, chuckra sakreeya wee daenumwath bhawayen muktiyata paminima aethi karayi.""

This translates to: ""In Tibetan practice, the 'madhyama' is a yoga of visualizing deities.  The path to obtaining power is to visualize various deities, and to perform the circle ritual.""

Option B directly reflects this statement about visualizing deities being a key part of the ""madhyama"" practice and the path to power.  The other options, while potentially related to Tibetan Buddhism, are not specifically linked to the ""madhyama"" practice as described in the passage.
"
vaedasatahana atharathura dewana bhakthi geethaya idiripath kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: sanju sharma**.

The text states: ""Gaayaka sanju sharma sandyava aarambha kala athara in pasu jayi shankar chaudri paemina chapan bhog bhajan giyada idiripath kaleya."" This translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma started the devotional songs in the evening, singing the 'Chapan Bhog Bhajan' composed by Jayi Shankar Chaudri.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, aahara puja kirime dee bhakthi geethayak idiripath kale kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: lakkhaa sing**.

The text states: ""Inpasu, lakkha sing bhajana gayanaye pramukhasthaanaya gatteya."" which translates to ""Then, Laksha Sing took the main position in the bhajan singing.""
"
sandhyaa kaalaye dewana awasan vaedasatahana wuye kumakda?,"The question asks: ""sandhyaa kaalaye dewana awasan vaedasatahana wuye kumakda?"" which translates to ""Who performs in the evening in the residence, performing Vedic rituals?"". 

The passage describes various performances that took place at the Cirque du Soleil Nam Loka. Option A lists singers: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou. Option B mentions ""Fire of Anatolia,"" which is a dance performance. Option C mentions ""whirling dervishes,"" which is a performance style. Option D mentions Fatih Erkoç and Muslim Gürses, who are singers.

None of these options directly relate to Vedic rituals or performances in the evening. However, the passage states that the Cirque du Soleil Nam Loka *started* with a performance that involved ""janisari sangita kandaayamak anugamana kala"" (Janissary music accompanied by a performance art) and then later included Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina and Haris Alexiou singing. 

Since the question seems to be a bit of a trick and the context of Vedic rituals isn't directly present, let's analyze the options considering what the passage *does* mention.  While none fit perfectly, the most plausible answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina saha Haris aeleksiyo**. The passage specifically lists these singers as performers. The question is likely trying to test if you can extract the names of the singers mentioned within the provided text, even if the connection to Vedic rituals is missing.

Therefore, the best answer among the given options is **A**.



"
aelessaendro safinage jaathikathwaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: ithali**.

The text states: ""...italiyanu opera sangitagna alessandro safina..."" which translates to ""...Italian opera musician Alessandro Safina..."". Therefore, his nationality is Italian.
"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen sath‍ya nowanne kawaredaa?","The correct answer is **D: palamu pudgalayaa eyin iwath kirimata awama washayen miniththu 60k gatha wiya**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes a situation where a person (Clara) was injured due to a malfunctioning roller coaster system. Specifically, it mentions ""palamu pudgalayaa eyin iwath kirimata awama washayen miniththu 60k gatha wiya,"" which translates to ""the platform was damaged by a wash and 60k was spent on repairs.""  This directly relates to the cause of Clara's injury, as stated by Captain Scott Cons Paewasoowe.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: saenta klara hi ginnak aethi wiya (Clara said she was injured):**  While Clara was injured, the text focuses on *how* she was injured, not just that she was injured.
* **B: minisun rolar koostarayak thula siravi sitiyaha (the sun's roller coaster is a very good system):** This is the opposite of what the text implies. The system was *malfunctioning*.
* **C: mageenta jalaya labaa dena ladee (the magenta water-providing dummy):** This is irrelevant to the story and not mentioned in the text.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer because it pinpoints the specific detail about the platform damage caused by the malfunction, which led to the injury.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mahath apahasuthawayata path kala ushnathwa mattama gaena adhas daekwuye kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: gini niwana hamudawe kapithan** (the fire-fighting officer).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gini nivime hamuda kapithan scott cons paewasoowe..."" (Fire-fighting officer Captain Scott Cons Paewasoowe...)
* **The passage goes on to say:** ""...eya 90 ganan wala saanta klaaraavala ushnatvaya ihala agayaka pawathi unusuma dinayak woo bavayi."" ( ...he understood the heat of 90 and effectively extinguished the fire.)

The question asks who understands the heat and acts to extinguish the fire. This directly points to the fire-fighting officer mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dhaawana kriyaakaru (Runner/Athlete):**  There's no mention of a runner or athlete in the passage.
* **C: mageen (The person who caused the fire):** The passage describes how the fire was extinguished, not who started it.
* **D: polis p‍radhaaniyaa (Police Chief):** There's no mention of a police chief in the text.



"
sunami kriyaakaarakam hethuwen widuliya binda vaeteemak sidu wuye koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: tonga**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ema nisa ptwc magin nikuth kala sunaami anaturu haengavim labaagaenimata tongave baladhaarinta nohaeki woo bhava paewase."" This translates to: ""Because of this, the tsunami's destructive power didn't reach Tonga and also didn't cause damage.""

Therefore, the tsunami's destructive power was prevented from reaching **Tonga**. The question asks where the tsunami's destructive power *didn't* reach, which directly points to Tonga.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, tonga widuliya binda vaeteemen balapaemata lak wuye keseda?","The correct answer is **D: baladhaareenta adala anathuru aegavim labaa gaeneemata nohaeki wiya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tonga hi kisidu vishaala haani ho alaabha kisivak vaartha wee nomaeti namuth, viduli balaya thaavakalikava binda vaetuni."" This translates to: ""Tonga has caused huge losses, news of which has been reported widely, with power outages due to the tidal wave.""
* **The question asks:** ""mema chedayata anuwa, tonga widuliya binda vaeteemen balapaemata lak wuye keseda?"" This translates to: ""According to this, what is the reason for the power outage?""
* **Option D directly addresses the reason:**  ""baladhaareenta adala anathuru aegavim labaa gaeneemata nohaeki wiya"" translates to: ""The power grid could not withstand the tidal wave.""  This is the most logical deduction based on the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yam haaniyak vaartha wiya** - ""News of the damage"" - This is just a statement of fact, not a reason for the power outage.
* **B: iwath karana lada anathuru aegavim sambandhayen baladhaareenta p‍rawurthi laebune naetha** - ""There was no connection between the tidal wave and the power grid malfunction."" - The passage *explicitly* connects the tidal wave to the power outage.
* **C: muhudu mattame kiyavim walata balapaem aethi wiya** - ""It is said that the power outage occurred only for a short time."" - The passage doesn't mention the duration of the power outage.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately reflects the reason for the power outage as presented in the passage.



"
polisiyata owunge redar thuwakku bhawithakara jonee reedge riya paedavime wegaya maeneemata haeki wuye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: ohu paeyata kilomeetara 160 kata wada wegayen riya padwamin sitiyadee (He was driving at a speed of 160 kilometers per hour)**.

Here's why:

The question asks *when* Johnny Reed's speed was measured by the police radar. The text states: ""Rid mahatha, navasilantaye a1 gp motor rathaya wana black bituty, paeyata kilo meetara 160 kata wadi wegayen sath vatavak palama haraha gene yaamata samath viya. Black biyuty ketharam pahalin gaman kale da yat navasilanta polisiyata rid mahatage vegaya maeneema sandaha thama vega radar mevalam bhavitha kirimata nohaeki woo athara rid mahatha hasu kara gaenimata haeki woo ekama welawa vuye ohu paeyakata kilo meetara 160 dakva vegaya adu kala vita pamanayi.""

This translates to: ""However, the New Zealand police did not intend to use speed radar to measure Reed's speed, but he was driving the A1 GP motorcycle, Black Beauty, at a speed of 160 kilometers per hour, and at one time he reduced his speed to 160 kilometers per hour when he was approaching the bridge.""

Therefore, the radar measurement happened *while* he was driving at 160 kilometers per hour. Options A and D are incorrect because the text doesn't say that's *when* the radar was intended to be used or *when* he was approaching the bridge. Option B is incorrect because the text doesn't say he was driving at a speed while performing some action related to the bridge.



"
mema chedayata anuwa nawaseelantha polisiyata jonee reedge wegaya maeneema dushkara wanne aeyi?,"The correct answer is **A: ohu paeyata kilomeetara 160 ta adu wegayakin dhaawanaya karamin sitiyeya.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Rid mahatha, navasilantaye a1 gp motor rathaya wana black bituty, paeyata kilo meetara 160 kata wadi wegayen sath vatavak palama haraha gene yaamata samath viya. Black biyuty ketharam pahalin gaman kale da yat navasilanta polisiyata rid mahatage vegaya maeneema sandaha thama vega radar mevalam bhavitha kirimata nohaeki woo athara rid mahatha hasu kara gaenimata haeki woo ekama welawa vuye ohu paeyakata kilo meetara 160 dakva vegaya adu kala vita pamanayi.""

This translates to: ""Rid, the A1 GP motorcycle in New Zealand, known as Black Beauty, could reach a speed of 160 kilometers per hour on the viaduct. Black Beauty, during the first run, did not seem to be avoiding the New Zealand police's speed radar, and Rid seemed to laugh at the police and, in a clever way, when he reduced his speed from 160 kilometers per hour, he passed the measurement.""

The question asks *how* Rid managed to avoid the New Zealand police measuring his speed. The passage explicitly says he **reduced his speed from 160 kilometers per hour** when being measured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: motar rathaya itha pahath wiya (The motorcycle was that fast):** While the motorcycle *could* be that fast, the question isn't about its potential speed, but about *how* Rid avoided detection.
* **C: ohu paalama matha gaman kale hath wathawak pamani (He measured the speed for a while on the bridge):** The passage says he *passed* the measurement, not that he measured for a while.
* **D: okland waraya paalama itha paerani ya (The Auckland bridge is that long):** The length of the bridge isn't relevant to the question of how Rid avoided being measured.



"

The passage states: ""Bhumikampava kendhragatha vuye delan sita isaana desin kilometara 20 k (saethapum 15 k) saha butte sita kilo meetara 65 k (saethapum 40 k) dakunata ya.""  This translates to: ""The epicenter of the earthquake was located 20 km (15 km northeast) inland and 65 km (40 km deep).""  The question asks for the distance from the epicenter to the northeast.
"
abu grayibhi aethi wu koolahala atharathura sidu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: sirakaruwan apayojanaya kirima (carrying out the mission)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what Abu Ghraib's prisoners were tasked with doing. The first sentence of the passage states: ""Kaeraellak atharathura dee iraaqaye abu gharayib bandhanagarayata gini thabaa tibini. Eksath janapada hamudavan yatatata path woo pasuwa sirakaruvan apayojanaya kala bavata anaavaranaya weemen pasuwa mema sirageya apakirtiyata path viya.""

Translation: ""They were taken to the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. Together, the soldiers followed the path and carried out the mission, covering up the cruelty and immorality of this act.""

This indicates that the prisoners were instructed to carry out a mission, which is what option A states. The other options are not supported by the text."
iraka bandhanagara apakeerthiyata path wuye aeyi? ,"The correct answer is **A: eyata gini thabana ladee (Due to the torture they subjected them to)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states: ""Kaeraellak atharathura dee iraaqaye abu gharayib bandhanagarayata gini thabaa tibini. Eksath janapada hamudavan yatatata path woo pasuwa sirakaruvan apayojanaya kala bavata anaavaranaya weemen pasuwa mema sirageya apakirtiyata path viya."" This translates to: ""They took Kaeraellak (presumably referring to prisoners) to the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq and subjected them to torture. After the soldiers obtained their desired information, they humiliated them, and this became a disgrace.""

* Therefore, the main reason for the disgrace of Abu Ghraib prison was the torture inflicted on the prisoners.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eksath janapada hamuda palanaya labaa gathha (They obtained the desired information together):** While they did obtain information, the text emphasizes the method of obtaining it (torture) and the subsequent disgrace.
* **C: ehi kaerali gananawak aethi wiya (Because they were being counted):** The text doesn't mention counting as a reason for the disgrace.
* **D: sira karuwan apayojanaya kirima pilibanda soyaagaeneema (Due to the soldiers' desire to achieve their goals):** While the soldiers' goals were part of the process, the text highlights the torture *as the means* to achieve those goals, leading to the disgrace.



"

Here's why:

* The question states that the Pudgalayan event regularly features musical performances.
* The prompt mentions ""yudha anusmarana kridanganayehi vaedasatahana sangita kandaayama visin avalangu karana laduva"" which translates to ""regularly organizes musical events at the war memorial"".
* The options describe different types of events, and ""sangeetha prasangayak"" directly translates to a musical event.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the regular activity described in the question.

"awasana washayen, mema siduvima awalangu kirima sambandhayen paehaedili kirimak labaa dunne kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: sangeetha kandayama (music academy)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the result of the musical performance (kalamanakarana samagama) was. The text explicitly states that the musical academy (""sangeetha kandayama"") will receive the proceeds from the event.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kalamanakarana samagama (musical performance)** is the event itself, not the recipient of the proceeds.
*   **C: yudha anusmarana kreedanganaye ayithikaru (war memorial sports club)** is the venue where the event took place, not the recipient of the proceeds.
*   **D: rasikayin (fans)** are the audience, and while they enjoy the performance, they aren't the ones receiving the money.



"
bishkekhi nevasikayin keepa denek mankollayata wagakiwa yuththe kawurundaeyi sithuwe da?,"The correct answer is **C: wirodhathakaruwan (opponents)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Bishkek nevaasikayan kihipa denek dakunen paemini virodhatakaruvange nitiyata garu nokirima sambandhava chodana kale ya.""  This translates to ""...Bishkek residents' ability to give a positive response regarding the consistency of the policies of opponents is in question.""

Therefore, the question asks who the ""opponents"" being referred to are.  The passage directly identifies them as ""virodhatakaruvange"" which means ""of the opponents"" or ""opponents.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: neethiya balathmaka karana niladhaareen (political-ideological principles):** While policies are based on principles, the question is about *who* is being opposed, not the principles themselves.
* **B: welandasael himiyan (unorganized groups):**  The passage doesn't describe the opponents as unorganized.
* **D: yawwanayan (young people):**  The passage doesn't specify the opponents are young people.



"
dakune wirodhathakaruwanta mankollakaema pilibandawa dos paewaruwe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: bishkek nevasikayin**.

Here's why:

The question asks who the Bishkek residents are discussing the political stance of the opposition regarding. The text states: ""Bishkek nevaasikayan kihipa denek dakunen paemini virodhatakaruvange nitiyata garu nokirima sambandhava chodana kale ya."" This translates to ""Bishkek residents are discussing the political stance of the opposition regarding their consistency in action.""

Therefore, the Bishkek residents are discussing the opposition's political stance. Therefore, the correct answer is **Bishkek nevasikayin** (Bishkek residents). The other options are related to aspects of the discussion, but not *who* is being discussed.
"

The text states: ""2013 dee pradarsana kandaayama mudal labaa deema navata daemuu shak taenk kathaangaye ohu penee siteemen pasuwa vikunum ihala giya bavayi."" This translates to: ""From 2013, he started to earn money by offering shake tank and a private system.""  Therefore, the growth in his earnings was due to offering both shake tank and a private system.
"
jemi siminof ring aarambha kirimata theeranaya kale kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: aramudal labaa gaeneemen pasu (After obtaining capital)**.

The text states: ""Siminof paewasuwe 2013 dee pradarsana kandaayama mudal labaa deema navata daemuu shak taenk kathaangaye ohu penee siteemen pasuwa vikunum ihala giya bavayi."" which translates to: ""Siminof started showing potential in 2013 after obtaining capital, and he started to work on a more developed system.""

This indicates that securing the initial capital was a crucial step before he could move forward with developing his system and ultimately launching his television channel.
"

When Buffalo (the original name) John Grant published it, he believed that [educational television] could guide students to read the original book...John Grant, after believing this, started creating learning programs on educational television, and became a driving force in finishing the work.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions ""adyapana rupavahini vaedasatahankaranaye darshanaya venas weema yana dekama"" which means ""seeing the vision of educational television programs"".  This indicates that educational television is the source of guidance about the fought book.
"
reeding reyinbo malawa awalangu kirimata dayaka vi thibiya haekke kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: jon grantge mathaya**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes how John Grant's research, publications, and television programs helped to spread the understanding of Vedic science and the principles of the Rainbow Healing method. The text specifically states, ""John Grant aetulu samaharun visvaasa karanne aramudal sampaadanaye gaetalu saha adyapana rupavahini vaedasatahankaranaye darshanaya venas weema yana dekama, vaedasatahan malava avasan kirimata dhaayaka woo bavayi."" This translates to: ""John Grant, after studying and believing, contributed to the spread of the vision of Vedic science and the teaching through publications and educational television programs, becoming a pioneer in the practice of Vedic science.""

Therefore, John Grant's teachings and work are directly linked to the spread of Rainbow Healing. The other options are not supported by the text.

This translates to: ""The city of Amsterdam and the Anne Frank House, by offering a place to listen to stories, are a source of comfort for the public, even though it is a place of sadness and sorrow.""

The text explicitly says the Anne Frank House is a source of comfort for the public.  The other options are not directly supported by the text:

* **A: eya anivaryayenma vaetenu aetha (It necessarily exists):** While likely, the text doesn't explicitly state its existence is *necessary*.
* **B: eya sanrakshanaya kala yuthuya (It fights for preservation):**  The text doesn't discuss preservation efforts.
* **C: eya pus wargayakin aasadhanaya vi aetha (It is a source of spiritual sustenance):**  While it *can* be spiritual, the text focuses more on the comfort and public benefit.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and directly supported answer.

Here's why:

The passage states that David O'Shea, the RSPCA's principal investigator, strongly advocates for the installation of CCTV cameras to monitor animal welfare and deter cruelty. The whole passage revolves around CCTV cameras being a key solution. Therefore, the answer is CCTV cameras.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ostreliyaanu satva ghaathakaagara kamkaruwanta sathwa subhasadhanaye vaedgathkama thahawuru kirimata upakaaree wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV kaemara sthaapanaya kirima**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the RSPCA advocates for CCTV camera installations to help prevent animal cruelty by providing evidence and deterring perpetrators.
* The passage highlights David O'Shea's (RSPCA's lead investigator) belief that CCTV cameras are a powerful tool in gathering evidence and deterring animal abusers.

Therefore, installing CCTV cameras is the action directly linked to helping prevent animal cruelty, according to the passage. The other options are either actions taken by the RSPCA (B, C) or media coverage (D), but the core solution mentioned is CCTV.

* **A: shish‍yayaku** (a student) - The passage mentions a child being involved in the events, but it doesn't identify the reporter as the child.
* **C: goth‍rika sabhapathiwarayek** (a tribal president) -  While the tribal president is mentioned, the reporter is identified as being *from* the tribal president's family, not *being* the tribal president.
* **D: red lek adhikaariyak** (Red Lake official) -  The passage mentions an official, but it doesn't state that the reporter is an official.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the ""avaamangalya uthsavaya"" (wedding ceremony) was *for*.
* The passage states that the wedding ceremony was for the *newlywed* (nawa deneku) couple.
* The passage mentions that the wedding took place amidst a significant social and political situation in Red Lake.

Therefore, the wedding was for the newlywed couple.

* While Germany is mentioned as having protests, the text specifically highlights Poland's nationwide strike *because* of ACTA.
* The other options (Scotland, Lithuania) are mentioned as having protests in general, but not directly tied to ACTA protests in the same way Poland is.



Therefore, Poland is the country explicitly mentioned as protesting ACTA.

"mema chedayata anuwa, ACTA ha sambandha vime kriyaawaliya kal daemeemata theeranaya kale pahatha sandahan ratawal athurin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: laetwiyaawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Latviyava saha slovaekiyava yana dekama acta samaga sambandhaweeme kriyaavaliya pramaada kara atha."" This translates to ""Latvia and Slovakia are taking cautious steps regarding the agreement.""

The question asks which country has taken steps regarding ACTA and related activities.  Latvia is specifically mentioned as one of the countries taking these steps.
"
aipod adhika lesa rath vime anathura hethuwen kopamana pirisak thuvala laebee da?,"The correct answer is **D: 34**.

The text states: ""Pasugiya sathiye meti nivedanaya kale aepal visin thavat adhikava rath weeme siduvim **34** k pilibandava daenum dee thibu athara..."" which translates to ""According to the investigation, the amount of water absorbed by apples was **34** times more than usual..."". The question asks what the cause of the increased water absorption in iPods was, and the text directly links it to the apples.  Therefore, 34 is the number referring to the increased water absorption, a key piece of information explaining the issue.
"
adhika lesa rath vime siduvima etharam barapathala ekak nowana bawa keewe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **D: aepal samagama (apple company)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pasugiya sathiye meti nivedanaya kale aepal visin thavat adhikava rath weeme siduvim 34 k pilibandava daenum dee thibu athara, samaagama visin eya """"barapathala novena"""" lesa haedinvu bavayi.""

This translates to: ""Regarding the company, it is said that the apple company has achieved 34 times more growth in revenue than expected, and the company has also become a leader in the ""Barapathala Novena"" sector.""

Therefore, the question asks what *new* company became a leader in the ""Barapathala Novena"" sector, and the passage explicitly states it was the **apple company (aepal samagama)**.
"
"ohuge kathawa atharathura, steev jobs aepal naewatha soyaa gaeneemata yana bawa paewasuwe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: ithihasaya (history)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what Steve Jobs was trying to *build* by making an apple out of soy. His quote ""ada ithihasaya nirmaanaya kirimatayi yanne"" translates to ""we are trying to build history.""  Therefore, he was focused on creating a historical significance, not a financial gain, or a common activity, or a quick solution.
"
steev jobsge paeya dekaka kathawe aramuna wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: nawa durakathanayak diyath kirima (creating a new story/narrative)**.

Here's why:

The provided text says: ""Ada aepal visin durakathanaya naewatha soyagenimatayi soodaanam wanne, api ada ithihasaya nirmaanaya kirimatayi yanne"" which translates to ""We have created a new story for Apple, we are building history.""

Steve Jobs is quoted as saying they created a ""new story"" for Apple. This directly relates to option C.
"
aajantina wedikaawe dee kristina fernaendas di kirchnar niwedanaya kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: aege janadhipathiwarana apek‍shakathwaya**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""sandaha aege janadhipati apekshakathvaya nivedana kaala ya."" This translates to ""she submitted a declaration of candidacy for president.""
* **Option A directly reflects this statement.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: senet sabhawa sandaha tharaga kirimata wu aege abhip‍raya:** This translates to ""her opinion on submitting a declaration to the Senate."" While related, the passage focuses on the *declaration of candidacy* itself, not just her opinion on submitting it.
* **C: buwanos ayares palaath niyojitha kandayama sandaha aege maethiwarana p‍rachaaraka wyaaparaya:** This translates to ""the campaign business conducted in the Buenos Aires province."" The passage mentions a campaign, but it's presented as context for her candidacy declaration, not the main point.
* **D: wathman senet sabhika dhurayen illa asvime aege saelaesuma:** This translates to ""there is no evidence of the current Senate's role."" This is completely unrelated to the passage.



"
kristina fernaendas di kirchnar janadhipathiwaranayata tharaga kirimata wu aege abhip‍raya niwedanaya kale koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: la plata walin saethapum 31k aethin pihiti ragahalaka**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...buvanors aires sita kilometres 50 k (saethapum 31 k) durin pihiti lae platavedi..."" which translates to ""...in Buenos Aires, 31 kilometers (approximately) from La Plata..."" and ""...janadhipati apekshakathvaya nivedana kaala ya."" (the time of presenting her candidacy for presidency).

The question asks *where* the opinion survey about Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's presidential candidacy was conducted. The passage directly links the opinion survey to a location near La Plata. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: la plata hi buwanos ayares ragahale dee** - This is incorrect. The passage says La Plata is *near* Buenos Aires, not *in* Buenos Aires.
*   **C: buwanos ayares sita saethapum 31k aethin pihiti aarjantina ragahale dee** - This is incorrect because the passage clarifies that the survey was near La Plata, not directly in Buenos Aires. Also, it's unclear if the survey was conducted *in Argentina* in general.
*   **D: buwanos ayares hi la plata ragahale dee** - This is incorrect; it reverses the relationship between the two cities.



"
big b‍radar sambandhayen ACMA hi soyaagaeneem monavada?,"The correct answer is **A: varana neethi ullanghanaya kara nomaetha**

Here's why:

* **The question asks what ACMA (Antharjaala Anthargatha Lesa Saelakima Sandaha) refers to in relation to Big Brother.** The provided text states that ACMA is related to ""varana neethi ullanghanaya kara nomaeti bhava acma visin soyaa ganna ladi"" which translates to ""fighting against the unethical behavior of discrimination.""
* **Option A directly reflects this meaning:** ""varana neethi ullanghanaya kara nomaetha"" means ""unethical behavior of discrimination.""
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * B describes Big Brother's actions, not what ACMA *is*.
    * C is too general and doesn't capture the specific context.
    * D describes a method of hiding, not the nature of the unethical behavior.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and relevant answer based on the provided text."
antharjala anthargathayak lesa saelakeemata madhya sapuraliya yuthu paramitheen monavada?,"The correct answer is **A: eya antharjalaye wikaashayakara thibiya yuthuya (It is a conflict occurring within the internet).**

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the nature of the conflict regarding internet development.** The text states that Big Brother is trying to control and regulate internet development, leading to a conflict.
* **Option A directly addresses this:** It states the conflict is happening within the internet itself.
* **Option B is incorrect:** While Big Brother might try to hide physical servers, the core of the conflict is about control over the internet *itself*, not just physical infrastructure.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The text explicitly states Big Brother is using web ads and other methods for control, so it's not just about preventing web ads.
* **Option D is incorrect:** While ACMA's approval is mentioned, the fundamental issue is the conflict over internet development and control, not just about whether ACMA gives permission.



"
ostreliyaanu libaral pak‍shaye nayakayaa kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: jon hovad**.

The text states: ""Ostreliyanu bhandagarika saha liberal paksha naayakaya lesa... john howardge..."" which translates to ""The leader of the Australian conservative and liberal party... John Howard...""
"
ostreliyaawata daenatamath n‍yashtika balashakthi karmanthayak nomaethi wanne aeyi?,"The correct answer is **C: itha anathurudayaka vima (atheistic force)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Peter Costello believes atheistic forces are behind the secular forces in Australia.  He says the atheistic force is a significant, future, potentially war-like power.  He also implies this force is opposed to religious fundamentalism and motivated by economic gain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mahajana sahaya nomaethi vima (humanitarian force):** While the text mentions economic gain, it doesn't frame it as purely humanitarian. Costello emphasizes the power and potential for conflict.
* **B: itha mathabhedathmaka deyak vima (religious sectarian force):** The text *contrasts* atheism with religious fundamentalism; it doesn't identify atheism *as* a religious sectarian force.
* **D: itha mila adhika vima (moral/ethical force):** While there's a discussion of fundamental opposition, the framing is more about a power dynamic and economic motivation rather than a strictly moral one.



Therefore, the most accurate representation of what Costello believes is that **atheistic forces** are driving the secular changes in Australia.



"
margopadeshaka upakaarayen tharaga kala skee kreedaka kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: mesig kresell**.

The text states: ""Polantaye drushyaabaadhitha ski kridaka masieg kresell siya manga penwaniya wana aena ogarinska samaga pirimi super-jee hee dahatun waennata sampurna kale ya."" This translates to: ""In Poland, the visually impaired skier, Masieg Kresell, with his wife, completely completed the pyramid super-jee together.""

Therefore, Masieg Kresell is the skier mentioned.
"
kaantha hiti supar-ji panthiye dhawana sthaanaya labaa gath rata kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: Nedarlanthaya**.

The text states: ""E atharata, super-jee kaantha panthiye navaveniya lesa avasan kala aena josemsen sitina nedarlanthaya saha ema isavvema dahavaeniyaa lesa avasan kala katjaa saarinen sitina finlanthaya aetulatya."" This translates to ""Therefore, the Netherlands, where Josemsen, who is known for super-jee, recently became a local, and Finland, where Katjaa Saarinen, who also recently became a local, also competed...""

Therefore, the Netherlands is one of the countries mentioned where a person known for ""super-jee"" recently became a local.

"mema chedayata anuwa, blek gaena niwaeredi nowana p‍rakaashaya kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: ohu ema sthaanayedeema ath adanguwata gena thibe (He was in that position, on the lookout)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ema sthaanayedi ath adanguvata path woo idiripath karannaa..."" which translates to ""He was on the lookout in that position...""
* The last sentence confirms this: ""Vinisuruvaraya bleikta paewasuwe ohuva sirageyata niyama weema """"hudekma novaelakiya haekkak"""" woo bavayi."" which means ""The police officer, speaking to Black, instructed him to ""be on the lookout"" or ""watch out.""

Therefore, option A directly reflects the information provided in the passage.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, blekta sidu nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: adhikarana kriyaawaliya mulaa kirimata uthsaha kirima sambandhayen ohu vaeradikaru wiya** (He sentenced him for encouraging the commission of offenses).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Adhikarana kriyaavaliya mulaa kirimata uthsaha kireema sambandhavada bleik vaeradikaru karana ladi."" This translates to ""He sentenced him for encouraging the commission of offenses.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ohu ath adanguwata ganna ladee** (He sentenced him to a fine): The text mentions a fine, but it's a consequence of the sentencing for encouraging offenses, not the primary action.
* **C: ohuta pollakin pahara dena ladee** (He sentenced him to a beating): The text mentions a beating as a *potential* action the officer *would have* taken, but it's not what he *actually* did.
* **D: ohuta ohu sirayata yawanu aethi bawa pawasanu laebeeya** (He was able to get the money he had in his pocket): This is completely unrelated to the sentencing and the content of the text.



"
eksath jaatheenge goleeya unusum vimen balapaemata lakwana ratawalata udaw kirima sandaha wu aramudala bhawitha nokaranne kumak sandahada?,"The correct answer is **C: ganwathurata oroththu dena nivasa (Providing housing to everyone in Ganvathur)**.

Here's why:

The question asks which of the listed options relates to the initial statement about cooperative efforts (eksath jaatheenge goleeya unusum) and providing support to the nation. The initial statement mentions providing housing as a key area of focus.

*   **C** directly reflects this point.
*   **A** (boga wiwidhaangeekaranaya - diversification of income) is a good goal, but not the specific area mentioned in the initial text.
*   **B** (sanwardhanaya wemin pawathina jaatheenta thaakshanaya raegena ema - increasing the quality of the nation's production) is related to economic growth, but not explicitly mentioned as a primary focus.
*   **D** (goleeya ushnathwaya ihala yaamen aethiwana balapaem samanaya kirima - balancing the cooperative's heat by implementing a balanced power) is a metaphorical and less direct connection to the initial statement.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer because it aligns with the provided context.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, eksath janapadaya aarakshaa kirimata balaporoththu wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: thaakshanaya beda gaeneema haraha mudal (all kinds of waste management)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is necessary to jointly protect the community through a struggle?"" (memachedayata anuwa, eksath janapadaya aarakshaa kirimata balaporoththu wanne kumakda?)
* **The provided text states:** ""Eksath jaathin balapaem paalana kirimata goleeya unusum weemen balapaemata lak woo ratawalata udavu kirimata aramudalaka thiranaya avasan kirimata da balaporottu wei. Ganvathurata oroththu dena nivaasa, vadaa yahapath jala kalamanaakaranaya saha boga vividhaangikaranaya sandahaa mudal yedaviya haekiya. **Thaakshanaya beda gaeneema haraha mudal**...""  This directly links waste management to the need for joint efforts and resources for community protection and development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: boga (resources/wealth):** While resources are important, the text specifies *waste management* as a key resource.
* **C: ithiriwa aethi vaesi wananthara (future generations/descendants):**  Protecting future generations is a goal, but not the *necessary action* to jointly protect the community *through a struggle*.
* **D: durwala jala kalamanakaranaya nisawen peedawata path janathawa (poor water management leading to suffering people):** Poor water management is a *problem*, but not the *solution* or *necessary action* to jointly protect the community through a struggle. It's a consequence, not the root cause requiring joint effort.

aelbat muchanga wisin thawamath ekaga wiya yuthu deyak lesa sandahan nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: welandama aarambha kala haeki dinaya (The date the implementation started)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what Albert Muchanga, the African Union Commissioner for Trade and Economic Development, has been discussing. The text states: ""2020, July 1 dina sita velandaama aarambha kireema sandahaa apata aethi raamuva pramanavath wana baev komasaarisvaraya paewaseeya."" This translates to ""Regarding the implementation starting on July 1, 2020, he (Muchanga) has been discussing the progress of the customs union.""

Therefore, the implementation date of the AfCFTA is the central topic of Muchanga's discussions. The other options are related but not the primary focus of his discussions as highlighted in the text.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, juli masayedee welandama aarambha kala haekke aeyi?","Correct answer is **D: mularambhaka neethi saha badu sahana pilibandawa ekagathawayakata paemina aetha.**

Here's why:

The question asks when the agreement started. The text states: ""2020, juuli 1 dina sita velandaama aarambha kireema sandahaa..."" which translates to ""Starting from July 1, 2020, the agreement started.""

Option D accurately reflects this information: ""mularambhaka neethi saha badu sahana pilibandawa ekagathawayakata paemina aetha"" means ""starting from the initial policy and the agreement on mutual cooperation."" This captures the start date mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While Nigeria was involved, the question asks *when the agreement started*, not who was involved.
* **B:**  The text doesn't explicitly state that AU approval was needed.
* **C:** The text doesn't state that Benin was the one to get AU approval.

"mema chedayata anuwa, aetlanta jarnal-kanstitiyshan wisin adhyaapana niladhaareenta kala chodnawa kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: anawaranaya karagath abhyanthara gaetalu sambandhayen kisidu kriyaamargayak nogaeneema** (Implementing a strategy related to internal assessment).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Atlanta's situation:** Atlanta faced issues with newspaper distortions regarding exam scores and internal assessment. This led to a lack of trust and difficulties in civic education.
* **The question asks how to improve civic education:**  The question focuses on how to address these issues and enhance civic education.
* **Option C directly addresses the core problem:**  Implementing a strategy related to internal assessment directly tackles the problem of unreliable information and lack of trust surrounding internal evaluations. It focuses on improving the assessment process itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jarnal-kanstitiyshan vaarthawa wikurthi kirima** (Distorting newspaper constitutional news): This is *part of the problem*, but it doesn't offer a *solution* to improve civic education.
* **B: nagarika adhyaapanaya nawyakaranaya kirimata apohosath vima** (A complete overhaul of civic education):  While an overhaul *might* be necessary eventually, the passage suggests a more targeted approach is needed, starting with addressing the internal assessment issues.
* **D: adu pareekshana lakunu vaartha kirima** (Publicizing exam scores): This could be a contributing factor to the problems described, but not a solution. It might even exacerbate the issue if the scores are unreliable.



Therefore, option C is the most logical and appropriate answer based on the passage."
"mema chedaye sandahan thorathuru walata anuwa, aetlanta jarnal-kanstitiyshan vaarthawe sandahan nowanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: pareekshana pathrikaa magadiyak vi aethi bawata saak‍shi (Witness to the news about the examination paper)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Aya was a witness to the news about the examination paper leak in the Atlanta Journal. She provided information related to the paper leak and internal processes.
* Option A is incorrect because while she had good exam scores, the question asks about her connection to the *news* about the paper leak, not her scores.
* Option C refers to the award she received, but the question asks about her connection to the news.
* Option D describes a broader reform project, not her specific involvement related to the news leak.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
mema chedayata anuwa bomba p‍raharayen pasuwa daenagatha haeki wu thorathuru monavada?,"The correct answer is **A: thuvala laebu ayage awasan sankyaawa (The number of people who received treatment)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what number of people should be in the hospital after the bomb attack. The text states that 30 people were treated (labaa aethi bhava vaartha karana namuth saebae samkhyaava thawamath nodani - though the news reported 30, the actual number is unknown). Therefore, the most logical answer is the number of people who received treatment, which is 30.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: bomba pupura giye kumana godanaegili asala da yana bawa (The number of people who were initially injured)**: The text doesn't provide the initial number of injuries.
*   **C: thawath amathara bomba pupurava haereemata thibeda yana bawa (The number of people who might be injured later)**: While this is a possibility, the question asks for the number *after* the attack, implying the immediate aftermath and those who received care.
*   **D: nila marana sankyaawa (The number of deaths)**: The text doesn't mention the number of deaths, only the number of people treated.

Therefore, the answer **A** is the most accurate based on the information given."

The passage states: ""...gola 24 k res karagena atha"" which translates to ""...scored 24 goals"".  This refers to the number of goals Manchester City scored in the 2017 January match.
"
kumana kreeda samajayata ek vima sandaha pavum miliyana 27 ka gasthuwak jesusta laebuneda?,"The correct answer is **A: paelmiyaras (footballers)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what *type* of sports community had 27 million people involved with the sale of 21 million ""brasiliyaanu club paelmiyaras"" (Brazilian club footballers).
* The text explicitly states the sale was of Brazilian club footballers.  Therefore, the sports community involved is **footballers**.
* Options B, C, and D refer to specific football clubs (Manchester City, Cruzeiro, Manchester United) but don't represent the broader sports community dealing with the sale of footballers.
"
nevasikaagara amuththan gaena sath‍ya nowana p‍rakaashaya wanne kawaredaa?,"The correct answer is **A: amuththan makkaawe wandna gamanak sandaha paemina sitiyaha**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the true reason the resident (amuththan) went to Mecca (Makka)?
* **The passage states:** ""Hajj vandanaa gamana sandahaa pujaniya nagaraya wetha paemini wandanakaruwan gananavak mema godanaegille navaathaengena sitiyaha."" This translates to: ""He went to the holy city to perform the pilgrimage (Hajj) and to worship there.""
* **Option A directly reflects this statement.**  It says the resident went to Mecca to perform the pilgrimage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: samahara amuththo desheeya puravaesiyan nowuha** (The resident was a famous traveler in the country): While he *might* have been a traveler, the passage focuses on his pilgrimage. It doesn't explicitly state he was *famous* for travel.
* **C: haj dinata pera sawasa amuththan ehi sitiyaha** (The resident went to Mecca during the Hajj days for a short trip): The passage indicates a longer stay (15 days). It doesn't mention a ""short trip.""
* **D: amuththangen bahutharaya shuddha nagaraye sita paemini ayayi** (The resident went to the holy city to stay in a very clean place): The passage focuses on pilgrimage and worship, not specifically on the cleanliness of the city.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin niwaeredi wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: siyaluma amuththan eksath arabi emeer rajyaye sita paemini ayayi** (all the pilgrims stayed together in the Arab emirate).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nevaasikaagarayak kadaa vaetini... boho durata eksath arabi emir rajyaye puravaesiyan vuha."" This translates to ""A residential camp was set up... a large number of pilgrims stayed together in the Arab emirate, far away.""
* **The question asks:** ""What happened to the pilgrims in that situation?""
* **Option B directly reflects the information provided** in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kisiweku miya giye naetha** (nothing happened): The passage implies something *did* happen – the pilgrims were in a remote location.
* **C: haj wandna gamanata pera sawasa amuththan ehi sitiyaha** (a large number of pilgrims stayed in the hope of going on Hajj):  The passage states they *did* stay, but not necessarily *in the hope* of going on Hajj. It's a more factual statement.
* **D: amuththangen bahutharaya makkaa p‍radeshavaseen wiya** (a large number of pilgrims visited Mecca): The passage says they were in the Arab emirate, *far away* from Mecca, and that they hadn't yet reached Mecca.



"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, gaeteema pilibanda awinishchitha nowana thorathuru kawaredaa?","The correct answer is **C: pruthiwiya matha ema gaeteeme balapaema** (the power of this comet to Earth).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the comet's ""vishaala ekak woo bavata vidyaagnayin pawasai"" (a scientific power of immense size). It further mentions the scientists' eagerness to analyze its ability to ""pruthuwiyata vanu aethi balapaema kumakda yanna thiranaya kirimata"" (determine the power it will have when it approaches Earth).
* The passage emphasizes the potential impact of the comet's power on Earth.
* While the comet's size (A) and location (B) are mentioned, the main focus of the scientists' analysis and excitement revolves around the potential impact (power) on Earth.
* The involvement of the local police and the ""sunbun wala pihiteema"" (sunshine from the sun) is mentioned as part of the broader investigation, but it's not the primary uncertainty regarding the comet's nature.



Therefore, the question asks what is uncertain about the comet, and the passage highlights the uncertainty about the *power it will have when it approaches Earth*. Option C directly addresses this uncertainty.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mema gaeteema sambandhayen thawamath theeranaya kala yuthu de wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: sunbun luhubaendeema palanaya karanne kawuda** (What is the result of the joint community approach?).

Here's why:

The passage describes a successful joint community effort between the local police and the community approach force. The analysis of this joint effort yielded positive results. The question asks what the result of this joint effort *was*. Option A directly addresses this, asking about the outcome of the collaborative approach.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: gaetena awasthaawe dee chandrikaa ketharam wegayen gaman karamin sitiyeda (Is Chandrika traveling at a high speed in that state?)**: This option is irrelevant to the passage. It's about Chandrika's speed, which isn't mentioned.
* **C: wishleshanaye p‍rathiphala beda ganna aakaaraya (The form of dividing the analysis results)**:  While the passage mentions analysis results, it doesn't discuss how they were divided.
* **D: binda vaeteeme nishchitha parimanaya (A fixed quantity of the point team)**: This is about the size of a team, not the result of the joint effort.



Therefore, option A is the only one that logically follows from the passage and answers the question.

"mema chedayata anuwa, baetan warak dhanawathma aemarikaanuwange laeyisthuwe athkaragena siti sthaanaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: 190 vaeni**.

The passage states: ""2008 dee dhanavatma aemarikaanuvan 400 denaa athara baetan 190 veni sthaanaya labaa gaththe ya."" This translates to ""In 2008, among the wealthiest Americans, 190 ranked in the top 400.""

Therefore, the answer is 190 vaeni.
"
baetan parith‍yaaga kale pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarak sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **A: dhanawathma aemarikaanuwange laeyisthuwa (Wealthy Americans' altruism)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that in 2008, 400 wealthy Americans donated a total of $190 billion to a specific institution. This act of donating such a large sum to a charitable cause exemplifies altruism – selfless concern for the well-being of others.  The passage explicitly links this act to the wealth of the donors.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Warjiniyaa wishwa widyaalaya (Virginia University):** While the institution mentioned in the passage is linked to Virginia University, the primary focus of the question is the *reason* for the donations, not the university itself.
* **C: Saelakiya yuthu aayathana sankyaawak (Number of self-defense institutions):**  There's no mention of self-defense institutions in the passage.
* **D: Kala ha widyaa sandaha wu widyaala (University related to art and education):** While the institution is related to art and education, the main point regarding the donations is the motivation behind them.



Therefore, the question asks ""What is the reason behind the abandonment of a large amount of money?"" The passage indicates that the motivation is the altruism of wealthy Americans.

Here's why:

* The question asks what Arnold Schwarzenegger's actions relate to.
* The provided text describes Schwarzenegger's efforts to ban the distribution of violent video games to minors in California.
* Option C accurately reflects this core action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kaelifoniyaawa pura bala wayaskaruwanta darunu vidiyo kreeda wikineema ho kuliyata deema thahanam kirima** - This is partially correct but doesn't specify *who* is trying to stop it.
* **B: waradkaruwan sandaha mudalin dada** - This refers to the fine, not the action itself.

"mema chedayata anuwa, kiyanu labana dewal maga haeriye kawuda?","The correct answer is **D: dooval**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""mema chedayata anuwa, kiyanu labana dewal maga haeriye kawuda?"" which translates roughly to ""What is the thing that is being given out, and which is being sought after?"".

The provided text talks about ""doovalge daruwan"" (dooval's son/offspring) and mentions that it's associated with a wedding and a large gathering.  The final sentence explicitly states ""doovalge daruwan pawasuwe ya"" meaning ""Dooval's offspring is [something]"".

Therefore, ""dooval"" is the most likely answer, referring to the offspring (son/daughter) of Dooval.  The context suggests something significant is happening *because of* Dooval's offspring, making it the object of the question.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nadu wibhagaye dee milarge athdaekeem pilibanda sath‍ya wanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin monavada?","Let's break down the Sinhala text. It's heavily distorted, likely due to a transcription error or a deliberate attempt to obfuscate. However, we can piece together some potential meaning.

The overall tone suggests a conversation about someone named ""Dee Miller"" and a significant event. The phrases ""vaedihiti daruvan dedeneku sahithava vivaaha woo duval"" and ""vishaala haengimak aethi kale naetha"" hint at a marriage or significant ceremony.  The repetition of ""naetha"" suggests it happened in the past. The mention of ""emin city baevin ohu pavasamin city deya mata aeththatama aesune naetha"" indicates someone traveled between two cities, possibly related to Dee Miller.

Now let's analyze the options in light of this fragmented understanding:

*   **A: nadu wibhagaye dee dooval milar kerehi haegeemak aethi kaleya (In the central province, Dee Miller performed a significant ceremony).** This seems plausible. ""Nadu wibhagaye"" (central province) could refer to the location of the event.  ""Kerehi haegeemak aethi kaleya"" (performed a significant ceremony) aligns with the mentions of marriage/ceremony and ""vishaala haengimak.""

*   **B: ohu sudanam wemin sitiya dee ohu awadhaanaya yomu kale naetha (He/She did not pay attention to the auspicious time in the famous city).** This is less likely. The text hints at Dee Miller being involved in the auspicious time, so this option contradicts the apparent context.

*   **C: doovalge daruwan dedena nadu wibhagaye dee boho de pilibandawa katha kalaha (The story of Dee Miller's children is a false conversation in the central province).** This option is less connected to the initial description and the context doesn't show any mention of children.

*   **D: ohu doovalge kathawa kerehi daedi awadhaanayak yomu karamin sitiyeya (He/She did not pay attention to the story in the city).** This is less plausible since the text indicates Dee Miller and/or her story is significant.

Therefore, the most reasonable answer, considering the limited and distorted information, is **A**.

**Final Answer: (A)**"
'pirisidu vaya panatha' sanshodhanaya kala yuthu bawata yojana kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: Jon Howards**.

The text explicitly states: ""Enamuth agamaeti john howaard pavasaa sitiye..."" which translates to ""In any case, the 'pirisidu vaya panatha' research was initiated by John Howard...""
"
“pirisidu vayu panatha” purwa maethiwarana p‍rodawak lesa bhawitha karana bawa wu wiwechanaya p‍rathik‍shepa kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: prantha rajaye niladhaariyaa (Regional Governor)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...siyalu paksha kamituva wetha samalochanaya sandahaa yaevimata ekagha wee thibe. 'Agamaeti samaga pawathi hamuvakadi, letan kansarvetivvarunge parisara panath ketumpathata venaskam illaa sitiye, kansarvetiv pakshaye parisara panath ketumpata """"""""nawatha sampurnayen """""""" liyanu lesa illimeni."" This indicates the Regional Governor opposed the ""pirisidu vayu panatha"" (super fuel) project.

The following sentence explains the context of the opposition: ""Federal rajaya tasmeniyaawe devenpot hi marse rohalata aramudal sapayima bhaaragenimata piyavara gaenimat samaga prantha rajaya saha federal manthrivaru kihipa denek mema kriyaava novaembar maasayedi pawathweemata niyamitha federal mathivaranaya ilakka karagath prodaawak bavata vivechanaya kalaha."" This clarifies that the Regional Governor and the state government jointly challenged the project, indicating opposition from the Regional Governor.

The text further states that John Howard, a former Prime Minister, allegedly used a $45 million action to get the project approved, implying that the Regional Governor's opposition was against this action.

Therefore, the Regional Governor is the one who initially opposed the ""pirisidu vayu panatha"" project.
"
balalunge muth‍ra wala sayanurik amlaya saha melamain sanyoga antharkriyaa karana wita aethi wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: wakugadu (catalyst)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vishvavidyaalaye paryeshakayan pawasuwe, ndeka ekineka prathikriyaa kara, vakugadu kriyaakarithvaya avahira karana sphatika saedhana bavay."" This translates to ""In the university, the researchers found that the two substances reacted, exhibiting catalytic activity to form a crystalline precipitate.""

Therefore, the substance that caused the reaction between cyanuric acid and melamine to form the crystalline precipitate is the **catalyst**.  The passage explicitly identifies this as the ""wakugadu"" (catalyst).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: surathal sathunge aahara (diet of the alcoholic beverage):**  The passage doesn't suggest the diet of the alcoholic beverage is responsible for the reaction.
* **C: sphatika (crystalline):**  ""Sphatika"" refers to the crystalline precipitate itself, not the cause of the reaction.
* **D: adhoraktha warnawaleekshanaya (infrared spectroscopy):** Infrared spectroscopy is a method used to analyze the composition of the precipitate, but it doesn't cause the reaction.



"
adhoraktha warnawaleekshanaya bhawitha karamin paryeshakayan nireekshanaya kale kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: surathal sathwa muth‍rawala sphatika sanyuthiya (crystal combination of animal urine)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the FTIR analysis revealed the crystal combination of the animal urine to be the same as the crystals found in the urine samples.  The question asks what the analysis *revealed* the researchers were looking for.
* The other options are related but not the direct answer:
    * **A: wakugadu kriyaakaarithwaya (catalytic activity)** - The catalytic activity is a *result* of the interaction, not what the analysis revealed.
    * **C: balapaemata lak wu surathal sathun (characteristic properties of animal urine)** - While the analysis identifies properties, the *specific* finding is the crystal combination.
    * **D: dooshanayata lak wu surathal sathwa aahara (characteristic properties of contaminated animal food)** -  The passage focuses on the urine itself, not contaminated food.



Therefore, the FTIR analysis revealed the **crystal combination of animal urine**.



"
"""luna """"ath‍yantha raejina"""" lesa handunwanu laebuwe kawuda?""","The correct answer is **A: Dustin ranals**.

The passage states: ""Tommy dremer pawasuwe, """"lunaa tamay athyantha raejina. mage palamu kalamanaakaariniya."""" and then Dustin """"goldast"""" runnels adahas daekvuye lunaa maa tharamatama atbhutay..."". This indicates that Dustin is the one who described the moon as ""athyantha raejina"" (extremely beautiful).
"
luna “athbhootha” lesa haendinwuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin ranals**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Dustin """"goldast"""" runnels adahas daekvuye lunaa maa tharamatama atbhutay... samaharavita itath vadaa... aeyata api aadareyi wagema aeyage aduva danevi... aeya honda thaenaka aethi.""  This translates to: ""Dustin 'goldast' saw the moon in such a wonderful way... so beautiful... we all admire its beauty... it's like good honey.""

* The word ""athbhootha"" means ""wonderful"" or ""amazing."" The sentence directly attributes this feeling of wonder and the description of the moon's beauty to Dustin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aeyage rasikayin** (its admirers): While the moon has admirers, the text explicitly focuses on *Dustin's* reaction.
* **C: rajaye wimarshakayan** (the judge/critic of the kingdom): This refers to a completely different character and isn't associated with the description of the moon.
* **D: tomi d‍reemar** (Tommy dreamer): Tommy is mentioned earlier in the text, but the description of the moon is associated with Dustin, not Tommy.



Therefore, Dustin ranals is the one who found the moon ""athbhootha"" (wonderful).



"
anathurata sambandha riyaduruta sidu nowuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: ohuge hisata thuvala sidu wiya (it happened on his way home)**.

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""Kese vethath, riyaduraage hisata barapathala thuwaala sidu viya.""  This translates to ""However, it happened on his way home.""
* **The question asks:** ""anathurata sambandha riyaduruta sidu nowuye kumakda? (Where did the accident happen?)
* **Option A directly answers the question** by referencing the information about the accident happening on the way home.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ohu niwasa thula siti kisiwekuta thuvala sidu kale naetha (he never happened on the way to his home)** - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **C: ohu kembrig hi rohalaka sita gret yaamawuthhi rohalakata maru karanu laebeeya (he could not change the route from Cambridge to the road)** - This is irrelevant to where the accident happened.
* **D: hadisi anathuru anshaya ohuwa vahanayen iwath kirimata udaw kaleya (the accident's portion helped him to drive the vehicle)** - This makes no sense in the context of the text.



"
ragbi shoorathawaliye dee dakunu ap‍rikaawe kreedawe kaepee penena kaaranaya wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: aarak‍shaka kusalatha (defensive skills)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ovunge shikshaakami aarakshaka vidhi, bola kalamanaakaranayehi nipunathaa saha athidaksha kandaayam ekaghathaawa hethuven ovunta raendi siteemata haeki woo athara tharaga kirimata vatinaa kandaayama meya bavata paehaedili vi ya.""

This translates to: ""Their excellent defensive methods, skill in ball handling and the skillful and adept teamwork led them to win the match.""

Therefore, defensive skills (aarakshaka kusalatha) are highlighted as a key reason for their victory. While other options might be relevant to rugby in general, the text specifically points to defensive skills as the driving force behind the South African team's win in this particular match.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dakunu ap‍rikaawe tharagaya vaedi diyunu vimata patan gaththe kawadadaa?","The correct answer is **B: aarakshaawa thara kirimen pasu** (After the reservation system).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ovunge shikshaakami aarakshaka vidhi... hethuven ovunta raendi siteemata haeki woo athara tharaga kirimata vatinaa kandaayama meya bavata paehaedili vi ya."" This translates to: ""Because of their reservation system... they were able to succeed in playing in two teams, and the team became very strong.""

This implies that the team's success (winning the match) came *after* implementing the reservation system. Options A, C, and D refer to events that happened *before* the team's success, according to the text.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, chinaye aarthikaya niwaerediwa pilibimbu nokaranne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: prathisanskarana sidu kirimen pasuwa chinaye aarthikaya sheegrayen wardhanaya vi thibe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Den shiyaopinge naayakathvaya yatathe palamu aarthika prathisanskarana sidu vi ya. Ethaen patan chinaye aarthikaya 90 gunayak vardhanaya wee atha."" (Then under Xiaoping's leadership, the economic reform was successfully implemented. Therefore, China's economy grew by 90 times.) This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eksath janapadayata wada wishala motar ratha apanayanaya welandapolak chinayata aetha:** While the passage mentions increased car ownership, it's not the primary reason for the economic boom. It's a *result* of the economic growth.
* **C: chinayata eksath janapadayata wada wishala dala desheeya nishpadithayak labaa gatha haekiya:**  The passage states China *increased* its domestic production significantly, it doesn't say they *gained* a large share of the domestic market.
* **D: chinaye vahana apanayanaya kisi witekath germaniya ikmava naetha:** This is irrelevant to the economic reasons behind China's growth.

Therefore, option A best summarizes the main reason for the economic growth presented in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, chinaye dala desheeya nishpadithaya eksath janapadaye dala desheeya nishpadithaya ikmava yaa haekke kawadada?","The correct answer is **B: dashaka dekak thula (two decades)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Patan chinaye aarthikaya 90 gunayak vardhanaya wee atha."" (China's economy increased 90 times.) This significant growth happened *during* the decade mentioned in the initial statement (""Avasan dashaka thuna thula"" - the last three decades).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thawath aarthika p‍rathisanskarana sidu kirimen pasuwa (after the economic reform was completed):** The passage doesn't specify *when* the 90-fold increase occurred relative to the completion of the reforms. While the reforms were the cause, the passage links the increase to the *decade* following the initial economic opening.
* **C: rata nawa nayakathwayak aethi wita (when a new leader came to power):** The passage mentions Mao's leadership and his role in the reforms, but it doesn't connect the economic growth directly to a change in leadership.
* **D: dashaka thunak thula (three decades):** The passage specifically mentions ""Avasan dashaka thuna thula"" (the last three decades) as the timeframe for the initial economic opening. However, the 90-fold increase happened *within* that period, making ""two decades"" a more precise timeframe for the significant growth.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the information provided is **B: dashaka dekak thula**.

sanwardhanaya wemin pawathina ratawalata hoo kirimata yojana karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: owunge sanwardhana adiyaren obbata yana wagakeem bhara gaeneema** (to implement their development plan by managing chemical loads).

Here's why:

The text states: """"ovun ese nokala yuthu vuvath, kese vethath, siya sanvardhana vedikaven, wagakeemen saha haekiyaaven ehaa yana baedhiyaawak gannaa lesa ovungen illaa sitiya yutuya"""" which translates to ""they will not do anything with unmanaged growth, without managing chemicals and resources."" This directly indicates that managing chemical loads is a key part of their development plan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aarthika nimaewuma kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima** (paying attention to economic issues): While economic issues might be a consideration, the text emphasizes chemical management.
* **C: owunge warthamana wagakeem walin obbata yaama** (focusing on their current chemical practices):  The text implies a broader plan than just focusing on existing practices.
* **D: dooshanaya pilibanda wu paerani mawatha maga haereema** (managing pollution related to their own activities):  Managing pollution is a consequence of managing chemicals, but option A encompasses the broader action of managing chemical loads for development.



"

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes the negative impacts of carbon dioxide emissions (pollution) and how they contribute to global warming. 
* The speaker's words focus on the need for countries to take action to mitigate these issues and promote sustainable development. 
* Options A, C, and D are too narrow. The text isn't just about reducing carbon emissions, it's about the broader consequences of pollution and the need for national strategies to address them.

Therefore, option B best captures the main point of the speaker's message.
"
pahatha sandahan karunu walin virman thathwaya yahapath nowana bawa paewasuwe kumak sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **A: medisin saens frontiyars**.

Here's why:

The question asks what ""virman thathwaya"" (Virman's principle) relates to. The provided text states: ""Medecines sans frontiere venuven kathaa kala richard virman paewasoowe..."" which translates to ""Richard Virman, who spoke about Medecines sans frontiere..."".  The text then quotes Virman. Therefore, his principle is connected to ""Medecines sans frontiere"" (Doctors Without Borders).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: aengolawa** (Angola) - While mentioned in the quote, it's a location, not the principle itself.
*   **C: mangolawa** (Mongolia) - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: loka sawukya sanwidhaanaya** (World Health Constitution) - Mentioned as a context for the situation, but not directly related to Virman's principle.



"
nadu wibhagaya hethuwen huhnege kaebinat thanathura bhara ganu aeththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: staamar**.

The question asks who will head the central department if Huhne is appointed to the cabinet. The text states: ""...parlimenthu manthri ed devi ohu venuvata cabinet mandalayata path karanu aetha. vedigen hisvana vyaapara amaathya thanatura parlimenthu manthri noman laemb visin labaa ganu aetaeyi apeksaa kere."" This translates to ""...parliamentary minister Ed Devi is expected to be appointed to the cabinet. The current Minister of Trade, Thanatura, is expected to receive the position of parliamentary secretary.""  Therefore, Staamar (Thanatura) is expected to take on the responsibilities of the central department.
"
nadu wibhagayen pasu wyaapara amath‍ya thanathura bharaganu aeththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: laemb**.

The text states: ""vedigen hisvana vyaapara amaathya thanatura parlimenthu manthri noman laemb visin labaa ganu aetaeyi apeksaa kere."" This translates to ""The parliamentary minister, the state minister for trade, is expected to receive a loan from Laemb."" Therefore, Laemb is the entity the state minister is expected to receive a loan from.
"
"kaemeele shantha-saenge opera p‍rasangaya atharathura, p‍rasangika idiripath karannan p‍rek‍shakayin dirimath karanne kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **D: owun aadaraya karana de anuwa owunge jiwitatha theeranaya kirimata ida deema**

Here's why:

* **The original text describes Kaemil's performance as deeply moving.**  The phrases ""mathdrawya saha japaanaya kerehi alayen jivath woo"" (which, although unclear in precise translation, conveys a sense of profound connection to life and perhaps spiritual elements) and ""preksakayan eyata sambandhaweema unandu karavayi"" (the audience felt connected to it) point to a performance that resonated with their emotions and values.
* **The question asks *how* this connection happened.** The text implies that Kaemil's act was not just about presenting something, but about sharing a part of himself and inspiring a positive transformation in the audience's life.
* **Option D, ""owun aadaraya karana de anuwa owunge jiwitatha theeranaya kirimata ida deema"" (offering to them the ability to live a meaningful life through respecting them), best captures this essence.** It suggests that Kaemil's performance was a way of showing respect for the audience and empowering them to find meaning and purpose in their own lives.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: gansa bhawithayata sahabhagee vima (sharing a sense of melancholy):** While there might be elements of sadness, the overall tone doesn't emphasize melancholy. The connection seems more positive and empowering.
* **B: japanayata sanchaaraya kirima (communicating with Japan):** The text doesn't mention Japan.
* **C: owun samaga wedikaawe raga daekvimata ek vima (sharing the beauty of the performance with them):**  Sharing beauty is part of a performance, but it doesn't explain *how* that beauty led to a profound connection and life-changing feeling.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate interpretation of the text's implications.



"
opera p‍rasangaya atharathura p‍radhaana washayen kansa dumvaeti panaya karanne kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: prasangika idiripath karannan (the relevant audience)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is the main theme of the opera *because* the relevant audience (prasangika idiripath karannan) is upset (kansa dumwaeti paanaya karana). The text states the opera's meaning is related to the audience's reaction.  The other options are not directly linked to *why* the audience's reaction is the central theme.  The opera isn't about the artist (kalakaruva), the audience's feelings in general (p‍ransha p‍rek‍shakayin), or Kaemil's thoughts (kaemeele shantha-saenge).  It's *because* the audience is reacting strongly that the meaning of the opera is revealed.
"
liyonow wisin sidu kala “abhyawakaashaye aewideema” sandaha wu thawath namak wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: aepalo-soyus meheyuma**.

The text states: ""Vasara dahayakata pasu, ohu abyavakaasa tharagaya avasan woo bavata sanketavat kala aepalo-soyus meheyumata soviyat paarshawayen naayakatvaya dunneya."" This translates to: ""After ten years, he signaled the end of the space age and the leadership of the Soviet space program to the Apple-Soyuz mission.""  Therefore, the ""abhyawakaashaye aewideema"" (approaching outer space) was associated with the Apollo-Soyuz mission.
"
liyonow sowiyat parshawaya wenuwen nayakathwaya dunne meheyume kumana kotasa sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **B: aepalo-soyus**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vasara dahayakata pasu, ohu abyavakaasa tharagaya avasan woo bavata sanketavat kala aepalo-soyus meheyumata soviyat paarshawayen naayakatvaya dunneya.""  This translates to: ""After ten years, he signaled the end of the space age with the Apollo-Soyuz mission, leading the Soviet parshawayen (cosmonauts) to international leadership.""

Therefore, the passage directly links the Apollo-Soyuz mission with the Soviet cosmonauts taking leadership in space.
"
anathuren thuvala laebuwe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **D: trak ratha riyadurek (truck driver)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Anatura sidu woo sthaanaya asala garaajayaka waeda karamin city pudhgalayeku mese pawasuweya: """"ethaena para paninna soodaanamin city lamayin city athara ovun siyalu denaama kae gasannata saha andannata patan gathaa."""" Ovuhu siyalu denaa anatura siduwee thibu sthaanayen aapasu diva giyaha.""

This translates to: ""The nature of the sidu from the original garage, a small city resident, said: """"All the people who are coming and going from the city beyond this small city, they are all going to the place where the nature of the sidu exists.""""  Those who are coming and going from the nature of the sidu will go to the original place.""

The passage describes someone involved with the ""anatura sidu"" (the nature of sidu - likely a type of transport or vehicle). The phrase ""trak ratha riyadurek"" (truck driver) fits the context of someone traveling and transporting things.  The other options don't align with the description. ""Gibsanva rohalakata genagiyamut in mohotakata pasu ohu miya giyeya"" refers to the direction of the journey but doesn't identify the person.
"
anathurata sambandha pudgalayinta sidu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: owun dedenama miya giyaha** (people who went there).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anatura sidu woo sthaanaya asala garaajayaka waeda karamin city pudhgalayeku mese pawasuweya: """"ethaena para paninna soodaanamin city lamayin city athara ovun siyalu denaama kae gasannata saha andannata patan gathaa."""" Ovuhu siyalu denaa anatura siduwee thibu sthaanayen aapasu diva giyaha.""

This translates to: ""The original place of the Anatura Sidu's garage was in a small city, and people went there to buy and sell all kinds of goods. Those who went there, all of them, went to the place where the Anatura Sidu was located.""

Therefore, the people who went to the place where the Anatura Sidu was located are the ones being referred to as ""owun dedenama miya giyaha"" - people who went there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ek pudgalayekuta thuvala sidu nowu athara ek ayeku miya giyeya** (some people who were affected by the situation went there) - While some might have been affected, the passage doesn't explicitly state this. The focus is on people *going* to the location.
* **C: owun kaegasamin adamin sitiyaha** (people from the gasamin city) - The passage mentions a ""small city"" where the garage was originally, not specifically a ""gasamin city.""
* **D: dedenatama thuvala wiya** (being affected) - Similar to B, the passage doesn't explicitly mention being affected as the reason for going.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate representation of the information in the passage.
"

The text states: ""Mandaakiniyak vataa pihitana anduru drawya bohomayak, e vataa pihitanne prabhaa mandalayak lesin bawath eya kudaa anshu gananaavakin saekasee aethi bawath mema nyaayen kiyave.""

Translation: ""A large amount of hidden essence is hidden by the wind, and even the slightest part of this hidden essence is calculated as a percentage of the radiance mandala.""

This clearly indicates that even a small part (""kudaa anshu"") of the hidden essence is significant and measurable. The passage emphasizes the importance of the small portion in relation to the larger whole.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: saaman‍ya padartha (ordinary matter)**: While ordinary matter might be present, the focus isn't on it as the key result.
*   **B: udam balaya (water power)**: Water power is mentioned as a source of energy, but the question asks about the *result* of observation.
*   **D: anduru padartha (inner matter)**: Inner matter is the substance being observed, but the text emphasizes the *small part* of that substance that is significant.



"
widyaangayan nireekshanaya karamin sitiye pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: dhanu mandakiniya saha k‍sheera pathaya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""kandaayama apekshaa karana deya viya haekke mandaakiniye anduru drawya saha kshira pathaye anduru drawya athara wana udam balaya magin aetivana pratiphalayay.""  This translates to ""The expected result is that the inner substance of the Mandakini (identified with Sagittarius) and the inner substance of the Milky Way will flow in a powerful stream."" 

Therefore, the observation involves both the Sagittarius constellation (Mandakini) and the Milky Way (Ksheera Pathaya).
"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, konsarwetiwwarun wisin wiwechanaya nokaranne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: naewatha goda naenvima sandaha wu wiyadam** (research was done on the topic of damage caused by hurricanes).

Here's why:

* The question asks what research wasn't done.
* The passage states: ""katrinaa suli kunaatuven nagitimehi mudava gaeneema saha nawatha gora nanvima sandahaa pamana ikmava viyadam kireema pilibanda mathabhedaya magin vivaadaya aevili giye ya.""  This translates to: ""There was disagreement and argument regarding conducting a size-based assessment of damage caused by Hurricane Katrina and subsequent recovery.""
* Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions research (or lack thereof, due to disagreement) *about the damage caused by hurricanes*.
* Options A, B, and C all describe aspects of the research or disagreements *around* the hurricane damage assessment. Option D directly addresses the research done *on the topic of damage*.



"

Here's why:

The question asks who is associated with the analysis of Katrina's damage and related issues regarding the ""yali idikireeme konthraaththuwa"" (likely referring to disaster relief contracts). The text states: ""Yali idikireeme vyayama pilibanda libaralvaadi vivecanaya kendhragatha vuye..."" which translates to ""The liberal viewpoint is centered around the analysis of the yali idikireeme exercise..."".

Therefore, liberals are the ones analyzing the disaster relief contracts related to Katrina.

"mema chedayata anuwa, abhyawakaasha yaanaya pahatha sandahan kumana karuna sambandhawa vaarthawak thabanu aethi da?","The correct answer is **A: ahase wada pululma parasaya aalokamath kirima (emitting light in the darkness)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the Apollo capsule emitting a bright light that was visible from a great distance – California, Oregon, Nevada, and Idaho. It also mentions the capsule's rapid journey and the light it emitted during that time. Option A directly reflects this key characteristic of the Apollo capsule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: boho nagarawala daekiya haeki vima (seeing many cities)** While the capsule *could* see cities, the primary description focuses on the light it emitted.
* **C: wegawathma pruthiwiyata aapasu yaame gamana (traveling to the moon)** The passage describes a journey *to* the moon, but the core focus is on the light emitted *during* the journey to Earth.
* **D: saen fraensiskoo sita los aenjalees dakva wegawathma gaman kirima (traveling from San Francisco to Los Angeles)** This describes a portion of the journey, but doesn't capture the essential aspect of the light emission that was visible from far away.

aachaarya malar balasub‍ramaniyan ge saroja balasub‍ramaniyan hata wu ngaathi sambandhaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: sahodriya (sister)**.

The text states that Dr. Malar Subramaaniyam's wife is Saroja Balasubramaniyam. Therefore, they are husband and wife, and Saroja Balasubramaniyam is Dr. Malar Subramaaniyam's wife, making her his wife. The question asks about their relationship. Since the text identifies her as his wife, and the options relate to familial relationships, ""sahodriya"" (sister) is incorrect.

Looking closely at the wording ""53 haeviridi sarojaa baalasubramaniyamge dehaya soyagatha"", which means ""the body of 53-year-old Saroja Balasubramaniyam was found,""  it's clear she is the deceased. The question asks about her relationship to Dr. Malar Subramaaniyam. Since they were married, she was his wife. But the options don't include ""wife"". We need to re-examine the question and the information given. There is no mention of Saroja being a sister of Malar. 

However, the question is asking about the relationship between ""aachaarya malar balasub‍ramaniyan ge saroja balasub‍ramaniyan"". The text explicitly states ""sarojaa baalasubramaniyamge dehaya soyagatha"", meaning the body of Saroja Balasubramaniyam was found. She is the wife of Dr. Malar Subramaaniyam. Therefore, the relationship between them is husband and wife.  

Since husband/wife is not offered as an answer, and there seems to be a misunderstanding in the options provided, I will re-evaluate.  Given the options, there's no perfect fit. However, if we assume there's a typo and option A was intended to say ""sahodriya"" (sister), and the question is mistakenly asking about a familial relationship when it's about marriage, then A would be the closest.



However, since the options are presented and there is no reasonable correction, it may indicate a flaw in the question or answer choices. But if we *have* to choose, given the context, the most plausible answer, despite the ambiguity, is **A: sahodriya (sister)**. This is based on the assumption there is a typo in the answer choices and the question unintentionally asks about a familial relationship.



**Therefore, based on the available choices, I choose A. However, it's important to note this selection is based on an assumption about a possible typo in the answer choices, given the provided text.**"
sara balasub‍ramaniyange mala sirura soyaagaththe kohenda?,"The correct answer is **A: sinsinati hi**.

This translates to ""29-year-old doctor Malar Subramaniam, **in Cincinnati**, had a car accident...""  The passage directly mentions Cincinnati as the city where the accident happened.



"
eebe wisin athpathkara gaththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: skayip (Skype)**.

The question asks which company was involved in the power struggle to increase popularity in India, Europe, and Brazil, alongside the development of communication and cultural diversification. The text explicitly mentions ""Skype"" as a key player in this competition.
"
ebandu de athpathkara gaeneema haraha eebe balaporoththu wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: nawa p‍radesha walata pulul kirima** (Expanding to new territories).

Here's why:

* **P (Question)** describes a process of expansion and power struggles. It mentions influencing India, Europe, and Brazil, and gaining popularity in various regions.
* **Q (Question)** asks *what* the power struggles were *for*.
* **A (Option A - Strengthening power)** is a *result* of the power struggles, not the reason for them.
* **B (Option B - Expanding to new territories)** directly aligns with the expansionist actions mentioned in P (influencing different regions). Power struggles often arise from the desire to control more land and resources.
* **C (Option C - Eliminating internal enemies)** while potentially part of a larger strategy, isn't the primary driver implied by the text.
* **D (Option D - Satisfying the desires of the population)** is also not the main focus. Power struggles are often about asserting dominance and gaining control, not necessarily fulfilling popular demands.

Therefore, the most accurate answer to ""What were the power struggles for?"" is to **expand to new territories**.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, satanin pasu midule raendee siti raendawiyan samaga an‍yon‍ya lesa katayuthu nokale kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: maedihathkaruwan**.

Here's why:

The text describes Satan and his forces engaging in a battle against the ""sirakaruvange illima"" (the demons' foolishness/wickedness). The passage states the ""maedihathkaruvan thathwaya samathayakata path kirimata uthsaaha karana lada namudu"" which translates to ""the righteous fought to encourage the way of righteousness."" This clearly identifies the ""maedihathkaruvan"" (righteous ones/the righteous people) as the ones battling against Satan and his forces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: gini nivime kandayama (fire sacrifice/fire ceremony):** This is a part of Satan's actions, not the fighters.
* **C: niladhaareen (those standing guard/the guards):** The guards are described as being in a state of alert, but they are not the ones fighting. They are part of the overall battle scene.
* **D: rohal kaarya mandalaya (spiritual duty office/spiritual work department):** This is not mentioned in the text.



Therefore, the righteous individuals, the **maedihathkaruvan**, are the ones engaged in the battle with Satan and his forces.



"
sirakaruwan koolahalawalin pasubaeseemata hethu wuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: ginnak (fire)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ikmaninma, kolaahala avasthaavalata sarilana lesa sannaddhawa paemini niladhaarin midulata aetulu wee kandulu vaayuva muktha karamin raendaviyan konakata gonu kalo ya. **Gini nivana bhatayan avasaanaye di pa.wa. 11:35 pamana wana vita ginna nivaa daemee ya.**""

This translates to: ""Without fear, the soldiers, armed with a slight readiness, released a cloud of smoke from the windows, and the fire, at approximately 11:35 am, spread rapidly.""

The text explicitly links the fire (""ginna"") to the cause of the chaos and the smoke released by the soldiers. Therefore, fire is the most logical answer.



"
"aayathulla ali kamenige mathaya anuwa, iranaya ratak lesa nidhas wiya yuththe kumak wethin da?","The correct answer is **B: islameeya wiplawaya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rate uththarithara naayaka ayatulla ali kameni 1979 dee iraanaye **islaameeya viplavayata pere sitama tell matha yaepima """"ugulak"""" lesath, ein rata nidahas viya yuthu bawath visthara karana ladhi.""** This translates to: ""Rate uththarithara leader ayatulla Ali Khamenei, in 1979, after the **Islamic Revolution** in Iran, declared that oil is a ""treasure"" and the country would be mobilized to wage war.""

Therefore, the Islamic Revolution is directly linked to the description of Iran mobilizing to wage war.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, irana aarthikayata sambadhaka magin aethikarana balapaem piligaththe kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: jyeshta mulasra**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...rupavahini sajiva vikaashayak thulin, idiripath kala adahas tulini. Evaata mullya sambaadhaka menma iraana arthikayata 80%ka daayakatvayak sapayana videsha aadayama wana bora thell apanayanaya wana bora thell apanayanaya kirimata gaena yuropaa sangamaya kala thahanamak da aethulat we.

This shows that ""jyeshta mulasra"" (senior leader/chief) is the one who initiated the oil production and significantly impacted Iran's economy by nationalizing the oil industry in 1979. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was the leader at the time of the Islamic Revolution and played a crucial role in nationalizing the oil industry. The passage links the revolution and Khamenei to the oil industry's development.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Opek:** OPEC is mentioned as a group that set production quotas, but it's not the primary driver of Iran's economic changes.
*   **C: Aayathulla ali kameni:** While Ayatollah Ali Khamenei was the leader during the revolution, the question asks about the *chief* responsible for the economic impact. The passage indicates the chief responsible for the economic impact was the senior leader, which in this context is Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.
*   **D: Yuropa sangamaya:** European countries were the main importers of Iranian oil, but they didn't cause the economic changes."
p‍ransha chandaya p‍rakaasha kirime kriyaawaliye kotasak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: chanda p‍rakaasha kirime rola hi athsan thaebeema (The role of making lunar light is being implemented)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""chandadaayakayaa lipi kavaraya chanda pettiyata damaa chanda prakaasha kireeme rola athsan karayi.""  This translates to: ""The lunar light making role of the lunar light cover is being implemented on the lunar box.""

Option C directly reflects this statement. The other options are not supported by the passage:

* **A: winiwida penena chanda petti (Lunar box with a lunar cover):** While mentioned, it's not the primary focus of the question.
* **B: apek‍shakayin wisin ewana lada niyojithayin (being implemented based on the expectations):** The passage discusses implementing the lunar light *role*, not implementing actions based on expectations.
* **D: apek‍shakayaage niyojithayin wisin ganankarana lada chanda (the moon being calculated based on the expectations of the expectation):** This is a nonsensical interpretation of the passage.



"
chanddayakayin thaman thoragath apek‍shakayaa sandahan karanne kothaenada?,"The correct answer is **C: lipi kawarayak matha** (On the script cover).

Here's why:

The text states: ""chandadaayakayaa lipi kavaraya chanda pettiyata damaa chanda prakaasha kireeme rola athsan karayi."" This translates to: ""The script cover of the moon observer was attached to the moon box and played a role in the moon light observation.""

Therefore, the script cover is what the moon observer's expectation is related to.
"
aelanta musashi sandaha wasara ataka sevimak aarambha kirimata hethu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: samudra gaweshanaya sandaha ohuge aayojanaya (his plan for ocean exploration)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lokaye dhanavatma pudgalayaku wana eelan, siya dhanayen waedi pramaanayak samudra gavesanaya sandaha aayojanaya kara aetaeyi kiya visvaasa karana athara, yuddhaya pilibanda diwi aethi turaa wana unanduvakin musaashi soya gaeneeme siya gavesanaya aarambha kala bhava vaarthaa we.""

This translates to: ""Believing that the powerful people of the world were planning to organize ocean exploration regarding the search for wealth, Musashi Soyaganeema started the search for wealth, and related news about the war also spread.""

Therefore, Musashi Soyaganeema started the search (and the related news) *because* of the planned ocean exploration for wealth.  Option C directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuge dhanaya (his wealth)** - While wealth is mentioned, it's the *potential* for wealth through exploration that drives the action, not his existing wealth.
* **B: muhudu pathula sithiyam gatha kirima kerehi ohuge unanduwa (his brother's actions)** - The passage mentions his brother indirectly through the news of the war, but it's not the *reason* he started the search.
* **D: ohuge yuddhaya kerehi unanduwa (his war actions)** - The war news is mentioned as spreading *along with* the wealth search news, but it's not the initiating cause. The ocean exploration plan is the primary driver.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, aelan thama mudalin saelakiya yuthu p‍ramanayak wiyadam kale kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **B: samudra gaweshanaya (ocean research)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...lokaye dhanavatma pudgalayaku wana eelan, siya dhanayen waedi pramaanayak samudra gavesanaya sandaha aayojanaya kara aetaeyi kiya visvaasa karana athara..."".  This translates to ""...based on the belief that powerful individuals were planning to organize ocean research in search of wealth..."".

The question asks what the war was primarily about. The passage explicitly links the war's initiation to the belief that ocean research was being planned for wealth. Therefore, ocean research is the core issue being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: musashi naewatha pihituvima (Musashi's evasion):** This is irrelevant to the main point of the passage.
* **C: diya yata durastha palana yaath‍rawak godanaegeema (granting land travel to those near water):**  This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: muhudu pathula sithiyamkaranaya gaena igena gaeneema (going and returning by night):** This is also not mentioned in the passage and doesn't relate to the core conflict.

"mema chedayata anuwa, balagaraya thula ha awata anathurudaayaka thathwayanta hethu wiya haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: yureniyam indhana (Uranium fuel)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baladharin anumaana karanne mema sthaanaye yureniyam indhana radhawana bahaalum paeli yannata aethi bawath, ein kaanduva siduvana bawath ya."" This translates to: ""Balagaraya suspects that uranium fuel has been used here, leading to both a nuclear explosion and a meltdown.""

Therefore, the passage directly links uranium fuel to the cause of the situation.  The other options are mentioned as components of the radioactive contamination, but uranium fuel is presented as the primary suspected cause.
"
balagara anathurakin pasu p‍radeshavaseenta nirdesha karanu labana aarak‍shaka upades walin ekak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: sudu dumaraya aashvasa kirimen vaelakee siteema**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What protective advice should be followed if a ""balaagarayen sudu dumaarayak"" (a nuclear explosion) occurs?
* **The text states:** ""vaayu samikarana akriya kirimatat nala jalaya nobiimatat pradeshaye adhikaarihu avavaada karati.""  This translates to: ""the authority of the province will issue an alert to not drink contaminated water due to the atmospheric reaction.""
* **The text also mentions:** ""Japanaye nyashtika niyojitaayatanaya kiyana paridi ema anganayen vikiranasili seesiyam saha ayadin soya gene aetha.""  This translates to: ""The fallout from the Japanese nuclear plant has radioactive cesium and iodine.""
* **The nuclear explosion (sudu dumaraya) is the key event.**  The most immediate and crucial protective measure after a nuclear explosion, especially considering the radioactive fallout, is to **seek shelter and reassure people.** The text implies this by mentioning the province's authority issuing alerts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: vayu sameekarana ekaka bhawithayen vaelakee siteema (Seek shelter using an atmospheric reaction)** - This is incorrect. The atmospheric reaction is what *caused* the problem (radioactive fallout), not a method for seeking shelter.
* **B: aethulatha raendee siteema (Seek shelter using a protective barrier)** - While a protective barrier *can* help, it's not the primary advice. Reassurance and seeking the nearest shelter are more immediate concerns.
* **D: nala jalaya panaya kirimen vaelakee siteema (Seek shelter by purifying drinking water)** -  The text explicitly states *not* to drink contaminated water. Purification is a secondary measure, not the primary protective advice.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical and accurate answer based on the information provided in the text.

"waidya molta anuwa, XDR-TB hi aethi wadathma kanassallata thudu dena karuna kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: ehi ihala marana anupathaya (Its high mortality rate)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...mema nava prabhedaya """"ithaa ihala marana anupaathayak penwana baevin eya ithama bhayankaara"""" wana bhava ohu sammukha saakachchavaka dee paewaseeya."" This translates to ""...this new type is 'extremely dangerous' because it has a very high mortality rate.""

The question asks what makes XDR-TB so dangerous according to Dr. Mol. The passage clearly identifies the high mortality rate as the key factor.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mema p‍rabhedya rohalen paethireema (Its difficulty to treat):** While XDR-TB *is* difficult to treat (due to drug resistance), the passage highlights the high mortality rate *first* as the primary concern.
* **B: awshadhawalata p‍rabhedaye p‍rathirodhaya daekvima (Its resistance to many drugs):** This is a *reason* for the difficulty in treating XDR-TB, but not the primary danger point emphasized by Dr. Mol.
* **C: aasaditha pudgalayeku wisin aasadnaya kala haeki pudgalayinge p‍ramanaya (The proportion of people who have been exposed to infected individuals):**  The passage mentions exposure and the spread of the disease, but doesn't frame it as the *danger* caused by XDR-TB.



"

The text states: ""Vasaraka kaalayak thula, aasadanaya woo pudgalayeku, sameepa sambandhatha pawathwana aya 10 sita 15 dakva pramanayakata meya bo kirimata ida aetha.""  This translates to: ""Within a year, those who consume the medicine, as well as their close relatives up to 10 to 15 degrees of kinship, should be tested.""

Therefore, the answer is 15.
"
NextGen paddhathiya bhawitha karanne kumana aakaaraye thaakshanayak da?,"The correct answer is **A: chandrikaa matha padanam wu thaakshanaya** (Lunar-based positioning system).

Here's why:

The passage states ""...bhoomigatha redaar padanam thaaksanaya venuvata chandrikaa padanam thaaksanayak bhavitha karayi."" This translates to ""...the terrestrial radar positioning system, along with the lunar positioning system, will be developed.""

Therefore, the next-generation positioning system being developed is a lunar-based positioning system.
"
NextGen guwan gaman palakawarunta rijuwama p‍rathilabha labaa denne keseda?,"The correct answer is **C: adu kaaban wimochanaya (reduced carbon emissions)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how NextGen urban mobility aims to reduce carbon emissions through various methods like electric vehicles, optimized routes, and promoting walking/cycling.  The question asks what benefit NextGen urban mobility brings.  Reducing carbon emissions is a primary and key benefit mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: keti guwan gaman marga (optimized urban travel routes):** While optimized routes are part of the plan, the passage focuses on the overall *benefit* of the entire system, not just the routes themselves.
*   **B: wadath niwaeredi guwan yaana pihiteema (a better and more convenient urban transportation system):** This is a general benefit, but reduced carbon emissions are a specific and crucial outcome.
*   **D: adu indhana (reduced fuel consumption):** Reduced fuel consumption is a *result* of reduced carbon emissions. The focus of the question is on the overall advantage gained.

"mema chedayata anuwa, ithihasangayin ef. bee. ayi hi awadhaanaya yomu kirima pilibandawa wiwechanaya nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: owunge saarthakathwa anupathaya ihala naenvima (Ignoring the proportionality of their usefulness)**.

Here's why:

The question highlights a discrepancy:  While the past research focused on the proportionality of AI's usefulness to motor vehicle accidents and the ethical implications of AI, there's a contradiction. The statement mentions that in 2005, the focus shifted to the ""sexual orientation"" of AI research *before* establishing a basic foundation. This suggests a misprioritization of research goals.

Option A directly addresses this misprioritization.  The original research likely focused on practical and safety-related aspects of AI.  Shifting focus to something like ""sexual orientation"" (which is a highly controversial and irrelevant area for the early development of AI) *before* building a solid foundation is a violation of proportionality.  It's like building a house without a strong foundation and then immediately trying to decorate it with frivolous details.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pahasuwen wisandiya haeki aparadha sandaha sampath wen kirima (Focusing on compensating for past mistakes regarding criminal matters):** While addressing criminal matters is important, it doesn't explain the core issue of misprioritizing fundamental research.
* **C: kaamuka darshana siddheen kerehi daedi awadhaanayak yomu kirima (Paying undue attention to achieving sexual orientation-related goals):** This is too narrow.  It only focuses on *one* specific and irrelevant goal, not the broader issue of research proportionality.
* **D: motar ratha sorakam siddheen (Achieving success in motor vehicle accidents):** This describes a desired outcome but not the reason for the research's initial misdirection.  The problem is *how* the research was conducted and what priorities were set.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because it directly addresses the fundamental flaw in prioritizing an irrelevant research direction over building a solid foundation.

mema asabhyatha vaedasatahana FBI hata kirimata bala karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: niyojithayathanaye saarthakathwa anupathaya ihala naenvima (Dismissing the relevance of the institution's effectiveness)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt argues that the FBI's initial focus on sex crimes in 2005 was a misguided priority.** It suggests that this initial focus, and the subsequent dedication of resources to it, was not a worthwhile use of the FBI's time and money.
* **The question asks how to stop the FBI from focusing on sex crimes.**  The most direct way to do so, according to the prompt's underlying argument, is to question the institution's *effectiveness* in that area and, therefore, its *relevance*. If the institution's priorities are deemed irrelevant or ineffective, it's less likely to continue dedicating significant resources to them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: motar ratha sorakam siddheen sandaha vaedi sampath p‍ramanayak wen kirima (Verifying the success of motor vehicle accidents):**  This is completely unrelated to the issue of the FBI's focus on sex crimes.
* **C: wisandeemata pahasu aparadha kerehi awadhaanaya yomu kirima (Paying attention to those who criticize the institution):**  While important to be aware of criticism, simply paying attention to critics doesn't stop the FBI from focusing on a particular area.
* **D: kaamuka darshana siddheen sandaha niyojithayan wen kirima (Continuing to organize events related to sexual orientation):** This is the *opposite* of what the prompt suggests. The prompt argues *against* continuing this type of organization.



Therefore, option B best reflects the prompt's underlying argument about the FBI's misplaced priorities and the need to question the relevance of its focus."

Translation: ""The Jas 39c Gripen aircraft crashed near the airport at 9:30 (0230 UTC) while on its way to the runway, emitting smoke and flames. The pilot ejected safely. Local media reported that the aircraft crashed.""

Therefore, the aircraft crashed (perali giyeya).

This translates to: ""The Jas 39c Gripen aircraft, after taking off from the domestic airport around 9:30 (0230 UTC), was caught in a conflict while descending towards the commercial flight path.""

Therefore, the aircraft was heading towards a **commercial flight**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about his sporting worth related to Partizan Belgrade.** The text explicitly states, ""1995 dee ohu paatisanhi ithihasaye hondama kridakayaa lesa theripath viya"" which translates to ""In 1995, he became one of the best players in Partizan's history."" This directly addresses the question.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ohu kandayama wenuwen kreeda karamin gola 468 kata vaedi p‍ramanayak vaartha kaleya:** While this mentions his stats, it doesn't directly relate to his overall sporting worth *to Partizan Belgrade*.
* **B: ohu wenath kreedakayanta wada vaedi gola p‍ramanayak labaa gena aetha:** The text doesn't mention him receiving any awards or specific stats to indicate worth.
* **D: ohu wenath onaema kreedakayekuta wada vaedi tharaga wala penee sitiyeya:** This refers to his participation in the stadium but not his performance or impact on the team's history.



Therefore, option C is the only one that directly and accurately answers the question about his sporting worth to Partizan Belgrade."

Option A directly reflects this information. The other options are partially correct but not the most accurate or complete answer based on the text.

* The passage explicitly states: ""mema sampurnayen pihaatuvalin vaesunu"" which translates to ""it was completely equipped with sharp claws."" This directly answers the question about a distinguishing characteristic.
* Other options are either incorrect or not directly supported:
    * **A: eyata kakul dekak thibe** (it had two legs): The passage doesn't mention the number of legs.
    * **B: eyata wishala dewani niyapothu aetha** (it had a large wingspan): While the passage mentions a large wingspan (""vishaala woo baevin""), it's not presented as a *distinguishing* characteristic.
    * **D: eyata unusum rudhirayak aetha** (it had slimy blood): The passage states it was a blood-eating bird (""rudhira maansa bhaksaka paksiyaa""), but the word ""unusum"" (slimy) isn't used.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is C.
"
“hesperonichas” yannehi arthaya labaa gena aeththe kumana jivi wisheshaye bhawthika lakshanayen da?,"The correct answer is **B: pihatu sahitha shareeraya (body with feathers)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Hesdparonishas... velosiraeptar ha gnathi sambandhatavak aetha... unusum rudhira maansa bhaksaka paksiyaa velosiraeptarhi niya sahitha paada deken rujuva aevidinnata aetaeyi visvaasa kerina."" This translates to something like: ""Hesdparonishas... had a jaw connection with a velociraptor...  it was a large, carnivorous bird-like velociraptor with feet.""
* The key phrase is ""...paksiyaa velosiraeptarhi niya sahitha paada..."" which means ""...a bird-like velociraptor with feet.""  This directly implies that Hesdparonishas had feathers and a body structure resembling a bird.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: niyapoththa(thu) (possibly related to a body covering):** While feathers are a type of body covering, ""pihatu sahitha shareeraya"" is a more comprehensive description.
* **C: paada (feet):** The passage mentions the feet, but that's not the defining characteristic.
* **D: hota (head):**  The passage doesn't focus on the head.

Therefore, **B (pihatu sahitha shareeraya - body with feathers)** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided.
"
wedi thaebeeme siddhiya pilibanda pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin niwaeredi wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: saemiyaa saha birinda dedenama teksas walin wethi**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the couple got married in Texas and the wedding was held in Buffalo.  It then mentions that the buffalo was 30 miles from the lake and that it had a bad reputation.
* Question Q asks about the reason for the buffalo's bad reputation.
* Option A directly states that the buffalo lived with the people who were in Texas and had been with them for a long time. This implies a history and context that could contribute to a bad reputation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: windithayin ganana pas deneku we:** This translates to ""They gave a warning based on the wind."" This is irrelevant to the buffalo's reputation.
* **C: mema yuwala meeta wasarakata pera baflao hi wivaha wuha:** This translates to ""Our couple's marriage was with a buffalo."" This is factually incorrect; they married a human.
* **D: wedi thaebeeme siddhiya bafalo hi siduwiya:** This translates to ""The buffalo achieved a victory in the heat."" This doesn't explain why the buffalo had a bad reputation.



"
wedi thaebeema sidu wu sthaanaya sambandhayen kumana p‍rakaashaya niwaeredi da?,"The correct answer is **B: eya sidu wuye nila sanvathsara uthsawayakadee ya** (It is the anniversary of the wedding).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""mema yuvala meeta vasarakata pere teksas hi vivaaha wee, mituran ha naedaeyan samaga saemarima sandaha baffalo wetha paeminiyaha."" (This couple got married in Texas, and they are celebrating their wedding anniversary in Buffalo).
* The question asks what the ""sidu"" (anniversary) is related to. 
* The passage connects the ""sidu"" to the ""nila sanvatsara"" (wedding anniversary).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya bafalo hi wivaha sanwathsara saadayaka dee siduwiya** (It is the wedding anniversary of Buffalo). This is incorrect because the passage says the couple got married in Texas, not Buffalo.
* **C: meya sidu wuye teksas hi paewathi sadayakadee ya** (It is the anniversary of Texas). This is incorrect because the passage focuses on the couple's anniversary, not Texas.
* **D: meya sidu wuye yawalage wivaha mangal‍yayedee ya** (It is the wedding ceremony of the couple). This is incorrect because the passage states they are *celebrating* their anniversary, not having the ceremony again.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, luno sambandhayen niladhaareenge mulika awadhaanaya yomu wuye kumak wethada?","The correct answer is **C: indhana kaandu vima (fuel consumption)**.

Here's why:

The question asks how the fuel consumption (indhana kaandu) is affected by the situation described in the prompt. The prompt details a scenario where a helicopter is needed to rescue people affected by a flood and a boat carrying supplies is encountering difficulties due to strong winds. 

Therefore, the most direct impact of these events on fuel consumption would be the increased use of the helicopter. The helicopter needs to fly to the affected areas, potentially navigate difficult weather conditions, and engage in rescue operations, all of which require significant fuel.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: pohora thogaye aduwak (wind force):** While wind affects the boat's journey, it doesn't directly explain how the fuel consumption of the helicopter is affected. 
*   **B: rala saha adhika sulan (heavy rain and strong winds):** Similar to wind force, heavy rain and strong winds affect the boat, but not the helicopter's fuel consumption. The helicopter could potentially fly *through* heavy rain and winds (within safe limits).
*   **D: kaarya mandala samajikayanta siduwiya haeki thuvala (lack of operational social awareness/support):** This option is completely irrelevant to the prompt and doesn't relate to fuel consumption.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, luno aapadawata lakvima pilibanda pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashayangen sath‍ya p‍rakaashaya wanne kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: bhaanda thogaya patava gaeneemata pera aapadawata lak wiya**

Here's why:

The question asks what the priority is for dealing with a disaster. The passage states that a helicopter is needed to rescue people trapped in a boat that sank near a reef.  It also mentions the boat was carrying passengers and fuel. Therefore, the priority should be to rescue the people from the sinking boat.  The fuel is secondary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: naewa aapadawata lakwana awasthaawe indhana meetar 100k naewehi thibee aetha:** While the fuel level is mentioned, it's not the priority in the immediate rescue situation.
* **C: kaarya mandalaye samajikayan dolos denagen ek ayek thuvala laebeeya:** This is irrelevant to the disaster scenario.
* **D: naewa diyakadanayata thallu wiya:** This is also irrelevant to the primary concern of rescuing people.

Therefore, option A, focusing on rescuing the people from the sinking boat (even with fuel present), is the most logical and correct answer.



"
aeljiriyaawa nidhasa laebuwe kumana dashakaya thulada?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 dashakaye** (1960s).

The text states: ""1960 dee ohu chitrapata adyakshanaya igaenvimata aluthin nidahasa labaa gath aelgeriyava wetha naewatha giyeya."" This translates to ""In 1960, he obtained a new film director's license and started filmmaking."" Therefore, he obtained his film director's license in the 1960s.
"
awamangal‍ya uthsawaya sandaha rupavahinee thira pihituva nothibune koheda?,"The correct answer is **B: ithaliye wiwidha nagarawala**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Janataavata uthsavaya naerabimata ida deemata romaye vividha sthaanavala vishaala rupavaahini thira raesak sthaapanaya karana ladi. **Italiye saha lokaye anekuth pradeshawala, visesayenma polantaye boho nagaravala samaana saekaseem aethi karanu labu athara**..."".

This translates to: ""To make the festival accessible to the public, they fought to establish large video screens in various places in Rome. **In Italy and other countries, especially in many cities in Poland, a similar number of people were able to watch**..."".

While the festival did take place in Rome, the text specifically highlights the use of large video screens in *various places in Rome* and then goes on to mention that it was also popular in many cities in Poland and other parts of Italy. Therefore, option B is the most accurate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: romaya purawatama (ancient Rome):** The text refers to *modern* Rome.
* **C: polanthaye samahara sthaanawala (major locations in Poland):** While Poland is mentioned, the text doesn't specifically say screens were set up in *major locations* only. It says many cities.
* **D: shantha peethara chathurashraye (Shantha Peethara Monastery):** This location is mentioned only as the place where the initial preparations were made, not where the screens were set up for public viewing.
"
awamangal‍ya uthsawaya pawathwanu laebuwe koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: romaya pura wiwidha sthaanawala** (Rome pura vividha sthaanawala).

The text states: ""Janataavata uthsavaya naerabimata ida deemata romaye vividha sthaanavala vishaala rupavaahini thira raesak sthaapanaya karana ladi."" which translates to ""To make the festival accessible to the public, they fought to establish large video screens in various places in Rome.""

While Poland is mentioned as a place where the festival was widely viewed, the text explicitly mentions Rome as the location where the video screens were installed. Options C and D are incorrect as they don't accurately reflect the information provided in the text.
"
pipireemen pasuwa barapathala thuvala sandaha p‍rathikaara laebuwe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: awama washayen pas deneku** (with a warm wash).

Here's why:

The text states that to prevent the spread of the disease (likely a contagious one causing tremors and symptoms), the confined resident (baddha nivaasayak) was moved to a location with a gas connection (gaes samaagame niladhaariyeku).  The text also says that a warm wash was needed to ward off the disease (pipirima avasthave adaala sthaanaye sity pudgalayan pas denekutavat pratikaara karana ladi). 

Therefore, a warm wash is the preventative measure mentioned in the text.
"
gaes kaanduwak gaena vaartha kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: baddha nivasaye nivaesiyek** (a resident of the confined dwelling).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Asalvaesiyeku gaes kaanduvak gaena daenum deemen pasuwa, gaes samaagame niladhaariyeku ema sthaanayata gaman karamin sitiyeya. Niladhaariya paemini vita, baddha nivaasaya pupura giye ya.""

Translation: ""The original resident (the one who needs gas) had to go to the gas gathering station. When the resident went, the confined dwelling became empty.""

This clearly indicates that the person who lived in the confined dwelling is the one who went to the gas station, and that dwelling became empty as a result. Therefore, the answer is a resident of the confined dwelling.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, p‍raharayen kopamana pirisak miya giyeda?","The answer is **A: 4**.

Here's why:

The question asks how many people were injured in the incident. The passage states that Edgar was injured (lost a hand and a foot), Christopher (the patient) suffered a complete lack of sensation, had a part of his face destroyed, and had titanium used in his reconstruction. 

Therefore, based on the provided text, at least 4 people were injured (Edgar, Christopher, and two others who were involved). Since the question asks about people injured *in the incident*, and Edgar and Christopher are clearly part of that incident, the most logical answer is 4.  The options provided are confusingly repeated.  The important thing is identifying the number of injured people.



"
p‍raharaya atharathura yam awasthaawaka wedi thaebeemata asamath wu aayudhaya kaageda?,"The correct answer is **C: shnayidar (snayidarta)**.

The passage states: ""...krestopher snayidarta ohuge muhunata pratinirmana shallyakarmayak kirimata sidu viya.""  This translates to ""...Christopher Snayidarta succeeded in performing reconstructive surgery on his face."" The question asks which entity's physical condition was affected. Snayidarta is the person who underwent the surgery and experienced the described issues.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kadabaek (elden):**  The passage mentions a 25-year-old ""elden"" (likely a typo for ""elder"" or a descriptor, not a person involved in the surgery).
* **B: ookaa:** This doesn't appear in the passage.
* **D: aelden (elder):** Same as above, not a person involved in the surgery.



"
olimpik vaedasatahanen iwath kirimata thora ganna ladde pahatha sandahan kreedawangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: karate**.

The text explicitly states: ""Skosh, karaate saha roller kreeda..."" (Karate, Judo and Roller sports...).  This indicates that karate was among the sports that were excluded from the Olympic program in 2005.
"
jaath‍yanthara olimpik kamituwa kreeda ulelata aethulath kirimata chandyen thora gaththe pahatha sandahan kreeda walin kumana kreedawada?,"The correct answer is **C: ragbi sangamaya (Rugby union)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ragby, visesayenma ragby yunion, saha golf salaka baleemata idiripath kala thavat kreeda pahak abhibava olympik sandaha sahabhagi weemata thoraganna ladi."" This translates to: ""Rugby, especially rugby union, along with golf, tennis, and badminton, are striving to gain participation in the Olympic arena.""

Therefore, rugby union is directly mentioned as one of the sports striving for Olympic inclusion.
"
aathar ginas mulinma shantha jems geyt skaagaraya baddata gaththe awurudu keeyak sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **A: 250**.

The question asks how many years it took for the business to grow to a certain level. The passage states: ""Vasara 250 kata pasu gines saema wasarakama euro biliyana 10 (ae.doo. biliyana 14.7) ka adayamak sahitha goleeya vyaparayak bavata vardhanaya viya.""  This translates to: ""After 250 years, the business grew to a turnover of 10 million euros (approximately 14.7 billion LKR).""

Therefore, the answer is 250.
"
saema wasarakama ginas dolar biliyana keeyak pamana gena enne da?,"The correct answer is **A: 9**.

The text states: ""Vasara 250 kata pasu gines saema wasarakama euro biliyana 10 (ae.doo. biliyana 14.7) ka adayamak sahitha goleeya vyaparayak bavata vardhanaya viya."" This translates to: ""After 250 years, Guinness's global business increased with a revenue of 10 billion euros (approximately 14.7 billion AED).""

The question asks for the revenue in billions of dollars. The text mentions the revenue in billions of euros, which is 10 billion euros.  The key piece of information is that the revenue increased *after* 250 years.  The number associated with the growth period is 250, not the revenue itself.

The question is phrased poorly, but it's trying to get at the period over which the growth occurred, which is 250 years. However, it's asking about the revenue *in dollars*, which isn't given.  Given the choices, the question is likely flawed and testing understanding of the provided information. The closest answer, though not explicitly stated, is related to the 9,000 (likely referring to 9,000 million, or 9 billion) mentioned earlier in the paragraph, which is the starting point.  However, it's important to recognize the ambiguity.

Since we have to choose from the given options, and the 250 refers to the period of growth, the most plausible (though not ideal) answer is **A: 9**, referencing the initial 9 billion.
"
yuropa sangamaye ratawal keeyaka H5N1 wairasaya handunagena thibe da?,"The correct answer is **B: hayaka** (Yes).

The text states: ""Oustriyavata, germaniyata, sloveniyavata, balgeriyavata, greesiyata saha italiyata pasuwa mema vairasayen pidavata path yuropa sangamaye satvaeni rata pranshaya we."" This translates to: ""Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy, after them, several countries of the European Union were affected by this virus.""

Therefore, the European Union countries are affected by the H5N1 virus.
"
H5N1 wairasaye nawathama rogiyaa handunaganu laebuwe koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: pranshaya (France)**.

The text states: ""Oustriyavata, germaniyata, sloveniyavata, balgeriyavata, greesiyata saha italiyata pasuwa mema vairasayen pidavata path yuropa sangamaye satvaeni rata pranshaya we.""  This translates to: ""After Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy, the virus spread to European Union countries, with France being one of them.""

Therefore, the new H5N1 virus cases were found in France.
"
saama sadhaka bhatayan wisin wu roga wyaapthiyata pera hayitiye mema rogaya awasan warata hamu wuye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 ganan waladee**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Hamudaa paminimata pera, 1800 gananvala sita haytiya rogaya sambandha gaetaluvalata muhuna dee tibune naetha.""  This translates to ""During the epidemic, within 1800 people, there were no symptoms related to the disease.""  Therefore, 1800 people were affected by the disease. The question asks about the number of people affected by the epidemic.
"
rogaya paethireema sandaha dayaka wu apadrawya kumana sthaanayen vida?,"The correct answer is **A: aartibonayit gaga (Gangaa atugangaavalata)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ema naduvata anuva, eksath jatinge kandavurin pita vena apedrawya nisilesa visabijaharanayata lak kara naethi baevin, hayitiye visaalatama gangaa athara ekak wana aatibonaite gange atugangaavalata baekteria aetulu wee aetha.""  This translates to: ""During this time, in an attempt to prevent the spread of the complex disease, they (likely authorities) released bacteria into the Gangaa river's tributaries.""

Therefore, the source where the disease originated/spread from is the Gangaa river's tributaries.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eksath jatheenge kandawura (Complex disease itself):** The disease is the *result* of the contamination, not the source.
* **C: 2010 bhoomikampawa sidu wu sthaanaya (Location where the 2010 earthquake occurred):**  While the earthquake might have contributed to the situation, the passage specifically points to the release of bacteria into the river as the direct cause.
* **D: yukthiya ha p‍rajathanth‍ravadaya sandaha wu hayiti aayatanaya (Area with the theoretical and democratic approach):** This refers to a broader approach to understanding the disease, not a specific location of its origin.



"
ayarlantha rajaya kumak kirimata saelasumkara thibeda?,"The correct answer is **C: mathdrawya walata awasara deema sambandhayen neethi lihil kirima**

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""...mathdrawya sambandha dandana pilibanda soukya amaathyavaraya kanassalla pala kaleya."" This translates to ""...the parliament has made rules regarding the punishment related to drug use.""

Option C, ""mathdrawya walata awasara deema sambandhayen neethi lihil kirima"" (making rules regarding punishment related to drug use), directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mathdrawya javarama sambandha ayata waradkaruwan kirima** (implementing a system for drug control) - The text mentions rules about punishment, not a comprehensive control system.
* **B: mathdrawya walata awasara deema sambandhayen daedi neethi handunva deema** (making urgent rules regarding drug use) - The text doesn't specify urgency, just that rules were made.
* **D: mathdrawya thahanama iwath kirima** (increasing the punishment for drug use) - The text doesn't mention increasing punishment; it simply states that rules *regarding punishment* were made.



"
ayarlanthaye thawakaalikawa neeth‍yaanukula wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: mathdrawya (drugs)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""adaala drawyavala thaavakalika nityaanukulabhaavayen prayojana ganna pudgalayange subhasaadhanaya saha **mathdrawya** sambandha dandana pilibanda soukya amaathyavaraya kanassalla pala kaleya.""

This translates to: ""...the judiciary, with a tendency towards habitual normalcy, has not enforced the proper punishment concerning **drugs** and the well-being of those who seek them.""

Therefore, the text explicitly mentions ""mathdrawya"" (drugs) as a subject related to the judiciary's lack of enforcement. The other options aren't mentioned in the context of the judiciary's actions.
"
saeka katayuthu waradkaru sambandhawa wimarshanaya karanne kumak pilibandawa da?,"The correct answer is **A: anawasarayen aethulu vima (unnecessary interference)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""anavasarayen aetulu weema sambandhava vimarsana karana bavayi"" which translates to ""unnecessary interference regarding the intervention [or action] is being criticized"". The question asks what the criticism is *about*. Therefore, the criticism is about the unnecessary intervention.
"
"lakuna wenas karana wita, saekakaru nokale kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: eya wenas kirimata taarpawlin bhawitha kirima**.

Here's why:

The original text states that the ""aenjalas"" are causing damage through the ""taarpawlin bhaavitha kara"" (taarpawlin-affected/caused) heat. The question asks what the damage is *to* the ""lakuna"" (the village/area).  The text directly links the damage to the taarpawlin-affected heat.

Let's break down the options:

*   **A: ehi ek akurak wenas kirima (some kind of thing)** - This is too vague and not directly supported by the text.
*   **B: saamaya lakunakin eya alankaara kirima (decorating it with ordinary things)** - The text clearly indicates damage, not decoration.
*   **C: eyata bhawthikawa haani kirima (causing physical damage to it)** - While the text mentions physical damage *now*, the primary focus of the ""aenjalas'"" action is the heat affecting the area.
*   **D: eya wenas kirimata taarpawlin bhawitha kirima (causing damage through its taarpawlin-affected/caused nature)** - This aligns directly with the text's statement that the damage occurs through the heat generated by the taarpawlin effect.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided text.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ingreesi guruwarayaa wana kaanota chodna nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: prakaashana himikam ullanghanaya kirima (publishing violations)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the English teacher was ""charged with publishing violations"" and ""had to undergo investigation.""  The other options are mentioned as things he *did*, but the passage explicitly links the investigation and the subsequent questioning to the publishing violations.

* **B: sisuwiyaka samaga pem sabandathawak paevaethvima (having a love relationship with a student):**  While this is a serious offense, the passage doesn't directly state he was investigated *for* this. It mentions it as part of the accusations against him.
* **C: anawasara welanda daenvim mudranaya kirima (unnecessary grand gestures):** This is mentioned, but not linked to the formal investigation.
* **D: panthiyedee ashishta bhashawa bhawitha kirima (speaking inappropriate language in public):** This is also mentioned, but not the primary reason for the investigation.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, rolaendo mendosa wisin p‍rana aepayata ganu nolaebuwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: sanchaarakayin (journalist)**.

The passage states: ""Ronaldo Mendosa ohuge m16 raifalayen sanchaarakayin desata vedi thabuweya"" which translates to ""Ronaldo Mendosa shot and killed a journalist with an M16 rifle.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kalin nidhaskara aethi bawa thahawuru nowu p‍rana aepakaruwan kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: chayaarupa shilpeen (sculptor)**.

Here's why:

The question asks who *helped* the sculptor to bring the statue to life. The passage states: ""Pilipina chaayaarupa shilpin men lamun saha vaedihitiyan aetulu praana aepakaruvan hiya deneku kalin nidahas karana ladi."" This translates to: ""The Philippine sculptor, with the help of the doctor and the craftsmen, fought to bring the statue to life.""

Therefore, the sculptor, along with the doctor and craftsmen, worked together to give the statue life.  Among the options, only ""chayaarupa shilpeen"" (sculptor) is the direct answer to who was involved in that process. The passage specifies the sculptor, and the question asks who helped *bring the statue to life*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sanchaarakayin (cameraman):**  The passage mentions a cameraman, but it doesn't state they helped bring the statue to life. The cameraman was present at the crime scene.
* **B: vaedihitiyan (doctor):** The passage mentions a doctor, but it doesn't state they helped bring the statue to life. The doctor was one of the helpers.
* **D: lamun (model):** The passage mentions a model, but it doesn't state they helped bring the statue to life. The model was the subject of the sculpture.

"mema chedayata anuwa, b‍raseelaye samalingika wivaha neethigatha kirimata sahaya dakwamin athsan raes karanne kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: romanu katholika palliya (Roman Catholic Church)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""romaanu katolika sabhaava ema rata thula sama lingika vivaha kireema sandaha digatama viruddha wee atha"" which translates to ""the Roman Catholic Church in this country is strongly against same-sex marriage.""
* **The text also mentions:** ""Mul ketumpata savo paavulohi hitapu purapati martha suplici visin ketumpat karana ladi"" meaning ""Initially, the Pope, through Martha Suplicy, fought against this.""  While Martha Suplicy was a prominent figure, the *institution* opposing the marriage is the Catholic Church.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: wirodhathakaruwan (Opponents):** This is too general. While opponents exist, the text highlights the specific stance of the Catholic Church.
    * **B: roberto jefarsan (Roberto Jefferson):** The text mentions him in the context of legislative efforts but doesn't portray him as the main force opposing the marriage.
    * **D: martha sapleesee (Martha Suplicy):**  She was a key figure *fighting against* the marriage, not the institution opposing it.



Therefore, the Roman Catholic Church is the primary entity the question asks about in relation to opposing same-sex marriage in Brazil.



"
wirodhathakaruwan thama pethsama idiripath karanne kaatada?,"The correct answer is **A: romanu katholika palliya (Roman Catholic Church)**.

The text states that the Roman Catholic Church in Brazil has been strongly against same-sex marriage for 10 years and has been actively lobbying against it in the national congress.  The Roman Catholic Church is the entity that opposes same-sex marriage in Brazil, as mentioned in the provided text.

"aamand warsache ge ginumata anuwa, minisun kaalaguna wenas vimata p‍rathichaara daekvimata perathuwa sidu vi aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: ohuta pawule samajikayekwa maga haerini (her humanitarian and compassionate nature)**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes a person who:

* **Experiences hardship:**  They mention a long and difficult journey (sandarsanayata minittu pahak thibiyadi sulangak hamaa yannata patan ganee).
* **Shows concern for others:** They describe helping vulnerable people (""aabaadhitha pudgalayan dedeneku dutuva,"" meaning ""giving to the disabled"").
* **Expresses empathy:** They mention feeling saddened by the suffering of others (""minisun ovun mathin panimin saha ovun thallu karamin sitiya,"" meaning ""being saddened by the suffering of people and their struggles"").
* **Lacks personal comforts:** They mention being without loved ones and possessions (""Mata mage soyuriya saha aege mituriya nathi vuna"").

All these aspects point to a person with a strong humanitarian and compassionate character.  Option D directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ahasin hima kaeta vaeteema aarambha wiya (started to be very angry)** - The text shows sadness and empathy, not anger.
* **B: sandarshanaya winadi pahak p‍ramada wiya (became very proud immediately after the journey)** - The text describes hardship, not pride.
* **C: daedi sulan haemeeya (a very cruel person)** - The text clearly depicts a kind and compassionate individual.

"warsacheta anuwa, wada daedi sulan aarambha wuye kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: sandarshanaya aarambha vi miniththu kihipayakata pasu** (After the tour started, after the person spoke).

Here's why:

This indicates the events described happened *after* the tour began and the person started speaking.  Option A directly reflects this sequence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vaessen pasuwa** (After years) - The text doesn't specify a long time passing.
* **C: ohuta thama sahodriya ahimi wu pasu** (After the brother/sister became a relative) - This is irrelevant to the sequence of events described.
* **D: hima kaeta warshawata pera** (After the next year) - This is not directly mentioned in the text.



"
"f‍red ta pera, batahira anshaka 35ta naegenahirin p‍radhaana kunatu keeyak vaartha vi thibeda?","The correct answer is **D: ekkeneku** (one).

Here's why:

The question asks how many primary challenges Fred faced. The passage explicitly states: ""Fred ta pera, batahira anshaka 35ta naegenahirin p‍radhaana kunatu keeyak vaartha vi thibeda?"" which translates to ""Fred, out of 35 primary challenges faced, had one main challenge?"".

The passage also mentions ""Fred, 35 w hi naegenahira vaartha woo thewana pradhaanathama chanda maaruthaya wei"" which means ""Fred, who faced 35 primary challenges, the main challenge was the strong wind"".

Therefore, Fred had **one** main challenge: the strong wind.
"
f‍red kep werd doopath asala sitina wita eya gaman kale kumana dishawata da?,"The correct answer is **D: wayamba desata**.

Here's why:

The question asks where Fred went. The text states: ""Fred me wana vita paeyakata saethapum 105 ka (paeyata kilo meetara 165) wegayen hamana sulang sahitava vayamba desata gaman karamin sitiyi.""  This translates to ""Fred, with a speed of 105 km/h (kilometers per hour), traveling with a luggage, went to **wayamba desata**.""
"
ehi purogameenta wada vaedi wegayak aethi pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The question states that 802.11n is mentioned as having a theoretical maximum speed of 600 Mbps.  The question asks which of the listed options has this speed. Therefore, 802.11n is the correct answer.
"
802.11b samaga pasupasata anukula vimata 802.11n sandaha awashya wana kondesi monavada?,"The correct answer is **A: wada saelakiya yuthu wegayak (theoretical maximum speed)**.

Here's why:

* **802.11n is backward compatible:** The question states that the 802.11n router is compatible with 802.11b. This means 802.11n can operate on the 2.4 GHz band, which is also used by 802.11b.
* **Backward compatibility doesn't require specific conditions:**  While 802.11n is *faster* than 802.11b, being compatible doesn't mean the router needs to operate on 5 GHz or have a specific condition for 802.11b to work.  The basic requirement is that the 802.11n router supports the 2.4 GHz band, which 802.11b also uses.
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: 802.11b sandaha 5.0Ghz matha kriyaa kirime haekiyaawa (802.11b can operate on 5.0 GHz):** 802.11b operates on the 2.4 GHz band, *not* 5 GHz.
    * **C: 600Mbit/s ka p‍rathidanaya (600 Mbit/s transmission):**  600 Mbit/s is the theoretical maximum speed of 802.11n, but it's not a *condition* for compatibility with 802.11b. 802.11n can still function with slower speeds when communicating with 802.11b devices.
    * **D: dwithwa rediyo (dual radio):** While the router having dual radios (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz) is common with 802.11n routers, it's not a *requirement* for compatibility with 802.11b. A single-radio 802.11n router can still be compatible.



Therefore, the most accurate and general answer is that the 802.11n router supports the 2.4 GHz band, allowing backward compatibility with 802.11b. The 600 Mbit/s speed is the theoretical *maximum* possible performance, not a *requirement* for compatibility."
poduraajya mandaleeya kreeda ulele olimpik ran padkkam labhiyaa pihinum isaw keeyaka sahabhagee wida?,"The correct answer is **C: dekak (two)**.

Here's why:

The question asks how many sports are included in the Podurajya Mandaleeya Kreeda Ulele (Provincial Sports Festival) where athletes can win an Olympic gold medal. The provided text states that athletes in specific categories (100m, 200m, hurdles, and relay) are selected to participate.  Since the question refers to ""Olympic gold medals"", it implies the sports included in the festival that lead to Olympic qualification.  The text then mentions ""aara saha sahaaya pihinum tharaga tunakata sahabhaagivimata niyamithawa sity namuth"" meaning athletes can participate in these categories to be regularly selected.  While not explicitly stating the number of sports, the context strongly implies there are two sports (likely track and field events) which offer a path to Olympic qualification through this festival.

The other options are not supported by the text:

* **A: pahaka (three)** -  The text mentions four categories, but doesn't directly state three sports.
* **B: thideneku (four)** - While four categories are mentioned, the question is about the number of sports, not categories.
* **D: hathara deneku (six)** - The text only explicitly mentions four categories.



"
olimpik ran padkkamlabhiyaa ohuge wedanawa sandaha awshadha nogaththe aeyi?,"The correct answer is **C: eya ohuge shareera yogyathawayata ahithakara lesa balapanu aethaeyi ohu saelakilimath wiya**

Here's why:

* **The question asks why an Olympic medalist wouldn't need medication for pain.** The first paragraph states that Olympic medalists, while training hard, generally don't need medication for pain because they have developed physical fitness that makes them resilient to minor injuries and discomfort.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuta kisidu wedanawak nothibuni (He doesn't feel any pain).** This is too extreme.  Olympic athletes experience pain, but their physical conditioning allows them to manage it.
* **B: eya ohuta asaneepa thaththwayak aethi kaleya (He's a strong athlete).** While true, it doesn't directly address *why* he wouldn't need medication.  Strength is a result of his resilience, not the reason for avoiding medication.
* **D: poduraajya mandaleeya kreeda ulele eyata awasara naetha (He didn't need to compete in the provincial league).** This is irrelevant to the question about pain and medication.



Therefore, option C best explains the situation based on the information given in the first paragraph."
"mema chedayata anuwa, bhoomikampa kriyaakaarakam pilibanda wyaakulathwayata hethu wiya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: anduru walakulu thibeema (rumors spreading)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sathya pipirimak sidu vuye da yanna pilibandava vyaakulatavak valaakulu magin penee giye ya."" This translates to ""The anxiety regarding the truth (of the earthquake) spread through rumors."" 

The other options are less directly linked to the reported anxiety:

*   **B: ayislantha kaalaguna widyaa kaaryaalaye vaarthawa (news from the Icelandic Meteorological Department)** - While the initial report might have come from there, the passage focuses on the spread of rumors *about* the earthquake's cause, not the initial news itself.
*   **C: jaath‍yanthara bhoomikampa sithiyama (the presence of inter-plate earthquakes)** - This is a geological fact but doesn't directly explain *why* people are anxious.
*   **D: ayislanthaye wenath p‍radeshawala vaartha wu kriyaakaarakam (the news from the affected region in Iceland was the cause)** - The passage doesn't say the Icelandic news was the cause of the anxiety, only that rumors *about* the cause were spreading.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, adiyara wenasak sidu wuye kawadadaa?","The correct answer is **C: marthu 10 wenida** (ten days).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Adiyara wenasweemak aethi karavamin saelakiya yuthu mattame bhu kampana kriyaakaarakamak maarthu 10 wana dina ginikandu mudunata kalderavehi eesaana desin siduwee aetha."" This translates to: ""Only the Adiyara wanasweemak (earthquake) was the cause of the tremors, and the tremors subsided after approximately 10 days.""

Therefore, the answer to the question ""mema chedayata anuwa, adiyara wenasak sidu wuye kawadadaa?"" (What was the duration of the tremors from the Adiyara wanasweemak?) is ten days.



"
chandrayaan-1 ge chandra gaweshanaya pilibandawa sath‍ya nowana p‍rakaashaya wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: gaweshana yaanaye vaedgath upakarana thibuni** (The research vehicle had scientific instruments).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Vaedagat vidyaatmaka upakarana thunak gena yaamata atirekava chandra eshanaya saema paettakama paata kara thibu indiya jaathika kodiye rupayak da raegena giyeya."" This translates to: ""The Indian flag, an extraordinary achievement, was planted on the Moon's southern pole by the research vehicle equipped with scientific instruments.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: gaweshana yaanaya diyath kala kak‍shayata kaarya mandalayak sitayeya** (The research vehicle had a functional module in the orbit): While true, this is a general fact about the mission. The passage specifically highlights the scientific instruments.
* **C: gaweshana yaanaya muda haereema saarthaka wiya** (The research vehicle's journey was not worthwhile):  The passage clearly states the mission was worthwhile and achieved a significant milestone (planting the flag).
* **D: gaweshana yaanaye paata kala paethi thibuni** (The research vehicle had a communication system): This is also a general fact. The passage focuses on the scientific instruments and the flag planting.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
chandra gaweshanaya niwaerediwa wisthara karanne pahatha sandahan p‍rakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: eya chandrayaage uthuru dhraewayata aasannawa goda baesseya** (It orbited close to the south pole of the Moon).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ya saarthakava chandrayaage dakshina draevaya asannayata kada vaetuni."" ( ...it was significant when it orbited close to the south pole of the Moon).  The question asks what the lunar exploration aimed to achieve through detailed research.  The passage directly connects the significance of the mission to its orbit around the south pole.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ehi hadisi godabaema saarthaka wiya** (It was a highly successful endeavor): While the mission was successful, the passage doesn't specifically say it was *highly* successful in general. It highlights the importance of the south pole orbit.
* **C: eya minisun sahitha kak‍shayakin muda harina ladee** (It orbited with the Minisun satellite):  The passage mentions the Minisun satellite as part of the mission, but it doesn't say the satellite orbited *with* it in the same way as the lunar orbiter orbited the Moon.
* **D: eya vaedgath upakarana dekak raegena yamin thibuni** (It carried a scientific instrument):  The passage mentions scientific instruments, but it doesn't link them to the *detailed research* goal.  The focus is on the strategic advantage of the south pole orbit for research.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, awasana washayen kriyaathmaka karanu labana roga vaelaekvime piyawara wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: enseflayitis ennath**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Me vasare, aitihaasikava vadaat balapaemata lak woo pradeshawalata ennath labaa deemata saelasum pramaada vuye, aramudal nomaetikama saha wenath rogavalata saapeksava adu pramukhataavaya labeema hetuveni. **Enseflayitis ennath kuppi miliyana gananavak labadimata rajaya ekagha wee aetha.**""

This directly translates to: ""This year, despite the historical strength of many provinces, the country is facing a significant increase in various diseases, primarily **encephalitis**.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions encephalitis as a major health concern. The other options are mentioned as potential causes or treatments, but encephalitis is directly identified as a prominent disease.



"
mema rogaya minisunta samp‍reshanaya wanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **A: maduruwangen**.

The text states: ""mema rogaya uran magin sampreshanaya karanu labana athara pasuwa **maduruwangen** haraha minisun wetha aasaadanaya we.""  This translates to ""I informed the minister about this disease after receiving a response from Maduruwangan.""

Therefore, ""maduruwangen"" is the correct answer.
"
dewana waganthiye asaarthakathwaya hethu wiya haekke kumana p‍rathiphalayata da?,"The correct answer is **A: HJR-3 pilibanda k‍shanika samalochanayak (Immediate evaluation of HJR-3)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the evaluation of the ministerial decision regarding same-sex marriage (which led to the policy being adopted) was delayed until 2015-2016. The HJR-3 (presumably a document related to this decision) was subject to immediate evaluation, but that evaluation was delayed.  The question asks what consequence arose from the ""asaarthakathwaya"" (meaninglessness/futility) of the ministerial decision. The text directly links this futility to the delayed evaluation of HJR-3.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: samalingika siwil ekathuvimwala anagatha ayithivasikamak (Future impact on same-sex marriage):** While the decision *impacts* same-sex marriage, the text doesn't directly state the consequence of the decision's futility is a future impact.
*   **C: hadisi vyavasthaadayaka saesivarayak (New regulatory framework):** The text mentions a new regulatory framework, but doesn't connect its development directly to the delay in evaluating the ministerial decision.
*   **D: samalingika siwil ekathuvim thahanam kirima (Prohibition of same-sex marriage):** The text focuses on the *decision* regarding same-sex marriage, not necessarily its outright prohibition. The delay in evaluation stemmed from concerns about the decision's validity.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dewana waganthiya makaa daemuwe kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: vyavasthaadayaka saesiya atharathura** (the organizational decision).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Based on this text, what was the decision of the organizational decision?"" (mema chedayata anuwa, dewana waganthiya makaa daemuwe kawadada?)
* **The text states:** ""Niyojitha manthri mandalaya visin palamuwa devana waganthiya makaa damanu laebiimen pasuwa mema niti sampaadana saesiyata venas kireemak sidu karana lada athara inpasu e aakarayenma senat mandalaya visin sanduda anumatha karana ladi.""  (After receiving the approval of the organized cabinet, efforts were made to achieve the implementation of this policy and to obtain approval from the cabinet regarding its scope.) This implies the *decision* regarding the implementation and scope was made by the organizational decision.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: 2011 dee** (of 2011): While 2011 is mentioned as the year of the organized cabinet's approval, it's not the *decision* itself.
    * **C: sanduda** (scope): ""Sanduda"" refers to the scope, not the decision.
    * **D: 2015 dee** (of 2015):  2015 and 2016 are mentioned in relation to the organizational decision's action plan, but again, not the decision itself.



"
“paenama path‍rikaa” anawaranaya wuye kaa hatada?,"The correct answer is **A: mosaek fonsekaa samagama**.

The text states: ""mema lekhana magin, badhu saha wenath regulaasi magahaereemata dhanavat sevaadayakayanta amerikaanu dollar biliyana gananak saengavimata upakaara kala baenku dahahatarak pilibandava helidarav viya. **Brithanya puvathpathak wana da gaardiyan pavasaa sitiye mema aramuna saakshaath karagaenima sandaha bhavitha woo shell samaagam 1200 n thunen dekak pamana paalanaya kale doyish baenkuva bavayi.**"" 

This indicates that Mosaik Fonseca, along with other banks, was involved in the data leak. The question asks who is associated with the ""Panama Papers"" leak, and the text explicitly mentions Mosaik Fonseca.
"
"ema chedayata anuwa, dhanaya saegavimata bhawitha kala boho samagam kalamanakaranaya kala bawa b‍rithan‍ya maadhya kiyaa sitiye kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: doyish baenkuwa**.

The passage states: ""Brithanya puvathpathak wana da gaardiyan pavasaa sitiye mema aramuna saakshaath karagaenima sandaha bhavitha woo shell samaagam 1200 n thunen dekak pamana paalanaya kale doyish baenkuva bavayi."" This translates to: ""The British newspaper The Guardian reported that Shell Corporation had been under scrutiny for 1200 days due to compliance with two banks.""

Therefore, the British newspaper reported scrutiny of **two banks** regarding compliance.
"
vaedima marana sankyaawak siduwa aeththe pahatha sandahan guwan yaana anathuru walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: mashhad hi guwan yaanaya anathurata lak wiya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Pasugiya maasaye dee aameniyaava balaa yamin sity guvan yaanayak anaturata lakweemen vasara gananak thula sidu woo darunuthama guvan vyasanayata iraanaya muhuna dunne ehi sity 168 deneku jivitaksayata path karamini. Ema maasayema thavat guvan yaanayak maashad hidee pathaya ikmavaa dhaawanaya wee perali thaappayaka haepimen daahath deneku maranayata path wanawa dutimu.""

This translates to: ""In the past month, the forces of Armenia were violently present, and a terrible death occurred due to a poisoned guvan yaanayak (a guvan vehicle) that caused 168 deaths. In the same month, another guvan yaanayak was found with a hidden path, and a perali thaappayaka (a type of poison) was administered, leading to death.""

The passage mentions deaths caused by poisoned guvan yaanayak *in Mashhad*. Therefore, option D is the accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: iranaye sita aarmeniyaawa bala yamin sitiya dee guwan yaanaya anathurata lak wiya** - This is partially true about the Armenia forces being present, but it doesn't specify the location of the deaths.
* **B: polis helikoptar yaanaya anathurata lak wiya** - The passage mentions a police helicopter *being present*, but not directly causing deaths.
* **C: aarmeniyaawe sita iranayata yana atharamagadee yaanaya anathurata lak wiya** - This describes a scenario not mentioned in the passage.



"
iranaye siduwana guwan anathuru bahulavimata hethuwak nowanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: nawa guwan yaana miladee gaeneema walakwana jaath‍yanthara thahanam (Discrimination related to the acquisition of new vehicles)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the recent increase in deaths related to the illegal transportation of goods is linked to **discrimination** when acquiring new vehicles. The text mentions that a new vehicle was acquired in a discriminatory manner, and this contributed to the tragic events.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: paerani siwil ha hamuda guwan yaana thogayak thibeema (The existence of illegal civilian and commercial vehicles):** While the existence of these vehicles is a problem, the passage focuses on *why* the problem has worsened recently.  It directly connects the worsening to discrimination in acquiring new vehicles.
* **B: nawa guwan yaana miladee gaeneema sandaha ayavaeya nomaethikama (Unethical aspects related to the acquisition of new vehicles):**  This is too broad. The passage specifies *discrimination* as the unethical aspect.
* **D: durwala lesa nadaththukarana lada guwan yaana thogayak thibeema (The existence of vehicles operated with minimal safety):**  While unsafe vehicles are part of the problem, the passage directly points to discrimination in acquiring *new* vehicles as a significant contributing factor.



Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the primary cause of the increased deaths mentioned in the passage.



"

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the rapid growth and volatility of Iraq, leading to anxiety and uncertainty.** Option B directly reflects this by stating it sheds light on the aspects of Iraq's growth and volatility.
* **The text discusses the challenges facing Iraq, including the current political situation and the need for a new president to address these issues.** Option B connects this to the understanding of Iraq's growth and volatility.
* **Option A (wathman p‍rathipaththiya wiwechanaya kirima - critical analysis of the current situation) is partially true, but not the primary focus of the passage.** The passage discusses more than just criticism; it aims to understand the complexities.
* **Option C (Iraaqaye deshaseema surak‍shitha kirimata saha ehi asalvaasin samaga thaanaapathi sabandathaa naewatha aarambha kirimata - regarding the protection of Iraq's borders and the establishment of relations with its native inhabitants) is a specific detail mentioned in the text, but not the overarching theme.**
* **Option D (eksath janapada podu ekagathawak sandaha aayaachanayak - a coordinated approach regarding the common people) is also a specific detail and doesn't encompass the broader scope of the passage.**

Therefore, Option B best encapsulates the overall message of the text: to understand the dynamics of Iraq's growth and volatility.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the escalating violence and unrest in Iraq.**  The first paragraph specifically mentions ""vardhanaya wana prachandatvayak"" (increasing violence and intensity) and "" vyaakulatvaya desata aedi yamak navatvana bavata kisivekuta sahatika kala nohaeki bhava emagin anaturu angavayi"" (a state of agitation, a situation where people are unable to live peacefully, experiencing unimaginable horrors).

* **The passage *does* mention the new president's actions.** The last paragraph describes the new president's efforts to regain control of the country and establish relations with the indigenous people. While important, the escalating violence is the primary focus of the beginning of the article.

* **Options B, C, and D are not the main points.** While the situation is tense (B), there's no specific mention of a short-term solution (B) or the immediate actions of the new president (D) as the central point of the article.  The ""wiwurtha wivada bhawitha kirima"" (potential for further conflict - C) is a *result* of the escalating violence, not the core theme being highlighted in the introductory paragraphs.

Therefore, option A most accurately reflects what the passage *does* highlight at the beginning of the article.
"
"polisiyata anuwa, prowensanoge dakunath minisa lesa salakanu laebuwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: lo pikkoolo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Polisiya paevasu paridi paelarmohidee provensanoge dakunu atha men sity baevin low pikolo mehi pradhaanathvaya ganna athara ohuge vishaala athdaekim pramaanaya..."" This translates to: ""The police, having failed to address the situation, appointed Lo Piccolo as the head of the province due to his great strength and power...""

Therefore, Lo Piccolo was appointed as the head of the province by the police.
"
mema chedaye sandahan kara aethi thorathuru anuwa faelkoonge maranayata hethu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: reena wisin meheyawana lada yuddhayedee ohu mara damana ladee**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""1992 dee mafia kurusa yuddha bhatayan wana geovani falcon saha pavulo borselinoge jivita biligath rajayata erehi rayina visin meheyavana lada yuddhaya avasan karana vita provensano visin mema pradhanin nawatha sevaye yodava tibuni.""

This translates to: ""To end the war that ravaged Provence following the deaths of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borselino in 1992, a war fought against the mafia, I joined the new service in Provence as the chief.""

The question asks what caused Falcone's death. The text implies that Falcone's death was a result of the war against the mafia, specifically the conflict with the ""meheyawana lada"" (mafia war).  The statement that the war ended *after* Falcone's and Borselino's deaths suggests the war was directly responsible for their demise.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ohu polisiya wisin ghaathanaya karana ladee (He was plotting against the police):** The text indicates he *joined* the police service, not plotted against them.
* **C: lo pikkoolota ohuwa mara daemeemata niyoga karana ladee (He was employed to assassinate Lo Piccolo):**  There's no mention of Lo Piccolo or assassination in the text.
* **D: ohu maerune ohuge mafiyaa kurusa yuddhaye sagayaa wana pawulo borselino wisini (He was a participant in the mafia war alongside his mafia rivals regarding Paolo Borselino):** The text suggests he was fighting *against* the mafia and the war resulted in Borselino's death. He wasn't with rivals.



"

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Hitapu olympik ha loka shurayaku da woo saito miya yana vita samastha japaana judo kamituve sammelanaye puhunu kamituve sabhaapativarayaava sitiye ya.""  This translates to: ""The Olympic and world champion Woo Saito, who has been at all Japan judo association conferences, is the chairman of the conference.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: loka shoorathawa dewarak (world champion):** While he *is* a world champion, the question asks about a *title* he currently holds, and the text emphasizes his role as chairman of the association.
* **C: dewarak olimpik ran padkkamlabhee (Olympic gold medalist):**  He *is* an Olympic gold medalist, but again, the text highlights his leadership role.
* **D: judo wisheshanga (judo specialist):** This is too general.  He's a *specific* specialist with a particular role in the Judo community.



"
tharjana walin vaelakee siteemata ivasaki samath wuye koheda?,"The answer is **D: tibetaya**.

Here's why:

The first sentence describes someone who went through a bohemian lifestyle, lived in a tent, traveled to Tibet to look for spiritual enlightenment, got married in Nepal, and eventually came to India seeking understanding.  The question asks where they went to find *spiritual enlightenment*. The text explicitly states they went to **Tibet** for that purpose.
"
ivasakita pahara dunne kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: ohuge anagatha kalath‍rayaa (his future)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes someone who has lived a very nomadic life, traveling through many places and experiencing many things. The question asks ""What is the watchman of his life?"" The passage implies that his life's journey and future experiences are what guide him. The phrase ""anagatha kalath‍rayaa"" directly translates to ""his future.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: muhudu kollakaruwan (his past):** While the passage mentions his past travels, the question asks about the ""watchman"" or guiding force of his *life*, not just his history.
* **C: ballek (strength/power):**  Strength or power isn't the guiding force described in the text.
* **D: polisiya (police):** This is completely unrelated to the context of the passage.



"

The text states: ""Mayikal shoomaakar, alonsota pasuwa waedi kaalayak gatha weemata pera tharagaya avasan kale, tharagaya thula pawathi tharangakari satan gananaavakin pasuwa avalambanayata sidu woo haaniyana nisaaveni.""  This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher, after having a setback in the pit stop behind Alonso, suffered a lot of damage to his car, and after a few laps he was unable to catch up to Alonso.""

Therefore, Schumacher's setback (having a problem in the pit stop) *caused* Alonso to extend his lead.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: fisichela ta ohuge motar rathaye palanaya ahimi wiya** (Fisichella's car performance was poor): While Fisichella's car performance might have been poor, the text doesn't directly link that to Alonso extending his lead.
*   **C: shumakar ohugema dhaawana tharagaya awasan kirimen pasu** (After Schumacher's car suffered damage): The text mentions Schumacher suffered damage but doesn't say that *after* he suffered damage Alonso extended his lead. In fact the text says Alonso *extended* his lead *because* Schumacher had a problem.
*   **D: peramuna gaeneemata pera** (Because of the pit stop): This is too general. While the pit stop was a factor, it was *specifically* the setback *behind* Alonso that caused the problem.

"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mayikal shoomaakar, alonsota pasuwa waedi kaalayak gatha weemata pera tharagaya avasan kale, tharagaya thula pawathi tharangakari satan gananaavakin pasuwa avalambanayata sidu woo haaniyana nisaaveni.""

This translates to: ""Michael Schumacher, after driving behind Alonso for a while, finished the race last because his car's aerodynamics were damaged after hitting debris on the track.""

Therefore, the damage to the aerodynamics is the reason Schumacher finished last. Options A, B, and C are incorrect based on the information provided.

"mema chedayata anuwa, ath adanguwata path wuwan sandaha aepa labaa gaeneema wuye kaage wagakeemak da?","The correct answer is **D: adhikarana komasariswarayaa (the chartered accountant)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""athadanguvata path vuvan 80 kata waedi gananak sentral buking wethin nidahas karana ladi. Me vasare aprel masaye dee, ovun aetulu kara gath pasu adhikarana komasaarisvarayeku visin vibhaaga kireemak nolaeba paeya 24 ta adhika kaalayak randavaa aethi aya mudha haerima kriyaatmaka kirimata pahasukam saelaseemata viruddhava vinisuru glean visin thaavakalika raendavum niyogayak nikuth karanu laebuwe ya.""
* **Translation:** ""...he had to allocate 80 thousand rupees within the central booking. This year, in April, the chartered accountant had to allocate a period longer than 24 days for departmental segregation...""

This clearly indicates that the chartered accountant was responsible for the allocation and segregation of funds. The passage further explains the challenges and the need for a specific allocation method involving the chartered accountant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ath adanguwata gaeneeme niladhaariyaa (the person responsible for allocation):** While true, it's too general. The passage specifically identifies this person as the chartered accountant.
* **B: winisuru glin (the internal auditor):** The passage mentions internal auditing, but it's not the primary focus of the chartered accountant's responsibility in this scenario.
* **C: madhyama wenkirime pahasukama (the ease of average accounting):**  The passage discusses challenges and complexities, so it's the opposite of ease.

"mema chedaye sandahan thawakaalika varana niyogayata anuwa, ath adanguwata path pudgalayaa paeya 24 kata wada vaedi kaalayak randava thabaa gaeneemata nam owunta ida labaa diya yuththe kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **C: winisuru glin wisin nikuth karana lada nila chodna (Investigation regarding the illegal use of funds)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The central banking department initiated an investigation into the misuse of funds within the past year.
* **The question asks:** What is the reason for the temporary suspension of the person involved in the illegal use of funds?
* **The passage explicitly mentions:**  The temporary suspension is due to the investigation into the illegal use of funds and the need to prevent further misuse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aepa (No):** This is a simple denial and doesn't explain the reason for the suspension.
* **B: ath adanguwata gath niladhaariyaa samaga hamuwak (Cooperation with the person involved):**  The passage suggests the opposite - the person is being investigated, not cooperating.
* **D: nadu wibhaagayak (Central Department):** The central department *initiated* the investigation, but the suspension is specifically related to the *illegal use of funds*.



Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects the reason for the temporary suspension as outlined in the provided text.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, awalangu karana maethivaranaya paehaedili kirimata bhaavitha nokarana lada hethuwa kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: adhika viyadam (excessive distrust)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the leader's (niladharin) trust in the chief advisor (maetivaranayaka) and the guards (aarakshaka) is lacking (""niladharin tiranaya kala bhava lodin paewaseeya"" - the leader's confidence is declining).  This lack of trust leads to the leader's hesitancy to make decisions and rely on the Afghan system, causing delays (""athireka mahamaetivaranaya avalangu kireema aandukrama vyavasthaavata patahaeni vanu aetaeyi sandahan woo pere vaarthaa valata meya patahaeni we"" - the delay in making decisions due to the lack of trust in the chief advisor...causes significant issues).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: aarakshaka awadaanam (guard assistance/support):** While the guards are involved, the core issue isn't a lack of support from them, but rather distrust in the advisor *and* the overall system.
* **B: aandukrama vyawasthaawe parasparathaawak (mutual cooperation within the system):** The passage explicitly says the leader *doesn't* trust the Afghan system.  Cooperation isn't happening because of a lack of trust.
* **D: vyavasthaave bahu arthathaawa (multi-faceted system):**  The system's complexity isn't the root cause of the problem.  The issue is distrust of the people within the system.



Therefore, the **excessive distrust (adhika viyadam)** is the most logical reason the leader is hesitant to rely on the chief advisor and the Afghan system."
awasanaye raajya thanthrikayan visin mema maethivaranaya anawashya ekak lesa salakanu laebuwe aeyi?,"The correct answer is **C: vyavasthaave bahu arthathawak thibuni (The system has multiple interpretations.)**

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q) asks:** Why didn't the state administration easily accept the additional measures taken by the Chief Minister?

* **The Text (P) states:** ""Apathaavaya anavasya bata teerana kirimata afghan vyavasthaava bahu arthathaaven yuthu bhava thaman soyaagat bhava raajatantrikayo paevasuha."" This translates to: ""The Afghan system was in conflict due to the necessity of making a decision, leading to the state administration's hesitation.""  Crucially, it says the Afghan system was in *conflict* due to multiple interpretations (""bahu arthathaaven yuthu"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya vyavasthaavata patahaeni viya (It was due to the system's failure):** While there's a hesitancy, the text doesn't explicitly state a failure of the system. The problem is with *interpreting* the necessary actions.
* **B: aarakshaka avadaanamak thibuni (There was a protective stance):** The text doesn't mention a protective stance. It points to a conflict arising from multiple interpretations.
* **D: maethivarana viyadam itha waedi viya (The Chief Minister's decision was too drastic):** The text doesn't say the decision was *too* drastic. It focuses on the difficulties in accepting the additional measures due to conflicting interpretations within the system.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the reason for the state administration's hesitation, as indicated by the text."
FATA sandaha adhikarana sewa sapayanne kawuda?,"The correct answer is **B: deshapalana niyojithayan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...deshapaalana niyojitayan path kara thibe. mema niyojitayan paakisthana vyavasthaave 247 wana waganthiya yatathe raajya saha adhikarana sevaa saepayimata vaga kiyanu labayi."" 

This translates to: ""...the ""deshapaalana niyojitayan"" was implemented. Through this implementation, 247 departments were allocated to the Pakistani system, including state and administrative services.""

Therefore, the ""deshapaalana niyojitayan"" (governance plan) is the one that allocated the administrative services.
"
FATA hi “deshapalana niyojithayan” pilibanda pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen sathya nowanne kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: owun pakisthanaye vyavasthaavata anugatha wethi** (They are aligned with the Pakistani system).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the ""Deshapalana Niyojitayan"" (Governance Plan) aimed to bring the FATA (Federal Administration Tribal Areas) into the Pakistani administrative system.
*  It also mentions that 247 tribal councils were granted administrative and service authority *within* the Pakistani system.
* Options A, B, and D are not directly supported by the text. While the plan was implemented under the Pakistani government, the focus of the passage is on integrating FATA *into* the existing Pakistani system, not on the Pakistani President's decision or the FATA's desire for full independence.

Therefore, the most accurate statement is that the FATA was being integrated *within* the existing Pakistani administrative framework.
"
ema ston hata naama yojanaa dena lada sammanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: hondama niliya (good producer)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Rayan Gosling and Emma Stone are working on a project to name the films, and Emma Stone is acting as a ""good producer"" (hondama niliya) in this naming process. The passage emphasizes her involvement and the number of naming schemes they are exploring *with her*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hondama sahaya niliya (good assistant producer):**  The passage doesn't mention her being an assistant producer.
* **B: hondama adhyaksha (good director):** The passage focuses on naming schemes, not directing.
* **D: hondama chithrapata sanskaranaya (good film editor):** While film editing is part of filmmaking, the passage specifically highlights her role in *naming* the films.



"
mema chithrapataya sandaha naamayojanaa nolaebune kumana sammanaya sandaha da?,"The correct answer is **D: hondama mul geethaya (the best melody)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Chitrapataye githa dekak , audition (da fool hoo drim) saha sity of stars wetha hondama githayata himi naama yojanava laebini.""  This translates to: ""A song in the movie, audition (da fool hoo drim) and City of Stars, a name scheme was found in the best melody.""  Therefore, the best melody is the key element in the name scheme.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Bhoomikampaaven kisidu balapaemak sidu novoo bawath ehi shikaa nyashtika balaagaaraye anka 1 saha 2 prathikriyaakaaraka wasaa dama aethi bawath hokuriku viduli bala samaagama visin vaarthaa karana ladi."" This translates to: ""The earthquake caused damage to the Hokurikuge Shikabala Prison, specifically the 1st and 2nd reactive elements/parts of the prison's electrical power system.""

Therefore, the earthquake affected all the reactive elements (prathikriyaakaraka wasaa dama aethi) of the Hokurikuge Shikabala Prison's electrical system.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ishikawa hi guvan thotupala (Ishikawa and Guvan Thotupala):** The text mentions Ishikawa and Guvan Thotupala in the context of damage to the main road and disrupted services *outside* the prison.  They aren't directly related to the internal effects of the earthquake on the prison's systems.
* **C: siyaluma dumriya sewa (all Dumriya services):** While Dumriya services (likely Dumriya's services, a utility provider) were affected, the text specifically highlights the internal impact on the prison's electrical system and its reactive elements.
* **D: neegatha hi balaagarayak (the affected prison itself):** While the prison was affected, the question asks what *parts* of the prison were affected by the earthquake's reactive elements.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, bhoomikampawen haaniyata path wuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: samahara niwasa (damaged houses)**.

This translates to: ""Due to the damage to the main road infrastructure, the electricity supply was disrupted. As a result, the neighboring provinces also experienced a similar situation.""  The damage to the main road *infrastructure* directly impacted the houses.
* **Option A (damaged houses):** Directly reflects the impact of the road infrastructure damage, which led to house damage.
* **Option B (a reactive house):** This doesn't make sense in the context.
* **Option C (damaged road):** While the road was damaged, the question asks *what* was most affected. The houses were directly impacted by the road damage.
* **Option D (neighboring provinces):**  Neighboring provinces were affected due to the power outage, not directly by the road damage itself.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A: samahara niwasa (damaged houses)**."
"mema chedayata anuwa, lekhanayata aethulath nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan prashnawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: nimnaye hamuda yedaweema (the displacement of refugees)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ishrayalaya visin givisumak athsan kala pasu vasara dahayak yanatek nimnayehi akhanda hamudaa yedavimak illa sitina athara, ema hamuda yedavima avurudu pahak dakva pamanak labaadimata pa ekagha we.""  This translates to: ""After the establishment of Israel, for ten years, there was no possibility of returning to the homeland for the refugees, and they were forced to seek compensation.""  This directly refers to the displacement of refugees and the lack of return.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: jerusalame anaagathaya (the future of Jerusalem):** While Jerusalem is mentioned, the passage's main focus isn't solely on its future. It's about the refugee crisis.
* **B: 1967 yuddhayata hethuwa (caused by the 1967 war):** The passage mentions the 1967 war in relation to the area, but it's not the *cause* of the refugee situation described. The refugees were displaced earlier.
* **D: deshaseema pilibanda aarawula (disputes about borders):** Border disputes are alluded to, but the primary topic is the refugee issue.



Therefore, the displacement of refugees and their inability to return to their homeland is the central theme of the passage, making option C the most fitting answer."
palastheena illeemwalin ekak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: yuddhayata pera thathwayan matha padanam wu deshaseema** (The territorial boundaries that were determined by the 1967 Six-Day War).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""enam palastinayata awashya wana paridi 1967 maeda peradiga yuddhayata pere thibu desasima anuva we."" which translates to ""the territorial boundaries necessary for Palestine, that were determined by the 1967 Six-Day War.""
* **The question asks:** ""palastheena illeemwalin ekak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?"" meaning ""What is one of the things that the Palestinian leaders are currently seeking?""
* **The passage indicates that the core issue is the land boundaries established after the 1967 war.**  The other options are related but not the central point the passage highlights as a current demand of Palestinian leaders.



Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: jordan nimnaye daenata pawathina hamuda yedaweema** (The establishment of settlements in Jordan): While settlement is a related issue, the passage primarily focuses on the land boundaries *established in 1967*.
* **C: jerusalame anaagathaya pilibanda wu pilithuru** (Disputes regarding the future of Jerusalem): Jerusalem is mentioned as part of the territory, but the primary focus is on the *boundaries themselves*.
* **D: jordan nimnaye wasara pahaka hamuda yedaweemak** (The establishment of settlements in Jordan over the years): Similar to B, this is a related issue but not the central demand related to the 1967 boundaries.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because the passage directly connects the 1967 war's territorial boundaries to Palestine's needs and the question's inquiry about Palestinian leaders' current demands."
maa neethiya haedaeruwe kumana rate da?,"The correct answer is **A: aemarika eksath janapadaya**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Hon kong hi ipadunu maa, nivyok visvavidyaalaye saha havad niti vidyalaye adyaapanaya laebu athara varak aemerikaanu sthira padinciya labaadena ""green kaadpata"" da daeruveya."" This translates to: ""I am from Hong Kong, I want to get a ""green card"" to settle permanently in America after teaching at New York University and the School of Public Policy.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, maa ge maethivarana jayagrahanayata udaw kale kumana rata wenuwen penee siteemada?","The correct answer is **B: Hong Kong**.

Here's why:

The original text states that the person wants to obtain a ""green card"" to work at New York University and the School of Public Policy in the USA.  The context also mentions a desire for a strong relationship with China, and the text focuses on Hong Kong as a place where they might achieve this goal.  Therefore, Hong Kong is the most likely answer.

The question asks where the person might go to achieve their goal of obtaining a green card to work at the specified universities, given their desire for a strong relationship with China.  Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China, and a common location for people seeking to connect with both China and the US.
"
"mema chedaye sandahan wana paridi, kaerolin vilsan nagarayen pitaweemata pera waeda kale ka wenuwen da?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Locwood gardens hi kulikaruvan visvaasa karanne nivaasa vanchaavehi yedee hasu woo thavat okland hi podu nivaasa depala sambandhayen vimarsana kirimata **OHA polisiya** katayutu karana bavata ovun daenuvat woo baevin thavat pavul 40k ho wadi pramaanayak nerapa haerimata lak wana bavayi.""

This translates to: ""Locwood gardens, which people believe are causing housing evictions, are being criticized for their connection to **OHA police** regarding a law that allows for the eviction of up to 40,000 people.""

Therefore, OHA is the entity mentioned as being involved in the housing evictions. While the other options are mentioned, OHA is directly linked to the eviction process.
"
"mema tharaga waraye ithiriwa aethi tharaga hatharak samagin, dhaawana shurathaavaliye hatharawana sthaanaye sitinne kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: haemlin**.

Here's why:

* The question asks for the driver in fourth place overall.
* The text states: ""Thewana sthaanayata paemini haemlin lakunu vissak pitupasin sitina namuth boyarta vada pahak idiriyen sity."" This translates to ""In the second place, Paemini Haemlin was in the car with the number 20.""
* The text also says: ""khaan saha truveks juniyar piliwelin lakunu 2,220 k saha 2,207 k labaa pas wana saha hiya wana sthsanaye sititi.""  This means Khaan and Truveks Junior were in 4th and 5th place respectively.
* The text says ""Stewart, gordan, kenseth saha harvik yana aya riyaeduru shurathaavaye palamu dasadena atharata paemini athara tharaga waaraye thavat hatarak ithiriva pawathee."" meaning Stewart, Gordon, Kenseth and Harvik were in the top four drivers.
* Combining all the information, Haemlin was in 4th place.



"
"mema chedaye sandahan dhaawana tharagayen pasuwa, dhaawana shurathaavaliye kahn sathuwa lakunu keeyak thibeda?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The question asks for the *lowest* amount in the winning race after the final lap. The passage states:

*   Lakunu 2,250 k labaa ganimin keselowski dhaawana shurathaavaliye pramukhaya lesa sity (Keselowski led the final lap with 2,250 k).
*   Johnson 2,243 k labaa devana sthaanayata path wei (Johnson finished second with 2,243 k).
*   Hemlin 2,220 k saha truveks juniyar piliwelin lakunu 2,207 k labaa pas wana saha hiya wana sthsanaye sititi (Hemlin finished third with 2,220 k, and Truvix Junior finished fourth with 2,207 k).

Therefore, the lowest amount is 2207. However, 2220 is also listed as a possible answer. Since Hemlin finished third with 2,220k. Hence 2220 is a correct answer.

However, I am correcting myself based on the lowest value found in the list of values that are provided.
The lowest value is 2207. I originally misread the prompt and was thinking about the winning race value.

Therefore, **D: 2207** is the correct answer.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, pasukaleenawa angaharu sambhawayak aethi bawa thahawuru kala ulkaapaatha waetena aakaraya minisun kee wathawak daeka thibeda?","The correct answer is **C: pahalos wathawak (lower atmosphere)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the meteoroid, before entering the Earth's atmosphere, was approximately 11,000 to 22,500 kilometers in diameter.  It then says the meteor burned up in the lower atmosphere, creating a meteor shower. This indicates the primary interaction and destruction occurred in the lower atmosphere.
"
"mema chedaye sandahan wana paridi, angaharu sambhawayak aethi bawata soyagath paashana pilibanda wu sathyaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: ewa siyallama pahe juli masaye ulkapatha warshawa atharathura soya gannaa ladee**

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the truthfulness of the statement that the meteor shower occurred in July.**  The passage explicitly states: ""mema paashaanavalin pahalovak pasugiya juuli maasayedi sidu woo ulkaa varsaave laksana penvayi.""  This translates to ""The beginning of this meteorite is marked by a meteor shower in July.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ewa 24,000k aetha** -  This refers to the approximate number of meteoroids falling on Earth, which is mentioned, but not the core of the question.
* **C: ewa rathran walata wadaa dolar 11,000k watee** - This is about the monetary value of the stones, not the timing of the meteor shower.
* **D: ewa 34k aetha** - This refers to the approximate number of meteoroids that survived the Earth's atmosphere, not the timing of the meteor shower.



Therefore, option A is the only one that directly addresses the question about the July meteor shower."
shoomakar vishraama giye kawada da?,"The correct answer is **B: ohuge hathweni shurathaavaya dinaa gaeneemen pasuwa**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** When did Schumacher retire?
* **The passage states:** ""2006 dee wishraama gath shoomaakar..."" which translates to ""2006 he retired..."" and the phrase ""hathweni shurathaavaya dinaa gaeneemen pasuwa"" means ""after his retirement day"".

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: felipe maasa ge anathuren pasuwa:** This translates to ""after Felipe Massa's father"", which isn't related to Schumacher's retirement date.
* **C: felipe masaa ge thaena gaeneemen pasuwa:** This translates to ""after Felipe Massa's accident"", which is a separate event and not Schumacher's retirement date.
* **D: 2009 tharaga samaya awasanaye dee:** This translates to ""at the end of the 2009 season"", which is when Massa took over from Schumacher, not when Schumacher retired.



"
masa thuwala laebuwe kawada da?,"The correct answer is **A: graend priks tharagawaliyak atharathura (during the Grand Prix season)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""2009 varshaye hangeriyaanu graend pricks tarangaavaliya atharathura aethivu anaturin brasiliyaanuvaage hisata thadabala thuwaala aethiviya."" This translates to ""In 2009, during the Hungarian Grand Prix season, the Brazilian driver Felipe Massa experienced a serious accident.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: formiyulaa 1 shurathaavaya dinaa gaeneemen pasuwa (after the Formula 1 season):** The text clearly links the accident to the 2009 Grand Prix season, not after the season ended.
* **C: shoomakar vish‍raama yamata pera (during Schumacher's break):** While Schumacher was taking a break, the accident happened during the Grand Prix season, not specifically *during* his break.
* **D: 2009 tharaga samayata pera (during the 2009 season):**  While technically true that the accident happened in 2009, option A is more specific and accurate because it points to the Grand Prix season, the context in which the accident occurred.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks what happens to the number of E.O.L. (presumably referring to something mentioned in the first statement) based on the first statement.
* **The first statement (P)** says that the use of E.O.L. is expected to increase the number of people in a certain area and contribute to economic growth. It also mentions that the number of users for Yahoo! and Microsoft services have increased in parallel with the number of E.O.L. users.
* **Option C** directly reflects this relationship: ""The number of users influenced by Yahoo and Microsoft has increased in parallel with the number of users influenced by E.O.L.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This is too specific. The first statement doesn't say *only* the number of E.O.L. users will increase, but also population and economic growth.
* **B:** While E.O.L. might contribute to economic growth, the first statement doesn't explicitly say that increasing the number of E.O.L. directly causes economic growth.
* **D:** This is incorrect. The first statement explicitly says the use of E.O.L. is expected to increase the number of people in a certain area.



"
nawa vidhividhaanayen pasuwa awasan viya haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: eksath janapadaye pulul antharjala sanvardhanaya (Expansion of the internet in the community)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses a new initiative aiming to expand internet access in a community (""eksath janapadaya"").  The initiative is intended to boost economic development (""saha sanvardhanaya kirimata""). The mention of Yahoo! and Microsoft's services decreasing in popularity suggests that this initiative is a response to a changing digital landscape and a need for increased connectivity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: kshanika panivida welandapola bhaavithaya (Temporary internet speed improvement):** While potentially part of the initiative, it's not the core focus. The passage emphasizes broader expansion.
* **C: thamangema wegayakin welandapola sanvardhanaya kirimata e. o. el hata nidahasa (Increase internet speed through E.O.L. elimination):**  The passage mentions E.O.L. (likely dial-up) being eliminated, but the primary goal is broader internet access, not solely speed improvements through eliminating dial-up.
* **D: yahoo saha mayikrosoft hawulkarithwaya (The decline of Yahoo and Microsoft):** This is a consequence *mentioned* in the passage, but it's not the *reason* for the initiative.  The initiative is a proactive response to the changing digital environment.



Therefore, expanding internet access within the community is the main goal and the best answer.



"

The text states: ""Me prahaaraye wagakeema sambandhava daayish (isil) satankaamiyek saeka karana bhava polisiya pawasai."" This translates to: ""The police suspect a Daesh (ISIS) attack in connection with the attack.""

The question asks how many police officers were injured. The text doesn't mention any police officers being injured. Therefore, the answer is 0.
"
mema prahaaraya sambandha saekakaru pilibandawawa waartha kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: maadhya waarthakaruwan (Media)**.

Here's why:

The question asks who reported news about the attack. The text states: ""Me prahaaraye wagakeema sambandhava daayish (isil) satankaamiyek saeka karana bhava polisiya pawasai."" which translates to ""It is believed that the attack was carried out by a Daesh (ISIS) affiliated group. The police are investigating the incident.""  The following sentence states ""Thuwaala laebu ayagen dahanava deneku polis niladhaarin bhava aandukara kaaryalaya paewaseeya."" which means ""The police and fire department were dispatched to extinguish the fire.""

The question is about *news* reporting.  Therefore, the media is the entity that would be reporting on this event. The other options are involved but not the primary source of the initial news report:

*   **A: aandukarawarayage kaaryaalaya (Police headquarters):**  The police *investigate* the attack but don't typically report it to the public.
*   **B: aandukarawarayage kaaryaalaya (Police headquarters):** Same as above.
*   **D: gaesiyantep pradeshawaseen (Gaziantep province):** Gaziantep is the location, not the source of the news.

"mema janapadaye jayagraahakaya siyalu janapadawala jayagraahakaya wanu aetha yana floridaawe thaththwaya hethuwen, mit romnita pirinamana ladde kumak da?","The correct answer is **B: ripablikan pakshaye apekshakathwaya (Republican pakshaye apekshakathwaya)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...romni wetha floridava siya niyojanayan panahama pirinaemu athara, eya ohu repablikan paksha apeksakayaa lesa idiri pelin thabaamin idiriyata gene giyeya."" This translates to ""...Romney's victory in Florida was partly due to the Republican party's expectations being lower.""

* **The question asks:** ""What was the reason for the Romney victory in the state, considering the state's historical pattern of supporting the Republican candidate?""  The passage directly links Romney's win to the lower expectations of the Republican party.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: janapadaye niyojanayan 32 ma (32 percent in the state's projections):** While 32% is mentioned, it's a *projection*, not the *reason* for the victory. The passage says expectations were *lower* than the projections.
* **C: janapadaye niyojanayan siyallama (all state projections):**  This is too broad. It's not *all* projections, but the expectations of the Republican party specifically.
* **D: chandawalin siyayata 46 (46 days):**  This refers to the time duration and is irrelevant to the reason for the victory.

"mema chedayata anuwa, moolika maethivaranachayen gingrichta laebunu chanda prathishathaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: siyayata 32**.

The text states: ""Hitapu eksath janapada paarlimentuve kataanaayaka newut gingrich siyayata 32 ka pratisatayak dinaa ganimin devana sthaanayata path viya."" This translates to ""Together with Hitapu, the Speaker of the State Parliament, Newt Gingrich, also won 32 percent of the vote.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kokas hamuwe prathiphalayen pasuwa digata ma tharaga nokale kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: gingrich**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pratiphala paeminimen pasuwa, gingrich, saentoram hata prashansaa kalada, gingrichta viruddhava ayovahi dee ayahapat prachaaraka vyaapaarayak kala romni sambandhayen daediva vivechanaya karana ladi.""

This translates to: ""After the results, Gingrich, while receiving praise from Santorum, fought a scathing controversy involving the communications vendor Romni.""

Therefore, Gingrich is the one facing controversy after the results.
"
"mema chedaya anuwa, kokas hamuwe prathiphalayak lesa wenath apekshakayeku gaena ihalin katha kale kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: gingrich**.

Here's why:

* The text states that after the results, ""Gingrich, saentoram hata prashansaa kalada, gingrichta viruddhava ayovahi dee ayahapat prachaaraka vyaapaarayak kala romni sambandhayen daediva vivechanaya karana ladi."" This translates to: ""Gingrich, although praised by the Senate, fought a serious debate because of allegations made by the campaign manager, Romni, related to Gingrich's opposition."" This directly implies that Gingrich was the one whose performance was being questioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: baechman:** While mentioned, she is described as wanting to end the campaign. She isn't the subject of the performance question.
* **C: romni:** He is only mentioned as the campaign manager who made allegations, not as someone whose performance is being questioned.
* **D: peri:** He is quoted saying something about Texas power, but he isn't the subject of the performance question.



"
2015 ta pera pradarshanaya paewathi ekama sthaanaya koheda?,"The correct answer is **C: aestronet rediyo**.

The text states: ""Pasugiya 2015 vasare, toginet visin anubaddha sthaanayak washayen aestronet rediyo sthaapana karana ladi."" This translates to ""In 2015, TogiNet, in collaboration with Aestronet Radio, established an affiliated station.""  Therefore, the demonstration in 2015 was established as Aestronet Radio.
"
mema madyasthaanaya pradarshanaya visthara karanne kumana aakaraye bhramanayak aethi lesada?,"The correct answer is **B: kalaanuroopa nowu (newly modern)**.

The text states: """"nava ha saahasika kaalanurupa novoo bhugoliya bramanayen..."""" which translates to ""...new and adventurous modern geographical concept..."". Therefore, ""kaalanuroopa nowu"" (newly modern) describes the type of journey/exploration.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aadhunika (modern):** While ""modern"" is part of the description, it's not the full and most accurate descriptor of the journey's nature.
* **C: paerani pasal (original/first class):** This refers to the type of journey, not its aesthetic.
* **D: pradesheeya (local/regional):** This describes the location of the historical site, not the journey itself.



"
devid hedli awasanaye prahaaraka kandaayame prahaarayata aadhaara wana lesa raes kale kumak da?,"The correct answer is **C: thuwakkukaruwan (weapon)**.

Here's why:

* **The Question:** ""devid hedli awasanaye prahaaraka kandaayame prahaarayata aadhaara wana lesa raes kale kumak da?"" translates to something like, ""What was the weapon used in the attack on Devid Hedli's residence?""
* **The Context:** The original text describes an attack (prahaaraya) involving weapons, including ""laskhar-e-thayiba paakistaanu bata kandaayamehi tuvakku bhatayan"" (weapons from Lashkar-e-Thayiba Pakistan).
* **""Thuwakkukaruwan""** directly translates to ""weapon"" in Sinhala. 

The other options are not as relevant:

* **Thorathuru:**  Means ""wooden plank"" or ""timber"".
* **Athbomba:** Means ""artillery shell"". While it's a weapon, the question asks for a more general term.
* **Swayankriya avi:** Means ""automatic bomb"". It's a specific type of weapon, not the general term the question likely seeks.



Therefore, **thuwakkukaruwan (weapon)** is the most accurate and appropriate answer based on the provided text and question.
"
mumbai wetha yamata prahaaraka kandaayama bhaavitha kale kumana prawaahana kramayada?,"The answer is **A: dumriya**.

The text states: ""...dumriya sthaanaya saha janapriya thaaj mahal hotalaya aetulu ilakka kihipayakata prahaara sidu kalo ya."" This translates to ""...dumriya, a local and popular place near the Taj Mahal hotel, was the target of the attack.""

Therefore, ""dumriya"" refers to the location where the attack occurred, and the question asks about the mode of transport used during the attack. The text doesn't explicitly state the mode of transport, but it identifies ""dumriya"" as the location.  The question is a bit misleading. Since we are forced to choose from the options, and ""dumriya"" is directly mentioned in connection with the attack location, it is the most logical answer based on the provided text. The context implies an attack *in* Dumriya.

The other options (guvan yaanaya, bottuwa, kaar rathaya) translate to:
* B: guvan yaanaya - Government vehicle
* C: bottuwa - Boat
* D: kaar rathaya - Car carriage/chariot

None of these are mentioned in the context of the attack.  Because the question asks for the ""prahaaraka kandaayama bhaavitha kale kumana prawaahana kramayada?"" (the mode of transport used during the attack?), and the provided text connects ""dumriya"" to the Taj Mahal attack, it's the only plausible answer among the options, *even though the text doesn't directly say what vehicle was used*.
"
mema chedaye sandahan paridi nadaal saha ronikge brisben viwurtha tharagaye prathiphalaya niwaeradiwa pilibimbu karanne kumana prakaashayada?,"The correct answer is **C: nadaal ronik paraajaya kaleya** (Nadal lost to Ronik).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Ohu naevatat maethaka dee brisben vivurta tarangavaliye dee raeyonik hata paraajaya viya"" which translates to ""He (Nadal) lost to Ronik in the Brisbane tournament.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ronik nadaalwa paraajaya kaleya** (Ronik lost to Nadal) - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **B: ronikta shuddha lakunu 88%k thibuni** (Ronik's percentage of clean shots was 88%) - This is a true statement from the text, but it doesn't answer the question of *who* Nadal lost *to*.
* **D: ronik lakunu 76k laba gaththeya** (Ronik received 76k points) - This is also a true statement from the text, but doesn't answer the question of *who* Nadal lost *to*.

The question asks to identify the result regarding Nadal and Ronik's Brisbane tournament performance.  Nadal lost to Ronik is the key piece of information.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, palamu pirinaemeemen pasuwa nadaal saha ronikge tharagaye sthaawaraya kumak weeda?","The correct answer is **A: ronikta shuddha lakunu 88%k thibuni**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Palamu pirinaemeeme dee lakunu 76k labaa ganimin nadal tharagaye 88%ka suddha lakunu labaa gatte ya.""  This directly translates to ""In the first set, Nadal scored 76k points and achieved a 88% accuracy rate.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: nadaal lakunu 76k laba gaththeya:** While true, it doesn't reflect the *overall ranking* of Nadal's accuracy.
* **C: lakunu thathwaya 7-2 viya:** This refers to the score of the match, not Nadal's accuracy percentage.
* **D: ronik nadaalwa paraajaya kaleya:**  The text says Nadal lost to Rohan, but it doesn't state that Rohan won the match overall. It only mentions Nadal lost the set.



"
nawa nekad niwus vikaashana thunakata aethulath kara nomaethi bhaasha waedasatahana kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: spaangnga**.

Here's why:

The question asks which language is used for the ""goleeya sanvidhaanaya spaangna"" (universal constitution Spanish) in the context of the provided text. The text explicitly states that Spanish is one of the languages used for the ""niyamithaya"" (regulation/rules) related to the translation of various media (TV, web, mobile).

Therefore, the answer is Spanish.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nawa nekad niwus vikaashanaya laba gatha nohaeki wanne koheda?","The correct answer is **A: jangama upaanga (portable device)**.

Here's why:

The question asks where the benefits of the new development (which is about overcoming language barriers in communication) can be achieved. The text explicitly states the new development aims to provide this capability through:

* **Portable devices (jangama upangavalata)**
* TV (rupavaahiniyata)
* Web (web adaviyata)

Since ""jangama upangavalata"" directly translates to portable devices, it's the most appropriate answer. The other options are not mentioned in the text as benefits of this development.
"
tharagakaruwan kee denek gayant slalom tharagaya awasan nokale da?,"The answer is **A: 36**.

The question asks how many athletes finished the giant slalom race. The text states: ""Theragakaruwan 116 denagen 36 ta ema pratipalayama ath viya"" which translates to ""116 athletes started, 36 finished."" Therefore, 36 athletes did not finish the giant slalom race.
"

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the results of the competition.**
* **Option A directly states the result: Hangeriy (the athlete) finished ahead of Kapenaado (the other athlete) in the first category.**  The text mentions Hangeriy's finishing times in various categories and Kapenaado's times, confirming this result.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text *does* mention Kapenaado's 45-minute giant slalom time. This option says Kapenaado *didn't* finish the giant slalom.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The text confirms that the giant slalom category was completed by athletes who participated in giant slalom.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The text confirms Kapenaado completed the slalom category.



Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately reflects a key result from the competition described in the text.

Here's why:

The question asks what the delay in the resumption of national team football matches was due to. The passage states:

*  Matches were suspended due to COVID-19 related issues.
*  After the suspension, players were tested for COVID-19.

Therefore, the delay was due to the results of the COVID-19 tests.  Players testing positive for COVID-19 prevented the matches from resuming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: paesipandu samaya** (match time) - While match time was affected, the *reason* for the delay wasn't just the time itself.
* **B: yuta jaes kandaayame kreedakayek** (a specific player) - The passage doesn't mention a specific player causing the delay. The delay was related to the general COVID-19 testing of players.
* **D: yuta jaes paesipandu kandaayama** (a specific team) - The passage doesn't specify any particular team. The delay affected national team football generally.

"mema chedayata anuwa, vairasaya sambandhayen en. bee. e. hi kanassallata hethu wuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: yuta jaes kreedakayakuta vairasaya waelandee aethi bawa thahawuru weema** (The team's coach tested positive for COVID-19).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nba hi tiranayen pasuwa, utaah jaes waadakayeku kovid-19 vairasaya waeladhee aethi bavata pariksanavalin thahavuru viya."" (After that, the team's coach tested positive for COVID-19.)
* **The question asks:** ""mema chedayata anuwa, vairasaya sambandhayen en. bee. e. hi kanassallata hethu wuye kumakda?"" (What is the reason for the EBE (close contacts) being quarantined due to the virus?)
* **The most logical reason** for quarantining close contacts is that their coach, a key figure in the team, tested positive. This puts them at higher risk of infection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: en. bee. e. saamaajikayekuta vairasaya waelandee aethi bawa thahawuru weema** (The EBE quarantined because someone in the community tested positive for the virus):  While community spread is a concern, the passage specifically mentions the *team's coach* testing positive.
* **B: yuta jaes tharagaye kreedakayan kihipa denekuta vairasaya waelandee aethi bawa thahawuru weema** (The EBE quarantined because someone in the team's support staff tested positive): The passage doesn't mention anyone in the *support staff* testing positive; it specifically refers to the *coach*.
* **C: yuta jaes kandaayame kreedakayek vairasaya waelandee aethi bawa thahawuru weemen pasu durwala lesa kreedaa kirima** (The EBE quarantined because a player in the team's squad tested positive and then tried to play weakly): This option is confusing and doesn't fit the context of the passage.  It also doesn't align with standard quarantine protocols.



Therefore, option **D** is the most accurate and directly supported by the provided information."
aetlanta thraeshars samaga paewathi tharagayedee voshingtan kaepital wenuwen jayagraahee golaya waartha kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: nikalas baekstom**.

The text states: ""aadhunika kridaka nikalas baekstroam ella kala golayata daekvu sahaya, edina raathriyedi ovechkinge prathama sahaya vuyeya."" which translates to ""modern hockey player Niklas Backstrom assisted in every goal, and tonight he assisted Alex Ovechkin's first goal.""  It also says he assisted in the winning goal for the Atlanta Thrashers against the Washington Capitals.

Therefore, Niklas Backstrom is the correct answer.
"
kaepitals saha thraeshars athara paewathi tharagayedee mema waarayedee thama 60 waeni golaya warthaa kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: aeleks owechkin**.

The text states: ""Ohu labaagat devana golaya vuye, 1995-96 kaalaya thula gola 60 k ho waedi gananak labaagat palamuvaenna lesa, jaeromeer jagar saha maariyo lemiks da ema sandhisthaanayata pivisena vita, ohu labaagat 60 wani golayai.""

This translates to: ""He scored the winning goal, slightly surpassing the 60-goal mark in the 1995-96 season, along with Jaromir Jagr and Mario Lemieux joining that dynasty, he achieved 60 goals.""

The sentence explicitly says Alex Ovechkin achieved 60 goals in the 1995-96 season. While Jagr and Lemieux are mentioned as teammates, the question asks who scored the 60th goal *in that specific season* for the Capitals and Thrashers (even though they didn't play against each other for that goal). The text directly links Ovechkin to the 60 goal milestone.



"
nodarn rok baenkuwata rajaye sahaya awashya wuye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: baenkuwa jaathikakaranaya kala pasu** (After the bank engaged in ethnic discrimination).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Baenkuva jaatikakarana kirimata pera shrimath richard braensange varjin grup baenkuvata lansuvak thabaa eya pratiksepa wee tibini."" (The bank was required to provide support after the bank engaged in ethnic discrimination).

While the other options are related to the situation, the direct trigger for the need for government assistance was the ethnic discrimination. The government assistance was a *consequence* of that discriminatory behavior.

"mema chedayata anuwa, varjin samoohaya saha nodarn rok baenkuwa athara ganudenuwa niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: varjin samoohaya baenkuwa jaathikakaranaya kirimen pasuwa eya mila dee gaththeya**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the connection between the Varjin group and the Northern Rock bank, based on the provided text?
* **The text states:** The Varjin group (specifically Richard Braensange's group) attempted to seize control of the Northern Rock bank due to the 2007 budget crisis.  Later, the Northern Rock bank was labeled an ""unsuitable bank"" due to its actions regarding the Varjin group.
* **Option B directly addresses this:** It highlights the link between the Varjin group's actions (attempting a takeover) and the subsequent negative consequences for the Northern Rock bank (being labeled ""unsuitable"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While the text mentions the Varjin group and Northern Rock are related, it doesn't simply state they are ""related"" in a general way.  Option B provides a more specific and accurate connection.
* **C:**  The text mentions budget crisis and initial assistance to the Varjin group's bank, but it does not specifically state they were able to receive assistance *because* of the budget crisis.  
* **D:** The text describes a situation where the Varjin group tried to seize control, and the bank reacted negatively. It doesn't explicitly state the bank tried to legally challenge or sued the group.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate and complete answer based on the information provided in the text."
"mema chedaye sandahan paridi, kiyoto deshagunika givisuma athsan kirimen balapaemata lak wanne kumana ratatada?","The correct answer is **A: eksath janapadaya**.

The passage states: ""...Kiyoto desagunika givisuma athsan kirimata radd mahatha gath tiranaya eksath janapadaya hudakala wee daen givisuma anumatha nokarana ekama sanvardhitha rata vanu aetha."" This translates to ""...The Kyoto Protocol, a major treaty to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, was adopted by the United Nations...""

Therefore, the passage directly states that the United Nations (eksath janapadaya) adopted the Kyoto Protocol.
"
kiyoto anumatha kirimen kumak sandaha haaniyak siduwanu aethaeyi kalin paewathi ostreliyanu rajaya vishwaasa kaleda?,"The correct answer is **B: rate aarthikaya (the country's economy)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Kyoto Protocol, particularly the Australian conservative government's stance, caused ""aarthikayata haani siduviya haeki yaeyi"" which translates to ""a potential damage to the economy"". 
* The question asks what damage the Kyoto Protocol caused according to the Australian government's belief. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eksath janapadaya (the state/region)** - While the passage mentions the region, the main damage attributed to Kyoto in this context is economic.
* **C: gal aguru apanayana (coal mining)** - The passage mentions coal mining as a sector potentially affected by Kyoto, but doesn't say it *caused* the damage. It's a consequence mentioned.
* **D: rate vimochana ilakka (country's liberation goal)** - This is not mentioned as a consequence of Kyoto's approval.

The passage states: ""Npws saha oustreliyave kreeda vedikkaru sangamaya (nsw) samaga ekva, kreeda vedikkaru sangamaye dadayam vaedasatahanata sudusukam lath svechcha sevakayin bandavaaganna ladi.""  This translates to: ""Along with NSW and Australian sports trainers' association (NSW), they are working to access the sports trainers' association's database for the voluntary staff.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions the sports trainers' association's database.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Paripuraka palibodha mardana parikshanaya adhikshanaya kota ehi phaladaayithaava agayanu laebu baevin, ehi vedikkaruvan renjarvaru visin sameepawa adhikshanaya kala yuthuva tibuni.""  This translates to: ""Since the supplementary cognitive assessment didn't yield satisfactory results, the doctors were able to do a closer examination."" This implies the initial assessment was incomplete.

* **Option A directly reflects this:**  It says they didn't receive a full explanation during the medical examination.  The lack of a complete explanation is a likely reason why the initial assessment wasn't sufficient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vedikkaruvanta puhunu upades laebuni** (doctors didn't get guidance).  The passage states they *did* get guidance from NSW Parks and Wildlife.
* **C: vedikkaruvan renjarvarun visin adheekshanaya karana ladee** (doctors are forced to do a closer examination). The passage implies they *were able* to do a closer examination because the initial assessment was inadequate.
* **D: vedikkaruvan siwdeneku thoraa gannaa ladee** (doctors are forced to take action). The passage doesn't mention any forced action.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, mema bedee yama soya gaththe kohenda?","The correct answer is **A: rift nimnaye**.

Here's why:

The provided text discusses fossils and the age of the Earth. It mentions that ""mema fosilaya matha padanamwa"" which translates to ""this fossil is a testament to the age of the Earth"". It also mentions ""rift nimnaye"" (rift valley) in the context of where such fossils are found.

The question asks ""mema chedayata anuwa, mema bedee yama soya gaththe kohenda?"" which translates to ""Where are these fossils typically found?"".

The text explicitly links the fossils to rift valleys. Therefore, the most logical answer is the rift valley.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: fosilayak matha** (at the fossil itself): While the fossils *are* the evidence, the question asks *where* they are typically found, not what they are.
*   **C: anukamaya saakshi wala** (in the testimonies/witnesses): This refers to the witness evidence, which isn't the location of the fossils.
*   **D: ithiyopiyawe** (in Ethiopia):  The text mentions Ethiopia as a location where environmental services and studies are conducted. While fossils *are* found in Ethiopia, the text doesn't specifically state that's *where* these particular fossils are found, but rather that Ethiopia has a relevant ecosystem. The rift valley is a more direct answer.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What kind of evidence is this referring to?"" (roughly translated)
* **The provided text describes:**  ""fossil remains, evidence of a bygone era, a witness to a long-ago time, the proof of a changing world.""  This clearly points to the concept of **paleontological evidence** or **fossil evidence**.
* **Option C, ""anukamaya saakshi vishleshanaya,""** translates to ""anuk Amaya saakshi vishleshanaya"", which means **""anuk Amaya saakshi vishleshanaya (anuk Amaya saakshi vishleshanaya)""** which is the scientific method of analyzing evidence.  It's the process by which scientists interpret fossils to understand the past.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fosila soyaa gaeneema (fossil soyaa gaeneema):** This translates to ""fossil searching/excavation"". While related, it's not the evidence *itself*.
* **B: bedee yaema (bedee yaema):** This translates to ""animal bones"" or ""bones of animals"". It's too specific; the text refers to broader evidence, not just bones.
* **D: rift nimnaye paryeshana (rift nimnaye paryeshana):** This translates to ""environmental research in the rift valley"". The text mentions the rift valley *as a location* where fossils are found, but it's not the evidence itself.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C: anukamaya saakshi vishleshanaya**."

Here's why:

* The passage states the new Nintendo Revolution console uses a parental sensor to accurately track the player's movements and translate them into in-game actions. 
* Option A directly reflects this functionality.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aewaaye pihiteema thrimana gatha kirima** (It's a hidden three-dimensional tracking). While the passage mentions 3D tracking, it doesn't say it's hidden.
* **C: owunge rupavaahiniya asala sanwaedaka thaebeema** (Its original camera is used as a sensor). The passage specifically mentions a *parental sensor* being used, not the built-in camera.
* **D: paalakayaa awakaashaya thula chalanaya kirima** (The parent makes movements). This is incorrect because the passage is about *the player's* movements being tracked.



"
rupavahini durasthayak lesa penena paridi nirmanaya kara aeththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: nintendo revolushan paalakaya (Nintendo Revolution controller)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rupavaahini durastha paalakayaka aaakaraye mema paalakaya..."" which translates to ""The controller has a built-in camera..."" This directly indicates the Nintendo Revolution controller has a built-in camera.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: paalakayaagae sanwedaka deka (the controller's sensor)** - While the controller has a sensor, the text highlights the camera as a new feature.
* **C: pradhaana idiripath kireema (main aiming beam)** - This refers to the aiming mechanism, not the camera.
* **D: nintendo revolushan konsolaya (Nintendo Revolution console)** - The console itself isn't the controller with the camera.

Therefore, the Nintendo Revolution controller is the part with the built-in camera.

Here's why:

The question asks what is the *newest* information in the news. The passage states:

* **Initial information:** The government vehicle was regularly traveling.
* **Later information:** A bomb was planted on the government vehicle, and it detonated in Kandahar, Afghanistan.
* **Further information:** The government vehicle was sent to Afghanistan with casualties.

Therefore, the most recent news is the planting of the bomb. Options B, C, and D describe events that happened *after* the bomb was planted.

* **The passage states:** ""Pera vaartaavalin paewasune uroomkivala hadisi godabaema pratiksepa woo nisa guvan yaanaya aefghanisthaanaya wetha haeravu bavayi.""  This translates to ""In the wave of news, the government's actions to respond to the bombing of the government vehicle in Afghanistan were reported.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: guvan yaanaya paehaeragena aetha (The government vehicle left):** This is just a fact about the vehicle, not the news report's focus.
* **C: guvan yaanaya naewatha aefghanisthaanayata harawaa yawana ladi (The government vehicle went to Afghanistan to fight):**  While the government vehicle went to Afghanistan, the news wasn't primarily about the vehicle going there; it was about the *response* to the bombing.
* **D: guvan yaananayata bomba tharjanayak aethi viya (The government vehicle was bombed):** This describes the event that *led* to the news report, but the news report itself was about the *response*.



Therefore, option B accurately reflects what the news report was centered on: the government's response to the bombing of the vehicle.

The text states: ""Daniyas paewasuwe, """"daan api kisivak karamin nositimu. mama ohuge sameepathama sahakaruvaata durakathanayen kathaa kara, email kara aethi aamanthranayata ithaa suhada pilithuru laebby aetha. daenata eya nisaekavama pramaanavatya"""" yanuveni.""  This translates to: ""Daniyas said, """"We didn't receive any invitations. I tried to talk to his collaborators, and I also responded favorably to email invitations, but he was very formal.""""  This highlights that he didn't accept invitations from collaborators and maintained a formal distance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: saahithyaya pilibanda nobel thyaaga jayagraahakayaa (The Nobel Prize laureate in literature)** While the text is about the Nobel Prize winner, the question asks *what he didn't do* regarding collaborators.
* **C: 2016 sahithyaya pilibanda nobel thyaagayata nirdesha wu nam (Was instructed to renounce the 2016 Nobel Prize in literature)** The text doesn't say he was instructed to renounce the prize. He simply maintained a formal distance.
* **D: bob dilan samaga sambandha weemata darana uthsahaya kamituva visin nawathwanu aetha (He was enthusiastic about collaborating with Bob Dylan)**  The text says he tried to collaborate with Dylan's collaborators, but the overall tone is of formality and distance, not enthusiasm for collaboration.



"
sambandha kara gaeneemata nohaeki wuye kaawada?,"The correct answer is **A: bob dilange sameepathama sahakaru**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Daniyas paewasuwe, """"daan api kisivak karamin nositimu. mama ohuge sameepathama sahakaruvaata durakathanayen kathaa kara, email kara aethi aamanthranayata ithaa suhada pilithuru laebby aetha. daenata eya nisaekavama pramaanavatya"""" yanuveni."" 

This translates to: ""Daniyas said, ""We didn't do anything. I used to talk to him by phone or email, and when he invited me, I happily replied. Then he would treat me with great respect.""""

Therefore, the person who was a close collaborator of Bob Dylan is the one who didn't contribute to the Nobel Prize nomination. The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Saraa Daeniyas:**  While mentioned, he is not directly linked to not contributing.
* **C: Sweedana Aayathanaya:** The Swedish Academy is the body that *awards* the Nobel Prize, not someone who would *not* be involved in the nomination process.
* **D: Bob Dylan:** Bob Dylan is the laureate, so he would naturally be involved in the nomination.



"
pradhaana piyavarak lesa poronduwa pilibanda adahas daekwuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: gordan jondrow**.

Here's why:

The question asks who made the primary statement about the ""lesa poronduwa"" (slightly disrespectful behavior) related to Korea. The text states: ""Bushge maadhya pracaraka gordan jondrow, koreawe poronduva sambandhava pawasuwe eya """"koreanu ardhadvipaya thula sanatha kala haeki lesa nyashtika aviharanaya kireema sandaha gath pradhaana piyavarak"""" bavayi.""

Translation: ""George W. Bush's spokesperson, Gordon Johndew, made the primary statement regarding the Korean disrespect.""

Therefore, **gordan jondrow** is the person who made the primary statement.
"
slaniya vividha ratawal sandahaa muddara keeyak nishpaadanaya kalaada?,"The correct answer is **B: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Ohu svidanaya sandaha saha thavat ratawal 28k sandaha muddara 1,000kata vadaa nirmaanaya kale..."" which translates to ""He built 1,000 stamps about the subject of stamps and also about 28 countries...""

The other options are less likely:

* **A: dvitheeyika bahalum kotasa dhaarithaawaya piree thibeema (Secondary failure being present):** While a secondary failure *could* contribute, the text directly points to a system failure as the cause.
* **B: gini vidhaana paddhathiyae saamaan‍ya pareekshanayak (A routine test of this kind):**  The text implies this wasn't a routine test; it was a failure during operation.
* **D: fort greely pompaagaarawala ginnak (Damage from the Fort Greely pump):** The text doesn't mention the Fort Greely pump being the cause.

Therefore, **thaapa prasaaranaya (system failure)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
mudahaereem kapaata vivurtha wuye aeyi?,"The correct answer is **A: taenki abyantharaye thaapa prasaaranayakviya (the tank's internal structure suffered radiation damage)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Taenkivalata pahatin paewathi thavat dvitiyika bahalum kotasaka baerala 104,500ka dharithaven yuthu taenki dharithawaye mattamata e wana vitat purava nothibini.

This indicates radiation damage to the internal tank structure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: paddhathi pareekshanayakin pasuwa viduliya binda waeteemak siduviya (electricity malfunctioned after system testing):** The passage mentions electricity failure, but it doesn't state that it happened *after* system testing, nor does it explain *why* it happened. The radiation damage to the tank is the primary explanation provided.
*   **C: taenki sampoorna dharithavayen yuktha viya (the tank is completely intact):**  The passage clearly indicates the tank is *not* intact, as there is radiation damage.
*   **D: dvitiyika bahalum kotasaka baerala 104,500ka dharithaven yuthu taenki dharithawaye mattamata e wana vitat purava nothibini (104,500kg of radiation penetrated the tank and damaged the tank):** This statement is not present in the passage."
"daenata, nawawana kottaashaye jala mattama kotharam ihalata pawatheeda?","The correct answer is **C: ina dakva ihalata**.

Here's why:

The question asks *why* the new reservoir (nawawana kottaashaye) only has water in the bottom (ina dakva ihalata). The passage states: ""Vella mathin kotase adi 100k palalata jalaya baesa yayi."" which translates to ""The water in the sugar reservoir was used up by 100k people.""

This implies that the water level is low because the water in the old reservoir was depleted. Therefore, the new reservoir only has water at the bottom because it hasn't been filled to capacity yet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adi 20** - ""adi 20"" likely refers to 20 years, which is irrelevant to the question.
*   **B: angal 6** - ""angal 6"" refers to 6 years, which is also irrelevant.
*   **D: adi 100k** - ""adi 100k"" refers to 100,000 people, representing the number of people who used the water from the old reservoir. It doesn't explain why the new reservoir has limited water.



"
kaethrina suli kunatuva atharathura nawawana kottaasha kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: ina dakva ihalata wu jalaya wellata udin uthuraa giyeya.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""How much water was used to build the new dam?"" (kaethrina suli kunatuva atharathura nawawana kottaasha kumakda?)
* **The text states:** ""Vella mathin kotase adi 100k palalata jalaya baesa yayi."" which translates to ""The water used to build the dam was 100k palalata.""
* **Option B directly reflects this information.** It says ""the water from the river was used to fill the dam.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ganvatura jala mattama adi 100 k palalata viya** (""Only river water was used to fill it 100k palalata"") - While the source is the river, it doesn't directly state *how much* was used, just that it was the river water. Option B gives the specific amount.
* **C: ganwathura jala mattama adi 20 k usata viya** (""Only river water was used to fill it 20k palalata"") - This is incorrect because the text states 100k palalata.
* **D: angal 6 ka varshaapathanaya paludu wee aethi wella binda daemeeya** (""It is the water that rained for 6 years that was used to build the dam"") - This is incorrect. The text refers to river water, not rainwater.

haemiltan visin thahavuru nokarana ladde pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: wenath rogiyekuta vairasaya aasadanaya viya haeki sambhaavithawa (The possibility that another patient may have been exposed to the virus).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ibolaa vairasaya vaarthaa wee aethi naijiriyaavata, rogiya gos atha."" (News of the Ebola virus spread to Nigeria, and a patient appeared.) This implies a potential outbreak and the need to understand how the virus might have spread.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Aasaadanaya paalanaya kireema sandaha rogiya an ayagen ven kireema aetuluva an ayata viya haeki aaaadanayan vaelaekvima aadee niti samudhaayan anugamanaya kara aetha."" (Regarding adherence to treatment, the patient and others who came into contact with him were asked to follow a strict protocol and adhere to community guidelines.) This indicates a focus on preventing further spread.

Option B directly addresses the concern of potential secondary infections and the need to investigate how others might have been exposed, which is a crucial aspect of controlling a viral outbreak.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: rogiya gaman kala thaena (The patient's travel history):** While travel history is important, the passage focuses more on the *spread* of the virus, not just where the patient had been.
* **C: nisi neethi samudayan anugamanaya kara thibeda yanna (The need to follow strict community guidelines):**  The passage mentions following guidelines, but it doesn't state that *following* these guidelines is the key to understanding how the virus spread initially.
* **D: rogiyage wathman thathwaya (The patient's psychological state):**  The patient's psychological state is irrelevant to the scientific investigation of the virus's transmission.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical and directly supported answer based on the provided text."
vid‍yaagnayanta soya gaeneemata awashya wu de kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: dhoomakethu pruthuwiya samaga ghattanaya wuye kawadada (Is it true that comet collided with Earth?)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pruthuwiya wetha jalaya saha e samagama jivayata upakaaree wana protina nipadawiya haeki kaabanika drawya laebunu prabhavaya dhumaketu vannata ida atha."" (The impact of a comet, which has carbonaceous material containing organic proteins and beneficial substances for water and life, caused this.)

* **The question asks:** ""vid‍yaagnayanta soya gaeneemata awashya wu de kumakda?"" (What is necessary to know to understand this?)

* **The passage implies the core issue:** The passage is describing an impact event. Therefore, understanding *if* a comet actually collided with Earth is the most fundamental piece of information needed to understand the rest of the statement.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant:

* **B: proteena saedenne keseda (What kind of proteins were deposited?)**  While important, the *fact* of the impact is a prerequisite for understanding what proteins were deposited.
* **C: kaabanika d‍ravya yanu kumakda (What is carbonaceous material?)**  Again, understanding the material is secondary to understanding *how* it was deposited.
* **D: pruthuwiya saedune keseda (What was deposited on Earth?)** Similar to B and C, this is a consequence of the impact, not a necessary condition for understanding the initial event.

Therefore, knowing if the comet *actually collided* is the most essential starting point.

"mema chedayata anuwa, wasaa daemeeme karyaye dee pradesheeya polisiya itu kala kaaryabharaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: owun riyaduran wenath maarga walata yomu kalaha** (They can patrol the roads in the area).

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The text states that the FBI is requesting assistance from the police to manage traffic flow due to an incident involving the transportation of hazardous materials. They need to divert trucks to alternative routes.
* **Why C is correct:** The question asks what the local police can do to assist. Patrolling roads in the area is a standard police function that would directly help manage traffic flow and enforce the diverted routes.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: owun ef. bee. ayi. wethin wasaa damana lesa illaa sitiyaha (They can operate within areas without law enforcement presence):** This is incorrect because the FBI is *requesting* assistance, implying the police *do* have a presence.
    * **B: owun wasaa daemeemata theeranaya kalaha (They can investigate the incident):** While investigation might happen later, the immediate need is traffic management.
    * **D: owun vikalpa maargaye rathawaahana pramadayan waartha kalaha (They can investigate traffic accidents on the alternative route):** This is a possibility, but not the *primary* or most immediate assistance needed.  The focus is on *diverting* traffic, not necessarily investigating accidents.



"
wasaa daemeemedee uman maarga pivisumata sidu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: ewa vikalpa maarga lesa bhaavitha karana ladee** (It should slightly affect the alternative route).

Here's why:

The passage states that the alternative route (beltway) is not suitable for heavy vehicle traffic.  The problem is that a heavy vehicle transport truck needs to be moved, so a *slight* impact on the alternative route is necessary to allow it to proceed.  The goal isn't to completely block the route (C) or to create a barrier (D), but to make it passable with a slight adjustment. Option A is too vague.

Here's why:

The passage states that the shadow artist's unusual vehicle attracted attention from the police.  The police observed the artist driving erratically on a major highway in California.  The passage also mentions that the police are investigating the artist for a speeding violation.  Therefore, the police are likely monitoring the artist's movements and vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: chayaroopa shilpiya thama waahanaya sepulwedaa boliward asala nawatha thaebeeya:** While the artist's vehicle is seen on Sepulveda Boulevard, the passage doesn't say it's a *new* vehicle.
* **C: chayaroopa shilpiya polis naewatheeme pinthura gaththeya:** The passage states the police *observed* the artist driving, not that they intercepted or stopped him.
* **D: chayaroopa shilpiyata bibarge pinthurayak laba gaeneemata haeki viya:** The passage doesn't mention the artist needing a permit. It focuses on the police's response to his erratic driving.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""prakaashayak nikuth karamin bibar kiyaa sitiye """"mema khedajanaka anathura siduvana avasthaave maa nositiyath, rijuwa sambandha weemak nowoowath, mage sithuvili saha yaagnaa vindithayage pavula samaga ya.""""

* This translates to: ""...he said, 'I cannot tolerate the miserable state of orphans, I will not connect with anyone, I will go with the love of my heart and the sacrifice of my soul.' The energetic and reckless driving of the shadow artist, Sepulveda Boulevard, and many other places, **became a driving enthusiasm for shadow art**...""
* The text explicitly links the energetic and reckless driving (""paara tharanaya kirimata"") to the enthusiasm for shadow art (""chaayarupa gaenimata uthsaaha kala"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sepulwedaa boliward idiriye waahanaya naewathweema (Driving a vehicle on Sepulveda Boulevard):** While Sepulveda Boulevard is mentioned, it's the *style* of driving, not just the location, that's the driving force.
* **B: polis naewatheemaka chayaroopa gaeneema (Police photographing shadow art):** The police photographing it is a *result* of the driving, not the *cause* of the artistic enthusiasm.
* **D: polis niladhaariyekuta thaman chayaroopa gaeneema digatama karagena yamata ida dena lesa eththu gaenweema (Police officers trying to find the shadow art by following the driving):** This describes the police's *actions*, not the root cause of the artist's driving and subsequent shadow art.



Therefore, the energetic and reckless driving (""paara tharanaya kirimata"") is the primary factor fueling the artist's passion for shadow art."
vairasaya aasadanaya weemen pasu janaadhipathiwarayage thathwaya niwaeradiwa visthara nokarana prakaashaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: ohu sthaawara thathwayaka sitee (He has a plant-like essence)**.

Here's why:

The passage states:  ""Janaadhipathivarayaage thathwaya sthavara vuva da..."" which translates to ""The essence of the ruler is plant-like...""

The question asks what illuminates the ruler's essence when Vairasaya is consumed. The answer is that the ruler *already* possesses this plant-like essence. The consumption of Vairasaya doesn't *create* it; it reveals or illuminates what's already there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuta saneepa naetha (He doesn't have a close one):**  This isn't mentioned in the passage and is irrelevant.
* **B: ohuta ugure amaruwak aetha (He has a cow's essence):** This is also not mentioned and is irrelevant.
* **D: ohuta una rogaya aetha (He has a disease):** While the passage mentions a disease, it's not the reason for the illumination. The illumination comes from revealing the existing plant-like essence.



Therefore, the illumination is a revealing of the ruler's inherent, plant-like essence.

Here's why:

The passage states:  ""una saha ugurae amaaruva haerunu vita, viduli sandesha magin magae kaaryaya karagena yaamata mama manaa soukya thathwayen pasuwemi.""  This translates to: ""Even though he was very angry and annoyed, I will always work with electricity messages with a good mental attitude.""

This indicates that the king (Janaadhipati Rodrigo) is handling a difficult situation (the angry/annoyed state) with a positive and good mental attitude, specifically while working with the electricity messages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohuta unak naetha (He didn't have that)** - The passage doesn't say he *didn't* have something; it describes his actions.
* **B: ohu sathi kihipayak niwase raendee sitinu aetha (He was living in a simple dwelling)** - While mentioned, the passage doesn't directly relate his dwelling to his mental attitude.
* **D: ohuta daruni vairas thathwayak aetha (He had a great asceticism)** - The passage doesn't mention asceticism. It talks about mental attitude and working with messages.



Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information presented in the passage about the king's mental attitude and actions.

"mema chedayata anuwa, gonu niwarthana suli kunaatuva digata ma durwala wanu aethaeyi apekshaa karanne kawadada?","The correct answer is **C: ehi uchchathama awasthaawata langaa weemata pera (Getting closer to the highest altitude)**.

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The question asks how to reduce the time taken to travel 240 km (with a maximum speed of 149 km/h) while considering a decrease in speed based on altitude.
* **The key information:** The text states that the speed decreases significantly with increasing altitude. Specifically, the speed is 83 km/h less at an altitude of 83 km compared to sea level.
* **The logic:**  To reduce travel time, we want to maximize the speed. Since speed decreases with altitude, we want to stay as close to sea level (lowest altitude) as possible.  Therefore, getting closer to the highest altitude (the opposite of what we want) *increases* travel time.

Let's analyze why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maaladiwayinata langaa weemata pera (Getting closer to the Maldives):**  The distance to the Maldives isn't directly related to the speed reduction based on altitude.
* **B: sulan wegaya paeyata kilomeetara 83 dakwa pahatha waetunu vita (Traveling at a speed of 83 km/h for a certain distance):** This option doesn't address the altitude-dependent speed decrease.
* **D: sulan wegaya paeyata saethapum 149 dakwa langaa weemata pera (Getting closer to a speed of 149 km/h):** The maximum speed is already stated. The issue isn't about reaching the maximum speed; it's about the speed being *less* at higher altitudes.



Therefore, **C** is the only logical answer based on the given information."

This translates to ""The highest point above sea level is 83 meters higher than the sea level.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: paeyata kilomeetar 83** (which means 83 meters).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: paeyata kilomeetar 149** - This is the total distance traveled by the boat.
*   **B: paeyata saethapum 240** - This is also the total distance traveled by the boat.
*   **C: paeyata saethapum 149** - Same as option B.

kaereniya breevis wala lakshanayak lesa nosaelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: eyata minisunge snaayu akreeya kala haekiya (it didn't have the ability to paralyze humans)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the *eel* (aelgi) secretes a neurotoxin that paralyzes humans. The passage then explains that the *electric eel* (mini-sungae mathsyayange) has evolved a powerful electric organ to stun prey and defend itself.  The question asks what characteristic the *electric eel* *lacked* that prevented it from being affected by the eel's neurotoxin.

Therefore, the electric eel didn't have the property of paralyzing humans with neurotoxins.  Options A, C, and D are incorrect because the passage doesn't state those things, and paralysis is the key to understanding the question.

"
kaereniya breevis hata kala nohaekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: snaayu visha weemak nipadaweema (Nerve poisoning)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""minisungae maenma mathsyayange snaayu akriya karana neyurotoxinayak nipadawai. Jalayae aethi adhika visha saandranayan haethuven boho vita mathsyayin miya yay."" This translates to: ""The small fish in the sea is paralyzed by a neurotoxin that paralyzes its nerves. Due to the high concentration of poison in the water, many fish die.""

* **The question asks:** ""kaereniya breevis hata kala nohaekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda? (What is the main reason for the death of the small fish?)""

* **Therefore, the answer is the nerve poisoning caused by the neurotoxin.**  The other options are related but not the *main* reason the fish died, according to the passage.

"mema chedayata anuwa, felisiya suli kunaatuva hethuwen sidu nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: gigurum sahitha warshapathanaya**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Samahara vaesi samaga gigurum kunaatu saha nirantjara akunu aethi viya."" This translates to ""It is like a warship with a captain, moving continuously.""  The phrase ""gigurum kunaatu"" directly refers to having a captain (or leader) on board. The text then describes the ""prayojanavath warshapathanaya"" (necessary warship) as being vital. Therefore, the reason for the Felisiya's continuous movement (suli kunaatuva) is because it's a ""gigurum sahitha warshapathanaya"" - a warship *with a captain*.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: prayojanawath warshapathanaya** (necessary warship): While necessary, it doesn't explain *why* the Felisiya is continuously moving.
*   **C: niranthara akunu** (continuous movement): This is a *result* of being a ""gigurum sahitha warshapathanaya,"" not the *reason* for it.
*   **D: ganwathurin weedi yataweema** (being driven by the desire for gain): The text doesn't suggest the Felisiya is motivated by greed. The focus is on its necessity and having a leader.



"
felisiya suli kunaatuva pilibanda waeradi prakaashaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: ehi prathiphalayak wu warshapathanaya owahu hata prayojanawath viya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ovaahu waetha aeda haelunu angal 6.34 k dakvaa wana varshaapathanaya, """"prayojanavath"""" yaeyi visthara kaeruni."" This translates to ""...the resulting annual rainfall, with a range of 6.34 kilometers, is considered ""useful"" in terms of extent.""

Option A directly reflects this statement, indicating that the annual rainfall is considered useful in the context of the mentioned range. The other options are not directly supported by the provided text.

* The question asks what Pikae Junior achieved in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
* The text states: ""Pikae Junior 2009 hangaeriyaanu gron pri tharangayaen pasu ivath karana ladhi"" which translates to ""Pikae Junior after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix, he won the championship.""  This implies he won the race.
* Option B directly states ""piket juniyar jayagrahanaya kaleya"" which translates to ""Piket Junior won the championship"".  While technically ""won the championship"" is a broader statement, it's the closest and most accurate answer given the context of the provided text. The passage emphasizes his championship victory *after* the race.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: farnaendo alonso anathurakata lak viya** (Fernando Alonso crashed out): This is about Fernando Alonso, not Pikae Junior, and irrelevant to the question about Pikae Junior's achievement.
* **C: piket juniyar pasuwa iwath karana ladee** (Piket Junior after he made the move): This is vague and doesn't specify what Pikae Junior did.
* **D: aarakshaka rathaya anathurata lak viya** (The safety car went out):  This is about a safety car, not Pikae Junior's achievement.

(After the motor car that Alonso had been driving, the protected motor car went to get fuel, and he hoped to win the race.) This indicates Alonso was expecting to win after the car got fuel.  However, the next sentence says: ""Pikae juniyar 2009 hangaeriyaanu gron pri tharangayaen pasu ivath karana ladhi"" (Pikae Junior did something after the 2009 Hungary Grand Prix).  This implies something went wrong.

* **The question asks:** ""anathura sidu wuye kawadada?"" (What was Anathura's worry?)  

* **Option A directly addresses this:**  The context implies that Alonso (who is the subject of the first part of the passage) was worried *after* his service/the car's fuel stop.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: anek motar ratha indhana purawamin sitiya dee** (there are many car fuel stations) - Irrelevant to Alonso's worry.
* **C: aarakshitha motar rathaya eliyata paemineemata pera** (it was very important that the protected motor car went to the pit) - Doesn't relate to Alonso's emotional state.
* **D: pikat indhana piraweema sandaha giya pasu** (after going to get fuel) -  While related to the events, it doesn't directly answer what Alonso was worried *about*.



Therefore, **A** is the best and most logical answer.

"mema chedayata anuwa, paryeshakayan mulin sithuwata wadaa adu kalayak gatha karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **A: visheshaye nirmanaya weema (the formation of species)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the formation of a new species of finch in the Galapagos Islands.** The entire context is about how this new species evolved.
* **Question Q asks what the researchers are looking for related to the species' survival.** The passage states that the researchers want to understand the *formation* of this new species.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: visheshaya gaena waartha kirima (reporting news about the species):**  While the researchers *do* report news, the core of their investigation isn't just reporting, it's about the *process* of how the species came to be.
* **C: vividha vishesha athara prajananaya (reproduction among different species):** The passage focuses on the evolution *within* a species (a new type of finch), not reproduction between different species.
* **D: visheshaye parinamaya (the species' outcome/result):** While the new species *is* an outcome, the question is specifically about *how it came to be*, which relates to its formation process.



Therefore, the question is directly linked to the *formation* of the new species discussed in the passage.



"
paryeshakayan visin waartha kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: prajananayata sambandha paksheen (reproductive relationship of the birds)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the new Galapagos finch species were formed due to variations in their ""reproductive relationship"" (abhijananaya haethuven) and differences in their beak shapes (giyospaysaa forts, giyospaysaa konirostris).  The passage emphasizes how these differences *led to* the creation of new species.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: nawa visheshaya nirmanaya wu sthaanaya (location of the new species formation):** While the location is mentioned, it's not the *primary* reason for the change. The evolutionary change is about the birds themselves, not just the island.
* **B: parinameeya kriyawaliye diga (duration of the evolutionary process):**  The passage mentions a long duration, but the core of the explanation isn't the length of time, but *what* changed over that time.
* **C: nawa visheshaye nama (name of the new species):** The passage doesn't provide any names for the new species.



Therefore, option D accurately captures the crucial point: the changes in the reproductive relationships and beak shapes of the finches were the driving force behind the emergence of new species.



"
kawpereid paewaethwenne koheda?,"The correct answer is **B: bukarest nagaraye**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""bukarest nagara shaalaave vyaapaarayaka kotasaki."" This translates to ""Bucharest city school's business center.""
* **The question asks:** ""kawpereid paewaethwenne koheda?"" which means ""Where is the exhibition held?""
* **The text then says:** ""...maema nagaraya wae."" meaning ""...in this city.""  Since the text specifically mentions the Bucharest city school's business center, the exhibition is held in Bucharest.



The other options are incorrect:

* **A: rumeniyanu nagara kihipayaka:** ""Romanian city center"" - While Bucharest is the capital of Romania, the text points to Bucharest specifically.
* **C: ginikonadiga yuropaya puraa:** ""Ancient Europe"" - This is too general.
* **D: yuropeeya aganagara kihipayaka:** ""European capital city"" - This is also too general, although Bucharest *is* a capital city, the text is pointing to Bucharest specifically.



"
kawpereid niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: eya ginikonadiga yuropaya puraa gimhanayedee paewaethwena kalaa uthsawayaki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Mae vasarae juni sita agosthu dakvaa kaalaya thula lowae vishalathama mahajana kalaa ulela wana cow paeraed hi satkaarakathvaya sapayana ginikonadiga yuropayae palamu nagaraya maema nagaraya wae.""  This translates to: ""Those months, from June to August, a large, spectacular public art festival was held in the heart of Europe's ancient cities.""
* **The question asks:** ""kawpereid niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?"" which means ""Where did the festival spread and become prominent?""
* **Option C directly addresses this:** It says the festival was held in the heart of Europe's ancient cities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ""eya siduwanne """"nirmanasheelee"""" yaeyi saelakena nagarawala pamani ""** (""They built a ""sustainable"" city, aiming to..."") This is about the building of Bucharest's city hall, not the art festival.
* **B: eya nirmanaya karana ladde bukarest nagara shalaawa visini** (""They built it to construct the Bucharest city hall."") This is again about the city hall construction.
* **D: eya lowa vishaalathama mahajana kalaa uthsawaya we** (""It was a large public art festival."")  This is too general; it doesn't specify *where* the festival was prominent.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that correctly answers the question based on the provided passage.



"
II-76s bhaavithaya athhituweemata rusiyawata hethu wuye kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: abhyanthara hamudawa (internal turmoil)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the IL-76 planes were being dispersed due to ""abhyanthara balasaena visin maehaeyavaa"" which translates to ""internal turmoil within the armed forces."" The text goes on to say that this dispersal was happening in Russia and Soviet territories.  This indicates internal instability was the reason for the dispersal of the IL-76 planes.

The other options are less accurate:

* **B: anathurak (unstable/precarious)** While the situation is precarious, it doesn't directly state the *cause* of the dispersal.
* **C: soviyat hamudawa (Soviet army)**  While related, the text specifically mentions internal turmoil *within the armed forces*, not just the Soviet army generally.
* **D: vibhaaga wemin pawathina vimarshanayak (departmental criticism)** The passage doesn't mention any departmental criticism.

Therefore, **internal turmoil** is the most accurate and directly supported answer.
"
II-76 yanu kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: guvan yaanayak (military aircraft)**.

The text states that the IL-76 is a ""guvan yaanayak"" which translates to ""military aircraft"" or ""government aircraft"". The context further supports this, mentioning its use in transporting troops and cargo.
"
da simpsans sandaha liweeme kandaayama kuliyata gaththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: brooks**.

The passage states: ""1989 dee ohu brooks saha groninhata da simpsans thaenimata sahaya labaa dun athara vaedasatahanae palamu laekhana kandaayama bandavaa gaeneemae wagakeema da daeruvaeya."" This translates to: ""In 1989, he (Simpsons) received help from Brooks and Groening to write the screenplay."" Therefore, Brooks is mentioned as assisting Simpsons in writing the screenplay.
"
"flookta anuwa, aeyata dhanaathmaka adahas saha dirigaenweem yawamin sitiye kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: vaid‍yawarun (Doctor)**.

Here's why:

The question asks who is responsible for the long-term, significant, and morally damaging impact (dhanathmaka adahas saha dirigaenweem vishaala pramaanaya nisaa) on the relationship between the woman (kantha) and man (purusha) that is described in the initial statement.

The initial statement says the story is about a ""kaanthaavan visin kaantha soukya sambandhava kathaa"" - a story about a woman and a man's intimate relationship.  It then emphasizes that this relationship is severely damaged by the ""vaidyamaya washayaen"" (medical/pharmaceutical use) and its long-term effects.

Therefore, the one primarily responsible for such a profound and damaging impact is likely the **doctor (vaid‍yawarun)**, who prescribed or administered the harmful substance.  The other options are less likely:

* **B: kaantha sawukya kriyakareen (woman's sexual partner):** While the woman's partner is involved, the damage stems from the medical intervention.
* **C: purushayin (man):**  He is affected, but the doctor is the one who initiated the action leading to the damage.
* **D: kaantha saha purusha depaarshawayama (woman and man themselves):**  This is too broad; the problem isn't inherent to their relationship, but introduced by external factors.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, samaharun kaanthavan kumak pilibandawa viwurthawa katha kirimata akamaethi wuyeda?","The question asks what *kind* of story the speaker wants to read about a ""Kaanthavan"" (a respected/virtuous man) and his relationship with a ""Soukya Sambhava"" (a woman who is born with health/well-being).

The first part of the text describes the desired story as being lengthy, detailed, and focused on the deep bond between the couple, their love, and their shared experiences. It also mentions the challenges and hardships they face.

Looking at the options:

* **A: Pirimi pudgalayan (Fiction)** - This is a general category and could encompass the type of story the speaker wants.
* **B: Vaid‍ya viyadam (Medical Tale)** - While the woman is described as healthy, the text doesn't specifically indicate the story should be medical in nature.
* **C: Kaantha sawukyaya (Virtuous Woman)** - This describes the woman's character, but not the genre of story.
* **D: Flook (Bloop)** - This seems unrelated and is likely a typo.

Considering the description of a lengthy, detailed story about a couple's relationship with challenges, **A: Pirimi pudgalayan (Fiction)** is the most fitting answer. The text describes the story as being narrative, and ""fiction"" is the broadest category that would encompass a story about a couple's life.

Therefore, the correct answer is **A: Pirimi pudgalayan**.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, wadaathma gathikathawayakk dakwanne kumana graha wasthuwa da?","The correct answer is **A: pruthuwiya (earth)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states:  ""apa dannaa tharamata, taytanta vadaa gathikathvayak penwana graha vasthuvak aethae ekak pamani, ehi nama pruthuwiyay.""  This translates to: ""According to our knowledge, the celestial body that has a rotational movement is called Earth.""

Therefore, the question asks which celestial body has rotational movement, and the text directly answers that it's Earth (pruthuwiya).
"
vinivida penena diyarayak sahitha ganga saha vil handunaagena aeththe kumana graha wasthuwaka da?,"The correct answer is **A: brahaspathi**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes a planet with diverse features (""vinivida paeney"") and mentions it's a rocky planet (""gal kaeta"").
* The passage also states that Earth (""pruthuwiyay"") is a planet of that type (a rocky planet with a certain speed/dynamics).
* The question asks which planet has a river with a lake (""ganga saha vil handunaagena aeththe"").  Jupiter (Brahaspathi) is known for its prominent and complex atmospheric features, including swirling storms that could be metaphorically linked to rivers and lakes.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Tayitan:**  This is mentioned in the passage as a type of planet, but not specifically linked to rivers or lakes.
* **Suryaya:** This is the Sun.
* **Senasuru:** This is not a recognized planet.

Therefore, based on the clues in the passage and the characteristics associated with Jupiter, **brahaspathi** is the most likely answer."
pihatu soyagaeneeme prathiphalayak nowanne mema soyagaeneem walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: pihatu parinamaya pilibanda awabodhaya (Understanding about the consequences of fossils)**.

Here's why:

* **The text extensively discusses the consequences of fossil findings.** It talks about how fossils can reveal information about dinosaur evolution, their relationships to birds, their physical characteristics, and how they can be used to understand past environments and climate.
* **Option C directly reflects this focus on understanding the consequences of fossils.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sathwayage pihatuwala warnaya (Color of animal fossils):** While the text mentions fossilized bone, it doesn't focus on the color of the fossils.
* **B: piyasara kirima sandaha pihatu bhaavitha nokarana lada bawa awabodha kara gaeneema (Understanding the causes of fossilization):** The text touches on *how* fossils form in some instances (e.g., rapid burial), but the primary focus isn't on the *causes* of fossilization itself.
* **D: boho dynosarayanta pihatu thiboo bawa thahawuru kirima (Extensive discovery of fossils of many dinosaurs):** The text mentions fossil discoveries, but it's not solely about the *discovery* of many dinosaur fossils.  It's more about what we *learn* from them.



"
dynosarayange pihatu wala nothibune kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: yatin sudumaeli paata**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dynosar pihaatuvala hondin vardhitha praakshayak laesa haedinvena dandak nomaeti namuth, pihaatuvala wenath vishaeshaanga - naarati saha **pichkaanga** - aethi baevin praaksha maema wenath vishaeshaanga maen pasukaalina parinaamiya sanvardhanayakata samaana bhava paryaeshakayo anumaana karathi.""

This translates to: ""Dinosaur bones are mainly strengthened by the growth of fine pores, and the special features found in the bones - namely **naarati (teeth) and pichkaanga (claws)** - are considered to be similar to the growth of special features in the ancestors, allowing paleoecologists to make inferences.""

The question asks what is *not* found in dinosaur bones. Option D, ""yatin sudumaeli paata"" (which translates to ""thin, delicate sheet"" or something similar, and doesn't have a clear meaning in this context) is not mentioned as a feature of dinosaur bones in the provided text. The text explicitly mentions *pichkaanga* (claws) and *naarati* (teeth) as special features.

Therefore, D is the only option that isn't mentioned as a characteristic of dinosaur bones.

ZMApp pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: eya PALM athhada baeleemedee paalithayak lesa kaaryabharayak itu kaleya (It was found that the PALM trial showed a slight effectiveness of ZMapp.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""PALM athhadaa baelimaedee ZMapp paalithayak laesa salakanu labini..."" which translates to ""The PALM trial showed a slight effectiveness of ZMapp...""
* **Option C directly reflects this information.**
* **Option A** is incorrect because the passage doesn't say ZMapp is effective *against* all viruses, just that it showed *slight* effectiveness in the PALM trial.
* **Option B** is incorrect because the passage explicitly states that ZMapp *did* show some effectiveness, even if it wasn't a guaranteed cure.
* **Option D** is incorrect because the passage doesn't mention any positive outcomes in the broader study beyond the PALM trial.



"
PALM athhada baeleema niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: paalaka awshadhayak wenath prathikaara thunak samaga sansandanaya karana lada athara in ekak ZMapp viya**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""PALM athhadaa baelimaedee ZMapp paalithayak laesa salakanu labini, enam vidyaagnayo eya padanamak laesa salakaa, **waenath prathikaara thunak samaga sansandanaya kaloya.**"" (PALM, after a period of examination, obtained a promising result with ZMapp, and therefore the scientists began researching it along with antibodies.)

* **Option B directly reflects this:** It highlights that the researchers are investigating ZMapp *along with* antibodies, which is exactly what the passage describes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: adhyayanawalin heli wee aeththe eya kalin sithuwata wadaa waedi prathilaabha laba gatha haeki bawayi** (the study team was able to obtain a significant advantage in the current situation). While the study is promising, this option is too general and doesn't capture the specific action being taken (researching ZMapp with antibodies).
* **C: ZMapp athhada baeleema sandaha moolika padanamak lesa bhaavitha kerini** (ZMapp has slightly improved the original scientific value of the examination). The passage says it's a *promising* result, not a significant improvement to the original value.
* **D: pawathnaa thathwayanta piliyam kirimedee eya phaladayee bawa oppu wee aetha** (the examination, after studying the treatment, has been very successful).  While the results are promising, the passage doesn't explicitly state the examination has been *very successful*. It focuses on the initial promising result that led to further research.



"
nawa chipaya wadaathma waedagath wanu aeththe kohedaeyi paryeshakayan sithanne da?,"The correct answer is **B: dhanawath ratawal (wealthy countries)**.

Here's why:

The question asks where the impact of a new chip's production (and the associated environmental concerns) will be felt most. The text explicitly states: ""...adua aadaayamlaabhi ratawala rogingae pilikaava, kshya rogaya, ech.ay.wee saha maelaeriyaava waeni laeda roga kalin handunaa gaenimata haekiyaawa aethi karanu aetha."" This translates to ""...the disease that afflicts wealthy countries, such as cancer, AIDS, and malaria, will be able to be cured."" This indicates that the environmental problems caused by the chip manufacturing will disproportionately affect wealthier nations.

Therefore, the impact will be most strongly felt in **dhanawath ratawal (wealthy countries)**.
"
dosha nirnaya kirime upakaranaya godanaengeema sandaha kumana kramawedaya bhaavitha karayi da?,"The correct answer is **C: mud‍ranaya kala haeki chipayak (a chip with printing capability)**.

Here's why:

* **The question describes a need for a new diagnostic tool.** The first part of the question details the need for a tool capable of analyzing symptoms and potentially identifying diseases related to environmental pollution. It mentions diseases like cancer, tuberculosis, malaria, etc.
* **The need for a tool to analyze a large amount of data.** The question indicates the tool must be able to analyze a significant volume of data, even potentially comparing it to a large population's health data.
* **The options provided.**
    * **A: saema ekakatama eksath janapada shatha ekak (a single, very large population)** - This is a quantity, not a tool.
    * **B: saaman‍ya inkjet mud‍rana yanthrayak (a common inkjet printer)** -  A printer is for *outputting* information, not for *analyzing* it. While it *can* print results, it lacks the analytical capabilities the question requires.
    * **C: mud‍ranaya kala haeki chipayak (a chip with printing capability)** - This option fits best. A chip *with printing capability* could be used to store and display the results of a complex analysis performed by a larger, unseen processing unit.  It's a plausible component of a diagnostic tool.
    * **D: wenath dosha nirnaya kirime mewalam (not suitable for diagnosing diseases)** - This is incorrect because the question *is* about creating a diagnostic tool.

**Therefore, the most logical answer is C, as a chip with printing capabilities could be part of a sophisticated diagnostic tool analyzing environmental health data.**

"mema chedayata anuwa, sakhanditha mohora pilibanda sathya nowanne kumana prakaashaya da?","The correct answer is **C: samahara vita eya chand‍rayage haekileeme prathiphalayak viya haekiya**

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks what illuminates the ""sankhitta mohora"" (condensed brilliance).
* **The text (P)** describes the ""Vidyaagnayo"" (the one with knowledge) as having a brilliant face (sankhitta mohora) and a connection to the moon (chandrayaa).  It also mentions that the moon's energy is essential for achieving spiritual success.  The brilliance of the face is described as a reflection of the moon's radiance.
* **Option C** states that the brilliance is a result of the moon's radiance. This directly aligns with the description in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  The text says achieving the ""maethakadee"" (spiritual success) *requires* the moon's energy, not that achieving the brilliance *creates* the success.
* **B:** The text states the brilliance is *connected* to the moon's energy, not that it is *not* dependent on the moon.
* **D:** The text explicitly mentions that the brilliance is related to the ""sankhitta mohora"" (condensed brilliance) and the ""chandrayaa"" (moon).



Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately reflects the information presented in the text.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the moon (Chandraya) as the source of all knowledge (bhoo vidya) and a guiding force (maethakadi).** It states that the moon's influence leads to intellectual achievements and spiritual attainment.
* **The question asks about the moon's role in the earth's knowledge.**
* **Option C directly reflects this central theme:**  It positions the moon as the originator and standard for the earth's knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sanda semen haekilemin pawathee (The story of the moon and semen)** - This option is irrelevant and not supported by the passage.
* **B: mema bhoo haedayan boho kalakata pera nirmanaya wee aetha (It builds many different structures for the earth's knowledge)** - The passage doesn't mention structures. It focuses on the *source* and *influence* of knowledge.
* **D: mema bhoo haedayan tharamak maethakadee nirmanaya wee aetha (It builds hierarchical knowledge structures)** - Similar to B, the passage doesn't focus on hierarchical structures.

Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately answers the question based on the information provided in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, adhichodanaa gonu karana thek thawath sidu nowanu aeththe kumak da?","The correct answer is **C: aesin dutu saakshi pilibanda sakachcha kirim (reporting based on the testimony of the messenger)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where a messenger (aesin dutu) is giving testimony.** The core of the issue revolves around the messenger's report and the information he conveyed.
* **The question asks how the investigation (adhichodanaa) is proceeding based on the testimony (anuwa).**
* **Option C directly addresses this:** it highlights the reporting process based on the messenger's testimony. The passage explicitly mentions ""aesin dutu saakshi dushitha thahtvayata pathviya haekiya"" (the messenger's testimony was heard).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: waedidura adahas daekweem (long-distance communication):** While communication is involved, the passage doesn't focus on the *method* of communication.
* **B: chayaroopa prasiddha kirima (public reporting/dissemination):** While the information might eventually be disseminated, the immediate focus is on the testimony itself.
* **D: lipi prakaashana (printing):** Printing is not mentioned or relevant to the immediate investigation process described.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, seel masun dadayam karannanta warthamana gaetaluwak nowanne kumak da?","The correct answer is **A: daedi kaalaguna thaththwayan**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the reason for *not* being able to easily melt ice, despite the temperature being above freezing?
* **The passage states:** ""Kaedaena ayisvalata amatarava, daedi kaalaguna thathwayan da beraa gaeneeme prayathnavalata baadhaa wee aetha."" This translates to: ""Ice does not melt easily, because of the properties of the substance itself.""
* **Therefore:** The passage directly identifies the *inherent properties* of ice as the reason for its resistance to melting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ayis praamanaya (Ice measurement):**  The passage doesn't discuss measuring ice.
* **C: ayis wala ghanakama (Density of ice):** While density is a property of ice, the passage doesn't directly connect the *density* to its difficulty in melting.
* **D: ayis unu weema (Ice melting):** This describes the process, not the *reason* for the difficulty in melting.



"
"ayis walata amatharawa, beraa gaeneeme prayathnawalata thawath balapanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: seel masun dadayam karannan (practicing virtue)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pitmanta anuva, meya seel masun dadayam karana naev..."" which translates to ""After the death of Kaedaena, it is necessary to practice virtue...""  This directly links practicing virtue to the solution for the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pramaanawath saepayumak nomaethi weema (reasonable effort and ethical conduct):** While effort and ethics are important, the passage specifically highlights *virtue* (seel masun dadayam) as the key solution.
* **B: kaalaguna thaththwayan (scientific principles):** The passage mentions scientific principles (kaalaguna thaththwayan) as the basis for the pitmanta plan, but not as the solution to the problem of the ice melting.
* **C: pramaanawath udaw nomaethikama (reasonable action and ethics):** Similar to option A, while reasonable action and ethics are good, the passage emphasizes virtue (seel masun dadayam) as the primary solution.



Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is **D**.
"
robarts thahawuru kirimen waelakee sitiye kumana vishwaasayada?,"The correct answer is **D: pawudgalikathwayata aethi ayithiya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...wo ham visvaasa kala bavada ohu thahavuru kale ya."" This translates to ""...he (Robarts) maintained a belief in the unshakeable/unwavering (ayithiya) nature of the earth.""  The context strongly suggests that he believed in something fixed, constant, and beyond change – which aligns with the concept of ""ayithiya"" (unwavering/eternal).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nadu pilibanda saakachcha kirime dee sadachaara sampanna bawa (maintaining faith in the central teachings and being morally upright):** While Robarts might have been morally upright, the passage doesn't explicitly say he focused on ""central teachings."" The emphasis is on the nature of his belief itself.
*   **B: sh‍reshtaadhikaranaye sthaawara theendu wala waedagathkama (faith in the unshakeable nature of the best qualities):**  The passage mentions ""best qualities"" (shrestadhikarana), but the focus is on the earth's stability, not necessarily qualities.
*   **C: jiwaye aarambhaya (at the beginning of life):** The passage doesn't connect his belief to the beginning of life. It's about the *nature* of his belief, not *when* it started.



"
saakachcha kirimata ithamath sadaachaara virodhee yaeyi robarts haegune kumana maathrukawada?,"The correct answer is **C: gam‍yamana pawudgalikathwayata aethi ayithiya**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Roberts as engaging in behaviors that are considered unethical (sadachara sampanna novena bavayi). It specifically mentions his ""gam‍yamana pawudgalikathwayata aethi ayithiya"" - which translates to ""unethical behavior related to material gain."" The text connects this unethical behavior to his belief system and his adherence to the idea of being ""earth-established and permanent.""  This suggests he prioritized worldly possessions and power, leading to unethical actions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: sh‍reshtaadhikaranaye sthaawara theendu (rooted in superiority):** While his behavior might stem from a sense of superiority, the core issue highlighted is his unethical actions driven by material gain.
* **B: royi v. -wed ediriwa naduwe theenduwa (a stance opposing Royi V. -wed):**  The passage doesn't discuss a direct opposition to Royi V.-wed. 
* **D: nadu wala visheshitha karunu (special emphasis on the center):** This doesn't directly relate to Roberts' unethical behavior or his belief system.



Therefore, option C most accurately reflects the passage's description of Roberts' unethical behavior and its connection to his belief in material gain."

* **Q (Question):** ""mema chedayata anuwa, mema sthaanaye nawa us godanaegili idi karanu laebuwe kawadada?"" translates to ""Regarding this situation, what could I have done at this place with nine years of experience?"" The question is asking about the *time* the action occurred.

* **P (Passage):**  ""Hariyatama ude 8:46 ta palamu jet yaanaya ehi ilakkayata prahaara kala harima avasthaava lakunu karamin nagaraya pura nissabdatavak aethi viya. Aaloka kadamba dekak raathri kalaye ihala ahasata ella wana lesa sakasaa aetha. Mehi nava us godaenagili pahak, pravaahana madyasthaanayak saha madyaye smarana udyaanayak sandaha wana idikireem katayutu sidu keremin pawathee."" translates to ""At most, at 8:46 AM, the train that passed by, in that calm city, with all the lights in the evening, a single lotus flower bloomed in the water. I, with nine years of experience, was standing by the flowing river and the memorial garden in the middle, looking at the blooming lotus.""

The passage explicitly states that the lotus flower bloomed **raathri kalaye** (in the evening/night). The question asks about the time *the action* (the lotus blooming) occurred.  Therefore,  ""raathriyehi"" (at night/evening) is the correct time mentioned in the passage.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dawase maeda** (yesterday): The passage mentions 8:46 AM, not yesterday.
* **B: ude 8:46 ta** (at 8:46 AM): This is the *time* the train passed, not the time the lotus bloomed. The question isn't really asking about the train.
* **D: idikirim katayuthu sidu wemin pawathee** (looking at the blooming lotus): This describes the action *being done*, not the time it happened.



"
sewan sistars yanu guhaa bawata hangawana thorathuru monawada?,"The correct answer is **A: ushnathwa wenas weem** (heat absorption).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Divaa saha raathri kaalaye ushnathwa venasvim penwana adhorakta rupa magin, eva guha viya haeki bavata penwanu laebe."" This translates to ""In day and night, it absorbs heat, appearing like a reddish glow, and is found in a way that resembles a cave.""

The question asks what the Sevan Sisters are doing within the cave. The passage directly states they are ""ushnathwa venasvim penwana"" - absorbing heat. While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they are not the *primary* action the Sevan Sisters are performing *within* the cave.
"
sewan sistars ge thaapa haesireema nireekshanaya karanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **D: pruthiviye guhaa pilibanda sameekshana (Earth's cave examination)**.

The text states: ""...eva boho vita tharamak niyata ushnathwayak pavatvaa gene yana namuth eya bhoomiye gaemburu siduru weema samaga samapaatha we... yaeyi aerisonaahi, flagstaf hi pihiti uthuru aerisona vishwa vidyaalaye aemarikaa eksath janapada bhuvidyaatmaka samikshana (usgs) abyavakaasa bhu vidyaa kandaayame glen kushin paewaseeya.""

This indicates that the Sevan Sisters' geothermal activity is being examined as part of a larger Earth's cave examination conducted by the USGS (United States Geological Survey) at Glen Kusin, near Flagstaff, Arizona.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, saekakaru pilibanda sathya nowana prakaashaya wanne kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: ohu pupurana d‍ravyayak pupuruwa haeriya bawata chodanaa kere**

Here's why:

* The question asks what truth is revealed about the person's behavior.
* The text states: ""Minisa pupurana drawya puravana lada thri roda rathayak senaga madyayata dhaawanaya kala bavata chodanaa kere."" This translates to: ""The person, a consumer of old substances, repeatedly mixed and used a liquid by applying it to the skin.""
* This indicates that the person was applying an old substance (possibly a type of dye or cosmetic) to their skin.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohu prahaaraya atharathura waahanayak bhaavitha kaleya** - This translates to ""he/she imagined a heroic journey.""  While possibly true, the text doesn't explicitly mention imagination or a heroic journey.
* **C: ohuge janawargikathwaya baladhaareenta dannaa karunaki** - This translates to ""he/she did not reveal their social status."" While the text mentions the person's name was known and they had a strong reputation, it doesn't explicitly state they *didn't* reveal their social status. The text focuses on the skin application.
* **D: ohu thuwala nolaebeeya** - This translates to ""he/she did not get a towel."" The text states that the person was able to obtain towels.

Therefore, the most accurate truth revealed about the person's behavior is that they were applying an old substance to their skin.



"
prahaaraya sambandhayen baladhaareen thahawuru kara aethi thorathuru monawada?,"The answer is **D: saekakaruge palamu saha awasana nama (The family and reputation of the artist)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Ohu uyigar jana kandaayame saamaajikayeku bhava misa ohuge nama thawamath baladhaarin nodani.""  This translates roughly to: ""He is a well-known social person, and his name carries a lot of reputation/power.""  The question asks what's related to the ""baladhaareen"" (reputation/power).

The sentence directly links the ""baladhaareen"" to ""ohuge nama thawamath"" - his name/reputation. The context implies that his family and the overall reputation associated with his name are the source of this power.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: siyalu sahayakayinge anan‍yathawa (The uniqueness of all assistants):** This is irrelevant to the text.
*   **B: saekakaruge janawargikathwaya (The social classification of the artist):** While social standing *can* contribute to reputation, the text focuses directly on the name's power, not the artist's social class.
*   **C: prahaaraya pitupasa aethi abhipreranaya (The inspiration of the artist's father):** The text doesn't mention the artist's father.

Therefore, the most accurate answer, based on the given text, is **D**."
elis park hi paewaethwena tharagayedee kumana kandaayam kreedaa karanu aethda?,"The correct answer is **C: dakunu aprikaava saha ost‍reliyawa**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tharaga malave avasan tharagaya, springbok saha oustreliyava athara, eelanga sathiye johaennasbarg elis park hi paewaethwenu aetha.""  This translates to: ""The final match, alongside Springboks and Australia, was played at Johnannesburg Ellis Park in South Africa.""

Therefore, the teams playing at Ellis Park in the final match were South Africa (Springboks) and Australia.  The ""ol blaeks"" (Blacks, referring to the South African team) also played in the final, but the question asks *who* played at Ellis Park in the final *with* the Springboks and Australia.
"
springboksge eelanga tharagaya kreedaa karanne koheda?,"The correct answer is **C: johaennasbarg**.

The passage states: ""Tharaga malave avasan tharagaya, springbok saha oustreliyava athara, **eelanga sathiye johaennasbarg elis park hi paewaethwenu aetha**.""  This translates to ""The final match, along with Springbok and Australia, was held at Johnannesburg Ellis Park for the fourth round.""
"
meheyuma atharathura abhyawakasha madyasthaanayata sidu wu karadara pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: therapanayangen niwaeradi dura pawathwa gaeneema** (Therapanyangen niwaeradi dura pawathwa gaeneema).

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What did they do to achieve the space in the middle?"" (meheyuma atharathura abhyawakasha madyasthaanayata sidu wu karadara pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?)
* **The text states:** ""Rusiyanu bhoomi paalanaya jet yaana sakreeya kala athara dumriya sthaanaye saamanya aakalpaya nawatha labaa ganna ladi. Therapanayangen niwaeradi dura pawathwa gaeneema"" (Russia, in the age of jet aircraft and similar technologies, struggled to gain a common perception [or understanding] by traveling far from the Theravada lineage).
* **Therefore, the text directly connects the achievement of space (or understanding) in the middle (middle ground) to the Theravada lineage's efforts to travel far.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vibhramanekshayak pawathwa gaeneema** (Traveling with a vibhramanekshayak - a type of aircraft) -  While related to travel, the text doesn't specifically state that *this* was the method used.
* **C: jet sakreeya kirima** (Jet aircraft operation) - Similar to B, this is a technology used, but not directly linked to achieving the middle ground.
* **D: saaman‍ya aakalpaya naewatha laba gaeneema** (Gaining a common perception/understanding) - This is the *goal*, not the *method* used to achieve the space in the middle.

"mema chedayata anuwa, abhyawakasha madyasthaana meheyume aramuna kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: saekasum therapanayata sameepa weema (near the 100th Arahat)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...Chiyao saha Sharipov vaarthaa kale dishanathi saekasum terapanayangen aarakshitha durakin sitina bavayi.""  This translates to ""...Chiyao and Sharipov discussed and went to the place where the 100th Arahat was residing.""

* **The question asks:** ""mema chedayata anuwa, abhyawakasha madyasthaana meheyume aramuna kumakda?"" This translates to ""What is the location of the Abhyawakasha Madyasthaana Meheyu (a special meditation place) that you are asking about?""

* **Option B directly reflects the information in the passage.** The passage explicitly mentions the location related to the 100th Arahat.  The other options are incorrect:
    * **A:**  While the passage mentions ""vibhramanekshayak"" (a place for meditation), it doesn't directly state that's *the* answer to where the Abhyawakasha Madyasthaana Meheyu is.
    * **C:**  ""Abhyawakasha gamanak sampoorna kirima"" (completing the Abhyawakasha journey) is a *process*, not a location.
    * **D:** ""Jet yanaa sakreeya kirima"" (actively engaging in jet yana) refers to a spiritual practice, not a place.



Therefore, **B** is the only answer supported by the provided text.

mema naduwa pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: e. o. el moolasthaanaya pihita aethi pranthaye eyata erehiwa nadu pawaranu laebuwe ya.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What is the truth about the development of the central power grid that you have seen?"" (Translated from Sinhala)
* **The passage states:** The development of the central power grid (memanaduva) involved connecting the power grid to the power lines of the Parisilaka Theepael pettivalata vidyuth thaepael in 2003, and establishing a system to ensure the availability of required power.
* **Option A directly reflects a key detail mentioned in the passage:** The passage explicitly states that the development involved connecting to power lines *in the hidden area of E.O.L.'s native land*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Waradakaruweku karana ladee (The action of the donor):** While the passage mentions the donor (varadakaru), it doesn't focus on *their action* specifically regarding the truth of the development.
* **C: Mema naduwedee ayaachitha thaepael pilibanda neethi bhaavitha karana ladee (The action of establishing ethics regarding required power):**  The passage mentions establishing a system for ensuring power availability, but doesn't focus on the *ethics* involved.
* **D: E. O. L. hata chodanaa gonu karana ladee (The action of E.O.L. thinking/reasoning):** The passage doesn't detail E.O.L.'s thoughts or reasoning about the development.



Therefore, option A is the only one that accurately represents a factual detail derived from the provided text."
mema naduwa niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?,"The correct answer is **E: o. o. el hata illum nokala bedahaereema sambandhayen chodanaa ella viya (Considering the thoughts related to the expansion of our region with the help of high-speed internet).**

Here's why:

* **The question (Q) asks:** ""How is our region's expansion being considered with the help of high-speed internet?""
* **The passage (P) states:** The passage talks about the need for high-speed internet to support various services (like online services, educational institutions, etc.) and mentions a plan to implement it.  It also mentions ""E.O.L. Hata Illum Nokala Bedahaereema sambandhayen chodanaa"" (Considering the thoughts related to the expansion of our region with the help of high-speed internet) as the primary goal.
* **Option E directly addresses the question** by linking the expansion of the region to the use of high-speed internet, as mentioned in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While related, the passage focuses on the *planning* for internet services, not specifically on the *providers* of those services.
* **C:**  While 2003 is mentioned, it's only a timeframe relating to the introduction of electricity, not the current expansion of internet.
* **D:** The passage doesn't explicitly state when E.O.L. began considering this expansion. It just mentions that the concept is being thought about.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, vidaal meeta waara thunakata pera kreedaa kirimata patan gaththe kumana samajaya sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: seweelaa**.

Here's why:

The question asks where the person was playing volleyball. The passage states ""28 haeviridi vidaal, vaara tunakata pera sevila wethin barka ha ek viya."" This translates to ""The 28th in the volleyball, they were playing in Seville.""

Therefore, the answer is Seville.
"
vidaal barchaa wenuwen tharaga keeyak kreedaa kalada?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The question asks how many sports were played in the Vidaal schools. The text states: ""49 ka kreeda kara aetha,"" which translates to ""49 sports were played.""
"
ema tharagaye prathiwadee kandaayama wuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **D: ithaliya**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""ema tharagaye prathiwadee kandaayama wuye kawuda?"" which translates to ""Who is the opposite of this type of person?"".  The passage describes someone who:

*   ""Jaark edina udaesana itaaliye kavarsiyaanohi purva-vaara puhunuvim wala yedee sitiyeya."" -  Is someone who has traveled to Italy and spoken the ancient language (likely referring to Latin).
*   ""boloniyata erehiva iridaa paewaethweemata niyamithawa thibu tharagayakata pera ohu kandaayam hotelaye naewathee sitiyeya."" - Regularly stays in a budget hotel for events in Bologna.
*   ""Boloniyaavata erehiva iridaa paewaethweemata saelasum kala tharagayak paewaethweemata pera ohu kandaayame hotalayehi naewathee sitiyeya."" - Also stays in a budget hotel for events in Bologna where he sells something.

This description points to a **tourist** or someone who frequently travels. The opposite of someone who travels to Italy is someone who is **from** Italy. Thus, the opposite of someone who travels to Italy is an Italian person, making **Ithaliya** the correct answer.



**Therefore, the answer is D.**"
jark hotalaye naewathee sitiye aeyi?,"The correct answer is **C: ohu irida tharagayak thibuni (He was a tourist.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jaark edina udaesana itaaliye kavarsiyaanohi purva-vaara puhunuvim wala yedee sitiyeya."" This translates to ""Year after year, he would come to Italy to speak his native language. He would stay at a hotel in Kandy, where tourists often stay.""
* **The question asks:** ""jark hotalaye naewathee sitiye aeyi? (Why did Jark stay at the hotel?)
* **The passage explicitly says:** ""Boloniyaavata erehiva iridaa paewaethweemata saelasum kala tharagayak paewaethweemata pera ohu kandaayame hotalayehi naewathee sitiyeya."" This translates to ""He would stay at a hotel in Kandy, where tourists often stay, because he was a tourist who sold antique items in Bolonia.""

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that he was a tourist. Options A, B, and D are less directly supported by the text. While he spoke his native language and might have had connections to Bolonia, the core reason for staying at the hotel was his tourist status.



"
jakartha bhoo goleeya bhawthika niyojithayathanaya anathuru aengaweemak nikuth nokale aeyi?,"The correct answer is **B: nevaasikayan santhrasayata path weema walakwa gaeneemata**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sunaami tarjanayak nomaeti vuvat, nevasikayin santraasayata path wee ovunge vyaapara saha nivaasa valin pita weemata patan gathha.""

This translates to: ""The tsunami swept away the non-residential areas, damaging their commercial and residential buildings.""

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the information given in the text.  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: sunaamiyaka tharjanayak nothibuni:** The text clearly states a tsunami occurred.
* **C: desheeya vyaaparawalata balapaemak aethi weema walakwa gaeneema:** This refers to damage to national commercial facilities, which isn't mentioned.
* **D: eya kampanayak sandaha wu pramaana awashyathawaya sapuranu nolaebeeya:**  The text mentions an earthquake of magnitude 6.5, which is strong enough to cause the tsunami.



"
"ema chedayata anuwa, bhoomikampawa nisa aethi wuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: santhrasayata path pradeshawaseen (santhrasayata path pradeshawaseen)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sunaami tarjanayak nomaeti vuvat, nevasikayin santraasayata path wee ovunge vyaapara saha nivaasa valin pita weemata patan gathha."" This translates to: ""The tsunami swept through the coastal region, destroying their commercial and residential areas.""

Therefore, the tsunami impacted the coastal region (santhrasayata path pradeshawaseen).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sunaami tharjanayak (the tsunami itself):** While the tsunami *caused* the destruction, the question asks *where* it caused the destruction.
* **C: nikuth karana lada anathuru aengaweemak (the earthquake that caused the tsunami):**  The earthquake is the *cause* of the tsunami, not the location of the impact.
* **D: 6.5 ka vishaalathwa parimanayak (the magnitude of 6.5):**  The magnitude refers to the strength of the earthquake and doesn't specify where the tsunami's impact was felt.



"
me atharin suryayage saha anekuth tharakawala kriyakareethwayata hethu wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: deepthiya, rosbi ankaya saha bhramanaya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Suryayaada anek thaarakawalata samaana muladharmavalata anuvama kriyaatmaka wana bhava ovuhu soyaagat ha: paddhatiye pawathina siyalu tharakawala kriyaakaarakama vena kisivak nova evaaye diptiya saha evaye karakaevima magin paalanaya kerena bhava handunaa ganna ladi.""  This translates to: ""The Sun has a complex, fundamental, and reactive magnetic field.  All the stellar processes in its system are controlled by its luminosity and its magnetic characteristics.""  This establishes that luminosity and magnetic characteristics are key.
* **The passage also states:** ""Tharuvaka plasma pravaahayata adaala wana rosby ankaya tirana kirimata diptiya saha bramanaya ekva bhavitha kere. Rosby ankaya kudaa wana tharamata, chumbaka prathyaavartanavalata sapeksava tharuva adu kriyaakari bavak dakvayi."" This translates to: ""The luminosity is transferred to the large Rossby number current, which is carried by the rotation and the magnetic field.  The Rossby number, in turn, is related to the magnetic field and the relative rotation.""  This highlights the roles of the Rossby number, rotation, and magnetic field.

Therefore, the factors controlling the Sun's complex magnetic activity are its luminosity (deepthiya), the Rossby number, and rotation (bhramanaya) and magnetic field (chumbaka prathyaavartanavalata).  Option D encompasses all these elements.
"
tharakawaka rosbi ankaya theeranaya wanne keseda?,"The correct answer is **A: deepthiya saha bhramanaya (illumination and rotation)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tharuvaka plasma pravaahayata adaala wana rosby ankaya tirana kirimata diptiya saha bramanaya ekva bhavitha kere.""  This translates to: ""After the plasma flow, the Rossby number, being oriented in the direction of illumination and rotation, will become equal.""

Therefore, the Rossby number is related to both illumination (deepthi) and rotation (bhramanaya).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: plaasma prawahaye pramaanaya (plasma flow rate):** While plasma flow is mentioned, the text specifically links the Rossby number to illumination and rotation, not the flow rate itself.
*   **C: kriyakareethwaye mattama (only to activity):** The text mentions both illumination and rotation, not just activity.
*   **D: chumbaka prathyaavarthana pramaanaya (magnetic reflection rate):**  The text states that the Rossby number is related to magnetic reflection *after* it is oriented by illumination and rotation, but it's not the primary factor determining the Rossby number itself.



"

The text states: ""Chanda vimasimehi aethi ayagen siyayata 34 k dharana mataya wanne devaeni elisabeth raejina oustreliyaave avasaana adhiraajyaya wanawata kaemati bavayi. Chanda vimasima avasaanaye dee samikshanayata paathra woo ayagen 29% k haeki ikmanin oustreliyaava janarajayak viya yuthu bhava visvaasa karana athara...""

This translates to: ""While Queen Elizabeth II expressed her opinion on the matter, 34% of those surveyed agreed with her. However, 29% of those surveyed believed that an Australian monarch would not support the war...""

Therefore, 29% of those surveyed believed an Australian monarch would *not* support the war, which is the question asked.
"
"julee gilaardta anuwa, ost‍reliyawa janarajayak bawata pathviya yuththe kawadada?","The correct answer is **B: dewana elisabeth raejinage palana samayen pasu** (after the reign of Queen Elizabeth).

Here's why:

* The text states that after the reign of Queen Elizabeth, 29% of Australians started to believe that Australia should not have a monarchy.
* This shift in opinion occurred *after* the Federal debate.
* The text highlights that the Federal debate (specifically regarding the 2008 referendum) contributed to this change in opinion.

Therefore, the belief that Australia should not have a monarchy emerged *after* Queen Elizabeth's reign and the Federal debate.
"
neethimaya vimarshanayata bhajanaya wana sanvidhaanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: adheekshana ha vimarshana anukamituva (supervision and critical evaluation)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where a ""sterns"" (likely a leader or supervisor) is tasked with overseeing and critically evaluating the ""selasumgata demaapiyabhaavaya"" (likely a project or undertaking). The passage explicitly states that the ""kaaryabhaaraya"" (responsibilities) of the leader include ensuring that the ""selasumgata demaapiyabhaavaya"" is managed through ""adhikshana ha vimarsana anukamituve"" - supervision and critical evaluation.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gruhastha balashakthi ha wanija kamituva (householder strength and commercial activity):** While these might be factors influencing the broader context, the core task assigned to the leader is *not* simply to oversee householder strength and commercial activity.
*   **B: komen padanama (commanding position):** The passage describes a role involving supervision and evaluation, not just a commanding position.
*   **C: saelasumgatha demapiyabhawaya (selasumgata demaapiyabhaavaya):**  The leader is tasked with evaluating *this*, but the evaluation itself happens *through* supervision and critical analysis.  It's not the overarching answer to *what* the evaluation is based on.



"
klif stiyarns kumana kamituwe pradhaaniya da?,"The correct answer is **A: gruhastha balashakthi ha wanija kamituva**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gruhastha balashakthi ha vaanija kamituva yatathe pawathina adhikshana ha vimarsana anukamituve sabhaapativaraya lesa ohuge kaaryabhaaraya thula saelasumgata demaapiyabhaavaya haraha gabsaavan sandaha aramudal yedavimata badhu bhavitha karanne daeyi sterns vimarsanaya karayi.""

This translates to: ""The chairman's main task, according to the standard of oversight and criticism, is to make the chairman's duty to manage the saline-based (demapiyabhawaya) in a proper way, with the help of household strength and commercial activity.""

Therefore, ""gruhastha balashakthi ha vaanija kamituva"" (household strength and commercial activity) are identified as the main activities related to the chairman's task.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, swis kanthavata sidu nowuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: aege durakathanaya saha laeptop pariganakaya soraagena aetha** (They stole the mobile phone and laptop).

Here's why:

* The question asks what the Swiss gang stole.
* The provided text explicitly states: ""api athara, aeyage durakathanaya saha laeptop pariganakaya soyagena tibenava"" which translates to ""they stole their mobile phone and laptop.""
* Option D directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aege soraagath bhaanda soya gannaa ladee** (They stole a silver vessel). This is not mentioned in the text.
* **B: aeya maraa damana ladee** (They killed someone). This is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: aeya 5 deneku visin lingika athawarayata lak karana ladee** (They attacked 5 people with a sharp weapon). This is not mentioned in the text.



"

The text states: ""...asus ee peesee pariganakaya, 2007 thaipe toraturu thaaksana maasayehi vadaat unusum matrukavak viya."" This translates to ""...the Asus PC, released in Taipei Computer Show in May 2007.""
"
aasus ee peesee yanu kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: laeptop pariganakayak** (Laptop computer).

The text explicitly states ""asus ee peesee pariganakaya"" which translates to ""Asus's PC computer.""  The subsequent description of its features like a touchscreen, high performance, and thin design further confirms it's a laptop.
"
athurudan wu thaepael lekhanawalata wagakiwa yuththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: Pirimi lamayek (A child)**.

The passage clearly states: ""Ek pirimi lamayeku, aluth avurudu suba paetum path 429 k aetuluva, thaepael lekhana 600 kata wadi pramaanayak sangavaa aethi bawath eva adaala pudgalayanta nolaeby aethi bawath soyaa gaenimen pasuwa..."" which translates to ""A child, with Aluth Avurudu Suba Paetum Path 429 and a telephone bill of 600 kata, was among the people who came to the telephone office after...""

Therefore, the child is the one who needed to go to the telephone office.
"
"memama chedayata anuwa, athurudahan wu liyakiyavili sambandhayen kanagatuwa pala kara sitiye kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: maadhyaya (middle)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the person (the ""pirimi lamaya"" - young person) was asked to help with the ""kanagatuwa pala kara sitiye"" (counting/verification) *between* the police station and the media (specifically the ""maadhya wetha siya"").  Therefore, the ""maadhya wetha siya"" (media) represents the middle point between the police station (thaepael kaaryalaya) and the area where the residents are counted.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pradesheeya nevasikayan (local residents):**  The residents are *being counted*, they are not the ones doing the counting or the middle point.
* **B: pirimi lamaya (young person):** The young person is *doing* the counting, not the middle point.
* **D: obanaasawa thaepael kaaryalaya (obanaasawa police station):**  The police station is one end of the range being counted, not the middle point.



"
del potrota ohuge urahis gaetaluwa visandeemata awashya wuye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **D: thewana samana lakunu gaeneeme waarayata pasuwa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""eka ha samaana lakunu gaenimen pasuwa, palamu set vataya mare paraajaya viya."" This translates to ""After one and the same score, they suffered defeat in the final set.""
* **The question asks:** ""del potrota ohuge urahis gaetaluwa visandeemata awashya wuye kawadada?"" This translates to ""What is necessary for the player's morale to be boosted?""

The passage directly links the defeat *after* the same score to the need for a morale boost.  Therefore, the morale boost is necessary *after* the defeat following a tied score. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because they refer to earlier points in the game, not the specific scenario described in the passage as triggering the need for a morale boost.

"

The passage states: ""...ekaa ha samaana lakunu gaenimen pasuwa, palamu set vataya mare paraajaya viya."" This translates to ""...after achieving the same score, the team lost.""  The question asks what the result was when the team achieved the same score. Therefore, the team lost, which is described as ""paraajayata pathviya"" (lost).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: thuwala weemen pasu del potro paraajayata pathviya** (The son of the water-skilled player lost): The passage doesn't mention anything about a water-skilled player or a son.
* **C: dewana set waaraye mure paraajayata pathviya** (The elder team lost): The passage refers to ""palamu set"" (the team) - not specifically the elder team.
* **D: dewana set waaraye del potro jayagrahanaya kaleya** (The elder team's son achieved victory): The passage explicitly states they *lost*, not achieved victory.

"mema chedaye sandahan kara aethi paridi, visheshayen rogiyekuta niraawaranaya wuye kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: aandukarawaraya**.

Here's why:

* The text states, ""Aandukaaravaraya thavaduratat kiya sitiye, """"ada apata danagannata laebune samahara paasal vayase daruvan rogiya samaga sambandhatha pavatvaa aethi bavata handunaagena aethi"""" bavaya.""  This translates to ""The dark-skinned person said, 'We have learned that a young person of a certain age is connected with the sick person.'""

The question asks who the person is who is investigating the situation and revealing the information about the young person and the sick person. The dark-skinned person is the one investigating and revealing this information.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: daruwan (young person):** The young person is the *subject* of the investigation, not the one doing the investigating.
* **C: teksas niladhaareen (Texas residents):**  The text mentions Texas residents in the initial statement about the person being in Texas, but they are not the ones investigating.
* **D: pradesheeya nevaasikayin (local resident):** This is a general term and doesn't specifically identify the investigator.  The dark-skinned person is more specific.

"mema chedayata anuwa, teksas vaesiyan aematheemedee aandukarawaraya laba nodun sahathikaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: mema kriya piliwela hondin kriyathmaka we**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...mahajana aarakshava suraekimata piyavara gene thibu bavata ohu teksas hi vaesiyanta thahavuru kaleya. Aandukaaravaraya thavaduratat kiya sitiye, """"ada apata danagannata laebune samahara paasal vayase daruvan rogiya samaga sambandhatha pavatvaa aethi bavata handunaagena aethi"""" bavaya. Ohu thavaduratat kiya sitiye, """"mema siduweema barapathalayi. apage kriyaa piliwela kriyaatmaka wana bavatat, viya yuthu bavatat sahatikayi"""" bhava ya."" This translates to ""...he, having a background in public safety and being a skilled marksman, shot the Texas prostitute. The darkness said, ""We have been able to understand that he has connected with a sick young man of a certain age."" He said, ""Our downfall is due to our actions. In the realm of good deeds, and also in the realm of violence, it is alike.""""

* **The key takeaway is:** The darkness (representing the consequences/judgment) says the downfall is *due to their actions* (referring to the marksman).  The marksman himself acknowledges that his downfall is linked to his *actions*.

* **Option A (""mema kriya piliwela hondin kriyathmaka we"" - ""our actions are linked to good/active deeds"")** best reflects this acknowledgment of responsibility and the consequences stemming from actions. The darkness links the downfall to the actions and says good deeds/violence are alike, which shows the consequences come from all deeds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mahajana aarakkshaa thahawuru kirima sandaha awashya piyawara ganimin sitee (""it is necessary to consider public safety and being a skilled marksman"")** - While true about the man's background, it doesn't explain the downfall.
* **C: abogayata muhuna deeme haekiyawa owunta aetha (""it is possible to defend oneself against accusations"")** - The passage doesn't focus on defending against accusations; it's about the consequences of actions.
* **D: siduwema barapathalaye apage kriyaa piluwe kriyaatmakayana bavata sahatikayi (""downfall is due to our actions, and in the realm of good deeds and violence, it is alike"")** - This is part of what the darkness said and isn't really an answer to the question of the consequence.

Therefore, **Option A** is the most accurate and relevant conclusion based on the passage."
hitapu UW shish‍yayan dedenek visin nirmanaya karana lada prawurththi hasakanukarana moolaash‍raya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: da kolbat ripot (The Colbert Report)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that The Colbert Report was a ""parody"" and a ""satirical publication"" that started in 1988. It further details how it evolved into a multi-platform media presence. The question asks about the ""root activity"" of building a satirical and parody-based news program. The Colbert Report is directly identified as that.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: chanda vid‍yalaya (private school)** - While Al Gore's private school experience is mentioned, it's only a detail about his life and doesn't represent the root activity of building a satirical news program.
* **C: da deli sho (The Daily Show)** - The Daily Show is mentioned as a program that John Stewart and Stephen Colbert worked on, but The Colbert Report is described as the initial satirical creation.
* **D: da aniyan (The Aniyan)** -  The passage mentions ""The Aniyan"" as a satirical and humorous kingdom created by Colbert, but the main platform *for* that satire was The Colbert Report.

"mema chedayata anuwa, da aniyan prawurththi hasakanukarana adhiraajyayata aethulath kara nomaeththe mewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: loka sithiyamak (World Citizen)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the news organization, in its early days, developed into a ""diyaniyan, sathya lesama puwath haasanukarana adhiraajyayak"" which translates to ""a world citizen, a truthful, humorous, and satirical empire.""  A ""world citizen"" is a broad term encompassing global awareness and connection, fitting the description of the organization's ambitious scope.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: chithrapatayak (Movie):** While they *might* have made movies eventually, the text doesn't mention it as a core element of their early or current activities.
* **C: web adaviyak (Website):** While they *have* a website, the text indicates their activities go *beyond* just a website - it's a much larger, multimedia empire.
* **D: mud‍ritha sanskaranayak (Printed publication):**  While they *might* have had printed publications, the text emphasizes the breadth of their digital and multimedia presence.

Therefore, ""loka sithiyamak"" (World Citizen) best captures the overall essence and ambitious nature of the news organization as described in the text.

The passage states: ""Hudek 11:00 ta pasu, virodhathaa daekvuvan waithol hi uthurata giya waahanawala gamanaagamanata baadha kalo ya."" This translates to ""After 11:00, the protesters blocked the movement of vehicles going towards Parliament.""  The ""pera"" (meaning ""after"" or ""later"") indicates that the blockage started *after* 11:00. However, the paragraph states that the protests *began* at 11:00. Therefore, the blockage of vehicle movement began at approximately 11:00.

This translates to: ""He is able to give many special insights; he wants to make a concise summary of the main points to be presented at the conference, and to evaluate the potential of the research related to this.""

* **This indicates:**  Professor Ehud Ur is evaluating the potential usefulness of the research to *present* at the conference. He wants to determine if the research is valuable *for the purpose* of presenting it and using it to inform decisions (like legal ones).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: meeta pera diyawaediyawa thiboo samahara meeyanta thawaduratath diyawaediyawa nomaetha:** While the professor has expertise, the passage doesn't specify he's presenting it *remotely*.  The focus is on the conference itself.
* **C: ohu mema soyagaeneem prathikarayakata maga penviya haeki bawa subhawadee we:**  The passage doesn't suggest the professor is *leading* the resistance. He's evaluating the research's potential impact.
* **D: samahara diyawaediyawa nothiboo meeyanta daen diyawaediyawa aetha:**  The opposite is true. He *does* want to make a concise summary (a ""samahara"") and assess the potential of the research.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that accurately reflects what the passage conveys about Professor Ehud Ur's evaluation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

Here's why:

The text states: ""Asaarthaka woo godabaesvimata hetu woo ayahapat kaalagunaya, seveem katayutu valatada baadha aethi kara thibe."" This translates to: ""Due to the unreasonable delay in rescue efforts, obstacles arose in the rescue operations.""

Option A directly reflects this, stating that the aircraft didn't land for a long period, which caused the delay and hindered rescue efforts.  The other options are not supported by the text.
"
CG4684 yaanaya godabaema awalangu kirimata hethuwa kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: godabaeme sthaanayata prawesha viya nohaeki viya** (because it did not enter the designated landing zone).

Here's why:

The passage states the Twin Otter aircraft deviated from its planned route and landed in an unauthorized area.  The police were then deployed to investigate the reason for this deviation and the aircraft's landing.  Option A directly reflects the reason for the investigation – the aircraft didn't land in the designated zone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: CG4684 yaanayata idiriyen thawath guvan yanaa kihipayak thibuni** (There was another aircraft approaching CG4684). The passage focuses on the deviation and unauthorized landing of the Twin Otter, not any other aircraft.
* **C: yaanaya kokodaa wetha naewatha harawa yawana ladee** (The aircraft was heading towards the coastline). While the aircraft did deviate, the passage doesn't state it was heading directly for the coastline. It landed in an unauthorized area within the larger deviation.
* **D: kalagunika thaththwaya ayahapath viya** (The time constraint expired). The passage mentions a time limit (ten minutes), but the primary reason for the investigation is the unauthorized landing, not simply the expired time.

This translates to: ""He tried hard to open the window because he wanted to get fresh air.  He was so determined that he made a racket.""
And then: ""He tried to open a window, and he felt like he was being watched by someone from below.""

Option C directly reflects this: ""He tried hard to open the window, and felt like he was being watched while trying to do so.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ohu janelayak binda daemeemata samath viya (He was able to open the window):**  The text says he *tried* to open the window, not that he succeeded.
*   **B: awasanaye ohu nirupad‍rithawa sitiyeya (He was in a hidden place in the house):** While there's a feeling of being watched, the text doesn't explicitly state he was *in* a hidden place. The feeling is more of being observed *while* he was trying to open the window.
*   **D: janelayak kaedeemata uthsaha karamin sitiyadee ohu thuwala laebeeya (If he tried to open the window, he got a reward):**  There's no mention of a reward. The motivation is to get fresh air and the feeling of being watched.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jaathika kunaatu madyasthaanaye vidyagnayan purokathanaya karana paridi badaadaa wana vita daniyel, kunatuvak dakva dakva prabala vanu aetha."" This translates to: ""Daniel, a prominent expert in national intermediate research, was a very strong advocate for the Kunaatuva.""

The question asks about the accusation against Daniel. The passage doesn't state he was accused of anything. Instead, it highlights his strong advocacy for the Kunaatuva. Therefore, option A, which reflects his advocacy, is the closest and most accurate inference we can make from the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: suli kunaatuve akhanda sulan pilibandawa vid‍yaagnayinta nishchitha naetha:** The passage doesn't mention any doubt about the existence of the Suli Kunaatuva.
*   **C: kunaatuva godabimata durin pawathee:** The passage doesn't provide any information about the Kunaatuva being away from the mainland.
*   **D: kunaatuva miyami sita boho durin pihita aetha:** The passage mentions the Kunaatuva being near Miami, not far away.

This translates to: ""Daniel, a leading hurricane forecaster at the national meteorological center, was increasingly worried about a storm. Due to the prevailing atmospheric conditions, the storm seemed destined to hit the Caribbean region.""

Therefore, Daniel was heading *towards* the storm and worried it would impact the Caribbean. Option C accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eya kaeribiyan doopath kerehi aethi karana balapaema nodanee (He didn't foresee the power of the storm hitting the Caribbean):** The passage explicitly states he was *worried* about the storm impacting the Caribbean.
*   **B: eya athlaanthik sagaraye nirmanaya viya (He built something in the Atlantic Ocean):** The passage doesn't mention him building anything.
*   **D: eka godabimata aasannawa pawathee (It was heading towards a nearby island):** While the storm *could* have been heading towards an island, the passage focuses on its potential impact on the Caribbean region, not specifically a nearby island.

Here's why:

The passage states that to prevent the spread of the H5N1 virus, it's crucial to **reduce close contact** between people.  It also mentions that the symptoms are mild and that infected individuals should avoid public places. This directly points to the need for measures that limit interactions with others.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya adu maraanthika bawata path viya yuthuya (It should be treated with a severe approach):** While the virus is serious, the passage emphasizes preventing spread *before* severe cases develop.  A severe approach isn't the primary preventative measure mentioned.
* **B: roga lakshana mrudu viya yuthuya (It should be treated with mild symptoms):** The passage doesn't suggest treating the symptoms as a preventative measure.
* **D: daruwanta roga lakshana aethi viya yuthuya (It should be treated with symptoms in children):** The passage doesn't specifically focus on children.  The preventative measure is about limiting contact for *everyone* potentially infected.



Therefore, limiting close contact with other people is the best preventative measure highlighted in the text.

"mema chedayata anuwa, suli kunaatuva fujiyan sita kopamana durakin thibuneda?","The correct answer is **D: kilo meetara 77**.

Here's why:

The question states that Agosthu's 9-day-long nighttime journey covered a distance of 77 kilometers. It then asks how much further he needs to travel to reach Fujian province.  Since he needs to travel a total of 110 kilometers and has already traveled 77 kilometers, he needs to travel 110 - 77 = 33 kilometers.  However, this isn't an option.

The question is likely meant to be interpreted as: ""How much further does he need to travel *to reach his destination* (Fujian province)?""

His destination is 110 kilometers away, and he's already traveled 77 kilometers. Therefore, he needs to travel 110 - 77 = 33 kilometers further. 

**There seems to be a discrepancy in the question or the provided options.** Assuming the 110km refers to the *total distance* to Fujian, then we can solve for the remaining distance: 110km - 77km = 33km. None of the options give 33km.

However, if we assume that the journey distance from the start point to where he has arrived *is* 77km and that Fujian is 110km from the start point and the distance the question is asking about is that needed to travel to Fujian, the answer would be: 110 - 77 = 33km. Since this isn't an option, and the options provided are very close to each other in value, there may be an error in the question.

However, if there's an error and the question refers to the *remaining* distance, and the 110km is a misstatement, option D (77) is the *closest* answer to what would represent the additional distance needed to travel to reach Fujian, given the initial context.

Given the options provided, and the lack of a clear explanation within the text, it's possible that the question is flawed. However, based on the numbers, **D: kilo meetara 77** is the most plausible, albeit imperfect, answer.

If we rephrase the question and interpret 77 as the remaining distance and 110 as the total distance to reach Fujian, the remaining distance would be 77. Since this isn't an option, there may be an error in the question or options.

If, however, we interpret 110 as total distance from the start and 77 as the distance traveled so far, the distance to be traveled is 110-77=33. **This isn't an option.**

**Since this is likely a flawed question, I cannot confidently choose an answer. But, if I MUST choose, based on closest distance traveled to Fujian, then D is the answer.**

**Final Answer: (D) kilo meetara 77**"

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Madya kaaleena maetivarana paraajayen satiyakata pasu, bush aasiyave velanda vyaaptiya pilibandava shraavakayanta paewasee ya."" This translates to ""After his mid-life environmental defeat, Bush started a pan-Asian voyage to spread the word about the battle against terrorism.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ohu singappooruwata paemini vita** (He went to Singapore): This is a part of the story, but doesn't explain *when* he started spreading the anti-terrorism message.
* **B: vong kan seng samaga** (Along with Lee Hsien Loong):  This mentions who he traveled with, not the context of *when* he started his campaign.
* **D: ohuge sathiyaka aasiyanu sanchaaraya atharathura** (His sincere Asian voyage started): While technically true, it doesn't pinpoint the *time* that prompted the voyage, the defeat was the key factor.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer because it directly references the event (mid-life environmental defeat) that initiated Bush's broader anti-terrorism campaign across Asia.

"mema chedayata anuwa, rajaye samastha ilakkaya wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: amathara maediri 1,300 k laba gaeneema.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the total revenue the kingdom earned from the sandaha (tax/revenue) this year?
* **The provided information states:** The kingdom collected 300k from the old tax and 1,300k from the new vehicles.
* **Therefore, the total revenue is 300k + 1,300k = 1,600k.**

However, the options provided don't include 1,600k.  Let's re-examine the question and options, focusing on what the question is *really* asking. The question is asking for the *total revenue* from the sandaha this year.

The sentence ""Senaga waedi weema ivath kirimata amathara 300 k ek kara mulu waahana sankhyava 1,300 k karayi."" translates to: ""By imposing a tax on new vehicles, the kingdom collected 300k this month, and the number of new vehicles is 1,300."" This implies the 300k is the new tax revenue this month.

The problem implies that the 1,300k represents the revenue from the new vehicles *this year*. It's not just the amount collected this month.

Therefore, the total revenue from the sandaha *this year* is 300k (from the old tax) + 1300k (from the new vehicles). This gives us 1,600k. However this option isn't presented.
Looking at the options again, we have to accept that there's a slight misunderstanding in how the question is phrased and how it is answered. Based on the options provided, the closest logical answer is **C: amathara maediri 1,300 k laba gaeneema.** This option reflects the revenue generated *this year* from the new vehicle tax, and is the most reasonable option given the choices.



**Important Note:**  There seems to be an error in the question or the provided options, as the correct calculation (300k + 1300k = 1600k) is not available as an answer.  We are having to make an educated choice based on the closest logical fit. If the option C was 1600k it would be the perfect answer.

* **The passage states:** ""Senaga waedi weema ivath kirimata amathara 300 k ek kara mulu waahana sankhyava 1,300 k karayi.""  This translates to ""To carry out the work, the initial capital of 300k was raised, and the number of vehicles was increased to 1,300.""
* **Option C directly reflects this statement:** It says 1,300 vehicles were purchased with the initial capital of 300k.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** This describes *how* the capital was raised, not what the request *asked for*.
* **B:** This talks about the ability to purchase vehicles, but the request was for the purchase itself.
* **D:** This talks about the potential for future expansion, but not the initial request.

"mema chedayata anuwa, dannaa thorathuru wanne monawada?","The correct answer is **A: tharjana mattama adu wee aetha** (only the index finger was slightly bent).

* **The question (Q) asks what the speaker said.** The speaker stated: ""Aeya paewasuwe, """"ikman prahaarayak apeksa karana bavata sithimata buddhi vaarthaa naetha yannayi. Kese vethath, tharjana mattama daedi lesa adu kireemen sampurna tharjanaya ma ivath woo bhava arthavat noveyi."""" This translates to something like: ""Listen, because of the desire to attack, I didn't have the wisdom to do it.  However, without fully bending the index finger, a slight bend in the index finger wouldn't be meaningful.""

* **Option A directly reflects the ""slight bend in the index finger"" mentioned at the end of the speaker's statement.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: thawaduratath tharjanayak nomaetha** (the index finger was straight): This is the opposite of what the speaker said.
* **C: prahaarayak apekshaa kere** (desired an attack): While true, this is only *part* of the speaker's statement.  The core of the statement is about the *degree* of the finger bending.
* **D: prahaaraya darunu wanu aethi bawata buddhi ansha thahawuru kara aetha** (the wisdom was obscured by the desire to attack): This is a longer, more general statement and not the specific detail the question asks for.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer.

* The text explicitly states: ""Ema komisama oktober maasaye dee paalakayinta viruddhava vyaaptava aethi woo virodhataavalata maartelige prathicharaya viya."" (This commission protested against the presidential actions in March of this year.) This directly addresses the question of what brought the opposition into the spotlight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kal giya maethivarana nisa virodhatha avuuwanu laebeeya** (The opposition has been emerging due to the last election) - While the last election might have contributed, the text focuses on the *current* protest of the commission.
* **C: virodhatha magin pera see. ee. pee. sabhawa illaa asviya yuthu bawa illaa sitina ladee** (The opposition's path is not clear, it's a chaotic situation) -  The text doesn't describe the opposition's path as unclear or chaotic. It simply states they protested.
* **D: virodhatha samahara vitaka prachandakaree viya** (The opposition's protest was highly intense) - While the protest *was* intense (""prachandakaree viya"" - highly intense), the question asks what *brought* the opposition into the spotlight, and the answer is the protest itself.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer to the question.

pera see. ee. pee. sabhawa illaa asviya yuthu yaeyi yojanaa kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: janaadhipath komisama**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Rata aluth maetivarana wetha genayaame kriyaamaarga pilibanda woo paekejayaka kotasak lesa, pasugiya maasaye janaadhipati komisamak visin hitapu cep ge illaa asweema nirdesha kaleya.""

This translates to: ""The country, in the last six months, issued a directive in the absence of a new budget regarding the implementation of a package by the Presidential Commission.""

Therefore, the Presidential Commission (janaadhipath komisama) is the one who issued the directive about the new budget package.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: martelli:** This refers to a particular type of social security system mentioned in the text, but it's not the one who issued the directive.
*   **B: virodhathakaruwan (opponents):** Opponents protested the directive, but they did not issue it.
*   **D: see. ee. pee. sabhawe saamaajikayin visinma meya yojanaa karana ladee (the Social Security System in the SEE.P. Parliament):** The text mentions the Social Security System in relation to past events (2011), but it isn't responsible for the current directive.

"mema prakaashayata anuwa, nasarge kreedaka kreedika apayojanayen pasuwa aemarika eksath janapadaye jimnaastik sahaya nodakwanne kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **B: balagathu parisarayak nirmanaya kirima (building a strong infrastructure)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Aemarika Eksath Janapadaye (American National Gymnastics) prioritizes building a protected environment for gymnasts to develop their skills and compete. It mentions the need for a strong infrastructure (saadhaniya saha savi bala gaenvu parisarayak - facilities and strong physical environment).  The passage emphasizes the importance of providing access to quality services and a bright future for gymnasts.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: sahathikaya naethi kirima (not promoting camaraderie):** The passage actually emphasizes the importance of unity and cooperation within the gymnastics community.
* **C: sanvidhaanaya thula awashya wenaskam (constitutional necessity):** While the passage mentions the constitution, it's not the primary focus of why gymnastic support is needed. The focus is on practical support for athletes.
* **D: swadheena vimarshanayak (independent criticism):**  Independent criticism is mentioned in the context of seeking help from experts, but it's not the core reason for building a strong gymnastics infrastructure.



Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the passage's main point is **B**."
"mema prakaashayata anuwa, aemarika eksath janapadaye jimnaastik saha eksath janapadaye olimpik kamituva yana deanshayema pradhaana ilakkaya wanuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: kreedaka kreedikawan sandaha aarakshitha parisarayak prawardhanaya kirima** (To develop a protected environment for athletes and sports).

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that the primary goal is to create a protected and supportive environment for athletes, ensuring they have access to good services and a bright future. It specifically mentions developing a protected environment for athletes, their families, and sports, including training, facilities, and resources.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: laeree nasarge apayojanaya helidaraw kirima** (To implement Larry Nasarge's plan): While Larry Nasarge's plan is mentioned, it's a *means* to achieve the primary goal, not the goal itself.
* **B: sahathikaya naethi kirimata katayuthu kirima** (To focus on media and public relations): Media and PR are tools that might be used to support the primary goal, but not the ultimate objective.
* **C: pawudgalika vimarshanayak sandaha katayuthu kirima** (To focus on public criticism):  The text aims to *reduce* public criticism and create a supportive environment, not focus on criticism itself.



"
anathura siduwana vita yaathrawa gaman karamin sitiye koheda? ,"The correct answer is **D: japaanaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Japaanaye naagasaakihi sasebohi pihita aetha."" This translates to ""Hidden in Nagasaki, Japan.""  Therefore, the location where the traveler went is Japan.



"

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Aevengar khaandaye bim bomba prathiprahaara yaatravak, yaatrava palavaan hi poto prinsesa wetha yamin tibina. Eya e.ja. naavika hamudaave hatveni naavika bala aeniyata pavara aethi athara, japaanaye naagasaakihi sasebohi pihita aetha."" 
* This translates to: ""In the Aevengar region, there is a bomber counter-strike traveler, a warrior and a princess are hidden.  She (the princess) is powerful in the navy and is capable of leading the navy.""

Therefore, option D accurately reflects information directly stated in the passage. The other options are either incomplete or don't capture the entirety of the information provided."
aemarikanu hamudawa pilibanda prakaashaya kale kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: donald t‍ramp**.

The text states: ""eksath janapadaye hamudaava siriyaaven ivath vena bhava ohuge maadhya lekam haraha prakaasha kaleya. **Tramp visin turkey janaadhipati rejap tayip erdogan samaga durakathana sanvaadayak paewaethweemen pasuwa nivedanaya nikuth karana ladi.**""

This translates to: ""Together with the common enemy, the medium editor has published a message. **Trump after a telephone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, made a statement.**""

Therefore, the question asks who published the message about the American's common enemy, and the text clearly indicates that Donald Trump did.
"
"mema prakaashayata anuwa, allaa gath satankaruwan aarakshaa kirime wagakeema bharagena aeththe kumana ratada?","The correct answer is **B: yuropaya**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Allaa gath aisis satankaruvange aarakshava turkiya da baara ganu aethi athara ema prakaashaya anuva yuropiya ratawal naewatha thama ratata genvaa gaeneema pratiksepa kara thibe.""  This translates to: ""According to this disclosure, the protection of Allah's enemies, Turkey, has been threatened, and European countries are also expected to be affected.""

Therefore, the European countries are the ones expected to be impacted by the potential consequences.
"
kadaa waeteemata hethuwa lesa vishwaasa karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: ayahapath kaalagunaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Ayahapath kaalagunaya saha katuka bhoomi pradaesha hamuve anaratura sidu woo sthaanaya soya sodhisi maehaeyum diyath karamin pawathee."" 

This translates to: ""...Due to the long period of time and the difficult terrain, the enemy was hesitant to attack the area.""

Therefore, the enemy's hesitation (lesa vishwaasa) is directly linked to the *ayahapath kaalagunaya* (long period of time).  The other options are mentioned as factors influencing the overall situation but aren't the *direct reason* for the enemy's hesitation.



"
anathura sidu wuye kumana aakaraye bhoomi pradeshayaka da?,"The correct answer is **D: kandukara**.

The text states: ""Kadaavaetima sidu vuyae **kandukara seemaawaehi** wana athara..."" which translates to ""After Kadaavaetima Siddu, he explored the **Kandukara border** and beyond..."". 

Therefore, Kandukara is the name of the border region that Siddu explored.
"
ganwathure prathiphalayak lesa niladhaareen apekshaa karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: waeli baemma yathaawath kirima (doing the work of a wild elephant)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Ganvaturin's reward is ""a small thing, a special thing lost, and a paralysis that results from the efforts."" It then mentions that to achieve this reward, he needs to ""do the work of a wild elephant - repeatedly carrying water from the river to the field.""

Therefore, option A directly reflects the passage's description of Ganvaturin's task and the desired outcome. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
wella idikirimata sthirawama balapaewe pahatha sandahan karunu atharin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: waelipara**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is being considered to establish a stable balance (sthirawama balapaewe pahatha sandahan).  The text states: ""Ganvaturin pasu adi kihipayak pamanak jala mattama ihala naenvunada, ganga pahala khaedanayata lak woo vaelipara yathaevath kirimata eya pramaenavat wei kiyae niladhearin apekshaa karathi.""

This translates to: ""The animal, after drinking water, and after reaching the bank of the Ganges, patiently waits for the wave to come and go.""

Therefore, the wave (waelipara) is the element the animal is waiting for and trying to balance itself against. The animal is relying on the wave's movement to maintain stability.

"mema chedayata anuwa, eksath janapadayata siduviya haeki prahaara gaena thorathuru laba dunne kawuda?","The correct answer is **C: anaawaranaya nokala moolaashrayak (a shelter that was a refugee camp)**.

Here's why:

The question asks *where* the bombing occurred. The text states: ""...Kenyaave nayrobiye pihiti eksath janapada thaanaapathi kaaryaalaya anaturu aengavimak nikuth kaleya. Ithiyopiyaavae saha kenyaaave """"pramukasthaana"""" pupuravaa haerimata maraaagena maerena bomkaruvan yodaa gannaa bavata anaavaranaya nokarana mulaashrayakin thorathuru laeb aethi bhava eksath janapadaya pawasai.""

Translation of the relevant part: ""...in Nairobi, Kenya, targeting the president's office.  The bombing, which targeted the ""highest positions"" of Ethiopia and Kenya, occurred at a refugee camp.""

Therefore, the bombing occurred at a refugee camp.
"

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""How many bomb attacks were carried out in two countries?""
* **The provided text states:** ""Somaaliyaavae anthavaadihu kenyaavae saha ithiyopiyaaave maraagaena maeraena bomba prahaara diyath kirimata saelasum karana bavata kenyaave nayrobiye pihiti eksath janapada thaanaapathi kaaryaalaya anaturu aengavimak nikuth kaleya.

* **Translation:** ""Somali terrorists have claimed responsibility for carrying out a series of bomb attacks in Kenya and Ethiopia, targeting the President's office in Nairobi.  In both Ethiopia and Kenya, bombs have been detonated targeting prominent locations, and shelters have been established for those affected.""

The text clearly indicates that bombs were detonated in *both* Kenya and Ethiopia, specifically targeting prominent locations within *both* countries. Therefore, the answer that reflects this is C.
"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Maakis treantafilopolas aelpha tivi hi siya Janapriya """"zounglaa"""" rupavaahini vaedasatahanaehi prakaashayata path kala torathuruvalin anaturuva..."" which translates to ""Makis Tryantafilopoulos, who is a well-known figure on the popular ""Zounglaa"" TV show on Alpha TV..."".  The question asks who is being investigated for unethical social practices and slander. The text directly links Makis Tryantafilopoulos to this investigation.
"
greeka neethi prajaawa thula sidu wu apakeerthiyehi kotasak lesa sandahan nowanne kumana kandaayamada?,"The correct answer is **B: vinisuruwarun (priests)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Greeka nithi prajaava athara daedi apakirthiyak godanaegi aetha. Sathi kihipayakata pera, maadhyavedi maakis treantafilopolas aelpha tivi hi siya Janapriya """"zounglaa"""" rupavaahini vaedasatahanaehi prakaashayata path kala torathuruvalin anaturuva, paetrose maentovvalas siya kaaryalayae saamaajikayan niti virodhi haa dushana katayutuvala niyaeli baevin nilaya athahaeriyae ya. Thavada, jyestha vinisuru evaangaelos kaalosis dushana saha pahath pelae charyaava sambandhayaen vaeradi bavata handunaagaeneemaen anathuruva bandhanaagaaragatha wee aetha.""

This translates to: ""The disgrace of the Greek ethical people was brought about by the priests.  Furthermore, the popular television channel ""Zounglaa"" broadcasted the  destruction of path kala (traditional arts), and the office of Petros Maentovvalas was involved in socially unethical and harmful actions.  Moreover, the senior priest Evangelos Kalosis was found to be related to corruption and immoral behavior, and was imprisoned.""

Therefore, the priests (vinisuruwarun) are directly identified as the cause of the disgrace.



"
indiyawata kadulu keeyak ahimi wunada?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

Here's how to solve this problem:

The question describes a scenario where Robin Uthappa scored 41 runs in 2 hours (from 11 am to 2 pm).  The question then states that Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid have a similar relationship to the number of runs.  It further indicates that India needs 7 more centuries (100+ runs) to reach a total of 36 centuries.

Therefore, the key is to understand that the number 7 represents the number of centuries India *needs* to reach a total of 36.

Let me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown!"
"mema chedayata anuwa, inime waedima lakunu pramaanaya wuye kumakda?","The question is a bit convoluted, but let's break it down.  It seems to be asking about a relationship between runs scored by Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid, and a related target score.

Here's the breakdown:

*   **Robin uthappaa, inimae ihalama lakunu labaagath athara eya, hathare paharaval 11 k ha hayae paharaval 2 k samaga pandu 41 ta lakunu 70 ki.**  This part describes a scenario where Robin scored a certain number of runs, and that total score is somehow related to the runs scored in two overs (11 + 2 = 13 overs) which resulted in a total of 41 runs, and a target of 70 runs.
*   **Maeda paela pithikaruvan woo sachin thendulkar saha raahul draavid ithaa hondin kreedaa kala athara lakunu siyayaka sambandhataavak pavatvaa gathha.** This translates to ""The first player's score has a relationship with the total runs scored by Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in a good game."" It implies Sachin and Dravid have a significance to the calculation.
*   **Enamuth, naayakayaage kadulla daewee yaamath samaga indiyaavata inima avasaanayaedi labagatha haeki vuye kadulu 7 kata lakunu 36 ki.** This translates to ""Therefore, the target that India needs to achieve in the remaining innings to win the match is 7 runs and 36 runs."" This seems like a typo, but it most likely means the target is 736 runs.

The question then asks: **mema chedayata anuwa, inime waedima lakunu pramaanaya wuye kumakda?** This translates to ""According to this, what is the next score?""

The question is essentially asking what the target score *is*. Based on the text, the target is mentioned as 736 runs. However, this isn't directly one of the answers. The answer is likely intended to be derived from the relationship described in the first part of the sentence. Given the relationship between the runs scored in 13 overs (41) and the target (70), and the inclusion of Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid in the relationship, and taking into consideration the typo in the target score, it is very likely the question is pointing at the answer **736**.
However, 736 is not an option. Thus, **70** is a better answer given the wording. This is the target of the first part of the sentence.

Therefore, the answer is 70.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{70}$"
aedam kiyurdange kalakirimata hethuwak nowanne pahatha sandahan karunuwalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: lingika anthargathaya pilibanda web adaviye nawa prathipaththiya (the new controversy regarding sexual orientation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Prajaavae kopaya, vivurta balapathralaabhi maadhya miliyana gananakata sathkaarakatvaya sapayana adaviyae lingika anthargathaya sambandhava pratipattiyak ketumpath kirimata aethi vathman vyaayaamayanta haethu viya.""  This translates to: ""The people's anger, through the media's significant amplification, is due to the current attempt to investigate the controversy regarding sexual orientation.""

* **Option A directly reflects this statement.**  The passage clearly links the controversy and the new investigation to sexual orientation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wels visin kalaa krutheen maka daemeema (Welsh's contribution to the macadam):** While Welsh is mentioned, the passage doesn't attribute the controversy to his work *directly*. It links it to the broader issue of sexual orientation.

* **C: welsaya aehumkan nodeema (Welsh not being able to be empowered):**  The passage doesn't state that Welsh is *unable* to be empowered. It focuses on the controversy itself.

* **D: kalaa krutheen makadaemeemata hethuwa pilibanda wu boru (The truth about why the contribution to the macadam was made):**  The passage doesn't delve into the reasons behind Welsh's contribution. It's concerned with a separate, related controversy.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, web adaviyen maka damanu laebuwe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: kalaa krutheen (artwork)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""devanuva, ohu apata aehumkan dene bhava mavaa pamin, ohuge kalaa kruthi makaademima dakvaa.""  This translates to: ""The deity, he will grant us the chance to see his artwork, the macadam.""  The passage implies the macadam (the road) is considered a work of art.
* **Option A (kalaa krutheen) directly translates to ""artwork.""** This aligns perfectly with the passage's description.
* **The other options are not supported by the passage:**
    * **B: lingika anthargathaya (sexual intercourse):**  This is mentioned as a potential source of public anger but not what the passage refers to as the ""artwork.""
    * **C: prathipaththi ketumpathak (asking for a rebuttal):** This refers to a political tactic and is not the artwork.
    * **D: pudgalika-himikarithwaya himi madhya (a type of substance):** This is a completely unrelated concept.



Therefore, **A: kalaa krutheen** is the most accurate answer based on the given passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, ameer khaan sahaya nodakwanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: olimpik sandaha kantha satankaruwan aethulath kirima** (Olympic-related activities involving the throat).

Here's why:

The original Sinhala text states: ""Kaantha nilayan aethulath kirimata siyallanma sahaya nodaekvi ya."" This translates to something like ""He was unable to help with activities involving the throat (or vocal cords)."" The rest of the text then discusses Amir Khan's Olympic achievements and his support for British athletes.  

Therefore, the question asks *why* Amir Khan couldn't help with Olympic-related activities involving the throat. The text directly states he was unable to assist with those specific activities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: brithan‍ya tharagakaruwan** (British athletes): While he *did* help British athletes, the core issue discussed is his inability to help with throat-related activities.
* **C: kaanthavange mathaya** (Kaantha's health):  This is irrelevant to the passage.
* **D: olimpik sandaha landan sathkarakathwaya laba deema** (Receiving recognition at the London Olympics): This describes *what* he achieved, not *why* he couldn't help with throat activities.

* **The provided text says:** ""...hu prakaasha kalaeya. Thama adahas kese vuvada **2012 london hi pawathwena olympic ulalae** brithaanya tharagakaruvanta sahaya dakwana bhava..."" (He achieved fame. He helped the British achieve a medal in the **2012 London Olympics**...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kantha satankaruwan (Necklace/Collar):** This is completely unrelated to the question. The text mentions a necklace/collar, but it doesn't provide any context related to the Olympics.
* **B: 2004 olimpik ulele sesu tharagakaruwan (All the medalists of the 2004 Olympics):** The text specifically mentions the 2012 London Olympics.
* **D: anekuth ridee padakkamlaabheen (Many medal winners):** While Ameer Khan is a medal winner, the question is about *which* Olympics he helped the British achieve a medal in.



"
peetar lens miya giye kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: rohale dee**.

Here's the breakdown:

The text states: ""lens ohugae yathuru paediyaen vaetunu athara, sahodara tharagakaru eksaeviyar ge gaeti anaturata luck viya. Dhaawana pathaye vaidya kaarya mandalaya visin vahaama ohuta prathikara kara ohu praadeshiya rohalakata raegena giya athara pasuwa ohu ehidee miya giyae ya.""

This translates to: ""The lens was damaged and fell off. After resisting the attempts of fellow racers, he crashed into a local ravine and then fell into it.""

Therefore, the lens fell *into the ravine* (rohale dee).
"
seviyar sayat yanu kawuda?,"The correct answer is **A: dhaawana pathaye vaid‍ya karya mandalaya (the racetrack medical staff)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dhaawana pathaye vaidya kaarya mandalaya visin vahaama ohuta prathikara kara..."" which translates to ""He [the injured driver] was taken by the racetrack medical staff..."" 

Therefore, the racetrack medical staff (dhaawana pathaye vaidya karya mandalaya) is the entity that took the injured driver.

Here's why:

* **The Passage (P)** describes the fear a peacock experiences when its train is ruffled. It highlights the peacock's shame and its inability to act normally when this happens. It mentions that the peacock is afraid of things it doesn't understand and that understanding the mechanics of the train and how it's affected would help alleviate this fear.

* **Question (Q)** asks what underlying principle explains the peacock's internal reaction to its train being ruffled.

* **Option B** directly addresses this by stating that the peacock's reaction is due to a feeling of shame triggered by the disruption of its beautiful train, and a related fear of the unknown. This aligns perfectly with the passage's description of the peacock's emotional response.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** The passage doesn't say the peacock is ashamed *of* its train. It's ashamed when it's *ruffled*.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention the flow or mechanics of anything other than the train.
* **D:** While the passage mentions fear of the unknown, it's not specifically about the train's movement causing a shudder. The primary emotion is shame and the resulting fear.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, mila kerehi awadhaanaya yomu karana sanchaarakayeku awadhaaranaya kala yuththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: bahu sanchaaraka sewaawan athara mila sansandanaya karanna (Compare prices across multiple mobile network operators)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""To find the best deal, what steps should a consumer take regarding the price and benefits of mobile services?""
* **The provided text mentions:** Comparing different mobile network operators to find the most suitable service.
* **Option C directly reflects this advice:**  It suggests comparing prices across multiple operators, which is the core of finding the ""best deal.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: bahu sanchaaraka sewaawan visin laba denu labana pirinaemeem soyanna (Look for promotional offers from multiple mobile network operators):**  While promotional offers are part of the equation, the question is broader than just deals. It's about overall price and benefits.
* **B: guvan sewaawa samaga rijuwama wen karawa ganna (Subscribe to a mobile service along with other services):** This is a specific tactic and not the general advice for finding the best mobile service.
* **D: guvan sewaawe web adaviya pareekshaa karanna (Test the mobile service's web speed):**  Web speed is *one* benefit, but the question asks about price *and* benefits.  Testing speed alone doesn't address the price aspect.



Therefore, **C** is the most comprehensive and accurate answer based on the given text and question."
"mema chedayata anuwa, haeki hondama prawesha pathra milak laba gaeneema sandaha sanchaarakayeku palamuwa kala yuththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: vividha sanyukthayan athara mila sansandanaya karanna (Research on various combinations)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks how to get a good admission letter.** The original text describes the process of using online government services to check admission prospects.
* **Option B directly addresses the core of finding the best admission prospects.** ""Researching various combinations"" implies exploring different educational paths, institutions, or programs to identify the best fit. This is a logical step *before* applying through online services.
* **Option A (guvan sewaawe web adaviya pareekshaa karanna - Check government service online examination)** is *part* of the process, but not the most effective *first* step. You need to know *what* to look for before you can check.
* **Options C and D** are too broad and don't specifically address the question of getting a *good* admission letter. They suggest performing all available government services or tasks assigned by a counselor, which isn't necessarily the most efficient strategy.

Therefore, researching different combinations of options is the most logical and effective way to improve your chances of getting a good admission letter."
bhaanda gena yamak samaga ekata yamata keneku awashya wanne kawada da?,"The correct answer is **B: samaagama thamangema guvan yaanayak bhaavitha karana vita**

Here's why:

* **The first passage (P)** discusses the importance of understanding customer needs and traffic patterns for successful business planning.  It emphasizes how knowing where customers are coming from, their routes, and their travel habits is crucial for effective business operations and service delivery.

* **The second question (Q)** asks what's necessary to understand customer needs regarding their travel.

* **Option B** directly aligns with the core message of passage P. Understanding the customer's travel patterns *influences* the business's service.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: bhaanda guvan prawaahanaya haraha yawana vita (When the vehicle traffic is heavy):**  While traffic is a factor, the passage is about *understanding* travel patterns in general, not specifically *heavy* traffic.
* **C: pareekshaa karana lada gaman malu lesa dewal yawana vita (When conducting a test of short travel):** This focuses on testing, not on understanding the everyday travel of customers.
* **D: bhaanda gena yama vishaala samaagamak visin hasuruwana vita (When a large customer base is involved in the vehicle):**  A large customer base is important, but the core concern is *understanding the travel* of those customers.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and relevant answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, sandhaanayaka nithara piyasara karana guvan sewayak thoraa gaeneemedee oba pramukhathawaya laba diya yuththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: waedima lakunu laba dena guvan sewaya (a guvan service that provides healing powers)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what is the most important thing one gains from a continuous, dedicated guvan service. The passage emphasizes the *spiritual* benefits: selfless dedication, purification, and ultimately, a connection to a higher power.  

While options B, C, and D might be *aspects* of a guvan service, they aren't the core, most important gain. The passage focuses on spiritual growth and inner transformation, which aligns best with the idea of **healing powers** (waedima lakunu laba dena) derived from the service. This healing isn't just physical; it's spiritual and emotional as well.

Therefore, option A best encapsulates the ultimate benefit described in the passage.

"mema chedayata anuwa, niranthara piyasara lakunu laba diya haekke katada?","The correct answer is **B: ekama sandhaanaya yatathe oba nithara gaman karana guvan sewaya**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks when continuous love/devotion is achieved.
* **The passage (P)** states that achieving continuous love/devotion requires a single, unwavering dedication to the service of the deity.  It emphasizes *one* path (ekama sandhaanaya) of constant devotion (niranthara piyaasara) to the deity.
* Option B accurately reflects this by saying that achieving continuous love/devotion happens *through a single path* (ekama sandhaanaya) where one *continuously travels* (nithara gaman karana) towards the deity's service (guvan sewaya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:**  While the passage mentions a ""sandhaanaya"" (path/method), it doesn't specify that the deity's servant *is* the path.  The path is dedicated to the deity's service.
* **C:** The passage doesn't suggest actively *fighting* for the deity's service.  It speaks of unwavering dedication.
* **D:**  The passage stresses a *single* path, not a *multiple* or a *large* one.

"mema chedayata anuwa, adhika lesa mathpaen paanaya kirimen pahatha sandahan ind‍riya walin durwala viya haekke kumana ind‍riya da?","The correct answer is **C: rasa (taste)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that excessive alcohol consumption can damage the nervous system.  Loss of smell (suwanda) and hearing (peneema) are common consequences of alcohol abuse, but **taste (rasa)** is also significantly affected.  The passage doesn't explicitly mention these other senses, but taste is directly linked to the nervous system and is a well-known effect of excessive alcohol.

Therefore, **rasa (taste)** is the most logical and direct consequence mentioned in the context of nerve damage from excessive drinking.
"
"mema chedaye sandahan wana paridi, mathpaen wala hanikara balapaem awama kala haekke kumak magin da?","The correct answer is **A: methanol sahitha mathpaen paanaya kirima (Drinking alcohol with methanol)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Niti virodhiva saekasu sprithuvala methanol aetulu vividha bhayaanaka apavitra drawya adangu viya haeki athara, evaye kudaa maathraavakin pava anda bhavaya menma maranaya pava sidu viya haekiya."" (Unscrupulous spirits sometimes contain dangerous impurities like methanol, which can cause blindness or death even in small amounts.)

The other options are less specific and not directly supported by the passage's warning about the dangers of alcohol. While the other options might be harmful, the passage specifically highlights the danger of methanol.
"
aemstardaem hi ihalama depala watinaakamak aeththe koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: Aela disthrikkaya**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Amsterdam hi ihalama depala watinaakamak aeththe koheda?"" which translates to ""Where is the historic site of Amsterdam's canals?"".
* **The passage states:** ""Aela distrikkaya (landesi basin: graechengordel) yanu amsterdaem hi binanstaed vatakara aethi..."" This translates to ""The Aela district (landesi basin: Greek belt) is located alongside Amsterdam's canals...""
* **Therefore, the location of Amsterdam's canals' historic site is within the Aela district.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: yuneskowa visin loka uruma bhoomiyak lesa nam karana lada onaema sthaanayak** - ""A place that is a UNESCO world heritage site."" While the Aela district *is* a UNESCO site, the question asks for the *location* of the canals.
* **C: binenstaed wethin iwath karana lada pradesha** - ""Within the area surrounding Amsterdam."" This is too general.
* **D: ayithihaasika watinaakamak sahitha sthaana** - ""A place with historical sites."" This is also too general.

Therefore, the most specific and accurate answer is **A: Aela disthrikkaya**."
aela disthrikkaya yuneskowa visin loka uruma bhoomiyak lesa nam kara aeththe aeyi?,"The correct answer is **A: ehi ayithihaasika ha sanskruthika watinaakama** (It is a historical and cultural heritage).

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Ehi aethi suvisesi sanskruthika saha ayitihaasika agaya hetuven sampurna distrikkayama yunesko loka uruma bhumiyak lesa nam kara aethi athara ehi depala vatinaakama rate ihalama agayan athara wei.""  This translates to: ""Due to its very special cultural and historical heritage, the entire district has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage site.""

Option A directly reflects this information by identifying the reason for the UNESCO designation as historical and cultural heritage.  The other options are not explicitly mentioned or are less accurate interpretations of the provided text.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nom krom wetha yamata watinaakam denne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: tonle saepge darshanaya (The view of Tonle Sap)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Devamaaligave anduru waathaawaranaya saha tonley saep vilata ihalin penena darshanaya, kanda naegimata vatinaakamak labaa dei."" (The view of the surrounding area of the temple and the view of Tonle Sap Lake from the hill provides a pleasant experience.)
* **The question asks:** ""mema chedayata anuwa, nom krom wetha yamata watinaakam denne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?"" (According to this passage, what is the reason for visiting this place?)  This is asking *why* someone would visit.
* **Therefore, the passage explicitly identifies the view of Tonle Sap Lake as a primary reason to visit.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aengkor paas harahaa gaman kirima (Visiting Angkor Pass):** While visiting Angkor is related, the passage doesn't directly say Angkor Pass is the *reason* to visit *this specific place* (the temple).
* **C: siyam reeyapi daekeema (Seeing the Cambodian culture):** This is a general reason to visit Cambodia, but the passage doesn't prioritize cultural observation as the reason for visiting *this temple*.
* **D: vilata yana bottu chaarikawa (Bottu transportation to the lake):**  Bottu transportation is a *means* to get to the lake, not the *reason* to visit.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nom krom wetha aethulu weemata amuththanta awashya wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: tonle saep wataa bottu paedeema (to fill bottles with Tonle Sap water)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""mema pradeshaya wetha yana sanchaarayata vila wetha bottu sanchaarayak pahasuven ma ekkara gatha haeka.""  This translates to ""For the traffic going to my province, I need to find a way to fill bottles with water.""  The context is about providing water for travelers.

Option D directly reflects this need. The other options are not mentioned or relevant to the passage.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, aentaktikawa naerabimen sanchaarakayin walakwanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: seemitha bhawthika sanchalathawa (limited physical accessibility)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Antarctica as a remote and difficult place to access. It mentions:

* **""Pruthuwiye sheetala adhikama sthaanaya wanne aentaaktikavayi, eya dakshina draevaya vataa pihitayi.""** (Antarctica is the coldest place on Earth, located in the southern pole.) This establishes the remoteness.
* **""Sanchaaraka gaman biman mila adhika wana athara...""** (Access by transport aircraft is limited...) This directly points to limited accessibility.
* **""...gimhanaye dee mehi waasaya karana dahas gananaka karya mandalaya boho durata raendi sitinne ema pradeshawala pihiti dusim 4 kandavuruvalaya; enam sheeta kaalayata naewathee sitina kudaa sankhyaavaka nawaathaenpalawalaya.""** (...many computer scientists living in this region are located in 4 settlements, with a small number remaining during the winter.) This highlights the difficulty of staying and working there.
* **""Abyantara aentaaktikava ki.mee. 2-3 ka pamana ayisvalin aawaranaya woo hudekala saanuvaki.""** (The interior of Antarctica is covered by an ice sheet 2-3 kilometers thick.) This emphasizes the physical barrier.

Options A, B, and C don't accurately reflect the primary challenge mentioned in the passage. While researchers might be searching for the Ross Sea (option B) or there might be transport during December and January (option C), the overarching difficulty is the **limited physical accessibility** due to its remoteness and ice sheet.



"
kandu naegeemata unanduwak dakwana sanchaarakayeku aentaktikawe kumana pradeshayata sanchaaraya kala haekida?,"The correct answer is **B: abhyanthara pradesha (interior region)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Abyantara aentaaktikava ki.mee. 2-3 ka pamana ayisvalin aawaranaya woo hudekala saanuvaki. Indahita visheshagna guvan chaarika abyantarayata, kandu naegimata ho vishaala kandavurak aethi draevayata lagaa we.""

This translates to: ""The interior Antarctic is covered by an ice sheet of 2-3 km thickness.  The interior, with its vast ice sheet, is inaccessible to most experts.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly says that the interior region of Antarctica is inaccessible.  The other options are geographical features *on* the Antarctic coast, which are accessible to those traveling by ship.
"

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Eva godanaganu laebuwe nuthana evata vadaa pahasuven langaaviya haeki nagara ho mandapavalaya."" This translates to: ""That new 'eva' (likely referring to a new institution/center) which was received as a gift on Godan (a festival) should be approached to the mandapavala (assembly hall) **by entering from the front gate**.""

Therefore, the correct answer is the one that reflects this information. Option A accurately describes this. The other options are not supported by the text.
"
naweena paryeshana durekshayak sthaanagatha kala haekke kothaenada?,"The correct answer is **B: vishwa vid‍yaala mandapayaka (school auditorium)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...eva godanaganu laebuwe nuthana evata vadaa pahasuven langaaviya haeki nagara ho mandapavalaya."" This translates to ""...the new excursion should be held in the city's auditorium."" 
* ""Mandapavalaya"" directly means auditorium or hall.
* Option B, ""vishwa vid‍yaala mandapayaka,"" translates to school auditorium, which aligns perfectly with the passage's description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kauthukagarayaka (amusement park):** The passage doesn't mention an amusement park.
* **C: adhyaapana sthaanayaka (teaching place):** While related to education, the passage specifies a larger venue than just a classroom.
* **D: vishaala parish‍rayaka (vast resort):** The passage mentions a ""vast resort"" as a location, but it's used in the context of a distant region and doesn't fit the context of a school excursion being planned.

"mema chedayata anuwa, nihanda werala dinayak sandaha wadaath sudusu wanne kumana pradeshayada?","The correct answer is **C: uthuru waraaya disthrikkaya (Uthuru Waraaya District)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uthuru muhudu tiraye verala (uthuru varaaya distrikkaye) paesific saagaraye pihita aethi athara uthure long be sita dakune devonpot dakvaa vihide.""  This translates to: ""The northern coast (in the Uthuru Waraaya district) is hidden where the Pacific Ocean meets the northern shore.""

The question asks where the land is located. The passage explicitly identifies the location as the Uthuru Waraaya district.  The other options are places within the district (Sentheliyars, Mishan Be, Wayitemata Waraaya) or related terms, but not the overall district itself.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, pihinum thathwayan wadaath aarakshitha viya haekke kothaenada?","The correct answer is **B: uthuru waraaya disthrikkaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Uthuru muhudu tiraye verala (uthuru varaaya distrikkaye) paesific saagaraye pihita aethi athara uthure long be sita dakune devonpot dakvaa vihide."" This translates to: ""The northern coast (in the Northern Waray District) is hidden behind the Pacific Ocean and has long beaches..."" 

The question asks *where* the protected area is located. The passage explicitly states it is in the Northern Waray District.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: devonpot:** Devonpot is mentioned as a specific place where the waves crash, not the location of the protected area itself.
* **C: madhyama okland:**  The passage mentions a ""mid-city Oakland"" and a ""sentheliars milaadhika alevipala upanagaraye"" (a development in Oakland), but not that the protected area is in that part of Oakland.
* **D: long be:** ""Long be"" refers to the long beaches, not the area where they are located.



"
mema chedaye visthara kara aethi sthaanayata piviseeme dee nusudusu yaeyi saelakenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: adaviya wata kothaenaka ho salakunak thaebeema** (Creating a dam on the forest water source).

Here's why:

The question in Q asks how to expand the area of the place by blocking the water source to the surrounding forest.

The passage in P mentions several actions, but the one that directly addresses expanding the area by blocking a water source is implied in the desire to ""samula ghaatanaya ho naaseen pilibanda vihilu nokaranna"" (prevent the destruction of the root system related to the water source).  Blocking the water source would indirectly lead to the destruction of the forest's root system and, by extension, allow for expansion of the area.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: sansunwa haesireema** (Construction of roads): While roads can expand an area, the question specifically asks about *blocking a water source*.
*   **C: vihilu kirima** (Deforestation): Deforestation is the act of cutting down trees, not blocking a water source.
*   **D: vyuhayak matha kurutu gaema** (Using a strategy against the enemy): This refers to a strategic military approach and is not relevant to expanding an area by controlling water sources.



Therefore, blocking the water source to the surrounding forest is the most logical action to expand the area. This aligns with the implication in P to protect the water source's root system to prevent destruction.



"
podu bhaashawan visthara karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: kruthima**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kruthima ho nirmana kala bhaasha wei."" This directly translates to ""...it is an artificially constructed language.""
* **The passage also contrasts it with:** ""...svabhaavika ho mulika bhaasha wana, podu bhashavangen evaa venas we."" This means ""...natural mother tongue, we don't need a colloquial language."" The artificial language is meant to avoid the problems associated with natural, evolving languages.

Therefore, ""kruthima"" (artificial) is the word that best describes the language being discussed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aswabhavika (unnatural):** While artificial languages *are* unnatural in origin, ""kruthima"" is a more precise term.
* **C: godanaga gath (inherited/ancestral):** This refers to languages passed down through generations, which is the opposite of an artificial language.
* **D: moolika (original/native):** This refers to a native language, which the passage seems to be positioning as needing to be avoided in favor of the artificial language.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Upakaaraka Bhasha as a constructed language designed for expressing requests and information to people who don't understand the speaker's native language.**  Option C directly reflects this purpose:  ""This is a constructed language designed for expressing the state of requesting or conveying information.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ewa wenath aakarayakin ekineka therum nogannaa pudgalayin athara sanniwedanaya pahasu kirima sandaha bhaavitha karana moolika bhaashawan we** - This option is too verbose and doesn't capture the core concept of a constructed language. It focuses on the native language's inadequacy rather than the language's purpose.
* **B: ewa swabhavika ha godanagagath bhaasha we** - This is incorrect. The passage explicitly states it's a *constructed* language, not a natural or evolved one.
* **D: ewa vividha bhaasha katha karannan athara prachalitha godanagana lada bhaashawan we** - This suggests it's a common language for telling stories in different languages. This doesn't align with the primary purpose of Upakaaraka Bhasha described in the passage.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and comprehensive description of Upakaaraka Bhasha based on the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, magiyeku owunge yathrawe gamana sheetha irthuwe nam pareekshaa kala yuththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: kutiye pihiteema**

Here's why:

* **The original text:**  The question is asking about a check of ""kutiyepihitima"" (internal components/details).  It explicitly mentions a check of internal components during a cold weather test.
* **The question in Sinhala:** The Sinhala question translates to ""According to my information, what should I do to test the internal components when the weather is cold?""
* **The options:**
    * **A: kutiye pihiteema (internal components):** This directly refers to the part of the system being tested.
    * **B: visaa awashyatha (necessary visa):**  This is irrelevant to the testing process.
    * **C: niyamayan (regulation/normative):** While a test might be regulated, the question is about *what* to test, not the regulations.
    * **D: nagaraye gatha kala kalaya (the time when the city was taken):** This is completely unrelated to the context.

Therefore, the most logical and accurate answer is **A: kutiye pihiteema**.
"
"mema lipiyata anuwa, magiyekuge yathrawe gamana gimhanaye nam, owun walakwa gatha yuthu de kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: ayis haraha gaman kirima**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Sheeta's journey and emphasizes the ""ayis haraha gaman kirimedi"" (traveling by ice boat).** This phrase is a key part of the narrative and directly relates to the question about the method of her travel.
* The passage mentions Santa Petersberg as the destination (""Santa peetersberg hi magee nauka nagarayehi kaalaya gatha karayi""), not where the travel takes place.
* The passage mentions visa, but says it isn't necessary (""naewehi mageenta visaa awashya nove"").
* ""Nagaraye welaawa"" (city market) is not mentioned in the context of Sheeta's travels.

Therefore, the question asks about the method of her travel, which is clearly stated as ""ayis haraha gaman kirimedi.""

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nagaraye nitya nivedana kaetalan bhaashaaven nikuth karanu labana namuth saelasum nokarana lada baadha kireem, spaangna, ingrisi, pransha, araabi saha japan aetulu bhaasha gananavakin svayankreeya paddhatiyak haraha nivedanaya kere."" This translates to: ""Although it is possible to obtain daily services in Catalan, there is no obstacle to obtaining services in Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese through a computerised automatic system.""

* **Option D directly reflects this point:** It mentions that Catalan is used for communication in many places, including metro lines and other public transportation, and that computerized systems are available for other languages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya spaangnga bhaashawata wadaa pulul lesa therum gatha haekiya:** This translates to ""it was possible to communicate in Spanish to a lesser extent."" While Spanish *is* available, the passage emphasizes the availability of *other* languages too, and doesn't say Spanish was the primary language used for communication.
* **B: eya nagaraye palamu nila bhaashawa viya:** This translates to ""it is the official language of the city."" The passage doesn't explicitly state that Catalan is the official language.
* **C: basilonaa we wadaath kaemathi bhaashawa meyayi:** This translates to ""Catalan is the language spoken in Barcelona."" While Catalan *is* spoken in Barcelona, the passage highlights the multilingual nature of the city and the availability of other languages for services.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately summarizes the information presented in the passage."
barsilonaa mett‍ro paddhathiya nithya niwedana prakaashayata path kirima sandaha pahatha sandahan bhaasha atharin bhaavitha karanne kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: spaangnga**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...Nagaraye nitya nivedana kaetalan bhaashaaven nikuth karanu labana namuth saelasum nokarana lada baadha kireem, spaangna, ingrisi, pransha, araabi saha japan aetulu bhaasha gananavakin svayankreeya paddhatiyak haraha nivedanaya kere.""

This translates to: ""...Although it's possible to get daily announcements in Catalan, to avoid any difficulty, a fully automatic system was developed to provide announcements in Catalan, English, French, Arabic and Japanese.""

The sentence explicitly mentions that announcements are provided in Catalan, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.  The question asks which language is *affected* by the metro announcement system. The text specifically lists **spaangna (Spanish)** as one of the languages included in the automatic system.

Therefore, the answer is **C: spaangnga**.

"mema chedayata anuwa, supiri aendan saha udaesana aaharaya sandaha pramukhathawaya laba deemata ida nomaeththe pahatha sandahan pahasukam atharin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: advitheeya pawuraanika lee badu (unique ancient recipes)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the unique and historical aspect of the cuisine.** It mentions ""pauranika aendak soya gaeneeme haekiyaawa thibe"" (ancient recipes that can be found in ancient texts) and specific dishes like ""sumata polava saha pihinum thataakayak"" (a special polava and cinnamon rice) which are described as historical recipes.
* **The question asks what the cuisine is particularly known for.** The text explicitly states that ancient recipes are a significant characteristic.
* **Other options are less directly supported:**
    * **A: visheshanga menu ayithamayan (special menu options):** While the cuisine *has* special dishes, the text doesn't highlight the variety of menu options as its primary feature.
    * **C: hondin nadaththu karana lada elimahan awakaashayan (good opportunities to conduct business):** The text mentions business opportunities *related* to the cuisine, but it isn't the cuisine's defining feature.
    * **D: wegawath wayifayi (delicious taste):** While delicious taste is generally expected, the text focuses more on the historical and unique aspect rather than just the taste.



Therefore, the **unique ancient recipes** are the most prominent feature of this cuisine according to the provided text.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes seasonal foods:** The passage repeatedly mentions the importance of ""udaesana aahara"" (seasonal food) and its nutritional benefits. It highlights that seasonal foods are rich in various nutrients and are a special type of food.  The example of polava and thinakaya during the dry season further supports this.

* **Option B directly reflects this emphasis:**  ""Irthumaya aahara paraasayak pirinaemeema"" translates to ""Incorporation of seasonal foods,"" which aligns perfectly with the core message of the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: samakaleena alankaranaya (Contemporary decoration):** While decoration might be present, it's not the central focus of the passage.
* **C: supiri aendan (Spicy foods):**  The passage mentions ""supiri aendan"" as a general category, but it's not presented as the *primary* reason for the popularity of ""wadaath sukhopabhogi"" and ""udaesana aahara.""
* **D: desheeyawa labagath aahara saha beema (Locally available food and tradition):**  While local availability and tradition play a role, the passage specifically highlights the *seasonal* aspect as crucial.

The text states: ""Anekuth skeeyin isav bijing sita kilometer 220 k (saethapum 140 k) durin pihiti shaenjiyako hi thayisicheng skee pradeshayedhi paewaethwey."" This translates to: ""Many skiing events were held in the Thayicheng Ski Region, 220 kilometers (approximately 140 miles) from Beijing.""

The question asks where the events were held.  Option B directly corresponds to this information. The other options mention the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and the grand final, which are events *held in Beijing*, not the location of the skiing events themselves.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, 2022 dee beejin visin sathkarakathwaya daranu labanne pahatha sandahan dae athurin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: samaapthi uthsawa**.

The text states: ""Beijing aarambhaka saha samaapthi uthsava..."" which translates to ""Beijing's opening and closing ceremonies..."".  It specifically mentions the closing ceremony as something for which medalists were honored.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: gimhana olimpik (Gimhana Olympic):** While the Olympics occurred in Beijing, the text doesn't explicitly state that the medalists were honored *at the gym/arena* specifically, but rather during the ceremonies.
* **B: gruhasthawa sidu kerena ayis isaw (Gruhasthawa Sidu Kerena Ayis Isaw):** This translates to ""housing with good ice/snow"". This is irrelevant to the medalists being honored.
* **C: sheetha olimpik (Sheetha Olympic):** This means ""Winter Olympics"".  The text mentions the Winter Olympics in general, but it points to the *ceremonies* as the place where the medalists were honored.



"
kurulu influvensa waelandeeme waedima avadaanamak aeththe katada?,"The correct answer is **A: paksheen narambannan (birds' nesting)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Boho eva kukulu ganaye govipalavala waeda karana aya ha sambandha wee aetha, namuth paksheen narambannanta yam avadaanama da aetha."" This translates to ""Many birds are connected to the activity of making nests with cow dung, but the nesting of birds is also connected.""

* **The question asks:** ""Kurulu influvensa waelandeeme waedima avadaanamak aeththe katada?"" This translates to ""What is the connection between the spread of influenza and birds' nesting?""

The passage explicitly links the spread of influenza to birds' nesting as a contributing factor, even though cow dung is also involved. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ksheerapayi sathun samaga waeda karana aya (the activity of making nests with cow dung):** While mentioned, the passage primarily focuses on *birds' nesting* as the connection.
* **C: kukulu ghanaye govipalawala waeda karana aya (the activity of making nests with cow dung):** Similar to B, this is a related activity, but not the primary connection highlighted.
* **D: meeta pera aasadanaya wu pudgalayin (the consumption of other animals):** The passage doesn't mention the consumption of other animals as a factor in influenza spread.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kuralu una niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: paksheen narambannan aasadanaya weeme avadaanamak aetha**.

Here's why:

* **P's core idea:** The first paragraph (P) describes how birds (kukulu) are influenced by the size of the area where humans cultivate crops (govipalavala).  The size of this cultivated area affects the amount of food (aasadanaya) available for the birds.

* **Q's question:** The second paragraph (Q) asks what factors influence the extent of the ""sandahan prakaashawalin"" (which seems to be a slightly unclear term, likely referring to the overall impact or reach of something).

* **Why C is the best answer:**  Option C directly addresses the core connection made in P: birds' food availability (aasadanaya) is affected by the area of human cultivation. This indirectly relates to the extent of the impact.  The passage emphasizes that birds are dependent on the food sources created by human agricultural practices.

* **Why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **A:** This option is too specific and only focuses on one particular aspect of the cultivation (the area). While important, it doesn't capture the broader influence on food availability.
    * **B:** This option focuses on humans' agricultural efforts and the amount of food they produce. While related, it doesn't directly address the impact on birds.
    * **D:** This option is too extreme. The passage doesn't say all human agricultural efforts inevitably lead to bird extinction.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate and comprehensive answer to Q, based on the information provided in P."
sudu muhuda-boltik aela sambandha karanne kumak da?,"The correct answer is **C: aaktik saagaraya saha boltik muhuda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sudu muhuda - boltik aela onegaa vila, laedoga vila saha shaanta pietersburg haraha waedi washayen ganga saha vil magin aaktic samudraya boltik muhuda samaga sambandha karayi.""  This translates to: ""The Sudu Muhuda (White Sea) is connected to the Onega Lake, Ladoga Lake, and the Neva River through the canals to the Arctic Ocean, connected to the Boltik Muhuda (Gulf of Finland).""

Therefore, the Sudu Muhuda (White Sea) is directly connected to the Arctic Ocean through the Boltik Muhuda (Gulf of Finland)."
"mema chedayata anuwa, magiyata badhaa nokarana andamin videsha gaman balapapra ekathu kala haekke kumana aakaraye waahanayakinda?","The correct answer is **B: raathree nidana dumriya (nighttime travel)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about a vehicle for nighttime travel that doesn't cause problems for the passenger or the driver.**
* **The passage describes a ""raathri nidana dumriya"" (nighttime travel vehicle) as a solution where one can travel at night without disturbing the driver and comfortably.**
* **The passage mentions a ""guvan yaanayakin"" (motorcycle) but also notes that its use is not advisable for long journeys.**
* **The other options are not directly related to the type of vehicle being sought.**

Therefore, the ""raathree nidana dumriya"" fits the description provided in the passage best."
"mema chedayata anuwa, samahara deshaseema athara yana dumriya waladee obe haendunumpatha pareekshaa kirimata ida aeththe kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: dumriyen baesa giya pasu (After the excursion)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a situation where you're going on a trip to a foreign country and need to have a passport.  It also mentions that if you're staying somewhere with a quiet environment, you can easily complete the passport application while sleeping.

Therefore, the logical next step *after* the excursion (going on the trip) is to apply for the passport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: oba nidaa sitina vita (While you are sleeping):** While the text *suggests* you *could* apply while sleeping in a quiet place, it doesn't state that you *should* do so *before* the trip.
* **C: eya pareekshaa nokere (If they don't take the exam):**  This is irrelevant to the question about passport applications.
* **D: dhaawanaya wana dumriye (A travel agency's excellent excursion):**  The quality of the travel agency doesn't directly relate to the passport application process.

singappooruwe ihala niwarthana kalaapaye raendee sitina kalaya thula boho vita siduviya haekke pahatha sandahan gaetaluwalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: ihala ushnathwayen vidaawata pathweema (escaping to a sheltered place)**.

Here's why:

* The original text describes a situation where if you are in Singapore and need to escape an emergency situation (like a fire or other danger), you should be able to reach a sheltered place like a sheltered location or a designated safe zone. 
* The question asks how you can achieve this.
* Option C, ""ihala ushnathwayen vidaawata pathweema,"" directly translates to ""escaping to a sheltered place."" This aligns with the information provided in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kollakaemata lak weema (going to the nearest restroom)** - This is irrelevant to escaping an emergency.
* **B: sappu walata praweshayak nomaethi weema (entering a shopping mall)** - While a shopping mall *could* be a sheltered place, the text emphasizes reaching a *designated* sheltered place.  A shopping mall is not explicitly mentioned as the primary destination.
* **D: atharaman weema (just running)** -  Simply running is not enough. You need to reach a *sheltered place*.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
jarmanu pestri anubhawa kirimen waelakee siteemata awashya viya haekke katada?,"The correct answer is **A: gaswala aeta warga walata daedi aasathmikathawayak aethi aya** (Because people who like nuts have a strong affinity for it).

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Boho germaanu bek kala aahaaravala baadam, hesal nat, saha wenath gasvala aeta varga daekiya haekiya.""  This translates to ""Many Germans like their baked goods with almonds, hazelnuts, and walnuts.""  

Therefore, the question asks what group *must* experience German pastries, and the text directly links enjoyment of nuts to liking German pastries. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the information in the text.
"
germanu pestri wala irthumaya angayak lesa salakanu labanne kumana amud‍ravyayada?,"The correct answer is **A: aepal (apple)**.

The text states: ""Varshaya purama pestrivala aepal saekasum sahitava..."" which translates to ""Traditionally, apple is added to pastries during the year..."". This indicates apples are a key ingredient that gives German pastries a characteristic flavor.

"mema chedayata anuwa, adu ayawaeyak samaga gaman sandaha nirdeshayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: obe suwapahasu mattama samaga nam‍yasheelee weema** (Travel with only your virtuous companions).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of good company during travel to maintain virtuous behavior and avoid negative influences. Option B directly aligns with this advice by suggesting traveling with virtuous companions.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: sanchaaraya atharathura amuthu raekiya seweema** (Travel by any means, without being cautious): The passage stresses the need for careful and mindful travel, not just any kind of travel.
*   **C: minisungen mudal illaa siteema** (Travel without any people): While solitude can be beneficial, the passage highlights the impact of company on behavior. Avoiding all people is not the recommended approach.
*   **D: aahara saha nawaathaen waeni viyadam kapaa haereema** (Control your behavior by limiting food and drink): While controlling desires is important, the passage focuses more on the influence of companions and overall mindful conduct rather than just dietary restrictions.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, itha awama ayawaeyak samaga gaman kirimata apahasu kalayak thibiya haekke katada?","The correct answer is **C: sanchaaraya karana atharathura durasthawa waeda kirimata saelasum karana kenek (Someone who is a meticulous person in communicating and handling distances.)**

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes meticulous communication and managing distances in relationships.** It speaks of avoiding unnecessary communication, being mindful of time and emotional boundaries, and being cautious about actions that could cause conflict.
* **Option C directly reflects this emphasis.** It describes someone who is careful and thorough in their communication and in maintaining appropriate distance in relationships.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: abhiyogayak piligannaa kenek (Someone who is pursuing an accusation)** This is irrelevant to the text's core theme of relationship dynamics and communication.
* **B: daedi kala seemawan nomaethi keneku (Someone who is a strict person)** While the text advises caution, it doesn't necessarily imply strictness.  The focus is on *meticulousness* rather than rigidity.
* **D: gaman saelaesmata anuwa kriya kirimata kaemathi kenek (Someone who acts according to a travel plan)** This is a very narrow interpretation. The text is about relationships and communication, not travel itineraries.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate reflection of the text's meaning."
maeriyan poyint saha feyarmont athara gamana niwaeradiwa visthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: wega seemawan itha kalaathurakin anugamanaya karanu laebe (Speed limit enforcement is frequently observed)**.

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes the presence of speed traps and frequent enforcement along the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway.  The text states: ""Pera haa pasu kotasvala prakaashitha vega seema kaepi penena lesa aduya - saamanyayen pae."" (Speed limit signs are often present and frequently enforced - generally.)  This indicates that speed limit enforcement is common.

The other options are less directly supported by the text:

* **A: dura baehaera pradeshawala digu maarga thibe (Long roads exist in surrounding states):** While true, the text doesn't link this directly to the reason for a lack of speed traps.
* **B: mantheeru patu we (Traffic is heavy):**  The text doesn't mention heavy traffic.
* **D: jangama durakathana sewaawa gaetaluwak noviya yuthuya (Speed enforcement vehicles are not frequently used):** The text directly contradicts this by stating speed limit enforcement is *frequently* observed.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, bafalo-pitsbarg adhiwegee maargaye gaman karana riyadurange pradhaana awadhaanaya yomu viya yuththe mewayin kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: adhika waahana thadabadayaka sira wee siteema (Avoiding heavy vehicle traffic)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway has a ""daedi abhiyogaatmaka riya paedaweeme tattva"" (dangerous and aggressive driving behavior) and warns about ""thivra baevum, patu mantheeru, saha daedi vanggu sahitha maarga"" (sharp curves, steep hills, and dangerous intersections). It then mentions a speed limit of 35-40 mph.

The key takeaway is that navigating this highway safely requires *avoiding* the hazards associated with heavy vehicle traffic and aggressive driving.  The passage implies that heavy traffic increases the risk of accidents on this already dangerous road.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: pramaanawath jangama durakathana sewaawak nomaethi weema (Using a standard long-distance service):** While this *might* be an option for long trips, it doesn't directly address the specific dangers of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway.
* **C: thiyunu wanguwak itha wegayen gaeneema (Driving with a clear view):** While important for any driving, the passage doesn't focus on visibility as the primary concern on this highway. The danger is more related to traffic and road conditions.
* **D: nithara maarga idikirimawalata muhuna deema (Being cautious of alternative routes):**  The question is specifically about *using* the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway. The passage doesn't suggest avoiding it altogether.



Therefore, avoiding heavy vehicle traffic aligns most closely with the warning and advice given in the passage.



"
kurubiliyak aarambha kirimata awashya nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: paeneeme haekiyawa (swimming is not necessary)**.

Here's why:

The question states that ""kurubiliya (nathi nam: kurubiliya saekasima) yanu viyali how jalaya piree aethi gaemburu doruvaka pahathata yaama pilibandava wei"" - meaning you can enjoy the Kurubiliya experience without needing to swim. It then lists activities like hiking, climbing, and cycling as being able to be combined with it.  Crucially, the passage specifically states that ""aarambha kireema sandaha sapeksava etharam puhunuvak how saririka haedayak awashya nove (udaharanayak lesa shikhara nageema, scuba kimidima how alpine skim samaga sasandana vita)"" which translates to ""it is not necessary to have any particular skills or physical fitness to start (it) (example: light hiking, scuba diving, and alpine skiing with a companion).""

Therefore, swimming is explicitly stated as not being a requirement. Options A (hiking), B (upper body strength), and D (solar proportionality/exposure) are not directly mentioned as prerequisites, but swimming *is* specifically mentioned as not being necessary.



"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Kaniyonin sandaha pihinima, kandu nageema saha paenima wani amga ekabaddha wee atha - namuth eya aarambha kireema sandaha sapeksava etharam puhunuvak how saririka haedayak awashya nove (udaharanayak lesa shikhara nageema, scuba kimidima how alpine skim samaga sasandana vita).""  This translates to: ""Information about canyons, climbing, and swimming are all combined, but starting it doesn't require any other skill or physical fitness (for example, light climbing, scuba diving, and alpine skiing are not required).""

* **The question asks:** ""What is necessary to have a successful kurubiliya trip?"" which means ""What is needed for a successful canyoning trip?""

* **The passage emphasizes that specific skills aren't *required* to *start* canyoning, but having information about canyoning is highly beneficial.** A guidebook (sahathikayak) would provide that information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: usas malala kreedaa haekiyawa (Basic life saving skills):** While good to have in any outdoor activity, the passage doesn't explicitly state that basic life-saving skills are *necessary* for a successful canyoning trip.
* **B: skooba kimidum pilibanda poorwa athdaekeema (Prior experience with scuba diving):**  The passage *specifically states* that scuba diving experience is *not* required.
* **D: pihineeme haekiyawa (Climbing skills):** The passage states that climbing skills are *not* required to *start* canyoning.



Therefore, a guidebook providing information about canyoning is the most relevant and accurate answer.

"mema chedaya anuwa, thama motar rathaye kandawuru baendeemak saelasum karana kenekuta prayojanawath wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: obe waahanaye seemawan gaena honda awabodhayak (understanding of your vehicle's limitations)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that driving a motor vehicle (especially a large one like a minivan or SUV) in a mountainous area (""kandavuru baedhima maargayak"") requires understanding the vehicle's capabilities and limitations.  It highlights the need for caution and awareness of the road conditions.  Therefore, having a good understanding of what your vehicle can handle is crucial for safe and effective driving in such terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: aasana digahaeriya haeki waahanayak (a vehicle with a spacious seating area)** - While spacious seating might be desirable, the text's focus is *not* on seating capacity but on safe driving in mountainous roads.
*   **C: koodaaramak (cabin)** - The cabin is part of the vehicle, not the core benefit of understanding its limitations.
*   **D: kandawuru baendeemata pawudgalika bhoomiyak (mountainous terrain)** -  Mountainous terrain is *the context* of the problem, not the solution.  The solution is how to *navigate* the terrain safely.

"mema chedayata anuwa, motar ratha kandawuru bandinnan anawashya awadhaanayen waelakee siteemata balaaporoththu wanne nam, owunta awashya viya haekke kumak da?","The correct answer is **A: esyuwee rathayak ho minivaen rathayak waeni vishaala waahanayak dhaawanaya kirima**

Here's why:

The question asks what is *necessary* if you want to drive a large vehicle carefully in a traffic situation. The passage mentions that large vehicles like minivans, SUVs, and sedans need to be driven cautiously in traffic. Therefore, to drive a large vehicle (like an SUV or minivan) carefully in traffic, you need a large vehicle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: digu maarga gamanak yama (long distance travel):**  While careful driving is important for long distances, the passage focuses on driving *in traffic*, not long-distance travel.
* **C: nagaraye ho pawudgalika bhoomiyaka koodaaram gaeseema (heavy traffic areas):** Heavy traffic areas *require* careful driving, but they don't dictate what kind of vehicle is necessary. The question is about what vehicle is *necessary* to drive carefully.
* **D: owun bhaavitha karana waahanaya gaena daenumak nomaethi weema (avoiding hitting other vehicles):** Avoiding collisions is crucial for safe driving, but it's not a necessary *vehicle requirement*. Any vehicle can be driven safely by avoiding collisions.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that directly addresses the question of what is necessary to drive a large vehicle carefully in a traffic situation, based on the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dewana wathawatath kaesablaanka naewatha goda naeguwe kawuda?","The correct answer is **D: morokkanu sulthan**.

The passage states: ""Morokkanu sultan naewatha nagaraya godanaegooye daru ayi-badya namin wana athara..."" which translates to ""The Moroccan Sultan took possession of the city and established a fortress...""

Therefore, the Moroccan Sultan was the one who took control of Casablanca.
"

The passage states: ""Morokkanu sultan naewatha nagaraya godanaegooye daru ayi-badya namin wana athara, **spaangna velandun** visin kaesablanka yana naamaya dene ladi.""  This translates to: ""The Moroccan sultan, wanting to establish a foothold, gave the name Casablanca to the place, **after the Spanish territory**.""

Therefore, the Spanish were the ones who influenced the naming of Casablanca, leading to the Spanish presence and eventual establishment of a Spanish territory there.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sint‍raa videshikayan athara piligaeneemak laba gaththe keseda?","The correct answer is **A: kaebo da roka**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""403 skotarb bus rathaya nirantarava sintraa wetha gaman karana athara kaebo da roka hi navatvayi."" This translates to: ""The 403 Skoda bus, constantly traveling along Sintra, is also new.""

The question asks what the traveler gained from the pilgrimage to Sintra. The passage explicitly mentions the new Skoda bus as a gain for the traveler.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: mariya thumiyage darshana:**  This refers to Mariyathumiyage Darshana's vision, which isn't presented as a direct benefit to the traveler.
* **C: bairan samiwarayaage dhanaathmaka samalochana:** This refers to the spiritual contemplation of the Bairen Samivaraya (a revered figure), and while potentially beneficial, the passage doesn't highlight it as a concrete gain.
* **D: ehi aadara ithihasaya:** This refers to the revered history of Sintra, and again, it's not directly framed as a gain for the traveler.



"
aarmeniyawa visin piliganu nolabanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: naagorno-karabak kalaapaya (Nagorno-Karabakh conflict)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kalaapaya pura wana raajyathaanthrika mathabhedayan armeniyaava saha asarbayijaanaya athara wana sambandhataavanta digatama baadha karamin sity.""  This translates to: ""The long-standing state-political disagreements over the conflict (referring to the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict) significantly hampered relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""

The passage emphasizes that the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict was a major factor preventing Armenia from establishing a new nation. The other options are related to the conflict but not the primary reason *why* Armenia's goal of building a new nation wasn't achieved.



"
asarbaijanaya saha aarmeniyawa athara sambandhathawayata akhandawa balapanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: naagorno-karabak kalaapaya**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What significantly impacted the relationship between Azerbaijan and Armenia?
* **The passage states:** ""Kalaapaya pura wana raajyathaanthrika mathabhedayan armeniyaava saha asarbayijaanaya athara wana sambandhataavanta digatama baadha karamin sity."" This translates to ""The Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and the ensuing state-political disagreements significantly impacted the relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: asarbaijanaye jiwath wana aarmeniyanuwan (Azerbaijani life is better than Armenian life):**  The passage doesn't provide information to support this claim, and it's a subjective statement.
* **B: 1994 yuddhaya (the 1994 war):** The 1994 war was *a part of* the conflict, but the *conflict itself* (specifically the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict) is the root cause of the impact.
* **C: raajyathanthrika tharka (state-political logic):** While state-political disagreements contributed, the core issue was the conflict over Nagorno-Karabakh.



Therefore, **D: naagorno-karabak kalaapaya** is the most accurate and directly supported answer."
"chaalat hi kulee rathayak gannaa atharathura, amathara gaasthuwakata hethu viya haekke kumak da?","The correct answer is **D: pawul hithaishee weema (Increase in firewood demand)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pasugiya vasara 20 thula, chaalat avata pradeshaye daruvanta hithaisi vikalpa itha waedi washayen vardhanaya wee atha. Yam avasthaavaladi eva yam pamanakata prayojanavat viya haeki vuvat, chaalat hi pavul saamanyayen kuli rathha bhaavitha nokarayi.""  This translates to: ""During the past year, the demand for firewood in the state of North Carolina increased significantly.  Many things that were not necessary were also used up, and North Carolina was affected by a firewood shortage.""
* **The passage further explains the cause:** ""Amathara gaasthuwakata hethu viya haekke kumak da? (What was the cause of the firewood shortage?)""  The answer is directly related to the increased demand. The text implies the increased demand is due to a *hithaisi weema* (significant increase) in firewood use.  The reason for the increased firewood use is stated earlier in the passage: North Carolinians were afraid of burglars and wanted to keep their homes warm, leading to increased firewood consumption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wenath pradeshayaka padinchi weema (Migration from North Carolina):** The passage mentions migration *from* North Carolina (people leaving the state) as a cause of the firewood shortage, but not as the primary *reason* for the shortage.
* **B: mageen thideneku siteema (Modern heating systems):** The passage indicates that North Carolinians were *not* using modern heating systems and relied on firewood, contributing to the shortage.
* **C: nagaraya thulata yama (Urban population increase):** While an increase in the urban population *could* potentially contribute to increased firewood demand, the passage focuses on the general state of the region and the increased fear of burglary as a main cause.



Therefore, option D, which points to the increase in firewood demand as the cause of the shortage, is the most accurate and directly supported by the passage.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, chaalat hi daruwan samaga jiwath weeme awaasiyak lesa saelakiya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: niwasa mila ganan (Increasing housing availability)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that a major reason for non-residents moving to Charlotte is the high cost of living, particularly housing. 
*  The increase in housing costs in 2020 led to many people being unable to afford to live there, forcing them to leave.
* Therefore, increasing housing availability would directly address the problem highlighted in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kulee rathayak laba gaeneema (Getting a good job):** While job opportunities are likely a factor in people moving to Charlotte, the text specifically focuses on the high cost of living, not job availability.
* **C: wenath pradeshawalin paeminena nevaasikayan (Non-residents from other states):** This is simply a description of who is moving, not a solution to the problem.
* **D: nagaraya rasa vindeemata uthsaha kirima (Encouraging the city's attractiveness):**  While making the city more attractive might help, it doesn't directly solve the housing affordability issue.  The problem is *too expensive* to live there, not that the city isn't appealing.



"
"spaangnga jaathikayan paemineemata pera, chilee hi uthuru kotasa palanaya kale kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: mapuche**.

The passage states: ""Maepuche, chiliya nidahas weemen pasu kaalaya dakwama spaangna bhaashava kathaa karana paalanayata sampurnayen natu novoo avasan svaadhina aemerikaanu svadesika kandaayam athara ekak da viya.""  This translates to: ""The Mapuche, after the Spanish had greatly reduced the native population, completely refused to be governed in Spanish, and in the newly independent American indigenous lands, they became a powerful force.""

Therefore, the Mapuche were the ones who resisted Spanish rule in Chile.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, 1810 dee sidu nowuye pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: chilee nidahasa prakaashayata path karayi** (Chile achieved independence).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""1810 dee chiliya svaadhinatvaya prakaashayata..."" which translates to ""In 1810, Chile declared its independence...""
* **Option D directly reflects this statement.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: madhyama rajayak nomaethi viya** (the middle kingdom was established): While there might have been political developments, the primary event mentioned in the passage related to 1810 is the declaration of independence.
* **B: chilee spaangngayata erehiwa jayagrahanaya athkara gaththeya** (Chile won a decisive victory against the Spanish): The passage mentions a victory in 1818, not in 1810.
* **C: naepoliyanu yuddha walata erehiwa satan kerini** (it intervened in the Napoleonic Wars): The passage mentions the Napoleonic Wars as a backdrop, but doesn't state Chile intervened directly.



"
liguriya kalaapaye dura baehaera gammanawalata minisun paeminenne keseda?,"The correct answer is **B: motar ratha ho dumriya magin**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""manpet, dumriya saha bottu magin gammana yaa kerena athara, pitathin motor rathha valata ehi paeminiya nohaeka.""

This translates to: ""From Manpet, Dumriya and Bottu roads, people are traveling by motor vehicles.""

Therefore, the people are traveling by motor vehicles on the Dumriya road.
"
ithali padaya 'sink tere' yannen adahas karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: prapaatha pahak (river path)**.

Here's why:

The provided text states that the ""six riyomaeggier, maenarola, konigliya, varnaasa saha monteroso"" (which are likely river names) are hidden within the Ligurian region of Italy. It also mentions that the landscape has been shaped by ""prapaathavalata kelin ihalin aethi vishama, adhika baevum sahitha bhumibhaagavala"" - which translates to ""mountainous, with very uneven and high-altitude land formed by rivers.""

Therefore, the Italian peninsula's ""sink tere"" (presumably referring to its unique beauty or hidden locations) is revealed through its **river paths (prapaatha pahak)**.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sheetha irthuwe lissana sulu thathwayan sandaha sudusu wanne kumana wargaye boot sapaththu da?","The correct answer is **D: angal 1/5 ka gaemburu ratawak nomaethi boots sapaththu (Angal 1/5 ka gaemburu ratawak nomaethi boots sapaththu)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...millimetar 5k (angal 1/5k) ho ita waedi viya yuthu ya, seethala ushnathwaye dee drawyaya pramaanavath lesa mrudu viya yuthu ya.""  This directly translates to ""Angal 1/5k (5k) ho ita waedi viya yuthu ya, seethala ushnathwaye dee drawyaya pramaanavath lesa mrudu viya yuthu ya.""  This describes boots made with a 1/5k (or 5k) sole thickness.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate description of the boots mentioned in the passage.  The other options are not supported by the text."
sheetha kalaye dee ayis sahitha maargawala karshanaya waedi diyunu kirimata upakaree nowanne mewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: lunu (caelciyamm kloriyd)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Samanyayen gharshanaya waedi kirimata waeli, boralu ho lunu (caelciyamm kloriyd) maarga ho maavath matha visuruvaa harinu laebe.""  This translates to: ""Generally, to facilitate friction, salt (calcium chloride) found in the dust of gravel is sprinkled.""

Therefore, salt (lunu) is used to increase friction on icy surfaces.

The passage states: ""...mema dupath samahara avasthaavala dee """"pahala hawaay"""" lesa adahas karay. Kudaa vuvat, emagin samahara vaedihiti sanchaarakayinta vishaala sanchaaraka hotael saha wenath sanvardhanayakin thorava rajyayak bavata pathweemata pera thibu hawaay sihiyata nanvay.""

This translates to: ""...this atoll is slightly affected by ""first wave"" effects.  In short, imagine a large number of hotels and tourism development that are connected to the world via a highway.""

Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:

* **B: e dekatama raajyathwayak naetha (there is no state there)** - The passage indicates the atoll is a ""thorava rajyayak"" (a state/territory).
* **C: e dekama kala kalaapaya beda ganee (the climate is different)** - The passage says the climate is ""pahala hawaay"" (first wave), implying it's *similar* to other places affected by that climate.
* **D: e dekatama kisidu nagarayak nomaetha (there is no city there)** - The passage says there are ""kisidu nagarayak nomaetha"" (a few cities) on the Cook Islands atoll.



"

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Cook dupatvala kisindu nagarayak nomaeti namuth vividhaakaara dupath 15 kin saedee aetha. pradhaana eva wanne rarothongaa saha aythuthaki wae.""  This directly translates to: ""Cook Islands have several cities, but the main ones are Rarotonga and Ayitutaki.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya hawayi walata wadaa kudaayi** (it is close to Hawaii): The passage mentions a ""pahala hawaay"" (early Hawaii) influence, but doesn't say it's *close* to Hawaii.
* **B: eya doopath samoohayaki** (it is a island group): The passage already establishes that Cook Islands *are* an island group.
* **D: mema doopath raajyaya hawayi walata samana kala kalaapayak beda ganee** (this island nation has a similar climate to Hawaii): The passage talks about a *similar climate* influence, not that it *has* the same climate.



"
nawathaen vikalpa dekak idiripath karanne pahatha sandahan wana ud‍yaana palaka madyasthaana walin sthaanawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: sirenaa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""la liyona, sen pedrilo saha loss patos hi aahaara sapayanu nolabana athara, kandavuru baendhima pamanak aetha."" This translates to ""la liyona, Sen Pedrillo, and Loss Patos were unable to obtain food, and the kandavuru baendhima (a specific type of person) was also present.""  

Later, it's mentioned that Puverto Jimenez needed a garden allowance, but didn't have a credit card.  The text also indicates the garden service (MINAE) did not provide the allowance within the expected timeframe. The cost of the allowance is mentioned as being between $30 and $100.

The question asks which of the listed options would be facing the garden manager's authority.  Since the text directly links ""la liyona, Sen Pedrillo, and Loss Patos"" to not being able to get food, and the garden allowance is managed by the garden manager, it's the most logical connection.

Therefore, the answer is **A: sirenaa** (which refers to ""la liyona"").

"mema chedayata anuwa, obata kredit kadapath wenuwata mudal bhaavitha kirimata awashya nam obata ud‍yaana balapathrayak wen karawa gatha haekke kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **C: Kaefenet el Sol**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Cafaenet el sol ek dina avasara pathra sandaha dollar 30 ho dollar 10 gaastuvakata venkirim sevaavak sapayay; visthara ovunge kokovaado pituvehi aetha.""

This translates to: ""At Kaefenet el Sol, a one-day opportunity ticket costs between $30 and $10; the details of this are available.""

The question asks where the person should go to get a loan to cover the cost of the opportunity ticket.  Since Kaefenet el Sol offers the ticket, it's logical that they would also be the place to inquire about financing options.  The other options are mentioned as involved in the situation but don't directly offer a way to get a loan for the ticket itself.

"mema chedayata anuwa, baewum sahitha bhoomiyaka kumana aakaraye skee kreedaawak sidu karanneda?","The correct answer is **A: skee hayiking**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Uramallaka aduvaediya damaagena pitehi randavaa gaene ski kreeda kireema: meya ski kridaakirima ski tuwaring ho ski hayking lesada haedinve."" This translates to: ""For those who have experience in skiing, the second stage is skiing hiking, skiing leading.""

* The question asks what kind of ski sport is suitable for someone who is just starting.

*  ""Ski hayking"" (ski hiking) implies a less intense form of skiing, often involving hiking to reach different areas, which is appropriate for beginners.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: pitisara skee kreedaawa (Difficult skiing sport):** This is too advanced for a beginner.
* **C: aelpayin ratawa (Small country):**  This refers to a country size, not a type of ski sport.
* **D: skee magin aevida gaman kirima (Skiing leading/guiding):** This implies a skill level of leading others, which requires experience.

Therefore, **ski hayiking** is the most appropriate answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, ihala wegayakata langaa weemata kaemathi pitisara skee kreedakayinta upakara kala haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: daedi boot sapaththu (good boots)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes the importance of good boots (""boot sapaththu"") as essential equipment for skiing. It specifically mentions them alongside skis, poles, and appropriate clothing. The question asks what is helpful for a beginner skier.  Good boots are *crucial* for control, support, and preventing injury – especially for someone learning.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: bara baekpaek baegayak (a good backpack):** While a backpack might be useful for carrying things, it's not as fundamentally important for basic skiing as good boots.
* **C: honda thaththwayan (good clothing):** Good clothing is important, but the text specifically highlights boots as a necessity.
* **D: pirimaedoo gaman maarga (a well-marked path):**  A well-marked path is helpful, but doesn't directly relate to equipment needed to *ski*.

naewatha aethulweeme kampaanaya athvindina sanchaarakayinta apahasu kalayak wanne kumak kirimata da?,"The correct answer is **B: iwasillen ha awabodhayen siteema (Learning and understanding)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph discusses the challenges of adapting to a new culture and the importance of understanding the new cultural norms and values. It emphasizes that newcomers need to learn and understand the local customs and traditions to successfully integrate and avoid conflict.  The paragraph states that it is crucial for both the newcomers and the host society to facilitate this learning and understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nawa sthaanayaka sanskruthiyata anuwarthanaya weema (Adapting to the new local culture):** While adapting is necessary, the paragraph highlights that adapting *requires* learning and understanding. It's not the primary action itself, but the process enabled by learning and understanding.
* **C: videshayaka sanchaaraya kirima (Maintaining foreign communication):** The paragraph actually argues *against* solely maintaining foreign communication. It stresses the need to integrate into the local culture.
* **D: owunge mul sanskruthiyata naewatha anuwarthanaya weema (Adapting to one's original culture in a new place):** The paragraph discusses *adapting to the new culture*, not clinging to the old one.  While maintaining some connection to one's roots is important, the focus is on integration into the new environment.



Therefore, **B (Learning and understanding)** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the paragraph's content.

"mema chedayata anuwa, naewatha aethulweeme kampaanaya visheshayen dushkara viya haekke kumana aakaraye sanchaarakayekuta da?","The correct answer is **B: videshayaka jiwath wana vita wegawathwa anuwarthanaya wana sanchaarakayinta (A broadcaster who excessively follows foreign lifestyles)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses how the influence of foreign cultures can erode native traditions.** It states that when people live abroad and adopt foreign lifestyles, they can be pressured to abandon their own culture and values.
* **Option B directly reflects this concern.** It describes a broadcaster who excessively follows foreign lifestyles, implying they are promoting these foreign lifestyles and potentially contributing to the erosion of native culture.
* **Other options are less relevant:**
    * **A: visheshayen naraka sanskruthika kampaanaya athvindina sanchaarakayin (A broadcaster who excessively promotes a foreign cultural campaign):** While related, it's less specific than option B. Option B focuses on the broader influence of foreign lifestyles.
    * **C: thawamath madhusamaya gatha karana sanchaarakayin (A broadcaster who is excessively drunk):** This is completely unrelated to the passage's topic.
    * **D: adu iwaseemak aethi sanchaarakayin (A broadcaster who is overly rigid):**  This also isn't directly addressed in the passage.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer because it aligns with the passage's core argument about the negative impacts of foreign lifestyles on native culture, particularly through the influence of broadcasters."
minisun moos sathun samaga sidu kirimen waelakee sitiya yuththe pahatha sandahan karunu walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: dura sita owun nireekshanaya kirima (observing them from a distance)**.

* **The passage states:** ""Uthuru amaericaanu gonun bhayaanaka viya haeki yaeyi nosithaa minisun, ovunta onaevata vada sameepaweemen thamanva ma avadaanamata lakkarayi.""  This translates to something like: ""North Americans, being fearful, did not approach those people directly, but observed them from a distance.""

* **The question asks:** ""How did the people observe the moose and other creatures?""

* **Option D directly reflects the information given in the passage.** The North Americans observed them from a distance because they were fearful.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owunge paewaethma nosalaka haereema (they were trying to steal their possessions):** The passage doesn't mention theft. It focuses on fear and observation.
* **B: itha semin langaa weema (they were staying close to them):**  The passage explicitly states they did *not* stay close.
* **C: owunge vibhavya tharjana mattama awama kirima (only observing their behavior):** While observation *is* involved, the passage implies more than just behavior; it mentions the overall presence of the moose and other creatures.  ""Observing from a distance"" encompasses more than just behavior.



Therefore, **D** is the only option consistent with the text."

* **The passage states:** ""Uthuru amaericaanu gonun bhayaanaka viya haeki yaeyi nosithaa minisun, ovunta onaevata vada sameepaweemen thamanva ma avadaanamata lakkarayi.""  This translates to: ""The North Americans were frightened, and the people nearby were afraid of them.""

* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""sameepaye sitina pudgalayin visin owun kulappu viya haekiya"" - ""People nearby appeared frightened of them.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: owun swabhawayen kalahakaree sathun we (They were naturally liars):** The passage doesn't say they are *naturally* liars. It says they *appeared* to be.
* **B: owun samahara vita vibhawa tharjanayak lesa nosaelake (They didn't show much respect when they were gathered):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: awashya nam owun thamanwama aarakshaa kara ganu aetha (They necessarily protected themselves):** The passage says people were *afraid* of them, implying the opposite – they instilled fear.



Therefore, **C** is the only option that accurately summarizes the information presented in the passage."

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the moon's reflection in the water is crucial for survival.** The passage states that without the moon's reflection in the water, the traveler's strength and the amount of water they can obtain are severely limited. They won't be able to reach safety.  The traveler needs this reflection to navigate.

* **Option A (Seeing the stars at night):** While stars are visible at night, the passage emphasizes the *moon's reflection* as a key element for survival in this specific scenario.

* **Options C & D (Suppression of the body's heat/water):** These are incorrect. The passage describes the body's heat as unusually low, indicating a problem *with* heat retention, not that it's being suppressed. Similarly, it's not about avoiding water, but about obtaining it *through the moon's reflection*.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**."
kaanthara sanchaarakayinta aethi viya haeki tharjanayak sandahan nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: hayipothermiyawa (Hypothermia)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes symptoms of hypothermia:** The text mentions a person being unable to walk straight, shivering uncontrollably, and feeling cold even in a hot environment. These are all classic signs of hypothermia.
* **Hypothermia is the body's dangerous lowering of temperature:** The passage highlights the body's inability to maintain its normal temperature regulation, specifically mentioning that even in a hot desert, the person felt unusually cold.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: jala hingaya (Water leakage):**  While water leakage *could* contribute to feeling cold, it doesn't explain the other symptoms like difficulty walking and uncontrollable shivering.
    * **B: miringu (Incline/Slope):** A slope wouldn't directly cause the body to lose heat rapidly.
    * **D: awwata pilisseema (Heatstroke):** Heatstroke is the opposite of hypothermia – it's an abnormally *high* body temperature. The passage clearly describes a body that's losing heat.



Therefore, **hayipothermiyawa (Hypothermia)** is the only option that accurately describes the condition presented in the passage.

"mema chedaya anuwa, gaweshakayange paemineemen pasu vishaala washayen balapaemata lak wuye kumana janagahana kandaayamada?","The correct answer is **C: tayino jaathikayan**.

The passage states: ""Yuropaa gaveshakayan paemina keti kaalayakata pasuwa, spangna aakramanikayan visin tyno janagahanaya saelakiya yuthu lesa adu karana ladi.""  This translates to ""After European explorers wrote, Spanish invaders fought a war to enslave the native population.""  And later it mentions, ""Fray bartholoma da laa kaasaashi (trataado de laas indiyaas) sita, 1492 sita 1498 dakvaa kaalaya thula spangna aakramanikayan tynovarun 100,000 k pamana ghaatanaya kalaha."" which translates to ""Fray bartholoma da laa kaasaashi (Treaty of the Indies) stated that during the period from 1492 to 1498, Spanish invaders killed 100,000 people.""

The passage clearly indicates that the Spanish invaders enslaved and killed the *native population*, referred to as ""tayino jaathikayan"" (native people).  The options provided refer to the people who were doing the enslaving (Spanish), the people being enslaved (Caribbean people - a broad term encompassing many groups), and the people who were the original inhabitants (Haitian people - just one specific group).  The passage focuses on the *native population* who were subjugated.

"mema chedayata anuwa, kaereebiyanuwan visin katha karana lada bhaashawa kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: spaangnga**.

This translates to: ""The Caribbean was inhabited by approximately 10,000 people who spoke the Arawakan language. After European explorers arrived, Spanish invaders fought to conquer the natives.""

Therefore, the Spanish language is the one spoken by the invaders and is the language associated with the history of the Caribbean in the passage.

Therefore, the Norwegian is credited with popularizing skiing as a recreational activity.

"mema chedayata anuwa, skee kreedaawa kreedaawak lesa mulinma piliganu laebuwe kumana kalayedee da?","The correct answer is **A: 18 wana siyawasa**.

This translates to: ""In the ancient times, the ice skating game existed for about **17 thousand years** before 1861, a Norwegian invented it in Australia to popularize the winter sport.""

While the game existed for 17,000 years, the question asks *when* it became a popular recreational sport. The text indicates this happened around 1861. However, the question asks about the *initial* period of the sport's existence before it became popular. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is that the ice skating game existed for approximately 17,000 years.  However, since 17,000 is not an option, and the text also mentions it existed for *about* 17 thousand years *before* 1861, the closest and most logical answer considering the given options is **18 wana siyawasa** (18 thousand years), which is the closest numerical representation of the long period the game existed.

**However, there's a slight ambiguity.**  The question asks ""mema chedayata anuwa, skee kreedaawa kreedaawak lesa mulinma piliganu laebuwe kumana kalayedee da?"" which translates to ""According to your understanding, when did the ski game initially begin?"".  The text indicates the game existed for 17,000 years before 1861, when it started to become popular.  The closest option that reflects a long period before popularity is **A: 18 wana siyawasa** (18 thousand years). While not perfectly aligned with the precise wording, it's the best fit among the provided choices.



Therefore, considering the options, **A: 18 wana siyawasa** is the best possible answer, although the wording of the question and the text are somewhat ambiguous.

This translates to: ""In the 15th century, Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama started the direct sea route to India from Europe.""  This marks the beginning of European colonialism in the region, which fundamentally changed the relationship with Africa.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: islaam dahama (Islam religion):** While Islam has a presence in the region, the text doesn't primarily attribute the significant changes to the religion itself.
* **C: wana jiween (Wildlife):** The text mentions Madagascar's wildlife but doesn't link it directly to the reason for the changes in Africa's relationship with the rest of the world.
* **D: sukhopabhogee werala nikethana (A place to enjoy comforts):** While some people found comfort in the region, this doesn't explain the broader historical shifts mentioned in the text.



Therefore, European colonialism is the most direct and significant factor related to the question."

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ithaa kudaa dupath bahutarayak svaadhina jaathin ho pranshaya samaga ek woo..."" which translates to ""Even this island was subject to France..."" 

The other options are not directly supported by the text as a defining characteristic of Madagascar:

*   **B: boho sukhopabhogee werala nikethana (a place to live very happily):** While it mentions happiness, it's not a defining characteristic.
*   **C: wana jiween sandaha prasiddhiyak (famous for its wildlife):** The passage mentions wildlife (wanajeeween), but doesn't say it's famous for it.
*   **D: wenath ratawalin swadheena weema (subject to other countries):** While Madagascar *was* subject to other countries, it's not a unique characteristic mentioned in the passage. France is specifically mentioned in relation to Madagascar.

The provided text discusses the traditions surrounding Easter. It mentions that many communities celebrate the Easter festival with the story of the crucifixion (senasurada raathriye paasku uthsavayak pawathwana). It also notes the connection to the spring season and the rebirth of nature (purva kithunu vasantaya saha sashrikathva chaarithra kramayak da viya haekiya).

Option A directly reflects this core element of Easter celebration: remembering the story of Jesus's crucifixion.  The other options are less central to the overall significance of the festival as described in the text.

This translates to: ""A traveler who is a citizen of a country with a shared border can obtain an exception to this requirement by presenting a shared border green card to the Ecuadorian consulate.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sanchaaraya karana dinen obbata masa 6 kata wadaa walangu videsha gaman balapathrayak (a foreign travel permit valid for 6 months):**  While a travel permit is mentioned, the text focuses on the *exception* granted by a green card for citizens of bordering countries, not a standard permit.
* **B: neethyaanukoola aerayum lipiyak (a legally valid passport):** A passport is a standard requirement for travel, not an exception for citizens of bordering countries.  The text mentions a *legally valid passport* but doesn't emphasize it as the key to the exception.
* **C: raendee sitina kalaya sanaatha kirima sandaha yana ena idiriyata aethi gaman tikath pathak (a flight ticket showing the date of the return trip):** A return ticket is a standard requirement, not an exception.

Therefore, the **eksath janapada green kadapathak (shared border green card)** is the exception mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

* The provided text states that for citizens of certain countries, the requirement to obtain a visa to enter Ecuador has been eliminated. However, this doesn't mean they are exempt from all travel requirements.
* The text specifically mentions that these citizens *still* need to present their passport and a return ticket to the Ecuadorian consulate.
* Therefore, coordinating with and verifying foreign travel documents (passports, return tickets) is a crucial aspect of the visa requirements for these countries.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: sanchaarakayinge sankyawa awama mattamaka thaba gaeneema (Strictly controlling the number of travelers):** While Ecuador might have traveler monitoring systems, the primary issue highlighted in the text isn't about limiting the number of travelers, but about verifying their documentation.
* **B: sanvidhaanaathmaka sankramana prawahayak pawathwa gaeneema (Establishing a constitutional migration flow):** This is too broad. While important for any country, it doesn't directly address the specific visa requirements mentioned in the text.
* **C: sanchaarakayekuge raendee siteeme kalaya thahawuru kirima (Integrating the two systems of travelers):** This refers to integrating different traveler tracking systems and is not the core focus of the provided text.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a scenario where someone needs to improve their vision for work.** They need to see details, perform tasks requiring precision, and potentially work in environments with specific visual demands.  The passage mentions things like reading small text, working with precise details, and potentially needing to see in various conditions.

* **Option C, ""drushti rakshanaya"" (vision protection), directly addresses the need for improving and safeguarding eyesight, which aligns with the passage's context.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: akshi pareekshana (eye examination):** While an eye exam is *part* of addressing vision problems, it doesn't encompass the overall need for vision *improvement* mentioned in the passage.
* **B: usas pele kannaadi raamu (morning sun glasses raamu):** This is a very specific and unusual option that doesn't relate to the broader problem of needing better vision.  The name ""Raamu"" is irrelevant.
* **D: welanda sannam nowana raamu (telescope glasses new Raamu):**  A telescope is for *magnifying distant objects*, not for improving vision at close range. Again, the name ""Raamu"" is irrelevant.



Therefore, **drushti rakshanaya (vision protection)** is the most accurate and relevant answer.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where a person (Ramu) is having trouble seeing clearly, especially when looking at distant objects. The solution presented is to have a special eye examination.  This is a standard procedure to determine if there's a refractive error (like nearsightedness, farsightedness, or astigmatism) that needs correction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: samahara raamu sandaha vaid‍ya niyama kirim walangu noviya haekiya (Samahara Ramu sandaha vaidya niyama kirim walangu noviya haekiya - Ramu didn't need a doctor's prescription):** While a prescription *might* be needed after the exam, the initial step to determine the cause of the vision problem is the examination itself.
* **C: ewa vyaaja ewa viya haekiya (Ewa vyaaja ewa viya haekiya - It was like a fake/illusion):** The passage doesn't suggest the problem is illusory. It's a real vision impairment.
* **D: rakshanaya piriwaeya aawaranaya nokaranu aetha (Rakshanaya piriwaeya aawaranaya nokaranu aetha - Didn't wear protective eyewear):** The passage focuses on the vision problem itself, not whether protective eyewear was worn or not.

Therefore, the most logical and direct answer based on the passage is that a special eye examination was needed."

(When Dupatvala buys Falkland dollars, he also gets a lot of credit cards and American dollars with Stanley.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: eksath janapada dolaraya piligannaa ekama sthaanaya staenli pamani (Getting US dollars when buying local Stanley money):** The passage *doesn't* say US dollars are received. It mentions British pounds.
* **C: doopath walin pitathweemen pasu fokland pawum huwamaru kara gatha yuthuya (The Falklands War that occurred after buying dollars):** While the Falklands War is related to the Falkland Islands, the passage doesn't directly connect buying Falkland dollars to the war.
* **D: fokland pawuma haerunu vita brithan‍ya pawuma saaman‍yayen wadaathma piligath mudal we (The common money received in British pounds when buying Falkland money):**  The passage doesn't state that British pounds are *always* received. It says they are received *when* buying Falkland dollars.

Here's why:

The passage explains that due to the exchange rate issues and difficulties in obtaining British Pounds (GBP) in the Falkland Islands, individuals need a Foreign Currency Permit (FIC) to access credit card transactions and US dollars.  The FIC allows them to exchange Falkland Islands currency for foreign currency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: siyaluma doopath wala (All Dupatas):**  The text says that not all Dupatas are eligible for this process, specifically mentioning that the value of the Dupta should be high enough to warrant the application for an FIC.
*   **C: pitasthara doopath wala (Local Dupatas):** The passage focuses on the difficulty of exchanging currency, not on the difference between local and international Dupatas.
*   **D: staenli puraawata (Stanley Power):**  ""Stanley Power"" is not a relevant concept in the context of currency exchange or obtaining credit card access.



Therefore, the FIC is the specific permit needed for conducting international transactions in the Falkland Islands, especially concerning credit card usage and foreign currency exchange, making option A the accurate answer."

This translates to: ""The festival in Boho temples is celebrated on the anniversary of the deity's auspicious occasion, a day when the deity is particularly pleased.""

Therefore, the festival time is linked to a significant and auspicious day for the deity. Option C, ""dewathaviyakage upandinaya,"" accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aliyekuge upatha (The beginning of the year):** While festivals *can* sometimes coincide with the new year, the text doesn't explicitly state this.
* **B: kovile sanwathsaraya (The temple's anniversary):**  While it mentions a yearly anniversary, it's tied to the *deity's* auspicious occasion, not just the temple's.

This translates to: ""Along with a long procession with traditional art, the temple orchestra and other festive elements, a grand procession is organized as part of the temple festival in Kerala.""

The question asks where this procession starts. The passage directly states it starts ""pansal uthsawa perahaerak"" which means the temple festival procession.

"mema chedayata anuwa, vyaapara ho palamu panthiye prawesha pathrawala mudal ithiri kara gaeneemata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: obe samaagama haraha eya viyadam kirima (Analyzing all your expenses)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes that starting a business involves costs.** It mentions the need for initial investment, operational costs (like raw materials), and environmental costs. 
* **Question Q asks about the distance to reach the business's entry point (financial viability).**
* **Analyzing all expenses (Option A) is the crucial first step to understand the financial viability.** You need to know *all* the costs involved before you can determine if the business is worth pursuing.  This includes initial investment, ongoing operational expenses, and more.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: vyaapara panthiya wenuwata palamu panthiya wenkarawa gaeneema (Taking a loan from a business bank)** While potentially helpful, this doesn't address the fundamental need to *know* the expenses first.  Taking a loan *without* understanding the costs is risky.
* **C: riju nowana palamu panthiye guvan gamanak wenkarawa gaeneema (Taking a loan from a new business bank)** Same reasoning as option B.
* **D: wattam aethi daeyi soya baeleema (Selling the unsold stock)** This is a *reaction* to a problem (unsold stock) and not a foundational step in assessing financial viability. It doesn't address the initial costs.



Therefore, analyzing all your expenses is the necessary starting point to determine if starting a business is financially viable.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, yam panthi gaasthu wenkarawa gaeneem pilibanda seweemedee kalaya naasthi kirimak wanuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **D: palamu panthiya**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""Which path is not suitable for obtaining blessings regarding business?""
* **The text explicitly states:** ""...palamu panthiya sandaha ekolos gunayak gevimata obata apeksa kala haekiya! Poduve salakaa balana vita a sita b dakva wana riju guvan gamanvala vyaapara ho palamu panthiya asun sandaha vattam aetidaeyi baelima pavaa nishphala kriyaawaki.""  This translates to ""...you need the ecological qualities of the palamu path (path of the old, sacred grove)!  Looking at other options, using the palamu path for business blessings is ineffective.""

Therefore, the palamu path is presented as unsuitable. The question is asking which path *isn't* suitable, and the text highlights the palamu path's specific requirements.
"
aprikaavata wetha wana mulu gaasthu mila ganan lowa puraa gaasthuwak samaga sansandanaya karana atharathura ekathu kala yuthu nowanne kumak da?,"The correct answer is **D: aprikaave pitatha sthaana sandaha bhoomi prawaahana piriwaeya**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What can be used to analyze the relationship between the number of tourist arrivals and the length of stay for tourists in Africa?""
* **The text states:** ""aprikaaaven pitatha aethi ema siyaluma sthaana sandaha athireka visa balapatra, pitathvime badhu, bhoomi pravaahanaya aadiya waeni amathara viyadam ekirimata amathaka nokaranna."" (All of this information regarding the location in Africa, such as extra visa documents, population density, and land flow, can be used to analyze the relationship between the number of tourist arrivals and the length of stay.)
* **Option D directly references:** ""pitatha sthaana sandaha bhoomi prawaahana piriwaeya"" (analyzing the relationship between the location in Africa and land flow).  While not a perfect match, ""land flow"" is a crucial element in understanding the geographical distribution and movement of people, which indirectly impacts tourist patterns.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: aprikaaven pitatha sthaana sandaha amathara visaa balapathra piriwaeya** (analyzing the relationship between the number of tourist arrivals and extra visa documents): Visa documents are related to entry, not necessarily length of stay.
* **B: aprikaave pitathweeme badu piriwaeya** (analyzing the relationship between population density and length of stay): Population density isn't a direct or significant factor in determining tourist length of stay.
* **C: aprikaanu visaa balapathrayaka piriwaeya** (analyzing the relationship between tourist visa documents and length of stay): Similar to A, visa documents don't directly correlate with length of stay.



Therefore, **D** is the most appropriate answer as it aligns with the information provided in the text and the question's focus on analyzing the relationship between tourist arrivals and length of stay.

"mema chedayata anuwa, supiri welandasael wadaath vividhaakara thereemak laba deemata patan gena aeththe kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: soodaanam kala aahara (balanced diet)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the importance of a balanced diet (soodaanam kala aahara) for overall well-being.** It mentions that obtaining nutrients through a balanced diet is crucial and lists various nutritious foods.
* **The question asks how to obtain a variety of nutrients.** A balanced diet is the primary way to achieve this.
* **The other options are not the central solution:**
    * **B: mayikrowew udun (microwave cooking):**  Cooking method, not the core solution for nutrient variety.
    * **C: e-thulama aethi awanhal (processed foods):** The text warns against processed foods, not promotes them as a way to get nutrients.
    * **D: daeriya haeki mila (dairy and milk):**  While dairy and milk can be part of a balanced diet, the text emphasizes a broader range of foods.

Therefore, a **balanced diet (soodaanam kala aahara)** is the most appropriate answer to the question about obtaining a variety of nutrients.



"
soodaanam kala aahara miladee gannaa paribhogikaya dirimath kala haekke samahara supiri welandasael magin sapayanu labana pahasukam walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: adu vividhaakara thoraa gaeneem (a variety of fresh fruits).**

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes a diet rich in fresh, varied fruits.** It specifically mentions ""supiri velaendasaelvala vividhaakara lesa soodaanam kala aahara"" which translates to ""a variety of fresh, colorful fruits.""  The passage repeatedly stresses the importance of including diverse fruits in one's diet for optimal health.

* **The question asks about ways to obtain a nutritious diet easily.**  A variety of fresh fruits is readily available and a cornerstone of a healthy diet as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: e-thulama aethi awanhal (highly processed foods):** The text *discourages* highly processed foods.
* **C: amu aahara (junk food):** The text implies avoiding junk food as it's not part of the recommended diet.
* **D: mayikrowew udunak (microwave cooked food):**  While not explicitly condemned, the focus of the text is on the *type* of food (fresh fruits) rather than the *method* of cooking. The text doesn't promote microwave cooking as a key to a healthy diet.

pransha bhaashawa katha karana beljiyam jaathikayan saha svitsarlantha jaathikayan visin awabodha kara gaeneemata nohaeki wanne pahatha sandahan de athurin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: pransha wachanawala aethaem uchchaarana (French word pronunciation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...beljiyame saha svitsarlanthaye kathaa kerena pransha bhaashave ankana kramaya pranshaye kathaa kerena pransha bhaashave evaata vadaa madak asaamaanyathavan aethi athara aetaem wachana uchcharanaya tharamak wenaswe.""  This translates to: ""...in Belgium and Switzerland, the order of French word pronunciation is considered unusual due to the pronunciation of words.""

The question asks what aspect of French pronunciation is *not* understood by the Belgian and Swiss people.  The passage directly links the difficulty in understanding French to its pronunciation.  Therefore, the pronunciation of French words is the aspect they don't readily grasp.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sammatha pransha ankana kramaya (standard French word order):** The passage implies that the *order* is understood, but the *pronunciation* is the problem.
* **B: suvisheshee pransha wachana (special French vocabulary):** The passage doesn't mention any difficulty with specialized vocabulary.
* **D: pranshaye waedipurama katha karana pransha bhaashawa (formal French language):** The passage doesn't discuss whether the language is formal or informal.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""...beljiyame saha svitsarlanthaye kathaa kerena pransha bhaashave ankana kramaya pranshaye kathaa kerena pransha bhaashave evaata vadaa madak asaamaanyathavan aethi athara aetaem wachana uchcharanaya tharamak wenaswe.""

This translates to: ""...in Belgium and Switzerland, the spelling of French words is not always the same as the way they are spoken.  The difference is primarily in the pronunciation of words.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: ankana kramaya (Spelling)** - The text explicitly says spelling *isn't* the issue.
* **C: pasalwala uganwanu labana sammatha pransha bhaashawa (A mutually agreed upon French language)** - While mutual agreement is important, the text focuses on the *pronunciation difference*.
* **D: samahara pransha wachanawala akshara vin‍yasaya (Character formation in French words)** -  This refers to how letters are combined, and the text doesn't address that.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The traveler is having trouble connecting to their connecting flight because of a lack of time between flights.
* **The passage then mentions:** Lufthansa and WestJet are sometimes able to help with this situation.
* **Option B aligns with this:** It suggests exploring the possibility of a ""connecting service"" (thewan parshweeya sewaawak) to help with the connection, indicating a willingness to help the traveler reach their final destination despite the time constraints.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: oba westjet samaga piyasara karanne nam (Choosing WestJet for the whole trip):** This doesn't address the core problem of the short layover.
* **C: oba lufthansa guvan yaanayakin paerisiye sita eksath janapadayata piyasara karanne nam (Choosing Lufthansa for the whole trip, flying through Paris):** This is a drastic change and doesn't solve the layover issue.
* **D: oba delta samaga piyasara karanne nam (Choosing Delta for the whole trip):** Similar to A, this doesn't fix the connecting flight problem.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Meva labaadena guvan samaagam athara eya kaenada, delta eyalains, eksath janapadayen ho kaenadaawen aarambha wana lufthaansa, saha westjet aetulat we. Saemavitama, oba guvan samaagama samaga rijuwa durakathanaya haraha aasana ven karava gatha yuthu ya.""  This translates to: ""Even though they operate flights to Canada, Delta Airlines, United, and Lufthansa and Westjet start from Canada.  However, it is a struggle to have a comfortable flight along with a long distance.""

* **Option D accurately reflects this statement.** It highlights the difficulty of achieving a comfortable flight when traveling long distances.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: awamangal‍ya gamanaagamana piriwaeya owun aawaranaya karayi** (it covers the negative travel experiences of arriving and departing). While the text mentions negative experiences, it's not the primary point.
* **B: ewa rijuwama guvan samaagame web adaviyen wenkarawa gatha yuthuya** (it is a struggle to have a comfortable flight along with a long distance). This is a repetition of a part of option D, but not as comprehensive.
* **C: ewa awasan mohothe sidu karana gamanwala piriwaeya aawaranaya karayi** (it covers the negative experiences of travel that are not achieved). This is not supported by the text.

Gps sanchaalana yedumakata wadaa thani jipeees upaangayak bhaavitha kirima pahasu wanne kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: oba mudal ithiri kirimata uthsaha karana vita** (When you try to initiate it first).

Here's why:

The paragraph states that to activate GPS, you need to *initiate* the process first.  The text emphasizes that GPS is not automatically active and requires a deliberate starting action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: obata daththa sambandhathawayak aethi bawata thahawuru wu vita** (When you are prompted with a related message): While a prompt *might* appear, it doesn't automatically activate GPS. You still need to take action.
* **C: oba sanngaa paraasayen pitathata yana vita** (When you go to a location related to your companions):  Your location relative to others doesn't automatically trigger GPS.
* **D: obata upaangayak kuliyata gaeneemata awashya naethi vita** (When it's not necessary to initiate a process): The paragraph explicitly states that initiating the process *is* necessary.



Therefore, the primary requirement mentioned for activating GPS is initiating the process, making option A the correct answer.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Obage maw raten pitatha saerisaerimata pahasuma ha saralama kramaya viya haeki ya. Gps sandaha nava sithiyam miladi gaeneema ho thanivama gps upangayak ho kaar kuliyata dene samaagamakin ekak kuliyata gaeneema magin mudal ithiri kara gatha haekiya.""  This translates to: ""You can easily and simply get location awareness with GPS, even without getting new firmware. GPS functionality can be enabled by simply setting a parameter in the device's configuration.""

* **The question asks:** What is the best reason to enable GPS functionality on a single device without using a separate device?

* **Option D directly reflects the passage's emphasis:**  It explicitly states that new firmware is *not* required. The passage highlights that GPS can be enabled through configuration parameters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: daththa sambandhathawayak pilibanda karadara viya yuthu naetha** (The data related to it has not been analyzed): This isn't a reason *to enable* GPS functionality.  Analysis might be useful, but it doesn't justify enabling the feature.
* **B: mudal ithiri kirima** (Initial setup): While initial setup is necessary, the passage says GPS functionality can be enabled *without* needing to get new firmware, regardless of the initial setup.
* **C: kuliyata gaeneemen waelakee siteema** (The way location awareness system works):  Understanding how the system works is important, but it's not the primary *reason* to enable GPS functionality. The reason is the ability to get location awareness.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer because it aligns with the passage's main point that GPS can be enabled without requiring new firmware, making it the simplest and most direct way to get location awareness."
mema chedayata anuwa obata wadaathma yogya nawkawak samaga gaelapena bawa sahathika kala haekke keseda?,"The best answer is **C: galapagos sanchaara visheshangayeku haraha wen karawa gaeneema (To accompany Galapagos tourism specialists on expeditions).**

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states the need to accompany Galapagos tourism specialists.**  The whole purpose of the expedition is to facilitate the specialists' work.
* **The prompt mentions providing support for their research.** Being a tourism specialist aligns with supporting their observations and data collection.
* **The other options are less directly relevant:**
    * **A (samaana unanduwak aethi mageen 8 kata wadaa pirisakata kandaayamak lesa wenkarawa gaeneema - To accompany a team of 8 people with similar experience and basic medical skills):** This is a general support role and doesn't focus on the core purpose of the expedition.
    * **B (adu senangak aethi samaya thula wenkarawa gaeneema - To accompany on expeditions at the convenience of the specialists):** While flexibility is good, it doesn't highlight specialized knowledge.
    * **D (kalthiya wenkarawa gaeneema - To accompany with a cook):**  A cook is important, but not the primary focus of fulfilling the request in the prompt.

Therefore, option C best addresses the specific requirements and objectives outlined in the prompt.

"mema chedayata anuwa, aaganthukayan sooduwa digatama karagena yamata ida salasana upaya maargayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: nomile mad‍yasara beema (Moderate alcohol)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that moderate alcohol consumption (mad‍yasara beema) can help with:

*   **Stress reduction:**  The passage directly mentions it can help reduce stress and anxiety.
*   **Improved cognitive function:** It mentions improving memory, thought processes, and alertness.
*   **Better sleep:** It implies better sleep by referencing the ""thabaa gaenimatat"" (rest/relaxation) mentioned.

The other options are not supported by the passage:

*   **A: swabhavika aalokaye bahulathwaya (Abundance of natural light):** The passage doesn't mention natural light.
*   **B: nomile sangeetha prasanga praweshapath waeni diri deemanaa (Listening to pleasant music):**  While music can be relaxing, the passage doesn't specifically link it to the benefits mentioned in the context of alcohol.
*   **D: oralosu nomaethi weema (Oral hygiene):**  Oral hygiene is unrelated to the cognitive and stress-reducing benefits described.

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, moderate alcohol consumption is the best answer.



"
"ema chedayata anuwa, daksha soodukaruweku walakwa gatha yuththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: oralosu ho ath oralosu pareekshaa kara baeleema** (Practicing oral skills and taking oral exams).

Here's why:

The provided text states that regular practice of oral skills and taking oral exams can significantly improve a skilled worker's ability to handle and manage situations effectively. The text explicitly links this to improved thinking, problem-solving, and overall competence.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: adhika lesa mathpaen paanaya kirima** (consuming more sugary drinks): This is likely detrimental to health and wouldn't improve skills.
*   **B: onaema dirigaenweemak piligaeneema** (extending the lifespan of equipment): This focuses on maintenance, not skill development.
*   **D: aasannathama pitaweema gaena vimasilimathwa siteema** (seeking immediate help in stressful situations): While seeking help is sometimes necessary, the text emphasizes proactive skill development rather than reliance on help.



Therefore, option C aligns directly with the text's emphasis on developing oral and communication skills for improved performance."
"mema chedayata anuwa, waak‍yayaka maeda kaepital akurin liyawena wachana panthiya kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: kriyaa pada (verb)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what part of speech the ""maeda kaepital akurin liyawena wachana panthiya"" (the word written in capital letters in the sentence) is. This phrase refers to the verb (action word) used in the sentence.  The sentence emphasizes the action of the verb and its importance in forming meaningful sentences.

Let's break down the original P question to understand:

* **""Oba sandaha wana Sie wachanaya da samaga...""** - This sets the context about the importance of verbs and sentence structure.
* **""...kriyaapada saha karma venkara handunaa gaenimata meya prayojanavat wana kramayaki.""** - This directly mentions the importance of verbs (""kriyaapada"" - verb) and their role in sentence construction.
* **""Samahara kriyaapada saha karma venkara handunaa gaenimata meya prayojanavat wana kramayaki.""** -  Reinforces the focus on verbs.

Therefore, the ""maeda kaepital akurin liyawena wachana panthiya"" is the verb.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, naama padayak kaepital akurin liweema magin wadaath apahasu wanne kumak da?","The correct answer is **C: liweema (writing)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What kind of action word is involved in writing a noun in capital letters?"" (mema chedayata anuwa, naama padayak kaepital akurin liweema magin wadaath apahasu wanne kumak da?)
* **The passage states:** ""Samahara kriyaapada saha karma venkara handunaa gaenimata meya prayojanavat wana kramayaki. Eya waadayata tududena lesa kiyavima vada pahasu karavana namuth, emagin kriyaa padayak ho naama visesanayak bhaavitha karanu labanne svaadhina aakarayen da yanna soyaagaeneeme awashyathaava hetuven liweema tharamak sankirna karavayi."" (A sequence of action words and karma is useful for the purpose. Even though it seems like a little bit of a thing to just say, the action word that is intended to be formed by expressing a noun in a free form and in capital letters has to be written.)

The passage directly connects writing a noun in capital letters to the action word **liweema (writing)**.  Options A, B, and D describe different actions, but the passage focuses on the act of *writing* itself.



"
"maelesiyawe graameeya pradeshawala, “enna” yanna adahas karanne kumana abhinaya magin da?","The correct answer is **B: atha waeneema**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...in pavasanne """"mehi enna"""" yanna wana athara, dabara aegilla sirura desata naemeema magin prakaasha kerena, aetaem batahira ratawala pamanak bhavitha wana ingiyata samaana wana athara, ekee katayutta sandaha pamanak bhaavitha kala yuthuve.""

This translates to: ""...in the springtime, they want to say """"mehi enna"""" because of the bright light of the new moon, it's like the country will be filled with its essence, and it's a period of spiritual activity.""

The question asks what kind of performance is associated with the rural people of Malaysia saying ""enna"". The passage connects ""enna"" with "" atha waeneema"" which is described as being like a ""new moon's light"" and a time of spiritual activity.  "" atha waeneema"" is mentioned as associated with a British character returning to his homeland and experiencing something similar to a new and bright dawn.

Therefore, **atha waeneema** is the performance associated with the rural people of Malaysia saying ""enna"".
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, “aapasu enna” yanna adahas karanne kumana abhinaya maginda?","The correct answer is **A: athla thaman desata harawa atha waeneema**

Here's why:

The question asks what the actor is imitating when saying ""aapasu enna"". The passage states:

""...spaangnaye dee brithaanya sanchaarakayeku, samu gaenimedi thaman desata athla haravagena karana atha waeneema (atha wananu labana pudhgalaya wetha nova)...""

This translates to: ""...like a British broadcaster who comes from a different country and does a certain imitation (or impersonation of someone)...""

Therefore, the actor is imitating a broadcaster from a different country. Option A, ""athla thaman desata harawa atha waeneema"" (an imitation of someone who comes from a different country and does a certain impersonation), best fits this description.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, irithaeleem walata hethu wanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: asthaayee glaesiyara (temporary glacier)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a temporary glacier:** The text states the glacier is ""staayi novena"" which translates to ""temporary."" It also mentions that the glacier is ""pahalata kadaa waete"" which means ""melted and returned"" implying a cyclical nature and temporary existence.
* **The question asks what caused the melting:** The question asks ""mema chedayata anuwa, irithaeleem walata hethu wanne kumakda?"" which means ""What caused the melting of the glacier?"". The passage directly links the melting to the ""hima paalam valin saengavi giya iritaeleem"" - ""the sun's rays that shone on the ice bridge.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hima paalam (ice bridge):** While the ice bridge (hima paalam) is mentioned as being affected by the sun, it's not the *cause* of the glacier's melting. The sun's rays act on the glacier, not just the bridge.
* **C: ayis guhaa kadaa waeteema (ice cave formation):**  Ice cave formation is a result of melting, not the cause.
* **D: lihil kutti (huge mass):**  This refers to the glacier's size and isn't related to the melting process.



Therefore, the temporary glacier is what melted due to the sun's rays.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, hima paalamen saengaviya haekke kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: irithaeleem**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""memagin hima paalam valin saengavi giya iritaeleem..."" which translates to ""imagine a glacier flowing towards Italy...""  This directly answers the question ""memachedayata anuwa, hima paalamen saengaviya haekke kawareda?"" (Where did the glacier flow?).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ayis guhaa (ice cave):**  While the passage mentions ice caves, it doesn't say the glacier flowed *to* an ice cave.
* **C: biththi (biththi - to be stuck/stuck):** This doesn't relate to the glacier's direction.
* **D: vishaala kutti (huge mass):** This refers to the glacier's size, not where it flowed.



"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, sanchaarakayin kumana sthaanayata paemineemata pera amathara poorwarakshaka piyawara gatha yuthuda?","The correct answer is **A: nayiragongo gini kanda**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nayiraegongo gini kanda naegimata aarambhaka sthaanaya menma, aprikaaave milen aduma kandukara gorillan naerambimata yaame sthaana valin ekak wanneda mema nagarayai.""

Translation: ""From the Virunga mountains, it is the starting point to approach the world's largest populations of mountain gorillas, and this city is located in that area.""

Therefore, the question asks where the traditional guards (amathara poorwarakshaka piyawara) protecting the city and its surroundings are stationed. The text directly links the gorillas and the guards to the Virunga mountains (Nayiraegongo gini kanda).



"
gomaa hi sanchaaraya karana sanchaarakayin sandaha honda upadesak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: yathurupaedi kulee ratha yanu gaman kirimata honda kramayaki (A good way to travel by foot)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes Gomaa as a city where communication is difficult.** It mentions the city's destruction in 2002, leading to displacement and hardship. It also highlights the difficult terrain and the need for cautious travel.
* **The text states that the foot is a suitable mode of travel in Gomaa.**  ""Gomaa vata yamata obata bodaa-bodaa (yaturupaedi kulee rathha) bhavitha kala haeka"" translates to ""Gomaa will teach you (the foot) to be suitable.""
* **Option C directly reflects this information.** It says that walking is a good way to travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: uthuru kiwu hi satan itha sithgannaa sulu ya (The north is a place where demons are found).** This is irrelevant and superstitious.
* **B: daeriya haeki kandukara gorillaa luhubaendeema sandaha eya honda sthaanayaki (It is a good place to see the Lhubaendeema gorilla, which is found in the forest).** While gorillas are in the area, this option doesn't address the core issue of difficult communication and travel *within* Gomaa.
* **D: nayiragongo gini kandukara gorillaa luhubaendeema sandaha eya honda sthaanayaki (It is a good place to see the Lhubaendeema gorilla, which is found in the forest).**  Again, irrelevant to the primary question about communication.



Therefore, option C is the only answer that accurately addresses the question based on the provided text."
agosthu maasaye wana aarambhaka dinaya sandaha pradesheeya awasara pathak laba gatha haekiwanu aeththe kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: maeyi 1 wana da**.

The passage states: ""Melesa, maeyi maasaye onaema aarambhaka dinayak sandaha wana praadeshiya avasara pathak janavari 1 wanada sita labaagata haeki ya."" This translates to ""Therefore, the local emergency pathak should be obtained on May 1st.""

Therefore, the local emergency pathak should be obtained on May 1st."
kaeniyan aarakshaa kirima sandaha kriyathmaka karana lada prathipaththiya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: seemitha awasara path sankyawak (limited quota of emergency pathak)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""seemitha sankhyavak sandaha avasara labaa dee atha"" which translates to ""a limited number of emergency pathak can be obtained.""
* **Option D directly reflects this statement.**  It highlights the restriction on the number of emergency pathak available.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: palamuwa paemini ayata palamuwa awasarapath laba deeme kriyawaliya (actions taken to obtain a path from the bridge authority)** - While actions are *taken*, the passage doesn't focus on the *actions themselves*, but on the *limitation of the path*.
* **B: awasara path laba gatha haekke janawaari 1 wana dina pamani (those who obtain emergency pathak can do so by January 1st)** - This relates to the deadline, not the limitation of the quota.
* **C: awasara path laba gatha haekke pudgalikawa paemina ayadum kirima haraha pamani (those who obtain emergency pathak can do so by applying within a certain period)** - This is about the application period, not the number of available paths.

mema chedaye visthara kara aethi hotal wargawala awama washayen soya gaeneemata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: prasiddha ho handunaagatha haeki sesu aaganthukayan (Famous and frequently visited guests)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that Samahara Hotel is known for attracting wealthy and famous people, including high-ranking officials and government figures.  It mentions the hotel's luxurious amenities cater to various tastes, including those of powerful individuals.  This strongly suggests that a significant aspect of the hotel's reputation and success comes from having famous and frequently returning guests.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: koktel baar ekak (A cocktail bar):** While a cocktail bar might exist, the passage doesn't highlight it as a defining characteristic of the hotel's appeal.
* **B: ema sthaanayema aethi gormut awanhalak (A restaurant with a good atmosphere):** The passage mentions excellent dining and nightly entertainment, but it doesn't emphasize the atmosphere as a *primary* draw. The luxuriousness and prestige seem more important.
* **D: naweena waedidiyunu kirim sahitha maethakadee naweekaranaya karana lada kamara (A room with a newly renovated bathroom and other upgrades):** The passage mentions that the hotel caters to different tastes, including those of prominent individuals, but it doesn't specifically focus on room renovations as a major selling point.

"mema chedaye dakwa aethi thorathuru walata anuwa, hotal aaganthukayan awama pramukhathawaya deemata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan pirinaemeem walin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: keerthimath supawediyaku samaga awanhalak (Being associated with a famous and elegant gathering).**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that the Samahara hotel is known for:

*   Being frequented by wealthy and famous people.
*   Offering luxurious dining and nighttime entertainment.
*   Providing a sophisticated and elegant atmosphere.

The question asks *why* the hotel is so popular. Option B, ""Being associated with a famous and elegant gathering,"" directly reflects this key aspect. The hotel's reputation is built on its connection to high-profile individuals and its association with a refined lifestyle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hotalaya puraawatama pawuraanika gruha bhaanda (The hotel's antique household items):** While the passage mentions ""golden age"" and ""historic atmosphere,"" it doesn't highlight antique items as a primary draw.
*   **C: raathree vinodaswadaya laba dena viwekagarayak (A place to get nighttime entertainment):** The hotel does offer entertainment, but the passage frames it as part of a broader luxury experience, not just a place for entertainment.
*   **D: daeriya haeki kaamara gaasthu (A place for discreet and private meetings):** The passage doesn't mention the hotel as a place for private or discreet meetings."
greenlanthaye sanchaaraya karana sanchaarakayin visin waelakee sitiya yuthu wanne mewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: antharjala sambandhathawaya durwala viya haeki baevin ehi sitiyadee waeda kirimata balaaporoththu weema (Ensuring internet connectivity is reliable in that location).**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""nagaravala pavaa """"avadaanam sthaana"""" nomaeta. Samahara vita soodaanam naettavun muhunapaana ekama saebae anatura seetha kaalagunayai. Oba seethala irthuwala dee grinlantayata paeminenne nam (oba thavat uthurata yana bawath eya thavat seethala bawath adahas kara), pramaanavat taram unusum aendum gena yaama athyavasyay. Sarath irtuve digu dina nisaa pramaanavat nindak labyma pilibanda gaetalu saha e samaga baedhunu soukya gaetalu aethiviya haeki ya.""

This translates to: ""In cities, it's not easy to get a reliable connection. Therefore, you must bring with you the necessary equipment. For the long days of Sarath's stay, it is necessary to have reliable internet and comfortable connections.""

This emphasizes the importance of a *reliable internet connection* when traveling to Greenland. Option C directly addresses this need"
"mema chedayata anuwa, soodaanamakin thorawa greenlanthayata paeminena sanchaarakayin sandaha gaetalu sahagatha viya haekke pahatha sandahan karunu atharin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: kaalagunaya (ice)**.

Here's why:

The text repeatedly emphasizes the importance of proper clothing, specifically mentioning ""seetha kaalagunayai"" which translates to ""ice age"" or ""very cold ice.""  It stresses the need for appropriate thermal underwear and other warm gear to survive the cold environment of Greenland. Therefore, ice/cold weather conditions are paramount when traveling to Greenland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: nordik maduruwan (Nordic people):** While relevant to Greenland's population, it's not the primary concern regarding the traveler's gear.
*   **B: aparaadha (crime):** Crime is mentioned as a general concern but not directly related to what the traveler needs to pack.
*   **D: pradeshawaseen (state-dwelling/regional dwelling):** This is not a relevant concept in the context of packing for a trip to Greenland.



"
daen madhyama welanda sankeernaya lesa bhaavitha karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **D: Kaelejon dell beso**.

The text describes a garden, a complex, and a location called ""Kaelejon dell beso"" (Garden of the Kiss). The question asks what the complex was like, and the text mentions it was ""lesa kriyaatmaka"" (slightly active/dynamic) and connected to ""Kaelejon dell beso.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jardin di laa yuniyan** - This refers to the garden itself, not the complex.
* **B: da aele of da kis** - This is not mentioned in the text.
* **C: templo di saen diyego** - While a temple is mentioned, the complex is specifically linked to ""Kaelejon dell beso"".



Therefore, **Kaelejon dell beso** is the best answer as it is the only location explicitly tied to the description of the complex."
"mema chedayata anuwa, jardin di laa yuniyan hi soyagatha nohaekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: sangeetha prasanga sahitha madhyama mandapaya (a central pavilion with musical performances)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a garden with a central pavilion (""madyama velanda sankeernayak"") where musical performances (""prasanga paewaethway"") took place. It also mentions the presence of musicians (""sangeetha prasanga"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: paerani aadara andarayaka niwaahana (the welcoming of honored guests):** While honored guests were present, this isn't the *main* feature described in the garden layout.
* **C: ud‍yaanayata muhunalaa aethi awanhal (the avanhal facing the garden):**  The passage mentions avanhal (likely statues or decorative elements), but it says they were *in* the garden, not specifically facing it.
* **D: paerani konwant godanaegillak (the welcoming of honored guests):** This is a repetition of option B.



"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, dinaka kandu naegeema pilibanda pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen niwaeradi nowana bawa salakanu labana prakaashaya kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: madhyastha washayen sawukya sampannawa sitina pudgalayinta mema kriyaakaarakama rasa vindeemata haekiya.**

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks what information is needed to obtain a clear understanding of the day's activities.
* **The passage (P)** emphasizes the importance of understanding the day's events and actions. It highlights the need for clear communication and a way to connect with those who can provide valuable insights. It also mentions the necessity of a mediator/intermediary who can facilitate this connection.
* **Option C** directly addresses this need for an intermediary/mediator (madhyastha washayen) who is comfortable and capable (sawukya sampannawa sitina) to provide the necessary information (rasa vindeemata haekiya).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While asking simple questions is good, it doesn't fully capture the need for a mediator.
* **B:**  Distant communication alone isn't sufficient; a way to create a clear understanding of the day's events is needed.
* **D:**  Focusing solely on the mediator needing to be in a place with wood is too narrow.  The core issue is the mediator's ability to provide information.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate reflection of the information needed to understand the day's activities, as implied by the passage.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, dinaka kandu naegeema sandaha itha awama soodaanamak awashya wanne kawadada?","The correct answer is **D: kandu naegeema wadaath swabhavika parisarayaka siduwana vita** (when the digestion is aligned with the natural environment).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of natural harmony.** The text repeatedly mentions ""svaabhaavika parisara"" (natural environment) and the need for everything to be in accordance with it.
* **The question asks about the condition for necessary digestion.** The passage implies that digestion is necessary when the body is in harmony with its surroundings, particularly concerning the sun's movement and the consumption of food.  A healthy digestive process is linked to aligning with nature's cycles.
* **Option D directly reflects this core concept.** It suggests that digestion is necessary when the body's digestive process aligns with the natural environment.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: kandu naginnaa sawukya sampannawa sitina vita** (when the digestion is already healthy): The passage is about *necessity* for digestion, not just maintaining health.
* **B: eya pahasu adi parakata sambandha wu vita** (when it's related to the sun's cycle): While the sun's cycle is mentioned, it's not the *only* condition for necessary digestion.  The overall environmental alignment is key.
* **C: lamayin kandu naegeemata yana vita** (when the digestion is going smoothly): Similar to A, this describes a state of health, not necessity.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer, as it aligns with the central theme of the passage about natural harmony and the necessity of digestion when in sync with the environment."
norwe hi anekuth pradesha ha sasandana vita rogaland ho aegdel saanuwa hi aethi wenasa kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: ewa boho vita hedar walin aawaranaya wee aetha**.

Here's why:

The original Sinhala text describes Rogaland and Aegderhi as having many isolated (sasandana vita) areas, and that these areas are connected by a lack of roads (hedar walin aawaranaya wee aetha - meaning ""covered by a lack of roads"").  The question asks how the ""saanuwa"" (presumably meaning ""health"" or ""wellness"") of Rogaland and Aegderhi is maintained, given this isolation. The text implies that the lack of access makes it difficult to receive regular medical attention.

Let's break down the options:

*   **A: ehi gas aetha** (yes, there is gas) - Irrelevant to the question of healthcare access.
*   **B: kandu athara patu kalapu nae** (there are no mountains in the area) - Irrelevant to the question of healthcare access.
*   **C: saanuwa boho durata pulul we** (health is very far away) - While it acknowledges distance, it doesn't fully capture the core issue of isolated communities and lack of accessible resources.
*   **D: ewa boho vita hedar walin aawaranaya wee aetha** (a lack of roads covers the area) - This directly addresses the core problem of the isolated areas, which is the lack of roads, thus making access to healthcare difficult.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, norwehi saaman‍ya lakshanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: wanaanthara saanuwa (subarctic climate)**.

Here's why:

The text describes Norway as having a ""viddae"" (tundra) type of landscape, characterized by:

* **Baevum kandu kalapu saha ihala (Peat bogs, heath, and tundra)** - This directly points to tundra vegetation.
* **Samathalaa bhava (Flat terrain)** -  Tundra regions are often flat.
* **Vivurta gas rahitha avakaashayak (Open, treeless space)** - Tundra is known for its lack of trees.
* **Aseemitha pulul kireemak yana arthaya aethi ""viddae"" (The meaning of unlimited grazing):** Tundra is suitable for grazing animals.

The text also mentions that the climate is often harsh and that even hardy plants are like ""rootless shrubs"" (shaakha rahitha gohoru bima) – again indicative of a subarctic environment.

Therefore, the core characteristic of Norway being described is its **subarctic climate (wanaanthara saanuwa)**.



Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: viwurtha bhoomi pradesha (Widespread terrain):** While Norway has varied terrain, the text focuses on the specific tundra landscape.
* **C: baewum sahitha kandu athara patu kalapu (Peat bogs with rocky areas):**  Peat bogs are a part of the tundra, but the broader climate is the defining factor.
* **D: moorlands:** Moorlands are found in cooler temperate regions, not the harsh subarctic conditions described.



"
skee kreedaawata unanduwak dakwana sanchaarakayin kandukara sthaanawalata paeminiya yuththe kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: indiyaanu sarath irthuwe dee**.

Here's why:

* **The first paragraph describes Sarath's journey to a specific location (Kandukara).**  It mentions the journey takes a long time and is undertaken in cold weather.  He reaches a beautiful and amazing place at the end.

* **The second question asks about the mode of transportation to Kandukara.**

* **Option C, ""indiyaanu sarath irthuwe dee"" (Indian Sarath's vehicle), is the only option that logically follows from the first paragraph.**  It implies Sarath uses his vehicle (presumably a car or similar) to travel to Kandukara.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sheetha irthuwe dee (cold vehicle):** While the journey is cold, it doesn't refer to the *type* of vehicle.
* **B: uparima sanchaarakayin aethi samaye dee (high-speed vehicle):** The first paragraph states the journey is *long*, not necessarily fast.
* **D: wasanthaye dee (spring):** The first paragraph explicitly states the journey occurs in cold weather, not spring.



Therefore, option C is the most logical and accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kandukara sthaanawala saaman‍yayen waedima sanchaarakayin pramaanayak sitinne kawadada?","The correct answer is **A: adhika himapathanaya atharathura** (increased snowfall is the reason).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Indiyaanu sarath srituvae dee kandukara sthana saamanyayen sanchaaraka samayae uparimayata paemine.""  This translates to: ""During the Indian winter, the travel time to the snowy region is usually prolonged.""

* **The passage then explains *why* the travel time is prolonged:** ""Kese namudu, sitha kaalaye dee hima matha lissaa yaama saha hima puvaru matha lissaa yaama wani kriyaakaarakam labaadiya haeki saaravath himapathanayak boho kandukara sthaanayanta labi, evaata venasma aakaraye sundaratvayak haa chamatkaarayak labadhe."" This translates to: ""Because of the heavy snowfall and the icy conditions, the journey to the snowy region is difficult and challenging, but it achieves a wonderful beauty and wonder.""

Therefore, the reason for the prolonged travel time is the **heavy snowfall**.  Option A directly addresses this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hima puwaruwe lissa yana samaya puraawatama** (the earliest time for icy conditions) - While icy conditions contribute to difficulty, the main reason for the *prolonged* travel time is the snowfall, not just the icy conditions.
* **C: indiyaanu sarath irthuwe dee** (the Indian winter) - This is the season, not the reason for the travel time.
* **D: sheetha irthuwe masa puraawatama** (the earliest month of winter) - This is a specific time period within the winter, not the reason for the travel time.



"
oba udaw sandaha bottuwak soya gaeneemata balaaporoththu wanne nam oba kumak kirimen waelakee sitiya yuthuda?,"The correct answer is **C: obe sewaawan prachaaraya kirima (Promoting your services)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes a situation where someone is trying to achieve success by utilizing a ""bottu"" (likely a lucky charm or amulet).**  The text emphasizes attracting helpful people and resources.
* **The question asks what action someone should take to increase the chances of getting a lucky charm.**
* **Option C directly aligns with the text's underlying message:** Promoting your services (or skills/abilities) is a proactive way to attract opportunities and assistance, aligning with the idea of bringing helpful people into your life.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: thatakaye ihalata ha pahalata aevideema (Go to the front and back of the temple):** While potentially a traditional practice, the text doesn't explicitly mention temple rituals as a key element to success.
* **B: kapithanwarun samaga mithra weema (Become friends with the captain):**  Becoming friends with someone powerful *could* be helpful, but it's a reactive approach. The text encourages proactive measures.  The text is more about attracting the right people than cultivating specific relationships.
* **D: bottuwe gaman karana sesu aya nosalaka haereema (Don't say anything about the journey of the lucky charm):** This is irrelevant to the question of how to *get* a lucky charm in the first place.



Therefore, **C** is the most logical and textually supported answer."
udaw awashya wana bottuwak soyamin gaman karana vita kudaa waraaya pilibandawa wataha gatha yuththe kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: waedi awadhaanayak wethin waelakee siteema (Exercise caution within the well's vicinity).**

Here's why:

The original text (P) warns about the dangers of a well. It mentions that the well's depth is hard to know, and people might not be aware of the current's strength.  It emphasizes avoiding falling into the well and the dangers associated with it.

Option B directly reflects this warning by advocating for caution near the well. The other options are not relevant to the dangers described in the text:

*   **A: naeviyan samaga sambandhatha paewaethweema (Engaging in conversation with sailors):** This is irrelevant to the well's safety.
*   **C: yaathrawa pirisidu karana vita pamanak owun wetha langaa weema (People who are traveling should stay close):** This doesn't address the well's inherent dangers.
*   **D: bottuwe gaman karana sesu ayagen waelakee siteema (Stay away from the well when traveling):** While staying away is good advice, ""waedi awadhaanayak wethin waelakee siteema"" is more comprehensive and aligns better with the text's emphasis on being cautious *within* the well's vicinity, even if you can't avoid it entirely.

diwayine yatath vijitha ithihasaya gaena unanduwak dakwana aaganthukayan aakarshanaya karanne kumana sthaanayada?,"The correct answer is **C: hon kong nagara madyasthaanaya (Hong Kong city center)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Hon Kong hi hondama darshana labaa gaeneema sandahaa, diwayinen pitath wee prativiruddha kovloon jala muhanatha desata yanna. Hon kong ahas ima sakasana godanaegili pela, viktoriyaa varaaye jala thalaya magin drushyamaana wana didulana sthambha prasthaarayakata samaana kara aetha.""
* **Translation:** ""Hong Kong offers a good view, you can see the contrasting Kowloon waterfront from the busy city center. Hong Kong has grown to be as tall as Victoria Harbour's water tower.""
* **The question asks:** ""diwayine yatath vijitha ithihasaya gaena unanduwak dakwana aaganthukayan aakarshanaya karanne kumana sthaanayada? (Where do tourists come to see the historical legacy of the colonial era?)""
* **The passage implies:** The historical legacy of the colonial era is evident in the city center, where you can see the contrast between the old and new, and the juxtaposition of Kowloon waterfront.

Therefore, the city center is the most logical answer.



"
vishmaya janaka darshana walata pramukhathawaya dena sanchaarakayekuta wadaa aakarshaneeya wanne kumana sthaanayada?,"The correct answer is **C: hon kong doopatha**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Hon kong ahas ima sakasana godanaegili pela, viktoriyaa varaaye jala thalaya magin drushyamaana wana didulana sthambha prasthaarayakata samaana kara aetha."" (Hong Kong has a spectacular view, with towering columns resembling Victoria Harbour's water-level promenade.)
* It also mentions: ""Hon kong hi hondama darshana labaa gaeneema sandahaa, diwayinen pitath wee prativiruddha kovloon jala muhanatha desata yanna."" (Hong Kong offers a good view, with a striking contrast of the Kowloon waterfront.)
* However, the opening sentence establishes that Hong Kong's *Dopatha* (likely referring to the Hong Kong Peninsula) is the primary area where visitors focus for a spectacular view.

Therefore, the question asks where to attract a visitor with a prominent view, and the passage points to the Hong Kong Peninsula (Hon Kong Dopatha).



"
ashwarohakayage paadaya pa patiyata hira weememe avadaanama awama kirimata upakaree wana saedalaye kotasa kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: patu yati pathul (Boot sapattu palanditi)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the need for boots and protective gear (aarakshaava pilibada gaetalu) for forest rangers to effectively perform their duties. Specifically, it mentions rangers needing to traverse difficult terrain, including dense vegetation, and that their feet need protection.  The phrase ""boot sapattu palanditi"" directly translates to ""boots and shoes,"" indicating footwear suitable for challenging forest conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aarakshitha theeru (Protected tree):** While protecting trees is part of a ranger's job, it doesn't directly relate to what they need on their feet for walking and working.
* **C: sam paa pati (Same foot/leg):** This is too general and doesn't specify the kind of gear needed.
* **D: waedi sthaawarathwayak (Medicinal plant):**  Medicinal plants are relevant to forest rangers, but again, not to the footwear they require.



"
paa pati bhaavitha karana vita asaruwage aarakshaawa waedi kirimata upakaree wana boot sapaththu wala kumana angayada?,"The correct answer is **A: ralu, patu pathula**.

Here's why:

The text states that the guards used boots with ""ralu"" (toe protection) and ""patu pathula"" (hard soles) to protect their feet while patrolling.  This is because they needed protection from sharp objects, uneven terrain, and potentially hazardous conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ham** - This doesn't relate to footwear features.
* **C: vilumba** - This means delay or hesitation, which is irrelevant.
* **D: pulul pathula** - While ""pathula"" means sole, ""pulul"" doesn't have a relevant meaning in this context.  The text specifically mentions ""patu pathula"" (hard soles).



Therefore, the only option that accurately reflects the boots used by the guards is **ralu, patu pathula**."
aaganthuka sathkara huwamaru jala haraha sanchaarakayinta laba denne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **B: laabha guvan gaman (Profit-driven travel)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Samahara jaalayan athireka sathyaapanaya labaa deemata ho awashya vuvada..."" which translates to ""The network must necessarily provide profit for its shareholders...""
* **The text also mentions:** ""...pariganaka kramalekhakayeku wana keysi fentan ayislanthayata laabhadaayi guvan gamanak soyagaat namuth..."" This translates to ""...the calculation script for a certain Fentan island was calculated to be profitable for travel...""
* **Therefore, the entire passage revolves around a network (likely a travel network) aiming for profit and using travel as a means to achieve it.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: desheeya sathkarakayan samaga nawathaen (Partnership with national dignitaries):** While partnerships *might* be beneficial, the core focus of the text is on profit generation through travel, not specifically partnerships with dignitaries.
* **C: desheeya margopadeshakayin visin laba dena sanchaara (Profit-generating travel based on national guidance):** The text doesn't mention any national guidance influencing the travel.
* **D: ekama gamanaanthayata paeminena anekuth sanchaarakayin samaga sambandhatha (Relating to multiple carriers based on a single destination):** This describes a network structure, but the key driver of this structure, according to the text, is profit.



"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, aaganthuka sathkara huwamaru jala sambandhayen sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashayangen kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: samahara jaalawalata sanchaarakayange athireka sathyaapana kirim awashya viya haeka** (It is necessary for the carrier to verify the additional information in the network).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the necessity of verifying information in the network.** The text explicitly states, ""Meelangata, labaa gatha haeki thaanaayamkaruwange layisthuwak mudrithava saha/ho maargagatava, samahara vita wenath sanchaarakayinge yomu kireem saha samaalochana da samaga sapayanu labayi."" (Therefore, along with the carrier's verified information and/or route, the profit obtained was also achieved through the carrier's communication and deliberation.)  This highlights the need for verification.
* **The passage describes a situation where the carrier obtained a large amount of electricity information.** This information needs to be validated to ensure its accuracy.
* **Option B directly addresses this need for verification within the network.** The passage strongly implies that this verification is crucial.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sanchaarakayinta saema vitama desheeya sathkarakayan wetha yomu kirim sidu karanu laebe** (The carrier can obtain a large amount of information from the national honor).  This is too specific and not directly supported by the passage. The passage doesn't say the carrier *obtained* information from national honor, but rather *verified* information in the network.
* **C: gamanaantha nagaraye aethi sathkarakayinge laeyisthuwak sanchaarakayinta laba denu aetha** (The carrier can receive profit from the information of the national honor who came to the destination city). This is also too specific and not a central theme in the passage.
* **D: desheeya sathkaraka pilibanda samalochana samahara vita sanchaarakayinta laba gatha haekiya** (The carrier could have obtained profit through deliberation about the national honor). This is speculative and not directly supported by the passage.  The passage focuses on verification, not deliberation.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer because it reflects the core message of the passage regarding the need for verification within the network."
"mema chedayata anuwa, hawul nevaasikagara kaamarayaka awama washayen daekagatha haekke kumana aakaraye aaganthukayinda?","The correct answer is **D: wayasa mul visi gananwala wu aaganthukayek** (an intruder who estimates age).

Here's why:

* **The first passage (P)** describes a situation where an intruder is searching for a young girl (""tharuna udaviyata""). They are trying to figure out her age (""navaathaen gannekuge saamanya vayasa visi ganan we"").  The passage implies they are looking for someone young and vulnerable.

* **The second passage (Q)** asks what kind of intruder would be looking for a young girl, specifically asking about the ""aaganthukayinda"" (intruder) - essentially, what type of person is doing this.

* **Option D** directly reflects the information in passage P - an intruder who estimates age.  The other options are less precise. Options B and C suggest specific behaviors, while Option A is too general.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and logically consistent answer based on the context of both passages."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, nevaasikagarayaka raendee siteemata boho durata ida aeththe kawuda?","The correct answer is **B: ekata gaman karana 22 haeviridi thidenek (a friend who is 22 years old)**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement:** Nevaasikaagaara mulika washayen tharuna udaviyata - navaathaen gannekuge saamanya vayasa visi ganan we - pahasukam sapayana namuth, vayasin waedi sanchaarakayin da obata evayehi dee nithara hamuviya haekiya. Daruvan sitina pavul durlabha dasunaki, namuth samahara nevasikaagaraa ovunta paudgalika kaamaravala ida labaa dei.  (Rough Translation:  To get a young helper in the sewage system, one usually looks for someone around the average age. Although it's difficult to find a young person,  it's possible to find someone who knows the sewer system).  This implies Nevaasikaagaraa (sewer workers) often need help and might rely on younger individuals.

* **Q's question:** mema chedaya matha padanamwa, nevaasikagarayaka raendee siteemata boho durata ida aeththe kawuda? (Rough Translation:  For my work, if I need someone close to the sewage system, who is suitable?)  This seeks a suitable person for sewer work.

* **Analyzing the options:**

    * **A: alutha upan bilindeku samaga gaman karana yuwalak (a friend who goes along with the new apprentice)** -  This is less likely. The question asks for someone *suitable* for the work, not just a friend accompanying an apprentice.

    * **B: ekata gaman karana 22 haeviridi thidenek (a friend who is 22 years old)** - This is the most logical. 22 is a reasonable age for someone to be able to help with sewer work, balancing experience with physical ability.  It aligns with P's statement about looking for young helpers.

    * **C: 70 gananwala yuwalak (a friend who is 70 years old)** -  70 is too old for physically demanding sewer work.

    * **D: Daruvan sitina pavul durlabha dasunaki (a friend who is difficult to find because he lives in the forest)** -  This is completely irrelevant to the topic.


Therefore, the best answer is **B**.  It presents a person of a reasonable age and suggests someone with potential knowledge of the sewer system.

"mema chedayata anuwa, boomarang visi kirima niwaeradiwa visthara karanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: Ost‍reliyawe boho boomarang nomaetha.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:**  What is the reason why the art of throwing boomerangs is gaining popularity?
* **The text states:** ""Owustreliyave daknata haeki boomarangawalin waedi hariyak apasu paeminenne naetha."" (It is said that boomerangs were used for hunting by the aborigines in Australia.)
* **Therefore:** The popularity of boomerang throwing is likely connected to its historical use and association with Aboriginal Australians, specifically in Australia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A:** While you can practice alone, the text focuses on the cultural significance and historical use of boomerangs, not just individual practice.
* **B:** While boomerangs might be popular in some regions, the text doesn't specifically state that's *why* it's gaining popularity. The Australian connection is a stronger link.
* **D:**  The text mentions that modern boomerangs are easier to throw, but it doesn't relate that to the reason for increased popularity.



"
jaavaanu aahara piseemedee pradhaana washayen bhaavitha karanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: pol seeni**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""jaavaa vaesiyange pradhaanathama rasakaraka wanne ratakaju, miris, seeni (visesayen jaawaani **pol seeni**) saha vividha suvandaeti kulubadu ya.""  This translates to: ""The main flavor in Javanese cuisine is galangal, chili, salt (especially **Javanese palm sugar**), and various spices and herbs.""  While other ingredients are mentioned, *pol seeni* (palm sugar) is specifically highlighted as a key ingredient.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, bowana roga paethirenne keseda?","The correct answer is **A: aasaditha pudgalayin (susceptible individuals)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bovena rogayak yanu asadita pudhgalayeku laga siteemen pahasuven walandiya haeki rogayaki.""  This translates to: ""A highly infectious disease can spread to susceptible individuals.""

* **A: aasaditha pudhgalayin (susceptible individuals)** - This directly reflects the statement in the passage.
* **B: rogakaraka (pathogens)** - While pathogens (like viruses, bacteria, etc.) *cause* the disease, the passage focuses on *who* is vulnerable.
* **C: baekteeriya (bacteria)** - Bacteria are a type of pathogen, but again, the passage emphasizes the vulnerability of individuals.
* **D: ennath (anything)** - This is too broad and doesn't accurately reflect the passage's focus.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, bowana rogayak rogayak aethiweemata hethuwak nowana lesa handunaagena aeththe meyin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: vairas (virus)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that viruses, bacteria, and delirium can all cause serious illnesses. It also mentions that many countries regularly communicate information about various diseases to neighboring countries. Finally, it asks what could be the cause of a serious illness that is spreading rapidly.

Viruses are known for their ability to spread quickly and cause widespread illness.  While bacteria and delirium can also be serious, viruses are often the primary culprits in rapidly spreading epidemics.  Therefore, the most likely answer based on the context is a virus.

athathya pudgalika jaala saepayumkaruweku wenuwata web proksiyak thoraa gaeneema parisheelakayata pramaanawath wanne kumana awasthaawedee da?,"The correct answer is **B: waaranaya saha oththu baeleema haekithak walakwa gaeneemata parisheelakaya saelakilimath wana vita.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:**  ""Eva hetu kihipayak nisa web proxy valata vada hondaya: http pamanak nova, siyaluma antharjaala dattha gaman eva pratiyomu karayi."" (This is why using a web proxy is good: it forwards all internet data requests and responses.)  And ""...Ovun saamanyayen ihala kalaapa palalak saha vada honda sevaavak labaa dei."" (They generally don't get good performance or service.)
* **The question asks:** ""athathya pudgalika jaala saepayumkaruweku wenuwata web proksiyak thoraa gaeneema parisheelakayata pramaanawath wanne kumana awasthaawedee da?"" (What is the necessary state for a surveillance system to be equivalent to using a web proxy in the context of an athathya pudgalika jaala?)
* **The core concept:**  A web proxy intercepts and forwards *all* internet traffic.  A surveillance system aiming for equivalence would need to do the same.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: parisheelakayata siyalu gaman daththa prathiyomu kirimata awashya vita** (The surveillance system must forward all internet data requests and responses). While correct in principle, it doesn't capture the nuances of *why* a proxy is good – it's the *performance/service* aspect that's often lacking with proxies.
    * **C: parisheelakayata pradhaana washayen antharjala gaman daththa prathiyomu kirimata awashya vita** (The surveillance system primarily needs to forward internet data requests and responses). This is too limited.  A proxy's value extends beyond just forwarding; it also can improve performance.
    * **D: parisheelakayage kriyaakaarakam sandaha madhyastha sita ihala mattame kalaapa palalak awashya wana vita** (The surveillance system's action should be a mediating state, only affecting the performance).  This is incorrect; a proxy affects *all* traffic, not just performance.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the passage and the question.  A surveillance system to act as an equivalent proxy needs to intercept and forward *all* traffic.  However, the passage emphasizes the performance shortcomings of typical proxies and implicitly suggests the surveillance system should address this deficiency while acting as a mediator.

"mema chedayata anuwa, athathya pudgalika jala saha web proksi pilibanda sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: athathya pudgalika jaala saaman‍yayen web proksi walata wadaa waedi kalaapa palalak laba deyi**

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the true statement about the difference between the Onion Network (athathya pudgalika jaala) and Web Proxies.**
* **The provided text explicitly states:** ""Ovun saamanyayen ihala kalaapa palalak saha vada honda sevaavak labaa dei."" (They generally don't get the benefits of high-quality performance and good services.)  ""Ovun"" refers to the Onion Network.
* **Option A directly reflects this statement.** It accurately says that the Onion Network doesn't provide the benefits that Web Proxies do.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: web proksi hata siyalu web gaman daththa prathiyomu kala nohaeka** (Web proxies don't provide complete anonymity.) While true, this isn't *specifically* about the difference between the Onion Network and Web Proxies. The text focuses on performance and service quality.
* **C: athathya pudgalika jaala ha sasandana vita web proksi sewaawe gunathmakabhaawaya aduya** (The Onion Network and Web Proxies have similar qualities.)  The text clearly implies they *differ* significantly in their performance and service quality.
* **D: athathya pudgalika jaala hata antharjala gaman daththa pamanak prathiyomu kala haekiya** (The Onion Network doesn't provide complete anonymity.) While the Onion Network offers *more* anonymity than a Web Proxy, it's not entirely anonymous.  This is a nuanced point, and the text doesn't directly address the level of anonymity. The main point is about performance.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the text.



"
yamekuta owunge jiwath wana pradeshayen pitatha durakathana samaagamak bhaavitha kirimata ida denne kumak da?,"The correct answer is **D: PSTN durakathana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...obata oba jivath wana pradeshaye pihiti durakathana samaagamak bhaavitha kirimata awashya nove. Bohovita, oba wetha ptsn durakathanavalin aematima sandaha ida dene wenama jaatyantara ankayak mila dee gatha yutuya.""  This translates to: ""...it is not necessary for you to be affected by far-reaching connections in your life in the province. Often, if you provide information about the PSTN long-distance connections, you have encountered an inter-state number.""

This directly links PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) long-distance connections to the possibility of encountering inter-state numbers, implying that PSTN long-distance is a relevant factor related to far-reaching connections and the issue discussed in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: antharjaala prathiyomu aemathum (internet communication):** While internet communication *can* be far-reaching, the passage specifically mentions PSTN long-distance as the context.
* **B: goleeya durakathana anka (global long-distance number):**  While a global long-distance number is far-reaching, the passage focuses on the PSTN as the relevant connection type.
* **C: chandrika (moon):** This is completely unrelated to the topic of long-distance connections or numbers.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, yam aemathum laba gaeneema sandaha kumak kala yuthuda?","The correct answer is **C: obe pradesheeya prajawen ankayak laba gaeneema** (your people gain a benefit).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that the goal is for the people of the region to benefit from the internet.** The text explicitly states ""obata oba jivath wana prajaaven desiya ankayak labaa gaeneeme awashyathavayak da nomaeta"" (it is necessary that your people gain a benefit).  The other options are either consequences of that benefit (like reduced need for long-distance communication) or specific technological solutions (like PSTN), but not the overarching *benefit* itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: goleeya ankayak miladee gaeneema (getting a global benefit):** The passage focuses on *local* benefits, not global ones.
* **B: desheeya durakathana samaagamak bhaavitha kirima (avoiding long-distance communication costs):** While a possible outcome, it's not the primary goal. It's a result of people gaining a benefit, not the benefit itself.
* **D: PSTN durakathanayak miladee ganna (getting a PSTN long-distance connection):**  This is a specific technology mentioned as a *potential* solution, but it's not the core benefit the passage is advocating for.  The focus is on the benefit to the people, not the specific technology used.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""Evaye uchcharanaya ilanga svaraaksharayata anuva venas wana baevin..."" which translates to ""Its pronunciation is similar to the Sinhala vowel letters..."" This directly indicates that Italian pronunciation is similar to Sinhala vowel sounds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dvithwa aar akurehi uchchaaranaya thani aar akurata wadaa wenas we** (Double 'r' sounds are pronounced differently than single 'r' sounds): While true in Italian, it's not the primary point emphasized in the initial text.
* **B: boho wachana ewa liyana aakarayenma uchchaaranaya karanu labai** (It's difficult to pronounce words written in that way): The text states the pronunciation is *similar* to Sinhala, implying it's not necessarily difficult.
* **C: see saha ji yana akuru sahitha wachana aseeru viya haekiya** (Words with 'sc' and 'gl' sounds can be tricky): This is a specific detail and not the overarching point about Italian pronunciation being similar to Sinhala vowels.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate and directly supported by the given Italian pronunciation guide.
"
noothana yugayata pera ismir hi aarambha wee aeththe pahatha sandahan lakshana walin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: weeduru muhunath sahitha godanaegili**.

Here's why:

The text describes Izmir as a city with a blend of traditions and modern influences. It specifically mentions the presence of ""weeduru muhunath sahitha godanaegili"" (a traditional type of Turkish architecture/building style with a garden).  The question asks about features that mark the beginning of a new era in Izmir.  The description of this architectural style aligns with representing the city's heritage while still existing in the modern landscape.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: pulul manmawath (traditional food):** While traditional food is part of the culture, it doesn't uniquely represent the beginning of a new era.
* **C: saappu madyasthaana (food center):**  Being a food center is a current characteristic, not necessarily what marks the ""beginning of a new era"".
* **D: rathu-tayil wahala (traditional roof):** Similar to the food, the traditional roof is a part of the heritage but doesn't represent a new era.



"
ismeer hi niwaeradi lakshanayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: parisaraya sampradaayika thurkiya pilibimbu karayi** (The surroundings reflect traditional Turkish features).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...nagaraye parisaraya sampradhaayika turkey laksanavalata vadaa madyadharani yuropayaka lakshana pennum kala da pulul maavat..."" ( ...the surroundings reflect traditional Turkish features along with Mediterranean and European characteristics...).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: nagaraya wataa vishaala bokkak aetha** (the city has a vast area): While the passage mentions Ismir has a large area, this isn't the *primary* characteristic being highlighted in the question.
* **C: obata naweena sappu madyasthaana saha paerani palli yana dekama soyagatha haekiya** (you can visit a new food market and the Perami Mosque): This is mentioning specific attractions, not a general characteristic of the city.
* **D: ehi thurkiye dewana vishaalathama waraaya aetha** (it's a very large city in Turkey): The passage states Ismir is a large city, but this option focuses on its size *within* Turkey, which isn't the main point of the question.



"
hanaami kiyana wachanayen adahas karanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: plam mal pipeema naerabima**.

Here's why:

The first passage describes Hanami as cherry blossom viewing. The question asks what ""hanami"" means. The passage explicitly states: ""Japanaye, adhiraajaya visin palamu cheri mal uthsava pawathwanu laebuwe ohu venuven saha adhiraajya adhikaranaye sity radala panthiye saamaajikayan venuven pamani."" This translates to something like ""In Japan, they celebrate the cherry blossom festival, and they gather with friends and family under the cherry blossom trees.""  The phrase ""cheri mal pipeema naerabima"" directly refers to viewing cherry blossoms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: cheri mal pipeema naerabima:** While this *is* the definition, the question is asking what ""hanami"" *means*, not just a descriptive phrase.
*   **B: japan wanshadhipatheen:** This means ""Japanese tradition"" and while Hanami *is* a tradition, it's not the direct definition of the word.
*   **D: adhiraajya adhikaranaya:** This refers to ""government authority"" and is irrelevant to the meaning of Hanami.



"
cheri mal pipeema naerabima sandahama wu palamu sadayata sathkarakathwaya daekwuye kawuda?,"The correct answer is **C: japana adhiraajyaya**.

Here's why:

The passage states Hanami read about the ""adiraajaya"" (emperor) and their traditions in Japan. The question asks *whose* tradition is being respected. The passage explicitly connects the ""adiraajaya"" to Japan. Therefore, the tradition being respected is the Japanese imperial tradition.

Let's break down the relevant part of the passage:

""...Japanaye, adhiraajaya visin palamu cheri mal uthsava pawathwanu laebuwe ohu venuven saha adhiraajya adhikaranaye sity radala panthiye saamaajikayan venuven pamani."" 

Translation: ""...In Japan, the emperor (adhiraajaya) was observing the cherry blossom festival with a ceremonial procession and respectful social etiquette.""

This clearly indicates the Emperor (adhiraajaya) and their traditions are central to the passage.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka vyaaparaya aakarshanaya kara gaeneemata awama washayen ida aeththe jerusalame pahatha sandahan angayangen kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: nagaraye aagamika waedagathkama (the religious significance of the city)**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes Jerusalem's religious importance.** It repeatedly highlights that Jerusalem is a central religious center for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. It's described as a spiritual, religious, and cultural hub.
* **Religious significance drives tourism.**  The passage states that Jerusalem's religious significance is a major factor in attracting pilgrims and tourists.
* **The question asks *why* Jerusalem attracts tourists.** The religious significance is the primary reason mentioned in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: eesh‍raayalaye aganuwara lesa wana ehi thathwaya (the spiritual essence of Israel):** While related, this is broader than just Jerusalem and not the *direct* reason for tourist attraction specifically *to Jerusalem*.
* **C: ehi sanskruthika dae (its culture):**  Culture is a factor, but the text places a much stronger emphasis on the religious aspect.
* **D: boho ayithihaasika sthaana (its historical significance):** Historical significance is important, but the religious significance is consistently presented as the *most* significant factor.



Therefore, the religious significance (aagamika waedagathkama) is the most direct and accurate answer to why Jerusalem attracts tourism, based on the provided text.



"
jerusalama prasiddha weemata hethuwak lesa mema chedaye sandahan nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: aagamika waedagathkama (Religious Significance)**.

Here's why:

The passage heavily emphasizes Jerusalem's importance as a central religious hub for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  It mentions:

*   It being a ""sudha nagarayak"" (pure city) and a ""thavada eva aadyaatmika, aagamika, saha sanskruthika kendhrasthaanayak"" (a truly spiritual, religious, and cultural center).
*   The city's ""aagamika vaedagathkama"" (religious significance/sacred history) as the reason for its prominence.
*   It being a major transportation route due to its religious importance.

While history and culture are mentioned, the core reason for Jerusalem's fame, according to the passage, is its profound religious significance.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Kruger National Park is a major attraction in Africa and one of the leading national parks in Southern Africa. It's focused on conservation and tourism.
* **The question asks:** What type of vehicle is needed for wildlife viewing in this area?
* **Option D** is the most comprehensive and accurate.  Wildlife viewing often requires traversing a large area, potentially including areas outside the immediate park boundaries (like adjacent reserves). A vehicle capable of navigating both within Kruger and connecting to nearby wildlife areas would be the most suitable.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: haeki tharam saenpark sanchaaraya kirimata saelasum karana sanchaarakayek** (A vehicle specifically for park transport): This is too narrow. While a vehicle for park transport is needed, it doesn't cover the need for viewing wildlife *beyond* the park's core area.
* **B: krugar jaathika wanod‍yaanaya pamanak sanchaaraya karana sanchaarakayek** (A vehicle for standard travel within Kruger):  Again, this is too narrow. It doesn't account for wildlife viewing potentially requiring travel to adjacent areas.
* **C: ud‍yaana gaasthu gaena saelakilimath wana adu ayawaeya sanchaarakayek** (A vehicle with a high ground clearance for savanna travel): High ground clearance is beneficial, but not the only requirement.  The vehicle needs to be able to access a variety of terrains and potentially travel to nearby wildlife areas.



Therefore, **D** is the best and most encompassing answer."

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Dakunu aprikaave pradhaana aakarshanavalin ekak wana athara eya dakunu aprikaanu jaathika vanodyaanavala (sanparks) pradhaanama eka lesa saelake."" (It is one of the main attractions in Africa and is the flagship of the African national parks (Sanparks).)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ud‍yaanaye aethi boho parisarika kalaapa athara wanajiween wenas we** (Many species of wildlife live in the park's diverse ecosystems): While true, this is a general statement about the park and not the *reason* for its large size/importance.
* **C: eya dakunu aprikaave kudaama jaathika wanod‍yaanayayi** (It is the smallest national park in Africa): The passage states the opposite - it's a *major* attraction.
* **D: wayild kaad pathak miladee gaeneema haraha sanchaarakayanta eyata piviseemata haekiya** (It is accessible to all tourists who want to see wildlife): While tourism is a factor, the passage doesn't focus on accessibility as the defining characteristic of the park's size/importance.

kandehi thiyunu kotas haraha kandu naginnanta anathurak weemata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: kudaa guhaa (small cave)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions a small cave near the bottom of Machu Picchu:** ""Mudunata aasannaye itha kudaa guhaavak aetha, eya harahaa yaayuthu athara, eya tharamak pahath haa tharamak hira ya."" (Near the bottom, there is a small cave, it is very deep, and it has a strange shape.)
* **The question asks about what is found in the small cave:** ""kandehi thiyunu kotas haraha kandu naginnanta anathurak weemata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?"" (What is found in the small cave near the bottom, which is very deep and has a strange shape?)
* **The passage states the cave has ""tharamak pahath haa tharamak hira"" (a strange shape and a strange brilliance).** This implies something unusual and valuable is inside.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: theth thathwayan (stone pathway):** The passage describes the stone pathway, but it doesn't suggest something is *found* in it.
* **B: gal padipela (stone steps):** Similar to the pathway, the steps are described, but nothing is found *in* them.
* **D: wane kambi aadhaaraka (wooden cable support):** The passage mentions the wooden cable supports, but nothing is found *in* them.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Machu Picchu as a place where people came to seek healing and spiritual well-being.** It mentions the sacredness of the location, the energy of the mountains, and the healing properties of the surrounding environment (like the cave with crystals).
* **Option A directly reflects this idea.** It suggests that the energy of the mountains (and the inherent power of the place) contributes to the healing and spiritual rejuvenation of visitors.
* **Options B, C, and D are not supported by the passage.**
    * **B** is too vague and doesn't connect to the passage's emphasis on healing and spiritual well-being.
    * **C** mentions the cave but doesn't explain *why* the cave's energy is healing.
    * **D** focuses on a specific condition (people feeling unwell) and attributes it to the place being ""unnatural,"" which isn't the main message of the passage.

Therefore, option A best captures the reason why people sought healing at Machu Picchu, as described in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, mayokanu aahara piseeme dee pradhaana aaharayak nowanne mewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: maansha (meat)**.

The passage states: ""Mayokanu aahara pisima, madyadharani pradeshaye anekuth kalapavala menma, padanam wee aeththe paan, elavalu saha **mansha (visheshayen ooru mas)** matha wana athara..."" 

This translates to: ""Mayokanu cuisine, in the midland region, has a variety of dishes, bread, rice, coconut, and **meat (especially for a month)** are used...""

The phrase ""(visheshayen ooru mas)"" emphasizes that meat is a significant and frequent component of this cuisine. While other items are mentioned, meat is highlighted as being particularly important.

Therefore, the main food in Mayokanu cuisine is meat.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""bhoo ushnathwa haengi sandaha wala unusum kirimata ginnakin unusum kala gal bhaavitha karayi."" This translates to: ""The earth's heat and the sun's rays influence the ripening of certain fruits, making them available for consumption.""

* **Question asks:** ""What truth about the food is revealed by the passage?""

* **Option A directly reflects this information** and provides a general truth about the food's availability based on environmental factors.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While Wellington might have access to certain foods, the passage doesn't specifically highlight Wellington as the *only* location where it's available.
* **C:** The passage mentions roast dinners being popular, but it doesn't say they are *highly* influenced by the earth's heat.
* **D:** The passage doesn't mention rotoruwa (oven) being a source of soy.

Here's why:

The text describes how New Zealand uses geothermal energy to cook food. It explicitly mentions that geothermal power plants are used to heat stones, which are then used for cooking.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: gaes (gas):** While gas is used for cooking in many places, the text specifically focuses on geothermal energy.
* **B & D: unusum karagath gal (heated stones):** Heated stones are *part* of the geothermal cooking process, but the *source* of the heat is geothermal energy. Geothermal power plants are the facilities that generate the heat for the stones.

Therefore, **geothermal power** is the overarching source of energy used for this traditional cooking method, making it the most accurate answer.

Translation: ""If you choose a particularly bright and beautiful cover for yourself, a monk or nun sitting in the monastery will give you a moving blessing.""

This indicates that a bright and beautiful cover (a specific type of offering) is the reason a monk or nun would bless you. The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: obe urahis aawaranaya kirima (Doing your own upper body covering):** The passage emphasizes receiving a blessing, not doing it yourself.
* **C: aaraamayen aawaranayak illaa gaeneema (Going without a cover to the monastery):** This is presented as undesirable; the passage promotes offering a cover.
* **D: danahisata ihalin kapana lada saayak aendeema (Helping to cut fabric for a cover):** While helpful, this isn't the *reason* for the blessing itself.
"
aaraamayakin illaa gaeneemata ida nomaethi wanne pahatha sandahan aendum walin kawareda? ,"The correct answer is **D: aawarana (covering/veil)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of a ""covering"" (aawarana) for a comfortable and respectful interaction, especially in a Buddhist context. It talks about the need for both the giver and receiver to have a covering. The question asks what is *not* necessary for a comfortable interaction. Therefore, the answer should be the element that's emphasized as *important*, but not a requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: saayawal (shame/embarrassment):** The passage isn't about shame.
*   **B: kota kalisam (round tiles):** This is irrelevant to the context.
*   **C: kalisam (tiles):**  This is also irrelevant and doesn't relate to the core concept of the passage.

Therefore, **aawarana (covering)** is the only option directly related to the passage's main point about the essential element for a comfortable interaction and the answer to the question.
"
aentaaktik kalaapaye sanchaaraya karana vita tharu baeleemata waedima awasthaawak laebenne kawadada?,"The correct answer is **D: aaloka dooshanaya awama wana vita (due to light pollution)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that light pollution in the region is a significant problem, making it difficult to see the aurora australis (Southern Lights).  It specifically mentions that ""the usual bright, red aurora might not be visible."" The question asks what hinders observation of the aurora in Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: gimhana maasawaladee (shortest month):** While Antarctica experiences long periods of darkness, the shortest month isn't the primary reason for difficulties in seeing the aurora.
* **B: pradeshaya etharam janaakeerna nowana vita (population growth in the region):** Antarctica is not inhabited by a significant population, so population growth isn't a factor.
* **C: seetha irthu maasawaladee (longest month):** The longest month in Antarctica is a period of continuous darkness, which *could* theoretically allow for aurora viewing, but the light pollution issue is the more direct and prevalent problem mentioned.

chand‍rikaa durakathanayak jangama durakathanayak sandaha shak‍ya aadeshakayak nowanne kawadada?,"The correct answer is **A: chand‍rikaawe drushti rekhaawata badhaa aethi wuwahoth** (If there is an obstruction in the line of sight of the moon).

Here's why:

The passage states that a moon-gazing experience (chandrikaa durakathanayak) is not typically considered a fixed or permanent observation (yanu jangama durakatanayak). It implies that it's dependent on conditions.  An obstruction in the line of sight (like clouds, mountains, etc.) would prevent a successful moon-gazing experience, making it a condition that would make it not possible.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: pihiteema itha durastha we nam** (If it is very far away):  While distance affects the appearance of the moon, it doesn't make the experience inherently ""fixed"" or ""not jangama.""
* **C: eya elimahane bhaavitha karanne nam** (If it is affected by the weather): The passage *does* mention weather affecting the experience, but this is more about a temporary influence, not making it a fixed observation.
* **D: gaweshanayakata nishchitha daththa awashya we nam** (If certain data is required for research):  While moon-gazing *can* be part of research, the core of the passage isn't about research data being required to make the experience fixed.



"
chand‍rikaa durakathanayak jangama durakathanayakata wadaa sudusu wanne kawadada?,"The correct answer is **D: obata pramaanawath jangama durakathana aawaranayak laebeemata haeki vita** (if you want a proportional mobile network coverage).

Here's why:

The paragraph states that Chandrikaa Durakathana is a solution for rural areas where regular mobile network coverage is lacking.  Therefore, it's meant to provide a mobile network experience where standard mobile networks aren't available. Option D directly addresses this need.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nagarayaka niwaaduwak gatha karana atharathura** (a solution for urban areas): The paragraph explicitly states this service is for rural areas.
* **B: bottu sanchaarayak atharathura** (a solution for satellite communication): While Chandrikaa Durakathana *might* use satellite technology, the primary point is its availability where regular mobile networks are missing.  This option is too specific and doesn't capture the broader context.
* **C: durastha daththa awashya nowana vita** (if distant communication is not necessary):  The paragraph emphasizes that the service is beneficial for long-distance travel and research, implying distant communication *is* necessary.



"
t‍raansnist‍riya janarajaya pihituweemata thudu dun gaetuma pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarak pilibandawa da?,"The correct answer is **B: janawaargikathwaya (ethnic)**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the main reason behind the Transnistria conflict. The provided text states: ""Moldovava yanu janavaargika gaetumen pidaa vinda aethi bahu-vaargika janarajayaki."" This translates to ""Moldova is a multi-ethnic state where ethnic tensions are prevalent."" 

The text then goes on to explain that the conflict arose due to the formation of the Transnistrian state in 1994, driven by the desire of the Russian-speaking population for autonomy. This directly links the conflict to ethnic divisions and tensions.

While economic, linguistic, and religious factors played a role, the core driving force behind the Transnistrian conflict was the **ethnic** makeup of Moldova and the resulting power struggles between different ethnic groups. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.
"
moldowa hi sesu pradeshawalata wadaa wenas namuth t‍raannist‍rya janarajayata ayath wanne pahatha sandahan karunuwalin monawada?  ,"The correct answer is **A: bhaashawa (language)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Moldovan (Romanian) is influenced by Russian. This linguistic influence is a key factor in the ongoing tensions surrounding Transnistria, a breakaway region of Moldova.  The difference in language is a significant point of contention and a major reason for the conflict.

Here's why the other options are less directly relevant:

*   **B: aagama (religion):** While religion plays a role in societal divisions, the passage focuses more directly on the language issue.
*   **C: eksath jatheenge piligaeneema (coexistence/integration):** The passage highlights the lack of successful coexistence due to the aforementioned issues.
*   **D: vyawahara mudal (economic relations):** While economic factors contribute, the passage emphasizes the linguistic element as a primary dividing line.

Therefore, the linguistic difference is the most prominent and directly stated reason for the Transnistrian conflict in the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, sulan sahitha thathwayan walakwa gaeneemata balaaporoththu wana sanchaarakayeku montevidiyo hi sanchaaraya kala yuththe kawadada?","The correct answer is **C: uthuru ardhagolaye gimhana masawaladee**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Montevidiyo pihita aeththe upa nivartana kalaapaye ya, gimhaana maasavaladi selsiyas ansaka 30 ta waedi ushnathwa saamaanya deyaki. Sheetha kaalaya mulaa sahagata lesa seethala viya haekiya: ushnathwaya midena mattamin pahala yanne kalaaturakin vuvat, sulange saha ardrathaave sankalanaya magin ushnathwamaanaye penwimata vadaa seethalak danavayi.""  This translates to: ""In Montevideo, during the autumn season, the average temperature in Celsius is below 30. Even with the beginning of winter, it is slightly cool: when the sun rises, the heat is felt in the skin, and the accumulation of moisture and humidity causes coolness in the air.""
* **The passage also mentions:** ""vaesi"" and ""viyali"" are slightly special: the rainfall is the same year after year.
* **The question asks:** ""mema chedayata anuwa, sulan sahitha thathwayan walakwa gaeneemata balaaporoththu wana sanchaarakayeku montevidiyo hi sanchaaraya kala yuththe kawadada?""  This translates to: ""Based on the above, for a traveler who wants to know when to go to Montevideo for a pleasant weather, what is the best time?""

Therefore, the best time to visit Montevideo for pleasant weather is during the **autumn season in the southern hemisphere (uthuru ardhagolaye gimhana masawaladee)**.  The southern hemisphere experiences autumn when the northern hemisphere experiences spring.  The passage specifically mentions autumn as a cool but comfortable period.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaarakayin sisil deshagunayakata waedi kaemaeththak dakwanne nam, owun montevidiyo wetha ya yuththe kawadada?","The correct answer is **B: uthuru ardha golayehi gimhaanaya wana vita**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Montevidiyo samakayata dakunin pihitaa dakunin pihitaa aethi baevin, uthuru ardhagolaye sheetha irthuwa wana vita..."" which translates to ""Montevideo is located in the southern hemisphere, experiencing winter...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: montevidiyo hi gimhaanaya wana vita:**  While true that Montevideo is in the Southern Hemisphere, this doesn't fully capture the geographical information.
* **C: montevidiyo hi waesi samaya wana vita:** The text mentions winter, not a specific time of year.
* **D: uthuru ardha golayehi sheetha irthuwa wana vita:** The text mentions *winter* in the Southern Hemisphere, not *winter* in the Northern Hemisphere.

"mema chedayata anuwa, vinaashakaree bhawayata patahaeniwa sthaapitha graefiti kalaakaruweku samaga sambandha wanne pahatha sandahan karunuwalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: graefiti kalaa kriyaakaarakam (graffiti kriyaakaarakam)**.

Here's why:

The question asks who is associated with the graffiti artists. The text explicitly states: ""... prasiddha graefiti kalaakaruvan, graefiti kriyaakaarakam saha e sandaha wana """"nityaanukula"""" bithtti aetha."" This translates to ""...famous graffiti artists, graffiti perpetrators and the so-called 'normal' graffiti have been seen in this context.""

Therefore, the graffiti artist (graefiti kriyaakaarakam) is the person associated with the graffiti artists.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: kurutu gaem (kurutugaem)** - This translates to ""little things"" or ""trifles."" It's not directly mentioned as being associated with the graffiti artists.
* **C: podu depala matha anawashya bithu sithuwam (podu depala matha anawashya bithu sithuwam)** - This translates to ""unnecessary and pointless things for young people."" While the text talks about graffiti being pointless, this option isn't linked to the *artists* themselves.
* **D: kiyaviya nohaeki dae (kiyaviya nohaeki dae)** - This means ""not mentioned."" The graffiti artist *is* mentioned.



"
samahara sewakayan athdaekeemwala theeranathmaka angayak lesa salakanne sangeetha uthsawawala kumana angaya da?,"The correct answer is **C: raathriya pasuwana thuruma sangeethaya wadanaya kirima (Playing music late at night)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""pradhaana vedikaave sangitaya nima wee tibuna da, uthsavaye samahara ansavala sangitaya **raathrea pasuwee da waadanaya viya haeki bhava mathaka thabaa ganna.**"" which translates to ""Music will be played late at night from the main stage, so you can enjoy music with a feeling of delight.""

Option C directly reflects this statement, highlighting the late-night music as a significant and enjoyable part of the Samahara Uthsava. The other options are mentioned in the passage but aren't presented as the *most* significant or unique aspect that makes the Uthsava special.

Therefore, C is the most accurate answer to the question about what makes the Samahara Uthsava a unique component of the music festival.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, uthsawayata sahabhageewanneku sangeethaya prasangayata aasanna sthaanayaka kandawuru baenda gaeneemata awashya nam, owun pramukhathawaya diya yuththe kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: raathriye pramaada wee paemineema (The enchanting atmosphere of the night)**.

Here's why:

The original text emphasizes that music is a crucial part of the Samahara Uthsava, and being near the main stage where the music is played is essential to fully experience the festival. Option A, ""the enchanting atmosphere of the night,"" best captures the essence of what makes being near the music at night so special. The text specifically mentions the enchanting atmosphere of the night and how it enhances the musical experience.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: pawul sandaha wu pradeshayaka raendee siteema (A special area along the procession route):** While the procession is part of the festival, the text focuses more on the musical experience at the main stage.
*   **C: sthaanayen baehaerawa kandawuru baendeema (A location with a panoramic view):** Panoramic views might be nice, but the text highlights the *musical* aspect and the immersive experience of being close to the music.
*   **D: welaasanin paemineema (The joy of being together):** While the Uthsava is a community event, the text emphasizes the individual experience of being near the music and enjoying the atmosphere.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer."
"mema chedayata anuwa, uthuru niw meksikowe raathree kriyaakaarakam soyana aaganthukayan waelakee sitiya yuthu thaen kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: kudaa nagara wala aethi baar (bars in the city)**.

Here's why:

* **The text mentions:** The author is looking for a place to meet people in Santa Fe at night, *excluding* casinos. They're seeking a place where they can have a relaxing time and meet local people.
* **The text implies:** The author is looking for something more casual and less overtly focused on gambling than a casino.
* **Options:**
    * **A: Pubalos:**  While Puebla is a city, the text focuses on Santa Fe.  It's a possible location, but less directly supported by the provided context.
    * **B: Kudaa nagara wala aethi baar (bars in the city):** This directly aligns with the author's desire to meet people in a relaxed setting *not* a casino. Bars are common places for social interaction.
    * **C: Saappu sankeerna (food complex):** While food complexes can be social, they aren't specifically geared towards meeting people for a relaxing night out in the same way a bar is.
    * **D: Kaeseeno (casino):** The author specifically excludes casinos.



Therefore, **B** is the most logical answer based on the text provided.

"mema chedayata anuwa, uthuru niw meksikowe prasiddha vinodaswada aethi sthaana soyaa gaeneemata amuththanta boho durata ida aeththe kothaenada?","The correct answer is **A: aelbakarki sita paeya dekaka durin pihiti kaesinowaka (a casino located two blocks away from Albuquerque)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a scenario where the speaker wants to gamble but doesn't want to travel far.** It mentions a casino in Santa Fe is too far.
* **The speaker is looking for a closer alternative.** The text explicitly states they are searching for a casino ""nearby in the urban area.""
* **Option A directly addresses this need** by suggesting a casino that is only two blocks away from Albuquerque.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: durastha publo pradeshayaka (a distant Pueblo region)** - This is too far away, contradicting the speaker's desire for a nearby location.
* **C: saenta fe asala kaesinowaka (the original Santa Fe casino)** - The passage states Santa Fe is *too* far.
* **D: kudaa nagara wala aethi baar ekaka (a bar located in the urban area)** - The speaker is specifically looking for a *casino*, not a bar.

The text states: ""navasilanta ha ostreliyaanu wayin varga sanchaarayata vadaat gaelape."" This translates to ""Novel and Australian wine are increasingly being distributed."" The question asks about the type of drink Australian people are consuming. Therefore, the correct answer is Australian wine.

"mema chedaye visthara kara aethi pradeshaya matha padanamwa, wetar vyaakoola weemata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan beema aenawum walin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: thani sudu kopi (thani sudu kopi)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ""thani sudu kopi"" (black coffee) as something Austrians find strange. The question asks what is a ""keti kalu kopi"" (black coffee) in the context of the passage. 

The passage highlights Austrian coffee preferences as a point of comparison.  The question is essentially asking: ""According to the text, what is the name of the coffee that Austrians find unusual?""  The answer is ""thani sudu kopi"" (black coffee).

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: keti kalu kopi** is simply a description of black coffee, not a specific type mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: nambar wan ekak (number one)** refers to ""Nambar Wan,"" a type of wine, and is not relevant.
*   **C: nawaseelanthayen sovignon blaenk (Sauvignon Blanc)** is a type of wine mentioned, not coffee.



"
shathawarsha thunak puraawatama paewathi yatath vijithakaranaye kala parichchedaya aarambha karana ladde kumana kandaayama visinda?,"The correct answer is **D: spaniyads**.

The passage states: ""Spaangna jaathikayan aarambha kala yatath vijitakarana kaalaya siyavas thunak pura paewathini."" which translates to ""The Spaniards began to conquer in the time of the last century."" Therefore, the Spaniards started conquering in the last century (approximately 500 years ago, as indicated by the mention of 1537).
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, paerisiyanuwan oba wetha lan kara gaeneemata hondama kramaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: paerisiyanuwange aakalpaya anukaranaya kirimata uthsaha kirima (Trying to imitate the Persian's thoughts)**.

Here's why:

The text criticizes the Persian for being selfish, prioritizing reputation, and valuing superficial things.  It suggests their outward appearance doesn't reflect their inner character. The core of the problem is their *mindset* and priorities.

* **Option A** directly addresses the root cause by suggesting understanding and attempting to mirror the Persian's thought process. This is a way to understand *why* they behave the way they do, and potentially challenge their perspective.
* **Option B (Vishwaasaya penwanna - Trusting)** is not directly related to the Persian's negative traits. Trust is a separate issue.
* **Option C (Aachaarasheeleewa haesirenna - Being virtuous/moral)** is a general principle and doesn't specifically address how to deal with someone who exhibits the specific flaws the Persian embodies.
* **Option D (Bahira haesireem penwanna - Practicing outward goodness)** focuses on appearances, which is precisely what the text criticizes the Persian for valuing.

Therefore, **Option A** is the most aligned with the text's critique and offers the most relevant strategy.  It suggests a deeper understanding is needed to address the problematic behavior.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, paerisiyanuwange ekakruthi gunangayak lesa salakanu nolabanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawarakda?","The correct answer is **A: ahankaraya (ego)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly describes Paerisiyaanuvan as someone driven by:

* **Svaarthaavaadi (selfish)**
* **Ralu saha ahankaara pirisak (a person full of pride and ego)**
* **Lesa prasiddhaya (a little fame)**

The entire passage criticizes Paerisiyaanuvan's actions as being motivated by a desire for recognition and a belief in his own superiority.  The phrase ""bien eleve"" (being elevated/virtuous) is used sarcastically, highlighting the discrepancy between his self-perception and his actual behavior.

While other options might be tangentially related, **ahankaraya (ego)** is the core flaw being pointed out.  The other options are aspects that *result* from or are *related to* the ego:

* **Ralu bawa (being arrogant)** is a manifestation of ego.
* **Sellakkarakama (self-importance)** is directly linked to a strong ego.
* **Hadisi bawa (being boastful)** is another outward expression of ego.



Therefore, the passage focuses on **ahankaraya (ego)** as the fundamental character trait Paerisiyaanuvan possesses that leads to his problematic behavior.



"
kep tawun hi met‍ro dumriya hi palamu panthiye wasiyak wanne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: maediri dumriye idiripasata wannata aetha**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Saema dumriyakama metroplas saha metrow maediri thibe; keip tavunvalata aasannathama dumriyehi metroplas dumriya maediri aeththe saemavitama pitupasini.""  This translates to: ""There is a common terminal for both Metroplas and Metrow; the metro of the keip town is located near the terminal, and it is connected to it.""

*  Therefore, the metro of Keip is connected to the main metro line (Palamu line) at the terminal (maediri dumriya).



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: etharam janaakeerna nowe (not the other line):** The text explicitly states a connection between the metro lines.
* **C: eya thewana panthiye prawesha pathrayakata milen adu we (it meets at the entrance of the Thewana line):**  The text says the Keip metro is *near* the terminal, not *at* the entrance of the Thewana line.
* **D: eya met‍ro praveshapathaka milata samana we (it is connected at the metro entrance):** While a connection exists, it's not at the *metro entrance* itself, but at the *terminal* where both lines converge.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kep tawun hi saema magee dumriyakama aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: panthi dekatama ekama prawesha pathra mila (getting a single ticket near the station)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Saema dumriyakama metroplas saha metrow maediri thibe; keip tavunvalata aasannathama dumriyehi metroplas dumriya maediri aeththe saemavitama pitupasini."" This translates to: ""The common zone of metroplas and metrow is shared; near the stations, the metroplas and metrow compartments are shared equally.""

Therefore, to use both Metroplas and Metrow, you need a way to access both.  The most logical way, as presented, is to obtain a single ticket or access pass near the station.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: adu janaakeerna met‍ro maediri (using the popular metro):** This isn't the *reason* to use both, but rather a consequence of using both.
*   **C: wenas panthi thunak (during the rush hour):**  The passage doesn't connect using both to rush hour.
*   **D: palamu panthiye saha thewana panthiye maediri (using the Palamu line and the Thewana line):** While you use the Palamu and Thewana lines, the passage focuses on using *both* Metroplas and Metrow, not just those lines in general.



"
sathwa palibodhakayak hata kala nohaeki wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: aasadanayak paethiraweema (neglecting the method)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""santharakayinta"" (a practitioner) shouldn't have neglected the method (aasadanaya). The list of things the ""palibodhakaya"" (teacher) should have done emphasizes the importance of proper practice, including addressing the student's weaknesses, guiding them towards understanding, and protecting them from negative influences. The failure to provide a proper ""aasadanaya"" (method/practice) is directly linked to the negative consequences experienced by the student (physical illness, lack of willpower, spiritual confusion, etc.).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: palukushta aethi kirima (avoiding the patient)**: The passage implies the teacher should have helped the student, not avoided them.
*   **B: asathmika kaesilla (inconsistent conduct)**: While inconsistent conduct could contribute to problems, the core issue highlighted is the lack of a proper practice or method.
*   **D: barapathala thuwala sidu kirima (performing a ritual at the crossroads)**:  This is irrelevant to the core problem described in the passage, which centers around teaching and guiding the student appropriately.



"
peragewum durakathana kadapath miladee gatha haekke kothaeninda?,"The correct answer is **A: visheshitha ratawala (specialized regions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Boho kaadpat onaema sthaanayakata aematum gaenimata honda athara, **samahara eva visheshitha ratawal kaanda wetha laabhadaayi milakata aematum gaeneeme haekiyaawa labaa de.**""

This translates to: ""It is better to invest in places where there is a lot of potential, **especially in specialized regions, to gain profits**.""

Therefore, the passage explicitly says that profits are more likely to be gained from specialized regions.
"

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the best way to gain significant profit from a large-scale business?
* **The provided text states:**  ""...memava sevaavalata pivisuma boho vita sidu wanne mudal aya kirimakin torava boho durakathanavalin aematiya haeki gaasthu rahitha durakathana ankayak harahaa we.""  This translates to: ""...to achieve many successes in this service, it is necessary to invest capital and establish a large-scale business with a revenue-generating potential.""

Option D directly reflects this:  ""investing capital and establishing a large-scale business with a revenue-generating potential.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ewata prawesha viya haekke visheshitha ratawala pamani (Entering a special field):**  While entering a niche market *could* be a strategy, the text emphasizes the *scale* of the business and capital investment.
* **B: gaasthu rahitha anka haraha (A revenue-generating potential):** This is too general.  While a revenue-generating potential is important, it's not the *way* to gain profit.
* **C: konar saappu haraha (Eating rice):** This is completely irrelevant to the topic.



Therefore, **D** is the only option that accurately captures the essence of the text's advice.

"mema chedayata anuwa, plitwees lek jaathika wanod‍yanaye bahulawa daknata nolaebena gas wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: dewadara gasa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...sprus saha devadara gas valin adhikava gahana wana athara...""  This translates to ""...deep forests primarily consisting of spruce and cedar trees..."".  The question asks which tree is found in abundance in the Plitvice Lakes National Park.  Since cedar (devadara) is mentioned *along with* spruce as the dominant tree, and it's listed as a key component of the forest, it's the best answer.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: beech gasa (Beech tree):** While beech trees are present in the park, the text doesn't indicate they are *primarily* abundant.
* **B: ok gasa (Oak tree):**  Oak trees are not specifically mentioned in the description of the forest types.
* **D: sprus gasa (Spruce tree):**  Like beech, spruce is mentioned as *along with* cedar, not as the most dominant.



"

This translates to: ""This province is a special habitat for wildlife and birds with exceptional biodiversity. Particularly, many rare species including the European bullhead, otter, kingfishers, bakamuna, links, val pusa, and **keeperayili** are found here.""

Therefore, ""kaeparsayili"" (keeperayili) is one of the rare animals found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, kalaapeeya ketha aeththa washayenma udaw karanne kumak sandaha da?","The correct answer is **D: neethi virodhee pitapath kirima (unethical exploitation)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the ""kalaapeeya ketha aeththa washayenma"" (the unethical exploitation) is related to.
* The text explicitly states: ""Aetta washayenma, kalaapiya ketha niti virodhi pitapath kireema kerehi kisidu balapaemak aethi nokarayi;"" which translates to ""In this unethical exploitation, the ability to gain any power is not available through unethical exploitation."" 
* This directly links the unethical exploitation to *neethi virodhee pitapath kirima* (unethical exploitation/taking advantage of).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thaeti pitapath kirima (self-serving exploitation):** While related, the text focuses on the *unethical* aspect. ""Thaeti"" (self-serving) doesn't fully capture the negative connotation.
* **B: weladapola palanaya (avoiding consequences):** The text doesn't directly discuss avoiding consequences; it focuses on the act of exploitation itself.
* **C: muhudu kollakaem waelaekweema (opportunistic exploitation):** This is too vague. The text highlights the *unethical* nature of the exploitation, not just its opportunism.



Therefore, **D: neethi virodhee pitapath kirima** is the most accurate and directly supported answer from the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, maadhya samaagam visin nirmaanaya karana lada kalaapeeya kethaya pilibanda wu boruwak wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: waedi welandapala palanayak laba gaeneema sandaha ewa awashya we (It is necessary for achieving a good harvest)**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text emphasizes the importance of proper planning and preparation (maadhya samaagam puruddak lesa mehi aramuna pilibandava boru pawasathi).**  The analogy used is that of preparing for a good harvest.
* **The text states that avoiding unethical methods (kalaapiya ketha niti virodhi pitapath kireema kerehi kisidu balapaemak aethi nokarayi) is crucial.**  This is like avoiding harmful practices that could damage the crops.
* **The overall goal is to achieve a good outcome (honda paalanayak labaa deema wana athara).** This directly relates to a successful harvest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: neethi virodhee pitapath kirima walakwa gaeneemata ewa upakaree we (It helps in achieving unethical methods).** The text explicitly condemns unethical methods.
* **C: ewa mudal bhramanaya sandaha prayojanawath we (It is useful for the initial journey).**  The text focuses on preparation *before* the journey, not the journey itself.
* **D: prakaashana sorakam waelaekweemata ewa kalaathurakin upakaree we (It helps in projecting light).** This option is completely unrelated to the themes of planning, ethics, and achieving a good outcome present in the text.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the core message of the provided text about the necessity of proper planning and ethical conduct for achieving a desired result, framed as a good harvest."
oba obe maw ratata paeminena vita saaman‍yayen avidhimath wanne kumana kriyaawaliyada?,"The correct answer is **D: regu paalanaya (rule of law)**.

Here's why:

* **P's statement:**  The prompt emphasizes obeying the law and following established procedures to ensure fairness and transparency in examinations. It specifically mentions ""arithraanukula kriyavak"" (consistent procedures) and ""regu paalanaya karadarakaaree deyak viya haeki ya"" (as a rule of law).
* **Q's question:** The question asks about illegal activities related to the country.
* **D connects the two:**  ""Regu paalanaya"" (rule of law) is the overarching principle that prevents illegal activities.  Violating rules and regulations *is* an illegal activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: aagamana vigamana pareekshaawa (arrival and departure examination):** This is a *specific* procedure within an examination, not a broad concept of obeying the law.
* **B: bhaanda pilibanda prakaashaya (disclosure regarding accounts):** This refers to financial transparency and is unrelated to general obedience to the law.
* **C: bhaandawala neethyaanukoola seemawan (ethical boundaries of accounts):**  Similar to B, this is specific to accounting ethics and not the broader concept of obeying the law.



Therefore, **regu paalanaya (rule of law)** best answers the question in the context of the prompt.



"
obe maw ratata paemineemata pera oba daenagatha yuththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: neethyaanukoola seemawan ikmawana bhaanda prakaasha kirimata awashyada yana bawa.**

Here's why:

* **P's statement:**  P is emphasizing the importance of respecting and following rules and regulations, and being open about their positive and negative attributes. The focus is on transparent and appropriate behavior.
* **Q's question:** Q asks about how the respondent (you) would handle a situation where their country is involved in a war and a conflict arises with another nation. 
* **Option B:**  ""Neethyaanukoola seemawan ikmawana bhaanda prakaasha kirimata awashyada yana bawa"" translates to ""You should necessarily disclose any disharmony or conflict that occurs within the boundaries of ethical standards."" This aligns perfectly with the spirit of P's statement, encouraging transparency and ethical conduct, even during conflict.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: aagamana vigamana pareekshaawak thibeda yana bawa (You should be prepared for arrival and departure checks):** This is too specific and doesn't address the broader context of conflict and ethical disclosure.
* **C: regu paalanayak thibeda yana bawa (You should follow the rules):** While following rules is important, it doesn't address the need for *transparency* about potential conflicts. Simply following rules might not prevent ethical lapses.
* **D: oba gena ena kisiyam bhaandayak sandaha awasara nomaethida yana bawa (You should not hastily disclose any conflict that arises about you):**  This contradicts P's emphasis on open communication and suggests a secretive approach, which is the opposite of what P promotes.



Therefore, **B** is the best answer as it reflects the ethical and transparent approach P advocates for, even in a challenging situation like international conflict."
"mema chedayata anuwa, kochamo nimnaye kandu naginnan nirantharayen nawa maarga soyaa gaeneemata ida salaswanne kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: kandu mudun**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** Who is continuously establishing new roads in the area?
* **The text states:** ""lokaye saema pradeshayakinma kandu naginnan ehi nimak naethi bitthi athara akhandava nava maarga sthaapitha karamin sitithi."" (In the area of Lokaye Saema Pradesh, in the midst of the mountains, new roads are continuously being established.)
* **The phrase ""kandu mudun"" (mountain peak/summit) is directly linked to the action of establishing new roads.** The text says new roads are being established ""in the midst of the mountains."" Therefore, ""kandu mudun"" is the entity associated with this activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dasun:** Dasun is mentioned as someone who created a remarkable sculpture, not someone involved in road construction.
* **B: muduna:** Muduna (probably referring to a specific place or feature) is not directly linked to road construction.
* **D: biththi:** Biththi (mountain/peak) is the location where roads are being established, not the entity doing the establishing.

"mema chedaye dakwa aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, dakunu ardhagolaye waedima haras maaru aawaranaya karanne kawuda?","The correct answer is **A: skayiteem**.

The passage states: ""Kisima guvan sevaa sandhaanayak dakunu ardha golaye saagara haras maaru tunama aawarana nokarayi (thavada SkyTeam kisidu haras maaru kisiyam aawaranaya nokarayi)."" This translates to: ""Some airline alliances operate in the Southern Hemisphere's ocean routes (unlike SkyTeam, which does not operate any such alliance)."" Therefore, SkyTeam is the alliance that operates in the Southern Hemisphere.
"
dakunu ardhagolaye saagara haras maaru awama washayen aawaranaya karanne kumana guvan sewa sandhaanayada?,"The correct answer is **D: SkyTeam**.

The text states: ""Kisima guvan sevaa sandhaanayak dakunu ardha golaye saagara haras maaru tunama aawarana nokarayi (thavada SkyTeam kisidu haras maaru kisiyam aawaranaya nokarayi).""  This translates to: ""Some airline alliances cover the oceans of the Southern Hemisphere (however, SkyTeam covers no such area).""

Therefore, SkyTeam is the alliance that *doesn't* cover the Southern Hemisphere oceans, implying that the other options *do* cover them. However, the question asks which alliance *does* cover the Southern Hemisphere oceans, and the text mentions SkyTeam as an example of an alliance that *doesn't*. The question is phrased poorly, but based on the text, we can infer that the answer should be one of the options that isn't SkyTeam.

Given the options, and understanding the context, the question is likely asking which alliance *does* cover the Southern Hemisphere oceans. The text doesn't explicitly state which alliance does. However, it highlights that *SkyTeam* does not.

Let's rephrase the question to make it clearer: ""According to the text, which airline alliance *does not* cover the Southern Hemisphere oceans?"" The answer to that question would be SkyTeam.

Since the question asks which alliance *does* cover the oceans and the text doesn't explicitly state that, this question is very flawed. But if we go with the options and the text, SkyTeam is the one that isn't mentioned as covering the oceans.

**Therefore, based on the flaws in the question, and the provided options, the best possible answer is D: SkyTeam because it is the only alliance specifically mentioned as *not* covering the Southern Hemisphere oceans.**

However, it's important to reiterate that the question is poorly worded.



"
global raning tuwars sarthaka kara gath sanchaaraka sanvidhaanaya kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: raning tuwars prag**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Global raning tuwars hi anupraaptikaya wana go raning tuwars visin, mahadvipa hataraka sitina sthaana duvamin narambana saepayumkaruvan raashiyak ekata jaalagata karayi. Basilonaave basilona raning tuwars saha kopanheganhi raning kopanheganvala mula sahitava eya ikmaninma raning tuwars praag haa wenath eva haa sambandha viya.""

This translates to: ""Global ranking towards the goal, to go towards the ranking goal, in the same way, the country with the largest number of exporters starting from the position of the continent, has been integrated into a single ranking goal with the ranking goal and its root with the ranking goal of the largest number of countries.  The ranking goal of countries with the largest number of countries has been merged with the ranking goal of the largest number of countries.""

The key phrase is ""...**raning tuwars prag haa wenath**"" which means ""...the ranking goal *towards* has been merged.""

Therefore, the question asks what *validates* the global ranking goal. The text explicitly mentions the ""raning tuwars prag"" (ranking goal towards) being involved.  It's the *process* of moving *towards* the goal that validates it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: raning kopanhegan** (ranking of exporters) - While exporters are part of the ranking, the text doesn't say their ranking validates the global ranking goal itself.
*   **B: go raning tuwars** (go to ranking goal) - This refers to the direction, not the validation mechanism.
*   **D: raning tuwars basilonaa** (ranking goal of countries with the largest number of countries) - This is a specific component of the ranking, not the validation.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, go raning tuwars sthaana duwamin narambana chaarika sanvidhaana karana aayathana keeyak sandaha upakaree weda?","The correct answer is **A: hatharak (six)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mahadvipa hataraka sitina sthaana duvamin narambana saepayumkaruvan raashiyak ekata jaalagata karayi."" This translates to ""It has joined the top six countries in terms of global ranking.""

Therefore, ""hatharak"" (six) is the correct answer.
"
sanchaarakayeku cheetage paehaedili dasunak apekshaa karanne nam kumak kala yuthuda?,"The correct answer is **B: panduru athara aevideemata yaama**.

Here's why:

The text describes a ""jangama safaariyak"" which is also referred to as ""panduru athara aevidima"" or ""aevidagena yaama"" (mobile safari).  The question asks what the tourist would have to do to see cheetahs, lions, and elephants up close. The text states that a mobile safari allows you to get close to these animals.

* **A: kandu naegeeme safariyak yaama (going on a walking safari):** This isn't implied as the primary way to see these animals up close, as the text emphasizes the vehicle for close viewing.
* **C: duradaknayak bhaavitha kirima (imagining something far away):**  This is the opposite of the text's suggestion to get close.
* **D: motar rathayak gena sammatha upakarana bhaavitha kirima (imagining having a suitable vehicle):** While having a suitable vehicle (like a Honda) is mentioned, the main method is the mobile safari itself.



"
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, waahanayaka safari vinoda chaarikawaka yedena aaganthukayeku hamuweemata ida aeththe kumana wargaye sathekda?","The correct answer is **A: sinhayan (lions)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that during a safari, you have the opportunity to see lions, cheetahs, and giraffes in their natural habitat.  The question asks which animal is suitable for a safari, implying it's a common sight and a key part of the experience. Lions are a very iconic and frequently seen animal on African safaris.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraye viyadama adu karanu aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: thawath ek pudgalayeku samaga gaman kirima (Traveling with another person).**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes safety in travel.** It warns about the dangers of traveling alone, especially at night.
* **Option C aligns with the advice in the passage.**  Traveling with someone else provides safety in numbers and can deter potential dangers.
* **The other options are risky:**
    * **A: oba visinma gaman kirima (Traveling alone):**  This is directly discouraged in the passage.
    * **B: hathara denekugen yuth kandaayamak soya gaeneema (Taking a motorcycle with four wheels):** While a safer vehicle than a motorcycle, it doesn't address the inherent risk of solo travel.  The passage is more about the *companionship* aspect.
    * **D: haya denekugen ho eeta waedi yuth kandaayamak soya gaeneema (Taking a motorcycle with a damaged part):**  This is highly dangerous and goes against the passage's focus on safety.

Therefore, traveling with another person is the safest and most appropriate option based on the provided text.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, hondama sanchaaraka mila anupathaya laba gatha haekke katada?","The correct answer is **A: motar ratha maru kirimata kaemathi sanchaarakayin (motor vehicle crash related traffic controller)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sathya lesama eya thamaa waedi mudalak geviya yuthu yaeyi visvaasa kirimata minisun polambavana kramayakata waedi deyak bhava pene. **Manda boho vita motor rathha piravima sandaha sanchaarakayinva ehaa meha maaru karati.**""

This translates to: ""Slightly, he believed in the assurance of the fact that he was a beginner. **After a long time, a traffic controller related to motor vehicle accidents happened here.**""

The question asks what caused the speaker's belief to change.  The passage directly links the traffic controller (specifically related to motor vehicle accidents) to the speaker's shift in belief. The other options are not mentioned or linked to the passage's context.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, saen fraensisko hi goleeya piligaeneemata hethu wuye kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: vividha kalaa ha maadhya aakarayanhi niranthara niroopanaya (constant display of diverse arts and media)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Sangitaya, chitrapata, saahithyaya saha Janapriya sanskruthiya thula ehi nirantara nirupanaya..."" which translates to ""The constant display of music, cinema, literature, and popular culture...""  It then goes on to say this contributes to the city's fame and benefits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: palamu panthiye sammanthrana pahasukam (parallel accommodation and relaxation):** While hotels contribute to this, it's not the primary *reason* for San Francisco's global fame, according to the text.
* **C: aarthika vividhaangeekaranaya (economic diversification):**  This is a *result* of San Francisco's success, not the main reason it's famous.
* **D: naegee ena aasiyanu aahara pradarshanayak (a showcase of diverse Asian cuisine):** While San Francisco has a great Asian food scene, the paragraph doesn't highlight this as the primary factor in its global recognition.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, saen fraensisko pilibandawa sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **D: aarthikaya mulumaninma sanchaaraka vyaaparaya matha randaa pawathee** (The economy is a major carrier of financial business).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Vurttiya sevaa, raajya, mulya, velanda haa sanchaaraka yanu visaalatama sevaa ansa we."" (It has a wide range of services including financial, government, value, lending, and carrier services).
* **It further emphasizes:** ""...saen fraensisko vishaala sanchaaraka yatitala pahasukamak sanvardhanaya kara aetha."" (it has a large carrier network that contributes to the prosperity of San Francisco).
* **The passage highlights San Francisco's importance as a hub:** ""...wenath aasiyanu ivum pihum sandaha ratehi aethi hondama sthaana valin ekak da we."" (it is a good location for connecting with Asia, the motherland, India, and Japan).  This connection is strongly tied to financial and business activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eya boho vita chithrapata ha poth wala daknata laebe** (You can find it in many pictures and books): While San Francisco is featured in media, this doesn't directly address its economic importance.
* **B: aasiyanu aahara janapriyayi** (Asia is a popular food):  The passage mentions Asia as a region connected to San Francisco, but doesn't say that Asian food is popular.
* **C: boho hotal saha sammelana madyasthaana aetha** (There are many hotels and conference centers): The passage mentions hotels and conference centers, but it's only one aspect of San Francisco's economic activity, not the primary driver.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka niyojithayekuge sewaawan bhaavitha kirimen prayojana noganne kumana wargaye sanchaarakayekuda?","The correct answer is **C: thawamath thama visaa labagena naethi sanchaarakayek (A traveler who does not have a visa in his/her own name)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the need for a visa.** It states multiple times that a visa is required for the travel package.
* **Option C directly addresses the visa requirement.**  A traveler lacking a visa in their own name would be immediately ineligible for the travel package.
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * **A: avinishchitha sanchaarakayeku (An uncertain traveler):** While the passage mentions uncertain travel, it doesn't focus on uncertainty *regarding visa status*.
    * **B: swayansiddhathawayata goduru wu sanchaarakayeku (A traveler who is self-sufficient):**  The package *includes* accommodation and meals, so self-sufficiency is not a key factor.
    * **D: paekeja ganudenu wen karawa gaeneemata kaemathi sanchaarakayek (A traveler who wants to book a package for a trip):** The question is not about wanting to book, but about *eligibility*.



Therefore, the most logical reason a traveler would be ineligible for this travel package is not having a visa in their own name.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the complexity of describing the travel experience.** It states that the writer needs to describe the journey *in a way that reflects their feelings* and *with a focus on the travel itinerary*. This implies a challenging writing task.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hotal deemanaa (Hotel provision):** While hotels are part of the package, the passage doesn't highlight the difficulty of describing hotel provisions.
* **C: siyalla aethulath paekeja (All-inclusive package):** Similar to B, the difficulty isn't related to the all-inclusive nature of the package.
* **D: wen karawa gaeneemak randawa gaeneema (The second travel writing):** The passage mentions *writing about the journey* and *a second travel writing* as a requirement. The difficulty lies in the writing itself, not the second writing specifically.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the difficulty lies in **writing a compelling and descriptive account of the travel experience.**"
"mema chedayata anuwa, thathya kaleena pata pariwarthaka yedumakata kala nohaekke monawada?","The correct answer is **A: videsha bhaasha sanngaa pariwarthanaya (translation of foreign language content)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes translating content from foreign languages.** The entire text revolves around the ability to translate text from one language to another using a ""parivarthaana yanthra"" (translation machine). It specifically mentions translating foreign language content *into* Sinhala.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sampurna paata kotas pariwarthanaya kirima (translating the entire text)** - While translation *can* involve the entire text, the core focus is not simply translating *everything*, but translating *foreign language content*.
* **C: smaart jangama durakathanaya haraha wasthun pilibanda pata pariwarthanaya kirima (translating smart mobile content about all kinds of objects)** - This is too broad. The passage specifically talks about translating *foreign languages*.
* **D: 100% k ma niwaeradiwa pariwarthanaya kirima (100% perfectly translating)** - While the passage mentions the desire for perfect translation, it's not the central point. The ability to translate foreign languages is the core concept.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the main theme of the passage."
pariwarthana nobaendiwa sidu kirimata ida denne kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: bhaasha daththa baagatha kirima (language input)**.

Here's why:

* **The text describes a situation where the user wants to translate text, but not to alter the original text's appearance.** It mentions a ""parivarthana yanthra"" (translation machine) that could potentially change the text's form. The user wants to avoid this.
* **The passage then states that Google Translate functions as a ""parivartanaya"" (translation) but doesn't change the original text's look. It simply translates the input.**
* **Option C, ""bhaasha daththa baagatha kirima"" (language input), refers to the act of *inputting* the text you want translated.**  This is the core action to avoid altering the text's appearance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: waedi diyunu kala pariwarthana yanthra (a futuristic translation machine):** The text is skeptical of such a machine and implies it might change the text's appearance.
* **B: smart jangama durakathanaya (smart portable telephone):**  While a phone *can* be used for translation, the question is about the method to *avoid altering the original text*.
* **D: thathya kaleena pariwarthana kandaye yedum (any real-time translation device):**  The text is trying to avoid a real-time translation device that might change the original text.



Therefore, the best answer is **C**.  The way to translate without changing the original text is through language input (inputting the text to be translated).



"
himakandu kadaa waeteemakata hethuwa nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: aelena sulu hima (ice-like snow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Gaetaluva wanne hima aelena sulu vimayi..."" which translates to ""The snow that falls is ice-like and fluffy...""  This indicates that the unusual snowfall is due to the *nature* of the snow itself – its icy, fluffy texture. This is the primary reason why the snowfall is different from normal.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: minisun (people)** - The passage doesn't mention people causing the unusual snowfall.
* **C: hiru eliya (sunlight)** - While sunlight is present, the passage focuses on the snow's characteristics, not the sun's role.
* **D: athireka himapathanaya (unusual snowfall)** - This is a description of the phenomenon, not the *cause* of the unusualness.  The passage is trying to explain *why* it's unusual.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, himakandu kadaa waeteemak lesa waetenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: baewum sahitha pallamwala athirikta hima (Snow with excess moisture in the lower layers)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""himakadu kadaa vaetim asaamaanyathaavak nove; baevum sahitha pallamwalata daraa gatha haekke ithaa mandagami lesa wana athara athirikta parimaavan himakadu kadaa vaetim lesa pahatha vaetenu aetha.""  This translates to: ""The snow falling wasn't unusual; however, in the lower layers, there was an excess amount of moisture, and the snow falling was slightly heavier than usual.""

* **The question asks:** ""mema chedayata anuwa, himakandu kadaa waeteemak lesa waetenne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?"" which translates to: ""According to this passage, what is the reason for the slightly heavier snow falling?""

* **Option C directly addresses this reason:** It points to the excess moisture in the lower layers of the snow as the cause of the heavier snowfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aarambhayak nomaethi aelena sulu hima (Snow that didn't melt initially):** The text doesn't mention whether the snow melted initially.
* **B: hima nomaethi baewum (Snow and moisture):** While the text mentions both snow and moisture, it's not the *reason* for the heavier snowfall, but rather a description of the snow's composition.
* **D: minisun visin sparsha nokarana lada hima (Snow that didn't touch people):** This is irrelevant to the reason for the heavier snowfall.

Therefore, **C** is the only option supported by the text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, vyanjana padanam wee aeththe kumana amud‍ravya wataada?","The correct answer is **A: yogat saha jalaya (yogurt and water)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vyanjanayak ekko 'viyali' ho 'theth' viya haekiya. Draavana pramaanaya anuva vyanjanayak ekko """"viyali"""" ho """"theth"""" viya haekiya."" This translates to: ""The dish should be like a 'viyali' (a type of yogurt dish), with the consistency of a 'theth' (a type of buttermilk). The dish should be like a 'viyali' with the right liquid proportion.""

The passage further mentions that the dish is influenced by the cultural exchange between Northern India and Pakistan, and by various cultural exchanges in the Indian subcontinent.

Yogurt (Draavana) and water are the key ingredients to achieve the desired consistency of ""viyali"" and ""theth,"" aligning with the described characteristics.  The other options are not directly linked to creating this specific consistency.
"
samahara pradesha wala pol kiri samahara vita vyanjana wala kumana amud‍ravyayak wenuwata bhaavitha karanu laebe da?,"The correct answer is **C: yogat**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Uthuru indiya saha paakisthana abyantara kalaapavala karivala boho seyin yogat bhaavitha wei; dakunu indiyava saha ardhadvipaye anek verala kalaapavala boho seyin pol kiri bhaavitha wei.""

This translates to: ""It is influenced by yoga in the cultural exchange between North India and Pakistan; in ancient India and the subcontinent, many different cultural aspects are influenced by coconut milk.""

The question asks what ingredient is influenced by yoga in the context of dishes that use coconut milk.  The text directly links *yogat* (yoga) with the influence on dishes using coconut milk.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maansha (meat):** The text doesn't specifically mention meat being influenced by yoga in this context.
* **B: elawalu (mango):**  The text doesn't connect mangoes to the influence of yoga.
* **D: kulubadu (ginger):** The text doesn't connect ginger to the influence of yoga.



Therefore, **yogat (yoga)** is the correct answer because the text explicitly states the influence of yoga on dishes using coconut milk."

Here's why:

* The passage states the expedition used specialized tractors equipped with icebreakers to clear a path.
* The question asks what is *necessary* for a tractor to travel across the Transantarctic Mountains.
* An icebreaker is crucial to break up the ice and snow, allowing the tractors to progress.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maekmardo dumriya sthaanaya boho vita wasaa dama aetha** (It has a long and difficult journey): While true of the expedition, it doesn't describe a *necessary* component for the tractor.
* **C: visheshitha t‍raektar wegawath nowe** (Specialized tractors are not needed): The passage explicitly states specialized tractors *were* needed.
* **D: eya ros muhuda haraha gaman kirimata wadaa pahasu we** (It was able to travel freely across the ice): The passage indicates travel was *not* free; it required breaking through ice and snow.

"dakunu dhraewaya haraha, kodi walin salakunu kara aeththe kumakda?","The correct answer is **B: indhana raegena yana t‍raektar (Fuel-powered tractor)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a special tractor designed to travel across the Transantarctic Mountains, specifically mentioning it's equipped with fuel and soap (presumably for maintaining the vehicle).  It's the only option that aligns with this description of a vehicle used for traversing icy conditions.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: maekmardo dumriya sthaanayata wu maargaya (A path to the destination)** - This describes the route, not the vehicle itself.
* **C: hima walin pirunu viwarayan (Description of the ice)** - This describes the environment, not the vehicle.
* **D: kandukaraya wata wu bhayaanaka wangu (The dangerous slope of the mountains)** - This describes a hazard, not a vehicle.

dakunudiga aprikaave sanchaaraya kirimedee sanchaarakayin daenuwath viya yuthu deyak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne meyin kumakda?,"The correct answer is **D: motar rathayakin gaman ganne nam 4x4 rathayak nirdesha kere.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...4x4 rathawalin pamanak baevin, 4x4 rathayak yodaagaeneema nuvanata huru we."" ( ""...it was necessary to use 4x4 vehicles, and 4x4 vehicles were needed to overcome the terrain."")
* **The question asks:** ""dakunudiga aprikaave sanchaaraya kirimedee sanchaarakayin daenuwath viya yuthu deyak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne meyin kumakda?"" (What is the reason why it is difficult to conduct transportation in the mountainous regions of Dakunu Aprika?)
* **The passage implies:** The terrain in Dakunu Aprika is challenging, requiring specialized vehicles.
* **Option D directly addresses this:** It suggests that using a 4x4 vehicle is a requirement for travel in the mountainous regions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: vividha ratawala visaa balapathra sandaha vividha awashyatha aetha** (Various countries have different power requirements and different needs.) - While true in general, it's not specifically related to the transportation challenges in Dakunu Aprika.
* **B: motar rathayen sanchaaraya kirimedee sanchaarakayin daenuwath viya yuthu deyak lesa chedaye sandahan nowanne meyin kumakda?** (What is the reason why it is difficult to conduct transportation in the mountainous regions of Dakunu Aprika?) - This is the same as the question, not an answer.
* **C: dakunu aprikaave asalwaesi ratawal siyallama pahe sthaawara ratawal we** (The original countries of Dakunu Aprika are all stable countries.) - This is factually incorrect and doesn't relate to transportation difficulties.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"mema chedayata anuwa, dakunu aprikaava motar rathayen sanchaaraya kirimata apekshaa karana sanchaarakayinta naraka upadesak lesa saelakiya haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **A: motar rathaya thula thibiya yuthu samahara hadisi awasthaa ayithama neethyaanukoolawa awashya viya haekiya**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes regulations around ""Dakunu Aprikaava"" (likely referring to a specific type of vehicle, possibly off-road vehicles).** It states that operating these vehicles requires adhering to specific regulations and that they need to be in a technically sound condition.
* **Option A directly reflects this emphasis on technical condition and legal compliance.** It states that operating the vehicle must be in a legally compliant state.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **B:** While 4x4 vehicles *can* access areas regular vehicles can't, the passage focuses on the broader regulations for ""Dakunu Aprikaava,"" not just 4x4s.
    * **C:**  The passage doesn't mention that the vehicle's strength is what allows it to travel on difficult terrains. It's about proper operation and adherence to regulations.
    * **D:** The passage implies that ""Dakunu Aprikaava"" *can* travel on some roads, but the regulations dictate *where* and *how* they can operate.  Option D is too broad and doesn't reflect the regulatory focus.

Therefore, **Option A** best captures the core message of the passage regarding the mandatory technical condition and legal compliance for operating ""Dakunu Aprikaava"" vehicles.

* **The provided text describes a bomb threat.** It mentions a potential bomb, a large explosion, and the danger to the bomb disposal squad.
* **Question Q asks about the *intent* behind the false alarm.**  Who was the false alarm directed *at*?
* **Option A directly addresses this.** The text explicitly states the bomb threat was aimed *at the bomb disposal squad* (""baladhaareen ewa viya haeki bomba tharjanayak lesa saelakeemata ida aetha"" - if the bomb disposal squad were to react to it, a bomb disposal squad might be provoked to act).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: oba anudaenumakin thorawa mathd‍ravya gena yanneku bawata pathviya haekiya** (you were trying to get medicine for your illness): This is irrelevant to the bomb threat scenario.
* **C: samahara vita eya wenath kenekuge yana vyaakoolathwayata hethu viya haekiya** (it caused someone's panic): While the threat would cause panic, the question asks about the *intended recipient* of the threat, not just the effect of the threat.
* **D: baladhaareen ewa viya haeki bomba tharjanayak lesa saelakeemata ida aetha** (the bomb disposal squad might be provoked to act if they react to it): This describes a *possible consequence* of the situation, not who the threat was aimed at.



"
mathd‍ravyaya prawaahanaya sambandhayen mema chedaye sandahan kara nomaethi de kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: samahara ratawala palamu warata waradakaruwanta da marana danduwama niyama viya haekiya** (which translates to: ""a death penalty or life imprisonment for those who engage in the trafficking of harmful substances"").

Here's why:

* **The provided text describes a very serious crime:** It details the severe consequences of trafficking harmful substances, including potential death or long imprisonment.
* **Option A directly reflects the gravity of the situation:**  It mentions the death penalty or life imprisonment, aligning perfectly with the text's warnings.
* **Options B, C, and D are less accurate:**
    * **B:** While dealing with inter-state transport is relevant, it doesn't encompass the full scope of the text's warning about trafficking.
    * **C:**  It's a potential consequence, but not the primary focus of the text, which emphasizes the inherent danger of the activity.
    * **D:** This describes a potential act by the trafficker, not the legal consequence of the trafficking itself.

Therefore, Option A is the most precise and accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
oba niwase niwaaduwak gatha karana vita obata saedeemata uthsaha kala haeki bawa sandahan nokarana beema wargaya monawada?,"The correct answer is **B: kopi (coffee)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes someone who is stressed and looking for a way to relax and enjoy themselves.** They are mentioning a trip to their hometown and wanting to unwind.
* **The passage mentions a desire for a ""smoothie-like"" drink and suggests a simple snack like a bread with soya bean paste.**
* **The question asks for a drink to help with a lack of enthusiasm when starting the day.** Coffee is a common beverage people use to boost energy and enthusiasm in the morning.
* **Juice (A) is a good source of vitamins but might not provide the energy boost needed to overcome a lack of enthusiasm.**
* **Beera (C) is a type of alcoholic beverage and is not typically consumed in the morning to improve enthusiasm.**
* **Tea (D) can be relaxing, but coffee is generally considered a stronger pick-me-up.**

Therefore, coffee best fits the context of needing a boost to start the day and overcome a lack of enthusiasm.
"
"obe nagaraya paneeya sanskruthiyata prasiddha nam, oba niwase gatha karana niwadu kalaya thula oba ya yuththe pahatha sandahan sthaanawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: joos ho smoothi alevisael (Make a juice smoothie)**.

Here's why:

The text describes a person who is accustomed to a diverse beverage culture in their city. It then suggests a simple, healthy drink for their daily routine – a juice smoothie, made with soya milk. The question asks what they would find in the places they've visited in their city.

The text implies they'd be looking for places that offer diverse and interesting beverages, which a juice smoothie aligns with.  The other options are less likely:

* **A: obe asalwaesi pradeshayen pitatha pihiti kopi alevisael (Make coffee with spices from your native province):** While possible, it's less directly connected to the text's focus on simple, daily drinks.
* **C: oba nithara noyana pab (Your favorite pub):** Pubs are associated with alcohol, and the text emphasizes a healthy beverage choice.
* **D: kaemomayil the hadana awanhal (Ginger tea with honey):** Ginger tea is a specific drink, but the text suggests a broader appeal to diverse beverage options.



"
parevi moorthi pihita aeththe koheda?,"The correct answer is **A: gamen paeya bhagayaka durin (away from the entrance)**.

Here's why:

* **P states:** ""...paligu parevi murthi daekiya haekiya. Sith aedagannaasulu gammanaya vataa paeya bhaagayak pamana aevidima vati.""  This translates to ""...people saw the parevi murthi, and the people who went to the entrance (gammanaya) saw a part of it."" This implies the statue (parevi murthi) was located *away* from the entrance, which people had to walk to see.

* **B: dewasthaana bhoomiye (on the temple grounds)** - While the statue is on the temple grounds, it's not specifically stated to be *on* the grounds.  It's about being seen from the entrance.

* **C: estooroyi doopathe (in the eastern door)** -  This is not mentioned in the passage.

* **D: dewasthaanaya thula (on the temple tower)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, the most logical conclusion based on the provided text is that the parevi murthi was hidden **away from the entrance**.



"
pramaanawath mudal aadhaarayak sanaatha kirimata yamekuta awashya wanne kumana aakaraye visaa balapathrayakda?,"The correct answer is **A: vyaaparika visaa (Business Visa)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Boho ratawalata, oba adyaapanaya laebeemata adahas karana aayatanaya wethin pirinaemum lipiyak saha avama washayen obage paatamaalave palamu vasara thula obage viyadam sapura gaenimata aramudal aethi bavata saakshi awashya we. **Savistaraatmaka awashyathavan pilibandava daenagenimata, aayatanaya menma oba adyaapanaya laebeemata adahas karana rate aagamana depaarthamenthuvenda vimasanna.**""

This implies needing a visa to conduct teaching activities and demonstrating qualifications.  The passage further says, ""**Sisya visa sandaha saamaanyayen saamaanya sanchaaraka ho vyaapaarika visa balapatravalin venas awashyathaa saha ayadum kireeme kriyaa patipaati atha.**"" (Student visa generally requires a business visa in addition to normal communication visa.)  This explicitly links the need for a student visa to a business visa.

Therefore, the passage indicates a **business visa** is necessary for conducting teaching activities and fulfilling the requirements for a student visa in many countries.



"
deergha visaa balapathrayak illaa siteemata boho durata ida aeththe kawuda?,"The correct answer is **D: vyaaparika sanchaarakayeku (Commercial carrier)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Poduve, dirgha kaalayak videsha rataka raendi siteema sandaha oba kal aetiva visa balapatrayak labaa gaenimata awashya wei.""  This translates to: ""Furthermore, for long-distance international routes, it is necessary to obtain a visa power of attorney.""

The text also mentions that a commercial carrier needs a visa power of attorney for business visa operations, including signature and document retrieval.  Therefore, if a commercial carrier doesn't have a long-term visa power of attorney system, it's problematic for long-distance international operations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: saaman‍ya sanchaarakayeku (Ordinary carrier):** The text indicates ordinary carriers need a system for short-distance routes.  The question asks about long-distance, so this isn't the answer.
* **B: palapurudu sanchaarakayeku (Passenger carrier):** The text focuses on *visa* power of attorney, which is primarily relevant for business activities, not passenger transport.
* **C: jathyanthara shish‍yayeku (Inter-regional student):** This option is irrelevant to the discussion of visa power of attorney for carriers.



"
oba visheshayen maduruwan gaena saelakilimath viya yuththe kawadada?,"The correct answer is **C: waesi wanaantharaye**.

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks: ""How did you look so special and beautiful?"" (implied meaning from ""maduruwan gaena saelakilimath viya yuththe kawadada?"")
* **The answer (A)** ""gimhana maasawaladee"" (a type of dried fish) doesn't fit the context.
* **The answer (B)** ""kandu naegeemedee"" (a type of medicinal plant) also doesn't fit.
* **The answer (C)** ""waesi wanaantharaye"" (from the side of the doorway) connects to the previous statement in the passage. The passage describes the person appearing beautiful *when viewed from the side of the doorway*.  This suggests the angle or setting made them look particularly special.
* **The answer (D)** ""riya padawana atharathura"" (a distant, hazy area) doesn't make logical sense as a reason for someone looking beautiful.

The passage emphasizes the visual effect of the person appearing beautiful from a specific vantage point - the side of the doorway.  Therefore, ""waesi wanaantharaye"" is the most fitting answer.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, waesi wanaantharaya haraha riya paedaweemedee maduruwan walakwa gaeneema sandaha oba kumak kirimen waelakee sitiya yuthuda?","The correct answer is **C: upa niwarthanika pradesha haraha riya paedaweema**

Here's why:

* **The question (Q)** asks what the speaker (who is describing a past event) would have done if they were in the speaker's (Q's) place, in the area where the speaker was waiting.
* **The context (P)** describes a situation where the speaker waited for the other person, offering a welcoming greeting and expressing how happy they were to see them. 
* **Option C** translates to ""If I were in your place, I would have waited in the area where you would have come."" This perfectly reflects the hypothetical scenario posed in the question, mirroring the situation described in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: waahanaye dorawal waedi welaawak viwurthawa thaebeema** (To have a great discussion in the welcoming area) -  This is a possible action, but not the core of what the speaker would *have done* if they were in the other person's position.
* **B: gimhanayedee riya paedaweema** (To have waited in the area where you would have come) - This is grammatically awkward and doesn't make sense in this context.
* **D: kandunagina atharathura waahanaya nosaelakilimath lesa thaebeema** (To have quietly waited for a long time in a secluded welcoming area) - While possible, the passage emphasizes a warm welcome, not a quiet, hidden wait.  Option C is a better fit with the welcoming tone.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, sandarbans pilibanda sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: ehi mulu bhoomi pramaanachayen adak waguru bim walin waesee aetha** (It covers a large area of land bordered by rivers).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sundarbaan varga ki.mee. 3,850 ka pradeshayak aawaranaya karana athara ein thunen ekak jala/vaguru pradeshawalin aawaranaya wee atha."" (The Sundarban covers an area of 3,850 square kilometers, bordered by rivers.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ehi ithiriwa aethi vishaala wanaanthara kihipayak aetha** (It is a large forest ecosystem): While true, the passage provides more specific information about the Sundarban's size and riverine borders.
* **C: eya lowa vishaalathama kadolaana theeruwa we** (It is a very large delta):  While the Sundarban *is* a delta, the passage focuses on its land area and river borders, not just its status as a delta.
* **D: bengaala kotinta wadaa waedi thith muwan mehi sitee** (It is located in the Bengal delta): While true, the passage provides more specific information about its area and borders.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
mema wanaantharaye kumana kotasa indiyanu bhoomi pradeshaya thula pihita thibeda?,"The correct answer is **A: sandarbans jaathika wanod‍yaanaya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Indiyaanu deshabhoomiya thula aethi wanaye kotasa sundarbaans jaathika vanodyaanaya lesa haedinve."" which translates to ""The Sundarbans national park is located on the Indian territory.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wanajiwee abhayabhoomiya (Wildlife Sanctuary):** While mentioned in the passage, it refers to a specific area *within* the Sundarbans, not the overall extent of Sundarbans on Indian land.
* **C: loka uruma adaviya (UNESCO World Heritage Forest):** This is a designation the Sundarbans has, but it doesn't specify the area on Indian land.
* **D: gangetik thaenna (Ganges delta):** The passage mentions the Ganges delta's influence on the Sundarbans, but it doesn't refer to the area on Indian land.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, ingreesi bhaashawa pilibanda awama washayen seemitha awabodhayak aethi aya kawurun viya haekida?","The correct answer is **A: awama washayen wenath bhaasha dekakwath katha karana pudgalayin (people who speak two languages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Miliyana is fluent in 5,000+ languages and understands written text in many languages. It emphasizes that her ability to understand and speak different languages is due to her ability to recognize the nuances of pronunciation and the connection between writing and speech.  It also points out her familiarity with various accents and dialects from different parts of the world.

This suggests that her ability to understand different languages is linked to having experience with and understanding the intricacies of language in general.  The phrasing ""awama washayen wenath bhaasha dekakwath katha karana pudgalayin"" (people who speak two languages) best captures this idea – someone who's had to navigate and understand more than one language is likely to be more receptive to understanding the nuances of other languages as well.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: wayasin adu aya (she is young):** While youth can contribute to language acquisition, the passage doesn't explicitly link her ability to her age.
* **C: toronto wetha gaman karana pudgalayin (people who have traveled to Toronto):**  Travel doesn't automatically make someone more linguistically adept.  The passage focuses on a broader understanding of language.
* **D: wayasin waedi aya (she is foolish):** This is completely irrelevant to the passage and her linguistic ability.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, uchchaaranaya kirimata apahasu viya haekke kumak da?","The correct answer is **A: wenas uchchaaranayak sahitha wachana (spoken words with pronunciation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of correct pronunciation.**  Miliyana's experience highlights how different accents and regional dialects significantly alter the meaning and impact of words. 
* **The question asks about improving pronunciation.** The passage directly states that ""boho vita paehaediliwa uchcharanaya kirimata apahasu wana lipinayan sambandhayen meya visesayen sathya we"" which translates to ""Many people have difficulty with pronunciation, and this is a special truth related to writing."" This implicitly suggests that *hearing* correct pronunciation is key.
* **Options B, C, and D are insufficient on their own.** While reading (B) and written words (C) are helpful, they don't guarantee correct pronunciation.  Regional dialects (D) can even *contribute* to pronunciation difficulties.

Therefore, the best way to improve pronunciation, based on the passage, is to hear words spoken with the correct pronunciation.



"
"chedayata anuwa, anthar disthrik bas naewathumen bas rathayak laba gaeneemata saelasum karana sanchaarakayekuta sudusu wanne kumana awasthaawada?","The correct answer is **A: sanchaarakaya jakar wetha gaman karana athara daenatamath tikat pathak miladee gena aetha**

Here's why:

* The passage states that buses leave at 6:30 and 7:30 AM, and that tickets are sold *before* the buses depart.
* Option A accurately reflects this: ""sanchaarakaya jakar wetha gaman karana athara daenatamath tikat pathak miladee gena aetha"" translates to ""the conductor has obtained tickets before the bus departs.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** The passage doesn't say the bus departs at 7:00 AM.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention a bus departing at 11:00 AM.
* **D:** The passage doesn't specify a bus departing at 6:20 AM.

Therefore, option A is the only one that aligns with the information provided in the text."

timbaktu pilibanda niwaeradi vistharayak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **B: eya dilidu bhawayen peedithayi** (it was a city afflicted by a dilindubhaavaya - a sense of despair/suffering).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Timbaktu, sanchaaraka aakarshanayak sahitha guvan thotupolakda sahitha nagarayak vuvat ada eya dilindubhaavayen pidita nagarayak bavata pathwa aetha.""  This translates to: ""Timbaktu, a city with the attraction of merchants and a fort with a grand appearance, was a city afflicted by a sense of despair/suffering.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eyata rate sesu pradeshawalata wadaa waediyen araabi balapaemak aetha** (it had a strong Arab influence in the southern regions of the country): While the passage mentions the city having an Arab-influenced appearance, it doesn't state that it had a *strong* Arab presence in the southern regions.
* **C: eyata guvan yanayen prawesha viya nohaeka** (it did not enter through the fort): The passage says the city *had* a fort, and merchants were attracted to it, so it *did* have entry points.
* **D: eya kuthuhalaya danawana sanchaarakayin sandaha aakarshanayak lesa pawathee** (it slightly attracted merchants who were curious): The passage says merchants were *attracted* to the city, which is a broader statement than just being ""curious."" It also mentions the city's visual appeal (""grand appearance"").



"
timbaktu pilibanda sathya wanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin kumakda?,"The correct answer is **C: awata nagara walata wadaa ehi aprikaanu swabhawaya aduya** (It has an African character among other cities).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Nagaraya thula aprikaanu svabhaavayata vada araabi svarupayak aethi baevin, eya rate anek nagaravalata vada sampurnayenma paahe venas svarupayak ganee."" (The city has an African character alongside an Arab structure, and this is seen throughout the country.)
* Option C directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nagarayata guvan yanayen prawesha viya haekiya** (It is a city that can be entered by going through the guvan.) - The text mentions it's a city with a guvan-connected road, but it doesn't say it's *only* accessible through the guvan.
* **B: meya darid‍rathawata wadaa anija we** (It is a city that is poor.) - The text doesn't mention anything about the city's poverty.  It describes its historical significance and cultural characteristics.
* **D: nagaraya thawaduratath sanchaarakayin aakarshanaya nokarayi** (The city does not attract carriers from afar.) - The text says the city *does* attract carriers due to its historical importance and being a key point on a historical trade route.



"
gimhana olimpik ulela paewaethweemata niyamithawa thibune kawadada? ,"The correct answer is **D: 2020 juli**.

The text states: ""Boho isav sandaha tikatpat yen 2,500 sita yen 130,000 athara pirivaeyak wana athara, saamaanya pirivaeya yen 7,000k wei. Avalangu kireeme pretipatti olympik paewaethweemata niyamithawa thibu 2020 juuli dakva dirgha nove."" This translates to: ""For the first time, tickets were available from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, and regular tickets were 7,000 yen. The opening ceremony of the Paralympics was held in July 2020.""
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, puneelayak waeni sulangak suli kunaatuvak bawata path wanne kumana awasthaawedee da?","The correct answer is **D: polowa sparsha kirimen pasu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a process:** The passage explains that to achieve a specific state (""adhika sulang""), one needs to perform a certain number of repetitions (100-200) of a specific action (touching a ""kunaatu"" with a ""polowa"" - possibly a cloth or tool).
* **The question asks about the state achieved *after* the action:** The question specifically asks what happens *after* touching the ""kunaatu"" with the ""polowa.""
* **The passage explicitly states the outcome:** The passage says, ""...eva polowa sparsha woo vitam """"kunaatu"""" bavata path we."" which translates to ""...and when touched with the 'polowa,' it will be revealed/become apparent.""

Therefore, option D directly reflects the information provided in the passage. The other options describe earlier stages of the process or unrelated events.
"
suli kunaatuvaka niwaeradi lakshanayak wanne mewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: ewa saema vitama paeyata saethapum 100-200 athara sulangak aethi karayi** (It is a mass of air that rises to a height of 100-200 meters).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Eva adhika sulang (paeyakata saethapum 100-200) aethi karana athara bara vastu vayuvata mudha haera kunaatu men raegena yaamatada haekiya.""  This directly translates to ""It rises to a height of about 100-200 meters and becomes a mass of air that rises and flows.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ewa boho vita bara wasthun samaga gaman karayi** (It travels with a large amount of other matter) - While it *becomes* associated with other matter, the core characteristic described in the passage is its vertical rise and height.
* **C: polowa sparsha kirimen pasuwa ewa puneela bawata path we** (After touching a sacred object, it flows to a holy place) -  This describes a *later* action of the ""suli"" and not its fundamental definition.
* **D: ewa wathaya pitathata thallu karana bhramanaya wana theeru we** (It becomes visible as a round movement when it rises) - This also describes a later observation and not the defining characteristic.



Therefore, option A accurately reflects the passage's description of ""suli kunaatuvaka"" (the rising mass of air)."
"ema chedayata anuwa, sanchaarakayeku thama gamanaantha nagaraye deshapalana thathwaya sambandhayen upades laba gatha yuththe kothaeninda?","The correct answer is **A: owun sanchaaraya kirimata yana rate rajayen (from the government of the country where they are communicating).**

Here's why:

The passage states that to ensure the safety of communicators and benefit from the advice of various nations, they should understand the political principles of the country they are communicating *to*.  Therefore, the advice they receive regarding political principles comes from the government of the country they are communicating with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: sanchaaraka upadeshanaya thula idiripath karana lada adahas walin (from the nations that prominently offer communication advice):** While other nations *might* offer advice, the passage emphasizes understanding the political principles of the *destination country*.
*   **C: owun sanchaaraya kirimata yana rate purawaesiyangen (from the citizens of the country where they are communicating):**  The passage doesn't suggest advice comes from citizens. It's about the government's principles.
*   **D: owungema rajayen (from their own government):** While their own government might offer advice, the passage focuses on the importance of understanding the political principles of the *receiving* country.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that a good communication protocol is one that is easily understood by people from different countries.  It specifically mentions the example of an American communicating with Europeans and Arabs.  The key is clarity and simplicity to ensure understanding across cultures.  A very simple summary of the country's political principles fulfills this requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: balapaemata lak wu awalangu kirime rakshanaya (protection of the most vulnerable points):** While important, this is about security, not communication protocol.
* **C: balapaemata lak wu sawukya rakshanaya (protection of the most important points):** Similar to A, this is focused on security.
* **D: rate deshapalana thaththwaya pilibanda savistharaathmaka thorathuru (a detailed and thorough explanation about the country's political principles):**  The paragraph explicitly states that detailed explanations are *not* suitable for a good communication protocol due to potential misunderstanding.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka niyojithayekugen wen karawa gaeneeme sahaya awashya weemata awama idak aeththe kumana aakaraye sanchaarayakata da?","The correct answer is **C: bhaashamaya badhakayak gena ena sanchaarayak (Communication with a language barrier)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that scheduled transportation is a good option for those who have difficulty communicating due to language or cultural differences.** The passage specifically states ""...boho niyojitayin boho saamaanya ven kireem labaa gaenimata kaemathi vuvada, boho niyojitayin visheshitha sanchaaraka, ayavaeya paraasayan ho gamanaantha sandahaa visheshagna wethi."" (Scheduled transportation offers a good way to travel for those who have difficulty with language or culture, and also specialized transportation for those with medical needs).

* **Option C directly addresses this difficulty with language.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: sanchaarakaya meeta pera sanchaaraya kara aethi nagarayaka waeda samuluwakata wana sanchaarayak (Communication with a driver who speaks the local language):** While helpful, this is a specific case of language difficulty, not the broader point the passage is making. The passage suggests scheduled transportation is beneficial even *if* the driver speaks the local language, implying it's useful when language is a *barrier*.
* **B: vishesha ayawaeyak sahitha sathi dekaka sanchaarayak (Communication with a wheelchair-accessible vehicle):** The passage mentions specialized transportation for medical needs, but it doesn't highlight wheelchair accessibility as the *primary* reason for using scheduled transportation.
* **D: sanchaarakayekuge palamu videsha sanchaaraya (Communication with a driver who speaks a foreign language):** This is a valid scenario, but the passage focuses on *any* language barrier, not just foreign languages.



Therefore, option C is the most aligned with the main point of the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaaraka niyojithayekuge upakarayen sanchaarakayekuta waedima prathilaabha laebenne kumana awasthaawedee da?","The correct answer is **A: sanchaarakaya thama upan rata naerabimata yana ena idiri guvan gaman wen karawa gannaa vita**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the benefit of a chauffeur-driven vehicle providing a comfortable and convenient journey.** It highlights the chauffeur's ability to offer a good alternative for travel, especially for those who value comfort, culture, language, and accessibility.
* **Option A directly reflects this benefit.**  It states that the chauffeur can drive the passenger directly to their destination without any issues. This aligns with the passage's description of a smooth and trouble-free journey.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: sanchaarakaya palamu warata vishesha chaarikawak wen karawa gaeneemata unanduwak dakwana vita:** While a chauffeur might offer specialized services, the passage focuses more on the general comfort and convenience.
* **C: sanchaarakaya niwadu gamanaanthaye maw bhaashawen chathura lesa katha kirimata haeki vita:**  The passage mentions language skills as a benefit, but doesn't make it a primary point.
* **D: sanchaarakaya thamanta hurupurudu sanskruthika wenaskam aethi sthaanayakata sanchaaraya karana vita:**  Cultural knowledge is mentioned, but again, the passage emphasizes a broader sense of comfort and accessibility.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
"mema chedayata anuwa, nawa sthaana naerabimata sanchaaraya kirimedee balaaporoththu sunweema walakwa gaeneemata sanchaarakayekuta upakara kala haekke kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: owun thama ratata samana neethiwalata anugatha weema** (They should abide by the customs and ethics of their new country).

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that when moving to a new place, one must adapt to the local ways of life – including customs, ethics, food, transportation, and language.  The core idea is about respecting and adhering to the rules and norms of the new environment.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: owun thama rate parisarayata samana pramitheen apekshaa kirima** (They should expect the same standards of environment in their new country): While environmental standards *can* differ, the primary focus of the passage is on social and ethical norms, not just environmental ones.
* **B: nuhuru aahara athhada baeleemata aethi kaemaeththa** (Rejecting new food habits):  Food habits are part of the overall cultural adaptation, but the passage isn't *solely* about food.
* **D: nawathaen pilibandawa kalin paryeshana kirimen waelakee siteema** (Implementing a new system for waste management): This is a very specific example and not the overarching principle the passage is advocating.



Therefore, option C best encapsulates the central message of the passage.

"mema chedaye aethi thorathuru matha padanamwa, videsheeya ratakata sanchaaraya karana vita balaaporoththu sunweemak athvindiya haekke kumana aakaraye pudgalayekutada?","The correct answer is **B: wenasweem matha samurddhimath wana kenek (someone who seeks wealth and prosperity).**

Here's why:

The first passage describes how communication (specifically, international communication) has led to a massive increase in the scale of global interactions. It states that this interaction impacts all aspects of life, from culture and values to transportation and technology.  It then expresses concern that we've become overly focused on a particular *size* or *scale* in these interactions.

The question asks what kind of person is driven by the desire to travel abroad and communicate internationally.  The passage suggests this motivation stems from a desire for wealth and prosperity (""wenasweem matha samurddhimath wana kenek"").  International communication often opens up opportunities for economic advancement.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: videsheeya aahara walata kaemathi kenek (someone who likes foreign food):**  While enjoying foreign food might be a perk of international travel, it's not the primary driver for someone to engage in widespread communication.
* **C: sanwurtha manasak aethi kenek (someone with a noble spirit):**  While someone with a noble spirit *might* engage in international communication, the passage focuses on the more practical, and arguably materialistic, driving force.
* **D: igeneemen sathutak labana kenek (someone seeking spiritual enlightenment):** While international travel can be a path to spiritual growth, it's not the most common or direct motivation, and the passage's tone doesn't align with a spiritual quest.



Therefore, **B** is the best fit based on the passage's emphasis on the scale and impact of global communication and the concerns it raises.

palamu warata sanvardhanaya wemin pawathina ratakata yana sanchaarakayeku sandaha nirdeshitha yojanaawak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: kandawuru baendeemedee sayaanayak ho ellena aendak nirdesha kere.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the suggested plan for a guide traveling to Palamu for conservation efforts.** The text emphasizes the importance of protecting wildlife (snakes, boas, and other creatures) and creating a wildlife sanctuary.
* **Option C directly addresses this by suggesting creating a wildlife sanctuary.**  The text specifically mentions the need to protect these animals and implies a sanctuary is a key part of the conservation plan.
* **Options A, B, and D are not directly related to the core conservation effort.**  They touch on other aspects (tourism, food, hospitality) but aren't the main focus of the guide's task as described in the text.

Therefore, creating a wildlife sanctuary (""kandawuru baendeemedee sayaanayak ho ellena aendak nirdesha kere"") is the most logical and direct response to the question based on the provided text.



"
"sanvardhanaya wemin pawathina ratawalata anuwarthanaya wana vita, naasthi kirima watee yaeyi sandahan nokaranne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: kandawuru baendeema sandaha mettayak ho thunee kottayak**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What is the specific action being advocated to promote development in rural areas, related to the text's emphasis on preserving biodiversity?
* **The text mentions:** Protecting elephants, tigers, and other animals (kandawuru baendeema) is crucial for the cultural and economic development of the region.
* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""kandawuru baendeema sandaha mettayak ho thunee kottayak"" translates to ""a compassionate approach towards preserving wildlife.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: batahira aakaraye aahara (high-quality food):** While important for tourism, it's not the core conservation action being emphasized.
* **B: gunathmaka sewaawan (quality services):** Similar to food, quality services are a supporting element, not the primary conservation focus.
* **D: gunathmaka hotal (quality hotel):** Again, a supporting element for tourism, not the central conservation effort.



Therefore, option C aligns perfectly with the text's call to action for wildlife conservation as a key to development."

Here's why:

The original text describes a scenario where someone is helping another person with ""pitapathak"" (practice/method), likely a skill or technique. It emphasizes protecting this ""pitapathak"" from unauthorized access.

The question asks for a way to protect the ""pitapathak"" *without* requiring the recipient to connect to the internet (antharjalaya).

Option C directly addresses this by stating that the practice/method should be taken from the recipient's laptop. This action completely avoids internet connectivity and directly protects the ""pitapathak"" by removing it from the recipient's access.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sanchaaraka sahakaruta pitapathak laba deema (Receiving the practice/method through carrier cooperation):** This implies using a carrier (like a mobile network provider) to deliver the information, which likely involves internet connection.
* **B: thamantama pitapathakak eemelayen yaeweema (Sending the practice/method via email):**  Email requires internet access.
* **D: klawud thula pitapathak gabadaa kirima (Uploading the practice/method to the cloud):**  The cloud is, by definition, internet-based.



Therefore, option C is the only plausible way to protect the ""pitapathak"" without relying on internet connectivity.

"mema chedayata anuwa, rakshana prathipaththiye darshanaya kirimata awashya nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: himikam illeem idiripath kirima sandaha jathyanthara durakathana anka**

Here's why:

The question asks which of the options is *not* required for observing the principle of protective reciprocity (rakshana prathipaththiye darshanaya).  Let's break down the Sinhala text and each option:

* **The text outlines the principles of protective reciprocity:** This includes offering guidance and assistance, sharing information (especially contact details), and protecting someone's privacy.  It specifically mentions not sharing their information (like email or phone number) with others.

* **A: himikam illeem idiripath kirima sandaha jathyanthara durakathana anka (information sharing regarding long-distance communication):** The text explicitly states *not* sharing someone's information (email, phone number) with others.  Therefore, sharing information about long-distance communication is *not* required for observing protective reciprocity, but is actively discouraged.

* **B: rakshana samaagame eemel lipinaya (email address in protection):** The text mentions providing email addresses *as* part of sharing information, but doesn't say it's a requirement for observing the principle.  It's more of a tool for providing contact details.

* **C: awasara laba gaeneema sandaha jathyanthara durakathana anka (information sharing regarding immediate access):** The text doesn't mention sharing information regarding immediate access.

* **D: rakshana oppuhimiyage eemel lipinaya (email address of the protected person):** Sharing the protected person's email address is *against* the principles of protective reciprocity, as it violates their privacy.

Therefore, the *least* relevant and *potentially harmful* element among the options is sharing information about long-distance communication.

"mema chedayata anuwa, bahulawa bhaavitha wana chithrapata aakruthiya pilibimbu karanne kumana rinathmaka pramaanayada?","The correct answer is **C: mi.mee. rina 35**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the *format* of the image sensor. The text states that the ""mee 35"" format (which is 35mm) offers a 4x crop compared to the medium format (6x6). This means the 35mm sensor is smaller and captures a smaller portion of the image compared to the 6x6 sensor.

Therefore, the format of the image sensor being discussed is 35mm."

This translates to: ""When you want to get a finer division, you can attach a lens to a DSLR camera. A medium-format camera is 6 x 6 cm in size, and it can achieve a finer division with a 56 x 56 cm lens. This 35mm lens (3136 x 2864 pixels) provides a 4x finer division.""

The text explicitly mentions that the 35mm lens provides a 4x finer division, and asks which image format achieves a similar division. Therefore, the answer must be the 35mm lens format.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the *final* step to launch a communication script business.** The prompt states you need a website to build a communication script blog.  The logical next step is to actually create that website.
* **Option C directly addresses this by stating the need to build the website.**
* **Option A** is too broad and doesn't specify the crucial step of creating the website itself.
* **Option B** is a good idea *before* creating a website, but it's not the *final* step. You need a website *first*.
* **Option D** focuses on skill improvement, which is important but not the direct action required to launch the business.



Therefore, creating the website is the essential final step mentioned in the context of the provided problem."

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What steps are needed to start a courier (sanchaaraka) script business?""
* **The initial statement says:** ""To start a courier script business, you need to complete these five steps: ...build a web adavi (web portal/website).""
* **Therefore, building the web adavi is a crucial and directly mentioned step in the process.**

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: blogkaranaya (Blogging):** While a blog *could* be part of a courier script business's marketing, it's not a fundamental requirement to *start* the business.
* **B: web haedathala gaenweema (Web hosting):** Web hosting is necessary for a website to exist, but it's not the *creation* of the website itself.  You need to *build* the website *before* you can host it.
* **C: sanskaranaya kirima (Editing/Customization):**  Editing and customization are steps that come *after* the basic web adavi is built.



"
badawael aash‍ritha gaetalu bahulawa daknata laebenne kumana aakaraye deshagunayaka da?,"The correct answer is **A: seethala deshaguna (cold climate)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Vadaa shitala deshaguna tattva thula shvasana gaetalu men..."" which translates to ""In cold climate, the predominant respiratory systems are..."". It then goes on to say that cold climate organisms are more likely to have bacteria in their gut.

The question asks which climate is associated with the prevalence of bacteria in the gut, and the text directly links this to cold climates. The text contrasts this with warm climates (unusum deshaguna) where gut bacteria are less prevalent. Therefore, the correct answer is cold climate (seethala deshaguna).
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, nithipatha niraawaranaya weemen prathishakthiya aethi viya haekke kumak sandahada?","The correct answer is **A: badawael aashritha gaetalu (cold-adapted genes)**.

Here's why:

The text explains that the spread of bacteria to new environments is facilitated by genes that allow them to survive in various conditions.  It specifically mentions that bacteria that thrive in cold environments (""shitala deshaguna tattva thula shvasana gaetalu men"" - cold-adapted genes are often found in respiratory genes) are able to survive and proliferate in new locations. This is linked to historical events like the Black Death, the Plague of Justinian, and the collapse of the Aztec empire, all of which were caused by the spread of diseases carried by bacteria with broad adaptability.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: desheeya vishabeeja (national virus):** The text focuses on bacteria, not viruses.
*   **C: shwasana gaetalu (respiratory genes):** While respiratory genes *can* be cold-adapted, it's the broader category of cold-adapted genes that explains the widespread dispersal.
*   **D: dilli beli (Black Death):** The Black Death is an example of a historical event caused by the spread of bacteria, but not the *reason* for the spread itself. It's a consequence.

Here's why:

The passage states that obtaining a Schengen visa is necessary for travel within the Schengen area. Option A directly reflects the requirement of applying for a visa. The other options are not the primary requirements for travel and visa application:

*   **B: mudal ithiri kirima** (financial proof) is important but not the core requirement mentioned.
*   **C: bahu videsha gaman balapathra murapolawal walakwa gaeneema** (travel insurance) is recommended but not strictly required to get a visa.
*   **D: videsha gaman balapathra awashyathawayak nomaetha** (international travel document) is a general statement and not specific to the Schengen visa process.

Therefore, applying for a visa is the fundamental step in getting permission to travel within the Schengen area, as highlighted in the provided text."

This translates to: ""The amazing treasures found in his tomb are of such a nature that they are like nothing else found in the Egyptian treasure house. It is considered good to take the remains of the deceased away for a limited time.""

Therefore, the passage indicates that the treasures are found *with* the remains (his remains).  Option B, ""mameeyage hisa"" (my remains), directly reflects this.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: samahara saerasili (sand and dust):** While the tomb was filled with sand, the passage isn't discussing the presence of sand.
*   **C: mamiyage urahis (his organs):** The passage focuses on the overall treasures and the tomb itself, not specifically on organs.
*   **D: dhanaya (wealth):** The passage mentions wealth (""vismayajanaka vastu"" - amazing treasures), but it's not the core point of the question. The question asks *what* is found in the tomb, and the passage specifically points to his remains *with* the treasures.

This translates to: ""...we, as interested people, should dress warmly and, as citizens of Vancouver, should take the SkyTrain to Granville Street to experience the winter atmosphere.""

The question asks where it is attractive to go in Vancouver. The passage directly points to **Granville Street** as a place to experience the Vancouver winter and as a destination accessible via SkyTrain.

"mema chedayata anuwa, sanchaarakayinta avyaaja waenkuwar athdaekeemak laba deemata boho durata ida aethi gamanaanthaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: waenkuwar nagara madhyaya (Vancouver city center)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Vancouver city center as a popular tourist destination.**  It mentions attractions, transportation (SkyTrain), and the city's popularity due to the 2010 Olympics.
* **The question asks about the location that is most accessible for tourists to easily reach Vancouver.** The passage explicitly states the SkyTrain connects to the city center.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **Bovan dupata (Bovan Dupaata):** This is a place mentioned in the passage but not as the primary tourist hub.
    * **Vistlar (Whistler):**  Whistler is mentioned for its winter activities but is a separate location from Vancouver city center.
    * **Graenvil doopatha (Granville Docks):** While popular, Granville Docks is a specific area *within* Vancouver city center, not the city center itself.

Therefore, the Vancouver city center is the most logical and accurate answer to the question of where tourists should aim to arrive for easy access to the city.

* **The passage states:** ""Vaesi samaye dee (novaembar sita maarthu dakva), jala parimaava vadaa ihala yanu aethi athara, diya aella vadaa camatkaarajanaka vanu aetha.""  This translates to: ""At that time (November to March), the water level rises, and the water inundates the land, causing extraordinary floods.""

The question asks when the area is most susceptible to flooding.  The passage directly links the flooding to the high water levels during November to March.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nowaembar sita maarthu dakwa (November to March):** While this is *a* time of flooding, the question asks about the *most* susceptible time.  The passage emphasizes the rising water levels.
* **B: sanchaaraka samaya thula (during communication time):** This is irrelevant to the flooding itself.
* **D: waesi samayen pitatha (at that time):** This is too general.  It doesn't specify the *reason* for the flooding.

* The passage states: ""Oba paalama tharanaya kalahot ho diya aella asalin vaeti aethi adipaara osse gaman kalahot oba theth wana bhava sahatika ya. Anek athata, eyata hetuva wanne jala pramaanaya ithaa ihala gos ema jala kanda hetuven diya aellehi oba dakina sathya penuma avahira vimayi.""  This translates to: ""The bridge's foundation is almost submerged due to the remarkably high water levels. Often, this is caused by the water volume exceeding the capacity of the river, and the water levels are clearly visible.""
* The passage also explicitly mentions that during November to March, water levels are exceptionally high (""Vaesi samaye dee (novaembar sita maarthu dakva), jala parimaava vadaa ihala yanu aethi athara, diya aella vadaa camatkaarajanaka vanu aetha."").

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information provided in the passage.

Here's why:

* The original text (P) states that the speaker doesn't have the authority to recommend a drone for medical treatment.
* It emphasizes that if you feel the need for treatment, you should get a thorough medical examination. 
* Options B and C relate to authority and jurisdiction, which are not the primary response to someone seeking medical help.
* Option D is related to the regulations around drones and medical treatment, but it's not the immediate solution for someone who *needs* treatment.

Therefore, the most logical and helpful response, according to the context of the original text, is to advise the person to seek the necessary medical tests.

Here's why:

* The original text (P) discusses the potential use of drones for medical emergencies and the legal issues surrounding their use in Sri Lanka. 
* It specifically mentions that using drones to deliver medical supplies to a person's location is currently not permitted in Sri Lanka due to existing regulations. 
* Option A directly reflects this point: ""awata sitina aya d‍ronayak thibeema pilibandawa karadara nowana thaena"" - meaning ""It's not possible to deliver a drone to a person's location for that purpose.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: saaman‍yayen chayaroopa gaeneemata awasara naethi pradeshawala** -  This is incorrect because the text indicates that drone delivery *is* considered for medical emergencies, implying a need for speed.
* **C: d‍ronaya aduwen penena karyabahula sthaanawala** - While drones might be used in workplaces, the text focuses on delivering to individuals, not workplaces.
* **D: e sandaha oba pera awasara laba gath pradeshawala** -  The text doesn't suggest that drone use is more prevalent in any particular province. It highlights the legal restrictions across the entire country.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that visa requirements for certain activities (like staying in hotels) *do not* apply if you are staying with your tour group.
* Option A directly reflects this key exception: if you are with your tour group, you don't need to submit visa details.
* The other options are incorrect because:
    * **B:** Not all countries require you to submit details to local authorities.
    * **C:** While submitting details to immigration is required, the passage emphasizes the exception for tour groups.

This translates to: ""In any case, you can write the location and signature with your local law enforcement officer."" This clearly indicates the local police station is the designated place for this action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: owun naewathee sitina hotalaya (the hotel they are staying at):** The text explicitly says this isn't the appropriate place.
* **C: pradesheeya thaepael kaaryaalayak (local immigration office):** While immigration might be involved in some cases, the text focuses on the police officer's involvement in documenting the situation.
* **D: aagamana vigamana kaaryaala (arrival and departure office):** Similar to the immigration office, this isn't the primary location for the police documentation mentioned.

Therefore, the local police station is the correct place to report and document the situation as described in the text.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the benefits of communication:** It highlights gaining new knowledge, understanding different cultures, improving self-perception, and finding new opportunities. It also mentions the benefits of having a network and a perspective to navigate life.
* **Option D directly reflects these benefits:**  Someone seeking a network and a fresh perspective aligns perfectly with the advantages described in the passage. 
* **Other options are less directly related:**
    * **A:** While making new friends is a benefit, it's not the core message of the text.
    * **B:**  Having a supportive person is good, but the text speaks more broadly about the power of communication itself.
    * **C:**  Gaining new skills is a potential outcome, but it's not the primary benefit the text emphasizes.



Therefore, option D is the best fit because it captures the overall essence of the text's benefits of communication."

Here's why:

* **The Question (Q)** asks what a communication device with limited range can offer a person who wants to freely travel abroad.
* **The Passage (P)** describes the benefits of communication and mobility (like travel) enabling new experiences, cultural understanding, and personal growth. It mentions the ability to freely travel and get new opportunities.
* **Option C** directly addresses this by stating that a communication device with limited range can provide both communication *and* the ability to move around. This aligns perfectly with the passage's emphasis on freedom of movement and access to new opportunities.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: waetupak saema vitama pahe laba denu laebe (You can get a significant profit from it)** - The passage doesn't focus on profit; it's about personal growth and experiences.
* **B: eya saaman‍yayen raekiya awasthaawan hata manga padayi (It is a tool that can be used in any situation)** - While communication devices *can* be used in many situations, the question specifies *abroad* and *free travel*. The passage emphasizes the benefits related to travel.
* **D: eya obata idiri darshanayak laba gaeneemata upakaree we (It helps you gain a new perspective)** -  While a communication device *could* contribute to a new perspective, the passage highlights broader benefits like cultural understanding and personal growth, not just a ""new perspective.""

The passage highlights that many people were booking complete Disney resort packages (including hotels, park tickets, etc.) through online platforms like eBay and Craigslist.  This implies that the *entire* Disney experience within the resort was being booked as a single unit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ud‍yaana gaweshanaya karamin sathiyak gatha kirima** (Searching for a discount): While some might search for discounts, the core issue described isn't about finding a lower price, but about the unusual method of booking the entire experience.
* **B: sthaaneeya nowana hotalayaka nawathaen gaeneema** (Staying at a local, new hotel): This is completely unrelated to the passage's main point about Disney resort bookings.
* **D: guvanthotupale sita hotalayata bas rathayak laba gaeneema** (Getting a bus to the hotel within the park):  This is just transportation and not the central theme of comprehensive package booking.



Therefore, the best answer reflects the central unusual trend: booking the whole Disney resort experience as a package, rather than individual components.

wolt disni warld pilibanda sathya nowanne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: pak-hopar tikatpath wenath sanchaarakayin wetha maru kala haekiya**

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""Bohovita saamaanya katayuttak wana meya, disni visin thahanam kara aetha: enam pravesha pathra maaru kala nohaeki ya.""  This translates to ""Many ordinary people have been deceived by Disney: the entrance tickets are not valid.""
* Option A directly reflects this deception: ""pak-hopar tikatpath wenath sanchaarakayin wetha maru kala haekiya"" which translates to ""the ticket purchased online is invalid.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sthaanaye nawathaen pahasukam aetha** (There is a new hospital nearby) - The passage doesn't mention hospitals.
* **C: guvan thotupale sita parish‍raya dakwa sanchaarakayin prawaahanaya kirima sandaha bas ratha aetha** (There is a bus that runs based on the schedule of the park's housing) - The passage doesn't mention buses or housing schedules.
* **D: bahu dina tikatpath boho vita wendesi web adavi walin soyagatha haekiya** (Many people are going to fake websites to buy multi-day tickets) - While the passage *does* mention fake websites, it's not the core truth being revealed. The core truth is that the tickets themselves are fake.

"mema chedayata anuwa, boho durata wurththeeya puhunu panthiyaka ho prakaashanaye dee aawaranaya nowanne pahatha daekwena vishayayangen kawareda?","The correct answer is **C: yuda kalaapa soodaanama (Warfare studies)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""What subject matter do you think would best cover the gap in information about warfare?""
* **The passage states:** ""Wanaanthara thula paewaethma sambandhava aethi poth saha sangaraa sulabha namuth yuda kalaapa sambandhayen kerena prakaashana svalpa ya."" (Although there are books and resources related to military history, there is very little publication specifically about warfare.)
* **Therefore, the gap is in warfare studies.**  Option C directly addresses this need.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: wanaanthara thula paewaethma (Military History):**  While related, military history focuses on past conflicts. The question is about *warfare* in a broader sense, potentially including modern techniques and strategies.
* **B: prathamaadhaara soodaanama (First-line tactics):** This is too narrow.  First-line tactics are only *one aspect* of warfare.
* **D: bhoomikaa ranganaya (Role playing):** Role playing is a training method, not a subject matter for understanding warfare.



"
"mema chedayata anuwa, wurththeeya puhunu panthiyaka aawaranaya kirimata boho durata ida aeththe pahatha sandahan vishayayangen kawareda?","The correct answer is **A: prathamaadhaara (foreground)**.

Here's why:

The question asks about the difficulty of finding resources related to the historical war (yuddha kalaapaya), *specifically* resources about the first line of defense (prathamaadhaara).  The text states: ""Paatamaalaavak saamaanyayen dina 2-5 k pawathina athara, bhumikaa ranganaya, bohomayak prathamaadhaara saha aetaem vita aayudha puhunuva aetulat vanu aetha."" (Usually within 2-5 days, the foreground, a lot of the first line of defense, and the weapons used are available.)

Therefore, the question is directly asking about the availability of resources for the ""prathamaadhaara"" (first line of defense), making it the most relevant option. The other options are too broad or refer to different aspects of the war.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, jalaya apavithra weemen walakwa gaeneema sandaha wana hondama vikalpaya kumakda?","The correct answer is **C: ek miniththuwak sandaha jalaya unu karanna (Boiling water for one minute)**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text emphasizes the importance of boiling water for a specific duration (one minute) to make it safe for drinking, especially when the water source is of various forms and potentially contaminated.** The text highlights the need for this practice to ensure safety.
* **Option C directly aligns with the text's recommendation.**
* **Option A (miniththu kihipayak sandaha jalaya unu karanna - Boiling water for a minute) is a repetition of a key recommendation already stated.**
* **Option B (bothal kala jalaya miladee ganna - Drinking bottled water) isn't always feasible or sustainable.**
* **Option D (nishchitha tharjana pilibandawa jalaya aegayeemata lak karanna - Aiming to purify water based on a specific location) is too vague and doesn't guarantee safety.**

Therefore, boiling water for one minute is the most direct and relevant solution based on the provided text.

"mema chedayata anuwa, daksha pihinumkaruwanta pawaa kala nohaeki viya haekke kumak da?","The correct answer is **C: diyaraeliwalata erehiwa pihineema (Swimming in the ocean)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the benefits of swimming in the ocean for health and well-being. It specifically mentions that swimming in the ocean can provide a sense of joy and motivation to achieve goals. The question asks what kind of swimming would be beneficial for someone lacking confidence in their swimming skills.

Option C, ""diyaraeliwalata erehiwa pihineema"" (Swimming in the ocean), aligns with the passage's positive portrayal of ocean swimming and the implied goal of building confidence. The other options aren't directly mentioned or emphasized in the context of building confidence and motivation like ocean swimming is.
"
oba diya raellakata hasu wuwahoth oba kumak kala yuthuda?,"The correct answer is **B: diya raellata erehiwa wegayen pihinanna (Pihinanna samanyayata diya raellata erehiwa wegayen kiya.)**

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes the importance of *active* and *enthusiastic* paddling.  It also suggests that paddling with a focus on the center of the paddle will lead to efficient movement.

*   **Option B** aligns with this by suggesting a paddling motion directed towards the side (erehiwa) and using the full length of the paddle.  This is a common and effective paddling technique.
*   **Option A** suggests randomly paddling – not efficient or directed.
*   **Option C** suggests paddling in the opposite direction – counterproductive.
*   **Option D** suggests paddling towards the center of the water – also not a recommended technique.

Therefore, option B is the most consistent with the advice given in the text.
"
"mema chedayata anuwa, balakotuwakata sanchaaraya kirimama watinaa niwadu vinoda chaarikawak viya haekke kumana sthaanayeda?","The correct answer is **D: onaema miridiya jala maargayak asala** (the Miridiya canal itself).

Here's why:

* **The question asks where the recreational facilities for cycling and walking would be best located.**
* **The passage states that the Miridiya canal is currently being considered for widening and developing a path along it.**
* **The passage mentions the need for recreational areas along the canal for activities like walking, cycling, and enjoying nature.**

Therefore, the Miridiya canal is the most logical location for these recreational facilities. The other options are not directly supported by the text:

* **A: daenub dige nagarayak (urban areas):** While urban areas might have recreational facilities, the passage focuses on the canal.
* **B: eeri aela asala (the lake area):** The passage doesn't mention a lake.
* **C: rayin nimnaye (forests):**  The passage doesn't mention forests as a location for these facilities.

"mema chedayata anuwa, pradeshaye sanchaaraya karana kaanthavanta sudusu upadesak nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?","The correct answer is **B: sanskruthika wenaskam desheeya janathawage daedi haesireemata hethu viya haeki bawa karunawen salakanna**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What should be done to prevent people from traveling to the region to see those who are not married or who are in extramarital relationships?
* **The provided text (P) states:**  It's necessary to prevent people from traveling to see those who are not married or in extramarital relationships. This is due to cultural sensitivities and the potential for negative impacts on the local community.
* **Option B aligns with the text:** Option B directly addresses the problem by suggesting that cultural sensitivities should be respected and that actions should be taken to prevent situations that could cause offense or harm to the local community. It's a culturally sensitive approach.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: viwahaka aviwahaka thaththwaya saakachcha kirimen walakinna (controlling marriage and non-marriage relationships):** This is overly restrictive and impractical. It's not feasible or appropriate to try and control people's personal relationships.
    * **C: deepthimath aabharana paelandeemen walakinna (distributing bright jewels):** This is irrelevant to the core issue of preventing unwanted visits.
    * **D: awashya wita daedi bawa penwanna (necessarily respecting customs):**  While respecting customs is important, the question asks what *actions* should be taken to prevent unwanted visits. Option B gives a more concrete approach.

Therefore, option B is the most logical and appropriate response based on the given text and question."
"mema chedaye visthara kara aethi pradeshaya matha padanamwa, kaantha sanchaarakayin sandaha prayojanawath ingiyak wanu aeththe kumak da?","The correct answer is **C: sanskruthika wenaskam awabodha kara gaeneema yanu obe sthaawaraye siteemen waelakee sitiya yuthu bawayi.**

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** ""For the state where you are expanding your business, what is the use of knowing about the 'kantha sancharakaya' (a traditional social custom)?"".
* **The text explains:** The ""kantha sancharakaya"" is a tradition where a man waits patiently at his home, expecting a woman to visit.  It's a cultural practice that needs to be understood and respected.
* **Option C directly addresses this:** It suggests understanding the cultural custom and respecting the traditional expectations within the community. This is relevant to expanding a business in a new state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: luhubaendeema saaman‍ya deyak nowana bawa handunaa gaeneema (Knowing general items related to expansion):** While useful, it's not specifically about understanding this particular cultural custom.
* **B: viwahaka bawa sankethawath kirima sandaha vishaala muddak palandinna (To have a wide understanding about signaling a marriage):** This is too narrow. The custom is broader than just marriage signaling.
* **D: anawashya luhubaendeemak aethi awasthaawaka, oba purushayin sthira lesa prathikshepa karanna (To take unnecessary steps, to patiently wait for the man):** This is a misinterpretation of the custom. It's not about unnecessary steps; it's about respecting a cultural tradition.



Therefore, understanding the ""kantha sancharakaya"" is about understanding and respecting the cultural norms of the state, which is crucial for successful business expansion. Option C encapsulates this best."
"mema chedaya matha padanamwa, wanajiwee chayaroopa shilpiyekuta vishesha kachayak bhaavitha kirimata awashya viya haekke kumana awasthaaweda?","The correct answer is **D: wanod‍yaanayakata wanajiwee chayaroopakaranaya sambandhayen vishesha neethireethi thibe nam** (The botanical garden has a special policy regarding botanical artwork).

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes a need for specific guidelines.** It states that the creation and display of botanical artwork in botanical gardens requires a set of rules and policies. This is mentioned multiple times.
* **Option D directly addresses this need for a specific policy.** It connects the creation of botanical artwork to the botanical garden's existing policies.
* **Options A, B, and C are too narrow.** 
    * Option A focuses solely on the artist's livelihood. While important, it's not the primary focus of the passage.
    * Option B focuses only on commercial aspects, not the broader policy framework.
    * Option C focuses only on potential negative consequences and doesn't address the policy itself.

The passage stresses the need for regulations concerning the creation and display of botanical artwork within the botanical garden, and option D accurately reflects this central theme."
wanajiwee chayaroopa shilpeenta aethi viya haeki abhiyogayak lesa chedaye sandahan kara nomaeththe pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: nishchitha videsheeya sathun soya gaeneema (certain foreign species are being used).**

Here's why:

The passage states that a key issue with using ""wanajivi jaaayarupakaranaya"" (wildlife souvenirs) is the potential for promoting the use of certain foreign species. It emphasizes that the trade involves many foreign species and raises concerns about their introduction and impact on local ecosystems.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: aakramanasheelee sathun samaga katayuthu kirima (coexistence with invasive species):** While the passage mentions the threat of invasive species, the central concern isn't necessarily about coexistence, but about *promoting* their use through souvenir trade.
* **C: awashya kaacha wargaya laba gaeneema (the necessity of obtaining the certain species):** The passage criticizes the trade, suggesting it isn't a necessity but rather a harmful practice.
* **D: anathurudayaka parisarayaka waeda kirima (damage to the vulnerable environment):**  While environmental damage is a concern, the passage explicitly links the problem to the *use* of certain foreign species in souvenir trade.



Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the core issue highlighted in the passage."
kandu mankada haraha gaman karana riyadurekuta awama gaetalu aethi karanne pahatha sandahan karunu walin monawada?,"The correct answer is **B: adu gharshanaya (reduced friction)**.

Here's why:

The passage explains that ice and snow on roads reduce friction between the tires and the road surface. This reduced friction is why it's difficult to steer and control vehicles on icy/snowy roads. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: adhika waahana thadabadaya (increased vehicle speed):** Increased speed would *worsen* the problem, not solve it.
*   **C: adhika ghaneebhawanaya (increased density):** Increased density of something doesn't directly address the issue of reduced friction.
*   **D: adu drushyathawa (reduced visibility):** Reduced visibility is a separate hazard, but not the primary reason for the difficult driving conditions.

Therefore, the core problem addressed in the passage is the **reduced friction**, making option B the correct answer."
vividha ratawala aadayam badu sambandhayen sthaawarawa paewathiya haekke kumakda?,"The correct answer is **A: anupaatha (proportional)**.

The passage states: ""...aadayam badhu ek ek ratawalata venas lesa vyuhaatmaka wana athara badhu anupaathikayan saha seemawan ek ratakin thavat ratakata behevin venas we."" This translates to ""...income should be slightly planned in each country, and the income of each country should be proportional to its size.""

Therefore, the income distribution should be **proportional** to the size of each country.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: vyuhaya (strategic)** - While a strategic approach is mentioned, the key characteristic of the distribution is *proportionality*.
*   **C: oba gonu karana thaena (what you want to do)** - This is irrelevant to the core concept of the passage.
*   **D: warahan (war)** - This is completely unrelated to the context."
"mema chedayata anuwa, oba videshayanhi waeda karana namuth wenath thaenaka sitee nam, oba obe aadayam badu gonu karanne koheda?","The correct answer is **B: eksath janapadaye (Together with the province)**.

Here's why:

The first paragraph of the text states that revenue collected from foreign services should be shared proportionally between the province and the country.  Option B directly reflects this principle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: oba saaman‍yayen sitina thaena (Where you normally reside)**: This refers to individual taxation, not the revenue from foreign services being shared.
* **C: oba daenata waeda karana rate (The country where you work)**: While the country where the work is done is relevant to the *source* of the revenue, the text emphasizes the *sharing* of that revenue between the province and the country, not just where the work is performed.
* **D: aduma gaasthuk aethi thaena (None of the above)**:  Since option B aligns with the text's statement, this is incorrect.



"
loka pradarshanaya niwaeradiwa visthara nokaranne pahatha sandahan prakaashawalin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: mema vishesha siduweema masa hayak dakwa paewathiya haekiya (Our special achievements are limited to a few months).**

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""Loka Pradarshana"" (World Exhibition) is usually a large international platform showcasing various cultures and histories. It emphasizes its cultural and educational aspects. However, it also explicitly mentions that its ""special achievements"" are limited to a few months within a year, and it can only be held on a relatively small area (50 hectares).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: pradarshana magin rataka ithihasaya ho sanskruthiya pradarshanaya kala haekiya (The exhibition's route doesn't showcase the history and culture of the participating countries).**  The passage directly contradicts this. It states the exhibition *does* showcase the cultures and histories of participating countries.
* **B: udbhida vid‍yathmaka pradarshana kalaathmaka ha adhyaapanika pradarshana samaga pradarshanaya kere (The exhibition didn't include both scientific and artistic/educational exhibitions).** The passage specifically states the exhibition *did* include both scientific and artistic/educational exhibitions.
* **D: ratawal sahabhagee weema awashya naetha (Participating countries weren't necessarily required).** The passage says that the exhibition is held *with* the participation of countries.



Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects information presented in the passage.



"
loka pradarshanaye ho jathyanthara pradarshanaye neethireethi wanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **A: rataka ithihasaya saha loka prashna yana dekama pradarshanaya kala yuthuya.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** The Global Exhibition is a large international platform showcasing cultural and historical aspects of participating countries.  It aims to present artistic and educational displays related to the relationship between gardens, landscape architecture, and plant species.

* **Option A directly reflects this:**  It says the exhibition is a platform to showcase a country's history and global issues.  This aligns perfectly with the text's description of cultural and historical displays.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ekama ratak warshikawa vishesha siduweem sandaha sathkarakathwaya laba deemata nohaeka:** The text says the exhibition *does* provide a platform for showcasing special achievements.
* **C: vishesha siduweem masa hayak dakwa paewathiya yuthuya:** The text explicitly states the exhibition runs for about 3 months.
* **D: paewaethweemata niyamitha pradarshanaya sandaha siyalu ratawal sahabhagee viya yuthuya:** The text indicates that participation is voluntary and not a regular event.



"
sathwa prahaara aethiweeme sambhaavithawa adu kala haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: wurkayangen yara 25 ka durak pawathwa gaeneema** (Workmen's 25km distance from the source).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Udyaana adhikaariyata anuva, valasungen saha vurkayingen avama washayen yaara/meetara 100 k aethin saha anekuth wanajeeweengen meetar 25 kda aethin sitinna."" (After the gardener, fences and workmen are arranged, 100 meters from each other and numerous living beings 25 meters away.)
* **The question asks:** ""sathwa prahaara aethiweeme sambhaavithawa adu kala haekke pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?"" (What is the probable cause of the animal attack in the vicinity?)
* **The relationship:** The fact that workmen are 25 meters away from the source (the area where the animal attack occurred) makes it a probable cause.  Workmen's activities (digging, construction, etc.) could easily disturb animals and provoke an attack.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aeromaetik awshadha paelaeti raegena yama (Aeromatic medicine pilot's habit):** The text doesn't mention anything about pilots or medical habits.
* **B: kandawuru bhoomiyakin kunu akriya kireema (Lack of activity on the forest land):** The text describes activity (gardeners, fences, workmen) not a lack of it.
* **D: ithiri kaema sathunta deemen waelakeema (The animal's tendency to drink water from a small pool):** The text focuses on the distance of the workmen from the source, not the animal's water consumption.



"
wanajiweenge prahaarayanta hethu viya haeki bawa lipiye sandahan nowanne pahatha sandahan ewayin kawareda?,"The correct answer is **C: wanajiweenta aahara laba deema (Lack of livelihood)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the Udyaanaye as a place offering various resources like fruits, vegetables, and animals. It states that the land has the potential to attract people seeking a livelihood. The passage highlights the opportunity for people to cultivate crops and raise animals to support themselves. Therefore, the lack of a sustainable livelihood option is presented as a key reason for people to be drawn to Udyaanaye.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: thada gandhaya (Bad smell)** - While the passage mentions the need to manage waste and prevent bad smells, it isn't the primary reason for people to be attracted to Udyaanaye.
*   **B: durasthabhawaya pawathwa gaeneemata asamath weema (Unequal access to travel distance)** - The passage mentions the distance to amenities but does not highlight unequal access as the core reason for people being drawn there.
*   **D: minisunta nuhuru sathun (Minisunta is not a forest)** - This is a factual statement, but doesn't explain *why* people are attracted to Udyaanaye.

Therefore, the most logical answer based on the passage's content is the lack of livelihood options."
