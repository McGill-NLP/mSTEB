在工廠事故發生後，以下何者不是給當地居民的安全建議之一？,"The correct answer is **C: 避免吸入白色煙霧**.

Here's why:

The provided information states the following safety recommendations:

*   **待在室內 (Stay indoors)**
*   **關閉冷氣空調 (Turn off air conditioners)**
*   **勿飲用自來水 (Do not drink tap water)**

The text implies the white smoke is a concern due to radioactivity. While avoiding exposure to the smoke is a logical precaution, it's not explicitly listed as a direct instruction in the provided text. The other options are all directly mentioned as warnings. Therefore, avoiding inhaling the white smoke isn't included in the local government's specific safety advice mentioned in the passage.

"
根據摩爾醫師的說法，極具抗藥性的結核病最令人擔憂的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 它的高致死率 (Its high mortality rate)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""新的變異株「有極高的致死率，因此非常令人不安和恐慌」"" which translates to ""The new variant 'has a very high mortality rate, making it very alarming and frightening.'"" While the other options are concerns, the high mortality rate is highlighted as the primary reason for alarm and fear according to Dr. Moll.
"
在確定感染這種新變異株的患者中，有多少人證實是醫護人員？,"The answer is **B: 2 人**.

The text states: ""至少有兩個病例為醫護人員。"" which translates to ""at least two cases are healthcare workers."" Since the question asks how many *have been confirmed* to be healthcare workers, and the text says ""at least two,"" the best answer, among the choices, is 2.
"
NextGen 系統使用哪種技術？,"The correct answer is **A: 衛星技術**.

The passage explicitly states: ""它使用基於衛星的技術，而基於地面雷達的舊技術..."" (It uses satellite-based technology, while the old technology is ground-based radar...).
"
NextGen 如何直接幫助空中交通管制員？,"The correct answer is **B: 更精確的飛機位置**.

Here's why:

* The passage states NextGen uses satellite-based technology to ""讓空中交通管制員更精準地定位飛機"" (to allow air traffic controllers to more accurately locate aircraft).

Let's look at why the other options are less direct:

* **A: 更短的飛行路線 (Shorter flight routes):** Shorter flight routes are a *result* of more accurate positioning, not the direct help to controllers.
* **C: 減少碳排放 (Reduced carbon emissions):** Reduced carbon emissions are a *benefit* of the system, achieved through more efficient routes and fuel usage, but not a direct help to controllers.
* **D: 使用較少的燃料 (Using less fuel):**  Using less fuel is a *result* of more efficient routes and fuel usage, not a direct help to controllers.



"
根據文章，歷史學家沒有批評 FBI 集中在哪一點？,"The correct answer is **C: 高度關注色情案件**.

Here's why:

* The passage states historians *criticized* the FBI for focusing resources on easily solvable cases like car theft to boost success rates. 
* The passage also mentions Congress allocated funds for obscenity prevention and requested the FBI assign agents to adult pornography cases.  The question asks what historians *didn't* criticize the FBI for.
* The passage doesn't express any criticism regarding the FBI's focus on obscenity cases.  It simply states that Congress *funded* that area.

Therefore, historians didn't criticize the FBI for focusing on obscenity cases.
"
猥褻防治措施迫使 FBI 做什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 指派探員投入色情案件**.

The question states that the US Congress mandated the FBI to allocate resources to obscenity prevention and assign ten agents to adult pornography cases. Therefore, the direct consequence is that the FBI had to assign agents to investigate those cases. Option A is incorrect because the text states the FBI *previously* concentrated on car theft, not that the new mandate *forced* them to do so. Options B and C are also incorrect; the context is about a specific mandate regarding obscenity, not a general push for higher success rates or focusing on easy cases.
"
對 JAS 39C 獅鷲戰鬥機墜機事件作出反應的消防車發生了什麼事？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 它翻覆了 (It overturned)**.

The text states: ""當地媒體報導一輛機場消防車在出勤時翻覆。(Local media reported that an airport fire truck overturned while responding.)""
"
發生 JAS 39C 獅鷲戰鬥機墜機事件後，機場對什麼關閉了？,"The correct answer is **A: 商業航班**.

The text states: ""...導致機場暫停商業航班的起降。"" ( ...causing the airport to temporarily suspend commercial flights.)
"
布里辛斯基在伊朗革命期間指點了誰？,"The correct answer is **C: 卡特**.

The text states: ""作為美國國家安全局的一員，他在外交上協助卡特處理世界事務，例如 1978 年的大衛營協議；1970 年代後期為美中關係正常化出謀劃策；1979 年引發伊朗人質危機的伊朗革命；和 1979 年蘇聯入侵阿富汗.""  This directly links Brzezinski's role as National Security Advisor to assisting President Carter during the Iranian Revolution.
"
誰一直擔任國家安全顧問直到 1977 年？,"The correct answer is **B: 季辛吉**.

The text states that Brzezinski *replaced* Henry Kissinger as National Security Advisor in 1977. Therefore, Kissinger was the NSA until 1977.
"
以下何者並未正確反映波貝克在貝爾格萊德游擊隊的職業生涯？,"The correct answer is **A: 他在為球隊效力期間踢進超過 468 個進球 (He scored over 468 goals during his time with the team)**.

The text states that he scored **403** goals, not over 468. The other options are accurate based on the text:

*   **B: 他踢進的球比任何其他球員都要多 (He scored more goals than any other player)** - The text says he has the highest number of appearances and goals.
*   **C: 他曾獲選為球隊史上最佳球員 (He was elected as the club's all-time best player)** - The text explicitly states this.
*   **D: 他出賽次數比任何其他球員都要多 (He made more appearances than any other player)** - The text says he has the highest number of appearances.

Therefore, only option A is incorrect."
有關波貝克在貝爾格萊德游擊隊歷史，哪項陳述是正確的？,"The correct answer is **A: 他從 1945 年開始為貝爾格萊德游擊隊效力 (He started playing for Belgrade's Yugos in 1945)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""他在 1945 年加入該隊，並一直待到 1958 年。"" (He joined the team in 1945 and stayed until 1958.)
* **Option A directly reflects this information.**
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage doesn't mention him playing for a Zagreb team before Belgrade.
* **Option C is incorrect:** He played until 1958, not 1995.
* **Option D is incorrect:** He was already a star player *during* his time with the team before being named the best. The passage says he became famous *while* playing for them.



"
根據文章，哪個特徵讓伊氏西爪龍有別於迅猛龍？,"The correct answer is **B: 牠第二隻爪比較大 (Its second claw is larger)**.

The passage explicitly states that the ""西爪龍的封號，意指「西方之爪」 (the title ""West Claw Dragon"" refers to ""Western Claw"") because its second claw was larger than the others. While the other options are true about the creature, they don't specifically differentiate it from *all* Velociraptors.  Many raptors might have feathers (C) or be warm-blooded (D). The distinctive feature is the large second claw.
"
「西爪龍」的含義源自該物種的什麼身體特徵？,"The correct answer is **A: 爪子 (Claws)**.

The passage explicitly states that the name ""Westclaw Dragon"" (西爪龍) comes from its second claw being larger than the others. The name literally means ""Western Claw.""
"
關於槍擊事件的陳述，下列何者為真？,"The correct answer is **C: 這對夫婦一年前在水牛城結婚**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states:** ""那對夫妻在一年前於德州結婚，當時是到水牛城與親友慶祝。"" (The couple got married a year ago in Texas, and celebrated with friends and family in Buffalo City.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 丈夫和妻子都來自德克薩斯州** - We know the husband was born in Buffalo City, Texas, but we don't know if the wife was also born in Texas.
* **B: 有五個受害者** - The prompt states the husband was one of four victims, but doesn't say there were a total of five victims.
* **D: 槍擊事件發生在水牛城** - The prompt states they got married *in* Buffalo City, but doesn't specify *where* the shooting happened.

Therefore, only option C is directly and accurately supported by the text.
"
關於槍擊事件的陳述，下列何者是正確的？,"The correct answer is **A: 發生在水牛城的一個週年慶祝派對上**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""這對夫妻在一年前於德州結婚，當時是到水牛城與親友慶祝。 官員們表示，原訂於幾日之後舉辦正式的週年紀念活動。 **那名 30 歲、生於水牛城的丈夫，是在槍擊案中被殺的四名死者之一，但她的妻子並未受傷。**""

This clearly links the gun shooting to the anniversary party in Buffalo City. The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:** The official anniversary event is *planned* to happen later, not where the shooting occurred.
* **C:** While the wedding was in Texas, the shooting happened in Buffalo City during the anniversary party.
* **D:** The shooting happened *after* the wedding.



"
根據文章，主管人員對魯諾號最初的擔憂是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 燃油洩漏 (Fuel Leak)**.

The passage states: ""...主管人員原本害怕它會灑出許多"" which translates to ""...the supervisor was originally afraid it would spill a lot.""  The context of the ship carrying fertilizer makes it clear they were worried about a fuel leak contaminating the cargo.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 缺乏肥料貨物 (Lack of fertilizer cargo):** The ship was *carrying* fertilizer. The worry was about what *happened to the fertilizer*, not a lack of it.
* **B: 海浪和強風 (Waves and strong winds):** While the waves and winds caused the grounding, the supervisor's initial fear wasn't about the weather itself, but about the potential consequences for the cargo.
* **D: 船員可能會受傷 (Crew might get injured):** The passage mentions a minor injury, but the initial concern of the supervisor was about the cargo.



"
根據文章，關於魯諾號的故障，以下哪一個敘述不正確？,"Let's analyze the information provided in the passage:

* **Fuel:** The ship had 120 to 160 cubic meters of fuel when it ran aground.
* **Event:** The ship ran aground and was pushed onto a breakwater.
* **Crew:** Twelve crew members were rescued, and one was injured (a nasal fracture).
* **Cargo:** The ship was carrying fertilizer.

Now let's examine each option:

* **A: 故障發生在裝載貨物之前 (The breakdown happened before loading cargo):** The passage states the ship was *heading* to load fertilizer, implying the breakdown happened *before* the loading. This is likely correct.
* **B: 發生故障時，船上有 100 立方公尺的燃料 (There were 100 cubic meters of fuel when the breakdown happened):** The passage states there were 120 to 160 cubic meters of fuel. 100 is within that range, but we don't know for sure it was exactly 100.
* **C: 在十二名船員中，有一人受傷 (One of the twelve crew members was injured):** The passage clearly states one crew member had a nasal fracture. This is correct.
* **D: 船被推到防波堤上 (The ship was pushed onto a breakwater):**  The passage explicitly states the ship was ""pushed onto a breakwater."" This is correct.

The question asks for the *incorrect* statement. Option B is the most likely incorrect statement because we only know the fuel was *between* 120 and 160 cubic meters. It could have been 100, but we cannot confirm.

Therefore, the answer is **B: 發生故障時，船上有 100 立方公尺的燃料 (There were 100 cubic meters of fuel when the breakdown happened)**.



Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{B}$"
阿爾及利亞在哪個年代獲得獨立？,"The correct answer is **C: 1960 年代 (1960s)**.

The text states: ""他在 1960 年代返回剛獨立的阿爾及利亞，教授電影導演。"" (He returned to newly independent Algeria in the 1960s to teach film directing.)
"
哪些地方的葬禮儀式沒有設置電視螢幕？,"The correct answer is **D: 在聖伯多祿廣場 (In St. Peter's Square)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that because of the large number of attendees, not everyone could enter St. Peter's Square to watch the funeral. It also explicitly mentions that giant screens were set up *all over Rome* to allow people to view the ceremony. Therefore, the square itself did not have screens *because* it was too crowded.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 整個羅馬 (All of Rome):** The passage says screens were set up *all over* Rome, so this is incorrect.
* **B: 在義大利的各個城市 (In various cities in Italy):** The passage mentions other cities in Italy *also* had screens, so this is incorrect.
* **C: 波蘭的某些地方 (Some places in Poland):** The passage explicitly states that Poland also had screens, so this is incorrect.



"
葬禮在哪裡舉行？,"The correct answer is **C: 在聖伯多祿廣場 (In St. Peter's Square)**.

The text states: ""許多義大利城市和世界上其他地方也有類似的陳設，尤其是波蘭，並有為數眾多的人潮前來觀禮。"" and ""出席人數眾多，因此不是每個人都能進入聖伯多祿廣場參加葬禮。"" This indicates that the main ceremony was held in St. Peter's Square, and people watched it on screens elsewhere.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在整個羅馬的不同地點 (In different locations throughout Rome):** While screens were set up throughout Rome, the main event was in St. Peter's Square.
* **B: 在波蘭 (In Poland):** Poland had screens set up, but the funeral itself was in Rome.
* **D: 首先在羅馬，然後在另一個義大利城市 (First in Rome, then in another Italian city):** The text doesn't indicate a ceremony in another Italian city.
"
爆炸發生後，誰因重傷接受治療？,"The correct answer is **A: 至少五個人 (At least five people)**.

The passage states: ""無任何重大傷亡匯報，但爆炸發生時，現場至少有五人因產生休克症狀而接受治療 (There were no major injuries reported, but at the time of the explosion, at least five people received treatment for shock).""
"
是誰通報了瓦斯洩漏？,"The correct answer is **A: 大樓裡的一個鄰居 (A neighbor in the building)**.

The text states: ""在鄰居打電話通報瓦斯洩漏之後..."" which translates to ""After a neighbor called to report the gas leak...""
"
根據文章，有多少人在攻擊中喪生？,"The correct answer is **B: 2 人**.

The passage states that the victims are Nicholas Alden and Zachary Cuddeback. Therefore, 2 people died.
"
在攻擊期間，誰的武器在某個時刻失靈了？,"The correct answer is **B: 烏卡**.

The text states: ""烏卡瞄準第五個人的頭部時槍枝失靈。"" (Veguilla's gun malfunctioned when aiming at the head of the fifth person.)

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
以下哪項運動在奧運項目投票表決中落選？,"The correct answer is **D: 空手道**.

The text states that ""壁球、空手道和滑輪溜冰就像棒球與壘球，都試圖躋身奧運項目，但在 2005 年的投票表決中紛紛落選.""  This means all three (壁球, 空手道, and 滑輪溜冰) were unsuccessful in the vote.  Of the options provided, only 空手道 is listed.
"
國際奧委會投票決定將以下哪些運動納入比賽項目？,"The correct answer is **C: 英式橄欖球**.

The passage explicitly states that ""英式橄欖球，精確來說是七人制橄欖球，以及高爾夫球，勝過其他五項運動，被列為奧運項目。"" (Rugby union, specifically sevens rugby, and golf, were chosen over the other five sports to be included in the Olympic program.)

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: 滑輪溜冰** - The passage mentions roller skating (滑輪溜冰) was *not* selected.
* **B: 棒球** - The passage mentions baseball (棒球) was *not* selected.
* **D: 壘球** - The passage mentions softball (壘球) was *not* selected.
"
亞瑟·健力士最初租用聖詹姆士門釀酒廠多少年？,"The correct answer is **D: 9000 年 (9000 years)**.

The prompt states that Arthur Guinness signed a 9000-year lease on the St. James's Gate Brewery. The 250 years mentioned later is the time *after* the lease was signed, not the length of the lease itself.
"
健力士每年大約帶來幾十億美元的收入？,"The answer is **D: 100 億**.

The question states that Guinness's annual revenue is ""over 10 billion euros (approximately 14.7 billion dollars).""  Option D, 100 billion, is the closest and most reasonable answer among the choices provided, even though the actual figure is closer to 14.7 billion.  The question asks for an *approximate* amount.
"
歐盟有多少個國家曾經發現過 H5N1 病毒？,"The answer is **C: 七個**.

The text explicitly states: ""隨著奧地利、德國、斯洛維尼亞、保加利亞、希臘，和義大利之後，法國是歐盟中第七個遭受這種病毒危害的國家。"" (Following Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece, and Italy, France is the seventh EU country affected by this virus.)
"
最近的一例 H5N1 病毒感染案例是在哪裡發現的？,"The correct answer is **A: 法國 (France)**.

The text explicitly states: ""已證實感染了一隻於週一在法國東部里昂附近沼澤地中發現的死野鴨。"" (A dead wild duck infected with the virus was confirmed to be found in a swamp near Lyon in eastern France on Monday.)
"
在維和部隊引發傳播前，海地最後一次遇到該疾病是在何時？,"The correct answer is **A: 在 18 世紀**

The text states: ""在部隊進駐前，海地自十八世紀以來從未發生過與霍亂有關的問題。"" (Before the troops arrived, Haiti had not experienced cholera related problems since the 18th century.)
"
哪個地點的廢棄物導致了該疾病的傳播？,"The correct answer is **B: 聯合國營地 (United Nations camp)**.

The text explicitly states: ""根據該起訴訟，聯合國營地的廢棄物未經適當消毒，導致海地最大河流之一阿蒂博尼特河的支流滋生細菌。"" (According to the lawsuit, the waste from the United Nations camp was not properly disinfected, leading to bacteria breeding in a tributary of Haiti's largest river, the Artibonite.)

While the Artibonite River is *affected*, the *source* of the bacteria was the UN camp.
"
愛爾蘭政府計劃做什麼？,"The best answer is **B: 引入更嚴格的毒品容許度法律 (Introduce stricter drug tolerance laws)**.

Here's why:

* **The quote emphasizes the urgency of legislative action to address the current situation.** This suggests the government wants to *regulate* something, not just decriminalize it outright.
* **The concerns raised by the Health Minister regarding health and drug-related crime indicate a desire to control and manage drug use.** This points towards stricter regulations rather than complete legalization.
* **The phrase ""應盡快頒布法令 (should be enacted as soon as possible)"" reinforces the idea of a response to the current legal gray area.**

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: 提出毒品犯罪者的判決 (Propose sentences for drug offenders)** While this *might* be part of the legislation, the core issue seems to be addressing the broader issue of drug use and tolerance. The quote focuses on the *need for a law*.
* **C: 放寬毒品容許度法律 (Relax drug tolerance laws)** The government seems concerned about the consequences of *current* changes, so relaxing the laws is less probable.
* **D: 將毒品除罪化 (Decriminalize drugs)** Decriminalization means removing criminal penalties for drug possession, which isn't explicitly stated as the government's intention. The language focuses on needing a law to *correct* a situation, implying a more controlled approach than full decriminalization.



"
在愛爾蘭，什麼是暫時合法的？,"The correct answer is **D: 毒品 (Drugs)**.

The text states the government is emphasizing the urgency of legislative amendment due to the ""temporary legality of related substances."" The concerns raised by the Minister of Health regarding personal health and drug-related crime after the constitutional change further confirms this refers to drugs.
"
嫌疑犯正以什麼罪名接受調查？,"The correct answer is **A: 非法侵入 (Illegal entry)**.

The text explicitly states: ""洛杉磯警局發言人克里斯多夫．賈西亞表示，該名男性嫌疑犯正以非法侵入罪名接受調查，而非破壞公物。"" which translates to ""Los Angeles Police Department spokesperson Christopher Garcia said that the male suspect is being investigated for illegal entry, not vandalism.""
"
在修改標誌時，嫌疑犯沒有做什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 損壞它的實體 (Damaged its physical form)**.

Here's why:

* The prompt states the sign wasn't actually damaged. It was *modified*.
* The modification involved covering part of the sign with a waterproof cloth.
* The other options are true: The letter was changed, a peace symbol was used, and waterproof cloth was used for the modification.

Therefore, the only thing the suspect *didn't* do was damage the physical structure of the sign.
"
根據文章，英語教師范浩揚並未被指控以下哪項罪名？,"The correct answer is **B: 與學生交往 (Having a relationship with students)**.

Here's why:

* The article explicitly states范浩揚 *was previously accused of copyright infringement* but was not prosecuted. (A)
* The article states he *published unauthorized advertisements*. (C)
* The article states *parents considered some of his language offensive* and he *used slang and profanity in class*. (D)
* The article mentions he had a ""师生亦友"" (teacher-student also friend) relationship, implying interaction, but it doesn't state he was *charged with* having a relationship with students. While his behavior might raise concerns about inappropriate relationships, it wasn't a specific charge mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the only accusation *not* mentioned in the article is that he had a relationship with students.



"
根據文章，誰沒有被羅蘭多·蒙多薩扣為人質？,"The correct answer is **B: 警察 (Police)**.

Here's why:

* The article states that the hostage-taker, Rolando Mendoza,劫持 (kidnapped) a bus of **香港觀光客 (Hong Kong tourists)**.
* The hostages were ""他們 (them),"" referring to the tourists.
* While the hostage-taker was a police officer, the question asks *who was held hostage*. He was the perpetrator, not a victim.

Therefore, the police were not held hostage. The tourists, children, and the elderly were all victims of the hostage situation.
"
根據文章，哪些人質沒有確認提前獲釋？,"The correct answer is **A: 觀光客**.

Here's why:

The article states that ""They first released six hostages, including a photographer, a child, and an elderly woman, like the Filipino photographer."" This implies that *all* the released hostages fit that description.  Therefore, the remaining hostages, who were not part of that initial group, are the tourists (觀光客). The article doesn't say any specific group of hostages *didn't* get released.
"
根據文章，誰正在收集支持巴西同性婚姻合法化的連署簽名？,"The correct answer is **A: 示威者 (Protesters)**.

The article states: ""示威者希望能夠收集一百二十萬個連署簽名，在十一月提交給國會。"" (Protesters hope to collect one million two hundred thousand signatures and submit them to Congress in November.)
"
示威者將把他們的請願書提交給誰？,"The correct answer is **C: 巴西國會**.

The passage states that the protesters plan to submit their petition to the National Congress (""國會"").
"
根據阿曼·維薩切的說法，在人群開始對天氣作出反應之前發生了什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 有大風 (There was strong wind)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the event started with a strong wind *before* the rain and hail. 
* The question asks what happened *before* the crowd reacted to the weather. The crowd's reaction is indicated by ""人們驚惶尖叫，奔跑互踩"" (people screamed in panic, ran and trampled on each other). 
* Therefore, the wind happened first, then the rain and hail, and finally the panicked reaction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 開始下冰雹 (It started hailing):** The passage says hail came *after* the wind and rain.
* **B: 表演延遲五分鐘 (The performance was delayed five minutes):** The passage states the wind started *immediately* at the beginning of the performance.
* **D: 他失去與一名家庭成員的聯繫 (He lost contact with a family member):**  While Armando lost his sister, the question asks what happened *before* the crowd's reaction to the weather, not specifically about his personal loss.



"
根據維薩切的說法，最強的風是什麼時候開始的？,"The correct answer is **A: 表演開始後數分鐘 (Several minutes after the performance started)**.

The text states: ""表演剛開演五分鐘就突然捲起一陣狂風..."" (A strong wind suddenly rose just five minutes after the performance started...). This directly answers the question about when the strongest wind began.
"
在弗雷德之前，在 35°W 以東記錄了多少個重大颶風？,"The answer is **C: 二個**.

The question states: ""...卻還只 是 35°W 以東記錄上第三大颶風."" This directly indicates that there were two hurricanes recorded east of 35°W that were stronger than Fred.
"
當弗雷德位於維德角島附近時，它往哪個方向移動？,"The passage states: ""弗雷德目前風速為每小時 105 英里（165 公里／小時）並往**西北方**前進。""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 北方** (since Northwest is a combination of North and West, and we need to choose the closest direction among the options).
"
以下何者的速度比其前代更快？,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The question explicitly states that ""802.11n 的速度比過去的設備都要快非常多"". This directly answers the question of which standard is faster than its predecessors. The other options (802.11b, 802.11g, and 802.11a) are all older standards and were slower than 802.11n.
"
802.11n 與 802.11b 兼容需要什麼條件？,"The correct answer is **D: 雙射頻 (Dual-band)**.

Here's why:

* **Compatibility is key:**  The question asks about *compatibility*.  802.11n's ability to be backward compatible with older standards (like 802.11b) is achieved through the use of two frequency bands (2.4 GHz and 5 GHz).
* **Dual-band is the enabling factor:**  A dual-band access point (base station) can operate on both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz.  This allows it to serve both 802.11n devices (which can use either band) *and* older 802.11b devices (which only operate on 2.4 GHz).
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: 明顯更快的速度 (Significantly faster speed):** While 802.11n *is* significantly faster, the speed difference itself isn't what makes it compatible with 802.11b.
    * **B: 讓 802.11b 能在 5.0Ghz 上運作的能力 (The ability to let 802.11b operate on 5.0 GHz):** 802.11b *cannot* operate on the 5 GHz band. It's limited to 2.4 GHz.
    * **C: 600Mbit/s 的傳輸量 (600 Mbit/s transmission rate):** The 600 Mbit/s rate is a feature of 802.11n but not a requirement for backward compatibility. 802.11b is much slower.



Therefore, a dual-band access point is what enables 802.11n to be backward compatible with 802.11b.



"
這位奧運金牌選手原本要在大英國協運動會參加幾場游泳比賽？,"The correct answer is **B: 三場**.

The text states he was scheduled to compete in:

* 100m freestyle
* 200m freestyle
* 3x100m freestyle relay (which is a 4-swimmer relay, but a single *race* within the relay)

That's a total of three races.
"
為什麼奧運金牌選手沒有服用藥物來止痛？,"The correct answer is **D: 大英國協運動會不允許使用此藥物 (The Commonwealth Games do not allow the use of this medication)**.

The passage explicitly states that the athlete can't take medication to suppress pain *because the Olympics ban those drugs*.  The question refers to the Commonwealth Games, not the Olympics.  Therefore, the reason he can't take the medication is because it's prohibited at the event he's participating in.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他不痛 (He's not in pain):** The passage implies he *is* in pain, as his symptoms are concerning and his physical condition is in question.
* **B: 藥物讓他感到不舒服 (The medication makes him uncomfortable):**  The passage doesn't mention anything about the medication causing discomfort.
* **C: 他擔心會對自己的健康狀況產生負面影響 (He's worried about negative effects on his health):** While possible, the passage specifically states the ban on the medication is the reason he can't take it.



"
根據文章，什麼可能會導致有關地震活動的混淆？,"The correct answer is **A: 烏雲的存在 (The presence of clouds)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""眼前所見的雲可能造成混淆，不確定是否真的發生火山爆發"" which translates to ""The clouds currently seen could cause confusion, making it uncertain whether a volcanic eruption is actually happening.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: 冰島氣象局的報告 (The report of the Icelandic Meteorological Office)** is providing information, not causing confusion.
* **C: 國際地震地圖 (The International Seismological Summary)** is also providing information, not causing confusion.
* **D: 其他冰島地區的活動報告 (Reports of activity in other parts of Iceland)** are not mentioned as a source of confusion.



"
根據文章，什麼時候發生了狀態改變？,"The correct answer is **C: 三月十日 (March 10th)**.

The passage states: ""引發狀態改變的明顯地震活動發生於 3 月 10 日..."" which translates to ""The significant seismic activity that triggered the change in state occurred on March 10th...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 三月十日之前 (Before March 10th):** The passage explicitly states the change happened *on* March 10th.
* **B: 過去 48 小時內 (Within the last 48 hours):** The passage says the activity *before* the change was in the last 48 hours, but the change itself happened on March 10th.
* **D: 前一周 (Last week):** While the map indicates no earthquakes in the last week, the *change in state* is specifically tied to March 10th.
"
有關月船 1 號的月球探測器，以下哪個陳述不正確？,"The correct answer is **A: 發射探測器的軌道飛行器配有機組人員 (The launch probe's orbital vehicle is equipped with a crew.)**

Here's why:

* **The question focuses on the *Moon Probe 1* mission.** This was an *unmanned* mission.  Therefore, it would not have a crew.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the provided text:

* **B: 探測器包含重要儀器 (The probe contains important instruments.)** The text explicitly states the probe carried three important scientific instruments.
* **C: 探測器彈出成功 (The probe's separation was successful.)** The text says the MIP (lunar impact probe) was successfully deployed.
* **D: 探測器各面有彩繪 (The probe has painted designs on its surfaces.)** The text specifically mentions the probe had the Indian flag image painted on the instruments.



"
關於月球探測器，以下哪個描述正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 它迫降成功 (It successfully crash-landed)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""...成功在月球南極點附近強行著陸 (successfully crash-landed near the Moon's South Pole).""  ""強行著陸"" translates to ""crash-landed"".
* **A is incorrect:** The prompt specifically says it landed near the South Pole, not the North Pole.
* **C is incorrect:** The prompt explicitly states the MIP was *launched* from the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter.  It wasn't launched from a crewed vehicle.
* **D is incorrect:** The prompt states it carried *three* important scientific instruments, not two.

Therefore, option B is the only accurate statement based on the provided text.
"
根據文章，哪項防範疾病的措施最後才會實施？,"The correct answer is **C: 腦炎疫苗**.

The passage states: ""政府也承諾生產數百萬支腦炎疫苗，此舉將幫助衛生單位做好準備因應明年的疫情。"" (The government also promised to produce millions of encephalitis vaccines, which will help health officials prepare for next year's outbreak.)  This implies the vaccine rollout is planned for the future, while the other measures (pig culling, mosquito nets, and insecticide spraying) were implemented *during* the current outbreak.
"
這種疾病是如何傳染給人類的？,"The correct answer is **A: 蚊子 (Mosquitoes)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""這種疾病存在於豬身上，然後透過蚊子傳播給人類。"" which translates to ""This disease exists in pigs and then spreads to humans through mosquitoes.""
"
第二條文宣判失敗可能會導致什麼結果？,"The correct answer is **B: 未來有權進行同性民事結合 (Future possibility of same-sex civil marriage)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""禁止同性民事結合的提議經第二次宣判失敗，有可能開啟未來同性民事結合之門 (The proposal to ban same-sex civil marriage has been defeated for the second time, potentially opening the door to future same-sex civil marriage.)""

Option B directly reflects this statement. The other options are incorrect based on the text.  Option A is incorrect because the resolution will be reviewed by the *next* elected legislature, not immediately. Options C and D contradict the passage's implication that the defeat of the ban creates a future possibility of allowing same-sex marriage.



"
根據文章，第二條文是什麼時候被刪除的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在立法會議期間 (During the legislative session)**.

The passage states: ""本立法會期對該修正案進行修正，先經眾議院刪除第二條文..."" which translates to ""During this legislative session, the amendment was modified, first with the House of Representatives deleting the second clause...""  Therefore, the deletion occurred during the legislative session.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 2011 年 (2011)** - While the proposal was passed in 2011, the deletion of the clause happened during the current legislative session.
* **C: 在星期一 (On Monday)** - The Senate passed a similar version on Monday, but the deletion happened earlier in the legislative session.
* **D: 2015 年 (2015)** - The joint resolution is to be reconsidered in 2015 or 2016, not when the second clause was deleted.



"
「巴拿馬文件」洩露給誰？,"The correct answer is **B: 新聞媒體 (News Media)**.

The passage states: ""巴拿馬文件」統稱 2016 年春天，巴拿馬法律事務所莫薩克‧馮賽卡外洩給媒體的文件..."" which translates to """"Panama Papers"" refers to the documents leaked in the spring of 2016 from the Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca to the **media**..."".

While the documents revealed information about banks (like Deutsche Bank) and individuals, the *leak* itself was to the news media.
"
根據文章，英國媒體聲稱誰在管理許多用於藏匿財富的公司？,"The correct answer is **C: 德意志銀行**.

The passage states: ""英國報紙《衛報》暗指，用於實現此目的的 1,200 間空殼公司裡，德意志銀行控制了大約三分之一。"" (The British newspaper The Guardian hinted that Deutsche Bank controlled about one-third of the 1,200 shell companies used for this purpose.)
"
以下哪一次航空事故造成的死亡人數最多？,"The correct answer is **A: 從伊朗飛往亞美尼亞的班機失事 (The flight from Iran to Armenia crashed)**.

The question states that the flight to Armenia resulted in **168** deaths, which is the highest number among the listed accidents. The other accidents resulted in 3 deaths (police helicopter) and 17 deaths (plane crash in Mashhad).
"
以下哪一項不是伊朗發生多起航空事故的原因之一？,"The answer is **D: 飛機機隊維護不良 (Aircraft fleet poor maintenance)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions:

* **老舊的民用和軍用飛機機隊 (Outdated civil and military aircraft fleet):** This is directly stated as a problem.
* **國際制裁表示無法購入新飛機 (International sanctions prevent the purchase of new aircraft):** This is a major contributing factor.
* **無法購買新飛機 (Inability to purchase new aircraft):** This is a consequence of the sanctions.

While poor maintenance *could* contribute to accidents, the passage **doesn't** state that it is a direct cause of the recent accidents.  The focus is on the age of the fleet and the inability to replace it due to sanctions.  Therefore, ""poor maintenance"" isn't specifically mentioned as a reason.



"
以下哪一項不包括在伊拉克研究小組的報告中？,"The correct answer is **B: 聲明透過某些改變就能避免伊拉克的暴力局勢加劇 (Stating that certain changes can prevent the escalation of the violent situation in Iraq)**.

Here's why:

The prompt states the report *warns* that ""no one can guarantee that any action taken at this time in Iraq will prevent sectarian war, continued violence, or descent into chaos."" This directly contradicts option B, which claims the report *states* certain changes *will* prevent escalation. The report is pessimistic about the possibility of easily resolving the situation.

The other options *are* included in the report as described in the prompt:

*   **A: 批評現行政策 (Criticizing the current policy):** The prompt explicitly states the report ""strongly criticizes almost all aspects of the administration's current policy.""
*   **C: 保護伊拉克邊境的建議 (Recommendation to protect Iraq's borders):** The first recommendation is to ""adopt new diplomatic measures by the end of this year to protect Iraq's borders from foreign aggression.""
*   **D: 呼籲美國達成共識 (Calling for the US to reach consensus):** The report ""begins by urging the United States to have a public debate and reach a consensus on its Middle East policy.""



"
伊拉克研究小組的報告中未敦促以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **A: 宣布保證阻止持續成長的暴力事件 (Announce a guarantee to stop the ongoing growth of violence)**.

Here's why:

* **The report explicitly states that no one can guarantee stopping the violence.** This is a core message of the report, emphasizing the complexity of the situation.
* The report *does* urge for:
    * **Public debate and consensus on US Middle East policy (C)**
    * **Immediate changes in current policy (B)**
    * **New diplomatic measures to protect Iraq's borders and rebuild relations with neighbors (D)**

Therefore, the report *does not* advocate for a guarantee that violence can be stopped.



"
根據警方，誰被認為是普羅文察諾的左右手？,"The correct answer is **B: 洛·皮科洛**.

The passage states: ""警方說，洛·皮科洛之所以佔了上風是因為他在巴勒莫曾擔任普羅文察諾的左右手..."" which translates to ""Police say that Lo Piccolo gained the upper hand because he had previously served as Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...""
"
根據文章提供的資訊，喬凡尼·法爾康的死因是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 他在里納發動的戰爭中被殺害**.

The text states: ""該場衝突奪走了黑手黨改革鬥士喬凡尼‧法爾康 (Giovanni Falcone) 和保羅‧波賽里尼 (Paolo Borsellino) 的性命。""  This directly indicates that Giovanni Falcone died in the conflict initiated by the 'larına' (the Mafia war).
"
以下何者不是齊藤仁的榮譽之一？,"The correct answer is **A: 兩次世界冠軍 (Two-time world champion)**.

The text states he was a two-time Olympic gold medalist, president of the training committee, and a judo expert. It *doesn't* mention him being a two-time world champion. Therefore, that's the option that isn't listed as one of his honors according to the text.
"
岩崎想辦法避開在哪裡立下誓約？,"The correct answer is **B: 尼泊爾**.

The passage states he ""逃離了一場婚姻在尼泊爾"" (escaped a marriage in Nepal). This implies he made a vow there that he then needed to escape from.
"
誰攻擊了岩崎？,"The correct answer is **C: 一隻狗 (A dog)**.

The passage states he was attacked by a dog in Tibet. Option A is incorrect because he escaped a marriage, not that his fiancée attacked him. Options B and D are incorrect because the passage mentions pirates and the police arresting him, but not attacking him.
"
阿隆索在何時結束了他的比賽？,"The correct answer is **C: 在舒馬克結束自己的比賽後**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""麥可・舒馬克在阿隆索出局後不久，也因為在比賽中多次與對手競速，造成懸吊系統損壞而結束了比賽。"" (Michael Schumacher also ended his race shortly after Alonso's elimination, due to suspension damage caused by racing opponents.)

This clearly indicates Alonso's race ended *before* Schumacher's. Therefore, Alonso finished his race *after* Schumacher's.
"
是什麼原因導致舒馬克提前結束比賽？,"The correct answer is **D: 汽車懸吊系統損壞 (Car suspension system damage)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""麥可・舒馬克在阿隆索出局後不久，也因為在比賽中多次與對手競速，造成懸吊系統損壞而結束了比賽。"" which translates to ""Michael Schumacher also finished the race shortly after Alonso's retirement, due to damage to his suspension system caused by repeated racing with opponents during the race.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 他無法控制車輛 (He couldn't control the vehicle)** - This describes Fischera's issue, not Schumacher's.
*   **B: 與阿隆索發生碰撞 (A collision with Alonso)** - The passage doesn't mention a collision.
*   **C: 費希切拉造成的車輪損壞 (Wheel damage caused by Fisichella)** - While Fisichella had a problem, it didn't cause Schumacher's retirement. Schumacher's issue was with his suspension.



"
根據文章，誰負責為被捕人士決定保釋金？,"The correct answer is **B: 葛林法官**.

The passage states: ""If approved, the assistant judge will decide the bail amount, and formally accept charges filed by the officers who executed the arrest."" This clearly indicates that the assistant judge (who is acting under Judge Green's order) will determine the bail amount.
"
根據文中提到的臨時禁制令，被捕人士必須達到什麼條件才能被拘留超過 24 小時？,"The correct answer is **A: 保釋金**

Here's why:

The text states the judge's order applies to those detained *after* 24 hours *without* receiving a court notification of preliminary hearing. The order also mentions that if approved, the court assistant judge will decide on a **bail amount**. This implies that having bail is a condition to *not* be subject to the order and potentially remain detained beyond 24 hours.  The order is designed to prevent indefinite detention without a hearing and the possibility of bail.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 與逮捕警員會面 (Meeting with arresting officers):**  The text doesn't mention meeting with arresting officers as a requirement.
* **C: 由葛林法官發布的正式指控 (Formal charges issued by Judge Green):**  The order is *preventing* detention without preliminary hearing, even if charges are filed. The focus is on the *lack* of hearing, not the presence of charges.
* **D: 聽證會 (Hearing):** The order aims to ensure timely hearings are scheduled, but it doesn't specify a condition related to the hearing *itself* for determining detention. The lack of a hearing *after* 24 hours is the problem the order addresses.



"
根據這段文字，沒有使用以下哪個原因來解釋取消決選？,"The correct answer is **B: 與憲法牴觸 (Contradicts the constitution)**.

The passage explicitly states that the official reason for canceling the runoff was to save money and avoid security risks. It also mentions that diplomats found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to avoid the need for a runoff.  Crucially, the passage *contradicts* earlier reports that claimed canceling the runoff would violate the constitution. Therefore, the constitutional conflict is *not* presented as a reason *for* the cancellation in this text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reasons provided:

* **A: 安全風險 (Security risks):** The text directly states the cancellation was to ""avoid再次選舉產生的安全風險"" (avoid security risks generated by a second election).
* **C: 高昂的開支 (High costs):** The text states the decision was to ""節省經費"" (save money).
* **D: 憲法的不明確性 (Ambiguity in the constitution):** The text says diplomats found ""足夠的歧義"" (enough ambiguity) in the constitution.



"
為什麼外交官最終認為決選投票是沒有必要的？,"The correct answer is **C: 憲法存在不明確的地方 (The constitution has ambiguities)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""外交人員說他們已在阿富汗憲法中找到足夠的歧義，因此決定沒有必要進行決選投票。"" (Diplomats said they had found enough ambiguities in the Afghan constitution, therefore deciding that a runoff election was not necessary.)
* Option A is incorrect because the text *contradicts* the idea that it violates the constitution.
* Option B is a reason *given* for the cancellation, but not the *reason why the diplomats concluded a runoff was unnecessary*.
* Option D (election costs) is also a reason *given* for the cancellation, but not the *reason why the diplomats concluded a runoff was unnecessary*.

Therefore, the diplomats' reasoning was based on finding ambiguity in the constitution, making a runoff election unnecessary according to their interpretation.
"
誰為聯邦直轄部落地區提供司法服務？,"The correct answer is **B: 政治代理人**.

The passage states that the ""政治代理人"" (political agents) are responsible for governing and providing judicial services in these districts. Therefore, they are the ones providing the judicial services.
"
關於聯邦直轄部落地區「政治代理人」的敘述，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 他們是由巴基斯坦總統選出 (They are elected by the President of Pakistan)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""自 1947 年脫離英國統治獨立後，巴基斯坦總統會任命「政治代理人」來管理聯邦直轄部落地區..."" This clearly indicates the President *appoints* the political agents, not elects them.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: 他們負責提供司法服務 (They are responsible for providing judicial services):** The text explicitly states this.
* **C: 他們遵守巴基斯坦憲法 (They abide by the Constitution of Pakistan):**  The text mentions they are responsible for governance and providing judicial services *according to* the constitution.
* **D: 他們對特定地區擁有完全控制權 (They have complete control over specific areas):** The text says these areas have ""幾乎有完全的自治權"" (almost complete autonomy), not that the political agents have complete control.
"
請問艾瑪·史東被提名哪個獎項？,"The correct answer is **C: 最佳女演員**.

The question states that Emma Stone was nominated for Best Actress.
"
該電影沒有被提名哪個獎項？,"The correct answer is **B: 最佳視覺效果**.

The text explicitly lists all the awards the film *was* nominated for, and ""最佳視覺效果"" (Best Visual Effects) is not among them.
"
地震後，哪些設施繼續運作？,"The correct answer is **D: 新潟的一座發電廠**

Here's why:

* The question asks which facilities *continued* operating.
* The passage states: ""NHK 也報導，位於新潟縣的柏崎刈羽核能發電廠當時運作正常。"" This means the Kashiwazaki-Kariwa Nuclear Power Plant in Niigata Prefecture was operating normally.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 北陸電力公司志賀核電廠所有的反應爐:** The passage says the Shiga nuclear power plant's units 1 and 2 were shut down.
* **B: 石川縣的機場:** The passage explicitly states that the Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture remained closed.
* **C: 所有的鐵路服務:** The passage says railway service in the affected areas was disrupted.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者因地震受損？,"The correct answer is **C: 部分道路 (Part of the roads)** and **D: 能登機場 (Noto Airport)**.

Here's why:

* **C: 部分道路 (Part of the roads)** - The text explicitly states ""部分道路已受損"" (Part of the roads were damaged).
* **D: 能登機場 (Noto Airport)** - The text states ""石川縣的能登機場依舊關閉"" (Noto Airport in Ishikawa Prefecture remains closed). While the reason for closure isn't explicitly stated as earthquake damage, the context of the article suggests it's related to the earthquake's impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 部分民宅 (Part of the houses)** - The text states ""約有 9400 戶民宅斷水，100 戶民宅斷電"" (Approximately 9400 households lost water, and 100 households lost power).  This indicates damage or disruption, not necessarily structural damage to the houses themselves.
* **B: 兩座北陸電力公司志賀核電廠反應爐 (Two reactors at Hokuriku Electric Power's Shiga Nuclear Power Plant)** - The text says ""志賀核能發電廠的一號和二號反應爐也關閉了"" (Units 1 and 2 of the Shiga Nuclear Power Plant were also shut down). It doesn't state they were *damaged*. They were shut down as a safety precaution.



"
根據這段文字，文件中沒有包含以下哪個問題？,"The correct answer is **B: 1967 年戰爭的原因 (The cause of the 1967 War)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the document mentions:
    * Border disputes based on 1967 borders.
    * The future of Jerusalem.
    * The Jordan Valley issue.
    * Disagreement on the duration of Israeli troop presence in the Jordan Valley.

* The passage **does not** mention the *cause* of the 1967 War. It only references the 1967 borders as a basis for the border dispute.

Therefore, B is the only option not mentioned in the provided text."
下列何者並非巴勒斯坦的要求？,"The correct answer is **B: 繼續在約旦河谷駐軍**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""以色列要求，若簽署協議，將繼續在約旦河谷駐軍十年，而巴勒斯坦自治政府則同意駐軍只保留五年。"" (Israel requested to continue its military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years, while the Palestinian Authority agreed to a five-year presence.)

* **Option B states:** ""繼續在約旦河谷駐軍"" (Continue military presence in the Jordan Valley). This is Israel's demand, not a Palestinian request.

* **Options A, C, and D are all mentioned as Palestinian positions:**
    * **A: 以戰前邊界為基礎 (Based on pre-1967 borders):** The document reportedly mentions this as a Palestinian desire.
    * **C: 有關耶路撒冷的未來的答案 (A solution for the future of Jerusalem):**  The document states Jerusalem's future is a topic of discussion.
    * **D: 在約旦河谷持續五年的駐軍 (A five-year military presence in the Jordan Valley):** This is what the Palestinian Authority agreed to, indicating it's a Palestinian position.



Therefore, the only option that *isn't* a Palestinian request is B."
馬英九在哪個國家學法律？,"The correct answer is **A: 美國 (United States)**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""曾就讀於紐約大學和哈佛法學院，並曾持有美國永久居民的「綠卡」"" which translates to ""Studied at New York University and Harvard Law School, and once held a US permanent resident ""green card""."" Therefore, he studied law in the United States.
"
根據這段文字，馬英九因擁護哪個國家所助得以勝選？,"The correct answer is **D: 中國**.

The text states that Ma Ying-jeou won easily despite accusations from Hsieh Chang-ting, ""through advocating closer ties with mainland China."" Therefore, his policy of strengthening ties with China was the reason for his victory.
"
在文章中提到，Carolyn Wilson 離開小鎮前為誰工作？,"The correct answer is **C: 奧克蘭房屋委員會 (Oakland Housing Authority)**.

The text states: ""奧克蘭房屋委員會的 Carolyn Wilson 偷走他們的保證金並已捲款潛逃。"" (Oakland Housing Authority's Carolyn Wilson stole their security deposits and fled with the money.)

Therefore, Carolyn Wilson worked for the Oakland Housing Authority. While the Oakland Housing Authority is mentioned later as being investigated for other potential housing scams, the initial statement directly links Carolyn Wilson to the Oakland Housing Authority.
"
在賽季仍剩四場賽事的情況下，誰在車手錦標賽排名第四？,"The answer is **B: 卡恩**.

Here's how we know:

The passage states: ""在賽季仍剩四場賽事的情況下，史都華、戈登、肯瑟斯和哈維克分佔了車手冠軍排行榜的前十名。卡恩和小楚克斯分別以 2220 分和 2207 分位居第五和第六名。""

This tells us Stewart, Gordon, Kansas, and Harvick are in the top 10.  Carn is in fifth place and楚克斯 is in sixth place.  Since the options list Carn as a possibility, and Stewart is explicitly mentioned, Carn is the correct answer.
"
文中提到比賽結束後，卡恩在車手錦標賽中獲得多少分？,"The correct answer is **A: 2220 分**.

The passage states: ""卡恩和小楚克斯分別以 2220 分和 2207 分位居第五和第六名。"" which translates to ""Earnhardt Jr. and楚克斯分别以 2220 分和 2207 分位居第五和第六名。"" (Earnhardt Jr. and楚克斯 respectively have 2220 and 2207 points, placing them fifth and sixth.)

Therefore, Earnhardt Jr. (卡恩) has 2220 points."
根據這段文字，人類看到掉落的隕石，後來證實是來自火星的情況有幾次？,"The correct answer is **B: 5 次**.

The passage states: ""據信這是史上第五次人類發現並經由化學方式證明有火星物質掉落到地球上。"" This translates to ""This is believed to be the fifth time in history that humans have discovered and chemically proven that Martian material has fallen to Earth.""

The question asks how many times humans *seen* a falling meteorite and *later confirmed* it was from Mars. The passage directly states this is the *fifth* such instance. While there are 34 confirmed Martian meteorites in total, the question is about the instances where humans *observed* a falling one and then confirmed its origin.
"
如文中所提，關於已發現是來自火星的岩石，何者為真？,"The correct answer is **D: 共有 34 個**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""地球上將近兩萬四千顆已知的隕石中，只有 34 顆確定來自火星."" (Among the nearly 24,000 known meteorites on Earth, only 34 are confirmed to be from Mars.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 全都是在七月的流星雨期間發現的 (All were discovered during the meteor shower in July):** The passage specifically says 15 were from the July meteor shower, not all 34.
* **B: 共有 24000 個 (There are 24,000):** The passage states that there are *nearly* 24,000 known meteorites, but the question asks about Martian meteorites, and the passage states only 34 are confirmed to be from Mars.
* **C: 其價值比黃金還要高出 $11000 美元 (Their value is $11,000 higher than gold):** The passage states some Martian rocks sell for 10 times the price of gold, not $11,000 higher.



"
舒馬克是何時退休的？,"The correct answer is **B: 在他第七次贏得冠軍之後 (After his seventh championship win)**.

The text explicitly states: ""曾七度贏得一級方程式冠軍，已於 2006 年退休的舒馬克...""  This directly tells us he retired *after* winning his seventh championship.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 費利佩·馬薩發生事故後 (After Felipe Massa's accident):** The text says Schumacher was *scheduled* to replace Massa, but doesn't say he retired *because* of the accident.
* **C: 取代費利佩·馬薩之後 (After replacing Felipe Massa):** The text indicates he was *going* to replace Massa, implying retirement happened *before* the replacement.
* **D: 在 2009 年賽季結束時 (At the end of the 2009 season):** The text states he retired in 2006.



"
馬薩是何時受傷的？,"The correct answer is **A: 參加大獎賽途中 (During a Grand Prix)**.

The text explicitly states that Felipe Massa was injured in the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
"
根據這段文字，這個安排會如何影響 AOL？,"The correct answer is **C: 雅虎和微軟客戶加總將可匹敵 AOL 的客戶數量**.

The text explicitly states: ""雅虎和微軟服務的使用者人數加總，將可匹敵 AOL 的客戶數量."" (The combined number of users of Yahoo and Microsoft services will equal the number of AOL customers.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL 的客戶數量可能會增加** - The text suggests the opposite, a potential decrease due to competition.
* **B: AOL 將是唯一開發即時通訊市場的公司** - This is clearly false. The text mentions Yahoo and Microsoft as competitors.
* **D: AOL 將不再在美國使用** - The text doesn't imply that AOL will stop being used in the US. It discusses a shift in the market landscape.



"
以下何者可能會於新安排後結束？,"The correct answer is **C: AOL 自主發展市場的自由 (AOL's freedom to develop the market independently)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""直至現在，由於美國境內的廣泛使用，AOL 已能夠以自己的步調轉移與發展即時通訊市場。 在這樣的安排下，這種自由可能會告終。"" (Until now, due to widespread use within the US, AOL has been able to transition and develop the instant messaging market at its own pace. Under this arrangement, this freedom may come to an end.)

* **The passage implies:** The rise of Yahoo and Microsoft, whose combined user base will rival AOL's, will likely curtail AOL's independent control over the instant messaging market. They will no longer be able to develop the market as freely as they have been.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 美國普遍的網路發展 (Widespread internet development in the US):** The passage doesn't suggest that the internet's overall development in the US will end.
* **B: 即時通訊市場的使用 (Use of the instant messaging market):** The passage doesn't imply that people will stop using instant messaging; it's the *development* of the market that's potentially being affected.
* **D: 雅虎和微軟的合作夥伴關係 (Yahoo and Microsoft's partnership):** The passage focuses on the *impact* of Yahoo and Microsoft's growth on AOL, not their partnership.
"
在攻擊中喪生的人有多少個不是警察？,"The correct answer is **B: 2 人**.

Here's why:

* The question asks for the number of people *not* police officers who died.
* The text states that two police officers died.
* The text states that 19 of the injured are police officers.
* The question specifies that the *dead* police officers are not relevant to the question.
* Since the question is asking about *deaths* and the other 20+ people injured are not dead, the number of people who died and were not police is 2 (the two officers).

Therefore, the answer is 2.
"
是誰舉報攻擊事件的嫌疑犯？,"The correct answer is **A: 警方 (Police)**.

The text states: ""警方說，他們懷疑這起攻擊是由達伊沙（伊拉克和黎凡特伊斯蘭國）的好戰嫌疑犯所為。"" which translates to ""Police said they suspect the attack was carried out by a militant suspect of ISIS (Islamic State of Iraq and Syria).""

This indicates the police are the ones investigating and therefore likely identifying the suspect. The question asks *who* suspects the attacker, and the police are the ones making the suspicion. The other options are not mentioned as reporting the suspect or making the suspicion.
"
由於佛羅里達州是一個贏者全拿的州，米特·羅姆尼贏得了什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 共和黨提名 (Republican nomination)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Florida is a ""winner-take-all"" state. This means the candidate with the most votes receives *all* of that state's electoral votes.
* The passage also says that the 50 Florida representatives *all* went to Romney.
* Because Romney won the Florida primary and received all 50 electoral votes, he is now the leading candidate for the Republican nomination.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 32 名州代表 (32 state representatives):** Newt Gingrich received 32% of the vote, not Romney.
* **C: 該州的所有代表 (All of the state representatives):** While Romney received all of Florida's representatives, the question is what he *won*, and winning the nomination is the primary outcome.
* **D: 46% 的選票 (46% of the vote):** This is the percentage of votes Romney received, not what he won.



"
根據這段文字，金瑞契在初選中獲得了多少百分比的選票？,"The correct answer is **B: 0,32**.

The text states: ""前美國眾議院​議長紐特‧金瑞契以 32% 的選票位居第二。""  This translates to ""Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich finished second with 32% of the vote.""
"
根據這段文字，在公布預選會議結果之後，誰沒有繼續競選？,"The correct answer is **B: 巴克曼**.

The text explicitly states: ""巴赫曼在八月份的埃姆斯民意調查中獲勝，並決定終止競選。"" (Bachmann won the Ames straw poll in August and decided to end her campaign.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 金瑞契:** The text says he congratulated Santorum.
* **C: 裴利:** He stated he would initially re-evaluate but later announced he would continue campaigning.
* **D: 羅姆尼:** The text doesn't say he dropped out, only mentions that金瑞契 criticized him.



"
根據這段文字，在公布預選會議結果之後，誰對另一位候選人給予了高度評價？,"The correct answer is **B: 金瑞契**.

The text states: ""結果出爐後，金瑞契恭賀桑托榮，卻對羅姆尼說了重話，因為他在在愛荷華州播放了針對金瑞契的負面競選廣告."" This indicates that while he congratulated Santorum, he was critical of Romney.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
在 2015 年之前，唯一播出該節目的地方在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet 網路電台**.

The text explicitly states: ""早期，這個節目只有在一個經營許久的網路電台 TogiNet 上播出..."" which translates to ""Early on, the program was only broadcast on a long-running internet radio station TogiNet...""
"
該電台描述節目具有什麼樣的反轉？,"The correct answer is **B: 古怪 (Weird)**.

The text explicitly states the website describes the show as having ""極其古怪的反轉"" which translates to ""extremely weird twists.""
"
大衛·韓德利收集了什麼，最終促成激進組織的攻擊行動？,"The correct answer is **A: 資訊 (Information)**.

The passage states that David Hanley's ""偵查與資訊聚會"" (intelligence gathering) led to the attack.  Therefore, he collected information which ultimately prompted the action.
"
激進組織搭乘哪種交通工具前往孟買？,"The correct answer is **C: 船**.

The text states: ""孟買恐攻者在 2008 年 11 月 26 日搭船抵達..."" which translates to ""The Mumbai attackers arrived by boat on November 26, 2008...""
"
關於文中提到的納達爾與拉奧尼奇在布里斯本公開賽，哪一種敘述能正確表達出他們交手的結果？,"The correct answer is **A: 拉奧尼奇擊敗納達爾 (Raoni won against Nadal)**.

The text states that Nadal *lost* to Raoni in the Brisbane International. Therefore, Raoni won. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:

*   B:  The 88% net points were Nadal's, not Raoni's.
*   C: The text says Nadal lost, so he didn't win.
*   D:  The 76 points were won by Nadal initially, not necessarily by Raoni.



"
根據這段文字，納達爾和拉奧尼奇在比賽首發後的戰績如何？,"The correct answer is **B: 納達爾贏得 76 分**.

The text states: ""首發贏得 76 分"" which translates to ""won 76 points at the start"". This refers to Nadal's performance in the beginning of the match.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 拉奧尼奇拿下了 88% 的網前分** - This is incorrect. The text says Nadal won 88% of the net points.
* **C: 比分是 7-2** - This refers to their overall head-to-head record, not the start of *this* particular match.
* **D: 拉奧尼奇擊敗納達爾** - The text says Nadal *lost* to Raoni in the Brisbane tournament.
"
裸體新聞的三個新廣播節目中，不包括哪種語言的節目？,"The correct answer is **C: 日語**.

The text states that Naked News already has English and Japanese reports, and the new additions are Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Therefore, Japanese is *included*, not excluded.
"
根據這段文字，哪裡不會播出裸體新聞的新廣播節目？,"The correct answer is **C: 劇院 (Theater)**.

The passage states the new programs will be broadcast on **television, web (internet), and mobile devices**.  The only option not mentioned is theater.
"
有多少參賽者沒有完成大迴轉賽？,"The question asks how many participants did *not* finish the Big Loop race. The problem states: ""女子坐式團體中有四位滑雪者未能完成比賽"" which translates to ""In the women's sitting team, four skiers failed to finish the race.""

The question is directly asking about participants who *didn't finish* the Big Loop race.  The number of participants who did not finish is given as 4.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 4 人**.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 36 人** - This refers to the number of skiers who had the same result in the small loop race.
*   **B: 117 人** - This is the total number of participants in the Big Loop race.
*   **D: 45 人** - This refers to the number of participants in the Big Loop race who did not achieve a ranking.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{C}$"
以下哪項陳述正確表達了錦標賽賽事的結果？,"Let's analyze each option:

* **A: 在第二場比賽中，卡潘內多在匈牙利滑雪者之前完成比賽**  卡潘內多在大迴轉賽中比潔爾吉．丹尼（匈牙利滑雪者）慢，所以她没有在匈牙利滑雪者之前完成比賽。  **This statement is incorrect.**

* **B: 在大迴轉賽中，有 45 名滑雪者沒有完成比賽** The question states that in the giant slalom, 45 out of 117 skiers did not receive a ranking. This implies they didn't finish the race or didn't complete enough of it to be ranked. **This statement is correct.**

* **C: 完成大迴轉賽的滑雪者人數多於小迴轉賽**  We know there were 116 skiers in the slalom and 117 in the giant slalom. The question doesn't tell us how many skiers *finished* each race, only the total number of participants. It's possible that fewer skiers finished the giant slalom, even though there were more participants. Therefore, we **cannot definitively say** the number of finishers was higher in the giant slalom. This statement is **incorrect.**

* **D: 卡潘內多在小迴轉賽中獲得第十名**  The question states that Claudia Loesch was first, and Gyöngyi Dani was ninth.  We know Gyöngyi Dani was faster than Kapanne, since Kapanne was slower than Dani in the giant slalom, which means Kapanne was faster than Dani in the slalom. Because Kapanne was faster than Dani in the slalom, and Dani was 9th, Kapanne must have been faster than 9 people.  We don't know how many people competed in slalom, nor do we have information to directly state Kapanne was 10th.  **This statement is not definitively correct, and likely incorrect.**

Therefore, the correct answer is **B**.



Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{B}$"
美國國家籃球協會 (NBA) 決定暫停以下何者的活動？,"The correct answer is **A: 籃球賽季**.

The text explicitly states that the NBA announced a *suspension of its professional basketball season*. While a player and a team are involved, the overarching action is the suspension of the entire season. Options B, C, and D are too specific.
"
根據這段文字，是什麼引發了美國國家籃球協會對病毒的擔憂？,"The correct answer is **D: 一名猶他爵士隊球員確診新冠病毒**.

The text explicitly states: ""一名猶他爵士隊球員確診新冠病毒之後，NBA 做出此決定。"" (After a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19, the NBA made this decision.)

While option A is partially true, option D is more precise and directly reflects the cause mentioned in the text. Options B and C are not supported by the provided text.
"
在對陣亞特蘭大鶇鳥的比賽中，誰為華盛頓首都隊射進了致勝球？,"The correct answer is **A: 尼可拉斯·巴克斯卓**.

The text states: ""奧維琴根當晚第一記助攻，就獻給新人尼可拉斯‧巴克斯卓打進的那顆致勝球..."" (Ovechkin's first assist of the night was to rookie Nicolas Baxtar, who scored the winning goal...).
"
在首都隊對陣亞特蘭大鶇鳥的比賽中，誰射進了他本賽季的第 60 個進球？,"The correct answer is **C: 亞歷克斯·歐維契金**.

The text explicitly states: ""他的第二次射門得分，是他在該賽季的第 60 次得分..."" which directly refers to Alex Ovechkin.
"
北岩銀行何時需要政府支援？,"The correct answer is **D: 房貸危機期間 (During the subprime mortgage crisis)**.

The passage states: ""北岩銀行受 2007 年的次級房貸危機影響而請求協助。"" (Northern Rock was seeking assistance due to the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis.)  This directly answers the question of *when* the bank needed government support.  The nationalization and separation of the bank were *results* of needing support, not the initial cause.
"
根據這段文字，關於維珍集團與北岩銀行的交易，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 維珍集團在銀行國有化後收購了該銀行**

Here's why:

* **The text clearly states:** ""理查‧布蘭森爵士的維珍集團在該銀行國有化之前曾出價收購但遭拒。 2010 年，如今的高街銀行北岩銀行公眾有限公司儘管已經國有化，但卻從被稱為「壞銀行」的北岩（資產管理）分離出來。 維珍集團只購買了北岩銀行旗下的「優良銀行」，而非該資產管理公司。""

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 維珍集團也收購了北岩的資產管理公司** - The text explicitly says they *did not* buy the asset management company.
* **C: 維珍集團在房貸危機期間為銀行提供緊急支援** - The text mentions the bank *requested* assistance *because* of the subprime mortgage crisis, but it doesn't say Virgin provided the assistance. They were a potential buyer, not a savior.
* **D: 維珍集團首次競標該銀行是在該銀行國有化後進行的** - The text says Virgin made a bid *before* the nationalization.



"
如文中所述，哪個國家受到《京都氣候協定》簽署的影響？,"The correct answer is **A: 美國 (United States)**.

The passage explicitly states that Lu Kewen's decision to sign the Kyoto Protocol put the United States in an isolated position, and it will be the only developed nation *not* to have ratified the agreement. The passage then mentions Australia, India and China as reasons the Kyoto Protocol was not widely adopted.
"
澳洲前政府認為批准《京都氣候協定》會對什麼造成傷害？,"The correct answer is **C: 煤炭出口**.

The passage states: ""澳洲前保守派政府拒絕批准《京都議定書》，聲稱其會對高度依賴煤炭出口的經濟造成損害..."" (The former conservative government of Australia refused to approve the Kyoto Protocol, claiming it would harm an economy highly dependent on coal exports...).

Therefore, the former Australian government believed the agreement would damage their **coal exports**.
"
控制補強試驗的狩獵者是為哪個計畫招募的？,"The correct answer is **D: 射擊運動協會的狩獵計劃**

The text states: ""新州國家公園管理局 (NPWS) 與澳洲射擊運動協會 (NSW) 合作，在射擊運動協會的狩獵計畫下招攬了符合資格的志工。"" This directly indicates that the hunters were recruited through the NSW Shooting Sports Association's hunting program.
"
哪種說法不能正確表達害蟲控制試驗？,"The answer is **A: 由於此為該計劃的首次試驗，因此未進行評估 (Because this is the first trial of the program, evaluation has not been conducted.)**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the trial's performance will be monitored and evaluated.**  The first sentence says: ""參與有害動物控制補強試驗的狩獵者會受到國家公園管理員之緊密監督，因相關單位需要監控並評估此試驗的績效。(Hunters participating in the pest control augmentation trial will be closely monitored by national park rangers because relevant authorities need to monitor and evaluate the performance of this trial.)""

Let's look at why the other options *can* be correctly expressed:

* **B: 狩獵者受過訓練指導 (Hunters received training and guidance.)** - The passage says: ""獲選進行第一場射擊的 4 位射擊手已接受周全的安全及訓練指導。(The four shooters selected for the first shoot have received comprehensive safety and training guidance.)""
* **C: 狩獵者受國家公園管理員監督 (Hunters are supervised by national park rangers.)** - The passage states: ""參與有害動物控制補強試驗的狩獵者會受到國家公園管理員之緊密監督。(Hunters participating in the pest control augmentation trial will be closely monitored by national park rangers.)""
* **D: 有四名狩獵者被選中 (Four hunters were selected.)** - The passage mentions: ""獲選進行第一場射擊的 4 位射擊手 (The four shooters selected for the first shoot.)""



Therefore, statement A directly contradicts information given in the text.



"
根據這段文字，裂谷是在哪裡發現的？,"The correct answer is **D: 在衣索比亞 (In Ethiopia)**.

The text states that Berhanu Asfaw is a researcher at the ""Ethiopian Rift Valley Research Service."" This directly links the research and the fossil to Ethiopia. While the Rift Valley is a geological feature, the text specifies the researcher's affiliation.
"
根據這段文字，什麼事情發生的時間比預料的更早？,"The correct answer is **A: 化石的發現 (The discovery of the fossil)**.

The quote states: ""According to this fossil, that means evolutionary divergence happened much earlier than molecular evidence predicted.""  The ""this fossil"" is what's causing the shift in the timeline. Therefore, the fossil's discovery implies that evolutionary divergence occurred sooner than previously thought based on molecular evidence.
"
玩家要做什麼才能在電子遊戲中控制動作？,"The correct answer is **D: 在空中揮動控制器 (Wave the controller in the air)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""這將讓玩家透過在空中揮動裝置以控制電子遊戲中的動作和移動。"" (This will allow players to control actions and movement in video games by waving the device in the air.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 確保控制器的感測器位於遊戲機附近 (Ensure the controller's sensors are near the console):** While sensors need to be in the vicinity, the text highlights *waving* the device. The proximity is secondary to the waving motion.
* **B: 以三角測量方式測量其位置 (Measure its position using triangulation):**  Triangulation is *how* the system tracks the controller, not *what the player does*.
* **C: 將感測器放置在電視附近 (Place the sensors near the TV):** The text says the sensors are placed *next to the TV*, not *near* it.  The important thing is the player's action.



"
什麼事物被設計成像電視遙控器的模樣？,"The correct answer is **B: 任天堂 Revolution 控制器 (Nintendo Revolution Controller)**.

The passage states: ""控制器的兩個感測器"" (The controller's two sensors) are the ones placed next to the TV. However, the question asks what *thing* was designed to *look like* a TV remote. The passage explicitly states that the **任天堂 Revolution 控制器 (Nintendo Revolution Controller)** was designed to resemble one.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 控制器的兩個感測器 (The controller's two sensors):** While part of the controller, they aren't the entire thing designed to look like a remote.
* **C: 主題演講 (The keynote speech):**  A speech is an event, not a physical object.
* **D: 任天堂 Revolution 遊戲機 (The Nintendo Revolution console):** While the console is mentioned, the question focuses on the *controller's appearance*.



"
新華社的最新報導中沒有說明什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 飛機收到炸彈威脅**

Here's why:

* The question asks what the *latest* report from Xinhua News Agency *doesn't* mention.
* The passage states the initial reports mentioned a bomb threat *as the reason* for the diversion.
* The passage *does* state the bomb threat was a factor in the plane returning to Afghanistan.
* Therefore, the latest report, while mentioning the plane returning to Afghanistan, may not specifically reiterate the bomb threat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 飛機降落在烏魯木齊** - The passage explicitly states the plane requested an emergency landing in Urumqi and was *refused*.
* **C: 飛機遭轉回阿富汗** - This is directly mentioned in the passage.
* **D: 飛機降落在坎大哈** - This is also directly mentioned in the passage.



"
新華社最初的報導中沒有說明什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 飛機遭拒絕緊急降落**

Here's why:

* The question asks what the initial Xinhua News Agency report *didn't* mention.
* The passage states that the initial reports mentioned the plane receiving a bomb threat and returning to Afghanistan. It also mentioned the plane *attempting* to land in Urumqi but being refused.
* Option B, ""飛機遭拒絕緊急降落"" (the plane was refused an emergency landing), is part of the initial report, but not the *initial* report's central focus.  The initial focus was on the bomb threat and the subsequent return to Afghanistan.

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
莎拉·戴紐斯在廣播節目中公布了什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 將不再嘗試聯繫巴布·迪倫 (Will no longer attempt to contact Bob Dylan)**.

The text explicitly states that Sara Danius said the committee had ""abandoned attempts"" to contact Bob Dylan. Option D accurately reflects this.
"
戴紐斯無法聯繫到誰？,"The correct answer is **D: 巴布·迪倫**.

The passage states: ""委員會因為無法直接與巴布．狄倫聯繫領取 2016 年諾貝爾文學獎事宜..."" which translates to ""The committee was unable to directly contact Bob Dylan to receive the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature...""

While she contacted his close associates (option A), the core issue was the inability to contact Bob Dylan himself.
"
是誰評論此一承諾是為「一大步」？,"The correct answer is **C: 戈登·喬翰羅**.

The provided text states: ""布希發言人戈登·喬翰羅將朝鮮的承諾稱為「達成朝鮮半島可核實無核化目標的一大步。」"" which translates to ""Bush's spokesperson Gordon Johnron called North Korea's commitment a 'major step towards achieving a verifiable denuclearization goal on the Korean Peninsula.'""

Therefore, Gordon Johnron (戈登·喬翰羅) is the one who made the statement about the commitment being a ""major step.""
"
斯拉尼亞為多國製作了多少枚郵票？,"The correct answer is **D: 超過 1000 枚 (Over 1000)**.

The text states: ""他為瑞典和其他 28 個國家製作了一千多枚郵票。"" which translates to ""He created over a thousand stamps for Sweden and other 28 countries."""
根據這段文字，油槽排氣孔持續漏油的可能原因是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 熱膨脹 (Thermal expansion)**.

The text explicitly states: ""截至週三下午，油槽排氣孔仍在漏油，可能是油槽內部的熱膨脹所致。(As of Wednesday afternoon, the vent on the tank was still leaking, possibly due to thermal expansion inside the tank.)""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 第二攔油區正在填滿 (The second containment area is being filled):** The text says the second containment area is *not* yet full.
* **B: 火災指揮系統例行測試 (Routine fire command system test):** The test *caused* the leak, but the reason the vent is *still* leaking is attributed to thermal expansion.
* **D: 格里利堡其中一個泵站發生火災 (A fire occurred at one of the pumps in Gritty Fort):** There is no mention of a fire at a pump station.



"
為什麼放洩閥會打開？,"The correct answer is **B: 系統測試後發生斷電**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""斷電之後的是常規的火災指揮系統測試，導致放洩閥開啟..."" (After the power outage came a routine fire command system test, which led to the release valve opening...). This directly links the power outage and the subsequent system test to the opening of the release valve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 油槽內部的熱膨脹** - This is a potential *cause* of the ongoing leak from the oil tank vent, but it didn't *cause* the release valve to open in the first place.
* **C: 油槽已全滿** - The passage doesn't mention the tank being full.
* **D: 第二攔油區無法容納足夠的桶量** - This is irrelevant to *why* the release valve opened. It's about capacity, not the cause of the initial leak.



"
目前第九區的水位有多高？,"The correct answer is **C: 水深及腰 (Waist-deep)**.

The passage states: ""目前水深及腰，附近的堤防沒入水中."" which translates to ""Currently the water is waist-deep, and the nearby levees are submerged.""
"
卡崔娜颶風來襲期間，第九區發生了什麼事？,"The best answer is **C: 洪水高達 20 英尺**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""卡崔娜颶風來襲時曾水淹高達二十英尺的第九區..."" This directly answers the question about what happened in the Ninth Ward during Hurricane Katrina.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **A: 洪水寬 100 英尺** - While the flooding was 100 feet wide, the question asks about *what happened* during the hurricane, and the water depth is more significant.
* **B: 及腰的水深淹沒了堤壩** - This describes the current situation, not what happened *during* the hurricane.
* **D: 6 英吋的降雨量沖毀了受損堤壩** - This describes a future threat, not what happened during Hurricane Katrina.



"
漢密爾頓並未證實以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 其他患者感染病毒的可能性 (The possibility of other patients being infected)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states Hamilton confirmed the patient is stable and had been in Nigeria with Ebola cases.** This directly supports options A and D.
* **The prompt explicitly states the hospital followed infection control protocols, including isolation.** This supports option C.
* **The prompt *doesn't* state anything about the possibility of other patients being infected.** It only mentions the hospital's measures to *prevent* infection spreading *from* the patient.  Therefore, Hamilton did *not* confirm that possibility.

Therefore, the answer is B.
"
科學家想瞭解的事情是什麼？,"The best answer is **D: 地球是如何形成的 (How the Earth formed)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states scientists want to understand the process of planet formation, *especially* Earth's formation. 
* The paragraph connects comets to the origin of Earth's water and organic molecules, which are important pieces of the puzzle of how Earth formed.
* While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are details *related to* the larger question of Earth's formation, not the core question itself. The text uses the comets to explain a possible source of water and organic molecules which is a significant component of how the Earth formed.

Therefore, understanding Earth's formation is the overarching scientific goal.
"
根據這段文字，當地警方在關閉隧道中扮演了什麼角色？,"The correct answer is **C: 他們指揮駕駛者改道行駛**.

Here's why:

* The text states the Maryland Transportation Authority (local police) decided to close the tunnel *after* pressure from the FBI.
* The text explicitly says they ""指揮駕駛們改道行駛"" (directed drivers to take alternative routes).
* Options A and B are incorrect because the text says the FBI pressured the MTA to close the tunnel, and the MTA *decided* to close it, not that the police persuaded the FBI.
* Option D is incorrect because the text says the alternative route didn't have severe congestion, not that it did.



"
隧道入口在關閉期間發生了什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: 它們被堵住了 (They were blocked)**.

The passage states: ""自卸卡車被用來堵住隧道的各個入口處..."" which translates to ""Dump trucks were used to block all entrances to the tunnel...""
"
根據這段文字，攝影師被車撞到前沒有發生什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **C: 攝影師拍攝了警察攔停點的照片 (The photographer was taking pictures of the police stop)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the photographer was trying to take pictures of the police stop before crossing the street.
* Option A is a step *after* the photographer was taking pictures.
* Option B is a detail *before* the incident, but not the immediate event leading up to the collision.
* Option D is not mentioned in the text.



"
攝影師在被車撞到前試圖做什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 拍攝警察攔停點的照片 (Taking photos of the police roadblock)**.

The text explicitly states: ""娛樂新聞網站 TMZ 獲知，該名攝影師在塞普爾韋達大道 (Sepulveda Boulevard) 的對側停下車，**試圖在穿過馬路並繼續前進之前對警察攔停點拍照**..."" (Entertainment news website TMZ learned that the photographer stopped his car on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard, **attempting to take photos of the police roadblock before crossing the street and continuing forward**...)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 將車停在塞普爾韋達大道 (Stopped the car on Sepulveda Boulevard)** - While true, it doesn't explain *what* he was doing after stopping.
* **C: 穿過繁忙的高速公路 (Crossing a busy freeway)** - He was attempting to cross a street, not a freeway.
* **D: 說服員警讓他繼續拍攝 (Persuading the officers to let him continue taking photos)** - The text indicates he was *trying* to take photos *before* crossing, not asking permission to continue.
"
關於總理在確診病毒後的狀況，哪種說法不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **A: 他感覺不舒服 (He feels unwell)**.

The text states: ""除了發燒和喉嚨痛之外，我覺得很健康、身體狀況良好..."" which translates to ""Besides a fever and a sore throat, I feel very healthy and in good physical condition...""

Therefore, he *doesn't* feel unwell. The other options (B, C, and D) are all directly mentioned in the text.
"
根據這段文字，以下關於總理的說法中，何者為真？,"The correct answer is **C: 他身體狀況良好，可以遠端辦公**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""除了發燒和喉嚨痛之外，我覺得很健康、身體狀況良好，可以用遠端的方式繼續工作。"" (Besides a fever and sore throat, I feel well, in good health, and can continue working remotely.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他沒有發燒:** The text specifically mentions he has a fever (""發燒"").
* **B: 他將留在家裡幾個星期:** The text says he'll be home for *a few days* (""幾天"").
* **D: 他有病毒的嚴重症狀:** The text indicates only *mild* symptoms (""輕微症狀"").



"
根據這段文字，熱帶氣旋古努預計何時會持續減弱？,"The correct answer is **B: 當風速降至每小時約 83 公里時**.

The text states: ""今日稍早時，風速約每小時 83 公里，且預期會持續減弱。"" (Earlier today, the wind speed was about 83 km/h, and is expected to continue to weaken.) This directly indicates that the weakening is predicted to happen *at* the current wind speed of 83 km/h.
"
熱帶氣旋古努巔峰期的風速有多快？,"The correct answer is **A: 每小時 149 公里**

Here's why:

* The text states the ""最高持續風速達到每小時 240 公里"" which translates to ""maximum sustained wind speed reached 240 km/h"".
* Then it says ""每小時 149 英里"", which is a conversion of the km/h speed.
* The question asks about the *peak* wind speed. The highest sustained wind speed is given as 240 km/h.  Converting 240 km/h to miles per hour is approximately 149 mph. Since the question asks for the peak wind speed which is given as a direct km/h value, the best answer is 149 km/h.

The question is slightly ambiguous because it includes both km/h and mph.  However, given the options, the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text is the km/h value.

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
以下何者並不被視為腰鞭毛藻的特徵？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是多細胞生物 (It is a multicellular organism)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that *Karenia brevis* (the species of dinoflagellate causing red tides) is a **single-celled** marine microorganism.
* Options A, B, and D are all consistent with the information provided in the text.

Therefore, the only characteristic *not* mentioned is being multicellular.
"
以下何者是腰鞭毛藻無法做到的事情？,"The correct answer is **B: 處於任何條件皆能急速增加數量 (Increase rapidly in any condition)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""自然因素可以交互作用產生理想的環境，讓這種藻類的數量急速增加。"" (Natural factors can interact to create ideal conditions, allowing the rapid increase in the number of these algae.) This implies that the algae need *specific* ideal conditions to proliferate rapidly, not *any* condition.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 癱瘓魚類的神經 (Paralyze fish nerves):** The text explicitly states, ""這種藻類會產生神經毒素，癱瘓人類和魚類的神經。"" (This algae produces neurotoxins, paralyzing human and fish nerves.)
* **C: 影響水質 (Affect water quality):**  The text implies this by mentioning red tides and the presence of toxins in the water.
* **D: 產生神經毒素 (Produce neurotoxins):** The text directly states this: ""這種藻類會產生神經毒素..."" (This algae produces neurotoxins...)



Therefore, option B is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the text.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者並非颶風費莉希亞所導致的？,"The correct answer is **D: 街道洪水泛濫 (Street flooding)**.

The text explicitly states that there have been no reports of disasters or flooding, including street flooding. The other options (beneficial rain, rain with thunder, and frequent lightning) are all mentioned as part of the residual effects of Hurricane菲莉希亞.
"
關於颶風費莉希亞的哪種說法有誤？,"The correct answer is **B: 在變成第四級颶風前，它原本被歸類為熱帶低氣壓**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""原為薩菲爾-辛普森颶風風力等級分類中第四級颶風的費莉希亞在星期二消散前減弱為熱帶低氣壓。"" This means it *started* as a Category 4 hurricane and *then* weakened to a tropical depression.  Option B claims it *was* a tropical depression *before* becoming a Category 4 hurricane, which is the opposite of what the text says.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 其產生的降雨使歐胡島受益:** The text explicitly states ""歐胡島的降水量經估量已來到 6.34 英寸，可說是「很有幫助」.""
* **C: 大部分島嶼都有降雨:**  The text says ""它的殘餘影響為多數島嶼帶來陣雨.""
* **D: 部分降雨伴隨著閃電:** The text says ""有時降雨會伴隨著雷鳴與經常性的閃電.""



Therefore, only option B is incorrect based on the provided text.
"
哪一種說法正確表達了 2009 年匈牙利大獎賽後的結果？,"The correct answer is **C: 小畢奇賽後遭到解僱 (Kimi Räikkönen was dropped as a driver after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""小畢奇在 2009 年匈牙利大獎賽後失去賽車手的身分 (Kimi Räikkönen lost his driver status after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 費爾南多·阿隆索捲入一場撞車事故 (Fernando Alonso was involved in a collision)** - The passage mentions Alonso being involved in a collision earlier, but it doesn't say he was involved in one *after* the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
* **B: 小畢奇奪冠 (Kimi Räikkönen won the race)** - The passage mentions Räikkönen losing his driver status, not winning the race.
* **D: 安全車發生撞車事故 (The safety car was involved in a collision)** - The passage states a collision occurred involving Räikkönen and Alonso, and a safety car was deployed, but doesn't mention the safety car being involved in a collision itself.



"
撞車事故發生於何時？,"The correct answer is **B: 其他汽車加油時 (When other cars were refueling)**.

The question states: ""小畢奇在費爾南多·阿隆索短暫停車檢修不久後，就發生撞車事故，導致安全車出動。 當阿隆索前面的汽車在安全車的引領下進站加油時，他移動到車隊的前方以取得勝利。""

This translates to: ""Shortly after Fernando Alonso briefly stopped for checks, a collision occurred, leading to the safety car. When the car in front of Alonso went into the pit lane for refueling under the safety car, he moved ahead of the team to take the victory.""

Therefore, the collision happened *when other cars were refueling*.
"
根據這段文字，以下哪一項花費的時間比研究人員最初認為的要少？,"The correct answer is **A: 物種的形成 (The formation of a new species)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that researchers found a new species formed in *two generations*, which is much faster than previously thought.
* The passage implies that people previously believed the evolution of a new species took a *longer* time.
* B (report) and C (breeding) are not directly addressed in the passage regarding time comparisons.
* D (evolution) is a broader term than the formation of a new species. The passage specifically highlights the rapid *formation* of a new species.

Therefore, the formation of a new species took less time than initially believed.
"
研究人員沒有報導以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **C: 新物種的名稱 (The name of the new species)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The study reports the formation of a *new* species.
* **The passage mentions:** The new species is a hybrid of *Geospiza fortes* (endemic) and *Geospiza fortis* (introduced).
* **The passage doesn't state:** The *name* of the newly formed species.

The passage *does* mention:

* **A:** The location: Galapagos Islands.
* **B:** The time frame: Two generations.
* **D:** The species involved: *Geospiza fortes* and *Geospiza fortis*.

Therefore, the research paper doesn't report the name of the new species.
"
奔牛藝術節將在哪裡舉行？,"The correct answer is **B: 在布加勒斯特市 (In Bucharest)**.

The text states: ""該城市將成為東南歐首座主辦奔牛藝術節城市。"" (The city will become the first city in Southeastern Europe to host the Burning Man Art Festival.)  It also mentions the festival is part of an event hosted by Bucharest City Hall. This directly indicates the festival will be held in Bucharest.

While the text mentions Southeastern Europe, it specifically designates Bucharest as the host city, making B the most accurate answer. Option A is too broad, C is incorrect (it's not across Southeastern Europe), and D is inaccurate (not across European capitals).
"
關於奔牛藝術節的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 這是世界上最大的公共藝術活動 (This is the world's largest public art event)**.

The text explicitly states: ""奔牛藝術節是世界上最盛大的公共藝術活動 (The Bull Art Festival is the world's largest public art event).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 這只會在公認具有「創意」的城市中舉辦 (This only takes place in cities recognized as ""creative"").** The text states Bucharest is being repositioned as a creative metropolis *because* of the festival, not that the festival *only* happens in such cities.
* **B: 這是由布加勒斯特市政廳創立的 (This was founded by the Bucharest City Hall).** The text states the Bucharest City Hall is organizing the event as part of a larger effort to rebrand the city, but it doesn't say they founded the festival.
* **C: 這是夏季在整個東南歐舉辦的藝術活動 (This is an art event held throughout Southeast Europe in the summer).** The festival takes place in Bucharest, Romania (Southeast Europe), from June to August. It's not stated to span the entire region.



"
是什麼原因導致俄羅斯停飛伊爾-76 ？,"The correct answer is **B: 一起事故 (An accident)**.

The passage states: ""事故發生後，俄羅斯短暫停飛了 Il-76."" which translates to ""After the accident, Russia temporarily grounded the Il-76.""  The passage then details the specific accident: ""10 月 7 日，一架引擎在起飛時脫落，無人受傷."" (""On October 7th, an engine detached during takeoff, no one was injured."")

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 內衛部隊 (Internal Guard)** - While the plane was originally to be flown by them, the *reason* for the grounding was the accident.
* **C: 蘇聯軍隊 (Soviet Army)** - While Il-76s were used by the Soviet army, the grounding was due to a recent accident in Russia.
* **D: 尚未完成的調查 (Unfinished investigation)** - The passage mentions the formation of an investigation team, but it doesn't state the grounding was *because* the investigation was unfinished. The grounding was a *result* of the accident.
"
什麼是伊爾-76？,"The correct answer is **C: 一架飛機 (A plane)**.

The text explicitly states that the Il-76 is a military aircraft (""俄羅斯及蘇聯軍事重要的一部分"" - a military important part of Russia and the Soviet Union).
"
誰聘請了《辛普森家庭》的編劇團隊？,"The correct answer is **B: 西蒙**.

The passage states: ""1989 年，他與布魯克斯和格寧一起合作，協助創作出《辛普森家庭》，並負責為該劇雇用第一個編劇團隊。"" (In 1989, he collaborated with Brooks and Groening to create The Simpsons and was responsible for hiring the first writing team for the show.)

Therefore, Simon hired the writing team.
"
根據弗路克所言，是誰給了她正向的留言與鼓勵？,"The correct answer is **D: 男性和女性皆有**.

The passage states that Fluke received positive feedback and encouragement ""from women and men."" Therefore, the answer is D.
"
根據這段文字，為什麼有人不想讓女性公開發表意見？,"The correct answer is **A: 男性個別人士 (Individual men)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Fluke reached her conclusion *because* she received positive feedback *from women and men* advocating for birth control as a medical necessity. The question asks why *someone* might want to prevent women from publicly expressing their opinions.  The context implies that some individuals (specifically, the implied ""opponents"" of the idea of birth control as healthcare) might want to suppress women's voices. While the passage doesn't explicitly name the reason for the suppression, the options provided, only option A makes sense.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 醫療費用 (Medical costs):** While cost is a factor in healthcare, the passage doesn't mention it.
*   **C: 婦女健康 (Women's health):** The passage is actually *about* women's health and advocating for it.
*   **D: 意外 (Accidents):**  This is irrelevant to the passage.

Therefore, **A** is the best answer, inferring that some individuals, potentially including men who hold opposing views, would want to silence women's voices on this topic."
根據這段文字，哪個天體最有活力？,"The correct answer is **A: 地球**.

The passage explicitly states: ""據我們所知，只有一個天體比泰坦星更有活力，它就叫地球。"" which translates to ""As far as we know, there is only one celestial body more lively than Titan, and that is Earth.""
"
在哪個天體上發現了由透明液體組成的河流和湖泊？,"The answer is **B: 泰坦星**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the feature being described is ""like water"" and allows you to see the bottom.
* The passage directly links this feature to Titan, saying, ""它的特性就跟水一樣。透明如水。因此，若你站在岸邊，你將能往下看到底部的鵝卵石或泥濘等東西。"" (Its characteristics are just like water. Transparent like water. Therefore, if you stand on the shore, you will be able to see the pebbles or mud at the bottom.)
* The passage further states that Titan is the only other known celestial body with a vitality comparable to Earth, implying the presence of similar features.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **木星 (Jupiter):** While Jupiter has a dense atmosphere, it's not known to have liquid rivers or lakes.
* **太陽 (Sun):** The Sun is a star, a ball of plasma, not a celestial body with liquid features.
* **土星 (Saturn):** Saturn is known for its rings and moons, but not for liquid rivers and lakes.



"
在這些發現中，何者並非發現羽毛的結果？,"The correct answer is **D: 確認大多數恐龍都有羽毛 (Confirming that most dinosaurs had feathers)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the discovery *supports* the widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers. It doesn't say the discovery *confirms* that *most* dinosaurs had feathers. The discovery provides details about feathers, but doesn't change the overall understanding that some dinosaurs had feathers.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 動物羽毛的顏色 (The color of the animal's feathers):** The passage states scientists determined the feathers were chestnut brown on the outside and whitish or carrot-colored on the inside.
* **B: 瞭解羽毛並不用來飛行 (Understanding that feathers weren't used for flight):** The passage says the feather structure suggests they were for temperature regulation or display.
* **C: 對羽毛的演變有深入的見解 (Insights into the evolution of feathers):** The passage discusses the evolution of the feather shaft (plumule) from other feather characteristics like plumules and vanes.



Therefore, the only option that isn't a direct result of the feather discovery is that most dinosaurs had feathers."
恐龍的羽毛不具備什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 羽軸 (Feather shaft)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""恐龍的羽毛缺乏發展健全的軸，所謂羽軸..."" which translates to ""Dinosaur feathers lacked the development of a complete shaft, so-called feather shaft...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 小羽枝 (Filaments)** - The passage mentions ""羽枝與羽小枝 (barbs and barbules)"", so the dinosaur feathers *did* have filaments.
*   **C: 成熟羽毛 (Mature feathers)** - The passage states ""研究人員表示，即使這是年輕恐龍的尾巴，該樣本也顯示其為成熟羽毛而非幼雛絨毛 (Researchers said that even though it is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows it to be a mature feather rather than down).""
*   **D: 顏色泛白的內層 (Pale or carrot-colored inner layer)** - The passage mentions the color of the feathers as ""栗棕色，內層是泛白的顏色或胡蘿蔔色 (chestnut brown, the inner layer is pale or carrot color).""



"
以下關於 ZMapp 的敘述中，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 它能夠治療既有感染，但不能預防死亡 (It can treat existing infections but cannot prevent death)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""ZMapp...起初很可望在實務上帶來好消息，但正式研究指出，它的效果並未達到預防死亡的預期目標 (ZMapp...initially showed promise but formal research indicated that its effectiveness in preventing death did not meet expectations).""  This directly contradicts the statement that it *can* treat existing infections. The text focuses on its lack of effectiveness in *preventing death*.
* **A: 它由抗體製成 (It is made of antibodies):** The text explicitly calls ZMapp an ""抗體雞尾酒 (antibody cocktail)"".  So, this is correct.
* **C: 它在 PALM 試驗中作為對照組 (It was used as a control group in the PALM trial):** The text states: ""ZMapp 在 PALM 試驗中作為對照組，代表科學家將其視為基準，與其他三種治療方法相比較 (ZMapp was used as a control group in the PALM trial, representing how scientists used it as a baseline to compare with three other treatments)."" So, this is correct.
* **D: 研究表明，它的效果比預期的要少 (Research shows its effect is less than expected):** The text says that the research showed ZMapp's effectiveness in *preventing death* did not meet *expectations*. This is correct.



Therefore, option B is the only statement that is *not* supported by the text.



"
關於 PALM 試驗的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 將管制藥品與其他三種治療方法進行了對照，其中一種是 ZMapp**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""ZMapp 在 PALM 試驗中作為對照組，代表科學家將其視為基準，與其他三種治療方法相比較。"" (ZMapp was used as a control group in the PALM trial, representing the scientist's view of it as a benchmark to be compared with the other three treatments.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 研究表明，它的效果可能比預期的要好 (The research shows its effect might be better than expected):** The text clearly states that the research indicated ZMapp *did not* meet the expected goal of preventing death.
* **C: ZMapp 被用作為試驗基準 (ZMapp was used as the trial benchmark):** While ZMapp *was* used as a benchmark, the statement is incomplete. It doesn't mention that it was compared *against* other treatments.
* **D: 試驗證明它可有效治療現有病況 (The trial proves it can effectively treat existing conditions):** The text indicates that the trial did *not* prove ZMapp was effective in treating existing conditions.
"
研究人員認為新芯片對哪裡的意義最大？,"The correct answer is **A: 低收入國家 (Low-income countries)**.

The passage explicitly states that the researchers believe the chip could ""讓低收入國家的癌症、肺結核、愛滋病毒及瘧疾病患早期發現病症"" (enable early detection of cancer, tuberculosis, HIV, and malaria in patients in low-income countries). The passage also highlights the disparity in survival rates between low-income and wealthier nations.
"
診斷工具將會透過何種方式製作？,"The correct answer is **C: 可列印芯片 (Printable chip)**.

The text explicitly states: ""這是一種細小的可列印芯片，使用標準噴墨印表機就能印出..."" (This is a small printable chip that can be printed using a standard inkjet printer...).

While A (each costing one cent) is a detail about the cost, and B (standard inkjet printer) is a tool used in the process, the core of *what* the diagnostic tool *is* is a printable chip. D is incorrect because the text describes a specific tool, not ""other diagnostic tools.""
"
根據這段文字，關於瓣狀陡坡的說法，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: 在月球表面發現的陡坡並不多 (The cliffs found on the lunar surface are not many)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""月球上到處都是這種陡坡"" (These cliffs are everywhere on the Moon). This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 創造陡坡的事件可能最近才發生 (The event that created the cliffs may have happened recently):** The text states the low degree of weathering suggests the cliffs are relatively recent.
* **B: 它們的存在表示月球並不缺乏地質活動 (Their existence indicates the Moon is not lacking geological activity):** The text argues that the cliffs are evidence of geological activity, contradicting the idea of a geologically inactive Moon.
* **C: 它們可能是月球縮小所導致的結果 (They may be the result of the Moon's slow contraction):** This is directly stated in the text.



Therefore, only option D is incorrect according to the given text.
"
根據這段文字，關於地形的何種理論表明月球上發生了地質活動？,"The correct answer is **D: 這些地形是最近才形成的 (These terrains were formed very recently).**

Here's why:

* The passage states the cliffs are ""風化程度很小"" (very little weathering), implying they haven't been around for a long time.
* It also says the cliffs were formed because the moon is ""正極緩慢縮小"" (slowly shrinking).
* The conclusion is that this event (moon shrinking) happened ""不久之前"" (not long ago).

Therefore, the theory supported by the passage is that the terrain is recent.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 月亮正在慢慢縮小 (The moon is slowly shrinking):** While the moon shrinking *caused* the cliffs, the theory about the timing of the formation is what the passage emphasizes.
* **B: 地形是很久以前形成的 (The terrain was formed a long time ago):** This is the opposite of what the passage claims.
* **C: 月球表面僅具有極少量的地形 (The moon's surface has only a small amount of terrain):** The passage states the opposite; the moon's surface *is* covered in these cliffs.



"
根據這段文字，起訴之前將不會再有什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 進一步的評論 (Further comments)**.

The text explicitly states: ""負責整體檢察事宜的蘇格蘭皇家檢察院向記者表示，至少在起訴前，將不再做出任何評論。"" This translates to ""The Crown Prosecution Service for Scotland told reporters that it would not make any further comments at least until a charge is brought.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 發布照片 (Publishing photos):** The text discusses the potential impact of publishing Adekoya's image, but it doesn't say that the Crown Prosecution Service will stop publishing photos. It's actually discussing the opposite - that they are *not* going to comment on it.
* **C: 討論目擊者的證詞 (Discussing witness testimony):** The text mentions the concern that the widespread publication of Adekoya's image might contaminate witness testimony, but it doesn't state that they will stop discussing witness testimony.
* **D: 發布文章 (Publishing articles):** The text doesn't mention anything about publishing articles.



"
根據這段文字，何者並非海豹目前的問題？,"The correct answer is **D: 融冰 (Melting Ice)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the problem is extreme weather *and* the *amount and thickness* of ice.
* It mentions the ice is the worst it's been in 15 years.
* The passage focuses on the detrimental effects of *frozen* ice - breaking ice and hindering rescue.

Therefore, melting ice is *not* a current problem highlighted in the text. The other options (extreme weather, amount of ice, and thickness of ice) are all directly mentioned as issues.
"
除了冰，還有什麼因素影響救援工作？,"The correct answer is **B: 天氣狀況 (Weather conditions)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""極端天氣狀況除了會導致冰層破碎，也阻礙了救援工作"" which translates to ""Extreme weather conditions not only cause ice to break, but also hinder rescue efforts.""

While the passage mentions ice, it clearly identifies weather as *another* factor hindering rescue efforts. Therefore, the question is asking for factors *besides* ice.
"
羅伯茲迴避驗證哪個信念？,"The correct answer is **C: 生命起始點**.

Here's why:

* The question states that Roberts ""refused to disclose what he believes to be the starting point of life."" This directly points to his avoidance of discussing the concept of when life begins.
* The passage explicitly mentions this as a ""very important issue in abortion ethics.""
* While Roberts *did* address other points (the morality of the case, the importance of unanimous decisions, and implied privacy), he *specifically avoided* discussing his belief about the beginning of life.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer.
"
羅伯茲覺得哪個話題太不道德而無法討論？,"The correct answer is **D: 特定可能的具體情況 (Specific possible scenarios)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""他表示評論特定可能的具體情況是不道德的"" which translates to ""He stated that commenting on specific possible scenarios is unethical.""
"
兩道光束照向何處？,"The correct answer is **A: 照向天際 (Shào xiàng tiānjì - Shine towards the sky)**.

The text explicitly states: ""整個晚上，兩道光束直直照向天際。"" which translates to ""All night long, two beams of light shone straight towards the sky.""
"
根據這段文字，該地點於何時建造新的摩天大樓？,"The correct answer is **D: 正在興建中 (Being built)**.

The text explicitly states: ""目前正在原址興建五座新的摩天大樓..."" which translates to ""Currently, five new skyscrapers are being built on the site..."" This indicates the construction is ongoing, not a specific time in the past.
"
哪些資訊表明七姐妹是洞穴？,"The correct answer is **A: 溫差 (Temperature differences)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the infrared imagery shows the ""day-night temperature differences"" and that the temperature behavior is ""not as stable... as large caves on Earth, but rather more similar to caves that go deeper underground."" This temperature difference is a key indicator of a cave's presence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 洞穴入口的直徑 (Diameter of the cave entrances):** While the diameter is a descriptive detail, it doesn't *prove* they are caves.  Many geological formations can have large entrances.
* **C: 地理調查 (Geological survey):**  The mention of the USGS is just attribution of the information, not evidence *of* the caves being caves.
* **D: 地球上洞穴的影像 (Images of caves on Earth):** The passage doesn't mention comparing the ""Seven Sisters"" to images of other caves; the information comes from the infrared temperature readings.



"
如何觀察七姐妹的熱行為？,"The correct answer is **A: 紅外線影像 (Infrared imagery)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""紅外線影像顯示其日夜溫差，顯現這些地方可能是洞穴。"" (Infrared imagery showed their day-night temperature differences, revealing that these places are likely caves.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: 地上的深洞 (Deep holes on the ground):** The passage discusses the temperature differences, not the presence of deep holes.
* **C: 洞穴的直徑 (Diameter of the caves):** The diameter is a size characteristic, not a method of observing temperature behavior.
* **D: 地球上洞穴的調查 (Investigation of caves on Earth):** While related, the passage focuses on the specific observation method used for the Seven Sisters.
"
根據這段文字，關於嫌犯的哪一種說法為非？,"The correct answer is **D: 他並未受傷 (He was not injured)**.

The text clearly states: ""涉嫌引爆炸彈的男子，在爆炸中受傷後被拘留 (The man suspected of detonating the bomb was arrested after being injured in the explosion).""

Therefore, option D is the opposite of what the text says.
"
有關這次攻擊，當局確認了哪些資訊？,"The correct answer is **B: 嫌犯的種族 (The suspect's ethnicity)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""他們知道他是維吾爾族的一份子 (They know he is a member of the Uyghur ethnic group).""
* The text *doesn't* provide information about:
    * **A: 任何共犯的身份 (The identities of any accomplices):** The text only mentions one suspect.
    * **C: 攻擊的動機 (The motive of the attack):** The text doesn't state why the attack happened.
    * **D: 嫌犯的名字與姓氏 (The suspect's name and surname):** The text says the authorities do *not* know his name.

Therefore, the only information confirmed by the authorities, according to the provided text, is the suspect's ethnicity.



"
哪些球隊將在艾利斯公園參賽？,"The correct answer is **C: 南非和澳洲 (South Africa and Australia)**.

The text states: ""該系列賽的最後一場比賽將於下週，當南非國家橄欖球隊在澳洲比賽時，在約翰尼斯堡的艾利斯公園球場舉行。"" (The final game of the series will be next week, when the South African national rugby team plays in Australia at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg.)

Therefore, South Africa (Springboks) and Australia will be playing in Ellis Park.
"
Springboks 隊的下一場比賽將在哪裡進行？,"The correct answer is **C: 約翰尼斯堡**.

The text states: ""該系列賽的最後一場比賽將於下週，當南非國家橄欖球隊在澳洲比賽時，在約翰尼斯堡的艾利斯公園球場舉行。"" (The final match of the series will be next week when the South African national rugby team plays in Australia, at Ellis Park Stadium in Johannesburg.)
"
在執行任務期間，太空站遇到了以下哪項問題？,"The correct answer is **B: 保留陀螺儀 (Maintaining the gyroscopes)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""雖然該站在先前的太空站任務中損失陀螺儀，但還是維持了其姿態直到太空漫步結束。"" This translates to: ""Although the station lost gyroscopes in a previous space station mission, it still maintained its attitude until the spacewalk ended.""

This means the *problem* was the loss of gyroscopes and the challenge of maintaining orientation *despite* that loss.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 與推進器維持適當距離 (Maintaining proper distance from the thrusters):** The passage states the astronauts maintained proper distance from the thrusters, implying it wasn't a problem.
*   **C: 噴射口啟動 (Thrusters being activated):** The passage states the Russian ground control center activated the thrusters *to* restore the station's orientation, suggesting it was a *solution* to a problem, not the problem itself.
*   **D: 恢復正常姿態 (Restoring normal attitude):** This is the *result* of the actions taken to address the problem, not the initial problem itself.



"
根據這段文字，太空站的任務目標是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 完成太空漫步 (Complete the spacewalk)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the space station *maintained its attitude until the spacewalk ended*.  The reason for needing to maintain attitude (orientation) is to facilitate the spacewalk. While the lost gyroscope and attitude adjustment thrusters are mentioned, they are presented as problems that *impacted* the spacewalk, not the ultimate goal.  The successful completion of the spacewalk is the overarching objective.
"
關於本案的陳述中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 本案已定罪 (The case has been convicted)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the suspect *was charged* but doesn't mention a conviction.** It only says this is the first prosecution under the law since 2003.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 本案起訴於 AOL 總部所在的州 (The case was filed in the state where AOL's headquarters are located):** The passage explicitly states the suspect was charged in Virginia because that's where AOL, the plaintiff, is located.
* **C: 本案使用了有關垃圾郵件的法規 (The case used regulations related to spam):** The passage clearly says the charges were brought under regulations enacted in 2003 to curb unsolicited bulk email (spam).
* **D: AOL 遭到起訴 (AOL was sued):** The passage states that AOL, the internet service provider, is the plaintiff (the one bringing the lawsuit). Therefore, AOL was sued.



"
關於本案的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **A: AOL 被指控未經許可寄發郵件** (AOL was accused of sending unsolicited emails).

Here's why:

* The passage states the suspect is being prosecuted *because* the plaintiff is AOL, the internet service provider. 
* It further explains the prosecution is under a law enacted in 2003 *to stop unauthorized bulk emailing (spam)*.
* Therefore, the prosecution is about AOL sending spam.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 本案涉及兩家網路供應商龍頭 (This case involves two internet service provider giants)** - The passage only mentions AOL.
* **C: 本案於 2003 年起訴 (This case was prosecuted in 2003)** - The law was enacted in 2003, but the prosecution is happening *now* because of a violation of that law. The passage doesn't say the case was filed in 2003.
* **D: 本案由 AOL 提起訴訟 (This case was filed by AOL)** - AOL is the *plaintiff*, meaning they are being sued, not bringing the lawsuit.



"
根據這段文字，維達爾三個賽季前開始在哪家俱樂部效力？,"The correct answer is **A: 塞維利亞**.

The text states: ""28 歲的維達爾三個賽季前從塞維利亞足球俱樂部加入巴塞隆納足球俱樂部。"" This translates to: ""28-year-old Vidal joined FC Barcelona from Sevilla three seasons ago."" Therefore, he played for Sevilla before joining Barcelona.
"
維達爾為巴塞隆納俱樂部踢了多少場比賽？,"The correct answer is **A: 49 場**

The text explicitly states: ""自從搬到加泰隆尼亞的首府後，比達爾已經為球隊踢了 49 場球賽。"" which translates to ""Since moving to the Catalan capital, Vidal has played 49 games for the team.""
"
比賽的對手是哪一支隊伍？,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text states: ""他在預定週日與 **Bolonia** 的對戰之前..."" which translates to ""He stayed in the team hotel before the scheduled Sunday match with **Bolonia**...""
"
為什麼 Jarque 住在飯店？,"The correct answer is **C: 他星期天有場球賽**.

The passage states: ""在星期天對戰波隆那的球賽之前，他一直待在球隊下榻的飯店裡."" (He stayed in the team's hotel before the Sunday match against Bologna.) This directly answers the question of why he was at the hotel.

While he also trained, the primary reason stated is the upcoming match. The other options aren't directly supported by the text."
為什麼雅加達地球物理局不發布警報？,"The correct answer is **D: 震規未達門檻 (The earthquake magnitude did not reach the threshold)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""因震規未達 6.5 級門檻，所以不會發布海嘯警報"" (Because the earthquake magnitude did not reach the 6.5 magnitude threshold, a tsunami warning will not be issued).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 沒有海嘯威脅 (There is no tsunami threat)** - While true, the *reason* for not issuing a warning is the magnitude threshold, not the absence of a threat.  The threshold is the specific criteria used to determine if a warning is necessary.
* **B: 避免居民恐慌 (To avoid residents panicking)** - While preventing panic might be a desired outcome, it's not the *reason* given for the lack of a warning. The decision is based on scientific magnitude thresholds.
* **C: 避免影響當地企業 (To avoid impacting local businesses)** - This is not mentioned in the passage and is highly unlikely to be the official reason for a scientific decision about a tsunami warning.



Therefore, option D is the only answer directly supported by the text."
根據這段文字，地震造成什麼結果？,"The correct answer is **A: 當地人的恐慌 (Local people's panic)**.

The text explicitly states that despite no tsunami threat and a magnitude below the warning threshold, residents started panicking and leaving. This is the direct result mentioned in the passage.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 海嘯威脅 (Tsunami threat):** The text clearly states there was *no* tsunami threat.
* **C: 發布警報 (Issuance of warnings):** No tsunami warning was issued.
* **D: 6.5 級震規 (Magnitude of 6.5):** The text says the magnitude *didn't reach* 6.5, preventing a warning, not that it caused it.
"
下列何者推動了太陽和所有其他恆星的活動？,"The correct answer is **C: 自轉和光度**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""他們發現太陽的運作與其他恆星的基本原理相同：系統中所有恆星的活動均受其**光度、自轉**所推動，就是這麼簡單。""  (They discovered that the operation of the sun is the same as other stars' basic principles: the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their **luminosity and rotation**, that's it.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 光度和電漿的流動** - While the passage mentions plasma flow is *related* to the Rossby number, it says the activity is *driven by* luminosity and rotation.  Plasma flow is a consequence of other factors.
* **B: 羅士比數、自轉和磁場逆轉** -  The Rossby number is *used to determine* how active a star is with respect to magnetic field reversals, but it's not the primary driver of activity. Magnetic field reversals are a consequence of the activity driven by luminosity and rotation.
* **D: 光度、羅士比數和自轉** - Again, the Rossby number isn't the primary driver; it's a factor *related to* the overall activity determined by luminosity and rotation.



"
如何判斷恆星的羅士比數？,"The correct answer is **A: 光度和自轉**.

The passage states: ""恆星的羅士比數跟電漿的流動有關，必須以光度和自轉來判斷。"" which translates to ""The Rossby number is related to plasma flow, but must be determined using luminosity and rotation."" Therefore, the Rossby number is calculated *using* luminosity and rotation.
"
有多少百分比的受訪者支持澳洲立即成為共和國？,"The correct answer is **B: 29%**.

The question asks how many percentage of respondents support Australia becoming a republic *immediately*. The text states: ""In the two extreme poll results, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible...""
"
根據茱莉亞·吉拉德的說法，澳洲應何時成為共和國？,"The correct answer is **B: 英國女王伊莉莎白二世統治後**.

The question states: ""看守總理茱莉亞‧吉拉德在 2010 年聯邦選舉的競選活動期間宣稱，她認為澳洲應該在伊莉莎白二世女王任期卸任時成為共和國.""

Therefore, according to Julia Gillard's statement, Australia should become a republic **after** Queen Elizabeth II steps down.
"
哪個組織正在接受法律調查？,"The correct answer is **C: 計劃生育聯盟 (Planned Parenthood)**.

The passage explicitly states that the Susan G. Komen Foundation's policy change resulted in the removal of Planned Parenthood's eligibility due to an ongoing legal investigation *of Planned Parenthood*.
"
克里夫·斯特恩斯是哪個委員會的負責人？,"The correct answer is **D: 監督和調查小組委員會**.

The question asks who the chairman of the oversight and investigations subcommittee is. The text states: ""身為美國眾議院能源及貿易委員會的監督和調查小組委員會的主席，司坦斯正在調查..."" (As the chairman of the oversight and investigations subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Stearns is investigating...).

Therefore, the answer is D.
"
根據這段文字，在瑞士女人身上沒有發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: 她遭竊的物品被追回 (Her stolen items were recovered)**.

Here's why:

* The text states the police recovered her phone and laptop. This means the items were stolen *from* her, but the text doesn't mention anything about her being harmed or assaulted.
* The text explicitly states she was a victim of a robbery, and the police recovered the stolen items, supporting option A.
* Options B and C are not mentioned in the text. Option D is partially true (her phone and laptop *were* stolen), but the core focus of the question is what *didn't* happen to her, and the recovery of her possessions is the most directly supported statement in that context.



"
哪家公司於 2007 年獲頒臺灣永續獎？,"The correct answer is **C: 華碩 (ASUS)**.

The text explicitly states: ""但在華碩獲得中華民國行政院所頒發的 2007 年台灣永續獎之後..."" which translates to ""But after ASUS received the 2007 Taiwan Sustainability Award awarded by the Executive Yuan...""
"
什麼是華碩 Eee PC？,"The correct answer is **B: 筆電 (Laptop)**.

The text explicitly states ""華碩 Eee PC 兼顧了精省與功能性等要素，這款電腦已成為 2007 年台北資訊月的熱門話題"" which translates to ""The ASUS Eee PC combines energy efficiency and functionality and has become a hot topic at the 2007 Taipei IT Fair.""  The context and common knowledge indicate the Eee PC is a laptop. The text later refers to it as a ""筆記型電腦"" (notebook computer), which is another term for laptop.
"
誰應對遺失的郵局文件負責？,"The correct answer is **A: 郵局工作人員 (Post office staff)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the post office *found* the files hidden by the boy and *apologized* to the citizens and media. This implies the responsibility for the lost files lies with the post office staff who were supposed to handle the mail.
* The boy is responsible for hiding the files, not for their loss in the first place.
* The residents complained *about* the lost cards; they aren't responsible for the loss.
* The media is reporting on the situation, not responsible for the loss.

Therefore, the post office staff are ultimately responsible for ensuring mail is properly processed and delivered."
根據這段文字，誰為遺失的文件公開道歉？,"The correct answer is **D: 花澤市郵局 (Flower澤市郵局)**.

The text explicitly states: ""昨天，郵局發現男孩藏了 600 多封的郵遞文件...已向市民與媒體公開道歉。""  This means the post office apologized.
"
德爾波特羅何時需要解決他的肩膀問題？,"The correct answer is **C: 第二盤期間**.

The question states: ""德爾波特羅在第二盤前期佔上風，但在比分達到 6-6 時仍需要搶七決勝負 。 **波特羅在此時接受了肩部治療**...""  This clearly indicates he received treatment during the second set, specifically when the score reached 6-6 and a tiebreak was needed.
"
第一次搶七的結果是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 莫瑞輸掉第一盤**

The question states: ""莫瑞於搶七局中輸掉了第一盤。"" which translates to ""Murray lost the first tiebreaker.""
"
如文中所述，是誰確定接觸過病患？,"The correct answer is **B: 兒童 (Children)**.

The text states: ""州長也表示：「今天，我們得知有些學齡兒童確定曾與病患接觸。」"" which translates to ""The Governor also stated: 'Today, we learned that some school-aged children have been confirmed to have been in contact with the patient.'""
"
根據這段文字，州長對德州居民講話時沒有做出什麼保證？,"The correct answer is **D: 案例並不嚴重 (The case is not serious)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the case *is* very serious.** The governor says, ""This case is very serious.""
* **The governor *does* promise to protect public safety** (""已採取措施保護公眾安全"").
* **The governor *does* claim they are exceptionally prepared** (""全世界幾乎找不到其他地方比我們準備更周全"").
* **The governor *does* assert the system is functioning as it should** (""我們的系統運作一如它應有的水準"").

Therefore, the only statement the governor *doesn't* make is that the case is not serious.
"
哪個模仿新聞來源是由兩名前華盛頓大學學生建立的？,"The correct answer is **D: 《洋蔥報》**.

The passage explicitly states: ""早在《每日秀》和《科拜爾報告》之前，1988 年赫克和詹森還是華盛頓大學的學生時，便已設想出一種以諷刺滑稽的方式模仿新聞和新聞報導的刊物。 自成立以來，洋蔥報已經成為..."" which directly links the founding of The Onion to two Washington University students (Hek and Jansen).
"
根據這段文字，《洋蔥報》的新聞模仿帝國不包括其中哪一個？,"The correct answer is **B: 一部電影 (A movie)**.

The text explicitly lists the following as part of The Onion's empire:

*   Print newspaper
*   Website (with 5 million monthly unique visitors)
*   Personal ads
*   24-hour news network
*   Podcast
*   World map collection (""Our Dumb World"")

A movie is not mentioned.
"
根據這段文字，警察在駐守什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 唐寧街入口**.

The text explicitly states: ""地點在白廳街，正對著有警察駐守的唐寧街首相官邸入口。"" (The location is Whitehall, opposite the entrance to Downing Street, the Prime Minister's residence, which is guarded by police.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 特拉法加廣場:** While protesters *passed* Trafalgar Square, the police were stationed at Downing Street.
* **B: 春季座談會:** The Conservative party's spring conference was being held at the Grand Connaught Rooms, but the police were guarding Downing Street.
* **D: 格蘭康納特飯店:** This is the location of the conference, not where the police were stationed.
"
警方何時要求抗議者移動，以避免交通更加堵塞？,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20**.

The text explicitly states: ""警察在 11 點 20 分要求抗議者退回到人行道..."" which translates to ""Police at 11:20 asked the protesters to retreat to the sidewalk...""
"
關於埃胡德·烏爾醫師所做的研究何者為真？,"The correct answer is **B: 部分曾經罹患糖尿病老鼠現在沒有糖尿病** (Some previously diabetic mice are now no longer diabetic).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""P: 「我們有 4 個月大曾經罹患糖尿病老鼠現在沒有糖尿病了」他補充道。"" (P: ""We have 4-month-old mice that previously had diabetes and are now no longer diabetic,"" he added.)
* Ehud Ur's statement is a *warning* that the research is preliminary and questions if diabetes can be cured.  It doesn't state he did the research *on* mice or that the results are applicable to people with type 1 diabetes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 結果可能對已患有第一型糖尿病患者有益** (The results may benefit people with type 1 diabetes): This is explicitly stated as *not* being the case.  Ur says the findings are irrelevant to those with type 1 diabetes.
* **C: 他樂觀地認為這些發現可找到治癒方法** (He optimistically believes these findings can lead to a cure):  Ur is *skeptical* about a cure. He warns that the research is in early stages.
* **D: 部分不曾罹患糖尿病的老鼠現在患有糖尿病** (Some mice who did not previously have diabetes now have diabetes): The passage doesn't mention anything about mice *developing* diabetes. It's about mice *reversing* diabetes.



"
根據這段文字，烏爾醫師對什麼存疑？,"The correct answer is **B: 是否可以治癒 (Whether diabetes can be cured)**.

The text explicitly states: ""如同其他專家，他對糖尿病是否可以治癒存疑..."" which translates to ""Like other experts, he doubts whether diabetes can be cured...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 研究結果是否與第一型糖尿病患者有關 (Whether the research results are related to first-type diabetes patients):** While the text *does* mention this, it's a secondary point after his primary concern about the curability of diabetes.
* **C: 其他專家對治癒方法的看法 (The views of other experts on curing methods):** The text doesn't mention other experts' views. It focuses on Dr. Ur's doubts.
* **D: 不曾罹患糖尿病的老鼠可維持這種狀態 (Whether non-diabetic mice can maintain this state):**  This is not mentioned in the text. The focus is on the diabetic mice.



"
關於 CG4684 航班墜機事件的描述，以下說法何者不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **C: 飛機在墜毀前已嘗試降落三次 (The plane attempted to land three times before crashing).**

The text clearly states the plane *failed* to land on the first attempt and *tried* again on the second, before disappearing.  It doesn't say it tried three times.

Here's why the other options are correct:

* **A: 飛機原本因天氣因素而無法降落 (The plane was originally unable to land due to weather factors):**  The text explicitly mentions ""惡劣天氣阻礙了無法降落 (bad weather hindered the inability to land)"".
* **B: 飛機墜毀在非常偏遠的地方 (The plane crashed in a very remote location):** The text states the crash site is ""難以到達 (difficult to reach)"" and requires a two-person helicopter deployment to access.
* **D: 搜尋飛機墜機地點的行動受到天氣影響 (The search for the crash site was affected by the weather):**  The text mentions the search is ""受到...阻礙 (hindered by...)"" weather.



Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
是什麼導致 CG4684 班機降落失敗？,"The correct answer is **D: 天氣條件很惡劣 (Bad weather conditions)**.

The text states: ""搜索行動同樣受到導致無法降落的惡劣天氣阻礙 (Search efforts are also hindered by the bad weather that prevented landing)."" This directly indicates that the bad weather was the reason for the landing failure.

Option A is too general.
Option B is not mentioned in the text.
Option C is incorrect; the plane was *trying* to land at Kokoda, not diverting.



"
根據這段文字，關於弗朗西斯克·科瓦爾經歷的敘述中，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 他最終毫髮無傷** (He ultimately escaped unharmed).

Here's why:

* The text states ""我很幸運地毫髮無傷"" which translates to ""I was lucky to escape unscathed"". This directly confirms he remained unharmed.
* Option A is incorrect because the text says *they* tried to break windows, not specifically him.
* Option C is incorrect because the text doesn't mention him using a chair or breaking one.
* Option D is incorrect because the text states he escaped *without* getting injured.



Therefore, the most accurate statement about Franciszek Kowal's experience based on the provided text is that he escaped unharmed.
"
為什麼很難說得準熱帶風暴丹妮爾可能產生的影響？,"The correct answer is **A: 預計風暴將增強為颶風 (The storm is expected to intensify into a hurricane)**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""會對美國或加勒比海地區造成多大的影響還很難說。"" (It is still difficult to say how much impact the storm will have on the United States or the Caribbean.) The reason given for the difficulty is the *uncertainty about the storm's future strength*. If the storm intensifies into a hurricane, its potential impact increases significantly.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 科學家們無法確定風暴的持續風速 (Scientists cannot determine the storm's sustained wind speed)** - While they might not have a *precise* wind speed yet, the paragraph mentions a current wind speed. The uncertainty is about the *future* intensification, not the current speed.
*   **C: 風暴還要很久才會登陸 (The storm is still a long way off from making landfall)** - The distance is a factor, but the main reason for the uncertainty is the storm's potential to intensify.
*   **D: 風暴距離邁阿密還很遠 (The storm is still far from Miami)** - Similar to C, distance is a factor, but not the primary reason for the difficulty in predicting impact.



"
根據這段文字，以下關於熱帶風暴丹妮爾的說法中，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: 它快要登陸了 (It is about to land)**.

The text explicitly states: ""預計暴風雨還要很久才會登陸 (It is expected to be a long time before the storm makes landfall).""

Here's why the other options are correct:

*   **A: 它對加勒比地區的影響仍然未知 (Its impact on the Caribbean region is still unknown)** - The text says it's difficult to say how much impact it will have on the US or Caribbean.
*   **B: 它在大西洋形成 (It formed in the Atlantic)** - The text states it formed in the eastern Atlantic.
*   **C: 它可能會變成颶風 (It could become a hurricane)** - The text says scientists predict it will strengthen into a hurricane.



"
根據這段文字，在引起全球大流行之前，疾病必須先發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: 必須變得不那麼致命 (Must become less lethal)**.

The passage states: ""部分研究認為這種疾病必須先變得較不致命，才有可能造成全球大流行。"" (Some studies suggest that this disease must first become less lethal to potentially cause a global pandemic.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: 症狀必須保持輕微 (Symptoms must remain mild):** The passage warns that even mild symptoms can still spread the disease, making this the opposite of what's needed for a pandemic.
* **C: 必須傳染給更多的人 (Must infect more people):** While increased transmission is a factor in a pandemic, the passage specifies the *lethality* of the virus as the crucial element first.
* **D: 兒童必須出現症狀 (Children must develop symptoms):** The passage focuses on asymptomatic infection in children, not the development of symptoms.



"
根據這段文字，當時颱風離福建有多遠？,"The correct answer is **C: 70 公里**.

The text explicitly states: ""莫拉克颱風的颱風眼距離中國福建省約有七十公里。"" which translates to ""The eye of Morak Typhoon was approximately seventy kilometers from Fujian Province, China.""
"
喬治·W·布希抵達亞洲時，是誰迎接他？,"The correct answer is **C: 黃根成和李顯龍**.

The passage states: ""由新加坡副總理黃根成迎接，並與新加坡總理李顯龍商談..."" which translates to ""Was greeted by Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong and met with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong...""
"
總統何時談到亞洲擴大貿易一事？,"The correct answer is **C: 於中期選舉失利後**.

The passage states: ""中期選舉失利的一週後，布希告訴聽眾將於亞洲擴大貿易一事。"" (A week after the midterm elections, Bush told listeners about expanding trade in Asia.)

While he *did* discuss trade with the Prime Minister of Singapore, the passage specifically links the announcement about expanding trade to the aftermath of the midterm elections. Options A, B, and D are not as precise.
"
根據這段文字，總的來說，以下何者是政府的目標？,"The best answer is **D: 紓解人潮過度擁擠的車廂 (Relieve overcrowded carriages)**.

Here's why:

* The text states the government's action (buying more carriages) is *to* alleviate overcrowding. 
* While options A, B, and C are details of the plan, they are *means* to the end goal of relieving overcrowding. The overarching objective is to address the issue of too many people on the trains.

Therefore, D captures the main goal being pursued by the government.
"
政府公告了什麼事項？,"The correct answer is **A: 他們計劃撥款購買額外 300 台的車輛**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""今天的公告也延續了政府在今年三月所說、將撥款購買更多車廂的承諾。"" (Today's announcement also continues the government's promise from March to allocate funds to purchase more carriages.)
* It further clarifies: ""加上 300 個車廂後得到的 1,300 個車輛可紓解擁擠人潮。"" (In addition, the 1,300 vehicles obtained after 300 carriages will alleviate overcrowding.)

Option A accurately reflects the initial commitment mentioned in the passage. Option C is incorrect because the passage only mentions the purchase of 300 carriages, leading to a total of 1300 vehicles.  Options B and D are too broad or inaccurate.
"
根據這段文字，我們知道了什麼資訊？,"The correct answer is **A: 威脅程度已降低 (The threat level has decreased)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""威脅程度降低至『嚴重』"" (The threat level has decreased to 'severe').

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 不再有任何威脅 (There are no threats anymore):** The text directly contradicts this, stating that even with a reduced threat level, the overall threat hasn't disappeared.
* **C: 預計會發生攻擊 (An attack is expected):** The text says there's no *immediate* indication of an attack.
* **D: 情報證實會發生很嚴重的攻擊 (Intelligence confirms a very serious attack):** The text says the threat level is ""severe"" but clarifies that it's a *reduction* in severity, not a confirmation of a highly serious attack.

Therefore, only option A is directly supported by the given text.
"
關於抗議活動，哪種說法為非？,"The incorrect statement about the protests is **C: 抗議活動要求前任臨時選舉委員會辭職 (The protests demanded the resignation of the previous temporary electoral committee.)**

Here's why:

* The text states the President's Committee requested the *previous* temporary electoral committee to resign. It *doesn't* say the protests themselves demanded it. The protests were about the lack of elections and the inability to hold them, not specifically the resignation of the previous committee.

The other options are directly supported by the text:

* **A: 總統委員會是為回應抗議活動所設 (The President's Committee was established in response to the protests.)** - Explicitly stated in the text.
* **B: 逾期選舉引發了抗議活動 (The delayed elections triggered the protests.)** - The text says the protests were ""起因是無法舉行選舉，有些選舉早在 2011 年就該舉行了"" (caused by the inability to hold elections, some of which were due as far back as 2011).
* **D: 抗議活動有時會使用暴力 (The protests sometimes used violence.)** - Directly stated in the text.

Therefore, option C is the incorrect statement.
"
誰建議前任臨時選舉委員會辭職？,"The correct answer is **C: 總統委員會**.

The text states: ""作為推動國家邁向新選舉之成套措施的一環，**總統委員會在上個月建議前任臨時選舉委員會辭職**。""  This directly translates to ""As part of a set of measures to push the country towards new elections, the **Presidential Committee** recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Committee last month.""
"
根據聲明，在納薩爾虐待運動員之後，美國體操協會不支持什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 取消資格 (Disqualifications)**.

The statement explicitly says the USA Gymnastics agrees with the US Olympic Committee that ""our athletes, teams and their sporting programs will improve because of meaningful reforms within our organization, *not* disqualification.""

Therefore, the USA Gymnastics is **not** supporting disqualifications as a response to the Nassar abuse.
"
根據聲明，美國體操協會和美國奧委會改善的主要目標是什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 為運動員推動安全的環境**.

Here's why:

* The statement explicitly says they share the goal of making gymnastics and other sports ""as safe as possible"" and ensuring athletes can pursue their dreams in a ""safe, positive, and empowered environment.""
* While the statement mentions an independent investigation (C), it's presented as a *means* to achieve the overarching goal of safety, not the primary goal itself.
* Option A (揭露賴瑞·納薩爾的虐待行為) is a contributing factor, but not the main goal. The goal is to prevent such things from happening and create a safer environment.
* Option B (實行取消資格) is explicitly rejected. They state that meaningful reforms, *not* disqualification, will improve the interests of athletes, teams, and sports programs.



"
事件發生時，船要前往哪裡？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 巴拉望**.

The text states: ""該艦是復仇者級的反水雷艦，當時正前往巴拉望的普林塞薩港。"" which translates to ""The ship is a Revenge-class minehunter and was en route to Princess Port in Palawan.""
"
關於文中提及的船，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 它位於巴拉望 (It is located in Palawan)**.

The text states the ship *was en route to* Princess Port in Palawan, but it doesn't say it's *located* there. It's in transit. The other options are all directly stated in the text.
"
是誰發表了關於美國軍隊的聲明？,"The correct answer is **A: 唐納·川普**.

The question asks who made the statement about the US military withdrawal. The text explicitly states that ""美國總統唐納‧川普透過新聞秘書發表聲明"" (US President Donald Trump issued a statement through his press secretary). While the press secretary relayed the statement, the statement itself originated from President Trump.
"
根據聲明，哪個國家承擔了保護受俘戰士的責任？,"The correct answer is **D: 土耳其 (Turkey)**.

The statement clearly says, ""土耳其也將負責看守遭囚禁的伊斯蘭國 (ISIS) 成員"" which translates to ""Turkey will also be responsible for guarding the detained ISIS members.""
"
據信墜機的原因為何？,"The correct answer is **B: 敵軍開火 (Enemy fire)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""這場墜機事件發生在高山區，**據信是敵軍攻擊所致**。"" which translates to ""The crash happened in a mountainous area, and **it is believed to be caused by enemy fire**.""

While the other options (A, C, and D) describe conditions encountered during the search, they are not the *cause* of the crash, according to the text.
"
墜機發生在何種類型的地形中？,"The correct answer is **D: 多山的 (Mountainous)**.

The text explicitly states: ""這場墜機事件發生在高山區"" which translates to ""The crash occurred in a mountainous area.""

While the other options might be *related* to the situation, only ""多山的"" (mountainous) directly answers the question about the *type* of terrain.
"
政府希望洪水帶來什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 恢復沙洲 (Restore the sandbars)**.

The passage states: ""雖然在洪水過後，水位只會上升幾英尺，政府仍希望這足以恢復下游被侵蝕的沙洲。"" (Although the water level will only rise a few feet after the flood, the government still hopes this will be enough to restore the eroded sandbars downstream.)

While the restoration of sandbars would indirectly benefit wildlife habitat, the *direct* goal mentioned is to restore the sandbars. Options B and D are also related but not the specific goal the government is hoping to achieve. Option C is irrelevant to the passage.



"
大壩的建設對以下何者產生永久的影響？,"The correct answer is **C: 野生動物棲息地**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""These sediments are the essential material for forming river mouth sandbars and beaches, which are wildlife habitats."" The dam prevented the sediment flow, leading to the loss of these habitats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 沙洲 (Sandbars):** While sandbars are affected *indirectly* by the loss of sediment, the question asks about a *permanent* impact. The passage mentions the government *hopes* to restore the sandbars, implying a potential for eventual recovery.
* **B: 座頭鯨 (Humpback Whales):** There's no mention of humpback whales in the passage.
* **D: 沉積物擴散 (Sediment Dispersion):** The dam *stopped* sediment dispersion, but this is a process change, not a lasting *impact* on something else.  The impact is on what the sediment *would have created*.



Therefore, the most direct and permanent impact of the dam's construction is on the wildlife habitats that rely on the sediment carried by the river.



"
根據這段文字，是誰向美國提供了有關可能會發生攻擊的情報？,"The correct answer is **C: 保密的消息來源 (Confidential source)**.

The text states the US received ""anonymous information,"" indicating the source is unknown and being kept secret. None of the other options are supported by the text.
"
關於極端主義者聲稱的攻擊計劃，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 在兩個國家的地標引爆炸彈 (In the landmarks of two countries)**.

The statement from the US Embassy explicitly says the planned attacks involve ""prominent landmarks"" in both Kenya and Ethiopia.  Therefore, the extremists are planning attacks on landmarks in *both* countries.
"
以下誰不是律師？,"The correct answer is **D: 麥基斯 (Makis)**.

Here's why:

* **貝佐斯 (Petros Mantouvalos)** is identified as a ""國會議員暨律師"" (Member of Parliament and Lawyer).
* **薩基斯凱亥尤基由 (Sakis Kechagioglou)** and **熱格尼科拉克波琉斯 (George Nikolakopoulos)** are explicitly stated as lawyers who were convicted of corruption.
* **麥基斯 (Makis Triantafylopoulos)** is identified as a journalist.

Therefore, the only person who is *not* a lawyer is Makis.
"
希臘法律界醜聞當中並未提及哪一群人？,"The correct answer is **C: 記者 (Journalist)**.

The text specifically mentions that judges, lawyers, paralegals (事務律師), and prosecutors have been implicated in the scandal. It also mentions journalist Makis Triantafylopoulos *revealing* the scandal. However, the question asks which group is *not* mentioned as having been involved in the corruption.  The text doesn't suggest that journalists were involved; rather, a journalist *exposed* the corruption. Therefore, the answer is C.
"
印度失去了幾個三柱門？,"The correct answer is **B: 7 個**.

The text states: ""在失去隊長的三柱門後，印度只獲得 36 分和失去 7 個三柱門..."" which translates to ""After losing the captain's three pillars, India only scored 36 points and lost 7 three pillars...""
"
根據這段文字，這一局的最高得分是多少？,"The correct answer is **C: 100 分**.

The text states: ""中間棒次擊球手薩辛・坦都卡和拉胡爾・德拉維德表現出色，攜手合作之下得分來到了100分。"" which translates to ""Middle order batsman Sachin Tendulkar and Rahul Dravid performed well, and together they scored 100 runs.""

While Robin Utpa scored the most points (41), and India ultimately ended with 36 points after losing their top three wicket-keepers, the question asks for the *highest score* in the game, and Tendulkar and Dravid's combined score of 100 is explicitly mentioned as a significant achievement.
"
以下何者非亞當·庫爾登不滿的原因？,"The correct answer is **A: 該網站關於性內容的新政策 (The website's new policy on sexual content)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Adam Coulson is *unhappy* with the actions of Wells regarding the removal of his work. The passage *ends* by mentioning the website is now working on a policy regarding sexual content *because of the community's dissatisfaction*.  This implies the policy is a *result* of the problem, not the *cause* of Coulson's dissatisfaction.
* Coulson explicitly states Wells lied about the reason for the removal, pretended to listen, and the work was deleted. These are all reasons for his dissatisfaction.
* C and D directly reflect the reasons Coulson gives for his frustration.

Therefore, the new policy is not something he is dissatisfied *with* in the context of his complaint, but rather a consequence of the issues he's highlighting.



"
根據這段文字，什麼東西從網站上被刪除了？,"The correct answer is **A: 作品 (Works)**.

The text states: ""「基本上他（威爾斯）從一開始就對我們撒謊...直到他的作品被刪除。」"" This directly indicates that ""his works"" were removed from the website.
"
根據這段文字，阿米爾·汗不支持以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 包括奧運會中的女鬥士 (Including female fighters in the Olympics)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Amir Khan believes women ""should not participate in fighting."" 
* Therefore, he would not support including female fighters in the Olympics.
* He *does* state he will support the British participants, even though he disagrees with women fighting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 英國參賽者 (British participants):** The passage explicitly says he will support them.
* **C: 婦女的意見 (Women's opinions):**  While he expresses a strong opinion *about* women's participation in fighting, the passage doesn't say he opposes women's opinions in general.
* **D: 倫敦舉辦奧運會 (London hosting the Olympics):** The passage doesn't mention his opinion on London hosting the Olympics.



"
根據這段文字，儘管與阿米爾·汗個人想法相左，他仍會支持以下何者？,"The correct answer is **C: 2012 年奧運會**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""儘管他做出那樣的評論，他仍表示會支持 2012 年倫敦奧運的英國參賽者.""  This directly translates to: ""Despite making those comments, he still said he would support the British competitors at the 2012 London Olympics.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 女鬥士 (Female fighters):** The passage mentions his belief that women shouldn't participate in fighting, so supporting female fighters would contradict his stated opinion.
* **B: 2004 年奧運會的參賽者 (Competitors of the 2004 Olympics):** The passage mentions he was a 2004 silver medalist, but it doesn't say anything about his support for other 2004 competitors.
* **D: 其他銀牌得主 (Other silver medalists):**  The passage only mentions him as a silver medalist, and doesn't say anything about his support for other silver medalists.



"
彼得·倫茨何時死亡？,"The correct answer is **C: 在醫院 (In the hospital)**.

The text states: ""後來他於該院逝世 (Later he passed away at the hospital).""
"
賽維爾·扎亞特是誰？,"The correct answer is **B: 另一位選手 (Another racer)**.

The passage states: ""蘭茲在熱身圈時摔車，被同為選手的賽維爾‧札亞特撞上。"" (Lanz crashed during warm-up and was hit by fellow racer Sevill Zayat.) Therefore, Sevill Zayat was another racer.
"
在什麼情況下，瞭解飛機的內部運作可能能夠幫助到焦慮的飛機旅客？,"The correct answer is **B: 如果他們對飛行的厭惡集中於對未知的恐懼上.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""對某些人而言，認識飛機的運作原理以及飛行中發生的事，這可能有助於他們克服基於未知或不可控因素的恐懼。"" (For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help them overcome fear based on the unknown or uncontrollable.)

* **Option B directly aligns with this statement.**  It highlights the key element: fear stemming from the *unknown*. Understanding the mechanics of a plane addresses that unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 如果乘客因恐懼而感到丟臉** - The passage doesn't address feeling embarrassed. It focuses on overcoming the fear itself.
* **C: 如果乘客對所有類型的交通方式皆抱持敵意** - This is too broad. The passage is specifically about airplanes.
* **D: 如果他們的焦慮源於與飛行無關的創傷經歷** - The passage acknowledges that some people have trauma, but it suggests understanding the mechanics of the plane might *help* with the fear *related to flying*, not necessarily with trauma-related issues.  While understanding might be helpful, it's not the core reason the passage suggests knowledge is beneficial.



"
根據這段文字，一個注重價格的旅客最後會做以下哪件事？,"The correct answer is **D: 查看航空公司的網站 (Check the airline's website)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that after comparing search results from multiple websites, a savvy traveler will ""查查看航空公司本身的網站再下單有其回報"" which translates to ""check the airline's own website before booking, which can be rewarding.""  This directly points to checking the airline's website.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 搜尋多家旅遊公司的產品 (Search multiple travel companies' products):**  The text mentions comparing across *data aggregation websites*, not necessarily multiple travel companies.
* **B: 直接向航空公司訂機票 (Directly book a flight with the airline):** While the text mentions this as *one* option after comparison, it doesn't say it's the *only* thing a price-conscious traveler will do.  Checking the airline's website first is the key takeaway.
* **C: 比較多家旅遊公司之間的價格 (Compare prices between multiple travel companies):** The text mentions comparing prices *across search websites*, but doesn't emphasize comparing *travel companies* directly.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the text is **D**.



"
根據這段文字，旅客首先應該做什麼才能確保最優惠的航班價格？,"The correct answer is **B: 比較不同資料彙集網站之間的價格**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""有時在不同的資料彙集網站上，同一班機的價差很大..."" (Sometimes, the price difference for the same flight is large on different aggregator websites...). This indicates that comparing prices across different sites is the first step to finding the best deal.  While checking the airline's website is also mentioned as a good practice, the passage emphasizes the initial need to compare aggregator sites.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 查看航空公司的網站** - Checking the airline's website is mentioned as a *second* step, not the first.
* **C: 直接向航空公司訂機票** - The passage says people *don't* usually book directly anymore.
* **D: 直接向旅行社下單** - The passage doesn't mention booking through travel agents.



"
何時需要人員陪同送貨？,"The correct answer is **C: 物品作為拖運行李寄送時** (When the goods are shipped as baggage).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""更快速送達的唯一方法，就是將貨物當成拖運行李寄送。航空公司規定禁止拖運非乘客的行李，此時你的機會就來了。"" (The only way to get faster delivery is to ship the goods as baggage. Airlines prohibit the checked baggage of non-passengers, and that's when your opportunity arises.)  This implies that personnel are needed when goods are being shipped as baggage because it bypasses normal shipping procedures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 透過空運寄送物品時 (When shipping goods by air)** - While air shipping is mentioned, it doesn't inherently require personnel to accompany the goods. It just highlights the problem the described opportunity solves.
* **B: 公司使用自己的飛機時 (When the company uses its own aircraft)** - This is for larger companies and doesn't necessarily imply a need for someone to accompany the shipment.
* **D: 交付由大公司處理時 (When delivery is handled by large companies)** -  Large companies might use various methods, and the passage focuses on the specific situation of bypassing normal baggage rules.



"
根據這段文字，在航空聯盟中選擇飛行常客航空公司時，你應該優先考慮以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 提供最多點數的航空公司** (The airline that offers the most points).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""...相同聯盟的不同航空公司給予的飛行常客點數可能會更多。"" (Different airlines within the same alliance may give more frequent flyer points.) This directly supports prioritizing the airline offering the most points.
* The passage cautions against simply choosing your most frequent airline, emphasizing that the benefits (specifically points) can vary.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: 屬於最大航空聯盟的航空公司** (The airline that belongs to the largest airline alliance) - The passage doesn't mention alliance size as a key factor.
* **C: 你最常搭乘旅行的航空公司** (The airline you most frequently travel with) - The passage advises against this, stating the offers aren't necessarily the best.
* **D: 可能另外增加特別待遇的航空公司** (The airline that might offer additional special perks) - While perks *might* be a benefit, the passage focuses on the point system as a more significant consideration within the context of frequent flyer programs.
"
根據這段文字，哪家航空公司可能會給予更多的飛行常客點數？,"The correct answer is **D: 相同聯盟中的不同航空公司 (Airlines within the same alliance)**.

The text states: ""而且相同聯盟的不同航空公司給予的飛行常客點數可能會更多。"" (And airlines within the same alliance may offer more frequent flyer points.)

Option D accurately reflects this information.
"
根據這段文字，以下哪些感官會因過量飲酒而受損？,"The correct answer is **B: 視覺 (Vision)**.

The text explicitly states that ""過量飲酒造成的長期健康問題可能包括肝臟受損，甚或失明與死亡"" which translates to ""Long-term health problems caused by excessive drinking may include liver damage, and even blindness and death."" This directly links excessive alcohol consumption to potential vision loss.

While alcohol can affect other senses like taste and smell, the passage *specifically* mentions blindness as a consequence of excessive drinking.  There's no mention of hearing being affected.
"
如文中所述，做什麼事可能可以減輕酒精的有害影響？,"The correct answer is **C: 適量飲酒 (Drink in moderation)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""飲用酒精性飲料要適量。(Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation.)"" This directly addresses how to lessen the harmful effects of alcohol. The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: 飲用含有甲醇的酒 (Drink alcohol containing methanol):** This is *harmful*, not helpful.
* **B: 飲用非法生產的烈酒 (Drink illegally produced liquor):** This is *dangerous*, not helpful.
* **D: 與不同的人一起飲酒 (Drink with different people):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the impact of drinking with others.

Therefore, only option C aligns with the information provided in the text.
"
阿姆斯特丹地產價值最高的地方在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **A: 運河區 (Grachtengordel)**.

The text explicitly states: ""其地產價值屬國內最高"" which translates to ""Its real estate value is the highest in the country.""  And it specifies that ""這整個區域"" (this entire area) refers to the Canal Ring (運河區).

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: 聯合國教科文組織列為世界遺產的地方 (The place listed by UNESCO as a World Heritage site)** While the Canal Ring *is* a UNESCO World Heritage site, the text focuses on the real estate value *of the Canal Ring itself*.
* **C: 從內城移除的區域 (The area removed from the inner city)** This is not mentioned in the text.
* **D: 具有歷史價值的地點 (Historically valuable places)**  While the Canal Ring is historically valuable, the text highlights its *real estate value* as the highest.



"
為什麼聯合國教科文組織將運河區指定為世界遺產？,"The correct answer is **A: 它的歷史和文化價值 (Its historical and cultural value)**.

The text explicitly states: ""由於其獨特的文化與歷史價值，這整個區域被聯合國教科文組織列為世界遺產..."" which translates to ""Due to its unique cultural and historical value, this entire area has been designated a World Heritage site by UNESCO...""

While the other options are true statements about the canal ring, they are not the *reason* UNESCO designated it a World Heritage site. The primary reason is its historical and cultural importance.
"
根據這段文字，下列豬山寺廟的哪一點值得一訪？,"The correct answer is **A: 洞里薩湖的景色 (The view of Tonle Sap Lake)**.

The text explicitly states: ""神廟陰鬱的氣氛和**洞里薩湖的美景**，讓攀登到山頂的這段路程值回票價."" (The temple's gloomy atmosphere and the **beautiful view of Tonle Sap Lake** make the climb to the summit worthwhile.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 穿越吳哥窟 (Crossing Angkor Wat):** The text mentions needing an Angkor Pass, but it doesn't say you *cross* Angkor Wat to get to the temple.
* **C: 參觀暹粒市 (Visiting Siem Reap City):**  The temple is located 12km southwest of Siem Reap. While you might visit Siem Reap, the text focuses on the temple itself.
* **D: 乘船遊湖 (Boat trip on the lake):** While a boat trip is mentioned as a convenient option to combine with the temple visit, the text highlights the *view* of the lake from the temple itself as a key reason to visit.



"
根據這段文字，遊客需要什麼才能進入豬山寺廟？,"The correct answer is **C: 取得吳哥窟通行證 (Obtain an Angkor Pass)**.

The text explicitly states: ""必須持吳哥窟通行證才能進入神廟，所以去洞里薩湖時別忘了帶吳哥窟門票。"" (You must have an Angkor Pass to enter the temple, so don't forget to bring your Angkor ticket when you go to Tonle Sap Lake.)
"
根據這段文字，以下何者能阻止遊客到訪南極洲？,"The correct answer is **A: 高昂的旅行預算 (High travel costs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""遊客來訪的花費頗高..."" (Visitors' travel costs are quite high...). This directly addresses the financial barrier to visiting Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 僅羅斯海值得探索 (Only Ross Sea is worth exploring):** The passage mentions that the exploration is ""多限制在半島、島嶼和羅斯海"" (mostly limited to peninsulas, islands and the Ross Sea). It *doesn't* say that only the Ross Sea is worth exploring.
* **C: 能夠在十二月和一月旅行的工作時程 (Work schedules that allow travel in December and January):** The passage states that visits are only possible during the summer months, specifically November to February.  December and January *are* within the summer, so having work schedules that allow travel then wouldn't *prevent* a visit.
* **D: 受限的身體行動力 (Limited physical fitness):** The passage mentions the trip ""需要體力"" (requires physical fitness), but it doesn't say that a lack of physical fitness *prevents* someone from visiting. It just means it's a requirement.

Therefore, the high cost is the only factor directly identified as a potential deterrent to visiting Antarctica.
"
對登山感興趣的遊客可能會參觀南極洲的哪個部分？,"The correct answer is **B: 內陸地區 (Interior regions)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""專家偶爾會搭機進入南極州內陸登山..."" (Experts occasionally fly into the interior of Antarctica to climb...).  This directly indicates that the interior is accessible for climbing.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 羅斯海 (Ross Sea):**  The passage says the area is ""多限制在半島、島嶼和羅斯海"" (mostly limited to peninsulas, islands, and the Ross Sea). This implies it's *part* of the area, not the specific location for climbing.
* **C: 半島 (Peninsulas):** Same reasoning as Ross Sea - part of the area, not the specific location for climbing.
* **D: 島嶼 (Islands):** Same reasoning as Ross Sea - part of the area, not the specific location for climbing.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the passage is the interior regions.
"
前現代天文台最不可能位於何處？,"The correct answer is **B: 市中心 (City center)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""由於光害在前現代天文台的全盛時期沒有如今嚴重，它們通常坐落在城市或校園中..."" This implies that while they *could* be in city centers, they weren't *primarily* located there.
* **The passage also states:** ""...大部分現代研究型望遠鏡都是巨大的設施，座落於有大氣條件良好的偏遠地區.""  This highlights that modern telescopes are *not* in city centers.
* **The question asks for the *least likely* location.** Considering the above, a city center is the least likely place for a pre-modern observatory.  Light pollution would have been a major issue, making observations difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 交通便利的位置 (Conveniently located place):** The passage states pre-modern observatories were *often* located in cities or campuses, which *could* be convenient.
* **C: 偏遠之地 (Remote location):** The passage mentions that while pre-modern observatories were often in cities, they were sometimes in campuses and could have been relatively secluded.
* **D: 大學校園裡 (On a university campus):** The passage specifically states they were sometimes located on university campuses.



"
現代研究型望遠鏡可能安置在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **D: 大型設施**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""大部分現代研究型望遠鏡都是巨大的設施，座落於有大氣條件良好的偏遠地區。"" (Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with good atmospheric conditions.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 博物館 (Museum):**  The passage states that *former* pre-modern observatories are now often museums, not modern research telescopes.
* **B: 大學校園 (University campus):** While some modern telescopes *might* be located on university campuses, the passage emphasizes they are in remote areas. University campuses are often urbanized.
* **C: 教育場所 (Educational places):** Similar to university campuses, some modern telescopes *could* be on educational places, but the passage highlights their remote locations.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the passage is that modern research telescopes are located in **large facilities**.
"
根據這段文字，哪個區域最適合寧靜的海灘日？,"The answer is **C: 北港區 (North Shore)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the North Shore beaches are ""almost all safe for swimming"" and ""most have Norfolk Pines providing shade."" This suggests a more relaxed and less crowded atmosphere.
* The text describes Tamaki Drive Beach as ""sometimes crowded"" and located near shops, implying it's more of a lively, family-oriented beach.
* The text mentions Mission Bay and St Heliers as locations *within* Tamaki Drive Beach, not as distinct regions for tranquil beach days.
* Waitetmata Harbour is only mentioned in relation to Tamaki Drive Beach, not as a region with tranquil beaches of its own.

Therefore, the North Shore (北港區) is the best fit for a quiet beach day based on the provided information.
"
根據這段文字，哪裡的游泳條件可能最為安全？,"The correct answer is **A: 德文港 (Devonport)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""那些地方幾乎都是能讓人安全游泳的沙灘，且大多數都有紐西蘭聖誕樹提供的樹蔭。"" (Those places are almost all beaches where people can swim safely, and most have New Zealand Christmas trees for shade).  This directly refers to the beaches in the North Shore, specifically mentioning that the beaches from Devonport to Takapuna are safe for swimming.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: 北港區 (North Shore):** This is too broad. While Devonport *is* in the North Shore, the text specifically points to the beaches *between* Devonport and Takapuna as being particularly safe.
*   **C: 奧克蘭中央區 (Central Auckland):**  The text mentions Tamaki Drive Beach is in this area, but it also notes it's ""有時擁擠的家庭海灘 (sometimes crowded family beach)"". While it's safe to swim, the text doesn't emphasize safety as strongly as it does for the North Shore beaches.
*   **D: 長灣 (Long Bay):**  While Long Bay is part of the North Shore beaches mentioned, the text doesn't specifically call out Long Bay as particularly safe, just the stretch from Devonport to Takapuna.

Therefore, **德文港 (Devonport)** is the best answer because it represents the beginning of the stretch of beaches described as having very safe swimming conditions.
"
到訪文中所述的位置時，下列何者會被視為不合時宜的舉動？,"The correct answer is **B: 在遺址周圍的某處留下標記 (Leaving markings somewhere around the site)** and **C: 開玩笑 (Making jokes)** and **D: 在建築物上塗鴉 (Graffitiing on the buildings)**.

The prompt explicitly states these actions are inappropriate and disrespectful.  While ""舉止莊重"" (behaving respectfully) is correct, options B, C and D are directly forbidden. Since the question asks for *which* would be considered inappropriate, the most direct answers are B, C, and D. However, among the choices, the best single answer that encompasses all the guidelines is **C: 開玩笑 (Making jokes)**, as it directly addresses the prompt's prohibition against making light of the Holocaust and Nazi atrocities.

Since the question asks for *one* choice, and several are wrong, it's difficult to select *the* best one.  However, the spirit of the prompt is to emphasize respect and solemnity. Therefore,  the most directly wrong action listed is making jokes.
"
以下何者說明了通用語言？,"The correct answer is **D: 是有機的 (is organic)**.

Here's why:

* **通用語言 (Universal Language)**, in the context of linguistics, refers to a language that develops naturally and spontaneously within a community. It emerges through regular use and evolution among speakers, rather than being deliberately created. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 是人工的 (is artificial)** - This describes auxiliary languages, not universal languages.
* **B: 是不自然的 (is unnatural)** -  While any language can be considered ""unnatural"" in the sense that it's a human creation, the key distinction of a universal language is its natural development.
* **C: 是建構而成的 (is constructed)** - This is a description of constructed languages (conlangs) like Esperanto, which are *different* from natural universal languages.



Therefore, the only option that accurately describes the nature of a universal language is ""有機的"" (organic).



"
關於輔助語言的描述，以下說法何者不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **A: 它們是有機語言，用於輔助可能無法互相理解的人之間的溝通 (They are organic languages used to assist communication between people who may not understand each other.)**

Here's why:

* **輔助語言 (Auxiliary Languages)** are *constructed* languages, not organic (naturally evolved) languages.  They are deliberately created for the purpose of international communication.
* Options B, C, and D are all accurate descriptions of auxiliary languages.

Therefore, A is the only statement that contradicts the definition of an auxiliary language.
"
根據這段文字，如果乘客是搭乘冬季郵輪，他們應該檢查什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 艙房位置**.

The text explicitly states: ""若是在冬季穿越北波羅的海，請確認您艙房的位置，因為對受影響最嚴重的艙房，穿過浮冰會產生非常可怕的噪音。"" (If you are crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, please check your cabin location, because the cabins most affected by ice will produce very loud noises when passing through the ice.)

While the text mentions Saint Petersburg and visa information, the primary and specific instruction related to winter cruises is to check cabin location. Therefore, A is the most accurate answer.
"
根據這段文字，如果乘客是搭乘夏季郵輪，他們可能可以避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **B: 穿過浮冰**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically mentions the noise from passing through ice is a winter-only concern on the Baltic Sea. 
* The question asks what a passenger *might* avoid if traveling in the summer. 
* Therefore, traveling in the summer would avoid the potentially noisy experience of crossing the floating ice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在城裡的時間:** The text mentions a city tour in St. Petersburg, which would be available regardless of the season.
* **C: 簽證要求:** The text says passengers *don't* need a visa (but to check regulations), so it wouldn't be a concern in either season.
* **D: 聖彼得堡:** The text mentions St. Petersburg as the city for the tour, so it's still relevant regardless of the season.



"
為什麼巴塞隆納的標誌和廣播經常使用加泰隆尼亞語？,"The correct answer is **B: 它是該市的第一官方語言 (It is the first official language of the city)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""因為它是法律規定的第一官方語言 (Because it is the first official language stipulated by law).""

While option A is partially true (more people understand Catalan than Spanish), the primary reason given in the text is the legal status. Options C and D are not supported by the information provided.
"
巴塞隆納的地鐵系統使用以下哪種語言進行固定廣播？,"The correct answer is **B: 加泰隆尼亞語**.

The text explicitly states: ""地鐵中的固定廣播只有加泰羅尼亞語..."" (The fixed announcements in the metro are only in Catalan...).
"
根據這段文字，高端市場中的寢具用品和早餐不太可能優先考慮以下哪些設施？,"The correct answer is **D: 快速的無線網路 (Fast Wi-Fi)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that in the high-end B&B market, the primary competition revolves around **bedding and breakfast**.  It describes luxurious bedding (hand-stitched linens, antique beds) and special breakfasts featuring local, seasonal ingredients or host-prepared dishes.

While the passage mentions historical buildings with antique furniture and well-maintained gardens, these are presented as supporting elements of a luxurious experience centered around the core offerings: bedding and breakfast.

**Fast Wi-Fi** is not mentioned at all and isn't presented as a key differentiator or expected amenity in the context of *luxury* B&Bs focused on bedding and breakfast.  It's a common expectation, but not what the passage highlights as competitive advantages *within the high-end market focused on these specific offerings*.

Therefore, D is the best answer because it represents an amenity that is not prioritized in the described luxury market.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者不是豪華民宿之間的競爭要點之一？,"The correct answer is **A: 現代裝飾 (Modern Decor)**.

The text explicitly states that the two main competitive factors in luxury B&Bs are:

*   **寢具用品 (Bedding):** Specifically mentioning luxurious linens, handmade sheets, or antique beds.
*   **早餐 (Breakfast):**  Highlighting local seasonal cuisine or the host's specialty dishes.

While ""各種季節性早餐 (Various seasonal breakfasts)"" and ""當地採購的食物和飲料 (Locally sourced food and beverages)"" are covered under the breakfast category, ""高檔寢具 (Luxurious bedding)"" is directly mentioned. ""現代裝飾 (Modern Decor)"" is *not* mentioned as a key competitive point.



"
根據這段文字，2022 年北京不會舉辦以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 太子城滑雪區活動**.

The text explicitly states that while other skiing events will be held in the太子城滑雪區, those events are *not* in Beijing, but in Zhangjiakou. The opening and closing ceremonies, and indoor ice events *are* in Beijing.
"
根據這段文字，2022 年北京會舉辦以下何者？,"The correct answer is **C: 冬季奧運會**.

The text explicitly states: ""中國的北京市將主辦 2022 年的冬季奧林匹克運動會..."" which translates to ""Beijing, China will host the 2022 Winter Olympic Games...""

The text also mentions Beijing will host the opening and closing ceremonies and indoor ice events, and that other skiing events will be in Zhangjiakou. While the other options are true based on the text, the primary event Beijing is hosting is the Winter Olympics. Therefore, C is the most accurate and comprehensive answer.
"
誰感染禽流感的風險最高？,"The correct answer is **C: 家禽飼養從業人員**.

The passage explicitly states: ""大部分的案例都是家禽飼養從業人員..."" (Most cases are among poultry workers...).  While bird watchers also have some risk, poultry workers are identified as having the highest risk.
"
根據這段文字，關於禽流感的描述，以下說法何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 賞鳥者有被感染的風險**.

Here's why:

* **A: 只有家禽飼養從業人員感染過** - The text states that while most cases are in poultry workers, birdwatchers also have some risk, so this is incorrect.
* **B: 已知在人類身上發生的案例多於鳥類** - The text mentions cases in both birds and mammals, but doesn't specify which is more common.  It only states that there have been less than 1000 cases in humans.
* **C: 賞鳥者有被感染的風險** - The text explicitly states: ""但賞鳥者也會有一些風險。"" (But birdwatchers also have some risk.)
* **D: 已知在人類身上發生的案例都是致命的** - The text says ""有些是致命的"" (some are fatal), not that all cases are fatal.

Therefore, only option C is directly supported by the provided text."
白海-波羅的海運河連接了什麼地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 北極海和波羅的海**

The passage states: ""白海-波羅的海運河經過奧涅加湖、拉多加湖和聖彼得堡，主要以河川和湖泊將北極海和波羅的海連在一起。"" which translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic Canal passes through Lake Onega, Lake Ladoga, and St. Petersburg, mainly connecting the Arctic Ocean and the Baltic Sea with rivers and lakes.""
"
根據這段文字，為了避免打擾乘客，護照可能會在什麼類型的交通工具上被收走？,"The correct answer is **B: 夜間臥鋪火車**.

The text explicitly states: ""搭乘夜間臥鋪火車時，列車長可能會將護照收走，這樣就不會打斷你的睡眠。"" (When taking a night sleeper train, the train conductor may take your passport to avoid interrupting your sleep.)

Therefore, option B is the only correct answer.
"
根據這段文字，在某些跨境火車上，何時可能會查驗你的身分證？,"The correct answer is **D: 火車行進時**.

The text states: ""某些跨越邊境的火車會在行進時進行檢查，因此搭乘這種火車時，你應該攜帶有效的身分證明."" (Some cross-border trains conduct checks while in motion, so you should carry valid identification when taking such a train.)

Option D directly reflects this statement.
"
留在新加坡的高熱帶地區時，最有可能出現以下哪種問題？,"The correct answer is **C: 中暑 (Heatstroke)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt specifically mentions high temperatures and intense sun.** These are the primary dangers of being in a tropical climate.
* **Heatstroke** is a direct consequence of prolonged exposure to high heat and sun.
* **A: 遭搶 (Being Robbed)** is not mentioned as a significant concern in the prompt. Singapore is known for being very safe.
* **B: 無法進入商店 (Unable to Enter Stores)** is not related to the weather conditions described.
* **D: 迷路 (Getting Lost)** is possible in any location, but not directly linked to the hot and sunny weather.



"
誰可能會不想吃德國糕點？,"The best answer is **B: 喜歡甜點更豐富的人**.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes the deliciousness and variety of German pastries.** It highlights the abundance of fruit pastries, nuts, and the popularity of pastries paired with coffee. This all suggests a love of rich and sweet treats.
* **Option A** is incorrect because the text *mentions* nuts, but doesn't say it's a problem for everyone.
* **Option C** is irrelevant to the text.  The text doesn't discuss chocolate.
* **Option D** is incorrect. The text is *all* about sweet treats, not savory ones.

Therefore, someone who appreciates and enjoys a wide variety of sweet, rich desserts would likely be drawn to German pastries.
"
哪種食材屬於德國糕點的季節性元素？,"The correct answer is **C: 李子 (Plums)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""蘋果常年被製作成糕點，櫻桃與李子則在夏日會出現在餐桌上。"" (Apples are made into pastries all year round, while cherries and plums appear on the table in summer.) This indicates that plums are a seasonal ingredient, specifically appearing in the summer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 蘋果 (Apples):** The text says apples are available ""all year round,"" making them a year-round ingredient, not seasonal.
* **B: 榛果 (Hazelnuts) & D: 杏仁 (Almonds):** The text says these nuts are ""常含有"" (often contain) in many German baked goods, indicating they are common ingredients, not seasonal.



"
根據這段文字，針對預算有限的旅行而言，以下何者並非推薦方法？,"The correct answer is **C: 跟人要錢 (Asking people for money)**.

The text explicitly states: ""這建議的前提是旅客不會為了自己的利益而偷竊、擅自闖入、參與非法買賣、乞討或以別的方式剝削他人。"" (The premise of this suggestion is that travelers will not steal, break and enter, participate in illegal transactions, beg, or exploit others in any other way for their own benefit.)

Therefore, asking people for money is specifically discouraged, as it falls under the category of exploitation. The other options (finding odd jobs, adjusting comfort levels, and reducing expenses) are all presented as valid strategies for budget travel.
"
根據這段文字，誰可能很難以最低預算旅行？,"The correct answer is **D: 喜歡按照預定行程走的人 (People who like to stick to a schedule)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that to travel on a minimal budget, you need to be willing to sacrifice **predictability** and **comfort**.  Option D, ""喜歡按照預定行程走的人"" (People who like to stick to a schedule), is directly opposed to the flexibility needed for budget travel, which often involves being spontaneous and adapting to unforeseen circumstances.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 歡迎挑戰的人 (People who welcome challenges):**  While a willingness to embrace challenges *helps* with budget travel, it's not the primary reason someone might *struggle* with it.
* **B: 沒有嚴格時間限制的人 (People who don't have strict time limitations):** Not having time constraints *facilitates* budget travel, as it allows for longer stays in cheaper locations.
* **C: 計劃在旅行時遠端工作的人 (People who plan to work remotely while traveling):** Working remotely *can help* cover expenses, making budget travel easier, not harder.

Therefore, those who prefer structure and planning will likely find it difficult to travel on a very low budget.
"
關於波恩馬里恩和費爾蒙特之間的車程，以下說法何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 很少人遵守速度限制 (Few people obey speed limits)**.

The text explicitly states: ""嚴格遵守這些速限甚至比其他路段更重要"" which translates to ""Strictly observe these speed limits, it is even more important than other road sections."" This directly contradicts option C.

Here's why the other options are correct:

* **A: 有長長的偏遠鄉村道路 (There are long, remote rural roads):** The text says the road ""途中經過許多偏僻的荒涼地區"" (passes through many remote and desolate areas).
* **B: 車道很窄 (The roads are narrow):** The text says ""窄道和急彎占了絕大多數"" (narrow roads and sharp turns make up the majority).
* **D: 行動通訊服務應該不是問題 (Mobile phone service should not be a problem):** The text says ""這裡的行動通訊服務比沿途其他路段還要強得多"" (the mobile phone service here is much stronger than other road sections along the way).



"
根據這段文字，在水牛城─匹茲堡高速公路上行駛的駕駛應該主要關心哪些事項？,"The correct answer is **C: 急彎轉太快 (Sharp turns)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the road between Bonneville and Fairmont is known for its ""steep slopes, narrow roads, and sharp turns."" 
* It emphasizes the importance of adhering to the lower speed limits due to these conditions.
* Option A is incorrect because the passage describes a desolate area, not a congested one.
* Option B is incorrect because the passage states that cell service is *stronger* than in other areas.
* Option D is incorrect because there's no mention of road construction in the passage.



"
如果要開始溪降，以下哪一點非必要？,"The correct answer is **B: 巔峰體能狀態 (Peak physical condition)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""但訓練或身體狀態的入門要求相對較低（例如相較於攀岩、水肺潛水或高山滑雪）"" which translates to ""but the entry requirements for training or physical condition are relatively low (compared to rock climbing, scuba diving, or high-altitude skiing).""
* **This implies:** While some fitness is helpful, you don't need to be in peak physical condition to start.
* **Swimming, jumping, and some training are all mentioned as aspects of canyoning, suggesting they are beneficial, but not necessarily requiring peak physical condition.**

Therefore, a peak physical condition is *not* a requirement to get started with canyoning.
"
以下何者是成功的溪降之旅所不能少的？,"The correct answer is **D: 游泳能力**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that canyoning involves swimming.** Therefore, swimming ability is a fundamental requirement.
* **A: Advanced athletic ability** is *not* necessarily required; the passage mentions low entry requirements.
* **B: Scuba diving experience** is irrelevant to canyoning.
* **C: Canyoning certification** is *helpful* but not explicitly stated as *essential* for a successful trip. While certification is recommended for safety, basic swimming is a more fundamental prerequisite.



Therefore, swimming is the *least* negotiable requirement for a successful canyoning trip according to the information given.



"
根據這段文字，對於打算進行汽車露營的人來說，什麼事情會有所幫助？,"The correct answer is **B: 座椅能放平的車輛 (A vehicle with folding seats)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""如果您有一輛座椅能放平的大型迷你廂型車、休旅車、轎車或是旅行車，便能從事汽車露營。"" (If you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon with folding seats, you can do car camping.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 深入了解自身車輛的侷限 (Understanding the limitations of your vehicle):**  While understanding your vehicle is generally helpful for any trip, the text doesn't highlight it as *essential* for car camping specifically. It's mentioned in the context of understanding what car camping *isn't*.
* **C: 一頂帳篷 (A tent):** The text says car camping isn't really about *camping* in the traditional sense, suggesting tents are not required.
* **D: 用於露營的私人土地 (Private land suitable for camping):**  While important for any camping trip, the text focuses on the *vehicle* being key to car camping.



Therefore, the answer is **B**.



"
根據這段文字，如果汽車露營者希望保持低調，他們可能想要避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **C: 在城裡或私人土地上搭帳篷 (Camping in cities or on private land)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""在私人土地或任何大小的城鎮搭起帳棚，都很容易引起不必要的注意。"" (Camping on private land or in any size town is very likely to attract unwanted attention.)
* The text implies that car camping is a way to avoid unwanted attention, suggesting that traditional camping (like setting up a tent) is the problem.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 駕駛大型車輛，如休旅車或迷你廂型車 (Driving large vehicles like SUVs or minivans):** The text says *having* a vehicle with a flat-folding seat is good for car camping. It doesn't say *driving* large vehicles is the problem.
* **B: 進行更長的公路之旅 (Taking longer road trips):** The length of the trip isn't mentioned as a factor affecting attention.
* **D: 不熟悉自身使用的車輛 (Being unfamiliar with one's vehicle):** The text states familiarity with the vehicle is helpful, not a problem.



"
根據這段文字，是誰二度重建了卡薩布蘭卡？,"The correct answer is **D: 摩洛哥蘇丹**.

The text states: ""摩洛哥蘇丹重建了這座城市，取名「達魯 I 巴迪亞」."" (The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city, naming it ""Dar al-Badi"")."
在自然災害後，誰拋棄了現代城市卡薩布蘭卡？,"The correct answer is **B: 葡萄牙人 (Portuguese)**.

The passage states: ""葡萄牙人將這座城市夷平重建，並命名為「Casa Branca」（白色房子），在 1755 年發生地震後又遺棄了這個地方。"" which translates to: ""The Portuguese leveled and rebuilt the city, naming it ""Casa Branca"" (White House), and then abandoned the place after the earthquake in 1755.""
"
根據這段文字，辛特拉是如何廣為外國人所知？,"The correct answer is **C: 拜倫男爵的正面評價 (Lord Byron's favorable description)**.

The text explicitly states that Sintra is famous to foreigners ""because Lord Byron vividly described its beauty."" 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 羅卡角 (Rocinha):** Rocinha is a location where the bus stops, but it doesn't explain *why* Sintra is known to foreigners.
* **B: 聖母顯靈處 (Marian apparition site):** While Fátima is mentioned as a destination, it's not what makes Sintra famous to foreigners according to the text.
* **D: 它浪漫的歷史 (Its romantic history):** While Sintra *is* romantic, the text specifically points to Byron's description as the reason for its fame among foreigners.



"
亞美尼亞不承認什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 新共和國 (The new republic)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""然而，沒有任何已成立的國家正式承認它，就連亞美尼亞也不承認。"" (However, no established country officially recognized it, not even Armenia.)  ""它"" refers to the new republic that was formed in Nagorno-Karabakh.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 納戈爾諾－卡拉巴赫地區 (The Nagorno-Karabakh region):** Armenia *is* involved in the ongoing diplomatic dispute *over* the region, but the text doesn't say they don't recognize the region itself.
* **B: 對亞塞拜然人發動了戰爭 (The war against the Azeris):** The text describes the war, but it doesn't say Armenia doesn't acknowledge having fought it.
* **C: 關於亞塞拜然的外交爭論 (Diplomatic disputes regarding Azerbaijan):** Armenia is involved in the disputes, but the text doesn't suggest they don't acknowledge their existence.



"
何者持續影響亞塞拜然與亞美尼亞之間的關係？,"The correct answer is **C: 外交爭論 (Diplomatic disputes)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""關於此地區的外交爭論持續損害亞美尼亞和亞塞拜然之間的關係。"" (Diplomatic disputes over the region continue to damage relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan.)

While the other options are related to the conflict, the passage directly identifies *diplomatic disputes* as the ongoing factor impacting the relationship. Here's why the other options are less accurate as the *ongoing* factor:

* **A: 居住在亞塞拜然的亞美尼亞人 (Armenians living in Azerbaijan):** This was a factor *leading up to* the conflict, but the passage doesn't say it's the *ongoing* issue.
* **B: 1994 年的戰爭 (The 1994 war):** The war *caused* the ongoing disputes, but the passage points to the disputes themselves as the continued problem.
* **D: 納戈爾諾－卡拉巴赫地區 (The Nagorno-Karabakh region):**  The region is the *subject* of the disputes, but the passage identifies the *disputes* as what's damaging the relationship.



"
在夏洛特搭乘計程車時，何者可能會導致額外費用？,"The correct answer is **B: 有三名乘客 (Having three passengers)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""超過兩名乘客需支付額外的費用，所以這個做法可能會多花不必要的錢。"" which translates to ""More than two passengers need to pay extra, so this practice may cost unnecessary money.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 居住在其他地區 (Living in other areas):** The passage states that family-friendliness is a reason people move *to* Charlotte, not that living elsewhere causes extra fees.
* **C: 前往上城區 (Going to Uptown):** The passage mentions Uptown as a family-friendly area, but it doesn't say that going there incurs extra taxi fees.
* **D: 家庭友善的態度 (Family-friendly attitude):** This is a characteristic of the city, not a reason for extra taxi charges.



"
根據這段文字，帶著孩子在夏洛特一起生活有什麼缺點？,"The correct answer is **B: 搭乘計程車 (Taking taxis)**.

The text specifically mentions that while taxis can be convenient in certain situations, they can be expensive because of extra charges for more than two passengers. This is presented as a potential drawback to consider.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 房價 (Housing prices):** The text doesn't mention anything about housing costs.
*   **C: 來自其他地區的居民 (Residents from other areas):** The text states that family-friendliness is a *reason* people move *to* Charlotte, not a drawback.
*   **D: 試圖享受這座城市 (Trying to enjoy the city):** The text says visitors *can easily* enjoy the city with children. This is a positive, not a negative.

Therefore, the only negative aspect of living in Charlotte with children mentioned in the passage is the potential expense of taking taxis."
在西班牙人抵達前，是誰控制了智利北部？,"The correct answer is **D: 印加人**.

The passage states: ""在西班牙人於 16 世紀抵達智利前，其北部受印加帝國統治..."" which translates to ""Before the Spanish arrived in Chile in the 16th century, its north was ruled by the Inca Empire...""

While the Mapuche inhabited the central and southern parts of Chile, the north was under Inca control. The Araucanian people are the Mapuche people.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者未在 1810 年發生？,"The correct answer is **B: 智利戰勝西班牙 (Chile defeated Spain)**.

The passage states: ""雖然智利在 1810 年即宣佈獨立(...), 但直到 1818 年才擊敗西班牙，取得決定性的勝利."" This means the victory over Spain happened *after* 1810.

Here's why the other options are correct according to the passage:

*   **A: 沒有中央政府 (No functioning central government):** The passage says, ""(當時正值拿破侖戰爭，西班牙有好幾年都沒有正常運作的中央政府)"" - meaning there wasn't a functioning central government at the time of the declaration of independence in 1810.
*   **C: 時值拿破侖戰爭 (It was during the Napoleonic Wars):** The passage explicitly states, ""(當時正值拿破侖戰爭...)""
*   **D: 智利宣布獨立 (Chile declared independence):** The passage says, ""雖然智利在 1810 年即宣佈獨立...""



"
人們如何到達利古里亞地區的偏遠村莊？,"The correct answer is **C: 搭乘火車或船**

Here's why:

The text states: ""汽車卻無法從外頭開進這裡。"" (Cars cannot drive in from the outside).  It also mentions that ""步道、火車與船隻串起了村莊..."" (paths, trains, and boats connect the villages...).

Therefore, the only modes of transportation mentioned as being accessible to the villages are train and boat.
"
義大利文專門名稱「五鄉地」指的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 五座村莊 (Five villages)**.

The text explicitly states that Cinque Terre is composed of five seaside villages: Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza, and Monterosso.
"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的靴子適合冬季可能會有的濕滑狀況？,"The correct answer is **B: 具有鞋釘配備的靴子**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions that ""有些靴子帶有鞋釘，也有專為溼滑環境而設、適用於多數鞋子與靴子的拆卸式鞋釘，可僅裝配在鞋跟，或在鞋跟、鞋底皆裝."" (Some boots have studs, and there are removable studs specifically designed for slippery environments, suitable for most shoes and boots, which can be attached to just the heel or both the heel and sole.)
* The text also emphasizes the importance of deep treads (at least 5mm) and materials that remain flexible in cold temperatures, features commonly found in boots designed for slippery conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 細跟靴 (Heel boots):** The text states that ""鞋跟應低且寬"" (the heel should be low and wide), which is the opposite of a stiletto heel.
* **C: 高跟靴 (High heel boots):** Similar to A, high heels are not suitable for slippery conditions and are specifically discouraged by the text.
* **D: 不具有 1/5 英寸鞋底紋路的靴子 (Boots without 1/5 inch treads):** The text states that the treads should be at least 5mm (1/5 inch).



"
何者無助於改善冬季結冰路面的摩擦力？,"The correct answer is **D: 水 (Water)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that sand, gravel, and salt *increase* friction on icy surfaces.
* Water, on the other hand, can *worsen* the problem. If water freezes, it creates a sheet of ice, which is even more slippery than just ice and snow.  Water doesn't provide friction; it reduces it.

Therefore, water is the option that would *not* help improve friction.
"
關於夏威夷和庫克群島之間的相似之處，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 它們共用相同的時區 (They share the same time zone)**.

Here's why:

* **Q states:** ""Because the islands share the same time zone as Hawaii...""
* **A is incorrect:** The text states that the Cook Islands *remind* some older travelers of pre-development Hawaii, implying it *doesn't* have many large hotels *yet*.
* **B is incorrect:** The text states the Cook Islands are ""free allied with New Zealand,"" meaning they have a degree of autonomy but are not independent nations.  Hawaii is a state of the United States.
* **D is incorrect:** The text explicitly says ""The Cook Islands have no cities, but are composed of fifteen different islands."" Hawaii *does* have cities.



"
關於庫克群島的描述，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 主要城市是拉羅湯加島及艾圖塔基島**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""庫克群島沒有任何城市，而是由十五個不同島嶼組成。主要島嶼是拉羅湯加島及艾圖塔基島。"" This means there are *no* cities in the Cook Islands.  Lãrora Tonga and Aitutaki are major *islands*, not cities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 它比夏威夷小** - The text implies this with ""雖然面積較小，但此處會讓一些年長旅客想起尚未成為美國一州、大型觀光飯店與其他開發案還沒進駐的夏威夷。""
* **B: 它是群島** - The text explicitly states: ""這是由 15 座島嶼組成的群島...""
* **D: 這個島國與夏威夷共用相同時區** - The text states: ""因為群島跟夏威夷同時區...""
"
以下哪個林區管理站提供兩種類型的住宿選項？,"The correct answer is **A: 西雷納 (Cirena)**.

The text states: ""只有西雷納林區管理站提供露營地以外的合宿房與熱食。"" which translates to ""Only the Cirena district management station offers lodging other than camping and hot meals.""
"
根據這段文字，如果你想付現而非使用信用卡付款，你可以在哪裡預訂公園通行證？,"The correct answer is **B: 希門尼斯港**.

The text states: ""您可以直接從希門尼斯港的公園管理處預定通行證，但他們不收信用卡。"" (You can directly reserve a permit from the park administration office in Jimenez Port, but they do not accept credit cards.)

Therefore, Jimenez Port is the only place mentioned where you can pay in cash (since they don't accept credit cards).
"
根據這段文字，哪種滑雪是在更陡峭的地形上進行？,"The correct answer is **A: 滑雪登山 (Ski Mountaineering)**.

The text explicitly states: ""此活動與阿爾卑斯式登山滑雪類似，但通常不涉及高山滑雪與登山，這兩種活動在陡峭地形中進行，需要更堅固的滑雪板和雪靴。"" This translates to: ""This activity is similar to Alpine ski mountaineering, but usually doesn't involve high-altitude skiing and mountaineering. These two activities are done in steep terrain and require more robust skis and boots.""

Therefore, ski mountaineering is the activity performed on steeper terrain.
"
根據這段文字，對於追求更高速度的山岳滑雪者，什麼東西會有幫助？,"The correct answer is **D: 淨空的雪道 (Open powder snow)**.

Here's why:

* The text states ""...你鮮少在淨空雪道上達到無重裝越野滑雪的速度."" This means that on open powder snow, you *won't* achieve the speed of unburdened backcountry skiing.  Therefore, **淨空的雪道** is the thing that *limits* speed.
* The text also contrasts ski touring with high-alpine skiing and mountaineering, which use more robust equipment.  It implies that for higher speeds, you'd want conditions *different* from the more challenging scenarios described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 更堅固的雪靴 (More robust ski boots)**: The text says high-alpine skiing and mountaineering use more robust boots.  Backcountry skiing is *not* typically that demanding.
* **B: 沉重的背包 (Heavy backpack)**: Backcountry skiing involves carrying a backpack, but the text mentions that the distance covered is slightly longer than hiking, but not drastically.  A heavy backpack would *hinder* speed.
* **C: 良好的狀況 (Good condition)**: Good condition helps with distance, but doesn't directly address speed.  The text focuses on the conditions of the snow.



"
經歷逆向文化衝擊的旅客很難做到什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 重新適應國內文化 (Re-adjusting to domestic culture)**.

Here's why:

* The prompt explicitly states that ""對於容易適應新文化的遊客來說，有時重新調整融入自身的本土文化反而特別難。"" (For tourists who easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes particularly difficult to readjust to their own native culture.)
* The prompt focuses on the difficulties faced *after* returning home, after having adapted to a new culture.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 適應新地方的文化 (Adapting to the culture of a new place):** The prompt states that reverse culture shock happens *after* adapting to a new culture, so it's not about the initial adaptation.
* **B: 保持耐心和諒解 (Maintaining patience and understanding):** This describes how people typically react to *incoming* culture shock, not reverse culture shock. The prompt says people are *less likely* to be patient with those experiencing reverse culture shock.
* **C: 出國旅行 (Traveling abroad):** Reverse culture shock is a consequence of *returning* from traveling abroad, not an obstacle to traveling abroad.



"
根據這段文字，逆向文化衝擊對於哪種遊客而言可能特別困難？,"The correct answer is **B: 在國外生活時迅速適應的遊客 (Travelers who adapt quickly to life abroad)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""對於容易適應新文化的遊客來說，有時重新調整融入自身的本土文化反而特別難。"" (For travelers who easily adapt to new cultures, it is sometimes particularly difficult to readjust and integrate into their own native culture.)
* This directly describes the situation of someone who adapts quickly abroad and then faces a difficult readjustment upon returning home, experiencing reverse culture shock.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 經歷過特別難受的文化衝擊的遊客 (Travelers who have experienced particularly difficult culture shock):**  While difficult, this doesn't specifically address the *reverse* culture shock aspect. The passage focuses on the challenges of returning *after* adapting to a new culture.
* **C: 仍處於蜜月期的遊客 (Travelers still in the honeymoon phase):** The passage explicitly mentions that reverse culture shock occurs *after* the initial ""honeymoon"" phase and is characterized by its delayed onset.
* **D: 耐心不足的遊客 (Travelers who lack patience):** The passage discusses how others are often understanding of new arrivals but may not be as understanding of those returning home, but it doesn't directly link this to a lack of patience on the part of the traveler.



"
人們應該避免對駝鹿做以下哪種事情？,"The correct answer is **B: 過度緩慢地靠近 (Approach them too slowly)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states people underestimate elk and get too close, putting themselves at risk.
* Option B directly addresses this by warning against approaching *too slowly*.  While slow and steady might seem safe, it can still be perceived as a non-threatening approach, leading to the elk feeling comfortable and potentially attacking.
* Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:
    * **A: 忽略牠們的存在 (Ignore their presence):**  Ignoring them doesn't prevent a potentially dangerous encounter; it just might not alert the elk to your presence.
    * **C: 將牠們的潛在威脅程度降至最低 (Minimize their potential threat):** This is a general statement and doesn't offer specific preventative advice.
    * **D: 從遠處觀察牠們 (Observe them from a distance):** The passage implies getting *too close* is the problem, not necessarily observing from a distance.


Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the passage.



"
根據這段文字，關於駝鹿的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 牠們是天生就具有攻擊性的動物 (They are naturally aggressive animals)**.

The text explicitly states the opposite: ""駝鹿（常稱為麋鹿）並非天生就具有攻擊性 (Elk (often called moose) are not naturally aggressive).""

Here's why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: 有時人們認為牠們不太可能造成危險 (People sometimes think they are unlikely to pose a threat)** - The text says this directly.
* **C: 牠們可能會因人們靠得太近而發動攻擊 (They might attack if people get too close)** - The text states that people who underestimate the risk can put themselves in danger by getting too close.
* **D: 如有必要，牠們會保護自己 (If necessary, they will protect themselves)** - The text says this directly.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者對沙漠旅客來說最不危險？,"The correct answer is **A: 寒冷的夜晚缺乏保暖的衣服 (Cold nights without warm clothing)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that cold nights are dangerous due to the risk of hypothermia.** This makes option A a real and present danger.
* **The passage describes chasing mirages as dangerous because it wastes energy and water.** Options B, C, and D all relate to this dangerous behavior.

Therefore, the least dangerous thing mentioned is lacking warm clothing on cold nights. While it's a problem, it's not as immediately and directly life-threatening as the other options, which all involve the dangers of chasing mirages.
"
以下何者未被提及為沙漠旅客的潛在威脅？,"The correct answer is **D: 曬傷 (Sunburn)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly mentions:**
    * **Dehydration (缺水):** ""浪費寶貴的能量與剩下的水去追逐海市蜃樓"" implies water scarcity.
    * **Mirages (海市蜃樓):** The entire first sentence focuses on the danger of chasing mirages.
    * **Hypothermia (失溫):** ""即便是最熱的沙漠，夜晚也會變得極冷。若不穿上保暖衣物，就真的會有失溫的風險"" directly states the risk of hypothermia.

* **The passage *does not* mention:**
    * **Sunburn (曬傷):** While sunburn is a common threat in deserts, it's not specifically stated as a danger in this passage. The focus is on water loss, illusions, and cold nights.

Therefore, sunburn is the only option not explicitly mentioned in the text."
根據這段文字，探險家抵達後，哪個群體的人口受到了很大的影響？,"The correct answer is **C: 泰諾人 (Taíno)**.

The text states: ""在歐洲探險家抵達後的短短幾年內，塔伊諾城的人口遭到西班牙征服者大幅地削減。"" (Within a few years of European explorers arriving, the population of the Taíno cities was greatly reduced by Spanish conquerors.)

The text also specifically mentions the massacre of the Taíno people. Therefore, they were the group most significantly impacted by the explorers' arrival.
"
根據這段文字，加勒比人說的是哪種語言？,"The correct answer is **D: 阿拉瓦語**.

The text states: ""加勒比人說的是阿拉瓦語系..."" which translates to ""The Carib people spoke the Arawakan language family...""
"
將滑雪當成娛樂活動推廣一事應歸功於何人？,"The correct answer is **B: 挪威人**.

The passage states: ""山地滑雪運動可以追溯到至少 17 世紀，而1861 年，挪威人在澳洲開設了第一間休閒滑雪俱樂部。"" (Alpine skiing can be traced back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first leisure ski club in Australia.)

This clearly indicates that the Norwegians were instrumental in promoting skiing as a recreational activity. The other options are incorrect:

*   **滑雪迷 (Skiers/Ski fans):** They *participate* in the activity, but didn't *promote* it.
*   **穴居人 (Cave dwellers):** Cave paintings show people skiing, but they didn't promote it.
*   **澳洲人 (Australians):** They benefited from the first ski club, but they didn't initiate the promotion."
根據這段文字，滑雪大約在何時首次被視為一項運動？,"The correct answer is **B: 西元前 5000 年**.

The text states: ""滑雪的概念存在已久，山洞壁畫早在西元前五千年即已描繪了滑雪的人。"" (The concept of skiing has existed for a long time, and cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC depict people skiing.)

While skiing was practiced earlier, the text indicates that the *concept* of skiing (as depicted in art) dates back to 5000 BC. The other options refer to later developments like the 17th century (when mountain skiing could be traced), 1861 (when the first leisure ski club was established), and 18th century (a general timeframe).
"
以下何者通常與東非沿岸最大的島嶼有關？,"The correct answer is **C: 野生動植物 (Wildlife)**.

The passage explicitly states that Madagascar, the largest island in the East African archipelago, is known for its rich wildlife and plants, even calling it ""a continent unto itself."" While the other options are also mentioned in the passage, they are not as directly associated with Madagascar as its wildlife.
"
何者並非較小的東非群島屬性？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 以野生動植物聞名 (Famous for its wildlife)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that **Madagascar is famous for its wildlife** and is often referred to as a continent unto itself due to its biodiversity.
* The other options (A, B, and D) are all characteristics mentioned in the passage as being associated with the smaller islands in the East African archipelago.

Therefore, the question asks for the attribute that is *not* a characteristic of the smaller islands, and the passage indicates that wildlife fame belongs specifically to Madagascar, not the smaller islands as a whole.
"
根據這段文字，某些特別傳統的教堂會如何慶祝復活節？,"The correct answer is **B: 在週六晚上舉辦復活節守夜祈禱會** (Hold a Easter Vigil prayer meeting on Saturday night).

The text explicitly states: ""較傳統的教堂通常會在復活節週末的週六夜晚舉辦一場復活節守夜祈禱會，午夜到來時，參與的信眾會一齊慶祝耶穌的復活。"" (More traditional churches usually hold an Easter Vigil prayer meeting on Saturday night, and at midnight, the participating believers will celebrate the resurrection of Jesus together.)

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 舉行豐收儀式** (Hold a harvest ritual): The text suggests the sunrise watching tradition may predate Christianity and be related to spring and harvest rituals, but it doesn't say traditional churches *hold* harvest rituals.
*   **C: 為信眾會舉辦春季派對** (Hold a spring party for believers): The text doesn't mention any spring parties.
*   **D: 看日出** (Watch the sunrise): While sunrise watching is a tradition, the question asks how *churches* specifically celebrate, and the text focuses on the Easter Vigil prayer meeting.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is B."
為了避免入境厄瓜多時的某些要求，古巴公民必須先擁有什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 自旅行日期起，具有 6 個月以上有效期限的護照**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""此外還需要來回票或前往他地機票，證明你的停留時間。 **你的護照必須擁有 6 個月以上有效期限。**"" (Furthermore, you also need a round-trip ticket or a ticket to another destination, proving your length of stay. **Your passport must be valid for at least 6 months.**)

While options B and C are required, option A is a *necessary* requirement for all Cuban citizens, regardless of whether they have an invitation or a green card.  The other options are conditions to potentially *avoid* some requirements, but the passport validity is a general requirement.

Option D (US Green Card) is only relevant for Cuban citizens holding a US Green Card to obtain an exemption. It's not a general requirement for all Cuban citizens.
"
何者並非厄瓜多旅行要求的規劃目的？,"The correct answer is **A: 將旅客人數降至最低 (To reduce the number of travelers to the minimum)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the goal is to make migration activities more orderly.** This aligns with options B and C (confirming stay duration and passport validity).
* **The requirements (invitation, passport validity, return ticket) are all measures to manage and control the flow of people, not to minimize the number of travelers.**  Reducing the number of travelers is not mentioned as a stated objective.

Therefore, option A is the one that doesn't align with the stated purpose of the travel requirements.
"
以下何者的花費國外比國內更高？,"The correct answer is **B: 高級眼鏡框 (High-end eyeglass frames)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""...真正的進口名牌商品售價可能比原產地更昂貴 (genuine imported branded goods may be more expensive than in the country of origin).""

Let's look at the other options:

* **A: 眼科檢查 (Eye exams):** The text suggests eye exams are cheaper abroad.
* **C: 視力保險 (Vision insurance):** The text suggests it's a good option *if* your insurance covers it, implying it might be cheaper abroad.
* **D: 非名牌眼鏡框 (Non-branded eyeglass frames):**  It's likely non-branded frames would be cheaper abroad, as manufacturing costs are generally lower.



Therefore, only high-end branded frames are specifically mentioned as potentially being *more* expensive abroad.



"
在國外購買高級眼鏡框可能會有什麼風險？,"The correct answer is **C: 眼鏡框可能是仿冒品**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""有些可能是仿冒品，而真正的進口名牌商品售價可能比原產地更昂貴。"" (Some may be fakes, and the genuine imported branded products may be more expensive than the origin.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 可能需要另外的眼科檢查 (May require an additional eye exam):** While this *could* be true, it's not a direct risk *of buying the frames themselves*. The passage focuses on the risk *inherent* in buying in a foreign country.
* **B: 處方可能無法用於某些眼鏡框 (The prescription may not be usable for certain frames):** This is a possibility, but not the primary risk mentioned in the text.  Compatibility is a concern, but counterfeiting is highlighted more strongly.
* **D: 保險可能不給付 (Insurance may not cover):** The passage specifically recommends this practice *if* insurance covers it. This implies it *can* be covered, making this option incorrect.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate risk mentioned in the passage regarding buying high-end frames abroad is the potential for them to be counterfeit.



"
關於福克蘭群島的貨幣使用，以下哪種說法為真？,"The correct answer is **D: 除了福克蘭群島鎊 ，英鎊通常是接受度最高的貨幣**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""群島上各處一般可以接受英鎊..."" (P: Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands...) and ""在史坦利境內也常可以接受信用卡和美元。"" (P: Credit cards and US dollars are often accepted within Stanley.)
* **The text also emphasizes:** ""要在福克蘭群島以外兌換它的貨幣幾乎不可能..."" (P: It is almost impossible to exchange the currency outside of the Falkland Islands...) meaning you need to exchange before you leave.
* **Let's analyze the options:**
    * **A: 外島僅接受信用卡和英鎊** (Outer islands only accept credit cards and British pounds) - This is incorrect. The text says that outer islands *might* accept British and US currencies, but credit cards are unlikely.
    * **B: 史坦利是唯一接受美金的地方** (Stanley is the only place that accepts US dollars) - This is incorrect. The text says that US dollars are *often* accepted in Stanley.
    * **C: 福克蘭群島鎊應在離島後兌換** (Falkland Islands pounds should be exchanged after visiting the outer islands) - This is incorrect. The text stresses the importance of exchanging *before* leaving the Falklands, not after visiting the outer islands.
    * **D: 除了福克蘭群島鎊 ，英鎊通常是接受度最高的貨幣** (Besides Falkland Islands pounds, British pounds are usually the most widely accepted currency) - This is correct. The text clearly states British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands.



Therefore, option D accurately reflects the information provided in the text.
"
根據這段文字，從美國到福克蘭群島旅行時，除了信用卡，其他付款方式在哪裡可能特別有用？,"The correct answer is **A: 福克蘭群島公司西店 (Falkland Islands Company West Building)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""群島上唯一能夠兌換貨幣的地點。 (The only place on the islands where you can exchange currency.)"" and then says it's located ""在「福克蘭群島公司（FIC）西店」的對面 (opposite the Falkland Islands Company (FIC) West Building) in Stanley.""  Therefore, the FIC West Building is the key location for currency exchange.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 遍及所有島嶼 (Widespread throughout the islands):** The text says that outside of Stanley, credit cards are likely not accepted.
* **C: 外島 (Outer islands):**  The text mentions that US dollars *might* be accepted in outer islands, but definitely not credit cards.
* **D: 整個史坦利 (All of Stanley):** While credit cards are sometimes accepted in Stanley, the text highlights the FIC West Building as the primary currency exchange location.



"
哪個事件與廟宇慶典的慶祝活動無關？,"The correct answer is **A: 大象的誕生 (The birth of an elephant)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that temple festivals celebrate:

*   Temple anniversaries (寺廟週年)
*   The birthday of the deity enshrined in the temple (主祀神祉的生日)
*   Other important events related to the temple (或其他與該廟宇相關的重要活動)

The birth of an elephant is not mentioned as a typical reason for temple festivals. While elephants may participate in temple processions, the event of an elephant's birth itself isn't a common celebratory reason for a temple festival.



"
哪裡可以看到佩戴裝飾的大象？,"The correct answer is **C: 寺廟的遊行 (Temple processions)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically states: ""去喀拉拉邦看寺廟慶典挺有意思的，他們定期會有佩戴裝飾的大象遊行..."" (Going to temple festivals in Kerala is quite interesting, they regularly have decorated elephant processions...).  This directly links the decorated elephants to temple processions.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 從十一月底到五月中旬到處可見 (Visible everywhere from late November to mid-May):**  While decorated elephants are visible during that time, the passage connects them specifically to temple processions, not just ""everywhere"".
* **B: 在寺廟裡 (Inside the temples):**  Elephants are part of processions *outside* the temple, not typically inside.
* **D: 在喀拉拉邦的街道上 (On the streets of Kerala):** While processions happen on streets, the specific mention is of *temple* processions.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者是購買商務艙或頭等艙機票最可能的省錢方式？,"The correct answer is **A: 經由您的公司支出 (Having your company pay for it)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""要搭上頭等艙或商務艙，最直接了當的方式，就是拿出厚厚一疊鈔票享受優待（還有更好的方式，那就是讓公司出錢）"" which translates to ""The most direct way to get first class or business class is to pull out a thick wad of cash to enjoy preferential treatment (and a better way is to have your company pay).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 預訂頭等艙而非商務艙 (Booking first class instead of business class):** The text says first class is *more* expensive than business class, not cheaper.
* **C: 預訂頭等艙非直飛航班 (Booking first class on non-direct flights):** The text states that finding discounts on business or first class on *direct* flights is usually futile.
* **D: 尋找優惠 (Looking for discounts):** The text explicitly says trying to find discounts on direct flights is ""徒勞無益"" (fruitless).



"
根據這段文字，在預訂特定票價的艙等時，搜尋什麼會浪費時間？,"The correct answer is **A: 直飛航班 (Direct flights)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Generally speaking, when trying to find deals for business class or first class seats on direct flights from point A to point B is futile."" This means searching for deals on direct flights is a waste of time.
"
在比較非洲的總票價與環球票價時，不需要加上什麼額外費用？,"The correct answer is **B: 非洲離境稅的費用**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""在非洲以外的所有地方，別忘了加上額外的簽證、離境稅和地面交通等額外費用。""  This means that the extra costs mentioned (visa, departure tax, ground transportation) are for *outside* of Africa, not within Africa.  Therefore, the departure tax in Africa is *not* an extra cost to consider when comparing African and global fares.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 非洲以外的地方所需的額外簽證費用:**  This is an extra cost to consider when comparing global and African fares, not when comparing African and global fares.
* **C: 非洲簽證的費用:** This is an extra cost to consider when comparing global and African fares, not when comparing African and global fares.
* **D: 非洲以外的地方所需的地面交通費用:** This is an extra cost to consider when comparing global and African fares, not when comparing African and global fares.



"
根據這段文字，超市開始提供什麼更多樣化的選擇？,"The correct answer is **A: 即食品 (Ready-made foods)**.

The text explicitly states: ""越來越多超市開始提供更多樣化的即食品，部分超市甚至提供微波爐或其他設備以食物加熱。"" which translates to ""More and more supermarkets are starting to offer more diversified ready-made foods, and some supermarkets even provide microwaves or other appliances to heat food.""

While options B and C are mentioned, they are *examples* of what supermarkets are offering alongside the main trend of diversified ready-made food options. Option D, ""實惠的價格"" (affordable prices), is a consequence of the availability of ready-made foods, not the diversification itself.
"
部分超市提供的哪些便利設施可能會吸引購買即食品的顧客？,"The correct answer is **D: 微波爐 (Microwaves)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...部分超市甚至提供微波爐或其他設備以食物加熱。"" (Some supermarkets even offer microwaves or other equipment for heating food.)
* **This directly addresses the question** of what amenities might attract customers buying ready-made meals.  Microwaves are essential for reheating pre-prepared food.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: 附設餐廳 (Attached restaurants):** While restaurants are offered in some stores, the passage says they're ""usually inexpensive and casual,"" not necessarily highlighting them as a key *convenience* that draws people to *ready-made food specifically*. They're more of an alternative dining option.
    * **B: 較少變化的選擇 (Less varied selection):**  The passage says the opposite - that supermarkets are offering *more* diverse ready-made options.
    * **C: 生食 (Fresh food):** The passage is focused on *ready-made* meals, not fresh ingredients.

Therefore, the microwave is the most direct and logical answer based on the provided text.
"
講法語的比利時人和瑞士人可能聽不懂以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 奇特的法文單字**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Belgian and Swiss French have ""奇特的法文單字"" (peculiar French words) in their counting systems and pronunciation.
* While they learn standard French in school, the passage highlights the differences, implying these peculiar words would be the most likely point of misunderstanding.
* They *can* understand standard French (the passage states they learn it), and some pronunciation differences are minor.
* While France has its own variations, the passage focuses on the differences *between* Belgian/Swiss French and French French, not specifically what French French speakers might *not* understand.

Therefore, the ""奇特的法文單字"" are the most likely to cause a problem.
"
以下何者在法國與在比利時或瑞士不同？,"The correct answer is **B: 記數系統**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the counting systems in the Belgian French-speaking region and Switzerland are ""peculiar"" and different from the French counting system.
* The passage mentions that while pronunciation and vocabulary might have minor differences, all French speakers in Belgium and Switzerland learn standard French in school to ensure mutual understanding.
* While pronunciation (A) and some word spellings (D) might vary, the passage doesn't emphasize them as key differences. The counting system (B) is the most directly stated difference.
* The passage clearly states that standard French (C) is *taught* in schools to bridge the differences, indicating it's not a difference *between* France and Belgium/Switzerland.



"
哪種情況您不太可能得到喪親票價？,"The correct answer is **B: 如果您嘗試直接透過航空公司而非第三方服務訂票**.

Here's why:

The prompt explicitly states: **""不論任何情況，都必須打電話直接跟航空公司訂位。""** This means you *must* contact the airline directly to book a bereavement fare. Options A, C, and D all describe scenarios where a bereavement fare *might* be available (even if the prompt notes it's limited). Option B describes an action that *prevents* you from getting a bereavement fare, regardless of the airline.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is B.
"
關於喪親票價，何者為真？,"The correct answer is **D: 必須直接打電話向航空公司預訂 (You must book directly with the airline)**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text explicitly states:** ""不論任何情況，都必須打電話直接跟航空公司訂位。(In any case, you must book directly with the airline.)""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 票價包含支付葬禮旅行的費用 (The ticket includes payment for funeral travel costs):** The text says the fares offer a ""些微折扣 (slight discount)"" for temporary funeral travel, not that they *include* the cost of the funeral itself.
* **B: 必須直接在航空公司的網站上預訂 (You must book directly on the airline's website):** The text clearly states you must book by phone, not online.
* **C: 票價包含了最後限時機票的旅費 (The ticket includes the fare for last-minute flights):** While the fares are for temporary travel, the text doesn't specify they are for last-minute flights, only travel related to a death.



"
何時使用獨立的 GPS 設備比 GPS 導航應用程式更方便？,"The correct answer is **C: 超出連線範圍時 (When you are outside of data coverage)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that GPS navigation apps can be limited or unusable when you lack data connection.
* An independent GPS device doesn't rely on cellular data, so it continues to function even without a data connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 想省錢時 (When you want to save money):** The passage states renting maps from a rental company is cheaper than buying new maps or a separate GPS unit.  Therefore, using a phone app *can* be cheaper.
* **B: 確定會有數據連線時 (When you are sure there will be data coverage):** If you have data coverage, a phone app is likely perfectly fine and may even offer more features than a basic GPS device.
* **D: 不想租用 GPS 設備時 (When you don't want to rent a GPS device):** This is a preference, not a functional reason.  The question asks when a *GPS device* is *more convenient*.



Therefore, option C is the only one that directly addresses a situation where a dedicated GPS device is *more* convenient than a phone-based GPS navigation app.
"
與獨立設備相比，何者並非使用 GPS 導航應用程式的好理由？,"The correct answer is **A: 無需擔心數據連線 (Don't worry about data connection)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""如果你的手機沒有數據連線，或者已經超出連線範圍，GPS 導航的表現可能會受到限制或無法使用。"" (If your phone doesn't have a data connection, or has already exceeded the range, GPS navigation performance may be limited or unavailable.)

Let's look at why the other options *are* good reasons:

* **B: 省錢 (Save money):** The passage directly states that renting maps from a rental car company is cheaper than buying new GPS maps or a separate GPS device.
* **C: 避免租賃 (Avoid renting):** The passage implies this by contrasting renting maps with buying new maps or using a dedicated GPS device.
* **D: 無需購買新地圖 (No need to buy new maps):** Renting maps avoids the need to buy them.

Therefore, the only option that contradicts the passage's information is that you don't have to worry about a data connection.  The passage highlights the importance of data connection for GPS navigation.
"
根據這段文字，您如何保證您配到一艘適合的船？,"The correct answer is **C: 與身為加拉巴哥群島旅行專家的旅行社預訂 (Book with a travel agency that specializes in the Galapagos Islands)**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""確保幫您預訂的旅行社是加拉巴哥群島的專家，並擁有對各種船隻的廣泛知識。這將確保您的特定興趣和/或限制會與最適合它們的船隻相符。"" (Make sure the travel agency you book with is an expert in the Galapagos Islands and has extensive knowledge of various ships. This will ensure your specific interests and/or limitations match the most suitable vessels.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 訂購有 8+ 興趣相似的乘客所組團的船票 (Book a ship with 8+ passengers who share similar interests)** - The text doesn't mention this as a way to ensure a suitable ship.
* **B: 淡季預訂位 (Book during the off-season)** - While booking during the off-season might be easier, it doesn't guarantee you'll find a ship that fits your specific needs and interests. The text emphasizes expertise in choosing the *right* ship.
* **D: 提前訂位 (Book in advance)** -  The text mentions that advance booking is necessary, but it's the *expertise* of the travel agency that ensures you get a *suitable* ship, not just the advance booking itself.

Therefore, option C directly addresses the solution presented in the text.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者並非用來讓賓客不斷賭博的策略？,"The correct answer is **A: 充足的自然光線 (Ample natural light)**.

Here's why:

* The passage describes how casinos use tactics to keep people gambling longer and spending more.
* **Ample natural light** is the *opposite* of what a casino would want. Natural light helps people perceive time and the outside world, making them more aware of how much time they're spending gambling.  Casinos actively avoid this.

Let's look at why the other options *are* strategies used:

* **B: 免費音樂會門票等鼓勵措施 (Free concert tickets and other incentives)**: This is a tactic to keep people entertained and feeling good, encouraging them to stay.
* **C: 免費飲料 (Free drinks)**: This lowers inhibitions, encourages spending, and keeps people from leaving.
* **D: 沒有時鐘 (No clocks)**: This makes it difficult for people to track time, leading them to lose track of how long they've been gambling.



Therefore, only ample natural light is directly counter to the casino's goal of encouraging continued gambling."
根據這段文字，聰明的賭徒應該避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 飲酒過量 (Drinking too much)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""不過喝醉酒可是會削減判斷力，好的賭徒都很清楚保持清醒的重要性。"" which translates to ""However, getting drunk impairs judgment, and good gamblers are well aware of the importance of staying sober.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 接受任何鼓勵措施 (Accepting any enticements):** The passage mentions the casino offers meals, drinks, and entertainment. While these are tactics to keep people there, the passage doesn't say a smart gambler should avoid *all* enticements. The focus is on *staying sober* despite them.
* **C: 檢查時鐘或手錶 (Checking the clock or watch):** The passage says there are no clocks, but it doesn't say you should *avoid* checking the time.
* **D: 詢問最近的出口 (Asking about the nearest exit):**  The passage says it's difficult to find exits, but it doesn't say you should avoid asking about them. In fact, knowing where exits are would be smart for safety.



"
根據這段文字，句子中哪個詞性會大寫？,"The correct answer is **B: 名詞 (Nouns)**.

The text explicitly states: ""所有名詞以及 Sie （意思為'您'）一詞，即使在句子中間出現，仍然會以大寫字母開頭。"" (All nouns and the word Sie (meaning 'you') will always start with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.)

The passage also mentions that capitalization of nouns and Sie is important for distinguishing them from verbs and adjectives. Therefore, nouns are the part of speech that will be capitalized.
"
根據這段文字，名詞大寫會讓什麼事更困難？,"The correct answer is **C: 寫作 (Writing)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""這或許也使閱讀變得更加容易，但由於需要確認名詞化的形式中應使用動詞或形容詞，寫作變得有點複雜。""  This translates to: ""This might also make reading easier, but because it is necessary to check whether a nominalized form should use a verb or an adjective, writing becomes a bit complicated.""

Therefore, capitalizing nouns makes writing more complex.
"
在馬來西亞鄉下地區，哪個手勢代表「過來」？,"The correct answer is **A: 彎食指 (Bend the index finger)**.

The question states that in rural Malaysia, a bent index finger is used to mean ""come here."" The text explicitly connects this gesture to the meaning of ""come here."" While waving is generally ""hello,"" in this specific context, it's not the ""come here"" signal.
"
根據這段文字，哪個手勢可能代表「回來」？,"The correct answer is **C: 手掌朝外的揮手 (Wave with palm facing outwards)**.

The text states that in Spain, a British traveler might misunderstand a wave with the palm facing the person waving *at* them (rather than at the person being said goodbye to) as meaning ""come back."" Therefore, a wave with the palm facing *outwards* is associated with the idea of ""returning"" in that context.
"
根據這段文字，什麼狀況會導致隙縫發生？,"The correct answer is **B: 不穩定的冰河 (Unstable glaciers)**.

The text explicitly states: ""冰河並不穩定，而是會順著山脈流下。這種狀況會導致冰體斷裂或有隙縫..."" (Glaciers are not stable, but flow down mountains. This condition causes the ice mass to fracture or have cracks...).

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 雪橋 (Snow bridges)**: Snow bridges might *cover* cracks, but they don't *cause* them.
* **C: 坍塌的冰穴 (Collapsed ice caves)**: Collapsed ice caves might *affect* the glacier, but the text doesn't directly link them to the formation of cracks.
* **D: 鬆動的冰塊 (Loose ice blocks)**: Loose ice blocks are related to the glacier's edge, not directly to the formation of cracks *within* the ice mass.
"
根據這段文字，哪些東西會被雪橋遮蓋？,"The correct answer is **A: 隙縫 (Cracks)**.

The text states: ""這種狀況會導致冰體斷裂或有隙縫，但可能會被雪橋掩蓋。"" which translates to: ""This situation will cause the ice to fracture or have cracks, but they may be covered by snow bridges.""

Therefore, the cracks are what might be covered by snow bridges.
"
根據這段文字，旅客到訪哪個地點之前應採取額外的預防措施？,"The correct answer is **B: 戈馬周邊地區**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""雖然戈馬還算安全，但若要到戈馬以外地區旅遊，就必須做足功課，瞭解北基伍省持續的戰亂狀況。"" (Although Goma is relatively safe, if you want to travel to areas outside of Goma, you must do your homework and understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu.) This directly points to the need for precautions when traveling *outside* of Goma, which is the surrounding areas.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 尼拉貢戈火山** - The text mentions it as a base for gorilla tracking, not as a place requiring extra precautions *before* visiting Goma.
* **C: 市中心** - The city center was destroyed in 2002, and while it might still be unsafe in some respects, the text doesn't specifically highlight it as requiring *additional* precautions beyond the general safety concerns of the region.
* **D: 盧安達** - The text only mentions Rwanda as a neighboring city, and provides no information about requiring special precautions to visit it.



"
對戈馬的遊客來說，以下何者並非好意見？,"The correct answer is **A: 北基伍省的戰亂很好玩 (The war in North Kivu is fun)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that visitors need to ""do their homework"" and understand the ongoing conflict in North Kivu before traveling beyond Goma.  Saying the war is ""fun"" is completely inappropriate and disregards the serious dangers.
* Options B, C, and D are all facts mentioned in the passage as positive aspects of visiting Goma.

Therefore, option A is the *opposite* of good advice.
"
8 月 1 日的野地許可證何時可用？,"The correct answer is **A: 1 月 1 日**.

The passage states: ""每月 1 號可申請四個月後的起程月許可證.""  Since you want a permit for August (which is four months after April), you apply on January 1st.
"
為了保護峽谷而實行了什麼政策？,"The correct answer is **D: 許可證的數量有限 (The number of permits is limited)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""為了保護峽谷，許可證的數量有限..."" (To protect the canyon, the number of permits is limited...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 先到先得的許可證制度 (First-come, first-served permit system)** - While true, this is a *result* of the policy, not the policy itself. The policy is the limited availability.
* **B: 許可證僅在 1 月 1 日可申請 (Permits are only available to apply on January 1st)** - This refers to *when* permits are available, not the core protective policy.
* **C: 許可證僅能現場登記取得 (Permits can only be obtained on-site)** - This refers to how you *get* a permit, not why the policy exists.

Therefore, **D** directly addresses the policy regarding canyon protection.
"
在文中所述的飯店類型中，最不可能找到以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 近期經過現代升級翻修的客房 (Recently renovated guest rooms)**.

Here's why: The passage emphasizes the ""overtime hardware,"" ""lack of new appliance facilities,"" and ""unique elegance of the era."" These descriptions explicitly point to older, non-renovated rooms.  The other options are all consistent with the description of luxurious hotels of that era:

* **A: 雞尾酒吧 (Cocktail bar):**  High-end hotels in the early 20th century almost certainly had cocktail bars.
* **B: 飯店附設的美食餐廳 (On-site fine dining restaurant):** The passage states they offer ""高級的餐點 (fine dining),"" implying restaurants.
* **C: 知名或一眼就能認出的其他客人 (Famous or instantly recognizable other guests):** The passage mentions hosting ""來訪的國家元首和其他達官顯貴 (visiting heads of state and other dignitaries),"" suggesting you might encounter famous people.



Therefore, recently renovated rooms are the *least* likely to be found in these historic hotels.



"
根據段落所提供的資訊，飯店客人最不可能優先考慮以下哪些設施？,"The correct answer is **D: 實惠的房價 (Affordable room prices)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that these hotels are frequented by ""wealthy travelers"" and were the haunt of ""the rich and famous."" The description highlights ""高級的餐點 (high-class dining)"" and ""夜生活 (nightlife)"" as features.  The overall tone emphasizes luxury and historical significance.

Therefore, **affordable room prices** are the least likely consideration for the target clientele of these hotels.  The other options align with the description:

*   **A: 遍布飯店的古董傢俱 (Antique furniture throughout the hotel):**  This directly relates to the ""特有的優雅年代感 (unique elegance of the era)"" mentioned.
*   **B: 擁有傑出廚師的餐廳 (A restaurant with an excellent chef):** The passage mentions ""高級的餐點 (high-class dining)"".
*   **C: 提供夜間娛樂的酒吧 (A bar offering nightlife):** The passage mentions ""夜生活 (nightlife)"".



"
根據這段文字，前往格陵蘭島的旅客應該避免什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 將格陵蘭島原住民稱為「愛斯基摩人」 (Referring to Greenlanders as ""Eskimos"")**.

The text explicitly states: ""儘管你可能聽過格陵蘭島原住民使用這個詞，但外國人應該避免使用。"" (Although you may have heard Greenlanders use the term, foreigners should avoid using it.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 以高犯罪率而聞名的特定地區 (Specific areas known for high crime rates):** The text states ""即使是鬧區也沒有「危險地帶」 (Even busy areas don't have ""dangerous areas"").
* **B: 帶上厚重的衣服，因為氣候全年溫暖 (Bring heavy clothes because the climate is warm year-round):** The text says, ""如果在寒冷季節造訪格陵蘭島（愈往北走，天氣愈冷），一定要攜帶足以保暖的衣物 (If you visit Greenland in the cold season (the further north you go, the colder it gets), be sure to bring warm clothing).""
* **C: 以為能在那裡工作，因為網路連線可能不穩定 (Think you can work there because internet connections might be unstable):** The text actually says the internet is *reliable* (""根據這段文字，前往格陵蘭島的旅客應該避免什麼事情？"" is a trick question, and the answer isn't about avoiding something that's not mentioned.)



"
根據這段文字，以下何者最有可能對毫無準備就到訪格陵蘭島的旅客造成問題？,"The correct answer is **C: 天氣 (Weather)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""毫無準備的人唯一真正會遭遇的危險，也許就只有寒冷的天氣了。 如果你在寒冷季節造訪格陵蘭島（愈往北走，天氣愈冷），一定要攜帶足以保暖的衣物。"" (The only real danger for an unprepared person might just be the cold weather. If you visit Greenland during the cold season (the further north you go, the colder the weather), be sure to bring warm enough clothes.)

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: 北歐蚊子 (North European Mosquitoes):** While mentioned, the passage clarifies that mosquitoes are only annoying and don't transmit diseases.
* **B: 犯罪 (Crime):** The passage states that crime is virtually unheard of in Greenland.
* **D: 當地人 (Locals):** The passage explains the correct terms to use for locals and emphasizes that locals are generally welcoming.

Therefore, the passage highlights **weather** as the most likely issue for unprepared travelers.
"
以下何者現在當作中央廣場使用？,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text states: ""如今此空間被當作中央廣場，不論日夜都十分熱鬧。"" which translates to ""Today this space is used as a central square, bustling day and night."" This directly refers to Jardín de la Unión.
"
根據這段文字，在 Jardín de la Unión 中找不到以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 古老的修道院建築 (Ancient monastery buildings)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Templo de san Diego is *one of the few remaining* buildings from the 17th-century monastery that built Jardín de la Unión.  This implies that the monastery buildings are not fully present or readily visible.
* The passage confirms the presence of a central pavilion where free concerts are held (A).
* It clearly states Callejon del Beso is the birthplace of an ancient love story (B).
* The passage mentions restaurants surrounding the garden (C).

Therefore, while the garden originated from a monastery, the passage indicates that the actual monastery buildings are no longer prominent or easily found within Jardín de la Unión.
"
根據這段文字，關於單日健行的說法中，以下何者會被認為不正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 單日健行這樣的戶外活動不適合有嬰兒的家庭 (Single-day hiking activities like this are not suitable for families with infants.)**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""帶著嬰兒或是學齡前兒童，戶外一日遊也可以簡單達成 (Even with infants or preschoolers, outdoor day trips can be easily achieved)."" This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: 輕鬆小徑的一日健行不必做太多準備 (Easy trails for day hikes don't require much preparation):** The text says ""輕鬆小徑的一日健行，不必做太多準備 (Easy day hikes don't require much preparation).""
* **B: 距離或有不同，但皆可於一天內完成 (Distances vary, but can all be completed in a day):** The text defines single-day hiking as ""一英里以下或更長距離的單日行程 (Day trips of one mile or longer)."" This indicates varying distances that can be completed in a day.
* **C: 體能適中的人通常都能享受這項活動 (People of moderate fitness can usually enjoy this activity):** The text states ""任何體能適中的人都能享受這樣的健行 (Anyone with moderate fitness can enjoy this hiking).""



Therefore, the only incorrect statement is D."
根據這段文字，單日健行何時需要最低程度的準備？,"The correct answer is **B: 涉及更輕鬆的步道時 (When involving easier trails)**.

The text explicitly states: ""輕鬆小徑的一日健行，不必做太多準備，任何體能適中的人都能享受這樣的健行。"" This translates to: ""Easy trail day hikes don't require much preparation, and anyone with moderate fitness can enjoy them.""

Therefore, easier trails require the *least* amount of preparation.
"
與挪威其他地區相比，羅加蘭或阿格德爾的高原有何不同？,"The correct answer is **D: 它們通常佈滿石南花 (They are usually covered with heather)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""hei"" in Rogaland and Agder often means ""treeless wilderness usually covered with heather.""
* Option A is incorrect because the passage describes ""vidde"" as treeless.
* Option B is incorrect because the passage describes the typical Norwegian landscape as having fjords and valleys *adjacent to* plateaus.
* Option C is partially correct (plateaus are generally flat), but it doesn't capture the unique characteristic mentioned in the passage - the heather.



"
根據這段文字，對挪威來說，以下何者並非典型的風景？,"The correct answer is **B: 森林茂密的高原 (Forest-covered plateaus)**.

The text explicitly states that ""vidde"" (and ""hei"") are described as *treeless* spaces. Therefore, forest-covered plateaus are the opposite of what is considered typical Norwegian scenery according to the text. The other options (open land, steep fjords, and wilderness) are all mentioned as characteristic features.
"
對滑雪有興趣的遊客應何時到訪山間小鎮？,"The correct answer is **A: 冬季期間**.

The passage explicitly states that many hill towns get a lot of snow in winter and offer skiing and snowboarding. Therefore, visitors interested in skiing should visit during the winter.
"
根據這段文字，山間小鎮通常何時遊客最多？,"The correct answer is **C: 印度的夏季期間**.

The text explicitly states: ""避暑勝地的旅遊季節，通常在印度的夏季期間達到頂峰。"" which translates to ""The peak tourist season for hill stations is usually during the summer in India.""

While the text mentions winter's beauty and activities like skiing, it also clearly states the summer is the peak season. Therefore, option C is the direct answer.
"
如果希望找到尋求幫助的船，應該避免做什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 忽略其他搭便船的人**.

Here's why:

The prompt explicitly states you need to interact with other passengers and people at the docks to find opportunities to help. Ignoring them goes against the instructions and would hinder your ability to gather information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在碼頭走來走來 (Walking around the docks):** The prompt says this is something you *should* do.
* **B: 與船長交朋友 (Becoming friends with captains):** While beneficial, the prompt doesn't say to prioritize befriending captains *specifically*. It emphasizes general interaction.
* **C: 宣傳您的服務 (Advertising your services):** While the prompt suggests posting a notice, it doesn't discourage further proactive engagement.  It's not inherently bad to mention what you can do.



"
在尋找需要幫助的船時，應該在碼頭周圍做什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 與船員攀談 (Chat with the crew)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""...試著與酒吧裡的船員攀談等。盡量與越多人交談越好."" (Try chatting with the crew in the bar, etc. Try to talk to as many people as possible.)

While approaching yacht owners while they're washing their boats (C) is mentioned, the text emphasizes talking to a broader range of people, including crew members. Option B is the opposite of what the text suggests. Option D is also incorrect as the text encourages interaction with other passengers.



"
何處會吸引對島上殖民歷史感興趣的遊客？,"The correct answer is **A: 北部沿岸**.

The passage states: ""英國殖民者把這裡據為已有，因此如果想在這片土地上尋找殖民歷史的證據，這裡是個不錯的起點。"" (The British colonizers took possession of this place, so if you want to find evidence of colonial history here, this is a good starting point.)  This refers to the northern waterfront of Hong Kong Island."
何處會吸引優先考慮壯麗景色的遊客？,"The correct answer is **D: 九龍海濱**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""若要欣賞香港最好的景色，你可以離開香港島並前往對岸的九龍海濱。"" (To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, you can leave Hong Kong Island and go to the Kowloon waterfront.)

While Victoria Harbour (A) is mentioned as a beautiful setting, the passage explicitly directs visitors to Kowloon Waterfront (D) for the best views. Option B is too general, and Option C (Hong Kong Island) is mentioned as having urban development but not necessarily the *best* views overall.



"
有些馬鞍具備什麼東西，有助減少騎士的腳被馬鐙卡住的風險？,"The correct answer is **B: 安全手把 (Safety hand holds)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""有些馬鞍 (尤其英式馬鞍) 具備安全手把，騎乘者墜馬時往後拉，就可讓馬蹬上的皮帶從馬鞍上脫落。"" (Some saddles (especially English saddles) have safety hand holds, which, when the rider pulls back, allows the straps on the stirrups to release from the saddle.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 狹窄的鞋底 (Narrow soles):** While narrow soles are mentioned as a safety precaution, they don't directly address the risk of feet getting trapped in the stirrups.
* **C: 馬蹬上的皮帶 (Straps on the stirrups):** The passage mentions straps *on* the stirrups, but it's the *release mechanism* of those straps that's the safety feature.
* **D: 更高的穩定性 (Greater stability):** While stirrups *do* provide stability, the question asks about something *reducing* the risk of getting trapped. Greater stability could even *increase* the risk if a foot is trapped.



"
使用馬鐙時，馬靴的哪些功能有助於提高騎士的安全性？,"The correct answer is **C: 鞋跟**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that most riders wear **heeled boots with smooth, narrow soles**.  The heel is specifically mentioned as a safety feature because it helps prevent the foot from getting caught in the stirrup if a fall occurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 粗糙狹窄的鞋底 (Rough, narrow sole):** The passage mentions smooth soles, not rough ones.
* **B: 皮帶 (Strap):** While straps are part of the overall stirrup system, the question asks about the function of the boots themselves.
* **D: 寬大的鞋底 (Wide sole):** The passage specifies narrow soles, not wide soles.
"
住宿交換網站能為旅客提供什麼服務？,"The correct answer is **A: 與當地房東的住宿 (Accommodation with local hosts)**.

The text explicitly states that accommodation exchange websites connect travelers with locals who offer their homes.  While the story mentions cheap flights, that's not the primary service of the website itself.  The other options (local guides, transferring with other travelers) aren't mentioned in the text.
"
根據這段文字，關於住宿交換網站的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 總會提供旅客當地房東的參考資料 (Always provide travelers with reference materials of local landlords)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""可供選擇的房東列表會以紙本或線上方式提供，偶爾還會附有其他旅客留下的推薦和評價。"" (Lists of available landlords are provided in paper or online form, sometimes accompanied by recommendations and reviews left by other travelers.) This implies that not *all* websites necessarily provide reference materials, just that some do.
* **The text explicitly states:** ""雖然有些網路會提供或需要額外的驗證。"" (Although some networks may provide or require additional verification.) This confirms option B is true.
* **The text explicitly states:** ""可供選擇的房東列表會以紙本或線上方式提供..."" (Lists of available landlords are provided in paper or online form...) This confirms option C is true.
* **The text states:** ""...偶爾還會附有其他旅客留下的推薦和評價。"" (...sometimes accompanied by recommendations and reviews left by other travelers.) This confirms option D is true.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that is *not* supported by the text.
"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的房客最不可能在青年旅館宿舍房中找到？,"The correct answer is **C: 帶小孩旅行的房客 (Families traveling with children)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""帶著小孩的家庭極為少見，但有些青年旅館確實會允許他們入住私人套房 (Families traveling with children are extremely rare, but some hostels do allow them to stay in private suites).""

This means families with children are *uncommon* and typically not found in the standard dorm rooms.  The other options are all types of people who *are* commonly found in hostels.
"
根據這段文字，誰最有可能住在青年旅館？,"The correct answer is **B: 三個 22 歲一起旅行的年輕人**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""青年旅社的主要客群是年輕人，典型房客是 20 來歲的年輕人..."" (Hostels' main customer base is young people, the typical guest is a young person in their 20s...).
* Option B directly aligns with this description.
* Options A, C, and D are all explicitly ruled out or highly unlikely by the passage.

Therefore, B is the most logical and accurate answer.
"
根據這段文字，關於迴力鏢投擲的描述，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **D: 只有部分迴力鏢能夠飛回來 (Only some boomerangs fly back.)**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""如果你想學習如何讓迴力鏢丟出後回到你手上，請確定你有適合飛回來的迴力鏢。 大部分澳洲的迴力鏢其實是不會飛回來的。"" (If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that comes back to you, make sure you have a boomerang that is suitable for returning. Most Australian boomerangs actually do not come back.) This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 如果正確投擲，它一定會回到你的手中 (If thrown correctly, it will definitely return to your hand.)** The text implies that *not all* boomerangs return, and even with correct throwing, it's not guaranteed.
* **B: 比起遊客，它在當地人之間更熱門 (It is more popular among locals than tourists.)** The text mentions that boomerang throwing is a popular skill for *tourists* who want to learn it. It doesn't provide information about local popularity.
* **C: 澳洲能買迴力鏢的地方並不多 (There are not many places to buy boomerangs in Australia.)** The text doesn't mention the availability of boomerangs in Australia.



"
爪哇美食主要使用以下哪一種調味料？,"The correct answer is **C: 椰子糖 (Palm sugar)**.

The text explicitly states: ""最常使用的調味品是花生、辣椒、**糖（尤其是爪哇椰子糖）**和各種香氣濃郁的香料。"" which translates to ""The most commonly used seasonings are peanuts, chili, **sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar)** and various fragrant spices.""
"
根據這段文字，傳染病是如何傳播的？,"The correct answer is **A: 受感染者 (Infected person)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""傳染病是人在受感染者附近便容易被傳播的疾病"" which translates to ""Contagious diseases are diseases that are easily spread when people are near an infected person.""

While the other options are related to infectious diseases, the text specifically points to the **infected person** as the source of transmission.
"
根據這段文字，何者並非導致傳染病的原因？,"The correct answer is **A: 疫苗 (Vaccines)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens like **viruses, bacteria, fungi, or parasites.**
* **Vaccines** are used to *prevent* infectious diseases, not cause them. They work by training the immune system to fight off specific pathogens.

Therefore, vaccines are not a cause of infectious diseases, unlike viruses, bacteria, and fungi.
"
在哪種情況下，對使用者來說，選擇網路代理伺服器而非個人 VPN 供應商就足夠了？,"The correct answer is **C: 使用者主要重新路由 HTTP 流量** (Users primarily need to route HTTP traffic).

Here's why:

* **The prompt states a key advantage of VPNs is routing *all* network traffic.** This makes options A and B incorrect.
* **Option D (Moderate to high bandwidth needs) is generally a VPN benefit, but not the defining reason to choose a proxy.**  While VPNs often offer better bandwidth, proxies can suffice for moderate use.
* **Option C directly addresses the core difference highlighted in the prompt.**  If a user *only* needs to bypass filtering for HTTP traffic (e.g., accessing a specific website), a proxy server is sufficient.  They don't need the broader protection and encryption that a VPN provides.



Therefore, the only scenario where a proxy is *enough* is when the user's needs are limited to routing just HTTP traffic."
根據這段文字，關於 VPN 和網路代理伺服器的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: VPN 只能重新路由 HTTP 流量**.

The text explicitly states: ""它們能重新導向**所有**網路流量，而非只有 http 的流量。"" (They can redirect **all** network traffic, not just HTTP traffic.) This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: 通常 VPN 提供的頻寬比網路代理伺服器更高:** The text says VPNs ""通常會提供更高的頻寬"" (usually offer higher bandwidth).
* **B: 網路代理伺服器無法重新路由所有網路流量:** The text states VPNs can redirect all traffic, implying proxies cannot.
* **C: 與 VPN 相比，網路代理伺服器的服務品質較低落:** The text says VPNs ""通常會提供更好的服務品質"" (usually offer better service quality).



Therefore, only option D is incorrect based on the provided text.
"
何者讓人們可以使用所在地區以外的電話公司？,"The correct answer is **A: 透過網際網路傳訊的通話 (Calls made through internet messaging)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the core reason:** The passage explicitly says, ""由於通話是透過網際網路傳訊的，不需要用到住處或到訪處的電話公司。"" (Because calls are made through internet messaging, you don't need to use the phone company of the residence or the visiting place.) This is the fundamental point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 國際電話號碼 (International phone numbers):**  The passage mentions the *need* for different international numbers to reach PSTN phones, but it's the internet messaging that *enables* calling from a different location. It's a consequence, not the primary driver.
* **C: 衛星 (Satellites):** While satellites *can* provide internet connectivity, the passage focuses on the internet messaging aspect, not the satellite technology itself.
* **D: PSTN 電話 (PSTN phones):**  PSTN (Public Switched Telephone Network) is the traditional phone network.  The passage discusses the issue of reaching PSTN phones from a different location, but not the PSTN itself.



Therefore, the ability to use a phone company outside your actual location comes from making calls via the internet.



"
根據這段文字，某些電話可能需要做什麼事情才可以接聽？,"The correct answer is **A: 購買國際電話號碼 (Purchase an international phone number)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Commonly, you need to purchase different international phone numbers to receive PSTN calls."" This directly answers the question of what's needed to receive calls.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 使用本地電話公司 (Use a local phone company):** The text says you *don't* need to use a local phone company.
* **C: 擁有當地社區的電話號碼 (Own a local community phone number):** The text states you don't need a local phone number where you are physically located.
* **D: 購買 PSTN 手機 (Purchase a PSTN phone):** The text refers to receiving PSTN calls, but doesn't suggest you need to buy a special PSTN phone. It's the *phone number* that matters.
"
關於義大利文單字發音的描述，以下何者不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **C: 有字母 c 和 g 的單字可能會很難 (Words with the letters c and g might be difficult.)**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the pronunciation of 'c' and 'g' *depends* on the following vowel, but it also indicates that these are the *main* things to watch out for, not inherently difficult.  The passage positions them as requiring careful attention, but not as making words generally difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 雙 r 發音與單 r 發音不同 (The pronunciation of double 'r' is different from single 'r')** - The passage states ""務必以不同的方式發音 r 和 rr (Be sure to pronounce r and rr in different ways).""
* **B: 大多數單字的拼法與讀音一模一樣 (Most words have the same spelling and pronunciation)** - The passage states ""義大利文的發音相對簡單，畢竟多數單字的拼法與讀音一模一樣 (Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, because most words have the same spelling and pronunciation).""
* **D: 大多數單字的發音會根據其後的母音而定 (The pronunciation of most words depends on the vowel that follows them)** - The passage says ""主要需要留意的字母是 c 和 g，因為它們的發音會根據其後的母音而產生變化 (The letters to mainly pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation changes according to the vowel that follows them).""

Therefore, the best answer is **C**.
"
以下哪些伊茲密爾的特色源於現代之前？,"The correct answer is **D: 紅瓦屋頂**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that traditional red-tiled roofs are a characteristic of Izmir's historical architecture, referencing its past as the ancient city of Smyrna.
* The passage mentions modern elements like wide boulevards, glass curtain walls, and shopping malls as newer additions.

Therefore, red-tiled roofs are the only option that directly points to Izmir's characteristics *before* the modern era.
"
關於伊茲密爾的特色，以下何者不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **B: 能反映傳統土耳其的氛圍** (Reflects a traditional Turkish atmosphere).

The text explicitly states the opposite: ""儘管這座城市相較於傳統土耳其，地中海歐洲的氛圍更加濃厚。"" (Although this city is more Mediterranean European in atmosphere than traditional Turkey.)

Here's why the other options are correct:

* **A: 城市環繞著一個大海灣 (The city is surrounded by a bay):** The text says it's located by a large bay.
* **C: 您可以找到現代購物中心和古老的教堂 (You can find modern shopping centers and ancient churches):** The text mentions both modern shopping centers *and* old churches and mosques.
* **D: 它擁有土耳其第二大港口 (It has Turkey's second largest port):**  The text directly states this.



Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
「花見」這個詞指的是觀賞什麼事物？,"The correct answer is **A: 櫻花 (Sakura)**.

The text states that ""賞櫻，又稱為「花見」，從西元 8 世紀起就是日本文化的一環。 這種觀念來自中國，而中國人賞的是梅花。 在日本，最早的櫻花祭是天皇專為自己和皇宮周邊其他貴族所辦的。"" which translates to ""Cherry blossom viewing, also known as 'hanami', has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century. This concept originated from China, where people admired plum blossoms. In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom festivals were held exclusively for the Emperor and the nobles around the Imperial Palace.""

Therefore, ""花見"" (hanami) refers to the viewing of cherry blossoms (櫻花).
"
是誰舉辦了第一次專門賞櫻的派對？,"The correct answer is **C: 日本天皇 (Japanese Emperor)**.

The text explicitly states: ""在日本，最早的櫻花祭是天皇專為自己和皇宮周邊其他貴族所辦的。"" which translates to ""In Japan, the earliest cherry blossom viewing party was held by the Emperor exclusively for himself and the nobles around the palace.""
"
根據這段文字，耶路撒冷的以下哪個方面最不可能有觀光吸引力？,"The correct answer is **B: 它作為以色列首都的地位 (Its status as the capital of Israel)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as Israel's capital."" This implies that its status as capital is a point of contention and doesn't necessarily contribute to its appeal *to tourists*.  While it's a fact, it's not a primary reason people visit.

Let's look at why the other options *are* reasons for tourist attraction, according to the passage:

* **A: 這座城市的宗教意義 (The city's religious significance):** The passage repeatedly emphasizes Jerusalem as the holy city for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. This is a major draw for pilgrims and religious tourists.
* **C: 它的文化產品 (Its cultural products):** The passage mentions the city's vibrancy, bustling shops, cafes, and restaurants, indicating a rich cultural scene.
* **D: 眾多歷史遺址 (The numerous historical sites):** The passage specifically mentions ancient history and the many historical and archaeological sites, making it a key attraction for history buffs.



Therefore, the status as capital, being disputed internationally, is the least likely reason to attract tourists.



"
文中沒有提到以下何者為耶路撒冷聞名遐邇的原因？,"The correct answer is **B: 政治影響**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions Jerusalem's **historical significance** (""long history of thousands of years""), **religious importance** (holy to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), and **cultural sites** (""numerous historical, archaeological, and cultural sights"").
* While the passage states that most countries and the UN don't recognize Jerusalem as Israel's capital, it doesn't delve into the *political impact* of this lack of recognition.  The passage focuses on *why* it is famous – its history, religion, and culture – not the complexities of its political status.

Therefore, ""political influence"" is the aspect *not* mentioned as a reason for Jerusalem's fame within the text.
"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的旅客不會因購買 Wild Card 而受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 只參觀克魯格國家公園的旅客**.

Here's why:

* **Wild Card benefits multi-park visits:** The text explicitly states that a Wild Card allows access to *some selected parks* or *all South African National Parks*.
* **Benefit for single-park visitors is minimal:** If a traveler *only* plans to visit Kruger National Park, the Wild Card wouldn't offer any additional value compared to buying a daily entry fee.
* **Other options are plausible:**
    * **A:** Those planning to visit multiple parks would definitely benefit from a Wild Card.
    * **C:** The text mentions daily fees and suggests the Wild Card might be more economical, so budget-conscious travelers would potentially benefit.
    * **D:**  This is a perfect scenario to utilize the Wild Card's benefits.

Therefore, the only group who wouldn't benefit from a Wild Card is those exclusively visiting Kruger.
"
關於克魯格國家公園的描述，哪種說法不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是南非最小的國家公園 (It is South Africa's smallest national park)**.

The text states that Kruger National Park is 19,000 square kilometers, which is a very large area. Therefore, it cannot be South Africa's smallest national park. The other options are all directly supported by the text.
"
對登山者來說，在整個山坡陡峭部分中，以下何者最有可能造成危險？,"The correct answer is **A: 潮濕情況 (Wet conditions)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""…尤其是潮濕的時候，因為這可能迅速使情況變得危險。"" (Especially when it's wet, it can quickly make the situation dangerous.) This directly links wetness to increased risk.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *most* dangerous:

* **B: 石階 (Stone steps):** While the steps are steep, they are designed to facilitate climbing.  The passage says most trails are paved with steps.
* **C: 小洞穴 (Small cave):** The cave is described as difficult to navigate due to its low height and cramped space, but not necessarily inherently dangerous.
* **D: 鋼纜 (Steel cables):** The steel cables are for support on steep sections.  They are intended to *reduce* danger, not cause it.

Therefore, the passage identifies wet conditions as the most likely factor to create a hazardous situation during the climb.
"
以下哪種說法不能正確表達文中所述的馬丘比丘山的攀登？,"The correct answer is **B: 整個陡峭路段沒有扶手 (The entire steep path has no handrails)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""地勢陡峭的路段則裝上鋼纜作為扶手"" (Steep sections are equipped with steel cables as handrails). This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options *can* be accurately expressed:

* **A: 即使是健康的登山者也可能喘不過氣 (Even healthy hikers may get out of breath):** The passage says ""要有喘不過氣的心理準備"" (Be prepared to be out of breath), indicating that even those in good shape might struggle.
* **C: 頂端有個必須穿越的小洞穴 (There's a small cave that must be crossed at the top):** The passage mentions ""接近頂端的地方有個必須穿越的小洞穴"" (Near the summit, there is a small cave that must be crossed).
* **D: 較陡峭的部分在潮濕時會變得危險 (The steeper sections become dangerous when wet):** The passage says ""特別小心較陡的部份，尤其是潮濕的時候，因為這可能迅速使情況變得危險"" (Be especially careful of the steeper sections, especially when wet, because this can quickly make the situation dangerous).



Therefore, option B is the only statement that *cannot* be accurately expressed based on the provided passage.



"
根據這段文字，何者並非馬略卡島飲食的主食？,"The correct answer is **C: 穀物**.

The text explicitly states that Mallorcan cuisine is based on bread, vegetables, and meat. It doesn't mention grains as a primary staple. While grains might be present, they aren't highlighted as a core component like the other three.
"
根據文中資訊，關於地熱土窯美食的說法，何者為非？,"The correct answer is **C: 烘烤式晚餐通常使用地熱土窯烹煮**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that **土窯 (earth ovens)** are commonly used for cooking **traditional baking-style dinners**. It doesn't say that *all* baking-style dinners are cooked in earth ovens.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 地熱土窯料理使用火燒過的滾燙石頭加熱坑洞** - This is directly stated in the passage.
* **B: 在威靈頓也能吃到使用滾燙石頭的地熱土窯料理** - The passage specifically mentions that geothermal earth ovens can be found in Rotorua and *also* in Christchurch, Wellington, and other places.
* **D: 在羅托魯瓦可以吃到地熱土窯料理** - This is directly stated in the passage.



Therefore, option C is the only statement that is not supported by the information in the passage."
典型的地熱土窯加熱方法中並未提及以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 天然氣 (Natural gas)**.

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **滾燙石頭 (Scorching stones)**
*   **地熱 (Geothermal heat)**

It doesn't mention natural gas as a heating method for the geothermal ovens. Therefore, natural gas is the one not mentioned in the context of typical geothermal oven heating.
"
什麼可能會引起僧侶或尼姑的特別認可？,"The correct answer is **A: 穿著色彩鮮豔的裹巾 (Wearing a brightly colored headscarf)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""如果你自己有準備（特別是鮮豔色彩的款式），入口處的修士或修女就會對你投以微笑。"" (If you come prepared (especially with brightly colored ones), the monks or nuns at the entrance will smile at you.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 遮住你的肩膀 (Covering your shoulders):** The passage states women must *not* show their shoulders.
* **C: 跟修道院借用裹巾 (Borrowing a headscarf from the monastery):** The passage implies borrowing is acceptable, but it doesn't mention it leading to special recognition. In fact, it notes potential discomfort due to hygiene.
* **D: 穿著剪裁不及膝的裙子 (Wearing a skirt that doesn't reach the knee):**  The passage states women *must* wear skirts that reach the knee or longer.



"
從寺院不太可能借用以下哪件衣服？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 短褲 (Shorts)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states women must wear **over-the-knee skirts** and men must wear **long pants (遮蓋膝蓋的長褲)**.
* Short pants are not mentioned and would violate the dress code for both genders.

Therefore, short pants are the least likely item to be available for borrowing at the monastery.
"
造訪南極地區時，遊客何時有機會看到星星？,"The correct answer is **B: 人口稀少時**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the lack of light pollution in sparsely populated areas allows for excellent stargazing. 
* While the passage mentions winter in the Arctic and the opportunity to see stars there, it doesn't specifically link stargazing to winter in Antarctica.
* Option A is incorrect because it states the opportunity is during the summer.
* Option C is incorrect because it is referring to the winter season, which is mentioned to have the opposite effect (eternal night).
* Option D is true, but less specific than option B.  The passage says the lack of light pollution *allows* for stargazing, but option B directly states *when* that lack of light pollution is most apparent (when the area is sparsely populated).

Therefore, the best answer that aligns with the passage's reasoning is B.
"
衛星電話何時作為手機的替代品是行不通的？,"The correct answer is **A: 如果衛星的視線可能受阻 (If a clear line of sight to the satellite is not possible)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that satellite phones require a clear view of the satellite to function. Obstructions like buildings, dense trees, or mountains will block the signal.
* Option B is incorrect because the text says satellite phones are *used in* remote areas, not that remoteness makes them unusable.
* Option C is incorrect because the text says you *must* be outdoors, not that using it *requires* being outdoors.
* Option D is incorrect. While adventure ships might use satellite phones, data requirements don't prevent the phone from working. The blockage of the satellite signal does.



"
何時衛星電話比手機更妥當？,"The correct answer is **B: 在划船旅行期間 (During boating trips)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that **ships, including pleasure craft and expedition vessels needing remote data and audio, frequently use satellite phones.** 
* Boating trips often take place in areas where cell phone service is unavailable.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在城市度假時 (During city vacations):**  Satellite phones are unnecessary in cities with cell service.
* **C: 不需要遠端資料時 (When remote data is not needed):** While a satellite phone *can* be used without data, the text highlights the need for them when remote data and audio are required, particularly on exploration vessels.
* **D: 您可能有合乎需要的手機訊號時 (When you might have adequate cell phone signal):** This contradicts the primary use case described in the text – areas *without* cell phone signal.



"
以下哪一項衝突促成了聶斯特河沿岸共和國的成立？,"The correct answer is **B: 種族 (Ethnic)**.

The passage states that Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflict. The formation of Transnistria is directly linked to this ethnic conflict. While economic and linguistic factors might have contributed, the underlying cause mentioned is the ethnic tensions.
"
聶斯特河沿岸共和國擁有以下何者與摩爾多瓦其他地區不同？  ,"The correct answer is **C: 聯合國的承認 (United Nations recognition)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 語言 (Language):** While Russian is widely used in Transnistria, it's not unique. Russian is also spoken in Moldova.
* **B: 宗教 (Religion):** Transnistria shares the same primary religion (Eastern Orthodox) as Moldova.
* **C: 聯合國的承認 (United Nations recognition):** The text explicitly states that Transnistria is *not* recognized by any UN member state. This is a key distinction.
* **D: 貨幣 (Currency):** The text says Transnistria has its own currency, which is a difference, but the lack of UN recognition is a more fundamental and defining distinction.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is C.
"
根據這段文字，如果旅客希望避免大風的情況，他們應該何時到訪蒙特維多？,"The correct answer is **A: 北半球的冬季月份 (North Hemisphere winter months)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""風加上濕度，讓人感覺比溫度計上顯示的冷多了"" (Wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates). This implies that the wind is a significant factor in the cold feeling during winter. Since the passage says the temperature rarely goes below freezing, but the wind makes it feel colder, visiting during the North Hemisphere's winter (which is their summer) would likely experience less wind. The question asks about avoiding wind, and the passage directly links wind to the uncomfortable cold in winter.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 蒙特維多的旱季 (Montevideo's dry season):** The passage explicitly states there's no distinct dry season.
* **C: 北半球的夏季月份 (North Hemisphere summer months):** The passage describes summers as hot, not windy.
* **D: 蒙特維多的冬季 (Montevideo's winter):** The passage describes winter as windy, making it unpleasant for those seeking to avoid wind.



"
根據這段文字，如果旅客偏愛涼爽的氣候，他們應該何時到訪蒙特維多？,"The correct answer is **D: 北半球的冬季** (Winter in the Northern Hemisphere).

Here's why:

* The passage states that Montevideo is located south of the equator, so when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo, and vice versa.
* Since the question asks for a *cool* climate, and winter in the Northern Hemisphere corresponds to summer in Montevideo (with the caveat of wind and humidity making it feel colder), traveling during Northern Hemisphere winter would offer a cooler experience.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 蒙特維多的夏季 (Summer in Montevideo):** The passage explicitly states that Montevideo's summer often exceeds 30 degrees Celsius, making it *not* a cool climate.
* **B: 北半球的夏季 (Summer in the Northern Hemisphere):** This would mean it's winter in Montevideo, which is the *opposite* of what the question asks for.
* **C: 蒙特維多的雨季 (Rainy season in Montevideo):** The passage states there's no specific rainy or dry season, so this isn't relevant to the question of a cool climate.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者與知名的塗鴉藝術家有關，而不是蓄意破壞？,"The correct answer is **A: 塗鴉活動**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""現今已有很多知名的塗鴉藝術家、塗鴉活動和「合法」塗鴉牆."" This means that ""塗鴉活動"" (graffiti activities) are associated with famous graffiti artists and are not necessarily destructive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 潦草字跡 (Scrawls):** The passage defines unauthorized additions as graffiti, and scrawls are often seen as less artistic and more like random markings.
* **C: 擅自在公共財產上加上的壁畫 (Murals added without permission to public property):** The passage defines graffiti as unauthorized additions, implying it's not art.
* **D: 難以辨別的標誌 (Indistinguishable marks):** This description is associated with the negative perception of graffiti as vandalism.



"
部分參加音樂節的遊客認為音樂節哪些方面是體驗的重要環節？,"The correct answer is **B: 現場露營**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""在某些節慶中，參加音樂節的大部分遊客都會選擇在現場露營，而且他們大多認為這是體驗的重要環節。"" (In some festivals, the majority of attendees choose to camp on-site, and they mostly consider this an important part of the experience.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 帶上幼童 (Bringing children):** While some festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children, the passage doesn't say this is a *generally* important part of the experience for *most* attendees.
* **C: 持續到深夜的音樂表演 (Music performances continuing late into the night):** The passage mentions performances continuing late, but it's presented as a detail about the festival, not a core part of the experience *itself*.
* **D: 提早進場 (Arriving early):**  Arriving early is presented as a *strategy* to get a good camping spot, not as an inherently important part of the festival experience.



"
根據這段文字，如果參加音樂節的遊客想在音樂附近露營，他們應該優先考慮什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 提早進場 (Arrive early)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""如果你想近距離觀賞活動，你必須提早進去，找到一個靠近音樂演奏的露營地點。"" (If you want to watch the activities up close, you must arrive early and find a campsite close to the musical performance.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 深夜前往 (Arrive late):** The text says the opposite – you need to arrive *early* to get a good spot.
* **B: 住在家庭專屬的露營區 (Stay in the family-exclusive campsite):** This is only relevant for families with young children, and the question doesn't specify that the person is traveling with children.
* **C: 場外露營 (Camping off-site):** The text doesn't mention anything about camping off-site. It focuses on camping *at* the festival grounds.



"
根據這段文字，在新墨西哥州北部尋找夜生活時，遊客應該避開哪裡？,"The correct answer is **B: 小鎮酒吧 (Small-town bars)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""提醒您：這兒的小鎮酒吧並非總適合外州來的遊客閒逛。"" (A reminder: small-town bars are not always suitable for out-of-state tourists to hang out in.)

While the text mentions casinos having drinks and entertainment, it warns against small-town bars due to serious drunk driving problems.
"
根據這段文字，在新墨西哥州北部，遊客最有可能在哪裡找到知名娛樂場所？,"The correct answer is **C: 聖塔菲附近的賭場**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""其中的幾個賭場亦會請來知名的娛樂表演（主要是阿爾伯克基和聖塔菲周遭鄰近的較大賭場）"" - meaning some casinos (specifically those near Albuquerque and Santa Fe) host famous entertainment.
* The text also cautions against visiting small town bars due to drunk driving issues.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 距離阿布奎基兩小時車程的賭場** - While casinos near Albuquerque *might* have entertainment, the text doesn't specify this distance, and the key takeaway is the connection to Santa Fe.
* **B: 一個偏遠小鎮** - The text says most villages are remote and have limited nightlife.
* **D: 小鎮酒吧** - The text strongly discourages visiting small town bars due to the high risk of drunk driving.



"
精打細算的旅客可能想避開哪種類型的飲料？,"The correct answer is **D: 果汁 (Juice)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""果汁很貴，但非常好喝。"" (Juice is very expensive, but very delicious.)
* The question asks which type of drink a budget-conscious traveler might want to avoid. The high price of juice makes it a likely candidate to be avoided by someone trying to save money.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 澳洲酒 (Australian wine):** The passage says New Zealand and Australian wines are good for long journeys, implying they are suitable and readily available.
* **B: 瓶裝水 (Bottled water):** The passage states local tap water is safe to drink, and bottled water is easily available *if* desired, not implying it's expensive or undesirable.
* **C: 當地啤酒 (Local beer):** The passage describes the local beer (""第一"") as being affordable and refreshing.



"
根據文中所述的區域，服務生可能會弄混以下哪張飲料訂單？,"The correct answer is **D: 白咖啡 (White Coffee)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states that ""白咖啡"" (White Coffee) is an *foreign* concept to Australians.** This means locals likely aren't familiar with it.
* **The text describes ""白咖啡"" as a local drink that's a blend of espresso and milk.** Therefore, a waiter could easily mistake it for a regular espresso or another similar coffee order.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: 濃縮咖啡 (Espresso):** Espresso is clearly defined in the text.  A waiter should understand the difference between espresso and white coffee.
* **B: 第一 (First):** ""第一"" is a local beer. A waiter should easily be able to identify it.
* **C: 紐西蘭的白蘇維濃 (New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc):**  While New Zealand wine is mentioned as potentially better for long transport, the text doesn't indicate that the waiter would be confused about a specific type of wine.

Therefore, the unfamiliarity of ""白咖啡"" makes it the most likely drink to be misordered.
"
長達三個世紀的殖民時期是由哪個群體開始的？,"The correct answer is **D: 西班牙人**.

The passage states: ""西班牙人開始了長達三個世紀的殖民時期."" (The Spanish began a three-century colonial period.)
"
根據這段文字，讓巴黎人對你感興趣的最佳方式是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 舉止有禮貌 (Be polite)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that even though the stereotype of Parisians being rude is often inaccurate, ""bien élevé"" (well-mannered, polite) behavior is key to getting along.
* The text goes on to say that showing basic politeness will quickly dispel any perceived rudeness.
* Option A is incorrect because the text says *don't* try to mimic the stereotype.
* Options B and D are not directly supported by the text. While confidence and outgoingness might be helpful in general, the text specifically emphasizes politeness as the key to navigating Parisian interactions.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者不被認為是巴黎人的刻板印象？,"The correct answer is **C: 俏皮 (Playful)**.

The passage explicitly states that self-centeredness, rudeness, and arrogance are the negative stereotypes of Parisians.  ""唐突 (tangtu)"" which translates to abrupt or impolite, is close to the concept of rudeness and would likely be considered a stereotype.

""俏皮 (qiàopí)"" means playful or witty, and is not mentioned as a negative stereotype. Therefore, it is the answer that doesn't fit.
"
開普敦 MetroRail 通勤鐵路頭等艙有什麼好處？,"The correct answer is **B: 人沒有那麼多 (There are fewer people)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""MetroPlus 艙等較舒適且較不擁擠..."" (MetroPlus compartments are more comfortable and less crowded...)
* **The passage also states:** ""MetroPlus 艙等價格雖然稍貴一些，但還是比一般的歐洲地鐵票便宜。"" (Although the price of the MetroPlus compartment is a little higher, it is still cheaper than general European subway tickets.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 車廂在列車的前端 (The compartments are at the front of the train):** The passage states MetroPlus compartments are at the *rear* of the train, closest to Cape Town.
* **C: 比三等艙票價便宜 (Cheaper than the third-class ticket price):** The passage states MetroPlus is *slightly* more expensive than the third-class ticket but *cheaper than European subway tickets*.
* **D: 與三等艙票價相同 (The same price as the third-class ticket):**  The passage explicitly states MetroPlus is *not* the same price.

Therefore, the only correct benefit listed is that the MetroPlus (頭等艙) is less crowded.
"
根據這段文字，開普敦的每班通勤列車都有什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 頭等艙和三等艙車廂**.

The passage explicitly states: ""所有列車都有 MetroPlus 與 Metro 兩種車廂..."" which translates to ""All trains have MetroPlus and Metro carriages..."" MetroPlus is described as equivalent to first class, and Metro is described as equivalent to third class. Therefore, trains have both first class and third class carriages.
"
動物害蟲不太可能做到以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 造成藉力傷害 (Cause physical harm)**.

Here's why:

The prompt explicitly states that animals that *usually* cause physical harm (like biting or scratching) are *not* typically classified as pests. Pests are generally defined by their ability to damage property, contaminate food, or cause discomfort.

Let's break down why the other options are plausible consequences of pests:

*   **A: 造成皮疹 (Cause rashes):** Many pests, like spiders and insects, can cause skin irritation and rashes through bites or contact.
*   **B: 刺激過敏反應 (Trigger allergic reactions):**  Pollen from some pests, or the venom/saliva of others, can trigger allergic reactions.
*   **C: 傳播傳染病 (Spread diseases):**  Some pests, like mosquitoes and ticks, are known vectors for diseases.

Therefore, causing physical harm through direct attacks like biting or scratching is *not* a characteristic typically associated with pest status, according to the given text.



"
哪裡可以購買預付電話卡？,"The correct answer is **C: 雜貨店 (Grocery stores)**.

The text explicitly states: ""每一間雜貨店都有販售預付電話卡..."" which translates to ""Every grocery store sells prepaid phone cards...""

Therefore, option C is the only one supported by the provided text.
"
如何取得通話費率更優惠的某些預付卡？,"The correct answer is **B: 透過撥打免付費電話**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""通常可以透過撥打一支免付費電話號碼來取得這些服務，大多數手機可以免費撥打該電話號碼."" (Usually, you can get these services by dialing a toll-free phone number, and most mobile phones can call that number for free.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它們只能在特定國家取得** (They can only be obtained in specific countries) - The passage mentions the cards *can* be used to call many countries, but doesn't say they are *only* available in specific countries to *get* the discounted rates.
* **C: 雜貨店** (Grocery stores) - While the passage states you can *buy* the cards in grocery stores, it doesn't explain how to find the *discounted* rates through grocery stores.
* **D: 使用公用電話並支付額外費用** (Use public phones and pay extra fees) - This is not mentioned in the passage and is generally not a method for acquiring prepaid phone cards with better rates.



"
根據這段文字，在十六湖國家公園不太常見到以下哪棵樹？,"The correct answer is **B: 橡樹**.

The passage explicitly states that the dominant trees in Sixteen Lakes National Park are beech, spruce, and fir. Oak trees are not mentioned.
"
以下哪些稀有動物可以在十六湖國家公園找到？,"The correct answer is **D: 松雞 (Pine Grosbeak)**.

The text specifically mentions ""松雞 (Pine Grosbeak)"" as a rare animal found in Sixteen Lakes National Park. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
根據這段文字，區域碼實際上能幫助什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 掌控市場 (Control the market)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""實際目的是讓公司更能掌控他們的市場；一切都是為了賺錢。"" (The actual purpose is to allow companies to have more control over their markets; everything is for profit.)  It then argues that region codes *don't* prevent piracy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 光碟複製 (Disc duplication):** The text says region codes *cannot* prevent disc duplication.
* **C: 防止盜版 (Prevent piracy):** The text directly states region codes *don't* prevent piracy.
* **D: 非法複製 (Illegal duplication):**  While region coding *can* be used for illegal duplication, it's not the *benefit* the company gets from it according to the passage. The passage focuses on market control.



"
根據這段文字，以下何者是媒體公司以區域碼繼續編造的謊言？,"The correct answer is **B: 區域碼有助於避免非法複製**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""區域碼完全無法防止盜版；逐位元複製的光碟可以在任何設備上，如同原版般正常播放。"" (Region codes completely cannot prevent piracy; bit-for-bit copied discs can play on any device just like the original.)  This directly contradicts the claim that region codes prevent piracy.
* The passage also says the *real* purpose is to control the market and make more money.  This implies the ""anti-piracy"" claim is a fabricated justification.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 區域碼是更能掌控他們市場的必要措施** - While the passage says controlling the market is a *real* purpose, it presents this as a *hidden* purpose, not something the companies are truthfully claiming as the reason for region codes.
* **C: 區域碼對吸金很有用** -  This is true according to the passage, but it's not the lie *about* the purpose of region codes.
* **D: 區域碼對防止盜版幾乎沒有幫助** - This is true according to the passage, but it doesn't represent the statement the media companies are lying about.

Therefore, **B** is the most accurate answer because it identifies the specific claim about piracy prevention that the media companies are falsely promoting.
"
回國時，何者通常是非正規程序？,"The correct answer is **D: 海關管制 (Customs control)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""回國時，可能不必經過移民署檢查，或僅是例行公事，但海關控管就可能十分惱人。"" (When returning to the country, you may not need to go through immigration checks, or it may just be a routine procedure, but customs control can be very annoying.) This directly highlights customs control as a potentially problematic aspect of returning.

* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: 移民署檢查 (Immigration checks):** The passage suggests immigration checks might not always be necessary or significant.
    * **B: 申報物品 (Declaring items):** Declaring items is a *required* procedure to avoid penalties, not necessarily a ""non-正規程序"" (irregular procedure).
    * **C: 物品的法律規定 (Legal regulations regarding items):** Knowing the legal regulations is important for compliance, not an irregular procedure in itself.

Therefore, based on the passage's emphasis on potential difficulties, **海關管制 (Customs control)** is the most likely ""non-正規程序"" (irregular procedure) mentioned.  It's the aspect that the passage warns about being ""惱人"" (annoying).
"
回國時，您應該瞭解以下何者？,"The best answer is **C: 是否有海關管制 (Whether there is customs control)**.

Here's why:

* **The premise of the question states that customs control can be ""very annoying.""** The question itself focuses on what you *should* know upon returning.
* **The passage explicitly mentions customs control as a potential issue.**
* **Option C directly addresses the concern raised in the premise.**

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **A: 是否有移民署檢查站 (Whether there are immigration checkpoints):** While immigration checkpoints *might* be present, the passage downplays their importance compared to customs control. The focus is on customs.
* **B: 是否需要申報超出法律規定的物品 (Whether you need to declare items exceeding legal limits):** This is related to customs, but Option C is a broader and more direct answer to what you *should* understand.  The ability to declare is a *result* of understanding customs control.
* **D: 是否攜帶任何違禁品 (Whether you are carrying any prohibited items):** This is important, but understanding the general customs control is a prerequisite to knowing what's prohibited.  Option C encompasses the knowledge needed to avoid carrying prohibited items.

Therefore, **C** is the most comprehensive and directly relevant answer to the question based on the provided text.
"
根據這段文字，科查莫谷具備豐富的什麼東西讓登山者不斷探索其內部的新路線？,"The correct answer is **D: 岩壁 (Rock walls)**.

The text explicitly states that the valley has ""各式各樣的大片花崗岩壁和峭壁"" (various large granite walls and cliffs) which are what climbers explore to create new routes. While the scenery is mentioned as beautiful, it's the rock walls themselves that provide the climbing opportunities.
"
根據文中提供的資訊，誰涵蓋了南半球最多的越洋航線？,"The correct answer is **B: 星空聯盟**.

The text explicitly states: ""星空聯盟涵蓋了所有航線，除了南太平洋東部從智利聖地牙哥到大溪地的航線以外..."" This means Star Alliance covers the most routes in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one exception mentioned.
"
哪個航空聯盟涵蓋最少的南半球越洋航線？,"The correct answer is **A: 星空聯盟 (Star Alliance)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""星空聯盟涵蓋了所有航線，除了南太平洋東部從智利聖地牙哥到大溪地的航線以外..."" (Star Alliance covers all routes except the South Pacific East from Santiago, Chile to Tahiti...). This means Star Alliance covers *most* routes, but not all.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 南太平洋 (South Pacific):** The South Pacific is a region, not an airline alliance, and is not a choice in the passage.
*   **C: 寰宇一家 (OneWorld):** The passage states that the Santiago-Tahiti route is operated by the *LATAM Group of OneWorld*. Therefore, OneWorld *does* have a route in the South Pacific.
*   **D: 天合聯盟 (SkyTeam):** The passage states that *no* SkyTeam alliance spans all three oceans in the Southern Hemisphere.

Therefore, Star Alliance covers the *least* number of routes among the listed options.
"
哪個旅遊組織接續了全球跑步之旅？,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Go Running Tours 接續 Global Running Tours 成立..."" which translates to ""Go Running Tours followed the establishment of Global Running Tours...""
"
根據這段文字，Go Running Tours 協助串連了多少個不同的觀光路跑供應商？,"The correct answer is **C: 數十個 (Dozens)**.

The text states: ""他們在四大洲串連了數十個觀光路跑供應商。"" which translates to ""They have connected dozens of sightseeing running suppliers across four continents.""
"
如果遊客希望盡可能清楚地看到獵豹，該怎麼做？,"The correct answer is **C: 使用雙筒望遠鏡 (Use binoculars)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that lions, cheetahs, and leopards ""have time to avoid people"" and are better observed with binoculars. 
* Option C directly addresses this point.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 去野生健行 (Go on a wildlife trek):** While wildlife treks can offer great experiences, they aren't specifically mentioned as the best way to see cheetahs.
* **B: 去叢林漫步 (Go on a jungle walk):** This is a more general term and not specifically related to seeing wildlife clearly.
* **D: 搭車並使用標準裝備 (Take a ride and use standard equipment):** The passage mentions standard equipment is good for seeing elephants and giraffes, but not necessarily cheetahs.
"
根據這段文字，遊客在坐車遊覽野生動物園時可能會遇到哪種動物？,"The correct answer is **B: 長頸鹿 (Giraffes)**.

The text states: ""大象和長頸鹿這些動物往往會接近車子，因此標準裝備能讓你看得更清楚。"" (Elephants and giraffes often approach the vehicle, so standard equipment allows you to see them more clearly.)
"
根據這段文字，什麼事情會降低旅遊成本？,"The correct answer is **B: 尋找四人團 (Finding a group of four people)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""越多人的旅行團價格越便宜，所以若是單獨或與一名朋友外出旅行，可以與其他人結伴組成四到六人的團體，以降低個人單價。"" (The more people in the tour group, the cheaper the price, so if you travel alone or with one friend, you can join others to form a group of four to six people to reduce the individual price.)

Therefore, forming a group of 4-6 people is the action that lowers the cost per person. The other options are incorrect because the passage says that traveling alone or with one friend is *more expensive* and suggests joining a group to remedy that.
"
根據這段文字，誰有可能獲得最棒的旅遊價格？,"The correct answer is **A: 四處詢問以加入旅行團的遊客 (Travelers who inquire about joining existing tours)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the price per person *decreases* as the tour group size *increases*.
* It also mentions that many travelers are often looking to join existing tours.
* Therefore, the best price is likely obtained by finding a tour that already has a full group and inquiring about joining, rather than forming a new group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 三人團 (Three-person group)** - This is a smaller group and would likely be *more* expensive per person than a larger group.
* **C: 兩個朋友一起旅行 (Two friends traveling together)** - This is an even smaller group and would also likely be *more* expensive per person.
* **D: 五人團 (Five-person group)** - While a five-person group would be cheaper than a two-person group, it's not the *best* possible price.



"
根據這段文字，是什麼讓舊金山得以聞名全球？,"The correct answer is **A: 經常出現在各種形式的藝術和媒體中 (Frequently described in music, film, literature and popular culture)**.

The text specifically states: ""音樂、電影、文學和流行文化中的頻繁描述使這座城市及其地標變得舉世聞名 (Frequent descriptions in music, film, literature, and popular culture have made the city and its landmarks world-famous).""

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are not the primary reason for the city's global fame.
"
根據這段文字，關於舊金山的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **D: 經濟完全仰仗旅遊業 (The economy completely relies on tourism)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the economy is *diverse*, not reliant solely on tourism.** It lists several key sectors beyond tourism: professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism.
* **A: 它經常出現在電影和書籍中 (It frequently appears in movies and books)** - This is directly supported by the text: ""音樂、電影、文學和流行文化中的頻繁描述使這座城市及其地標變得舉世聞名 (Frequent descriptions in music, film, literature, and popular culture have made the city and its landmarks world-famous).""
* **B: 亞洲美食很普遍 (Asian cuisine is widespread)** - The text states: ""舊金山也是國內品嘗韓國菜、泰國菜、印度菜和日本菜等其他亞洲料理的最佳去處之一 (San Francisco is also one of the best places in the country to sample other Asian cuisines such as Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese food).""
* **C: 有許多飯店和會議中心 (There are many hotels and conference centers)** - The text explicitly mentions: ""舊金山發展出了大規模的觀光基礎建設，包括無數家飯店、餐廳，以及一流的會議設施 (San Francisco has developed a large tourism infrastructure, including countless hotels, restaurants, and first-class conference facilities).""



Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that the economy *completely* depends on tourism.

根據這段文字，哪種類型的旅客不太可能因使用旅行社服務而受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 傾向於隨興安排的旅客 (Travelers who prefer to be spontaneous)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that travel agencies provide benefits like pre-booked accommodations and coordinated arrangements.  Someone who prefers to be spontaneous and make plans as they go wouldn't value these pre-arranged services.  They wouldn't need the peace of mind of a pre-booked hotel or the structured packages offered.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 優柔寡斷的旅客 (Indecisive travelers):**  Travel agencies can *help* indecisive travelers by providing options and holding reservations while they decide.
* **C: 還未確定拿到簽證的旅客 (Travelers who haven't secured visas):** Travel agencies can hold bookings while visa applications are processed.
* **D: 喜歡預訂套裝行程的旅客 (Travelers who like booking packages):** The text specifically mentions that travel agencies *offer* package deals, so this group would benefit.



Therefore, the group least likely to benefit is the one who prefers to travel without a plan.
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為經由旅行社預訂的好處？,"The correct answer is **A: 旅行證件急件處理 (Travel document expedited processing)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions several benefits:**
    * Knowing you have a place to stay upon arrival.
    * Booking various accommodation types (including campsites).
    * Package deals including breakfast and airport transfers.
    * Holding reservations while you finalize details like visas.

* **The text *doesn't* mention expedited travel document processing.** The focus is on accommodation, transportation, and general booking convenience.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **B: 飯店優惠 (Hotel discounts):**  While not explicitly stated as a *guaranteed* benefit, the text mentions travel agencies often partner with specific hotels, implying potential for discounts or special deals.
* **C: 全包套裝行程 (All-inclusive packages):** The text directly mentions the availability of package deals including flights and hotels, and breakfast.
* **D: 保留預訂 (Holding reservations):** The text states travel agencies can hold reservations while you handle other aspects of your trip.



Therefore, the only option *not* mentioned as a benefit of booking through a travel agency is expedited travel document processing.



"
根據這段文字，即時文本翻譯應用程式不能做什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 每次都 100% 正確翻譯 (Translate 100% accurately every time)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""雖然翻譯引擎已有巨大的改進，現在通常提供或多或少正確的翻譯（和更少的胡言亂語），但因為翻譯結果仍可能完全是錯誤的，應對其持有一些小心謹慎的態度."" This translates to ""Although translation engines have made huge improvements, they now usually provide more or less accurate translations (and less nonsense), but because translation results can still be completely wrong, one should approach them with some caution.""
* Options A, B, and C are all capabilities of instant text translation apps mentioned in the text.

Therefore, the only thing the text says they *can't* do is guarantee 100% accuracy.
"
何者讓翻譯可以離線進行？,"The correct answer is **C: 下載語言資料 (Download language data)**.

The text explicitly states: ""它可以在下載所需的語言資料後，進行離線翻譯"" which translates to ""It can perform offline translation after downloading the required language data.""

While the improved translation engine is important, and the app itself is relevant, it's the downloaded language data that enables offline translation.
"
以下何者並非觸發雪崩的因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 有黏性的雪 (Snow with cohesion)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that snow's cohesion is *necessary* for a snowpack to accumulate and for a slide to occur *after* a trigger. It's a characteristic of snow, not a trigger itself. The other options are explicitly mentioned as potential triggers:

* **B: 人類 (Humans):**  The passage states that human activity is a *common* trigger.
* **C: 陽光 (Sunlight):** The passage lists sunlight as a *possible* trigger.
* **D: 額外降雪 (Additional snowfall):** The passage lists additional snowfall as a *possible* trigger.



Therefore, the only option that *isn't* a trigger is snow's cohesion.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者掉下會形成雪崩？,"The correct answer is **C: 陡坡上多餘的積雪 (Excess snow on a steep slope)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that avalanches happen when ""excess snow"" accumulates on a steep slope. This excess snow is the material that falls.
* Options A and B are incorrect because the passage says the snow needs a trigger to fall, and the snow needs to be on a slope.
* Option D is irrelevant because the passage doesn't mention whether or not human interaction is required for snow to fall (it only states that human activity is a common trigger).



"
根據這段文字，咖哩以哪些食材為底？,"The correct answer is **B: 藥草和香料**.

The first sentence of the text states: ""咖哩是以藥草和香料為底，加上肉類或蔬菜的菜餚。"" which translates to ""Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, with meat or vegetables added.""

Therefore, the base of curry, according to the text, is herbs and spices.
"
在某些地區，有時咖哩中的哪種食材會使用椰奶代替？,"The correct answer is **C: 優格**.

The text explicitly states: ""巴基斯坦和北印度內陸區的咖哩料理中常用到優格；南印度和印度次大陸的其他沿海地區則常改用椰奶。"" (In the curries of Pakistan and the inland areas of North India, yogurt is commonly used; in South India and other coastal areas of the Indian subcontinent, coconut milk is often used instead.)

Therefore, yogurt is the ingredient that is sometimes replaced with coconut milk.
"
為什麼沿著橫貫南極山脈繞彎路才能抵達高原上方？,"The correct answer is **C: 專用拖拉機不靈活**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""它們不太靈活，所以路徑必須沿著橫貫南極山脈繞著長長的彎路才能抵達高原上方。"" (They are not very flexible, so the route must follow the Transantarctic Mountains with long curves to reach the plateau above.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 麥克默多站經常關閉:** The passage doesn't mention the McMurdo Station closing.
* **B: 壓實的雪地很危險:** While the snow is packed, the passage mentions cracks are filled, suggesting efforts to mitigate the danger, not that danger is the primary reason for the route.
* **D: 這樣比穿越羅斯海更容易:** The passage doesn't mention crossing the Ross Sea as an alternative route.

Therefore, the inflexibility of the specialized tractors is the direct reason for the route's design.
"
在南極橫貫公路上，什麼東西用旗幟作記號了？,"The correct answer is **C: 用雪填補過的裂縫**.

The passage states: ""它是壓實的雪地，裂縫也經過填補，有旗幟作為記號。"" which translates to ""It is packed snow, and the cracks are filled, with flags as markers.""

Therefore, the flags mark the filled cracks in the road.
"
文中沒有提到遊客在探索南非時應該注意什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 幾乎所有南非鄰國都很穩定 (Almost all of South Africa's neighboring countries are stable)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""南非雖然安定，但並非所有鄰國都如此"" (Although South Africa is stable, not all of its neighboring countries are).
* Option C directly contradicts this statement, making it something the passage *doesn't* support.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 簽證要求因國家而異 (Visa requirements vary by country)**: This is mentioned in the passage.
* **B: 開車探索是參觀人跡罕至之地的好方法 (Driving is a good way to visit remote places)**: This is also mentioned in the passage.
* **D: 如果開車旅行，建議使用四輪傳動車 (It is recommended to use a four-wheel drive vehicle if traveling by car)**: This is directly mentioned in the passage.



Therefore, the only option that the passage *doesn't* mention is that nearly all of South Africa's neighboring countries are stable.
"
根據這段文字，對於希望駕車探索南非的遊客來說，何者會被視為不好的建議？,"The correct answer is **B: 雖然建議使用四輪傳動車，但大多數地點都可以用普通車輛到達**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""透過仔細規劃，乘坐普通車輛也能做到，但**強烈建議選擇四輪傳動車**，而且許多地點只有高軸距的四輪傳動車才能抵達.""

Option B contradicts this strong recommendation, making it a poor piece of advice according to the text. The other options are either neutral or support the advice given in the text.
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為行李無人看管的潛在危險？,"The correct answer is **C: 可能會與別人的行李混淆 (May be confused with someone else's luggage)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly mentions the dangers of being unknowingly used to carry drugs, theft, and being flagged as a potential bomb threat.
* **Option C (being confused with someone else's luggage)** is not mentioned in the provided text.

Therefore, C is the correct answer because it's the only option not supported by the information given in the passage.
"
關於攜帶毒品，文中沒有提到什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 即使沒有攜帶毒品，當局也可能會沒收您的行李 (Even if you don't carry drugs, authorities may still confiscate your luggage)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the risks of *being used to carry drugs***. It specifically mentions being unknowingly made a drug carrier.
* While the passage warns about the risks of carrying drugs (mentioning severe penalties), it also highlights the risk of luggage being confiscated for other reasons, like bomb threats, regardless of whether drugs are present.
* Options A, B, and C are directly mentioned in the passage. Option D is the *most accurate* answer because the passage implies this risk through its warnings about being unknowingly involved with illegal substances and the potential for suspicion.

Therefore, while the passage discusses the consequences of drug-related issues, it *does* imply the risk of luggage confiscation, even without drugs, due to suspicion or security concerns. Option D best reflects this implied risk.



"
居家度假時，文中沒有提到哪種飲料可以嘗試在家製作？,"The correct answer is **C: 啤酒**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically mentions making fruit juices and smoothies at home during a staycation.
* It suggests trying different bars and pubs, implying the possibility of trying various alcoholic beverages.
* However, it **doesn't mention making beer at home**.

Therefore, beer is the drink option not mentioned as something to try making at home.
"
如果你的城市以飲酒文化聞名，你應該於居家度假期間到訪以下何者？,"The correct answer is **C: 你通常不常光顧的酒吧 (You should visit a bar you don't usually go to.)**

The text explicitly states: ""如果你生活在一個具有各種飲酒文化的城市裡，你應該去周遭平常不太去的酒吧或酒館。(If you live in a city with various drinking cultures, you should visit bars or pubs around you that you don't usually go to.)""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 鄰近的咖啡店 (Nearby coffee shop):** The text mentions coffee, but doesn't suggest visiting a coffee shop specifically.
* **B: 果汁或冰沙店 (Juice or smoothie shop):** The text suggests making juices or smoothies, not visiting a shop.
* **D: 沖泡洋甘菊茶的餐廳 (Restaurants that brew chamomile tea):** The text mentions chamomile tea for relaxation at night, but doesn't suggest visiting a restaurant specifically for it.



"
鴿子雕像在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **B: 墓地裡**.

The passage states: ""在教堂的院落中，一些墓碑上有一些有趣的鴿子大理石雕像。"" This translates to ""In the courtyard of the church, there are some interesting pigeon marble statues on some tombstones.""  Therefore, the statues are located in the cemetery within the church courtyard.
"
哪種類型的簽證可能需要某人提供足夠的財力證明？,"The correct answer is **D: 學生簽證 (Student Visa)**.

The text explicitly states: ""在大部分的國家/地區，您都要提供欲就讀的教育機構所給的錄取通知書，同時也要提供至少能支持您完成第一年課程的財力證明。"" (In most countries, you need to provide a letter of acceptance from the educational institution you want to attend, as well as proof of financial resources sufficient to cover at least the first year of your studies.) This directly relates to student visas.

While business visas *might* require financial proof, it's not stated in the text and student visas are explicitly mentioned as needing it. Tourist and short-term visas are less likely to require such extensive financial documentation for longer stays.
"
誰最有可能需要延長簽證？,"The correct answer is **C: 國際學生 (International Students)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""通常，若要在外國居住一段較長的時間，你必須事先取得簽證。 學生簽證的要求和申請程序通常與一般觀光或商務簽證不同。 在大部分的國家/地區，您都要提供欲就讀的教育機構所給的錄取通知書，同時也要提供至少能支持您完成第一年課程的財力證明。""  This directly indicates that international students are the ones most likely to need a longer visa.

The other options are incorrect because the passage implies shorter stays are often visa-free for tourists and business travelers, while international students require more extended stays for their studies.
"
何時應該特別注意蚊子？,"The best answer is **A: 夏季 (Summer)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states ""尤其在夏天，如果你決定徒步穿過雨林，就必須提防蚊子。""** This directly translates to ""Especially in summer, if you decide to hike through the rainforest, you must be wary of mosquitoes.""  This makes summer the most general and encompassing time to be concerned about mosquitoes.

While the other options are mentioned in the passage, they are specific scenarios *within* the context of mosquito danger, not the overarching time period.
"
根據這段文字，開車穿越熱帶雨林時，為了避開蚊子，你不應該做什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 讓車門打開的時間過長 (Let the car door be open for too long)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that even opening the car door for a few seconds is enough for mosquitoes to enter the vehicle.  Therefore, the action to *avoid* is leaving the door open for an extended period.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 夏季開車穿越熱帶雨林 (Driving through the rainforest in summer):** The passage specifies that mosquitoes are a problem *especially in summer*, but it doesn't say avoiding driving in summer would help.
* **C: 駕車穿越亞熱帶地區 (Driving through subtropical areas):** The passage mentions subtropical rainforests, but doesn't say avoiding driving in subtropical areas would help. The focus is on the rainforest environment.
* **D: 徒步旅行時無人看管車輛 (Leaving the vehicle unattended while hiking):**  This isn't directly addressed in the passage.  The issue is about mosquito entry *when entering the car*.



"
根據這段文字，關於蘇達班的說法中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 其總面積的一半為沼澤所覆蓋 (Its total area is half covered by swamps.)**

Here's why:

* The text states that approximately *one-third* of the Sundarbans forest is water or swamp.  Therefore, half is incorrect.
* A: The text explicitly says the Sundarbans contains parts of the huge forests that once covered the Ganges Plain.
* C: The text states it's the world's largest mangrove forest.
* D: The text mentions about 30,000 deer and 400 tigers, implying that the deer population is larger.



"
哪一部分的森林位於印度境內？,"The correct answer is **A: 巽達班斯國家公園**.

The text states: ""位於印度境內的區域稱為巽達班斯國家公園."" which translates to ""The area located within India is called Sundarbans National Park.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 野生動物保護區 (Wildlife sanctuary):** While the Sundarbans is a wildlife sanctuary, the question asks for the *specific* area within India.
*   **C: 世界遺產 (World Heritage site):** The Sundarbans being a World Heritage site is a broader designation, not a specific location within India.
*   **D: 恆河平原 (Ganges Plain):** The text mentions that the forest *includes* part of the former Ganges Plain, but the designated area *within India* is the national park.



"
根據這段文字，誰最有可能至少稍微理解英文？,"The correct answer is **B: 年紀較小的人 (Younger people)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""很多國家全國上下都能說流利的英語，而能稍微理解英語的國家更多，特別是這些國家的年輕人。(In many countries, people can speak fluent English nationwide, and there are more countries where people can slightly understand English, especially the younger people in those countries.)""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 至少會說兩種其他語言的人 (People who speak at least two other languages):** While multilingualism *could* contribute to English comprehension, the text doesn't explicitly link it to English understanding.
* **C: 前往多倫多旅行的人 (People traveling to Toronto):**  Travel to Toronto doesn't guarantee English comprehension. They might not have any prior English knowledge.
* **D: 年齡較大的人 (Older people):** The text explicitly states that *younger* people are more likely to understand English.



Therefore, option B is the most directly supported by the text."
根據這段文字，什麼東西很難發音？,"The correct answer is **B: 地址 (Addresses)**.

The text explicitly states: ""此外，書面字詞通常比口語字詞容易理解，尤其是傳達地址時，因為地址通常很難清楚地發音。"" (Furthermore, written words are usually easier to understand than spoken words, especially when conveying addresses, because addresses are usually difficult to pronounce clearly.)

Therefore, the difficulty lies with pronouncing addresses.
"
根據這段文字，對於打算從區間巴士站搭巴士的旅客來說，何者是理想情況？,"The best answer is **B: 旅客要前往布姆唐，並需要在 7 點之前離開**. Here's why:

* **The text specifically states:** ""大多數的巴士會在 06:30 和 07:30 之間離站，尤其是那些前往東方和賈卡爾 / 布姆唐的巴士。"" (Most buses depart between 06:30 and 07:30, especially those going to Dongpo and Jakarta / Bumtang.)
* **Therefore:** To catch a bus to Bumtang, the traveler should aim to leave before 7:30 AM.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 旅客要前往賈卡爾，並已經先買好了車票:** While buying tickets in advance is recommended, the text doesn't specify a particular departure time for Jakarta.
* **C: 旅客要前往帕羅，並需要在 11 點之後離開:**  The text mentions shared taxis to Paro and their cost, but doesn't relate to buses departing at a specific time after 11 AM.
* **D: 旅客要前往東方，並要在 6:20 之前到達車站:** While a bus to Dongpo *might* leave around 6:30 AM, the text doesn't give a specific arrival time needed to catch it.  And 6:20 is earlier than the generally recommended 6:30-7:30 window.



"
對於希望從區間巴士站往東方旅行的遊客來說，何者是好秘訣？,"The correct answer is **B: 購買預售票 (Buy tickets in advance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""由於區間巴士經常客滿，建議您提前幾天購買車票。"" (Because the local buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets a few days in advance.)
* **Option A is incorrect:** The passage states most buses leave *between* 06:30 and 07:30, which is *before* 08:30, not after.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The passage says most buses leave *between* 06:30 and 07:30, not all day.
* **Option D is partially correct but not the *best* advice for the specific question:** While shared taxis are a good option, the question asks for the *best* tip for traveling *to the East*. The passage directly mentions the bus being often full, making pre-booking the most crucial advice.

Therefore, buying tickets in advance is the most helpful tip for someone wanting to travel to the East on the local bus.
"
關於廷布克圖的描述，以下何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 搭飛機無法抵達這座城鎮 (It is impossible to reach this town by plane)**.

The text explicitly states: ""現今的廷巴克圖是一座貧困的城鎮，但過往名聲讓其成為旅遊景點，**且有一座機場**。"" (Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its past fame has made it a tourist destination, **and it has an airport**.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 它比該國其他地區更受阿拉伯所影響 (It is more influenced by Arab style than other parts of the country):** The text states, ""該城市與國內的其它城市有明顯差異，因為它偏向擁有阿拉伯而不是非洲風格。"" (The city differs significantly from other cities in the country because it leans towards having an Arab rather than African style.)
* **B: 它很貧困 (It is poor):** The text says, ""現今的廷巴克圖是一座貧困的城鎮"" (Today, Timbuktu is a poor town).
* **D: 它對充滿好奇心的遊客仍具有吸引力 (It still attracts curious tourists):** The text states, ""過往名聲讓其成為旅遊景點"" (Its past fame has made it a tourist destination).



"
關於廷布克圖的事實，以下何者為真？,"The correct answer is **A: 搭飛機可以到達這座城鎮**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""目前的廷巴克圖是一座貧困的城鎮，但過往名聲讓其成為旅遊景點，**且有一座機場**。"" (Currently, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its past fame has made it a tourist destination, **and it has an airport**.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 比起貧窮，它更具有異國情調** (More exotic than poor): While the text mentions its exotic past, it emphasizes its current poverty.  The phrasing doesn't suggest it's *more* exotic than poor, just that its past reputation contributes to its exotic image.
* **C: 與周邊城市相比，它較不具有非洲風情** (Less African in style than surrounding cities): The text states the opposite: ""該城市與國內的其它城市有明顯差異，因為它偏向擁有阿拉伯而不是非洲風格。"" (The city has a noticeable difference from other cities in the country because it tends to have an Arab rather than African style.)
* **D: 這座城市不再吸引遊客** (This city no longer attracts tourists):  The text says it *is* a tourist destination due to its past fame.



"
夏季奧運會原定何時舉行？ ,"The correct answer is **A: 2021 年 8 月**.

The text states: ""帕運會將於 2021 年 8 月 24 日至 9 月 5 日舉行。"" which translates to ""The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021.""  While the Olympics are mentioned as being postponed, the text clearly states the new date for the Paralympics is in August 2021.  The question asks for the original date of the Summer Olympics.  The text doesn't explicitly state that, but implies the 2021 Paralympics replaced the 2020 Olympics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 2020 年 3 月:** The text mentions cancellation policies being set in March, but this is not the date the Olympics were originally supposed to be held.
* **C: 2021 年 9 月:**  The text gives the dates of the Paralympics, not the Olympics.
* **D: 2020 年 7 月:** The cancellation policies did not extend to July 2020, the original date.



"
根據這段文字，何時漏斗會變成龍捲風？,"The correct answer is **D: 接觸地面時 (When they touch the ground)**.

The passage states: ""它們開始時是從風暴雲中下降造成的漏斗，而後在接觸地面時成為「龍捲風」."" which translates to ""They begin as funnels descending from storm clouds, and then become 'tornadoes' when they touch the ground.""
"
關於龍捲風的特徵，以下何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 經常帶著重物移動 (Often carry heavy objects)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 一定會產生每小時 100-200 英里左右的風速 (Always produce winds of around 100-200 mph)** - This is incorrect. While many strong tornadoes do reach these speeds, not all do. Some are weaker.
* **B: 經常帶著重物移動 (Often carry heavy objects)** - This is correct. The passage states tornadoes *can* lift heavy objects and carry them along.
* **C: 在接觸地面後會變成漏斗 (Become a funnel after contacting the ground)** - This is incorrect. The passage states a funnel *forms* before contacting the ground, and then becomes a tornado *when* it touches down.
* **D: 是一個會把空氣向外推的旋轉空氣柱 (Is a rotating column of air that pushes air outwards)** - This is incorrect. The passage states tornadoes *suck* air inwards.



Therefore, only option B aligns with the information provided in the passage."
根據這段文字，旅客應該自何處取得有關目的地城市政局的建議？,"The correct answer is **A: 他們將到訪的國家之政府 (The government of the country they are visiting)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""不過他們的建議是為其公民而設計的 (However, their advice is designed for their own citizens)."" This means the government of the destination country is the most relevant source for understanding the political situation, as their advice is tailored for their own people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 根據旅行公告提出的觀點 (Based on the views presented in travel advisories):** The text argues that travel advisories (which are a form of government advice) are often simplistic and generalized.
* **C: 他們將到訪的國家之公民 (Citizens of the country they are visiting):** While citizens might have insights, the text emphasizes that government advice is specifically *for* citizens and therefore the most relevant.
* **D: 他們自己的政府 (Their own government):** The text indicates that advice from *their own* government may not be as specific or relevant to the situation in the destination country. It highlights differences in advice based on citizenship.



"
如果有旅遊公告，外國公民不太可能經歷什麼事情？,"The correct answer is **B: 過度簡化該國政局的概況 (Overly simplified overview of the country's political situation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""諮詢意見只是對某國政治情況的簡短摘要。與其他地方能取得的詳細資訊相比，他們所提供的觀點常較粗略、籠統且過於簡化。"" (Consulting advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation. Compared to other information available, the views they provide are often crude, general, and overly simplified.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 受影響的行程取消保險 (Impacted travel cancellation insurance):** The passage mentions travel insurance *might* be affected, but it doesn't say travel advisories *cause* it to be affected. It's a potential consequence, not the primary outcome described.
* **C: 受影響的健康保險 (Impacted health insurance):**  Similar to insurance, the passage mentions potential impact but doesn't directly link it to travel advisories.
* **D: 關於該國政局的詳情 (Details about the country's political situation):** The passage states the advice is *not* detailed, but rather simplified.



"
根據這段文字，哪種類型的旅行最不可能需要旅行社的預訂協助？,"The correct answer is **A: 出差前去旅客曾去過的城市參加工作會議 (Business trip to a city the traveler has already visited for a work conference)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that travel agencies are most helpful when the destination's environment, culture, or language is *outside* the traveler's experience, or when traveling to a low-income country.
* Option A describes a trip to a familiar location for a work conference. This doesn't fit the criteria for needing a travel agency.  The traveler already knows the city and likely doesn't need assistance navigating cultural or language barriers.

Let's look at why the other options *would* benefit from a travel agency:

* **B: 有特定預算限制，為期兩周的長途旅行 (Has a specific budget limit, a two-week long trip):**  This implies a more complex itinerary that would likely benefit from a travel agency's expertise in finding deals and coordinating logistics.
* **C: 會出現語言障礙的旅行 (A trip with language barriers):** This directly aligns with the passage's suggestion that travel agencies are helpful when encountering unfamiliar languages.
* **D: 旅客的第一次出國旅行 (The traveler's first trip abroad):**  First-time travelers often need assistance with visas, transportation, and overall planning – things a travel agency excels at.



"
根據這段文字，在哪種情況下，旅客最能因旅行社的協助而受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 旅客第一次有興趣預訂特色短途旅行時**.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agencies are a good choice when the destination's natural environment, culture, or language is beyond the traveler's experience, *or* when traveling to a low-income country. This aligns with the idea of a ""特色短途旅行"" (specialty/unique short trip) – a trip that involves unfamiliar experiences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 旅客預訂往返航班到訪家鄉時 (When travelers book round-trip flights to visit their hometown):** This is a very simple, familiar trip and doesn't require the expertise a travel agency would offer.
* **C: 旅客能流利使用度假目的地的母語時 (When travelers can speak the local language fluently):** Language proficiency reduces the need for a travel agency's assistance.
* **D: 旅客到訪他們熟悉文化差異的地方時 (When travelers visit places where they are familiar with cultural differences):** Familiarity minimizes the need for a travel agency's expertise in navigating unfamiliar cultural situations.



Therefore, option B best reflects the situations where a travel agency's services are most beneficial, according to the provided text."
根據這段文字，何者可以協助旅客在到訪新地方時不會失望？,"The correct answer is **A: 期望當地標準與居住地相似** (Expect local standards to be similar to your home).

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes that things in a new place are *different* from home in many aspects (customs, laws, food, etc.). 
* The key to avoiding disappointment is to be aware of these differences *before* you go and to adjust your expectations accordingly. 
* Option A directly addresses this – it suggests *not* expecting things to be the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 願意嘗試不熟悉的食物** (Being willing to try unfamiliar food): While being open to new experiences is good, it doesn't directly address the issue of avoiding disappointment from cultural differences.
* **C: 遵守與居住地相同的法律** (Following the same laws as your home): The passage states that laws *will* be different, so this is incorrect.
* **D: 避免事先研究住宿** (Avoiding researching accommodation beforehand): This is a bad idea! Researching accommodation is important for a smooth trip.

Therefore, the only option that directly aligns with the passage's advice is to adjust your expectations to the local norms.
"
根據文中的資訊，什麼樣的人在去他鄉旅行時可能會感到失望？,"The correct answer is **C: 思想封閉的人 (People with a closed mind)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that things will be different when traveling. It emphasizes the importance of remembering this difference to avoid disappointment or *disliking the local way of doing things*. Someone with a closed mind would be more likely to resist these differences and therefore more likely to feel disappointed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 喜歡異國食物的人 (People who love foreign food):**  The passage mentions food as a difference, but it doesn't imply that *liking* foreign food would lead to disappointment.
* **B: 在變化中茁壯成長的人 (People who thrive in change):** This is the opposite of what might cause disappointment. Someone who thrives in change would likely adapt well.
* **D: 喜歡學習的人 (People who like to learn):** The passage encourages being mindful of differences, which aligns with a learning mindset.  A person who likes to learn would likely find the differences interesting rather than disappointing.



"
對於首次到訪發展中國家的旅客，不推薦以下哪項建議？,"The correct answer is **B: 避免在前幾天亂買食物 (Avoid buying food randomly in the first few days)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes adapting to a new culture and being cautious about unfamiliar environments.**  Buying food randomly in a developing country *without understanding local customs, food safety practices, or hygiene standards* is a significant cultural risk.  It could easily lead to illness.
* **The other options are all recommended in the passage:**
    * **A:**  Knowing the local animal life before sleeping on the ground is directly related to safety.
    * **C:** Using a bed or hammock when camping is recommended for safety and comfort.
    * **D:** Staying in a good hotel initially is suggested for easier adaptation.

Therefore, avoiding random food purchases is the *least* recommended of the options, as it directly contradicts the passage's overall theme of cautious adaptation to a new and potentially risky environment.
"
在適應發展中國家時，沒有提到在以下哪一項東西上揮霍金錢？,"The correct answer is **C: 露營用床墊或墊子 (Camping mattress or pad)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly recommends spending money on Western-style hotels, restaurants, and *services* to help with cultural adjustment. It also suggests buying a folding bed or hammock for outdoor camping to avoid animals. However, it doesn't specifically say to spend extra money on a camping mattress or pad.  While a good mattress is beneficial for comfort, the passage focuses on safety from animals in outdoor settings, not specifically on the *quality* of the mattress itself.  The other options – Western food, good service, and quality hotels – are all presented as ways to ease the initial shock of cultural differences.



"
以下何者最適合想要保單虛擬副本但可能無法存取網路的投保人？,"The best answer is **C: 將副本儲存在筆電的記憶體中 (Storing a copy on the laptop's memory)**.

Here's why:

* **The question specifies a potential lack of internet access.** Options B and D rely on internet connectivity to access the email or cloud storage, which may not be available.
* **Option A (giving a copy to a travel companion) is good, but doesn't address the need for *personal* access if you can't connect to the internet.**  If you lose your travel companion, you're out of luck.
* **Option C directly addresses the need for offline access.** Storing the copy on a laptop's memory ensures it's accessible even without an internet connection.  This aligns perfectly with the scenario described in the question.
* **Option B (emailing yourself) is also reliant on internet access.**
* **Option D (cloud storage) is reliant on internet access.**

Therefore, storing the copy on the laptop's memory is the most reliable solution for someone who might not have internet access.
"
根據這段文字，以下何者不需要顯示在保單上？,"The correct answer is **D: 投保人的電子郵件地址**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states the policy copy should include:

*   保險公司的電子郵件地址 (Insurance company's email address)
*   國際電話號碼，以便諮詢/授權和申請理賠 (International phone number for consultation/authorization and claims)

It also mentions keeping copies in multiple places. While the policy *might* contain the insured's email address, the provided text *doesn't require it to be on the policy itself*. The emphasis is on having contact information *from the insurance company*.

Therefore, the insured's email address is not a requirement according to the text."
根據這段文字，哪種負片尺寸反映了最常用的底片格式？,"The correct answer is **D: 36 x 24 毫米負片**.

The passage explicitly states: ""標準的 35 公釐底片 (36×24 公釐負片) 是最常見的。"" which translates to ""The standard 35mm film (36x24mm negative) is the most common.""
"
以下哪種底片格式提供近似於數位單眼相機的解析度？,"The correct answer is **A: 35 毫米底片**.

The passage states: ""標準的 35 公釐底片 (36×24 公釐負片) 是最常見的。 用完時，補充起來通常相當簡單，解析度堪可比擬現代的數位單眼相機。""  This directly states that 35mm film has resolution comparable to modern digital single-lens reflex (SLR) cameras.
"
根據這段文字，何者將是進入遊記寫作產業的最後一步？,"The correct answer is **C: 建立自己的網站 (Build your own website)**.

The passage states the process is:

1.  Practice on well-known travel blogs.
2.  Become familiar with online formatting and editing.
3.  Potentially build your own website.

Therefore, building your own website is presented as the final step.
"
進入遊記寫作產業時，應該首先完善以下哪些能力？,"The correct answer is **A: 寫部落格**.

Here's why:

* **The premise of the statement is that practicing on established travel blogs is the easiest entry point.** This implies that you first need to *write* blog posts.
* While B (formatting) and C (editing) are helpful skills *for* blogging, they are secondary to actually creating the content.
* D (building a website) is the final step, not the first.

Therefore, writing blog posts is the foundational skill needed to start and develop your travel writing career, according to the provided statement.
"
腸道問題在什麼類型的氣候下很常見？,"The correct answer is **C: 炎熱的氣候 (Hot climates)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""此外，在溫暖的氣候下，細菌不但繁殖得更快，也能在體外存活較長的時間。 從而催生了「德里肚」、「法老的詛咒」、「蒙特祖瑪的復仇」等多種旅人腹瀉之別稱。 就像寒冷氣候常見的呼吸系統問題，腸道問題在炎熱氣候也相當普遍..."" (Furthermore, in warm climates, bacteria not only reproduce faster but can also survive longer outside the body. This has led to various names for traveler's diarrhea, such as ""Delhi Belly"", ""Pharaoh's Curse"", and ""Montezuma's Revenge"". Just like respiratory problems are common in cold climates, intestinal problems are also quite common in hot climates...)
"
根據這段文字，經常接觸什麼東西會對它產生免疫力？,"The correct answer is **B: 在地細菌 (Local bacteria)**.

The passage states: ""由於在家持續接觸在地細菌，您很有可能已經對它們免疫了。"" which translates to ""Because you continuously expose yourself to local bacteria at home, you are very likely to have become immune to them."""
以下何者是在申根區內旅行的優點？,"The best answer is **A: 避免多次申請簽證** and **C: 避免多次護照檢查**.

Here's why:

* **A: 避免多次申請簽證** - The text explicitly states that a Schengen visa eliminates the need to apply for visas for each individual Schengen country.
* **C: 避免多次護照檢查** - The text clearly explains that once you are within the Schengen area, you generally don't have to go through passport control checks again.
* **B: 省錢** - While avoiding multiple visa applications *can* save money, the text doesn't explicitly state this as a direct benefit.
* **D: 無護照要求** -  The text implies you *do* need a passport (for entry and identification), it doesn't say there's no passport requirement.

Therefore, the most accurate answers based *directly* on the text are A and C. Since the question asks to choose *one*, and A is a more direct and specific benefit highlighted in the text compared to C, **A** is the slightly better choice. However, both A and C are valid benefits.



"
圖坦卡門墓中再也找不到什麼東西？,"The correct answer is **D: 財富 (Treasure)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""陵墓裡各種令人歎為觀止的財富已不在陵墓內，而是被移往在開羅的埃及博物館。"" (The various awe-inspiring treasures within the tomb are no longer within the tomb, but have been moved to the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.)

While the passage mentions the mummy's head and shoulders, it doesn't say those are *no longer* found in the tomb. It states that the treasures are missing.
"
根據這段文字，溫哥華哪個目的地對注重價格的旅客最沒有吸引力？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 惠斯勒 (Whistler)**.

The text explicitly states: ""託 2010 冬季奧運的福，距離溫哥華車程 1.5 小時的惠斯勒又貴又出名。"" (Thanks to the 2010 Winter Olympics, Whistler, 1.5 hours from Vancouver, is both expensive and famous.)

Therefore, Whistler is the least attractive destination for budget-conscious travelers.
"
根據這段文字，哪個目的地最有可能賦予旅客真實的溫哥華體驗？,"The correct answer is **A: 寶雲島 (Seabrow Island)**.

Here's why:

* **The text specifically describes Seabrow Island as a ""道地社區"" (authentic community).** This suggests it offers a more genuine and local experience.
* **The text lists a variety of activities available on Seabrow Island** (canoeing, hiking, shopping, dining), hinting at a community feel and a diverse experience beyond just skiing or snowboarding.
* **Whistler is described as ""expensive and famous,""** which implies a more touristy and potentially less authentic experience.
* **Granville Island is just a transportation point** to reach Seabrow Island.
* **Downtown Vancouver is the starting point of the water taxi**, not a destination in itself.



"
根據這段文字，如果追求一覽無遺的景色，旅客應該何時到訪瀑布？,"The correct answer is **D: 除雨季之外 (Except during the rainy season)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""雨季（十一月至三月）水量會高出許多，瀑布會更加壯觀。不過，正因為水量太大，觀看瀑布本身的視線會被大量的水遮蔽！"" (During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume will be much higher, and the waterfall will be more spectacular. However, precisely because the water volume is so high, the view of the waterfall itself will be obscured by a large amount of water!)

This means that to have a clear, unobstructed view of the waterfall, you should visit *outside* of the rainy season (November to March).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 十一月至三月 (November to March):** This is *when* the waterfall is most spectacular in terms of volume, but not ideal for viewing the waterfall *itself*.
* **B: 旅遊旺季 (Peak tourist season):** The text doesn't give any information about peak tourist season, so this is irrelevant.
* **C: 當水量多時 (When the water volume is high):**  High water volume obscures the view of the waterfall.



"
根據這段文字，在十一月至三月期間參觀維多利亞瀑布有什麼優點？,"The correct answer is **C: 壯麗的瀑布景觀 (Magnificent waterfall view)**.

The passage states: ""雨季（十一月至三月）水量會高出許多，瀑布會更加壯觀."" (During the rainy season (November to March), the water volume is much higher, and the waterfall becomes even more magnificent.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 一覽無遺的瀑布景觀 (Panoramic waterfall view):** The passage explicitly says the water can obscure the view of the waterfall itself.
*   **B: 寥寥無幾的遊客 (Few tourists):** The passage describes Victoria Falls as a ""熱門的旅遊地點"" (popular tourist destination).
*   **D: 避開雨季 (Avoid the rainy season):** The question asks for the *advantage* of visiting *during* the rainy season.



"
根據這段文字，使用無人機拍攝時，不建議使用以下何者？,"The correct answer is **D: 僅在無人機不會引起注意的人群擁擠區拍攝 (Only filming in crowded areas where the drone won't attract attention)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""將無人機開到機場附近或飛過人群上方，就算不違反所在地法律，此舉幾乎都是壞主意。"" (Flying a drone near an airport or over a crowd, even if it doesn't violate local laws, is almost always a bad idea.)

This directly contradicts option D, which suggests it's okay to film in crowded areas as long as the drone doesn't attract attention. The passage warns against such actions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 提前檢查可以拍攝的內容 (Checking what can be filmed in advance):** The passage says you *must* check what you're allowed to film.
* **B: 取得額外授權 (Obtaining additional authorization):**  The passage stresses the importance of getting necessary permissions.
* **C: 研究許可證 (Researching licenses):** The passage also emphasizes the need to research and understand licensing requirements.



"
根據這段文字，使用無人機拍攝的最佳地點在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **D: 事先取得許可的地區 (Areas where permission is obtained in advance)**.

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes the importance of checking regulations and obtaining necessary permissions *before* using a drone.
* It warns against flying near airports or over crowds, even if it's technically legal.
* This directly implies that the best places to fly are those where permission has been secured.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 靠近不介意無人機存在的人群 (Near crowds who don't mind drones):** The text explicitly advises *against* flying over crowds.
* **B: 不允許一般攝影的區域 (Areas where general photography is not allowed):** The text states that regulations for general photography apply to videography, and often have *more* restrictions.
* **C: 在無人機不太明顯的繁忙之地 (In busy places where drones are not easily noticeable):** This is risky and likely illegal, as it could violate airspace regulations or privacy laws.



Therefore, obtaining permission is the key to safe and legal drone usage, making option D the most accurate answer.
"
根據這段文字，關於簽證程序的註冊要求，哪種說法為非？,"The correct answer is **B: 所有國家/地區都要求向當地政府機關登記註冊 (All countries require registration with the local government authorities.)**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""在某些國家/地區，你必須向當地政府機關登記入境和您的住宿地址。"" (In some countries, you must register your entry and your accommodation address with the local government authorities.) This uses the word ""某些"" (some), indicating it's not a universal requirement.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 如果您住在遊客住宿處，您可能不需要登記 (If you are staying in tourist accommodation, you may not need to register.)** - The text states this directly.
* **C: 可能需要走一趟移民局 (You may need to visit the immigration office.)** - The text mentions this as a possibility.
* **D: 在某些地方，當地飯店可以處理登記註冊 (In some places, local hotels can handle the registration.)** - The text explicitly states this.

Therefore, only option B is incorrect because the text clearly indicates that registration isn't a requirement in *all* countries.
"
以下何者不是遊客可能去辦理登記註冊的地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 當地郵局 (Local Post Office)**.

The text explicitly states that tourists may need to go to:

* **當地警局 (Local Police Station)**
* **移民局 (Immigration Office)**
* **他們住的飯店 (Their Hotel)**

The text **does not mention** the local post office as a place to register. Therefore, it's the correct answer to the question.
"
誰不會因旅行時參加志願活動而受益？,"The correct answer is **B: 追求豐厚薪水的人 (People who seek a generous salary)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""由於許多志願性的工作均提供食宿，而少數工作還支付微薄薪水..."" (Because many volunteer jobs offer food and lodging, and a few pay a meager salary...). This indicates that volunteer travel is *not* about earning a substantial income.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 希望結交新朋友的人會出國 (People who want to make new friends will go abroad):** The passage mentions ""認識新朋友 (meeting new friends)"" as a benefit.
* **C: 希望獲得新技能的人 (People who want to acquire new skills):** The passage directly states ""獲得新技能的一個好方法 (a good way to acquire new skills).""
* **D: 對食宿可能感興趣的人 (People who might be interested in food and lodging):** The passage highlights that many volunteer jobs *do* offer food and lodging.



Therefore, only those seeking a high salary would *not* benefit from participating in volunteer travel, as it's generally not a financially rewarding option."
根據這段文字，在國外做志工對預算有限的旅客有什麼好處？,"The correct answer is **C: 有時會提供食宿 (Sometimes provides food and lodging)**.

The text explicitly states: ""由於許多志願性的工作均提供食宿..."" which translates to ""Because many volunteer jobs offer food and lodging...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 幾乎都有給薪 (Almost always pays)** - The text says ""少數工作還支付微薄薪水 (a few jobs even pay a meager wage)"", so this is incorrect.
* **B: 通常會帶來工作機會 (Usually brings job opportunities)** - While volunteering *is* a job, the text doesn't say it *usually* brings job opportunities. It focuses on the benefits of the volunteer experience itself.
* **D: 可以幫助取得看事情的某種角度 (Can help gain a certain perspective on things)** - The text mentions this as *one* of the benefits, but it's not the *primary* benefit related to budget.  The food and lodging are the direct budget benefit.



"
根據這段文字，何者可能被認為是一般前往迪士尼世界旅行的非典型行程？,"The correct answer is **B: 住在園區外的飯店 (Staying at a hotel outside the resort)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the ""most typical"" itinerary includes:

* Flying into Orlando International Airport.
* Taking a bus to Disney resorts.
* Spending a week in the Disney parks.
* Returning home.

Option B, staying at a hotel *outside* the Disney resort, deviates from this ""typical"" itinerary because the passage explicitly mentions traveling *to* Disney resorts via bus.  While not impossible, it's less common and therefore less ""typical.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在迪士尼園區玩上一週 (Spending a week in the Disney parks)** - This is explicitly mentioned as part of the typical itinerary.
* **C: 在迪士尼園區度過整個旅程 (Spending the entire trip in the Disney parks)** - While not a detailed aspect of the ""typical"" itinerary, it aligns with the general concept of a trip centered around the parks.
* **D: 從機場坐巴士到飯店 (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel)** - This is explicitly mentioned as part of the typical itinerary.



"
關於迪士尼世界的陳述中，以下何者為非？,"The correct answer is **A: 跨園門票可轉讓給其他旅客 (Cross-park tickets can be transferred to other travelers)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""迪士尼禁止這種行為，因為門票是不可轉讓的 (Disney prohibits this practice because tickets are non-transferable).""  Therefore, option A is the *opposite* of what's true according to the passage.

Here's why the other options are correct:

* **B: 園區內提供住宿 (Resort accommodations are available within the parks)** - The passage mentions ""搭巴士前往迪士尼飯店 (taking a bus to Disney hotels)"".
* **C: 有巴士可將旅客從機場載送到住宿 (Buses are available to transport guests from the airport to their accommodations)** -  The passage directly states this: ""飛往奧蘭多國際機場、搭巴士前往迪士尼飯店 (flying to Orlando International Airport, taking a bus to Disney hotels)"".
* **D: 經常可以在拍賣網站上找到多日聯票 (Multi-day tickets are frequently found on auction websites)** - The passage says this explicitly: ""許多在 eBay 或 Craigslist 等拍賣網站上賣出的票券，是已被使用過一部分的主題樂園多日聯票 (Many tickets sold on eBay or Craigslist are used multi-day theme park tickets)"".



"
根據這段文字，在專業培訓課程或出版物中最有可能沒有涵蓋以下哪個問題？,"The correct answer is **A: 荒野求生 (Wilderness survival)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that books and magazines about wilderness survival are *common*, while publications about war zones are *rare*. 
* The text highlights that ""荒野求生的書籍和雜誌很常見，但是涉及戰區的出版物卻很少"" (Books and magazines about wilderness survival are common, but publications involving war zones are rare).
* The text details the content of professional training courses, which includes role-playing, extensive first aid training, and sometimes weapons training, all directly related to war zones.

Therefore, based on the information provided, wilderness survival is the least likely topic to be covered in professional training courses or publications focusing on war zones. The other options are explicitly mentioned as being included."
根據這段文字，專業培訓課程最有可能涵蓋以下哪些科目？,"The best answer is **A: 急救** and **B: 戰區**. Here's why:

* **A: 急救 (First Aid):** The text explicitly states ""大量的急救訓練 (a lot of first aid training)"" as a core component of the courses.
* **B: 戰區 (War Zones):** The entire premise of the text revolves around planning to travel to war zones and the need for training specific to those environments. The phrase ""敵意環境課程 (hostile environment courses)"" directly points to this.
* **C: 荒野求生 (Wilderness Survival):** While wilderness survival is mentioned as readily available in books and magazines, the text distinguishes it from war zone training, implying it's not a primary focus of the professional courses.
* **D: 惡劣的環境 (Harsh Environments):** While war zones are harsh environments, the training is *specific* to the dangers and challenges of a conflict zone, not just any harsh environment. The text emphasizes the unique aspects of operating in a war zone.

Therefore, options A and B are the most accurate reflection of the information provided in the text. However, because the question asks for *which of the following* and both A and B are clearly mentioned, it is important to note that both answers are correct.

If forced to choose only one, **B: 戰區 (War Zones)** is the more encompassing and central theme of the entire passage. Therefore, it's arguably the slightly *better* answer, though including A is very accurate too.
"
根據這段文字，避開潛在污水的最佳選擇是什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 評估水中的特定威脅 (Evaluate specific threats in the water)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that different purification methods are effective against different threats.
* It highlights that boiling time varies depending on the region and the specific contaminants present.
* The passage recommends buying sealed bottled water if you have concerns, implying it's a backup option.
* It doesn't recommend a specific boiling time (1 minute or several minutes) as the *best* option universally.

Therefore, the best approach is to *evaluate* what's potentially in the water before choosing a purification method.  This allows you to choose the *most effective* method for the *specific threats* present.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 將水燒開幾分鐘 (Boiling water for several minutes):** This is a *possible* solution, but not necessarily the *best* for every situation.
* **B: 購買瓶裝水 (Buying bottled water):** This is a reliable option, but not the best *choice* if you can address the specific threat with a more suitable method.
* **C: 將水燒開一分鐘 (Boiling water for one minute):** This might be sufficient in *some* regions, but not universally, and may not address all threats.



"
根據這段文字，什麼事情是連熟練的游泳者也幾乎不可能做到的？,"The correct answer is **C: 逆著海流游回去 (Swim against the current)**.

The text explicitly states: ""大部分致死原因都是在嘗試逆著海流游回去時用盡體力，此舉成功率可能非常渺茫 (Most deaths occur from exhausting oneself while trying to swim back against the current, and the chances of success are very slim).""  This directly addresses the difficulty of swimming against the current, even for skilled swimmers.

The other options are not mentioned as being particularly difficult or impossible for a skilled swimmer.
"
如果困在海流中，該怎麼辦？,"The correct answer is **A: 試著改變方向來脫離水流，然後正常游回岸邊 (Try to change direction to escape the current, then swim back to shore normally.)**

Here's why:

* **The provided text explicitly states:** ""試著遊向一個不會再被困住的地方，或者，根據個人的游泳技術以及是否已有人注意到，也可以等待救援。"" (Try to swim towards a place where you won't be trapped again, or, depending on your swimming skills and whether someone has noticed, you can wait for rescue.) This aligns directly with option A.
* **Why other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: 逆流游得更快 (Swim faster against the current):** The text warns against this, saying it's likely to exhaust you.
    * **C: 往相反方向游泳 (Swim in the opposite direction):** While swimming in a different direction *can* help, the key is to *escape* the current, not just swim in a random opposite direction.  Option A is more precise.
    * **D: 在水面下游泳 (Swim underwater):** This is generally not recommended and can be dangerous, especially in strong currents.

Therefore, option A best reflects the advice given in the text.
"
根據這段文字，在哪個地方參觀城堡可能會是一趟值得的假期遊覽？,"The correct answer is **C: 萊茵河谷**.

The text specifically mentions visiting castles in the ""羅亞爾河谷及萊茵河谷"" (Loire Valley and Rhine Valley). Therefore, the Rhine Valley is the place where castle visits are highlighted as a vacation activity.
"
根據這段文字，以下哪個方法不推薦給在該地區旅行的女性？,"正確答案是 **A: 避免討論婚姻狀況**

這段文字明確建議所有女性遊客**自稱已婚**，並提供佩戴戒指的建議。因此，避免討論婚姻狀況與這段文字的建議是矛盾的。

其他選項都與文字內容一致：

* **B: 注意文化差異可能會導致當地人出現強硬行為**：文字明確提到要留意文化差異導致的跟蹤等情況。
* **C: 避免佩戴顯眼的珠寶**：文字建議不要戴看起來太貴的戒指，暗示避免佩戴顯眼的珠寶。
* **D: 必要時應態度強硬**：文字建議拒絕男性時要表現堅定，不要害怕堅持立場。
"
根據文中所述區域，什麼小常識對女性旅客有幫助？,"The correct answer is **B: 戴大戒指表示婚姻狀況**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""戴上一個戒指也會有所幫助 (but不要戴看起來太貴的)."" This translates to ""Wearing a ring will also be helpful (but don't wear one that looks too expensive).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 認知到遭人跟蹤並非常事** - While the text *does* mention being followed is common, it's not a ""小常識"" (small tip) to *help* female travelers. It's a warning.
* **C: 瞭解文化差異間接表明您避免堅持自己的立場** - This is the opposite of what the text suggests. The text emphasizes *firmly* refusing unwanted advances.
* **D: 不願接受男性示好，即堅決拒絕** - This isn't a ""小常識."" It's a general piece of advice about asserting oneself, but not a specific tip for navigating the region.



Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text as a helpful tip for female travelers is wearing a ring to indicate marital status."
根據這段文字，哪種情況可能需要野生動物攝影師使用專業鏡頭？,"The correct answer is **A: 如果他們正在拍攝特別小的生物 (If they are photographing particularly small creatures)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""野生動物攝影通常需要使用長焦鏡頭，而拍攝一群鳥類或一隻小型動物則需要其他鏡頭。(Wildlife photography usually requires the use of telephoto lenses, while photographing a flock of birds or a small animal requires other lenses.)""
* This directly indicates that different lenses are needed depending on the size of the animal being photographed. Smaller animals require different lenses than larger ones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 如果是商業化拍攝 (If it is commercial photography):** The text mentions commercial restrictions in parks, but doesn't directly link commercial photography to needing specific lenses.
* **C: 如果拍攝的動物很害羞 (If the animal being photographed is shy):**  Shyness relates to the difficulty of *getting* a shot, not the type of lens needed.
* **D: 如果公園對野生動物攝影有特殊規定 (If the park has special regulations for wildlife photography):** Park regulations don't dictate lens choice.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**.
"
文中沒有提到以下何者對野生動物攝影師來說是一個潛在的挑戰？,"The correct answer is **C: 採購所需的鏡頭類型 (Purchasing the required lens types)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions that wildlife photography often requires long lenses for larger animals and different lenses for birds or smaller animals.  This implies a challenge in *acquiring* the *right* lenses, not just acquiring lenses in general.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

* **A: 尋找特定的珍稀動物 (Finding specific rare animals):**  The passage states, ""許多珍稀的動物很難發現..."" (Many rare animals are difficult to find...).
* **B: 面對具攻擊性的動物 (Facing aggressive animals):** The passage says, ""野生動物可能很怕生或很有攻擊性..."" (Wildlife can be shy or aggressive...).
* **D: 在潛在的敵對環境中工作 (Working in potentially hostile environments):** The passage mentions, ""...而生存環境可能很冷、很熱或很不友善。"" (...and the living environment can be cold, hot, or unfriendly.)



Therefore, option C is the only one *not* directly addressed as a challenge in the text.
"
以下何者可能最不會對途經山口的司機造成問題？,"The correct answer is **A: 塞車 (Traffic jams)**.

Here's why:

* **B: 低摩擦力 (Low friction)** is a direct consequence of ice and snow, making driving dangerous.
* **C: 過度冷凝作用 (Excessive condensation)** and **D: 可見度降低 (Reduced visibility)** are both direct hazards caused by cold temperatures and precipitation.
* **A: 塞車 (Traffic jams)** can happen for many reasons, not just weather. While weather *can* contribute to traffic jams, it's not a guaranteed or primary consequence of mountainous weather conditions. The question asks which is *least likely* to cause problems *specifically due to the weather*.

Therefore, traffic jams are the least directly and consistently linked to the conditions described in the prompt.
"
關於各國的所得稅，何者可能保持一致？,"The correct answer is **A: 稅率**.

Here's why:

* **稅率 (Tax rates)** are the percentage charged on taxable income. While tax structures and brackets vary greatly, countries often have similar *rates* for certain income levels, especially for basic income ranges.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **所得稅結構 (Income tax structure)** - This refers to the overall system of how income is taxed (e.g., progressive, regressive, flat).  These structures differ significantly between countries.
* **申報所得稅的地方 (Where to file taxes)** - The location where you file taxes is often determined by residency and the country's tax laws, but it's not necessarily consistent across countries.
* **等級差異 (Bracket differences)** - Tax brackets (the ranges of income taxed at different rates) vary drastically between countries.



Therefore, while tax *rates* might have some similarities, the other options are generally less likely to be consistent across all countries.

根據這段文字，如果你在海外工作，但居住在他處，你可能會在哪裡申報所得稅？,"The correct answer is **A: 居住國家 (Your country of residence)**.

The passage states: ""除非你是外交官，否則在海外工作通常表示你必須在所在國家申報所得稅。"" This means you report to the country where you are considered a tax resident, not necessarily where you work. The passage also mentions that in federal countries like the US and Canada, both federal and local governments can tax income, but the key is residency.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 美國 (United States)** - While the US is mentioned as an example, it's not the only possibility and the passage doesn't say you *must* report to the US.
* **C: 目前工作的國家 (The country you are currently working in)** - The passage directly contradicts this; it says you usually report to your country of residence.
* **D: 所得稅最低的地方 (The place with the lowest income tax)** - The passage doesn't suggest this is a factor or a requirement.

關於世界博覽會的敘述，以下何者不正確？,"The incorrect statement about World Expos is **B: 植物展覽品與藝術及教育展覽品一起陳列 (Plant exhibits and art & education exhibits are displayed together)**.

Here's why:

* **The text clearly states:** World Expos are a large-scale international *art and science* exhibition.  While there *might* be botanical gardens or plant displays *within* a national pavilion, the core focus of the World Expo isn't to display plant exhibits alongside art and educational exhibits. They are distinct areas of focus.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the provided text:

* **A: 展覽品可能會展示一個國家/地區的歷史或文化 (Exhibits may showcase a country/region's history or culture):** The text specifically mentions that participating countries use their pavilions to showcase their culture and history.
* **C: 活動可持續長達六個月 (The event can last up to six months):** The text explicitly states that Expos usually last 3 to 6 months.
* **D: 國家/地區非強迫參與 (Countries/regions are not forced to participate):** The text mentions that it's theoretically possible to hold Expos every year (just in different locations), implying voluntary participation.



Therefore, the only incorrect statement is B."
以下哪項是世界博覽會或國際博覽會的規則？,"The correct answer is **B: 同一國家不能每年舉辦活動 (Same country cannot host the event every year)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""儘管理論上可以年年舉辦（只要辦在不同國家/地區就好了），實際上則不然。"" (Although theoretically it can be held every year (as long as it is held in a different country/region), in practice, this is not the case.) This directly translates to the idea that a country can't host every year.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 展覽品必須同時展示一個國家的歷史和世界議題 (Exhibits must simultaneously display a country's history and world issues):** While the passage mentions this as a common theme, it doesn't state it's a *rule*. It describes what participating countries *often* do.
* **C: 活動必須持續長達六個月 (The event must last for at least six months):** The passage says events typically last 3 to 6 months, implying it's a common duration, but not a mandatory rule.
* **D: 為了舉辦博覽會，所有國家/地區都必須參加 (All countries/regions must participate in order to host the exposition):** The passage doesn't mention that all countries *must* participate.  Countries *choose* to participate.



Therefore, option B is the only statement presented in the passage that can be considered a practical constraint or ""rule"" of world expositions."
採取以下哪一項措施可以降低動物攻擊的可能性？,"The correct answer is **B: 清除野營地的垃圾 (Clear your campsite of food scraps)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""此外，要注意氣味會吸引熊和其他野生動物，因此請避免攜帶或烹煮氣味濃重的食物，並維持營地乾淨。"" (Furthermore, be aware that odors attract bears and other wildlife, so please avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented food, and keep your campsite clean.)
* **Option B directly addresses this:** Removing food scraps eliminates a strong attractant for animals, reducing the likelihood of them approaching and potentially attacking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 攜帶有香氣的草藥 (Carry fragrant herbs):** This would likely *attract* animals, not deter them.
* **C: 與狼保持 25 碼的距離 (Maintain a 25-yard distance from wolves):** While maintaining distance is important, 25 yards is the recommended distance for *other* wildlife in the text.  The text specifically mentions 100 yards for bears and wolves. And simply being within the recommended distance doesn't guarantee safety if an animal is agitated.
* **D: 用食物殘渣阻撓動物 (Use food scraps to deter animals):** This is the opposite of what you should do! It would *attract* the animals.



Therefore, clearing your campsite of food scraps is the most effective measure to reduce the risk of animal attacks according to the provided text.



"
文中未提到以下何者為野生動物襲擊的可能原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 不熟悉人類的動物 (Animals unfamiliar with humans)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that feeding and disturbing wildlife are wrong and can lead to incidents.** This directly addresses option C.
* **The passage repeatedly emphasizes the importance of maintaining distance from animals, especially bears and wolves.** This directly addresses option B.
* **The passage mentions that strong smells attract animals, implying that carrying or cooking strong-smelling food can be a contributing factor.** This directly addresses option A.
* **The passage *contrasts* the common habituation of animals in the park with the fact that they are still wild and potentially dangerous.**  It doesn't suggest a lack of familiarity with humans as a *cause* of attacks, but rather that even habituated animals retain their wild instincts. The danger comes from forgetting they are wild animals, not from being unfamiliar.

Therefore, the passage doesn't present a lack of familiarity as a potential cause of attacks. The danger stems from a combination of factors, primarily related to human behavior and the animals' inherent nature.



"
根據文章，以下哪個不會被認為是順利演奏手風琴的正確建議？,"The correct answer is **A: 要增大音量，請增加敲擊按鍵的力度 (To increase the volume, increase the force of pressing the keys)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""請記住，不需要像彈鋼琴一樣用力敲擊琴鍵來增加音量。(Remember, you don't need to press the keys as hard as you do on a piano to increase the volume.)""  Option A directly contradicts this advice.

The other options align with the advice given in the text:

*   **B: 為了保持耐力，請盡量減少不必要的動作 (To maintain endurance, try to minimize unnecessary movements):** This reflects the text's emphasis on relaxation.
*   **C: 注意在敲擊音符的同時維持手部放鬆 (Pay attention to maintaining relaxation in your hands while striking notes):** This is a direct quote from the text.
*   **D: 要增大音量，可更用力或更快速擠壓風箱 (To increase the volume, you can press the bellows harder or faster):** This is exactly what the text recommends.



"
當演奏手風琴時，以下哪個有助於增加音量？,"The correct answer is **B: 加大力道 (Increase the force)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""彈手風琴時，若要增大音量，可更用力或更快速擠壓風箱 (To increase the volume when playing the accordion, you can press the bellows harder or faster).""

While increasing speed can contribute to volume, the core principle is increased force on the bellows. The passage also directly contradicts reducing force.
"
電視上的影像為什麼要裁剪邊框？,"The correct answer is **B: 讓影像填滿整個螢幕 (To fill the entire screen)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that television programs are often ""over-scanned"" – meaning edges are cropped – to ensure the image fills the entire screen.  This is done to make the image look more visually appealing on a variety of screen sizes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 為了容納字幕 (To accommodate subtitles):** While subtitle placement is a concern, the primary reason for cropping is to fill the screen, not specifically for subtitles. The passage points out that cropping can *prevent* full subtitle display.
* **C: 為了方便轉換成其他格式 (To facilitate conversion to other formats):**  Cropping is *not* done for ease of conversion. It's a production decision related to how the program is intended to be viewed on television.
* **D: 為了避免字幕太靠近底部 (To prevent subtitles from being too close to the bottom):** This is the opposite of the reason.  Cropping can *cause* subtitles to be too close to the bottom.



"
根據文章，將電影轉換為 DVD 格式可能會遇到以下哪些問題？,"The correct answers are **B: 部分字幕會被裁減** and **D: 裁剪邊框**.

Here's why:

* **B: 部分字幕會被裁減:** The passage explicitly states that if subtitles are too close to the bottom of the screen, they won't be fully visible after DVD conversion due to cropping.
* **D: 裁剪邊框:** The passage discusses ""overscan"" on TV being a common practice to fill the screen.  The problem with DVD conversion is that this overscan can lead to the edges of the image (including the borders) being cropped.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 影像未填滿整個螢幕:** The problem is the opposite - the image *can* be cropped, leaving parts of the image off-screen.
* **C: 影像填滿整個螢幕:**  This is what overscan aims for, but the problem *after* DVD conversion is that the image isn't always filled, and sometimes important elements like subtitles are cut off.

Therefore, options B and D are the most accurate reflections of the problems described in the passage."
英國駐軍在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **C: 博登敦鎮 (Bordentown)**.

The passage states: ""約翰·卡德瓦爾德 (John Cadwalder) 將軍將對在博登敦 (Bordentown) 的英國駐軍發動牽制攻擊..."" This directly tells us where the British troops are located.
"
手寫草案上出現了誰的簽名？,"The correct answer is **D: 查爾斯·湯姆森 (Charles Thomson)**.

The passage explicitly states the handwritten draft was signed by **John Hancock** and **Charles Thomson**. John Dunlap was the printer, and George Washington received a copy later. John Nixon read it publicly.
"
在以下地點中，哪個地方最後收到當列普單面印刷版？,"The correct answer is **C: 倫敦 (London)**.

The passage states: ""A copy arrived in London on August 10th."" This is the last location mentioned as receiving a copy of the Dunlap broadside.
"
史塔克上校的的部隊位於哪裡？,"The correct answer is **A: 北端柵欄沿線的位置 (The location along the northern end of the fence)**.

The passage states: ""史塔克的人馬佔領了殖民軍據點北端柵欄沿線的位置"" which translates to ""Stark's men occupied the location along the northern end of the fence.""
"
根據文章，史塔克的手下什麼時候擴展了他們的柵欄？,"The correct answer is **C: 退潮時 (At low tide)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""他們利用這個時機迅速建造小石牆，將圍牆延伸到北方河流末端的小沙灘上。""  (They took advantage of this opportunity to quickly build a stone wall, extending the wall to the small beach at the northern end of the river.)  The ""this opportunity"" refers to the low tide.
"
根據文章，以下哪個是中國最動盪的時期之一？,"The correct answer is **D: 三國時期 (Three Kingdoms Period)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""其中最著名的就是漢朝和晉朝之間 60 年的三國時代。 三國是中國古代歷史上最血腥的時代之一..."" (The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period between the Han and Jin dynasties. The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history...).

While the other options are mentioned, the passage directly identifies the Three Kingdoms period as one of the most turbulent.
"
根據文章，關於螞蟻大軍群體進入游獵階段，以下敘述何者為真？,"The correct answer is **B: 牠們糧食供應不足 (They have a shortage of food)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the colony enters the nomadic phase **""when food supply decreases""**. This directly links the entry into the nomadic phase to a lack of food.
* Option A is incorrect because the passage says they *move* at night in the hunting phase, not build nests.
* Option C is incorrect because the 17-day duration applies to the nomadic *migration*, not the nest-building cycle.
* Option D is incorrect because the passage states they *stop* to camp during the day in the hunting phase.



"
根據文章，以下哪種說法正確反映了螞蟻大軍在遊牧階段的築巢習性？,"The correct answer is **C: 牠們每天更換巢穴**.

The passage states: ""在此階段，殖民地居民建築起**暫時性的住所**，並且**每天變換**。"" This translates to: ""In this stage, the colony residents build **temporary dwellings**, and **change them daily**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 牠們在夜間築巢 (They nest at night)** - The passage says they move at night during the hunting phase, but doesn't mention nesting during the nomadic phase.
* **B: 牠們能行進 17 天期間不築巢 (They can travel 17 days without nesting)** - The passage explicitly states they build temporary dwellings.
* **D: 牠們在整個階段中使用相同的巢穴 (They use the same nest throughout the phase)** - The passage clearly states they change nests daily.



"
儘管出現外在信號，以下何者會繼續運行？,"The correct answer is **C: 生理時鐘 (Physiological clock)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that physiological clocks are ""self-sustaining oscillators."" This means they continue to function even without external cues.
*  While external signals (like light or temperature) can *entrain* the physiological clock to the environment and influence the timing of rhythms, the clock itself persists and keeps running independently.
* The other options are related but not the core element that continues to function when external signals are absent:
    * **內生性週期 (Endogenous rhythm):** This is the *output* of the physiological clock - the cyclical pattern.  The clock *generates* the rhythm.
    * **週期性節奏 (Cyclic rhythm):** This is a general term for any repeating pattern.  The physiological clock *creates* cyclic rhythms.
    * **觀察到的節奏 (Observed rhythms):** These are the rhythms that scientists see. They are a result of the physiological clock and its interactions with the environment.



Therefore, the physiological clock is the fundamental mechanism that continues to operate despite the absence of external signals.



"
哪個術語描述了呈現特定表徵多種差異的個體？,"The correct answer is **D: 多態性 (Polymorphism)**.

Here's why:

* **多態性 (Polymorphism)** specifically refers to the presence of multiple forms or variations of a trait within a population. The question asks for the term describing individuals with multiple differences in a particular characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **單型性 (Monomorphism)**: This refers to the state where all individuals in a population have the *same* characteristic, the opposite of what the question asks.
* **生物 (Organism/生物)**: This is a general term for a living being and doesn't describe variation in a specific trait.
* **物種 (Species)**: This refers to a group of organisms capable of interbreeding and producing fertile offspring. While related to variation, it's not the term for variation *within* a group.



"
關於佔據特定區域的生物，以下何者為正確術語？,"The correct answer is **B: 族群 (Population)**.

Here's why:

* **族群 (Population)** is defined as a group of individuals of the same species living in the same geographic area. This directly matches the definition provided in the question.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **單型性 (Monotony)** refers to a lack of variation; all individuals are the same. While related to the concept of a population, it doesn't describe the group itself.
* **物種 (Species)** is a broader category, referring to a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. A population is a *group within* a species.
* **多態性 (Polymorphism)** refers to the presence of multiple forms or variations of a trait within a population. It describes the *variation* within a population, not the population itself.



"
以下哪種不是以自然為主題的旅遊活動範例？,"The correct answer is **C: 參觀科學博物館 (Visiting a science museum)**.

Here's why:

* **以自然為主題的旅遊 (Nature-based tourism)** focuses on experiencing and appreciating the natural world.
* **健行到瀑布 (Hiking to a waterfall), 拍攝野花 (Photographing wildflowers), and 釣魚 (Fishing)** all directly involve interaction with and observation of nature.
* **參觀科學博物館 (Visiting a science museum)**, while potentially *containing* exhibits about nature, is primarily focused on scientific concepts and explanations. It's an indoor activity and doesn't primarily revolve around experiencing nature *in situ*.

Therefore, a science museum visit is the least aligned with a nature-based tourism theme.
"
根據文章，以下哪個是交通系統的基礎？,"The correct answer is **B: 私家車 (Private cars)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""他們的出發地正是另一批人的工作目的地。 在這種繁忙的交通往來中，每個人都與這個**以私家車為基礎的交通系統**有某種程度的連結..."" This directly identifies private cars as the foundation of the transportation system being described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 工作目的地 (Work destinations):** While work destinations are part of the system, they are *dependent* on the cars, not the foundation of the system itself.
* **C: 穩定的生物圈 (Stable biosphere):** The passage states the carbon economy is destabilizing the biosphere, not that the biosphere is the foundation of the transportation system.
* **D: 人類演進 (Human evolution):** Human evolution is mentioned as a historical context, but it's not the foundation of the *current* transportation system.



"
環繞原子核的粒子具有哪種電荷？,"The correct answer is **C: 負電荷**.

The passage states: ""電子則具有負電荷."" (Electrons have a negative charge.)
"
原子核由哪些粒子組成？,"The correct answer is **A: 質子和中子 (Protons and neutrons)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""原子核由中子和質子兩種粒子組成。"" (The atomic nucleus is composed of two types of particles: neutrons and protons.)
"
根據文章，下列哪個是五位元二進制的例子？,"The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Five-bit binary** means a number represented using five binary digits (bits).
* **1010** is four bits.
* **12001** is six bits.
* **110101** is six bits.
* **10010** is exactly five bits.
"
二進位數也被稱為什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 位元 (Bit)**.

The question directly asks what binary numbers are also called. The passage explicitly states that binary digits are called ""位元"" (bits) in computer terminology.
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為學生寫部落格的主要好處？,"The correct answer is **B: 減少來自同儕的批評 (Reduce criticism from peers)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that having an audience (readers) *generally* leads students to improve their writing to avoid criticism.  It doesn't say that criticism is *reduced* by blogging. In fact, the opposite is implied.
* The passage explicitly mentions the benefits of improved grammar and writing skills (A), understanding the world (C), and fostering a desire for continuous learning (D).

Therefore, the passage does *not* say that blogging reduces criticism from peers; it suggests the opposite.



"
寫部落格的哪個方面被引用為學生提高寫作能力的動力？,"The correct answer is **B: 避免批評的慾望**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""由於學生通常是最挑剔的讀者，因此部落客作者們會開始努力加強寫作以避免被批評。"" (Because students are usually the most critical readers, bloggers will start to work hard to improve their writing to avoid being criticized.)

While other options are mentioned as *benefits* of blogging, the passage specifically links the *motivation* for improving writing skills to the desire to avoid criticism from their audience.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 頻繁回應網路上的材料 (Frequently responding to online materials):** This is a *result* of blogging, not the direct motivation for improving writing.
* **C: 維持他們受眾的興趣 (Maintaining their audience's interest):**  This is a *reason* for engaging with their audience, but not the core driver for improving writing mechanics.
* **D: 合作的需要 (The need for collaboration):** While blogging *can* be collaborative, the passage doesn't directly tie this to improving writing skills.
"
以下哪一項並非非同步交流對學生的好處？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 隨時面對面與教師接觸 (Being able to meet the teacher face-to-face at any time)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt describes asynchronous communication as allowing time for reflection and control over the pace of learning.**  This is directly opposed to the ability to meet face-to-face at any time, which is a characteristic of synchronous communication (like in-person class or video conferencing).
* **The prompt highlights benefits like flexibility and access to information via the internet.** These are all features of asynchronous learning environments.

Let's look at why the other options are benefits of asynchronous communication mentioned in the text:

* **A: 使用網際網路作為資源 (Using the internet as a resource):** The text explicitly mentions the internet and the World Wide Web providing constant access to information.
* **C: 靈活的工作時間 (Flexible work time):** The text directly states that asynchronous communication allows for more flexible work schedules.
* **D: 步調控制 (Pace control):**  The text explicitly states that asynchronous communication allows students to learn at their own pace and control the presentation speed of information.



"
根據文章，以下非同步交流的哪個方面對學生並不彈性？,"The correct answer is **C: 教材 (Curriculum)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that asynchronous communication allows students to ""learn at their own pace"" and ""control the pace at which instructional information is presented."" This directly relates to **learning pace** and **time flexibility**.
* The passage highlights the benefit of having readily available information via the internet and quick responses from teachers, which relates to **work time** and **access to information**.
* The passage *doesn't* mention anything about students having control over the **curriculum (教材)** itself. It implies the curriculum is pre-determined.

Therefore, the only aspect of asynchronous communication that isn't presented as flexible in the passage is the curriculum.
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為中世紀城堡的相關事物？,"The correct answer is **D: 騎士 (Knights)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions and evokes:
    * **地牢坑 (Dungeons):** ""感受到來自地牢坑裡的恐懼氣息"" -  The passage describes the feeling of dread associated with dungeons.
    * **馬上長槍比武 (Jousting):** ""馬上長槍比武"" -  The passage directly mentions jousting as an image associated with castles.
    * **騎士精神 (Chivalry):** ""亞瑟王時代騎士精神"" - The passage mentions chivalry as a common association with castles.

* While knights are intrinsically linked to castles and the medieval period, the passage focuses on the *imagined* associations and the *physical reality* of the castles themselves. It doesn't specifically list knights as a thing *mentioned in the passage* as an element of castles. The passage discusses the *feeling* and *evocation* of the medieval period which includes knights, but doesn't focus on them explicitly in the text.

Therefore, ""騎士"" is the only option not directly mentioned or evoked within the provided text.
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為城堡遺址中聞到的味道或聽到的聲音？,"The correct answer is **C: 宴會**.

The passage mentions hearing ""the sounds of ancient warfare"" and ""the scent of fear from the dungeon pits,"" and feeling ""the sound of hooves on cobblestones."" However, it only mentions the *imagining* of feasts and doesn't state that those are actually detectable at the castle ruins. Therefore, a feast is the thing *not* mentioned as a scent or sound associated with the ruins.
"
以下哪一項是對柯比莫斯洛城堡的正確描述？,"The correct answer is **B: 國家一直以來都很和平，因此建造城堡時，僅需最低程度的防禦工事**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""1480 年代，當黑斯廷斯爵士開始建造這座城堡時，國家當時相對來說和平，只需要抵禦一些四處遊走的小群掠奪者。"" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 城堡的厚牆是由黑斯廷斯爵士所要求的:** The passage states the walls were thin and unsuitable for prolonged sieges, contradicting this.
* **C: 城堡並非當時典型的建築物:** The passage says it was ""極為典型，比較像是加強防守的住家，而非真正的城堡,"" meaning it *was* typical of a certain type of structure.
* **D: 它是為了承受長時間和猛攻所建造的:** The passage states the walls were thin and would not withstand prolonged sieges, making this incorrect.



"
就文中所述當時的柯比莫斯洛城堡而言，以下哪項描述為非典型的建築特徵？,"The correct answer is **B: 為承受攻擊所建的地基 (Foundations built to withstand attack)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the castle was ""strengthened for defense, rather than a true castle."" 
* It highlights the lack of strong defenses: ""large glass windows and thin walls could not withstand prolonged assaults.""
* The text mentions the castle was built in a period of relative peace, requiring defense against ""small bands of raiders"" rather than major sieges.

Therefore, the features that *are* described as typical are the large windows, the lack of strong defense, and the thin walls.  A foundation built to withstand attack would be a *typical* feature of a proper castle, not a description of the typical features of this relatively peaceful period fortification.

So the answer is **B**.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項最有益於準備新賽季的跑者？,"The correct answer is **A: 夏天練習越野長跑**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""冬天適度的越野長跑，加上強化上身的體操訓練，是為跑季準備的最佳方式。"" (Moderate cross-country long runs in winter, combined with upper body gymnastics training, are the best way to prepare for the running season.)
* While upper body training (D) is mentioned, it's only as part of the broader recommendation of cross-country running.
* The passage argues that while speed is important, endurance is *essential* with the increased distance. Option B (focusing on speed) is directly contradicted by the passage's emphasis on endurance.
* Option C (running in three minutes) is a specific time and not a training method recommended in the passage.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of the advice given in the text.
"
根據文章，以下哪個對於一流的半英里賽跑者來說最重要？,"The correct answer is **B: 培養耐力勝過速度 (Cultivating endurance is more important than speed)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""速度的重要性變得越來越低，耐力變成為絕對必要的條件。"" (The importance of speed is decreasing, and endurance becomes an absolutely necessary condition.)
* It further reinforces this by saying ""當然，一流的跑者，可以在兩分鐘內跑完八百公尺的人，速度一定夠快，但他不論如何一定要培養耐力。"" (Of course, a top runner who can run 800 meters in two minutes is definitely fast, but he must cultivate endurance no matter what.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在冬季鍛煉越野長跑 (Training cross-country long runs in winter):** While mentioned as a *good* preparation method, it's not the *most important* factor.
* **C: 計時兩分鐘內跑完 (Running in two minutes):** This is a benchmark of speed, but the passage emphasizes that speed is becoming *less* important.
* **D: 培養速度勝過耐力 (Cultivating speed is better than endurance):** This is the opposite of what the passage states.



"
對於一位運動員來說，以下哪個不能單靠營養習慣來實現？,"The correct answer is **C: 頂尖成績 (Top-level performance)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while proper nutrition *significantly impacts* overall health and *can help improve* athletic performance and increase enjoyment, it doesn't say it's *sufficient* for achieving top-level performance. Achieving top-level performance likely requires a combination of factors, including genetics, coaching, training regimen, mental fortitude, and potentially specialized equipment – all beyond the scope of nutrition alone.

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 提高表現 (Improve performance):** The passage explicitly mentions nutrition can help improve athletic performance.
* **B: 增加樂趣 (Increase enjoyment):**  The passage explicitly mentions nutrition can help athletes increase enjoyment of their sport.
* **D: 整體健康 (Overall health):** The passage states that proper nutrition *significantly impacts* overall health.



"
根據文章，以下哪個不被建議作為年輕運動員在運動中找到更多樂趣的方法？,"The correct answer is **B: 持續造就頂尖成績 (Continuously achieving top results)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while proper nutrition *doesn't* guarantee top results, it *does* significantly impact overall health. The passage focuses on improving performance and *enhancing enjoyment*.  Achieving ""頂尖成績"" (top results) is mentioned as something nutrition *doesn't* directly influence.  The other options (adequate nutrition, hydration, and energy balance) are all explicitly mentioned as ways to improve performance and enjoyment.
"
根據文章，為什麼中長跑跑者可能會購買更昂貴的設備？,"The correct answer is **A: 他們的個人喜好 (Their personal preference)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that even if the products don't offer a real benefit, athletes *still prefer to use* them. This directly points to personal preference as the reason for purchasing more expensive equipment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 有公認的好處 (There are recognized benefits):** The passage explicitly states that most equipment has little to no impact on performance.
* **C: 它將大大影響他們的成績 (It will greatly affect their performance):** This is the opposite of what the passage claims.
* **D: 對周圍低價設備有誤解 (Misunderstanding of lower-priced equipment):** While possible, the passage focuses on preference *even if* there's no real benefit, making personal preference the primary reason.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
根據文章，中長跑跑者需要什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 非常少的設備 (Very little equipment)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""中長跑是一種相對花費較少的運動項目，用以參加此項競技所需的裝備極少..."" (Middle and long-distance running is a relatively inexpensive sport, requiring very little equipment to participate...)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 很多裝備 (A lot of equipment)** - The passage says the opposite.
* **B: 知名的運動背景 (Famous athletic background)** - The passage doesn't mention this.
* **D: 大量的金錢 (A lot of money)** - The passage states it's a relatively inexpensive sport."
誰發現了核磁共振？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 布洛赫和珀塞爾**.

The passage states: ""磁振造影 (MRI) 的基礎是一種稱為核磁共振 (NMR) 的物理現象，該現像是由菲利克斯‧布洛赫（史丹佛大學）和愛德華‧珀塞爾（哈佛大學）在 1930 年代發現的。""  This directly answers the question of who discovered NMR.
"
哪一年授予第一項磁振造影的專利？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""四年後獲得一項專利，這是世界上第一個 MRI 領域的專利。"" (Four years later he obtained a patent, which was the world's first patent in the field of MRI.)

Raymond Damadian discovered the principle of using MRI as a medical diagnostic tool in 1970, and the patent was obtained four years later, which is 1974.
"
根據文章，為了解讀他人的身體動作，人類應對什麼有強大的理解力？,"The correct answer is **B: 意圖 (Intent)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""這個能力中，能夠了解他人的意圖至關重要"" (Among these abilities, the ability to understand others' intentions is crucial). The example provided directly relates to understanding the *intention* behind the action of breaking a car window.



"
根據文章，理解意圖有助於人類做什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除身體動作背後的不確定性**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""這個能力讓我們得以釐清身體動作可能帶有的含糊意義."" (This ability allows us to clarify the ambiguous meaning of body language.)
* The example of breaking a car window illustrates this point perfectly – understanding the *intention* behind the action changes the interpretation of the body language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 預測渴望 (Predict desires):** While understanding intent *can* help predict desires, it's not the primary function highlighted in the passage. The passage focuses on clarifying actions, not forecasting wants.
* **C: 無偏見地看待其他人 (View others without bias):** The passage doesn't suggest that understanding intent inherently leads to unbiased judgment.  It simply states it helps interpret actions.
* **D: 揣摩他人心思 (Understand others' minds):**  This is a broader concept than the passage emphasizes. The passage specifically focuses on understanding *intent* as a crucial part of that broader ability.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項是人工智慧主要目的的正確總結？,"The correct answer is **D: 任務自動化 (Task automation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that a key goal of AI research is to ""製造出可自動執行需以智慧行為完成任務的機器"" which translates to ""to create machines capable of automatically performing tasks that require intelligent behavior."" 
* While planning, scheduling, speech recognition, and handwriting/face recognition are *examples* of what AI can *do*, they are means to achieve the broader goal of automating tasks.  Task automation is the overarching objective.

Therefore, option D best summarizes the main purpose of AI as described in the text.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項經常與人工智慧聯想一起？,"The correct answer is **C: 科幻小說 (Science Fiction)**.

The text explicitly states: ""雖然人工智慧具有很強的科幻內涵..."" which translates to ""Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation...""

While the other options (A, B, and D) are *examples* of what AI can *do*, the question asks what is *often associated* with AI.  The article directly links AI to science fiction.
"
根據文章，聚斂性思考模式的人具有以下哪一項優勢？,"The correct answer is **D: 記憶模式**.

The text explicitly states: ""這類思考模式的人擅邏輯，他們能記住模式、解決問題、進行科學測試。"" (People with this type of thinking are good at logic, they can remember patterns, solve problems, and conduct scientific tests.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 找出問題的多個正確答案** - The text says the key feature is believing there's *only* one correct answer.
* **B: 將新技術應用於問題** - The text mentions ""重新應用既有的技術"" (reapplying existing technologies), not applying *new* technologies.
* **C: 花時間解決問題** - The text emphasizes speed and efficiency (""快速"").



"
根據文章，以下哪一項不被認為是聚斂性思考模式的重點？,"The correct answer is **B: 花時間 (Spending time)**.

The passage explicitly states that convergent thinking is focused on being **quick, logical, and precise**. Spending time is the opposite of being quick. The other options (understanding there's one correct answer, identifying facts, and gathering information) are all listed as key elements of convergent thinking.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項不被認為是微表情？,"The correct answer is **D: 豎起大拇指 (Giving a thumbs up)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on subtle, fleeting facial expressions.** 微表情 (microexpressions) are defined as very brief facial expressions that reveal a person's true emotions, often hidden from conscious awareness.
* **A, B, and C (說話時眼神飄忽, 皺眉, 快速眨眼) all fit the description of microexpressions.** They are quick, subtle changes in facial features.
* **D (豎起大拇指) is a gesture, not a facial expression.** While a thumbs-up *can* convey emotion, it's a broader body language cue and not a fleeting facial movement characteristic of microexpressions.

Therefore, a thumbs-up is the only option that doesn't align with the definition of a microexpression presented in the text.
"
有關微表情解讀的說法，以下哪個敘述不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **C: 除了臉部表情，也可以解讀語言 (Besides facial expressions, language can also be interpreted)**.

Here's why:

* The passage focuses on **microexpressions and facial movements** as indicators of emotional states, particularly deception.  It explicitly mentions that recording has aided in deciphering these fleeting facial cues.
* While the passage mentions Oliver Sacks' observation about understanding sincerity *without* full comprehension of the *words* (suggesting emotional recognition), it doesn't imply that language itself is a primary focus of microexpression interpretation. The emphasis remains on *facial expressions*.
* Options A, B, and D are all supported by the text:
    * **A:** The first sentence states video recording has led to significant advances in understanding microexpressions.
    * **B:** The passage directly states that microexpressions are believed to be used to detect lies.
    * **D:** The passage concludes that microexpression interpretation can help assess sincerity.



Therefore, option C is the only statement that isn't directly supported or implied by the passage. The passage's emphasis is on *facial* microexpressions, not language interpretation.



**Final Answer: C**
"
以下哪項文藝復興的成果變得更重要？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 文本回憶 (Text recall)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Renaissance changed *how* knowledge was acquired. The key shift was the move *away* from relying on individual memory (A) and towards relying on the ability to recall information from texts (C). While knowledge dissemination (B) and acquiring information (D) are also important, the text specifically emphasizes the rise of text-based recall as a defining characteristic of the Renaissance's impact on learning and knowledge.



"
以下哪項文藝復興的成果不再受到重視？,"The correct answer is **A: 個別回憶 (Individual memories)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Renaissance shifted the focus *away* from individual memories as the primary source of knowledge. It mentions that pressure moved from individual memory to the ability to recall text.  Therefore, individual memories became less important.

The other options are things the Renaissance *increased* the importance of:

* **B: 獲得知識 (Acquiring knowledge):** The Renaissance was a period of intense knowledge acquisition.
* **C: 文本回憶 (Text recall):**  The emphasis on written texts increased.
* **D: 資訊散播 (Dissemination of information):** The Renaissance facilitated the spread of knowledge through printing and other means.



"
以下哪一項不反映使用網際網路維持人際關係的動機？,"The correct answer is **C: 研究旅行 (Research travel)**.

Here's why:

* The prompt and provided text focus on how the internet facilitates **social connection and maintaining relationships**. The options need to relate to those themes.
* **A: 商業網絡 (Business networking)**:  While not strictly personal, business networking is a form of social connection and maintaining professional relationships facilitated by the internet.
* **B: 與家人保持聯繫 (Staying in touch with family)**: This is a primary motivation for using the internet to maintain relationships.
* **D: 結識新朋友 (Making new friends)**: The internet provides opportunities to connect with people who share interests and form new relationships.
* **C: 研究旅行 (Research travel)**: Research travel is primarily focused on collecting information or conducting studies, not on maintaining personal relationships.  It's a different kind of activity.



Therefore, **研究旅行** is the option that does *not* reflect a motivation for using the internet to maintain interpersonal relationships.



"
以下哪一項不反映因個人參與而使用網際網路的動機？,"The correct answer is **C: 搜尋保健品 (Searching for health products)**.

Here's why:

The question asks which option *doesn't* reflect a motivation driven by ""personal engagement"" (個人參與). Let's analyze each option:

* **A: 查閱食譜 (Checking recipes):**  This involves active engagement with content, experimenting, and personal interest, which fits personal engagement.
* **B: 線上討論區發文 (Posting in online forums):** This is a highly interactive activity requiring personal investment, sharing opinions, and engaging with others – a clear example of personal engagement.
* **C: 搜尋保健品 (Searching for health products):**  While you're actively searching, it's primarily driven by a *need* or *problem* (health concern). It's more transactional and less about creating a relationship or actively participating in a community. It's less about personal engagement and more about problem-solving.
* **D: 管理財務 (Managing finances):** This often involves actively tracking, analyzing, and making decisions, requiring a personal investment and ongoing engagement.

Therefore, searching for health products is the least reflective of personal engagement among the choices. It is more aligned with task-oriented or information-seeking motivations.



"
西歐什麼時候停止重度依賴外來影響，並開始發展自己的風格？,"The correct answer is **A: 中世紀末期左右 (Around the late Middle Ages)**.

The passage states: ""中世紀末期，西歐開始發展獨特的風格。"" which translates to ""In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own unique style.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 拜占庭時期 (Byzantine period)**: The passage explicitly states the initial influence was from the Byzantine culture, not that the West *stopped* relying on it during that period.
* **C: 中世紀後大約 25 年 (About 25 years after the Middle Ages)**:  The passage mentions a 25-30 year delay in the Western style *following* the Eastern Byzantine style, not that the Western style emerged 25 years *after* the Middle Ages ended.
* **D: 11 世紀期間 (During the 11th century)**: The passage says the peak of Gothic style was between the 10th and 11th centuries, and while the late Middle Ages saw the development of a unique style, it didn't necessarily start in the 11th century.



"
使用鈕扣來固定衣服是哪個時期的產物？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 十字軍東征 (Crusades)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""中世紀末期，西歐開始發展獨特的風格。當時的一大進展，就是十字軍成員開始用釦子固定衣服。"" (In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own unique style. A major advancement at that time was that crusaders began using buttons to fasten their clothes.)

While the button's use became more widespread during the Gothic period, the passage directly links its adoption to the Crusaders.
"
根據文章，以下哪個被認為是環境問題可行的長期解決方案？,"The correct answer is **C: 確定問題的原因 (Identifying the root cause of the problem)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""不過，如果我們想要的不止是暫時性的解決方案，那麼我們就應該找到問題的根源，然後徹底解決它們。"" (However, if we want more than just temporary solutions, then we should find the root cause of the problem and thoroughly solve it.)

Let's look at why the other options are not the *best* answer:

* **A: 抵制的奢侈生活方式 (Resisting a luxurious lifestyle):**  While important, this is a *part* of the solution, not the overarching *long-term solution* the passage advocates for.
* **B: 行動主義 (Activism):**  The passage acknowledges activism but implies it's a more immediate response, not a long-term fix. It compares it to treating symptoms.
* **D: 成為環保運動的盟友 (Becoming an ally of environmental movements):** Similar to activism, this is a helpful action, but the passage suggests it's not sufficient on its own for a *long-term* solution.

The passage emphasizes understanding the *underlying reasons* for environmental problems (population overgrowth and wasteful lifestyles) as crucial for lasting change.  Therefore, identifying the root cause is the most accurate answer.
"
根據文章，以下哪個解決方案不被視為環境問題的症狀治療？,"The correct answer is **A: 參與行動主義 (Participating in activism)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage contrasts addressing symptoms versus addressing root causes.**  ""頭痛醫頭，腳痛醫腳"" (treating the headache when you have a headache, treating the foot when you have a foot problem) is a metaphor for treating symptoms.
* **The passage argues for finding and solving the fundamental problems.** It identifies overpopulation and wasteful lifestyles as the *root causes* of environmental issues.
* **Options B, C, and D all relate to addressing the underlying problem (or at least contributing to a long-term solution):**
    * **B: 徹底解決問題的根本原因 (Thoroughly solving the root causes of the problem)** - This is explicitly advocated for in the passage.
    * **C: 對奢侈生活方式發表意見 (Expressing opinions on luxurious lifestyles)** -  This relates to the ""wasteful lifestyles"" identified as a root cause.
    * **D: 以更環保的方式生活 (Living in a more environmentally friendly way)** - This is presented as a starting point, but not a long-term, fundamental solution.

* **Option A: 參與行動主義 (Participating in activism)**, while valuable, is presented as a *temporary measure* or a treatment of the symptoms. The passage suggests a more profound and lasting change is needed.  It's not explicitly framed as tackling the root cause.

Therefore, participation in activism is the option that *least* aligns with the passage's emphasis on addressing the fundamental causes of environmental problems.



"
據說歐洲第一場以權力平衡為核心議題而非宗教背景的戰爭發生在哪個國家？,"The correct answer is **D: 西班牙 (Spain)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""西班牙王位繼承戰爭成為以權力平衡為核心議題的第一場戰爭。"" (The War of the Spanish Succession became the first war with power balance as its core issue.)
"
哪場戰爭有時被描述為最後一場「宗教戰爭」？,"The correct answer is **A: 三十年戰爭 (Thirty Years' War)**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""這是一項重大改變，代表歐洲列強不能再以宗教戰爭作為藉口，因此，三十年戰爭成為最後一場宗教戰爭。"" (This was a major change, meaning European powers could no longer use religious wars as an excuse, therefore the Thirty Years' War became the last religious war.)

Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
根據文章，以下天主教教會哪個方面未受到詳細審查？,"The correct answer is **B: 是否應修改宗教的主要信條 (Whether the main tenets of the religion should be modified)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses heavily on the *application* of the core tenets of Christianity, specifically regarding wealth and poverty.** It questions whether the Church is truly adhering to the belief that wealth should be used to help the suffering and poor, given its vast wealth and power.
* **The passage discusses the Church's power, wealth concentration, and the historical context of scrutiny.** These are all related to *how* the Church operates within its existing framework.
* **Option B, asking about *modifying* the core tenets, delves into the fundamental beliefs of Christianity itself.** The passage doesn't address the validity or necessity of changing the basic doctrines. It critiques the Church's *behavior* in light of those doctrines, not the doctrines themselves.

Therefore, the passage explicitly addresses A, C, and D, but not B."
根據文章，誰在凡爾賽宮被謀殺？,"The correct answer is **D: 一名衛兵 (A guard)**.

The passage states: ""該衛兵在在凡爾賽宮被殺"" which translates to ""the guard was killed at Versailles.""
"
暴徒沒有強迫國王和皇后做出以下哪種行為？,"The correct answer is **B: 突然離開凡爾賽宮 (Suddenly leaving Versailles)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states** the mob *forced* the King and Queen to open their carriage windows. This is stated directly in the text.
* **The passage describes** the King and Queen being surrounded and threatened during the journey to Paris. They were subjected to taunts and threats.
* **The passage describes** a mob member waving a severed head of a royal guard in front of the Queen.
* **The passage describes** the King and Queen's forced return to Paris.

The passage *doesn't* say the mob forced them to *suddenly leave Versailles*. It describes their forced relocation to Paris, and then the terrifying journey *to* Paris.  While the overall context involves a loss of control and coercion, there's no mention of a sudden, forced departure from Versailles itself prior to the journey.



Therefore, option B is the only option that wasn't forced upon them by the mob according to the provided text.



"
以下哪一項不是英國非傳統海戰的成果？,"The correct answer is **C: 國際法得到了修改 (International law was modified)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the blockade violated existing international law.**  The blockade was *in violation* of international agreements, not a cause for modifying them.
* **The passage explicitly mentions the strategies' effects:**
    * **A: 德國希望採用類似的戰術 (Germany hoped to adopt similar tactics):** The British blockade and submarine warfare influenced Germany's decision to employ unrestricted submarine warfare.
    * **B: 將無關的船隻置身危險之中 (Putting neutral ships in danger):**  The laying of mines and the blockade itself directly endangered neutral ships.
    * **D: 無法獲得關鍵物資 (Unable to obtain essential supplies):** The blockade effectively cut off Germany's access to vital military and civilian supplies.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* a result of Britain's unconventional naval warfare is the modification of international law.  The situation highlighted the *failure* of international law to prevent the actions, rather than leading to its amendment.



"
以下哪個陳述並未正確描述英國對德國的海上封鎖？,"The correct answer is **D: It ensured neutral ships would not be harmed.**

Here's why:

* **A: It violated international law:** The passage explicitly states the blockade violated international law and agreements.
* **B: It provoked Germany's U-boat war:** The passage says Germany believed the blockade wouldn't be met with strong resistance, leading to their U-boat campaign.
* **C: It disrupted Germany's supply of materials:** The passage states the blockade was designed to cut off essential military and civilian supplies.
* **D: It ensured neutral ships would not be harmed:** The passage states the blockade *even endangered* neutral ships by deploying mines. This directly contradicts option D.

Therefore, the only statement that *doesn't* accurately describe the British blockade is that it ensured the safety of neutral ships.
"
根據文章，哪種人最有可能被診斷出患有多發性硬化症？,"The correct answer is **A: 一位 32 歲的女性**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that MS is a major neurological disease affecting younger and middle-aged adults.
* It also explicitly states that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
* Option A, a 32-year-old woman, falls within the age range and the gender that are most commonly affected by MS according to the passage.

The other options are less likely based on the information provided:

* **B: 一位 15 歲的男性** - While within the younger age range, men are less likely to be affected.
* **C: 一位 43 歲的男性** - Falls within the age range, but men are less likely.
* **D: 一位 10 歲的女性** - Too young, and while a woman, the age makes it less likely than a 32-year-old.
"
根據文章，參與規律活動的人哪方面需要更多協助？,"The correct answer is **A: 負面疼痛感知 (Negative pain perception)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""那些進行規律活動的人在對於疼痛的負面感知即慢性疼痛及一般物理性動作所造成的不適感之間的區別，需要更多的協助。"" This translates to: ""Those who engage in regular activity need more assistance in distinguishing between negative pain perception, such as chronic pain and discomfort caused by general physical movements.""

Therefore, the statement directly indicates that those participating in regular activities require more help with distinguishing between negative pain perceptions.
"
根據文章，擊劍通常是如何進行的？,"The correct answer is **D: 以決鬥形式進行 (In a dueling format)**.

The passage states: ""這種運動主要以決鬥模式進行，由一名擊劍選手對決另一名選手。"" which translates to ""This sport is mainly carried out in a dueling format, with one fencer competing against another.""
"
根據文章，以下哪一個是體內中毒最強力的指標？,"The correct answer is **D: 一個處方藥藥瓶 (A prescription drug bottle)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""最好判斷體內中毒的跡象，可能是發現有著已打開的藥物或毒性家用化學物的容器。"" (The best way to determine signs of poisoning is to find containers of opened medications or toxic household chemicals.)

While nausea, vomiting, and pain can be symptoms, they are too common to be definitive. Finding an opened container of a potentially poisonous substance is a much stronger indicator of possible poisoning.

Therefore, option D is the most direct and reliable indicator mentioned in the text.
"
根據文章，評估傷者時適當的第一步是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 觀察現場 (Observe the surroundings)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""檢查傷者之前，你必須先觀察周邊環境，確保自己的安全。"" which translates to ""Before checking the injured person, you must first observe the surroundings to ensure your own safety.""

Therefore, observing the surroundings is the crucial first step.
"
以下哪一個陳述未正確反映檢查傷者的過程？,"The correct answer is **A: 不用擔心自己受傷 (Don't worry about getting injured yourself)**.

Here's why:

The provided text *explicitly* states the opposite of option A. It says: ""如果你在試圖幫助時受傷，可能只會讓事態變得更糟。(If you get injured while trying to help, it might only make things worse.)""  This means you *should* be concerned about your safety and avoid getting injured.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct reflections of the process:

* **B: 在傷者面前評估現場 (Assess the scene before approaching the patient)** - The text says to ""觀察周邊環境 (observe the surrounding environment)"" which is exactly what assessing the scene means.
* **C: 觀察傷者的位置 (Observe the patient's position)** -  The text specifically mentions ""傷者位置 (patient's position)"".
* **D: 嘗試注意任何警訊 (Try to notice any warning signs)** - The text explicitly mentions ""任何出現的警訊 (any warning signs)"".



Therefore, option A is the only statement that contradicts the information given in the text.



"
法國大革命促使哪些變革對勞工階級產生了重大影響？,"The correct answer is **B: 關注重點從階級轉向才幹 (The focus shifted from class to ability)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""在革命之後，各種職缺都開放給所有主動求職的男性，讓最有意願和成就者得以接掌。同樣的情形也發生在軍隊裡，因為他們此時已不用階級來區分軍階，而是以才幹為基準。"" (After the revolution, all job openings were open to all actively seeking men, allowing those with the most willingness and achievement to take charge. The same situation occurred in the military, as they no longer distinguished ranks by class but by ability.)

This directly addresses the shift from a class-based system to one based on merit.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 增加國家的支持度 (Increased national support):** While the revolution *did* increase national support for some, the passage focuses on *internal* changes affecting the laboring class.  Increased support is a broader consequence, not a direct impact on their opportunities.
* **C: 採納了共和意識形態 (Adopted a republican ideology):**  While the passage mentions the shift to republicanism and nationalism as effects of the revolution, it doesn't directly link this ideological shift to *specific* changes benefitting the laboring class.
* **D: 新的度量衡系統 (New system of weights and measures):**  The passage mentions the adoption of a new system of weights and measures, but it doesn't specifically say this benefited the laboring class or triggered significant change for them. It's a consequence of the revolution, but not a direct impact on labor.



Therefore, option B best reflects the significant change in opportunity for the laboring class brought about by the French Revolution.
"
法國大革命後，要在軍事和其他職業中取得成功，不太可能以什麼為基準？,"The correct answer is **B: 階級 (Class)**.

The passage explicitly states that after the French Revolution, success in the military and other professions was based on **talent** (才幹), not on **class** (階級). The revolution aimed to eliminate the barriers of class distinctions and promote individuals based on their abilities. Therefore, class would be the least likely basis for success.
"
根據文章，在已開發國家中，據說哪一項公共服務引起了最多不滿？,"The correct answer is **C: 大眾運輸 (Public Transportation)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""幾乎每一個人都抱怨運輸系統。(Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.)""  It also contrasts this with the relative lack of complaints about water quality and bridge collapses. Therefore, public transportation is the service with the most complaints.
"
根據文章，大眾運輸系統有什麼特點？,"The correct answer is **C: 常常被使用者的抱怨 (Often complained about by users)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""幾乎每一個人都抱怨運輸系統 (Almost everyone complains about the transportation system).""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 深受使用者的喜愛 (Deeply loved by users):** This is the opposite of what the passage states.
*   **B: 不像水質那麼糟糕 (Not as bad as water quality):** The passage compares transportation complaints to complaints about water quality, implying the opposite – that transportation *is* a source of significant complaints.
*   **D: 在大多數已開發國家中是免費的 (Free in most developed countries):** The passage doesn't mention the cost of transportation.



"
根據文章，由於難以預測司機的行為，因此難以衡量以下哪個項目？,"The correct answer is **D: 交通流量 (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""問題是，因為無法百分之百預測駕駛習慣，所以研究交通流量非常困難。"" (The problem is that because it is impossible to predict driver behavior 100%, studying traffic flow is very difficult.)

The passage then goes on to say that traffic flow *can* be represented mathematically due to the predictable range of driver behavior. This implies that traffic flow is the *most* difficult to measure directly due to unpredictable driver behavior, but can be approximated.

The other options are all things that can be *influenced* by understanding and modeling traffic flow:

*   **交通速度 (Traffic speed)**:  Speed is a direct consequence of flow and density and can be modeled based on them.
*   **道路規劃 (Road planning)**: Planning considers expected traffic flow, density, and speed to design roads effectively.
*   **道路作業 (Road operations)**: Operations like traffic light timing and incident management are all aimed at managing traffic flow.



Therefore, the answer is **D**."
以下哪項工具會用於展現交通流量？,"The correct answer is **D: 交通密度 (Traffic Density)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that flow, density, and speed are the three main characteristics used to represent traffic flow.**  The question asks which *tool* would show traffic flow. Density is one of those main characteristics.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 道路作業 (Road Works):** This refers to construction or maintenance on roads, not a way of *showing* traffic flow.
* **B: 司機行為 (Driver Behavior):** While driver behavior influences traffic flow, it's not a direct *tool* used to *represent* it.  The passage acknowledges the difficulty in predicting driver behavior.
* **C: 道路設計 (Road Design):** This is about how roads are built and isn't a method for visualizing or quantifying traffic flow.



Therefore, **交通密度 (Traffic Density)** is the most accurate answer because it's one of the core metrics used to describe and represent traffic flow, as outlined in the passage.
"
赫雪和蔡司用什麼來植入他們的 DNA？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 病毒 (Viruses)**.

The question asks what Hershey and Chase used to introduce their DNA. The passage states they used **phage**, which are viruses, to introduce DNA into bacteria.
"
突變是否能夠傳遞給後代，取決於以下哪一個因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 細胞是否為生殖系細胞**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""只有生殖細胞系細胞中的突變會遺傳給子女..."" (Only mutations in germline cells are passed on to offspring...)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 基因物質的重要性:**  The importance of the gene product doesn't determine whether a mutation is heritable. A mutation in a seemingly unimportant gene *could* be in a germline cell and therefore be inherited.
* **C: 突變的類型:** While the type of mutation can influence its effect on the cell, it doesn't determine inheritance. A mutation could be of a type that causes cell death but still occur in a germline cell and be passed on.
* **D: 突變是否會導致細胞死亡:**  Cell death due to a mutation doesn't prevent inheritance if the mutation occurred in a germline cell *before* the cell died.

Therefore, the **crucial factor for heritability is whether the mutated cell is a germline cell (sperm or egg)**.



"
根據文章所提供的資訊，突變的各種不同效果不依賴以下何者？,"The correct answer is **A: 有多少遺傳物質受到影響 (How much genetic material is affected)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the effects of mutations *depend* on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and *whether the affected cells are germline cells*.  It also states that mutations in germline cells are the only ones passed on.  Non-germline mutations can lead to cell death or cancer.

The question asks what the effects *don't* depend on.  While the *extent* of genetic material affected might influence the *severity* of the effect, the passage doesn't say it's a defining factor of the *different effects* themselves. The other options (mutation type, importance of the affected gene, and germline vs. non-germline cells) are all directly linked to the different effects described in the passage.

Therefore, the amount of genetic material affected is not a factor that determines the *various different effects* of mutations, according to the provided text.
"
以下哪個不是古代文化飼養山羊的原因？,"The correct answer is **C: 提供陪伴 (Provide companionship)**.

The text explicitly states that ancient cultures domesticated goats for milk, wool, meat, and hides. While goats might offer some companionship, it's not listed as a primary reason for their domestication according to the passage. The other options (肉品 - meat, 提供牛奶 - provide milk, 幫助放牧 - assist herding) are all directly mentioned as reasons.
"
高爾夫球是用極少數的什麼達到目標？,"The correct answer is **B: 桿數 (Scoring)**.

The passage states: ""打完全場後，由以最低桿數，也就是最少揮桿次數進洞的球員贏得比賽。"" This directly indicates that the goal is to have the lowest number of strokes (桿數) to complete the course.
"
在高爾夫球場上，哪裡的草修剪得比較短？,"The correct answer is **B: 在果嶺上 (On the green)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""球洞周圍的草割得較短，稱為果嶺。"" (The grass around the hole is cut shorter and is called the green.)
"
實驗的典型目的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 消除一個或多個可能的假設**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""實驗是能消除一個或多個假設的測試..."" (Experiments are tests that can eliminate one or more hypotheses...)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: 理解世界的運作方式:** While experiments *contribute* to understanding how the world works, that's a broader goal of science, not the specific aim of an experiment.
* **C: 提出問題:**  Asking questions is the *starting point* of scientific inquiry, not the purpose of an experiment. Experiments are used *to answer* questions.
* **D: 引領科學研究:** Experiments *guide* scientific research, but their immediate purpose is to test specific hypotheses.



Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the typical purpose of an experiment as described in the passage.
"
根據文章，以下何者不能幫助引領科學研究？,"The correct answer is **A: 只靠科學方法 (Relying only on the scientific method)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""實驗法並不是唯一，問問題和進行觀察也能夠引領科學研究"" (Experiments are not the only way; asking questions and conducting observations can also lead to scientific research). Therefore, relying *only* on the scientific method is insufficient and not the *only* way to guide scientific research according to the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 進行觀察 (Conducting observations):** The passage explicitly mentions observation as a way to guide scientific research.
* **C: 排除可能的假設 (Eliminating possible hypotheses):**  The passage describes experiments as a way to test and eliminate hypotheses.
* **D: 進行實驗 (Conducting experiments):** The passage states that experiments *can* lead to scientific research.



"
根據文章，以下哪個對龍捲風的陳述不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 大多數龍捲風持續超過三小時 (Most tornadoes last longer than three hours)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""龍捲風之中最猛烈的 2% 能持續超過 3 小時 (The most violent 2% of tornadoes can last longer than 3 hours)."" This means *most* tornadoes do *not* last longer than three hours.
* The other options are directly supported by the text:
    * **A: 龍捲風能夠摧毀周圍的一切 (Tornadoes can destroy everything in their path):** The text says they can uproot trees, tear off siding, and throw cars.
    * **B: 龍捲風影響的範圍比其他風暴小 (Tornadoes affect a smaller area than other storms):** This is explicitly stated in the first sentence.
    * **D: 有些龍捲風的風速可以達到每小時 300 英里 (Some tornadoes can reach winds of 300 mph):** The text states the maximum wind speed is 300 mph.



"
根據文章，以下哪個陳述正確描述了大多數龍捲風？,"The correct answer is **B: 它們能夠產生每小時約480英里的風速**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""這些怪獸風暴的風速高達每小時 480 公里（每秒 133 公尺；每小時 300 英里）."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它們通常持續超過三小時:** The passage says ""龍捲風之中最猛烈的 2% 能持續超過 3 小時,"" meaning most tornadoes *do not* last that long.
* **C: 它們影響的範圍比其他風暴大:** The passage states the opposite: ""龍捲風與其他猛烈的風暴相比，侵襲的範圍較小..."" (Tornadoes, compared to other violent storms, have a smaller area of impact...).
* **D: 它們能夠將樹木從地上拔起:** The passage mentions this as *one* of the destructive capabilities of tornadoes, but it doesn't describe it as a characteristic of *most* tornadoes.  It's more of an extreme effect.



"
以下哪個是人類在 16 世紀開始做的事情？,"The correct answer is **D: 製造望遠鏡 (Manufacturing telescopes)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""但第一架真正的望遠鏡是 16 世紀末才在歐洲被製造出來的。"" (But the first true telescope was manufactured in Europe in the late 16th century.)

While humans had been making lenses and using magnification for millennia (A and B), and lenses were made before the 16th century (C), the text specifically links the *first telescopes* to the 16th century.
"
人類使用透鏡放大物體已經有多久了？,"The correct answer is **C: 數千年 (Thousands of years)**.

The passage states: ""人類幾千年來一直在製造透鏡，並使用它的放大功能。"" which translates to ""Humans have been manufacturing lenses and using their magnifying function for thousands of years.""
"
根據文章，關於穆罕默德的靈性修行或價值觀，他的洞穴說明了什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 他重視和平和孤獨**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the cave is ""completely isolated from the outside world"" and that ""once inside the cave, one is completely cut off from the world.""
* This isolation suggests a deliberate seeking of peace and solitude, conditions conducive to spiritual contemplation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 外界嘈雜聲可以幫助冥想 (Outside noise can help meditation):** The passage emphasizes isolation *from* noise, not its inclusion.
* **C: 他需要的獨處時間非常少 (He needs very little alone time):** The description of the cave being a secluded place implies a significant need for alone time.
* **D: 他渴望被看到和被聽到 (He longs to be seen and heard):** The cave's isolation is the opposite of a desire for attention and visibility.



"
根據文章，鐵最早是用來做什麼的？,"The correct answer is **B: 馬車軌道 (Horse-drawn railway)**.

The passage states: ""很早就開始採用軌枕將軌道固定住。但漸漸地，人們發現若鋪上鐵條，軌道效率較高。 這成為常見作法，但鐵會使馬車的木輪上出現更多磨損。"" (Early on, sleepers were used to fix the rails. But gradually, people discovered that laying iron strips on the rails increased efficiency. This became a common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the horse-drawn carriages.)

This clearly indicates that iron was first used to improve the efficiency of **horse-drawn railways** (馬車軌道).
"
根據文章，為什麼木輪被鐵輪取代？,"The correct answer is **D: 木輪受軌道上的鐵條磨損 (Wooden wheels wore down on the iron rails)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""但鐵會使馬車的木輪上出現更多磨損。 最後，鐵輪取代了木輪。"" (But iron would cause more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts. Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden wheels.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 鐵輪能提高馬匹的速度 (Iron wheels could increase the speed of horses)** - The passage doesn't mention iron wheels increasing horse speed.
* **B: 鐵輪被認為更有效率 (Iron wheels were considered more efficient)** - While the passage notes that iron rails were initially more efficient, it doesn't say iron wheels were considered more efficient. The efficiency issue was related to the rails, not the wheels themselves.
* **C: 鐵輪能夠處理更大的負載 (Iron wheels could handle larger loads)** - The passage doesn't discuss load-bearing capacity.
"
根據文章，是什麼塑造了浪漫主義時期的個體？,"The correct answer is **B: 地理 (Geography)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""在浪漫主義的脈絡中，地理環境塑造了個體..."" (In the context of Romanticism, the geographical environment shaped the individual...). While customs and culture are mentioned as outcomes of this shaping, the primary shaper is the geographical environment.
"
以下哪個陳述不反映科技決定論的普遍概念？ ,"The correct answer is **A: 科技對社會的影響是社會條件所決定的**.

Here's why:

* **Technological determinism fundamentally argues *against* the idea that social conditions solely determine technological development and impact.** The text explicitly states that technological determinism emphasizes the idea that technology has its own trajectory and influences society, rather than simply being a product of social forces.

Let's break down why the other options *do* reflect technological determinism:

* **B: 科技的發展不受文化的影響:** This aligns with a strong form of technological determinism, where technology follows its own logic regardless of cultural context. While not all technological determinists would make this absolute claim, it's a common element.
* **C: 科技對社會具有內在的影響:**  This is a core tenet of technological determinism. The belief is that technology has a power and logic of its own that shapes society, independent of external forces.
* **D: 科技發展不基於政治影響力:**  Similar to B, this reflects a core belief in technological determinism that technology progresses based on its own internal logic, rather than being influenced by political considerations.



Therefore, option A is the only one that directly contradicts the core tenets of technological determinism.



"
根據文章，以下哪個選項與拉弓無關？,"The correct answer is **B: 看起來像訂書針的標記**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ""下弓"" (down bow) mark looks like a staple or a bottom-opening square. It connects the visual description to the sound (stronger, more decisive).  It doesn't connect it to *how* you draw the bow.

* **A: 柔和的聲音 (Soft sound)** - The passage says ""上弓"" (up bow) represents a softer sound.
* **C: 強勁的聲音 (Strong sound)** - The passage says ""下弓"" (down bow) represents a stronger sound.
* **D: 從弓根開始 (Starting from the bow heel)** - The passage says ""下弓"" indicates drawing the bow from the bow heel.

Therefore, the description of the ""下弓"" mark as looking like a staple is a *visual characteristic*, while the other options relate to the *effect* of the bow stroke. The question asks which is *unrelated to the act of drawing the bow*.
"
根據文章，以下何者與柔和的聲音有關？,"The correct answer is **C: 像 V 字形的痕標記 (The V-shaped mark)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""上弓記號通常代表的是比較輕柔的聲響，而下弓記號則代表比較強烈又比較堅定的聲響.""  This translates to ""The upbow mark usually represents a softer sound, while the downbow mark represents a stronger and more decisive sound.""

The text also says ""「上弓」標記長得像 V"" which means ""The upbow mark looks like a V"". Therefore, the V-shaped mark is associated with a softer sound.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 下弓標記 (Downbow mark):**  The text specifically says the *downbow* mark represents a *stronger* sound.
* **B: 拉弓 (Drawing the bow):** This is a description of the action, not the mark itself.
* **D: 從手握住弓的位置開始 (Starting from the hand position):** This describes the starting point of the bow stroke, not the mark itself.



"
化石顯示，手最終適應了以下哪方面的主要用途？,"The correct answer is **A: 操作 (Manipulation)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that human hands are shorter than feet and have straighter finger bones, contrasting with chimpanzees who have similarly sized hands and feet for weight-bearing and swinging.
* The passage explicitly mentions a shift *from movement to manipulation* in hand function based on fossil evidence.

Therefore, the fossil evidence strongly indicates that human hands evolved primarily for manipulation, not for carrying weight, locomotion, or specialized walking.
"
以下何者正確描述了黑猩猩的指骨？ ,"The correct answer is **B: 手腳的指骨大小不同 (The finger bones of the hands and feet are different sizes.)**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""黑猩猩手和腳的尺寸與長度相當，反映了牠們的手在握拳行走時承受重量的作用。"" (The size and length of chimpanzee hands and feet are comparable, reflecting the role of their hands in bearing weight when walking with a fist.)  This implies the finger bones are sized appropriately for weight-bearing.
* The passage also states: ""人類的手比腳短，且手的指骨較直。"" (Human hands are shorter than feet, and the finger bones of the hand are straighter.)  This directly contrasts with the chimpanzees, meaning their finger bones *aren't* the same size.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 比人類的指骨更直 (Straighter than human finger bones):** The passage says human finger bones are straighter.
* **C: 用於負重 (Used for bearing weight):**  The passage says chimpanzees use their hands for weight-bearing. While human hands *can* bear weight, the passage emphasizes a shift from weight-bearing to manipulation.
* **D: 主要用於操作 (Primarily used for manipulation):** The passage indicates that chimpanzees primarily use their hands for weight bearing, not manipulation.  The passage focuses on the shift in human hand function from movement to manipulation.



"
天擇從哪個群體中刪除新的基因變異？,"The correct answer is **D: 顯性 (Dominant)**.

Here's why:

The question states that natural selection ""will remove them from the *dominant* mutation pool.""  Natural selection acts on the phenotypes (observable characteristics) produced by different genotypes.  Dominant mutations, because they express their phenotype even when only one copy is present, have a greater impact on an organism's survival and reproduction. Therefore, natural selection tends to favor and maintain dominant mutations.  Recessive mutations are less likely to be selected for and are more easily removed from the population over time.



Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
哪個過程負責增加基因變異？,"The correct answer is **C: 突變 (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

* **Mutation:** The question states that mutations *increase* new gene variations. This is the definition of mutation - a change in the DNA sequence, which can introduce new alleles (different versions of a gene).
* **Separation (Segregation):**  Separation occurs during meiosis, where alleles are separated into different gametes. It *reshuffles* existing alleles, but doesn't create new ones.
* **Recombination:** Recombination (crossing over) also occurs during meiosis, where genetic material is exchanged between homologous chromosomes.  Like separation, it reshuffles existing alleles but doesn't create new ones.
* **Dominant:** Dominance describes the relationship between alleles, not a process that *creates* variation.



Therefore, only **mutation** directly addresses the question of which process *increases* gene variation.



"
根據文章中的資訊，靈長類動物應該攝取那些食物來解決「蛋白質問題」？,"The correct answer is **C: 蚱蜢 (Ants, termites, and eggs)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that animal products (ants, termites, eggs) are easily digestible and provide all essential amino acids.
* It contrasts this with plant sources (leaves and beans) which are difficult to digest without cooking and often lack a complete amino acid profile.

Therefore, if early hominids solved the protein problem like modern savanna chimpanzees, they would have relied on easily digestible animal proteins.  While the passage mentions ants, termites, and eggs collectively, ""grasshoppers"" is the closest and most suitable option reflecting this preference for animal protein sources. The other options (leaves, beans, flower stalks) are plant-based and the passage indicates they are problematic for protein intake.



"
根據文章，以下哪個問題不是因為缺乏必要胺基酸引起的？,"The correct answer is **A: 消化問題 (Digestive problems)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states a chain reaction:** Lack of amino acids leads to malnutrition, which then leads to stunted growth, and ultimately death.
* **消化問題 (Digestive problems)** is a *symptom* of the inability to properly digest plant matter *because* of its protein composition.  It's a consequence *of* the protein issue, not a direct result of lacking amino acids themselves.  The passage focuses on the amino acid deficiency as the root cause.
* **營養不良 (Malnutrition), 生長不良 (Stunted growth), and 死亡 (Death)** are all explicitly listed as consequences of insufficient amino acid intake.



Therefore, while digestive problems are *related* to the protein issue, they aren't a direct consequence *of lacking amino acids* according to the passage's argument. The other options *are* directly stated as consequences.
"
一個特定的次文化成員經常如何表明他們與該群體的關聯？,"The correct answer is **D: 使用有象徵形式的風格 (Using symbolic forms of style)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""成員通常透過特殊、有象徵意義的形式彰顯他們的屬於該群體，其中包括穿著打扮、行為舉止及暗語的使用。"" (Members typically demonstrate their belonging to the group through special, symbolic forms, including clothing, behavior, and the use of slang.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 試著融入 (Trying to blend in):** While some members *might* try to blend in at times, it's not the primary way they signal belonging to their subculture. Subcultures often define themselves by *not* conforming to the mainstream.
* **B: 採納周圍每個人的信念 (Adopting everyone else's beliefs):**  This is not characteristic of subcultures.  Subcultures often have distinct beliefs and values that differentiate them from the mainstream.
* **C: 接受社會規範 (Accepting social norms):** Subcultures often reject or modify social norms, so accepting them wouldn't signal membership.



"
根據本文所提出的理論，某少數民族具有從事威脅行為的刻板印象，認同該民族的兒童會發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **B: 孩子將更有可能從事威脅行為 (Children will be more likely to engage in threatening behavior).**

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a phenomenon where internalizing a negative stereotype can lead to confirming that stereotype.** The example given is the stereotype of minority students performing poorly in school. Children who learn about this stereotype *and* identify with the group being stereotyped might, consciously or unconsciously, act in ways that confirm the stereotype (e.g., performing poorly in school).

* **Applying this logic to the question:** If a minority group is stereotyped as being prone to threatening behavior, and a child identifies with that group, they might, due to internalized stereotype threat, be *more likely* to engage in threatening behavior.  It's a counterintuitive outcome, but the theory suggests it's possible.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: 孩子會盡量避免參與威脅行為 (Children will try their best to avoid engaging in threatening behavior):** This is the opposite of what stereotype threat would predict.
* **C: 孩子在社交場合會退縮 (Children will withdraw in social situations):** While possible, this isn't the direct outcome predicted by the stereotype threat theory presented.  The theory focuses on behavioral changes related to the stereotype.
* **D: 孩子會拒絕接觸其他少數種族 (Children will refuse to interact with other minority races):** This isn't directly related to the scenario described, which focuses on the impact of stereotypes on a child's *own* behavior related to the stereotype.



**Important Note:**  It is crucial to remember that stereotype threat is a complex psychological phenomenon, and these are tendencies, not guarantees. It does not mean all children will behave this way.
"
根據文章，孩子對種族刻板印象的了解可能會影響以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 他們的行為 (Their behavior)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""這些種族刻板印象會影響其行為 (These racial stereotypes will affect their behavior).""  The example given directly illustrates this point: children internalizing a stereotype about academic performance and then performing poorly in school.

While options A, C, and D *could* be indirectly affected, the passage focuses specifically on the impact on behavior. Therefore, B is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項不太可能與野孩子的教養一致？,"The correct answer is **B: 強大的會話能力 (Strong conversational skills)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""if feral children were completely raised by non-human animals, they would exhibit behaviors almost entirely the same as the animal that raised them (physiologically allowing), such as displaying fear or indifference towards humans."" This implies a lack of human interaction and development of human communication skills.

Let's look at why the other options *could* be consistent:

*   **A: 獨立生活 (Independent living):** Feral children are defined by living independently, outside of human societal structures.
*   **C: 隱居傾向 (Tendency to reclusiveness):**  Lack of human contact would naturally lead to a preference for isolation.
*   **D: 社交焦慮 (Social anxiety):**  Without socialization with humans, developing social skills and comfort with social situations would be unlikely, leading to anxiety.



Therefore, strong conversational skills are the least likely trait to be present in a feral child raised by animals, according to the passage."
根據文章，以下哪項何者正確描述了兒童的野獸行為？,"The correct answer is **B: 野獸行為可能源於缺乏社會化 (Wild behavior may stem from a lack of socialization)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""如果野孩子完全由非人類動物扶養長大，則會表現出與照顧他的動物幾乎完全相同的行為 (生理條件允許下)，例如對人類表現出害怕或冷漠的態度。"" (If a wild child is completely raised by non-human animals, they will exhibit almost identical behaviors to the animals that raised them (provided physiological conditions allow), such as fear or indifference towards humans.)
* **This directly links the wild behavior to the *lack of socialization* with humans.** The child isn't learning human social norms and behaviors, so they adopt the behaviors of the animals they are raised with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 大部分的野獸行為是由身體缺陷引起的 (Most wild behavior is caused by physical defects):** The passage doesn't say physical defects *cause* the wild behavior, only that some children were abandoned due to them.
* **C: 野獸行為僅普遍存在於受父母監禁的兒童中 (Wild behavior is only prevalent in children who are parentally confined):** The passage mentions abandonment, being runaways, and being raised by animals, not just confinement by parents.
* **D: 所有的野獸行為都是由嚴重的智力障礙引起的 (All wild behavior is caused by severe intellectual disabilities):** While some children were abandoned due to intellectual disabilities, the passage doesn't claim that *all* wild behavior is related to intellectual disability.



"
根據文章，以下哪項做法不符合自給農業？,"The correct answer is **B: 生產食物出售給他人 (Producing food to sell to others)**.

Here's why:

The definition of self-sufficient farming explicitly states that it's a system where the crops *only* meet the needs of the farmer and their family. Selling food to others directly contradicts this core principle.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with self-sufficient farming:

*   **A: 以滿足農民家庭需求的產量為重點 (Focusing on crop yields to meet the needs of the farmer's family)**: This is the very definition of self-sufficient farming.
*   **C: 注重高產量而非先進技術 (Focusing on high yields rather than advanced technology)**: The text mentions ""輪作或其他相對簡單的技術"" (crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques), indicating a preference for simple methods over advanced technology, which aligns with self-sufficiency.
*   **D: 採購當地農民的種子 (Purchasing seeds from local farmers)**: This aligns with the emphasis on using locally adapted seeds, a key aspect of self-sufficient farming.



"
下列何者正確描述了自給農業的作法？,"The best answer is **D: 部分國家的農民仍在使用這種方法 (Some farmers in some countries still use this method)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""歷史上，大部分的農民都從事自給自足農業，且許多開發中國家依舊如此 (Historically, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and many developing countries still do)."" This directly supports option D.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 是一個完全有機的系統 (It is a completely organic system):** While the text mentions that subsistence farming *often* uses organic farming practices, it doesn't state that it *must* be completely organic.
* **B: 使用獨特的技術來最大化收穫量 (Uses unique techniques to maximize yields):** The text emphasizes *simple* techniques for increasing yields, not unique or advanced ones.  The goal is sustenance, not maximum profit or yield.
* **C: 允許農民在他們的地區分享自己的農作物 (Allows farmers in their areas to share their crops):** The text doesn't mention sharing crops. Subsistence farming is primarily focused on meeting the needs of the farmer and their family.



Therefore, D is the most accurate statement based on the provided text."
參觀博物館屬於哪種旅遊類型？,"The correct answer is **C: 文化旅遊**.

Here's why:

* **文化旅遊** specifically involves visiting places to learn about a country's history and culture, such as landmarks and museums.
* **休閒旅遊 (Leisure travel)** is focused on relaxation and recreation.
* **商務旅遊 (Business travel)** is for work-related purposes.
* **戶外旅遊 (Outdoor travel)** focuses on activities in nature.

Visiting a museum directly aligns with the definition of cultural tourism.
"
根據文章，下列何者可能是休閒遊客優先考慮的事？,"The correct answer is **B: 離開他們的日常生活休息一下 (Leaving their daily life to relax)**.

Here's why:

* The passage defines leisure travel as going to places ""different from their daily living environment, to relax and have fun."" Option B directly reflects this definition.
* Options A, C, and D describe characteristics of cultural travel, not leisure travel. Leisure travel is primarily about relaxation and escaping routine.



"
文中提到什麼可以幫助減輕當地教堂對變革的恐懼？,"The correct answer is **A: 記住創業行為的成功案例 (Remembering successful entrepreneurial experiences)**.

The text explicitly states: ""在這種情況下，回想起過去的創業行為及成功經驗，可幫助人們樂於接受當地教會的新改變與新方向。(In this situation, recalling past entrepreneurial achievements and successful experiences can help people be willing to accept the new changes and direction of the local church.)""

While understanding the organization's history (D), values (C), and influential figures (B) can contribute to a broader understanding, the text specifically highlights the benefit of remembering *successful entrepreneurial experiences* in easing fear of change.
"
根據文章，瞭解自己的歷史有什麼幫助？,"The best answer is **C: 在組織中找到自己的位置 (Find one's place in the organization)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""儘管了解一個人的歷史並不代表了解文化，但這至少可以讓人理解他們在組織的歷史中處在什麼樣的位置上。"" (Although understanding a person's history doesn't mean understanding the culture, it at least allows people to understand where they are positioned in the organization's history.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 減少對變革的恐懼 (Reduce fear of change):** While understanding history *can* help reduce fear of change (as the passage mentions success stories easing fear), it's not the *primary* benefit highlighted.
* **B: 強化價值觀 (Strengthen values):**  The passage mentions discovering organizational values, but doesn't directly connect understanding personal history to strengthening *individual* values.
* **D: 改善創業行為 (Improve entrepreneurial behavior):**  The passage connects remembering past entrepreneurial experiences to accepting change, but doesn't directly link understanding personal history to improving entrepreneurial skills.

Therefore, option C is the most directly supported answer based on the provided text.
"
下列哪種說法正確描述了後現代學習方法？,"The correct answer is **D: 學習中沒有定則 (Learning has no rules)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""後現代的學習方法讓人能擺脫定則。學習的良方不只一種。"" (Postmodern learning methods allow us to break free from rules. There isn't just one cure for learning.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 某些學習經驗比其他學習經驗更有益 (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others):** This directly contradicts the passage's assertion that all learning is valuable and arises from the experience of the learner with the knowledge.
* **B: 學習應集中於我們相信我們將會經歷的事情 (Learning should focus on what we believe we will experience):** The passage argues *against* this, stating that often the learning experience doesn't align with what we expect or plan.
* **C: 某些學習方式比其他學習方式更好 (Some learning methods are better than other learning methods):** The passage emphasizes the lack of a single ""right"" way to learn.



Therefore, only option D accurately reflects the central idea of the passage.



"
下列哪種說法並未正確反映後現代學習方法？,"The correct answer is **B: 某些學習經驗應優先考慮於其他學習經驗 (Certain learning experiences should be prioritized over others)**.

Here's why:

The passage argues *against* prioritizing certain learning experiences. It emphasizes that learning happens in the *experience* of the learner interacting with knowledge.  The passage specifically points out that many things we learn from TV are things we'll *never* use. This implies that there's no inherent value or prioritization of learning certain skills over others; it's about the learning *process* itself, not the practical application of the knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage:

* **A: 有多種學習方式可以學習資訊 (Multiple ways to learn information):** The passage states, ""學習的良方不只一種 (There isn't just one remedy for learning)."" This directly supports the idea of multiple learning methods.
* **C: 學習經驗依賴於學習者和提供的知識 (Learning experiences depend on the learner and the provided knowledge):** This is the core argument of the passage.  Learning isn't a passive reception of information; it's an interaction between the learner and the content.
* **D: 可能永遠不會應用的知識仍然值得學習 (Knowledge that may never be applied is still worth learning):**  The passage illustrates this with examples like fixing cars or excavating ruins, which many people won't do. However, the value lies in the *experience* of learning about those things.



Therefore, option B directly contradicts the passage's central idea of valuing the learning *process* over the practical application of the learned knowledge.



"
在正常睡眠期間刻意喚醒後，下列哪些會干擾睡眠中斷的過程？,"The correct answer is **A: 閱讀一個半小時後再入睡 (Reading for an hour and a half before going back to sleep)**.

Here's why:

* **Sleep Interruption's Goal:** The goal of sleep interruption is to briefly awaken without fully waking, then return to sleep within a short timeframe (10-60 minutes). The idea is to capitalize on lighter sleep stages.

Let's analyze each option:

* **A: 閱讀一個半小時後再入睡 (Reading for an hour and a half before going back to sleep):** This is a **major interference**. Reading, even if it's calming material, stimulates the brain and makes it difficult to return to a light sleep stage quickly.  1.5 hours is far too long to spend awake before attempting to fall back asleep.

* **B: 使用浴室後馬上回床上 (Going straight back to bed after using the bathroom):** This is **acceptable**. Using the bathroom is a relatively passive activity and often leads to a quick return to sleep, especially if you're already somewhat drowsy.

* **C: 關掉床頭的鬧鐘，二十分鐘後再入睡 (Turning off the alarm clock and going back to sleep after 20 minutes):** This is **acceptable**.  20 minutes is within the recommended timeframe for returning to sleep after a brief interruption.

* **D: 醒來喝床頭櫃上瓶子裡的水 (Drinking water from a bottle on the nightstand after waking up):** This is **acceptable**. Drinking water can be a relatively passive activity and can help rehydrate, making it easier to fall back asleep. While it might slightly stimulate you, it's generally less disruptive than reading.



Therefore, reading for an hour and a half before trying to return to sleep is the most significant interference with the sleep interruption process.



"
下列哪個不是關於睡眠中斷的正確描述？,"The correct answer is **D: 喚醒後，目標是在兩個小時內重新入睡 (After waking up, the goal is to fall back asleep within two hours)**.

Here's why:

* **The definition of sleep disruption explicitly states:** ""...又在短時間內（10-60 分鐘後）入睡的過程。"" ( ...and falling back asleep within a short time (10-60 minutes)).  It doesn't specify a two-hour timeframe.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct:

* **A: 可以是基於生理週期的 (Can be based on physiological cycles):** The text mentions drinking fluids as a physiological method.
* **B: 目標是不要完全喚醒自己 (The goal is not to fully wake yourself up):**  The text emphasizes a state of awareness without full wakefulness.
* **C: 過程發生在正常睡眠期間 (The process occurs during normal sleep):** The text clearly states it's done ""during regular sleep.""



Therefore, option D is the only one that contradicts the provided definition of sleep disruption.
"
當大腦嘗試更頻繁地做清醒夢時，什麼東西會增加？,"The correct answer is **A: 快速動眼期的次數 (Number of REM cycles)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""清醒夢增加了快速動眼期狀態的間隔時間。"" (Lucid dreaming increases the interval time of REM states.)
* **The question asks:** ""當大腦嘗試更頻繁地做清醒夢時，什麼東西會增加？"" (When the brain tries to have more frequent lucid dreams, what increases?)
* **The logic:** If you're having more frequent lucid dreams, and each lucid dream increases the *interval time of REM cycles*, it logically follows that you're experiencing *more* REM cycles overall.  The passage isn't saying the duration of REM cycles changes, just the *frequency* with which they are interrupted by lucid dreaming.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 能量水平 (Energy levels):** The passage implies fatigue, so increased energy levels would be the opposite of what's happening.
* **C: 修復階段的長度 (Duration of repair phase):** The passage says REM sleep is for physical repair, and reducing REM sleep negatively impacts repair.  The passage states lucid dreaming *increases* the interval, not necessarily changing the *duration* of the REM phase itself (although it could indirectly).
* **D: 快速動眼期的間隔時間 (Interval time of REM cycles):** The passage *explicitly states* that lucid dreaming *increases* the interval time. The question is asking what *increases* when lucid dreaming happens more often, so this is the opposite of what's being asked.



Therefore, the answer is **A**.
"
下列哪一項是頻繁做清醒夢可能對身體產生的負面影響？,"The correct answer is **D: 每晚的快速動眼期增加 (Increased REM sleep each night)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that frequent lucid dreaming *increases* the time spent in REM sleep. The passage also explains that REM sleep is crucial for physical restoration.  Therefore, increasing the duration of REM sleep (through frequent lucid dreaming) can lead to fatigue.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 快速動眼期的間隔時間減少 (Decreased REM sleep intervals):** The passage says lucid dreaming *increases* REM intervals, not decreases them.
*   **B: 每晚的快速動眼期減少 (Decreased REM sleep each night):** The passage indicates lucid dreaming *increases* the time spent in REM sleep.
*   **C: 依賴清醒夢 (Dependence on lucid dreams):** The passage doesn't mention dependence as a negative effect.



"
根據文章，傳統團隊和虛擬團隊有何相似之處？,"The correct answer is **A: 兩個團隊都被期望在同一水準上表現 (Both teams are expected to perform at the same level)**.

Here's why:

* The first sentence of the prompt explicitly states: ""虛擬團隊必須遵守跟傳統團隊一樣的品質標準..."" (Virtual teams must adhere to the same quality standards as traditional teams...).  This directly indicates the similarity in performance expectations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 兩個團隊在日常工作中都有不同程度的自主權 (Both teams have a degree of autonomy in their daily work):** While the prompt mentions virtual teams often have *more* autonomy, it doesn't state traditional teams lack autonomy. It simply highlights a difference in the *degree* of autonomy.
* **C: 兩個團隊都向一個無形的管理團隊報告 (Both teams report to an invisible management team):** The prompt mentions ""隱形管理團隊"" (invisible management team) as a unique feature of virtual teams, not traditional teams.
* **D: 兩個團隊都在相同時區運作 (Both teams operate in the same time zone):** The prompt states that virtual teams often have members in different time zones, which is a key difference from traditional teams.



"
根據文章，關於實體團隊和虛擬團隊，以下哪個說法不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 傳統團隊比虛擬團隊自主權較少**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""虛擬團隊成員通常比傳統團隊成員擁有更多的自主權..."" (Virtual team members often have more autonomy than traditional team members...)
* **Option A:** The passage states virtual teams *must* meet the same quality standards as traditional teams, implying the standards aren't necessarily *higher* for traditional teams.  While it doesn't explicitly say standards are *lower*, it doesn't contradict the idea that virtual teams also meet high standards.
* **Option B:** The passage clearly states virtual team members often act as the point of contact for their physical team.
* **Option D:** The passage explicitly mentions that coordinating across time zones is a factor in virtual team dynamics.

Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the provided text is that traditional teams have less autonomy than virtual teams."
以下哪一項不是內容理論所關注的內容？,"The correct answer is **B: 一個人的環境如何影響他們的行為 (A person's environment and how it influences their behavior)**.

Here's why:

* **Content theories** focus on *what* motivates people – the underlying needs and desires. They explore the content of those needs.
* **Option A (成年後具體化的新慾望 - Newly crystallized desires in adulthood)** aligns with content theories, as it refers to the specific desires that develop over time.
* **Option C (內化的需求 - Inculcated needs)** is also a core element of content theories, as they examine how needs are internalized.
* **Option D (了解人們的喜好 - Understanding people's preferences)** directly relates to identifying what makes people motivated, which is the essence of content theories.
* **Option B (一個人的環境如何影響他們的行為 - How a person's environment influences their behavior)** is more aligned with **process theories**, which focus on *how* motivation works and the mechanisms through which it drives behavior.  Content theories don't primarily focus on the environmental factors driving behavior, but rather the internal drivers themselves.



Therefore, the statement about the environment is not a central focus of content theories."
以下哪項不是三分法法則的對象？,"The correct answer is **B: 在照片中創造生命和能量 (In a photo, create life and energy)**.

Here's why:

* **三分法 (Rule of Thirds)** is primarily about composition and placement. It's a guideline for *where* to put your subject, not about injecting life and energy into the photo. While a well-composed image *can* be more engaging, that's a consequence of good composition, not the rule's direct purpose.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the rule:

* **A: 為主題的可能位置建立基準線 (Establish reference lines for possible positions of the subject):** This is the core principle of the rule – dividing the frame into thirds to help position the subject.
* **C: 將主題保持在特定且有效的位置 (Keep the subject in a specific and effective position):**  The rule guides you to place the subject at one of the intersections of the lines, which is considered a visually effective position.
* **D: 在照片中建立秩序 (Create order in the photo):**  The rule provides a framework for arranging elements in a balanced and harmonious way, leading to a more ordered composition.



Therefore, option B is the least accurate description of the rule of thirds.



"
以下哪一項並非描述 35 公釐的攝影格式？,"The correct answer is **C: 與許多常見格式具有不同的長寬比 (Has a different aspect ratio than many common formats)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the aspect ratio of 35mm is 3:2.**  The passage also says many common formats *are equal to or close to* this aspect ratio.  Therefore, it *doesn't* have a different aspect ratio than many common formats.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 仍在生產中 (Is still in production):** The passage explicitly states this.
* **B: 是數位相機所採用的格式 (Is the format adopted by digital cameras):** The passage states that the sensor specifications of digital cameras have adopted the aspect ratio of the 35mm format.
* **D: 是世界上最常見的格式 (Is the most common format in the world):** The passage states that it *was* the main film format during the analog era and *remains* widely used, implying it's still one of the most common.



"
根據文章，隨著製造商提高鏡頭生產品質，變焦鏡頭得到了哪些改善？,"The correct answer is **C: 它們的照片品質與固定焦距的鏡頭相似 (They can produce photo quality comparable to prime lenses.)**

The passage explicitly states: ""隨著鏡片製造商的鏡片生產達到更高水準，這已不再成為問題。 這已能使變焦鏡頭拍出與定焦鏡頭不相上下的照片品質。"" (As lens manufacturers' lens production reaches a higher level, this is no longer a problem. This now enables zoom lenses to take photos that are no worse than those taken with prime lenses.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 它們有更高的鏡頭速度 (They have higher lens speed):** The passage states the opposite - zoom lenses typically have *lower* maximum aperture (speed).
* **B: 它們在低光源條件下更易於使用 (They are easier to use in low light conditions):**  The passage says low maximum aperture makes them *harder* to use in low light.
* **D: 它們比定焦鏡頭具有較少的焦點複雜度 (They have less focal complexity than prime lenses):** The passage states the opposite - zoom lenses have *more* focal complexity.



"
根據文章中的資訊，何時使用變焦鏡頭可能會比定焦鏡頭更好呢？,"The correct answer is **None of the above**. Here's why:

* **The passage states that lens manufacturing has improved, making the complexity and lens element count differences between zoom and prime lenses less of a concern.**  Therefore, option B is incorrect.

* **The passage explicitly states that zoom lenses *typically* have lower maximum apertures (slower speeds), making them less ideal for low-light situations.**  Therefore, option A and C are incorrect.

* **The passage mentions that zoom lenses can achieve image quality comparable to prime lenses.** Therefore, option D is incorrect.

The passage *doesn't* say when a zoom lens is better. It focuses on the trade-offs. It implies that zoom lenses are useful for their versatility (covering a range of focal lengths) *even if* the image quality or maximum aperture isn't quite as good as a prime lens.

However, if I *had* to choose the *least* wrong answer, it would be **C: 如果不想在較暗的環境中使用閃光燈**. This is because the passage states that the lower maximum aperture of zoom lenses makes them difficult to use in low light *without a flash*. So, someone *might* choose a zoom lens if they want to avoid using a flash altogether, even if it means compromising on aperture. But it's still not a definitive ""better"" situation.

**Therefore, the best answer is that none of the provided options accurately reflect the information in the passage.**  The question is flawed.
"
以下哪一項不是神秘主義的正確描述？,"The correct answer is **D: 強調尋求直接的個人體驗與許多其他形式的宗教信仰和崇拜差不多** (Emphasizes seeking direct personal experience is the same as many other forms of religious faith and worship).

Here's why:

* **The provided text explicitly states that a key distinction of mysticism is the emphasis on direct, personal experience.** It highlights the pursuit of specific practices designed to *cultivate* these experiences. 
* Options A, B, and C all align with the description in the text.  Mysticism *does* emphasize peaceful/happy states, the pursuit of spiritual awakening, and the use of practices to facilitate insight.
* Option D directly contradicts the core characteristic of mysticism as presented in the text. Mysticism *is* different because of its focus on individual experience, unlike many other religious traditions which may place more emphasis on dogma, ritual, or authority.



Therefore, D is the statement that *isn't* a correct description of mysticism based on the provided text."
根據文章，以下哪一項不是神秘主義的重點？,"The correct answer is **B: 透過共享的社群體驗追求洞察力**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the *individual* experience of mystical practices. It highlights the pursuit of direct, personal encounters with the divine and the cultivation of specific states of consciousness.  While shared experiences *might* occur, they are not presented as a core tenet of mysticism itself. The focus is on the individual's inner journey.

Let's look at why the other options *are* key to mysticism according to the text:

* **A: 追求神性實相的直覺:** The passage explicitly mentions seeking direct experience, intuition, and insight into the divine.
* **C: 強調喜悅的意識狀態:**  The passage states that mystical experiences can include peace, insight, joy, and even ecstatic states.
* **D: 追求對上帝的意識覺醒:**  The passage mentions seeking a connection, identification, or awakening to the divine.



Therefore, option B is the only one that doesn't align with the emphasis on individual experience and direct encounter within the definition of mysticism provided.



"
根據文章，哪個族群可能開創了農業社會？,"The correct answer is **C: 玻里尼西亞的毛利人 (Polynesian Maori)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""該理論隨後確立一個觀點，認為毛利人乘坐大艦隊，自玻里尼西亞開始遷徙，然後從莫里奧里人手中奪取紐西蘭，並建立一個農業社會。""

This directly attributes the establishment of an agricultural society to the **Polynesian Maori** who arrived from Polynesia. The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: 來自紐西蘭的莫里奧里人 (Moriorians from New Zealand):** The passage says the Moriorians were *displaced*, not the ones who established the agricultural society.
* **B: 來自查特姆群島的莫里奧里人 (Moriorians from the Chatham Islands):**  The passage describes them as developing a *unique peaceful culture* and experiencing conflict and eventual extinction – they didn't establish the agricultural society.
* **D: 來自大陸的毛利人 (Maori from the mainland):** The passage doesn't mention any group from the mainland establishing an agricultural society.

Therefore, based on the provided text, the Polynesian Maori are the ones credited with establishing the agricultural society.
"
根據文章，獵殺恐鳥的群體是哪個地方的第一批居民？,"The correct answer is **B: 紐西蘭 (New Zealand)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""十九到二十世紀的很長一段時間，人們都相信紐西蘭的第一批居民是毛利人，他們會獵捕稱為恐鳥的巨鳥。"" (For a long period from the 19th to 20th centuries, people believed that the first inhabitants of New Zealand were Maori, who hunted giant birds called moa.)

The passage then goes on to discuss the later findings about the Moriori people being a branch of Maori who migrated *from* New Zealand. Therefore, the initial belief was that the first inhabitants of *New Zealand* were Maori.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 大陸 (Continent)** - The passage doesn't mention a continent as the first inhabitants.
*   **C: 查特姆群島 (Chatham Islands)** - The passage discusses the Moriori people as a group *from* the Chatham Islands, not the initial inhabitants.
*   **D: 玻里尼西亞 (Polynesia)** - The passage mentions the migration *from* Polynesia to New Zealand, but not that Polynesians were the first inhabitants.



"
在哪種情況下，使用摺紙的淨土法會對折紙者有益？,"The correct answer is **D: 折紙者只在之前試過一兩次 (The origami artist has only tried origami once or twice before).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Pureland method was developed to help **new or less flexible origami practitioners**.  Someone who has only tried origami a couple of times would fall into this category.
* The method's restriction to single folds and no reverse folds makes it ideal for beginners to learn the basic principles of origami without getting overwhelmed by complexity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 折紙者喜歡一次多褶 (The origami artist likes to make multiple folds at once):** The Pureland method *restricts* multiple folds.
* **B: 折紙者有進階的動作技能 (The origami artist has advanced dexterity skills):**  The Pureland method is designed for those *without* advanced dexterity.
* **C: 折紙者正在創作需要反摺的摺紙作品 (The origami artist is creating a project that requires reverse folds):**  The Pureland method *specifically avoids* reverse folds.



"
以下哪個不是淨土摺紙的正確描述？,"The correct answer is **A: 它是專為有經驗的折紙者設計的 (It is designed for experienced origami artists)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Pureland folding was developed to help **beginners or those with less dexterity**.  Therefore, it's *not* designed for experienced artists.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: 該方法不包括反摺 (This method does not include reverse folds):** The passage says Pureland folding *cannot* use reverse folds.
* **C: 每摺必須有明確的位置 (Each fold must have a defined position):** The passage states this as a core characteristic of Pureland folding.
* **D: 這是適合不靈活的摺紙練習者的好方法 (This is a good method for origami practitioners with limited dexterity):** The passage explicitly mentions this as a purpose of the folding method.



"
根據文章，哪個地點與印度河流域文明無關？,"The correct answer is **C: 阿富汗東北部所有地區**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the Indus Valley Civilization's range included ""印度西北及阿富汗東北的部分地區"" (the northwestern part of India and the northeastern part of Afghanistan).  Option C says *all* of Afghanistan's northeast is irrelevant, which is incorrect based on the passage.
* Options A, B, and D are all mentioned as being associated with the Indus Valley Civilization (Harappa is a key site, the Saraswati River was a possible contributing river, and much of modern-day Pakistan was within its territory).

Therefore, the only option that the passage implies is *not* part of the civilization's territory is C.
"
文中沒有提到以下何者為青銅時代文明可能的名稱？,"The correct answer is **D: 印度河谷文明**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions **印度河流域文明 (Indus Valley Civilization)**, **印度-薩拉斯瓦蒂文明 (Indus-Saraswati Civilization)**, and **哈拉帕文明 (Harappan Civilization)** as possible names for the civilization.
* The passage does **not** mention **印度河谷文明 (Indus Valley Civilization)**. While the translation is similar, the passage uses ""印度河流域文明"" specifically.

Therefore, option D is the only one not mentioned in the passage.
"
根據文章，以下何者產生了長期效益？,"The correct answer is **A: 與他人合作 (Cooperation with others)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""希望多數人終將明白他們長期的最佳選擇是與他人合作。"" (Hope that most people will eventually realize that their best long-term choice is to cooperate with others.) This directly links cooperation to long-term benefits.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 優先考慮自身利益 (Prioritizing one's own interests):** The passage frames self-interest as beneficial in the short-term but not the long-term.
* **C: 強調有利於少數人而非多數人的事物 (Emphasizing things that benefit a minority rather than the majority):** This is the opposite of what the passage advocates.
* **D: 認知到貪婪可以是有益的 (Recognizing that greed can be beneficial):** The passage is trying to overcome greed and selfishness.



"
根據文章，如果某人著重於眼前的效益，他們可能會優先考慮以下哪項？,"The correct answer is **D: 自私 (Selfish)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""合作的本質就是當大多數人受益時，自私的行為在短期總能得到更多利益"" which translates to ""The essence of cooperation is that when most people benefit, selfish behavior can always gain more benefits in the short term."" This directly indicates that focusing on immediate benefits leads to selfish actions.
"
根據文章，誰支付了很大一部分戰爭費用？,"The correct answer is **D: 菲律賓人民**.

The passage states: ""他們被迫繳稅給美國殖民政權，支付大部分的政府開支..."" which translates to ""They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime and pay most of the government expenses...""  Since ""they"" refers to the Filipino people, the Filipino people paid the majority of the war expenses.

While the Filipino government was the entity *paying* the taxes, the *people* ultimately bore the burden of those taxes and the resulting expenses.
"
哪個時期出現在聖殿騎士團時期之前？,"The correct answer is **C: 中世紀初期 (Early Middle Ages)**.

The text states that the period before the High Middle Ages (when the Knights Templar existed) is called the Early Middle Ages. Therefore, the Early Middle Ages came *before* the time of the Knights Templar.
"
哪個時期出現在聖殿騎士團時期之後？,"The correct answer is **A: 中世紀晚期 (Late Middle Ages)**.

The passage states that the period when the Knights Templar existed (11th, 12th, and 13th centuries) is known as the High Middle Ages. The passage then says this is followed by the Late Middle Ages. Therefore, the Late Middle Ages came *after* the Knights Templar period.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 12 世紀 (12th Century):** This is *within* the period of the Knights Templar.
*   **C: 中世紀盛期 (High Middle Ages):** This is the *same* period as the Knights Templar.
*   **D: 11 世紀 (11th Century):** This is also *within* the period of the Knights Templar."
在羅馬帝國，醫生和外科醫生沒有提到以下哪種醫療或手術？,"The correct answer is **A: 使用各種鎮靜劑治療創傷後壓力症候群 (Using various sedatives to treat post-traumatic stress disorder)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that Roman doctors knew about sedatives like morphine (from poppies) and scopolamine (from henbane).** This directly supports option B.
* **The passage details the Romans' skill in amputations and their use of tourniquets and artery clamps to prevent further damage from gangrene.** This supports options C and D.
* **However, the passage does *not* mention treating post-traumatic stress disorder.**  PTSD is a modern psychological condition, and the Romans did not have the understanding or vocabulary to diagnose or treat it in the way we do today.  While they certainly dealt with trauma, it's not linked to the information provided in the text.

Therefore, option A is the only one that is *not* supported by the information given in the passage.
"
根據文章，以下哪個選項不是羅馬帝國醫療領域進步的原因？,"The correct answer is **B: 帝國積極的軍事政策 (The Empire's proactive military policy)**.

Here's why:

The passage directly links the Roman Empire's *militaristic nature* (軍國主義) to medical advancements. It mentions that Emperor Augustus recruited doctors and established a medical corps for veterans. This links military activity to the *funding and impetus* for medical development.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

*   **A: 醫療團的成立 (Establishment of medical corps):** The passage explicitly states the formation of the first medical corps for post-war care.
*   **C: 建立學習型醫院 (Establishment of teaching hospitals):** While not directly mentioned, the passage implies a development of medical knowledge and practice that would naturally lead to more sophisticated medical institutions, and the recruitment of doctors suggests a need for training and specialized facilities.
*   **D: 皇帝招募醫生 (Emperor recruiting doctors):** The passage directly states that Augustus began recruiting doctors, which is a key factor in the development of Roman medicine.

Therefore, while the military played a role in *creating the conditions* for medical advancement, the passage does *not* say that the empire's military policy itself was a direct *cause* of the medical advances. The recruitment of doctors and the establishment of medical corps were more direct causes.



"
視力的能力取決於什麼？,"The best answer is **A: 視覺系統的感覺器官 (The sensory organs of the visual system)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""視力，或視物的能力，來自視覺系統的感覺器官或眼睛。(Vision, or the ability to see, comes from the sensory organs of the visual system or the eyes.)""  This directly answers the question of what vision *depends* on.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: 生物體的需求 (Biological needs)** - While the complexity of eye structures *is* related to biological needs, the fundamental source of vision is the sensory organs themselves.  Biological needs are a *factor* in the design, not the primary determinant of vision's ability.
* **C: 對某些波長的敏感度 (Sensitivity to certain wavelengths)** - This is *part* of the function of the visual system, but not the core thing vision depends on.  It describes *what* the sensory organs detect, not *what enables* vision.
* **D: 不同程度的視力 (Different degrees of vision)** - This is a consequence of the visual system's structure and function, not the fundamental thing that allows vision to occur. It describes the *quality* of vision, not its basis.



Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer is **A**."
生物體之間的眼睛結構變化取決於什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 生物體的要求 (The requirements of the organism)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""各構造的複雜度依其對有機體需求不同而有差別"" which translates to ""The complexity of each structure varies depending on the different needs of the organism.""  This directly indicates that the structure of an eye changes based on what the organism *needs* to see.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 波長的敏感度 (Sensitivity to wavelengths):** While wavelength sensitivity is *a* factor, it's a *result* of the organism's needs, not the determining factor itself.  Different organisms need to see different wavelengths (e.g., ultraviolet, infrared).
* **C: 敏銳度的程度 (Degree of acuity):** Similar to wavelength sensitivity, acuity is a *characteristic* determined by the organism's needs.  An organism that hunts needs high acuity.
* **D: 生物體的複雜性 (The complexity of the organism):**  While an organism's complexity *might* influence eye structure, the primary driver is what the organism *needs* to accomplish visually, not just its overall complexity.



Therefore, **B** is the most direct and accurate answer based on the provided text."
根據文章，關於錫克教的陳述，何者沒有正確描述該宗教？,"The correct answer is **B: 上師是錫克教特有的基本面向 (Guru is a unique aspect of Sikhism)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the concept of ""Guru"" is a foundational element in *all* Indian religions. While the Guru is *extremely* important in Sikhism (referred to as Gurmat), it is not unique to Sikhism.  It's a common element in Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

* **A: 錫克教是印度教傳統中宗派分裂的結果 (Sikhism originated as a sect split from the Hindu tradition):** The passage explicitly states this.
* **C: 在該宗教創始人古魯那奈克之後，有九位大師跟隨 (Nine masters followed the founder Guru Nanak):**  The passage directly mentions that nine masters followed Guru Nanak.
* **D: 錫克教的某些傳統源自於印度教 (Some traditions of Sikhism originate from Hinduism):** The passage states they acknowledge their roots in Hinduism.



Therefore, the only inaccurate statement is that the Guru is a unique element to Sikhism, as it is a broader concept within Indian religious traditions.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項被認為是錫克教信仰體系的核心面向？,"The correct answer is **A: 上師的概念 (The concept of the Guru)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""錫克教徒將他們的信仰稱為古馬特 (Gurmat)，在旁遮普語中意指「上師之道」。上師是所有印度信仰的基礎，但在錫克教裡，上師構成了整個信仰的重要核心。"" (Sikhs call their faith Gurmat, meaning ""the way of the Guru"" in Punjabi. The Guru is the foundation of all Indian faiths, but in Sikhism, the Guru forms the core of the entire faith.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 印度教傳統 (Hindu traditions):** While the passage acknowledges Sikhism's roots in Hinduism, it also emphasizes that Sikhism has distinct beliefs.
* **C: 拒絕承認其他印度宗教 (Rejecting other Indian religions):** The passage doesn't mention rejecting other religions; it speaks of a distinct path within the broader Indian religious landscape.
* **D: 講旁遮普語 (Speaking Punjabi):**  While the passage mentions Punjabi as the language of ""Gurmat,"" it doesn't suggest that speaking Punjabi *is* a core aspect of Sikh belief itself. It's more about the language used to express the faith.



"
根據文章，注意力缺失症的孩子可能難以專注於哪些事情？,"The correct answer is **A: 學校作業 (Schoolwork)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""患有注意力缺失症的兒童，很難專注於學校作業之類的事物..."" (Children with ADHD have difficulty concentrating on things like schoolwork...)

While the passage mentions they *can* focus on enjoyable activities like playing games or watching cartoons, it emphasizes their difficulty with schoolwork. Option D, ""他們喜歡做的事,"" is too broad.
"
根據文章，為什麼注意力缺失症的孩子傾向於從事危險行為？,"The correct answer is **D: 刺激他們的大腦 (Stimulate their brains)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""因為他們不能用尋常的方法刺激大腦，要「做出危險的行為、牽扯進打架並挑戰權威」才能刺激大腦。"" (Because they cannot stimulate their brains in ordinary ways, they resort to ""making dangerous behaviors, getting involved in fights and challenging authority"" to stimulate their brains.)

Therefore, option D directly reflects the information provided in the text. The other options are incorrect based on the passage:

*   **A: 減少過動 (Reduce hyperactivity):** The passage says they *aren't* able to stimulate their brains in normal ways.
*   **B: 幫助他們與同儕建立聯繫 (Help them build relationships with peers):** The passage states the opposite - it *hinders* their relationships with peers.
*   **C: 為了得到父母的關注 (To get their parents' attention):** The passage doesn't mention this as a reason."
根據文章中的資訊，以下哪一項不是鷹架式學習的例子？,"The correct answer is **C: 獨立自學課程 (Independent study courses)**.

Here's why:

* **The article defines scaffolding as *support* for learning a new skill or tackling a new project.** It's a temporary aid that's gradually removed as the learner becomes more proficient.

Let's look at why the other options are examples:

* **A: 電腦遊戲開始時的教學 (Tutorials at the start of a computer game):** This is a clear example of a virtual scaffold – providing instructions and guidance when learning the game's mechanics.
* **B: SAT 輔導老師 (SAT tutoring teacher):** A tutor provides support and guidance as a student learns new test-taking strategies, acting as a scaffold.
* **D: 小聯盟教練 (Little League coach):** A coach offers instructions, tips, and encouragement to help players learn new skills and strategies, providing a real-world scaffold.

* **C: 獨立自學課程 (Independent study courses):**  These courses are designed to be self-directed, with minimal external support. They are the *opposite* of scaffolding.  The learner is expected to learn independently without significant assistance.



Therefore, independent study courses are not examples of scaffolding. They represent a learning environment that actively avoids it.
"
關於鷹架式學習的概念，以下哪一項描述不正確？,"The correct answer is **C: 它也被稱為專題式學習 (It is also called project-based learning)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states that scaffolding is NOT project-based learning.** It says project-based learning makes learning easier and more fun, and scaffolding builds upon that. They are distinct concepts.
* **A: 鷹架可以是虛擬的 (Scaffolding can be virtual):** This is **correct** according to the text, which mentions built-in virtual scaffolding in software.
* **B: 它更像是輔助而非學習方法 (It's more like an aid than a learning method):** This is **correct** according to the text, which defines scaffolding as a supportive aid.
* **D: 鷹架用於在學習經驗開始時提供支援 (Scaffolding is used to provide support at the beginning of a learning experience):** This is **correct**. The text says it helps people navigate new learning experiences.



Therefore, option C is the only statement that contradicts the provided text."
根據文章，以下哪個 MySpace 功能可以幫助閱讀有困難的學生？,"The correct answer is **C: 一個網址 (One URL)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""只要提供一個網址就可以輕易開啟這個網頁，這對在使用鍵盤或拼字上有困難的學生來說，更容易記憶與輸入。"" (As long as you provide one URL, you can easily open this page, which makes it easier for students who have difficulty using a keyboard or spelling to remember and enter.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 自訂功能 (Customization features):** While customization allows for easier readability through color adjustments, it doesn't directly address difficulty with remembering or entering the website address.
* **B: 部落格 (Blogs):** Blogs are a feature of MySpace, but not specifically mentioned as helping students with reading difficulties.
* **D: 5400 萬個人檔案 (54 million profiles):** The number of profiles is a statistic about MySpace's popularity, not a feature that helps students with reading difficulties.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項不是赫魯雪夫對工人暴動的回應？,"The correct answer is **C: 增加減薪幅度 (Increase wage cuts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Khrushchev *made concessions* on some economic demands and *agreed to appoint* Władysław Gomułka.  This directly contradicts the idea of *increasing* wage cuts.  He was responding to the protests, not escalating them.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 任命新總理 (Appointing a new prime minister):**  The passage explicitly mentions Khrushchev appointing Gomułka, who was popular.
* **B: 使用坦克恢復秩序 (Using tanks to restore order):** The passage states Khrushchev sent tanks to quell the unrest.
* **D: 承認一些經濟要求 (Acknowledging some economic demands):** The passage states Khrushchev made concessions on economic demands.



"
以下哪一項不是波蘭騷亂的原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 任命瓦迪斯瓦夫·哥穆爾卡 (Appointing Władysław Gomułka)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the protests were *caused by* food shortages and wage cuts, and *escalated into* a protest against communism.
* The appointment of Gomułka was a *result* of the protests, a concession made by Khrushchev. It wasn't a cause of the unrest.

Therefore, the only option that *wasn't* a cause of the Polish unrest is the appointment of Gomułka. The other options (food shortages, wage cuts, and communism) are explicitly mentioned as contributing factors.
"
根據文章，以下哪一項未影響蘇聯和美國之間的關係？,"The correct answer is **B: 對德國的看法 (View of Germany)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that conflicts arose *after* World War II due to differences in systems, practices, and culture. It mentions that Germany being a common enemy *initially* led to cooperation. Therefore, the initial shared perspective on Germany isn't presented as a factor that *caused* the later conflict. The other options (cultural differences, differing practices, and system disputes) are all directly linked to the breakdown of the alliance and the onset of the Cold War.
"
關於發送神經脈衝的目的，以下哪一項描述不正確？,"The correct answer is **A: 減緩血液流動 (Slow down blood flow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the nervous system *maintains* blood flow and *helps* the body avoid threats.** This implies the nervous system actively works to *regulate* blood flow (B) and protect the body (D).
* **Maintaining homeostasis (體內恆定) is explicitly mentioned as a function of the nervous system.** (C)
* **Option A, slowing down blood flow, is the opposite of what the passage describes.** The nervous system aims to keep systems functioning properly, and slowing down blood flow would likely be detrimental in most situations.

Therefore, A is the incorrect statement.
"
在吉薩高原上可以找到什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 墓穴** and **B: 寺廟** and **D: 大金字塔**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""吉薩高原或「吉薩金字塔群」，包含好幾座金字塔（其中大金字塔是世界上最大的金字塔）、幾座小陵墓、幾座神廟和巨大的獅身人面像。"" (The Giza plateau or ""Giza pyramid complex"" includes several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and a giant sphinx.)
*   Option A (墓穴 - Tombs) is correct because the text mentions ""幾座小陵墓"" (several small tombs).
*   Option B (寺廟 - Temples) is correct because the text mentions ""幾座神廟"" (several temples).
*   Option D (大金字塔 - The Great Pyramid) is correct because the text directly mentions ""大金字塔"" (the Great Pyramid).
*   Option C (所有七大奇蹟 - All Seven Wonders) is incorrect because the text states that the Great Pyramid is the *only* remaining wonder of the ancient world.

Since the question asks what can be found on the Giza plateau, and the text lists tombs, temples, and the Great Pyramid, the best answer is a combination of A, B and D. However, since we only need to choose one, D is the most direct and specific answer.
"
大金字塔的建造目的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 榮耀一位法老 (Honor a pharaoh)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""大金字塔是為了榮耀古夫法老所建造的 (The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu).""
"
我們會認識燒毀神殿的縱火犯一事是誰該負責？,"The correct answer is **A: 以弗所人**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""憤怒的以弗所人宣告黑若斯達特斯之名永遠都不會載入史冊。"" This directly indicates that the people of Ephesus were the ones who declared that Charophilis' name would be erased from history as a consequence of his actions.  They were the ones holding him accountable.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: 亞歷山大大帝:** He offered to fund the rebuilding but wasn't responsible for the initial arson.
* **C: 史特拉波:** He noted Charophilis' name *after* the event, he wasn't responsible for the fire.
* **D: 阿緹密絲:** She was the goddess the temple was dedicated to, not a perpetrator of the arson."
關於重建阿緹密絲神廟的說法，何者正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 神殿在亞歷山大大帝統治後重建 (The temple was rebuilt after Alexander the Great's reign)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""亞歷山大作為國王主動提議出資重建神廟，但他的提議遭到否決。亞歷山大死後，神廟才於公元前 323 年被重建起來."" (Alexander, as king, proactively offered to finance the reconstruction of the temple, but his proposal was rejected. The temple was only rebuilt in 323 BC after Alexander's death.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 重建費用由亞歷山大大帝支付 (The reconstruction cost was paid by Alexander the Great):** The text says Alexander *offered* to pay, but his offer was rejected.
* **C: 黑若斯達特斯被命令支付重建費用 (Chrysippus was ordered to pay the reconstruction cost):**  The text states Chrysippus started the fire, but there's no mention of him being ordered to pay for the reconstruction.
* **D: 神殿於公元前 320 年重建 (The temple was rebuilt in 320 BC):** The text clearly states it was rebuilt in 323 BC.



"
根據文章，用兩條腿走路的物種最早出現於何時？,"The correct answer is **A: 七百萬年前**.

The passage states: ""儘管查德人猿可能早在七百萬年前就已用雙足行走。"" which translates to ""Although Sahelanthropus tchadensis may have already walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.""  While the text then goes on to discuss *Homo erectus* and *Australopithecus*, the earliest mention of bipedalism is 7 million years ago, attributed to Sahelanthropus tchadensis.



"
這些物種中，哪一個習慣用兩隻腳行走？,"The correct answer is **B: 直立人 (Homo Erectus)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Homo Erectus started walking upright 2 million years ago and that they *adapted* to bipedalism (walking on two legs).
* The passage mentions Australopithecus showed bipedal characteristics between 4.2 and 3.9 million years ago, but it doesn't say they *primarily* walked on two legs or that it was a defining characteristic.
* The passage suggests that Sahelanthropus (查德沙赫人) might have walked upright 7 million years ago, but there isn't enough information to definitively say they were *known* to be bipedal.
* ""兩足動物特化"" (Bipedal animal specialization) is too broad of a term.

Therefore, the passage directly links Homo Erectus with the development and adoption of upright walking as a significant development.
"
德國海軍在二戰期間試圖達成什麼目的？,"The correct answer is **B: 阻止英國接收人員和貨物 (Preventing Britain from receiving personnel and supplies)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""於此同時，德國海軍則試圖阻斷運輸（主要使用 U 型潛艇）。""  This translates to ""At the same time, the German Navy attempted to disrupt the transport (mainly using U-boats).""
* The purpose of disrupting the transport was to prevent Britain from receiving necessary personnel and supplies, which would weaken their ability to continue fighting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 攔截從英國運來的物資 (Intercepting supplies being transported to Britain)** - While U-boats *did* intercept supplies, the ultimate goal wasn't just the interception itself. It was to prevent the supplies from *reaching* Britain.
* **C: 跨大西洋運輸物資 (Transporting supplies across the Atlantic)** - This describes the Allied effort, not the German one.
* **D: 阻止美國接收人員和貨物 (Preventing the US from receiving personnel and supplies)** -  The primary target was Britain, not the US. While the US certainly provided aid to Britain, the German naval strategy focused on disrupting the flow to the British Isles.



"
根據文中提供的資訊，誰在北大西洋戰役期間的海戰取得了最大的成功？,"The correct answer is **D: 英國**.

Here's why:

The text states that the US was *trying* to transport people and supplies to aid Britain. It also states that the *German Navy* was trying to *interrupt* those transports. The question asks who achieved the *greatest success*. The fact that the US was attempting to supply Britain implies that Britain was the recipient of successful deliveries. The text doesn't explicitly state who ""won"" the battle, but it highlights the German efforts to disrupt the US support for Britain, suggesting the British, with US help, ultimately *succeeded* in maintaining the supply lines. 

Therefore, based on the context, the British were the ones who achieved the greatest success in the Battle of the Atlantic. While the US played a crucial role in supporting them, the main goal was to keep Britain supplied.



"
亞述人使用騎兵時，哪一樣東西不存在？,"The correct answer is **A: 馬鞍 (Saddle)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""當時尚未發明馬鞍，因此亞述騎兵是騎在毫無裝備的馬背上作戰。"" (At that time, the saddle had not yet been invented, so Assyrian cavalry fought on the bare backs of horses.)

The other options are incorrect because the passage mentions:

*   **十字弓 (Crossbow):** ""致命的十字弓所射出的箭可穿透敵軍身上的盔甲。"" (The arrows shot from deadly crossbows could pierce enemy armor.)
*   **戰車 (Chariots):** ""幅條輪的發明讓亞述人的馬車更輕、更快..."" (The invention of spoked wheels made Assyrian chariots lighter and faster...)
*   **盔甲 (Armor):** ""致命的十字弓所射出的箭可穿透敵軍身上的盔甲。"" (The arrows shot from deadly crossbows could pierce enemy armor.)"
利用騎兵進行的戰鬥是如何進行的？,"The correct answer is **C: 騎馬 (Riding horses)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""騎兵是指一騎著馬作戰的軍隊。"" (Cavalry refers to an army that fights on horseback.)

While the passage also mentions they fought without saddles and armor, the fundamental aspect of cavalry is that they fight *on horseback*.
"
根據文章，在哪裡不會找到一個普通的巴比倫市民？,"The correct answer is **D: 在內部聖殿獻祭 (In the inner sanctuary offering sacrifices)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that only priests were allowed to enter the inner sanctuary (內部聖殿). 
* Common citizens (普通的巴比倫市民) would not have been permitted access.

Let's look at why the other options are likely correct:

* **A: 帶祭品到神廟中庭內 (Bringing offerings to the temple courtyard):** The passage mentions people preparing offerings and presenting them to the gods. The courtyard would be the place for this.
* **B: 在主要寺廟參加儀式 (Participating in ceremonies in the main temple):**  The passage mentions priests performing rituals and festivals. It's logical that people would participate in these events in the main temple.
* **C: 在神廟中庭內的節慶 (Festivals in the temple courtyard):** The passage specifically mentions festivals being held and the priests trying to meet the gods' needs through them. The courtyard would be the location of these festivities.



"
以下哪些是專為祭司而設的？,"The correct answer is **B: 內部聖殿 (Inner Sanctuary)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""接著是一間只有祭司才能進入的內部聖殿."" (Then came an inner sanctuary, which only priests could enter.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 節慶 (Festivals):**  The passage says people prepared sacrifices and priests worked to *satisfy the gods' needs* through festivals.  Festivals were for the general population, not exclusively for priests.
* **C: 儀式 (Rituals):**  The passage mentions rituals were part of satisfying the gods, but it doesn't say they were *only* for priests.  People participate in rituals.
* **D: 塔廟 (Ziggurats):** While priests might have performed special ceremonies *within* the upper sanctuary of a ziggurat, the ziggurat itself was a public structure with a large courtyard.  The entire structure wasn't *only* for priests.



"
圖坦卡門王在何時受到關注？,"The correct answer is **C: 在發現他的墳墓後 (After his tomb was discovered)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""然而，他的墳墓在 1922 年被發現了，這使他成為名人 (However, his tomb was discovered in 1922, which made him famous).""  This directly indicates that his fame arose from the discovery of his tomb.
"
是什麼讓圖坦卡門王成為著名的埃及王？,"The correct answer is **A: 發現他未受打擾的墳墓 (The discovery of his undisturbed tomb)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Tutankhamun was *not* important in ancient times and wasn't listed in many royal lists.
* The key factor in his fame is the undisturbed discovery of his tomb in 1922, which contained a wealth of well-preserved artifacts.
* Options B, C, and D are all incorrect because they contradict information presented in the passage.



"
希臘詩人荷馬無法做什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 看 (See)**.

The passage explicitly states that Homer was a ""legendary blind poet."" Therefore, he was unable to see.
"
哪個著名的希臘人以文學以外的東西而聞名？,"The correct answer is **C: 畢達哥拉斯**.

Here's why:

* The question asks who is known for something *other than* literature.
* The passage states:
    * Homer is famous for *epics* (poems).
    * Sophocles and Aristophanes are famous for *plays*.
    * Pythagoras is famous for a *mathematical theorem* about triangles.

Therefore, Pythagoras is the only one on the list known for something outside of literature.
"
猶太家族大部分時間都在哪裡度過？,"The correct answer is **A: 在戶外 (Outside)**.

The text explicitly states: ""猶太家族生活中大多時刻都是在室外度過 (Most of the time in the lives of Jewish families was spent outdoors).""
"
對猶太家族來說，什麼東西不是很重要？,"The correct answer is **C: 他們的家 (Their homes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""在中東的溫暖氣候中，房子就沒那麼重要了"" which translates to ""In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not that important.""

Therefore, their homes were not a priority for them. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他們的氣候 (Their climate):** The passage describes the climate *as* warm, and its influence on the importance of houses. It isn't something that was unimportant *to them*.
* **B: 他們的商店 (Their shops):** The passage says ""商店不過是一個對著大街的櫃檯"" (shops were just counters facing the street), indicating shops were a part of their life.
* **D: 他們的烹飪 (Their cooking):** The passage mentions ""婦女會在院子裡煮飯"" (women cooked in the courtyard), indicating cooking was a common activity.



"
以下哪個不是斯堪地納維亞國家之間的區別？,"The correct answer is **B: 土地 (Land)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that while all the countries are considered ""Scandinavian,"" they have differences in history, customs, and people. While land *does* differ between the countries, the passage highlights the *cultural and historical* differences as the focus of the contrasting elements. The question asks which *isn't* a difference, and land is presented as a commonality rather than a differentiating factor in the context of the passage.
"
誰是第一批定居在格陵蘭島的人？,"The correct answer is **A: 愛斯基摩部落 (Eskimo tribes)**.

The passage states: ""But no matter his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already inhabited it."" This directly answers the question of who was the first to settle Greenland."
哪一群人更喜歡不坐在椅子上用餐？,"The answer is **C: 富有的羅馬男性 (Wealthy Roman men)**.

The text states: ""窮人和女人坐在椅子上吃他們的食物時，富有的男人則喜歡一同參加宴席，並在席間側臥享用他們的大餐。""  This translates to: ""While the poor and women sat on chairs to eat their food, wealthy men preferred to join banquets and recline while enjoying their large meals.""

Therefore, wealthy Roman men preferred not to sit on chairs.
"
以下哪個不會是古羅馬宴會的一部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 烤火雞盤 (Roasted turkey platter)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ancient Romans did not eat foods that originated in the Americas or Asia, including turkey.

Let's look at why the other options *were* part of Roman banquets:

* **A: 貧窮的客人坐在椅子上用餐 (Poor guests sat on chairs to eat their food):** The passage states this was a difference in dining customs between the rich and poor.
* **B: 蝸牛開胃菜 (Snail appetizers):**  The passage specifically mentions snails as one of the unusual foods Romans ate.
* **C: 富有的男性在晚餐期間躺下來 (Wealthy men lay down during dinner):** The passage describes this as a custom of the wealthy.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項不太可能產生持久的影響？,"The correct answer is **B: 一個小文化 (A small culture)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""規模較小的文化往往不留歷史痕跡便消失殆盡，無法被認定為正統文明。"" (Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving historical traces and cannot be considered orthodox civilizations.)
* **The passage defines civilization:** as a shared unique culture by a large number of people living and working together in a collaborative way, with a long history and cultural legacy.
* **The other options are more likely to have lasting impact:**
    * **一個社會 (A society):**  A society is a building block of civilization and can have lasting effects.
    * **一個城邦 (A city-state):** City-states are described as precursors to nations and therefore can have lasting historical significance.
    * **一個文明文化 (A civilization culture):**  This is the core definition of civilization itself, implying lasting impact through accumulated knowledge and cultural tradition.



Therefore, a small culture is the least likely to have a lasting, widespread impact compared to the other options, according to the passage.
"
根據文章，國家的前身是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 一個城邦 (a city-state)**.

The text explicitly states: ""城邦是國家的前身，文明文化意指..."" which translates to ""City-states are the precursors to nations, and civilization culture means...""
"
關於杜克耶古堡的說法，哪個敘述不正確？,"The incorrect statement is **A: 它是為慶祝西藏蒙古軍隊勝利而建造的 (It was built to celebrate the victory of the Tibetan Mongol army.)**

The passage clearly states that the fortress was built by the Buddhist leader Chamjongawang Nangchen to commemorate his *victory* over the Tibetan Mongol army, not to celebrate their victory.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: 它位於不丹 (It is located in Bhutan):** The passage explicitly states ""杜克耶堡是位於帕羅區北方（Phondey 村內）的..."" which places it in Bhutan.
* **C: 火災摧毀了許多堡壘遺跡 (A fire destroyed many fortress ruins):** The passage says ""1951 年，一場大火使得杜克耶古堡只遺下了一部份的文物..."" which means the fire destroyed *part* of the ruins.
* **D: 它是由夏仲阿旺朗傑建造的 (It was built by Chamjongawang Nangchen):** The passage directly states ""據說在 1649 年，活佛夏仲阿旺朗傑為了紀念...而興建了該碉堡。""

Therefore, the only inaccurate statement is A.
"
下列哪個陳述正確描述了杜克耶古堡火災的結果？,"The correct answer is **A: 唯一倖存的遺跡是夏仲阿旺朗傑的畫像** (The only surviving relic is the portrait of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal).

Here's why:

* The text states: ""1951 年，一場大火使得杜克耶古堡只遺下了一部份的文物，像夏巴尊王的畫像。"" (In 1951, a fire left Dukye Dzong with only some relics, such as the portrait of Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 西藏蒙古軍隊勝利了** (The Tibetan Mongol army won): The text states the fortress was built *to commemorate* a victory *against* the Tibetan Mongol army, implying the Bhutanese won.
* **C: 該景點的受歡迎程度未受影響** (The popularity of the site was not affected):  The text implies the fire significantly damaged the site, making it only *partially* preserved. While it's still a major attraction, the fire *did* have an impact.
* **D: 它由夏仲阿旺朗傑保存** (It was preserved by Shabdrung Ngawang Namgyal):  The text states he *built* the fortress, not that he preserved it afterward.



"
以下關於柬埔寨的陳述，哪個是正確的？,"The correct answer is **D: 泰國人摧毀了金邊**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""泰國人在 18 世紀多次侵略柬埔寨，並在 1772 年摧毀金邊。"" (Thais repeatedly invaded Cambodia in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772.)
* **Option A is incorrect:** The text says the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text states Thailand invaded Cambodia, not the other way around.
* **Option C is not directly supported by the text:** The text mentions Vietnamese invasion in the last years of the 18th century, not the early 18th century.

Therefore, only option D is directly and accurately supported by the provided text.
"
以下哪項陳述正確描述了柬埔寨的入侵？,"The correct answer is **D: 泰國人多次入侵柬埔寨**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""泰國人在 18 世紀多次侵略柬埔寨..."" (The Thais repeatedly invaded Cambodia in the 18th century...) This directly supports option D.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The passage mentions Vietnam invaded in the late 18th century, but doesn't state they invaded *multiple* times.
* **Option B is incorrect:** While both happened, it's not a comprehensive statement of *the* primary description.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The passage states the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772, not the Vietnamese.

Therefore, the most accurate statement based on the provided text is that the Thais repeatedly invaded Cambodia.
"
荷蘭東印度公司在台灣期間沒有做過下列哪件事？,"The correct answer is **D: 願意割讓台灣的控制權給清朝 (Willing to cede control of Taiwan to the Qing dynasty)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest and hired Chinese laborers. It also states that the Qing Dynasty took control through force and declared Taiwan a province.  The passage *doesn't* say the Dutch were willing to give up control. In fact, they actively established their presence and economic interests there. Therefore, the Dutch weren't willing to *cede* control to the Qing; the Qing took it by force.

The other options are all mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: 在島嶼西南部設立基地 (Established a base in the southwest of the island)** - Directly stated in the passage.
*   **B: 實行原住民穀物生產 (Implemented indigenous grain production)** - Directly stated in the passage.
*   **C: 在農園僱用中國工人 (Hired Chinese workers in plantations)** - Directly stated in the passage.



"
《馬關條約》訂立了什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 日本對台灣的管轄權**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1895 年，清朝政府在甲午戰爭（1894-1895 年）戰敗後簽下了《馬關條約》，將臺灣主權割讓給日本。日本從此開始統治臺灣，直到 1945 年為止。""  This directly translates to: ""In 1895, after the Qing government's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. Japan subsequently began to rule Taiwan until 1945.""

Therefore, the Treaty of Shimonoseki granted Japan control over Taiwan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 日本在第一次甲午戰爭中戰勝:** While Japan *did* win the First Sino-Japanese War, the treaty itself is the result of the war's conclusion, not the victory itself.
* **B: 台灣作為清朝省份的地位:** The treaty *reversed* Taiwan's status as a Qing province.
* **C: 台灣能夠重新控制其沿海地區:** The treaty *transferred* control *from* the Qing to Japan.



"
如何測量化學物質的酸鹼度？,"The correct answer is **C: 化學物質中氫離子數量 (Hydrogen ion quantity in a chemical substance)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""酸鹼值 (pH) 是根據化學物質中的氫離子含量而定（pH 的 H 就是指氫）。 氫離子是失去電子後的質子（因為氫原子由一個質子和一個電子組成）"" (pH is determined by the quantity of hydrogen ions in a chemical substance (the H in pH refers to hydrogen). Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron)).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 化學物質的酸鹼度 (The acidity and alkalinity of a chemical substance)** - This is a general description, not a measurement method.
* **B: 化學物質中的質子數量 (The number of protons in a chemical substance)** - While hydrogen ions *are* protons, the passage specifically mentions *hydrogen ions*, not just protons. Also, the passage focuses on the *quantity* of hydrogen ions.
* **D: 化學物質中的電子數量 (The number of electrons in a chemical substance)** -  This is irrelevant to the pH of a substance.
"
什麼東西從氫離子中被去除了？,"The correct answer is **D: 電子**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a hydrogen ion (H+) is a proton *after losing an electron*.  Therefore, the electron is what's removed from the hydrogen atom to form a hydrogen ion.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 質子 (Proton):** A hydrogen ion *is* a proton. It's not what's *removed*.
* **B: 酸鹼值 (pH):**  The pH is a measure *of* the hydrogen ion concentration, not something that's removed.
* **C: 鹼性 (Alkalinity):** Alkalinity is the opposite of acidity and related to hydroxide ions (OH-), not the removal of electrons from hydrogen ions.



"
以下哪項陳述並未正確描述一群獅子？,"The correct answer is **B: 雌雄比例不均 (Female-to-male ratio is uneven)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""獅群裡有一到三隻成年公獅，再加上多達三十隻母獅和幼獅組成。"" (Lion prides consist of one to three adult male lions, plus up to thirty lionesses and cubs.) This indicates a female-dominated social structure.
* **The other options are supported by the text:**
    * **A: 牠們的行為類似於狗群 (Their behavior is similar to dog packs):** The passage directly states this comparison.
    * **C: 雄性和雌性都是近親 (Males and females are all related):** The passage mentions that lionesses are often related to each other (sisters and daughters). While the statement doesn't explicitly state *all* males and females are related, the strong familial bonds within the pride are implied.
    * **D: 它們既致命又具有社交性 (They are both deadly and social):** The passage highlights their hunting prowess (""對牠們的獵物非常狠"") and their social structure (""生活在名為獅群的大團體中"").

Therefore, the only statement that *isn't* accurately described by the passage is that the female-to-male ratio is uneven. In fact, the passage implies the opposite – a higher number of females.
"
以下哪項陳述並未正確描述獅子的行為？,"The correct answer is **D: 牠們的行為類似於其他大型貓科動物 (They behave similarly to other large cats)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""獅群的行為和狼群或狗群非常相像，這兩種動物意外地和獅子 (但不包括其他大型貓科) 相似，而且也對牠們的獵物非常狠。"" (The behavior of lion prides is very similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs. These two animals are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large cats) and are also very ruthless towards their prey.)

* **The passage explicitly says lions *don't* behave like other large cats.** Therefore, option D is the incorrect statement.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct:

* **A: 牠們很會社交 (They are very social):**  The passage states lions live in prides, which are defined as large social groups.
* **B: 牠們的行為與狼差不多 (Their behavior is similar to wolves):** The passage directly compares lion behavior to wolf behavior.
* **C: 雄性和雌性對獵物出手都很致命 (Males and females are ruthless towards prey):** The passage mentions that lions are ruthless towards their prey.



"
兔子是哪種掠食者的常見獵物？,"The correct answer is **B: 大型貓科動物**.

The passage states: ""P: 位於牠們之下的是種類較多的中型貓科動物，主要以兔子、羚羊和鹿等中型獵物為食。"" (P: Below them are a variety of medium-sized cats, which mainly prey on medium-sized prey such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.)

Therefore, rabbits are prey for the medium-sized cats, which are a type of large cat.
"
體型較小的貓科動物通常狩獵以下哪一種動物？,"The correct answer is **A: 齧齒類動物 (Rodents)**.

The passage states: ""最後許多小型貓（偶有家貓）也會捕食為數眾多的小型獵物，包括昆蟲、齧齒類動物、蜥蜴和鳥類。"" This translates to: ""Finally, many small cats (occasionally domestic cats) also prey on a large number of small prey, including insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.""

Of the options provided, rodents are listed as a prey animal for smaller cats.
"
以下哪項不是美洲豹貓狩獵方式的一部分？,"The correct answer is **D: 只狩獵體型較小的動物 (Only hunt animals smaller than themselves)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that jaguar cats *do* hunt animals smaller than themselves (mice, snakes, rodents, and occasionally birds). Option D contradicts this information.
* Options A, B, and C are all described in the text as part of the jaguar cat's hunting methods.



"
以下哪項並未正確描述美洲豹貓？ ,"The correct answer is **C: 牠們的嗅覺很弱 (Their sense of smell is weak)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""科學家認為美洲豹貓憑靠嗅覺跟蹤和尋找獵物，用嗅聞的方式找出獵物出沒的地點。"" (Scientists believe that ocelots rely on their sense of smell to track and find prey, using scent to locate where prey is hiding.) This directly contradicts option C.

Options A, B, and D are all correctly described in the passage.
"
以下哪一項不是老虎最厲害的強項？,"The correct answer is **A: 咆哮 (Roaring)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that while tigers *can* roar, their roar is described as ""a chaotic, shouting sound"" and *not* the full-bodied roar like a lion.
* The text highlights that tigers are strong in climbing, jumping, and pulling strength.

Therefore, roaring is presented as *less* of a strong point for tigers compared to their other abilities.
"
根據文章，老虎和獅子的區別是什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 吼叫的聲音 (Roaring sound)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""老虎的吼嘯不像獅子全然是嗓音的吼嘯，而比較像是一句混亂、喊叫的話語。"" (Tiger's roar is not entirely a vocal roar like a lion's, but rather more like a chaotic shout.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 游泳能力 (Swimming ability):** The passage mentions tigers can swim, but doesn't differentiate them from lions in this regard.
* **C: 跳躍距離 (Jumping distance):** The passage says tigers can do long jumps, but doesn't say anything about a difference from lions.
* **D: 拉力 (Pulling strength):** The passage says tigers have pulling strength, but doesn't say anything about a difference from lions.

Therefore, the only difference mentioned between tigers and lions in the provided text is their roars.
"
根據文章，羅伯·虎克在其他生物學家之前做了什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 使用顯微鏡觀察生物體 (Using a microscope to observe living organisms)**.

The passage states: ""英國生物學家羅伯‧虎克透過顯微鏡觀察到軟木塞中的小方塊..."" This directly indicates that he was the first to use a microscope to observe biological structures.

While he also observed dead cells (A) and small squares (C), the most significant and pioneering action mentioned is using the microscope.  Discovering the smallest functional unit (D) is a broader conclusion that the passage doesn't explicitly state he made.



"
「細胞」一詞的由來是什麼意思？,"The correct answer is **B: 小房間 (Small room)**.

The passage states: ""細胞一詞來自拉丁文的 cella，意指小空間。"" which translates to ""The term cell comes from the Latin word cella, meaning small room.""
"
根據文章，大多數動物有哪種能力？,"The correct answer is **B: 移動 (Movement)**.

The passage states: ""多數動物都能移動"" which translates to ""Most animals can move.""

While the passage mentions animals can also swim, fly, and dig, it states *most* animals can move, and this is the most general statement about a common ability.
"
根據文章，有些動物沒有什麼能力？,"The correct answer is **C: 大腦 (Brain)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""只有動物有大腦（然而甚至不是所有動物都有；例如水母就沒有大腦）"" which translates to ""Only animals have brains (however, not all animals have them; for example, jellyfish don't have brains).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 細胞 (Cells):** The passage states animals are *composed* of many cells, implying they *do* have cells.
* **B: 消化能力 (Digestive ability):** The passage states animals eat and digest food, implying they *do* have this ability.
* **D: 進食能力 (Eating ability):** The passage states animals eat, implying they *do* have this ability.



"
什麼東西可以幫助植物進行光合作用？,"The correct answer is **D: 陽光 (Sunshine)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""植物透過光合作用從陽光中獲取養分。"" This directly translates to ""Plants obtain nutrients from sunlight through photosynthesis.""  Photosynthesis *requires* sunlight to occur.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 遮蔽 (Shade):** Shade would *hinder* photosynthesis.
*   **B: 動物 (Animals):** Animals are dependent on plants, but don't directly help with the process of photosynthesis.
*   **C: 食物 (Food):**  While plants *produce* food, food isn't a direct requirement for photosynthesis – photosynthesis *creates* food (sugars) using sunlight.



"
植物會吸入人類呼出的什麼氣體？,"The correct answer is **D: 二氧化碳 (Carbon Dioxide)**.

The passage states: ""植物製造人類吸入的氧氣，並吸收人類呼出的二氧化碳。"" which translates to ""Plants produce the oxygen that humans inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.""
"
根據文章，下列哪個例子會阻礙進化的過程？,"The correct answer is **A: 小群體無法在新環境中生存 (The small group cannot survive in the new environment)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes how a small, isolated group *needs* to adapt to a new environment to survive and eventually become a new species.** If the small group *cannot* survive, the process of evolution (and speciation) cannot occur.  There's no opportunity for adaptation and divergence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 部分族群移居新環境 (Part of the population migrates to a new environment):** This is the *starting point* of the evolutionary process described.  Isolation and a new environment are key to speciation.
* **C: 族群在新環境中調整其適應能力 (The population adjusts its adaptation in the new environment):**  This *is* the process of evolution.  It's a necessary step.
* **D: 一個族群最終形成兩個族群 (One population eventually forms two populations):** This is the *result* of evolution (speciation). It's not a hindrance to the process itself.

Therefore, the only factor that would directly *halt* evolution in this scenario is the inability to survive in the new environment.



"
下列哪一個敘述並未正確描述物種形成的過程？ ,"The correct answer is **A: 發生於新族群無法適應環境時 (Occurs when a new population cannot adapt to the environment)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a small group *is separated* from the main population because they *need* to adapt to a new environment.  If the new population *couldn't* adapt, they wouldn't survive and wouldn't go on to become a new species.  The entire process of speciation is driven by a population's ability (or inability) to adapt to a *different* environment.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **B: 這是進化過程的一個重要部分 (It is an important part of the process of evolution):** The passage explicitly states, ""種化是演化過程中無法避免的後果，也是很重要的一環。(Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution and an important part of it.)""
*   **C: 它指的是新物種的形成 (It refers to the formation of new species):** The passage clearly defines speciation as ""新物種產生。(the generation of new species.)""
*   **D: 無法避免它的發生 (It is inevitable):** The passage states, ""種化是演化過程中無法避免的後果。(Speciation is an inevitable consequence of evolution.)""



Therefore, option A is the incorrect statement."
循環系統的哪一部分會將血液引向心臟？,"The correct answer is **D: 靜脈 (Veins)**.

The passage states: ""血液從稱為動脈的血管中流出心臟，然後經由稱為靜脈的血管流回心臟。"" (Blood flows out of the heart through vessels called arteries, and then flows back to the heart through vessels called veins.)
"
循環系統中，哪些是最細小的血管？,"The correct answer is **A: 微血管 (Capillaries)**.

The passage states: ""最細小的血管稱為微血管。"" which translates to ""The smallest blood vessels are called capillaries.""
"
昆蟲折疊翅膀的能力會增加以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **B: 躲藏空間 (Hiding space)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""這使牠們有更多可鑽入的小地方來躲避捕食者。"" (This gives them more small places to burrow into to avoid predators.) This directly relates to having more hiding space.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 食物供應 (Food supply):** The passage mentions flight helps find food, but not that folding wings *increases* food supply.
* **C: 尋找伴侶 (Finding mates):** The passage mentions flight helps find mates, but not that folding wings *increases* the ability to find mates.
* **D: 飛行速度 (Flight speed):** The passage doesn't link folding wings to flight speed. In fact, it's implied that folding wings allows for better hiding, not necessarily faster flight.



Therefore, the ability to fold wings directly provides more opportunities for hiding, making **B** the correct answer."
文中沒有提到以下何者為受昆蟲飛行能力影響的事物？,"The correct answer is **B: 壽命 (Lifespan)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that flight helps insects:**
    * ""更輕易地躲開天敵"" (more easily evade predators) - directly related to survival.
    * ""更有效地找到食物和配偶"" (more effectively find food and mates) - directly related to reproduction.
    * ""有更多可鑽入的小地方來躲避捕食者"" (have more small places to hide from predators) - related to survival and potentially indirectly to lifespan.

* **The passage does *not* mention flight impacting lifespan.** While avoiding predators *could* theoretically extend lifespan, the passage doesn't make this connection.

* **A: 繁殖 (Reproduction):** The passage mentions flight helps find mates, which is directly linked to reproduction.
* **C: 採食 (Foraging/Feeding):** The passage mentions flight helps find food.
* **D: 效率 (Efficiency):** The passage states flight allows insects to find food and mates *more effectively*, implying increased efficiency.



Therefore, the only option not mentioned as being affected by flight in the text is lifespan."
以下哪一個特徵通常與恐龍無關？,"The correct answer is **B: 羽毛 (Feathers)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that people *don't* consider birds dinosaurs *because* they have feathers and can fly. The point is that feathers are a defining characteristic that distinguishes birds from *most* dinosaurs. The passage then lists other characteristics that *do* link birds and dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 後腿行走 (Walking on two legs):**  The passage explicitly mentions that some birds, like Tyrannosaurus Rex, walked on two legs.
* **C: 下蛋 (Laying eggs):** Both dinosaurs and birds lay eggs.
* **D: 有爪的腳 (Clawed feet):** The passage mentions that both dinosaurs and birds have clawed feet.



"
下列哪一項通常不被認為是鳥類和恐龍共同特徵？,"The correct answer is **C: 飛行能力 (Flight ability)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that many people *don't* consider birds to be dinosaurs *because* they can fly.  While birds and dinosaurs share other characteristics (scales, claws, laying eggs, bipedal stance), flight is presented as a key difference that leads to the misconception. The passage argues that birds *are* a type of dinosaur, despite their ability to fly, and this ability isn't something *both* dinosaurs and birds *necessarily* share.
"
根據文章，三角龍可能吃蘇鐵屬植物的哪一部分？,"The correct answer is **A: 尖銳的葉子 (Sharp leaves)**.

The passage states: ""三角龍會在食用樹幹之前，用牠強而有力的喙扯下樹葉。"" (Triceratops would use its powerful beak to tear off the leaves before eating the trunk.)
"
根據文章，以下哪一項最有可能成為三角龍的食物？ ,"The best answer is **B: 有堅硬樹枝的植物**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""三角龍的牙齒不僅能咬碎樹葉，甚至連堅硬的樹枝和樹根也能搞定"" (Triceratops' teeth can not only crush leaves but even tackle hard branches and roots).
* While the passage mentions the debate about cycads (蘇鐵屬植物) and their potential toxicity, it also highlights the Triceratops' ability to consume hard materials. 
* The other options are less directly supported. Sloths and parrots are mentioned as *current* animals that eat toxic things, but this doesn't mean Triceratops did the same. Toxic fruit/plants are only mentioned as a potential reason *why* Triceratops might *not* have eaten cycads.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the most likely food source for the Triceratops is plants with hard branches.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項運動在義大利北部地區很可能廣受歡迎？,"The correct answer is **D: F1 賽車 (F1 Racing)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""冬季運動項目在北部地區最受歡迎，這裡的義大利人也會參與相關的國際和奧林匹克賽事."" (Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians in the north also participate in related international and Olympic events.)

F1 racing is a motorsport often associated with winter conditions (think of testing and racing in colder climates), and the text directly links winter sports popularity to the northern regions.  While F1 isn't *exclusively* a winter sport, its connection to the northern regions and the emphasis on winter sports makes it the most likely answer.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **A: 足球 (Football):** While a popular sport in Italy overall, the text doesn't specifically tie it to the northern regions as being *most* popular.
* **B: 排球 (Volleyball):** Similar to football, volleyball is popular in Italy but not specifically mentioned as being most popular in the north.
* **C: 滑板滑雪 (Snowboarding):** This is a winter sport, but it's not explicitly mentioned in the text. F1 racing has a stronger connection to the northern regions based on the provided context.



"
根據文中提供的資訊，以下哪種運動為義大利贏得世界冠軍？,"The correct answer is **A: 足球 (Football)**.

The text states: ""義大利國家足球隊和德國國家足球隊均是世界第二成功的球隊，他們也是 2006 年國際足球總會世界盃的冠軍。""  This directly states that the Italian national football team won the 2006 FIFA Club World Cup.
"
在什麼事件後，盧森堡的某些地區成為了比利時的一部分？,"The correct answer is **B: 比利時革命**.

The passage states: ""現今，比利時的部分地區在過去曾是盧森堡的一部分，但在 1830 年代的比利時革命之後變成比利時。"" (Now, some areas of Belgium were once part of Luxembourg, but became part of Belgium after the Belgian Revolution in the 1830s.)
"
以下哪種因素影響了盧森堡的中立地位？,"The correct answer is **A: 德國佔領**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Luxembourg *tried* to maintain neutrality.
* The passage also explicitly mentions that Luxembourg was occupied by Germany in both World Wars. This occupation directly *challenged* its neutrality.  The pressure from Germany likely influenced and tested Luxembourg's ability to remain neutral.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 加入歐盟 (Joining the EU):** Joining the EU didn't *cause* Luxembourg to try and maintain neutrality. It was a later development.
* **C: 比利時革命 (Belgian Revolution):** The Belgian Revolution led to the loss of territory for Luxembourg, not an influence on its neutrality.
* **D: 成為獨立國家 (Becoming an independent nation):**  Becoming independent was a prerequisite for having a foreign policy, including a neutral stance, but it doesn't directly *influence* the act of maintaining neutrality.

Therefore, the occupation by Germany is the factor most directly related to the *challenge* to Luxembourg's neutrality, and implicitly, a reason why the country was so determined to maintain it.
"
土耳其的總面積有多少平方公里在歐洲？,"The correct answer is **A: 9174 平方公里**.

The text states: ""其中 755,688 平方公里（291,773 平方英里）在亞洲西南部，23,764 平方公里（9,174 平方英里）在歐洲。"" which translates to ""Of which 755,688 square kilometers (291,773 square miles) are in southwestern Asia, and 23,764 square kilometers (9,174 square miles) are in Europe.""
"
根據文章，土耳其大約有多少英里長？,"The correct answer is **A: 1600 英里**

The passage states: ""土耳其的領土長 1,600 多公里（1,000 英里）..."" which translates to ""The territory of Turkey is over 1,600 kilometers (1,000 miles)...""  Therefore, 1600 miles is a correct answer.
"
梵蒂岡城將拉丁語用於什麼用途上？,"The correct answer is **A: 宗教儀式**.

The text states: ""拉丁語則多半在宗教儀式中使用。"" which translates to ""Latin is mostly used in religious ceremonies.""
"
在梵蒂岡城，義大利語不用於哪個用途？,"The correct answer is **C: 宗教儀式**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Latin is primarily used in religious ceremonies in the Vatican. 
* Italian is used for laws, official documents, and everyday communication.



"
根據文章，以下何者為在精密的電腦上進行混音的好處？,"The correct answer is **A: 音樂 (Music)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""音樂錄製的方式，通常是以精密的電腦處理並進行混音。"" (The way music is recorded is usually through precise computer processing and mixing.)

The other options are mentioned as things that can be created *using* computers, but the question asks for the benefit of using computers for *mixing* music.
"
根據文章，以下哪個地點的大多數住宅都有沖水廁所？,"The correct answer is **A: 摩亨佐-達羅城**.

The passage states: ""哈拉帕城和摩亨佐-達羅城的每座房屋裡幾乎都有抽水馬桶..."".  This directly indicates that Mohenjo-daro had flushing toilets in most houses. The other options mention toilets existed there, but the passage doesn't say they were *common* or *almost universal* like in Mohenjo-daro.
"
在以下哪些地點發現了先進的污水處理系統？,"The correct answer is **A: 哈拉帕**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""哈拉帕城和摩亨佐-達羅城的每座房屋裡幾乎都有抽水馬桶，並與一個精密的污水處理系統相連。"" (Harappa and Mohenjo-daro almost every house had a flush toilet and was connected to a sophisticated sewage system.)

While the other locations (聖托里尼, 埃及, 中國) had toilets or drainage systems, the passage specifically highlights Harappa and Mohenjo-daro for having a *sophisticated sewage system*.



"
以下哪個原因會讓滑冰者轉彎？,"The correct answer is **A: 溜冰鞋冰刀底部的輕微弧度**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""由於冰刀底部略有弧度，當冰刀往某側傾斜時，其接觸冰面的邊緣亦呈彎曲。這會使溜冰者轉向。""  (Because the bottom of the ice blade has a slight curve, when the blade tilts to one side, the edge in contact with the ice also bends. This causes the skater to turn.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 溜冰鞋冰刀刀鋒上的雙刃:** While the double blade contributes to grip, the passage focuses on the *curvature* of the blade's bottom as the primary cause of turning.
* **C: 滑冰者整體的技術水平:**  This is a general factor that affects all aspects of skating, but the passage specifically explains the mechanics of turning due to the blade design.
* **D: 冰的品質:** The passage doesn't mention ice quality as a factor in turning.  While ice quality can affect how well you glide, the blade's curvature is what causes the turning mechanism.



"
根據文章，下列何者正確描述了現代溜冰鞋刀片上的凹陷？,"The correct answer is **C: 凹陷 (Indentation)**.

The text explicitly states: ""雙重刀刃即使在傾斜時，也能更有效地抓住冰面。 由於冰刀底部略有弧度，...""  This describes both the double blade and the curvature (弧度). However, the question specifically asks about the ""凹陷"" (indentation). The text mentions a ""凹陷"" *between* the double blades.

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
根據文章，哪個過程可以讓原子消除光的過剩能量？,"The correct answer is **D: 刺激輻射的排放 (Stimulated Radiation Emission)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""若要恢復到之前的能階，它們必須排放從光線中獲得的額外能量。 他們透過發出稱為「光子」的微粒子來完成。 科學家稱此過程為「刺激輻射排放」，因為原子會受到亮光刺激，放射出光子，而光線就是一種輻射。"" (To return to their previous energy level, they must release the excess energy gained from the light. They do this by emitting tiny particles called ""photons."" Scientists call this process ""stimulated radiation emission"" because atoms are stimulated by bright light and emit photons, and light is a form of radiation.)

The passage directly identifies **stimulated radiation emission** as the process by which atoms release excess energy in the form of photons.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 輻射 (Radiation)** - While the process involves radiation, ""radiation"" is too broad a term. The passage specifies *stimulated radiation emission*.
* **B: 刺激光子的排放 (Stimulated photon emission)** - This is part of the process, but not the complete process itself. It's the *emission* of photons *during* stimulated radiation emission.
* **C: 光子 (Photons)** - Photons are the particles emitted, but they are the *result* of the process, not the process itself.



"
是什麼導致原子發出光子？,"The correct answer is **A: 釋放過剩的能量 (Releasing excess energy)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""若要恢復到之前的能階，它們必須排放從光線中獲得的額外能量."" (To return to their previous energy level, they must release the extra energy gained from light.) This directly indicates that excess energy is the cause of photon emission.
* Option B (""明亮光線的刺激"" - Stimulation by bright light) is *part* of the process (it *causes* the excess energy), but not the fundamental cause.  The atom has to *have* extra energy first.
* Option C (""能量水平不穩定"" - Unstable energy levels) is related to *why* the extra energy exists, but not *what* causes the photon emission itself.
* Option D (""輻射不良反應"" - Radiation adverse reaction) is not a scientific term and doesn't relate to the process described.

Therefore, **releasing excess energy** is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text.
"
根據文章，什麼原因最終會讓燈泡壞掉？,"The correct answer is **C: 燈泡裡面的燈絲燒壞了 (The filament inside the light bulb burns out)**.

The passage states: ""在通電數百小時之後，燈泡中的鎢絲最終會燒壞..."" which translates to ""After being powered for hundreds of hours, the filament inside the light bulb will eventually burn out...""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 燈具未正確關閉 (The light fixture is not turned off correctly):** The passage emphasizes the importance of turning off the light fixture, not the consequence of not doing so.
* **B: 燈泡的金屬底部只有部分插進插座 (The metal base of the light bulb is only partially plugged into the socket):**  While this is a safety hazard, it's not the reason the filament burns out.
* **D: 流入插座的電流變慢 (The current flowing into the socket slows down):** The passage doesn't mention the current slowing down as the cause of the bulb burning out.

"
更換燈泡時，以下哪個可能有觸電危險？,"The correct answer is **C: 燈泡的底座 (The light bulb base)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""這是因為如果您在燈泡的金屬底座仍有部份插在插座上時，觸碰到插座內部或其金屬底座，則流入燈泡金屬部份插座的電流，會讓您嚴重觸電。""  (This is because if you touch the inside of the socket or its metal base while the metal base of the light bulb is still partially plugged into the socket, the current flowing into the metal part of the light bulb will cause severe electric shock.)

This directly links the metal base of the bulb *still being plugged in* to the risk of electric shock.  The other options are less directly related to the described hazard:

* **A: 燈絲 (Filament):** The filament itself isn't the primary danger in terms of electrical shock during replacement.
* **B: 電燈開關 (Light switch):** The switch is the control for the power, not the source of the shock hazard during replacement.
* **D: 電線 (Wires):** While wires carry electricity, the danger described is related to the *connection* between the bulb base and the socket.
"
根據文章，當原子核分裂時會發生什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 釋放能量**.

The passage states: ""再次分裂原子核會接著釋出一部份的該能量."" (Further splitting of the atomic nucleus will then release part of that energy.)
"
以下哪個會將長途電話反射回地球,"The correct answer is **B: 衛星 (Satellite)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""打電話給遠在天邊的朋友時，就是透過人造衛星達成的。 太空中的人造衛星接收到訊號，並在瞬間將訊號反射回地球。"" (When calling friends far away, it is done through artificial satellites. Artificial satellites in space receive signals and instantly reflect the signals back to Earth.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 望遠鏡 (Telescope):** Telescopes are used for observing space, not for reflecting signals back to Earth for phone calls.
* **C: 燈光 (Light):** Light is not involved in reflecting phone signals.
* **D: 火箭 (Rocket):** Rockets are used to launch satellites and telescopes into space, but they don't reflect phone signals.



"
其中哪些用於將望遠鏡送入太空？,"The correct answer is **B: 火箭 (Rocket)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""需要超過 100 英尺高的巨型火箭，才能將衛星或望遠鏡放上太空。"" (It takes a giant rocket over 100 feet tall to launch a satellite or telescope into space.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 光束 (Light beam)** - Light beams are used for communication, not for launching objects into space.
*   **C: 地球大氣層 (Earth's atmosphere)** - The atmosphere is what telescopes need to avoid, not something used to launch them.
*   **D: 高於 100 英尺的衛星 (Satellites over 100 feet tall)** - Satellites are launched *using* rockets, they aren't used to launch themselves.



"
要追蹤時間的流逝，應該注意哪些方面的週期性事件？,"The correct answer is **B: 重複 (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""週期性事件指的是定期不斷重複發生的事。"" This translates to ""Periodic events refer to things that regularly and repeatedly occur.""

To track the passage of time, you need to identify events that repeat regularly.  The definition of ""periodic events"" directly relates to the concept of repetition.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 持續時間 (Duration):** Duration is the length of time something lasts, not the event itself.
* **C: 影響 (Impact):** While events can have impacts, the passage is focused on *tracking* time, not the effects of events.
* **D: 困難 (Difficulty):** The difficulty of understanding time isn't a way to track it.



"
根據文章，時間用於比較事件的哪個方面？,"The correct answer is **A: 長度 (Length)**.

The text states: ""時間也是我們比對事件持續期間（長度）的方式。"" which translates to ""Time is also the way we compare the duration (length) of events.""
"
根據文章，以下哪個被視為皇位繼承人典型會做的事？,"The correct answer is **B: 放棄大學以從軍 (Abandon university to join the army)**.

Here's why:

The first sentence of the passage states: ""傳統上，王位繼承人完成學業之後會直接從軍 (Traditionally, heirs to the throne would directly join the army after completing their studies)."" This directly contradicts option B, making it the traditional action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 獲得二等二級學位 (Obtain a 2:2 degree)**: Charles obtained a 2:2 degree, but this is *not* the traditional path.
*   **C: 學習歷史 (Study history)**: Charles studied history, but this is not the defining traditional action.
*   **D: 先上大學再從軍 (Attend university before joining the army)**: Charles went to university, but the tradition was to join the army *after* finishing studies.



Therefore, the traditional action of a royal heir is to abandon university to join the army."
根據文中提供的資訊，查爾斯首先做了什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 就讀三一學院 (Studied at Trinity College)**.

The text explicitly states: ""然而，查爾斯卻去劍橋的三一學院，修習人類學和考古學，後來又修了歷史..."" (However, Charles went to Trinity College, Cambridge, to study anthropology and archaeology, and later history...). This indicates that studying at Trinity College was his first major step.

While he later studied anthropology and archaeology and obtained a degree, the question asks what he *first* did according to the text.
"
奧拉夫特里格維松的艦隊來自哪個國家？,"The correct answer is **D: 挪威**.

The passage explicitly states that Olaf Tryggvason was a ""挪威人"" (Norwegian) who was trying to reclaim his kingdom.
"
在歷史上的哪個時期，德國對愛沙尼亞產生了強烈的文化影響力？,"The text states that the cultural influence of Germany on northern Estonia was around the **15th century**.  Of the options provided, the closest is **D: 大約 800 年前 (Approximately 800 years ago)**.

Here's why:

* 15世紀 is approximately 600 years ago.
*  The options are expressed in terms of ""years ago,"" and 800 is the closest value to 600.  It's slightly off, but the best fit given the choices.

Therefore, the best answer is **D**.
"
愛沙尼亞語受什麼影響？,"The best answer is **B: 德國字母表 (German alphabet)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""它源自於德語字母，並增加了一個 """"Õ/õ"""" 字符。"" (It originated from the German alphabet and added the ""Õ/õ"" character.)

While the other options are related (German culture, German monks, religious motivation), they are *indirect* influences. The direct influence on the *script* was the German alphabet.
"
根據文章，以印地語為母語的人數波動取決於哪個因素？,"The correct answer is **A: 是否算入與印地語非常相似的方言**.

The passage explicitly states: ""持母語者的數量，會根據是否算入近似方言的使用者數量而改變。"" (The number of native speakers varies depending on whether approximate dialect speakers are counted.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 是否算入烏爾都語使用者:** While the passage mentions the similarity between Hindi and Urdu, it's the *native speakers* of Hindi that are being discussed. Urdu speakers are mentioned in relation to understanding Hindi.
* **C: 是否算入能理解該語言的人:** The passage mentions *understanders* (能了解該語言的人) as a separate category from native speakers (持母語者).
* **D: 是否算入能閱讀該語言的人:** The passage doesn't mention reading ability.



"
以下哪項關於印地語和烏爾都語的陳述是正確的？,"The correct answer is **B: 它們在書寫系統上不同 (They have different writing systems)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""印度語和烏爾都語在語彙上非常相像，但書寫起來很不一樣 (Hindi and Urdu are very similar in vocabulary, but are written very differently).""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 兩種語言的使用者通常有隔閡 (Users of the two languages are usually isolated)** - The passage says people can understand each other in everyday conversation, indicating they are *not* isolated.
* **C: 它們在詞彙和書寫系統上相似 (They are similar in vocabulary and writing systems)** - This is the opposite of what the passage states.
* **D: 它們的詞彙不同 (Their vocabulary is different)** -  The passage explicitly states they are ""very similar in vocabulary.""



"
關於韓文字母，以下事實何者不正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 這個字母表最初的名字是湖南正音 (This alphabet's original name was Hunan Jingyin)**.

Here's why:

* **The provided text states:** ""他最初將韓文字母命名為「訓民正音」，意思是「教導人民的正確聲音」 (He initially named the Korean alphabet ""Hunminjeongeum,"" meaning ""the correct way to teach the people the sounds"").
* **""Hunan Jingyin"" (湖南正音)** is not the original name of the Korean alphabet.  It's a different term and not associated with the creation of Hangul.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: 是在世宗統治初期發明的 (It was invented in the early reign of Sejong)** - The text explicitly states it was invented between 1418-1450, during Sejong the Great's reign.
* **C: 是由朝鮮王朝的第四代國王發明的 (It was invented by the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty)** - Sejong the Great was the fourth king of the Joseon Dynasty.
* **D: 是特意發明的 (It was intentionally invented)** - The text highlights that it was specifically created to be a system for teaching people to read.



Therefore, the incorrect statement is B.



"
訓民正音字母表最終改名為什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 諺文 (Hangeul)**.

The passage states: ""他最初將韓文字母命名為「訓民正音」，意思是「教導人民的正確聲音」。 **諺文**是唯一一個在日常使用中特意發明的字母...""  This indicates that Hangeul (諺文) is the name the alphabet eventually took. While ""訓民正音"" was the original name, ""諺文"" became the common term.
"
根據文章，哪些語言受到了梵語的影響？,"The correct answer is **D: 印度語言**.

The passage explicitly states: ""梵語是一種非常複雜又豐富的語言，也是印度許多種現代語言的來源，好比拉丁語也是法語和西班牙語等歐洲語言之源頭一樣。"" (Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language and is also the source of many modern Indian languages, just as Latin is the source of French and Spanish and other European languages.)

While Latin is mentioned as a source of European languages, the question asks which languages were *influenced* by Sanskrit. The passage directly says Sanskrit is the source of *modern Indian languages*.
"
根據文章，梵文使用的減少是由於什麼原因？,"The correct answer is **D: 階級制度 (Caste system)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""在完成奧義書後，梵文因階級制度而逐漸消亡。"" which translates to ""After the completion of the Upanishads, Sanskrit gradually declined due to the caste system.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 複雜性 (Complexity)** - The passage says Sanskrit is complex *and* rich, but doesn't link its decline to complexity.
* **B: 雅利安人遷徙 (Aryan migration)** - The passage mentions the theory of Aryan migration, but doesn't say it's the *reason* for Sanskrit's decline.
* **C: 拉丁語言 (Latin language)** - The passage compares Sanskrit to Latin in terms of historical significance and influence, but doesn't say Latin caused Sanskrit's decline.



"
根據文章，關於艾奧的重力，以下哪一項陳述是正確的？,"The correct answer is **D: 地球的重力對你的影響比艾奧的重力大 (Earth's gravity affects you more than Io's gravity.)**

Here's why:

* The passage states that a 200-pound person on Earth weighs 36 pounds on Io. This implies that the gravitational pull on Io is significantly weaker than the gravitational pull on Earth.
* Therefore, the Earth's gravity has a greater effect on the person's weight than Io's gravity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 地球的重力對你的影響比艾奧的重力小 (Earth's gravity affects you less than Io's gravity.)** - This is the opposite of what the passage says.
* **B: 艾奧的重力拉得更多，你就會因此更輕 (Io's gravity pulls more, and you would therefore be lighter.)** - This is incorrect. Weaker gravity means you would be lighter, not heavier.
* **C: 艾奧的重力拉得更多，你就會因此更重 (Io's gravity pulls more, and you would therefore be heavier.)** - This is the opposite of what the passage says. Weaker gravity means you would be lighter, not heavier.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項陳述正確描述了月球的外層？,"The correct answer is **A: 近側有更厚的地殼**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""地殼在近端厚約七十公里，在遠端厚約一百公里。"" (The crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the near side and about 100 kilometers thick on the far side.)
* This directly supports option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 高原下的地殼更薄:** The passage says the crust is *thicker* under the highlands.
* **C: 遠側的月海可能較少:** The passage suggests more maria are on the near side *because* the crust is thinner there.
* **D: 高原下的月海可能較少:**  Since the passage suggests more maria on the near side due to a thinner crust, this option is incorrect.

Therefore, only option A is a correct description based on the provided text.
"
根據文章，月球地殼最厚的地方在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **C: 在高地下 (In the highlands)**.

The passage states: ""它在月海下較薄，在高原下則較厚。"" which translates to ""It is thinner under the maria and thicker under the highlands.""
"
根據文章，有些人相信以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **C: 生命存在於其他星球上 (Life exists on other planets)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""有些則相信外星人或其他形式的生命可能存在於另一顆星球之上。(Some believe that aliens or other forms of life may exist on another planet.)""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 人類已經到過其他星球 (Humans have already been to other planets)** - The passage talks about the *dream* of reaching other planets, not about past achievements.
* **B: 人類無法探索其他世界 (Humans cannot explore other worlds)** - The passage discusses the *challenges* of exploring other worlds due to vast distances, but doesn't say it's impossible.
* **D: 恆星之間的距離少於數兆英里 (The distance between stars is less than trillions of miles)** - The passage states the distance between even the closest celestial bodies is *兆 (trillions)* of miles, not less.



"
越是遠離太陽中心，以下哪一項變得越薄？,"The correct answer is **C: 氣體 (Gas)**.

The passage states: ""離太陽中心越遠，氣體就越稀薄。"" which translates to ""The further away from the center of the sun, the thinner the gas becomes.""
"
根據文章，太陽的哪一部分可以從地球上看到？,"The correct answer is **C: 光球 (Photosphere)**.

The passage states: ""我們看見的太陽外層稱為「photosphere」，意即「光球」"" which translates to ""The outermost layer of the sun that we can see is called the 'photosphere', meaning 'light sphere'.""  Therefore, the photosphere is the part of the sun visible from Earth.
"
以下哪一項觀察證實了哥白尼的理論？,"The correct answer is **A: 金星的圓缺變化 (The phases of Venus)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""金星盈虧證實了哥白尼的理論──行星繞著太陽旋轉。"" (The phases of Venus confirmed Copernicus' theory - that planets revolve around the sun.)
* **Venus's phases are a direct consequence of its orbit around the sun.**  The phases (like the moon) happen because we see different amounts of the sunlit side of Venus as it orbits.  This wouldn't be possible if Venus orbited the Earth.
* **Venus transits (crossing the Sun) is also important but isn't directly linked to *proving* the heliocentric model in the same way the phases are.**  While Venus transits provide further evidence for a heliocentric model, the phases are the more direct and earlier confirmation.

Therefore, the passage directly connects the phases of Venus to the confirmation of Copernicus' theory.
"
1610 年，伽利略·伽利萊觀察到了以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **B: 金星的圓缺變化 (Phases of Venus)**.

The passage states: ""大約三千年後，1610 年義大利天文學家伽利略·伽利萊使用望遠鏡觀察到金星和月亮一樣有圓缺變化。"" (About three thousand years later, in 1610, Italian astronomer Galileo Galilei observed that Venus, like the Moon, had phases.) This directly supports option B.

While the passage also mentions the implications of this observation (confirming Copernicus's theory), the question asks specifically what Galileo observed in 1610.
"
根據文章，亞馬遜河從哪裡匯集水？,"The correct answer is **A: 較小的河流 (Smaller rivers)**.

The passage states: ""亞馬遜河主流長 6,387 公里（3,980 英里），匯集了來自數千條小型河流的河水。"" which translates to ""The Amazon River's main stream is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long, **gathering water from thousands of smaller rivers**.""
"
何者並非亞馬遜河造就的榮譽？,"The correct answer is **C: 它是最長的河流 (It is the longest river)**.

The passage states the Amazon is the *second longest* river. Options A, B, and D are all mentioned as things the Amazon is known for.
"
文章提到的哪個行業別雇用的委內瑞拉人最少？,"The answer is **C: 石油業 (Oil industry)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that only **1%** of the Venezuelan population works in the oil industry.
* The other sectors have larger percentages: 3/2 (or 1.5) for services, nearly 1/4 (or 25%) for industry, and 1/5 (or 20%) for agriculture.

Therefore, the oil industry employs the fewest Venezuelans according to the information provided."
根據文章，以下哪個行業雇用的委內瑞拉人最多？,"The correct answer is **A: 服務業 (Service Industry)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""三分之二的委內瑞拉工作人口從事服務業"" which translates to ""Two-thirds of Venezuela's working population are employed in the service industry."" This is a larger percentage than those employed in agriculture (1/5) or industry (nearly one-fourth).  While oil is important, it only employs 1% of the population.
"
根據文章，融合可以讓恆星做什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 散發光和熱**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""星星會發出光和熱，這是因為氫原子會在融合形成質量更重的元素時產生能量。"" (Stars emit light and heat because hydrogen atoms produce energy when they fuse to form heavier elements.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 形成更重的元素** - While fusion *does* create heavier elements, the passage focuses on the *result* of that process (energy production) rather than the creation of heavier elements itself.
* **B: 建造融合反應器** - This is what scientists are *trying* to do, but the passage emphasizes the difficulty and the time it will take. It doesn't describe what fusion *can* do directly.
* **D: 創造氫原子** - Fusion *uses* hydrogen atoms, it doesn't create them.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**."
一個有用的融合反應器會創造以下哪一項？,"The correct answer is **D: 能量 (Energy)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that stars produce light and heat *because* of nuclear fusion, which releases energy. 
* Scientists are trying to create fusion reactors to generate energy.
* Fusion *creates* energy, it doesn't create hydrogen, stars, or simply atoms.

Therefore, a useful fusion reactor would primarily create energy.
"
水的化學成份是什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 兩個氫原子和一個氧原子**.

The passage states: ""水是由兩個氫原子和一個氧原子組成的。"" which translates to ""Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""
"
當水改變形態時，什麼東西會保持不變？,"The correct answer is **A: 分子結構 (Molecular structure)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""水是由兩個氫原子和一個氧原子組成的。 不論是氣體、液體或固體型態，都有相同的分子結構。"" (Water is composed of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. Regardless of whether it is in a gaseous, liquid, or solid state, it has the same molecular structure.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 密度 (Density):** The passage mentions that liquid nitrogen has a higher density than gaseous nitrogen.
* **C: 物理狀態 (Physical state):** The passage explains that water *changes* physical state (gas, liquid, solid).
* **D: 液態氮 (Liquid nitrogen):** Liquid nitrogen is only used as an example and isn't what remains the same during water's phase changes.



"
根據文章，以下哪一項不是十三個州試圖實施某些法律時的問題？,"The correct answer is **A: 國家當局的嚴格監督 (Strict oversight by the national authority)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Continental Congress (the only body under the Articles of Confederation) lacked the power to tax, enforce laws, or effectively manage the country.  This means the national authority *did not* have strict oversight.  In fact, the opposite is true; the lack of power meant there was a lack of oversight.

Let's look at why the other options *are* problems mentioned in the text:

* **B: 國會內部缺乏權力 (Lack of power within the Congress):** The passage clearly states that the Congress had limited power – no power to tax, no national administration, etc.
* **C: 要求一致同意的修正案 (Requirement of unanimous consent for amendments):**  The text explicitly mentions this as a major problem, making it difficult to adapt the Articles of Confederation.
* **D: 一個不存在的國家行政部門 (Non-existent national executive branch):** The passage says there was no national executive branch, meaning there was no national authority to enforce laws.



Therefore, the only option that *isn't* a problem identified in the passage is strict oversight by the national authority.
"
根據文章，以下哪一種陳述正確反映了中央政府在獨立戰爭期間的狀態？,"The correct answer is **C: 州代表缺席**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""他們的代表時常缺席。"" (Their representatives often absented themselves.)  This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 稅收是由國會和州當局執行的:** The passage states the Congress *could not* levy taxes. So, A is incorrect.
* **B: 依賴國會的權威來修正章程:** The passage says the Articles required *unanimous* consent from *all* states to amend.  It doesn't say they relied on the Congress's authority to do so.
* **D: 中央政府由兩個主要組成部分構成:** The passage only mentions the Congress as the sole body. It doesn't mention any other components of the central government.



Therefore, **C** is the only option directly supported by the information in the passage."
獨立宣言背面的文字是如何寫的？,"The correct answer is **C: 上下顛倒 (Upside down)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""文字是以上下顛倒方式寫在底部。"" which translates to ""The text is written upside down at the bottom.""
"
新加坡因以下哪個方面聞名？,"The correct answer is **A: 城市綠化 (Urban greening)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""在國家獨立的初期，新加坡植物園的專業知識協助將此島嶼轉變成一個熱帶花園城市。"" (In the early years of nationhood, the expertise of the Singapore Botanic Gardens helped transform this island into a garden city.) This directly links Singapore to its urban greening efforts.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""1981 年，一種蘭花雜交種「卓錦萬代蘭」被獲選為該國國花。"" (In 1981, an orchid hybrid called ""Vanda Miss Joaquim"" was chosen as the country's national flower.)  Orchids are a key component of Singapore's urban greening and botanical identity.

While Singapore might have other attractions, the passage focuses specifically on its development as a ""garden city,"" making urban greening the most relevant answer. The other options are not mentioned or implied in the provided text.
"
什麼是卓錦萬代蘭？,"The correct answer is **B: 一種花卉 (A kind of flower)**.

The passage states that ""卓錦萬代蘭"" (Dok Chim Wan Dai Orchid) is a hybrid orchid that was chosen as Singapore's national flower. Therefore, it is a type of flower.
"
根據文章，吉薩金字塔的哪個特質可能不會讓新王國時期的埃及人感到驚奇？,"The correct answer is **B: 使用石材 (Using stone)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the pyramids were built continuously from the Early Dynastic Period through the late Old Kingdom.**  This means that by the time of the New Kingdom, the Egyptians *already knew* how to build with stone for monumental structures. 
* The passage emphasizes the *scale* and *technique* of the Giza pyramids as being unparalleled.  The sheer size and the advanced methods used were likely surprising to those in the New Kingdom.
* The age of the pyramids (over a thousand years old) would be a testament to the ingenuity of their ancestors.
*  The question asks what *wouldn't* surprise them. Since using stone was a known practice by the New Kingdom, it wouldn't be a novel or surprising element of the Giza pyramids.



Therefore, the statement that the Giza pyramids used stone wouldn't be surprising to the New Kingdom Egyptians.
"
根據文章，草食動物在追求雨水時從哪裡出發？,"The correct answer is **B: 北邊山丘**.

The text states: ""每年十月左右，都有將近 150 萬隻草食動物為了雨水，會從**北邊的山丘**跨越馬拉河，遷移至南方的平原."" (Every year around October, nearly 1.5 million grazing animals will cross the Mara River from the **northern hills** in search of rain, migrating to the southern plains.)
"
根據文章，食草動物在四月左右的某個時候離開哪個區域？,"The correct answer is **A: 塞倫蓋蒂區域**.

The passage states: ""每年十月左右，都有將近 150 萬隻草食動物為了雨水，會從北邊的山丘跨越馬拉河，遷移至南方的平原。 四月左右的雨季後，牠們再次跨過馬拉河，然後經由西部回到北方。"" This indicates they are leaving the Serengeti region in April after the rains.
"
海獅計畫入侵了哪個國家？,"The correct answer is **B: 英國**.

The passage explicitly states that after the war against France, Germany began preparing to invade the British Isles, and this plan was codenamed ""Operation Sea Lion.""
"
德國把對英國的攻擊稱為什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 海獅計畫 (Operation Sea Lion)**.

The question states: ""德國給那次攻擊取了「海獅計畫」的代號。"" which translates to ""Germany gave that attack the code name 'Operation Sea Lion'.""
"
哪一項不是義大利佔領非洲國家計劃中的必要步驟？,"The correct answer is **B: 建造額外的船隻 (Building additional ships)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""為了攻佔那些國家，他們需有軍隊可用的跳板，使軍隊能夠渡過地中海並侵略非洲。 **為此，他們必須除掉英國在埃及的基地和船隻，除了這些行動之外，義大利戰艦不該涉及其他事情。**""

This means the primary focus is on establishing a beachhead and removing the British naval threat in Egypt. Building more ships is *not* mentioned as a necessary step in their plan. They only recently built four new ships, implying that's sufficient for their limited role.  The other options (removing ships in Egypt and establishing a beachhead) are explicitly stated as essential. Destroying the British base falls under the broader objective of removing their naval power.
"
根據文章，義大利戰爭的主要目標是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 佔領非洲國家 (To occupy African countries)**.

The text explicitly states: ""義大利的主要目標是非洲國家。為了攻佔那些國家，他們需有軍隊可用的跳板，使軍隊能夠渡過地中海並侵略非洲。"" (Italy's main goal is African countries. In order to occupy those countries, they need army jump-off points that will allow their troops to cross the Mediterranean and invade Africa.)

While eliminating British bases in Egypt is a *means* to achieve their goal, the ultimate objective is to conquer Africa. The other options are incorrect because the text says Italy's army and navy are weak and they don't aim to build stronger militaries or British bases.
"
誰與入侵者建立友好關係？,"The correct answer is **B: 維希法國 (Vichy France)**.

The passage states: ""這些法國人在 1940 年與德國人和睦相處，並與侵略者合作而非對抗。"" (These French people got along with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the aggressors instead of resisting.)  This directly identifies the Vichy regime as the entity that formed an alliance with the invaders.
"
哪些盟軍參與了龍騎兵行動？,"The correct answer is **A: 美國和自由法國 (United States and Free France)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""當盟國進攻法國南部，史稱「龍騎兵行動」。在短短兩週內，美軍和自由法國軍就解放了南法..."" (When the Allies attacked southern France, known as Operation龍騎兵, the US Army and Free French Army liberated the South in just two weeks...).
"
哪項技術的發展導致潛水艇開始潛入水中行駛？,"The correct answer is **D: 雷達 (Radar)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""隨著雷達的研發開始和變得越來越精確後，潛水艇被迫潛入水中以避免被看見。"" (As radar was developed and became more accurate, submarines were forced to dive to avoid being seen.)

Therefore, the development of radar was the technology that *caused* submarines to start diving more frequently.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U 艇 (U-boats)** - U-boats were the German submarines, not the technology that *forced* them to dive.
*   **B: 射擊範圍 (Shooting range)** - Shooting range is irrelevant to a submarine's need to avoid detection.
*   **C: 駕駛 (Driving/Steering)** -  Skillful driving allowed submarines to operate effectively, but didn't change their need to avoid radar.



"
在最初的使用中，潛艇在哪個區域的航程有限？,"The correct answer is **B: 移動 (Movement)**.

The passage states: ""當時潛水艇移動得很慢，而且射程極有限。"" which translates to ""At that time, submarines moved very slowly and had extremely limited range."" This directly indicates that the range of their *movement* was limited.
"
根據文章，是誰違反了協議？ ,"The correct answer is **D: 蘇聯人 (Soviets)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""超過 80 萬名蘇聯紅軍違反《里加和約》、《波蘇互不侵犯協定》和其它雙邊與多邊的國際協定入侵波蘭東部..."" This directly identifies the Soviet Red Army as the party that violated the agreements.
"
以下哪項不是由紅軍執行的？,"The correct answer is **C: 在橋頭堡進行重組 (Reorganizing at the bridgehead)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the plan was to retreat and *reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead*.  The question asks which action was *not* performed by the Red Army.
* The passage explicitly states the Red Army *invaded* eastern Poland, Belarus, and Ukraine. (B) and (A) are therefore correct.
* The passage states the Red Army *violated* treaties. (D) is correct.
* The passage mentions the plan was to *reorganize* *at* the bridgehead, implying they *didn't* succeed in doing so.  Therefore, the Red Army did *not* reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead. (C) is the correct answer.



Therefore, the answer is **C**."
義大利第十軍團的工兵總隊長發生了什麼事？,"The correct answer is **C: 他被英國人俘虜了 (He was captured by the British)**.

The passage states: ""在巴第亞東部的一次伏擊中，英軍俘虜了義大利第十軍團的工兵總隊長拉斯圖奇將軍。(In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured General Rastuti, chief of engineers of the Italian 10th Army.)""
"
義大利空軍元帥伊塔洛·巴爾博在哪裡被殺？,"The correct answer is **D: 圖卜魯格 (Tripoli)**.

The text states: ""6 月 28 日，利比亞總督—明顯是墨索里尼 (Mussolini) 的繼承者伊塔洛·巴爾博 (Italo Balbo) 元帥，在登陸圖卜魯格時被友軍炮火炸死。"" This translates to ""On June 28th, the Governor of Libya - clearly Mussolini's successor Marshal Italo Balbo - was killed by friendly fire upon landing in Tripoli.""
"
根據文章，以下哪種技巧是西藏冥想的重要部分？,"The correct answer is **C: 觀想觀想神佛 (Visualization of deities)**.

The passage states: ""藏傳佛教的冥想核心是本尊瑜伽。透過觀想神佛，淨化所有的能量通道，啟動脈輪，建立開悟意識。"" (The core of Tibetan Buddhist meditation is Deity Yoga. Through visualizing deities, it purifies all energy channels, activates the chakras, and establishes enlightened consciousness.)

While options A, B, and D are mentioned as parts of Kundalini Yoga, they are not specifically highlighted as the *core* of Tibetan Buddhist meditation in the passage.  Visualization of deities is directly identified as the core practice.
"
根據文章，脈輪在西藏冥想「核心」期間是如何被啟動的？,"The correct answer is **B: 透過觀想神佛**.

The passage states: ""藏傳佛教的冥想核心是本尊瑜伽。透過觀想神佛，淨化所有的能量通道，啟動脈輪，建立開悟意識。"" This directly links visualizing deities (觀想神佛) to activating the chakras (脈輪).

While other options are mentioned as ways to awaken Kundalini energy (which is related but not the core of Tibetan meditation), they are not specifically linked to the activation of chakras within the context of the Tibetan meditation ""core.""
"
在節目中，誰獻上了第二首拜讚歌？,"The correct answer is **D: 傑·香卡·喬杜理**.

The text states: ""歌手桑傑‧夏滿揭開了晚場的序幕，隨後登場的是傑‧香卡‧喬杜理。"" (Singer Sanjay Shaman opened the evening, followed by Jagjit Singh Chaduri.)  This indicates Jagjit Singh Chaduri performed the second devotional song.
"
根據文章，誰在供奉食品時演唱了一首拜讚歌？,"The correct answer is **A: 拉卡·辛 (Lakshmikant Singh)**.

The passage states: ""然後由拉卡．辛領銜帶唱拜讚歌。108 盤夏潘柏格（在印度教中，供奉神靈的 56 種不同的食品，例如糖果、水果、堅果、菜餚等）被供奉給了巴巴夏母。拉克辛也獻上 56 饗聖歌。"" This translates to: ""Then Lakshmikant Singh led the devotional song. 108 plates of Chhappan Bhog (56 different foods offered to the deity in Hinduism, such as sweets, fruits, nuts, dishes, etc.) were offered to Baba Saheb. Lakshmikant also offered the 56 Bhog songs.""
"
晚上的倒數第二場表演是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 蘇珊·雅克蘇、亞歷山大·沙費納和哈麗絲·亞力克西烏**.

The text states: ""土耳其天后蘇珊‧雅克蘇與義大利男高音亞歷山大‧沙費納和希臘歌手哈麗絲‧亞力克西烏同臺演出."" This is the second to last performance listed.
"
亞歷山大·沙費納是什麼國籍？,"The correct answer is **D: 義大利**.

The text states that Alexander Schaffer is an ""義大利男高音"" which translates to ""Italian baritone"".
"
根據文章，以下哪個敘述不正確？,"The correct answer is **A: 聖塔克拉拉發生火災 (Santa Clara experienced a fire)**.

Here's why:

* **The article mentions extreme heat, not a fire.** The quote explicitly states the temperature was ""90s Fahrenheit"" and describes it as ""very hot."" There's no mention of a fire.
* **B: 人們被困在雲霄飛車上 (People were trapped on a roller coaster):** The article clearly states this.
* **C: 有提供水給乘客喝 (Water was provided to the passengers):** The article says passengers were able to ""replenish fluids.""
* **D: 至少要 60 分鐘，才能讓第一個人下車 (At least 60 minutes were required to get the first person off the roller coaster):** The article states ""at least an hour"" was needed.

Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that a fire occurred.
"
根據文章，誰對於不舒適的熱度發表評論？,"The correct answer is **B: 消防隊長**.

The passage states: ""消防隊長史考特·考恩斯說：「那天聖塔克拉拉非常炎熱，氣溫為華氏 90 幾度。」"" (Fire Chief Scott Cousins said: ""It was very hot in Santa Clara that day, with temperatures in the 90s."") This directly attributes the comment about the uncomfortable heat to the Fire Chief.
"
哪裡因海嘯活動而停電？,"The correct answer is **A: 東加 (Tonga)**.

The passage states: ""東加並未回報任何重大損壞或傷亡，但據稱暫時的電力中斷妨礙了東加相關單位接收太平洋海嘯警報中心 (PTWC) 發出之海嘯警報."" This directly indicates that power outages affected Tonga.

While the other options mention locations affected by the tsunami, only Tonga is specifically linked to power outages in the text.
"
根據文章，東加因停電受到了什麼影響？,"The correct answer is **D: 當局無法收到相關警報 (The authorities were unable to receive relevant alerts)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""東加並未回報任何重大損壞或傷亡，但據稱暫時的電力中斷妨礙了東加相關單位接收太平洋海嘯警報中心 (PTWC) 發出之海嘯警報."" (Tonga has not reported any major damage or casualties, but temporary power outages reportedly hindered Tonga authorities from receiving tsunami alerts issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC).)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 有一些損害報告 (Some damage reports):** The passage states Tonga hasn't reported *major* damage.
* **B: 當局沒有收到解除警報的消息 (The authorities did not receive the news of the alert being lifted):** The passage doesn't say they didn't receive *any* alerts, just that they had trouble receiving the tsunami alerts initially.
* **C: 海平面讀數受到影響 (Sea level readings were affected):** The passage states sea level readings *showed* a tsunami occurred, not that they were affected.



"
警方何時能使用雷達槍測量強尼瑞德的駕駛速度？,"The correct answer is **A: 他以 160 公里/小時的速度行駛時 (When he was traveling at 160 km/h)**.

The text explicitly states that the police were only able to use the radar gun *after* he slowed down to 160 km/h.  They couldn't use it previously because the car was too low.
"
根據文章，為什麼紐西蘭警方很難測量強尼瑞德的速度？,"The correct answer is **B: 車子的高度非常低 (The car is very low)**.

The article explicitly states: ""因為黑美人車身太低，紐西蘭警方未能使用測速槍測得瑞德的車速..."" which translates to ""Because the Black Beauty car body is too low, New Zealand police were unable to use a speed gun to measure Reid's speed...""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他的行駛速度低於 160 公里/小時 (His driving speed was lower than 160 km/h)** - The article states he exceeded 160 km/h.
* **C: 他只開車過橋七次 (He only drove over the bridge seven times)** - The number of crossings isn't the reason for the difficulty in measuring his speed.
* **D: 奧克蘭海灣大橋非常老舊 (The Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old)** - The bridge's age is not mentioned in the article.
"
與比尤特相關的地震集中在哪裡？,"The correct answer is **B: 向南 40 英里** (South 40 miles).

The text states: ""震央位於狄龍北北東方約 20 公里（15 英里），比尤特南方約 65 公里（40 英里）"" which translates to ""The epicenter is about 20 kilometers (15 miles) northeast of Dillon, and about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of B (_.presumably Butte_)"".
"
在阿布格萊布監獄的暴亂期間發生了什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 監獄火災**.

The first sentence of the prompt states that the Abu Ghraib prison was ""惨遭祝融"" (burnt to the ground). While the prison was notorious for abuse and the US military takeover is mentioned, the question specifically asks what *happened during the riot*. The prompt directly states the prison caught fire *during the riot*.
"
伊拉克監獄為何聲名狼藉？ ,"The best answer is **D: 揭發了虐待囚犯的行為 (Abuse of prisoners was exposed)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states the prison was notorious *because* of abuse.** While the fire (A) and the US takeover (B) are events that happened, they are *related to* the abuse, not the core reason for the notoriety.  暴亂 (C) is a consequence of the abuse, not the primary reason for the prison's bad reputation.

* **Option D directly addresses the reason given in the prompt:** ""此監獄因美軍接手後爆發的虐囚事件而惡名昭彰 (This prison was notorious because of the abuse of prisoners that erupted after the US takeover).""

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and comprehensive answer.
"
在茂宜島的戰爭紀念館體育場將舉行哪種活動？,"The correct answer is **C: 音樂會 (Concert)**.

The passage explicitly states that a band's performance was canceled at the Maui War Memorial Stadium. A performance by a band is a concert.
"
誰最終對活動取消做出了解釋？,"The correct answer is **B: 管理公司**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that HK Management Inc. (the management company) initially canceled the event and later provided the reason for the cancellation.
* While the band is ultimately responsible for their actions, the management company is the one *explaining* the reason for the cancellation.

Therefore, the management company is the one who ultimately provided the explanation.
"
比什凱克的幾位居民認為誰應對搶劫負責？,"The correct answer is **A: 執法員警 (Law enforcement officers)**.

The first sentence of the prompt states: ""由於比什凱克的街道上並沒有出現執法員警，根據報告，大規模的搶劫活動一整晚都在持續發生。"" (Because there were no law enforcement officers on the streets of Bishkek, reports indicate large-scale robberies continued all night.)

This directly indicates that residents believe the lack of police presence is the problem and that law enforcement is responsible for addressing the robberies. While some residents blame protesters, the core issue they seem to be pointing to is the absence of police.
"
誰將搶劫的責任歸咎於南方的抗議人士？,"The correct answer is **A: 比什凱克居民**.

The text states: ""幾名比斯凱克居民譴責來自南方的抗議人士違法亂紀。"" which translates to ""Several Bishkek residents condemned protesters from the South for lawlessness.""
"
鈴響公司何時經歷了銷售成長？,"The correct answer is **A: 在《創業鯊魚幫》節目上露面後 (After appearing on Shark Tank)**.

The text explicitly states: ""西米諾夫表示當他 2013 年在《創業鯊魚幫》節目上露面後，銷售額提高了..."" (Siminov said that his sales increased after he appeared on the Shark Tank show in 2013...).

While the other options are related events in Ring's history, the text directly links the sales increase to the Shark Tank appearance.
"
傑米·西米諾夫何時決定創辦鈴響公司的？,"The correct answer is **A: 在意識到自己的門鈴不適用後 (After realizing his own doorbell wasn't working)**.

The text states: ""P: 在此之前，鈴響公司的執行長傑米·西米諾夫曾說過他之所以創立該公司，是因為他在自家車庫改裝的店面聽不到前門的按鈴聲。 他說他做了一個無線網路門鈴。""  This directly indicates his motivation stemmed from a personal problem with his own doorbell.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B:** His appearance on ""Shark Tank"" *increased* sales after the initial founding, not *after* a rejection.
* **C:** He didn't get funding before founding the company; he founded it *because* of a problem.
* **D:**  His appearance on QVC happened *after* the company was already established.



"
每一集《彩虹閱讀》都為孩子們提供了什麼建議？,"The correct answer is **B: 當地圖書館 (Local Libraries)**.

The passage states: ""每集節目也將為孩子們去圖書館時應該找的書提供建議。"" which translates to ""Each episode will also provide suggestions for books children should look for when they go to the library.""
"
是什麼導致《彩虹閱讀》系列節目的停播？,"The correct answer is **A: 資金不足 (Financial difficulties)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""來自水牛城 WNED 電台（閱讀彩虹的母台）的約翰·格蘭特表示，「閱讀彩虹教導孩子們為何要閱讀，......熱愛閱讀。[該節目]鼓勵孩子們拿起書本開始閱讀。」 包括約翰葛蘭特在內的一些人認為，**財政困難及電視教育節目理念的改變，促使此系列畫下句點。**""

While the other options are mentioned, they are not the primary reason for the show's cancellation.  The passage directly links the cancellation to financial difficulties.



"
以下哪一項不是阿姆斯特丹和博物館官員對樹的爭辯之一？,"The correct answer is **B: 應該保存下來 (Should be preserved)**.

The passage states the government and Anne Frank House officials argued the tree was a danger to public health due to fungal infection and likely to fall.  This directly contradicts the idea that they believed it *should be preserved*. Options A, C, and D are all explicitly stated as reasons for the concern.
"
根據英國皇家防止虐待動物協會的首席檢查員的說法，以下何者需要進行標準檢查？,"The correct answer is **D: 屠宰場**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""RSPCA 新南威爾斯州首席檢查員大衛‧歐山納西向 ABC 表示，澳洲應普遍執行對**屠宰場**的監控和與檢查。""  (RSPCA NSW Chief Inspector David O'Connor told ABC that Australia should universally implement monitoring and inspections of **slaughterhouses**.)

The question asks what needs to be inspected. The answer is the slaughterhouses. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the passage doesn't state that closed-circuit cameras, any workers, or monitoring facilities need to be inspected.  The focus is on inspecting the slaughterhouses themselves.
"
根據文章，什麼可以幫助加強澳洲屠宰場工人對動物福利的重視？,"The correct answer is **A: 安裝閉路電視攝影機 (Installing CCTV cameras)**.

The article explicitly states that animal liberation groups and the RSPCA are *calling for* the mandatory installation of CCTV cameras in all Australian slaughterhouses. The quote from David O'Connor directly links the cameras to conveying a strong message about animal welfare being a priority.

While options B and C are related to animal welfare, the article focuses on CCTV cameras as the key solution being proposed and advocated for. Option D, ABC's supervision, is not mentioned in the text.
"
根據文章，被捕的人從事什麼職業？,"The correct answer is **A: 學生 (Student)**.

The article states: ""因此傑夫·魏斯與九名受害者當中其三的葬禮暫停舉行。 **當局除了確認今日的逮捕行動之外，透露甚少訊息。然而，有關此調查的可靠消息來源向明尼蘇達州的《明星論壇報》透露，那其實是路易·喬丹，他是紅湖部落酋長弗洛伊德·喬丹的 16 歲兒子。**""

And it also says: ""...**被捕的是路易·喬丹，他是紅湖部落酋長弗洛伊德·喬丹的 16 歲兒子。**""  The article identifies Louis Jordan as a 16-year-old, and the context clearly states he was a student involved in the school shooting. Therefore, the correct answer is that he is a student.
"
根據文章，另一名嫌疑犯被捕的消息傳開時，有多少名受害者的喪禮正在舉行？,"The correct answer is **B: 三名**.

The passage states: ""...傑夫·魏斯與九名受害者當中其三的葬禮暫停舉行."" This translates to: ""...Jeff Weise and the funerals of three of the nine victims were suspended.""
"
作為對抗議活動的回應，哪個國家沒有繼續執行他們簽署的反仿冒貿易協定？,"The correct answer is **B: 波蘭**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""波蘭在上個月簽署了反仿冒貿易協定，並在國內引發大型抗議，導致波蘭政府決定暫不批准該協議。"" (Poland signed an anti-counterfeiting trade agreement last month and large-scale protests erupted domestically, leading the Polish government to decide to temporarily not approve the agreement.)

This directly indicates that Poland did *not* continue to implement the agreement.  The other options are incorrect because the passage mentions actions taken *by* those countries, not that they refrained from implementing the agreement.
"
根據文章，以下哪個國家決定推遲加入反仿冒貿易協定的程序？,"The correct answer is **D: 拉脫維亞**.

The text states: ""拉脫維亞及斯洛伐克都推遲加入反仿冒貿易協定的程序。"" (Latvia and Slovakia both postponed the procedure of joining the anti-counterfeiting trade agreement.)
"
有多少人因為 iPod 的過熱事件而受傷？,"The correct answer is **A: 4 人**

The question asks how many people were *injured*. The text states: ""並導致 4 人輕度灼傷"" which translates to ""and resulted in 4 people suffering minor burns"". This directly answers the question about injuries.

While the other numbers represent incidents or reported cases, only 4 people were injured.
"
是誰說過熱事件不是很嚴重？,"The correct answer is **D: 蘋果公司**.

The passage states: ""該公司宣稱這些事件「並不嚴重」."" which translates to ""The company claimed these incidents were ""not serious""."" The company being referred to is Apple.
"
在賈伯斯的演講中，他說蘋果要重塑什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 手機 (Phone)**.

The text explicitly states: ""今天蘋果將重新打造電話"" which translates to ""Today Apple will reinvent the phone."" While he talked about creating history (A), the *thing* they were reinventing was the phone.
"
賈伯斯兩小時演講的目的是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 推出一款新的手機 (Launch a new phone)**.

The prompt explicitly states that the device being presented was the iPhone, and the quote directly mentions ""reimagining the phone"" and ""creating history"" in relation to the phone. Therefore, the purpose of the 2-hour speech was to launch a new phone.
"
克莉絲汀娜·費南德茲·德基希納在阿根廷劇院宣布了什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 她的總統候選人資格 (Her presidential candidacy)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""現任參議員、阿根廷第一夫人克莉絲汀娜‧費南德茲‧德基希納，昨晚在…宣布參選總統。"" This translates to ""Current Senator, First Lady of Argentina Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, last night announced her candidacy for President...""
"
克莉絲汀娜·費南德茲·德基希納在哪裡宣布她要參選？,"The correct answer is **C: 在離布宜諾斯艾利斯 31 英里遠的阿根廷劇院**

Here's why:

* The question asks *where* she announced her candidacy.
* The text states: ""德基西納夫人在阿根廷劇院宣佈有意競選總統..."" (De Kirchner announced her intention to run for president at the Argentino Theater...)
* It also states: ""...距離布宜諾斯艾利斯 50 公里（31 英里）的拉普拉塔市..."" (...in La Plata, 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires...)
* Therefore, the announcement was made at the Argentino Theater in La Plata, which is 31 miles from Buenos Aires. Option C accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 在離拉普拉塔 31 英里遠的劇院** - This is incomplete. It doesn't specify which theater.
* **B: 在拉普拉塔的布宜諾斯艾利斯劇院** - There is no mention of a ""Buenos Aires Theater"" in La Plata.
* **D: 在布宜諾斯艾利斯的拉普拉塔劇院** -  La Plata is a separate city from Buenos Aires. This is a contradiction.
"
澳洲通訊及媒體局對《老大哥》的調查結果是什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 沒有違反審查法 (Did not violate censorship laws)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ACMA also found that while videos circulated online, the *Big Brother* program did not violate the online content review law because the videos were not stored on the *Big Brother* website.""

Therefore, the conclusion of the investigation was that they did not violate the censorship laws. Options B, C, and D are incorrect based on the text.
"
影片必須符合哪些決定因素才能看作是網路內容？,"The correct answer is **B: 必須實體儲存在伺服器上**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""然而若要被視為網際網路內容，必須實體上存在於伺服器上。"" (However, in order to be considered online content, it must physically exist on a server.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 必須在網絡上流傳:** While the video *was* circulating online, the passage clarifies that circulation alone isn't enough.
* **C: 不能儲存在網站上:** The passage states that the video wasn't stored on the *Big Brother* website, but doesn't say that *any* website is prohibited. The crucial point is server storage.
* **D: 必須獲得澳洲通訊及媒體局的批准:** The passage doesn't mention any approval process from ACMA.



"
澳洲自由黨的領袖是誰？,"The correct answer is **A: 彼德·科斯特洛**.

The text states: ""澳洲財政部長彼德‧寇斯特洛...同時也是最可能接任約翰‧霍華德總理成為自由黨主席的人選..."" which directly identifies Peter Costello as a potential leader of the Liberal Party. While John Howard was the Prime Minister, the question asks about the *leader of the Liberal Party*.
"
為什麼澳洲還沒有核能產業？,"The best answer is **A: 缺乏公眾支持 (Lack of public support)**.

Here's why:

The passage *doesn't* explicitly state the reasons for the lack of a nuclear industry in Australia. However, the fact that a prominent figure like the Finance Minister is now expressing support *after* a period of not having a nuclear industry suggests that public opinion was a significant barrier previously.  It implies a shift in perspective likely driven by changing public sentiment.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: 太有爭議 (Too controversial):** While nuclear power *is* controversial, the passage highlights a shift towards acceptance, suggesting the controversy might be lessening, not the primary reason for the lack of industry.
* **C: 太危險 (Too dangerous):**  Safety is always a concern with nuclear power, but the passage doesn't focus on this as the primary reason.  It focuses on the political and economic aspects.
* **D: 太昂貴 (Too expensive):**  The passage mentions economic feasibility (""once it's economically viable""), implying cost is a factor, but it's presented as something that *could* be overcome if the economics are right.  The lack of public support is a more fundamental obstacle.



Therefore, the lack of public support is the most likely and logical reason presented, implied by the context.
"
哪位滑雪者在引導員的幫助下參加比賽？,"The correct answer is **D: 安娜·奧加辛斯卡**.

The text states: ""波蘭男子視障滑雪選手麥傑·克雷澤和領滑員安娜·奧加辛斯卡在超級大迴轉中獲得第 13 名。""  This explicitly says Anna Ogarzynska was the guide for Majer Krejza.
"
哪個國家在女子站姿滑雪超大曲道比賽中排名第十？,"The correct answer is **A: 芬蘭 (Finland)**.

The text states: ""其中包含在昨天的女子站姿滑雪超大曲道比賽中獲得第九名之荷蘭選手安娜‧約赫姆森，以及同一賽事裡第十名的芬蘭選手卡蒂亞·薩利寧。"" This translates to: ""Among them is Dutch athlete Anna Joeghemson who finished ninth in yesterday's women's parallel giant slalom, and Finnish athlete Katja Sarinen who finished tenth in the same event.""
"
根據文章，關於布雷克的哪個說法不正確？,"The correct answer is **B: 他承認攻擊 (He admitted to the attack)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the broadcaster (Blake) **denied** his attack.
* The other options are supported by the text:
    * **A: 他當場被捕 (He was arrested on the spot):** The text says he was arrested ""當場"" (on the spot).
    * **C: 他在攻擊中使用了一根棍子 (He used a stick in the attack):** The text states he used a stick, claiming it was for self-defense.
    * **D: 他聲稱有人向他扔瓶子 (He claimed people threw bottles at him):** The text says he claimed he was attacked by people throwing bottles.

Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that he admitted to the attack.
"
根據文章，以下哪件事沒有發生在布雷克身上？,"The correct answer is **C: 他被人用棍子攻擊 (He was attacked with a stick)**.

Here's why:

* The article states that the broadcaster, Breake, claimed he used the stick to *protect himself* from people throwing bottles at him. It doesn't say he was attacked *with* a stick.
* The article confirms he was arrested (B).
* The article states he was convicted of attempting to obstruct justice (A).
* The article mentions the judge told him he ""almost certainly"" would be sent to prison (D).



"
聯合國的全球暖化經費不會用於什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 緩解全球暖化的影響**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the funding is *to help countries solve problems *derived from* global warming*. This means it addresses the *consequences* of global warming, not the global warming itself.
* The text mentions the funding can be used for things *resulting from* global warming, like flood shelters, water management, and crop diversification.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 農作物多樣化:**  The text says this is a use of the funding.
* **B: 將技術帶到發展中國家:** The text explicitly mentions sharing technology with developing countries.
* **C: 防洪房屋:** The text explicitly mentions this as a use of the funding.



"
根據文章，聯合國希望拯救什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 剩餘的雨林 (Remaining forests)**.

The passage states: ""峇里島議程中其他主題包括拯救世界上剩餘的森林..."" which directly translates to ""Other topics in the Bali agenda include saving the remaining forests in the world...""
"
以下哪項不是阿爾伯特·穆昌加認為仍需商定的事項？,"The correct answer is **A: 貝南共和國是否加入非洲大陸自由貿易區協定**

Here's why:

* The text states that Benin is *going to* join AfCFTA, meaning the decision to join is already made.
* The text explicitly mentions that ""we have not yet reached an agreement on **origin rules and tariff concessions**.""
* The text also states that they *can* start trading on July 1, 2020, despite not having an agreement on origin rules and tariff concessions.

Therefore, the only item that hasn't been agreed upon is the origin rules and tariff concessions.  The question asks which is *not* something they are still discussing. Since Benin is confirmed to be joining, that's not the correct answer.
"
根據文章，為什麼交易可以在七月開始？,"The correct answer is **B: 已經有足夠的規則和讓步架構 (There is already a sufficient framework of rules and concessions)**.

The passage states: ""我們尚未在原產地規則和關稅減讓上取得協議， 但我們所建立的架構已足以讓我們在 2020 年 7 月 1 日開始進行交易。"" (We have not yet reached an agreement on rules of origin and tariff concessions, but the framework we have established is sufficient for us to begin trading on July 1, 2020.)

This clearly indicates that the existing framework, despite lacking complete agreements on origin rules and tariff reductions, is enough to start trading.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 七月開始日期是奈及利亞加入非洲大陸自由貿易區協定的條件之一 (The July start date is one of the conditions for Nigeria to join the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement)** - The passage doesn't state that Nigeria joining is a condition for the July start date.
* **C: 已獲得非洲聯盟貿易和工業處長的批准 (Has been approved by the Director of Trade and Industry of the African Union)** - While the director announced Benin's upcoming joining, the passage doesn't mention approval being a direct cause for the July start date.
* **D: 已經商定原產地規則和關稅減讓 (Rules of origin and tariff concessions have already been agreed upon)** - The passage explicitly states that an agreement hasn't been reached on these matters.



"
根據文章，亞特蘭大憲法報指責教育官員做什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 沒有針對檢測到的內部問題採取行動**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Atlanta Constitution reported that ""schools had conducted an internal investigation but had not taken action on the findings.""
* This directly supports option C. 
* Option A is incorrect because the report *revealed* test score issues, it didn't accuse them of tampering with the report itself.
* Option B is incorrect because the passage says she was recognized for *innovative* urban education.
* Option D is incorrect because the report indicated *rapid* score increases, not low scores.



"
根據文中提供的資訊，亞特蘭大憲法報的報告中沒有提到什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 創新城市教育的建議 (Suggestions for innovative city education)**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the report *didn't* mention.
* The text explicitly states the report focused on the *speed* of test score improvement and the *lack of action* taken despite internal investigations.
* Options A and B are mentioned directly in the text.
* Option C refers to the award given to the person in question, which is mentioned in the text.
* Option D, ""suggestions for innovative city education,"" is not mentioned in the text regarding the report. The report focused on the rapid score increases, not on recommending ways to improve education.



Therefore, D is the only option that is *not* supported by the provided text."
根據文章，哪些資訊在爆炸後得知？,"The correct answer is **A: 最終傷害統計 (Final casualty statistics)** and **C: 是否有額外的炸彈被引爆 (Whether there were additional bombs detonated)**.

Here's why:

* **A: 最終傷害統計 (Final casualty statistics):** The text states ""官方報導則證實多達 30 人受傷；但真正的人數仍不得而知。"" which implies the initial reports were incomplete and a final count wasn't available. This directly refers to the final casualty statistics.
* **C: 是否有額外的炸彈被引爆 (Whether there were additional bombs detonated):** The text states ""兩小時內有另外三顆炸彈在政府大樓附近爆炸。"" indicating that the presence of additional bombs was discovered after the initial explosion.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: 炸彈爆炸附近的建築物 (Buildings near the bomb explosions):** The text mentions the bombs exploded ""在當地行政長官的辦公室外"" and ""在政府大樓附近"", so the location is mentioned upfront, not after the explosions.
* **D: 官方死亡人數 (Official death toll):** While the text mentions an official death toll, it also states that the ""真正的人數仍不得而知"" (the real number is still unknown). Therefore, while a number was released, it wasn't the final, confirmed number.
"
自 2017 年加入曼徹斯特城足球俱樂部以來，熱蘇斯參加了幾場比賽？,"The correct answer is **D: 53 場**.

The question asks how many matches Jesus played *since joining*. The text states: ""自此之後，這位巴西選手共為該球隊踢了 53 場球賽..."" which translates to ""Since then, the Brazilian player has played a total of 53 matches for the club..."".
"
熱蘇斯因加入哪個俱樂部收取 £2700 萬英鎊的報酬？,"The correct answer is **B: 曼徹斯特城**.

The passage states: ""21 歲的熱蘇斯於 2017 年 1 月從巴西的帕梅拉斯體育俱樂部加入了曼徹斯特城足球俱樂部..."" which directly indicates he joined Manchester City.
"
關於旅館房客的哪個說法是不正確的？,"The correct answer is **D: 大多數房客來自聖城 (Most guests came from the holy city)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the majority of guests were from the United Arab Emirates.** This directly contradicts the statement that ""most guests came from the holy city.""
* **A: 房客來麥加朝聖 (Guests came to Mecca for pilgrimage):** This is explicitly stated in the passage.
* **B: 有些房客不是當地公民 (Some guests were not local citizens):** The passage mentions the majority are from the UAE, implying they are not local to Mecca.
* **C: 房客們在朝覲前夕到達那裡 (Guests arrived there before the Hajj):** The passage mentions they were visiting ""in preparation for the Hajj,"" which means they arrived before the pilgrimage.



Therefore, option D is the incorrect statement."
根據文章，以下哪個陳述是正確的？,"The correct answer is **C: 房客們在朝覲前夕到達那裡 (The guests arrived there before the Hajj)**.

Here's why:

* **The article states:** ""這座建築物留宿了一些在麥加朝覲前夕造訪聖城的朝聖者們"" which translates to ""This building housed some pilgrims who were visiting the holy city of Mecca before the Hajj.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 無人死亡 (No one died):** The article explicitly states ""至少 15 人死亡 (At least 15 people died).""
* **B: 所有房客皆來自阿拉伯聯合大公國 (All guests were from the United Arab Emirates):** The article says the guests were *mainly* from the United Arab Emirates, not *all* of them.
* **D: 阿拉伯聯合大公國人民 (People from the United Arab Emirates):** This is too general. While many guests were from the UAE, the statement is not specific enough to be considered the *most* accurate based on the provided text. Option C is more specific and directly supported by the article.



"
根據文章，有關碰撞，哪些並非不確定的資訊？,"The correct answer is **B: 碰撞的地點**.

Here's why:

* **The article explicitly states uncertainty about the scale of the collision, its impact on Earth, and the location of the debris.**  The phrase ""They are still trying to determine..."" directly indicates uncertainty.
* **The collision location is *known*:** The article states the collision happened ""491 miles above Earth."" This is a specific, stated fact.

Therefore, the only thing not uncertain is the altitude of the collision.
"
根據文章，以下關於碰撞的哪些事情有待商榷？,"The correct answer is **D: 碰撞的確切規模 (The exact scale of the collision)**.

Here's why:

* The article states scientists are ""still trying to determine the scale of the impact."" This directly indicates that the scale is *not* yet known and is under investigation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 誰來負責處理殘骸追蹤 (Who is responsible for tracking the debris):** The article explicitly states, ""美國國防部戰略司令部正在追蹤殘骸 (The U.S. Strategic Command of the Department of Defense is tracking the debris).""  This is known.
* **B: 碰撞時衛星的行進速度 (The speed of the satellites during the collision):** The article provides the speed of the satellites (""每小時 17,500 英里左右的速度 (approximately 17,500 mph)"").  This is stated as a fact.
* **C: 如何共享繪圖分析結果 (How the graphic analysis results will be shared):** The article states, ""分析圖將公佈在一個公開網站上 (The analysis graphic will be posted on a public website)."" The *how* of sharing isn't the point; the fact that it *will* be publicly available is stated.

Therefore, only the exact scale of the collision is still being determined according to the text.
"
根據文章，巴汀曾在美國人富豪名單上排名第幾？,"The correct answer is **C: 第 190 名**.

The question asks for the ranking of Bartin on the USrichest list. The text states: ""巴汀以估計為 23 億美元的財產，在 2008 年美國前四百大富豪排行榜上名列第 190 位。""  This translates to ""Bartin, with an estimated fortune of $2.3 billion, ranked 190th on the 2008 USrichest list.""
"
巴汀曾向以下哪個機構捐款？,"The correct answer is **B: 維吉尼亞大學**.

The text explicitly states: ""他大力資助該學院"" which refers to the学院 he graduated from, which is the College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Virginia.  Therefore, he donated to the University of Virginia.
"
阿諾·史瓦辛格州長簽署的法案中不包含哪一部份？,"The correct answer is **C: 禁止在加州以外的地方向未成年人出售或租借暴力電動遊戲**.

Here's why:

* The question asks what the law *doesn't* include. The text states the law is *specific to California*.
* Options A, B, and D are all explicitly mentioned in the text as part of the law.
* Option C addresses sales *outside* of California, which the law does not cover.

Therefore, the law only restricts sales *within* California.
"
根據文章，誰錯過了別人正在說的事情？,"The correct answer is **C: 米勒**.

The passage states: ""When Miller was asked for comment, he said: 'Mike said a lot at the hearing… I was preparing at the time, so I actually didn't hear what he said.'"" This clearly indicates Miller missed what Mike said.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 杜瓦爾的孩子們:** The passage doesn't mention Duval's children missing anything.
* **B: 麥克:** The passage says Mike *said* a lot, implying he was the one speaking.
* **D: 杜瓦爾:** The passage states Duval didn't leave an impression on Miller, but doesn't say Duval missed anything being said.



"
根據文章，以下哪項米勒在聽證會上的經歷是正確的？,"The correct answer is **B: 他正在準備所以沒有注意 (He was preparing, so he didn't listen.)**

The text explicitly states: ""當米勒被要求發表評論時，他表示：「麥克在聽證會上說了很多……我那時正在做準備，所以其實沒聽到他說了什麼。」"" which translates to ""When Miller was asked to comment, he said: 'Mike said a lot at the hearing... I was preparing at the time, so I didn't actually hear what he said.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 杜瓦爾在聽證會上給米勒留下了深刻的印象 (Duval left a lasting impression on Miller at the hearing):** The text says Duval did *not* leave a lasting impression.
* **C: 杜瓦爾的兩個孩子在聽證會期間講了很多話 (Duval's two children spoke a lot during the hearing):** The text doesn't mention Duval's children at all.
* **D: 他當時認真聆聽了杜瓦爾的故事 (He was listening attentively to Duval's story at the time):** The text explicitly states he wasn't listening attentively because he was preparing.



"
是誰建議對《空氣潔淨法》進行修訂？,"The correct answer is **C: 傑克·林頓**.

The passage explicitly states: ""雷頓在與總理的會面中，請求修改保守黨的環境法案，要求「全面徹底改寫」保守黨所提的環境法案。""  (Rayton requested amendments to the Conservative Party's environment bill, demanding a ""complete rewrite"" of the environment bill put forward by the Conservative Party.)

While John Howard is mentioned as the Prime Minister who responded to the Mercy Hospital situation, and Stephen Harper met with Jack Layton, the passage clearly indicates **Jack Layton** requested amendments to the environment bill."
是誰駁斥《空氣潔淨法》被當作選舉前的噱頭？,"The correct answer is **B: 一位總理 (A Prime Minister)**.

The text states: ""但總理約翰·霍華德表示，該法案只是為了保護醫院的設施不被塔斯馬尼亞政府降級，為此撥出額外的 4,500 萬澳幣。"" This directly indicates that Prime Minister John Howard refuted the claim that the legislation was an election gimmick.
"
當三聚氰酸和三聚氰胺在貓尿中相互反應時，會形成什麼化合物？,"The correct answer is **C: 結晶 (Crystals)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the researchers observed crystals forming when they added melamine and cyanuric acid to cat urine.
* The FTIR analysis confirmed that the crystals formed in the experiment matched the crystals found in the urine of poisoned pets.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 腎臟 (Kidneys)** - While the crystals *affect* the kidneys, the question asks what the reactants *form*.
* **B: 寵物食品 (Pet food)** -  Pet food is the *source* of the contamination, not what the chemicals react to form.
* **D: 紅外線光譜學 (Infrared spectroscopy)** - FTIR is a *method* used to analyze the crystals, not what the chemicals form.



"
研究人員使用紅外光譜觀察了什麼？,"The correct answer is **B: 寵物尿液中的結晶成份 (The composition of crystals in pet urine)**.

Here's why:

* The question specifically asks what the researchers *observed* using FTIR (Infrared Spectroscopy).
* The text states they *compared* crystals formed in a lab (with added melamine and cyanuric acid) to the crystals found in the affected pet urine.
* FTIR is a technique used to analyze the chemical composition of materials. Therefore, they were using it to identify the *composition of the crystals*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 腎臟功能 (Kidney function):** While the crystals *impacted* kidney function, the researchers weren't directly measuring kidney function with FTIR.
* **C: 受影響的寵物 (Affected pets):**  The researchers were analyzing urine samples *from* affected pets, but they weren't observing the pets themselves using FTIR.
* **D: 受污染的寵物食品 (Contaminated pet food):**  The FTIR analysis focused on the crystals found *in the urine*, not on the composition of the contaminated food itself.



"
誰稱露娜為「極限女王」？,"The correct answer is **D: 湯米·卓門**.

The text states: ""湯米·卓門曾說：「露娜是第一位極限女王。」"" (Tommy Dreamer said: ""Luna was the first Extreme Queen."")

While Dustin Runnels also expresses admiration for Luna, he doesn't specifically call her the ""極限女王"" (Extreme Queen).
"
誰指稱露娜很「怪異」？,"The correct answer is **B: 達斯汀·讓尼爾斯**.

The text states: ""知名摔角手「金粉」達斯汀·讓尼爾斯 (Dustin Runnels) 評論說：「盧納和我一樣怪異…或許甚至比我還要怪異…我愛她，並且會想念她……希望她去了一個更好的地方。」""

This directly attributes the statement about Luna being ""怪異"" (strange/quirky) to Dustin Runnels.
"
撞車事故中的司機沒有發生什麼事？,"The correct answer is **A: 他頭部受傷 (He suffered a head injury)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""然而，那名司機的頭部受到了嚴重的傷害 (However, the driver suffered serious head injuries).""
* Option B is true, but the question asks what *happened to the driver*.
* Option C is incorrect. The driver was transferred *from* Addenbrooke's Hospital *to* James Paget Hospital.
* Option D is true, but it's a detail about the rescue, not what happened to the driver himself.

Therefore, the most direct and accurate answer to the question is that the driver suffered a head injury.
"
在橄欖球賽期間，何者並非南非隊比賽突出的地方？,"The correct answer is **C: 在比賽開始時表現出色 (Performing exceptionally well at the start of the match)**.

The text explicitly states: ""賽事頭號種子南非隊開賽非常順利，以 26 比 0 輕鬆取勝第五種子尚比亞隊。"" This translates to ""Tournament top seed South Africa started very smoothly, easily defeating fifth seed Zambia 26-0.""  This confirms they *did* start well.

The text highlights:
* **令人印象深刻的團隊合作 (Impressive teamwork)**
* **控球能力 (Ball control ability)**
* **防守技巧 (Defensive skills)**

Therefore, the option that is *not* mentioned as a standout feature is their performance at the start.
"
根據文章，南非隊的比賽是什麼時候開始進步的？,"The correct answer is **D: 隨著比賽的進行 (As the game progressed)**.

The text states: ""雖然在比賽中與南方姊妹們相比確實生疏了些，但隨著比賽的進行，南非隊很穩定地在進步。"" This directly translates to ""Although they were a bit rusty compared to their Southern sisters during the game, as the game progressed, the South African team steadily improved.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: 大約在上午 10:00 (Around 10:00 AM):** This is the start time of the game, not when they started improving.
* **B: 加強防守之後 (After strengthening defense):** The text mentions disciplined defense as a factor in their success, but doesn't say they improved *after* strengthening it. It implies improvement happened *with* the game going on.
* **C: 在輸給尚比亞隊之後 (After losing to Zambia):** South Africa won against Zambia.



"
根據文章，哪一個陳述並未正確反映中國的經濟狀況？,"The correct answer is **D: 中國出口的汽車從未比德國多 (China's car exports have never been greater than Germany's).**

The passage explicitly states: ""去年中國汽車的出口量首次超越德國，也超越美國成為該產業最大的市場。"" (Last year, China's car exports first surpassed Germany's, and also surpassed the United States to become the largest market in the industry.)

This directly contradicts option D. Options A, B, and C are all supported by the information in the passage.
"
根據文章，中國的國民生產毛額 (GDP) 何時可能會超過美國？,"The correct answer is **B: 在二十年內 (In twenty years)**.

The passage states: ""中國的 GDP 在 20 年之內就可能超過美國。"" which translates to ""China's GDP could surpass the United States within 20 years.""

Therefore, option B is the accurate answer.
"
胡錦濤建議發展中國家做什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 避免污染的老路**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""他鼓勵發展中的國家「避免先汙染、後清理的老路」"" which translates to ""He encouraged developing countries to avoid the old road of 'polluting first, then cleaning up.'""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 承擔推動其發展階段的義務 (Bear the obligations that promote their development stage):**  While the passage mentions not asking developing countries to take on obligations beyond their capabilities, it doesn't say they should *bear* obligations to promote development.
* **B: 注重經濟產出 (Focus on economic output):** The passage states they will reduce emissions *in relation to* economic output, but doesn't say they should *focus* on economic output.  It's about the relationship between economic growth and emissions.
* **C: 承擔超出他們目前的責任 (Bear obligations beyond their current responsibilities):** This is directly contradicted by the passage, which says *not* to ask them to take on obligations beyond their capabilities.



"
胡錦濤沒提到什麼？,"The correct answer is **D: 碳減排量的數字 (A number for carbon emission reduction)**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""他沒有設定減少的數量，只聲稱將依據中國的經濟產出進行削減。"" (He did not set a reduction amount, only stating that it would be reduced based on China's economic output.)
* **Option D directly reflects this statement.** 胡錦濤 did not mention a specific number or percentage of carbon emissions to be reduced.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 削減的基礎 (The basis for reduction):** He *did* mention the basis for reduction – China's economic output.
* **B: 對發展中國家在污染方面的建議 (Suggestions for developing countries regarding pollution):** He *did* offer advice on avoiding the ""pollute and then clean up"" approach.
* **C: 希望減少碳排放的日期 (The date for desired carbon emission reduction):** He *did* mention the target year of 2020.



"
費爾曼說以下何者的情況不好？,"The correct answer is **B: 安哥拉 (Angola)**.

The statement explicitly says: ""無國界醫生的發言人理查‧費爾曼表示：「安哥拉正面臨它們有史以來最嚴重的疫情，且**安哥拉的情況仍然非常糟**。」"" (A spokesperson for Doctors Without Borders, Richard Fehrman, said: ""Angola is facing its worst outbreak ever, and **the situation in Angola is still very bad**."")
"
由於起訴，誰將接任休恩的內閣職位？,"The correct answer is **A: 戴維**.

The passage states: ""休恩已辭職，他在內閣的職位將由愛德·戴維議員接任。"" which translates to ""Hoon has resigned, and his cabinet position will be taken over by Ed Davey.""
"
在起訴後，誰將出任商務大臣？,"The correct answer is **A: 蘭姆**.

The text states: ""諾曼·蘭姆議員有望接替戴維，出任商務大臣一職。"" (Norman Lamb is expected to replace David as Business Secretary.)
"
表演者在卡米爾·聖桑的歌劇中鼓勵觀眾做什麼？,"The correct answer is **A: 參與使用大麻 (Participate in using marijuana)**.

The prompt explicitly states that performers smoke marijuana on stage and the theater encourages audiences to do the same. This directly links the performance to the act of using marijuana.
"
誰主要在歌劇中抽大麻捲菸？,"The correct answer is **C: 表演者**.

The prompt states: ""因此，表演者在舞台上抽大麻捲菸..."" which directly indicates the performers are the ones smoking marijuana. While the opera is *about* an artist who uses drugs, the question asks *who* smokes in the opera, and the prompt specifies it's the performers.
"
雷歐諾夫執行的「太空漫步」的另一個名稱是什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: 艙外活動 (Extravehicular Activity)**.

The text explicitly states that 雷歐諾夫's EVA is also known as ""太空漫步"" (spacewalk) and then provides the English equivalent, which is ""艙外活動"" (Extravehicular Activity).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 阿波羅-聯盟任務 (Apollo-Soyuz Test Project):** This was a later mission, 10 years after his first spacewalk.
*   **B: 太空競賽 (Space Race):** This was the broader context in which the mission occurred, not the name of the spacewalk itself.
*   **D: 11 號太空人 (Cosmonaut 11):** This is 雷歐諾夫's designation, not the name of the spacewalk.



"
雷歐諾夫帶領蘇聯執行了哪項任務？,"The correct answer is **B: 阿波羅-聯盟 (Apollo-Soyuz)**.

The text states: ""10 年後，他帶領阿波羅-聯盟測試計劃中的蘇聯部份，象徵了太空競賽的結束。"" (10 years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz test program, symbolizing the end of the space race.)
"
誰在車禍中受傷？,"The correct answer is **A: 吉布森**.

The text states: ""意外發生後，吉布森被送往醫院，但不久後便身亡。"" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.)

While the other options mention people present at the scene, the text explicitly states Gibson was injured and died. The text *doesn't* say the car garage worker or the children were injured. The truck driver (Gibson) didn't sustain injuries in the accident.

Therefore, the only person confirmed to have been injured is Gibson.
"
捲入事故中的人們發生了什麼事？,"The correct answer is **B: 一個沒受傷，一個死了** (One was uninjured, one died).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""64 歲的卡車司機沒有在車禍中受傷，但不久後便身亡。"" (The 64-year-old truck driver was not injured in the accident but died shortly after.)
* This directly matches option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 他們都死了** (They all died) - Incorrect, the truck driver survived initially.
* **C: 他們尖叫和哭泣** (They screamed and cried) - This describes witnesses, not the people involved in the accident.
* **D: 兩人都受了傷** (Both were injured) - Incorrect, the truck driver was not injured.



"
為該計劃工作的科學家希望觀察以下何者造成的影響？,"The correct answer is **B: 潮汐引力**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""該團隊想觀察到的效應，是由此星系與銀河各自之暗物質交互影響潮汐的結果..."" (The team wants to observe the effects resulting from the interaction of dark matter from these galaxies affecting tidal forces...).
* **Tidal forces** are the gravitational forces that cause celestial bodies to bulge or distort due to the gravitational pull of another body. The passage directly connects the observation to tidal forces, drawing an analogy to the Moon's effect on Earth's tides.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 固定事件 (Fixed events):** While the interactions might *lead to* fixed events, the *primary* focus of the observation is on the *process* of the tidal forces.
* **C: 小粒子 (Small particles):** The passage mentions the dark matter being composed of ""許多微粒所組成"" (many particles), but the observation isn't *of* the particles themselves. It's of the resulting effect.
* **D: 暗物質 (Dark matter):**  The scientists aren't directly observing the dark matter. They are observing the *effect* of the dark matter's interaction, specifically the tidal forces.

Therefore, **潮汐引力 (Tidal forces)** is the most accurate answer as it directly reflects the scientific phenomenon the team aims to observe.
"
科學家正在觀察下列哪些事物？,"The correct answer is **D: 人馬座星系和銀河**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the project aims to simulate observations of the **Andromeda Galaxy** (人馬座星系) and its interaction with the **Milky Way Galaxy** (銀河). 
* The analogy to the Moon's effect on Earth's tides is used to explain the gravitational interaction between these galaxies, implying the observation of their mutual gravitational influence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 銀河和月球 (Galaxies and Moon):** The focus is on galaxies, not the Moon.
* **B: 地球和人馬座星系 (Earth and Andromeda Galaxy):** The Earth is not involved in the proposed observations.
* **C: 地球和月球 (Earth and Moon):**  This is the analogy used to *explain* the concept, not what is being observed.



"
根據文章，保守派不會批評以下何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 缺乏重建努力 (Lack of rebuilding efforts)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that fiscal conservatives are debating the cost of relief and reconstruction, and humorously call it ""Bush's New Orleans Trade.""** This indicates they are concerned about the expense.
* **The passage also states that liberals criticize the reconstruction contracts for rewarding ""Washington insiders.""** This shows they are focused on *who* is benefiting.
* **The question asks what conservatives *wouldn't* criticize.** Since conservatives are focused on the cost and the fairness of the contracts (who benefits), they would likely *not* criticize the amount of rebuilding efforts undertaken. They are already debating the expense, so criticizing the effort itself wouldn't be a new point of contention for them.

Therefore, conservatives are primarily focused on the **cost (A and D)** and the **recipient of the contracts (C)**.  They would likely not criticize the rebuilding efforts themselves, as their concerns are centered around the financial and equitable aspects of the response.



"
誰在批評卡崔娜颶風救援工作的重建合約？,"The correct answer is **B: 自由派 (Liberals)**.

The passage states: ""自由派對推動重建的批評，主要在於重建合約犒賞了一般認為的華府圈內人。"" (Liberals criticized the push for reconstruction, mainly because the reconstruction contracts rewarded people considered part of Washington's inner circle.)
"
根據文章，星塵號太空船發出的光首先會在哪裡看到？,"The correct answer is **B: 北加州**.

The article states: ""It will fly over the **west coast of Northern California**, lighting up from California to central Oregon, then through Nevada and Idaho into Utah."" Therefore, Northern California is where the light will first be seen.
"
根據文章，該太空船將創下以下哪一項紀錄？,"The correct answer is **C: 最快返回地球 (Fastest return to Earth)**.

The article explicitly states: ""星塵號將是最快返回地球的太空船並因而創下新的歷史紀錄，打破 1969 年 5 月阿波羅 10 號指揮艙返航時所創的舊紀錄。"" which translates to ""Stardust will be the fastest spacecraft to return to Earth and thus set a new record, breaking the old record set by the Apollo 10 command module's return in May 1969.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 照亮最寬闊的天空 (Lighting the widest sky):** While the article describes a spectacular light show, it doesn't state it will be the *widest* sky illuminated.
* **B: 最多城市可看到它 (Seen by the most cities):** The article mentions the path it will take, but doesn't say it will be visible from the most cities.
* **D: 最快從舊金山抵達洛杉磯 (Fastest from San Francisco to Los Angeles):**  This is a speed calculation used for comparison, but it's not a record the spacecraft itself is setting.



"
馬拉·巴拉蘇布拉曼尼安醫生是薩羅雅·巴拉蘇布拉馬尼安的誰？,"The correct answer is **C: 母親 (Mother)**.

The text states: ""They found the body of Saroya Balasubramanian, 53, covered with a blood-stained blanket. Police said the body had been there for about a day."" and earlier states, ""29-year-old Dr. Malar Balasubramanian was found in Brookville, a suburb about 15 miles north of Cincinnati, wearing a t-shirt and underwear lying on the ground, apparently having ingested a large amount of drugs. She directed officers to a black Audi Intrigue sedan 500 feet away. **They found Saroya Balasubramanian's body in there.**""

This implies that Malar is the daughter of Saroya.
"
薩羅雅·巴拉蘇布拉馬尼安的屍體在哪裡被發現？,"The correct answer is **C: 汽車後車箱 (Car trunk)**.

The text states: ""他們在那裏發現了薩羅雅·巴拉蘇布拉馬尼安的遺體，53 歲的她身上蓋著沾了血跡的毯子。警方說，屍體看起來已擺在那裏 1 天左右。"" which translates to ""They found the body of Saroya Balasubramanian there, 53 years old, covered with a bloodstained blanket. Police said the body had been lying there for about a day."" The ""there"" refers to the trunk of the black Audi Intrigue car.
"
eBay 收購了什麼？,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states: ""這是 eBay 歷史上所進行的最大收購。該公司希望將其利潤來源多元化，並在中國、東歐及巴西等 Skype 佔據優勢的地區增加知名度。"" which translates to ""This is the largest acquisition in eBay's history. The company hopes to diversify its sources of profit and increase its awareness in regions where Skype has an advantage, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.""
"
eBay 希望透過此次收購實現什麼目標？,"The correct answer is **B: 擴展到新的領域 (Expand into new areas)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states eBay wants to ""diversify its revenue streams"" and ""increase its presence in regions where Skype has a stronghold.""  This points directly to expansion into new areas (in this case, communication/messaging).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: 鞏固其收入 (Consolidate its revenue):** While expansion *can* contribute to revenue consolidation, the primary goal mentioned is diversification, not simply strengthening existing revenue.
* **C: 提高知名度 (Increase awareness):** While increased awareness is a *result* of expanding into new areas, it's not the core *goal* of the acquisition as stated in the passage.
* **D: 讓股東滿意 (Satisfy shareholders):** This is a general business objective, but not specifically mentioned as the driving force *behind this particular acquisition*.



"
根據文章，誰沒有與留在現場的囚犯互動？,"The answer is **D: 醫院工作人員**.

Here's why:

* **談判者 (Negotiator):** The passage states the negotiator *tried* to address the prisoners' needs.
* **消防救援人員 (Firefighters):**  The fire department extinguished the fire.
* **警察 (Police):** The police entered the yard and used tear gas.
* **醫院工作人員 (Hospital Staff):** The passage only mentions that injured prisoners were sent *to* the hospital after the fighting stopped. There's no indication that hospital staff interacted with the prisoners in the yard.

Therefore, hospital staff are the only ones explicitly *not* mentioned as interacting with the prisoners in the courtyard."
以下哪一項最終讓囚犯們停止暴動？,"The correct answer is **B: 催淚瓦斯 (Tear gas)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the police used tear gas to ""逼到死角"" (force the prisoners into a corner). This action directly led to the prisoners being contained and unable to continue the riot.
* While the injury of the prisoner and the initial negotiation occurred, they did not stop the riot. The tear gas was the immediate factor that ended the active violence and forced the prisoners to submit.
* The fire was a consequence of the riot, not the cause of its end.

Therefore, tear gas was the element that ultimately stopped the riot.
"
在阿亞圖拉賽義德阿里·哈米尼的觀點中，伊朗應該從什麼之中解放？,"The correct answer is **D: 對石油的依賴 (Dependence on oil)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""該國最高領袖大阿亞圖拉賽義德阿里·哈米尼曾形容，對石油的依賴是一個早在 1979 年伊朗伊斯蘭革命之前就出現的「陷阱」，而伊朗應該從中解放出來。""  This directly translates to: ""The country's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei once described the dependence on oil as a 'trap' that existed long before the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution, and Iran should be freed from it.""

The other options are incorrect because:

* **A: 金融限制 (Financial restrictions):** While financial restrictions are mentioned as part of the sanctions, Khamenei's statement focuses on a broader issue.
* **B: 伊斯蘭革命 (Islamic Revolution):** The passage refers to the revolution as a historical point *before* the oil dependence issue.
* **C: 國外收益 (Foreign earnings):**  While foreign earnings are impacted, the core problem Khamenei identifies is the *reliance* on oil for those earnings.



"
根據文章，誰承認了制裁對伊朗經濟的影響？,"The correct answer is **A: 高層消息來源 (High-level sources)**.

The first sentence of the passage states: ""在電視上直播的評論中，伊朗高層消息來源首次承認制裁有產生影響。"" This directly translates to ""In televised commentary, Iranian high-level sources for the first time admitted that sanctions are having an impact.""

While the OPEC report and Ayatollah Khamenei's statements are mentioned, the passage explicitly states that *high-level sources* were the first to *admit* the impact of the sanctions.
"
以下哪項不是法國投票程序的一部分？,"The correct answer is **C: 簽署投票單 (Signing the ballot)**.

The text explicitly states that voters sign the voting record *after* placing the ballot in the envelope, but it doesn't mention signing a separate ""投票單"" (voting slip).  The process described involves marking a ballot and then placing it in an envelope, which is then placed in the ballot box, followed by signing the voting record.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the process:

* **A: 透明投票箱 (Transparent ballot boxes):** The text clearly states that ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988.
* **B: 由候選人派出的代表 (Representatives dispatched by candidates):**  The text explicitly mentions that candidates can send representatives to observe the entire process.
* **D: 由候選人代表進行計票 (Counting by candidate representatives):** The text states that volunteers count the ballots under strict supervision, implying that candidates are allowed to have representatives present.

Therefore, signing a separate ""投票單"" is not mentioned as part of the established voting procedure described in the passage.
"
選民在哪裡指明他們選擇的候選人？,"The correct answer is **B: 在事先印妥的紙上 (On pre-printed ballots)**.

The passage states: ""投票者獨自在投票亭內，將事先印妥表明投票對象的選票放入信封中。"" This translates to: ""Voters alone in the voting booth, place pre-printed ballots indicating the object of their vote into an envelope.""
"
是什麼促使艾倫開始為期八年的武藏號搜尋？,"The correct answer is **D: 他對戰爭的興趣 (His interest in war)**.

The text states: ""...and out of a lifelong interest in war, he began searching for the Musashi."" This directly links his motivation for the search to his interest in war. While his wealth and investment enabled the search, the *reason* he was searching is his interest in war.
"
根據文章，艾倫將他的大部分財產用於何者？,"The correct answer is **B: 海洋探險 (Ocean exploration)**.

The passage states: ""艾倫已將大部分財產投入於海洋探勘中..."" which translates to ""Allen has invested most of his fortune in ocean exploration...""
"
根據文章，以下何者可能導致工廠內部和周圍出現危險情況？,"The best answer is **A: 鈾燃料 (Uranium fuel)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""有關當局推測，現場裝有鈾燃料的容器可能已經破裂並正在洩漏。"" (Authorities suspect that containers containing uranium fuel may have broken and are leaking.)
* **The passage also mentions:** ""日本政府核能機構表示已在核電廠找到放射性銫及碘。"" (The Japanese Nuclear Authority announced that radioactive caesium and iodine have been found in the nuclear power plant.)
* **While radioactive caesium and iodine are dangerous, the primary *cause* of a potential catastrophic situation, according to the passage's speculation, is the potential leak from the uranium fuel containers.** Uranium fuel is the core material that generates the heat in a nuclear reactor, and a leak suggests a serious malfunction.  The other options are *results* of a potential problem (radiation detection), not necessarily the *cause* of the dangerous situation.

Therefore, a broken uranium fuel container leaking is the most likely direct cause of the danger described.
"
