"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe agaghị anabata ka okwu ọma kpọmkwem banyere ịgwu egwu akọdịọnụ?","The correct answer is **C: Gbaa mbọ hụ na ịna-apị notu dịka ịna-edebe aka gị nkeọma.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of relaxed hand movements and avoiding unnecessary movements when playing the accordion. Option C directly aligns with this advice, stating to ensure you press the notes gently and with relaxation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maka ụda ọzọ, melite ike nke ị ji pikinye igodo:** While using the bellows with power is important for volume, the passage doesn't focus on *increasing* power, but rather *using* the bellows correctly.
*   **B: Debe nkwụgharị abaghị ụrụ n’akụkụ ịji jikwaa ume gị:** The passage doesn't mention controlling breath in that specific way.
*   **D: Wegote ike iji apị beelo ịji nwetakwu nnukwu olu egwu:** The passage specifically warns against using excessive force.



"
"Ka iji akọdịọnụ egwu egwu, kedụ n’ihe ndị a ga-enye aka inwelite olu egwu?","The best answer is **B: Tinyekwuo ike (Increase the volume)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses achieving a full, rich sound on the accordion.**  The key takeaway is not to overuse hand movements and to use subtle techniques for tone.
* **Increasing the volume directly contributes to a fuller, more powerful sound.**  It's a fundamental way to make the instrument heard and impactful.
* **The other options are less relevant:**
    * **A: Tinyekwuo ọsọ (Increase the tempo):** Tempo affects the *speed* of the music, not necessarily the *volume* or *fullness* of the sound.
    * **C: Welata nkwakanye (Remove the resonator):**  Removing the resonator would likely *decrease* the volume and change the tone in a negative way.
    * **D: Welata nkwagharị mkpịsị aka (Remove the bellows support):** This would severely impact the ability to play the accordion.

Therefore, increasing the volume is the most direct way to achieve the desired fuller sound discussed in the passage.

Kedụ ihe kpatara eji egbupu akụkụ ihenlere dị n’igwe onyonyo egbupu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka ihenlere juputa n’ihu igwe onyonyo niile.**

Here's why:

The question describes ""ovaskan,"" which is essentially screen burn-in. The passage states that ""The image is stretched so that everything on the TV screen covers it completely, top, bottom and sides."" This stretching is done to make the image more appealing and fill the screen.  Therefore, the purpose of stretching the image is to make the picture completely fill the display.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ka anabata ideputa nwa isiokwu (To save the main article):** This is irrelevant to screen stretching.
* **C: Ka ihenlere juputa n'ụdị ọzọ (To fill the image in another format):** While resizing is a possibility, the context is specifically about *stretching* to fill the entire screen.
* **D: Ka egbupu nwa isiokwu ndị nọ nsona mgbada (To stretch the main article to the edges):**  This is too specific. The stretching isn't just about the main article; it's about *everything* on the screen.

"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee mmekpahụ mmadụ nwere ike ihu n’ịtụgharị ihenlere n’ụdị DVD?","The correct answer is **B: Gbupụlata nwa isiokwu**.

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The text describes how ""overscan"" (where the edges of the picture are cut off) is common when converting a movie to a DVD. This happens because TVs often display content edge-to-edge, and the video needs to fill the screen. However, this can cut off important elements like subtitles.
* **The question:** The question asks how people can avoid the picture being cut off when watching a DVD.
* **Why B is correct:** Removing the ""nwa isiokwu"" (meaning the subject or main element) refers to removing the overscan.  By removing the overscan, the entire image, including subtitles, will be visible.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ihenlere na-ejughị ihu igwe onyonyo niile (The picture doesn't cover the whole screen):** This is a description of the problem, not a solution.
    * **C: Ihenlere na-asabasi ihe igwe onyonyo (The picture supports the video):** This is too vague and doesn't address the overscan issue.
    * **D: Gbupu akụkụ ihenlere gasị (Don't include the picture part):** This is nonsensical and wouldn't solve the problem.

Therefore, removing the overscan (the ""nwa isiokwu"") is the action that prevents the picture from being cut off.
"
Olee ebe e nwere garịsọn Britain?,"The correct answer is **A: Assunpink Creek**.

The passage states: ""Onye ọchịagha James Ewing ga-ewe ndị agha narị asaa n’ofe osimiri ahụ na Trenton Ferry, dọnara akwa mmiri ahụ n’ofe Assunpink Creek ma gbochie ndị agha onye iro ọ bụla ịgbalaga."" This directly indicates that a British garrison was located at Assunpink Creek.

While Trenton and Princeton are mentioned as locations of attacks, the garrison is specifically described as being at Assunpink Creek. Bodintan is where Washington defeated the British initially, but it's not mentioned as a garrison location in this passage.
"
Onye ka egosri mbinyeaka ya n'ime dụraftụ ejiri aka dee?,"The correct answer is **A: Jon Dunlap**.

The passage states: ""e weere ya n'akwụkwọ eji aka dee, nke Jọn Hankọk Onye isi Kọngres na Chals Tọmsin Onye odeakwụkwọ tinyere akara nkwado ha, wega ya n'ụlọ mbipụta Jọn Dunlap nke eteghi aka."" This indicates that John Dunlap was the printer who printed the Declaration of Independence.
"
"Na obodo ndị a, kedụ ebe Dunlapụ bịara ikpeazụ?","The correct answer is **C: London**.

The text states: ""Otu kọpị ruru Lọndọn n'Ọgọstụ 10."" (One copy reached London in August 10th.)
"
Kedụ ebe ndị agha Kọlọnelu Stark dị?,"The correct answer is **B: Na bichi n'akụkụ mmiri**.

The text states: ""Stark’s men positioned themselves on the bank on the side where the Colonist’s high ground was."" And later: ""Stark ordered a line of 100 sentry trees (30 m) ahead of the bombardment and instructed them not to move until approaching ships had passed."" This implies they were positioned along the water's edge.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ oge ụmụ nwoke Starkị jiri gbatịa fensi ha?","The correct answer is **B: Ka ndị omeihe gafere steki ahụ**.

The passage states: ""Mgbe ebili mmiri dị ala mepere oghere n'agịga mmiri Mistik n'agịga ugwu ọwụwa anyanwụ nke ala mmiri gbara ogige, ha mere ngwangwa ịgbatị mgbidi ahụ ruo n'ugwu kwụsị n'ọnụ mmiri.""  The next sentence says: ""Gridley ma ọ bụ Stark gwunyere otu osisi ọdịka ụzọukwu 100 (m 30) n’ihu mgbaaja ahụ **na nye iwu ka a ghara inwe onye ga-agbanu ruo mgbe ndị na-agafekarị ebe ahụ gafechara ya.**""

This indicates that they built the fence *after* the enemy had passed by. The purpose of the fence was to prevent further enemy passage.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n’okwu ndị a bukarịrị oge ọchịchị mkpagbu nke China?","The correct answer is **D: Oge Ọchịchị Alaeze Atọ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Oge ndị a nke a kacha mara amara bụ oge nke Alaeze Atọ... N'oge ndị a, a lụrụ ọtụtụ agha...""  This directly identifies the Three Kingdoms period as a time of great upheaval and war during the Chinese imperial history. The passage mentions Xi'an as the location of the emperor's palace, but the *period* itself is the Three Kingdoms period.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, gịnị bụ eziokwu nke kọlọni antị ndị agha banyere ịbanye usoro nọmadiki?","The correct answer is **C: Ha na-arụ ebe obibi ha na-agbanwe ma ọgafechaa mkpụrụ ụbọchị 17**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""N'oge ngagharị n'uto ha, ụmụ agbụsị na-agagharị n'abalị ma na-anọ otu ebe n'ụbọchị."" (During the migration, the nomads travel by day and stay in one place at night.)
* It also says: ""Òtù anụmanụ ahụ na-amalite usoro nwagharị mgbe nri dị adị gbadatara. N’oge usoro a, ò̀tù anụmanụ ahụ na-eme akwụ nwa oge nke a na-agbanwe kwa ụbọchị ruo abalị 17."" (The animal begins the migration cycle when food is depleted. During this cycle, the animal makes a journey that changes daily and lasts until the 17th day.)
* This indicates a nomadic lifestyle where they move and change their location, and this movement is tied to a 17-day cycle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha rụrụ ebe obibi n’abalị** (They settle in one place during the day) - The passage explicitly states they *don't* settle in one place during the day; they travel.
* **B: Ha nwere ntakịrị ụzọ ha si enweta nri** (They have many ways to obtain food) - The passage doesn't mention the number of food sources. It only mentions a migration cycle tied to food depletion.
* **D: Ha na-eme njem n’oge ehihie** (They travel in the evening) - The passage states they travel *by day*.

"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ezigbo edemede na-egosipụta agwa ebe obibi ndị kọlọni antị ndị agha n’oge usoro nọmadiki?","The correct answer is **C: Ha na-agbanwe ebe obibi kwa ụbọchị**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""N'oge ngagharị n'uto ha, ụmụ agbụsị na-agagharị n'abalị ma na-anọ otu ebe n'ụbọchị. Òtù anụmanụ ahụ na-amalite usoro nwagharị mgbe nri dị adị gbadatara. N’oge usoro a, ò̀tù anụmanụ ahụ na-eme akwụ nwa oge nke a na-agbanwe kwa ụbọchị.""

This clearly indicates that the nomadic ant colony changes its temporary dwelling place every day during the mating season. The other options are contradicted by the passage.
"
Olee n'ime ihe ndị a ga-adịgịde n'agbanyeghị ọbịbịa nke ndị nhazi otu ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Elekere bayolọjikul (Biological clock)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Usoro kwa-oge kwa-oge, nke n'abụghị nzaghachi nye ntụpenye kwa-oge keezi, ka edeturula maka ọtụtụ ihe dị ndụ , gụnyere nje bakterịa, fọngaị, akụmakụ na ụmụanụmanụ.""  This highlights that the biological clock operates independently of external cues (like the light/dark cycle).
* **The passage emphasizes:** ""...usoro a ga na-aga n'ihu ma asịgodị rịị na onweghi ihe ọzọ metụtara ya.""  This means the biological clock is self-sustaining.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Gburugburu mmebe ihe imeahụ (Developmental environment):** The developmental environment *does* influence the timing of certain developmental processes, although it doesn't directly *control* the biological clock.
    * **B: Ahịrịụda nkeoge (Circadian rhythm):** While related, circadian rhythms *are* responsive to environmental cues (light/dark cycles).  The passage explicitly contrasts these with the biological clock.
    * **D: Ahịrịụda nkeahụrụ (Hormonal rhythm):** Hormonal rhythms *are* often influenced by circadian rhythms and other external factors.

Therefore, the biological clock is the most independent of the factors listed and will continue functioning regardless of external influences.



"
Kedu okwu bụ nkọwa ndị mmadụ egosipụtara ọdịịche nke otu omume nzipụta?,"The correct answer is **D: Nzịpụta nwere ọtụtụ ụdị (Polymorphic expression)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for the term describing when individuals show different forms of the *same* phenotypic trait.** The definition of polymorphism given in the prompt directly links it to individuals exhibiting multiple forms of a specific trait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nzịpụta nwere otu ụdị (Monomorphic expression):** This is the *opposite* of what the question asks. Monomorphism means *one* form.
* **B: Ihe ndị dị ndụ (Living things):** This is too broad. While polymorphism can occur in living things, it doesn't describe the specific expression of a single trait.
* **C: Ụdị ihe gasị (Flowering varieties):** This is too specific and doesn't encompass the general concept of polymorphism. It focuses only on flowering.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ okwu ziri ezi maka ihe ndị dị ndụ nọ n’otu mpaghara?,"The correct answer is **D: Nzịpụta nwere ọtụtụ ụdị**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about populations in a habitat.** The passage defines polymorphism as populations showing multiple forms of a specific trait.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nzịpụta nwere otu ụdị (Population with one form):** This describes a *monomorphic* population, which is the opposite of polymorphism.
* **B: Ngụpụta ndị mmadụ (Human migration):** Migration can introduce new genes, but it doesn't directly determine whether a population is monomorphic or polymorphic.
* **C: Ụdị ihe gasị (Evolutionary species):** This is a term related to speciation (the formation of new species) and isn't directly related to polymorphism within a single population.



Therefore, a population exhibiting multiple forms (variations) of a trait is a definition of polymorphism."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a abụghị ihe ọmụmatụ nke ọrụ njem nlegharị anya dabere?,"The correct answer is **C: Ịga ebe ngosi iheochie nke sayensị**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ecotourism as travel based on observing nature and wildlife, often involving activities like birdwatching, hiking, and wildlife photography. 

* **A: Ịnọgide na mmirimwụda:**  While not explicitly mentioned, staying in eco-lodges within a natural environment aligns with the sustainable aspect of ecotourism.
* **B: Ịse foto ifuru ọhịa:** Wildlife photography is a core part of observing and appreciating nature within ecotourism.
* **C: Ịga ebe ngosi iheochie nke sayensị:** Museums of science are focused on human knowledge and history, not primarily on observing natural environments and wildlife.
* **D: Ife igbu azụ:**  This is not an activity associated with ecotourism; it's harmful to wildlife and the ecosystem.



Therefore, visiting a science museum is the option that doesn't fit the description of ecotourism.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ ihembido nke usoro ịga njem?","The correct answer is **B: Ụgbọ ala nkeonwe (Ship-based system)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""otu sistemụ njem dabere na ụgbọala nkeonwe"" which translates to ""a transportation system based on ship-based transportation."" This directly links the described transportation method to ships.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebe njedebe ụlọ ọrụ (Industrial destination):** While people are traveling *to* industrial destinations, the type of transportation mentioned is not directly tied to the destination itself.  It describes *how* they are traveling.
* **C: Bayosfee kwụsiri ike (Bayesian rigidity):**  This has nothing to do with transportation systems. It's a statistical concept.
* **D: Evolushọn mmadụ (Human evolution):**  While human evolution has impacted transportation over time, the passage is specifically talking about a current, ship-based system.



"
Ụmụ irighiri ihe ndị na-agba nukulus gburugburu kedu ụdị chaaji onwere?,"The correct answer is **C: Chaaji negetivi**.

The passage states: ""Elektrọn gasị nwere chaajị eletriki dị ọjọ."" (Electrons have a negative electric charge.)"
Kedụ irighịrị ihe mebere nukulus?,"The correct answer is **A: Purotọnụ na nuturọnụ (Protonu na neutronu)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Neuklọs ahụ bụ ahụ ihe abụọ mejupụtara ya - neutrọn na protọn."" (The nucleus is made up of two things - neutrons and protons.)"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime edemede ndị a bụ ihe ọmụmatụ nke nọmba bayịnarị biti nke ise?","The question asks us to identify which of the given options represents a five-bit binary number. A five-bit binary number consists of exactly five bits (0s and 1s). Let's examine each option:

*   **A: 1010** - This is a four-bit binary number.
*   **B: 12001** - This is not a binary number because it contains the digit '2' and '0' which are not allowed in binary.
*   **C: 10010** - This is a five-bit binary number.
*   **D: 110101** - This is a six-bit binary number.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{C}$"
Kedụ ihe ọzọ ana-akpọ dịgịtị bayịnarị?,"The correct answer is **A: Biti**.

The question states that a binary digit is the basic unit of information in a computer, represented by either 0 or 1. This is precisely what a ""bit"" is.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Valuu (Value):** While a bit represents a value (0 or 1), ""value"" is a much broader term and doesn't specifically refer to a binary digit.
* **C: Jaagọnụ (Code):**  ""Code"" refers to a system of rules, not a single unit of information.
* **D: Fọmụ (Form):** ""Form"" is too general and doesn't describe the fundamental unit of digital information.

Kedu n'ime ndepụta ndị a ka ana-ekwughị n'akụkụ akwụkwọ a dị ka isi uru nke ịdere ụmụ akwụkwọ blọgụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Mmata gbasara gburugburu ebe obibi**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that blogs help students ""to make it known to students what is happening around them"" and ""to encourage students to broaden their horizons."" This directly relates to gaining knowledge about the surrounding world.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkwalịte ụtọ asụsụ na ike odide** - While blogs *can* contribute to this, it's not presented as a primary or explicitly stated benefit in the text. The text focuses more on knowledge acquisition and communication.
* **B: Mwebelata nkatọ si n'aka ndị ọgbọ** - The text mentions blogs help students avoid embarrassment and encourages them to express themselves, but it doesn't specifically highlight blog usage as a way to avoid peer embarrassment.
* **D: Mmụba ọchịchọ maka ọganihụ mmụta** - While blogs *can* stimulate interest, the text doesn't directly state that they spark a desire for lifelong learning. It focuses more on immediate knowledge acquisition and expression.

The text explicitly states: ""site n'ịza ọsịsọ n'ụmụ ihe ịntaneetet, ụmụ akwụkwọ nwere ike ịkọwa ọnọdụ ha na nghọta nke ụmụ ederede ndị ọzọ ya na kwupụtachaa uche onwe ha n'ụmụ nsogbu pụrụ iche (Oravec, 2002)."" This directly refers to using blogs to explore and share ideas online.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Mmasị nke izere nkọcha:** While blogs can help avoid feeling isolated, that's not the primary way they promote writing skills.
* **C: Ịnwegide mmasị nke ndị na-ege ha ntị:** The text focuses on *creating* an audience through blogging, not just avoiding a lack of attention.
* **D: Ịhụta mkpa mmekọrịta:**  The text does mention the importance of communication, but the act of exploring online resources is a more specific and emphasized way blogs help with writing.

Olee na ndeputa ndị a na-abụghị uru mkparịtauka anaghị abịa otu mgbe maka ụmụ akwụkwọ? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ị were ịntanetị ka ọbụrụ ụzọenyemeakaọrụ** (Using the internet as a learning tool).

Here's why:

The passage states that the internet allows learners to access information anytime and to ask teachers questions at any time and receive replies, unlike face-to-face interaction. This highlights the benefit of the internet as a learning tool. Options B, C, and D are not mentioned as benefits of online learning in the passage."
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee na ndeputa anaghị abịa otu mgbe na adịghị ụmụ akwụkwọ mwegharị?","The correct answer is **D: Nrụọrụ ịntanetị (Internet Learning)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage discusses how the internet allows learners to access information anytime and encourages constant interaction with instructors.** This directly describes the characteristics of internet-based learning.
* **The passage highlights the flexibility of online learning, mentioning that students can ask questions at any time and expect prompt responses.** This is a key benefit of online learning.
* **The other options are not as directly related to the content of the passage:**
    * **Usoro ịmụta akwụkwọ (Learning Process):** This is too broad. While online learning *is* a learning process, the passage specifically focuses on the *internet* as the medium.
    * **Awa ịrụ ọrụ (Work Schedule):** This is about time management, which is touched upon in the passage, but isn't the central theme.
    * **Ihemmụta Ntụzịaka (Instructional Design):** This is related to *creating* learning experiences, not the *delivery* of learning, which the passage emphasizes with the internet.



"
Kedu ihe ndị ana-emetụghị aka na mpaghara akwụkwọ a dịka ihe mmadụ ihe mmadụ nwere ike jikọta ya na kastụlụ midivalụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Olulu dọnjịọn (Donjon)**.

Here's why:

* **Donjon:** The donjon was the central, strongest, and often tallest tower in a medieval castle. It served as a last refuge for the lord and his family during a siege. The text mentions castles being built to defend against enemies, and the donjon was the core of that defense.
* **Jọọstụ (Joust):** Jousting was a ceremonial sport, not a fundamental part of castle construction or defense.
* **Shivalrị (Chivalry):** Chivalry was a code of conduct for knights, not a structural element of a castle. While knights resided in castles, chivalry itself didn't dictate their building.
* **Naịtị (Armor):** Armor was worn by knights, not part of the castle's construction.

Therefore, the donjon is the element most directly linked to the defensive purpose of medieval castles, as mentioned in the text.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-emetụghị aka na mpaghara akwụkwọ dị ka ísì ma ọ bụ ụda nke nwere ike ịpụta n'agbata mkpoko kastụlụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ụjọ (Roaring)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the common perception of castles as symbols of power and defense, often associated with knights, battles, and sieges.  The question asks what *actually* influenced the design of castles.

*   **Ụjọ (Roaring/Sound of a crowd):** While a crowd's roar might have been present during sieges, it wasn't a primary design *influence* for castles themselves. The passage implies castles were built with more practical considerations in mind.

*   **Ọgụ (Battles):** Battles certainly *happened* at castles, but the design wasn't *influenced* *by* the battles themselves.  Castles were designed to *withstand* battles.

*   **Nri oriri (Feasting):** Feasting was a part of castle life, but again, it wasn't a primary driver of the architectural design.

*   **Ikitiukwu anụmanụ (Animal dung):** Animal dung would have been present around a castle, but not a factor in how the castle was built.

The passage suggests that the idealized image of castles is based on a romanticized view of the past. The actual reasons for building castles were more practical: defense, control of territory, and as residences for rulers.  The ""ụda ụkwụ ịnyịnya ma isi ụjọ si n'olulu ekuli"" (sound of horse hooves and the roar of crowds) are *impressions* we have, but not the *reason* they were built."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ nkọpụta ezie kpọmkwem nke Kastụlụ Kirby Muxloe?,"The correct answer is **D: A rụrụ ya iji nagide ogologo na mkpebi mwakpo di ike.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Windo ukwu ya e tere ihe na ahụaja ya tara ahụ ekwesịghị inwe ike igbochi otu mwakpo ekpebisiri ike ruo ogologo oge."" (Its large windows were designed to withstand a sustained attack for a long time.)
* It also mentions that the castle was built during a time of peace but with the intention of defending against potential attacks: ""obodo nọ n'udo ma sọ mgbachite onwe bụ n'imegide obere igwe ndị ohi."" (The town was peaceful, but it was built as a defense against small firearms.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Lọọdụ Hastings yọrọ wọlụ kastụlụ dị ike:** While Lord Hastings commissioned the castle, the text doesn't say he *needed* a powerful castle; it says it was built during a peaceful time as a *defense*.
* **B: Ọ chọrọ obere mkpụchi n'ihi ụdị udo obodo n’oge mwube ya:**  The text says the town was peaceful, but the castle's design wasn't about *minimizing* defenses; it was about *withstanding* attacks.
* **C: Mwube nke kastụlụ abụghị ihe na-adịkarị maka oge ahụ:** The text implies that the *design* of the castle was unusual for the time in terms of its large windows and defensive capabilities. However, option D is a more direct and accurate reflection of the text's main point about the castle's purpose.



"
Kedu n'ime atụmatụ ihe owuwu ndị a ka a ga-ewere dị ka Kastụlụ nke Kirby Muxloe n'oge akọwara n'akụkụ akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **A: Nnukwu windo**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the large windows of Kirby Muxloe were a weakness, making it vulnerable to prolonged sieges. This directly relates to its function as a castle (a defensive structure).
* The other options are not supported by the text:
    * **B: Ntọala wuru iji kwado ọgụ:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the foundations being designed for warfare.
    * **C: Obere mgbidi karịa ụfọdụ kastụlụ:** The passage implies the windows were a weakness, so the walls are not necessarily described as small.
    * **D: Wọlụ girigiri:** The passage doesn't mention a moat.



Therefore, the large windows are the feature explicitly mentioned as a relevant characteristic of the castle in the given text."
"Dika mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, kedu ihe kachasi uru maka ọgbaọsọ na-akwado mmemme na-abịa n’ihu?","The correct answer is **A: Ịmụ ịgbaọsọ ngafe obodo n’oge sọma (Training for road running in winter)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically states:** ""Ụfọdụ ịgba ọsọ n’ofe mba n’oge oyi, ejikọtara ya na ọrụ mgbatị ahụ maka akụkụ ahụ nke elu, bụ njikere kachasị mma maka oge agbamọsọ ahụ."" (Some road running in the cold, combined with upper body conditioning, is the best preparation for the difficult time.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ịkpachapụrụ anya mmụta ikeọsọ n’oge ọzụzụ (Developing a learning mindset during the morning):** While a good mindset is important, the passage doesn't directly link this to preparing for road running, especially in challenging conditions.
* **C: Ịnweta mmeri n’oge nkeji atọ (Achieving a three-minute victory):** The passage mentions a man who can run two minutes but struggles with longer distances. This option focuses on a short time frame and a specific result, which isn't the primary point of the passage.
* **D: Iji jim nkeọma n’ịrụ ọrụ nke elu ahụ (Using imagination in upper body work):**  While imaginative upper body work might be *part* of the preparation, the passage emphasizes *doing* the upper body conditioning in conjunction with running in cold weather.



Therefore, training for road running in the winter is the most directly supported answer from the passage.

"Ịsonyere mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee otu n’ime ihe ndi a dịkasiri mkpa maka ọgbaọsọ maịlị-ọkara klasị-iziz?","The correct answer is **A: Ịmụ ịgbaọsọ ngafe obodo n’oge ọnwa winta (Training for winter road running)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of a strong core and mental toughness for half-marathons, especially in challenging conditions.** The final sentence highlights the need for winter training and strength work.
* **Option A directly addresses the challenging conditions mentioned.** Winter road running requires specific preparation.
* **Options B, C, and D are not supported by the passage.**  The passage doesn't mention the importance of endurance training, achieving a specific time, or prioritizing speed over endurance.

Therefore, training specifically for the challenges of winter running aligns best with the overall message of the passage.

"Maka onye egwuregwu, olee n’ihe ndị a ka eneghị ike inweta naanị n’ihe oriri?","The correct answer is **B: Obi aṅụrị emelitara (Improved Morale)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""ọdịmma onye egwuregwu gburugburu."" (the well-being of the player).  The passage emphasizes that while skills aren't directly improved by food, it *can* impact the player's overall well-being.
* **The text mentions:** ""ịghọta ngalaba dị iche iche dị na mgbakwunye ihe oriri..."" (understanding the different nutrients in addition to food...). This suggests food contributes to aspects beyond just physical strength.  It implies a more holistic benefit.
* **Option B, Improved Morale, aligns with this.**  While physical strength (option A) is a likely outcome of food, ""improved morale"" fits with the idea of overall well-being and the broader impact on the player's enjoyment of the game.
* **Options C and D are less directly supported.** While food might indirectly contribute to strength (C) and overall performance (D), the text focuses more on the impact on well-being and the subtle ways food can improve gameplay.

Therefore, the passage suggests that the benefit of improved morale is something a player might not solely obtain from skills or equipment, but rather from the well-being aspect that food contributes to.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Idowe ọnọdụ ike nke dị ahụ mma, iñụ mmiri nke ọma, na ịghọta ngalaba dị iche iche dị na mgbakwunye ihe oriri..."" (Maintaining a good physical condition, drinking enough water, and understanding the different parts of the body in addition to exercise can help athletes improve their performance and also boost their morale in the game).
* **Option C directly aligns with this:** Drinking water ""n'otu dịmma"" (in moderation) is mentioned as a factor that contributes to both performance and morale.
* **Why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Ịna-eri oriri dịmma (Exercising moderately):** While exercise is important, the passage focuses on *how* to exercise (maintaining good form, drinking water) rather than just the act of exercising.
    * **B: Ịna-eme n’ikeọrụ onye ọmachancha kwa mgbe (Training with a coach frequently):**  The passage doesn't mention coaching frequency.
    * **D: Ịnwegide ikeonwe na-enweghị ọdịda (Resisting pressure without falling):** This option focuses on mental fortitude, which isn't directly mentioned as a benefit of exercise in the passage.

"Dika mpaghara akwụkwọ si kwuo, gịnị ka onye ọgbaọsọ nke etiti ji wee ike ịzụta igwe arụmọrụ dị ọnụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụ ihe nkeonwe ha ka mkpa (It depends on their personal needs)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the cost of equipment for swimming isn't fixed, and many items might not significantly improve performance. It also notes that athletes might be drawn to certain gear even if it offers no benefit.  Therefore, what an athlete *needs* will determine how much they are willing or able to spend. The passage doesn't provide a universal answer about what is necessary.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O nwere uru e gosiputara (It has proven benefits):** The passage implies that many pieces of equipment *don't* have proven benefits.
* **C: Ọ ga-enyere ha aka nke ukwuu n’ikeọrụ ha (It will greatly help their performance):** Again, the passage suggests this isn't always the case.
* **D: Ọ nwere ihe na abụghị ezi okwu banyere igwe arụmọrụ na adịghị ọnụ (It has both true and false statements about performance equipment and affordability):** While technically correct that there's a mix of truth and falsehood, option A is a more direct and accurate reflection of the passage's central point.



"
"Isonyere n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, kedu ịgba ọsọ ogo etiti chọrọ?","The correct answer is **B: Ntọala egwuregwu nwere mgbọrọgwu**

Here's why:

The passage states that while the sport itself isn't expensive, equipment costs are a concern. It also mentions that expensive equipment doesn't necessarily translate to better performance.  This implies that having a suitable and *stable* running surface (a track) is more important than fancy or costly equipment. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọtụtụ igweọrụ (Many devices):**  The passage specifically says expensive devices don't guarantee better results.
* **C: Igweọrụ dị oke nta (Very small devices):** The passage doesn't mention small devices. It focuses on the cost/performance relationship of running equipment.
* **D: Ọtụtụ ego (A lot of money):** The passage directly contradicts this, stating the sport is not inherently expensive.



"
Onye chọpụtara rezọnansi magnetiki? ,"The correct answer is **C: Blochị na Purcellu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""MRI dabeere na Nuklia Magnetik Rezonans (NMR) na fiziks, nke Felix Bloch (na-arụ ọrụ na Mahadum Stanford) na Edward Purcell (si na Mahadum Havad) chọpụtara n'afọ 1930...""  This directly indicates that Bloch and Purcell discovered the magnetic resonance.
"
Kedụ n’afọ enyere patenti izizi rezọnansị onyonyo ahụike? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Afọ anọ gachara e nyere otu patentị, nke bụ patentị mbụ n’ụwa enyere na fịịldị nke MRI. **N'afọ 1970**, Remond Damadian..."".  The question asks when the *initial* patent was granted, and the passage directly states it was in 1970. Therefore, this answer is the correct one.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ, olee ihe ndị mmadụ kwesịrị ike na iji kọwapụta omume ana-ahụ anya ndị ọzọ?","The correct answer is **D: Nghọta (Understanding)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of understanding others' intentions.  The core point is about being able to grasp *what others are thinking and feeling*.  

* **Understanding** directly relates to grasping the intentions, desires, and motivations of others.
* **Interest (Mmasị)** is a feeling, not a way to *describe* someone's intentions.
* **Excitement (Nzube)** is an emotion, not a method of understanding.
* **Belief (Nkwenye)** refers to something someone thinks is true, not how to interpret their actions.

Therefore, understanding is the most accurate way to describe the ability to decipher the intentions of others, as highlighted in the passage.



"
"Isonye ka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si kwu, olee ihe ịghọta ebumunuche na-enyere ndị mmadụ aka ime?","The correct answer is **D: Ị gụ uche ndị ọzọ (Understanding others' intentions)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ndị mmadụ bụ okike kachasị tozuo oke n'ịchọpụta ebumnuche ndị ọzọ. Nke a pụtara na anyị nwere ike ịkọ ihe ndị mmadu ọzọ na-ahụta, chọrọ ime, kweere, maara maọbu nwere mmasi na.""  This directly translates to understanding others' intentions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ị ji wepụ ihe amaghị ama dị n’omume ana-ahụ anya (Removing hidden things that are visible):** This isn't a core concept of understanding intentions.
* **B: I ji kwuo n’onwe ọchịchọ obi mmadụ (Speaking from one's own heart):** This refers to expressing oneself, not understanding others.
* **C: Ị hụ ndị ọzọ ndị ọzọ na-ekpeghị ikpe (Seeing others not speaking):**  This is an observation, but it doesn't equate to understanding *why* someone isn't speaking (their intentions).



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a bụ nchikọta ọma nke uru AI?","The correct answer is **C: Ị hazi oge**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that one of the tasks AI is used for is ""ịhàzi oge"" (scheduling). This is directly mentioned as a benefit of AI, enabling the automation of tasks that typically require human intelligence.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ị hazi ịhe** (Recognizing faces): While facial recognition *is* an application of AI, the passage doesn't highlight it as a primary *benefit* in the same way it does scheduling. It mentions it as an example of what AI can do.
*   **B: Ị chọpụta olu** (Speech recognition): Similar to facial recognition, speech recognition is an AI application mentioned, but not positioned as a core benefit.
*   **D: Ị rụ ọrụ na nkeonwe** (Working with the one-on-one): The passage doesn't mention AI being used for one-on-one interaction.

Therefore, **Ị hazi oge** is the most accurate and direct reflection of a benefit of AI as described in the text.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ, olee ihe ndị a na-ejikọtakarị na AI?","The correct answer is **B: Ị hazị ihe na ị hazị oge (Scheduling and forecasting)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ụmumatụ gụnyere njikwa, ịtụ arọ na ịhàzi oge..."" which translates to ""The skills include control, forecasting, and scheduling...""

While the other options are related to AI in general, they aren't specifically mentioned as skills *within the context of the text's description of AI's capabilities*.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime ihe ndị a bụ ike nke onye nwere ụdịdi echiche mgbakọ?","The correct answer is **A: Ịchọpụta ọtụtụ azịza nyere otu nsogbu.**

Here's why:

* **The text describes divergent thinking as a process of exploring multiple solutions to a problem.** It emphasizes generating many ideas before settling on one.
* **Option A directly reflects this core principle.**  ""Ịchọpụta ọtụtụ azịza nyere otu nsogbu"" means generating many different potential solutions to the same problem, which is the hallmark of divergent thinking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ị tinye n’ọrụ usoro ọhụrụ n’otu nsogbu:** This is more aligned with convergent thinking, which focuses on finding the *best* solution.
* **C: Ị weputa oge n’imezi nsogbu:** While reflection is important, the text doesn't primarily focus on time spent *analyzing* the problem; it's about generating ideas.
* **D: Ị nweta usoro ibu ihe n’uche:**  While divergent thinking *can* lead to novel ideas, the text doesn't explicitly state that it directly results in a comprehensive mental framework. The focus is more on generating a variety of solutions.



"
"Dika akụkụ akwụkwọ si kwu, kedu ihe enweghị usorouche ụdịdị echiche mgbakọ?","The correct answer is **A: Ịghọta na onwere naanị otu azịza ziri ezi**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Ihe kachasị mkpa n'ụdịrị echiche a bụ: enwere naanị otu ụsa. Sọọsọ ihe abụọ ị ga na-eche bụ: ọ bụ ya ka ọ bụghị ya.""  This means the core principle is believing there's one correct solution.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ị were oge mmadụ:**  While time might be a factor in problem-solving, it's not the defining characteristic of this specific type of thinking.
* **C: Ị chọpụta okwu ziri ezi:**  Identifying accurate information is important, but it's a supporting element, not the central tenet.
* **D: Ị kpokọta ozi:**  Gathering data is a part of the process, but the fundamental aspect is the belief in a single, correct answer.



"
"Ịsonyere na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee ihe agaghị anabata dịka okwu dị nta?","The passage discusses micro-expressions and their connection to deception. It mentions Oliver Sacks' work and how neurological conditions can affect the ability to recognize facial expressions, even leading to speech errors during communication. While the passage doesn't *directly* link specific eye movements to deception, it implies that subtle, involuntary movements (micro-expressions) can be revealing.

Considering the options:

*   **A: Ịna-elepu anya mgbe ana-ekwu okwu (Looking away while speaking)** - This *could* be a sign of deception or discomfort, aligning with the passage's theme.
*   **B: Ịna-akpali nku anya (Darting eyes)** - This is often associated with nervousness, anxiety, or deception - again, fitting the passage's context.
*   **C: Ịme nyụ anya ngwa ngwa (Rapid blinking)** - Rapid blinking can be a sign of stress or deception.
*   **D: Iweli isi mkpịsị aka elu (Raising hand index finger)** - This gesture usually signifies emphasis or conviction, not necessarily deception or micro-expressions.

Therefore, the least likely option to be linked to the core ideas of the passage is **D: Iweli isi mkpịsị aka elu (Raising hand index finger)**. It doesn't align with the focus on subtle, involuntary facial expressions.

So the answer is **D**.
"
Olee n’ime edemede a maka nkọwa okwu dị nta ziri ezi?,"The best answer is **D: Ọ nwere ike inye aka nyochaa ezi obi (It can help to assess truthfulness).**

Here's why:

* The passage focuses on how subtle facial movements, often imperceptible to humans, can be detected using video analysis.
* It specifically mentions Oliver Sacks' work, where individuals with neurological damage could reveal deception *while speaking* due to their inability to control facial expressions.
* The key takeaway is that this technology has the potential to help determine if someone is being truthful.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ihe ndekọ vidiyo ebutela ọganihu dị ukwuu (Video recording has made great progress):** While true, this is a very broad statement and not the central point of the passage.
* **B: Nkọwa ziri ezi nwere ike ịchọpụta ịgha ụgha (Accurate descriptions can identify lies):**  The passage doesn't say that *descriptions* are accurate; it's the *video analysis* that can reveal deception.
* **C: A tụgharịkwara okwu yana ọnọdụ ihu (Speech and facial expressions have also been turned):** The passage focuses *primarily* on facial expressions, with speech being a secondary factor in Sacks' case.



Therefore, option D most accurately reflects the main conclusion drawn from the passage about the potential use of this technology.



"
Olee n'ime ihe ndị a dị oke nweta uru karịa n'ihi Renayizansị? ,"The correct answer is **C: Nchetagharị edemede (Memory of texts)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Renaissance changed how people remembered things. Instead of relying on memorizing *people* speaking, the focus shifted to remembering *texts* that were written down.  This is a key shift highlighted in the text.
* Options A (Memory of people) and B (Public speaking) are presented as things that *declined* in importance during the Renaissance, not things that gained significant value.
* Option D (Dissemination of information) is a consequence of the change in memory practices, but the core *shift* itself is the increased importance of remembering texts.

Therefore, **Nchetagharị edemede (Memory of texts)** is the best answer as it directly reflects the central point of the passage regarding the impact of the Renaissance on learning and knowledge transmission.



"
"N'ihi nke Renayizansi, olee ihe emetụtara obere aka n’ime ya?","The correct answer is **C: Nchetagharị edemede (Memorization of texts)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Renaissance changed how people memorized things.  Instead of memorizing *what* someone said, people focused on memorizing *texts* that had been written down.
* The passage connects this shift to the spread of knowledge (""agbasa ozi n’uzo puru iche""), which is directly linked to the memorization of texts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nchetagharị mmadụ (Memorization of people):** The passage *contrasts* this with the new method, implying it's no longer the primary focus.
* **B: Ịnweta amamihe (Access to enlightenment):**  While access to enlightenment *increased* during the Renaissance, the passage is specifically about *how* knowledge was learned and remembered.
* **D: Nkesa ozi (Dissemination of news):**  While the Renaissance facilitated the dissemination of news, the passage focuses on the *method* of learning and remembering – specifically, the shift to memorizing written texts.



"
Olee ihe na-egosiputaghi mkpalite ịji intaneeti maka mmekọrita na-aga n’ihu?,"The answer is **B: Ya na ezinulọ ịnọkọ (Staying in touch with family)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""communication"" and ""collaboration"" are key aspects of internet usage.  While the other options *can* be facilitated by the internet, staying in touch with family is a very common and fundamental use of the internet that directly relates to the concepts of communication and maintaining relationships. The passage highlights the ongoing nature of these interactions.
"
Olee ihe na-egosipụtaghị mkpalite iji ịntanetị maka ntinye aka nkeonwe?,"The correct answer is **A: Ị le anya n’usoro** (Browsing the web).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the unique aspects of the internet that facilitate **social interaction and communication** – specifically mentioning ""learning"" and ""collaboration"" as key aspects. It also highlights ""interaction"" and ""communication"" as important for online usage.

Let's look at why the other options *do* fit:

*   **B: Ịziga ozi n’ogwe mkpakọrita ụka n’intaneeti** (Sending emails via instant messaging) - This is a direct form of communication and interaction.
*   **C: Ịme nchọpụta ngwaahịa njikwa ahụike** (Searching for healthcare product information) - While seemingly transactional, this can involve seeking information and potentially connecting with others who have similar health concerns or experiences, thus implying a degree of interaction.
*   **D: Ịlekwata ihe akụ na ụba** (Analyzing financial data) - Even this can lead to discussions, sharing of insights, and collaboration with others interested in finance.

**Browsing the web** is largely a passive activity. While you *can* find information that sparks conversation, the act of browsing itself doesn't inherently involve direct interaction with other people. It's more about consuming information than engaging with others. Therefore, it doesn't fit the theme of ""social interaction and communication"" emphasized in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""na njedebe nke oge Mịdụl Eeji ndị ọdịda anyanwụ Europe malitere mepụtawa usoro nke ha.""  It also mentions that the Byzantine style declined for about 25-30 years.  Therefore, the transition to independent European styles happened roughly around the end of the 11th century.
"
Olee ihe kpatara iji bọtịnụ ekechido uwe? ,"The correct answer is **D: N’Oge Afọ Nke Etiti**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Otu ihe mmepụta kachasi mkpa n'oge ahụ, n'ihi ọgụ aghara, ndị mmadụ bidoro iji bọtịnụ akpọchị akwa.""  This translates to ""One of the most important inventions at that time, due to the chaos of the warring states, people began to use buttons to fasten clothes."" The ""that time"" refers to the period of the late Middle Ages, which is the time period referred to as ""N’Oge Afọ Nke Etiti"" (In the Late Years) in the options.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oge Gotiki (Gothic Era):** While the Gothic period is mentioned as the time when the *name* ""Gothic"" became popular, it doesn't explain *why* buttons were invented.
*   **B: Mgbe ọchịchị Bayizantin (During the Byzantine Empire):** The text says buttons emerged *after* the decline of Byzantine influence in Western Europe.
*   **C: Nnukwu Ọgbakọ Ekpere (Great Schism):** The Great Schism (split in the Christian church) is historically significant but isn't linked to the invention of buttons in the provided text.

"Isonyere na mpaghara akwụkwọ, gịni n’ime ihe ndịa ka anabatara dika ihe ngwọta nwere ogologo oge maka nsogbu gburugburu ebe obibi?","The correct answer is **C: Ịmata ihe kpatara nsogbu ihe ahụ (Identifying the causes of the environmental problems)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that simply feeling sorry (idi n'enyi) isn't enough.  It argues that we need to **find the root causes** of the environmental issues to effectively address them.  The passage states, ""...ọ mere anyị kwesịrị ịchọta isi ihe kpatara nsogbu ndị ahụ, ma anyị kwesịrị iwepụ̀ ike ha."" ( ...therefore we should seek the causes of these problems, and we should eliminate them.)

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ịkwụsị nhọrọ ibi ndụ okomoko (Stopping the choice of consuming meat):** While reducing meat consumption can have positive impacts, the passage argues for a broader approach of identifying *all* causes.
*   **B: Iheomume (Technological advancements):** Technology can help, but the passage suggests that technology alone is not the solution. It emphasizes understanding the underlying problems first.
*   **D: Ịbụ onye nkwado otu ịnvirọmentalụ (Being a supporter of an environmental organization):** Supporting organizations is helpful, but the passage focuses on individual action and understanding the issues.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the need to identify and address the root causes of environmental problems, not just the symptoms.** It states, ""...if we don't just want the relief of the symptoms, then we should find the causes of these problems and eliminate them.""
* **Option B directly reflects this emphasis.** ""Ịwela isi ọnọdụ kpatara ihe ahụ"" translates to ""Identifying the root causes of the problem.""
* **The other options are less aligned with the passage's main point:**
    * **A: Ịsonye n’iheomume** (Joining movements) - While helpful, it's not the core solution the passage highlights.
    * **C: Ịkwupụta echicheobi maka nhọrọ ụdị ndụ** (Proposing ideas for lifestyle choices) - Lifestyle choices can contribute, but the passage prioritizes addressing underlying causes.
    * **D: Inọ ndụ na gburugburu ebe obibi n’usoro ịme obi ụtọ** (Living in harmony with nature in a joyful way) - This is a positive aspiration but doesn't address the fundamental problem of environmental damage.



Therefore, the passage strongly suggests that finding and fixing the underlying causes is key to effectively healing environmental problems.

"
Olee agha ana-akọwpụta dịka ‘agha okpukpechi’ ikpeazụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Agha Afọ Iri Atọ (The Thirty Years' War)**.

"
Olee n’ime mpaghara usoro ihe nke Chọọchị Katọlik ka a na-enyochabeghị?,"The correct answer is **C: Ntụkwasịobi nke ike n'ime Chọọchị.**

Here's why:

The text discusses the power and wealth of the Catholic Church, particularly the Church in Rome. It highlights the tension surrounding the Church's adherence to its own principles of poverty and detachment from worldly possessions, especially considering its vast wealth and influence.  This inherent contradiction – powerful and wealthy yet preaching poverty – creates a significant area of scrutiny and questioning.  Therefore, the struggle with the distribution and management of power *within* the Church is a key aspect that is often questioned.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ma ọ bụrụ ike akụ na ụba dị n'ime Chọọchị ziri ezi:** While the text acknowledges the Church's wealth, the question is not simply about the existence of wealth but about the *justification* and *consistency* of the Church's principles regarding wealth.
* **B: Ma ọbụrụ na aga-edeziwu isi usoro okpukpechi:** The text doesn't discuss reforming religious practices.
* **D: Ma ọ bụrụ na enwetara isi usoro nke Chọọchị:** The question is about areas of scrutiny, and the text focuses on the *potential* for questioning the Church's principles, not the achievement of certain milestones.

The passage states: ""N'otu mgbe otu n'ime ndị igwe mmadụ fegharịrị isi onye nche eze egburu na Versailles..."" which translates to ""At that moment, one of the guards turned and beheaded the royal officer in Versailles...""
"
Olee ihe ndị a ka ndị obuọgbaghara a na-akwanyeghị Eze na Ezenwanyị mee?,"The correct answer is **C: Nlele igbupụ isi nke onyenche**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...one of the soldiers turned the head of the statue of the king that was in front of the queen in rage."" 
* **Option C directly reflects this action.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmeghe windo nke obungwongwo ha** - The passage states the crowd *demanded* the King and Queen open their window, not that they did it themselves.
* **B: Ị site na Vasaillisi pụọ na mberede** - The passage describes their arrival *in* Paris, not leaving Versailles.
* **D: Njem ịlaghachi azụ na Paris** - The passage explicitly states they *returned* to Paris.



"
Olee ihe mere n'ime edemede a na-abụghị maka agha ụgbọ mmiri enweghi isi nke Britain?,"The correct answer is **D: Enwetaghị ihe gasị dị mkpa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Britain's actions to block German aid and the international law violations involved.** Options A, B, and C all directly relate to the actions described:
    * **A: Ebumuche Germani iso ụzọ agha nke amara** (Germany followed the same warfare approach) - This is implied as the reason for Britain's actions.
    * **B: Ụgbọ mmiri na-esoghi ka etinyere na nsogbu** (Ships were placed in danger) - This describes the consequence of Britain's blockade.
    * **C: A gbanwere iwu mba ụwa** (International law was changed) -  The passage explicitly states that the blockade violated established international law.

* **D: Enwetaghị ihe gasị dị mkpa** (Didn't receive necessary supplies) - This is *not* mentioned in the passage. The passage focuses on the *blockade* and its impact, not on whether Germany received supplies.



Therefore, the statement that is *not* mentioned in the passage regarding Britain's naval war is ""Didn't receive necessary supplies"".



"
Kedụ edemede na-akọwaghị mgbochi navelu Britain gbochiri Germani?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọ kpatara mwelata aka n’ibubata ihe nke Germani** (It caused Germany to retaliate by unrestricted submarine warfare).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ebe nzaghachi ihe omume a pere mpe, mba Jamini lere anya na a ga emekwa otu ihe n'ebe agha okpuru mmiri nọ.""  This translates to ""In response to this situation, Germany looked to do the same in the naval sphere.""  This directly indicates that Britain's blockade *caused* Germany to retaliate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O megidere iwu mba ụwa:** The passage mentions the blockade violated international law, but this isn't the *primary* thing the passage doesn't discuss. It focuses more on the consequences.
* **B: Ọ bụ ihe kpalitere agha sọbụmarini nke Germani:** The passage *directly* states this consequence.
* **D: Ọ gbara mbọ ịhụ n’onweghị ihe mere ndị ụgbọ mmiri nọrọ onwe ha:** The passage details the blockade was designed to prevent ships from entering, not to ensure they remained adrift.



Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects a consequence of Britain's blockade that the passage *doesn't* explicitly discuss. The passage focuses on the British blockade and the German reaction to it, without delving into the specifics of how it led to retaliatory actions.

"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, onye ka enwere ike ịchoputa Ọtụtu Cerosisi?","The correct answer is **A: Nwanyị dị afọ 32**.

Here's why:

The passage states that women are twice as likely to get MS as men. The question asks who *could* develop MS, and the provided age and gender combination that aligns with this higher prevalence in women is a 32-year-old woman.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, gịni ka ndị mmemekarị chokariri na nkwado?","The correct answer is **D: Ụjọ (Fear)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the study found **fear** (ịda mba) and anxiety (ụjọ) were present, not just pain.  It further clarifies that this fear wasn't about the pain itself but about anticipating more pain due to the perceived buildup of damage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Echiche na-adịghị mma maka ihemgbu (Negative thoughts about the image):** While negative thoughts *can* contribute to pain perception, the passage directly identifies *fear* as a key finding.
* **B: Azụ dị ala (Low back):** This is a location, not an emotion or psychological state.
* **C: Obi ịju oyi (Depression):** While depression can be associated with chronic pain, the passage focuses specifically on fear and anxiety related to the pain experience.



"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ka esi egwu egwuri egwu fencim?","The best answer is **D: N’usoro duelu**. 

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""A na-egwu egwuregwu ahụ n’isimbụ na nhazi nke asọmpi mmadụ abụọ, otu onye egwuregwu ọgụ mma na-alụsị anye ọzọ.""  This directly describes a duel, which is a one-on-one competition.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: N'ụzọ usoro ọhụrụ:** While modern fencing exists, the passage focuses on the fundamental setup of a match.
* **B: N'ogo mahadum:**  The passage mentions university students, but it's not the core description of *how* the game is played.
* **C: N'ogo Olympiki:** The passage mentions Olympic competitions, but it doesn't describe the fundamental gameplay.

Therefore, ""N'usoro duelu"" (in a duel format) is the most accurate and direct answer based on the provided text.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ nnukwu ga-egosiputa nsi imeahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ọgbụgbọ na ọsụsọ (Shoulder and arm)**.

"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe izizi nọ n’usoro aga eme mgbe a na-eleta onye e merụrụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Lelee ọnọdụ ebe ihe mere**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""Tupu ị gaa lelee onye e merụrụ, ị ga-ebu ụzọ nyochaa gburugburu ebe ihe mere iji hụ maka nchekwa gị.""  This directly translates to ""Before you go to see the injured person, you should first check the surroundings to ensure your safety.""

Therefore, assessing the situation where the incident occurred is the first step.

Here's why the other options are less appropriate:

* **B: Biakwute onye ihe metụtara (Comfort the injured person):** While important, this comes *after* assessing the safety of the environment.  Prioritizing safety first prevents further harm to both yourself and the injured person.
* **C: Tụlee ọnọdụ onye ihe metụtara (Assess the injured person's condition):**  You need to understand the environment *before* approaching and assessing the victim.  Approaching in an unsafe environment could worsen the situation.
* **D: Chere maka enyemeaka (Prepare for assistance):** Preparation is important, but it follows the initial safety assessment and assessment of the victim's condition.



"
Kedụ edemede na-akwaghị kpọmkwem usoro eji eleta onye ihe metụtara?,"The correct answer is **A: Leghara anya n’ihe n’ụjọ inweta mmerụ ahụ nke gị**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the importance of assessing the surroundings for safety *before* approaching the injured person. Option A suggests ignoring the details of the injury itself, which is the *opposite* of what the passage advises. The passage emphasizes understanding the situation and potential dangers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tulee ebe ihe mere tupu onye ihe mere:** This aligns with the passage's recommendation to assess the surroundings.
* **C: Lelee ọnọdụ onye ihe mere:** The passage explicitly states the need to understand the injured person's condition.
* **D: Gbalịa ịhụ ma onwere fụlagị redi ọbụla:**  This is a safety measure and aligns with the passage's emphasis on personal safety.

Therefore, option A is the only one that contradicts the instructions given in the passage.

This refers to a shift in power from the established classes (nobility) to those at the bottom (the common people/those who are most ambitious and successful).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Nkwalite nkwado maka obodo:** While the revolution did foster a sense of community, the text's main point about the revolution's impact on citizens is the shift in power dynamics.
* **C: Nnabata omenala ndị Republikanụ:** The text mentions the revolution helped other countries start their own revolutions, but it doesn't directly address the adoption of Republican ideals *by* the French people.
* **D: Sistemu nmekwa nha ọhụrụ:** The text doesn't discuss any new economic systems implemented during the revolution.



"
"Ịsonyere na Frenchi Revolushọnụ, kedụ ihe ọganihu ndị agha na ọrụ ndị ọzọ na-adịkarichaghị mkpa?","The correct answer is **C: Ebumnobi (Purpose)**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes the French Revolution as a significant shift towards a more participatory form of government, moving from rule by one person to rule by the nation. It highlights the principle of popular sovereignty – that power resides in the people.  The text also mentions the revolution's encouragement of individuals based on merit rather than birthright.

Therefore, a key advancement of the French Revolution was the emphasis on **purpose** – a national purpose driven by the people, not the whims of a single ruler or aristocracy. This is reflected in the idea of a nation acting together to achieve its goals.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ihemweta (Tradition):** The Revolution actively *rejected* tradition and inherited power.
*   **B: Kụlasị (Stability):** The Revolution was a period of significant *instability* and upheaval, not stability.
*   **D: Mkpalite (Prosperity):** While the Revolution aimed for a better future, the text doesn't specifically focus on economic prosperity as its primary advancement. The focus is more on political and social change.



"
Olee ọrụ bu enweghị ihe n’obodo ndị mepere emepe?,"Let's break this down. The question is about the reason for the frequent failures of the flood control system in open cities, specifically concerning water level and water-carrying pipelines. It highlights the issue of frequent bursts.

The question about the role of something lacking in open cities is asking what is *missing* that would be crucial for flood control.

Considering this, the best answer is **B: Mmebe ogwe mmiri (Pipeline maintenance)**.

Here's why:

* **Frequent bursts point to a maintenance issue.** If the pipelines are not properly maintained, they are much more likely to leak, burst, or fail. This directly addresses the core problem described in the initial question.
* **Water type (A) is irrelevant.** The *type* of water doesn't cause pipeline failures.
* **Flood control ships (C) are a solution, not a missing element.** While helpful, ships don't prevent the initial failure of the system.
* **Education (D) is important, but not a direct component of a functioning flood control system.**  Education might help prevent damage caused by floods, but it doesn't directly address why the system itself is failing.



Therefore, the most logical answer is **B: Mmebe ogwe mmiri (Pipeline maintenance)**.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, gịnị ka enwere ike maka sistemu ime njem ọha?","Let's break down the question and the options.

**Understanding the Problem**

The question describes a situation where a large number of people are complaining about the performance of a transportation system, specifically focusing on water levels and water damage. The key is the frequency and the perceived incompetence of the transportation engineers.  The question implies a systemic problem, not just individual failures.

**Analyzing the Options**

* **A: Onye ọbụla na-eji hụrụ ha n’anya (Everyone loves them):** This is the *opposite* of what the question describes.  The question emphasizes widespread complaints.
* **B: Anaghị atụnyere njọ ka ụdị mmiri (They don't apologize for the water damage):**  While the system *might* not apologize, that doesn't explain *why* the problems are happening.  It's a reactive statement, not a cause.
* **C: Ha na-akpatara onye na-eji ha ọtụtụ mkpesa (They cause users to make many complaints):** This is the *most likely* answer.  The question states that people are *already* making many complaints. The transportation system's performance is the *cause* of the complaints, not the other way around. The engineers might be failing to address the root cause, leading to ongoing complaints.
* **D: Ha na-enweta mwereonwe n'ọtụtụ obodo mepere empere (They get revenue in many open markets):** Revenue generation doesn't explain the performance problems.  A system can be profitable but still poorly run.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: Ha na-akpatara onye na-eji ha ọtụtụ mkpesa (They cause users to make many complaints).**

The question highlights a disconnect between the system's performance and user satisfaction, with the system's flaws driving the complaints.
"
"Ịsonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee ihe nwere ike sie ike ntule maka enweghị usoro kwesiri ekwesi nke ndị ọkwọ ụgbọala?","The correct answer is **D: Usoro Tụrafiki (Traffic Flow)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ọwụwụụ trafik bụ ọmụmụ nke ngagharị nke onye ọkwụ ụgbọ ọ bụla na ụgbọ ha n'etiti akara abụọ na mmekọrịta ha na-eme n'etiti onwe ha.""  This implies that traffic flow is *dependent* on the sequence of actions and interactions between drivers. Without a predictable flow (a sequence), it becomes difficult to analyze and model traffic patterns.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Tụrafiki Velọciti (Traffic Velocity):** While velocity is *part* of traffic flow, the passage highlights the *sequence* of events as the core difficulty. Velocity is a result of the flow, not the primary challenge in its absence.
* **B: Nhazi okporo ụzọ (Road Layout):** The passage mentions road layout as one of the key features used to analyze traffic (along with speed and density). While road layout influences traffic, the fundamental difficulty is with the *drivers' behavior* in that layout, without a defined sequence.
* **C: Ọrụ okporo ụzọ gasị (Gas Station Function):** The passage doesn't mention gas stations at all. This option is irrelevant.



Therefore, the inability to establish a traffic sequence is the most difficult aspect when analyzing traffic flow, according to the provided text.



"
Kedụ n’ime ihe ndị edesitara bụ nkọwa kachamma mgbe eji strimu matịmatiksi egosipụta tụrafiki?,"The correct answer is **D: Densiti tụrafiki (Traffic density)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Iji ka mma na-anọchi anya ije nke okporo ụzọ, E mebewo mmekọrịta n'etiti isi njirimara atọ ahụ: (1) eruba, (2) njupụta, na (3) ike ọsọ.""  and  ""Nmetụta ndị a na-enyere aka n’ime atụmatụ, ncheremee, na arụmọrụ akụrụngwa okporo ụzọ ụgbọ ígwè.""
* **The passage then defines traffic density as one of those key characteristics:** ""densiti tụrafiki"" is listed as one of the three key characteristics used to analyze traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọrụ okporo ụzọ gasị (Gas station operation):** The passage focuses on traffic flow *on roads*, not gas stations.
* **B: Agwa onye ọkwọ ụgbọ ala (Driver's speed):** While speed *is* a factor, the passage uses ""ike ọsọ"" (speed power/capacity) which is a broader concept than just the driver's speed. Density is a more fundamental measure of traffic.
* **C: Mmebe okporo ụzọ (Road width):** Road width is a characteristic of the *road itself*, not a measure of traffic flow.



"
Kedụ ihe Hershey na Chase jiri tinye DNA ha? ,"The correct answer is **A: Redioactivu phosphorusu**.

Here's why:

* **The experiment:** Hershey and Chase wanted to determine whether DNA or protein was the genetic material. They used bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria).
* **The labeling:** They labeled the DNA of some phages with radioactive phosphorus and the protein of other phages with radioactive sulfur.
* **The result:** They found that the radioactive phosphorus (attached to DNA) ended up *inside* the bacterial cells, while the radioactive sulfur (attached to protein) mostly stayed outside.  This showed that DNA, not protein, was the genetic material being injected into the bacteria.

Therefore, they used **radioactive phosphorus** to label the DNA.
"
Kedụ ihe Ikike nke muteshọnụ na-agafere nwa dabere?,"The best answer is **B: Ngosipụta nke arụmọrụ genetiki**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on genetic mutations affecting germline cells.** Germline cells are those that produce sperm and egg, meaning mutations in these cells can be passed down to future generations.
* **The question asks about the inheritance of mutations in a child.** This directly relates to the passing down of genetic information, which is the core of heredity.
* **Option B, ""Ngosipụta nke arụmọrụ genetiki,""** refers to the manifestation of the genetic makeup, including mutations, that a child inherits.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ma ọbụrụ na mkpụrụndụ dị n’usoro nje:** While mutations can occur in somatic (non-germline) cells, the passage highlights the impact of germline mutations on future generations.
* **C: Ụdị muteshọnụ:**  Simply stating the *type* of mutation doesn't explain *how* it's inherited.  The inheritance pattern is determined by whether the mutation is in germline or somatic cells.
* **D: Ma ọ bụrụ na muteshọnụ nwere ike ịkpata ọnwụ celu:**  The passage mentions potential death and cancer, but this is a consequence of some mutations, not the basis for inheritance.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text.



"
"Na ịdabere n’ozi dị n’edemede a, kedụ ọtụtụ ihe muteshọnụ kpatara na-adabereghị na ya?","The correct answer is **D: Ụdị muteshọnụ emetụtara**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the effects of mutations vary depending on the *type of mutation* and whether the affected genes are germline or somatic. The question asks what the passage suggests influences the severity of a mutation's impact. The passage directly links the impact to the ""type of mutation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ihe ole arụmọrụ genetiki metụtara (How many genes are affected):** The passage doesn't mention the number of genes involved.
* **B: Ma ọbụrụ na celu emetụtara dị n’usoro nje (Whether the mutation is in a non-coding region):** While the passage *does* mention germline vs. somatic mutations, it doesn't specifically focus on whether the mutation is in a coding or non-coding region.
* **C: Ngosipụta ihe ndị arụmọrụ genetiki metụtara (Expression of the affected genes):** The passage doesn't discuss gene expression.



Therefore, the passage emphasizes the **type of mutation** as a key determinant of its consequences.



"
Olee n'ime ihe ndị a akpataghị mere ndị mgbe ochie ji na-edebe ewu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha na-emekọrịta mmekọ** (They fostered relationships).

Here's why:

The passage states the ancient cultures preserved sheep for various practical uses: wool, meat, hides, and gas. It also describes how they were raised by shepherds in mountain villages or pastures. The options A, B, and D (providing meat, aiding in pasture management, and providing water) are all explicitly mentioned as reasons for raising sheep.

The passage **does not** mention that they raised sheep to foster relationships. Therefore, C is the correct answer.
"
Kedụ ihe kacha nta bụ echicheobi nke gọlfụ iwere?,"The correct answer is **B: Stoku gasị**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Onye okpukpo piara ntakiri stroku ma obu fere klob obere karia mgbe o na agaghari n’ebe egwuregwu bu onye meririnu."" This translates to ""The player takes a straight stroke or a short chip when the ball is not in the winning area."" 

Therefore, the minimum thought a golfer would have is about a **stroke** (or swing).
"
"N’ọzụzụ gọlfụ, ebee ka ogbu ahịhịa dịtụrụ obere?","The correct answer is **A: N’oghere nke iri na asatọ**.

The passage states: ""A na-egwu oghere iri na-asato na egwuregwu nkiti, ndi egwuregwu n’ebidokari na oghere nke mbu na koosu were mechie na nke iri na-asato."" This translates to ""The game is played on a course of eighteen holes, and players compete on the first and last holes, which are closed, and the eighteen holes.""  Therefore, the flag is located in hole number 18.
"
Olee ihe ziri ezi eji eme eksperimenti?,"The correct answer is **A: Ka ewere wepu otu ma ọ bụ ọtụtụ hiyipotesisi**

Here's why:

The passage states that an experiment is ""otu ule nke eji ewepụ otu haịpotesis kwere omume ma ọ bụ karịa."" This translates to ""a test used to test one or more hypotheses."" Therefore, the primary purpose of an experiment is to test hypotheses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ka ewere mata ka usoro ụwa n’ ịrụ ọrụ:** While understanding how the world works is the ultimate goal of science, an experiment specifically focuses on testing hypotheses, not understanding the entire world.
*   **C: Ka ewere kwado ajụjụ:** Experiments don't *support* a question; they aim to *test* a hypothesis that *addresses* a question.
*   **D: Ka ewere gbaziere nchọpụta sayensị:** Experiments are a *part* of the scientific investigation process, not the entire process itself.




"
"N’isonye n’akụkụ akwụkwọ, olee na anaghị enye aka ịgbaziri nchọputa sayensị?","The correct answer is **B: Ịna-ele ihe na-eme** (Simply observing what is happening).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the scientific method as a structured process.** It involves a series of steps, not just passive observation.
* **The scientific method includes:**
    * Formulating a hypothesis
    * Asking questions
    * Conducting experiments
    * Analyzing data
* **Simply observing is a starting point, but it doesn't constitute the scientific method.** It lacks the crucial elements of hypothesis formation, experimentation, and analysis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Usoro sayensị (The scientific method):** This is the core of the passage's description.
* **C: Ịna-ewepu hiyipotesisi nwere ike ịdị (Formulating testable hypotheses):**  Formulating a hypothesis is a key step in the scientific method.
* **D: Ịna-ahazị eksperimenti (Designing experiments):** Designing and conducting experiments are central to scientific investigation.



Therefore, simply observing doesn't actively contribute to scientific inquiry as defined in the passage."
"Isonye ka esi dee ya na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee edemede banyere tonadọsụ na-abụghị eziokwu?","The correct answer is **B: Tonadọsụ na-emebi dị nta karịa oke ikuku ndị ọzọ.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ajọ ifufe Tonedo na-efetu obere ebe ma ịtụnyere ya na ajọọ ifufe ndị ọzọ, mana ha nwere ike imebi ihe niile nọ n’ụzọ ha.""  This means tornadoes *can* cause significant damage, not just ""dị nta.""  The passage then details the extent of the damage tornadoes can inflict.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tonadọsụ nwere ikikere ịmebi ihe dum nọ ya nso:**  The passage states they *can* destroy everything in their path, indicating a high destructive potential, not a limit.
* **C: Ọtụtụ tonadọsụ na-eme ihe karịrị awa atọ:** The passage specifies the most severe tornadoes last *more than* three hours, not that many do.
* **D: Ụfọdụ tonadọsụ nwere ikikere inwe ikuku ruru maịlị 300 kwa awa:** The passage says the wind speed can reach 480 kilometers per hour (133 miles per *minute*), not miles per hour.  And it doesn't say some tornadoes have a limit; it describes the maximum possible speed.



"
"Na ịdabanyere na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime edemede ndị a kọwara nke ọma ọtụtụ ihe gbasara tonadọsụ?","The best answer is **C: Ha na-emebi ebe dị ukwuu karịa oke ikuku ndị ọzọ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ajọ ifufe na efolite osisi, tirie ulo, ma felie ụgbọala n'ime igwe."" This demonstrates the widespread destruction tornadoes cause.
* **A is true, but incomplete:** While tornadoes *can* last over three hours, the passage emphasizes their destructive power *regardless* of duration.
* **B is true, but also incomplete:**  The passage mentions the wind speed, but the main point is the damage caused.
* **D is partially true but not the core point:** While tornadoes *can* damage trees and structures, the passage highlights the *extent* of the destruction as the key characteristic.

Option C best encapsulates the overall message of the passage regarding tornadoes: they are incredibly destructive.



"
Kedụ n’ime ihe ndịa ka ndị mmadụ bidoro ịme na narị afọ nke 16?,"The correct answer is **B: I na-emelite ọbjektị**.

Here's why:

The question asks what people started doing in the 16th century regarding telescopes. The passage states that the first telescopes were developed in Europe at the end of the 16th century and were made with two lenses. This implies that people were starting to *improve* or *refine* existing designs. ""Emelite ọbjektị"" (to refine objects) best fits this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: I na-enyị enyoanya** (You are framing/encasing): This is not directly related to the development of telescopes.
*   **C: Ị na-emebe enyoanya** (You are moving the frame): This refers to physically moving a telescope, not improving its design.
*   **D: Ị na-emebe teliskopu** (You are making telescopes): While telescopes were being made, the question asks what *new* thing people started *doing* with them, implying refinement or improvement.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **B**.



"
Kwuo oge ole ndị mmadụ nọ na-eji enyoanya emelite ọbjekti?,"The correct answer is **C: Ruo ọtụtụ puku afọ**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that people have been using magnifying glasses for ""many centuries."" 
* The first telescopes were developed in Europe towards the end of the 16th century.
* This indicates that the use of magnifying glasses (a precursor to telescopes) was happening for a long time *before* the telescope was invented, meaning ""many centuries.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ruo otu puku afọ** - This is too short a timeframe.
* **B: Kamgbe na ngwụsị narị afọ nke 16** - This is only when telescopes *started* being developed, not when people began using magnifying glasses.
* **D: Kamgbe na mbido narị afọ nke 16** - Similar to B, this is too early.

"N’isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwu, kedụ ihe kevu Muhammad kwuru maka wu gbasara omume ma ọ bụ ụkpụrụ ime mmụọ ya?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ nabatara udo na ịnọpụ iche.**

Here's why:

The passage describes Muhammad going to a secluded cave in the mountains to meditate. The cave was difficult to find, and once inside, it was completely isolated. The description emphasizes the quiet and solitude of the place. This directly supports the idea that Muhammad valued peace and contemplation.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ịme mkpọtụ ezi nwere ike nye ntụgharị uche aka:** While prayer might be part of his practice, the passage doesn't specifically mention prayer or its effects on his meditation. The focus is on the environment conducive to meditation.
* **C: Ọ chọrọ oge dị ntakịrị ịnọrọ onwe ya:** While he *did* seek solitude, the passage emphasizes the *value* he placed on that solitude – the peace and quiet. Option A captures this better.
* **D: Ọ chọsiri ike ịhụ ya ma nụ ya:** This describes the cave's location, not Muhammad's beliefs about his spiritual practices.



"
"Isonye ka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ si kwuo, kedụ ihe e ji ígwe emebe n’izizi?","The correct answer is **D: Okporo igwe (Iron beams)**.

The text states: ""N'ikpeazụ, eji wiil ígwè dochie wiil osisi."" This translates to ""Finally, iron beams were used to replace the wooden beams."" Therefore, the iron was used to make beams.
"
"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si dee, gịnị mere eji were whilu igwe dochie anya whilu osisi?","The correct answer is **C: Ejiri ha wee buru nnukwu ibu**.

This directly indicates that the wooden beams were used to support heavy loads. The later iron beams were also implemented to handle even heavier loads, and the wooden beams were eventually replaced due to the stress they put on the stone supports.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Maka emelitere ikeọsọ ịnyịnya:** The passage doesn't mention anything about improving the speed of horses.
*   **B: A hụtara na ha ka mma:** While the initial wooden beams were a solution, the passage highlights their eventual weakness and the need for a stronger material. It doesn't say they were inherently ""good.""
*   **D: Eji igwe dị na ya na-adọkasị n’okporo ụzọ ha:** The passage mentions the beams being placed *alongside* the road, not *in* the road. The iron beams were placed *on* the wooden beams.



"
"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ ihe mebere ndị mmadụ na mgbe nke Romantisizimu?","The correct answer is **D: Omenala (Tradition)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Romanticism was a movement where people looked to **tradition and folk culture** as a source of inspiration.  It mentions authors like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel were influenced by traditional elements.  The core idea is that people found a connection and a sense of belonging in their cultural heritage, which became a key focus during the Romantic period.

The other options are not as directly supported by the text:

* **A: Iwu gasị emebere (Laws enacted):** While laws might be part of a culture, the passage focuses more on the broader cultural and traditional aspects.
* **B: Jiogụrafii (Geography):** Geography can influence culture, but it's not the primary focus of the passage.
* **C: Kọstọmụ (Customs):** Customs are *part* of tradition, but tradition is a broader concept than just customs. The passage emphasizes the overarching influence of tradition on the Romantic movement.

The passage explicitly states the opposite of option B. The passage highlights that technological development is *not* solely driven by rational or political forces, but also influenced by cultural factors and societal needs. The example of the road system and the invention of new ways to transport money demonstrate how cultural needs (economic transactions) led to technological advancements.

Let's look at why the other options *do* align with the passage:

* **A: Ụdị mmekọrịta mmadụ na-emetụta ọnọdụ teknọlọjii na mbara mmadụ (Human interaction patterns influence the state of technology and the human sphere):** The passage emphasizes how societal needs and interactions (e.g., the need for efficient money transfer) drive technological development.
* **C: Teknọlọjii na-emetụta ọnọdụ ọha mmadụ (Technology influences the state of the public sphere):** The passage provides examples (road system, money transport) where technology demonstrably alters public life and facilitates new activities.
* **D: Mmelite teknọlọjikụl agbasaghị ụkwụ na ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị obodo (Technological development has not bowed to political power):** The passage implies a degree of independence from solely political forces, suggesting development is often driven by other factors like cultural needs and societal pressures.



Therefore, option B is the only one that directly contradicts the core message of the passage.

"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, olee n’ime ihe ndịa na-adakọtaghị n’ịkpụlite ụta?","The correct answer is **C: O nwere ụda sitụrụ ike**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Otu ụta-elu na -emepụtakarị ụda kara dị nro, ebe ụta-ala ka sie ike ma kara kwupụta.""  This translates to: ""The upper drum often produces a soft sound, while the lower drum is loud and booming.""  

Option C, ""O nwere ụda sitụrụ ike"" (It has a booming sound), accurately describes the sound of the lower (ala) drum as described in the passage.

"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, olee n’ime ihe ndịa ka ya na ụda dị juu n’adakọrịta ?","The correct answer is **A: Akara ụta dị ala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Otu ụta-elu na -emepụtakarị ụda kara dị nro, ebe ụta-ala ka sie ike ma kara kwupụta."" (An upper tone usually produces a soft sound, while a lower tone is loud and booming.)

Therefore, the lower tone ( ụta dị ala - Akara ụta dị ala) is the one that is directly associated with a loud sound.

Fọsilụ na-egosi n’aka mechara ka ejiri ya mee ihe maka nke gịnị na ndịa?,"The answer is **C: Ịtụgharị (Grasping)**.

The passage explicitly states that the hand's structure suggests it was used for ""ibute ibu nọ n'ime ije njikọ mkpịsịaka"" (grasping objects within a complex of branches). The passage also mentions the evolution of the hand from climbing to grasping, with fossil evidence showing this specialization. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **Ịtụgharị (Grasping)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aka mmadụ dị mkpụmkpụ karịa ụkwụ, ya na ụmụ ọkpụkpọ mkpịsị aka kara kwụ ọtụ."" This directly indicates that the size and structure of the hands and feet of hominids are different.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha gbatịkarịrị nke ndị mmadị:** The passage doesn't mention anything about how often hominids climbed trees.
*   **C: Eji ha anagide ibu:** While the passage mentions hominids used their hands for carrying things, it doesn't say this was the *primary* use for chimpanzees.
*   **D: Ihe mbu eji ha eme bụ nrụgharị:** The passage indicates that the primary use was for *walking* and manipulating objects, but it doesn't state that climbing was the first use."
Kedụ ọdọ mmiri nke nhọrọ na-ewepụ varieshọnụ genetiki ọhụrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Nke zoro ezo (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

* **Mutation** is the process that *introduces* new genetic variations. The question states that mutations are a source of new genetic variation.
* **Recombination** (option B) shuffles existing genetic material but doesn't create *new* variations.
* **Segregation** (option C) is the separation of alleles during gamete formation, it doesn't create new variations.
* **The answer ""ekwuru"" (D)** is just a general statement and not a specific process.



Therefore, the question asks which *introduces* new genetic variation, and the answer is mutation."
Kedụ usoro eji agbakwụnye varieshọnụ genetiki?,"The correct answer is **C: Muteshọnụ (Mutation)**.

Here's why:

* **Mutation** is the fundamental source of new genetic variation. It's a change in the DNA sequence. The passage explicitly states that mutations ""add new genetic variation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nkewa (Segregation)**:  This refers to the separation of allele pairs during gamete formation (meiosis).  It's important for inheritance, but it doesn't *create* new genetic variation.
* **B: Nchikọgharịta (Recombination)**: This occurs during meiosis when homologous chromosomes exchange genetic material. It shuffles existing alleles, creating new combinations, but it doesn't create entirely new alleles.
* **D: Nke ekwuru (The above)**: While segregation and recombination are important processes related to genetics, they don't directly *add* new genetic variation like mutations do.



Therefore, mutations are the primary mechanism for introducing new genetic variations into a population."
"""Idabere n’ozi dị na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee otu n'ime ndị a ka pụrimeti kwesịrị iri ka omezie """"nsogbu protini""""?""","The correct answer is **D: Stemụ Fụlawa (Fulwa Stem)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explains the difficulty of obtaining complete proteins from plants.** It states that while plants like grains and legumes contain protein, they lack certain essential amino acids.  Humans and other primates overcome this by eating meat.
* **Fulwa Stem is mentioned as a readily available resource.** The text says, ""Ihe akụrụngwa a na-enweta ngwa ngwa abụrịrị protein ndị dị na akwụkwọ na legume gasị..."" (These resources readily obtain protein from grains and legumes...).  This implies that Fulwa Stem, being a readily accessible plant resource, *could* potentially provide the protein needed to address the ""protein problem"" *if* processed correctly.
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Akwụkwọ osisi nwụrụ anwụ (Dead Tree Bark):**  While it *might* contain some protein, it's unlikely to be a significant or complete source. The text doesn't mention it as a protein solution.
    * **B: Legumu esibeghị n’ọkụ (Uncooked Legumes):** The text explicitly states that uncooked legumes are *not* sufficient to overcome the protein problem because they lack complete amino acids.
    * **C: Igwurube (Wood):** Wood contains very little protein and isn't a viable protein source.

Therefore, based on the text's description of the protein challenge and the readily accessible resources, Fulwa Stem (Stemụ Fụlawa) is the most plausible option for addressing the ""protein problem.""

"Dika mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, olee nsogbu bụ nke enweghị amino acidi na-akpata ?","The correct answer is **A: Ihe gbasara mgbaza nri (Dietary issues)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that primates, like humans, need to obtain essential amino acids from various food sources. It then highlights the difficulty and dangers of doing so – large trees, heights, and potential death. It further explains that while plants like grains and legumes contain protein, they lack all the necessary amino acids.  The passage concludes by implying that this lack of complete amino acids was a driving force for our ancestors to seek out ""important protein"" sources like meat, which provides a full complement of amino acids.

Therefore, the core problem discussed is the difficulty in obtaining complete amino acids through a plant-based diet, which is fundamentally a dietary issue.

Olee ka ndị otu sọbụkọchọ na-esi egosipụtakarị mmekọrịta ha n’otu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha na-anabata ihedịmma nke ọha.**

Here's why:

The passage discusses how culture shapes thought and values, emphasizing interconnectedness and shared meanings.  A key way cultures express their interconnectedness is through a sense of community and shared identity.  **Anabata ihedịmma nke ọha (maintaining social harmony)** is a central tenet of many cultures, and a primary way people express their belonging and connection to that culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ha na-agba mbọ ịsonye:** While connection is involved, simply trying to connect isn't the defining characteristic of how groups express their relationships within a culture.
* **B: Ha na-anakwere ntụziaka nke onye ọbụla nọha nso:** This implies a more hierarchical or authoritarian structure, not necessarily a cultural expression of belonging.
* **D: Ha na-eji ụdịdị ka ọbụrụ ihe nlereanya:**  This is too abstract and doesn't directly address the *how* of expressing relationships within a cultural group.

Here's why:

The passage states that children internalize stereotypes about race and academic performance.  It specifically mentions that children from certain racial backgrounds might start misbehaving in school *after* they become aware of racial biases.  This suggests a learned behavior stemming from the stereotype and the expectation of negative consequences.

Therefore, if a child internalizes a stereotype that suggests they are prone to misbehavior, they will likely *try* to avoid that behavior to avoid confirming the stereotype and its associated negative outcomes.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Nwa ahụ ga-enwekarị ike ịbanye omume ọjọọ:**  While possible, it's less likely than the child actively trying to avoid it. The passage implies a proactive response to the internalized stereotype.
* **C: A ga-ewezuga nwa ahụ n’ọnọdụ mkpakọrịtaọha:** This is not directly supported by the passage.  The passage focuses on the child's internal response to the stereotype.
* **D: Nwa ahụ ga-ajụ ịsọ otu obere resịalụ ndị ọzọ:** The passage doesn't provide any information to suggest the child would seek out others with similar stereotypes.

This directly links the awareness of racial differences to poor academic performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Obere resialụ ha họrọ ka amata ha:**  The passage doesn't mention anything about ""resialụ"" or how knowing it affects the children.
* **C: Ka ha na ụmụaka ndị ọzọ si emekọrịta:** While social interaction is important, the passage focuses specifically on the *impact of racial awareness* on academic performance, not general social relationships.
* **D: Nkọwa ha na-enye banyere resi:** The passage doesn't mention ""resi"" or what children describe about it.



Therefore, the passage directly connects the awareness of racial differences to the children's *academic performance (akparamaagwa)*.

Here's why:

The text describes ""undeveloped children"" ( ndị azụghị azụ) as often having lived isolated lives. This isolation can stem from various factors: abandonment, neglect, or even being raised by animals.  The text specifically mentions that when animals raise them, the child shows affection towards the animal but lacks affection for humans. This reinforces the idea of a solitary existence.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha na-enwe nkọritaụka dị omume (They have a normal socialization):**  The entire premise of the text is that these children *lack* normal socialization.
* **C: Ha na-enwe ikike ịnọrọ onwe ha (They have the right to be alone):** While their existence might be solitary, the text doesn't imply they have a *right* to be alone. It describes a traumatic circumstance, not a desired state of being.
* **D: Ha na-enwe ịtụ egwu ọha (They have a fear of crowds):**  While they might be fearful, the text doesn't specifically mention a fear of crowds. Their fear is more generalized, stemming from their isolation and traumatic upbringing.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nkwarụ ahụ bụ ihe na-akpatakarị ọtụtu omume ọjọo ụmụaka"" (Neglect is a common cause of child abuse). It also highlights the lack of communication as a major factor: ""Enweghị ụzọ mmekọrita na-akpatakwa omume ọjọọ"" (Lack of communication is a common cause of child abuse). 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nkwarụ ahụ bụ ihe na-akpatakarị ọtụtu omume ọjọo** - While neglect is a cause of child abuse, the passage states that lack of communication is also a common cause.
*   **C: Omume ọjọọ bụ naanị ụmụaka ndị ha na nne na nna ha nọ** - The passage describes children who lived alone in the forest, implying that abuse could occur even without parental figures present.
*   **D: Ọgụgụ isi ezughị oke na-akpatakwa ụmụaka ịme omume ọjọo** - The passage doesn't mention overpopulation as a factor in child abuse. It focuses on neglect and lack of communication.

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the passage's emphasis on the lack of communication as a cause of child abuse, and neglect being a common form of it."

Here's why:

The passage states that reporting farm activities is often simple, especially in traditional communities where agriculture is deeply ingrained. It also mentions that many farmers do this informally. This suggests that the focus is on the practical, everyday aspects of farming.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ịkọpụta ihe oriri a ga-eresị ndị ọzọ:** While sharing the harvest might happen, the passage doesn't emphasize reporting the *value* of the produce.
* **C: Ịlegharanya n’usoro ọrụ dị elu ma na nnukwu ihe nweta:** The passage explicitly says reporting is *simple* and often informal, not involving complex processes or large-scale gains.
* **D: Ịchọpụta mkpụrụ osisi dị n’ebe onye ọrụ ugbo si:** The passage doesn't mention or focus on the farmer's origin.

Therefore, focusing on things that would *benefit* the farmer aligns with the passage's emphasis on simple, practical reporting within the context of traditional agricultural communities. It suggests a concern for supporting the farmer, which is a reasonable approach to reporting farm activities.

* **The passage emphasizes that traditional farming is often simple and relies on natural systems.** It mentions ""ụsoro ndị ọzọ dị mfe iji mee ka ọmịmị kachasị"" (other simple systems to maximize yield) and the fact that many farmers rely on ""nkpụrụ echekwara"" (saved seeds). This points to organic methods.
* **Option B** contradicts the passage's description of simple, traditional farming.
* **Option C** is not mentioned in the passage.
* **Option D** focuses on trade and doesn't align with the passage's description of the core practice of farming.

Therefore, the passage's description of farming aligns best with the idea that it's a purely organic practice.

* **Cultural tourism** focuses on experiencing the traditions, history, art, and lifestyle of a place. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Njem nlegharịanya azụmahịa (Business tourism)** is for business-related trips.
* **B: Njem nlegharịanya ntụrụndụ (Leisure tourism)** is primarily for relaxation and recreation.

The passage states that a key aspect of travel is to ""understand its history and culture.""  Therefore, experiencing the local culture is a primary benefit for tourists. The passage also mentions learning about the differences of cities and being able to observe them, which is directly related to understanding the local culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ha ga-enweta ezumike n’ọrụ ha na-arụ kwa ụbọchị:** While relaxation is *a* benefit of travel, the passage focuses on cultural understanding, not necessarily stress relief from work.
* **C: Ha ga-ahụ okeala obodo dị mkpa:**  The passage doesn't specifically mention seeing important city landmarks as a *key* benefit.
* **D: Ha ga-aghọta akụkọ ihe mere eme nke mba:** While understanding history is mentioned, it's presented alongside understanding *culture*, and culture is emphasized more strongly in the passage.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that understanding past instances of non-conformity and the reasons behind them helps people understand their place within the church's history. This historical understanding facilitates acceptance of new changes and encourages innovative thinking.  The passage directly states, ""icheta mgbe ndị mmadụ mere ihe n'ụzọ na-abụghị omenala...ọ si wee rụpụta ihe ọma mere ka ndị mmadụ dị nnabata nye mgbanwe ọhụrụ na ntụzịaka ọhụụ maka ụka obodo.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ọ dị mkpa ịlota mmemme akaọrụ ndị gara nke ọma:** While important, this isn't the *primary* reason historical understanding fosters a welcoming attitude toward change.
* **B: I ga-enweta nghọta ndị omenala metụtara n’otu:**  Historical understanding contributes to this, but it's a broader concept.  The passage goes beyond just gaining general cultural knowledge.
* **C: A ga-enyochapụta ụdị ihe na-emelite otu:** This is a consequence of understanding the past, but not the immediate effect that builds excitement for change.



Therefore, the passage directly links understanding historical stories of non-conformity to fostering acceptance of change and inspiring innovation, making option D the most accurate.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that understanding *why* people acted in ways not aligned with cultural norms is crucial for people to understand their place within the organization's history. It also states that observing progress and addressing setbacks requires principles, communication, and community support.  The key to fostering positive change, according to the passage, is to learn from past mistakes and encourage a culture where individuals are held accountable.  This accountability, and the understanding that actions have consequences, is what enables individuals to gain insight into their own story and their role in the community's evolution.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Ịbelata ụjọ nke mgbanwe (Decreasing fear of change):** While important, reducing fear of change is a *result* of accountability and understanding, not the primary means of gaining insight into personal narrative.
*   **C: Ịchọta ebe dị mma n’otu ahụ (Finding a good place within the community):** This is a positive outcome of understanding one's narrative, but not the method for achieving that understanding.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes that learning is a personal process based on the connection between the learner and the material.** It states, ""Learning is what happens when a learner and the material have a connection.""
* **Option B directly reflects this idea.**  It suggests focusing on what *you* choose to focus on, highlighting the personal and selective nature of learning.  It aligns with the passage's critique of passively consuming information without internalizing it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ụfọdụ ihe ndịahụrụ na ọmụmụ bara nnukwu karịa ndị ọzọ (Some tools in learning are more important than others):**  The passage *rejects* the idea of a single ""best"" learning tool. It criticizes passive absorption of information, not the tools themselves.
* **C: Ụfọdụ usoro nke ọmụmụ ka ibe ya mma (Some learning methods are better than others):** The passage argues *against* the notion of one ""better"" method. It implies that the best method is the one that fosters personal connection and internalization.
* **D: N’ọmụmụ, o nweghị ihe bụ agachaaọgwụ (In learning, nothing is absolute):** While the passage advocates for a flexible and personalized approach, it doesn't state that *nothing* is absolute. The central point is the personal and connective aspect of learning.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọmụmụ bụ ihe na-eme mgbe onye na-amụ ihe na ihe ọmụma nwere mmekọ."" This means learning is not just about absorbing information but about connecting it to personal experiences and feelings. The passage further argues that experiences we haven't personally had are unlikely to be integrated into our understanding or actions.

Option C directly reflects this core argument: ""Iheahụru ọmụmụ na-agbakwasa ukwu n’onye ọmụmụ na amamihe e ziputere."" This captures the idea that learning is deeply personal and connected to our own experiences and emotions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Enwegasịrị ọtụtụ usooro esi enweta ozi:** While the passage acknowledges different ways of gaining knowledge, it doesn't focus on *methods* of learning but rather on the *process* of learning and its connection to personal experience.
* **B: Ekwesiri ibute usoro iheahụrụ ọmụmụ ụfọdụ ụzọ karịa ndị ọzọ:** The passage doesn't advocate for certain learning methods being superior to others. It emphasizes the importance of personal connection to learning, regardless of the method.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes sleep inertia as the groggy feeling after waking up.** It mentions that disrupting the biorhythms can cause it.
* **Option C directly addresses disrupting biorhythms and mitigating sleep inertia.**  Turning off alarms and sleeping for 120 minutes (2 hours) is a common technique to allow the body to fully wake up and reduce sleep inertia.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịmụ akwụkwọ otu awa n’ọkara tupu ịgaghachị n’ụra:** Studying is not directly related to regulating sleep or reducing sleep inertia.
* **B: Iga n’ụlọ ịsa ahụ ma gaghachikwaa ozugbo n'ihi ụra:**  Going to the bathroom before bed is fine, but doesn't specifically address the biorhythm disruption or the grogginess (sleep inertia).
* **D: Ịkulire n’ụra gaa ṅụọ mmiri dị na karama n’ogigeabalị gị:** Drinking water before bed is mentioned in the passage as something that *can* disrupt sleep (causing nighttime bathroom trips), but it's not a solution to sleep inertia.

It's a *cue* to help you re-establish a sleep routine, not a guarantee of sleep duration.

Therefore, the only statement that's not accurate based on current scientific understanding is that you can reliably rely on biorhythms.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ihe kachasị akpata nke a bụ na nrọ ndị ahụ doro anya na-amụba oge dị n'etiti ọnọdụ REM dị iche iche.""  This means the more frequent the awakenings, the more often the brain shifts between different REM sleep stages.  Therefore, the *number* of REM sleep periods is directly related to increased awakenings.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Nha ike (Sleep deprivation):** While sleep deprivation *can* lead to more awakenings, the passage directly links awakenings to the REM sleep transitions. Sleep deprivation is a consequence, not the immediate cause.
*   **C: Ogologo nke ọnọdụ mchịkọlata (Duration of slow-wave sleep):** The passage doesn't connect slow-wave sleep duration to awakenings.
*   **D: Oge jikọtara ọnọdụ REM gasị (Total time spent in REM sleep):** Similar to option C, the passage emphasizes the transitions *between* REM stages, not the total time spent in REM.

Therefore, the passage directly correlates awakenings with the frequency of transitions *between* REM sleep stages, making the number of REM sleep periods the most accurate answer."

Here's why:

The passage states that sleep deprivation leads to shorter and more disrupted REM cycles. The question asks what leads to *worse* dream recall. If REM sleep is shortened, you're less likely to have vivid or memorable dreams in the first place. Therefore, *longer periods of sleep deprivation* (which directly impacts REM sleep length) would lead to poorer dream recall.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Ịwelata REM gasị kwa abalị:** While frequent REM cycles are *part* of normal sleep, the passage links *sleep deprivation* to *disrupted* REM. Frequent REM doesn't automatically mean good dream recall.
*   **C: Idakwasị na nkọwaputa nrọ:** This is a general statement about dream recall and not specifically tied to the mechanisms described in the passage.
*   **D: Ịmelite REM gasị kwa abalị:** This contradicts the passage, which links sleep deprivation to *shorter* REM cycles."
"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ ka timu kọnveshọnal na timu vechụal si yie?","The correct answer is **B: Timu abụọ a nwere ọkwa dị iche iche nke pụrụ nwegharị n’ọrụ ha na-arụ kwa ụbọchị.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọnụnọ nke otu """"òtù anaghị ahụ anya"""" n'ezie (Larson na LaFasto, 1989, p109) bụkwa otu ǹsòmebe pụrụ iche nke otu òtù kendịnuche. “Òtù anaghị ahụ anya” ahụ bụ òtù njikwa nke onye ọ bụla n’ime ndịòtù ahụ na-ekpesa. Òtù anaghị ahụ anya ahụ na-ewube ọkọlọtọ maka onyeòtù ọ bụla.""

This refers to virtual teams, where individuals have more autonomy and flexibility. The passage then contrasts this with traditional teams, implying a more hierarchical structure.

Option B accurately reflects this difference in flexibility and autonomy, suggesting that virtual teams have a different level of control and task management compared to traditional teams. Options A, C, and D are not supported by the information provided in the passage.



"
"Idabere n’edemede akwụkwọ a, olee akụkọ gbasara fisikal na vechual timu gasị na-ezighi ezi?","The correct answer is **C: Kọnveshọnal timu nwere obere ikike nnọrọonwe karịa vechual timu.**

Here's why:

The passage describes **coitional teams** (which are likely physical teams) as having limited autonomy. It states: ""They do not have the authority to choose their own leaders and as a group they are unable to meet and resolve issues as they can in different times of their community that can manage their city without chaos."" This directly implies that physical teams have less individual power and control compared to virtual teams, which aren't discussed in the passage but are contrasted with them. 

The passage also highlights a key characteristic of coitional teams: they are considered ""invisible teams"" where control is diffused among each member. This also suggests a lack of centralized authority.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information presented in the passage.
"
Kedu n'ime edemede kọwapụtara ihe echiche ọdịnaya gbadoro ụkwụ n’apụghị ime?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọchicho dị n'ime obi (Intrinsic motivation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage defines ""Tiori ndịnà"" (Humanistic theories) as emphasizing innate drives and needs.** It specifically mentions that these theories believe people have inherent needs and desires that influence their behavior.
* **""Ọchịcha dị n'ime obi"" (Intrinsic motivation) refers to doing something for the inherent satisfaction or enjoyment it provides, rather than for external rewards.** This aligns perfectly with the concept of innate drives and internal needs highlighted in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ọchịchọ ọhụrụ na-achakepụta na mgbe okenye (New needs arise as people age):** While needs can change over time, the passage focuses on *innate* needs, not needs that *develop* with age.
* **B: Ka gburugburu mmadụ si elughari nkpatụ ha (The environment chooses their fate):** This is the opposite of humanistic theories, which emphasize individual agency and choice within a supportive environment.
* **D: Ịghọta ihendị na-amasị mmadụ (Understanding what pleases people):** This relates to extrinsic motivation (doing something for external rewards), which is contrasted with the intrinsic motivation discussed in the passage.



"
Kedụ ihe na-abụghị ọbjekti nke iwu nke ọnọdụ atọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ina-edobe isiokwu n'otu ebe dị mma**.

Here's why:

* **The Law of Three (or Three-Act Structure)** is a storytelling principle that breaks down a narrative into three distinct parts: setup, confrontation, and resolution. It's about *visualizing* the story's progression within a single image.

Let's look at why the other options *are* elements of the Law of Three:

* **A: Ịna-ekepụta ahịrị ntọala nke ebendobe isiokwu (Creating the foundation of the story's spine):** This refers to the basic structure of the narrative – the core plot points.
* **B: Ịna-ekeputa ndụ na ike n'ime foto (Expressing life and energy within the photo):**  This connects to the emotional arc and the feeling of the story being conveyed visually.
* **D: Ịna-emepụta usoro n'ime foto (Creating a sequence within the photo):** This directly relates to the three-act structure by showing the progression of the story within the image.

* **C: Ina-edobe isiokwu n'otu ebe dị mma (Placing the story in a good location):** While location is *important* in storytelling, the Law of Three isn't primarily about the *physical location* of the story. It's about the story's *structure* and *visual representation*.  The ""good location"" isn't a core element of the three-act framework.



Therefore, placing the story in a good location isn't a fundamental aspect of visualizing the three-act structure in a single image.



"
Kedụ edemede na-akọwapụtaghị ụdị fotogụrafii 35mm?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọ ka nọ na mbiputa (It is in print)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Dịka ọmụmaatụ, nhàzi nka osise onyinyo nkwụ n'otu ebe a na-ahụkarị n'ụwa niile bụ 35mm, nke bụ nha fim kachasị ewu ewu na ngwụcha oge fim analọgụ. A ka na-emepụta ya taa...""

This indicates that the information about 35mm film format is readily available in print (books, magazines, etc.) because it's a well-known and historically significant format.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọ bụ ụdịdị igwefoto dijital nabatara ya (It is an accepted digital camera format):** While 35mm *aspect ratio* is used in digital cameras, the text focuses on the *film format* and doesn't say it's a widely *accepted* digital format in the same way as, for example, a specific sensor size. The text is discussing the historical film format.
*   **C: O nwere akụkụ dị iche iche karịa ọtụtụ ụdịdị ndị ọzọ dịnweta (It has more variations than many other digital formats):** The text doesn't mention variations or different types of digital formats.
*   **D: Ọ bụ nke dịkasiri nweta na mba ụwa (It is a widely adopted globally):** The text explicitly says it's a format ""n'ụwa niile"" (worldwide) which implies it's globally adopted, but the question asks what the text *doesn't* state. The text doesn't go into detail about its adoption rate compared to other formats.



Therefore, the text highlights the widespread availability of information about 35mm film, implying it's readily found *in print*."
"Isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, dịka ndị nrụpụtaihe na-emelitee ogo nke nmeụta enyoanya, olee ka e si kwalite ọdịmma nke enyoanya?","The correct answer is **A: Ha nwere ike enyoanya karịrị dị elu**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks how manufacturers are improving image quality as they improve zoom lens complexity.** The passage states that increased complexity allows for higher optical performance, leading to image quality comparable to prime lenses.
* **Option A directly reflects this improvement in image quality.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha ka dị mfe iwe rụọ ọrụ n’ọnọdụ ọkụ-dịala.** While zoom lenses *can* sometimes be more convenient in low light due to wider maximum apertures, the passage doesn't link this directly to image quality improvements driven by increased complexity.
* **C: Ụdịdị foto ha dịka enyoanya nwere ogologo fokalụ lemti enwe mgbanwe.**  The passage mentions that zoom lenses can mimic the look of prime lenses with long focal lengths, but doesn't connect this to improved image quality stemming from lens complexity.  Also, the phrase ""lemti enwe mgbanwe"" isn't standard photography terminology.
* **D: Ha nwere fokalụ mgbagwoju anya dị ntakịrị karịa enyoanya purimu.** While zoom lenses have a variable focal length, this isn't the primary way manufacturers are improving image quality as described in the passage. The focus is on the *optical performance* achieved through increased complexity.



"
"Ịdabere n’edemede akwụkwọ a, kedụ mgbe eji achọ enyoanya mgbatiihe karịa enyoanya purimu?","The correct answer is **D: Ma ọbụrụ na ị na-achọ ọtụtụ ihemgbagwojuanya fokalụ.**

Here's why:

The passage states that a key advantage of zoom lenses is their ""focal complexity"" which allows them to achieve a range of focal lengths that prime lenses can't. This is explicitly mentioned as a benefit. The other options are not directly linked to the core advantage of zoom lenses as described in the passage.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na abụghị nkọwa ziri ezi maka Misticismi?,"The correct answer is **A: A na-enwe mmesi na-ịnweta usoro udo n’obi ụtọ nke amaghị ekere.**

Here's why:

* **Mysticism** *is* fundamentally about direct, personal experience – often described as ecstatic or mystical – that transcends intellectual understanding. It's *not* about achieving this experience through rote practices or unearned serenity.  It emphasizes spontaneous, ineffable encounters.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate descriptions of Mysticism:

* **B: Ndịosiso Misticismi na-achọ ịmụta eziokwu nke mmụọ:** Mystics *do* seek to understand the divine, although they often go beyond intellectual understanding to experience it directly.
* **C: Ndịosiso Misticismi nwere ike ịkwere usoro ndị ga-enyere aka ịzụlite nghọta ha n’ụzọ enweghị ntụpọ:**  Mystics often use practices like prayer, meditation, contemplation, or asceticism to prepare themselves for mystical experiences. These are not meant to guarantee the experience, but to clear the path.
* **D: A manyere atụ ọnụnụ ọkụ n’obi ịchọtarịrị ịheahụrụ nkeonwe na ọtụtụ ụdị nke nkwere okpukpechi na ifechi:**  This is a core tenet. Mysticism is characterized by an intense, passionate yearning for union with the divine.



Therefore, option A is the only one that doesn't accurately describe mystical practices or aims.



"
"Dịka esi dee n’akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe na-abụghị nlekwasị nke Misitisizim?","The correct answer is **A: Ịna-achọ echicheobi n'ihe enweghị ntụpọ (Seeking flawless thought)**.

Here's why:

The provided text describes Mysticism as a path of direct experience and seeking a deeper connection with the divine or spiritual realms. It emphasizes personal experience, intuition, and transcendence. 

Option A, ""Ịna-achọ echicheobi n'ihe enweghị ntụpọ,"" directly contradicts this. Mysticism isn't about achieving perfect, flawless thought. It's about moving *beyond* the limitations of rational thought to access a different kind of knowing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ịna-achụso nghọtaobi na nkekọrịta, iheahụrụ mmekọrịta (Emphasizing intuition and connection, spiritual experiences)** - This aligns perfectly with the description of Mysticism in the text.
* **C: Ihe gbasara ọnọdụ iheamaghị dị mma (Things related to the imperfect state of being)** - Mysticism often involves acknowledging the imperfect state of being as a starting point for spiritual growth and seeking transcendence.
* **D: Ịna-achụsosi ike ime ịmata Chukwu (Striving firmly to know God)** - While Mystics seek to know God, it's not typically through intellectual striving. It's through direct experience and mystical practices.



"
"Dika esi dee n’akwụkwọ a, olee onye malitere otu oru ubi?","The correct answer is **B: Moriori si na Chatham Islands**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""ihe akaebe ọhụrụ na-egosi na ndị Mariori bụ otu ndị Maori ndị si na Niu Ziland pụọ gaa n'Agwaetiti Chatham..."" This directly indicates that the Moriori originated from the Chatham Islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Moriori si na New Zealandi:** The text implies they *left* New Zealand, not that they originated there.
* **C: Ndị mmadụ Maori si na Polynesia:** While the initial theory suggested Polynesian migration, the text clarifies the Moriori were a branch of Maori who migrated *from* New Zealand.
* **D: Maori si na mainlandi:** The text doesn't mention a mainland origin for the Moriori.

"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si kwuo, olee ebe otu ndị chụrụ anụ nta moas na mbụ bi?","The correct answer is **B: Na New Zealandi**.

The passage states: ""N’otu ogologo oge n’ime ụmụ narị afọ iri na itoolu na iri abụọ, e kwenyere na ndị mbụ biiri na Niu Ziilandị bụ ndị Maori..."" This directly indicates that the Moas lived in New Zealand.
"
Olee otu ịjị usoro Purelandi nke origami rụọ ga abara folda ahụ uru?,"The correct answer is **C: Folda na-ekepụta origami nke nabatara foldu azụ.**

Here's why:

* **Pureland origami's restriction is about the number of folds.** It limits the number of folds to one at a time and forbids unfolding. This constraint forces a very specific, planned sequence of folds.
* **The goal of Pureland origami is to teach beginners and those with limited dexterity.** By requiring a strict sequence and preventing backtracking, it helps build muscle memory and precision. 
* **Option C accurately reflects this process:** The predictable outcome of each fold, combined with the impossibility of undoing steps, reinforces the learned movements and develops the ability to execute a complex design in a precise and repeatable manner. This builds a strong foundation for future origami skills.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Folda na-anabata ịme ọtụtụ foldu n'otu mgbe:** This directly contradicts the core rule of Pureland origami.
* **B: Folda enwela nka moto emelitere:** While folding improves dexterity, the primary purpose of Pureland isn't to specifically upgrade existing motor skills.
* **D: Folda agbaliala ya naanị otu ugboro ma ọbụ ugboro abụọ n’oge gara aga:**  This describes backtracking, which is explicitly forbidden in Pureland origami.



"
Kedu n'ime ederede ndị a na-akọwapụtaghị origami Purelandi ka ọdị?,"The correct answer is **B: Anaghị agbakwụnye foldu azụ n’usoro ya.**

Here's why:

* **The definition of Pureland origami specifically states that no reverse folds are allowed.** This is a core characteristic of the style.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A na-emebere ya maka ndị folda iheahụrụ:** While Pureland origami *can* be enjoyed by hobbyists, the primary purpose, as stated in the prompt, was for beginners and those with limited dexterity. This isn't the defining characteristic of *how* it's created.
* **C: Foldu ya ga-enwerịrị ebe amara amara:**  Pureland origami doesn't explicitly require folds to be done in a specific location.  The focus is on the restrictions of the folding process, not the physical workspace.
* **D: Ọ bụ usoro ka mma nke folda gasị nwere ntakịrị nka moto:** While it's true it was designed for those with limited dexterity, the core characteristic isn't specifically tied to advanced skill levels. It's about the strict folding rules.



"
"Dika esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee ebe ana-agbakwụnyeghị Civilizeshọn Valie Indusu?","The correct answer is **A: Na Harappa**.

The text states: ""...the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization is often referred to as the Harappan Civilization, where the first roads were discovered in the 1920s."" This directly links the Harappan Civilization to the location of Harappa.
"
Kedu nke na-akpọpụtaghị dịka nke nwere ike ịbụ aha maka Mmepeanya nke Afọ Ọla nke e kwuru maka ya n'ederede a?,"The correct answer is **B: Indus-Sarasvati Civilization**.

Here's why:

* The text states that while the civilization is known as the Indus Valley Civilization, it is also referred to as the Indus-Sarasvati Civilization because the Indus River is not the only river that contributed to its development. The Sarasvati River was also very important.
* The term ""Harappan Civilization"" refers specifically to the civilization based on the archaeological site of Harappa. While closely related, it's not the complete name used to refer to the entire civilization.
* ""Indus River Civilization"" is too narrow, as it doesn't acknowledge the importance of the Sarasvati River.
* ""Indus Valley Civilization"" is the most common name, but the text specifically mentions the alternative name, Indus-Sarasvati Civilization.



"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, ole n'ime ederede a na-enye nriteuru ogologo oge?","The correct answer is **A: Mmekọrịta ya na ndị ọzọ (Collaboration with others)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Anya ukwu na ọchịchọ onwe naanị ga adịgide n'etiti anyị ma ọbụkwa ihe na-esote imekọ ihe ọnụ..."" This means that a strong individual (anya ukwu) and self-interest are sustained *through* collaboration.  The passage explicitly connects collaboration with the enduring nature of a strong individual and self-interest.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ị na-emezima ebumuche nke onwe (Self-reliance/Independence):** The passage argues *against* self-reliance as the sole basis of strength, suggesting it needs collaboration.
*   **C: Ị na-agbadosike n’ihe ga-abara onye nwere ntakiri karịa onye nwere ọtụtụ (Protecting the vulnerable):** While related to good deeds, this isn't the primary focus of the passage.
*   **D: Ị na-achọpụta n’anyaukwu nwere ike baa uru (Recognizing mutual benefit):** This is true, but it's a *result* of collaboration, not the core point about what sustains strength over the long term.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer because the passage highlights that collaboration with others is what makes a strong individual's self-interest enduring.



"
"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ si kwuo, olee n'ime edemede a ka mmadụ nwere ike ibute ụzọ ma ọ bụrụ na ọchọrọ ịnweta nritauru ozugbo?","The correct answer is **D: N’ịchọ ọdịmma nke onwe ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...Ọchịchọ onwe naanị ga adịgide n'etiti anyị ma ọbụkwa ihe na-esote imekọ ihe ọnụ...a ga enwerịrị ihe nrite n'uru dị nụ nke a ga eritenwu n'obere oge ma akpaa agwa ọchịchọ onwe naanị.""

This means that individual desires *eventually* give way to a desire for personal gain (or benefit) after collaboration. The passage implies that the initial focus on individual desires (option D) is the starting point, but ultimately, it leads to a shift toward prioritizing one's own benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N’ihe nkeonwe:** While individual desire starts there, it's not the *starting point* for obtaining a reward.
* **B: Na mmekọrịta:** Collaboration is *necessary* to obtain the reward, but it's not what one initiates in order to get the reward.
* **C: N’ọdịmma ya na ndị ọzọ:** This is a consequence of collaboration, not the initial step in seeking personal gain.



"
"N’ịsonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, olee onye kpuchiri oke akụkụ nke mmefu agha?","The correct answer is **B: Ndị ụlọ akụ Wọlụ Striti**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""A manyere ha iwu ịkwụ ụtụisi nye ndị ọchịchị mbịarachịwa mba Amerịka iji wedata oke ego e mefuru n'aha gọọmenti mba Filipin site n'aka ụlọakụ Wọlụ Striti."" This directly indicates that the Wall Street firms were involved in documenting and potentially managing the funds related to the war's expenses.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị gọmenti Philippine:** The passage argues that the Filipinos themselves paid the price, not the Philippine government directly.
*   **C: Ọchịchị colonial nke U.S:** While the US colonial government was ultimately responsible for the war, the passage focuses on the financial aspect managed by Wall Street.
*   **D: Ndi Filipino:** The passage asserts that the Filipinos bore the *cost* of the war, but the question is who *accounted for the amount of money*. The answer points to Wall Street.



"
Kedu oge bịara tupu afọ nke Templarsi?,"The correct answer is **B: Narị afọ nke 12**.

The passage states the High Middle Ages occurred from AD 1000-1300. The Late Middle Ages began around 1500. Therefore, the period *before* the High Middle Ages would be the 12th century.
"
Kedu oge bịara ka afọ nke Templarsi gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **C: Afọ Etiti Dịelu**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ọgbọ ihe ndị a mere na ya ka a na-akpọkarị Ọgbọ Etiti dị Elu bụ oge ihe ndị mere na mba Yuropu n'afọ narị iri na otu, narị iri na abụọ na narị iri na atọ (AD 1000-1300).""  This directly corresponds to the definition of the Knights Templar's period as the ""Ọgbọ Etiti dị Elu"" (High Middle Ages).
"
Kedu ọgwụgwọ ma ọ bụ usoro ọgwụgwọ nke na-ekwughị ka ndị dọkịta na ndị sọjọn na-eji n'oge Ọchichi Roman?,"The correct answer is **B: Ha na-eji mmipụta nke mkpụrụ osisi herbane agwọ scopolamini.**

Here's why:

* The text specifically states: ""Ndị dọkịta na-awa ahụ mabu maka ọtụtụ ọgwụ ụra dịka mọfịịn e si na mkpụrụakụkụ pọpị enweta na skopolamiin e si na mkpụrụakụkụ habenụ enweta.""
* Option B directly reflects this statement about using scopolamine derived from *herbane* (likely referring to *Haber* or *Hybane*).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha na-eji ọtụtụ sedetivi dị iche iche agwọ nsogbu ngbasaahụ postu-traumatiki:** While the text mentions sedatives, it doesn't highlight them as a primary treatment for post-traumatic stress.
* **C: Ha ji arterial clampu eme nrụgharị ọbara:**  The text mentions arterial clamps for *stopping* blood flow, not for re-establishing it.
* **D: Ha na-eme amputeshọn maka ndị ọrịa gangreni:** The text mentions amputations as a treatment for gangrene, but it doesn't say they were *commonly* used.

"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, olee ihe na-abanyeghị n’ọganihu ndị e mere na ngalaba ahụike n'oge Alaeze Ukwu Rom?","The correct answer is **A: Mwube Medikal Kọọz.**

The text explicitly states: ""Eze gburugburu Ọgọstus bidoro na-ewe ndị dibia n'ọrụ ma bido rịị Roman Medikal Kọọz nke mbụ ga-arụ ọrụ nlekọta mgbe alụsiri agha."" This translates to ""Emperor Augustus began employing physicians and started the first Roman Medical College which would work in care during wartime.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ihenlereanya agha dị ọjọọ nke empaya:** While war certainly impacted healthcare, the text focuses on *improvements* in healthcare, not the negative impact of war itself.
* **C: Nmepụta nke ụlọ ọgwụ ọmụmụ:** The text mentions the *starting* of a Medical College, not the creation of numerous hospitals.
* **D: Onye emperọ ịnye ndị dọkịta ọrụ:**  The text states the emperor *employed* physicians, not just gave them work.  The establishment of the Medical College is the key advancement.



"
Kedụ ihe ikikere ịhụ ihe dakwasiri na?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị ọgan sensorị sistemụ a-ahụ anya**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ọhụhụ, ma ọ bụ enwemike ịhụ dabere na ọganụ ahụ kesensọ sistemụ ọhụhụ ma ọ bụ anya."" (Vision, or sight, is based on the sensory system of the eye.) This directly links vision to the sensory system of the eye.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ihe ndị a chọrọ n’oganizimụ:** While the eye needs certain things to function, the core of vision is the sensory system itself.
* **C: N’ihi nkpatụ aka nke ụfọdụ wevu-lemti:** This is irrelevant to the basic mechanism of vision.
* **D: Ogo dị nwegharị nke acuiti:**  Acuity (sharpness of vision) is *a result* of the sensory system's function, not the *cause* of what enables vision in the first place.



"
Kedu ihe varieshọn nke nhazi anya dị n'etiti ọganizimụ dabere na ya?,"The correct answer is **D: N’ihemgbagwoju anya nke organizmụ (In the visual environment of the organism)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that eyes are adapted based on the ""visual environment"" of the organism. Different organisms live in vastly different environments (e.g., aquatic, aerial, nocturnal, diurnal). These environmental differences drive variations in eye structure and function.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Na ikenkpatụ wevulemti (In the evolutionary history):** While evolution *influences* eye structure, the passage focuses on *current* variations based on the environment, not evolutionary history itself.
* **B: Ihe organism chọrọ (What the organism needs):** This is a very broad statement. While needs *influence* adaptations, it doesn't specify the *type* of variation described in the passage. The environment dictates *what* the organism needs to see, and that dictates the specific eye adaptations.
* **C: N’ọkwa nke acuiti (At the level of acuity):** Acuity (sharpness of vision) is *one aspect* of eye variation, but it's not the primary driver.  The passage describes a wider range of variations beyond just sharpness.



Therefore, the environment in which an organism lives is the key factor driving the variations in eye structure and function.

"N’isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee edemede banyere Sikhismu na-akọwaghị okpukpechi ka osi di?","The correct answer is **A: Nkewa ọchịchị dị n’etiti omenala Hindu kpatara Sikhismi.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""O bidoro na mpaghara Pụnjab n'ahọ nke narị iri na ise site na nkesa ngalaba n'etiti omenala Hindu."" This directly links the emergence of Sikhism to the context and influence of Hindu culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Guru bụ mpaghara nwere ugwu na Sikhism:** While the passage mentions the importance of Gurus, it doesn't focus on their *power* as a distinct characteristic of Sikhism. It highlights their role as foundational figures.
* **C: Ndị guru iteghete sochiri onye malitere okpukpechi, Guru Nanak:** This is true, but the passage already covers this point. The question asks what is *not* discussed regarding the origins of the faith.
* **D: Ụfọdụ omenala ndị Sikhismi tinyere mkpọrọgwụ n’ okpukpechi ndị Hindu:** The passage does *not* mention any opposition or rejection of Hindu practices by Sikhism. It focuses on the influence *of* Hinduism.



Therefore, the passage does discuss the interplay and influence of Hindu culture, making option A the correct answer.



"
"Ịsonye ka edemede a si dee, olee n’ime okwu ndịa ka anabatara dịka isi ihe nke sistemụ nkwenye Sikh?","The correct answer is **B: Omenala Hindu gasị**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ndị Sikh ga-agwa gị na okpukpe ha na okpukpe Hindu abụghị otu ihe, mana ha kweere na ọ bụ n'okpukpe Hindu ka nke ha si pụta.""  This means Sikhism originated from Hinduism.
* While the passage mentions the Guru as a central figure, it doesn't say the ""ebumunobi nke guru"" is *the* core belief.  It mentions the Guru's importance *within* the context of Sikhism's origin from Hinduism.
* The passage *doesn't* say they don't believe in other Indian religions. It acknowledges their roots.
* While the passage mentions Punjabi, it doesn't state it as a core belief of the *system of faith* itself. It's the language of the Guru's name and the meaning of ""Gurmat.""



Therefore, the origin from Hinduism is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"Dị ka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si kọwaa, olee ihe nwere ike siri ụmụaka nwere nsogbu nkpachapụrụanya ike nweta?","The correct answer is **A: Ọrụ ụlọ akwụkwọ**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ụmụaka n'arịa ọrịa ADD na-enwe nramahụ ịgbado anya n'ihe dịka ọrụ ụlọakwụkwọ..."" This directly addresses what activities children with undiagnosed ADD may struggle with. While the text mentions they *can* be engaged in other activities, their difficulty with homework is highlighted.

The text states: ""Umuaka na abawakari nime otutu nsogbu, nihi na ha """"na etinye onwe ha na akparamagwa di-egwu, na aba n’ogu, ma na-ama ikikere ochichi aka n’ihu"""" ebe ha na acho ikpali uburu ha, ebe-obu na akpaliteli uburu site na uzo esi eme ya."" This describes behavior driven by a need to release pent-up energy, a core symptom of hyperactive impulsivity (which is often associated with ADD).  The text implies they are acting out to release the energy they can't channel appropriately.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iji nyere ha aka jikọọ n’ebe ndị ọgbọ ha nọ:** While social difficulties are a consequence of ADD, the text doesn't directly say that's the primary reason for the disruptive behavior.
* **C: Iji nweta nkpachapụ anya n'aka nne na nna ha:**  The text doesn't indicate the behavior is driven by a need for parental attention.
* **D: Iji kwalite ụbụrụ mmụta ha:** The text describes difficulties with learning, but it doesn't state that the disruptive behavior is intended to *improve* learning in some way. It's disruptive *because* of the difficulty with focus and impulsivity.

"Igbakwasa ukwu n’ozi dị n'akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime okwu ndị a na-abụghị ọmụma atụ nke sikafoodim?","The correct answer is **C: Usoro ọmụmụ nkeonwe (Personalized study routine)**.

Here's why:

* **Scaffolding** provides temporary support to help learners accomplish a task they couldn't do alone. It's about *how* the learning is done, not the learning process itself.
* **Option A (Nkuzi mmụta na mbido egwuregwu kọmputa - Computer game learning tutorials):**  These tutorials are a form of scaffolding. They provide initial guidance to help someone start using a computer game.
* **Option B (Onyenkuzi SAT - SAT tutors):** SAT tutors offer guidance and instruction to help students prepare for the SAT, acting as scaffolding for a complex task.
* **Option D (Onyenchịkwa obere ligi - Little league coaching):** Coaches provide guidance, instructions, and support to help little league players learn and improve, which is scaffolding.
* **Option C (Usoro ọmụmụ nkeonwe - Personalized study routine):**  A personalized study routine is *the plan* for learning. Scaffolding *supports* the learning *within* that routine, but isn't the routine itself. It's the framework, not the temporary support.



Therefore, a personalized study routine is the one that doesn't fit the definition of scaffolding.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Skafoldin abụghị usoro mmụta kama ọ bụ enyemaka na-akwado ndị na-amụ ihe ọhụrụ dịka iji program ọhụrụ arụ ọrụ na kọmputa maọbụ ibido ọrụ ọhụrụ."" This directly contradicts the idea of it being a large project or a comprehensive study.
* **Options A, B, and D are supported by the text:**
    * **A: Sikafoodu nwere ike ime vechual:** The text mentions it's used in software and on computers, implying a virtual component.
    * **B: Ọ bụ ihe enyemaka kama usoro ọmụmụ:** The text clearly states it's *not* a study, but *support*.
    * **D: A na-eji sikafoodu gasị agbakwụnye nkwado na mbido nke iheahụrụ ọmụmụ:** The text says it's used to provide guidance, answer questions, and explain steps – all things that provide support at the beginning of a learning activity.

Therefore, only option C presents an idea that is *not* directly supported or mentioned in the provided text.

"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, olee njimara MySpaci nwere ike ịbara ụmụ akwụkwọ nwere nramahụ ịgụ akwụkwọ uru?","The correct answer is **A: Kọstọmizeshọn (Customization)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""E nwere ike ịhazigharị ya ka o nwee ike dị mfe ịgụ nakwa iji nnukwu ma ọ bụ obere agba dị ka achọrọ."" This refers to the ability to **customize** the website's appearance (colors) to suit individual needs, including those with visual impairments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bụlọgụ gasị (Gas stove):** This has absolutely nothing to do with the MySpaci website.
* **C: Otu adreesị weebụ (One web address):** While having one web address is convenient (as mentioned in the passage), it's not a feature that *helps* students with visual impairments *choose* books.
* **D: Profaịlụ nde 54 (Profile of 54 million):** The number of profiles is relevant to the platform's size, but it doesn't directly address how students with visual impairments can *choose* books.

"N’igbakwunye ukwu na mpaghara nke akwụkwọ a, olee otu n'ime ihe ndị a na-esoghị azịza Krushchev maka ọgba aghara gasị nke onye ọrụ?","The correct answer is **C: Melite mbelata ụgwọ ọrụ (Increase wage cuts)**.

Here's why:

* **The text states Krushchev *did* agree to some economic concessions (D).** This aligns with the text's description of him offering some economic directives.
* **The text states Krushchev *did* deploy tanks to restore order (B).** This directly matches the information provided.
* **The text states Krushchev *did* appoint Wladyslaw Gomulka as Prime Minister (A).** This is also confirmed by the text.
* **The text implies Krushchev *did not* increase wage cuts.** The riots were *caused* by wage cuts, and Krushchev's actions were to *resolve* the situation, not exacerbate it. Therefore, increasing wage cuts would be contrary to his efforts to restore order.



Therefore, the answer is **C**.



"
Olee n’ime ihe ndịa na-akpataghị ọgba aghara na Polandi?,"The correct answer is **C: Mbelata ụgwọ ọrụ (Wage cuts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the riots began due to anger over **food shortages and wage cuts**. While communism was the underlying political system, the immediate trigger was the economic hardship caused by these cuts.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kọmunizim (Communism):** While communism was the political system, the immediate cause of the riots was the economic grievances.
*   **B: Ụkọ nri (Food shortages):** Food shortages were a key factor, but wage cuts were also a significant cause.
*   **D: Nhọpụta nke Wladyslaw Gomulka (Appointment of Wladyslaw Gomulka):** Gomulka's appointment happened *after* the riots and was a result of the unrest, not a cause of it. It was a way to quell the uprising.



"
"Dị ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ n'ime ihe ndị a na-emetụtaghị mmekọrịta USSR na USA?","The correct answer is **B: Ihe ha kwere maka Germany (What they agreed on regarding Germany)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that after World War II, disagreements over the post-war order, including what to do with Germany, led to strained relations between the US and USSR.  This disagreement was a major factor that prevented the continued cooperation that existed during WWII and ultimately contributed to the Cold War.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: Omenala pụgasiri iche (Customs diverged):** While cultural differences existed, the passage doesn't directly link cultural divergence as a primary *cause* of the shift from cooperation to conflict.
*   **C: Ịmegharị usoro gasị (The restructuring of the gas system):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the gas system or its restructuring as a factor.
*   **D: Esemokwu gbasara sistemu gasị (Discussions about the gas system):**  Again, there's no mention of the gas system in the passage.

Therefore, **B** is the only option directly supported by the information provided in the passage.



"
Kedu n'ime edemede ndịa na-akọwaghị kpọmkwem ebumnuche nke izipu mkpali navu n’ahụ niile?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịwelata ngazu ọbara**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The lymphatic system uses lymph vessels to transport lymph fluid throughout the body *to keep blood circulating well and prevent problems*. It also says this system can quickly signal to the whole body to protect it from any danger.
* **Options B, C, and D are directly mentioned in the passage:** The passage explicitly mentions homeostasis (C) and the body's defense against danger (which implies protection, potentially related to preventing the spread of infection, related to B).  It strongly *implies* that maintaining good blood circulation is a key function contributing to homeostasis (C).
* **The passage does *not* mention the lymphatic system's role in removing waste from the blood (Ịwelata ngazu ọbara).** While the lymphatic system *does* play a role in removing waste and toxins, the passage focuses on its role in circulation and defense, not waste removal.

Therefore, the question asks which option the passage *doesn't* explicitly state.  Removing waste from the blood is the one not directly mentioned.
"
Olee ihe enwere ike ịhụ na Platuu Giza?,"The correct answer is **C: Ihe ịtụnanya asaa niile**.

The text states: ""Oke Piramidi na Giza bụ naanị nke ka kwụ taa n'ime ihe itụnanya asaa ahụ.""  This implies that the Giza Plateau *contains* one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, and by extension, potentially others within the complex. While the text mentions pyramids, tombs, temples, and the Sphinx, it explicitly identifies the Great Pyramid as *one* of the Seven Wonders.
"
Olee ihe bụ ọchịchọ obi nke Piramidi Ukwu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ka o nye Fero nsọpụrụ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Arụrụ oke piramid iji kwanyere Eze Khufu zugwu..."" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka ọbụrụ otu n'ime ihe itụnanya asaa nke mba ụwa:** While the Great Pyramid *is* one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the passage focuses on *why* it was built, not its status as a wonder.
*   **C: Ka ọ rụọ ọrụ ka akara ala:** The passage doesn't mention it being used as a base.
*   **D: Ka ochekwaa ili ndị mmadụ nwụgoro anwụ:** The passage mentions tombs and temples for the Pharaoh and his family, but doesn't state the pyramid itself was for storing bodies.



"
Olee onye ma ihe maka onye asọnisti nke mebiri tempulu?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị Efesos**.

The text states: ""Ndị Efesos, jiiri iwe maka ya kwubie na agaghị edetu aha Herostratus ma ọlị."" This translates to ""The Ephesians, in anger, vowed not to mention the name Herostratus at all.""  Therefore, the Ephesians were the ones who vowed to not name the arsonist.
"
Kedụ edemede kọwaraa kpọmkwem gbasara nrụgharị tempụlụ nke Atemis?,"The correct answer is **B: A rụgharịrị ụlọ nsọ na 323 BCE.**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mgbe Alexander mechara nwụọ, a rụgharịrị ụlọ nsọ na 323 BCE.""  Option B accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ bụ Alexanda Onyeukwu kwụrụ ụgwọ nrụgharị ya:** While Alexander *intended* to rebuild the temple, it was never actually carried out during his lifetime.
*   **C: E nyere Herostratus iwu ka ọ hụ maka ihe gbasara nrụghachi ya:** Herostratus was the arsonist and was not involved in the rebuilding efforts.
*   **D: A rughachiri ya n’afọ 320 BCE:** The text explicitly states the rebuilding happened in 323 BCE, not 320 BCE.



"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee, kedụ afọ izizi spechie gara ije n’ụkwụ abụọ?","The correct answer is **A: Nde afọ asaba gara aga**.

The passage states: ""ezie na Sahelanthropus nwere ike ije ije n'ukwu abuo na nde afọ asaa gara aga."" This means *Sahelanthropus* is the earliest species mentioned that likely walked upright.  The passage then says *Homo Erectus* started walking upright around nde nde abụọ gara aga. Therefore, nde afọ asaba gara aga is the earliest time period mentioned where a species is known to have walked upright.
"
Kedu n'ime spechie ndị a na-ejikarị ụkwụ abụọ aga ije?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

*   **Homo Erectus** is explicitly mentioned in the passage as being the first to consistently walk upright (bipedally) approximately 1.8 million years ago.
*   **Sahelanthropus** is mentioned as *possibly* having walked upright, but this is less certain and occurred much earlier (7 million years ago).
*   **Australopithecus** is stated as not walking upright as efficiently as Homo Erectus.
*   **Ọpụrụiche bipedalụ (Bipedal adaptations)** refers to the *ability* to walk upright, not a specific species.

Therefore, the passage directly links **Homo Erectus** with the development of habitual bipedalism."
Kedu ihe ndị agha mmiri Germanị na-agbalị imepụta n'oge WWII?,"The correct answer is **B: Ịgbochi Britain ịnabata ndị mmadụ na ngwaahịa.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""The naval actions of the war became crucial in ensuring that your country could transport your troops and goods to shore, and at the same time, preventing your enemy from transporting theirs to their shore.""  It then gives the Atlantic campaign as an example, where German naval forces were trying to ""halt the passage of troops and supplies across the Atlantic."" This directly relates to preventing Britain from receiving troops and supplies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ịgbochi ngwaahịa ndị si Britain abịa** While disrupting British supply lines was a goal, the primary objective was to prevent Britain from *receiving* supplies.
*   **C: Ịbufe ngwaọrụ n'ofe Atlantiki** The passage doesn't mention sinking vessels as the primary goal.
*   **D: Ịgbochi Amerika ịnabata ndị mmadụ na ngwaahịa** The passage focuses on the German actions against Britain, not the US.



"
"Dabere n’ozi e nyere n’edemede a, olee onye kachasi ịnwe ọganihu n'agha navalụ na mgbe Mgbasa Ozi Nọtụ Atlantiki?","The correct answer is **D: Ndị Britain**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the US and Britain were trying to transport troops and supplies across the Atlantic, and the German navy was trying to stop them. The passage emphasizes the importance of this transport for Britain's survival and mentions that Germany's success in stopping it could have led to Germany winning the war. Therefore, the British were the ones whose progress in naval warfare was most threatened, and thus, the one whose advancement was most crucial to maintain.
"
Kedụ ihe na-adịghị nweta oge ndị Asịrịa mejuputara ịji cavalrị?,"The correct answer is **A: Sadulusu**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Emepụtabeghị sadụl mgbe ahụ, ya mere kalvarị Asịrịa busoro agha n'elu azụ ịnyịnya ha."" This translates to ""They had not yet invented the saddle, therefore Assyrian cavalry fought on the backs of their horses.""

Therefore, the Assyrians did not have saddles when they initially developed their cavalry. The other options are not mentioned in the passage in relation to Assyrian cavalry.
"
Kọwaa otu esi alụ ọgụ eji calvari alụ?,"The correct answer is **C: N’azụ inyinya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Emepụtabeghị sadụl mgbe ahụ, ya mere kalvarị Asịrịa busoro agha n'elu azụ ịnyịnya ha."" This translates to: ""Since they did not have saddles at that time, Assyrian calvary fought on the backs of their horses.""
"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, olee ebe ị na-agaghị ahụ ọkara citizimu Babilọn?","The correct answer is **D: Ịwebata aja n’ebenchụaja dị n’ime** (Bringing offerings into the inner sanctuary).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the inner sanctuary (""ime ebe nchuaja"") was reserved for the high priest only. 
* Therefore, regular citizens wouldn't have been allowed access to bring offerings there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịwebata aja n’ogigeikpe tempulu (Bringing offerings to the temple courtyard):** The passage says offerings were brought *to* the temple, and the courtyard is where the offerings were likely presented.
* **B: Ịga emume na tempulu pụraimari (Attending ceremonies in the temple courtyard):** The passage mentions ceremonies taking place in the temple, so this is plausible.
* **C: Na mmemme n’ogigeikpe tempulu (During ceremonies in the temple courtyard):**  Similar to B, ceremonies took place in the temple, making this likely.



"
Gịnị n'ime ihe ndị a ka e debere naanị maka ndị nchụaja?,"The correct answer is **B: Ebenchụaja gasị dị n'ime**.

The passage states: ""...nke a nwere ime ebe nchuaja ebe nani onye-isi nchu-aja nwere-ike ibanye."" This directly indicates that only the high priest had access to the inner part of the temple.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Emume gasị:**  The passage mentions rituals were performed for the gods, but doesn't say they were *exclusively* for priests.
* **C: Mmemme gasị:**  Similar to rituals, ceremonies were performed, but not limited to priests.
* **D: Zigguratụ gasị:** Ziggurats were temples, and the passage describes them as being dedicated to the gods, not just priests.



"
Kedu oge Eze Tutankhamun kpatara aha ọjọọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ka-achọpụtachara ili ya**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nchọpụta ebe olili ya n'afọ 1922 mere ya onye ịrịba ama."" (the discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.)  This directly links the discovery of his tomb to his fame and recognition. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **A: Ka ezuchara ili ya n’ohi** (when his tomb was looted) - While there *was* looting, the passage doesn't say that's what made him famous. It was the discovery of the tomb itself.
*   **B: N'oge ọchịchị ya** (during his reign) - The passage mentions he wasn't considered a particularly important ruler during his lifetime.
*   **D: Ka edeputechara ya na ndesita eze mgbe ochie** (when he was buried in the royal tombs of ancient times) - The passage indicates he wasn't given prominence in the royal tombs during his lifetime.



"
Gịnị mere Eze Tutankhamun ji bụrụ eze Ijipt a ma ama?,"The correct answer is **A: Nchọpụta nke ili ya na-enweghị mgbagwoju anya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nchọpụta ebe olili ya n'afọ 1922 mere ya onye ịrịba ama."" (The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.)

While the other options might be *related* to his fame, they aren't the *reason* he became famous *specifically* according to the text. The text emphasizes the discovery of his intact tomb as the key to his renown.
"
Olee ihe onye Grik na-ede uri Homer na-enwewughi ike ime?,"The correct answer is **B: Ịhụ ihe**.

The passage states that Homer wrote the *Iliad* and the *Odyssey*, which are epic poems. Epic poems are known for vividly describing events and scenes, engaging the reader's imagination and making them *see* what is happening. The other options don't fit the description of what epic poetry achieves.



"
Kedu onye Grik a ma ama nke a maara maka ihe ọzọ na-abụghị agụmagụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks for a Greek famous for something *other* than literature.**  Homer is famous for his epic poems (Iliad and Odyssey). Sophocles and Aristophanes are playwrights.
* **Pythagoras** is known for the Pythagorean theorem, a mathematical principle about triangles. This makes him the only option described as famous for something other than literature.

Therefore, the answer is C.
"
Kedụ ebe ndị ezinụlọ Hibru na-emefukarị ọtụtụ oge ha?,"The correct answer is **D: N’ime ụlọ (Inside the house)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụmụ nwanyị siri nri na mbara eze; ụmụ ụlọ ahịa wụbụ naanị ọgụego mepere emepe na-elefe anya n'okporo ámá. E jire okwute maka ịrụ ụlọ."" (The women ate in the palace gardens; the servants only nibbled at the open leaves looking out over the marketplace. Rope was used to build the house.)

This describes a very elaborate and luxurious household. The key detail is the mention of ""ọrụ ụlọ"" (building the house), implying the people spent a lot of time *inside* the house. The other options (ebe ikuku - courtyard, streti - street, yaadị - yard) don't align with the description of the elaborate palace and the need to build a house within it.



"
Olee ihe na-adịchaghị oke mkpa maka ezinụlọ Hibru?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụlọ obibi ha (Their houses)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes a culture where houses were built for the benefit of others, not for the inhabitants' personal gain. The emphasis is on elaborate structures and gardens rather than the practicality or comfort of the people living in them. The passage states, ""Ọtụtụ ihe ezinụlọ ndị juu a mere, ọ bụ n'anya onye ọbụla ka ha mere ya"" (Many things these wealthy families did, they did for the benefit of everyone). It also mentions that they ate in palaces and that shops just had open frontages.  The lack of large farms suggests that resources might be scarce, implying that grand houses would be a luxury rather than a necessity.

Therefore, the houses themselves were not essential; they were symbols of wealth and generosity, built for public display and benefit. The other options are more likely to be important:

*   **Kụlaimeti ha (Their climate):** Climate would certainly impact their survival and agricultural practices.
*   **Ụlọ ahịa ha (Their shops):** Shops are essential for trade and commerce.
*   **Isi nrị ha (Their livestock):** Livestock would provide food, labor, and other resources.

"
Gịnị n'ime ndepụta ndịa na-akọwapụtaghị ọdịiche dị n'etiti obodo Scandinavian gasị?,"The correct answer is **A: Akụkọ ihe mere eme**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Even though every settlement was a 'Scandinavian land,' there were many differences between the people, rulers, customs, and historical accounts in Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.""  It highlights that historical accounts are a key area where differences existed.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ala (Land):** While geography influences culture, the passage focuses on *differences* in societies despite being ""Scandinavian lands."" The text doesn't emphasize land as a primary source of difference.
*   **C: Omenala gasị (Customs):** The passage *does* mention differences in customs, but it also specifically mentions historical accounts as a source of difference.
*   **D: Mmadụ (People):**  The passage mentions differences in people, but again, it gives more emphasis to historical accounts as a distinct area of divergence.

Therefore, **historical accounts** are the most directly supported answer in the provided text."
Kedụ onye gara na mbụ na Greenlandi kpara ala?,"The correct answer is **A: Agbụrụ Ezkimo**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""In spite of Erik the Red’s discovery, the Eskimo race had already settled there at that time.""  This directly answers the question about who was there first. While Erik the Red is credited with *discovering* Greenland for the Norse, the Eskimo people were already living there.
"
Kedu otu ga-anabata ejighị oche eri nrị?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụmụ nwoke Rome bara ọgaranya**.

Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a na-abụghị akụkụ nke emume ndị Romu mgbe ochie?,"The correct answer is **D: Efere toki a ṅara n'ọkụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that the ancient Romans did not have ingredients from the Americas or Asia.** This means they wouldn't have had ingredients like chili peppers, which are the basis for ""efere toki a ṅara n'ọkụ"" (which translates to chili pepper soup).
* The other options are all mentioned in the passage as aspects of Roman dining:
    * **A: Ndị ọbịa bụ ogbenye na-eri nri n'oche** - The passage says the elderly and women ate while reclining at tables by the river.
    * **B: Ịji ejula gasị eme apịtaiza** - The passage lists dormice as a special food.
    * **C: Ụmụ nwoke bara ọgaranya na-ehi n’ala mgbe oriri abalị** - The passage mentions that the upper classes preferred elaborate dinners.



"
"Sitena ịdabere n'akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ihe ndị apụghị ịnwe mmetụta na-adịgide?","The correct answer is **C: Steeti-obodo**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Steeti-obodo gasị bụ obu ụzọ nke ụmụ mba."" (City-states were the way of the people.) This indicates that city-states are a foundational element linked to the concept of civilization as described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Obodo (City):** While cities are *part* of civilization, the passage emphasizes the *state* or organized political entity (city-state) as a key aspect.
* **B: Omenala dị obere (Small customs):** The passage states that small customs that don't leave a significant legacy aren't considered part of true civilization.  So, small customs don't have a lasting impact in the way the passage describes.
* **D: Omenala civilization (Civilization customs):** This is a bit circular. The passage describes *what* civilization customs are, but it doesn't directly point to ""civilization customs"" as the most enduring element. Instead, it points to the development of city-states *through* the accumulation of customs and traditions.



Therefore, **C: Steeti-obodo (City-states)** is the best answer because the passage directly links the rise of city-states to the development of civilization."
"Olee ihe na-eso obodo, dika mpaghara akwụkwọ a si dee?","The correct answer is **C: Steeti-obodo**.

The text explicitly states: ""Steeti-obodo gasị bụ obu ụzọ nke ụmụ mba."" This translates to ""The city-state was the way of the people."" Therefore, the text identifies the city-state as the progression following the development of civilization.
"
Olee edemede maka Drukgyal Dzong na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **A: A rụrụ ya maka emume mmeri nke ndị agha Tibet-Mongol**

Here's why:

The text states that Drukgyal Dzong was built to commemorate Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol armies, not *for* their victory.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

*   **B: E hibere ya Bhutan** - The text states it's located in the Paro district, which is part of Bhutan.
*   **C: Ọkụ bibiri ọtụtụ ihe dị mkpa fọdụrụnụ** - The text explicitly mentions that a fire in 1951 destroyed many of the dzong's artifacts, including images of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.
*   **D: Ọ bụ Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel kere ya** - The text says Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ordered its construction.



"
Olee edemede kọwapụtara kpọmkwem ihe ọkụ kpatara na Drukgyal Dzong?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndị agha Tibet Mongol meriri**.

The text states: ""N'afọ 1951, ọkụ ọgbụgba mere ka sọ ihe onwunwe ole m'ole nke Drukgyal Dzong fọ, ihe dị ka onyonyo Zabdrung Ngawang Namgial. **Echekwara ma chedo ebe ahụ ewusiri ike**, nke fọrọ ịbụ otu n’ime ihe ndọta kachasị emetụta nke Bhutan.""

This implies that the fire was a result of the Tibetan-Mongol invasion and subsequent conflict. Option B directly reflects this cause. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...n’ime 1772 ha bibiri Phnom Phen. Ndị Vietnam wakpokwara Kambodia.""  This means the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in the early 18th century.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The passage says the Thai invaded Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage states the Thai invaded Cambodia many times in the 18th century and specifically in 1772, not the other way around.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The passage says the Thai invaded Phnom Penh, not the Vietnamese.

* The text states: ""Na ngwụcha afọ ndị dị na senchuri nke iri na asatě, ndị Vietnam wakpokwara Kambodia."" (At the end of the 18th century, the Vietnamese also invaded Cambodia.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndị Thais na Vietnamese wakporo Cambodia n’afọ 1772** - While the Thai invaded in 1772, the text doesn't say the Vietnamese invaded *in* 1772. It states the Vietnamese invaded at the *end* of the 18th century.
* **C: TNdị Vietnamese mebiri Phnom Penh** - The text states the Thais conquered Phnom Penh in 1772, not the Vietnamese.
* **D: Ọtụtụ oge ka ndị Thai wakporo Cambodia** - While the text says the Thais invaded Cambodia *many* times, it specifically mentions the Vietnamese at the end of the 18th century.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate reflection of what the text explicitly says about the invasion of Cambodia."
Kedu ihe ụlọ ọrụ Dutch East India na-emeghị mgbe ha nọ na Taiwan?,"The correct answer is **D: Ha kpachara anya nyefee ọchịchị Quing nchịkwa nke Taiwan**.

Here's why:

The text states that in 1683, the Ming Dynasty (under the Qing Dynasty) took control of the southern and northern waters of Taiwan and declared it part of the Qing Empire in 1885. The Dutch East India Company's actions *led* to the Qing Dynasty taking control, not the other way around.  The Dutch East India Company established a trading post, initiated cash crop production, and brought in Chinese laborers, but they did *not*  intentionally hand Taiwan over to the Qing Dynasty.  Japan later took control after the Sino-Japanese War.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha nwere ntọala n'akụkụ ndịda ọdịda anyanwụ nke islandi:** This is true according to the text.
*   **B: Ha na-emepụta mkpụrụọka obodo:** This is true according to the text.
*   **C: Ha tinyere ndị ọrụ China n'ọrụ n'ubi ya:** This is true according to the text.



Therefore, option D is the *only* incorrect statement among those provided."
Gịnị ka Nkwekọrịta nke Shimonoseki mepụtara?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọdịda Japan n’agha Sino-Japanese nke izizi**.

The text states: ""Na 1895, mgbe a dachara n’Agha Sino-Japanese Mbụ (1894-1895), ọchịchị Qing ahụ mere mbịanye aka na Nkwekọrịta nke Shimonoseki ahụ, site na nke o jiri nyefee Japan ọbụbụeze nke Taiwan, nke na-achị agwaetiti ahụ ruo 1945.""

This clearly indicates that the Treaty of Shimonoseki resulted in Japan gaining control of Taiwan.
"
Olee etu esi elele levulu pH nke kemikal?,"The correct answer is **C: Ole ion hayidụrogen na kemikal**.

Here's why:

* **pH is defined by the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+).** The text explicitly states, ""Nha nke ayọn Hydrogen nọ na kemịkal ọbụla bụ ihe na-egosi ogo pH ya."" This means a higher concentration of H+ ions indicates a lower pH (more acidic), and a lower concentration indicates a higher pH (more alkaline).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịmata ole kemikal basiki ma ọbụ acidik dị:** While knowing if a chemical is acidic or basic is helpful, it doesn't directly tell you the *level* of pH.  It's about *how much* H+ is present.
* **B: Ole proton dị na kemikal:**  A proton is a hydrogen *nucleus* (containing only a proton). pH specifically measures the concentration of *hydrogen ions* (H+), not just protons.
* **D: Ole eletrọn dị na kemikal:** Electrons are involved in chemical bonding and reactions, but they don't directly determine the pH of a solution.

Therefore, the pH of a chemical is determined by measuring the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) present.
"
Kedụ ihe ewepuru n’ion Haịdrojin?,"The correct answer is **A: Protọn**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ayọn Haịdrojin bụ protọn anaarala elektrọn ya..."" This directly tells us that an ion of hydrogen is a proton.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: pH:** pH is a scale used to measure acidity and alkalinity, not the component *within* the hydrogen ion.
* **C: Alkalini:** Alkalinity is the opposite of acidity, and while related to pH, it's not what the hydrogen ion *is*.
* **D: Elektrọn (Electron):** While hydrogen has an electron, the defining characteristic of the hydrogen *ion* (H+) is that it is a proton, which is a hydrogen atom that has lost its electron.



"
Kedu n'ime ndepụtandị a na-akọwapụtaghị kpọmkwem ngala ọdụm?,"The correct answer is **B: Reshoo nwoke na nwanyị akwụghị ọtọ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Mpako gasị bụ otu ruo atọ ụmụ nwoke tozuru oke metụtaranụ mejupụtara ya, yana ụmụ nwanyị na ụmụ ya dị ọtụtụ dị ka iri atọ.""  This implies a significant imbalance between the number of men and women.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Ndị nwanyị na-emetụtakarị nke ukwu n’onwe ha, n’ibu otu nnukwu ezinụlọ nke ụmụnne nwanyị na ụmụ nwa nwanyị."" This further reinforces the disproportionate number of women.
* **Options A, C, and D are supported by the text:**
    * **A:** The passage mentions they ""akpa agwa ka ezinụlọ oke nkịta ọhịa maọbụ nkịta ụlọ.""
    * **C:** The passage says ""Ndị nwoke na nwanyị niile nwere njikọ yiri"" because the women form a large family network. It does not explicitly state men are the same.
    * **D:** ""Ha niile na-egbu egbu ma na-enwekwa mekọrịta mmadụ"" because the passage states they are ""oke iyi egwu"" and form a family network.

Therefore, the only statement *not* explicitly supported by the text is that the ratio of men to women is equal.



"
Kedu n'ime ndepụta ndị a na-akọwapụtaghị kpọmkwem agwa ọdụm?,"The correct answer is **D: Agwa ha yiri nke nnukwu nwamba ndị ọzọ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ezinụlọ Ọdụm na-akpa agwa ka ezinụlọ oke nkịta ọhịa maọbụ nkịta ụlọ, **n'omume, ndị nwere oyiyi dị ịtụ n'anya nye Ọdụm (mana odịghị otu a n'ebe nnukwu nwamba ndị ọzọ nọ)** n'omume, mana bụrụ ihe oke iyi egwu nye ihe ọbụla ha na-achụ na nta.""

This means Ọdụm's fur is unique and doesn't resemble that of other large wolves. Options A, B, and C are all things the passage *does* mention about the wolves (their social structure, their fear of predators, and the fear they inspire)."
Kedụ ụdị anụ ndọgbụ na-erikarị oke bekee?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị ọkara nha nwamba (Medium-sized carnivores)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""N’okpuru ha bụ ụmụ nwamba ha ọkara na-eri anụoriri ha ọkara nke nwere ike isi na oke bekee ruo na ele nakwa mgbada.""  This directly translates to ""They are a type of carnivore that can hunt large prey and also hunt smaller prey."" The phrase ""ọkara na-eri anụoriri ha ọkara"" implies they are *medium-sized*. The description of them hunting both large and small prey further reinforces this.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị obere nwamba (Small carnivores):** The passage indicates they hunt large prey, so they wouldn't be *only* small carnivores.
*   **B: Ndị nnukwu nwamba (Large carnivores):** The passage states they hunt *both* large and small prey, implying they are not exclusively large.
*   **D: Antelopu gasị (Gazelles):** This is a type of prey, not a type of carnivore.



"
Kedụ anụ ndị a edesitara ka Nwamba nta na-achụkarị?,"The correct answer is **D: Mgbada**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ihe nzuzo nke ọganihu ha bụ gburugburu ebe obibi, ọrụ nwamba niile ji nke na egbochi ịsọmpi ha na ndị ọzọ.""  This translates to: ""The key to their progress is their environment, and all their behaviors serve to prevent competition with others.""

The passage describes these creatures as having unique adaptations that allow them to thrive: they are part reptile, part mammal, have incredibly strong jaws, and eat a variety of small animals. Their success is directly linked to their environment and ability to avoid competition.  While the other options are part of their diet, the passage explicitly points to the **environment (mgbada)** as crucial for their advancement.
"
Kedu n'ime usoro ndị a edesitara abụghị akụkụ usoro ịchụ nta ocelot?,"The correct answer is **C: Ịna-eso anụ ọchọrọ ịgbụ n'abalị**.

Here's why:

* The text states that ocelots have good eyesight during the day but are more secretive and move stealthily. They primarily rely on scent and sound to find prey, not sight during the day.
* Option A (""Ịme ka ya na gburugburu ebe ọnọ dị mma"" - Blending into the surrounding environment) is mentioned in the text as a hunting tactic.
* Option B (""Ịna-eso isi nke anụ ọchọrọ ịgbụ"" - Following the scent of prey) is also mentioned as a method ocelots use.
* Option D (""Ọna-egbukarị naanị anụ dị obere n’nha"" - Primarily hunting smaller prey) is implied in the text (""Oka-na-onuogugu anu anumanu nile Ocelot na achu-nta di obere nnukwu karia ka odi"" - Ocelots are typically smaller than large cats).

Therefore, following prey *during the day* contradicts the text's description of ocelots' hunting habits.
"
Kedu nke na-akọwapụtaghị oselọt kpọmkwem?,"The correct answer is **C: Ọganị ha ji anụ isi adịghị ike** (They only hunt weak prey).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Oka-na-onuogugu anu anumanu nile Ocelot na achu-nta di obere nnukwu karia ka odi."" (The cunning Ocelot hunts small prey that is larger than them). It also mentions they use scent to find prey and are good hunters.  The passage **does not** say they *only* hunt weak prey.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha nwere ikikere ịchụ anụ n’abalị** (They hunt during the day): The passage says they are better at hunting at night and move stealthily.
*   **B: Ha na-eje ije nwayọọ** (They walk softly): The passage states they move stealthily, not necessarily softly.
*   **D: Ha kara nabata ịchụ ụmụ obere anụ** (They have a preference for hunting young animals): The passage doesn't specify a preference for young animals.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that is **not** supported by the provided passage."
Olee n'ime ederede ndị a ka na-enweghị ka ike kacahsi ukwu nke agụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịti mkpu**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ome ihe egwuregwu zuruoke nkeoma, agu ahu ga enyili elu (obu ezie na obughi nkeoma), gwuo mmiri, maa-amaa garuo ebe di oke anya ma doo okpukpu ise dika ike mmadu di ike nwere ike ido.

This indicates that roaring is *not* a characteristic of the large cats (lions, tigers, leopards, jaguars) as it's more like a vocalization of speech than a roar. The other options (running, climbing, pouncing, and swatting) are all actions they *do*.
"
"N’isonye ka mpaghara akwụkwọ si dee, olee ederede kọwara ọdịche n'etiti agụ na ọdụm?","The correct answer is **B: Ka mkpu si ada**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""gwuo mmiri, maa-amaa garuo ebe di oke anya ma doo okpukpu ise dika ike mmadu di ike nwere ike ido."" This describes how a lion hunts - by ambushing prey, waiting for it to approach a certain distance, and then pouncing. 

The passage also says: ""Ụja agụ adịghị ka mgbọpụta n'uju ụja ọdụm, mana ọ dị nnọọ ka okwu e kwuputara n'iti mkpu."" This implies that the lion's roar is different from a tiger's, suggesting a distinct vocalization.

The question asks about the *difference* between lions and tigers.  While hunting prowess and roar strength might be factors, the passage explicitly connects the lion's ""roar"" with the ambush tactic and contrasts it with the tiger's vocalization.  Therefore, the difference in their **roar** is the most directly supported answer.


Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ike ha ji egwo mmiri** - The passage describes ambush tactics, not water-based hunting.
*   **C: Ebe ha eru ma ha malie elu** - This describes the pouncing action of a lion, not a difference between lions and tigers.
*   **D: Ike ha jị akpụta ihe** - While hunting is related to their ability to ""strike,"" the passage doesn't directly compare the *strength* of their striking abilities. The focus is on the hunting *method*.



"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a si kwuo, olee ihe Robert Hooke mere tupu bayolọgisti ndị ọzọ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ hụtara celu ndị nwụrụ anwụ**.

The text states: ""Robert Hooke, ọka mmụta ihe banyere ndụ si na Ịnglandị, hụrụ obere ǹkomgbaànoǹhà n’ime okwuchi n’iji otu mikroskopu. Ha dị ka obere ụlọ. Ya bụ onye mbụ nyochara seelụ nwụrụ anwụ.""

This clearly indicates that Hooke was the first to observe dead cells.
"
Olee ihe ntọala okwu a “celu” pụtara?,"The correct answer is **B: Ụlọ dị obere**.

The passage states: ""Seelụ si n'okwu Latịn bụ sela nke pụtara obere ụlọ."" This directly translates to ""Cell is from the Latin word cell meaning small house.""
"
"Dị ka edemede a si kwuo, olee ihe k’ọtụtụ ụmụ anụmanụ nwegasịrị ike ịme?","The correct answer is **C: Ị gwo mmiri**.

The passage states: ""Anụmanụ ndị ka n'ọnụ ọgụgụ nwere ike ịga ije. Sọ anụmanụ nwere ụbụrụ (kama ọbụghị anụmanụ nile; jelifish bụ ọmụma atụ nke a). Anụmanụ gburugburu ụwa nile. Ha na-egwu ala, gwuo mmiri n'oke osimiri, ma fekwaa n'ikuku.""

The passage explicitly mentions that many animals can swim in the ocean.  The other options are not mentioned as capabilities of many animals.
"
"Dị ka esi dee n’edemede akwụkwọ a, olee ihe ụfọdụ ụmụ anụmanụ na-enweghị?","The correct answer is **C: Ụbụrụ (Limbs)**.

The text states: ""Sọ anụmanụ nwere ụbụrụ (kama ọbụghị anụmanụ nile; jelifish bụ ọmụma atụ nke a)."" This directly indicates that not all animals have limbs.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Celụ (Cells):** The text says animals are *made up* of cells, not that they *don't have* them.
* **B: Ikikere igbari nrị (Bones):** While many animals have bones, the text doesn't say they all do, and it doesn't mention bones as something lacking.
* **D: Ikikere ịrị nri (The ability to eat):** The text says animals *eat* things, so they have this ability.

Therefore, the only thing the text explicitly states that *not all* animals have is limbs.
"
Gịnị na-enyere osisi aka n’oge fotosynthesisi?,"The correct answer is **D: Anyanwụ**.

Here's why:

* **Photosynthesis** is the process where plants use sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide to create their own food (sugars) and release oxygen. 
* The question asks what helps with photosynthesis. Sunlight is a key ingredient in this process.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndo (Water):** While water is *needed* for photosynthesis, it's not what *powers* the process. Sunlight is.
* **B: Ụmụ anụmanụ (Animals):** Animals are dependent on plants for food and oxygen, but they don't directly contribute to photosynthesis.
* **C: Nrị (Soil):** Soil provides nutrients to the plant, which are important for growth, but it doesn't directly power photosynthesis.



"
Olee ihe ndị mmadụ na-ekupu n’ume ma osisi na-ekuru ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Kabọn dioxidi**.

Here's why:

* The question states that people exhale carbon dioxide (""mmadụ na-ekufu ume"").
* The question also states that trees take in carbon dioxide (""Osisi na-eme ikuku oksigin nke mmadụ na-ekuru, ma ha na e kubanye carbon-dioxide nke mmadụ na-ekufu ume"").

Therefore, people exhale carbon dioxide, and trees take it in.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime ihe ọmụmatụ ndị a nwere ikeị gbochi usoro evolushọn?","The correct answer is **C: Ịhazịgharị mgbanwe pọpuleshọn n’etiti ịnvịrọnmenti ọhụrụ (Migration of a population between new environments)**.

Here's why:

* **Speciation requires isolation:** The passage states that for speciation to occur, a population needs to be isolated from its parent population. Migration to a new environment creates this isolation.  If a portion of a population migrates and establishes itself in a new environment, it can begin to evolve independently.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Obere otu dara ịmelite n’ebe ọhụrụ (Small population is more likely to evolve in a new place):** While small populations *can* evolve faster due to genetic drift, this doesn't *block* speciation. Speciation requires isolation, not necessarily a small population size.
* **B: Akụkụ nke otu pọpuleshọn ịgagharị n’ịnvịrọnmenti ọhụrụ (A portion of a population migrates to a new environment):**  Migration is a *necessary step* in speciation, it doesn't *block* it. It initiates the process.
* **D: Otu pọpuleshọn emechaa mụta abụọ (A population can learn twice):** Learning is a form of cultural evolution and is not directly relevant to biological speciation, which is driven by genetic changes.



"
Kedu n'ime ederede ndị a na-ekwuputaghị kpọmkwem usoro nke specieshọnụ? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ọ na-atụ aka n’imeputa spechie ọhụrụ.**

Here's why:

* The passage *defines* speciation as the *formation of new species*. It describes the process of how populations diverge due to different environments and competition, ultimately leading to distinct species. Option C directly reflects this definition.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mgbe pọpụleshọn ọhụrụ enweghị ike igbanwe ka ọn-apụta:** While the passage mentions the need for adaptation, it doesn't focus on the *inability* of new populations to adapt. It focuses on *how* they adapt differently to different environments.
* **B: Ọ bụ nnukwu ihe dị mkpa nke usoro evolushọn:** The passage explicitly states that speciation is a crucial outcome of evolution, but this option is too general. It doesn't pinpoint what speciation *is*.
* **D: Mpụta ya bụ ihe na-enweghị ike ịgbachịbido:** The passage describes speciation as a *process* that occurs over time.  It's not presented as a one-time event that can't be reversed. Speciation, while leading to distinct species, is a gradual development.



"
Olee akụkụ nke cekuletịrị sistemụ na-enwebata ọbara na ngbagote obi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kapịlarị**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tuubu ndị a na-akpọ kapịlarị."" (These tubes are called capillaries.)
* **Capillaries are defined as:** The smallest blood vessels that connect arteries and veins. They are where the exchange of oxygen, nutrients, and waste products happens.
* **The question asks:** Which part of the circulatory system *absorbs* blood from the heart? Capillaries are the vessels that directly connect to the heart (via arteries) and receive blood from it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Atịrịsị (Atrium):**  Atria are chambers *within* the heart that receive blood. They don't absorb blood from the heart; they receive it.
* **C: Ọgansị (Organ):** This is too general. While the heart *is* an organ, the question is about a specific part of the circulatory system responsible for absorbing blood.
* **D: Venu (Vein):** Veins carry blood *to* the heart, not absorb blood from it.



"
Olee tubu kachasị obere na cekuletiri sistemụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Kapịlarị (Capillaries)**.

The passage states: ""Tuubu ndị kachasị obere ka a na-akpọ kapịlarị."" which translates to ""The smallest tubes are called capillaries.""
"
Olee n’ime ndesịta ndịa bụ ihe na-emelite site n’ikikere ahụhụ ji apịkọlata nku ha?,"The correct answer is **D: Ike ife efe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the ability to project their tongues helps lizards escape predators and find food and allies.  This ability is directly linked to the ""ike ife efe"" which translates to ""feathery power"" or ""explosive force"" in this context.  The tongue projection is the mechanism through which they use this power.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ịnye nri (Finding food):** While tongue projection helps find food, it's not the *mechanism* by which the tongue helps.
* **B: Ịzo oghere (Escaping the hole):**  The tongue projection is useful for escaping predators, but the passage emphasizes its role in both predation and socializing.
* **C: Ịchọta ndị otu (Finding allies):** Again, tongue projection aids in finding allies, but it's not the core mechanism the passage highlights.



"
Olee ihe ana-ekwụghị na ndesịta ka ihe ife efe nke ahụhụ na-agbanwe ọnọdụ ya?,"The correct answer is **C: Mkpokọta ihe oriri (Body mass)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the agility and speed of the phoenixes allow them to escape predators and find food and allies easily.  A key feature mentioned is their ability to retract their feathers.  This implies a change in their body structure.

Of the options:

* **A: Ọmụmụ (Size)** - While a phoenix might change size slightly, the focus is not on overall growth or shrinkage.
* **B: Oge ndụ (Lifespan)** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the length of a phoenix's life.
* **C: Mkpokọta ihe oriri (Body mass)** - The ability to retract feathers directly impacts their body mass and agility. Reducing feather mass would make them lighter and more agile.
* **D: Ịrụ ọrụ ka nke ọma (Performance)** - While agility is a performance aspect, the passage focuses on *how* they achieve this, which is the change in feather structure.

Therefore, the most logical answer is that the passage *doesn't* mention how the agility and speed gained from the feathers affect the *total body mass* of the phoenixes.



"
Olee n’ime njirimara ndị a ka a na-abụghị maka dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **B: Nkuku**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""They have claws on their wings and forelimbs, they also have feathers, and they also walk on their two hind legs like a T-Rex.""

This indicates that feathers, claws, and walking on two legs were characteristics of these bird-like dinosaurs.

* **Dinosaurs did *not* have knees.**  The passage describes the birds as having ""legs,"" which implies a joint at the knee, but dinosaurs did not have knees as we understand them. They had a different skeletal structure.



Therefore, the answer is **B: Nkuku**."
Olee n’ime ndesịta ndịa ka na-anaghị ahụtakarị dịka njirimara nnụnụ na dinosaurs na-ekekọrịta?,"The correct answer is **D: Mkpisi ụkwụ nwere mgbagọ (Ankle spurs)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...They have claws on their feet and wings, they also run on two legs like the T-Rex."" This directly links birds and dinosaurs through having claws and running on two legs.
* **The passage mentions:** ""...They have claws on their feet, and wings, they also run on two legs like the T-Rex."" This indicates that the passage emphasizes the resemblance in foot structure, specifically claws, and bipedalism (walking on two legs) as shared characteristics.
* **Ankle spurs** are bony projections on the ankle. While some birds *do* have them, they are **not** a common or defining characteristic shared between birds and dinosaurs. The other options are more prominently mentioned as similarities.
* **Claws:** The passage explicitly states birds have claws.
* **Bipedalism (walking on two legs):** The passage directly compares birds to T-Rex in terms of walking on two legs.
* **Ability to fly:** The passage mentions wings, indicating the ability to fly.

Therefore, ankle spurs are the least frequently mentioned shared trait between birds and dinosaurs in the passage.



"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a sị kwu, olee akụkụ osisi cycad nke riceratops nwere ike iri?","The correct answer is **A: Akwụkwọ osisi spikie (Spiky trunk)**.

The passage states that Triceratops could break not only the tree trunks but also the branches and strong roots. It also mentions that some scientists believe Triceratops ate cycads, which are trees with thick, spiky trunks and feathery leaves. The passage specifically mentions the Triceratops using its strong beak to bite and break the spiky trunk.

While they *might* have also eaten branches or roots, the passage highlights the trunk as a key part they targeted.  The other options (branches, roots, and seeds) are not as specifically mentioned as being eaten by the Triceratops.
"
"Dị ka mpaghara akwụkwọ a sị kwu, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a edesịtara ka Triceratops nwekarịrị ike iri? ","The correct answer is **B: Osisi nwere alaka siri ike**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Triceratops could break not only tree trunks but also strong branches. It also mentions that some scientists believe Triceratops used their horns to stab the trunks of these trees. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Sloth** - Sloths are not mentioned in relation to Triceratops' diet or the type of trees they ate.
*   **C: Parot** - Parot is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: Osisi nwere mkpụrụ osisi na-egbu egbu (Poisonous trees)** - The passage notes that even though sloths eat damaged trees, no dinosaur specifically avoids trees that other dinosaurs don't eat. This implies that the trees were likely not poisonous.

Therefore, the passage directly links Triceratops' ability to eat trees to **strong branches**."
"N’isonye n’ederede n’akwụkwọ a, olee n'ime egwuregwu ndị edesịtara bụ ọkachamara na mpaghara ugwu Italị?","The correct answer is **A: Footubọọlụ**.

The passage states that football (futbọọlụ) and basketball are the most successful sports in Italy and Germany, and Italy is known for its success in international competitions, including the 2006 World Cup.  The passage also explicitly mentions football as a popular winter sport in Italy. The other options (volleyball, snowboarding, and F1 moto racing) are either not mentioned specifically in the context of Italy's sporting dominance or are less directly associated with Italy's overall sporting prowess compared to football."
"N’isonye n’ozi dị n’akwụkwọ a, olee n’ime egwuregwu ndị a nwere mmerị na asọmpi ụwa maka Italị?","The correct answer is **A: Footubọọlụ**.

The text explicitly states that Italy and Germany are the most successful in **football** (futbọọlụ) in international competitions and won the 2006 World Cup. The text also mentions Italy's success in international and Olympic competitions in various sports, including football. The other options (water polo, basketball, fencing) are mentioned as sports Italy participates in but are not highlighted as their most successful in international competitions *as stated in the text*.

* The passage explicitly states, ""Luxembourg na-agbalị kwa mgbe ị bụ obodo nọrọ onwe ha..."" This directly points to the desire for independence and self-governance.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ọrụ Germany:** While Germany occupied Luxembourg during both World Wars, the passage focuses more on Luxembourg's struggle for independence *despite* German influence.
* **B: Ịsoro otu European Union:** Joining the EU is a significant event in Luxembourg's history, but the passage highlights the earlier, long-standing desire for self-rule.
* **C: Revolushọnụ nke Belgian:** The passage mentions that the area was part of Belgium, but the key point isn't the Belgian Revolution itself, but how the political changes led to Luxembourg eventually asserting its independence.

Olee sukwiya kilomita nke ngụkọta mpaghara Turkey nọ na Europe?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage states: ""...sụkwịya kilomita 23,764 (sụkwịya maịlụ 9174) anọrọ na Yuropu.""
"
"N’isonye n’ederede n’akwụkwọ a, olee ogologo maịlị ka Turkey di?","The correct answer is **A: 1600**.

The passage states: ""Okeala Turkey karịrị kilomita 1600 (1000 mi) n'ogologo..."" which translates to ""Asia Minor Turkey is over 1600 kilometers (1000 miles) long...""  Therefore, 1600 miles is the correct answer.
"
Olee ihe e ji asụsụ Latin eme na n'obodo Vatican?,"The correct answer is **A: Emume okpukperechi (Religious ceremonies)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Asụsụ Latin ka ọtụtụ ndị na-arụ ọrụ na steeti na-asụkwa kwa ụbọchị ebe a na-asụkarị Latin n’emume ndị ụka ga."" (Latin is spoken daily by many people working in the state, and Latin is often used in religious ceremonies).
"
"Na Vatikan Citi, kedu ihe anaghị eji Italian eme?","The correct answer is **C: Emume okpukperechi (Religious ceremonies)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Asụsụ Itali ka ọtụtụ ndị na-arụ ọrụ na steeti na-asụkwa kwa ụbọchị ebe a na-asụkarị Latin n’emume ndị ụka ga."" This means Latin is commonly used in religious ceremonies (emume okpukperechi) in Vatican City, while Italian is used for daily communication.



"
"N’isonye n’ederede n’akwụkwọ a, kedu ihe bụ ihenrịta uru nke ana-enweta na-ịgwakọrịta ụda na kọmpụta dị ike?","The correct answer is **A: Egwu (Music)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A na-edekọkarị egwu n’iji kọmputa ọkaibe iji hazie ma wụrikọta ụda ọnụ."" This translates to: ""Music is often recorded using a computer sound card to be edited and mixed.""

Therefore, the benefit mentioned is related to music production and creation.

The other options are not mentioned as benefits of recording/mixing audio on a computer:

*   **B: Anịmeshọn (Animation)** - Not mentioned in the text.
*   **C: Foto (Photos)** -  The text mentions photos and videos *not* being able to be displayed, but doesn't say anything about photo editing.
*   **D: Nwube ihe (3D Modeling)** - Not mentioned in the text.

"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ebe ọtụtụ ụlọ dị na ya nwere ụlọ mposi a na-afụlọshị afụlọshị?","The correct answer is **A: Na Mohenjọ-daro**.

The passage states: ""P: Ọ fọrọ obere ka ụlọ niile dị n'obodo Harappa na Mohenjo-daro nwee mpochi mmiri, ya na usoro mkpopu kara aka."" This directly tells us that a large number of houses with toilets were found in Mohenjo-daro. While other locations had toilets, Mohenjo-daro is specifically mentioned as having them in *most* houses.
"
Kedu n’ime obodo ndị a ka ana-enweta sistemu nsị dị elu?,"The correct answer is **A: Na Harappa**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ọ fọrọ obere ka ụlọ niile dị n'obodo Harappa na Mohenjo-daro nwee mpochi mmiri, ya na usoro mkpopu kara aka."" (It is believed that almost all houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had wells and were connected by a drainage system.)

* While the passage mentions wells in Santorini, Egypt, Persia, and China, it doesn't state that they had *advanced* drainage systems like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro.  The focus of the question is on advanced systems.

Therefore, Harappa is the only city mentioned with a clearly described and advanced drainage system.
"
Gịnị n'ime ihe ndị a edesịtara na-eme ka onye sketa tụgharịa?,"The correct answer is **B: Akụkụ gbara abụọ dị n'ịhụ sketi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Akụkụ abụọ a na-eme ka o jide aịz nke ọma karịa, ma mgbe o hulatara n'otu akụkụ. N'ihi na okpuru agụba ahụ rọrọ arọ nwa obere, ka agụba ahụ na-arọje n'otu akụkụ maọbụ nke ọzọ, akụkụ ahu nke na-emetụ mkprụ mmiri ga arọkwa. Nke a na-eme ka onye na-agba skeeti tụgharịa.""

This directly links the two sides of the skate to the cause of the turn. The two sides help grip the ice, and when the skate leans, the side that contacts the ice is what causes the turn.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Nrugo nta dị n’ala nke dị n’ihu sketi** - While the skate's angle is important, the passage focuses on the *two sides* of the skate.
*   **C: Ọkwa nka niile nke sketa** - The skater's overall balance is important, but the passage highlights the specific role of the skate's design.
*   **D: Ụdịdị nke izi** - The type of blade is relevant to skating in general, but it's not the *direct* cause of the turn described in the passage.



"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ndesịta kọwapụtara kpọmkwem oghere dị n’ihu sketi izi ọgbara ọhụrụ?","The answer is **B: Ihụ rụgọrọ arụgọCurved (Curved Concave)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the ice skate as having two curved openings on the inside. These openings are crucial for holding the skate securely. The passage also explains how the curve of the skate helps with turning – as the ice wears down, the curved surface allows the skater to easily shift their weight and turn.

Therefore, the correct description of the shape of the opening is a curved concave shape.  Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ihu gbara abụọ (Two flat surfaces):**  The passage explicitly states the openings are *curved*.
*   **C: Ịhu kọnkevu (Conical surface):** While there's a concave element, the shape isn't generally described as a full cone.
*   **D: Ihụ dị tietedi (Tapered surface):** Tapered refers to something gradually becoming narrower towards one end, which isn't the primary shape described.



"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe bụ usoro na-enye atọmụ oghere ịwepụ ike karịrị n’ọkụ?","The correct answer is **B: Kpalitere mgbapụta nke foton (Triggered photon emission)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ha na-eme nkea site na-ịgbasa obere urughuru ọkụ a na akpọ """"fotọn"""". Ndị ọkammụta sayensị kpọrọ usoro a """"mkpalite mmepụta radiyeshọnụ""""..."" This means the process of releasing photons is the key to the atoms losing energy.
* ""Kpalitere mgbapụta nke foton"" accurately describes this process.  It's the *triggering* of photons that leads to energy loss.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Radieshọnụ (Radiation)**: While the passage mentions ""radiyeshọnụ,"" it's a broader term encompassing the whole process.  The specific process of energy loss *through photon emission* is what the question asks about.
* **C: Foton (Photon)**:  A photon is a particle of light, *released* during the process, but not the process itself.
* **D: Kpalitere mgbapụta nke radieshọnụ (Triggered radiation emission)**: This is incorrect because the passage focuses on *photon* emission as the energy loss mechanism, not general radiation.



"
Olee ihe na-akpalite atọmụ ịwepụta foton?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịweputa ike dị ukwuu**.

The passage states: ""Ma ha chọ ịlaghachi n'ogugo ike ha nọbụ na ya, ha ga ewepụrịrị ike ha natara ọkụ. Ha na-eme nkea site na-ịgbasa obere urughuru ọkụ a na akpọ """"fotọn"""".

This means that atoms release photons when they lose energy. The passage further indicates that atoms release photons when they lose energy, which is linked to the loss of ""ike dị ukwuu"" (a lot of energy).  Therefore, the loss of a lot of energy is what triggers the release of photons from atoms.

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **B: Mkpalite si n’ọkụ na-acha nke ọma:** The passage doesn't mention ""ọkụ na-acha nke ọma"" (colored light).
*   **C: Nha ike na-anọghị otu ebe:** The passage doesn't mention ""nha ike na-anọghị otu ebe"" (uneven energy).
*   **D: Nkwụsara di ọjọọ maka radieshon:** The passage doesn't mention ""nkwụsara di ọjọọ maka radieshon"" (bad insulation for radiation).

"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe nwere ike ịme ka ọkụ bọlbụ ọrụ?","The correct answer is **B: Isi metalụ bọlbụ abanyeghị nke ọma na sọketi**.

Here's why:

* **The problem:** The bulb filament burned out and the bulb stopped working. The question asks how to fix it *after* the power switch has been turned off and the bulb removed.
* **Why B is correct:** If the metal contacts inside the bulb aren't making proper contact with the socket, electricity can't flow.  This is a very common reason for a bulb to fail, even if the filament is good.  Removing the bulb and ensuring good contact is a straightforward fix.
* **Why the other options are less likely:**
    * **A: E nweghị ike igbanyụ ọkụ fisichọ n’usoro ziri ezi:** The prompt explicitly states the power switch *has* been turned off.
    * **C: Filamenti dị n'ime bọlbụ na-ere ọkụ:** The prompt *states* the filament burned out. This is the reason the bulb stopped working in the first place, not the reason it won't work *after* the switch is off.
    * **D: Ebelatara k’ọkụ eletriki si ewụba na sọketi:**  While this is a serious safety concern, the question doesn't provide any information to suggest a blown fuse. It's less likely to be the immediate reason a bulb that's been removed won't work.



Therefore, the most logical next step to get the bulb working is to check and ensure the metal contacts are properly seated in the socket.



"
Kedu na ndesịta ndịa bụ ihe nwere ike ịmebi ihe maobụrụna ịkpatụ ya aka oge ịna-agbanwe bọlbụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Isi bọlbụ (Bulb base)**.

Here's why:

* The question describes the filament burning out and the bulb not working. This directly points to a problem within the bulb itself, specifically the base where the filament is connected.
* **Bulb base** is the part of the bulb that screws into the socket.  If the base is damaged, it could be easily broken during a bulb change. 

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Filament:** The problem states the filament *burned out*, not that the filament itself was damaged by something else.
* **B: Swichi ọkụ (Light switch):** The question implies the problem happened *during* a bulb change, not with the switch itself.  While a faulty switch *could* cause issues, it's less directly related to the immediate cause of a burnt-out bulb filament.
* **D: Kebulu (Cable):** While a cable issue *could* cause a problem, the symptoms are much more specific to a bulb failure than a cable issue.



Therefore, the most likely thing to be damaged during a bulb change, leading to the bulb not working, is the bulb base.



"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, olee ihe na-eme oge a gbawara nucleus?","The correct answer is **D: Atụfuru Neutụrọnụ (Neutrons are emitted)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that some atoms have unstable nuclei (meaning they are not stable).  Unstable nuclei decay to become stable. One common way for this to happen is by emitting neutrons. This process reduces the nucleus's energy and can lead to a more stable configuration.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: E nwetara puroton (Protons are emitted):** While protons *can* be emitted, the passage mentions that the nucleus is unstable, and neutrons are a common way to achieve stability. It doesn't specifically state protons are the only way.
*   **B: A tọhapụrụ ike (Energy is released):**  Energy *is* released during nuclear decay, but this is a *result* of the decay, not the primary *action* that causes the nucleus to break apart.
*   **C: Atọm anaghị anọ otu ebe (Atoms are not in one place):** This is not a direct description of what happens when a nucleus breaks apart. It's a vague statement not related to the process of nuclear decay.



"
Kedu n’ihe ndịa edesitara na-egosiputa ogologo oge ikpọghachị azụ n’ụwa,"The correct answer is **B: Setiliti (Satellite)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes satellites as crucial for long-distance communication.** It explicitly states that satellites are used to relay phone calls across vast distances (hundreds of miles).
* **The passage mentions satellites being launched into space by rockets.** This further reinforces their role in long-distance communication.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **Telescopu (Telescope):** Telescopes are used for observing distant objects, not relaying phone calls.
    * **Ọkụ (Heat):** The passage mentions the Earth losing heat, but heat isn't related to long-distance phone calls.
    * **Rọketi (Rocket):** Rockets are used to launch satellites, but they aren't the means of communication themselves.

Therefore, satellites are the key component discussed in the passage that enables long-distance phone calls, explaining the long delay.



"
Olee ihe eji-etinye teliskop na speci?,"The correct answer is **D: Satelliti karịrị elu 100 fiti**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It takes a large rocket to travel over a hundred feet high to put one satellite and telescope in space."" Therefore, telescopes are placed on satellites that are launched into space, exceeding 100 feet (which is a very small height compared to space).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bimi ọkụ (Fire)** - Fire is not related to placing telescopes in space.
*   **B: Rọketi (Rocket)** - Rockets *launch* the satellites, but the telescope itself isn't *put* on the rocket. It's attached to the satellite.
*   **C: Ikuku ụwa (Earth's Atmosphere)** - Telescopes are placed *above* the Earth's atmosphere, in space."
Kedu ihe ekwuru maka mmemme sikulikul iji nyochaa ngafe oge?,"The correct answer is **C: Na-emetụta**.

This means cyclical patterns *allow* you to perceive the passage of time. They are a way we track and understand time's flow. Therefore, the cyclical patterns **affect** our perception of time.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Dureshọn (Duration):** While cyclical patterns might be *related* to duration, the passage doesn't directly say they *define* or *are* duration.
*   **B: Nmeghasị (Negate):** This means to deny or contradict, which is the opposite of what the passage implies.
*   **D: Ihe isi ike (Difficult thing):** The passage presents cyclical patterns as a mechanism for understanding time, not as a difficult concept.



"
"Isonye ka esi dee n’akụkụ akwụkwọ a, kedụ ihe eji atụnyere oge n’ihe mmemme?","The correct answer is **B: Nmegharị (Cycles)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""You can recognize time for yourself by observing the recurring repetition of a cyclical event. A cyclical event is something that happens over and over again at regular intervals.""

Therefore, the passage compares time to **cycles**. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ogologo (Length)** - While time *can* be measured in length, the passage focuses on its cyclical nature.
*   **C: Iheahụrụ (Reality)** -  The passage doesn't frame time as reality, but as a way of understanding sequential events.
*   **D: Na-emetụta (Influential)** - The passage mentions that time *affects* everything, but it's not the central comparison being made.

Here's why:

* **The question asks what is appropriate to mention about someone who is a war veteran.** The passage states Charles got a 2:2 degree. This is a factual detail about his academic achievement, which is relevant to include.
* **Option B** is irrelevant. The passage states he *was* a war veteran, but doesn't say anything about leaving the military.
* **Option C** is not mentioned in the passage.
* **Option D** is true, but doesn't provide information *about* the veteran themselves, only a timeline.  The 2:2 degree is a more directly relevant piece of information.

Therefore, mentioning his 2:2 degree is a relevant and appropriate detail to include when describing Charles in an article."
"Kedụ ihe izizi Charles buru ụzọ mee, sitena ozi dị n’akwụkwọ a?","The correct answer is **B: Ọ gụrụ akwụkwọ Akịọlọjii.**

The passage states: ""Charles gara mahadum na Trinity College, Cambridge ebe ọ gụrụ Anthropology na Archaeology..."" This directly indicates that Charles initially pursued studies in Anthropology and Archaeology.

The passage explicitly states: ""...na gbakwunye otu mkpụrụ edemede """"Õ/õ""""."" This means the Estonian language gained the character Õ/õ.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mkpụrụedemede German:** While German was the basis, the question asks what *relates* to the Estonian language. The character Õ/õ is a specific feature.
* **C: German monks:** The monks *influenced* the language, but the question asks what's *related* to the language itself.
* **D: Chukwu:** While the monks encouraged devotion to God, this is not directly related to the development of the Estonian language.

The passage explicitly states: ""Onu ogugu nwaafọ ndị na-asụ asusu ahụ dịgasị iche na-ndabere na ma ọ bụrụ na aguru ma olumba ndị nwere mmetụta chiri anya."" This means the *number of speakers* is being discussed, and the passage refers to ""olumba dịka Hindi"" (speakers of Hindi).  The passage then provides a range for the number of speakers.

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Ma ọbụrụ na agụọ ndị ọsụ asụsụ Urdu:**  The passage clarifies that Hindi and Urdu are related but distinct.  Asking about Urdu speakers doesn't directly explain the number of Hindi speakers.
* **C: Ma ọbụrụ na agụọ ndị nwere ike ịghọta asụsụ:** This is too broad.  The passage focuses on the number of *speakers*, not just those who understand it.
* **D: Ma ọbụrụ na agụọ ndị nwere ike ịgụta asụsụ ahụ:** Again, this is too narrow.  The question is about *speakers*, not just those who can read.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndị asụsụ abụọ na-enwekarị nkewa (There is usually a disconnect between speakers of both languages):** While the text mentions differences, it doesn't directly state a disconnect in understanding. It says speakers *can* understand each other to some extent, especially in written form.
* **B: Sikripti ha dị iche iche (Their scripts are different):** The text doesn't mention different scripts.

This clearly indicates King Sejong *invented* Hangeul, not that it was discovered or found.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: E bidoro ya n’oge mbido ọchịchị Eze Sejong** - The passage explicitly states it was invented during his reign (1444).
* **B: Hunan Jeongeum bụ aha ziri ezi ana-akpọ mkpụrụedemede ya** - The passage directly says ""akara edemede Hangeul, Hunmin Jeongeum..."".

* **B: Mbugharị Aryan (Aryan Migration):** While the text mentions the Aryan migration as one theory of Sanskrit's origin, it doesn't state that *migration* was what enabled its use.
* **C: Asụsụ Latin (Latin Language):** The text compares Sanskrit to Latin, but it doesn't say Latin was used *to* create Sanskrit.

* **Gravity on Io:** Io is a moon of Jupiter known for having a much stronger gravitational pull than Earth.
* **Therefore:**  If you were on Io, the stronger gravity would pull on you with more force.  To counteract that stronger pull, you would need to wear heavier equipment (like a stronger suit or more powerful boots) to stay grounded.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gụravit ụwa na-akpụlata obere na gị karịa gụraviti Io:** The text says the *opposite* - you'd weigh *less* on Io.
* **B: Gụraviti Io na-akpụkarị ihe, nke mere ị ga ewelata ịso ya:**  While true that gravity is a force pulling you down, the statement about needing to *wear* heavier equipment is not directly supported by the text. The text focuses on the *effect* of gravity, not specific equipment.
* **D: Gụravit ụwa ga-akpụtarị ihe na gị karịa gụraviti Io:** This is the opposite of what the text implies about weight differences.

* **B: Akpụkpọ anụ dị gịrịgịrị n'okpuru ugwu:** The passage mentions lava flows on the crust, not skin under mountains.
* **D: Enwere ike n’okpuru ala d elu:** The passage focuses on maria on the *surface* (near side) and how the crust cracks, not about something going down and up.

This translates to: ""The outer shell of the moon is called the crust. The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and about 100 km thick on the far side.""

Therefore, the crust (the outer shell) is thickest on the **near side** of the moon.

"Isonyere ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee akụkọ n'ime nkwuputa a gasị ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ nabatara?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị mmadụ agatụla na kpakpando ndị ọzọ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the discovery of microbial life on other planets.** It states that the discovery was made on a planet orbiting a distant star and that it's a rare event that might not happen again for a very long time. The phrase ""Ndị mmadụ agatụla na kpakpando ndị ọzọ"" (People have landed on other planets) accurately reflects this core idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndị mmadụ enweghị ike ilebachara ụwa ndị ọzọ anya** - The passage doesn't say humans *couldn't* see other worlds, it describes the discovery of life *on* another world.
* **C: Pụlaneti ndị ọzọ nwere ndụ na ha** - While true according to the passage, it's a more specific detail than the overarching point. The key takeaway is the discovery of life *on* another planet.
* **D: Enwere ihe na-erughị trillion mili n'etiti kpakpando gasị** - This refers to the vast number of asteroids mentioned, which is a separate detail not central to the main point about discovering life.



"
Kedu ihe na-epekarị mpe maọbụrụna ịna-agata etiti Anyanwụ aka?,"The correct answer is **C: Gasị**.

The text states: ""Anyanwụ niile bụ ụmụ gaasị..."" which translates to ""The Aurora is made up of gases..."". It also says the gas is ""gịrịrị ka ị ga-aga site n’etiti anyanwụ"" meaning it stretches like you're traveling through the center of the Aurora. Therefore, the Aurora is primarily composed of gas.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pụlasima (Plasma):** While plasma is *part* of the Aurora, the text doesn't identify it as the primary component.
*   **B: Ọkụ (Fire):** The text describes the Aurora as ""bọọlụ nke ọkụ"" (""ball of fire"") but it is not simply fire. It's gas heated to extremely high temperatures.
*   **D: Kụrọstụ (Frost):** Frost is ice, which has nothing to do with the Aurora's composition.



"
"Ịsonyere ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, kedụ mpaghara anyanwụ ka a na-ahụta anya site n’Ụwa?","The correct answer is **C: Ọ bụ Fotosfee**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mpaghara mputa nkea anyi ahu ma anyi lee Anyanwu anya ka ana akpo **photospere**, wka putara """"bọọlụ nke ọkụ"""".""  Photosphere is the layer of the sun that we see. The text directly links the ""photospere"" to the sun, which is the same as what we see when we look at the sun in the sky.
"
Kedu n'ime nchọpụta ndị a edeputara nyere aka kwado ozizi Copernicus?,"The correct answer is **A: Akụkụ nke Venusu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ka e mechara n’ihe dịka afọ puku atọ, na 1610, Onye Itali bụ ọkammuta n'amụmamụ mabaraigwe Galileo Galilei jiri teleskopụ wee nyote na Venus nwere agba ga, dịka ọnwa nwere. Usoro feezi na-eme n’ihi naanị akụkụ Venus (ma ọ bụ nke Ọnwa) chewere ihu n’Anyanwụ ahụ mụnyere ọkụ.""  This directly links Galileo's observation of Venus's phases to supporting Copernicus's heliocentric theory.  The phases of Venus are only possible if Venus orbits the Sun, not the Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Njem ngafe nke Venusu (Transit of Venus):**  While a transit of Venus is a valuable astronomical event, it was observed by Jeremiah Horrocks in 1639 *after* the initial observations that supported Copernicus.  It didn't directly *cause* the acceptance of Copernicus's theory.
* **C: Oyịyị anyanwụ na Venusu (Full Moon on Venus):** The passage mentions phases of Venus, *not* a full moon. 
* **D: Oyịyị anyanwụ na ọnwa (Full Moon on the Moon):** This is irrelevant to the question of supporting Copernicus.



"
Gini ka Galileo Galilei chọpụtara na 1610?,"The correct answer is **B: Akụkụ nke Venusu**.

The passage states that Galileo observed that Venus had phases like the moon, meaning only certain portions of Venus were illuminated as it moved in front of the sun. This observation supported Copernicus's heliocentric theory.
"
"N’isonyere ederede akwụkwọ a, olee ebe Osimiri Amazọnụ si enwebata mmiri?","The correct answer is **A: Osimiri ndị dịgasị nta**.

The text states: ""Ọ na-ewetaju mmiri site n’ọtụtụ puku osimiri ndị kara di obere.""  This translates to ""It receives water from many smaller rivers.""
"
Olee akụkọ otito anaghị enye Osimiri Amazọnụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọ bụ osimiri kachasị obosara** (It is the smallest river).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Osimiri Amazọn bụ nke abụọ kachasị ogologo na osimiri kachasị n’ibu n’ụwa."" (The Amazon River is the second longest and most powerful river in the world.)  It also states that the Amazon is the largest river in the world and has the highest discharge. Therefore, it is definitely *not* the smallest.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

*   **A: Ọ bụ osimiri nke abụọ kachasị ogologo** (It is the second longest river) - Correct.
*   **B: Ọ bụ osimiri kachasị ukwuu** (It is the largest river) - Correct.
*   **C: Ọ bụ osimiri kachasị ogologo** (It is the longest river) - Incorrect. The passage says it's the *second* longest.



"
Olee ụdị ọrụ edesitara n’ederede a na-eji ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị Venezuelan dị obere arụ ọrụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ịrụ ọrụ**.

The text states that 22% of Venezuelans are unemployed, and many of those who *do* have jobs are working in the informal sector. This refers to the general concept of ""work"" or employment, not a specific type of work.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọrụ ugbo (Agricultural work):** While the text mentions a high percentage of roads are unpaved in agricultural areas, it doesn't say this is the *type* of work most Venezuelans are doing.
* **B: Ụlọ ọrụ mmepụta ihe (Manufacturing):** The text mentions the oil industry as a key industry, but doesn't specify manufacturing in general.
* **C: Mmanụ (Oil):** The text mentions the oil industry, but only notes that only 1% of the oil industry is actually operating.  It doesn't describe the work itself as oil industry work.

Therefore, ""Ịrụ ọrụ"" (Work/Employment) is the most accurate and encompassing answer.
"
"N’isonye ka ederede a si kwuo, olee mpaghara na-ejikari ji ọnụ ọgụgụ Venezuelan buru ibu arụ ọrụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ịrụ ọrụ (Work)**.

The text states: ""Pasentị iri na asatị nke Ndị Venezuela enweghị ọrụ, ma ọtụtụ n’ime ndị nwere ọrụ na-arụ ọrụ n’ebe ndị n'adabanyeghi n’akụnụba mba."" This directly indicates that a large number of Venezuelans are working *outside* of Venezuela.

While the text mentions agriculture and the oil industry, it emphasizes that many Venezuelans are working in foreign countries, making ""Ịrụ ọrụ"" (Work) the most accurate and encompassing answer.
"
"Isonyere ka esi de n’akwukwọ a, olee ihe fushọnụ na-ekwe ka kpakpando mee?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ na-emeputa elementi dị arọ karịa** (It produces lighter elements).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kpakpando ga na-enyepụ ọkụ na okpomọkụ site n'ike nke na-adị mgbe atọm haịdurojin ga na-amakọta wee mebe elementị ndị ka n'arọ."" (The star produces heat and light from the power that is released when hydrogen atoms combine to form lighter elements.)

Option A directly reflects this statement.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọ na-ewube riaktọ fushọnụ gasị** (It creates a gas fusion reactor): The passage discusses stars and the process of fusion, not building reactors.
*   **C: Ọ na-enyefu ọkụ na okpomọkụ** (It emits heat and light): While true, this is a consequence of fusion, not *what* fusion does.
*   **D: Ọ na-emepụta atọm hayịdụrọgen** (It produces hydrogen atoms): The passage states that hydrogen atoms *combine*, not that they are produced.



"
Gịnị n’ihe ndị edesitara ka ezigbo riaktọ fushọnụ ga-ekeputa?,"The correct answer is **D: Ike**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the goal of fusion is to generate power. The process involves combining hydrogen atoms to create heavier elements, releasing a significant amount of energy in the process. This released energy is the power the fusion reactor aims to produce.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Hayịdụrogen (Hydrogen):**  Hydrogen is the fuel *used* in the fusion process, not the output.
* **B: Kpakpando (Plasma):** Plasma is a state of matter created *during* fusion, but it's not the final product or what the reactor is designed to produce.
* **C: Atomụ (Atoms):** While heavier elements are formed, the primary output is energy, not just the atoms themselves.



"
Olee kemikụl mejupụtara mmiri?,"The correct answer is **B: Otu Hayịdụrogen atomụ na otu oxygen atọmụ**.

The passage states: ""Atọm haịdrojin abụọ na otu atọm ọksigin bụ ihe mebere mmiri."" This translates to ""Two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom make up water.""  While the wording in the options is slightly off (""atu hayịdụrogen atomụ"" instead of ""atu hayịdụrogen atọmụ""), option B is the closest and accurately reflects the chemical composition of water.
"
"Oge mmiri gbanwere ụdị, olee ihe na-anọgide ka ọdị na mbụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọdịdị molekụla (Molecular shape)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""O nwere otu ụdị ọdịdị nke mọlekụụlụ n’agbanyeghị na ọ bụ ikuku, mmiri, ma ọ bụ ihe siri ke. E nwere otu ụdị ọdịdị nke mọlekụụlụ n’agbanyeghị na ọ bụ ikuku, mmiri, ma ọ bụ ihe siri ke.""

This means that even though water can exist as a solid (ice), liquid (water), or gas (steam), the arrangement of its molecules (its molecular shape) remains the same.  The chemical composition (hydrogen and oxygen) and the overall chemical state are constant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Densiti (Density):** Density changes depending on the state of water (solid, liquid, gas).
*   **C: Ọnọdụ nke ana-ahụ anya (Visible state):** The visible state (solid, liquid, gas) changes.
*   **D: Nitụrogen mmiri mmiri (Nitrogen water water):** This is a nonsensical phrase and not relevant to the concept being discussed.

Therefore, the only constant factor is the molecular shape."
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee na ndesịta ndịa na-abụghị nramahụ nke steeti iri na atọ nyere ha ịkwanye ụfọdụ iwu?","The correct answer is **A: Nleharanya dị ukwuu si n’ọchịchị steeti**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nzukọ enweghị ike ike ụtụ ma n'ihi na enweghi ndị isi ọchịchị gọọmenti etiti maọbụ ndị omeiwu, nke nzukọ bụ sọ ngalaba onwere- n'okpuru akwụkwọ obodo.

This indicates a lack of agreement and a strong reliance on state governments.  The states are unable to independently enact laws or agreements between themselves without the agreement of *all* states, and the federal government isn't providing financial support. This points to significant disagreements and the state governments being the primary decision-makers, but without the authority or resources to act effectively. Therefore, strong disagreement from the state governments is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Enweghị ike n'etiti Kọngụresi:** The passage doesn't mention the Congress.
*   **C: Ndozigharị na-achọghị nkwado mmadụ:** The passage highlights the *need* for agreement and doesn't imply that modifications are happening without public support.
*   **D: Obodo enweghị onyeisi ọchịchị:** The passage specifically mentions that the assembly is operating *without* federal or legislative leadership (no ""ndị isi ọchịchị gọọmenti etiti maọbụ ndị omeiwụ""). It doesn't say that local governments lack leaders.



"
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee nkwupụta na-eziputa kpọmkwem steeti gọọmentị etiti na mgbe Agha Mgbanwe?","The correct answer is **C: Ndị nnọchi anya steeti abịaghị n’ọgbakọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...steeti ga weere gọọmentị etiti n'ihe efu ruo na ndị nnọchiteanya ha anaghị abịa."" This directly indicates that the absence of state representatives prevented the federal government from collecting taxes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị Kọngụresi na ndị ọchịchị steeti manyere ndị mmadụ ịkwụ ụtụ gasị** - The passage doesn't mention anything about people paying taxes. It focuses on the inability of the federal government to collect taxes.
*   **B: Kọngụresi nyere ikikere ịdezigharị edemede ahụ** - The passage doesn't mention the Congress giving any authority to revise the article.
*   **D: Ọchịchị etiti nwere isi akụkụ abụọ** - While the passage mentions disagreements among state leaders, it doesn't explicitly state the federal government has two branches.

Therefore, the absence of state representatives (their non-attendance) is the key reason the federal government couldn't collect taxes during the period described."
Olee etu esi ede okwu gasị dị n'azụ Agbamụama nke Nwereonwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Mkpọdo isi ala** (Heading in bold).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ederede ahu putara na ala-ala akwukwo ahu, kpodo isi na-ala."" This translates to ""The text was written at the bottom of the document, in bold letters."" Therefore, the text was written in **bold letters**, which is a form of **bold heading**.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a edesịtara ka eji mara Singapore?,"The correct answer is **D: Ịkeomume nka**.

Here's why:

* The passage highlights Singapore's transformation into the ""Garden City"" and its iconic orchid, Vanda Miss Joaquim. This strongly points to Singapore being known for its horticultural beauty and appreciation of flora.
* ""Ịkeomume nka"" (Appreciation of art/culture) is the closest fit among the options, as the passage emphasizes a unique cultural aspect - the creation of a garden city.  While not a direct match, it encompasses the care, cultivation, and celebration of the natural environment, which is a significant cultural element of Singapore.

The other options are less relevant:

* **A: Akwụkwọ osisi obodo mepere emepe (Open city archives):**  While Singapore has archives, it's not a defining characteristic associated with its overall image like its gardens.
* **B: Ịme njem ụkwụ (Running races):**  Singapore is a sporting nation, but it's not its primary defining characteristic in the context of its image.
* **C: Egwuregwu ime njem (Travel games):** This is not a recognizable or relevant concept in relation to Singapore's identity.



"
Kedu ihe bụ Vanda Miss Joaquim?,"The correct answer is **C: Ogige osisi botanikụlụ** 

Here's why:

The text states that Vanda Miss Joaquim ""kụrụ dị ka ngwakọ ifuru."" This translates to ""was chosen as the national flower, a **hybrid orchid**."" Therefore, the best description from the choices is ""Ogige osisi botanikụlụ"" which means ""Orchid"".
"
Olee ụdịdị pyramidi Giza ka Alaeze Ọhụrụ Ijipt enweghị ike ịnabata dịka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **C: Nha ha (Their size)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the pyramids of Giza were so impressive that they were remembered for a hundred years by the Old Kingdom Egyptians.  The question asks what the New Kingdom Egyptians *couldn't* replicate, according to the text. The passage implies that the sheer **size** of the pyramids was something the New Kingdom Egyptians couldn't match, as it was the most remarkable aspect remembered by the Old Kingdom people.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Afọ ha (Their age):** The passage doesn't indicate that the New Kingdom Egyptians couldn't replicate the age of the pyramids.
*   **B: Iji okwute (Using stone):** The pyramids were built using stone, and the New Kingdom Egyptians also used stone for their structures. The passage doesn't suggest they couldn't use stone.
*   **D: Nwube ha (Their form/shape):** The passage doesn't explicitly state that the New Kingdom Egyptians couldn't replicate the pyramid shape. While they built pyramids, the scale and magnificence of the Giza pyramids were unparalleled.

Therefore, the size (nha ha) is the most logical answer based on the information provided."

The passage states: ""Kwa ahọ ebe ọnwa Ọktoba, ihe anụ n'eri ahịhịa ruru otu nde n'okara n'aga njem site n'ugwu ruo n'ebe ndịda..."" This indicates the animals are traveling *from the highlands* (ugwu) *to the south* ( ndịda).  The passage also mentions they go to Mara River for water.  The highlands are in the south.
"
"Isonyere ka akwụkwọ si dee, kedu ebe anụmanụ na-ata ahịhịa na-ahapụ mgbe ụfọdụ n’oge Eprel?","The correct answer is **C: Osimiri Mara**.

The passage states: ""sizie n'ọdịda anyanwụ laghachi n'ugwu, gafee osimiri Mara ọzọ, mgbe mmiri zochara n'ihe dị ka ọnwa Eprel."" This means the animals go to the Mara River *again* in April.
"
Kedu mba Ọpụreshọnụ Sealion bụ mwakpo agha ha?,"The correct answer is **A: Germany**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Aha koodu Germany kpọrọ mwakpo ahụ bụ """"Operation Sealion"""""" which translates to ""The code name Germany gave to the attack was """"Operation Sealion"""""""".
"
Olee ihe Germanị kpọrọ mwakpo a na Biritenụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọpụreshọnụ Sealionụ**.

The text explicitly states: ""Aha koodu Germany kpọrọ mwakpo ahụ bụ """"Operation Sealion""""."" This translates to ""The code name Germany gave to the attack was """"Operation Sealion"""".""
"
Kedu ihe ana-ekwughị bụ usoro dị mkpa Itali chọrọ ịjị kpurụ obodo nọ n’Afrịka?,"The correct answer is **A: Iwepụsi ụgbọ mmiri n’Ijiypt (Removing the ships in Egypt)**.

The passage explicitly states that Italy needed to remove British naval ships from Egypt in order to proceed with its colonization plans in Africa.  Without removing the British presence, the Italian naval operations would be hindered.
"
"Dị ka akụkụ akwụkwọ a si dee, kedu ihe bụ isi ebumnobi Itali n'agha a?","The correct answer is **A: Ị wakpo obodo Afrika gasị (To attack African cities)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Isi ihe mgbaru ọsọ mba Itali bụ mba Afrịka dị iche iche. Ịnwudo obodo ndị ahụ, ha ga enwe ebe esi ezipu ndị agha, ka ndị agha nwee ike kwọrọ ụgbọ kwọfee oke osimiri Mediterenia wee wakpo mba Afrịka."" (The main goal of Italy was the diverse African territories. Invading these cities would give them a place to deploy troops, allowing the troops to cross the Mediterranean Sea and attack African countries.)



The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Iwube ndị agha na ndị agha mmiri di ike (To mobilize armies and powerful navies):** While Italy did have armies and navies, the passage doesn't say mobilizing them was the *main goal*.
*   **C: Ịwepusi ụgbọ mmiri ndị Ijipt (To remove Egyptian ships):** Removing Egyptian ships was a tactic to allow Italian ships to operate, not the primary goal.
*   **D: Ịgụzobe ntọala ndị Biritenụ (To sabotage British installations):** This is not mentioned in the passage."
Kedu onye guzobere ọdịmma enyi na ndị mwakpo?,"The correct answer is **B: Vichy Frenchi**.

The passage states: ""Ndị chịrị ya bụ ndị """"Vichy"""" French. Ndị a bụ ndị mba Frans ndị ha na ndị mba Jamini mere udo n'afọ 1940 ma soro ndị iro rụkọọ ọrụ karịa ịlụso ha ọgụ."" This directly indicates that the Vichy French were the ones who initially collaborated with the Germans.

The text states: ""N'ime nanị izu abụọ ndị agha America na Ndị French nke Nweere onwe ihe emeela..."" This indicates the American and Free French forces cooperated in Operation Dragoon.
"
Kedụ teknọlọjii nke nkwalite ya kpatara sọbụmarini ịbido na-aga njem n'okpuru mmiri?,"The correct answer is **C: Nyagharị (Propulsion)**.

Here's why:

The question asks *what technology enabled submarines to travel underwater*. The passage states: ""Ụgbọ okpuru mmiri bụ ụgbọ mmiri arụrụ maka njem n'okpuru mmiri..."" and later mentions that ""a na-akpọ ụgbọ okpuru mmiri ndị Germany U-Boat. Ndị Germany maara anya ụgbọ okpuru mmiri ha ọfụma...ka agha gasịrị ndị obodo Jamani abụghị ndị atụkwasịrị obi inwe ọtụtụ n'ime ha.""  This implies a key technological advancement that made them effective.

The passage goes on to say ""mbido agha ha nọ na-aga naanị n’elu mmiri mana a ihe nnataozi n'ikuku bidoro rụwa ọrụ nke ọma ụgbọokpurummiri enweghizi ihe ọzọ ọ ga-eme n'abụghị ịgbada n'okpuru mmiri ka a ghara ịhụ ya."" This describes the transition to underwater operations. 

While the other options are related to naval technology:

*   **A: Ụgbọ mmiri-U (U-boat)** is the *name* of the submarine, not the technology.
*   **B: Nhọrọ ịgba ihe (Armament)** refers to weapons, not propulsion.
*   **D: Rada (Radar)** is a detection technology, used to *find* submarines, not to make them travel underwater.

The ability to travel underwater is directly related to the **propulsion** system. Submarines needed a way to move while submerged. The passage doesn't detail the *specific* propulsion technology, but it implies a significant advancement that enabled effective underwater movement. Therefore, **Nyagharị (Propulsion)** is the most accurate answer based on the given text.



"
"N'oge iji ha izizi rụọ ọrụ, olee n’ihe sọbụmarịnị nwere obere renji?","The correct answer is **B: Ịme njem (Making voyages)**.

The text states: ""Ụgbọ okpuru mmiri bụ ụgbọ mmiri arụrụ maka njem n'okpuru mmiri..."" which translates to ""Submarines are ships built for voyages underwater...""
"
"Dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ a kwuru, onye mebiri nkwekọrịta a? ","The correct answer is **D: Ndị Soviet**. 

The text states that ""more than 800,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers invaded the Belarussian and Ukrainian territories, cleared the Polish territory to the south, and concluded the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, the Soviet-Polish Non-aggression Pact, and many other agreements between the two countries, as well as between many states."" 

This clearly indicates the Soviet Union was a key party in the agreements mentioned. While the Polish were victims of the invasion, they were not the ones who *made* the pacts. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact was between the Soviet Union and Germany (though the text doesn't explicitly state this, it's the context). The Soviet-Polish pact was also signed by the Soviet Union.



"
Ked ihe na anagha Reedi na andesta a nke?,"The correct answer is **B: Njide nke mpaghara ọwụwa anyanwụ (The occupation of the northern territories)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text describes the Soviet Union invading Poland in September 1939.
* The key outcome of this invasion, as stated in the text, was the occupation of Poland's northern territories, specifically the areas of Belarus and Ukraine.
* The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact (the agreement between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany) facilitated this partition of Poland.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ime nke Ukraine n'ihu (The continuation of Ukraine's internal affairs):** The Soviet invasion directly interfered with Ukraine's internal affairs, not continued them.
* **C: Nhazịkọgharị n’akụkụ isi akwa mmiri (The seizure of maritime strategic points):**  While the war had implications for maritime strategy, the primary focus of the invasion described was the land occupation of Poland.
* **D: Ime mmebi iwu (The enforcement of law):** While occupation inevitably leads to enforcing new laws, this isn't the *primary* consequence described in the text.  The key consequence was the territory itself being taken.



"
Kedu ihe mere onye isi injinia nke Agha Iri nke Itali?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị Briten jisiri ike jide ya**.

The passage states: ""N'agha mberede n'ebe ọwụwa anyanwụ Bardia, ndị Britain jidere n'agha Onye isi Injinia nke Ndị agha Nke iri nke Italy, General Lastucci."" This directly indicates that the British forces captured General Lastucci.
"
Ebee ka Italo Balbo gafere?,"The correct answer is **A: bard**. 

The passage states: ""On Juun 28, Marshal Italo Balbo, onyeisiala mba Libya na onye nsote Mussolini nwụrụ site n'ọgbụgba nke ndị otu ya n'amaghị amaghị ka ọ na-achọ ịkwụsị na Tobruk.""  It then mentions the battle was near Bardia.  Therefore, Balbo died near Bardia.

"Kedu n'ime usoro ntụgharị uche ndị a bụ akụkụ dị oke mkpa nke okpukpe Buddha Tibet, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Na-emega ahụ́ gị (Breath control)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""In the application of Kundalini Yoga, the power of Kundalini (the power of spiritual development) is awakened through post-yoga yoga, **breathing exercises, mental concentration, and visualizations.**""

Therefore, breath control (Na-emega ahụ́ gị) is directly mentioned as a key component of the Tibetan Buddhist meditation practices described.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **B: Na-abụ abụ affirmations (Affirmations):** While affirmations can be *part* of a meditation practice, they aren't explicitly detailed as a core element in the text.
*   **C: Ịna-ahụ chị (Smiling):** Smiling might be a *result* or a *component* of a positive state, but the text doesn't highlight it as a foundational practice.
*   **D: ịmụta ọnọdụ yoga (Learning yoga postures):** The text mentions ""post-yoga yoga"" but doesn't emphasize the learning of *asanas* (postures) as a primary focus. The focus is more on the energetic practices and meditations.



"
"""Kedu ka chakras si arụ ọrụ n'oge """"etiti"""" ntụgharị uche Tibet, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?""","The best answer is **C: Mmegharị nke mantrasi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly links chakra activation to mantra recitation.** The passage states that ""In the meditation of the Tibetans, the chakra is activated by the recitation of mantras."" (This is implied from the context: ""By visualizing different deities, the principles of power are activated, the chakra is invoked, and the veils of illusion are removed."")
* **Chakras are energy centers, and mantras are powerful sounds/vibrations** believed to resonate with and influence these energy centers.
* **Option A (Several yoga postures) is a general aspect of yoga but not the direct mechanism mentioned for chakra activation in this context.** While postures can influence chakras, the passage focuses specifically on mantras.
* **Option B (Seeing deities) is related to visualization, but the passage links chakra activation directly to mantra recitation.**
* **Option D (Purifying the body) is also related to yoga and spiritual practices, but not the primary mechanism described for chakra activation.**

Therefore, the answer that directly reflects the information given in the passage is **C: Mmegharị nke mantrasi.**

The text states: ""Onye ọgụ egwu Sanju Sharma bidoro na mgbede, **Jai Shankar Choudhary were sote ya**.""  ""Were sote ya"" means he joined or followed. Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary provided the second musical turn/performance.
"
"Ònye rụrụ abụ nsọpụrụ ofufe n’oge e ji achụ àjà ihe oriri, dị ka e si kwuo ya?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The text explicitly states: ""Lakkha Singh wee bido idu n'ịbụ abụ bajan gasị."" This translates to ""Lakkha Singh then started offering the prayer.""  The passage also mentions he performed the Chhappan Bhog bhajan. Therefore, Lakkha Singh was the one performing the prayer/ritual.
"
Kedụ ihe bụ ikeọrụ ikpeazụ-abụọ nke mgbede?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandụrọ Safina na Haris Alexiou**.

The last performance mentioned in the text is by Turkish diva Sezen Aksu, Italian tenor Alessandro Safina, and Greek singer Haris Alexiou.
"
Kedu obodo Alessandro Safina si?,"The correct answer is **D: Ịtalian**.

The text states: ""...onye Itali ahụ tenor Alessandro Safina..."" This directly indicates that Alessandro Safina is Italian.
"
"Ị kwenye na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee n’ime ederede ndịa na-abụghị okwu ziri ezi?","The correct answer is **D: O were opekatampe nkeji 60 iji kpọpụta onye izizi n’ụgbọ.**

Here's why:

* The text states it takes ""at least one hour"" to remove the first person from the boat.  Option D says ""opekatampe nkeji 60"" which translates to ""60 minutes"" or 1 hour. However, the text specifically says *at least* one hour, making 60 minutes a potential answer, but the text says it takes *at least* one hour. Thus, 60 minutes is not correct as the text says it takes at least one hour.
* Options A, B, and C are all directly mentioned or implied in the text.

Therefore, **D** is the statement that doesn't accurately reflect the information presented in the passage.
"
"Isonye ka esi dee na mpaghara akwụkwọ a, olee onye kwụrụ ụka gbasara ọkwa ekpomoku ọjọọ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: onye isi mgbanyụ ọkụ**.

The text states that Scott Kouns is a ""ọkụ Scott Kouns"" which translates to ""fire chief Scott Kouns"" in English. He is the one who commented on the extreme heat. Therefore, he is a fire chief.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: onye ọkwọ ụgbọ:** (Ship captain) While relevant to the situation, the text doesn't identify the captain as the speaker.
*   **C: Ndị na-eme njem:** (Travelers) The travelers are affected by the heat, but they didn't comment on it.
*   **D: onye uwe ojii kọmishọna:** (Police commissioner) There's no mention of a police commissioner in the text.



"
Ebee ka mfu ike metụtara tsunami mere?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The passage states: ""Nweghị nnukwu mmebi ma ọ bụ mmerụ ahụ akọrọna n’ime **Tonga**..."". This indicates that Tonga experienced a significant impact, even though it wasn't a major disaster.

While Pago Pago and Niue were areas where the tsunami was observed, the passage specifically mentions Tonga as experiencing impacts. The closure of schools in Hawaii is a consequence of the threat, but not the location where the initial impact occurred.
"
"Mmetụta dị aṅaa ka nkwụsị ọkụ ahụ nwere na Tonga, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: A kọsaraghị ndị ọchịchị ịdọ aka ná ntị ahụ ewelitere.**

The passage states: ""Ọ nweghị nnukwu mmebi ma ọ bụ mmerụ ahụ akọrọna n’ime Tonga, mana e were ọkụ nwa oge, nke a kọrọ gbochiri ndị ọchịchị Tongan ịnata ịdọ aka na ntị maka ajọ ebili mmiri PTWC ahụ nyere."" This directly translates to Tonga's government not receiving warnings about the tsunami alert.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A kọrọ mmebi na obere ego:** The passage states there wasn't a major disruption.
*   **C: Ọgụgụ nke oke osimiri gbanwere:** The passage says the tsunami alert indicated a start to rising sea levels, not a change in sea level readings.
*   **D: Enyeghị ndị ọchịchị ịdọ aka ná ntị ndị dị mkpa:** The passage indicates that the government was blocked from *receiving* the warnings, not that the warnings themselves were unimportant.



"
Kedu mgbe ndị uwe ojii nwere ike iji akụrụngwa radar ha tụọ ọsọ ịnya ụgbọ ala Jonny Reid?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ gafere àkwà mmiri ahụ nke ugboro asaa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""N'ogugo ọsọ nke 160km/h ugboro asaa gafee akwa mmiri ahụ."" This means he reached 160 km/h *while* driving across the harbor.
* **The passage also states:** ""Ndị uwe ojii New Zealand police nwere nsogbu iji reda èkwòmọsọ ha ịhụ ọsọ ole Maazị Reid na-agba n’iwe etu ala Black Beauty dị...""  This implies the radar couldn't accurately measure his speed *while* he was traveling at 160 km/h.
* **The police only managed to approach and stop him after he slowed down to 160 km/h.**

Therefore, the police *could have used* radar to measure his speed *as he was driving across the harbor* (passing the harbor seven times at 160 km/h).
"
Kedu ihe mere na onye mgbanye ọlaedo Olympic anọghị na-aṅụ ọgwụ maka ahụ mgbu ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịkwọ ụgbọ ala na ọsọ n'okpuru 160 km / h**.

Here's why:

The text describes Joni Reid driving his A1GP car at a speed of 160km/h across Auckland Harbour. The question asks why a marathon runner wouldn't take pain medication. The connection is likely a humorous one based on the extreme physical exertion of both activities. Driving a race car at 160km/h is physically demanding, and the text emphasizes the speed and the car's age (""nwa mma dị oji""). The runner's pain could be related to a similar level of exertion.

The other options are irrelevant:

*   **B: Ụgbọ ala ahụ dị obere** - The text mentions the car is old (""nwa mma dị oji"") but not its size.
*   **C: Naanị ugboro asaa ka ọ kwọ ụgbọala gafee àkwà mmiri ahụ** - The number of times the car crossed the harbour is not directly related to the pain of a marathon runner.
*   **D: Nke kacha ochie bụ akwa mmiri Auckland Harbor** - The age of the harbour is also not directly related to the pain of a marathon runner.



"
Kedu ebe dị anya site na Butte bụ etiti ala ọma jijiji ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: n'ebe ndịda 40 kilomita**.

The text states the epicenter was approximately 65 km south of Butte.
"
Kedu ihe mere na ọgba aghara Abu Ghraib?,"The correct answer is **A: mmeso ọjọọ nke ndị mkpọrọ**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""Ụlọ nga ahụ ghọọrọ ihe ama mgbe achọpụtara mmegide ndị atụrụ nga n'ebe ahu ka ndị agha US weere ọnọdụ."" This indicates the abuse of prisoners was the central issue.
* **The prompt also mentions:** ""Mkọrọọ Abu Ghraib nke Irakị bụ nke amụnyere ọkụ n’oge otu ogbaaghara."" While the prison was set on fire, the core of the scandal was the abuse *of* the prisoners.
* **Options B, C, and D are incorrect:** The scandal wasn't just about the prison itself (B), the US soldiers were directly involved in the abuse (C), and while the prison was set on fire (D), that wasn't the main cause of the notoriety.

Therefore, the abuse of prisoners is the most accurate and comprehensive description of what happened at Abu Ghraib.
"
Gịnị mere e ji mara ụlọ mkpọrọ Iraq nke ọma? ,"The correct answer is **D: ịchọta ihe akaebe nke mmetọ ndị mkpọrọ**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""Ụlọ nga ahụ ghọọrọ ihe ama mgbe achọpụtara mmegide ndị atụrụ nga n'ebe ahu ka ndị agha US weere ọnọdụ."" This means the prison gained notoriety (became famous) *because* of the discovery of abuse of prisoners by US soldiers. The discovery of the abuse provided evidence of the wrongdoing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agbanyere ya ọkụ:** While the passage mentions the prison was burned, the burning itself wasn't the reason for its notoriety.
*   **B: Ndị agha US weghaara ngalaba:** This is not mentioned in the provided text.
*   **C: Ọnụọgụ ọgba aghara ahụ dị elu:**  While there was certainly a high level of unrest, the *discovery of the abuse* was the key factor in the prison's notoriety.



"
Olee ụdị ememme e mere ndokwa ka e mee n’ámá egwuregwu Ncheta Agha Maui?,"The correct answer is **C: ngosi**.

The passage states that ""Ndị otu ahụ kagburu ihe ngosipụ ahụ..."" which translates to ""The group performed the show..."". This indicates a performance or show took place. While a war memorial stadium *could* host other events, the text explicitly mentions a ""show"".
"
Ònye mechara nye nkwado maka ịkagbu mmemme ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị nkwado ahụ**.

The question states that the attackers *demanded concessions from the supporters*. This means the supporters were the ones being asked for something (likely a cessation of violence or some other agreement) in exchange for not continuing the attack.
"
Kedu onye ụfọdụ ụmụ amaala Bishkek kwenyere na ọ bụ ya kpatara ịkwakọrọ ihe?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị na-eme ngagharị iwe**.

The text states: ""Otutu ndi bi na Bishkek tara ndi na-eme ngaghari iwe si na odida anyanwu uta gbasara imebi iwu"" which translates to ""Some people in Bishkek were angry at the rioters for disturbing the peace by breaking the law."" Therefore, the rioters themselves were angry at the events that led to the declaration of martial law.



"
Kedu onye kenyere ndị ngagharị iwe maka izu ohi ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ụmụ amaala Bishkek**.

The passage states: ""Otutu ndi bi na Bishkek tara ndi na-eme ngaghari iwe si na odida anyanwu uta gbasara imebi iwu"" which translates to ""The residents of Bishkek were angered by the rioters for violating the law."" Therefore, the residents of Bishkek are the ones who were angered.
"
Kedu mgbe Ring hụrụ ịrị elu na azụmaahịa?,"The correct answer is **A: Na-esote arụmọrụ na Shark tank**.

The passage states: ""Orire ahịa gbaliri elu ka ogosichara n'ihe nkiri Shak Tank n'afọ 2013 ebe ndị ndozi ihe ngosi jụrụ itinye ego na mbido."" This means the market for Ring products grew *after* appearing on Shark Tank in 2013.
"
Kedu mgbe Jamie Simoff mere mkpebi ịmalite Ring?,"The correct answer is **A: chọpụtara mgbịrịgba ọnụ ụzọ nke ya anaghị ada ụda nke ukwuu**.

The text states: ""Na mbu, onye isi Ring, Jamie Siminoff, kwuru na ulo oru ya bidoro mgbe onughi mgbirigba ya n’ulo ahia ya di na ime ebe o na adoba ugboala ya.""  This directly indicates that the problem with his own doorbell triggered the idea for Ring.
"
Kedu ihe e nyere ụmụaka na mmemme Ọgụgụ Rainbow ọ bụla?,"The correct answer is **D: Akwụkwọ**.

The text states: ""Ụfọdụ, tinyere John Grant, kwenyere na mbelata mbinye ego na mgbanwe na nka ihe ọmụma gbasara ndozi ihe ngosi nkuzi ihe so weta maka njedebe ihe ngosi ahụ. **Ihe ngosi ọbụla gakwa enye ụmụ nkwanye maka akwụkwọ ndị nke ụmụaka kwesịrị ịchọ maka mgbe ha gara n’ọbaakwụkwọ ha.**""
"
Gịnị kpatara na a kagbuola usoro ihe onyonyo nke Reading Rainbow?,"The correct answer is **D: Ogbe Mister Rogers kụrụ**. 

While the text mentions budget cuts and changes in educational programming, it specifically states that **some, including John Grant, believed that the reduction in funding and changes in educational programming brought about the end of the show.**  The text doesn't mention Mister Rogers directly causing the cancellation.

Therefore, the closest answer reflecting the information in the text is that the changes in funding and programming, which some associated with a shift away from the original educational vision, led to the show's demise.  While not explicitly stating ""Mr. Rogers killed it,"" the implication is that the shift in educational philosophy and budget cuts were the primary factors.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe nchebe nke ndị nnọchiteanya Amsterdam na ụlọ ihe ngosi nka nyere banyere osisi ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: N'enweghị mgbagha, ọ ga-ada** (It won't matter, it will die).

Here's why:

The passage clearly states the tree is diseased by a fungus and poses a significant threat to public health due to the risk of spreading the disease. Options B, C, and D all reflect this concern. Option A dismisses the problem, which contradicts the information provided in the passage. The officials are concerned, and the tree's health is a matter of importance.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kwesịrị ịga nyocha oge niile, dịka onye nleba anya kacha elu nke RSPCA siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Sistemụ CCTV**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Onye-isi ndi uwe-oji nke South Wales Ohuu RSPCA David O'Shannessy gwara ABC na nleba-anya na nyocha nke ulo-igbu-anu kwesiri idi kwa-mgbe na Australia."" and later mentions ""Igwefoto ahụ ga ezijeriri ozi siri ike nye ndị na azụ anụmanụ..."".  This directly relates to the installation of CCTV systems. The other options are not mentioned as something needing regular inspection.
"
"Kedu ihe ga-enyere ndị na-arụ ọrụ n'ụlọ anụ ụlọ n'Australia aka ịghọta uru nlekọta anụ ụlọ dị, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Nhazi nke igwefoto CCTV**.

Here's why:

The passage states the RSPCA wants to install CCTV cameras in all animal slaughterhouses in Australia. This camera system is intended to monitor the treatment of animals during slaughter.  Having CCTV cameras would directly help slaughterhouse workers understand the importance of humane animal handling by providing a visual record of the process and potential areas for improvement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nzukọ RSPCA nke achọrọ:** While the RSPCA's request is important, it doesn't directly help workers *understand* the value of humane treatment.
* **C: Nlele oge niile nke ụlọ anụ:** Regular inspections are mentioned as necessary, but the CCTV cameras are the *tool* that would aid in understanding and improving the treatment.
* **D: Nlekọta nke ABC:** ABC is a news organization; their reporting doesn't directly benefit the workers in understanding humane animal handling.



"
"Gịnị ka onye ahụ e jidere na-eme, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: onye mmụta** (student).

The text states: ""...ndị ihe mmerede metụtara na ejidere nwa akwụkwọ ọzọ maka okwu gbasara mgbagbu..."" which translates to ""...related cultural artifacts and a student was detained for comments regarding the massacre...""
"
"A na-eme olili ozu mmadụ ole, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ ahụ si kwuo, mgbe akụkọ gbasara njide ọzọ gbasara?","The correct answer is **A: Otu**.

The passage states: ""Akụkọ gbasara n'ime obodo Red Lake taa dịka a na eme olili ozu Jeff Weise na mmadụ atọ ọzọ n'ime mmadụ itolu ndị ihe mmerede metụtara...""

This indicates that one person (Jeff Weise) and three others were publicly mourned. Therefore, the answer is one.
"
Kedu mba kpebiri na ha agaghị emejuputa nkwekọrịta ACTA mgbe ngagharị iwe ahụ gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **B: Polandị**.

The text states: ""N'ọnwa gara aga, enwere ọtụtụ ngagharị iwe na Poland mgbe obodo a nyere ACTA nkwenye ha, nke mere ka gọọmenti Poland kpebie na ha ka ga-echere tupu ha asị nkwekọrịta ahụ gaa n'ihu.."" This directly indicates Poland decided not to ratify the ACTA agreement due to the protests.

While other countries had protests, Poland's decision to *not* ratify ACTA *because* of the protests is specifically mentioned.
"
Kedu mba ahọrọghị imejuputa nkwekọrịta ACTA ha bịanyere aka na nzaghachi maka ngagharị iwe ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The passage states: ""Latvia ma Slovakia egbuola oge nke usoro isonyere ACTA."" This implies they *didn't* fully implement the agreement and were delaying ratification due to the protests. The question asks which *didn't* fully implement it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Estonia:** The passage explicitly mentions Tallinn (in Estonia) as a location where protests occurred. There's no mention of Estonia's stance on ACTA implementation.
* **B: Lithuania:** The passage explicitly mentions Vilnius (in Lithuania) as a location where protests occurred. There's no mention of Lithuania's stance on ACTA implementation.
* **C: Scotland:** The passage mentions protests in Edinburgh and Glasgow, but refers to them as being ""in"" Scotland, not a separate country.  And, it doesn't state Scotland's position on ACTA.



"
Ole ihe omume nke ikpo oke ọkụ iPod butere mmerụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states that the faulty iPods overheated and caused burns to **four** people.
"
Ònye kwuru na ikpe ekpo oke ọkụ adịghị mkpa n'ezie?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

The text states: ""Ụlọ ozi zaghachiri sị na mbugharị oge rịpọt Apple mere dị """"mwute n'ezie"""".""  ""Mwute n'ezie"" translates to ""really serious"" or ""actually serious"" but the question asks which entity said the temperature limit wasn't really serious. Apple's response implies that the temperature limit was not a significant concern.
"
"N'okwu ya, Steve Jobs kwuru na Apple ga-agbanwe gịnị?","The correct answer is **B: Ekwentị mkpanaaka (Cell phones)**.

Steve Jobs specifically stated that Apple would change the *cell phone* as the world knew it. His famous quote was about revolutionizing the mobile phone industry with the iPhone.
"
Gịnị mere Steve Jobs ji kwuo okwu were awa abụọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na-ewepụta ekwentị ọhụrụ**.

The passage states that Steve Jobs unveiled the iPhone and said, ""Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone."" This directly relates to the release of a new phone. The other options are not supported by the information provided.
"
"N'ụlọ ihe nkiri Argentine, gịnị ka Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kwupụtara?","The correct answer is **A: Ọkwa ya maka ịzọ ọkwa onyeisiala**.

The text states: ""Ọ bụ n'Ajentaịn Tiyeta ka Lọọlọ Kirchner kwuputara ebumnuche ya ịzọ maka ọkwa onye isi ala..."" (It was in the Argentinian Theater that Kirchner announced her intention to run for the presidency...)

Therefore, option A is the accurate answer.
"
Kedu ebe Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner kwuputara ọkwa ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Na Buenos Aires, na ụlọ ihe nkiri La Plata**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...Crisitina Fernandez de Kirchner kwụkwuputara ebumnuche ya ịzọ maka ọkwa onye isi ala, otu ebe ahụ ọ ji bido kampen ya maka ọkwa Sịnetọ na 2005 dị ka onye otu nke ndị mpaghara Buenos Aires zigara.""
* It also mentions: ""Onye omeiwu nakwa nwunye onyeisiala mba Argentina bụ Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner mara ọkwa na mgbede ụnyahụ na La Plata, obodo nọpụrụ kilomita 50 (maịlụ 31)site na Buenos Aires...""

This indicates she announced her candidacy *in* Buenos Aires, but at a location in La Plata (which is 31 km from Buenos Aires). So, the most accurate option is D.
"
Kedu ihe ACMA kwubiri na Big Brother?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọ nweghị mmebi nke iwu nyocha emebeghị**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ndi ACMA chọpụtarakwara na n'agbanyeghị na a na elere ya n'ịntaneetị, ihe onyonyoo Big Brọda emebighị iwu gbasara nyocha na mmachi ihe ngosi n'ịntaneetị maka na ihe onyonyoo ahụ abụghị ihe echekwara na webụsaịtị nke Big Brọda.""

This directly translates to: ""ACMA found that despite being advertised online, Big Brother did not have a law regarding the investigation and censorship of online shows because the images were not what was advertised on the Big Brother website.""  This means they found *no violation of the law* related to investigation or censorship.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Achọpụtara na webụsaịtị Big Brother nwere mgbasa ozi** - The passage doesn't mention anything about the Big Brother website having broadcasting rights.
*   **C: E mebiri iwu na-achịkwa nyocha** - The passage states that Big Brother *didn't* have a law, not that one was enforced.
*   **D: Ebe anụ ahụ nke sava ebe achọpụtara ọdịnaya bụ** - The location of the server is irrelevant to the ACMA's finding about legal violations.



"
Kedu ihe a chọrọ ka mgbasa ozi ga-egbo ka ewee ya dị ka ọdịnaya ịntanetị?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ ga-adịrịrị na nkesa**.

Here's why:

The text states that the broadcasting regulator (ACMA) found that Big Brother didn't comply with online content regulation because the image wasn't on the Big Brother website.  The regulation applies to content *shown to the public*.  Since the content was on a server *other* than Big Brother's website, the regulator requires it to be hosted on a server (i.e., a provider) that *can be controlled*.  This implies regulation needs to be applied to the service provider, not just the broadcaster.
"
Kedu onye na-edu Liberal Party of Australia?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Pita Kostello, Onye Ndokwa akụ Ọstrelia na onye a na-ele anya ga-anọchi Praịm Minista Jọn Howard dịka onye isi otu ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị Libral..."" which translates to ""Pita Kostello, an Australian treasurer and a rising star, is expected to replace Prime Minister John Howard as the leader of the Liberal government...""
"
Kedu ihe kpatara na enweghị azụmahịa ike nuklia na Australia ugbua??,"The correct answer is **A: Ọha na-amasịghị ya (Public does not like it)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Peter Costello said, ""Once nuclear power generation has become a security issue, the Australian community will want to see it operating."" This implies that currently, the Australian community *doesn't* want to see nuclear power operating.  Therefore, the reason for the lack of nuclear power in Australia is that the public is not receptive to it.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **B: Ejighị n'aka (Not been considered):** The text implies it *has* been considered, but not implemented. It doesn't say it hasn't been considered at all.
*   **C: Dị oke ize ndụ (Very expensive):** The text doesn't mention cost as a factor.
*   **D: ọnụ ahịa dị elu (High costs):** Similar to C, cost is not mentioned.



"
Kedu skier ji ntuziaka n'oge asọmpi ahụ niile?,"The correct answer is **A: Anna Jochemsen**.

The passage states: ""Ya na naanị medaal iri na asatọ dị kwa otu ụbọchị, ọtụtụ mba adala imepụta ikpo okwu medaal ahụ. Ha gụnyere mba Nedalands, ebe **Anna Jochemsen** gbara onye nke itoolu n'egwuregwu nkwụmọtọ ụmụ nwanyị nke asọmpi Super-G ụnyaahụ...""

Therefore, Anna Jochemsen is specifically mentioned as a skier who competed in the Super-G event. The other options are mentioned as skiers who competed in different events (men's Super-G) or didn't achieve a medal.
"
"Na Super-G maka ọkwa ụmụ nwanyị, kedụ mba bịara n'ụzọ iri?","The correct answer is **B: Netherlands**.

The text states: ""Ya na naanị medaal iri na asatọ dị kwa otu ụbọchị, ọtụtụ mba adala imepụta ikpo okwu medaal ahụ. Ha gụnyere mba Nedalands, ebe Anna Jochemsen gbara onye nke itoolu n'egwuregwu nkwụmọtọ ụmụ nwanyị nke asọmpi Super-G ụnyaahụ..."" This means the Netherlands produced a medal, and Anna Jochemsen came in 10th place in the women's Super-G competition. Therefore, the Netherlands came in 10th place.
"
"Kedu nkwupụta gbasara Blake bụ ihe na-abụghị eziokwu, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **B: O kwetara iku ọrụ ahụ.**

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Blake was charged with attempting to obstruct a legal process. 
*   It also says he used a pole to defend himself from a crowd of people.
*   Therefore, he did *not* admit to committing the act of obstruction; he was accused of it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'ebe ahụ, a kpọchiri ya:** This is a true statement according to the passage.
*   **C: O were mkpara n’aka wakpoo:** This is a true statement according to the passage.
*   **D: O kwuputara na ọ bụ ya bụ onye a tụrụ atụba karama:**  This is consistent with the passage, as he was defending himself *from* a crowd of people.



"
"Dabere na ngalaba ahụ, Blake ahụghị nke n'ime ndị a?","The correct answer is **C: E ji mkpanaka tie ya (He was tied with a rope)**.

Here's why:

*   **The passage states:** ""The reporter, who survived the ordeal, stated that he used a pole to defend himself from the thirty people who attacked him."" This means Blake used a pole *to defend himself*. It doesn't say he was tied up.
*   **The passage states:** ""The court convicted Blake for attempting to obstruct the course of a fair trial."" This explains why he was convicted.
*   **The passage states:** ""The judge told Blake that he was ""more than sufficiently obstructed"" and would be remanded in custody."" This confirms he will be put in jail.
*  **The passage states:** ""The court convicted Blake for attempting to obstruct the course of a fair trial"". This implies he will face consequences.



Therefore, option C is the one that is *not* supported by the information given in the passage.



"
Kedu ebumnuche nke United Nations agaghị etinye ego maka ikpo ọkụ zuru ụwa ọnụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ebe obibi nwere ike iguzogide idei mmiri**.

Here's why:

The passage states the UN wants to allocate funds to help global communities affected by water scarcity.  Options A, B, and D are all related to water issues, but option C directly addresses a barrier to implementing solutions - communities resisting changes to water management practices. The passage implies that addressing these resistant communities is a key part of achieving solutions for water scarcity.



Therefore, the UN's aim *not* to fund global water heating (which is a misinterpretation of the passage) is because of resistance from communities to implementing water management ideas.
"
"Kedu ihe UN na-ezube ịchekwa, dabere n'akụkụ akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Oke mmiri ozuzo ka dị adị (Fresh water resources)**.

The passage explicitly states that the UN wants to raise funds to help global communities affected by droughts.  It then lists potential uses for the funds, including building wells, improving irrigation, and providing water purification. All of these relate to securing and managing freshwater resources.
"
Kedụ n’ime ihe ndịa ka Albert Muchanga na-ekwughi dika ihe ekwesiri ka ekwere na ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ma ọbụrụna Benin ga-esonye AfCTA**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Albert Muchunga mentioned Benin *would* join AfCFTA.  The question asks what he said *should* be considered as correct. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that his statement concerned Benin's participation in the agreement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ụbọchị azụmahịa nwere ike bido:** While the passage mentions a potential launch date (July 1, 2020), Muchunga's statement is about Benin's joining, not the launch date itself.
*   **C: Iwu nke ntọala:** The passage specifically mentions a lack of agreement on rules regarding origin and tariffs, but this isn't the core of what Muchunga stated as a condition for Benin's joining.
*   **D: Okwu nnabata tarifu:**  This is a specific aspect of the agreement, but the broader point Muchunga made was about Benin's potential membership.



"
"Gịnị kpatara ịzụ ahịa nwere ike ịmalite na Julaị, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: E nwetala nkwekọrịta na mmachi mmalite na nkwụsị tarifu.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states:  ""Anyị enwebeghị nkwekọrịta maka iwu nke ebe mmepụta na mwepụ ụgwọ mbubata, mana atụmatụ anyị nwere zuru oke iji malite zụwa ahịa na Julaị 1, 2020.""

This means the *lack* of agreement on production and removal rules was the issue, *not* that there was no agreement at all.  The fact that they planned to start trading in July 2020 *despite* this lack of agreement implies they had reached an agreement on the crucial aspects needed for trade to commence: the elimination of tariffs and the start date.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ihe ndị Naijiria chọrọ maka ịbanye AfCFTA gụnyere ụbọchị mmalite na Julaị:** While the start date was planned, it wasn't the *reason* trade could start. It was a planned timeline *assuming* other conditions were met.
* **B: Usoro iwu na ebe obibi dị adị zuru oke:** The passage specifically says there was *no* agreement on the laws related to production and removal of duties.
* **C: Kọmishọna na-ahụ maka azụmahịa na ụlọ ọrụ na AU nyere nkwado ya:** The passage mentions the Commissioner's statement, but it doesn't say their support *caused* the trading to start. It was the agreement on tariffs and the planned timeline that mattered.

Kedu ihe bụ akwụkwọ akụkọ Atlanta-Constitution boro ebubo ebubo ebubo na ndị ọrụ agụmakwụkwọ na-agụ akwụkwọ na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na-ajụ ileba anya n'ime nsogbu ndị achọpụtara.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""On 2009, Atlanta school officials identified schools showing signs of test manipulation. The list of schools identified showed that schools were quietly covering up a troubling pattern of internal misconduct and were doing nothing about it. Evidence later showed the tests were altered.""

This indicates the Atlanta-Constitution's report questioned why the school officials *didn't address* the troubling signs they identified. They were essentially asking *why they didn't investigate the problems they found*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mgbanwe na akụkọ Journal-Constitution:** The passage doesn't mention any changes to the Atlanta-Constitution's reporting.
*   **B: Ụlọ akwụkwọ n'ime obodo abụghị ihe ọhụrụ:** The passage says the *identification* of schools with problems was recent (2009), not that the schools themselves were new.
*   **D: Na-akọpụta nsonaazụ ule adịghị ike:** The passage says the *tests were altered*, not that the results themselves were weak.

"
"Kedu ihe na-efu na akụkọ Atlanta Journal-Constitution, n'ihi eziokwu ndị e nyere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ihe akaebe na agbanweela mpempe ule**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the investigation revealed the tests were manipulated (emetụrụ akwụkwọ ule aka). This is the central issue exposed by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution article.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmụba na-adịghị ahụkebe na arụmọrụ ule:** While the passage mentions a lack of action by school officials, the core problem highlighted by the article is the falsification of test results, not a lack of testing itself.
* **C: Onye isi ala nke afọ maka 2013:** This is irrelevant to the factual inaccuracies exposed in the testing process.
* **D: Echiche maka imeziwanye ụlọ akwụkwọ n'obodo mepere emepe:**  While this was a broader goal, the article focused specifically on the flawed testing procedures.

"Kedu ozi a maara ugbu a n'ihe gbasara ogbunigwe ahụ, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọnụ ọgụgụ nke ọnyá (The number of casualties)**.

Here's why:

The passage states:

* ""Otu ogbunigwe gbawara n'ezi ụlọ ọrụ onye isi ọchịchị."" (One bomb exploded at the seat of government.)
* ""Akụkọ ụfọdụ sịrị na mmadụ asatị nwụrụ, ma akụkọ gọọmenti sị na ihe ruru mmadụ iri atọ merụrụ ahụ..."" (Some reports say that about 4 people died, but the government report says that about 34 people were injured...)

The question asks what is known *now* about the bomb explosion. The information provided focuses on the *number of casualties* (both dead and injured).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nke ụlọ ndị dị nso mgbe ihe mgbawa gbawara (The condition of nearby buildings when the explosion occurred):** While the explosion likely damaged nearby buildings, the passage doesn't provide information about their condition.
* **C: Ọ bụrụ na bọmbụ ọzọ ga-agbapụ (Whether another bomb will explode):** The passage states that *three* more bombs went off, but doesn't say *if* another one will. It is an uncertainty, not something *known*.
* **D: ọnụ ọgụgụ gọọmentị nke ndị nwụrụ anwụ (The government's number of dead):** While the government reports a number of dead, the passage indicates that the final number is not yet known.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**.
"
Kedu ọnụọgụgụ egwuregwu Jizọs sonyere na ya kemgbe ọ sonyeere Manchester City na 2017?,"The correct answer is **B: 21**.

The question asks about the number of games Jesus played *since* joining Manchester City in 2017. The text states he joined in January 2017 and played 53 games for Palmeiras *before* that.  The question is about his games *after* joining Manchester City. The provided text doesn't state how many games he played for Manchester City, only that he played 53 games for Palmeiras. Therefore, the provided answer of 24 is incorrect; he scored 24 goals, not played 24 games.
"
Kedu otu Jizọs kwụrụ ụgwọ mmalite £27 nde?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The question states: ""Jesus di afo 21 sonyere Manchester City..."" which translates to ""Jesus at age 21 joined Manchester City...""  The text then goes on to mention the transfer fee was paid *to* Manchester City.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara ndị ọbịa ụlọ mbikọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọtụtụ ndị bịaranụ si n’obodo nsọ ahụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ụfọdụ ndị njem ala nsọ bịara ịhụ obodo nsọ n'abalị na-esote hajj..."" This indicates the visitors came *after* the Hajj.
* **Option D contradicts this:** It says many visitors came *from* the holy city itself. This isn't supported by the text. The passage implies they came from elsewhere.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Ndị ọbịa ahụ bụ ndị njem ala nsọ na Mecca:** The passage explicitly says they are pilgrims who came to see the holy city.
* **B: Ụfọdụ ndị ọbịa esighị n'ógbè ahụ:** The phrase ""Ụfọdụ ndị njem ala nsọ bịara ịhụ..."" implies that not all pilgrims were present at that particular time.
* **C: Ndị ọbịa bịara n'abalị ụbọchị hajj:** The passage specifically states they came ""n'abalị na-esote hajj"" (after the Hajj).



"
Kedu nke ziri ezi n'ime okwu ndị a dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu a?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị ọbịa ahụ rutere n'abalị nke njem Hajj.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ụfọdụ ndị njem ala nsọ bịara ịhụ obodo nsọ n'abalị na-esote hajj nọrọ n'ụlọ a."" (Some pilgrims came to see the holy city after Hajj stayed in this house.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọ dịghị onye nwụrụ** (No one died): The passage doesn't mention anyone dying.
* **B: Ndị bi na United Arab Emirates mejupụtara ndị niile bịara ya** (People from the United Arab Emirates make up everyone who came): The passage only mentions that people from the UAE frequently visit the house, not that they are the *only* visitors.
* **D: Ọtụtụ n'ime ndị bịara ya bụ ụmụ amaala Mecca** (Many of those who came were Mecca residents): The passage doesn't specify if a large number of visitors were residents of Mecca. It only states that pilgrims came to see the city.

Kedu nkọwa nke mkpọka ahụ na-enweghị mgbagwoju anya n'ihe gbasara akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ebe ihe mkpofu dị** (Where the debris is).

Here's why:

The passage states the object ""sukọrọ ọnụ maịlị 491 n’elu Eluụwa"" (traveled 491 miles over Eluụwa). It also mentions that scientists are trying to determine ""ibu mkpọka ahụ dị ma etu ọ ga-esi emetụta Uwa"" (how massive the object is and how it will affect the Earth).  However, it **doesn't** explicitly state *where* the debris from the object has landed. The other options are mentioned in the passage: the size of the object (okeke nke nkukota) and the location where the event occurred (ebe ihe mberede ahụ mere).

Therefore, the only detail *not* explicitly provided is the location of the debris.
"
"Kedu ihe amabeghị gbasara nkukota a, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ọnụ ọgụgụ ziri ezi nke nkukota ahụ (The exact number of satellites)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Satịlaịtị ndị ahụ, *abụọ nke na-anyị arụ karịa nke gafere paụnd 1,000*...""  The wording ""abụọ nke na-anyị arụ karịa nke gafere"" is vague. We don't know the *exact* number of satellites involved. The passage doesn't state a precise number. The other options are addressed:

*   **A: Kedu onye ga-ahụ maka ịchụ nta ihe:** The passage explicitly mentions the United States Strategic Command is monitoring the situation.
*   **B: ọsọ nke Satellites na-aga tupu ha agbaa:** The passage provides the speed as 17,500 miles per hour.
*   **C: Otu a ga-esi akọwapụta nsonaazụ nyocha site na nkata:** The passage states the research results will be released on a public website.

Therefore, the ambiguity regarding the *exact* number of satellites is the missing information highlighted in the question.

"
Kedu ihe ụgwọ Gọvanọ Arnold Schwarzenegger agụnyeghị?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntaramahụhụ ego maka ndị mejọrọ**.

Here's why:

* The question asks about the *fine* (ụgwọ) Schwarzenegger imposed.
* The passage states a $1000 fine for ""any violation"" (ntaramahụhụ) related to distributing violent video games to minors.
* Options A and C describe the law itself or the action being prohibited, not the fine.
* Option D describes a requirement for labeling, not a fine.



"
"Kedu onye tụfuru ihe a na-ekwu, dabere na akụkụ akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ụmụ Duvall**.

Here's why:

The quote is from Mila Duvall. She's describing Mike talking a lot, and that she wasn't paying attention because she was supporting him.  Since Mila is a child of Duval and also a child herself (meaning she is a grandchild), she is part of the Duvall family.
"
"Dabere na paragraf ahụ, kedụ n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara ahụmịhe ntị Miller ziri ezi?","The correct answer is **B: Ka ọ nọ na-akwado, o yiri ka o nweghị mmasị.**

Here's why:

* **The paragraph states:** ""Mila kwuru, """"Mike na-ekwu ọtụtụ okwu mgbe a na-eme ọnụnụ ahụ...anọ m na-akwado ya mere na anụghị m ihe ọ na-ekwu."""" ""
* **This means:** While Mila *says* she was supporting Duvall, she wasn't actually listening to what he was saying.  Her actions (supporting him) contradicted her attentiveness (not hearing what he said).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: N'oge a na-ege ntị, Duvall hapụrụ mmetụta na Miller:** The paragraph doesn't say Duvall had any effect on Miller.
* **C: N'ime oge ikpe a, ụmụ Duvall abụọ kwuru ọtụtụ ihe:** The paragraph only quotes Mila, not both of Duvall's children.
* **D: Ọ nọ na-ege ntị nke ọma n'ihe Duvall na-ekwu:** This is the opposite of what Mila stated.

"""Onye nyere aro ka agbanwee """"Iwube ikuku dị ọcha""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Otu Republican**.

The text states: ""Layton arịọla maka mgbanwe nye akwụkwọ iwu gburugburu ebe obibi nke ndị otu ọdịkaọgadị mgbe ya na PM nwere nnọkọ...""

This indicates that Jack Layton, representing the political party of the Indigenous people, requested changes to the ""Clean Air Act.""  The question asks who *suggested* the change, and Layton is the one making the request. The text also mentions that the government took action regarding Mersey Hospital, which is a key point of contention for the Indigenous political parties.

John Howard (A) defended the government's actions. Stephen Harper (D) is mentioned as the Prime Minister of Canada, who is not relevant to the situation.

Therefore, the answer is **B**.
"
"""Kedu onye rụrụ ụka nkwuputa na """"Clean Air Act"""" bụ gimmick tupu ntuli aka?""","The correct answer is **A: Onye nnọchi anya steeti**.

The text states: ""tupu nleba anya nke abụọ, ma emechaa nzukọ ga-ewe ya na onye isi NDP bụ Jak Leeton... ** ndị ome iwu gọọmenti etiti ekwuola okwu megide omume a sị na ọ bụ mere mere n'ihu maka ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị gọọmenti etiti na-abịa na Nọvemba.**""

This indicates that the state opposition (represented by "" ndị ome iwu gọọmenti etiti"") argued that the Clean Air Act was a gimmick before the election.
"
"Mgbe ihe melamine na cyanuric acid na-emeghachi omume na mmamịrị nwamba, gịnị si na ya pụta?","The correct answer is **A: Akụrụ (Kidney)**.

The text states that the crystals formed from melamine and cyanuric acid were found in the kidneys of the deceased pets. It also mentions that these crystals can cause kidney damage. Therefore, the most direct consequence of the chemical reaction is damage to the kidneys.
"
Gịnị bụ ihe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị pụrụ ịhụ na-eji infrared spectroscopy?,"The correct answer is **B: crystallization nke mmamịrị anụ ụlọ.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the researchers used FTIR (infrared spectroscopy) to *examine the crystals* found in the animal bones. FTIR is a technique used to identify the chemical composition of materials, and in this case, they used it to analyze the crystals formed from the combination of melamine and cyanuric acid.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ịrụ ọrụ akụrụ (Brain function):** The passage says the chemical combination *could* impair brain function, but FTIR directly doesn't *see* brain function. It analyzes the *crystals*.
* **C: Emetụta anụmanụ (Animal poisoning):** While the crystals are a sign of poisoning, FTIR isn't used to *detect* the poisoning itself. It's used to analyze the *evidence* of the poisoning (the crystals).
* **D: Nri anụ ụlọ na-adịghị mma (Contaminated animal feed):**  The feed being contaminated is the *cause* of the crystals, but FTIR analyzes the *crystals* themselves, not the feed.

"""E ji nkebi ahịrịokwu ahụ """"Queen of Extreme"""" kọwaa Luna?""","The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tomi Drima sị na """"Luna bụ Eze nwaanyị ihe ngabiga oke nke mbụ. Onye nlekwa ọrụ m nke mbụ. Luna nwụrụ n'abalị ọnwa abụọ. Ọ pụrụ iche dị ka ya. Nwaanyị siri ike.""""  The phrase ""Queen of Extreme"" is directly attributed to Tommy Dreamer."
"""Ònye kọwara Luna dị ka onye """"na-akpa ike""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

"
Gịnị kwesịrị ime onye ọkwọ ụgbọala ihe mberede mere?,"The correct answer is **A: E merụrụ ya n'isi**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Onweghi onye nime ha meruru ahu mgbe ugbo-ala ahu kuru ya. N'agbanyeghị nke a, onye ọkwọ ụgbọ merụrụ ezigbo ahụ n'isi."" (None of them were injured when the landslide came. However, the driver suffered serious injuries to the head.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndị niile bi n’ụlọ ahụ nọ na-enwere onwe ha mmerụ ahụ ya:** The passage states *no one* was injured, except the driver.
* **C: E zigara ya n'ụlọ ọgwụ dị na Great Yarmouth site na otu na Cambridge:** He was initially taken to Great Yarmouth and *then* transferred to Cambridge.  The passage doesn't say he was *sent* from Yarmouth to Cambridge.
* **D: Ndị ọrụ mberede nyeere ya aka ịhapụ ụgbọ ala ya:** While the passage mentions the emergency responders helped him, the main focus of the question is what happened *to him* as a result of the incident.  His injuries are the key element.



"
Omume ndị otu South Africa mere n'oge asọmpi rugby enweghị ntụpọ n'ụzọ ọ bụla?,"The correct answer is **B: Ike ijikwa bọọlụ (Ball control)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""Ụzọ mkpachapụ anya ha n’ime mgbochi, ka ha si ejide bọọlụ ma ụzọ nhàzi pụrụ iche mere ha pụọ iche..."" This directly points to their strong ball control as a key factor in their victory.

While the other options might be true to some extent, the passage *doesn't* highlight them as the *primary* or defining factor in their win. The focus is on their ball control leading to creative plays and ultimately, victory.
"
"Kedu ihe egwuregwu South Africa malitere ịka mma, dịka akụkụ nke ya si dị?","The correct answer is **C: Ka e meriri Zambia**.

The passage states: ""Ndi kachasị elu na asọmpi bu South Africa bidoro na akara nke oma mgbe ha nwere mmeri ntụsara ahụ nke 26 - 00 megide Zambia gbara mkprụ nke 5."" This directly links their good start to their victory over Zambia.

Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara akụ na ụba China na-akwadoghị site na akụkụ ahụ?,"The statement that doesn't align with the text is **D: Germany na-ebupụ ụgbọala karịa China mgbe niile (Germany is building more ships than China ever has).**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""n’agbanyeghị na ha nọ na kọmunisti steeti, China akwalitela azụmaahia obodo ha. E mepụtara mmezi akụ na ụba mbụ n’okpuru ọchịchị nke Deng Xiaoping.

* The text directly contrasts China's ship building with Germany's. It says China built *more* ships than Germany in the previous year. Therefore, the statement that Germany is building more than China *ever* has is incorrect and contradicts the provided information.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Kemgbe emejuputa mgbanwe mgbanwe, aku na uba China abawanyela nke ukwuu (Since reforms, China's economy has grown significantly).**  This is a general statement that is implied by the whole passage detailing China's economic success.

* **B: E jiri ya tụnyere United States, China nwere nnukwu ahịa mbupụ maka ụgbọ ala (Compared to the United States, China has a large shipbuilding market).** The text mentions China's growing shipbuilding market and its importance as a market for shipbuilding companies.

* **C: GDP China nwere ike karịa nke United States n'ọdịnihu (China's GDP could be greater than that of the United States in the future).** The passage indicates significant economic growth, implying a potential future rise in GDP. While not explicitly stated, it's a logical inference.



**Therefore, the correct answer is D.**"
"Kedu mgbe GDP China nwere ike gafere nke United States, ka akụkụ ahụ kwuru?","The correct answer is **B: Afọ iri abụọ site ugbu a**.

The text states: ""Kemgbe ahụ, akụnụba obodo Chaịna ejirila mmaji iri itolu too. Nke a bụ mbụ ọ na-eme, n'afọ gara aga Chaịna bupuru ụgbọala karịa Jamani ma gafere Amerịka dịka ahịa kachasị ukwuu maka ụlọọrụ a. Aku na Uba mba China nwere ike idi ukwu karia nke mba United State na agbata ogu-afo abuo.""

Then, the question asks when China's GDP might surpass the United States. The text implies this will happen ""na agbata ogu-afo abuo"" (in two decades) after the events described (the past 33 years of economic reform). Therefore, ""Afọ iri abụọ site ugbu a"" (Twenty years from now) is the most logical answer.
"
Gịnị bụ ndụmọdụ Hu maka mba ndị ka na-emepe emepe?,"The correct answer is **D: Na-ezere imetọ ụzọ ochie**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Hu gbara obodo ndị na emepe emepe ume """"ka ha ghara itinye aka n'usoro omume mgbe ochie bụ ibu ụzọ metọọ were kpochawa ma emechaa."""" "" This translates to Hu urging developing countries to avoid the old, heavily polluting industrial path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nabata ibu ọrụ ndị na-eme ka ha nwee ọganihu:** While the passage talks about economic development, the emphasis isn't on encouraging *more* work. It's about *how* they develop.
* **B: Tụlee mmepụta akụ na ụba:** The passage mentions monitoring China's economic development but doesn't advocate for developing countries to simply pursue more industrial output.
* **C: Na-aga n'ihu na karịa ọrụ ha dị ugbu a:**  This contradicts Hu's warning about not exceeding their capacity and avoiding old polluting methods.



"
Gịnị ka Hu hapụrụ ikwu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndụmọdụ maka mba ndị na-apụta maka mmetọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Hu is urging developing countries to ""not participate in the old pattern of simply developed countries first methodically clearing and then completing."" He also says, ""they should not burden themselves beyond their means."" This clearly indicates he is offering advice or recommendations to these countries regarding their approach to emissions reduction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ihe kpatara mbelata (The cause of reduction):** The passage doesn't discuss the cause of the reduction, only the target and the approach.
* **C: Ụbọchị ezubere iche maka mbelata ikuku carbon (A specific date set for carbon emission reduction):** While a target year (2020) is mentioned, the passage doesn't focus on a specific date for a *different* reduction target.
* **D: Ọnụ ego nke mbelata nke ikuku carbon (The cost of carbon emission reduction):**  The passage mentions payment for emission reductions, but the focus is on the *approach* and *advice* given, not the cost itself.



"
"N'okwu Veerman, ònye n'ime ihe ndị a kọwara ọnọdụ ahụ nke ọma?","The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Here's why:

*   Richard Veerman's quote directly states, ""Angola na-agaru maka ntiwapụ ya kacha njọ mgbe ọ bụla..."" (Angola is surging for its worst outbreak ever...).

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọgwụ na-enweghị oke (Medicine without borders):** This is the name of the organization, not the location being discussed.
*   **C: Mangola:** This is likely a misspelling of Angola.
*   **D: Wọld Helt Ọganaịzeshọn (World Health Organization):** This is another organization mentioned, but not the focus of Veerman's statement.

"
Kedu onye ga-ejupụta oche nke Huhne ugbu a ka ndị ikpe amalitela?,"The correct answer is **A: Davey**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP ka ana atu-anya ka owere oru onye ozi azumahia Davey na apu-apu."" This means Ed Davey is being considered as Huhne's replacement. The question asks who will fill Huhne's seat *now that the trial is starting*, and the text indicates Davey is the likely replacement.
"
"Mgbe ikpe ahụ gasịrị, onye ga-eweghara ọrụ dị ka Minista Azụmahịa?","The correct answer is **C: Davey**.

The text states: ""Norman Lamb MP ka ana atu-anya ka owere oru onye ozi azumahia Davey na apu-apu."" This translates to ""Norman Lamb MP is being considered as the successor to the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change Davey."" Since Huhne and Pryce are facing legal consequences, Davey is expected to take over the role.
"
Kedu ihe ndị na-eme ihe nkiri na-agba ndị na-ege ntị ume ka ha mee mgbe ha na-ege opera nke Camille Saint-Saens?,"The correct answer is **C: Bịa soro ha mee ihe na ogbo**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the opera is about a ""love for Japan and its vitality.""
* It then says that performers are being invited to ""join them on stage.""
* Therefore, the performers are inviting others to participate in the performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jiri wii wii:** This is nonsensical and not related to the passage.
* **B: Gaa na Japan:** While the opera is *about* Japan, the passage doesn't say performers are being invited to travel to Japan.
* **D: Kwe ka ihe ha hụrụ n'anya na-achị ndụ ha:**  This refers to the subject matter of the opera, not what the audience or performers are being asked to *do*.



"
"N'oge opera, onye na-afụ ọnụ nkwonkwo ugboro ugboro?","The correct answer is **C: Ndị na-ese ihe**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the opera depicts a love and fascination with Japanese culture and its vitality.  Because of this, the performers (ndị na-ese ihe - the actors/performers) are embracing the aesthetic. The question asks about *who* is repeatedly imitating the sound of a flute *during* the opera. Since the opera reflects a Japanese theme and the performers are embracing this, it logically follows that *the performers* would be imitating the flute sound.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: onye edemede (the writer)** - While the writer *created* the opera, the question asks about something that happens *during* the performance.
*   **B: Ndị na-ekiri na-asụ French (the audience speaks French)** - This is irrelevant to the opera's content or the actions performed during it.
*   **D: Saint-Saens, Camille** - Saint-Saens is the composer. While his music is central, he wouldn't be repeatedly imitating a flute sound *during* the performance.



"
Kedu okwu ọzọ ị ga-eji kọwaa ''spacewalk'' Leonov?,"The correct answer is **A: Njem Apollo-Soyuz**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Leonov's spacewalk was part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọsọ Oghere** - While spacewalks involve venturing into space, ""ọsọ oghere"" (space race) refers to the competition between the US and USSR to achieve milestones in space exploration, not the specific act of a spacewalk.
* **C: ọrụ ụgbọ ala inyeaka** - This translates to ""auxiliary ship operations"" and doesn't relate to a spacewalk.
* **D: Onye na-ahụ maka oghere nke 11** - This translates to ""the person responsible for hatch number 11"" and is completely unrelated to Leonov's spacewalk.



"
Kedu ozi Leonov duziri maka Soviet Union?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ka afọ iri gachara, o duuru ngalaba Sọviet nke ozi Apolo Soyuz nke gosiri na ọsọ gbasara oghere mpụga uwa eruola na njedebe."" This directly links Leonov to the Apollo-Soyuz mission, which was a significant event showcasing Soviet capabilities in space.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Asọmpi oghere:** While the space race was a context, the passage doesn't state that Leonov *made* the space race. It mentions the Apollo-Soyuz mission as a result of space exploration.
*   **C: Onye na-ahụ maka oghere nke 11:** This is a detail about Leonov's ranking, not the significant event he's known for.
*   **D: EVA:** EVA (Extravehicular Activity) is the specific event he performed, but it's *part of* the larger Apollo-Soyuz mission that made a broader impact.



"
Kedu onye merụrụ ahụ n'ihe mberede ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The passage states: ""Mgbe ihe mberede ahụ mechara, e buru Gibson gawa n’ụlọ ọgwụ mana ọ nwụrụ mgbe obere oge gachara."" This directly indicates that Gibson suffered the injury and died as a result of the incident.
"
Gịnị mere ndị kpatara ihe mberede ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Otu nwụrụ ma onye nke ọzọ emerụghị ahụ**.

Here's why:

* The passage states ""Mgbe ihe mberede ahụ mechara, e buru Gibson gawa n’ụlọ ọgwụ mana ọ nwụrụ mgbe obere oge gachara."" This means Gibson died.
* It also says, ""Ọkwọ ụgbọ gwongworo ahụ, nke gbara afọ 64, emerụghị ahụ na mkpọka ahụ."" This indicates the van (not Gibson) was damaged.
* Therefore, one entity (Gibson) died, and another (the van) was damaged.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onye ọ bụla nwụrụ.**  Only Gibson is explicitly stated to have died.
* **C: Ha nọ na-akwa ákwá ma na-akwa ákwá.** The passage mentions children shouting and pointing, but doesn't imply they *caused* the accident.
* **D: Ha abụọ merụrụ ahụ.** Only the van is stated to have been damaged.



"
Kedu n'ime mmetụta ndị a ka ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị na-arụ ọrụ na mmemme ahụ nwere olileanya ịhụ?,"The answer is **C: Obere irighiri ihe (Substructures)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tiori a na-ekwu na imirikiti mata dị oji gburugburu otu ụyọkọ kpakpando dị na gburugburu otu ụyọkọ kpakpando n'otu ụdị halo, ma e mejupụtara ya site n'ọtụtụ urughuru dị obere."" This directly indicates that scientists hope to observe these smaller, fainter structures.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ahụkarị isiokwu (Common Features):** While the passage mentions the *goal* is to understand how the Milky Way interacts with Sagittarius, it doesn't specifically state scientists are primarily looking for *common features*.
*   **B: Ndị agha ebili mmiri (Waterfalls):** The passage mentions ""elili mmiri"" (waterfalls) as an analogy, but this is a metaphorical description of the interaction and not a primary target of observation.
*   **D: Isi ihe dị nchara (Bright Objects):** The passage describes the structures as ""dị obere"" (small), suggesting they are likely *faint*, not bright. The focus is on the fainter, smaller components.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ndị nchọpụta na-amụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Milky Way na ụyọkọ kpakpando Sagittarius**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the research is about how the Milky Way galaxy interacts with the Sagittarius galaxy.
* It mentions the impact of this interaction on the galactic halo.
* The passage discusses the alignment of galactic disks and the effect of tidal forces.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọnwa na Milky Way:** The passage doesn't mention the moon.
* **B: Sagittarius galaxy na mbara ala ụwa:** The focus is on the interaction between the Milky Way and the Sagittarius galaxy, not the Sagittarius galaxy's impact on Earth.
* **C: Ọnwa na Ụwa:**  Same reasoning as option A.



"
Kedu ihe na-adịghị n'okpuru nkatọ site na conservatives na ìhè nke Itie?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmefu maka ebumnuche mmadụ (Humanitarian failures)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the criticism of the response to Hurricane Katrina, specifically highlighting failures in the financial and recovery efforts. The passage mentions accusations of misappropriation of funds and a lack of effective recovery strategies.

Conservatives and the right-wing criticized the response to Katrina for its **humanitarian failures**. They argued that the government's response was inadequate in addressing the needs of the affected population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mmgbalị ezughị ezu iji wughachi (Failed attempts at recovery):** While the passage mentions failed recovery attempts, it doesn't explicitly state that conservatives *didn't* criticize these attempts. In fact, they likely did.
*   **C: Kedu onye na-enweta nkwekọrịta maka mwughachi (Who received credit for the recovery):** The passage implies a lack of credit given to those genuinely responsible, pointing to the controversy surrounding the ""Bush-ọi-nsi agreement."" However, the core criticism wasn't *who* received credit, but *how* the recovery was handled.
*   **D: Na-emefu na nrụzi (Fraud and corruption):** The passage does mention accusations of fraud and corruption but highlights the broader humanitarian failures as the central issue of contention.

Therefore, the most directly relevant criticism from conservatives and the right-wing, according to the passage, centered on the **humanitarian failures** of the response to Hurricane Katrina.



"
Kedu onye na-emegide nkwekọrịta mwughachi maka mbọ enyemaka Hurricane Katrina?,"The answer is **D: Ndị ọkachamara na Washington**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nnyocha nke mgbalị nrụgharị chere ihu na-enye ndị e chere na ha bụ ndị si Wọshịntịn ọrụ nrụgharị."" This implies that experts *in Washington* were involved in and potentially critical of the recovery efforts. The phrasing suggests a negative evaluation of the efforts by those within the Washington bureaucracy.
"
"Ebee ka a ga-ahụ ọkụ si n'ụgbọelu Stardust na mbụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **B: North California**.

The passage states: ""a na-atụanya na ọ ga-eme otu ihe ngosi ọkụ maka ndị enyi anyị nọ na Ebe ugwu Kaifonịa, Ọregọn, Nevada, na Yutaa."" and later ""Ọ ga agafe ụsọ oke osimiri ọdịda anyanwụ nke northern Kalifonia..."" This indicates that the initial visual display (the shooting star) will be most prominent in Northern California.
"
"A na-akọ na ụgbọ elu ahụ ga-agbaji n'ime ndekọ ndị a, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ụzọ kachasị ọsọ si San Francisco gaa Los Angeles**.

The text explicitly states: ""ụsọ oke osimiri ọdịda anyanwụ nke northern Kalifonia ma mukekwaa ihu igwe site na Kalifonia gafee central Ọregọn rukwaa na Nevada na Idaho ruo n'ime Utah"" and ""ọsịịsọ zuru oke iji site na San Francisco ruo Los Angeles n'otu nkeji."" This directly relates to the speediest route between those two cities.
"
Mmekọrịta dị n'etiti Saroja Balasubramanian na Dr. Malar Balasubramanian amabeghị?,"The correct answer is **C: Nne**.

The text states ""Ọ dụrụ ndị ọrụ nche gaa na Oldsmobile Intrigue ojii ya nke nọ n’ụzọukwu narị ise n’itoanya. Achọtara ozu Saroja Balasubramanian, onye dị afọ iri ise na atọ, ebe ahụ, ja akwa mkpuchi kpudoro ya.""  This implies Saroja Balasubramanian is the deceased, and the news is about her death. The question asks about the relationship. The text implies Dr. Malar Balasubramanian is the daughter of Saroja Balasubramanian.  Therefore, they were mother and daughter.
"
Ebee ka achọtara ozu Sara Balasubramanian?,"The correct answer is **B: N'akụkụ okporo ụzọ**.

The passage states: ""Achọtara ozu Saroja Balasubramanian, onye dị afọ iri ise na atọ, ebe ahụ, ja akwa mkpuchi kpudoro ya.""  This means her body was found *beside* the road.
"
Kedu ihe eBay zụtara?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The question states that eBay is investing heavily in Skype to expand its user base and increase its presence in regions like China, Europe, and Brazil.
"
Kedu ihe eBay chọrọ imezu site na ịzụta?,"The correct answer is **B: Mee ka mpaghara ala gị gbasaa**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states eBay's goal is to ""gbasa ụmụ isi mmalite uru ya"" (expand its core market) and make its brand ""amara n’ebe... dịka...guzosịrị ike"" (well-known in regions where Skype is firmly established). This directly translates to expanding its geographic reach.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Chịkọta ego ya (Collect its money):** While eBay certainly makes money, the primary reason for this expansion isn't just about collecting more money; it's about growth and market share.
* **C: Mee ka ọ pụta ìhè (Make it stand out):**  While increased brand awareness is a benefit of expansion, it's a *result* of expanding, not the primary goal.
* **D: Ime ihe ga-atọ ndị nwe ya ụtọ (Make its shareholders happy):** This is a consequence of success, but not the direct objective stated in the text.

"Ònye, dị ka Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo, na-ezere iso ndị mkpọrọ fọdụrụ n'ogige ahụ mgbe agha ahụ gasịrị na-akpakọrịta?","The answer is **A: Ndị na-akparịta ụka (The mediators)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ndị mkparịta ụka nwara ịweta udo, mana ihe ndị mkpọrọ chọrọ edoghi anya."" This means the mediators were trying to bring peace and resolution but were unsuccessful. The question asks who avoided the remaining prisoners after the fire. Since the mediators failed to achieve peace, it's implied that the prisoners were left to fend for themselves, and the mediators didn't stay to deal with the aftermath.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndị otu nnapụta maka ndị ọrụ mgbanyụ ọkụ (The rescue team):** Their job was to extinguish the fire and rescue the prisoners; they wouldn't necessarily avoid them.
*   **C: Ndị isi (The leaders):** The passage doesn't mention any leaders.
*   **D: Ndị ọrụ ahụike (The medical staff):** While they might have been involved, the passage doesn't specifically say they avoided the prisoners. The focus is on the mediators and the prisoners' reaction to the situation.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a mere ka ndị a mara ikpe gbasasịa na ọgba aghara ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Gas na-egbu egbu**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the fire started suddenly between 10:00 and 11:00 MDT.**
* **The passage mentions firefighters entering the yard and using water to extinguish the fire.** This suggests the fire was a significant and quickly spreading hazard.
* **The other options are less directly linked to *causing* the fire, although they may contribute to the situation:**
    * **A: Inwe mkparịta ụka na-amị mkpụrụ (Having dissenting voices):** This refers to the prisoners' resistance and doesn't explain the *cause* of the fire.
    * **C: Ndị mkpọrọ ndị ọzọ merụrụ ahụ (Other injured prisoners):**  While the injuries are tragic, they didn't start the fire.
    * **D: Ọkụ (Fire):** This is simply stating what happened; it doesn't explain what *caused* it.

The passage strongly implies the fire was caused by something flammable, and ""gas na-egbu egbu"" (flammable gas) is the most logical explanation for a sudden and rapidly spreading fire in this scenario.



"
"Kedu ihe Iran kwesịrị iwepụ onwe ya, ka Ayatollah Ali Khamenei siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: ịdabere na mmanụ**.

The passage states: ""Onye isi kacha ndị isi obodo nke obodo ahụ, onye aha ya bụ Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, kọwatara ndabere na mmanụ dị ka """"ọnya"""" nke bidoro tupu mgbanwe okpukpe Islam n'obodo Aịraanụ n'afọ 1979 na bụrụkwa ihe obodo kwesịrị isi na ya napụta onwe ya.""

This indicates that Khamenei believes Iran should *rely* on oil. The question asks what he says Iran should *weep* (meaning abandon or get rid of). Therefore, the answer is the opposite of what he says Iran should rely on, which is oil.
"
"Ònye kwetara mmetụta nke mmachi na Iranian aku na uba, dị ka e kwuru na akụkụ?","The correct answer is **C: Ali Khamenei, Ayatollah**.

The passage states: ""Onye isi kacha ndị isi obodo nke obodo ahụ, onye aha ya bụ Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, kọwatara ndabere na mmanụ dị ka """"ọnya"""" nke bidoro tupu mgbanwe okpukpe Islam n'obodo Aịraanụ n'afọ 1979 ma bụrụkwa ihe obodo kwesịrị isi na ya napụta onwe ya.""  This directly attributes the statement about oil being a ""gift"" to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-adịghị eme n'oge usoro ntuli aka French?,"The correct answer is **A: Igwe ịtụ vootu a na-ahụ anya**.

Here's why:

The text details a very specific and controlled voting process in France, designed to prevent cheating and ensure secrecy.  It mentions:

*   Voting envelopes being checked for their absence.
*   Voters being required to demonstrate they have not received instructions on how to vote.
*   Ballots being read aloud.
*   Scrutineers carefully counting ballots in rounds.

An ""Igwe ịtụ vootu a na-ahụ anya"" (transparent voting machine) is *not* mentioned or implied in this process. The emphasis is on human scrutiny and secrecy, not technology that allows visual inspection of the voting process. The other options are all part of the described procedure.



"
Ebee ka ndị ntuli aka na-etinye mmasị n'ọsọ ha?,"The correct answer is **B: Na mpempe akwụkwọ ebipụtalarị.**

The text states: "" ndị na-atụ ụtụ tinye akwụkwọ ebiri na ndịnihu nke na-egosi onye ha na atụrụ ụtụ n'ime akwụkwọ amachiri amachi."" This directly translates to ""those who are applying for a position place a curriculum vitae and other documents which show who they are applying for a position with in a nicely bound book.""  ""Book"" here refers to a bound collection of papers, which is most likely a printed CV or portfolio.
"
Kedu ihe kpaliri Allen ịmalite ichu nta ya afọ asatọ maka Musashi?,"The correct answer is **C: Ego ya na nyocha oke osimiri (His money and river surveys)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nchọta ahụ mezuru afọ asatọ nke Allen chọrọ Musashi. Site na’usoro imepụta maapụ nke akwa osimiri eji ROV were chota ihe mebisiri. Akoro si n’otu n’ime ndi kasi baa ogaranya n’uwa, Allen etinyela nnukwu oke aku n’uba ya n’ime oru nchoputa ihe no na mmiri iji bido icho Musashi maka nnukwu aguu onwere gbasara agha.""  This indicates Allen spent significant money on river surveys (using ROVs and sonar) to locate Musashi *before* starting the excavation.
* **Option A (Ihe ịga nke ọma ego ya - His good finances):** While money is *necessary*, the passage emphasizes the *spending* of money on surveys.  It's not about having good finances, but *how* he spent them.
* **Option B (N'ịtụle eserese nke oke osimiri - Considering river maps):**  While the maps are part of the process, they don't explain *why* he started digging. The maps were a tool to *find* the location.
* **Option D (Ịnụ ọkụ n'obi ya maka esemokwu ahụ - His enthusiasm for the story):** Enthusiasm might motivate someone, but the passage focuses on the practical steps taken and the resources invested.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Allen started digging because he invested money in river surveys to locate the shipwreck.



"
"Kedu ihe Allen mefuru nnukwu ego ya, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Nnyocha nke oké osimiri (Ocean Exploration)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Allen ""etinyela nnukwu oke aku n’uba ya n’ime oru nchoputa ihe no na mmiri iji bido icho Musashi maka nnukwu aguu onwere gbasara agha."" This directly translates to investing a large amount of money in ocean exploration using ROVs (Remotely Operated Vehicles) to search for Musashi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na-eweghachi Musashi azụ (Retrieving Musashi)** - This is the *goal* of the investment, not what the money was spent *on*.
* **C: Na-arụ ọrụ ROV (Operating ROVs)** - While ROVs were used, the money was spent on the *exploration* itself, not just operating the ROVs.
* **D: Na-amụ maapụ nke oke osimiri (Mapping the ocean)** - Mapping the ocean is part of the exploration, but the passage emphasizes the search for Musashi, implying a broader exploration effort.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that Allen invested in **ocean exploration**.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo, o yikarịrị ka ọ kpatara ọnọdụ dị ize ndụ n'ime na n'èzí osisi ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Radieshon sitere na ceium**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that cesium and iodine were found to be radioactively released from the nuclear plant. 
* Radioactive cesium is a significant health concern because it can be absorbed into the body and remain there for a long time, increasing the risk of cancer. 
* While iodine is also radioactive, the passage doesn't emphasize it as a primary health concern in this context.
* The other options (atomic power, fireballs, and the fireballs themselves) are consequences of a potential accident but aren't the immediate threat to health highlighted in the passage. The radioactive contamination is the direct cause of the danger.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị otu n'ime ndụmọdụ nchekwa enyere ndị obodo n'ihi ihe mere osisi ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Zere iku ume na anwụrụ ọkụ**.

Here's why:

* **The context:** The news reports mention radioactive cesium and iodine being detected. These are hazards that can be inhaled.
* **Why C is incorrect:** Avoiding breathing in radioactive particles is *precisely* why people are advised to stay indoors and take precautions like sealing windows.  Therefore, ""zere iku ume na anwụrụ ọkụ"" is not a helpful safety measure in this situation.
* **Why the other options are correct:**
    * **A: Zere iji ikuku ntụ oyi:** This is a common recommendation because radioactive particles can contaminate dust.
    * **B: Nọrọ n'ime ụlọ:** This helps minimize exposure to airborne radioactive particles.
    * **D: Zere ịṅụ mmiri pọmpụ:**  The water supply could be contaminated, so avoiding it is a safe precaution.



Therefore, the answer is **C**."
"Kedu ihe kacha enye nsogbu gbasara XDR-TB, n'echiche Dr. Moll?","The correct answer is **D: Ọnụ ọgụgụ ọnwụ ya dị elu**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states:  ""Dr. Moll cheere na bke ọhụrụ a na enye """"oke nsogbu ma bụrụkwa ihe egwu n'ihi ogugo ọnwụ dị elu si na ya abịa."""" ""  This directly points to the high mortality rate as the primary concern according to Dr. Moll.

While the other options are related to XDR-TB, the text doesn't highlight them as the *most* concerning.
"
Ole ndị ekwenyesiri ike na ụdị mgbanwe ọhụrụ a n'etiti ndị ọrịa bụ ndị ọkachamara ahụike?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The text states: ""Ụfọdụ ndị ọrịa enweela ike ibute ọrịa ahụ n'ụlọ ọgwụ, Dr. Moll cheere, ma ihe dị ka abụọ bụ ndị ọrụ ụlọ ọgwụ.""

Therefore, Dr. Moll specifically identified **2** healthcare workers as potentially having transmitted the XDR-TB.
"
Kedu teknụzụ nke usoro NextGen na-arụ ọrụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Teknụzụ radar nke ala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""It uses different satellite technology and ground-based radar technology to help air traffic controllers pinpoint exactly where aircraft are and also provide pilots with accurate weather information.""

While satellites are *also* part of the NextGen system, the question asks about *which technologies the system uses*.  The passage explicitly mentions both satellite technology *and* ground-based radar. Option C specifically highlights the ground-based radar technology mentioned in the text. Options A and B are not directly supported by the passage. Option D is irrelevant as the passage discusses air traffic control and weather, not carbon emissions.



"
Kedu uru bụ uru NextGen maka ndị na-ahụ maka ụgbọ elu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntinye ụgbọ elu ka mma**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that NextGen allows air traffic controllers to know the exact location of aircraft and provides pilots with accurate information. This directly translates to safer and more efficient flight paths, meaning better air traffic flow.

Let's look at why the other options aren't the best fit:

* **A: ụgbọ elu dị obere kilomita ole na ole (Airplanes fly shorter distances):** The passage doesn't mention anything about planes flying shorter distances. NextGen aims for *efficiency* not necessarily shorter routes.
* **C: Obere ikuku carbon (Lower carbon emissions):** While the passage *does* mention fuel savings, it doesn't directly connect this to lower carbon emissions. Fuel efficiency leads to less fuel burned, which *reduces* emissions, but it's not the primary benefit mentioned for pilots.
* **D: Obere mmanụ ụgbọala ojiji (Less jet fuel):** Similar to C, the passage mentions fuel savings, but this is a consequence of the system's efficiency, not a direct benefit *to* pilots.

Therefore, the improved air traffic flow and accurate information provided by NextGen directly benefit pilots by making their journeys safer and more efficient.

"Kedu akụkụ ndị FBI lekwasịrị anya ka ndị ọkọ akụkọ ihe mere eme na-agbaghabeghị, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Na-eduzi akụrụngwa maka mpụ ndị enwere ike idozi ngwa ngwa.**

Here's why:

The passage states the FBI targeted "" ụmụ okwu ụgbọ ala ezuru ezuru"" (roughly translated as ""easily led individuals"" or ""vulnerable people"") and "" ndị ozi iri maka ihe ngosi na-akpali agụụ mmekọrịta nwoke na nwanyị"" (roughly translated as ""ten witnesses for sexually motivated offenses"").  This implies they were focusing on individuals who were susceptible to manipulation and exploiting relationships.  Option B, ""Na-eduzi akụrụngwa maka mpụ ndị enwere ike idozi ngwa ngwa"" (Directing resources towards vulnerable individuals), aligns perfectly with this focus.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na-abawanye ohere nke ịga nke ọma (Increasing the chances of success):** While the ultimate goal was success in combating crime, the passage specifically highlights the *methods* used – targeting vulnerable individuals. This option is too general.
* **C: Imesi ike siri ike na ihe omume nke ikiri ndị gba ọtọ (Focusing strongly on the case of the perpetrator):** The passage doesn't indicate a strong focus on the perpetrator themselves. It's more about the individuals *affected* by the crime.
* **D: Ikpe ụgbọala na-apụ n'anya (Ship trials are disappearing):** This is completely irrelevant to the passage's content about the FBI's targeting of vulnerable individuals.



"
Gịnị bụ ọrụ FBI n'okpuru atụmatụ rụrụ arụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Nyekwuo ihe gbasara ụgbọ ala ezuru anya**.

The passage explicitly states the FBI targeted ""ụmụ okwu ụgbọ ala ezuru ezuru"" (sex trafficked victims) and used this information to promote the advancement of their investigations. This directly relates to gathering information about sex trafficking.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na-ebuli ọnụego ihe ịga nke ọma nke ụlọ ọrụ ahụ (Removing the agency's performance level):** The passage focuses on targeting victims, not improving the FBI's overall performance.
* **C: Wepụta mmejọ ndị kwesịrị ịdị mfe idozi ụzọ (Removing necessary management):** The passage doesn't mention removing management.
* **D: Ndị ọrụ na-ahụ maka ikpe metụtara porn (Agents overseeing pornography trials):** While the passage mentions trials related to sexual communication, the primary focus is on sex trafficking victims, not pornography trials in general.



"
Kedu ihe mere gwongworo ọkụ a kpọrọ n'ihe mberede JAS 39C Gripen? ,"The correct answer is **C: Ọ gbawara**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ụgbọ JAS 39C Gripen kpọkasịrị n'okporo ụzọ ụgbọelu ebe ihe dị ka 9:30 nke ụtụtụ oge obodo (0230 UTC) ma **gbawaa**..."" which translates to ""The JAS 39C Gripen aircraft crashed..."".
"
Kedu ihe amachibidoro n'ọdụ ụgbọ elu n'ihi ihe mberede JAS 39C Gripen?,"The correct answer is **A: ọrụ ụgbọ elu (flight operations)**.

The text explicitly states that ""a kagbuo njem ofufe niile n'odụ ụgbọelu a"" (all flight operations at the airport were suspended) due to the incident.
"
Ònye natara ndụmọdụ n'aka Brzezinski n'oge Mgbanwe nke Iran?,"The correct answer is **C: Carter**.

The text explicitly states: ""N’ime nghọpụta nke 1976, ọ dụrụ Carter ndụmọdụ gbasara iwu ndị mba ofesi..."" (In the 1976 election, he advised Carter on foreign policy...).  This means Carter was the one who sought Brzezinski's advice during the Iranian Revolution.
"
"Ruo 1977, ònye jere ozi dị ka onye ndụmọdụ nchekwa obodo?","The correct answer is **A: Brzezinski**.

The text states: ""Dịka NSA, o nyere Carter aka n’ijikwa ihe omume mbaụwa..."" and that he became NSA *from* Henry Kissinger in 1977.  Therefore, Brzezinski was the National Security Advisor *from* 1977 onwards.

Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a gbasara oge Bobek na Partizan Belgrade bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Mgbe ọ bụ onye otu, ọ kpakọbara ihe karịrị 468 mgbaru ọsọ.**

The text states he scored **403** goals and saved **468**. Therefore, he didn't save more than 468 goals.

Here's why the other options are correct:

*   **B: Ọ bụ ya bụ onye gbara ọtụtụ goolu:** The text explicitly says he scored 403 goals.
*   **C: A họpụtara ya otu oge ka ọ bụrụ onye ọkaibe n'otu egwuregwu:** The text states he was named the best player in a historic Partizan game in 1995.
*   **D: Ọ bụ onye ọkpụkpọ kacha pụta ìhè n'egwuregwu:** The text mentions he holds the record for most saves and goals in Partizan history.

So the answer is **A**."
Kedu nke bụ eziokwu gbasara ihe mere Bobek na Partizan Belgrade gara aga?,"The correct answer is **A: Na 1945, ọ bịanyere aka na-egwu Partizan.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""O sonyere ha na 1945 ma nọrọ ruo 1958."" This directly confirms that Bobek joined Partizan Belgrade in 1945.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọ bụ onye egwuregwu Zagreb tupu ọ banye Partizan Belgrade:** The passage states he was born in Zagreb and developed his skills *while playing for* Partizan, but it doesn't say he *was* a player for Zagreb beforehand.
* **C: Ọ gbaara Partizan bọọlụ ruo na 1995:** He played until 1958, not 1995.
* **D: Ọ bịara bụrụ onye ama ama ka a tụchara ụtụ chiri ya onye kacha n'egwuregwu bọọlụ nke Partizan:** While he *was* honored as the greatest player in Partizan history in 1995, the question asks about his history *with* Partizan, not his eventual recognition.

"Kedu ihe dị iche na Hesperonychus na Velociraptor, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Inwe ụkwụ abụọ (Having two legs)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Hesperonychus is a member of the Dromaeosauridae family and a relative of Velociraptor.
* It explicitly mentions that Hesperonychus ""jere ije n'ọnọdụ kwụ ọtọ n'ụkwụ abụọ nwere mbọ aka"" - meaning it walked on two legs with hand-like appendages.
* The passage does *not* say anything about the leg size, feathers, or whether it was warm-blooded.

Therefore, the most accurate difference highlighted in the text between Hesperonychus and Velociraptor is that they both had two legs. The text doesn't specify anything different about the leg size."
"""Kedu akụkụ nke ụdị 'morphological etemeete bụ isi iyi nke aha """"Hesperonychus""""?""","The correct answer is **B: Ozu ndị gbadara agbaze**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""Hesperonychus"" means ""nkpisiri odida-anyanwu"" which translates to ""dawn predator"". This refers to the claws on its hands, which are the basis for the name.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụkwụ ya (Its feet):** The text doesn't mention the feet being relevant to the name.
*   **C: Akụkụ ahụ (Its body):**  The name is specifically tied to the claws on its hands, not the overall body shape.
*   **D: Igwe imi (Its beak):** The text doesn't mention the beak being relevant to the name.



"
Kedu nke ziri ezi n'ime okwu ndị na-esote banyere agbapụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ma di ma nwunye si Texas**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""They married last year in Texas and came to Buffalo to be with family and friends for the celebration."" This directly confirms that the couple is from Texas.
* **B: Mmadụ ise merụrụ ahụ:** The passage states ""one of the four people shot"", not five.
* **C: Agbamakwụkwọ a mere na Buffalo otu afọ gara aga:** The passage states they *had* their wedding in Texas last year, not that the wedding was held in Buffalo.
* **D: Na Buffalo, e nwere égbè:** The passage does not mention anything about gangs in Buffalo.

Therefore, the only statement explicitly supported by the text is that the couple is from Texas.
"
Kedu nke bụ eziokwu n'ime okwu ndị a gbasara ememme ahụ bụ ebe a gbara egbe ahụ? ,"The correct answer is **A: Ememe ncheta Buffalo bụ ebe o mere.**

The text explicitly states: ""Ndi isi si na, ihe omume nke ncheta nke onye-obula ga ama maka ya ka aga etinye na oge na abia. Ha lụrụ di na nwunye otu afọ gara aga na Tekzas were bịa Buffalo ka ha na ndị enyi makwa ezinụlọ me mmemme."" This directly translates to the memorial event taking place in Buffalo.
"
"Kedu ihe bụ nchegbu gọọmentị mbụ gbasara Luno, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Enwere ike imerụ ndị otu ụgbọ mmiri ahụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the helicopter spotted the twelve oil rigs and determined the damage was due to a storm. While the oil spill is a major environmental concern, the *initial* government concern, as indicated by the text, is the potential for damage to the oil rigs themselves. The passage mentions that some crew members on a nearby ship were injured. The potential for damage to the rigs is the immediate and primary concern.
"
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara ọdịda Luno bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dabere n'akụkụ akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: N'oge mmebi ahụ, ụgbọ mmiri ahụ nwere mmanụ ụgbọala 100 mita.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Luno had 120-160 liters of fuel when it sank.**  It *doesn't* say it had 100 meters of fuel.  The unit is completely different.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: Arụmọrụ ahụ mere tupu ibunye ibu ahụ:** The passage explicitly states the Luno sank *after* encountering a storm and waves that flooded it.  The storm and flooding caused the sinking.
* **C: Otu onye ọrụ n'ime mmadụ iri na abụọ ahụ nwere mmerụ ahụ:** The helicopter spotted 12 crew members and reported that the incident was likely due to a wave. This implies at least one person was injured.
* **D: A manyere ụgbọ ahụ ka ọ ghara imebi mmiri:** The passage mentions the ship was traveling 100 meters away from the coastline, but the crew initially tried to prevent the ship from breaking apart.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that cannot be directly supported by the provided text.
"
Kedu mgbe Algeria nwetara nnwere onwe?,"The correct answer is **C: Afọ 1960**.

The text states: ""Na oge 1960 olaghachiri azu n’obodo Algeria nwere onwe ya ohuu ikuzi maka film directing."" This implies that Algeria gained independence around 1960.
"
Ebee ka etinyeghị ihe onyonyo maka ọrụ olili?,"The correct answer is **A: Rome nile**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ọtụtụ nnukwu igwe onyonyo n'ọtụtụ ebe na Rom, ka ndị mmadụ nwee ike kirie mmemme ahụ."" This means screens *were* placed throughout Rome.
* **The passage also states:** ""N'ọtụtụ obodo Itali ndị ọzọ ma na uwa nile, emere nkwazi dị ka ibe ya, nke ọtụtụ mmadụ hụrụ."" This means screens were placed *outside* of Rome.

Therefore, the statement ""Rome nile"" is incorrect because the passage explicitly says screens were placed *in* Rome. The other options are supported by the text.



"
Olee ebe e mere ememe ncheta?,"The correct answer is **A: N'ofe Rome niile, n'ebe dị iche iche.**

The text states: ""Itinyere ọtụtụ nnukwu igwe onyonyo n'ọtụtụ ebe na Rom..."" which translates to ""Many large screens were installed in many places in Rome..."" This indicates the event was shown throughout Rome, not just in one location. While there were also events in other places (like Poland), the question asks *where* the commemoration happened, and the text emphasizes Rome. Option C is partially correct (near St. Peter's), but A is more accurate because it emphasizes the widespread availability of screens across Rome.
"
Ònye nwetara nlekọta ahụike siri ike mgbe mgbawa ahụ gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **A: Mmadụ ise ma ọ bụ karịa**.

The text states: ""mana o pekata mpe ọ bụrụ mmadụ ise nọ n’ebe ahụ mgbe ihe mgbawa ahụ gbawara ka agwọrọ maka mgbaàmà nkụja."" (but it could have been five or more people there when the explosion occurred.)
"
Onye kwuru na mgbaze gas ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Onye ọrụ nke ụlọ ọrụ gas**.

The passage states: ""Onye-oru ulo-oru mmanu-oku gas no na nzaghachi na ogige ahu mgbe otu onye-agbata-obi kpochara banyere mmiputa nke mmanu-oku gas."" This translates to ""A gas technician went to the site and responded when an investigator questioned him about the gas leak."" Therefore, the gas technician reported the leak.
"
"Mmadụ ole nwụrụ na mwakpo a, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: 5**.

The text states that Nicholas Alden (25) and Zachary Cuddeback (21) died. It also mentions Edgar Veguilla was injured and Kristoffer Schneider was injured. That's a total of 5 people affected.
"
Kedu ngwa ọgụ gbara ọkụ n'oge ụfọdụ n'oge mwakpo ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Uka**.

The passage states: ""Ngwa agha Uka dara dị ka ọ tụwara ya n’isi ony nke ise."" This translates to ""The Uka weapon fell as if it had struck him on the head.""
"
Kedu n'ime egwuregwu ndị a ka kọmitii Olympic kpebiri na ha agaghị etinye?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

The text states: ""bezbọọlụ na sọftbọọlụ, ndị e si n'Egwuregwu Olympic wepụ n'afọ 2005."" This indicates baseball was *already* removed, and therefore not among the sports the IOC is currently considering for inclusion. The question asks which sport the committee *decided not to include* in this current round of consideration. The passage doesn't explicitly say any were rejected, but it highlights that baseball and softball were removed previously, and therefore are not currently in the running. The question is tricking you into thinking about which sport *wasn't* added this time.
"
Kọmitii Olympic nke mba ụwa tozuru oke itinye n'ime egwuregwu ndị a na asọmpi a?,"The correct answer is **A: Rollersports**.

The text states: ""Egwuregwu Rugbi, njikọ n'ahụ maka rugbi kpọmkwem, na gọlf ka ahọọrọ n'ime egwuregwu ise ndị ọzọ ka a ga atụle ma ọ ga eso na Olimpik. Egwuregwu skwash, karate na **rola spọts nwakwara** ịbanye na mmemme Olympic...""

This indicates that rollersports is one of the sports being considered for inclusion. The other options (Baseball and Softball) are explicitly mentioned as having been removed in 2005.
"
Afọ ole ka Arthur Guinness gbazitere na mbụ ụlọ ebe a na-eme mmanya St. James' Gate Brewery?,"The correct answer is **B: 10**.

The question asks how many years Arthur Guinness initially leased the St. James' Gate Brewery. The passage states he leased it for ""uuo iteghete"" which translates to ""ninety-six years"". The options don't include 96, but they do include 10, which is the number of years mentioned in the text."
"Ego ole ka Guinness na-eme kwa afọ, na nkezi?","The correct answer is **B: 250**.

Here's why:

The question asks for the *average* annual revenue *over 250 years*. The prompt states that over 250 years, Guinness earned over €10 billion *per month*. To find the average annual revenue, we need to calculate:

€10 billion/month * 12 months/year = €120 billion/year

However, the question asks for an *option* from the provided choices. The most reasonable interpretation is that the question is highlighting the 250-year timeframe as key to the incredible success, and that the average annual revenue is related to that number. While the raw revenue is far higher, the options provided point towards 250 as being central to the narrative.  Therefore, 250 is the best answer among those offered, implying the 250-year period of operation.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 9** is too low and doesn't reflect the scale of Guinness's success.
*   **C: 14** is also too low.
*   **D: 10** is also significantly lower than the actual revenue.



"
Achọtara nje H5N1 na mba ole nke European Union?,"The correct answer is **C: Asaa**.

The text states: ""Frans bụ mba nke asaa n'ọgbakọ Iroopu ịta ahụhụ n'ihi ọrịa a; osotere Ọstrịa, Jemani, Slovenia, Bọlgeria, Gris na Itali.""  This translates to ""France is the seventh country in the European Union outbreak for this disease; besides Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Greece and Italy.""

Therefore, France is the 7th country, meaning there are a total of seven countries in the EU affected.
"
Ebee ka achọpụtara ikpe nje H5N1 kacha ọhụrụ?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The text states: ""N'ụbọchị Mọnde, n'ala mpịtọ dị Lyon nso nke dị n'ọwụwa anyanwụ mba Frans, ka achọpụtara..."" which translates to ""On Monday, in the plain near Lyon in the northwest of France, it was discovered...""
"
Olee mgbe Haiti nwetara ọrịa ikpeazụ tupu ndị ọrụ udo agbasa ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Oge nke 1800s**.

The text states: ""Tupu ndị agha abịarute, Haiti ezutebeghị nsogbu ndị metụtara ọrịa ahụ kemgbe oge ndị 1800.""
"
Kedu ụdị ihe mkpofu nyeere ọrịa ahụ aka ịgbasa site na ebe mbụ ya?,"The correct answer is **B: Ogige ndị UN**

The text states: ""Ndị a na-ata ụta maka nkesa ọrịa ahụ nke malitere n’akụkụ kampụ ndị agha ahụ."" and later ""ehichaghị ọfụma mkpofu si na kampụ UN..."" This clearly indicates the UN camps were the source of the contaminated waste that spread the disease.
"
Kedu ihe gọọmentị Irish chọrọ ime?,"The best answer is **B: Wetuo usoro iwu siri ike maka iji ọgwụ eme ihe.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Gọọmentị mba Ireland na-adọ aka na ntị maka mkpa ọ dị ka ndị omeiwu dozie ọnọdụ ahụ...ikpe mpu na aga eti iwu a ozugbo enwere ike."" This indicates a need for stricter legal frameworks.
* **The text mentions:**  ""mịnịsta na-ahụ maka Ahụike gosiri nchegbu ya maka ọdịmma nke ndị mmadụ ndị gbasoro uru nwa oge nta dị na nnabata ọgwụ ike ndị ahụ, ma maka amamikpe ndị nke metụtara ọgwụ e nyefere kamgbe mgbanwe ndị na-abụghịzi iwu ugbu a banyere n'ọrụ."" This points to the need to regulate drug use and the distribution/prescribing of drugs.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Nye ndị dara ọgwụ ọjọọ ikpe:** While legal consequences might be part of the solution, the text focuses more on establishing rules and frameworks.
* **C: Wetuo obi n'ụkpụrụ na-achịkwa iji ọgwụ eme ihe:**  The text doesn't focus on moralizing, but rather on practical legal and regulatory approaches.
* **D: Na-akwado ọgwụ ike:** The text highlights concerns about drug use and the need for stricter control, not promotion.



"
Kedu ihe Ireland nyere iwu nwa oge?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọgwụ (Medicine)**.

The passage states that the Irish government is concerned about the need to regulate access to medication, particularly for those benefiting from age-related healthcare. It mentions ""ọgwụ ike ndị ahụ"" which translates to ""medicines"" or ""health products.""  The concerns revolve around the current legal ambiguity regarding medication provided after changes to non-statutory operations.
"
Kedu mmejọ ka a na-enyocha onye eboro ebubo?,"The correct answer is **C: Omume mpụ (Extortion)**.

The text states: ""Kristofa Gashia, onye nkwuchite okwu ngalaba uwe ojii nke Lọs Anjeles, sị na nwoke ahụ nke a na enyocha gbasara mmebi iwu bụ maka njehie oke m'ọbụghị maka mmebi ihe."" This translates to: ""Kristofa Gashia, a spokesperson for the Los Angeles Police Department, said that the man being investigated for a law violation is not for theft.""  The subsequent explanation about the tarpaulins and the ""O"" being changed to ""e"" indicates that the investigation is related to extortion, where someone is demanding something (in this case, seemingly money or favors) under threat.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Omume mpụ (Extortion)**.



"
Kedu ihe onye a na-enyo enyo na-emeghị mgbe ọ gbanwere akara?,"The correct answer is **A: Hazie otu n'ime mkpụrụedemede ahụ.**

Here's why:

The text states that Kristofa Gashia used tarpaulins with ""symbols of peace and love"" to *change* the ""O"" into the letter ""e"". This implies he *replaced* the ""O"" with an ""e,"" meaning he had to manipulate or modify one of the existing letters.  Option A directly reflects this action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mee ihe ịrịba ama udo iji tinye ya** - While he *used* symbols of peace and love, the text doesn't say he *inserted* them. The symbols were part of the tarpaulins.
*   **C: N'usoro imerụ ya ahụ** - This is too general. The text describes a specific action of changing the letters.
*   **D: Iji gbanwee ya, jiri tapaulins** - This is partially true (tarpaulins were used), but it doesn't describe the *process* of changing the letters. It only mentions the *tool* used.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka onye nkuzi Bekee Karno na-eboghị ya ebubo, dabere na akụkụ akwụkwọ a?","The correct answer is **B: Inwe mmekọrịta na nwa akwụkwọ**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states Karno was accused of exploiting relationships with students.** The quote ""na-asu asusu nkiti nime klassi, kuzie ukpuru iyi-oyi nime akwukwo, ma diri ka nno ka enyi umu akwukwo"" directly supports this accusation of inappropriate relationships with students.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Imebi iwu nwebiisinka:** While he *was* accused of this, the text says ""Ebobukwara ya ebubo ịda iwu nwebisiinka, mana amaghị ya ikpe."" (He was accused of violating the law, but he has not been convicted.) This means the accusation hasn't been proven.
* **C: Mmepụta nke mgbasa ozi na-enweghị ikike:** He *was* accused of this, ""ibipụta ụmụ mgbasa ozi ahịa buru ibu n’ụmụ bọọsụ na-enweghị ikikere ma-atụ asị n’ikwu na ọ bụ onye isi ndị nkuzi Bekee."" (spreading false rumors among students claiming to be a leader of British teachers).
* **D: Okwu rụrụ arụ na klas:** While this is an accusation made against him, it's a *behavioral* accusation, not a legal one like the others.  The question asks what he was accused of *being charged with*.

Therefore, the most direct accusation mentioned and supported by the provided text is exploiting relationships with students.
"
"Kedu onye Rolando Mendoza na-ejideghị, dabere na ebe a?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị ọbịa (Tourists)**.

The text states that Rolando Mendoza held onto tourists visiting Hong Kong. Options B, C, and D are all people *involved* in the situation, but the text explicitly says he was holding *tourists*.
"
Kedu ndị ejidere na-akwadoghị n'ihu ọha na a tọhapụrụ ya na mbụ n'akụkụ a?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị ọbịa (Tourists)**.

The passage states that the Filipino police restrained tourists visiting Hong Kong and took them to Manila. They were initially released but were later recaptured. Therefore, the tourists were the ones detained and then initially released.
"
"Ònye na-anakọta mbinye aka iji mee ka alụmdi na nwunye nwoke ma ọ bụ nwanyị nwee iwu kwadoro na Brazil, dị ka e kwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị na-emegide (The opposition)**.

The passage states: ""Ndi ngaghari iwe nwere olile-anye inweta mkpesa ntibanye aka n’akwukwo nde 1.2 iji gosi nzuko ome-iwu ala-anyi n’onwa Novemba."" This translates to: ""The opposition has hope of collecting 1.2 million signatures to show the strength of public opinion in November.""  Therefore, the opposition is the group collecting signatures to overturn the law.
"
Kedu onye ga-anata akwụkwọ mkpesa nke ndị ngagharị iwe ga-eweta?,"The correct answer is **B: Roberto Jefferson**.

The text states: ""Iwu ahụ achọrọ ime, mgbe e mezichara ya, nọzi ugbu a n’aka Roberto Jefferson."" This translates to ""The law was to be implemented, after it was passed, now rests with Roberto Jefferson."" Therefore, Roberto Jefferson is the one who currently holds the law.

"Gịnị mere obere oge tupu ndị na-ege ntị amalite imeghachi omume na ihu igwe, dabere na akaụntụ Armand Versace?","The correct answer is **A: Edu mmiri malitere ịda**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""mmiri ebido zowe, mana o ji iwe bịa, ụdịrị iwe na-eme ka ọ na-adụ gị adụ ka ntu..."" This indicates that the water's aggressive and angry behavior is what caused people to panic and react.  The other options are less directly linked to the immediate reaction:

* **B: Ọ bụ nkeji ise n'azụ ihe ngosi:** This is just the starting point of the events, not the cause of the reaction.
* **C: Ifufe siri ike:** The passage doesn't mention wind.
* **D: Ọ chefuru onye ezinaụlọ ya:** While tragic, the death of a loved one doesn't explain the immediate panic and aggression described.

Therefore, the water's sudden, angry surge is the most logical reason for the people's fear and desperate actions."
"Kedu mgbe ifufe kacha sie ike malitere, dịka Versace siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Obere oge ka ihe ngosi malitere**.

The passage states: ""Ka nkeji ise gachara e bidoro ihe ngosi a, ikuku ebido kuwe..."" (Five minutes had passed since the show started, the wind started to blow...). This indicates the wind started shortly after the show began. Options B, C, and D refer to events that happened *later* in the description."
Oke ifufe ole dị ịrịba ama ka ekwuru na ọwụwa anyanwụ nke 35°W tupu Fred?,"The correct answer is **D: Otu**.

Here's why:

The problem states that Fred is experiencing a *tropical cyclone* (which is another word for hurricane or typhoon, essentially a powerful storm) located approximately 645 miles (1040 km) southwest of Cape Verde.  The storm is traveling in a northwest direction. The problem also mentions that Fred is located in an area where the ""epicenter of the most intense heat"" of the Atlantic Ocean is, which suggests a tropical environment.

The key is the phrase ""ajo ifufe nke ato enwegoro n’odida nke 35°W"".  This directly states that there is **one** tropical cyclone located at 35°W longitude.

Therefore, the answer is D."
Olee ụzọ Fred si na-eme njem mgbe ọ dị nso n’agwaetiti Cape Verde?,"The question states Fred is traveling in a **northwest** direction. Therefore, the correct answer is **D: Northwest**.
"
Kedu nke na-aga ngwa ngwa karịa ndị bu ya ụzọ?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Na 802.11n, ọsịsọ ya ji nnukwu ihe kara nke ndị bu ya ụzọ; ya mere, ọrụ ọ na-arụpụta ga-eru 600Mbit/s."" This means 802.11n is faster than the older standards.
"
Ruo kedu ókè 802.11n kwesịrị ịdị na-aga azụ dakọtara na 802.11b?,"The correct answer is **C: ọsọ nke 600 Mbit / s**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""nke a ga-enye ya ohere ka dịrị na ndakọta nlaghachi azụ na 802.11a, 802.11b na 802.11g, ma ọ bụrụhaala na isi ebe ahụ ụgbọigwe na-anọ nwere redìò abụọ."" This confirms 802.11n can backward-compatible.
* **The passage also states:** ""Na 802.11n, ọsịsọ ya ji nnukwu ihe kara nke ndị bu ya ụzọ; ya mere, ọrụ ọ na-arụpụta ga-eru 600Mbit/s."" This directly links the speed to the capabilities of 802.11n.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nnukwu ọsọ na-abawanye:** While true that 802.11n offers a significant speed increase, it doesn't pinpoint *how* fast it is in relation to 802.11b.
* **B: 802.11b nwere ike ịrụ ọrụ na 5.0 GHz:** 802.11b operates on the 2.4 GHz frequency, not 5.0 GHz.
* **D: redio abụọ:** Having two radios is a feature that *enables* backward compatibility (allowing 802.11n to connect to older devices), but it doesn't define the speed of 802.11n itself.



"
Egwuregwu igwu mmiri ole n'egwuregwu Commonwealth ka onye nrite ọla edo n'Olimpik akwadoro ịsọ mpi?,"The correct answer is **B: Atọ**.

The question states the athlete won a bronze medal in swimming in the 100m and 200m individual freestyle events at the Commonwealth Games, and also won three gold medals in the Olympics."
Kedu ihe mere na onye mgbanye ọlaedo Olympic anọghị na-aṅụ ọgwụ maka ahụ mgbu ya?,"The correct answer is **D: N'egwuregwu Commonwealth, amachibidoro ya.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọ nwebeghị ike ịn̄ụ ọgwụ ndị ahụ o kwesịrị iji merie mgbu ya dị ka a machibidoro ha iwu site n’Egwuregwu.""  This means the reason the athlete couldn't take the medication was due to a rule prohibiting it during the Commonwealth Games.
"
"Gịnị nwere ike ịkpata mgbagwoju anya banyere ọrụ ala ọma jijiji, ma ọ bụrụ na akụkụ ahụ ziri ezi?","The correct answer is **A: Mkpuchi igwe ojii nke gbara ọchịchịrị (Volcanic gas plume)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the earthquake's cause is unexplained.** This suggests something unusual is happening.
* **Volcanic gas plumes are a common precursor to volcanic eruptions and earthquakes.** The buildup of gases beneath the surface can cause stress and movement in the crust, leading to seismic activity. 
* **The passage mentions an ""unexplained"" seismic event near the Hekla caldera.** A volcanic gas plume could be the trigger for this.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: Nlebanya sitere n'ụlọ ọrụ meteorological Icelandic (Observations from the Icelandic Meteorological Office):** While valuable, the Icelandic Meteorological Office *already* reported no recent earthquakes in the area. Their observations don't explain *this* earthquake.
* **C: Nkọwa nke ala ọma jijiji gburugburu ụwa (Descriptions of earthquakes around the world):** This is too general. While comparing to other earthquakes can be helpful, it doesn't explain *this specific* earthquake in Iceland.
* **D: A kọwo na mpaghara ndị ọzọ nke Iceland na-arụsi ọrụ ike (Reports that other areas of Iceland are active):**  Activity in other areas doesn't necessarily explain an earthquake in a specific, isolated location like near Hekla.

Therefore, a volcanic gas plume is the most plausible explanation for the unexplained earthquake, given the information in the passage.



"
Kedu mgbe ekwuru na mgbanwe akụkụ mere na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na Maachị 10**.

The text states: ""Ala ọma jijiji ahụ dị ịrịba ama butere mgbanwe mere n'ụbọchị nke iri n'ọnwa Maachị..."" which translates to ""The earthquake caused a noticeable change on the tenth of March...""
"
Kedu n'ime aro ndị a gbasara Chandrayaan-1's lunar lander bụ ụgha?,"The correct answer is **C: Ewepụrụ nyocha ahụ nke ọma (The experiment was not properly executed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Moon Impact Probe (MIP) was *intentionally* crashed into the moon to obtain data. It was a planned, albeit destructive, part of the mission.  Therefore, the experiment was *not* improperly executed; it was executed as designed.

Let's look at why the other options are likely true based on the passage:

*   **A: Enwere ndị ọrụ na orbiter nke malitere nyocha ahụ (There were crew members on the orbiter who began the investigation):** While the passage doesn't explicitly say there were *crew members* (Chandrayaan-1 was an uncrewed mission), it *does* say the orbiter was involved in the investigation.  This is a reasonable inference.
*   **B: Ejiri ngwaọrụ ndị dị mkpa rụọ nyocha ahụ (Necessary instruments were used to carry out the investigation):** The passage mentions the orbiter was used, and a lunar surface imaging instrument was also crucial. So, it's likely that appropriate instruments were used.
*   **D: A na-achọ akụkụ nke nyocha ahụ mma (They are looking for the good parts of the investigation):** The passage highlights the success of the lunar surface imaging and the importance of the scientific instruments. This suggests a review and analysis to find the positive outcomes.



Therefore, the only option that directly contradicts information in the passage is C.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kacha kọwaa nyocha ọnwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ dabara nke ọma ọdịda mkpọka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""karịa ngwa sayensị atọ dị mkpa o bu, ụgbọ nchọpụta ihu ọnwa bukwa onyonyo ọkọlọtọ nke obodo india, nke etere ka agba n'akụkụ ya nile."" This indicates the probe took a high-resolution image of the lunar surface.
* **Option B (""Ọ dabara nke ọma ọdịda mkpọka"")** is the closest to this description. While the passage doesn't explicitly say it was a *close-up* image, the phrase ""onyonyo ọkọlọtọ"" (photograph) implies a detailed view.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O mere ọdịda dị nso n'osisi ugwu nke ọnwa:** The passage doesn't mention any mountains.
* **C: E si n'ụgbọ mmiri na-agba agba agbapụta ya:** The passage describes a probe, not a ship.
* **D: O nwere ngwaọrụ abụọ dị mkpa na ya:** While the probe had scientific instruments, the passage highlights the image as a major achievement, not the number of instruments.

"Kedu usoro mgbochi ọrịa nke a ga-etinye n'ọnọdụ ikpeazụ, metụtara akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: ọgwụgwọ maka encephalitis**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the government is distributing encephalitis medication and plans to continue providing it for the coming year. This directly relates to treating and preventing encephalitis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ogwu ogwu (Traditional medicine):** While traditional medicine might be used in conjunction with other treatments, the passage focuses on pharmaceutical interventions.
*   **B: ọnyà maka ezi (Fight for truth):** This is unrelated to medical intervention for the disease.
*   **D: ụgbụ anwụnta (Pest control):** Pest control is a preventative measure, but the passage focuses on direct treatment with medication. While pest control *is* mentioned, the emphasis is on the *medication* being provided.



"
Kedu ka ọrịa si esi na anụmanụ agbasa ndị mmadụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Anwụnta**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ezi na ebu ọrịa ahụ, nke anwụnta na ebunyezi ndị mmadụ."" This translates to ""The disease is novel and has spread to people.""  ""Anwụnta"" means ""novel"" or ""newly emerged.""
"
Kedu ihe nwere ike ime ma ọ bụrụ na ahịrịokwu nke abụọ dara?,"The correct answer is **B: A ga-emecha kwe ka mmekọ nwoke na nwoke na nwanyị.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the second version of the bill aimed to allow both male-male and female-female civil unions. If the second version passed, it would directly lead to the legalization of these types of unions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: A ga-enyocharịrị HJR-3 ozugbo:** While the bill might be reviewed, the primary goal of the second version was to achieve legal recognition of these unions, not just a review process.
*   **C: Nzukọ pụrụ iche nke ndị omebe iwu:**  The passage doesn't indicate the second version would lead to a special assembly of lawmakers.
*   **D: anabataghị mmekọ nwoke na nwoke na nwanyị:** The passage explicitly states the bill aimed *to* allow these unions.




"
"Kedu mgbe e wepụrụ ahịrịokwu nke abụọ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: N'afọ 2011**.

The text states: ""Ndozigharị iwu achọrọ agafeela ụlọ abụọ ahụ na 2011. E mere otu mgbanwe n’oge imeiwu a mgbe ehichapụrụ ahịrị abụọ ahụ mbụ site n’aka Ụlọ ndị Nnọchiteanya..."" This directly indicates the amendment (removal of the second clause) happened in 2011.
"
"""Kedu onye a gwara maka mwepu """"Panama Papers""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Ụlọ ọrụ ahụ bụ Mossack Fonseca**.

The passage states: ""Panama Papers bụ aha gburugburu maka ihe ruru nde akwụkwọ iri nke ụlọ ọrụ iwu nke Panama bụ Mossack Fonseca...""  This directly identifies Mossack Fonseca as the entity at the center of the Panama Papers scandal.
"
"Kedu onye e boro ebubo na ọ na-agba ọtụtụ ụlọ ọrụ na-ezochi ego, dị ka ndị nta akụkọ Britain si kọọ?","The correct answer is **C: German Bank**. 

The text states: ""In the Guardian, the British newspaper suggested that Deutsche Bank was involved in the movement of as many as one third of the 1200 companies that had no apparent business activity, which were used to evade tax.""
"
Kedu n'ime ọnwụ mberede ụgbọ elu ndị a metụtara ọtụtụ mmadụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Mgbe ụgbọ elu ahụ siri Armenia gawa Iran, ụgbọ elu ahụ dara.**

Here's why:

* The question asks about incidents involving *many* deaths.
* The passage states that an airplane flying *to Armenia from Iran* crashed, killing 168 people.
* The other options refer to incidents with fewer fatalities (3 people killed by police helicopter, and 17 killed in a crash in Mashhad).

Therefore, the crash of the plane en route to Armenia is the only incident mentioned that resulted in a large number of deaths."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe kpatara ọtụtụ ihe mberede ụgbọ elu Iran nwere?,"The correct answer is **B: ụkọ ego maka ịzụrụ ụgbọ elu ọhụrụ (Funds for purchasing new aircraft)**.

Here's why:

The text details a series of recent and serious Iranian plane crashes, highlighting issues with the age and maintenance of the fleet. It mentions that the aircraft are old and not well-maintained.

*   **A: ụgbọ elu ndị agha na ụgbọ elu obodo emechiela (The aircraft are old and not well-maintained):** This directly aligns with the text's claims about the age and poor condition of the Iranian aircraft fleet.
*   **C: Mmachi na inweta ụgbọ elu ọhụrụ (Delays in obtaining new aircraft):** The text implies a problem with the fleet due to the lack of new aircraft, as it crashes are happening frequently.
*   **D: ụgbọ elu nke nọ n'ọnọdụ ọjọọ (Aircraft in poor condition):** This is a direct restatement of the text's description of the aircraft's state.
*   **B: ụkọ ego maka ịzụrụ ụgbọ elu ọhụrụ (Funds for purchasing new aircraft):** The text *doesn't* mention any problems with funding new aircraft. The problems seem to be related to the current fleet's age and condition, not the ability to acquire new ones.

Therefore, the statement about funds for purchasing new aircraft is the least likely cause of the plane crashes based on the provided text.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị akụkụ nke akụkọ Iraq Study Group?,"The correct answer is **D: Oku maka nkwenye US (Support for US credibility)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states the Iraq Study Group's report focused on stopping the ""chain reaction of violence"" and preventing further escalation. It also mentioned a new political process and restoring governance and relations with the Iraqi people.
* Options A, B, and C are all directly mentioned or strongly implied in the passage as part of the Iraq Study Group's recommendations or concerns. 
* Option D, however, is not mentioned. While the US's credibility might be a *result* of a stable Iraq, it wasn't a core focus of the study group's stated recommendations. The report was primarily concerned with the immediate security situation and political process in Iraq.



"
Kedu n'ime ndụmọdụ ndị a ka Otu Ọmụmụ Iraq na-emeghị na akụkọ ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Mmalite nke mgbalị diplomatic ọhụrụ**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the report *did* mention the use of dialogue and supports fundamental changes. However, it doesn't mention any *new* diplomatic efforts. The report focuses on halting violence, fundamental changes, and a new government process – not initiating new diplomatic initiatives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ka e kwere nkwa ịkwụsị ime ihe ike na-abawanye ụba:** The report *does* state that any processes in Iraq will be halted regarding violence, escalation, or incursions. This implies a commitment to stopping violence.
*   **B: Mgbanwe ozugbo na N'ezie:** The report advocates for fundamental changes. The phrase ""ozugbo ozigbo"" (repeatedly/often) describes the need for these changes, implying they should happen frequently.
*   **C: Iji oghe mkparịta ụka:** The report *does* mention the use of dialogue.



"
Kedu onye ndị uwe ojii chere na ọ bụ aka nri Provenzano?,"The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""Ndị uwe ojii kwuru na Lo Pikolo bụ onye ka dị ike maka na ọ rụọrọla Provenzano ọrụ na Palemo dị ka onye nnọchiteanya, nakwa ahụmahụ ya karịrịnụ mere ka ndị ọga kara aka sọpụrụ ya..."" This directly indicates that the police believed Lo Piccolo was a powerful figure working for Provenzano.
"
"Kedu ihe kpatara ọnwụ Falcone, na-ekpe ikpe site na ozi dị na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ lara n'iyi na esemokwu Riina kpatara** (It is said that the conflict Riina caused led to it).

The text states: ""Povenzano kwụsịrị ndị isi a mgbe ọ kwụsịrị agha Riina nke megidere steeti..."". This directly links the conflict with Riina to the deaths of Falcone and Borsellino. While the text doesn't explicitly say Riina ordered the killings, it strongly implies it was a consequence of the conflict.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndị uweojii gbagburu ya** (The police killed him): The text doesn't state the police killed him.
* **C: Lo Piccolo nwetara iwu ka e gbuo ya** (Lo Piccolo received a command to kill him): The text doesn't state Lo Piccolo issued the order.
* **D: Paolo Borsellino, onye na-alụ ọgụ Mafia, gburu ya** (Paolo Borsellino, who fought the Mafia, killed him): This is illogical. Borsellino was a victim, not the killer.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a Hitoshi Saito enweghị?,"The correct answer is **A: ọkaibe mba uwa ugboro abụọ**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states Hitoshi Saito was an Olympic gold medalist *twice* and a world *championship* winner.
* The text also states he was the chairman of the Japan Judo Federation.
* It clearly states he was a judo athlete.

Therefore, he *did* win Olympic gold twice, was the chairman of the Japan Judo Federation, and was a judo athlete. The only thing he *didn't* do, according to the provided text, is win the world championship twice. He won the world championship, but the text doesn't specify *how many* times."
Iwasaki zere ikwe nkwa ebe?,"The answer is **B: Nepal**.

The text states: ""Iwasaki siri na-alụm di na nwunye gbalaga na Nepal a tụọ ya nga na India."" which translates to ""Iwasaki and his wife argued in Nepal and were deported to India."" Therefore, Nepal is the correct answer.
"
Kedu onye Iwasaki wakporo?,"The correct answer is **C: Nkịta**.

The text states: ""nkịta ara lụsoro ya ọgụ"" which translates to ""a stray dog attacked him.""
"
Kedu mgbe Alonso gbachara ọsọ ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Ozugbo na-esochi mmebi wheel n'ihu Schumacher.**

The text states: ""Michael Schumacher kwụsịrị ọsọ ya n’oge na-etoghị anya mgbe Alonso mesịrị, n’ihi mmebi sọspenshọn n’ime ọtụtụ agha n’ime oge ọsọ ahụ.""  This implies Alonso crashed *before* Schumacher's engine failure. The text also mentions Fisichella also had a problem and had to retire. Therefore, Alonso crashed while Schumacher was still racing.
"
Ọ bụ n'ihi gịnị ka nchucha agbụrụ mbụ Schumacher mere?,"The correct answer is **D: Nsogbu nkwusioru na ụgbọ ala (Suspension problems)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Michael Schumacher kwụsịrị ọsọ ya n’oge na-etoghị anya mgbe Alonso mesịrị, n’ihi mmebi sọspenshọn n’ime ọtụtụ agha n’ime oge ọsọ ahụ."" (Michael Schumacher stopped his race unexpectedly when Alonso started, due to suspension problems during the race.)

The other options are incorrect based on the provided text:

*   **A: O ji ụgbọala ya mee ihe n'ụzọ na-ezighị ezi (He used his car incorrectly):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
*   **B: Mụ na Alonso gbakọrọ (They collided):** While there was an incident with Alonso, the text specifically points to suspension problems as the reason for Schumacher's stop.
*   **C: Mmebi Fisichella na wiilị (Fisichella's problem with the wheel):** This refers to Fisichella's issue and is not the cause of Schumacher's stop.



"
"Ọrụ onye ka ọ bụ, dabere na ngalaba ahụ, ikpebi mgbapụta onye ejidere?","The correct answer is **D: Kọmishọna ọkaikpe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Kọmishọna na ewepụta ụgwọ mgbapụta..."" This directly indicates that the Commissioner of Justice is responsible for determining the release.
* The passage mentions Glynn issued the law and a judge might preside over the trial, but the *decision* on release is given to the Commissioner.
* Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the passage doesn't say the ""onye ọrụ na-eme njide"" (detaining officer), Glynn, or the ""isi ọrụ ndoputa"" (chief prosecution officer) are responsible for the release decision.



"
"Kedu ihe a ga-ahapụrịrị ka ndị ejidere nwee ka ejidere ihe karịrị awa 24, dịka iwu mgbochi nwa oge siri dị n'akwụkwọ a?","The correct answer is **A: Ụgwọ ntọhapụ (Release fee)**.

The text states: ""oka-iwu Glynn nyere iwu mmachi nke ga adi nwa oge-nta megide ogige ahu iji kwudosie-ike nye ntohapu nke ndi eji-eji karia awa 24 ejidere ha bu ndi n’enwetaghi onunu ziri-ezi site n’aka onye-isi ulo-ikpe.""  This translates to: ""Glynn's amnesty law will be applied to those detained for more than 24 hours without due process from the head of the court to guarantee the release of those detained who have not received a fair trial.""  The law guarantees their release *after* paying a release fee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ndụmọdụ ya na onye ọrụ njide (His recommendation to the jailer):** While the jailer might have a recommendation, the law focuses on a *fee* to secure release.
* **C: Ọkaikpe Glynn gbara akwụkwọ ebubo (Glynn's indictment):**  The indictment is *part* of the process, but the text specifies a fee *after* a fair trial hasn't been secured.
* **D: Anụ ahụ (The animal):** This is completely irrelevant to the text.



"
Kedu ihe ziri ezi ewepụrụ na akụkụ ahụ iji kọwaa kagbuo ọsọ ọsọ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ejighi n'aka na iwu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the decision to eliminate the second round of elections was made to reduce the cost and security risks. It then highlights that observers claimed the decision disregarded Afghan laws in the electoral process. The core issue being raised is that the decision to cancel the election *violated the law*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ihe ize ndụ na nchekwa** While these were stated *reasons* for the decision, they don't describe what was *removed* or disregarded.
*   **B: Esemokwu na Iwu** The passage *states* that laws were disregarded, not that a lack of explanation/law was the issue.
*   **C: nnukwu ọnụ ahịa** While mentioned as a reason, the primary focus of the passage is on the legal violation.



"
Gịnị kpatara na ndị nnọchi anya mba ụwa mechara kweta na ịgba ọsọ ahụ adịghị mkpa?,"The best answer is **C: Usoro iwu edoghị anya n'ebe (The legal process was flawed).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""ịkagbu mgbapụ ahụ gara ịda iwu"" (the killing of the hostages went to the legal process) and that the diplomatic representatives said ""ha ahụghị ezigbi ihe mgbagwujuanya n’usoro iwu ndị Afghan iji kpebie n’usoro ntụziaka ahụ ezighị ezi"" (they did not see the Afghan legal process as appropriate to resolve the situation). This indicates a fundamental problem with the legal basis for the actions taken.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: O mebiri iwu (A law was passed):** While laws might be relevant, the passage focuses on the *flaw in the existing legal process* rather than the creation of a new law.
* **B: Ihe iyi egwu nchekwa dị (Security concerns existed):**  Security concerns were *a reason given by those who wanted the hostages released*, but the passage highlights that those concerns didn't justify the actions taken within the legal framework.
* **D: Ntuli aka ahụ furu nnukwu ego (The hostage situation cost a lot of money):** While the passage mentions the financial cost of the election, it is not the primary reason for questioning the legality of the actions.



Therefore, **C** directly addresses the core issue presented in the text regarding the legal legitimacy of the hostage rescue.



"
Onye na-enye ọrụ iwu FATA?,"The correct answer is **B: Ndị nnọchi anya ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị**.

The passage states that the Pakistani government appointed ""Tribal Agents"" (Ndị ọrụ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị) to administer FATA, giving them the power to administer government services and judicial matters under the 1923 Pakistan Constitution.  This directly points to the Tribal Agents as those who provided legal services.
"
"""Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara """"Ndị nnọchi anya ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị"""" nke FATA bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?""","The correct answer is **D: Ụfọdụ ebe nọ kpamkpam n'okpuru ha**

Here's why:

The passage states the ""Ndị ọrụ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị"" were appointed by the President of Pakistan to administer FATA and allow for a gradual transition to full Pakistani rule. This implies they didn't have *complete* control. They were acting as a bridge. Option D suggests they held complete control, which contradicts the passage.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the passage:

*   **A: Ha na-enye enyemaka iwu:** The passage states they were responsible for ""ịnye ụmụ ọrụ gọọmentị na ìkpé ikpe n'okpuru Nkeji edemede narị abụọ na iri anọ na asát nke Iwu Pakistan"" which translates to providing governmental services and administering justice under the 147 articles of Pakistani law. This means they provided legal assistance.
*   **B: Onye isi ala Pakịstan họpụtara ha:** The passage explicitly states ""onye isi obodo Pakịstan ahọpụtara 'Ndị ọrụ ndọrọ ndọrọ ọchịchị'"" - the President of Pakistan appointed them.
*   **C: Ha na-agbaso iwu Pakịstan:** The passage states they administered justice ""n'okpuru Nkeji edemede narị abụọ na iri anọ na asát nke Iwu Pakistan"" - under the 147 articles of Pakistani law. This means they were operating within Pakistani legal framework.



"
Kedu ihe nrite ka akpọrọ Emma Stone?,"The correct answer is **C: Onye na-eme ihe nkiri kachasị mma**.

The question asks what award Emma Stone received. The text states she was nominated for ""Best Actress."" Therefore, the answer is ""Onye na-eme ihe nkiri kachasị mma"" which translates to ""Best Actress.""
"
Kedu ihe nsọpụrụ fim ahụ enwetaghị nhọpụta maka?,"The correct answer is **A: Foto kacha pụta ìhè (Best Cinematography)**.

The text states that the film received 26 nominations but *didn't* get nominations for Best Cinematography. The other options (Best Visual Effects, Best Sound Mixing, and Best Original Song) are not mentioned as missing nominations.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka na-agba ọsọ mgbe ala ọma jijiji ahụ gasịrị?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọdụ ụgbọ elu Ishikawa**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""A kọrọ na ụfọdụ ụzọ, kwụsịtụ njem ụgbọ oloko n'ebe ndị o metụtara, ma ọdụ ụgbọelu Ishikawa ka mechiri emechi.""  This directly links the earthquake to the closure of Ishikawa Airport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Igwe ọkụ niile nọ n'ụlọọrụ Shika dị na Hokuriku:** The passage specifically mentions that the *primary and secondary reactors* at the Shika nuclear power plant *did not* experience damage. While the plant was shut down as a precaution, it wasn't *all* power plants in Hokuriku that were affected.
* **C: Ọrụ ụgbọoloko niile:** The passage mentions a suspension of *some* shipping operations, not *all*.
* **D: Ụlọ ọrụ ike na Niigata:** The earthquake affected the nuclear power plant in Shika (Ishikawa Prefecture), not power plants in Niigata Prefecture.

Therefore, the only option directly supported by the text is the closure of Ishikawa Airport.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ala ọma jijiji ahụ mebiri, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ụfọdụ ụlọ**.

The text explicitly states: ""Na ala ọma jijiji ahụ, ụfọdụ ebeobibi dị 9400 na mpaghara ahụ nọ na-enweghị mmiri ma ihe dị ka 100 na-enweghị ọkụ eletriki."" This directly indicates that some houses were affected.

While options C (ụzọ ụfọdụ) and D (Ọdụ ụgbọ elu dị na Noto) are mentioned as consequences, the text specifically lists *houses* as being affected with lack of water and electricity. Option B (Igwe ọkụ abụọ nọ n'ụlọọrụ Shika) is mentioned as the *source* of the earthquake, not a direct consequence *caused* by the earthquake itself, although it's related. Therefore, the most accurate answer reflecting the text is A.
"
"Kedu n'ime isiokwu ndị a na-ekwughị n'akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: mgbọrọgwụ nke esemokwu nke 1967**.

The text explicitly mentions the future of Jerusalem and the Jordan River Valley in other sections of the document. It also states that there were Israeli soldiers stationed in the Jordan Valley.  However, it *doesn't* mention the ""negotiations of 1967"" as a separate topic. Therefore, it's the statement that is *not* covered in the document as per the question.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe Palestine chọrọ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndagwurugwu Jọdan nwere ọnụnọ ndị agha afọ ise**.

Here's why:

* The text states that the PA (Palestinian Authority) wanted the soldiers to remain in the Jordan River Valley for only five years.
* Option D says the PA wanted them to remain for *five years*, which aligns with the information in the document.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dabere na ọnọdụ tupu agha maka oke ala** - The document explicitly states the document *is* based on the situation before the 1967 war regarding territorial claims.
* **B: ndị agha ka dị na ndagwurugwu Jọdan** - Both the Israelis and Palestinians agreed on this point. The document says Israel wanted them to remain for ten years, and the PA wanted them to remain for five years *in the Jordan River Valley*.
* **C: Azịza nke ọdịnihu Jerusalem** - The document mentions the future of Jerusalem as a separate topic discussed in other articles, but it doesn't say the Palestinians specifically *chose* this outcome. They were involved in discussions about Jerusalem, but not necessarily that they had a particular desired resolution.



"
Kedu obodo Ma gara ụlọ akwụkwọ iwu?,"The correct answer is **A: obodo America**.

The text states: ""Ma gụrụ akwụkwọ na Mahadum nke Niu Yọk, makwa Mahadum Ikpe nke Havad n'otu oge o nwekwara """"akwukwo obibi"""" na-adigide adigide nke obodo Amerịka."" This translates to: ""Ma studied at New York University and Harvard University at the same time, and also had a vibrant ""living writing"" in the city of America.""
"
"Dị ka paragraf ahụ si kwuo, ọ̀tụ̀tụ̀ akabatara mmeri nhoputa ndi ochichi Ma kedu mba?","The correct answer is **A: obodo Amerịka**.

The paragraph states that Ma ""had a flourishing ""living writing"" scene that was constantly developing in the city of America."" This directly links his writing success to the city of America.
"
"Ònye bụ onye were Carolyn Wilson n'ọrụ tupu ọ pụọ n'obodo, dị ka akọwara n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Nke a OHA**.

The passage states: ""Karolin Wịlsịn onye ụlọ ọrụ OHA eburula ego ha kwụnyegoro si n'obodo larie."" This directly indicates that Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA.
"
Onye nọ n'ọkwa nke anọ n'asọmpi ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ ala nwere asọmpi anọ fọdụrụ n'afọ?,"The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

Here's why:

The problem states: ""As the third, Hamlin was twenty-two points ahead of Bowyer, but five points behind Kyle."" This means Hamlin is in third place and Bowyer is in fourth.

The question asks who is in fourth place. Therefore, Hamlin is in fourth place.
"
Isi isi ole Kahne nwere na asọmpi ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ ala ka agbachara agbachara ahụ aka n'akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **D: 2207**.

The text explicitly states: ""Kahne na Truex, Jr. bụ ndị nke ise na isii n'otu n'otu ma nwee pọyịnt 2,220 na 2,207.""  Therefore, Kahne had 2,207 points.
"
"Ugboro ole ka ndị mmadụ hụla ka meteorite dara bụ nke mechara pụta na Mars, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ na-ekwu?","The correct answer is **C: ugboro iri na ise**.

The passage states: ""N'ime ihe dị ka okwute si eluigwe 24,000 ama ama dara na ụwa, naanị ihe dị ka 34 ka egosiri na ha bụ ndị nwere mbido Martian."" This means approximately 34 meteorites have been identified as originating from Mars. The question asks about how many people have *seen* meteorites that were *later* determined to be Martian. The passage continues with: ""N’ime okwute ndi a, asiri na iri na ise si na meterorite si na igwe daa n’onwa Julai gara aga."" This translates to ""Among these meteorites, fifty-five were meteorites that fell to Earth last July."" So, 55 meteorites, which were subsequently found to be Martian, fell to Earth.

Therefore, option C, ""ugboro iri na ise"" (fifty-five), is the correct answer.  The other options are incorrect based on the information given.
"
"Kedu ihe bụ eziokwu gbasara okwute ndị a chọpụtara na ha sitere na martian, dị ka akọwara n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Mmadụ 34 n'ime ha nọ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""In the 24,000 meteorites that fell to Earth, only about 34 have shown to have a Martian origin.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Achọpụtara ha niile n'oge ịsa ahụ meteor nke July.** While some were found in July, the passage doesn't say *all* of them were discovered then.
* **B: 24,000 n'ime ha bụ mkpokọta.** The passage says 24,000 meteorites fell, not that they are a total collection.
* **C: Ha dị $11,000 ọnụ karịa ọla edo.** The passage states the price of *some* of the meteorites, not that they are universally more expensive than gold.



"
Schumacher lara ezumike nká mgbe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe ihe mberede Felipe Massa mere**.

Here's why:

* The question asks *when* Schumacher had a stroke of luck.
* The passage states he benefited from Felipe Massa's accident, which caused Massa to be injured. This *enabled* Schumacher to have a better chance of winning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mgbe mmeri asọmpi nke asatọ ya gasịrị.** This refers to a specific number of wins, not a stroke of luck.
* **C: Mgbe Felipe Massa nọchiri anya ya.** This is grammatically awkward and doesn't accurately reflect the situation.
* **D: na-esote oge 2009.** This is too vague. The accident happened in 2009, but the *luck* or benefit happened *because* of the accident.



"
Mgbe Massa merụrụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: oge nke Grand Prix**.

The text states: ""Onye Brazil a merụrụ ahụ n'isi mgbe moto ya kpọkasịrịrị n'ọsọ moto Grand Prix 2009 na Họngarị."" (This Brazilian was injured when his car crashed during the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.)

"Mmetụta dị aṅaa ka nhazi ahụ ga-enwe na AOL, dịka akụkụ nke akwụkwọ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị ọrụ nke AOL ga-arị elu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that due to the controversy within the US, AOL can't easily reach the IM market. However, the collaboration between Yahoo! and Microsoft will result in a combined user base that is *greater* than AOL's current user base. Therefore, AOL's user numbers are expected to increase, even if they aren't directly participating in the IM market.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Naanị AOL ga-emepụta ahịa IM:** The passage indicates AOL *cannot* easily enter the IM market due to the controversy.
*   **C: Microsoft na Yahoo ga-enwe ndị ọrụ na-emegide AOL n'ihe gbasara ọnụọgụ:** The passage doesn't say Microsoft and Yahoo will actively oppose AOL's user base; it's simply that their combined users will surpass AOL's.
*   **D: Na United States, AOL agaghịzi eji:** The passage only mentions difficulty reaching the IM market in the US, not a complete ban on AOL usage.

"
"Dị ka ndokwa ọhụrụ ahụ si dị, olee nke pụrụ ịkwụsị?","The correct answer is **C: Nnwere onwe maka AOL itolite ahịa n'ọsọ nke ya.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the failure of IM (Instant Messaging) in the US market is due to a scandal. This scandal has negatively impacted AOL's market share. The sentence ""N’inwe mkwado a n’ọnọdụ, nnwereonwe a nwere ike ịgwụ"" translates to ""With this advantage in the situation, this individual can grow.""  This clearly points to the advantage being AOL's ability to regain market share *despite* the IM failure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ojiji ịntanetị etoola nke ukwuu na United States:** While internet usage is high, it's not the *reason* for IM's failure or AOL's potential growth.
*   **B: Iji IM ahịa:** The passage is talking about the failure of IM *as a product*, not about using it for marketing.
*   **D: Mmekọrịta dị n'etiti Yahoo na Microsoft:** The collaboration between Yahoo and Microsoft is mentioned as a factor that *could have* impacted AOL's market share, but the passage focuses on AOL's potential to recover despite that impact.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate interpretation of the passage."
Ole ndị e merụrụ na mwakpo a na-abụghị ndị uwe ojii?,"The correct answer is **A: 19**.

Here's why:

* The question states that 12 of the injured were police officers.
* The question also states that over 32 people were injured.
* Therefore, the number of injured who were *not* police officers is 32 - 12 = 20.

However, the provided options don't include 20.  Let's re-examine the wording. The question asks ""Ole ndị e merụrụ na mwakpo a na-abụghị ndị uwe ojii?"". This implies finding the number of *non-police* injuries.

Since the prompt states 12 police officers were injured, and over 32 people were injured in total, then the number of people who were *not* police officers must be 32 - 12 = 20.

The options provided are not correct. Let's recalculate.

The question asks about the number of injured who were *not* police officers. We know:

* Total injured: Over 32
* Injured police officers: 12

Therefore, the number of injured who were *not* police officers must be greater than 32 - 12 = 20.  None of the answers fit this.

There is an error in the question or the provided answer choices. If we assume the ""over 32"" is a typo and it was *exactly* 32, then 32 - 12 = 20. This is still not an option.

However, if we assume the ""over 32"" refers to ""at least 32"", and that the 12 police officers are the *only* ones injured, then the total number of injured is 32. In this case, the number who are not police officers would be 32 - 12 = 20, which is not an option.

Let's assume the number of injured is *exactly* 32, and that the 12 police officers are the only ones injured.

Then, the number of injured who are *not* police officers is 32 - 12 = 20.

Since 20 is not an option, there must be an error in the question or answers.

Let me check my calculations. 32 - 12 = 20. Okay.

There appears to be an error. None of the options are correct based on the information provided.

If ""over 32"" means ""exactly 32"", then the number of non-police injuries is 32 - 12 = 20. This is not an option. If the total number of injured is exactly 31, then 31-12 = 19 which is also not an option.

There is an issue with this question.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{20}$"
Onye mere ka amara onye a na-enyo enyo na mwakpo ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ndị uwe ojii**.

The passage states: ""Ndị uwe ojii sị na ha na-enyo otu onye a na-ebo ebubo na ọ bụ onye agha nnupuisi Daesh (ISIL) dịka onye mere mwakpo ahụ."" This directly indicates that the police are the ones identifying and presenting the suspected perpetrator.
"
Kedu ihe e nyere Mitt Romney ebe ọ bụ na Florida bụ steeti onye mmeri na-ewere ọnọdụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị nnọchi anya steeti ọ bụla**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Florida is a ""winner-take-all"" state. This means the candidate who wins the most votes in Florida receives *all* of the state's electoral votes.  The passage specifically says Florida gave Romney all 29 of its electoral votes.  While it mentions Romney got over 46% of the vote, that's about the percentage he received *in Florida*, not the number of electoral votes he received *because* Florida is a winner-take-all state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị nnọchi anya 32 sitere na steeti ahụ:** The passage says Romney received all 29 of Florida's electoral votes, not 32.
*   **B: Ntuli aka nke Republican Party:** The passage doesn't mention any ""handshake"" from the Republican Party.
*   **D: Site na 46% nke votu:** While Romney achieved this percentage in Florida, it's not the direct result of Florida being a winner-take-all state. The state's electoral vote allocation is the key factor.

"Ònye, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo, gbahapụrụ ịgba ọsọ na-eso rịzọlt caucus?","The correct answer is **B: Bachmann**.

The text states: ""Bachmann, who defeated Ames Straw in August, decided to quit her campaign."" This means she ended her participation in the race, thus withdrawing from the caucus.
"
"Kedu onye toro onye ọzọ na-azọ ọkwa ka ọ gachara nsonaazụ caucus, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Bachmann**.

The text states: ""Bachmann, who defeated Ames Straw in August, decided to quit her campaign."" This implies she dropped out *after* the caucus results, indicating she was one of the candidates who participated and ultimately ended her run. The text also says she finished fourth, fifth, or sixth. Therefore, Bachmann is the one who ended up dropping out after the caucus.
"
"Tupu afọ 2015, olee ebe naanị ebe a na-agbasa ihe ngosi ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""N’oge mbu ya, ihe ngosi a ka egosipụtara n’igwe saịtị intaneti na-agba ọsọ nke TogiNet Radio..."" This indicates that TogiNet Radio was the *only* place the show was broadcast before 2015.
"
Kedu ụdị ntugharị a na-egosi site na nkọwa ụlọ ọrụ nke mmemme ahụ?,"The best answer is **C: Old school**.

Here's why:

* The description uses phrases like ""redio ndị mgbe ochie"" (old-fashioned radio) and "" ndị si n'ọwụwa anyanwụ Tegzas"" (from the Texas countryside). These evoke a sense of nostalgia and tradition, pointing towards an ""old school"" vibe.
* The phrase ""dị egwu!"" (scary!) adds a touch of classic storytelling.
* The reference to being initially broadcast on a radio website suggests a simpler, older approach to media.

While ""Geeky"" might apply to the radio aspect, the overall tone and language leans more towards a nostalgic, old-fashioned feel. ""Old school"" is the most encompassing and accurate descriptor. ""Isiokwu mpaghara"" (local focus) is partially correct because of the Texas connection, but ""old school"" captures the essence of the program's presentation better.

Therefore, the answer is **A: Ozi**.

Kedu n'ime ndị a kacha kọwaa nsonaazụ Brisbane Open n'etiti Raonic na Nadal kwuru n'amaokwu a?,"The correct answer is **C: Nadal meriri Raonic**.

The passage states: ""Ọ dara n’oge na-adịghị anya megide Raonic na Mmepe Brisbane ahụ. Nadal nwere 88% n’egwuregwu ahụ iji merie na 76 n’ọrụ izizi."" This clearly indicates that Nadal won against Raonic in the Brisbane Open.

"Kedu ihe bụ ọnọdụ egwuregwu Nadal na Raonic mgbe ozi mbụ gasịrị, dịka akụkụ nke akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Nadal nwetara 76 akara**.

The passage states: ""Nadal nwere 88% n’egwuregwu ahụ iji merie na 76 n’ọrụ izizi."" This means Nadal won with 76 points. Option A is incorrect as it states Raonic won a percentage. Option C is incorrect as it describes the final score, not the situation when the initial statement was made. Option D is incorrect because Nadal won.
"
Kedu otu n'ime mmemme atọ ọhụrụ a gba ọtọ na-anaghị egosipụta mmemme asụsụ?,"The correct answer is **A: onye Italy**.

Here's why: The text states the company is starting to implement news reporting in Spanish, Italian, and Korean. The question asks which of the three new programs *doesn't* feature language news programs. The text specifically lists Italy along with Spain and Korea as countries they are starting to implement news reporting. The question implies that the other two (Spain and Korea) *do* have language news programs, but Italy does not.
"
Ederede a na-ekwu na mgbasa ozi akụkọ gba ọtọ agaghị adị ebe ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **B: site na ịntanetị (via the internet)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the accurate news reporting service is expanding to online platforms (weebụ).
* Options A, C, and D are not mentioned as expansion points in the text.

Therefore, the passage implies that the service will be available ""site na ịntanetị"" (via the internet) in addition to television and mobile devices.

Ndị egwuregwu ole na-emezughị Giant Slalom?,"The question asks how many skiers *did not* finish the Giant Slalom. The text states: ""Skiers anọ nwanyị nọ n'otu ụmụ nwanyị dara ịgbacha ọsọ ha, na 45 n'ime skiers 117 nọ na Giant Slalom dara isonye na ndị gbatara ihe n'egwuregwu ahụ.""

This means 45 out of 117 skiers *did* fall. Therefore, the number of skiers who *did not* finish (meaning they fell) is 45.

So the correct answer is D: 45.
"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a kacha kọwaa ka asọmpi asọmpi ahụ siri pụta?,"The best answer is **C: Nnukwu Slalom hụrụ ka ndị skiers gwụchara karịa Slalom.**

Here's why:

* **Option C** directly addresses the overall difficulty and outcome of the competitions. It states that more skiers fell in Giant Slalom than in Slalom. This gives a broader picture of how the competitions unfolded.

Let's look at why the other options are not as good:

* **Option A:** While Carpenado did win the second race in front of the Hungarian skier, this only describes a small part of the overall competition.
* **Option B:** The number of skiers who fell in Giant Slalom is mentioned, but it doesn't paint the full picture of how the races went.
* **Option D:** Carpenado finishing in the top twenty in Slalom is a detail, but less significant than the overall difficulty change between the two races.



Therefore, **C** provides the most comprehensive and descriptive answer to the question."
Ndị NBA kpebiri ịkwụsị nke n'ime ihe ndị a?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị na-eme egwuregwu ọ bụla nwere nyocha COVID-19**.

Here's why:

* The text states the NBA suspended play *because* a Utah Jazz player tested positive for COVID-19.  The decision was triggered by a COVID-19 test result. Therefore, the suspension happened because of *any* player testing positive, not just one team or a specific game.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Oge bọọlụ basketbọl:** This is too general. While the suspension affected the schedule, it wasn't the *reason* for the suspension.
* **B: Onye so na Utah Jazz:**  While the Utah Jazz player's positive test was the catalyst, the decision to suspend the entire season wasn't *just* about that individual player.  The concern was broader.
* **D: Otu egwuregwu basketball Utah Jazz:**  Again, this is too specific. The issue wasn't a single game; it was a player's positive test.

Here's why:

The text states the NBA suspended play *after* a player on the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19.  This implies the concern wasn't just about *one* positive test, but that there were multiple positive tests within the Jazz team.  Option B reflects this concern about multiple positive tests.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị egwuregwu NBA anwalela nke ọma:** The text doesn't mention whether NBA players were doing well.
*   **C: Mgbe anwalechara nke ọma, onye ọkpụkpọ maka Utah Jazz emeghị nke ọma:** While a test result was involved, the focus is not on the test itself but on the fact that a player *tested positive*. The wording of option C is also ambiguous.
*   **D: Onye ọkpụkpọ Utah Jazz nwere ule dị mma:** The text doesn't discuss the quality of the test. It only states the result.

"N'egwuregwu Capitals-Thrashers, onye nyere goolu 60th ya n'afọ?","The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The question specifically asks about the Capitals-Thrashers game. The text states that Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season in that game. While Mario Lemieux and Jaromir Jagr were the first to reach 60 goals in a season, it happened in different years. Nicklas Backstrom assisted on one of Ovechkin's goals.

*   **B: Mgbe nkewapụ ụlọ akụ na ụlọ ọrụ na-ahụ maka akụrụngwa:** This is also about the separation, a later event.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: The bank was bought by Virgin Group when it was nationalized:** The text says the bank was *nationalized* in 2007, *before* Virgin Group acquired the retail arm. Virgin didn't buy the entire bank when it was nationalized.
* **C: N'oge nsogbu ịgbazinye ego, Virgin Group nyere enyemaka mberede ụlọ akụ:** The text mentions Virgin Group *valued* the retail arm, but doesn't state they provided emergency funding during the financial crisis.
* **D: Mgbe emechara ụlọ akụ ahụ mba, Virgin Group nyere onyinye izizi ya maka ya:** The text states Virgin Group *valued* the retail arm, not that they donated money for it.

* The text explicitly states: ""N’okpuru mmemme ịchụ nta nke Sporting Shooters Association ahụ."" (Under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.)
* While the other options have elements of truth (safety, conservation), they aren't the complete and direct answer to *what* program the shooters were part of.  Option D pinpoints the program's origin.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""N’ime otu mmekọrịta nke NPWS na Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc, e were n’ọrụ ndị ọrụ afọ ofufo tozuru oke..."" This means the program was conducted *at least once*.
* **The passage also states:** ""... ndị ọrụ anọ a họọrọ maka mmemme ọgbụgba nke mbụ bụ ndị akuzigorola nchekwa ma nye ha ọzụzụ."" This confirms there was an initial program.

* **The passage confirms:** ""Ndị ọrụ Ranger bụ ndị na-ahụ maka ndị na-agba ụta.""

Therefore, the statement that the program was only conducted once and not repeated is inaccurate according to the provided text.

The text states the controller uses ""two side-mounted sensors"" to detect its orientation.  To control the game, the player needs to *move* the controller and the sensors will track that movement. Therefore, the sensors need to be *on the side* of the controller for the player to manipulate them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebumnuche idowe sensọ onye njikwa nso na njikwa:** While the sensors need to be near the controller, this isn't the primary action *the player* takes.
* **B: Triangle ebe onye ọ bụla nọ:**  This is irrelevant to how the controller works.
* **D: Ekwesịrị ịkwagharị onye njikwa ahụ kwụ ọtọ:** The text doesn't mention anything about needing to hold the controller in a specific orientation.  The sensors detect orientation as the controller is *moved*.

Here's why:

The passage states the controller uses ""ihe mmetụta abụọ dị n'akụkụ onyonyo"" to detect its orientation. This is what allows the controller to be moved and controlled in front of the television.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: onye njikwa maka Nintendo Revolution:** While the controller *is* for the Nintendo Revolution, it's not the *thing* that allows it to be moved in front of the TV.
* **C: Adreesị isi okwu:** This is a technical term related to memory addressing and isn't relevant to how the controller moves.
* **D: Sistemụ egwuregwu Nintendo Revolution:** This is the entire game system, not the specific component enabling the motion control.

The question asks what the *latest* Xinhua report says. The text states: ""Ozi ndị ọzọ mechara bata kwuru na ụgbọ elu ahụ natara iyi ụjọ gbasara ogbunigwe ya mere o ji wee lọghachi Afghanistan, lotuo na Kandahar.""  This means the reason for the return to Afghanistan and landing in Kandahar was a bomb scare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọ dabara na Ürümqi (It landed in Ürümqi):**  The text indicates the plane *left* Ürümqi due to the bomb scare, not that it landed there.
* **C: Afghanistan bụ ebe njem ụgbọ elu ahụ na-aga (Afghanistan is where the plane is going):** While the plane did go to Afghanistan, the reason for the trip was the bomb scare.  The focus of the latest report is the scare itself.
* **D: Ọ dabara na Kandahar (It landed in Kandahar):** While the plane landed in Kandahar, the core information of the latest report is the bomb scare that prompted the return.



"
Kedu ihe na-efu na akụkọ mbụ nke ụlọ ọrụ ọhụrụ Xinhua?,"The correct answer is **D: A tụrụ ụgbọ elu ahụ egwu bọmbụ.**

Here's why:

* The question asks what the *initial* report from Xinhua news agency *missed*.
* The text states the initial report said the plane was taken back to Afghanistan after a sudden forced landing in Ürümqi.
* However, later information revealed the plane had received warnings about a bomb scare, which led to the return to Afghanistan.
* Therefore, the initial report omitted the crucial detail of the bomb scare.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: E weghaara ụgbọ elu ahụ (The plane was not taken)** - The initial report *did* say it was taken back.
* **B: A jụrụ ọdịda mmanye maka ụgbọ elu ahụ (The plane was searched for bombs)** - While the plane *was* searched, the initial report didn't mention the search itself. It focused on the return.
* **C: Ụgbọ elu ahụ laghachiri na Afghanistan ka e mechara njem (The plane returned to Afghanistan after the flight was completed)** - The text says it returned after a *forced landing* in Ürümqi, not after the flight was completed.

This translates to: ""...publicly on a radio broadcast on Sveriges Radio in Swedish, when she said the committee had given up trying to reach Bob Dylan regarding his win for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016, and they had abandoned their efforts to get in touch with him. Danius said, """"We are not doing anything now. We called and contacted his closest online advisor and also got a response. That's enough."""" ""

Therefore, Sara Danius announced that the committee had given up trying to contact Bob Dylan.
"
Onye na-enweghị ike ịchọta?,"The correct answer is **A: Onye ọrụ ibe ya na Bob Dylan nọ nso**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the Nobel committee *tried* to reach Bob Dylan and his closest internet contact to notify him of the award.
* The passage also mentions Sara Danius (the head of the committee) and Swedish academics.
* The passage explicitly states they *hadn't* been able to reach Dylan and his representative.

Therefore, the entity that couldn't be found is Bob Dylan's representative (or someone close to him who could be contacted).

*   The floating roof's purpose is to allow for expansion and contraction of the oil. However, if the roof is rising excessively, it indicates that the expansion is greater than what the roof can accommodate.
*   **Thermal expansion** is the increase in volume of a substance due to an increase in temperature. This is the direct cause of the oil rising and potentially overflowing.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: The secondary containment compartment is completely full.** While a full secondary containment would worsen the situation, the passage focuses on the expansion of the oil *within* the tank causing the roof to rise.
*   **B: Usoro iwu ọkụ na-anwale ule nkịtị (Routine fire safety tests).** Routine tests wouldn't cause a significant rise in temperature and oil expansion.
*   **D: Ọkụ n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri dị na Fort Greely (Fire at the Fort Greely naval base).** While a fire at the base could potentially impact the tank, the passage focuses specifically on the heat *inside* the tank as the direct cause of the floating roof rising.

Valve enyemaka meghere maka gịnị kpatara ya?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbasa ọkụ mere n'ime tankị**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọkụ ọnyụnyụ sochitere nlekwa a na emechite anya n'ụlọ ihe gbasara ọkụ mere ka valvụ enyemaka mepee mmanụ..."" This directly indicates that the fire caused the relief valve to open.
"
Kedu ka mmiri siri dị ugbu a na Ward nke itoolu?,"The correct answer is **C: Elu-elu** (Over 100).

Here's why:

The passage states that the water reached a height of **100 feet** on one section of the levee.  The question asks how the water is currently in Ward Itoolu, and since the water reached 100 feet, it is currently over 100 feet.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ukwụ 20** (20 feet) - This is less than the height the water reached.
*   **B: 6 isii** (6 feet) - This is significantly less than the height the water reached.
*   **D: Ukwụ 100** (100 feet) - While the water *did* reach 100 feet, the question asks about the current state, and the passage doesn't say the water has receded to exactly 100 feet. It was *over* 100 feet.



"
"Na Ward nke itoolu, gịnị mere n'oge Hurricane Katrina?","The correct answer is **D: E ji sentimita 6 nke mmiri ozuzo kụjie levee ahụ mebiri emebi.**

Here's why:

* The question states that the U.S. Corps of Engineers estimated that **six inches** of water could overcome the initial levee barriers. 
* It also mentions that the water reached **100 feet** on one side of the levee in Ward Itoolu during Hurricane Katrina. This indicates the water *overtopped* the levee.
* Option D accurately reflects the initial depth of water needed to breach the levee.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmiri idei mmiri dị 100 ụkwụ** (Water level was 100 feet): This describes the *final* water level, not the initial depth that caused the breach.
* **B: E ji mmiri dị n'úkwù kpuchie levee ahụ** (The levee was covered with deep water): While the levee *was* covered with water, this doesn't specify the critical depth that caused the failure.
* **C: Iju mmiri nke dị ụkwụ 20 dị** (The water level was 20 feet): This is incorrect as the initial estimate was for six inches.



"
Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a bụ ụgha ka Hamilton siri kwuo?,"The correct answer is **B: Ihe ize ndụ na ndị ọrịa ndị ọzọ ga-ebute ọrịa ahụ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the hospital faced criticism *for* not isolating the patient to prevent further infection.**  This implies the hospital *didn't* take the necessary steps to contain the spread.
* **Option B directly contradicts the criticism.** The hospital was criticized *because* they didn't prevent the spread, meaning they *did* acknowledge the risk to other patients.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebe njem onye ọrịa:**  The passage confirms the patient arrived from Nigeria, where Ebola was present. This is factually accurate.
* **C: Ma esorola usoro iwu ziri ezi:** The passage states the hospital *faced criticism* for its infection control measures. This suggests the measures were not considered adequate or proper, not that they were correct.
* **D: Ahụ ike nke onye ọrịa ugbu a:** The passage states the patient was in critical condition.  This is a confirmed detail.



Therefore, option B is the only statement Hamilton could have made that is false based on the information provided in the passage.
"
Gịnị bụ ihe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị na-agbalị ịghọta?,"The correct answer is **D: Olee otú Ụwa si malite** (How the Earth started).

Here's why:

The passage states that comets might have been a source of water and ingredients for the first life on Earth. Scientists are hopeful that by studying other, more different worlds (like our own Earth), they can understand *how* Earth began, especially given the similarities between the early Earth and other celestial bodies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: N'oge ahụ, ndị comet tụrụ ụwa** (At that time, comets were the world): This is not what the passage says. The passage says comets *might have been* a source of materials for the Earth.
*   **B: Kedu ka esi eme protein** (How to make protein): While the passage mentions protein production, it's not the primary focus of what scientists are trying to understand about comets and the origins of life.
*   **C: Na-akọwapụta ihe ndị dị ndụ** (Describing living things): The passage mentions the origin of life, not the description of existing life forms.

Therefore, the core question the scientists are trying to answer is how the Earth itself came into being."
"Kedu akụkụ nke ndị uwe ojii agbata obi keere na mmechi ahụ, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Ha tụrụ ndị ọkwọ ụgbọala aka n'ụzọ ọzọ**.

The passage states: ""...enyeaka nke ndị uwe ojii 80 nọ anọ iduzi ndị na-anya ụgbọ ala n’ụzọ ndị ọzọ."" This directly supports option C. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha rịọrọ ka ndị FBI mechaa mmechi ahụ:** The passage says the government closed the checkpoint *with* FBI support, not that they requested the FBI to do it.
*   **B: Ha họọrọ ime mmechi ahụ:** While the government closed it, the passage doesn't say they *chose* to do so in a way that is attributed to the police requesting or initiating the closure.
*   **D: Ha kwuru na igbu oge na okporo ụzọ na ụzọ ọzọ:** The passage states that there were *no* incidents of violence on the beltway or other roads.



"
Kedu ka mmechi ahụ siri metụta ụzọ mbata tube?,"The correct answer is **A: E debere ha iche**.

Here's why:

The passage states ""... ndị ọchịchị njem Meriland mechiri njem site na nkwado FBI. E jiri ụmụ wongworo mkpofu igbochi ụmụ mbata tuubu ma enyemaka nke ndị uwe ojii 80 nọ anọ iduzi ndị na-anya ụgbọ ala n’ụzọ ndị ọzọ.""

This means the way people were previously entering the tube (presumably a road or path) was blocked. They were redirected to other routes. Option A, ""E debere ha iche"" (They were diverted/blocked), accurately reflects this.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ha jere ozi dị ka ntụgharị uche:** The passage doesn't say anything about the routes sounding like diversions.
*   **C: Ndị ọkwọ ụgbọala nwere ike ịnweta ha:** The passage explicitly states the routes were blocked, implying they couldn't access them.
*   **D: A kwadoro okporo ụzọ ruo ọtụtụ kilomita tupu mgbe ahụ:** The passage doesn't give any information about road construction.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Highway Patrol nyere onye na-ese foto ohere ịgafe okporo ụzọ ọzọ** While the Highway Patrol did direct traffic, the text doesn't say they *allowed* the photographer to cross. It says they directed the bus to turn around.
* **C: E jidere nkwụsị ndị uwe ojii na igwefoto** The text mentions the photographer was directed to turn around by the Highway Patrol, but there's no mention of arresting them or confiscating the camera.
* **D: Onye na-ese foto nwere ihe ịga nke ọma n'iweta ọnyà Bieber** This statement is completely unrelated to the events described in the text.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọnọdụ ahụike onyeisiala adịla mma"" which translates to ""The president's health is not good.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Akpịrị ya na-afụ ụfụ (He is suffering from a fever)** - The text doesn't mention a fever.
*   **C: Ahụ́ adịkwa ya mma (His health is also good)** - This is the opposite of what the text states.
*   **D: Ahụ ọkụ na-agba ya (He has a hot rash)** - The text doesn't mention a rash.

* **The passage states:** ""Ọnọdụ ahụike onyeisiala adịla mma, mana ọ ka ga-anọpụ anọpụ ruo ọtụtụ abalị."" (The health condition of the speaker is not good, but he will be staying home for many days.)
* **Option B directly reflects this statement.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Okpomọkụ ya adịghị ebuli elu** - The passage explicitly says his health condition is *not good*.
* **C: Ahụ siri ya ike nke na ọ ga-esi n'ụlọ rụọ ọrụ** -  While he *can* work remotely, the passage emphasizes he'll be staying home for many days due to his health.
* **D: O bu nje virus ahụ nke ukwuu** - The passage doesn't mention what caused his health issue. It only states his health isn't good.

"Kedu mgbe a tụrụ anya na Tropical Cyclone Gonu ga-aga n'ihu na-akụda mmụọ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: N'ihu eru elu ya**.

The passage states the cyclone was already moving at 240 km/h *before* reaching the Maldives. It also mentions the wind speed was decreasing as it approached. The phrase ""Na nkacha elu ya"" translates to ""In its peak"" or ""As it continued to move upwards/intensify"". Therefore, the prediction of continued intensification would logically occur while the cyclone was still strengthening.
"
"Mgbe Tropical Cyclone Gonu kachasi ike, kedu ka ifufe siri were ọsọ ọsọ?","The correct answer is **B: 240 kilomita kwa elekere**.

The passage states: ""rutere ifufe nọgidesịrị ike nke kilomita 240 kwa awa (maịlị 149 kwa awa)."" This translates to the wind reaching a sustained speed of 240 kilometers per hour.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a tozuru oke dị ka njirimara Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **A: Algae nke otu ụdị**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ihe n’ebute taid n’acha uhie uhie bu oke Karenia brevis, otu **single-celled organism** n’agba na mmiri.""  This clearly indicates *Karenia brevis* is a single-celled algae.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: O nwere ike ime ka akwara ndị mmadụ ghara ịrụ ọrụ:** While true, this is a *consequence* of *Karenia brevis*'s actions (producing toxins), not a defining characteristic *of* the organism itself.
* **C: Ọ nwere ọtụtụ sel:** The passage explicitly states it's *single-celled*.
* **D: Nke a na-eme ndammana:** The passage describes the effect on marine life and humans, but doesn't state that *Karenia brevis* itself causes red tides. It *is* the organism that causes the red tides.



"
Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a Karena Brevis na-enweghị ike ime?,"The correct answer is **B: Na-abawanye nke ọma na ọnụọgụ n'ọnụọgụ ọ bụla**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Karenia brevis can reproduce to thrive and become harmful algal blooms. These blooms produce toxins that kill fish and can affect humans through contaminated seafood and water.
* **Therefore:** The passage implies that Karenia brevis *doesn't* simply reproduce without consequence. It requires specific conditions to bloom and produce toxins. Option B suggests it always reproduces ""well"" regardless of conditions, which contradicts the passage's description of harmful blooms requiring specific, often negative, conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Enwere ike inwe nkwarụ akwara azụ:** The passage explicitly states that Karenia brevis's toxins can cause fish kills and affect human health, including causing neurotoxic effects in animals and humans, which can damage the spinal cord.
* **C: Mmetụta mmiri:** The passage directly mentions that harmful blooms can cause water contamination.
* **D: Imepụta neurotoxic:** The passage states that the algae produce neurotoxins that can harm both fish and humans.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-emeghị n'ihi Hurricane Felicia, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: Ide mmiri n'okporo ụzọ (Evacuation orders)**.

The passage states: ""Enwebeghị mkpesa ide mmiri m'ọbụ mmebi ihe."" This directly indicates that no evacuation orders were issued.  The passage mentions rain and storm surge, but no evacuation orders.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mma mmiri ozuzo (Storm surge)**: The passage states ""Ihe fọdụrụ na ya butere maka mmiri ozizo n'ọtụtụ isuo..."" indicating a storm surge did occur.
*   **B: égbè eluigwe na-eso mmiri ozuzo (Rainfall)**:  The passage mentions ""mmiri ozuzo ahụ bụ nke égbè eluigwe na àmụmà ugboro ugboro sonyere,"" indicating rainfall.
*   **C: àmụmà na-adịgide adịgide (Thunderstorms)**: The passage mentions ""àmụmà,"" indicating thunderstorms occurred.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara ajọ ifufe Felicia?,"The correct answer is **A: Oahu ritere uru na mmiri ozuzo sochirinụ**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""Ihe fọdụrụ na ya butere maka mmiri ozizo n'ọtụtụ isuo..."" meaning it *caused* flooding. It doesn't say Oahu *benefited* from the flooding. In fact, the text describes the flooding as potentially problematic.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true based on the text:

*   **B: Mgbe emechara ya dị ka ịda mbà n'obi okpomọkụ na mbido, ọ mechara bụrụ ajọ ifufe nke 4** - The text explicitly says Felicia started as a tropical depression and strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane.

*   **D: E nwere mmiri ozuzo na ụfọdụ àmụ̀mà** - The text specifically states that some of the flooding was from heavy rainfall and recurring cloud cover.

Therefore, option A is the only statement that contradicts the information given in the text."

The provided text explicitly states: ""Piquet Jr. was fired after the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix."" The passage doesn't mention Fernando Alonso being injured (A), Piquet Jr. winning (B), or problems with the safety car (D).
"
Kedu oge ihe mberede a mere?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe Alonso kwụsịrị olulu ya**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Piquet Jr. kpọkashịrị n’ime 2008 Singapore Grand Prix ozugbo o mechara nkwụsị obere oge maka Fernando Alonso...""  This means Piquet Jr.'s actions happened *after* Alonso's pit stop.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ewe obere oge karịa ka ndị nchọpụta chere na mbụ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: mmemme ozuzu n'etiti ọtụtụ ụdị (Evolutionary divergence among multiple species)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the discovery of the new finch species on the Galápagos Islands is significant *because* it happened in only two generations. This is *faster* than the generally accepted timescale for evolutionary divergence.  The passage explicitly contrasts this with the slower evolutionary changes observed in Darwin's finches.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmepe nke ụdị (Speciation)**: While speciation *is* a result of evolutionary divergence, the question asks *what* is happening faster. The answer is the divergence happening *between* the two species.
* **B: Ozi gbasara ụdị (News about species)**: The passage doesn't discuss the speed of news dissemination.
* **D: Ụdị 'na-aga n'ihu n'oge (Species evolving over time)**:  Evolution happens over time, and the passage is talking about the *speed* of that evolution in this specific case.




"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ndị nchọpụta na-akọghị?,"The correct answer is **B: Ogologo oge ole ka usoro evolushọn ahụ were.**

Here's why:

* The passage states that the new species evolved in *just two generations*, which is a relatively short timeframe.
* The passage *doesn't* specify *how long* the evolutionary process took overall. It only highlights the speed of this particular instance of evolution.
* The passage *does* state the name of the new species (Jiospiza konirostrisi).
* The passage *doesn't* mention anything about the birds' role in the ecosystem.

Therefore, the only information *not* mentioned in the passage is the total duration of the evolutionary process.

Ebee ka a ga-enwe CowParade?,"The correct answer is **B: Na Bucharest**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mmemme nka a so n'atụmatụ Bucharest Siti Họl nwere ime ka..."" which translates to ""This cultural event, in collaboration with Bucharest City Hall, aims to..."" and later mentions Bucharest as the location of the CowParade.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...ga bụ onye nnabata na mmeme KawụParedị, **mmeme nka ọha kachasị ukwuu n'ụwa n'ile...**"" 

Option D directly reflects this statement. The other options are either incomplete or not directly supported by the text:

* A: While the CowParade is considered ""artistic,"" the text doesn't explicitly say it only happens where art is expected.
* B: It's true the Bucharest City Hall organized it, but this isn't the defining characteristic mentioned in the passage.
* C: While it's a summer art event in Southern Eastern Europe, the passage highlights its size as the most important feature.



"
Gịnị kpaliri mkpebi Russia ịkwụsị iji II-76?,"The correct answer is **A: ime agha**.

The text states that a ""catastrophic incident"" occurred with an Il-76 in Russia last month, and that Russia has halted the use of Il-76s *after* this incident. While the text doesn't explicitly say it's *because* of the war, the context of a catastrophic incident leading to a halt in usage strongly suggests a safety concern likely exacerbated by the ongoing conflict. The other options are not directly supported by the text.



"
II-76: Gịnị ka ọ bụ?,"The correct answer is **C: ụgbọ elu (airplane)**.

The text explicitly states ""Il-76 bụ ngalaba gbapụtara ihe nke ndị agha Rọshịa na Sọviyetị kamgbe afọ 1970 ga"" which translates to ""The Il-76 is a military transport aircraft since 1970"".
"
Onye goro ndị ọrụ na-ede akwụkwọ Simpson?,"The correct answer is **D: Groening**.

The text states: ""N'1989 ọ nyere aka na mmepụta The Simpsons ya na Brooks na Groening, ọ bụ ya hụrụ maka ịwe ndị otu edemede mbụ nke ihe nkiri a."" This translates to ""In 1989 he helped with the production of The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening, he was responsible for writing the original scripts for the film.""

Therefore, Groening was responsible for writing the original scripts for The Simpsons."
"Onye na-ezigara ya ozi agbamume, ka Fluke siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Ndị na-akwado ahụike ụmụ nwanyị**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Fluke made the decision *because of many words of support he received from men and women who said that birth control pills were appropriate.* 
* This directly points to the supporters of women's health as the source of the encouragement that influenced his decision.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: onye ahụike (Healthcare provider)** While a healthcare provider might offer information, the passage specifically highlights *words of support* leading to the decision, not necessarily medical advice.
* **C: Ụdị nwoke (Men in general)** While men offered support, the passage doesn't indicate that men were the primary source of encouragement. It mentions both men and women.
* **D: Enwere ma nwoke ma nwanyị (Both men and women)** While true, the passage emphasizes the *support* from those advocating for women's health.  Option B is more specific and accurate.



"
"Gịnị ka ụfọdụ ndị na-achọghị ka ndị inyom na-ekwu banyere ya, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: ọdịmma ụmụ nwanyị**.

This implies that some people are concerned about the health of women, and that their concerns are driving the article.  Therefore, **ọdịmma ụmụ nwanyị (women's health)** is the concern.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị mmadụ bụ ụmụ nwoke (Men are men):** While the article mentions men's support, it's not the central concern expressed by those who oppose the topic.
*   **B: Ego mmefu ahụike (Health economics):**  The passage doesn't mention financial concerns related to healthcare.
*   **D: Ohere (Opportunity):** The passage doesn't discuss opportunity as a reason for opposition."
"Kedu mbara ala kachasị ndụ, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The answer is **A: Ụwa (Earth)**.

Stofan's passage states: ""Ka anyị madebere, sọ otu ụwa na-egosi ọtụtụ ike karịa Taịtan, ma aha ya bụ Earth."" This directly identifies Earth as the most vibrant planet mentioned in the text.
"
Kedu ụwa a chọtara nke nwere osimiri na ọdọ mmiri ndị nwere mmiri mmiri na-agafe agafe?,"The answer is **C: Sistemu anyanwụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a world with a vast ocean and underwater features.** This aligns with the concept of an exoplanet with liquid water.
* **The passage states this world is more powerful than Titan.** Titan is Saturn's largest moon, known for its lakes of liquid methane and ethane. The world in the passage is presented as significantly more powerful, suggesting a larger, potentially more complex system.
* **The passage refers to Earth as a point of comparison.** This implies the world being described is distinct from Earth, and the mention of ""Sistemu anyanwụ"" (Outer System/Exoplanet System) is the most logical category for such a world.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jupiter:** While Jupiter has a vast ocean of liquid metallic hydrogen, the description in the passage doesn't specifically mention a traditional ocean like Earth's or Titan's, nor does it highlight the power of the world as being analogous to Jupiter.
* **B: Onye nwere nnukwu ike, ọgụgụ isi, ma ọ bụ mkpa (Someone with great power, intelligence, or need):** This is a metaphorical interpretation of the passage and doesn't relate to a physical world.
* **D: Saturn:** Saturn is a gas giant with rings, not a world with oceans.

Therefore, ""Sistemu anyanwụ"" (Outer System/Exoplanet System) is the most suitable answer as it encompasses the possibility of an exoplanet with a substantial ocean and underwater features, more powerful than Titan, and distinct from Earth."
Kedu n'ime nchọpụta ndị a na-enweghị njikọ na ịchọta nku?,"The correct answer is **B: N'ịmara na anaghị arụ ọrụ maka ụgbọ elu (Inition that they were not used for flight)**.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the discovery of feathers and their potential functions (temperature regulation, display). It explicitly states that the rachis (central shaft) of dinosaur feathers was not fully developed and had structures like barbs and barbules.  However, the passage *doesn't* discuss whether these feathers were used for flight or not. Option B introduces an idea (lack of flight use) that isn't directly addressed or confirmed by the information presented about the feather discovery.

Let's look at why the other options *are* connected to the feather discovery:

* **A: The hue of the animal (The hue of the animal):** The passage mentions that the feathers had a hue, which is part of the discovery and study.
* **C: Understanding the initiation of feathers (Understanding the initiation of feathers):**  The entire passage is about understanding how feathers developed in dinosaurs.
* **D: Showing that many dinosaurs had feathers (Showing that many dinosaurs had feathers):** The passage directly discusses the discovery of feathers on dinosaurs.



"
Kedu ihe enweghị nku nke dinosaurs?,"The correct answer is **B: A rachis**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na nku ajọ anụ daịnosọ enweghị akụ toro nke ọma, nke a na akpọ **rachis**..."" This directly identifies the rachis as the part of the feather that was *missing* or underdeveloped in dinosaurs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: filament nkeji nke na-apụta site na barb nke nku:**  The passage mentions barbules, which are filaments, as being present.
*   **C: okenye feathers:** The passage discusses feathers developing in dinosaurs.
*   **D: agba agba n'okpuru:** The passage mentions that pigment was found underneath the feathers.

This directly contradicts option B. The passage indicates that no drug has proven effective at *curing* the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate:

*   **A: Enwere ọgwụ mgbochi na ya:** The passage states ""Otu ọgwụ mgbochi aka na-ele anya egosila..."" This confirms the existence of a potential antiviral.
*   **C: Ejiri ya na nyocha PALM dịka njikwa:** The passage mentions, ""Na nnwale PALM, eji ZMapp mere ihe nruba ama, nke a putara na ndi sayentist jiri ya mee baseline tunyere ogwugwo ato ozo."" This indicates that ZMapp was used as a control group.
*   **D: Nnyocha ndị e mere na-egosi na uru ya adịchaghị ukwuu dị ka e kweere na mbụ:** The passage says, ""...ndi sayentist jiri ya mee baseline tunyere ogwugwo ato ozo,"" suggesting that the initial hopes for ZMapp's effectiveness were not fully realized. The later findings indicated a limited benefit.



Therefore, option B is the only statement directly contradicted by the passage."
Kedu otu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a kpọtụrụ aha kacha mma chịkọta nnwale PALM?,"The best answer is **C: ZMapp rụrụ ọrụ dị ka mmalite ikpe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""One antibody, ZMapp, showed promise, but subsequent trials showed it did not provide the survival benefit initially hoped for."" This directly supports the idea that ZMapp was initially seen as a potential lead (a ""mmalite ikpe"").  The PALM trial was designed to test this lead.
* **Option A is somewhat accurate but less precise.** While the study *did* show potential benefits, the passage also emphasizes that these benefits weren't realized.
* **Option B is too general.** The fact that there were other treatments is mentioned, but it's not the central point related to the PALM trial and ZMapp's role.
* **Option D is incorrect.** The passage states ZMapp *did not* work well in controlling the disease.

Therefore, option C best captures the initial hope surrounding ZMapp and its role as a starting point for further research, which the PALM trial aimed to evaluate.
"
Ebe ndị ọkà mmụta sayensị kwenyere na mgbawa ọhụrụ ahụ ga-enwe mmetụta kasịnụ?,"The correct answer is **B: mba ndị bara ọgaranya**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the invention is intended to be affordable (costing about a US cent to print) and accessible to people in underserved communities (""ndị nọ n'ọrịa n'obodo ndị n'enweghị ego""). This points directly to developing countries, where healthcare resources are often limited.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mba ndị na-emepe emepe:** While some developing countries might benefit, the passage doesn't specifically highlight them as the primary focus.
*   **C: N'ime United States:** The affordability aspect makes it less relevant to the United States, where healthcare costs are already high. The passage highlights its potential to address disparities, not necessarily improve existing healthcare in a wealthy nation.
*   **D: Mahadum Stanford:** Stanford is the *source* of the invention, not the area where it will have the biggest impact.



"
Kedu otu a ga-esi wuo ngwaọrụ nyocha?,"The correct answer is **B: ndị na-ebi akwụkwọ inkjet nkịtị**.

The text explicitly states that the device can be printed using a ""regular inkjet printer"". The researchers claim it can be made for the cost of one US cent, which implies the primary component is the printing process itself using readily available materials. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.

"Kedu n'ime okwu ndị na-esonụ gbasara scarps lobate bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Ha nwere ike pụta n'ihi na ọnwa na-adị ntakịrị.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states the scarps are puzzling because they suggest significant tectonic activity, which is thought to be absent on the Moon.** This implies the scarps are *not* likely caused by frequent, minor impacts. 
* **A is correct:** The passage states the scarps are believed to be remnants of a period of more intense lunar volcanism.
* **B is correct:**  The scarps indicate geological processes *did* occur on the Moon.
* **D is incorrect:** The passage doesn't say there are *not many* scarps; it highlights the unusual nature of *these specific* lobate scarps.



Therefore, the statement that scarps are likely due to frequent impacts directly contradicts the information given in the passage.



"
Kedu nkọwa nke ọdịdị ala na-akwado nkwuputa nke akụkụ ahụ na ọnwa na-enwe ọrụ geologic?,"The correct answer is **B: Ogologo oge gara aga, a rụrụ ala ndị ahụ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** The lunar depressions (skaps) have a layered, ripple-like structure. This suggests a gradual build-up of material over time.
* **The passage also states:** This contradicts the idea of minimal geological activity on the Moon.
* **Option B aligns with both points:** If the depressions formed a long time ago, it implies that there *was* significant geological activity in the past, even if it's not happening now.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọnwa na-eji nke nta nke nta na-adị ntakịrị:** This doesn't explain the layered structure or the contradiction with minimal activity.
* **C: N'elu ọnụ ọgụgụ dị nta nke atụmatụ ndị a:** This doesn't address the significance of the layered structure or the geological implications.
* **D: Ọ bụ naanị n'oge na-adịbeghị anya ka arụrụ ala ahụ:** This is too specific. While activity might have been concentrated in the distant past, the layered structure suggests a process that could have occurred over a significant period.

"Kedu ihe na-agaghị aga n'ihu ruo mgbe ebubo ahụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Okwu agbakwunyere (Further statements)**.

The text states: ""Ụlọ ọrụ Krawn, nke nọ n'isi amamikpe, agwala ndị nta akụkọ na ha agaghị ekwu okwu gbasara okwu akpụ n'ọnụ ozo ruo mgbe amara mmadụ ikpe."" This translates to: ""The Crown Prosecution Service advises journalists not to speak further about the case until after the jury verdict.""

Therefore, journalists are restricted from making **further statements** about the case.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Akwụkwọ akụkọ foto (Photo reports):** While the text mentions the problematic nature of photo evidence, it doesn't say journalists are restricted from *creating* photo reports *before* the verdict.
*   **C: Na-ekwu maka akaebe nke ndị akaebe anya (Reporting on eyewitness testimony):** The text doesn't mention any restrictions on reporting eyewitness testimony.
*   **D: Mbipụta nke akụkọ (Publication of reports):**  The restriction is on *speaking* further, not necessarily on the *publication* of reports. The publication itself might still occur, but further commentary isn't allowed.



"
Kedu ihe akụkụ ahụ edepụtaghị dị ka mbipụta dị ugbu a maka ndị na-edochi anya?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọnụ ọgụgụ nke ice (Number of ice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tinyere mmiri oyi, ọnọdụ ihu igwe dị egwu na egbochi mgbalị nzọpụta."" (Frozen water is dangerous, and the skin condition hinders rescue efforts.)  It also mentions that the ""onu-ogugu na idi-ike nke mmiri ahu jukporo oyi"" (the power and strength of the frozen water) is the worst it's been in 15 years.

The passage explicitly mentions the *danger* to skin and hindered rescue. While the *size* of the ice (volume/area) is implied by the statement about the power and strength, the *number* of ice pieces isn't mentioned at all.  The focus is on the overall severity and the effects of the frozen water.



"
Kedu ihe ọzọ na-egbochi ọrụ nnapụta ma e wezụga ice?,"The answer is **B: Burugburu ebe obibi**.

Here's why: The text states that ""ọnọdụ ihu igwe dị egwu na egbochi mgbalị nzọpụta"" which translates to ""the skin condition is alarming and hinders attempts at escape.""  This suggests environmental factors are involved, not just the ice itself.  The options provided are:

*   **A: Enweghi ihe onwunwe** (No possessions) - This isn't mentioned in the text.
*   **B: Burugburu ebe obibi** (Environment) - This aligns with the text's description of a ""skin condition"" as a hindrance.
*   **C: Enweghị enyemaka** (No help) - While lack of help could be a factor, the text doesn't explicitly mention it.
*   **D: Ndị sealers** (Sealers) - This term isn't relevant to the context of the text.

Therefore, the environment (burugburu ebe obibi) is the most likely answer."
Kedu echiche Roberts akwadoghị?,"The correct answer is **A: Omume nke nyocha ikpe**.

Here's why:

* The passage states Roberts criticized the ""abuse of judicial power"" in the Roe v. Wade decision. This directly points to his disapproval of the way the Supreme Court had been making decisions, specifically in this instance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ihe mere o ji dị mkpa ịgbaso mkpebi Ụlọikpe Kasị Elu:** The passage actually *emphasizes* the importance of upholding Supreme Court decisions, calling Roe v. Wade ""settled precedent."" Roberts' criticism wasn't about the need to follow precedent, but about the precedent itself.
* **C: Nke mbụ nke ndụ:** The passage mentions Roberts acknowledged the ""core of the Roe precedent rested on it,"" implying he didn't necessarily disagree with the concept of the sanctity of life.  His issue was with the legal reasoning and the power used to establish it.
* **D: Nzuzo dị ka ikike:** While the passage mentions ""core of the Roe precedent rested on it"" (likely referring to the right to privacy), the main focus of his criticism was on the *judicial power* used to establish that right, not the right itself.



"
Roberts chere na isiokwu ahụ bụ omume rụrụ arụ nke na-agaghị atụle?,"The correct answer is **A: Nkwekọrịta nke mkpebi Ụlọikpe Kasị Elu**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Roberts ""mechekwara kwugharịa ihe o kwuru mbụ, na ikpe Roe v. Wade bụ """"iwu ala ekpebigoro"""""". This indicates he is commenting on the *precedent* set by the Roe v. Wade decision. He's essentially saying the decision was wrongly decided (an ""improper exercise of judicial power"") and shouldn't be considered a valid precedent.  He's criticizing the Supreme Court's decision-making process in Roe v. Wade.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ikpe na Roe v. Wade:** While the passage mentions Roe v. Wade, it's not saying Roberts *agrees* with the *decision* of Roe v. Wade. He's criticizing the *basis* upon which it was decided.
* **C: ikike nzuzo nzuzo:** Roberts acknowledges the ""constitutional basis"" of the Roe decision but doesn't necessarily agree with it. His core criticism is about the *process* of the decision-making.
* **D: Nkọwa nke ikpe:**  Roberts is not providing a *description* of the Roe v. Wade ruling. He is critiquing the *justification* and *validity* of the ruling.



"
Ebee ka ọkụ abụọ ahụ na-atụ aka?,"The correct answer is **B: Site na nsọtụ obodo**.

Here's why:

The passage states the two fires were used to illuminate the fields ""from the town's outskirts"".  Therefore, the fires were located at the edges of the town.
"
"Kedu mgbe a na-arụ ụlọ elu ọhụrụ dị n'ebe ahụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **C: N'ime oge nke otu abalị**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Owuwu ụlọ ruru igwe ise na-aga n'ihu n'ebe ọrụ, a na arụkwa ụlọ njem na ogige ncheta n'etiti."" This translates to ""Five houses are under construction in the area, and a hotel and memorial park are also being built in the middle.""  The phrase ""n'ime oge nke otu abalị"" means ""in the course of one day."" This directly refers to the construction of the new houses, which is happening concurrently with other projects.

Kedu ihe akaebe na-egosi ọdịdị ọgba nke ụmụnna nwanyị asaa ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbanwe na okpomọkụ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ụmụ onyinyo infràreèd na-egosipụta mgbanwe okpomọkụ ahụ sitere n'ụbọchị na abalị na-egosi na ha nwere ike bụrụ ọgba. Ha na-adị oyi karịa gburugburu ha n'ehihie ma dị ọkụ karịa n'abalị."" (Infrared images show that the temperature changes from day to night, indicating they could be a volcano.

The other options are not supported by the text.
"
Kedu ka esi achọpụta njirimara okpomọkụ nke ụmụnna nwanyị asaa ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Foto infrared**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the man was *accused* of using a gas bomb. It doesn't say he *actually* took a boat and carried out the attack. This makes option A a false statement based on the provided text.
* Options B, C, and D are all directly supported by the information in the passage.

Therefore, the statement that the man took a boat and carried out the attack is the one that is *not* true according to the given text."
Ndị ọchịchị kwadoro kedu nkọwa gbasara mwakpo ahụ?,"The most accurate answer is **B: Nzụlite agbụrụ nke onye a na-enyo enyo.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ndị isi amatabeghi aha ya, mana ha ma na ọ bụ onye otu agbụrụ Uigọọ."" This highlights that the authorities identified the perpetrator based on his ethnicity (Uigọọ).
* **The question asks what description the government offered.** The government's description, based on the provided text, is that the perpetrator is from the Uigọọ ethnic group.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Aha ndị ọ bụla so:** The text doesn't provide any names.
* **C: Ebumnuche kpatara mwakpo ahụ:** The text describes *how* the attack happened but doesn't state the *reason* behind it.
* **D: Aha onye a na-enyo enyo, ma nke mbụ na nke ikpeazụ:** The text doesn't give a first or last name.



Therefore, option B is the only one directly supported by the information provided in the text."
"Na egwuregwu na Ellis Park, kedụ otu ga-asọmpi?","The correct answer is **C: Australia na South Africa**.

The passage states: ""A ga-agba egwuregwu ikpeazụ nke ogbe a n'Ellis Park na Johanesbọg n'izu na-abịa abịa, mgbe ndị Sprịngbọks ga-agba Ọstrelia."" (The final match of this series will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg next week, when the Springboks will play Australia.)
"
Ebee ka a ga-eme egwuregwu na-esote n'etiti Springboks?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""Ọ ga-agba egwuregwu ikpeazụ nke ogbe a n'Elis Pak na Johanesbọg n'izu na-abịa abịa, mgbe ndị Sprịngbọks ga-agba Ọstrelia."" which translates to ""The final match of this series will be played at Ellis Park in Johannesburg in the coming week, when the Springboks will travel to Australia.""
"
"N'ime ozi a, kedụ n'ime ihe ndị a ka ọdụ ụgbọ elu ahụ zutere nsogbu?","The correct answer is **B: Na-echekwa gyroscope**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ọdụ ụgbọ nọ n’eluụwa ahụ nọgidere na-akpa àgwà, n'agbanyeghị **ofufu gyroscope**...""  This means the gyroscope was failing, causing the spacecraft to lose stability. The other options aren't mentioned as problems the spacecraft faced.

"Kedu ihe bụ ọrụ nke ọdụ ụgbọ elu kwesịrị ịbụ, dịka akụkụ nke akwụkwọ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Ahụrụ gyroscope furu efu.**

The text states: ""Ọdụ ụgbọ nọ n’eluụwa ahụ nọgidere na-akpa àgwà, n'agbanyeghị ofufu gyroscope..."" which translates to ""The orbital station's attitude remained unstable, despite the functioning gyroscope..."" This indicates the gyroscope *wasn't* working properly, and therefore wasn't fulfilling its intended function.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na-aga n'ihu na-eme mgbanwe:** The text implies the attitude was unstable, not constantly changing.
* **C: Imecha njem mbara igwe:** This refers to spacewalks, which is not the core function of the attitude control system.
* **D: Na-agbanye ụgbọ elu:**  This means ""to fly the spacecraft,"" which is a consequence of proper attitude control, not the system's primary function.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ekwu banyere ọnọdụ ahụ bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The incorrect statement is **A: Ewelitere ya maka ikpe na steeti ebe AOL dabere.**

Here's why:

*   **The prompt states:** The legal precedent for the Virginia spambot case was *established* in Virginia, because AOL, the company that sent the emails, was based there. The lawsuit was filed in Virginia. The case itself wasn't *established* *for* a state where AOL was based, it happened in the state where AOL was based.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: E nwere ikpe:** The prompt explicitly states there *was* a case (the Virginia spambot case).
*   **C: Ikpe ahụ nwetara uru nke iwu gbasara email spam:** The case was brought under laws intended to combat email spam.
*   **D: AOL nọ na-eche ebubo:** AOL was accused of sending unsolicited emails (spam), which is what led to the legal action.

Therefore, the answer is **A**."
Kedu nke kacha mara ọnọdụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: AOL webatara okwu a nke mbụ.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ekpere ikpe ahụ na Vejinia n'ihi n'ọbụrụ ọnọdụ isi nweta ịntanetị bụ AOL, bụ ụlọọrụ wetara mkpesa ndị ahụ."" This directly indicates that AOL was the entity that initially faced the legal action.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Eboro ebubo nkesa na-akwadoghị megide AOL:** While a lawsuit *was* filed, the passage focuses on AOL's role as the sender of the spam, not just the filing of a lawsuit.
* **B: Ndị na-eweta ọrụ ịntanetị abụọ a ma ama bụ ndị sonyere na ikpe ahụ:**  The passage focuses specifically on AOL.
* **C: N'afọ 2003, e webatara okwu ahụ n'ụlọikpe:** While the lawsuit *began* in 2003, the passage emphasizes AOL as the origin point of the issue.

The question states: ""Kemgbe ọ kwagara na isi obodo Catalan, Vidal egwurula klọb egwuregwu 49."" This translates to: ""Since he arrived in the Catalan capital, Vidal has played 49 games for the club.""
"
Kedu otu chere ha ihu na egwuregwu ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Jarque**.

The passage states that Jarque is the one who is preparing for the game. The question asks who is expected to play in the game. Therefore, the answer is Jarque.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""E nwebeghị ịdọ aka na ntị nke ajọ ebili mmiri enyegoro, ma na-ndabere na ụlọ ọrụ jiofiziz Jakarta ahụ, a gaghị adọ aka na ntị nke ajọ ebili mmiri n’ihi na ala ọma jijiji ahụ eruteghị iheachọrọ nke ịdị ukwuu 6.5.""

This directly translates to: ""There was no tsunami warning issued by the Jakarta Geophysics Agency because the earthquake's magnitude did not reach the required high of 6.5.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Enweghị ihe ize ndụ nke mbufịt mbufịt (No signs of tsunamis):** While the passage mentions no signs of a tsunami, the *reason* for not issuing a warning is the earthquake's magnitude.
* **B: Iji gbochie ụjọ ndị bi na ya (To prevent the residents from panicking):**  This is the *opposite* of what happened. People *did* panic and evacuate.
* **C: Iji chebe ụlọ ọrụ dị nso (To protect nearby facilities):** The passage doesn't mention protecting facilities as a reason for not issuing a warning.



"
"Gịnị ka ala ọma jijiji ahụ kpatara, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **D: 6.5 na ọnụ ọgụgụ nke ịdị ukwuu**.

Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a na-eme ka anyanwụ na kpakpando ndị ọzọ na-arụ ọrụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntụgharị magnetik, nọmba Rossy, na ntụgharị.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""A chọpụtara na omume kpakpandu niile nọ na sistemụ bụ onwunwu ọkụ na ntụgharị ha na-anya ha, ma ọ nweghị ihe ọzọ."" This highlights the importance of magnetic fields and rotation.
* **The passage further connects these to Rossby waves:** ""A na-ejikọta ọnụ ọnwụnwụ ọkụ na ntụgharị ya amata akara Rossby nke otu kpakpando, nke metụtara na ọwụwụ plasma."" This directly links magnetic fields, rotation, and Rossby waves.
* **The passage also links Rossby waves to plasma waves:** ""Ka akara Rossby na-adị obere karịa, ka arụmarụ na-adịkwu obere nke kpakpando n’ikwanye ugwu nye ụmụ ntụgharị nke ihendọta."" This indicates a relationship between Rossby waves (related to magnetic fields and rotation) and plasma wave activity.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Plasma mgbanwe na luminance:** While luminance changes *might* be a consequence of the plasma activity, the passage doesn't explicitly state this as a primary *cause* of how the aurora and other magnetic fields function.
* **C: Ntụgharị na nchapụta:**  Rotation is mentioned, but ""nchapụta"" (dissipation/evaporation) is not a key factor highlighted in the passage concerning how the aurora and magnetic fields function.
* **D: Ntughari, nọmba Rossby, na luminance:**  While Rossby waves and luminance are mentioned, the passage emphasizes the role of rotation *and* magnetic fields.  ""Ntughari"" (instability) isn't directly tied to the core mechanisms described.



Therefore, **B** most accurately reflects the elements the passage identifies as crucial to understanding the aurora and magnetic field behavior."
Kedu otu esi ekenye nọmba Rossby na kpakpando?,"The correct answer is **D: Ugboro nke ntụgharị ndọta (Frequency of vorticity)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""ọnụ ọnwụnwụ ọkụ na ntụgharị ya amata akara Rossby nke otu kpakpando, nke metụtara na ọwụwụ plasma. Ka akara Rossby na-adị obere karịa, ka arụmarụ na-adịkwu obere nke kpakpando n’ikwanye ugwu nye ụmụ ntụgharị nke ihendọta.""  This directly links Rossby number to the frequency of vorticity (vorticity rotation).  A lower Rossby number means weaker vorticity rotation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ìhè na ntụgharị (Heat and vorticity):** While heat *can* influence vorticity, the passage focuses specifically on the *frequency* of vorticity in relation to the Rossby number.
* **B: Ego ole plasma na-eru (Amount of plasma reaching):** This is not directly related to the Rossby number or vorticity.
* **C: Ọnụ ego ọrụ (Operating cost):** This has no connection to the meteorological concepts discussed.

Ndị zara ajụjụ ole na ntuli aka ahụ kwadoro Australia ịghọ otu mba ozugbo?,"The correct answer is **A: Pasent 31**.

The question states that ""22.1% of voters believed Australia should become a republic *as soon as possible*"".  The question asks who supported Australia becoming a sovereign nation (which is the same as becoming a republic). 22.1% + 9.9% = 31% total.

While there's a slight discrepancy in how the question is phrased (asking about ""otu mba ozugbo"" vs. ""as soon as possible""), option A, representing 31%, is the closest and most accurate reflection of the data provided. There isn't an option that shows 22.1%. Option B's value of 29% is close to the total that supported a republican Australia but incorrect. Option C, 8%, is clearly wrong, and Option D, 34, is an incorrect value.

"Kedu mgbe Australia ga-ekwupụta na ya bụ mba, ka Julie Gillard siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ngwa ngwa o kwere mee**.

The text states that Julia Gillard, the Caretaker Prime Minister, said Australia should become a republic ""soon"" during the referendum campaign. Therefore, ""ngwa ngwa o kwere mee"" (soon) is the most accurate reflection of her statement.
"
Kedu nzukọ bụ isiokwu nyocha nke iwu?,"The correct answer is **D: Kọmiti na-ahụ maka nyocha na nyocha (Committee on Oversight and Reform)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Leslie Aun, representing the Komen foundation, stated that new laws prevent aid/funding to organizations that investigate alleged instances of alleged abuse of trust. The passage then details an investigation by Kliff Stens into potential misuse of funds related to an alleged abuse of trust involving a director of a foundation. This investigation falls under the purview of a committee focused on oversight and reform, investigating potential wrongdoing and ensuring accountability.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Kọmiti Ụlọ maka Energy na Azụmahịa (House Committee on Energy and Commerce):** While related to funding and organizations, the specific focus of this passage is on investigation and potential abuse of funds, not energy and commerce.
*   **B: Òtù Komen (Komen Foundation):** The Komen Foundation is the subject of the *new laws* and the funding restrictions, but not the *investigation itself*.
*   **C: Ụlọ ime ime (Department of Women's Affairs):** This is not mentioned in the passage.
"

This indicates that Cliff Stearns is the chairman of a committee that deals with investigations. While the specific committee isn't explicitly named as ""Kọmiti na-ahụ maka nyocha na nyocha,"" the description strongly implies it. The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.

This translates to: ""But the laptop computer market changed and became different as ASUS won the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007 from the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China.""
"
ASUS Eee PC: kedu ihe ọ bụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kọmpụta laptop**.

The passage explicitly states ""ASUS Eee PC, ewepụtara ụwa niile na mbụ maka ụmụ ihe nchekwa-ego na arụmọrụ ya, wụrụ isiokwu na-ewu ewu n’Ọnwa IT Taipei 2007.

This clearly defines the Eee PC as a type of laptop computer.
"
Ònye na-ahụ maka akwụkwọ nzi ozi ahụ furu efu?,"The correct answer is **A: ndị ọrụ ozi (radio operators)**.

The passage states that the radio station's operators discovered the man had been broadcasting for over a hundred hours, including New Year's Day broadcasts that were not being received by their intended audience. Therefore, the radio operators are responsible for the unpaid broadcasts.
"
"Ònye, dị ka paragraf ahụ, rịọrọ mgbaghara maka akwụkwọ ndị ahụ furu efu?","The correct answer is **C: ụlọ ọrụ mgbasa ozi**.

The paragraph states: ""Ụlọ ọrụ nzipụ wepụtara arịrịọ mgbaghara ha nye ụmụ amaala na ndị mgbasa ozi..."" This indicates the broadcasting station made the request for permission.
"
Del Potro nwere nsogbu n'ubu ya n'oge ụfọdụ?,"The correct answer is **C: N'ime seti nke abụọ**.

The passage states: ""Potro natara nlekota na ubu ya n’oge a mana were ike laghachi azu n’egwuregwu ahu."" This indicates the injury happened during the second set.
"
Nsonaazụ nkwụsị nke mbụ bụ..?,"The correct answer is **A: Murray tụfuru ya na ntọala mmalite**

The question states: ""Emeriri Murray na seti nke mbu na ndorondoro njirimara onye mmeri mgbe umu nwoke abuo jidere bolu ọ bụla n’ime setị."" This means Murray won the first set.
"
"Ònye, karịsịa, zutere onye ọrịa, dị ka akọwara n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Onye n'achị steeti**.

The text explicitly states: ""Taa, anyị mụtara na ụfọdụ ụmụaka ruru ogo ịgụ akwụkwọ bụ ndị achọpụtara na ha na onye ọrịa ahụ nwere mmekọ."" Then, the governor says, ""Okwu a dị mkpa. Kwere nkwa anyị na sistemụ anyị na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma dị ka etu o kwesịrị."" This directly links the governor to the discovery of the relationship with the patient.

"Olee mmesi obi ike, dị ka paragraf ahụ si dị, gọvanọ enyeghị mgbe ọ na-agwa ndị bi na Texas okwu?","The correct answer is **A: Sistemụ na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma**.

The paragraph states: ""Okwu a dị mkpa. Kwere nkwa anyị na sistemụ anyị na-arụ ọrụ nke ọma dị ka etu o kwesịrị.""  This directly indicates the governor is expressing confidence that the system is functioning properly.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: A na-echekwa nchekwa ọha site na ime ihe:** While the governor *says* they are following procedures to protect the public, the core statement of confidence is about the *system* itself, not just the actions being taken.
* **C: Ha nwere ike ime ihe ịma aka ahụ:** The paragraph doesn't explicitly state that they *can* overcome the challenge, only that other places have done so.
* **D: Ọnọdụ ahụ adịghị njọ:** The governor acknowledges that some children in contact with the patient have a relationship, implying the situation *is* serious.

The name ""The Onion"" is also mentioned as the satirical news source.

The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **B: Mahadum ntuli aka:** This is not mentioned as being founded by Washington University students.
*   **C: Ihe ngosi ụtụtụ:** This is not a satirical news source.
*   **D: yabasị:** This is not mentioned.

The passage explicitly states that The Onion has grown from a print publication to a **web site** that attracted millions of unique visitors. This demonstrates its evolution into a digital, web-based entity. The other options are not mentioned as key factors in its growth.

The text states: ""N'elekere 11:20, ndị uwe ojii gwara ndị ngagharị iwe ahụ ka ha laghachi azụ n'elu ụzọ ebe ndị ji ụkwụ na-aga...""  And later ""...Ihe dị ka mgbe oge jiri nkeji iri abụọ na itolu gafee elekere iri na otu, ngahari mkpesa ahụ gbagoro Whitehall...""

This means the police instructed the protesters to move back *around* 11:20, but the protest itself continued until approximately 11:29. The protest spread across multiple roads, preventing them from starting. Therefore, the police instructed the protestors to move back *around* 11:29, which is when the protest began spreading.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Dr. Ur's research was early in its development and showed promise in a small group of obese individuals with type 1 diabetes.** It specifically mentions they *didn't* get better, but the research *did* show a potential effect. 
* **Option A aligns with this:** It acknowledges the research involved individuals with a history of Type 1 diabetes.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage states the results had *no* impact on those with Type 1 diabetes.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The passage explicitly states the research *didn't* show a cure.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The passage doesn't mention a link between pre-existing health conditions and developing Type 1 diabetes.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that accurately reflects information provided in the passage.



"

Here's why:

The passage states that Dr. Ur cautioned that the initial research findings **did not show a cure** for Type 1 diabetes. The question asks what Dr. Ur had reservations about.  His caution implies a skepticism or doubt about the potential for a cure.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọ bụrụ na nsonaazụ ya na-adabara ndị nwere ụdị ọrịa shuga 1:** While this is *a* detail of his caution, the core of his reservation isn't specifically about the results fitting Type 1. It's about the results *not* indicating a cure.
* **C: echiche ndị ọkachamara dị iche iche na ọgwụgwọ:** Dr. Ur isn't expressing a reservation about differing expert opinions; he's expressing a reservation about the research results themselves.
* **D: Ọ bụrụ na ụmụ oke na-enweghị ọrịa shuga ga-anọ otu ahụ:** This is irrelevant to Dr. Ur's concerns about a cure.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ejima Otter ahụ anwagidela ifeda ala na Kokoda ụnyaahụ dị ka Ndị ụgbọ elu PNG Flight CG4684...okeji iri tupu oge a kara n'ọga erute site n'ọbịbịa nke abụọ ya o fesasịa."" This implies the plane had multiple attempts to land before the final crash.
* **Option C directly reflects this:** ""Ụgbọelu ahụ gbalịlị ike ya ịdà ugboro atọ tupu ọ kụjasịa.""
* **Why other options are less accurate:**
    * **A: Ụgbọelu ahụ na mbụ o nweghị ike idà n’ihi ihuigwe:** While weather contributed, the passage focuses on the attempts to land *before* the crash, not just the initial inability to land.
    * **B: Ụgbọelụ ahụ kụjara n’ime ọhịa dị anya:** The passage says the plane crashed *in* the jungle, but doesn't specify how visible it was.
    * **D: Ọchịchọ maka nkụjasị saịtị ụgbọelu nwetere ọdachi sitere n’ihuigwe:** The passage mentions weather contributed to the search effort, but doesn't state the search *started* because of the weather.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate description of the sudden events leading up to the plane crash based on the provided text."
Gịnị na-akpata ihe mberede Ụgbọelu CG4684 iji gbochie ọdịda ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọnọdụ ihuigwe ahụ adịghị mma**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Otu ihu igwe ọjọọ nke kpatara ọdịda nlotu ahụ gbochikwara ọchịchọ ahụ."" This translates to ""One bad weather front caused the plane to crash.""  Therefore, the bad weather is what led to the crash.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ebendobe ọdịda ya ekweghị nnweta** - The passage doesn't mention any failure of the anti-stall system.
* **B: E nwere ọtụtụ ụgbọelu ndịọzọ bụ ụzọ nọ n’elu tupu nke CG4684** -  The passage doesn't mention other aircraft being present.
* **C: E nyere ụgbọelu ahụ ụzọ gara na Kokoda** - The passage doesn't say the plane was given a route to Kokoda.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ okwu banyere ahụmiihe Franciszek Kowal’s bụ eziokwu?","The correct answer is **B: O nweghị ihe mere ya**.

The passage states: ""Isi awele m mere onweghi ihe mere m..."" which translates to ""I had nothing to do with it..."" This directly indicates that Franciszek Kowal claims he didn't cause the situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: O jikwara ịkọwa mpio:** While he's describing the event, the core of his statement is about *his* lack of involvement.
* **C: Ọ kọwara oche ebe ọ na-agba mbọ ịpụ:**  The passage mentions people being disgusted, but Kowal's statement focuses on his own lack of responsibility.
* **D: O merụrụ ahụ ebe ọ na-anwà ịkụwa mpio:** The passage doesn't suggest he suffered or was in pain.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of Kowal's statement.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndị ọka mmụta sayensị na n'ụlọ nyocha ajọ ikuku nke obodo ekwuola na oke ikuku Daniel ga aghọ ajọ ikuku na ụbọchị Wenezde. Dị ka oké mmiri ozuzo ahụ ka toro aka site n’imetụ n’ala, ọ ka na-ara ahụ inyocha etu o nwere ike isi metụta United States ma ọ bụ Caribbean.""

This indicates that scientists are *monitoring* the storm's track (ajọ ikuku mmiri) to predict its potential impact. The difficulty isn't in *seeing* the storm, but in *predicting* its future path.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ndị ọkachamara nke sayensi enweghị ime banyere ajọọ ikuku mmiri:** The passage explicitly states they *are* monitoring it.
*   **C: Aka nọ ebe dị anya ịdà:** This is irrelevant to the difficulty in predicting the storm's path.
*   **D: A hụrụ ajọọ ikuku mmiri ahụ ebe dị anya site na Miami:** The passage says it was sighted *near* Miami, not that it's easily visible throughout its track. The difficulty is in predicting where it will go.

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ndị ọka mmụta sayensị na ụlọ nyocha ajọ ikuku nke obodo ekwuola na oke ikuku Daniel ga aghọ ajọ ikuku na ụbọchị Wenezde. Dị ka oké mmiri ozuzo ahụ ka toro aka site n’imetụ n’ala, ọ ka na-ara ahụ inyocha etu o nwere ike isi metụta United States **ma ọ bụ Caribbean**."" This shows the potential for impact on the Caribbean.

* **The passage confirms:** ""akpụọla n’ime ebe ọwụwa anyanwụ Oke osimiri Atlantik"" and ""di ebe 3,000miles na Miami, Florida."" This verifies it formed in the Atlantic Ocean.

* **The passage states:** ""ọ ka na-ara ahụ inyocha etu o nwere ike isi metụta United States **ma ọ bụ Caribbean**."" This directly confirms the possibility of it becoming a hurricane.

* **The passage states:** ""Dị ka oké mmiri ozuzo ahụ ka toro aka site n’imetụ n’ala, **ọ ka na-ara ahụ inyocha etu o nwere ike isi metụta United States ma ọ bụ Caribbean.**"" This confirms it is approaching land.

Therefore, the statement that the storm *won't* impact the Caribbean directly contradicts the information provided in the text.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, atụmatụ enyere ga-eme ya na ọrịa ahụ tupu o zuo mba ụwa ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ ga-adị ala karịa lethal** (It will be less lethal).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""nchọpụta ụfọdụ na-akọwa na ọrịa ahụ agaghị enwecha ike ibute ọnwụ tupu o bute ntiwapụ ọrịa n'ụwa dum."" This implies that the virus *might* be less deadly in its initial stages.  The concern is not about the lethality *at the beginning*, but the potential for it to become more lethal as it spreads.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Njirimara ya ga-adịlịlịlị nwa-obere** (Its characteristics will be milder): The passage doesn't say anything about the virus's characteristics being milder.
* **C: Ọtụtụ ndị mmadụ ga-enweta ya** (Many people will get it): The passage mentions children getting it without severe illness, but doesn't predict widespread infection.
* **D: Ụmụaka ga-enweta ahụmiihe njirimara** (Children will experience characteristic symptoms): While children *are* getting the illness, the passage doesn't focus on the symptoms they experience.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, o tere anya i si na Fujian bụ ajọọ oke ifufe?","The correct answer is **B: 11 kilomita**.

The passage states: ""anya oke ikuku Mọrakọt fọrọ kilomita iri asaa ka o ruo mpaghara Chaịna a na-akpọ Fujian. Ezubere oke ikuku ahụ ji ọsọ n'ogugo 11kph agbaje ụzọ Chaịna."" 

This translates to: ""The Mrakot hurricane traveled seventeen thousand kilometers before reaching the Chinese region called Fujian. The hurricane was expected to travel at an average speed of 11kph along China's route.""

The question asks how far the hurricane traveled *before* reaching Fujian, which is stated as 17,000 kilometers. However, the question also asks ""how far is it from Fujian to reach..."" and the answer to that is the average speed, which is 11 kph. Therefore, the question is indirectly asking about the average speed.  The average speed is 11 km/h, meaning the hurricane traveled 11 kilometers *per hour* along the route.  The question is slightly worded poorly, but the best answer amongst those given is 11 kilomita because it reflects the speed mentioned in the passage.

* **The passage states:** ""...narị atọ a gbakwunyere ọzọ na-eweta mkpokọta ya ruo ụgbọ ibu otu puku na narị atọ a ga-enweta iji belata oke njupụta."" This clearly indicates that the government is acquiring 1,300 vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tinyere ọtụtụ ego n’ụgbọala gasị site na Marchị nke afọ a:** While the passage mentions government spending, it's about the *acquisition* of vehicles, not just the spending itself.
* **B: Nwetara mkpokọta ọtụtụ ụgbọala 300:** The passage states 1,300, not 300.
* **D: Wepụrụ mbelata nke ụgbọala gasị:** The passage discusses acquiring vehicles, not removing them.



"
Kedụ ihe gọvernmenti na-ekwu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha na-atụ alọ ikwado ụgbọala 1,300 ọzọ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...narị atọ a gbakwunyere ọzọ na-eweta mkpokọta ya ruo ụgbọ ibu otu puku na narị atọ a ga-enweta iji belata oke njupụta.""
* **This means:** 300 + 1000 = 1300
* **The government is expecting support for a total of 1300 vehicles.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha na-atụ alọ ikwado ụgbọala 300 ọzọ:** This is only half of the total mentioned in the passage.
* **B: Ha siri ọnwụ iji belata nsogbu ụgbọala ahụ:** The passage doesn't say the government is offering money; it says they are expecting support.
* **D: Aga-emezi nsogbu ndị ahụ jupụtara na Marchị:** The passage says the government *will obtain* the vehicles in March, not *fix* the problems.



"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ozi ama ama?","The correct answer is **D: Amamiihe nke nkwadoeziokwu ka e mere na ndakpo ga-adị njọ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Enweghị ihe ọmụma na-atụ aka na a ga-enwe mwakpo mgbe na-adịghị anya. Kama mweda nke ogugo iyi egwu ruo ogugo siri ike apụtaghị na ihe iyi egwu nile agaala.""

* **Translation:** ""There is no pretense that there will be an attack when you least expect it. Instead of the noise of boasting, which is difficult to stifle, all the boasts have disappeared.""

* **Interpretation:** The passage is saying that the warnings and boasts of security have vanished, implying a high likelihood of a surprise attack. The phrase ""Amamiihe nke nkwadoeziokwu ka e mere na ndakpo ga-adị njọ"" (The pretense of security that was made regarding the defense will be disastrous) best captures this sentiment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ogo iheegwu ebèlatala (The curtain has fallen on the drama):** While there's a sense of impending doom, this option doesn't directly address the security aspect.
* **B: Enweghịzi ihe egwu ọbụla (There is no fear at all):** The passage explicitly states the opposite – there *is* fear, but it's been masked by boasts.
* **C: Atụrụ anya inwe ndakpo n’ike (Expecting to have strong defense):** The passage is dismantling the *expectation* of strong defense, stating it's been broken.



"
Kedụ nkwupụta banyere ngagharị iwe ahụ na abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ntụnyeaka gaferenu butere ngagharị iwe ahụ**.

Here's why:

*   The passage explicitly states that the new CEP (a new electoral commission) was Martelly's response to the widespread protests that began in October. It links the protests to the blocked comprehensive governance that was happening at the time.
*   The passage mentions that the protests have occurred sporadically since 2011, and are often triggered by election-related issues. 
*   The passage *doesn't* state that the Gaferenu transitional government *caused* the protests. It implies the protests were related to the blocked comprehensive governance, which likely involved the government.
*   The other options are directly supported by the text.

Therefore, option B is the statement that is *not* accurate according to the passage.



"
Onye tụpụtara alò arụkwaghị m CEP ikpeazụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Kọmmishọn onyeisi ala**.

The text states: ""N'ọnwa gara aga ozi sitere n'onye ọchịchị kwadoro ọgbụgba arụkwaghịm CEP nọbu anọ dịka ihe so n'usoro omume ihe ibuje obodo na ntuli aka ọhụrụ Ntinye ọrụ ahụ bụ azịza Martelly maka ngagharị iwe nke mgbochi ọchịchị zuru ebele bidoro na Ọktoba.""

This indicates the government (represented by the presidency/head of state) supported the new CEP.  While the CEP itself is a council, the decision to hold the *new* CEP was made by the government. Therefore, the presidency/head of state (implied by ""onye ọchịchị"") would have supported and effectively overseen its implementation. ""Kọmmishọn onyeisi ala"" (Presidential Commission) is the most accurate way to describe the body responsible.

"Dịka nkwupụta ahụ siri dị, nke ndị Egwuregwu USA na akwadoghị site n’agwa mkparị ndị ọsọ Nassar?","The correct answer is **D: Nnyocha nnwereonwe**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mpaghara jimnasktik nke obodo USA kwadoro nlebara anya nke onwe nke nwere ike igosi ka mmegbu nke ndị lanarịrị ihe mberede Larị Nassar kọwapụtara nwere ike ịbụ ihe metere aka a na-amaghị maka ya na anabatakwa mgbanwe ndị kwesịrị ekwesị."" This indicates support for independent investigations.

The passage also mentions the USOC and gymnastics USA share a common goal: to promote gymnastics. It suggests that other organizations might have had a lack of courage to address the issue directly.

Therefore, the passage implies support for **independent investigations** to uncover the truth and prevent future abuses. The other options (removal of perpetrators, relocating facilities, internal changes within the organization) are possible consequences *of* an investigation, but the passage directly supports the investigation itself.

This indicates their primary goal is to maintain a safe and supportive environment for gymnasts, promoting the sport's integrity and well-being. Options A, B, and C are not the central focus of the statement.
"

The passage explicitly states: ""Avenger class mine na emesho ugbommiri, ugbommiri ahu n’aga Puerto Princessa na Palawan."" This translates to ""The Avenger class mine destroyer is going to Puerto Princessa and Palawan.""
"
Kedụ nke n’ime ndị a bụ eziokwu banyere ụgbọ mmiri akpọrọaha na paseeji ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụ n’ụzọ gara na Puerto Princesa**.

Therefore, the ship is traveling *to* Puerto Princesa.

While the harsh ground contributed to the difficulty, the location *in the mountains* is the primary reason mentioned for the challenge of the site. The other options (lightning, poor terrain) are not directly supported by the text.

Kedu ihe ndị isi na-atụ anya ka iju mmiri ahụ mezuo?,"The correct answer is **C: Mmụba nke ọnụ ọgụgụ humpback chubs**.

The passage states: ""Agbanyeghi na larịị mmiri ahụ ga-eto elu ụkwụ ole na ole naanị mgbe idei mmiri ahụ gasịrị, ndị isi na-enwe olile anya na ọ ga-ezu iji weghachi ụmụ ugwu aja nke mmiri riri na ndịda ụzọ mmiri."" This directly translates to ""Although the water level will rise a little only when the water level drops, the authorities hope it will return the humpback chub population to the southern reaches of the river.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Aja aja na-arụzi:** The passage mentions the sediment is important for spawning, but doesn't directly state that the authorities expect the water level rise to *cause* spawning.
*   **B: Ewu nke osimiri:** The passage doesn't mention river otters or their population.
*   **D: ụlọ ọzọ maka anụ ọhịa:** While the river is a habitat for animals, the passage specifically focuses on the humpback chub population returning.



"
Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a ka mmepụta mmiri ahụ gbanwere kpamkpam?,"The correct answer is **D: Mgbasa nke ájá (Sedimentation of sand)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that sedimentation (the deposition of sediment) was crucial for creating gravel beds used by salmon and as riverbed habitat for animals. However, it also mentions that the river's water level eventually dropped, hindering the salmon's return. 

Therefore, the *change* that dramatically altered the river is the **sedimentation (ụdị azụ abụọ ekpochapụla, ma abụọ ndị ọzọ abụrụla ndị nọ n’ihe ize ndụ, gụnyere humpback chub, and the eventual drop in water level)** that impacted the salmon's ability to reproduce. The other options are consequences or aspects *related to* the sedimentation, but not the fundamental *change* in the river itself.

"Onye nyere United States ozi gbasara mwakpo enwere ike, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Ebe amatabeghị**.

The text states: ""U.S sị na o nwetara ozi site n'aka onye ozi a na amaghị kwuru kpọmkwem..."" This means the source of the information is unknown.
"
Kedu n'ime ndị a kacha chịkọta atụmatụ mbuso agha nke ndị na-eme ihe ike?,"The correct answer is **B: A na-atụnye ihe mgbawa na mba abụọ.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ndi-mmeru-nisi sitere na mba Somalia"" (Somali militants) are planning to use ""ogbunigwe"" (explosives) to attack in Kenya and Ethiopia. It also mentions intelligence suggests they plan to use suicide bombers to create a ""akara ngosi ala pụtara ihe"" (a symbolic ground marker/impact) in both Ethiopia and Kenya.

Option B directly reflects this: ""A na-atụnye ihe mgbawa na mba abụọ"" (Explosives are being planned in two countries). The other options are less comprehensive:

*   **A: ịtụ bọmbụ isi ebe n'otu mba** (Placing a bomb in one place in one country) - This only addresses one country, not both.
*   **C: Ihe mgbawa ga-apụ na akara ala abụọ dị iche iche** (The explosives will detonate at two different ground markers) - While the passage mentions symbolic impact, it doesn't specify different ground markers.
*   **D: bọmbụ ga-agbapụ n'otu mba** (The bomb will detonate in one country) - This only addresses one country, not both.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate representation of the planned attack scenario described in the passage."
Kedu onye n'ime ndị edepụtara na-abụghị onye ọka iwu?,"The correct answer is **A: Petros Mantouvalos**.

Here's why:

* **Sakis Kechagioglou and George Nikolakopoulos** are explicitly stated to be lawyers who were imprisoned.
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is identified as a lawyer and a commentator on the show ""Zoungla.""
* **Evangelos Kalousis** is identified as a prominent lawyer involved in the bribery case.
* **Petros Mantouvalos** is described as a businessman who was implicated in illegal activities and corruption, but not as a lawyer.



"
Kedụ ndị mmadụ ndị ana-akpọghị aha ma ha so na ihe arụ a hụrụ n’ime iwu obodo Greek?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị atoni**.

The text explicitly states: ""...na ndị solositọ na ndị atoni mere n'afọ ndị gara aga.""  This indicates that lawyers ( ndị atoni) were involved in the illegal activities alongside judges and prosecutors.
"
Ụzọ ole furu site n’aka ndị India?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**

The passage states: ""...India naanị mere 36 gbara ọ tọpụ wicket **7** iji kwụsị innings.""
"
"Gịnị bụ akara kacha elu nke innings, dabere na ngafe ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: 70 na-agba ọsọ**.

The passage states: ""Robin Uthappa nwetara akara kacha elu na innings, ọsọ 70 n’ime naanị ụmụ bọọlụ 41..."" This directly tells us that Robin Uthappa's highest score in the innings was 70.
"
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-adịghị etinye aka na iwe Adam Cuerden?,"The correct answer is **C: Wales anaghị ege ha ntị**.

Here's why:

The text clearly states that the anger stemmed from:

*   The initial claim that the removal was a legal matter.
*   The public perception/image being damaged.
*   The lack of transparency in the removal process.

Option C, ""Wales anaghị ege ha ntị,"" is **the opposite** of what the text implies. The text emphasizes that people *were* paying attention and angered by the situation. The other options directly relate to the reasons for the anger."
"Kedu ihe ewepụrụ na webụsaịtị ahụ, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Ihe ngosi mmekọahụ (Reports of meetings)**.

The text states: ""Mkpadu iwe obodo butere maka mgbali ide iwu gbasara ihe ngosi mmekọahụ na webụsaịtị na-egosi ọtụtụ ihe."" This translates to: ""The community council raised concerns about the legal implications of reporting meetings on a website that shows a lot of things.""

Therefore, the thing that was removed based on the text is reports of meetings.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-akwadoghị, n'echiche Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **A: Olimpik kwesịrị inwe ndị inyom na-alụ ọgụ**.

Here's why:

* **Amir Khan explicitly stated he believes women shouldn't box.** This directly contradicts the idea that the Olympics *should* include women's boxing.
* The passage highlights his personal belief that women are not suited for boxing. 
* Options B, C, and D are irrelevant to Khan's stated opinion on women boxing.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a Amir Khan ga-akwado dabere na akụkụ ahụ, n'agbanyeghị mmasị ya?","The correct answer is **C: Egwuregwu Olympic 2012**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Agbanyeghị ihe ndị o kwuburu, ọ sị na ọ ga-akwado ndị egwuregwu Briten na 2012 Olimpiks a na-eme na Lọndọn.""  This means he will support the 2012 Olympics regardless of his views on women boxing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ndị inyom ndị agha:** The passage doesn't mention female soldiers.
* **B: Ndị na-eme egwuregwu Olympic si 2004 bụ ndị ọ na-asọmpi megide:** While he competed against athletes from 2004, the passage focuses on his support for the 2012 Olympics.
* **D: Ndị mmeri ọlaọcha agbakwunyere:**  His Olympic gold medal in 2004 doesn't dictate who he will support in the future. He can support athletes even if he doesn't agree with all aspects of their sport.



"
Kedu afọ Peter Lenz nwụrụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Na-esochi mkpọka igwe kwụ otu ebe**.

The passage states: ""Peter Lenz, a 23-year-old race car driver, died after being struck by a car during a race at Indianapolis Motor Speedway."" It also says he died ""after being struck by a car during a race"". This means he died *during* the race, specifically after a collision.
"
kọwaa Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọsọ agbakwụnye (Racing partner)**.

The passage states: ""...a kụrụ ya site n’aka onye ọgba ọsọ ibe ya Xavier Zayat."" This means Xavier Zayat was Peter Lenz's racing partner.
"
Ọnọdụ ndị dị aṅaa ga-eme ka ọ dị mkpa ka onye njem ụjọ ghọta otú ụgbọ elu si arụ ọrụ?,"The best answer is **A: Ọ buru na onye-ije nēwe iwe n'ihi egwu-ha.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** The passage connects fear of flying to fear of the unknown and lack of control. It says understanding how a plane works can alleviate that fear.
* **Option A directly aligns with this:** If a passenger is fearful *because* they are scared, then understanding the mechanics of the plane would be particularly helpful in reducing that fear.
* **Why the other options are less suitable:**
    * **B: Ọ bụrụ na mmadụ enweghị mmasị n'ife ofufe sitere na nchegbu na-amaghị ama:** While the passage mentions fear of the unknown, it doesn't say a lack of interest in the ""romance"" of flying is the primary concern.
    * **C: Mgbe ụdị ụgbọ njem anaghị amasị onye njem:**  A passenger's dislike of the plane model isn't directly related to the root fear of flying discussed in the passage.
    * **D: ọ bụrụ na egwu ha na-efe efe bụ ihe na-awụ akpata oyi n'ahụ:** While physical symptoms of fear are real, the passage focuses on the psychological aspect of fear stemming from the unknown, not just the physical manifestation.

Therefore, option A is the most logical and directly supported answer based on the provided text.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states the importance of comparing prices from different airlines and travel agencies.** Option C directly reflects this advice.
* **Option A is related but less comprehensive.**  It mentions looking at different offers, but doesn't specifically emphasize comparing across *multiple* airlines.
* **Option B is the opposite of what the passage recommends.** The passage advises *against* booking immediately without comparison.
* **Option D is too general.** While you *can* go to airline websites, the passage emphasizes comparing across *multiple* sources, not just one.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate and helpful advice based on the information provided in the passage.

"Kedu ihe ndị ọbịa kwesịrị ibu ụzọ mee, dabere na paragraf, iji nweta azụmahịa ụgbọ elu kacha mma?","The correct answer is **B: Ekwesịrị iji tụnyere ọnụ ahịa nchịkọta ihe dị iche iche.**

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""...it will benefit you if you analyze these prices and also look at the airlines themselves before buying a ticket."" This directly supports the idea of comparing prices from different aggregators.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Gaa na webụsaịtị ụgbọ elu:** While checking airline websites is a good idea, the paragraph emphasizes comparing prices *across* different sources, not just one.
*   **C: Zụrụ tiketi ozugbo site n'ụgbọelu:** The paragraph warns against buying immediately without comparing.
*   **D: Mee ndoputa ozugbo site na onye ọrụ njem:** This is not mentioned or implied in the paragraph. The paragraph emphasizes independent price comparison.



"
Kedu mgbe onye agbakwunyere dị mkpa maka nnyefe?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe ọ bụla a na-ebufe ihe site na ibu ikuku.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Iwu ụlọọrụ ụgbọelu agaghị ekwe ha izipụ ibu na-enweghị otu onye njem..."" This means a carrier (the person transporting the goods) is *always* required for shipments involving bulky items.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ozugbo azụmahịa na-eji ụgbọ elu nke ya:** The text mentions some larger companies have their own planes, but this isn't a universal requirement for *all* shipments.
* **C: Ọ bụrụ na ezipụ ihe ọ bụla dị ka akpa enyochara:** While a package might be small, the core issue is the ""ibu ikuku"" (bulky size).  A small, bulky item still requires a carrier.
* **D: Mgbe nnukwu nzukọ na-ahụ maka nnyefe:**  The text doesn't connect shipment requirements with conferences or meetings.

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""Ị kwesịrị ịmara na ikike a na-enye na-adịkarị iche ma ebe ndị a na-agakarị nwere ike imesapụkwụ aka n’okpuru ụgbọ elu n’otu nkwekọrịta ahụ."" This means the *carrier/operator* of the airline has a significant role in determining the terms and conditions of the agreement, including the selection of airlines.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ụgbọ elu nke njikọ aka kacha ukwuu:** While the number of connections is important, the paragraph highlights the operator's influence on the agreement itself.
* **C: ụgbọ elu nke ị na-ejikarị efe efe:**  Your personal preferences are less relevant to the contractual aspects being discussed.
* **D: Enwere ike inye uru ndị ka mma bụ ụgbọ elu:**  While better airlines might offer a better experience, the paragraph's focus is on the contractual power of the airline operator.



Therefore, understanding *who* is operating the airline and their potential to influence the agreement is the most critical factor.



"
"Kedu onye nwere ike inye ọtụtụ kilomita efegharị ugboro ugboro, dabere n'ofe ahụ?","The best answer is **B: Iji otu njikọ ahụ, ụgbọ elu gị na-emekarị njem.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ị kwesịrị ịkpachapụ anya ịhọrọ ndị ụgbọ elu ị Na-esonyekarị Efe Mgbe Niile n'otu njikọ aka."" This implies that using one link (connection) allows for frequent flights.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ụgbọ elu dị iche na mmekorita dị iche:**  While different airlines and connections exist, the passage focuses on using *one* connection repeatedly.
* **C: Njikọ dị iche iche na-akwado ụgbọ elu gị kacha eme njem:** The question is about *how* the flights are happening, not which connection is best for frequent flying.
* **D: Onye na-ebu ọzọ n'ime otu njikọ ahụ:** This is irrelevant to the number of kilometers flown.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate reflection of the passage's meaning."
"Kedu n'ime mmetụta ndị a nwere ike imerụ ahụ site n'ịṅụbiga mmanya ókè, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ike ịnụ (Vision)**.

The passage states: ""Ụfọdụ mmanya ike ndị megidere iwu nwere ike nwee ọtụtụ ihe adịghị mma n'ime ha na-agụnye metanọl, nke nwere ike ịkpata ikpu ìsì ma ọ bụ ọnwụ n'ime nha ndị dị obere."" (Some illegal drugs contain harmful substances like methanol, which can cause blindness and even death.)

Therefore, the passage explicitly mentions blindness as a potential effect of consuming strong drugs. The other options are not mentioned in the passage.
"
"Gịnị nwere ike ibelata mmetụta ọjọọ nke mmanya na-aba n'anya, bụ́ nke a kpọtụrụ aha n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Na-agwakọta mmanya na methanol**.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Na-aṅụ mmanya e mere n'ụzọ iwu na-akwadoghị:** While illegal alcohol is mentioned, the specific harmful substance is methanol, not just the fact that it's illegal.
*   **C: Nkezi mmanya na-aba n'anya:** The passage doesn't discuss average alcohol consumption.
*   **D: Na-aṅụ mmanya na ndị dị iche iche:** The passage doesn't mention the variety of people who drink.



"
Kedu mpaghara Amsterdam nwere ụfọdụ ụkpụrụ ihe onwunwe kachasị elu?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpaghara nke Canal**. 

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the ""Mpaghara Kanal (Dọch: Grachtengordel)"" is known for having the highest real estate prices in Amsterdam. 
* Option B is true, but it doesn't directly answer the question about the *area* with the highest property values.
* Options C and D are not mentioned as the areas with the highest property values in the passage.



"
Kedu ka mpaghara Canal si bụrụ na UNESCO mara ya dị ka saịtị ihe nketa ụwa?,"The best answer is **A: Mkpa akụkọ ihe mere eme na omenala ya.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""UNESCO edetuola aha mpaghara niile a dịka Ebe Nketa Ụwa maka uru ọ bara nye omenala na akụkọ ụwa..."" This directly links the UNESCO designation to the historical and cultural importance of the canals.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: O nwere àgwà pụrụ iche:** While true, this is too general. The text specifies *what* makes the canals unique – their historical and cultural significance.
* **C: gburugburu ya, nke gụnyere Binnenstad:** The surrounding area is a factor, but the *primary* reason for the UNESCO designation is the canals themselves and what they represent.
* **D: Ihe onwunwe ahụ dị oke ọnụ:**  The high property values are a consequence of the area's desirability, not the direct reason for the UNESCO designation.  The designation is about cultural heritage, not economic value.



Therefore, option A most accurately reflects the reason given in the text for the UNESCO World Heritage status."
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a, dị ka paragraf ahụ, kwadoro njem na Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **A: Nyocha nke Tonle Sap**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that Phnom Krom is located on a hill overlooking **Tonle Sap Lake** and that King Yasovarman built the temple there to observe the lake. This directly supports the idea that the area is significant for observing and potentially studying Tonle Sap.
* While the other options are mentioned, they are not the *primary* point the paragraph emphasizes as a reason to visit Phnom Krom. The focus is on the lake view and the historical context related to it.
* ""Na-agafe Angkor Pass"" is related to visiting Angkor Wat, not Phnom Krom itself.
* ""Gaa na Siem Reap"" is just the location of Phnom Krom, not a reason to visit *it*.
* ""Iji ụgbọ mmiri na-eleta ọdọ mmiri ahụ"" is a logistical detail about getting to Phnom Krom, not a reason to visit.



"
"Kedu ihe dị mkpa maka ndị njem ịbanye Phnom Krom, dịka akụkụ nke akwụkwọ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **C: Nweta Angkor Pass**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ngafe Angkọ bụ ebe a ga agaferịrị ịbanye ebe ofufe n'ihi nke a echefukwala iweta akwụkwọ akwụkwọ ngafe gị ma ị na-aga Tonle Sap."" This translates to ""Angkor Pass is where you must go to enter the temple, so do not forget to bring your pass if you are going to Tonle Sap.""  Therefore, you need an Angkor Pass to visit Phnom Krom.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mgbe ụlọ nsọ Yasovarman gasịrị, na-arịgo:** While the text mentions King Yasovarman, it doesn't say this is *necessary* for entry. It's historical context.
* **B: Njegharị Siem Reap:**  While you'll likely travel to Siem Reap, the question is specifically about what's *needed to enter Phnom Krom*.
* **D: Ikwọ ụgbọ mmiri n'akụkụ Tonle Sap:** The text says you can take a boat trip on Tonle Sap *without* a pass. It's the pass that's important for entering the temple itself.

"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike igbochi onye njem nleta ịga Antarctica, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Na-emefu nnukwu ego na njem (Expensive travel)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Nleta nke ndị njem nleta dị oké ọnụ..."" which translates to ""Tourist visits are very expensive...""  This is a direct barrier to visiting Antarctica.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Otu ọchịchọ inyocha Oké Osimiri Ross (A desire to explore the Ross Sea):** While exploring the Ross Sea is a reason to go to Antarctica, it doesn't *block* travel.
* **C: Nhazi ọrụ nke na-enye ohere njem na Disemba na Jenụwarị (Organized tours that offer opportunities to travel in December and January):** The passage says visits are only possible during those months, but this isn't a *barrier* to travel; it's a *condition* for travel.
* **D: Enweghị ike ịgagharị gburugburu (It is impossible to travel around):** The passage mentions ""Ime Obodo Antarctica...maka ihe omume iri elu ugwu ma ọ bụ ịgarute na Polu..."" (Antarctic inland...for high-altitude events or reaching the Pole...), indicating travel *is* possible, just challenging.



"
Kedu mpaghara Antarctica nke onye njem nlegharị anya nwere ike ịga leta?,"The correct answer is **B: Mpaghara ime obodo**.

Here's why:

* The text specifically states that tourists are restricted to the Peninsula, Islands, and Ross Ice Shelf, which are all part of the interior region (""ime obodo"") of Antarctica.
* While some excursions reach the South Pole (which is in the interior), the initial restrictions are focused on the Peninsula, Islands, and Ross Ice Shelf.
* The other options are not explicitly mentioned as accessible to tourists:
    * **A: Mmiri nnu (Sea ice)**: While ice is mentioned, the text focuses on land-based travel.
    * **C: Okpu (Summit)**:  While excursions reach the South Pole (a summit), the general accessibility of the *interior* is focused on the Peninsula, Islands, and Ross Ice Shelf.
    * **D: Ala ya (Its land)**: This is too general. The text specifies *which* part of the land tourists can access.



"
Ebee ka opekata mpe na a ga-achọta ebe nleba anya nke oge a?,"The correct answer is **A: N'ebe a na-erute ngwa ngwa (Easily accessible places)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that old observatories are now repurposed as museums and educational facilities, and that modern telescopes are located in large, remote observatories with excellent optics. It also mentions that the modern observatories are easier to reach than the old ones. Therefore, the place where you'd likely find modern telescopes is in easily accessible locations.
"
Ebee ka teliskop nyocha nke oge a nwere ike ịnọ?,"The correct answer is **D: N'ime nnukwu ụlọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Otutu teliskop eji eme resaach n'oge ugbu a bu nnukwu ulo oru di n'ebe dipuru adipu nwere ezigbo ihu igwe.""  This translates to: ""The telescopes used for research now are large buildings located in remote places with excellent optics.""

Option D, ""N'ime nnukwu ụlọ"" (In large buildings), is the closest and most accurate representation of this information. While a planetarium *could* house a telescope, the passage emphasizes the telescope being *in* a large building, not specifically within a planetarium.  The other options are less supported by the text:

*   **A: Na ụlọ ngosi nka (In a museum):** Museums can house telescopes, but the passage doesn't specify this as the primary location.
*   **B: N'ụlọ akwụkwọ kọleji (In a college building):** While a telescope *could* be in a college, the passage emphasizes the remote location.
*   **C: Na webụsaịtị maka agụmakwụkwọ (On a website for education):** Telescopes aren't typically ""on a website.""



"
"Kedu ebe ga-adị mma maka ụbọchị osimiri dị jụụ, dabere na ebe ahụ?","The best answer is **A: St Heliers**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ụmụ akụkụ mmiri Tamaki Drive nọ n’Ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri Waitemata ahụ, n’ime ahịa ndị bara ụba nọ mpaghara ebe obibi nke **Mission Bay na St Heliers** n’ime Central Auckland.""  This indicates that St Heliers is a popular location for waterfront activities and is near shops, suggesting a good place to spend a sunny day.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ozi bay:** The text doesn't mention Ozi Bay.
* **C: Mpaghara nke North Harbor:**  While North Harbor is mentioned as a general area, it's not a specific location recommended for a sunny day.
* **D: Ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri na Waitemata:** This is a general area (Waitemata Harbour) and not a specific place within it.



Therefore, **St Heliers** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

The passage states: ""Ụmụ akụkụ mmiri Ugwu (nọ na mpaghara Ugwu Ebe ndote ụgbọ mmiri) nọ n’oke osimiri Pacifik ma dọtịa site na Long Bay nọ n’ugwu ruo **Devonport** nọ na ndịda."" It also mentions that they are ""fọrọ obere ka ha bụrụchaa akụkụ mmiri aja aja ya na igwu mmiri echedoro echedo."" This implies Devonport is at the southernmost point and likely the most sheltered of the mentioned locations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mpaghara North Harbor:** The passage doesn't explicitly say the North Harbor is particularly sheltered.
*   **C: Ogbe ndịda Auckland:** This is too general. Devonport is a specific location within the southern part of Auckland.
*   **D: Oke osimiri sara mbara:** The passage states the waterways are in the Pacific Ocean and are relatively sheltered due to the surrounding land. ""Oke osimiri sara mbara"" (stormy seas) is the opposite of what the text describes.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka a ga-eche na ọ dịghị mma mgbe ị na-aga n'ebe ahụ a kpọtụrụ aha n'amaokwu ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Na-etinye akara n'ebe dị nso na saịtị ahụ**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states the website was created through vandalism (""ise akara maọbụ ịkanye grafiti n'ime ihe ndi owuwu"").  Therefore, adding more graffiti to the site would be perpetuating the same harmful act.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ịdị oké njọ:** While the site's origins are tragic, simply feeling sad or reflecting on the event isn't inherently wrong.
* **C: na-agwa njakịrị:**  There's no indication in the passage that speaking loudly is inappropriate.
* **D: Ịkpụcha ụlọ:**  This is a severe act of violence and destruction, and while terrible, the passage focuses on the vandalism *of the website itself*, not destruction of property.



"
Kedu nke kacha mma na-achịkọta asụsụ?,"The best answer is **C: Ewuru**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks how the language is best described.** The passage states sign languages are ""languages of the hands"" and ""popularly created for the purpose of facilitating communication between those with speech difficulties.""  The word ""popularly created"" implies a sense of being developed or invented within a community, rather than being formal or standardized.  ""Ewuru"" (which translates to ""popular"" or ""vernacular"") best captures this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: ekepụtara** (spoken):  Sign languages are *not* spoken languages.
* **B: Pụrụ iche** (specialized): While sign languages are specialized in their purpose, ""ewuru"" better describes their origin and development.
* **D: eke** (correct/accurate): While the definition of sign language in the passage is accurate, ""ewuru"" describes *how* it came to be, not its accuracy.



Therefore, **C: Ewuru** is the most fitting description based on the provided text.



"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a bụ ụgha gbasara asụsụ inyeaka?,"The correct answer is **D: N'etiti ndị na-asụ asụsụ dị iche iche, a na-emepụta ha dị ka asụsụ ndị na-achị achị.**

Here's why:

* **The definition of sign languages in the prompt states:** They are native sign languages or emerged languages created for communication between deaf individuals.
* **Option D aligns with this definition:** Sign languages naturally arise and become dominant communication methods *within* a community of deaf people who may not share a common spoken language. They aren't typically intended as a universal language for communication *between* deaf and hearing people (that's where interpreters come in).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha bụ asụsụ okike nke a na-eji kwalite nzikọrịta ozi n'etiti ndị nwere ike ọ gaghị enwe ike ịme ya:** This is incorrect. Sign languages are *visual* languages, not auditory ones.
* **B: Ha bụ asụsụ ndị a na-eme n'okike na asụsụ ndị e kere eke:** While sign languages *can* be created deliberately, the prompt emphasizes that many are *native* sign languages – meaning they develop organically within a community. 
* **C: Emepụtara ha dị ka asụsụ iji kwado ọnọdụ nkwurịta okwu siri ike karị:**  Sign languages aren't *created* to overcome difficult communication situations in general. They *emerge* as a solution for communication among a specific group (deaf people) who have a particular communication need.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate description of sign languages based on the information given.



"
"What should a passenger verify if their voyage is in the winter, per the passage?","The correct answer is **B: Ihe achọrọ Visa**.

The passage states: ""Njem nnyagharị nke Senti Piitasbọg gụnyere oge n'ime obodo. **Ndi njem nke njem nnyagharị bụ ndị ewezụgara site n'ụmụ ihe ndị achọrọ maka visa (lelee usoro ahụ).**""

This translates to: ""The ferry journey to Saint Petersburg includes time in the city. **The ferry journeys are led by people who need a visa (check the procedure).**""

Therefore, a passenger should verify visa requirements.
"
"Kedu ihe onye njem nwere ike ịzere na njem ụgbọ mmiri n'oge okpomọkụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **A: Oge n'ime obodo**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Njem nnyagharị nke Senti Piitasbọg gụnyere oge n'ime obodo.""  This directly translates to ""The ferry route to Saint Petersburg includes time within the city.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: ịnyagharị ice** - While ice is a feature of the Baltic Sea in winter, it's not related to avoiding *during the summer* ferry trip.
* **C: Ihe achọrọ Visa** - The text mentions visa requirements for ferry travelers, but it doesn't suggest avoiding them on a summer trip.
* **D: Saint Petersburg** - Saint Petersburg is the destination; the question asks what the traveler can *avoid* related to the trip.

Kedu ihe kpatara akara na ọkwa na Catalan ji jupụta na Barcelona?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ bụ asụsụ mbụ e nwere n’obodo ahụ (It is the original language of the city).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ụmụ isi asụsụ nke Baselona bụ Katalan na Spanish."" (The native languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish.)
* It further explains that Catalan was ""eguzosiri ya ike n’iwu dika asusu nke bu nke obodo"" (strongly promoted as the language of the city).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: E jiri ya tụnyere Spanish, a na-aghọtakarị ya (Compared to Spanish, it is often understood):** While true, this doesn't explain *why* Catalan is so prominent.
* **C: Na Barcelona, a na-asụkarị ya (It is commonly spoken in Barcelona):** The passage mentions Catalan is spoken in public transport, but it doesn't explain the underlying reason for its prominence.
* **D: Ọtụtụ ndị na-eji Metro na ebe ọha ndị ọzọ na-asụ Catalan (Many people use the Metro and other public places speaking Catalan):** This is a factual statement from the passage, but it doesn't explain the *cause* of Catalan's prominence.

Therefore, the most accurate explanation is that Catalan is the original language of Barcelona and has been actively promoted as such.



"
A na-eme mkpọsa ugboro ugboro nke sistemu Metro Barcelona n'ime asụsụ ndị a?,"The correct answer is **A: Bekee**.

The passage states: ""The platform announcements in the Metro are only in Catalan, but the system is designed to be multilingual through a non-manual system supporting many different languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic and Japanese."" This indicates that English is one of the languages used for announcements.
"
Kedu n'ime ihe eji enyere ndụ aka na-agaghị abụ ihe kacha mkpa maka akwa akwa na nri ụtụtụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Wi-Fi ọsọ ọsọ**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes a focus on **traditional, high-quality elements** for a luxury B&B breakfast experience.  It mentions:

*   ""ndina na akwa nke ndi-ukwu na nri-ututu ka eweliri ruo ihe di na udi-nka"" (fresh ingredients and traditional food)
*   ""ihe eji achọ ihe ndina kachasi nma, ọ nwere ike bụrụ nke ejiri aka mee ma ọ bụ ihe ndina ochie"" (seeking the best quality ingredients, perhaps handmade or aged)
*   ""nri ụtụtụ nwere ike ịgụnye nri ụtọ n'oge nke mpaghara ahụ ma ọ nwere ike bụrụ nri pụrụ iche nke onye nnabata"" (breakfast might include local specialties or personalized dishes)
*   ""Ụmụ ntinye ihe ime ụlọ nke mgbe ochie, ala awụrụmaziri nke ọma na otu ebe igwu mmiri"" (historic bathrooms, well-laid floors, and a bathing area)

**Wi-Fi** is a modern convenience, but it doesn't align with the passage's focus on traditional, high-quality, and personalized experiences. The other options (specialty antique furniture, well-maintained ambiance, and well-preserved appearance) all fit the described atmosphere.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị akụkụ dị mkpa nke asọmpi n'etiti B&Bs dị elu, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ akụkọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Nhazi nke oge a**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of:

* **Quality bedding and towels:**  Mentioned as a key differentiator.
* **Unique breakfast offerings:** Highlighting local cuisine and special dishes.
* **Atmosphere and ambiance:** Described with details like historic buildings, gardens, and pools.

While breakfast options (B) and the quality of towels/bedding (C) and the inclusion of local food (D) are all important factors in a luxury B&B's success, the passage doesn't specifically mention the **timing/scheduling** of the B&B experience as a core element of competition.  The focus is on the *quality* and *uniqueness* of the elements described, not necessarily *when* they are experienced.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe omume ndị a, dịka ekwuru na paragraf, agaghị eme na Beijing na 2022?","The correct answer is **B: Ihe omume na ebe ntụrụndụ Taizicheng ski**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the opening and closing ceremonies will be held in Beijing, and the ice events will be held in indoor venues.
* It also says that the other events will be held at the Taizicheng National Ski Jumping Stadium in Zhangjiakou, which is 220 km from Beijing. 
* Therefore, the ski events are **not** taking place in Beijing.



"
"Kedu n'ime mmemme ndị a ka Beijing ga-anabata na 2022, dị ka ekwuru n'akụkụ a?","The correct answer is **C: Egwuregwu oyi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Beijing ga-eme mmemme mmeghe na mmechi ya na ihe omume ais nke ime ụlọ."" (Beijing will hold its opening and closing ceremonies with indoor ice events.) and ""Ihe omume igba-igwe mmiri ndi ozo ga adi na ogbe igwe mmiri Taizicheng di na Zhangjiakou, dị ka ekwuru n'akụkụ a."" (Other water sports will be held at the Taizicheng Ice and Snow Stadium in Zhangjiakou, about 220 km (140 miles) from Beijing.)  This indicates that Beijing will host **ice and snow events**, which fall under the umbrella of winter sports.

While the opening and closing ceremonies are mentioned, the question asks about *events* Beijing will host.  The text doesn't specifically say it will host Summer Olympic events. Therefore, option C is the best fit.
"
Kedu onye nwere ike ibute influenza avian?,"The correct answer is **C: ndị ọrụ ọkụkọ (Poultry workers)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Ndị ka n'ọnụ ọgụgụ etinyela ndị ọrụ ọkụkọ n'ọrụ..."" which translates to ""The number of those who have been put to work are poultry workers..."" This indicates that poultry workers are at higher risk.

While the other options might be exposed, the text doesn't specifically say they are *more* susceptible.  The focus is on poultry workers being involved in the outbreak response.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the information provided.
"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a kacha chịkọta flu avian dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?,"The correct answer is **C: Ihe ize ndụ nke ibute ọrịa dị maka ndị na-ekiri nnụnụ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Akpabatabeghị ikpe okwu fọrọ obere ghara eru otu puku n’ụmụ mmadụ, mana ụfọdụ n’ime ha anwụọla. Ndị ka n'ọnụ ọgụgụ etinyela ndị ọrụ ọzụzụ ọkụkọ n'ọrụ, mana obere ihe ize ndụ dịịrị ndị na eledo nnụnụ anya.""

* **This means:** The risk of infection to humans is relatively low, but those who work with or are around birds (like poultry workers or people who care for birds) *do* face a higher risk of contracting the disease.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọrịa flu bụ naanị ndị ọrụ ọkụkọ.** - The passage explicitly says it *can* affect humans, not just poultry workers.
* **B: N'iji ya tụnyere nnụnụ, e depụtala ụmụ mmadụ ọtụtụ ihe atụ** - The passage states the opposite - very few cases have been reported in humans.
* **D: Enwere naanị ihe na-egbu egbu na akụkọ mmadụ** - The passage mentions some human deaths, but also notes that the number of cases is low.



"
Ọwa mmiri na-acha ọcha-Baltic na-ejikọta ihe na ihe?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọdọ Mmiri Onega na Osimiri Volga**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ejikọkwara Ọdọ mmiri Onega na Volga, ya mere ịbịa site na Oke osimiri gafee Rọshịa ka kwekwara omume."" This directly translates to ""The Onega Lake is also connected to the Volga River, which made it possible to travel across Russia by sea.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Oké Osimiri Ojii na Oké Osimiri Caspian:** While the Vikings used waterways to reach these seas, the passage focuses on the connection between Onega and Volga.
*   **C: Oké Osimiri Polar na Oké Osimiri Baltic:** The passage mentions the Arctic and Baltic Seas, but specifically details the connection through Onega and Ladoga.
*   **D: Southern Ocean and Red Sea:** This is not mentioned in the passage.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...onye nhazi ụgbọ nwere ike ịnara gị akwụkwọ ikike ime njem gị ka a ghara inye gị nsogbu ka ị na-arahụ ụra."" ( ""...the flight attendant can give you a permission to fly so that you will not have problems while you are sleeping."")  This implies the pilot is the one who would provide the permission/documentation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ụgbọ elu (Airplane):**  While airplanes are a mode of transport, the passage is specifically about obtaining permission for *sleeping* during a flight, not the type of aircraft.
* **C: Ụgbọ mmiri (Ship):** The passage mentions ships, but the question is about obtaining permission to *sleep* during a flight.
* **D: njem ụgbọ oloko oke ala (Heavy-duty cargo ship):**  This is irrelevant to obtaining permission for sleeping during a flight.

"Kedu mgbe enwere ike ịlele ID gị na ụgbọ oloko ndị na-agafe agafe, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: N'oge ụra gị**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""N’ufodu ugbo oloko n’agafe mba di iche iche ana enyocha ha mgbe ha na gbaa, **ọ bu na ikwesiri ijide njirimara bara uru mgbe iga abanye otu n’imeugbo oloko ahu.** N'ụgbọoloko abalị a na-arahụ ụra na ya, onye nhazi ụgbọ nwere ike ịnara gị akwụkwọ ikike ime njem gị ka a ghara inye gị nsogbu ka ị na-arahụ ụra.""

This translates to: ""Usually, passengers are checked when they board a train traveling between different countries, **so it is advisable to keep valuable belongings when entering the train.** On a later train, the conductor may ask to see your ticket to avoid problems while you are sleeping.""

This implies that ID checks happen *during* your sleep (ụra gị).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mgbe ịpụsịrị ụgbọ oloko** - ID checks happen *before* you board, not after.
*   **C: Enweghị nyocha** - The passage explicitly states checks happen.
*   **D: N'oge ụgbọ oloko na-akpụ akpụ** - While the train might be moving, the passage connects ID checks with sleeping, not just movement.



"
"Mgbe ị na-aga na oke okpomọkụ nke Singapore, olee nsogbu ndị a nwere ike ime?","The correct answer is **C: ike ọgwụgwụ n'ihi okpomọkụ**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the dangers of the extreme heat in Singapore. It specifically mentions:

* **"" ị na-edobe gị n'ime """"ebe ndị na-ekpo oke ọkụ""""...anwụ siri ike (mgbe elu igwe kpochara ekpocha, nke kara raa ahụ omume).""** This strongly implies heatstroke is a significant risk.
* **"" ị ga-achọ naanị digiri ole na ole n'ugwu nke ikwuetọ imeso ma ekpomọkụ (mgbe niile)...""** This refers to the body struggling to cope with the heat and potentially overheating.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Izu gị ohi:** While dehydration is a concern in hot weather, the passage focuses more on the *extreme* heat and its impact on the body's core functions.
* **B: Enweghi ụlọahịa ruru aka:** The passage doesn't mention lack of medical assistance as a primary concern related to the heat.
* **D: Na-efunahụ ntụziaka:** The passage doesn't indicate heat causing confusion.

Therefore, heatstroke/loss of strength due to heat is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Kedu onye ga-achọ ịnọpụ na pastries German?,"The best answer is **B: onye na-amasị decadent emeso**.

Here's why:

* The text describes German pastries as rich, often filled with nuts and fruit, and enjoyed with strong coffee. These are all characteristics of decadent desserts – indulgent and rich.
* Options A, C, and D are less directly supported by the text. While some pastries *might* contain chocolate or be eaten with chocolate, the text emphasizes the overall richness and nuttiness. The mention of ""utọ nātọ utọ utọ"" is a bit vague and doesn't quite capture the essence of the pastries as described.

Therefore, ""onye na-amasị decadent emeso"" is the most fitting description of someone who would enjoy German pastries based on the information given.
"
Kedu akụkụ nke pastries German na-ewere dị ka ihe na-eme n'oge?,"The correct answer is **A: Apụl**.

The passage states: ""A na-ahụkarị ụmụ achịcha mkpụrụ osisi, **ejikwa apụl eme achịcha mgbe niile n'afọ**."" (Fruit pastries are common, and apples are always used to make pastries throughout the year.)

While the passage mentions plums, hazelnuts, and almonds, it specifically highlights apples as a pastry ingredient used year-round.

Here's why:

The passage focuses on ways to travel cheaply. Option D describes a standard, relatively expensive way to travel – paying for hotels and restaurants like a typical tourist. The passage specifically advocates for strategies to *reduce* costs, not maintain them.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Mgbe ị na-eme njem, chọọ ọrụ pụrụ iche iji rụchaa (Seek unique work while traveling):** This aligns with the passage's advice to earn money while traveling.
* **B: Dị njikere ịgbanwe ogo nkasi obi gị (Be ready to change your mindset):** This connects to the passage's emphasis on being flexible and open to unconventional travel methods.
* **C: Rịọ ego n'aka ndị ọzọ (Ask for money from others):** This is directly mentioned as a strategy for funding low-cost travel.



"
"Kedu onye nwere ike ịgbalị ime njem na mmefu ego siri ike, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: onye na-ahụ ihe ịma aka (someone who is resourceful)**.

The passage describes people who are willing to take risks, be flexible, and find creative ways to travel cheaply. These are characteristics of someone who is resourceful and can ""see opportunities.""

Here's why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: onye na-adịghị mmachi oge (someone who is not short on time):** While being flexible with time can help, the passage emphasizes financial constraints as the primary challenge.
* **C: Onye bu n'obi na-arụ ọrụ remotely ka ọ nọ n'ụzọ (someone who is secretly working remotely while traveling):** This is a specific tactic mentioned in the passage, but not a general characteristic of everyone traveling cheaply.
* **D: Onye na-ahụ n'anya ịhazi usoro ihe omume ha (someone who meticulously plans their itinerary):** The passage suggests that rigid planning isn't ideal for budget travel; flexibility is key.

Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara njem n'etiti Point Marion na Fairmont bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **D: O kwesịghị ịbụ nsogbu iji ekwentị.**

Here's why: The text explicitly states: ""Na mmata ihe, n'agbanyeghị, ọrụ ekwentị mkpààgagharị ka dị ike ebe a karịa ọtụtụ ogologo ụzọ ndị ọzọ ahụ, dịka ọmụmaatụ Ọhịa Pennsylvania ahụ."" This means using a cell phone *is* a potential problem or at least noteworthy, not that it *shouldn't* be a problem.

Let's look at why the other options *are* true according to the text:

*   **A: Ogologo okporo ụzọ ime obodo ndị zoro ezo dị:** The text mentions ""uzo n’akpode akpode, uzo di wara wara na nkuku nko juru eju,"" describing a long and winding route.
*   **B: Ụzọ dị warara:** The text specifically states ""Ụzọ dị warara"".
*   **C: Ọ na-adịkarịghị agbaso mmachi ọsọ:** The text says, ""Ọ na-abụkarịghị agbaso mmachi ọsọ...n nrubeisi siri ike na ha kara dị mkpa karịa otu ọzọ.""

Therefore, only option D is contradicted by the text."
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kwesịrị ịbụ ihe kacha mkpa maka ndị ọkwọ ụgbọ ala n'okporo ụzọ Buffalo-Pittsburgh, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Na-eme ngwa ngwa, ntụgharị dị nkọ (Making quick, sharp turns)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the following dangers on the Point Marion to Fairmont road:

* **Limited visibility:** Due to winding roads and dense forest.
* **Narrow lanes:** Less space than other roads.
* **Moderate speed (35-40 mph):**  Still a concern given the other dangers.
* **Frequent need to brake:**  Highlights the hazardous conditions.

All of this points to the need for drivers to be prepared for sudden maneuvers.  Quick, sharp turns would be especially dangerous given the limited visibility and narrow lanes.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na-eme ka okporo ụzọ kwụsịlata (Causing the road to stop):** While stopping might be *necessary* at times, the passage doesn't highlight the road stopping as a primary danger.
* **B: Mkpuchi ekwentị ezughi oke (Phone covers not being excessive):**  The passage says cell service is strong, so phone covers are irrelevant to the road conditions.
* **D: Owuwu okporo ụzọ ugboro ugboro (Repeated road intersections):** The passage mentions winding roads and dense forest as the main visibility issues.  Frequent intersections aren't explicitly mentioned as a critical danger.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-agaghị eme tupu ịmalite ịkwọ ụgbọ mmiri?,"The correct answer is **B: Ahụike kacha mma** (Best health).

Here's why:

* **The question is about diving.** Diving, especially in underwater caves, is a physically demanding activity with inherent risks. 
* **""Ahụike kacha mma"" (Best health) is a crucial prerequisite for diving.** You need to be in excellent physical and mental condition to safely handle the pressures, potential currents, and confined spaces involved. 
* **The other options are less critical prerequisites:**
    * **Inwe ike igwu mmiri (Swimming ability):**  While highly beneficial, swimming ability can be developed.  Scuba diving provides buoyancy.
    * **Ike ima elu (Good physical fitness):**  Physical fitness helps, but not necessarily to the extreme degree that ""best health"" does.
    * **Obere ntụziaka (Little instruction):**  Proper instruction is *essential*, not a pre-existing condition.  You need training before diving.

Therefore, ""best health"" is the most fundamental and important condition before attempting to dive, especially in the context of cave diving, which is particularly risky.



"
"Maka njem nlegharị anya nke ọma, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka a ga-achọ?","The correct answer is **C: Nzere ntozu na canyoneering** (Rappelling and canyoneering).

Here's why:

* **The question asks about equipment needed for a *canyoneering* trip.** The definition of canyoneering in the prompt explicitly states it involves navigating canyons, which often requires rappelling (descending rock faces) and other specialized techniques.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Inwe ikike egwuregwu dị elu (Having high swimming skills):** While swimming is often involved, it's not the *primary* equipment requirement.  Canyoneering involves navigating various terrain, not just swimming.
* **B: Maka njem nlegharị anya nke ọma, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka a ga-achọ (For a good excursion, which of these things are needed):** This is a restatement of the question and doesn't provide an answer.
* **D: Ikike igwu mmiri (Swimming skills):** Similar to A, swimming is a component, but not the defining equipment need.

Therefore, **C: Nzere ntozu na canyoneering** is the most accurate and relevant answer, because it directly addresses the activities involved in canyoneering.

"Kedu ihe ga-abara onye ọ bụla na-ejikere ịkwa ụlọikwuu n'ụgbọala ha, dị ka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Imara oke ụgbọ ala gị nke ọma**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that knowing your vehicle's dimensions is crucial for easily parking it in tight spaces. The phrase ""Ị makwaara ebe ike ya ruru"" (You know its reach) directly refers to understanding the length and dimensions of the vehicle. The passage also mentions ""njem nnọgharị"" (maneuverability), which is tied to knowing the vehicle's size.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ugbọ ala nke nwere oche mpịachi** (A vehicle with a retractable chassis): While a retractable chassis *could* help with parking, the passage doesn't specifically state this as a requirement. The core idea is understanding dimensions, not just having a special feature.
* **C: Ụlọ ntu** (A garage): A garage is a place to *store* the vehicle, not a requirement for parking it.
* **D: Ebe maa ụlọikwuu na ala nkeonwe** (A place where you can park a house): This is completely irrelevant to the passage's topic.



"
"Kedu ihe ndị na-ama ụlọikwuu ga-achọ izere ma ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ ka a ghara ịhụ ha, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Inya ụgbọ ala ma ọ bụ ụgbọ ala buru ibu, dị ka SUV ma ọ bụ minivan.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""N'adịghị ka nnukwu ụgbọ ndị ọzọ, ịnya ụgbọ ala gị nwere ike ọ maala gị ahụ..."" and then goes on to explain that smaller cars are easier to spot. This implies that larger vehicles (like SUVs and minivans) are *more likely* to be seen if someone wants to avoid detection.

The other options are not directly supported by the text:

*   **B:** This is a repetition of the question.
*   **C:** While hiding a house is a general security measure, the passage focuses specifically on the visibility of the *car*.
*   **D:** The passage *does* mention the importance of knowing how to make the car ""dip low"" to avoid being seen, so this isn't accurate.

The text states: ""Ndị Pọtụgaalụ bibiri ya ma rụgharịa ya n’okpuru aha Casa Branca..."" which translates to ""The Portuguese conquered it and renamed it Casa Branca..."" This indicates the Portuguese were the ones who conquered and renamed Casablanca.
"
"Mgbe ọdachi dakwasịrị, ònye hapụrụ Casablanca ka ọ dị taa?","The correct answer is **B: Na Portugal**.

The passage states: ""Ndị Pọtụgaalụ bibiri ya ma rụgharịa ya n’okpuru aha Casa Branca, naanị ịgbahapụ ya mgbe otu ala ọma jijiji mechara n’ime 1755."" This means the Portuguese took control of Casablanca and renamed it Casa Branca, and then abandoned it after the earthquake.
"
"Kedu ka Sintra siri bụrụ ihe ama ama na ndị njem nlegharị anya si mba ofesi, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Ezi reviews nke Lord Byron**.

The passage states that Sintra became famous to tourists because of ""amara-amara nye ndi mba-ozo ka akowaputara idi-ukwu ya n’uzo egbuke-egbuke site na-aka Onye-nwe Byro."" This directly translates to ""reputation given to foreign people through the widely spread praises by Lord Byron.""
"
Kedu ihe Armenia anaghị anabata?,"The correct answer is **A: Mpaghara Nagorno-Karabakh**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that despite Armenian support and international involvement (including from the US), Nagorno-Karabakh did *not* establish its own independent state. 
* The passage explicitly mentions that neither Armenia nor Azerbaijan recognized it as an independent state.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Esemokwu na ndị Azeris:** The passage doesn't say Armenia didn't provide information or have issues with Azeris. The conflict was about territorial disputes.
* **C: Arụmụka na mgbakwasị ụkwụ diplomatic si Azerbaijan:** The passage mentions the conflict disrupted diplomatic relations, but doesn't state Armenia *didn't* engage in diplomacy.
* **D: Na mba ọhụrụ:** The passage clearly states Nagorno-Karabakh *did not* become a new country.



"
Kedu ihe ka na-emetụta mmekọrịta Azerbaijan na Armenia?,"The correct answer is **D: Mpaghara nke Nagorno-Karabakh.**

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states:** ""N'afọ 1994, ndị Negorno-Karabakh, ndị agbụrụ ha si mba Amenịa, buru agha megide ndị Azebaịjan."" This establishes the conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakh region as the root cause.
* **The passage also mentions:**  ""...arụmụka ọchịchị obodo ka na emebi mmekọ Amenia na Azabaịjan.""  This indicates that the dispute over Nagorno-Karabakh is directly impacting the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndị bi na Azerbaijan bụ ndị Armenia:** This is incorrect. Azerbaijan is primarily populated by Azerbaijanis.  While there are Armenian minorities in Azerbaijan, the statement is factually wrong and doesn't explain the conflict.
* **B: Esemokwu nke 1994:** While the conflict began in 1994, the *reason* for the conflict wasn't the specific year. The year is a marker of *when* the conflict escalated, not the underlying issue.
* **C: Arụmụka mkparita uka:**  While political structures might *result* from conflicts, the conflict itself is driven by the territorial dispute.

Therefore, the Nagorno-Karabakh region is the central issue influencing the relationship between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

Kedu ihe nwere ike ịkpata ego ọzọ mgbe ị na-enweta taksi na Charlotte?,"The provided text discusses why families choose to move to Charlotte, North Carolina, focusing on good schools and a family-friendly environment. It also mentions that the cost of living has increased, including the cost of adding a second bedroom.

The question, however, is about what could cause extra charges when taking a taxi in Charlotte. **None of the answer choices are related to the text about families moving to Charlotte.** They seem completely unrelated.

Therefore, based *solely* on the information provided in the text, none of the answers are correct. However, if we assume the question is a distractor and not related to the provided text, we need to select the most plausible answer *without any context from the text.*

**Without further context or information, it's impossible to definitively choose the ""correct"" answer.** The question is nonsensical in relation to the text. 

However, if forced to choose, **B: inwe mmadụ atọ mụ na ya nọ** is slightly more plausible. Taxi companies often charge extra for larger parties. However, this is just an assumption and relies on general knowledge, not on the provided text.

**Therefore, I cannot confidently select a correct answer.** The question is disconnected from the text.
"
"Kedu ihe a ga-ele anya dị ka ihe ndọghachi azụ nke ịzụ ụmụaka na Charlotte, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **A: Ugwọ ụlọ (Housing Costs)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ezinụlọ ndị bi na Chalọt anaghị aba tagzi, kama n'ọnọdụ dị añaa ha nwere ike jiri ha mee ihe. Enwere ụgwọ mgbakwunye dịịrị ibukarị ndị nje abụọ, ya mere nhọrọ nke a nwere ike ịdị ọnụ karịa ka okwesiri."" This translates to: ""Families living in Charlotte don't hesitate, instead they can use them. There are additional costs to include two dogs, which makes this choice potentially more expensive than it should be.""

This directly points to housing costs being a significant factor. The passage implies that the cost of housing in Charlotte, especially with the ability to have pets, is a consideration for families moving there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Iji ụgbọ ala (Using Public Transportation):** The passage doesn't mention public transportation as a factor.
*   **C: Ndị si mpaghara ndị ọzọ (People from Other Areas):** While the passage talks about people moving to Charlotte, it doesn't focus on *them* being a factor in raising children.
*   **D: Achọ ịbata n'ime obodo (Desire to Move into the City):** The passage doesn't talk about wanting to move into the city, it's about the costs associated with living *in* Charlotte.



"
Onye chịrị mpaghara ugwu Chile tupu ndị Spen abịarute?,"The correct answer is **D: Incas**.

The passage states: ""Tupu ndị Spen abịarute na narị afọ iri na isii, ebe ugwu Chile nọ n’okpuru ọchịchị Inca..."" This directly answers the question.

While the Mapuche were important later, the Inca were in power *before* the Spanish arrived.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-emeghị na 1810, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Chileke chịriri ndị Spen**.

Here's why:

The text states that Chile declared independence in 1810, *during* the Napoleonic Wars which had weakened Spanish authority. It also says they *didn't* achieve a decisive victory against the Spanish until 1818. Therefore, Chile did *not* defeat the Spanish in 1810.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ nweghị ọchịchị etiti nwere:** The text states that Spain did not have a central government in 1810 due to the Napoleonic Wars.
*   **C: A lụrụ agha n'oge ọchịchị Napoleon:** The text explicitly states that the independence declaration in 1810 happened *during* the Napoleonic Wars.
*   **D: A kpọsaara otu Chileke:** The text doesn't mention any specific leader being appointed in 1810.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* supported by the text is that Chile defeated the Spanish in 1810.

Kedu ka obodo ndị dị anya na Liguria si enweta ndị njem?,"The correct answer is **B: Iji ụgbọ ala ma ọ bụ ụgbọ oloko**.

"""Gịnị ka okwu Italian bụ """"Cinque Terre"""" pụtara?""","The correct answer is **A: Obodo ise**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sinque Terre, nke pụtara Ala Ise"" and then clarifies ""Obodo ndị nọ n'ụsọ oke osimiri bụ Riomaggiore, Manarola, Kọniglia, Venaza and Monteroso"" - meaning the five towns are called Cinque Terre. ""Cinque"" means five, and ""Terre"" means lands or towns. Therefore, it translates to ""Five Lands"" or more naturally, ""Five Towns.""

"Kedu ụdị akpụkpọ ụkwụ, dị ka ederede, kwesịrị ekwesị maka ọnọdụ oyi na-adịghị mma?","The correct answer is **A: Akpụkpọ ụkwụ nwere obere ikiri ụkwụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Nhazi ya kwesịrị imi emi ọfụma, 5 mm (1/5 inchi) maọbụ karia, nakwa akwa ya aghaghị idi nro ọfụma n'oge oyi."" This means the sock should have a low profile (small height) and not be too fluffy.  Option A, ""Akpụkpọ ụkwụ nwere obere ikiri ụkwụ"" aligns with this requirement.  The other options contradict the passage's advice about low profile and avoiding fluffiness.



"
Kedu n'ime ndị a na-agaghị enye aka n'ịkwalite njide n'okporo ụzọ na-amị amị n'oge oyi?,"The correct answer is **D: Mmiri**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that salt (sodium chloride) and sand are commonly used to improve traction on icy roads.** This means salt, sand, and grit all help prevent slipping.
* **Water, conversely, would make the ice *worse* by creating a slippery surface.** Adding water to ice increases its slipperiness.

Therefore, water would *not* contribute to improved traction and would actually hinder it.
"
Kedu nkwupụta gbasara myirịta Hawaii na Cook Islands bụ eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ha nọ na mpaghara oge yiri nke ahụ.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Ha no n’otu oge ka Hawaii...ya mere na oge ufodu ana eche maka agwaetiti ndi a ka ha bu “Hawaii gbadara n’okpuru”."" This implies a similar time zone.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ha abụọ nwere ọnụ ọgụgụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ:** The text explicitly says the Cook Islands *don't* have large hotels and development like Hawaii. This suggests fewer hotels and resorts.
* **B: O nweghị ọchịchị dịịrị otu n'ime ha:** The text states the Cook Islands *became* an independent nation. This clearly indicates they *do* have a government.
* **D: Enweghị obodo maka nke ọ bụla n'ime ha:** The text says the Cook Islands are made up of 15 *different* islands, and the major ones are Rarotonga and Aitutaki. This means they *do* have towns.



"
Kedu otu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara Cook Islands?,"The correct answer is **B: Ọ bụ otu agwaetiti (It is one island)**.

The passage clearly states: ""Agwaetiti Osi nri ndị ahụ enweghị obodo ọ bụla mana ọ bụ agwaetiti dị iche iche iri na ise mejupụtara ya."" (The Cook Islands do not have any cities but are made up of fifteen different islands.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: O pere mpe karịa Hawaii (It is farther than Hawaii)** - The passage says they are in the central South Pacific, like Hawaii, and were once called ""Solid Hawaii under the sea,"" implying a similar location.
*   **C: Rarotonga na Aitutaki bụ isi obodo (Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the main cities)** - The passage explicitly states this.
*   **D: Ọ bụ n'otu oge mpaghara obodo agwaetiti Hawaii (It was once the time zone of the Hawaiian island group)** - The passage mentions they are similar to Hawaii and used to be called ""Solid Hawaii under the sea,"" implying a similar history.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information in the provided text.
"
Kedu n'ime ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ndị a na-enye ụdị ebe obibi abụọ dị iche iche?,"The correct answer is **A: Siren**. 

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sirena bụ sọ ụlọ nchekwa ọhịa na-enye ndị njem ebe ọnụnọ ma nri."" (Sirena is a forest shelter that offers travelers lodging and food.)

The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Ndị ọbọgwụ (La Leona, San Pedrilo, na Lọs Patos)** are mentioned as offering lodging *without* food.
* **C: Onye Leona (La Leona)** is mentioned as offering lodging *without* food.
* **D: Na San Pedrillo (San Pedrilo)** is mentioned as offering lodging *without* food.

Therefore, Sirena is the only option listed as providing *both* lodging *and* food.

Here's why:

The text states: ""A ga-enwetali ikike idọsa moto n'aka Renja Steshọn na Puerto Jimenez, ma ị gaghị ejili kredit kad akwụ ha ụgwéu."" This means you get the permit at Renja Station in Puerto Jimenez, and you pay cash, not with a credit card. Therefore, you would store the park permit in Puerto Jimenez.
"
"Kedu ụdị ski a na-eme na mbara ala dị steepụ, dịka ọ dị na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Ejiji Alpine**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Alpine skiing** as involving steep slopes and requiring strong ski skills. 
* **Alpine skiing** is specifically designed for downhill skiing on groomed slopes.
* The other options don't fit the description:
    * **Ski na ije ije:**  Suggests a slower, more casual pace, not steep slopes.
    * **Skiing n'ime ime obodo:** Implies a flat, controlled environment.
    * **Ski mgbe ị na-azụ azụ:**  This is not a recognized type of skiing.



"
"Kedu ihe nwere ike inyere ndị na-agba ọsọ azụ azụ aka na-achọ ime ngwa ngwa karịa, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Egwu rhythmic**.

Here's why:

The passage describes ski touring as a strenuous activity requiring good physical condition. It compares it to long-distance hiking, but emphasizes the need for strength and endurance. The question asks how to help people with back problems to move faster.

* **Egwu rhythmic (Rhythmic movement):**  This refers to a coordinated, flowing movement pattern.  A rhythmic approach to skiing would allow for more efficient use of muscles, reducing strain on the back.  Good technique and rhythm are key to minimizing injury and maximizing endurance in any physically demanding activity, including skiing.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **Oke akpụkpọ ụkwụ (Large backpack):** A large backpack would *increase* strain on the back, not decrease it.
* **Nnukwu akpa nke ngwa (Large equipment bag):** Similar to the backpack, a large equipment bag adds weight and puts stress on the back.
* **Ezi ọnọdụ (Good condition):** While good physical condition is *necessary*, the question asks about ways to move *faster* specifically for people with back problems.  Good condition is a baseline, not a solution to moving faster *with a back issue*.

Therefore, **Rhythmic movement** is the most logical and helpful answer for someone with back problems trying to ski faster.



"
Kedu ihe na-esiri ndị njem na-enwe ujo nbanye ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ịmara omenala ebe ọhụrụ ahụ**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ndị njem ndị nwere oge dị mfe ịnọgharị n’omenala ọhụrụ mgbe ụfọdụ na-enwe oge siri ike ịnọgharịkwa n’omenala keobodo ha."" This highlights the importance of understanding the new culture for a smoother transition.
* **The passage further explains:** When returning home, travelers have a deep understanding of the new culture but also carry some aspects of their home culture.  This implies the knowledge of the new culture is key.
* **The passage also points out:**  People in the host country might have expectations about travelers not having resentment or negativity upon returning. This suggests a positive experience is linked to adapting to and understanding the new culture.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Njikere ichere na inwe ọmịiko:** While resilience is helpful, the passage focuses more on cultural understanding than on being prepared for hardship.
* **C: Njem mba ofesi:**  This is a general term and not directly related to why travelers return with a renewed sense of purpose.
* **D: Na-alaghachi n'ọdịbendị ha si malite:** The passage indicates that upon returning home, travelers bring *some* aspects of the new culture with them, not simply returning to their old ways.



"
"Kedu ụdị njem nlegharị anya nwere ike nweta ujo nbanye ọzọ n'ike karịa, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The best answer is **B: Ndị na-eme njem ma biri ná mba ọzọ wee mee mgbanwe ngwa ngwa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the difficulty of readjusting to one's home culture after extended travel.** It specifically mentions the contrast between adapting to a new culture and returning home.
* **Option B directly addresses this point.** People who have lived in another country and quickly adapted to the new culture are likely to have a smoother readjustment to their home culture. Their experience in the new culture provides them with valuable perspective and potentially helps them appreciate aspects of their home culture they might have overlooked.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ndị njem nwere oke ujo omenala siri ike:** While strong cultural sensitivity is generally positive, the passage focuses on *readjustment*, not necessarily the initial experience of cultural sensitivity.
* **C: Ndị njem na-ahapụbeghị ezumike ezumike ha:** This is irrelevant to the issue of readjustment.
* **D: Ndị njem na-enweghị ndidi:** Lack of diplomacy would likely *hinder* readjustment, not improve it.

**Therefore, option B is the most logically sound answer based on the provided passage.**"
Kedu ihe ndị mmadụ kwesịrị izere ime anụ ọhịa?,"The correct answer is **C: Na-eweda mmerụ ahụ nwere ike ime ha (Don't make them feel threatened)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that moose don't actively seek out fights, but will defend themselves if they see a threat. Humans, not initially perceived as a threat, can get too close and put themselves in a dangerous situation.  The key is to *avoid* making the moose feel threatened.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Enweghị ọnụnọ ha (Don't be present)** - This is impossible if you're trying to observe or be in an area where moose live.
* **B: M na-eji nwayọọ na-arịgo (Walk slowly)** - Slow walking might help, but it doesn't address the core issue of avoiding perceived threats.
* **D: Site n'ebe dị anya na-ahụ ha (Keep a distance)** - While keeping a distance is good, the passage implies that even at a distance, *making* the moose feel threatened is a problem.

Therefore, avoiding actions that could cause a moose to feel threatened is the most important point.
"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara moose na-akwadoghị?,"The answer is **A: Ha bụ ndị e kere eke na-emegide ibe ha (They are inherently enemies)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that moose don't have a specific ""warrior instinct"" but will defend themselves if they see a threat.** It doesn't say they are inherently enemies of each other. The passage focuses on their individual defensive behavior.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **B: Mgbe ụfọdụ ndị mmadụ anaghị ahụ ha dị ka ihe iyi egwu nwere ike ime (Sometimes people don't see them as a threat, which can lead them closer than they should):**  The passage directly supports this – people are more likely to approach moose if they don't perceive them as dangerous.
* **C: Onye ọ bụla nọ nso nwere ike ịtọlite ha (Anyone nearby can startle them):** The passage implies this by saying moose will ""check"" to see what they are encountering and will defend themselves. Being startled is a likely trigger for defense.
* **D: Ọ bụrụ na ọ dị mkpa, ha ga-echebe onwe ha (If necessary, they will defend themselves):** This is the core message of the passage – moose will defend themselves when threatened.



Therefore, option A is the statement that doesn't align with the passage's content."
"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a ga-adị ntakịrị ihe ize ndụ maka onye na-awagharị n'ọzara, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Iji mmiri eme ihe n'ụzọ na-adịghị arụ ọrụ iji chụọ ube.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** "" ndị njem gaa chụwa ihe efu a, ya na mmiri fọrọ afọ."" This means that focusing on a mirage of water and trying to get to it is dangerous because it's an illusion.  Wasting energy on this futile effort is a significant threat.
* **Hypothermia is a major risk:** The passage highlights that hypothermia is deadly without proper clothing. Wasting energy on a mirage increases the risk of becoming exhausted and therefore more vulnerable to hypothermia.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **A: Abalị na-enweghị ezuru ọkụ gia:**  While a cold morning is a risk, it's not as immediately dangerous as wasting energy on a mirage.  The passage focuses on the danger of *hypothermia* and the *energy expenditure* of chasing a mirage.
* **B: Na-ekiri a mirage nke yiri mmiri:**  Seeing a mirage is a *trigger* for the dangerous behavior (chasing it). It's not the danger itself.
* **C: Na-egbu oge na mgbalị na mirage:** This is essentially the same as option D – wasting energy. However, option D is more precise in describing the dangerous activity.



Therefore, Option D directly addresses the most significant and immediate threat described in the passage: wasting energy on a mirage, which increases the risk of hypothermia.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-agaghị ekwe omume maka ndị njem ọzara?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọnwụ anwụ (Death)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on dangers faced by desert travelers.** The passage describes mirages, the possibility of dangerously cold nights, and the risk of hypothermia. All of these are real threats in a desert environment.
* **While death is *possible* for desert travelers, the passage doesn't specifically list it as an unusual or unlikely danger.** The other options (mirages, cold water, and hypothermia) are explicitly mentioned as potential problems.
* **""Death"" is too broad.**  The passage details specific dangers, not a general state of being.

Therefore, ""Death"" is the least likely option to be considered something that *wouldn't* happen to desert travelers, given the context of the passage. While death is a possibility, the passage focuses on more immediate and specific threats.

While the text mentions the Norwegians in Austria created the first ski resort, it doesn't say they *attributed* the popularity to themselves.  The ""ski bums"" are a cultural phenomenon *associated with* skiing.
"
Kedu afọ mbụ a kpọtụrụ skiing dị ka egwuregwu na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: N'afọ 5000 tutu amụọ Kraịst**.

The text states: ""Ụmụ eserese esere n'ọgba kemgbe 5000 BC na-egosi ndị egwuregwu ski!"" This indicates that skiing was depicted in art as early as 5000 BC.

While the text mentions the first recreational ski jump in 1861, it also explicitly states that skiers were depicted in art from 5000 BC.  Therefore, 5000 BC is the earliest year skiing is referenced as a sport in the provided text.

This directly references European colonization as a significant factor in the history of the region.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ozizi Islam:** While Islam is mentioned as being brought to the area by Arabs, the passage doesn't state it as a unifying factor for the islands.
*   **C: Anụ ọhịa:** The passage mentions the region's history with forest animals, but it's not a connecting factor for the islands themselves.
*   **D: Okomoko ntụrụndụ:** This option is irrelevant to the historical context of the passage.

Therefore, European colonization is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage."
Kedu akụkụ nke obere agwaetiti dị n'Ebe Ọwụwa Anyanwụ Africa na-enweghị? ,"The correct answer is **B: Otụtụ ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ọtụtụ agwaetiti ndị ka obere bụ mba ndị kwụụrụ onwe ha, maọbụ nọrọ na njiko ha na France..."" This means some of the smaller islands had relationships with France. The passage *doesn't* mention anything about restaurants or bars.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mmekọrịta na France:** The passage explicitly states that some islands had ties to France.
*   **C: Aha ọma anụ ọhịa:** The passage mentions that the continent was known for its large, isolated animal population but doesn't say that animal names are unique to the region.
*   **D: Mmekọrịta-nnwere onwe na obodo ndị ọzọ:** The passage states that some islands were self-governing, implying they had independent relationships, but it doesn't say they *didn't* have relationships with other countries.

Therefore, the only option not mentioned in the passage is restaurants/bars.

This means Cuban citizens need a passport valid for at least six months beyond their intended stay in Ecuador.  The other options are not mentioned or supported by the provided text.
"
Kedu ebumnuche nke iwu njem Ecuador na-abụghị maka ya?,"The correct answer is **D: Na-akwado eziokwu paspọtụ**.

Here's why:

The text focuses on verifying the identity and travel plans of Cuban citizens *before* they enter Ecuador. This is directly related to ensuring the validity of their passports and preventing illegal entry.  The requirement for a letter of invitation and proof of accommodation all contribute to confirming the legitimacy of the traveler's purpose and identity, which indirectly supports the integrity of their passport.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Na-amachi ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị njem dị ka o kwere mee:**  While the Ecuadorian government likely collects travel statistics, the text doesn't explicitly state this as the primary purpose of the new regulations.
* **B: Na-echekwa usoro mbufe njem n'usoro nke ọma:**  The regulations *do* improve the entry process, but that's a *result* of the measures, not the primary *purpose*.
* **C: Na-enyocha oge ọnụnọ onye ọbịa:** While the letter of invitation and proof of accommodation address the length of stay, the text's core focus isn't solely on monitoring visitor duration.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike ịdị ọnụ na mba ọzọ karịa n'ụlọ?,"The correct answer is **B: Okpokolo agba kacha elu (High-end branded glasses)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""Okpokolo aha-brandi ogo-elu dị dị n’ụdị ebe ahụ nwere ike inwe nsogbu abụọ; ụfọdụ nwere ike ịbụ adịgboroja, ma ezigbo ya ebubatara nwere ike inwe ịdị dị oke ọnụ karịa n’ụlọ.""  This directly links high-end branded glasses to being more expensive in other countries.

The other options are not mentioned in the text as being more expensive elsewhere."
Kedu ihe egwu nwere ike ịdị mgbe ị na-azụta okpokolo agba dị oke ọnụ na mba ofesi?,"The best answer is **C: Ikekwe adịgboroja (Counterfeit)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ụfọdụ nwere ike ịbụ adịgboroja..."" (Some may be counterfeit...). This directly addresses the concern about expensive sunglasses being fake.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""ọkachasị n'obodo na-erite obere ego, ebe ụgwọ ọrụ pere mpe karịa."" (especially in low-income cities where counterfeit goods are more common.) This reinforces the likelihood of counterfeit products.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ikekwe nlele anya nke abụọ dị mkpa (It may be necessary to have a second eye exam):** While an eye exam is important for *any* sunglasses, the primary concern raised in the passage is the authenticity of the sunglasses themselves, not a general need for another eye exam.
* **B: O kwere omume na ụfọdụ ugogbe anya anya agaghị arụ ọrụ na ndenye ọgwụ (It is possible that some sunglasses will not work with the medication):** The passage doesn't mention any incompatibility issues between sunglasses and medication.
* **D: Ọnụ ego ahụ nwere ike ọ gaghị ekpuchi ya site na mkpuchi (The money may not cover it from the cover):** This option is vague and doesn't directly relate to the primary concern of counterfeit sunglasses.  The ""cover"" isn't clearly defined.



Therefore, **C: Ikekwe adịgboroja** is the most accurate and directly supported answer based on the provided passage.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""It is advisable to exchange your Falkland dollars before leaving the islands."" This directly supports option C.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The text says both Falkland Pounds *and* US Dollars are accepted in Stanley.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text mentions US Dollars are accepted in Stanley *and* on the outer islands, but doesn't say *only* dollars are accepted there.
* **Option D is incorrect:** While the text implies the Falkland Pound is the primary currency (""It is advisable to exchange your Falkland dollars...""), it doesn't say the British Pound is *more* widely known or that the Falklands follow it.  The text indicates both the Falkland Pound *and* British Pounds are accepted.



Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the text.

"Dị ka paragraf ahụ si kwuo, olee ebe usoro ịkwụ ụgwọ na-abụghị kaadị kredit ga-akacha enye aka mgbe ị na-aga Falklands si United States?","The correct answer is **A: N'ime ụlọ ahịa FIC West**.

The paragraph states: ""Ọ nere ike ime mgbanwe ego na naanị otu ụlọ akụ nọ n’agwaetiti ndị ahụ nke a ga-achọtali n’ime Stanley n’ofe site n’ụlọ ahịa FIC West."" This directly indicates that FIC West is the place to exchange currency.

Kedu ihe omume megidere mmemme a na-eme n'ụlọ nsọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụbọchị ọmụmụ chi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that many of the programs held in temples are ""mmemme ncheta ụlọ ofufe maọbụ mmemme ncheta ọmụmụ chi ha maọbụ ihe omume ọbụla dị ịrịba ama n'ụlọ ofufe ahụ."" (temple remembrance programs and deity birth anniversaries, as well as any other noteworthy events in the temple.)

The passage also mentions that the programs occur from late November to mid-March, depending on the temple's calendar. This timeframe aligns with the typical period for celebrating deity birth anniversaries in many Hindu temples.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **Amu nwa elephant (Elephant festival):** While elephant festivals are held in some parts of India, they aren't specifically mentioned in the passage as a common event during this timeframe.
*   **Ịka akara ụbọchị ncheta ụlọ nsọ (Temple Remembrance Day marking):**  This is too broad.  The passage specifies deity birth anniversaries as a *type* of remembrance program.
*   **Oge dị mkpa gbasara ụlọ nsọ (Important time regarding the temple):** This is too vague and doesn't relate to the events described in the passage.



Therefore, **Ụbọchị ọmụmụ chi (Deity birth anniversary)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"
Ebee ka mmadụ nwere ike ịhụ enyí nwere ihe ịchọ mma?,"The correct answer is **C: Na njem n'oge ememe temple**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Ọtụtụ n’ime ụlọ nsọ nwere otu ememme Kwa afọ na-ebido site na ngwụcha Nọvemba ruo N’Etiti nke Mee..."" (Many temples have one program each year from the end of November to the beginning of May...)

* **The key is the phrase ""n'oge ememe temple""** which directly translates to ""during the temple event/festival.""  This is where you would be most likely to see people displaying beautiful things (jewelry, decorations, etc.) as part of the celebration.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ebe n'etiti ngwụcha Nọvemba ruo etiti Mee** - This is too general. It describes the time period, not the specific location.
* **B: Ebe nsọ** - While jewelry might *be found* in a temple, the question asks *where to see people* displaying it. ""Ebe nsọ"" (temple) is the general location, but not the specific place to observe people with jewelry.
* **D: Gburugburu okporo ụzọ Kerala** -  This refers to the Kerala road network and is completely unrelated to the passage's content.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a kachasị mma iji chekwaa ego na azụmahịa ma ọ bụ ụgbọ elu nke mbụ, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Enwere ike ịme nkwekọrịta (Negotiate).**

Here's why:

The passage argues against spending large sums on loyalty programs (for both businesses and first-class travel) because the return on investment is often poor. It highlights that even with high-value customers, the cost of rewarding them often outweighs the benefits.

The passage implies that *negotiation* is a way to manage costs. Instead of automatically committing to loyalty program expenses or high first-class ticket prices, negotiating prices or benefits can lead to a better financial outcome.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-agbakwụnye ya na mmefu ụlọ ọrụ gị (Adding it to your company's expenses):** This is the *opposite* of what the passage suggests. The passage is about *avoiding* unnecessary expenses.
*   **B: Họrọ klas mbụ karịa azụmahịa (Choose first class over business class):** The passage argues *against* prioritizing first class for loyalty programs because it's cost-ineffective.
*   **C: Tiketi ụgbọ elu klaasị mbụ na-abụghị eduzi (Non-refundable first-class tickets):** This is a financial risk, not a cost-saving strategy.

Therefore, the best answer that aligns with the passage's message is **D: Enwere ike ịme nkwekọrịta (Negotiate).**
"
"Kedu ihe ga-abụ ihe na-emebi oge ịchọ mgbe ị na-edobe klaasị ọnụ ahịa, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **A: Ugbọ elu n'ahịrị kwụ ọtọ (First class air travel)**.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that the highest returns from advertising are seen in first-class air travel. It states that advertising to business or first-class passengers is much more profitable than targeting general travelers. The passage then discusses the difficulty in finding the *right* advertising strategy for this high-value segment. This directly connects to the idea of ""nụrụ mgbe ị na-edobe klaasị ọnụ ahịa"" (finding the right approach when establishing a premium class).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Azụmahịa klas (Business class):** While profitable, the text highlights *first class* as the most lucrative.
* **C: Mbelata (Economy class):** The text explicitly states that advertising to economy class passengers isn't worth the effort, even with the potential to reach former high-value customers.
* **D: Mbụ ọnụego (First tier):** This is too general. The question asks about the *process* of advertising to a premium class, and the text points to the unique challenges in reaching first-class travelers.

"Mgbe a na-atụnyere ọnụahịa ọnụahịa zuru oke na Africa na ụgwọ mba ụwa, gịnị na-adịghị mkpa ka etinye ya na ya?","The correct answer is **A: Ụgwọ visa agbakwunyere maka ebe na-abụghị Africa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the comparison is *after* factoring in the extra costs associated with traveling *outside* of Africa (visa fees, exit fees, etc.). Therefore, the extra visa costs for destinations *other than* Africa are irrelevant when comparing the total cost of travel to Africa versus the rest of the world.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọnụ ego ụtụ isi ọpụpụ na Africa:** The passage mentions exit fees in general, but doesn't specify they're extra *within* Africa.
*   **C: Visa maka Africa dị oke ọnụ:** The passage doesn't state that African visas are cheap or expensive. It's comparing the *total* cost including visa fees.
*   **D: Ọnụ ego a na-ana maka njem ala na mpụga Africa:** While the passage mentions transportation costs, it's the *difference* in transportation costs between Africa and other destinations that's being compared.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụfọdụ na-ewepụtakwa ihe eji esitụ nri n'ọkụ. Nmba ufodu ma o bu na’ufodu ulo ahia enwere na opekata mpe otu ebe a na-ere nri, oge ufodu o na abukari ebe nkiti anaghi agara onu."" This translates to: ""Some also sell things to cook in the oven. In foreign countries, even in supermarkets, there is usually one place where you can eat, especially during lunch breaks when people don't want to go far.""

This indicates the supermarket started offering a restaurant (ulọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ) as a nearby option for customers. The other options are mentioned as things *already* available, not as a *new* offering.
"
Kedu ihe ụfọdụ ụlọ ahịa na-enye nwere ike ịrata onye ahịa ịzụrụ nri a kwadebere?,"The best answer is **B: Udị nhọrọ ole na ole (A variety of options)**. Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nnukwu ụlọahịa gasị na-ewepụtakwa mpaghara dị iche iche ndị nwere nri e siri esi."" (The supermarket also sells different areas with cooked food.) This implies a variety of pre-cooked options are available.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ulọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị nso (Nearby restaurants):** While restaurants might be *near* the supermarket, the passage focuses on food *sold within* the supermarket.
* **C: Nri ọhụrụ (Fresh food):** The passage specifically mentions *cooked* food, not fresh ingredients.
* **D: Oven na ngwa ndakwa nri (Ovens and cooking appliances):** The passage discusses pre-cooked meals, not the equipment to make them.



Therefore, **B** directly addresses the supermarket's offering of various pre-cooked food choices."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike bụrụ nsogbu maka ndị Switzerland na ndị Belgium na-asụ French?,"The correct answer is **C: Akpọpụta okwu French kpọmkwem (Pronunciation of words)**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Ndị Belgịọm na Swiiz niile na-asụ Frenchị agagọrọ ịmụ Frenchị izugbe n’ụlọ akwụkwọ, ha ga-enwe ike ịghọta ihe ị na-ekwu ma ọ bụrụgodu na ị jiri sistemụ ọnụọgụgụ Frenchị izugbe."" This implies that while there are differences in vocabulary and spelling, the *pronunciation* differences are the most significant potential obstacle to understanding. The passage also mentions "" ụfọdụ mkpọpụta ụfọdụ mkpụrụ okwu dịtụ iche obere"" which directly relates to pronunciation.

Here's why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Ihe ngosi French a na-ahụkarị maka ọnụọgụgụ (French spelling conventions):** The passage says there are some spelling differences, but it also says speakers can understand even with a standard French spelling system. This suggests spelling isn't a major barrier.
* **B: Okwu Frenchị ndị dị iche (Different French vocabulary):** The passage acknowledges vocabulary differences but highlights that speakers can generally understand.
* **D: Ọtụtụ asụsụ Frenchị a na-asụ n'ime Fransị (Many French dialects spoken in France):** The passage specifically discusses the differences between French spoken in Switzerland and Belgium *compared to* standard French, not differences *within* French dialects in France.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-adịghị akwado France, Belgium, ma ọ bụ Switzerland?","The correct answer is **A: Otu esi ekwu okwu ọ bụla (How to speak any language)**.

Here's why:

* The passage specifically discusses the *unique characteristics* of French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland compared to France, focusing on vocabulary and number systems.
* Options B, C, and D (number systems, school French, and spelling) are all directly mentioned as differences or aspects of the French spoken in those regions.
* Option A is too broad. While the passage mentions differences in French, it doesn't imply that one of the options represents something *not supported* by the text. It's a general statement about language learning, not tied to the specific points made about the French dialects.



"
Kedu mgbe o yighị ka ị ga-enweta ego ọnwụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụrụ na ị na-eme njem na WestJet**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, and Lufthansa *do* offer meal vouchers. It then says WestJet *does not* offer them. Therefore, if you're flying with WestJet, you wouldn't receive a meal voucher.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Na-agbalị ka gị na ụlọ ọrụ ụgbọ elu nweta ntinye akwụkwọ ozugbo karịa site na ọrụ ndị ọzọ:** This refers to getting assistance with other things, not specifically meal vouchers.

*   **D: Ọ bụrụ na ị na-aga na Delta:** The text states Delta *does* offer meal vouchers.



"
Kedu ihe bụ eziokwu nke ọnụọgụ ọnwụ?,"The correct answer is **C: A ghaghị ịdeba ha akwụkwọ ozugbo site na ekwentị.**

Here's why:

The passage states that you pay for baggage fees using your phone for flights with Air Canada, Delta Air Lines, Lufthansa (for flights originating in the US and Canada), and WestJet. It *doesn't* say you have to pay at the airport.  It implies the payment is done *before* the flight, likely online or through the airline's app, *not* at the airport. Option C best reflects this implied information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ha na-akwụ ụgwọ maka njem njem olili ozu:** The passage refers to ""baggage fees,"" not ""olili ozu"" (which likely translates to ""fragile items"").
*   **B: Na webụsaịtị ụgbọ elu, a ga-edoberịrịrị ha ozugbo:** The passage mentions using your phone, not specifically the airline's website.
*   **D: Achọrọ ndoputa ekwentị ozugbo na ụgbọ elu:** The passage says you use your phone to pay, not that you need to present it at the airport.

Kedu mgbe ọ ka mma iji ngwaọrụ GPS kwụ ọtọ karịa ngwa igodo GPS?,"The correct answer is **C: mgbe ị hapụrụ oke anabatara gị (when you leave the coverage area).**

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ọ bụrụ na ịnweghị njikọ data n'ekwentị gị, maọbụ mgbe ha nọ n'ọpụpụ ogbe njikọ ahụ, arụmọrụ ha nwere ike dị obere maọbụ ọgaghị adị chaa chaa."" (If you don't have data connectivity on your phone, or when they are outside the coverage area of that network, their performance may be low and may not be reliable.)

This means the phone's GPS relies on a data connection for optimal performance.  When you're outside of cell service range, the phone's GPS becomes less accurate.  This is precisely when a dedicated GPS device (like a standalone GPS unit or one from a navigation company) is *better* because it doesn't rely on cell data.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mgbe ịchọrọ ibelata ọnụ ahịa (When you want to save money):** While using the phone's GPS *can* save money, that's not the primary reason to choose a dedicated GPS unit *over* the phone's GPS.
* **B: Ozugbo ị mara na ị ga-enwe njikọ data (When you know you will have data connectivity):** If you have data connectivity, the phone's GPS is likely to be just as good as a dedicated GPS.
* **D: Mgbe ị naekpebi megide ịgbazinye ngwaọrụ (When you have decided against subscribing to a device):** This is irrelevant to *when* you'd choose a dedicated GPS device *over* the phone's GPS.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that GPS on your phone is often the easiest way to navigate *when you are not in your town*.
* It also mentions that if you *don't* have data connection or are in an area without one, the performance can be poor or unavailable.
* This highlights the dependence of phone GPS on data connectivity, making it a potential drawback compared to dedicated GPS devices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: emefu obere** (small size): While phone GPS is convenient due to its size, the passage doesn't present this as a reason *against* using it.
* **C: Enweghị ike ịgbazite ụlọ** (cannot download maps):  The passage explicitly states that it can *save* you money by avoiding the need to buy new maps.
* **D: enweghị ịzụrụ maapụ ọhụrụ** (no need to buy new maps):  This is the opposite of what the passage says - phone GPS *helps* you avoid buying new maps.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kpachara anya hụ na ejenti ị ga-eji akwụ ụgwọ bụ onye maara Galapagos ọfụma na mara ọtụtụ ụgbọ mmiri di iche iche.""  This means using a travel agency specializing in Galapagos tours is the best way to ensure you're connected with a reputable and knowledgeable boat operator.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: idobe otu opekata mpe mmadụ 8+ na-ekerịta ọdịmma:** While a good reputation is important, the passage doesn't connect it directly to a specific method of booking.
*   **B: Nhazi emere n'oge mgbụsị akwụkwọ:** This is irrelevant to booking a Galapagos tour.
*   **D: Ndokwa mbụ:** This is too vague and doesn't address the need for expertise in Galapagos tours.

"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị usoro nke casinos na-eji mee ka ndị ahịa na-egwu egwu, dị ka ekwuru na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Ìhè sitere na anyanwụ n'ụba (Sounds from the outside)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that casinos *avoid* having clocks and exits easily found to keep people engrossed. It also mentions providing food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and trapped.  The mention of ""sounds from the outside"" directly contradicts the casino's efforts to isolate and disorient players. Casinos actively *avoid* sounds from the outside to maintain a sense of being cut off from the real world.

The other options are all things casinos *do* to encourage gambling:

*   **B: Ụgwọ ọrụ dị ka tiketi egwu egwu ego (Rewards like gambling tickets):**  This is a common tactic to encourage continued play.

*   **D: clocks adịghị adị (Clocks are not available):**  This is mentioned in the passage as a way to make people lose track of time and remain focused on gambling.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụzọ ọpụpụ na-arakarị ahụ ịchọta."" (Escape routes are constantly being sought.)  It also mentions that the people trapped in the building prioritize staying clear-headed ("" ndị nille na-agba chaa chaa mara mkpa nke ọ dị ịnọ n'ezi echiche""). Finding an escape route is crucial for staying clear-headed and surviving.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: ịnakwere ụgwọ ọrụ nke ụdị ọ bụla** (Accepting any kind of payment):  The passage doesn't mention payment or work.
*   **C: na-enyocha oge ma ọ bụ elekere** (Checking the time or clock): The passage says they *don't* pay attention to the time or clock, as it's a distraction.

"Kedu akụkụ okwu ka etinyere n'isi n'etiti nkebiokwu, dịka akụkụ nke akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Adjectives**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses hyphenation as a way to clarify the relationship between words, especially when they act as a single unit.  Hyphenated words are often compound adjectives – words that modify nouns.  

The question asks *what part of speech* is typically placed in the middle of a hyphenated word in this context.  Compound adjectives are formed by putting an adjective *before* the noun it modifies. Therefore, the adjective is usually found in the middle of the hyphenated compound.



Therefore, the answer is **C: Adjectives**."
Kedu ihe akụkụ ahụ ga-atụ aro ka isi okwu nke aha nwere ike gbakọọ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ịmata ngwaa dị iche iche**.

Here's why:

The passage states that recognizing word roots helps to differentiate between different words and also makes reading easier.  The key purpose highlighted is understanding the *meaning* of words by recognizing their parts.  This directly relates to understanding different words (and their meanings).

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ọgụgụ (Reading):** While recognizing roots makes reading easier, it's not the *primary* purpose or outcome described in the passage.
* **C: Na-ede (Writing):**  The passage doesn't explicitly mention how recognizing roots helps with writing.
* **D: Na-ekewa ihe dị iche iche (Distinguishing different things):** While related, it's a consequence of understanding different words, rather than the direct purpose suggested.

"""Kedu ihe mmegharị ahụ na-egosi """"gafere"""" n'ime ime obodo Malaysia?""","The correct answer is **A: na-eji mkpịsị aka aka iji tụgharịa**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in Malaysia, the hand gesture traditionally meaning ""hello"" in many parts of the world actually means ""come"" – like the gesture of beckoning someone.  The sentence ""onye ome njem Britenụ nọ na Spenụ nwere ike ịghọtaghie ofufe aka """"ka ọdị"""" nke ihu aka chere onye na-efe ya ihu (kama onye a na-efere aka) ka ọ na-asị ya lọghachi"" describes how the gesture is interpreted – someone *beckoning* someone else to approach.  This is best described as a welcoming gesture involving moving the hand to indicate ""come here.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ịfefe (Waving):** While waving *can* be a gesture, the passage focuses on the specific meaning of the hand gesture as ""come,"" not just a general waving.
* **C: Elu-fiving (High-fiving):**  This is a celebratory gesture and not related to the meaning of the hand gesture in Malaysia.
* **D: na-enye nzaghachi dị mma (Giving a good reply):** This doesn't relate to the meaning or interpretation of the hand gesture.



"
"""Kedu ngagharị nke enwere ike ịkọwa site na paragraf ka """"laghachite""""?""","The correct answer is **A: Mgbe ị na-efegharị, tụgharịa aka gị n'ime**.

The paragraph states that a handshake in Malaysia signifies ""welcome"" (like a ""rising of the fingers""). It also mentions that a British diplomat might interpret a handshake as a signal to pull the hand back, implying the person being shaken's hand should retract inwards. Therefore, ""laghachite"" (to pull back/retract) in this context means to turn your hand inwards.
"
"Kedu ihe na-eme crvasses, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **A: Akwa mmiri ejiri snow mee** (The water pipe is filled with snow).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Akpụrụ mmiri ebe ahụ anaghị anọ otu ebe, kama ọ na-eruda ugwu. Nke a na-ebute maka mgbaka na mpio nke akwa sno nwere ike ikpuchido."" (The water pipe there is not flowing evenly, but rather rising. This is caused by snow accumulating and blocking the water pipe.)

This clearly indicates that the blockage is due to snow. The other options don't align with the information provided in the text.
"
"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike izobe àkwà mmiri snow, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **A: Mgbawa (Ice)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the snow is not melting evenly, but piling up. This is because of ice formation blocking the drainage. The ice can also cause the walls and covers of the snow trough to crack and close the drainage.  The piling up of snow occurs because water, when present, freezes and expands, causing the snow to push outwards and potentially shift the drainage grate.

Therefore, the ice (mgbawa) is the direct cause of the blocked drainage and the uneven snow buildup. The other options (snow trough, ice storm, large column) are not directly mentioned as contributing to the ice formation or the problem described.

This means that the security situation *around* Goma is a concern, and visitors need to be aware of it. While the Nyiragongo volcano is relevant to Goma's history, the security concerns are more directly related to the area surrounding the town. Options A, C, and D are less directly tied to the security considerations mentioned in the text."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ga-abụ ndụmọdụ ọjọọ maka onye ọbịa na Goma?,"The correct answer is **A: Agha North Kivu na-atọ ụtọ**.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states that any trip outside of Goma requires checking the security situation due to ongoing conflict in the North Kivu region. This means the conflict is a serious concern for visitors.
*   Options B, C, and D are presented as facts about Goma. They aren't necessarily *bad* advice, though they might come with their own risks. However, option A is the most direct and serious concern for a visitor.

Therefore, the best answer representing potentially dangerous advice is A.

Kedu ụbọchị n'August ka a ga-enweta ikike ịla azụ azụ?,"The correct answer is **A: 1 nke Jenụwarị**

The passage states: ""Ikike azụụlọ maka ụbọchị mbido ọ bụla na Mee ga-adị na Jenụwarị 1."" This translates to ""The permit for guided trips will be available on January 1st.""
"
Kedu iwu etinyere iji gbochie mmebi nke ọwa mmiri ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Usoro ikike nke na-ebu ụzọ, na-ebute ụzọ**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ikikere nwedebere ike ichekwa ndida ahu, ma diri-adi na ubochi mbu nke onwa, onwa ano tupu mbido onwa ahu. Ya bụ na ikike azụụlọ maka ụbọchị mbido ọbụla na Mee ga-adị na Jenụwarị 1."" This indicates a first-come, first-served basis for obtaining the permits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Naanị na Jenụwarị 1st ka a ga-enye ikike:** While permits are available on January 1st, the text emphasizes the first-come, first-served basis.  It's not *only* available on that date.
* **C: Naanị ụzọ ị ga-esi nweta ikike bụ ịrịọ arịrịọ:** While requesting a permit *is* how you get the permit, the text implies that the process is more than just a request; it's about being among the first to apply.
* **D: ọnụ ọgụgụ dị nta nke akwụkwọ ikike:** The text mentions a limit on the number of permits available, but this isn't the *law* preventing water contamination. It's a limit on the permits themselves.

Kedu n'ime ụlọ ndị a dabara na nkọwa nke ụdị ụlọ nkwari akụ a kacha nta?,"The correct answer is **C: Ndị ọbịa ama ama ma ọ bụ ndị ama ama (Distinguished guests or dignitaries)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that these old mansions were sometimes visited by "" ndị isi obodo na ndị a maara aha ha"" - meaning local leaders and well-known figures.
* The passage also mentions that wealthy travelers would sometimes rent these mansions for extended stays.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mmanya na-eje ozi cocktails (Buzzing cocktail bars):**  The passage describes a quiet, old-fashioned atmosphere, not a lively bar scene.
* **B: Ebe a na-eri nri gourmet n'ime ụlọ (Houses where gourmet food is eaten):** While the wealthy might have enjoyed good food, the passage doesn't focus on gourmet dining as a primary feature.  The emphasis is on the historical significance and the guests who stayed there.
* **D: mmelite nke oge a n'ime ụlọ ndị emezigharịrị nso nso a (Modern updates inside recently renovated houses):** The passage emphasizes the *lack* of modern amenities.



Therefore, **C** best aligns with the description of the mansions as sometimes hosting important guests.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes the historical significance and unique character of these old houses. It states they date back to the early 20th century and were places where people lived and built their lives. 
* The passage highlights the lack of modern amenities and the reliance on oral tradition, contributing to the house's unique ""charm"" or character.
* The passage mentions that wealthy travelers appreciated these houses for their historical context and ""old-fashioned charm.""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: ụlọ ọrụ siri nri ama ama (A well-known restaurant):** The passage doesn't mention anything about the house being a restaurant.
* **C: A mmanya nke nwere ntụrụndụ kwa abalị (A pool for daily recreation):**  The passage explicitly states there's a lack of modern amenities like swimming pools.
* **D: ọnụ ahịa nkwari akụ dị ọnụ ala (Low real estate prices):** The passage focuses on the historical and cultural value of the houses, not their price. It mentions wealthy people *buying* them, implying they aren't necessarily cheap.

"Kedu ihe a ga-ezere, dịka ederede, ndị ọbịa na Greenland?","The correct answer is **D: ""na-akpọ onye bi na Greenland """"Eskimo""""""**.

The text explicitly states: ""N’agbanyeghị na ị nwere ike ịnụ Ndị mba Griinlandị iji mkpụrụokwu a, ojiji ya kwesịrị ịbụ nke ndị mba ọzọ ga-ezere. Ndị obodo bi na Greenland na-akpọ onwe ha Inuit na Kanada na Kalaalleq (nke karịrị otu Kalaallit), onye Greenland, n’ime Greenland."" This directly advises against using the term ""Eskimo"" when referring to Greenlanders.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ọtụtụ ebe nwere akụkọ mpụ dị elu:** The text mentions the danger of cold and the need for warm clothing, but not about avoiding areas with high levels of local stories.
* **B: Weta uwe siri ike n'ihi na ọ na-ekpo ọkụ n'afọ niile:** The text advises bringing warm clothing for the cold, especially in winter, not for the heat.
* **C: N'ịtụle njikọ weebụ na-ama jijiji, na-"
"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a nwere ike ịkpata nsogbu maka ndị ọbịa na-adịghị njikere na Greenland, dịka akụkụ akwụkwọ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **C: Ihu igwe (Cold)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Gaa ileta Greenland n'oge oyi (itinye n'uche na ka ị na agbago ugu, ka oyi na akarị), ọ dị mkpa iji akwa nchụ oyi.

This directly points to the danger of the cold and the need for proper attire to avoid health problems. The other options are not mentioned as significant dangers for unprepared visitors.

The text explicitly states: ""P: Jardín de la Unión. A rụrụ ohere a dịka atrium maka otu kọnventị narị afọ iri na asaa..."" which translates to ""P: Garden of the Union. This space served as an atrium for a convent for one hundred and seventy years..."" and later refers to it as a plaza where many things happen.
"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu, dịka ekwuru na paragraf, gbasara Jardn de la Unión?","The correct answer is **A: egwu egwu na Central gazebo**

Here's why:

*   The text mentions Jardín de la Unión as an atrium for a convent for centuries and highlights the Templo de San Diego as the only remaining building. It also mentions restaurants, events, and the Alley of the Kiss.
*   There is *no* mention of dancing or a central gazebo in the provided text. The other options (B, C, and D) are all mentioned:
    *   **B:** The Alley of the Kiss is where the story of the first love happened.
    *   **C:** There are many restaurants surrounding the garden.
    *   **D:** The garden's history as a convent suggests past residences.

Therefore, ""egwu egwu na Central gazebo"" is the statement that is *not* supported by the text.
"
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara mkpagharị ụbọchị ka a ga-ewere na ọ bụ eziokwu n'iburu n'uche akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Maka njem ụbọchị na ụzọ dị mfe, atụmatụ dị ntakịrị dị mkpa.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the importance of planning for day hikes.** It mentions the distance is short, but it still requires preparation, especially for those who are physically fit.  The passage also points out that even families with young children *can* manage a day hike with proper planning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọ bụ ezie na ebe dị anya na-adịgasị iche, e mere ha ka e were mee njem n’otu ụbọchị.**  The passage says day hikes are *typically* done in a single day, but it doesn't say it *always* happens regardless of the location.  The passage highlights preparation regardless of location.
* **C: Ọtụtụ mmadụ nwere ike ịnụ ụtọ mmega ahụ a ma ọ bụrụ na ha nwere ogo ahụike dị mma.** The passage doesn't explicitly state a link between good health and enjoying the hike. While it's implied that fitness helps, good health isn't emphasized as a prerequisite.
* **D: Ezinụlọ ndị nwere ụmụntakịrị kwesịrị izere ịga njem n'ụbọchị.** The passage states that families *can* manage a day hike with children if they plan properly.  It doesn't say they should avoid them altogether.



Therefore, **A** is the most accurate statement based on the information provided in the passage. The passage highlights the need for planning, especially for easier day hikes.
"
"Kedu mgbe njem ụbọchị na-ewe obere nkwadebe, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **C: Ozugbo ụmụaka malitere hiking**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ezinụlọ ndị nwere obere ụmụaka nwere ike ịchọkwu njikere, mana otu ụbọchị n’ezi dị mfe omume ma ọ bụrụgodu n’agụnye ụmụ ọhụrụ na ụmụaka ọtakara.""  This implies that the hike becomes easier and more manageable *once* children are included.  This aligns with option C, as the passage indicates that including children makes a day hike more feasible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mgbe nzọ ụkwụ siri ike na-etinye aka:** While good footwear helps, the passage doesn't explicitly link difficult footwear with a shorter preparation time.
*   **B: Mgbe onye njem na-adị mma n'anụ ahụ:**  A person's physical condition doesn't necessarily dictate how *much* preparation is needed for a hike.
*   **D: ọ bụrụ na a na-eme njem ahụ n'ọnọdụ dị mma karịa:** The passage doesn't discuss weather conditions in relation to preparation time.

"
"N'adịghị ka ndị Norway ndị ọzọ, gịnị na-akọwa ala dị larịị na Rogaland ma ọ bụ Agder?","The correct answer is **D: Ugboro ugboro, heather na-ekpuchi ha**.

Here's why:

The text states that ""vidde"" (in the south) and ""hei"" (in Rogaland and Agder) are characterized by being barren, treeless, and open. While the text *doesn't* explicitly state what covers the ground, the description implies that the ground is not covered in forests or dense vegetation.  Heather is a common plant that thrives in harsh, open environments like the ones described.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Osisi dị (There are trees):** The text explicitly states these areas are *without* trees.
* **B: Fjords anọghị ya (They don't have fjords):** The text doesn't mention fjords at all.
* **C: Ọtụtụ n'ime ala dị larịị bụ otu (Many of the high grounds are one):** The text doesn't provide information about the shape or number of the high grounds.

Therefore, the best inference from the text is that heather is the ground cover.
"
"Kedu ihe na-agaghị abụ njirimara Norway, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Platea nwere osisi (Plateaus with trees)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that ""vidde"" (and ""hei"" in Rogaland and Agder) are characterized by being treeless.  Therefore, plateaus *with* trees would be the opposite of what's described as a feature of Norway.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mpaghara ala na-emepebeghị emepe (Undeveloped highland areas):** The text describes ""vidde"" and ""hei"" as highland areas.
*   **C: Fjords siri ike (Hard fjords):** While not directly mentioned in the provided text, fjords are a defining feature of Norway, so it's unlikely to be something *not* characteristic.
*   **D: Moorland:** Moorland is a type of treeless upland, consistent with the description of ""vidde"" and ""hei.""

Therefore, the only option that contradicts the description in the text is B.
"
Kedu mgbe ndị na-agba ski ga-aga n'ebe ntụrụndụ nke ugwu?,"The correct answer is **A: Mgbe oyi na-abịa**.

This translates to: ""Skiing is often done during the Indian winter. However, they have different conditions in the winter, when snow falls on many mountains for activities like skiing and snowboarding.""

Therefore, skiing happens *when winter arrives*.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: elu nke oge** (peak of the year) - Doesn't relate to seasonal conditions.
*   **C: Mgbe oge okpomọkụ India rutere** (When the Indian summer arrives) - This is the opposite of when skiing occurs.
*   **D: Mgbe mmiri rutere** (When the water arrives) -  Irrelevant to skiing.

Here's why:

* The passage states that people often visit ski resorts *during the winter*, particularly when there's a lot of snow (""mgbe sno na-ada n'ọtụtụ ugwu were nyefe efe msks ihe omume dịka skiyin na snobọdịn""). 
* The question asks when guests are *most likely* to go to ski resorts.
* Option A directly reflects this connection between heavy snowfall and increased visitors. 

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: dum snowboarding oge:** While snowboarding is an activity at ski resorts, the passage doesn't specifically say that snowboarding happens *during* all winter.
* **C: Mgbe oge okpomọkụ India rutere:** This is the opposite of what the passage describes; winter is associated with snow, not Indian summer.
* **D: Maka oge oyi:**  While technically correct, ""oke snow"" (heavy snow) is more specific and describes the *peak* season for visitors.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes Mara's role as a central point of contact.** She's supposed to be aware of everything happening at the water source, interacting with people, and assisting them. 
* **If a boat needs help, the logical first step is to go to the dock (ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri) and investigate.** This aligns with Mara's responsibility to be aware of and respond to situations at the water source.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: iso ndị ọchịagha na-emekọ ihe:**  While involving authorities might be necessary *eventually*, it's not the immediate action Mara should take when a boat requests help.
* **C: na-akwalite azụmahịa gị:** The passage focuses on helping people, not promoting business.
* **D: A na-eleghara ndị njem nọ n'ụgbọ mmiri ndị ọzọ anya:** This is the opposite of what Mara is supposed to do. She is supposed to be actively engaged with everyone.

* **B: Apụọ n'anya:** This is the opposite of what the passage describes.
* **C: Abịakwutela onye ọ bụla ma ọ bụrụ na ha na-ehicha ụgbọ mmiri ha:**  While you *could* approach, the passage emphasizes actively seeking out and initiating conversation with boat owners.  Just watching them might not be enough.
* **D: Debe ndị na-akụ ọkpọ ndị ọzọ n'ọnụ mmiri:** This is irrelevant to the task of helping boat owners.

Kedu mpaghara nwere ike ịdọta onye ọbịa nke chọsiri ike maka ọchịchị ndị agwaetiti ahụ n'oge gara aga?,"The correct answer is **C: Obi Hong Kong**.

The passage states: ""Ebe a bụ ebe ndị nchịkwa mba si Britenụ were dị ka nke ha ya mere ọ bụrụ na ị na-achọ maka akaebe nke nchịkwa ókèala ahụ gara aga, ebe a bụ ebe dị mma ịmalite.""

"
Ebee ka onye njem nke ji vista na-akpali akpali kpọrọ ihe ga-achọ ịga?,"The correct answer is **C: agwaetiti Hong Kong**.

The passage states: ""Ịhụta Họng Kọng n'ụzọ kachasị mma, pụọ n'agwaetiti gawa na Kowloon, mpaghara akụkụ mmiri, nke chere gị ihu."" This translates to: ""To see Dragon's Back in the best way, leave from the island and go to Kowloon, a waterfront area, which will greet you."" 

Therefore, to see Dragon's Back, one needs to go to **agwaetiti Hong Kong** (Hong Kong Island).

* **The passage specifically mentions:** "" ọtụtụ n’ime ndị na-anya na-eyi akpụkpọ ụkwụ ọnyịnya ndị were kọị kọị na okpuru dị nrọ ma pee mpe."" (many riders use horse boots that are made of padded and smooth material) This directly links padded/smooth boots to reducing the risk of the rider slipping.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: ọbụ ụkwụ dị gịrịgịrị:** While the passage doesn't explicitly say boots being ""gịrịgịrị"" are better, it focuses on the padding/smoothness. The stiffness isn't the primary concern mentioned.
* **B: Ogwe nche:**  The passage doesn't mention ""ogwe nche"" (stirrups) at all.
* **D: kwụsie ike karị:** While a more secure fit might *help*, the passage emphasizes the *material* of the boots as the key factor in preventing slipping.



"
Kedu njirimara akpụkpọ ụkwụ na-eme ka nchekwa onye na-agba ya dịkwuo mma mgbe ị na-eji ihe mkpali?,"The correct answer is **B: Akpụkpọ anụ (Padding)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the risk of the rider's feet slipping into the stirrups.**  Padding is specifically designed to prevent this.  The text mentions riders often use stirrups with ""soft padding"" to prevent this.
* **Sturdy stirrups (A) are helpful but don't directly address the slipping issue.**
* **Stirrup irons (C) are part of the stirrup but don't provide protection against slipping.**
* **A hollow stirrup (D) would be *less* safe, not more.**

Therefore, padding is the key feature that enhances safety by preventing the rider's feet from slipping into the stirrups.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Njikọ mgbanwe nke ile ọbịa bụ nzụkọ na ejikọ ndị njem na ndị obodo n’ime ụmụ obodo ndị ha na-aga eleta.""  This directly means the network connects visitors with locals for accommodation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ụgbọ elu na ọnụ ahịa mbelata:** While the passage mentions a cheap flight as the starting point of Couchsurfing, the network itself doesn't primarily offer flight discounts.
* **C: Ndị ndu ime obodo na-eduga njegharị:**  While locals might guide visitors, the core function isn't *leading* tours, but providing a place to stay.
* **D: mmekọrịta ya na ndị njem nlegharị anya ndị ọzọ n'otu ebe ahụ:**  Networking with *other* travelers is a *secondary* benefit, but not the primary service Couchsurfing offers to visitors.

The text explicitly states that networks for hospitality exchange *require* a profile form, and some networks *may* require additional verification. It doesn't say that hosts *always* offer accommodation to visitors. The core idea is an exchange, not a guaranteed offer for every traveler.

Here's why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **B: Ụfọdụ netwọk nwere ike ịrịọ maka nkwenye ndị njem ọzọ:** The text states ""some networks may require additional verification.""

* **D: Enwere oge mgbe ndị njem nleta nwere ike ịgụ nyocha nke ndị ọbịa obodo:** While not directly stated, the creation of profiles implies that visitors can see information about the hosts.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ulo-obia na elekota karisia ndị na-eto eto – ndi obia na abiakari no n’afo agbata iri-abuo – mana inwere ike ihuta ndi njem ozo ebe ahu kwa mgbe.""  This translates to: ""The boarding house is more frequented by young people - young people who have just graduated - but other travelers can also stay there from time to time.""

Option A directly reflects this statement. The other options are less likely based on the provided information:

*   **B: onye ọbịa na-aga naanị ya:** While possible, the text emphasizes young graduates as the more common visitors.
*   **C: onye ọbịa nke nwere ụmụntakịrị ya na ha:**  The text mentions that families rarely stay there, and only some places offer private rooms, making it less likely that families with children are frequent visitors.
*   **D: onye ọbịa nke na-amalite na etiti iri ato ha:** The passage specifically mentions "" ndị na-eto eto"" (young people who have just graduated), implying they are in their early twenties."
"Kedu onye, dịka ederede, ọ ga-abụ na ọ ga-anọ na ụlọ mbikọ?","The correct answer is **D: Ụmụaka sitere na ezinụlọ abụọ na-eme njem**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a place that caters to young people (12-year-olds) and allows for repeated visits.** This suggests a temporary living situation.
* **It mentions that families aren't typically present, but some locations offer private rooms.** This points towards a place where children might be staying independently or with limited parental presence.
* **Option D (""Ụmụaka sitere na ezinụlọ abụọ na-eme njem"") perfectly aligns with this description.**  It indicates children who are traveling and staying somewhere temporarily, not permanently with their parents.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: di na nwunye na obere nwa ezumike:** This suggests a family unit, which the passage states isn't common.
* **B: otu ndị dị afọ 22 atọ nọ n'okporo ụzọ:**  While it could be someone traveling, it doesn't fit the context of a place for younger people and repeated visits.
* **C: Di na nwunye dị afọ 70:**  This describes an older couple, inconsistent with the target age group of the location.

Here's why:

*   The text explicitly states: ""Oka-na-onuogugu igba-okirikiri di na mba Australia bu n’ezie nke na anaghi alaghachi azu."" (Boomerangs in Australia don't always return.)
*   It also says: ""Ọbụrụ na ị chọrọ ịmụta ka esi atụ bumerang nke na alaghachikwute gị ma Ị tụpụ ya, gbalịa hụ na Ị nwere nke na alaghachikwute alaghachikwute."" (If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang that comes back, try to get one that returns.) This implies that not all boomerangs return.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ọ bụrụ na atụba ya nke ọma, ọ ga-alaghachi n'aka gị mgbe niile** - The text directly contradicts this. It says boomerangs don't *always* return.
*   **B: Ndị obodo na-amasị ya karịa ndị ọbịa** - The text doesn't mention whether locals or tourists like boomerangs more.
*   **C: Australia nwere oke nhọrọ nke boomerangs** - The text doesn't provide any information about the variety of boomerangs available in Australia.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-eme ka ọtụtụ nri Javanese?,"The correct answer is **B: sugar na ntụ ntụ** (sugar and salt).

The passage explicitly states: ""Ndị Java kara nwere mmasị na ya ndị nke bụ ahụekere achịcha kpuchiri, ose, shuga (tụmadị shuga akị Ndị Java) na ngwa nrị ndị ọzọ were usi ọma.""  ""Ose"" translates to salt and sugar is mentioned as a key ingredient.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **C: sugar mere si aki oyibo** (sugar made from sugarcane):  The passage simply refers to ""shuga"" (sugar), not the source of the sugar.
*   **D: Sugar gbara ọchịchịrị** (Fermented sugar): Fermented sugar is a type of sugar, but the passage doesn't mention it.  The focus is on sugar and salt.

This directly indicates that infectious diseases are caused by pathogens, and these pathogens are spread by being in contact with someone who is already sick (""onye na-arịa oria ahụ""). Therefore, the origin of infectious diseases is people who are already sick.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọrịa nje** - While viruses *can* cause infectious diseases, the paragraph says infectious diseases are caused by *pathogens* which include viruses, bacteria, etc.
*   **C: Nje bacteria** -  Similar to B, bacteria are one type of pathogen, but the paragraph doesn't pinpoint bacteria as the sole cause of all infectious diseases.
*   **D: Ịgba ọgwụ mgbochi ọrịa** - Vaccination is a *preventative measure*, not the cause of infectious diseases."
"Kedu ihe na-enweghị ugbu a ama ama etiology ọrịa na-efe efe, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Nje Virus**.

The passage states: ""Ọrịa na-efe efe bụ otu nke patoginụ kpatara, dị ka nje, bakterium, nje ero ma ọ bụ parasaịtị ndị ọzọ.""  This means viruses are a cause of infectious diseases.

N'ọnọdụ ndị dị aṅaa ka onye na-azụ ahịa ga-enwe afọ ojuju na proxy webụ karịa ndị na-eweta VPN nke ha?,"The correct answer is **B: Onye ọrụ chọrọ ịnọ ebe dị anya site n'ileba anya na nyocha dịka ha nwere ike.**

Here's why:

* **VPNs** mask the user's IP address and encrypt all internet traffic, making it appear as though the user is accessing the internet from the VPN server's location. This is ideal for bypassing geo-restrictions and accessing content available in different regions.
* **Web proxies** primarily handle HTTP traffic. While they can hide the user's IP address, they don't encrypt traffic and are generally less secure than VPNs.  They are useful for simple IP masking, but not for comprehensive location spoofing.

Let's break down why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Onye ọrụ chọrọ ịgbanwe okporo ụzọ:** Both VPNs and web proxies can change the routing of traffic. This isn't a differentiator in terms of which is *better*.
* **C: Ọtụtụ ndegharị okporo ụzọ onye ọrụ bụ maka http:** While a proxy would be suited for this, a VPN handles *all* traffic, making the statement not specific enough to choose proxy over VPN.
* **D: A chọrọ ọnụọgụ bandwidth dị oke oke ma dị elu maka mmemme onye ọrụ:** VPNs *can* offer high bandwidth, but it's not inherently a better feature than a web proxy. The bandwidth needs depend on the application.

**In summary:** The core difference lies in the ability to convincingly spoof location. A VPN offers a more robust solution for this, making it preferable to a web proxy when the primary goal is to appear as if you are browsing from a different geographic location. Option B directly reflects this need.
"
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara VPN na proxies webụ bụ nke na-abụghị eziokwu, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Naanị http okporo ụzọ VPN nwere ike ibugharị ya.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** ""They change *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP."" This directly contradicts option D, which claims only HTTP traffic is routed by VPNs.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the prompt:

* **A: Tụnyere proxies webụ, VPN na-enyekarị bandwit karịa:** The prompt mentions VPNs often provide higher bandwidth than other services.  While proxies *can* sometimes offer faster speeds due to caching, the prompt doesn't guarantee they always do.  Therefore, the statement is *potentially* true, and doesn't directly contradict the text.
* **B: Ọ bụghị ndị nnọchi anya webụ nwere ike ibugharị okporo ụzọ ịntanetị niile:** The prompt explicitly states that VPNs change *all* internet traffic, unlike web proxies which don't.  This makes this statement true.
* **C: Tụnyere VPN, proxies webụ na-enye ogo ọrụ dị obere:** The prompt talks about VPNs making it hard to track what's happening inside them, implying a degree of security and privacy. While proxies *can* be used for privacy, they aren't generally known for the same level of security as VPNs.  So, this statement is *potentially* true, and doesn't directly contradict the text.



Therefore, only option D is demonstrably false based on the provided text.

Kedu ihe kpatara na mmadụ ga-eji ekwentị na-eweta ekwentị na-anọghị n'akụkụ ya nso?,"The correct answer is **A: Oku ekwentị dabere na ịntanetị**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states that VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) relies on the internet.**  VoIP allows you to make phone calls using an internet connection instead of traditional phone lines.
* **This internet-based nature allows you to use phone numbers from anywhere in the world, regardless of your physical location.**  The text gives examples of using satellite internet in remote locations and choosing phone numbers from different states.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: igwe ekwentị ụwa** (Global telephone exchange) - While the global telephone exchange is part of the overall phone system, it doesn't explain *why* someone would choose a number from a different location.
* **C: Satịlaịtị** (Satellite) - While satellite internet *enables* VoIP in remote locations, it's the internet *itself* that allows the choice of phone numbers.
* **D: Ekwentị PSTN** (PSTN - Public Switched Telephone Network) - The text discusses avoiding the PSTN and using VoIP *instead* of it.

"Kedu ihe enwere ike ịchọrọ, dabere na akụkụ ahụ, iji nweta ụfọdụ oku?","The correct answer is **A: Nweta ọnụọgụgụ zuru ụwa ọnụ (Get an international number)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the ability to choose a phone number independent of your physical location.** It states you can get satellite internet in Alaska but choose a number from Arizona. This implies a need for a number that isn't tied to your current location.
* **An international number allows you to have a number in a location different from where you are physically.**  This addresses the core issue presented in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Were ụlọ ọrụ ekwentị dị na mpaghara were (Get a local phone company):** The passage explicitly advises *against* using local phone companies, as you can choose a number from anywhere.
* **C: Rịọ mpaghara gị maka nọmba (Request a number from your region):**  The passage suggests you can choose a number *different* from your region.
* **D: Nye iwu ekwentị PSTN (Obtain a PSTN phone line):** The passage implies that a PSTN line might cause issues with calls being received, so obtaining one isn't the solution.



Therefore, getting an international number is the most logical solution based on the information provided in the passage.

Kedu n'ime okwu ndị a bụ ụgha gbasara etu esi akpọ okwu Italian?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọtụtụ aha nwere mkpọpụta dị iche iche dabere na ụdaume na-esote.**

Here's why:

* **The prompt explicitly states:** ""Mkpọpụta ha na-adị iche iche dabere na ụdaume na-esote."" This directly supports option D. The example of ""caro"" (dear) vs. ""carro"" (cart) perfectly illustrates this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mkpọpụta nke abụọ r dị iche na nke otu r:** While true (r and rr are pronounced differently), this isn't a *lie* about Italian pronunciation. It's a correct observation.
* **B: A na-ekwu ọtụtụ okwu n'otu ụzọ e si dee ya:** This is *false*. The prompt highlights that many words have different pronunciations *despite* having the same spelling.
* **C: Ụfọdụ okwu na-eji mkpụrụedemede c na g nwere ike bụrụ ihe ịma aka:** This isn't a lie. The prompt itself acknowledges that the pronunciation of 'c' and 'g' can be tricky.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that is presented as a *lie* about Italian pronunciation in the prompt.



"
Kedu n'ime àgwà Izmir ndị a dị tupu ugbu a?,"The correct answer is **D: Tile elu ụlọ na-acha uhie uhie (Tile roofs)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""... ụlọ ahịa narị afọ iri na asatọ ahụ, ụmụ ụlọ alakụba na ụlọ ụka, agbanyeghị n'obodo ahụ nwere nkwụrụ nke kara bụrụ Mediterranean Yurop karịa Tọki keọdịnala. **Tile roofs**..."" 

While the other options are mentioned, the tile roofs are specifically highlighted as a characteristic of the architecture.

Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara Izmir?,"The correct answer is **C: Enwere ike ịhụ ma ụlọ ahịa azụmaahịa nke oge a na ụlọ ụka akụkọ ihe mere eme**.

Here's why:

*   The text states that Izmir's old city, Smyrna, is currently a place of **development and commerce**, implying modern shops and historical houses *do* exist. Therefore, option C isn't necessarily untrue.

*   The text explicitly states Izmir is the **second largest port in Turkey** (Option D).

*   The text mentions Izmir has a **good airport** and is a significant city in **Turkey** (Option B).

*   The text describes the architecture, mentioning traditional tiled roofs and century-old shops, indicating a **large body of water surrounding it** (Option A).



Therefore, option C is the one that contradicts the descriptions in the provided text, making it the correct answer."
"""Kedu ihe a na-ahụ mgbe ejiri okwu """"hanami"""" mee ihe?""","The correct answer is **A: Ifuru cheri (Cherry blossoms)**.

The text states that ""Nlere ifuru Cheri, nke a maara dị ka hanami..."" which translates to ""Cherry blossom viewing, which is known as hanami..."". Therefore, ""hanami"" refers to the viewing of cherry blossoms.
"
Ònye haziri nnọkọ mbụ maka ikiri ifuru cherry?,"The correct answer is **C: Alaeze Ukwu Japan**.

The passage states: ""Na Japan, Onye eze Emperọ haziri mmemme mkprụ osisi cheri izizi maka naanị ya na ndị otu ndị ọzọ na-ahụ maka ọchịchị Ụlọ ikpe etiti.""  ""Onye eze Emperọ"" translates to ""Emperor of Japan.""

"Kedu n'ime njirimara ndị na-esonụ nke Jerusalem nwere ike ịrata ndị njem nlegharị anya, dịka akụkụ Akwụkwọ Nsọ si kwuo?","The best answer is **D: Ọtụtụ ebe akụkọ ihe mere eme**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Obodo ochie ahụ nọ n’ụmụ Ugwu Judịa nwere akụkọ ihe gara aga ruru ọtụtụ puku afọ nke na-adọrọ mmasi."" This directly supports the idea of Jerusalem having many historical sites.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Okpukpe dị mkpa maka obodo:** While the passage mentions Jerusalem is important to three monotheistic religions, it doesn't emphasize that *religion itself* is a primary draw for tourists in the way historical sites are.
* **B: Ịbụ isi obodo Israel:** Being the capital is important, but the passage focuses more on the *historical and cultural attractions* that make it a tourist destination.
* **C: Onyinye n'ihe gbasara omenala:** The passage mentions cultural sites, but ""onyinye"" (blessing/divine favor) isn't a concrete characteristic that tourists would readily associate with the city.

Therefore, the abundance of historical sites is the most directly supported and relevant answer based on the passage.



"
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-akọwaghị dịka njirimara Jerusalem?,"The correct answer is **B: Ike ọchịchị**.

Here's why:

The passage describes Jerusalem's historical significance, religious importance, and cultural aspects. It highlights its role as a center for tourism and a place of religious pilgrimage for three major faiths. However, it *doesn't* mention its political or governmental role.

The passage mentions:

*   **Akụkọ na-akpali mmasị (Historical tales):**  Explicitly stated as having a history spanning centuries.
*   **Mkpa okpukperechi (Religious significance):**  Mentioned as a holy city for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.
*   **Ebe akụkọ ihe mere eme (Historical sites):**  Specifically mentioned as being part of the Old City.

Therefore, the passage fails to mention **Ike ọchịchị (Political power)**.

Here's why:

The text states that the Conservation Fee Card gives you access *to the parks it covers in South Africa*.  It also says Kruger National Park is one of the major tourist attractions in Southern Africa. Therefore, someone *only* visiting Kruger National Park wouldn't benefit from the Conservation Fee Card, as they wouldn't be accessing other parks it covers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Onye nlegharị anya nke chọrọ ileta SANParks niile:**  The text *does* say the card covers SANParks in South Africa.
* **C: Onye ọbịa na mmefu ego siri ike na-echegbu onwe ya maka ụgwọ ogige:** The text mentions the Conservation Fee Card *helps* with fees, implying it's beneficial, not that someone wouldn't benefit.
* **D: Onye njem nlegharị anya chọrọ ịhụ ogige Kruger National Park yana opekata mpe otu ogige ọzọ:** This person *would* benefit from the card since it covers multiple parks.

Here's why:

* The text states that Kruger National Park is considered the *best* of South Africa's national parks. This directly contradicts the statement that it's the *smallest*.
* Options A, B, and D are all supported by the information in the text."
"N'ime akụkụ ndị dị n'elu ugwu ahụ, olee nke nwere ike itinye ndị na-arị elu n'ihe ize ndụ?","The correct answer is **C: Obere ọgba (Small ravine)**.

The passage specifically mentions ""Obere ọgba dị nso n’elu a na-aga-agaferịrị, ọ dị ala ma na-agbatị karịa"" which translates to ""A small ravine is nearby, it is low and getting steeper.""  This directly describes a potential danger for hikers.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mmiri ozuzo ihu igwe (Wet, slippery rocks):** While the passage mentions slippery rocks (""oke ndị kara kpodaa""), it doesn't explicitly call them dangerous enough to cause a life-threatening situation.
* **B: Nzọụkwụ e ji nkume mee (Rope walkways):** The passage states that ropes are *installed* on the path to help people stay safe.
* **D: ígwè cables (Steel cables):** The passage mentions steel cables (""eriri igwe"") for safety, but the ravine is a more immediate and direct danger.

Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a na-ezighi ezi gbasara nkọwa akụkụ nke ịrịgo ugwu Machu Picchu?,"The correct answer is **B: Na ngalaba steepụ, enweghị aka aka**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ọtụtụ okwute n'okporo ụzọ, na mpaghara ala nke eriri igwe na - enye aka ijide onwe gi ofuma."" (Many ropes are along the path, and in the lower area of the cable car, it gives you support.) This directly contradicts option B, which says there are no handrails on the steep sections.

Let's look at why the other options are *likely* true based on the passage:

* **A: Ọbụna ndị nwere ahụmahụ na-arị elu nwere ike ịnwe ume iku ume:** The passage mentions the climb is strenuous (""siri ike kwesịrị iji ihe dị ka nkeji iri anọ na ise rigoo ya"") and describes the terrain as steep and potentially frightening (""oke ndị kara kpodaa""). This suggests even experienced hikers might struggle.
* **C: N'elu ugwu, ị ga-agarịrị n'ọgba:** The passage mentions a small, steep ravine (""obere ọgba dị nso n’elu a na-aga-agaferịrị"") that you have to cross.
* **D: Mgbe mmiri na-ezo, akụkụ ndị steepụ na-adị ize ndụ:** The passage says, ""Mgbe mmiri na-ezo, akụkụ ndị steepụ na-adị ize ndụ."" (When it rains, the steep sections become slippery.)



Therefore, option B is the only statement directly contradicted by the text.

"Kedu otu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe a ma ama na nri Majorcan, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si dị?","The correct answer is **C: Ọka (Cabbage)**.

The passage explicitly states that Majorcan cuisine relies on ""achịcha, akwụkwọ nri na anụ (tụmadị anụ ezi), ma na-eji mmanụ oliv mgbe niile"" (potatoes, vegetables, and meat (genuine lamb), and always using olive oil). While vegetables are mentioned as being used, cabbage (ọka) is not specifically listed as a staple or well-known ingredient in Majorcan cuisine based on the provided text.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Anụ ahụ (Meat):** The passage directly mentions ""anụ (tụmadị anụ ezi)"" which translates to ""meat (genuine lamb)"" as a key element.
*   **B: Achịcha (Potatoes):** Potatoes are explicitly listed as one of the staples.
*   **D: Vegetables:** The passage mentions ""akwụkwọ nri"" (vegetables) as a key component.

Kedu otu eziokwu gbasara nri abalị hangi nke ihe ndị dị n'akwụkwọ a na-akwadoghị?,"The correct answer is **B: Wellington na-enye hangi nke ejiri okwute ọkụ mee**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ọtụtụ ebe na Rotorua na enye jiotemal hangi, mana enwere ike ilele hangi ndị ọzọ na Kraịstchọch, Wellịntụn na ebe ndị ọzọ.""  This means Wellington *does* have hangi, but the text doesn't specify that they use geothermal heat.  It just lists it as a place where you *can find* hangi.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** The text says *okwute* (rocks) from the hot heat are used, not nkume (clay).
*   **C:** The text explicitly states ""A na-ejikarị hangi ahụ isi nri abalị,"" meaning hangi is commonly used for evening meals. This statement is correct according to the text.
*   **D:** The text directly says ""Ọtụtụ ebe na Rotorua na enye jiotemal hangi"" (Many places in Rotorua offer geothermal hangi). This statement is correct according to the text.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-akpọghị usoro ikpo ọkụ hangi olulu ọkọlọtọ?,"The correct answer is **A: gas**.

Here's why:

The passage describes traditional hangi cooking, which relies on underground ovens heated by hot rocks. The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **""A na-esi Nri Hangi n’ime olulu dị ọkụ nọ n’ime ala.""** (The hangi is cooked in a hot oven inside the ground.)
*   **""A na-eji okwute si n'ọkụ eme ka olulu a dị ọkụ...""** (Hot stones are used to heat the oven...)
*   **""...maọbụ n'ụfọdụ ebe ọkụ si n'ime ala n'eme ka ala dị ọkụ n'onwe ya.""** (...or sometimes the heat from within the earth makes the ground hot on its own.)

Gas is a modern heat source and not part of the traditional hangi method described. The other options (hot rocks, geothermal heat) are directly mentioned as sources of heat for a traditional hangi."
Kedu ihe nwere ike nweta nkwanye ùgwù nke onye mọnk ma ọ bụ onye nọn?,"The correct answer is **A: Na-etinye ihe mkpuchi mara mma**.

This means bringing a well-made covering (sket) is the way to earn a smile from the monk or gatekeeper. The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: Ubu gi ekpuchiriwo** - While covering the upper body is required, it's not specifically what earns the smile.
* **C: Na-ewere blanketị site na ebe obibi ndị mọnk** - The passage suggests *bringing your own* covering, not taking one from the monastery.
* **D: Na-eyi uwe mwụda dị elu karịa ikpere** - The passage states monks want men to wear trousers that cover the knees, not elaborate robes.



"
Kedu uwe ndị a na-atụghị anya ka a ga-enye maka mbinye ego site na ebe obibi ndị mọnk? ,"The correct answer is **C: Uwe elu** (Loose-fitting clothing).

The text states that women entering a monastery should wear skirts that cover their knees and cover their chest.  Men are expected to wear trousers that cover their knees.  It also mentions that loose-fitting clothing is acceptable if you don't have the proper garments.  Therefore, ""loose-fitting"" or ""wide"" clothing is what's expected.

"Mgbe ọ na-eme njem n'akụkụ ụfọdụ nke Antarctica, olee mgbe onye njem ga-enwe ohere kacha mma ịhụ kpakpando?","The correct answer is **C: Oge oyi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọ bụrụ na ị leta ụmụ ebe Aktik ma ọ bụ Antatik n'ime oge oyi ị ga-enwe ahụmihe nke abalị pola..."" (If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you will experience polar nights...)  It also mentions that polar nights create the best opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis (and Aurora Australis in Antarctica) because the sky is darker.  And finally, the passage states that polar nights are common in the Arctic and Antarctic because those regions are uninhabited and have little pollution.

Therefore, the passage directly links winter (the polar night) with the best opportunity to see penguins. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided."

Here's why:

* **Satellite phones rely on a clear line of sight to orbiting satellites.** Anything blocking that line (buildings, mountains, dense foliage, etc.) will prevent the phone from connecting.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọ bụrụ na ntọala dị oke anya (If the base is very remote):** While remoteness can be a factor, the *direct* issue isn't just remoteness, but whether the satellite phone can *see* a satellite.  A remote base could still have a clear view of the sky.
* **C: Ma a ga-eji ya mee ihe n'èzí (But it will be used outdoors):**  Using it outdoors doesn't guarantee a connection.  You still need a clear view of the satellites.
* **D: Ọ bụrụ na ozi na-akpọ maka ụfọdụ data (If the call is for some data):** This is irrelevant to the ability to make a satellite call.  The ability to make a call depends on connectivity.

Here's why:

* **The passage specifically mentions that satellite phones are useful for sailors and explorers who need communication in areas without cellular coverage.**  Njem nlegharị anya ụgbọ mmiri is a prime example of such an area.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mgbe ị na-eleta obodo na ezumike:**  While satellite phones *can* be useful in remote areas, it's not the primary reason they're used. Cellular service is often available in populated areas.
* **C: Mgbe achọghị ka iji data dị anya:** The passage states that satellite phones are used for both voice and data.  Therefore, this isn't a good reason.
* **D: Mgbe o yikarịrị ka ị ga-enwe mkpuchi mkpanaka zuru oke:** This is the *opposite* of when a satellite phone is needed. Satellite phones are used when cellular coverage is *unavailable*.

E hiwere Transnistria Republic n'ihi esemokwu nke kedu n'ime ndị a?,"The correct answer is **C: Asụsụ**.

The text states that Transnistria seceded in 1994 after a dispute, and it implies this dispute was related to language, as Romanian is the official language but Russian is commonly used. This linguistic difference is a common factor in conflicts in the region.

While the other options *could* be contributing factors in broader geopolitical contexts, the provided text directly links the secession to a dispute that arose after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the differing language usage.

"N'adịghị ka ndị Moldova ndị ọzọ, olee otu n'ime ihe ndị a pụrụ iche na Transnistria Republic?  ","The correct answer is **C: Nnabata UN**.

Here's why:

* The question asks about something *unique* to Transnistria.
* The text states that Transnistria has a government and currency but is *not recognized by any UN member state*. 
* The other options are not unique to Transnistria:
    * **A: Asụsụ:** Romanian and Russian are spoken in Moldova as a whole.
    * **B: Okpukpe:** Orthodox Christianity is the dominant religion in Moldova.
    * **D: Ego:** Transnistria has its own currency, but many unrecognized states have their own currencies.

Therefore, the lack of UN recognition is the most distinguishing characteristic of Transnistria mentioned in the provided text."
Edemede a na-atụ aro oge dị mma iji gaa Montevideo ma ọ bụrụ na ịchọrọ ịnọpụ na ikuku?,"The correct answer is **A: N'oge oyi nke Northern Hemisphere**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Montevideo dị na ndịda Iquetọ, ọ bụ oge ọkọchị ebe ahụ mgbe oge oyi dị na Ebe ugwu Emisfee ma n'otu aka ahụ."" This means it's summer in Montevideo when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, if someone wants to escape cold weather, they should visit Montevideo during the winter of the Northern Hemisphere.

Here's why:

* **The passage focuses on artistic expression:** The text discusses the nature of art, how it can be used to express emotions, and the evolution of artistic styles.  It highlights that even seemingly destructive art can be a form of expression.
* **The question asks about the connection to famous artists:** The question implies that the ability to express oneself creatively, even in unconventional ways, is more closely associated with famous artists than with other concepts.  
* **Why other options are less suitable:**
    * **A: Ihe omume metụtara ihe odide (Literary Trends):** While art and literature are related, the passage doesn't primarily discuss literary trends.
    * **C: Mgbidi dị n'ihe onwunwe ọha na-achọghị (Walls in private property that are not desired):** This refers to physical barriers, which isn't the core topic of the passage.
    * **D: Mkpado enweghị ike ịgụ (Unreadable inscription):** This deals with text/inscription, not broader artistic expression.

Therefore, the most fitting answer is **B: Ide ederede (Artistic Expression)** because the passage fundamentally revolves around this concept and its connection to the expression of ideas.

Kedu ihe ụfọdụ ndị bịaranụ chere na ọ bụ akụkụ dị mkpa nke ahụmahụ na ememme egwu?,"The correct answer is **B: Ogige ndị dị nso**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""mabụ ụfọdụ n’ime ndị bịara na-ewe ya otu akụkụ dị oke mkpa nke ahụmihe ahụ.""  It also says you need to enter a ""camp"" or ""lodging"" near the performance to be close to the performers.  This implies that the lodging/camp is considered an important part of the experience because it puts you *close to the action*.

Option B, ""Ogige ndị dị nso"" (Being close to the stage), directly reflects this.  The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: ọnụnọ nke obere ụmụaka** (Presence of small children): The text mentions lodging for families with young children, but doesn't suggest the children themselves are a key part of the experience.
*   **C: ịrụ ọrụ egwu abalị** (Post-performance socializing):  The passage doesn't mention socializing after the performance.
*   **D: Na-abịa ngwa ngwa** (Arriving quickly): The passage doesn't mention arriving quickly.

"Kedu ihe ndị na-eme ememme kwesịrị ibute ụzọ ma ọ bụrụ na ha chọrọ ịtọ ụlọikwuu nso n'akụkụ egwu ahụ, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Ịhapụ na mgbede (Arrive early)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the seating area near the stage fills up quickly. Therefore, arriving early is crucial to secure a good spot. The other options aren't directly supported or implied by the text:

*   **B: ibi n'ime agbata obi nwere enyi (Show kindness and respect)** - While important in general, it doesn't address the practical issue of seating.
*   **C: Na-ama ụlọikwuu pụọ n'ụlọ (Bring chairs from home)** - The passage implies that chairs are available at the venue, so bringing your own isn't necessary.
*   **D: Na-abịa ngwa ngwa (Come quickly)** - While arriving early is good, ""come quickly"" suggests rushing, which isn't the same as arriving early and allowing time to settle.

Therefore, arriving early is the most logical step to take to secure seating near the stage."
"Ebee na ugwu New Mexico ndị njem nleta kwesịrị izere mgbe ha na-achọ ndụ abalị, dị ka akụkụ ahụ si kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: ụlọ mmanya agbata obi (Casinos)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while it's difficult to find information about post-colonial life in pueblos, many casinos (especially those near Albuquerque and Santa Fe) are investing in online gambling.
* Importantly, it warns that **small-town casinos are *not* good places for a newcomer to stay.**
* The passage then mentions the issue of motorcycle accidents during the rainy season and the resulting impact on small-town hotels.

Therefore, the passage highlights casinos as a place to avoid for newcomers seeking a life in New Mexico. The other options are not mentioned as problematic in the context of choosing a place to live.
"
"Ebee n'ebe ugwu New Mexico onye njem nwere ike ịhụ ihe ntụrụndụ ndị a ma ama, ọ bụrụ na nke ahụ bụ ihe ederede na-ekwu?","The correct answer is **A: awa abụọ site na Albuquerque, na cha cha**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that many casinos listed offer online gambling, particularly those near Albuquerque and Santa Fe.
* It also mentions the problem of illegal gambling operations in smaller pueblos.
* Therefore, the ""famous"" gambling locations likely refer to the casinos near Albuquerque and Santa Fe, which are approximately two hours away from Albuquerque.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Na pueblo dị anya:** The passage implies that smaller pueblos are not good places for first-time gamblers.
* **C: Ụlọ cha cha dị nso na Sante Fe:** While there might be casinos near Santa Fe, the passage doesn't specifically highlight them as the ""famous"" ones.
* **D: N'ụlọ mmanya dị n'ógbè ahụ:** The passage discourages staying at smaller pueblos' inns.

Kedu ụdị mmanya ndị njem nlegharị anya na mmefu ego siri ike ga-achọ ịnọpụ na ya?,"The answer is **C: Mpaghara ime biya**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Maka ndị Australia, kọfị 'flat white' bụ ihe ala ọzọ. Shọt blak bụ 'espresso', cappuccino na-ebu nnukwu krim abịa (ọ bụghị froth), ha na-añụ tii na-etinyeghị mmiri ara ehi. Chokoleeti ọkụ a ruru ogo nke Beljiọm. **Mmanya mkprụ osisi dị ọnụ mana ha amaka.**""

This suggests that fruit juices are expensive. The passage also recommends bottled water as a readily available option if you're thirsty. While Australian coffee is mentioned, the question asks about drinks for travelers on a tight budget. Bottled water is a budget-friendly choice, and the passage highlights that bottled water is easy to find. The text doesn't specifically point to Australian drinks as the *best* budget option, but rather suggests being prepared with bottled water.

Therefore, the best answer is **C: Mpaghara ime biya** as a way to prepare for the trip.

"
Kedu n'ime iwu ihe ọṅụṅụ ndị a nwere ike ịghọtahie onye na-echere na ọnọdụ a kọwara n'amaokwu a?,"The correct answer is **D: Flat white**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions that ""For Australians, the coffee 'flat white' is another staple."" The passage then goes on to describe what a flat white *is* - a type of coffee.  The other options are either descriptions of types of beer or wines that are mentioned but not specifically tied to someone's personal preference in the way the flat white is to Australians.



"
"Kedu ebo malitere oge ọchịchị, nke were narị afọ atọ?","The correct answer is **D: Ndị Spanish**.

The passage states: ""Ndị Spen bidoro oge ọchịchị ike nke digidere ruo narị afọ atọ."" (The Spanish began a period of rule that lasted for three hundred years.)
"
"Kedu ụzọ kacha mma iji merie onye Parisi, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Gosi omume ịpụ apụ**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Ụzọ kachasị mma iji na-aga n’ihu n’ime Parii bụ na ị nọ n’omume gị kachasị mma, na-eme ka onye bụ """"bien élevé"""" (a zụrụ nke ọma).""  ""Bien élevé"" translates to well-bred or well-mannered.  Option D, ""Gosi omume ịpụ apụ"" (Show good manners), directly aligns with this.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Gbalịa ịmụta echiche ndị Parisi** While understanding the culture is helpful, the passage focuses on *behavior* rather than intellectual understanding.
* **B: Gosipụta mmesi obi ike**  The passage suggests politeness and refinement, not necessarily boldness.  Excessive confidence might be viewed negatively.
* **C: Nwee nkwanye ùgwù**  While politeness can involve respect, the core emphasis is on outward behavior and adhering to Parisian norms.



"
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị àgwà ndị Parisi, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **C: Egwuregwu egwu (Dancing)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Parisians are known for their ""sharp tongues"" and being ""bien élevé"" (well-bred). It also says that rudeness is easily forgiven if you show some ""usual courtesies"" (nruweisi nkịtị).  The text specifically implies that being well-bred is the key to navigating Parisian society.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Mpako (Snobbery):**  The text explicitly mentions Parisians having a ""snobbish"" attitude.
* **B: Ịgba aghara (Rudeness):** The text states that rudeness is *easily forgiven* if you show courtesies. This implies that rudeness is something that *can* happen, aligning with the idea of Parisians having a sharp tongue.
* **D: Mberede (Impulsiveness):** While not directly stated as a defining characteristic, the idea of needing to be ""bien élevé"" suggests a certain level of decorum and perhaps not being overly impulsive.

Therefore, **dancing** is the least related characteristic mentioned in the text regarding Parisian behavior. It's not mentioned at all and doesn't fit with the emphasis on being well-bred and having a sharp tongue.



"
Kedu uru dị na ịnya klaasị mbụ na MetroRail na Cape Town?,"The correct answer is **C: E jiri ya tụnyere tiketi klaasị atọ, ọ dị obere ọnụ.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""MetroPlus ka mma maka ezumike ma nwekwaa ọnụ ọgụgụ ndị mmadụ pere mpe karịa, mana ọ dịtụ ọnụ karịa; n'agbanyeghi, ọ ka dị ọnụ ala karịa akwụkwọ njem metro na Yurop.""  This directly implies that while MetroPlus is more expensive than the third class, it's *cheaper* than metro tickets in Europe.  This suggests it's a good value for the level of service.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ụgbọ oloko ahụ na-ebute ụzọ:** The passage doesn't mention that MetroPlus trains have priority boarding.
* **B: ọnụ ọgụgụ dị nta nke ndị mmadụ:** The passage states MetroPlus has *more* passengers than the third class.
* **D: Ọnụ ego ya na nke tiketi ụgbọ oloko:** The passage mentions MetroPlus tickets are cheaper than European metro tickets, not directly comparing its price to the third class ticket.



"
"Kedu ihe dị n'ọdụ ụgbọ oloko ọ bụla na Cape Town, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **D: Ndị nkuzi nke mbụ na nke atọ**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụgbọ oloko ọ bụla nwere ma MetroPlus ma Koochi gasị; koochi MetroPlus ndị ahụ na-anọkarị n’ọdụ nke ụgbọ oloko kacha nso na Cape Town.""  This directly translates to: ""Every train has both MetroPlus and Koochi trains; the MetroPlus coaches are usually located in the front of the train closest to Cape Town.""

Therefore, the answer is that the front of each train contains the ""ngalaba nke izizi"" (MetroPlus) and the ""ngalaba nke atọ"" (Metro).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ụgbọ ala metro nke na-ebuchaghị ibu** (Underground metro that doesn't carry a heavy load): The passage refers to trains, not underground metro systems.
*   **B: otu ọnụahịa maka ụdị tiketi abụọ ahụ** (One price for both ticket types): The passage doesn't mention ticket prices.
*   **C: ọkwa klaasị atọ dị iche iche** (Three different class levels): The passage doesn't mention different class levels.



"
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-agaghị ekwe omume ka ahụhụ anụmanụ mee?,"The correct answer is **B: Allergy adịla njọ (Allergy doesn't worsen)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes the dangers of pests, including their ability to cause allergic reactions that can be severe and even life-threatening. Options C and D are also dangers outlined in the passage. However, the passage explicitly states that pests *can* cause allergic reactions to worsen, making option B the incorrect statement.

Let's look at why the other options *are* possible:

*   **A: Mee otu n'amaghị ama (Act unnoticed):** The passage mentions pests hiding and causing problems without being seen.
*   **C: Ọrịa na-agbasa (Spread disease):** The passage states that pests can carry venom or disease.
*   **D: Mepụta ike na-egbu mgbu (Produce lethal force):** The passage mentions that frightened animals can attack and potentially kill people.



Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the information given in the passage is that allergies won't worsen."
Ebee ka m nwere ike nweta kaadị ekwentị akwụgoro ụgwọ?,"The correct answer is **C: ụlọ ahịa nkuku**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ahịa nkuku juputara na kaadị mkpọtụ ekwentị akwụgo ụgwọ enwere ike iji site na payphone ma ọ bụ igwe nkịtị."" This directly indicates that you can find prepaid phone cards in grocery stores. The other options are not mentioned as sources for these cards.
"
Kedu otu ọ ga-esi kwe omume ịnata ọnụego oku kacha mma ụfọdụ kaadị na-enye?,"The best answer is **B: Site n'enyemaka nke ọnụọgụ ego efu.**

Here's why:

* The paragraph states that some phone brands offer free calls to certain low-cost areas using special features.
* The question asks how to get the best rates on these cards.
* **""Site n'enyemaka nke ọnụọgụ ego efu""** (With the help of free credit) directly addresses the potential for free or reduced-cost calls offered by these special features.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Naanị ụfọdụ mba nwere ike ịnweta ha** (Only some countries can access them): The paragraph doesn't mention geographical restrictions as the main factor.
* **C: N'ime ụlọ ahịa nkuku** (In the shopping malls): While you *might* find these cards in shopping malls, it doesn't explain how to get the *best rates*.
* **D: Site n'ịkpọ oku na ekwentị akwụ ụgwọ ma nweta ụgwọ** (By calling a pay phone and getting credit): This is the opposite of what the question is asking – how to get *better* rates, not pay for them.

"Kedu otu n'ime osisi ndị a na-adịkarị obere na ogige ntụrụndụ mba nke Plitvice Lakes, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri kwuo?","The correct answer is **B: Oak**.

The text states: ""...e nwere ike ịchụso nwamba oke ọhịa na eruru, ya na ọtụtụ ụdị ndị ọzọ a na-ahụkarị.""  Oak is a type of hardwood, and the text mentions ""nwamba oke ọhịa"" (hardwood trees). While other options like Spruce and Fir are mentioned as common trees, Oak is the one specifically identified as a hardwood tree found there."
Kedu n'ime anụ ọhịa ndị a na-adịghị ahụkebe nwere ike ịhụ na Plitvice Lakes National Park?,"The correct answer is **D: Capercaillie**.

The passage specifically states: ""Ụmụ anụmanụ nke ebe obibi pụrụ iche nke anaghị ahụkarị dị ka anụ ọhịa bea ndị Yurop na-acha uri, agụ owulu, ugo, ikwiikwii, nwamba oke ọhịa linz, e nwere ike ịhụ nwamba oke ọhịa na eruru, ya na ọtụtụ ụdị ndị ọzọ a na-ahụkarị.""

Capercaillie (nwamba oke ọhịa na eruru) is listed as an example of a rare bird species found in the park. The other options are not mentioned in the text.
"
"Kedu ihe koodu mpaghara na-enyere aka n'ezie, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **B: Ike n'elu ahịa**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Uru ọ bara n'ezie bụ ịme ka ụlọ ọrụ gasị nwe nkwado ebe ahịa ha nọ; Ihe a na-ele anya bụ ị na-esere ego dịka mmiri.""  This translates to: ""The real benefit is to give the company a foothold in the market; What's being aimed for is to make money like water.""

This indicates the code region provides a strategic advantage (a ""foothold"") in the market, ultimately leading to profit. This is directly related to **market power (Ike n'elu ahịa)**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Mpempe diski (Disk copy):** The text says the code region doesn't affect disk copying.
*   **C: Usoro mgbochi mgbochi (Anti-debugging process):** The text explicitly states the code region doesn't prevent legal copying.
*   **D: Nnomi na-enweghị ikike (Unauthorized access):** While potentially related to security, the core benefit described is market advantage, not unauthorized access.



"
"Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara koodu mpaghara bụ ụgha ma ndị ụlọ ọrụ mgbasa ozi na-agbasa, n'akụkụ a?","The correct answer is **B: Ha na-enye aka n'igbochi piracy.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the company claims the code region prevents unauthorized copying (""igbochi mmegharị n'enweghi ikike mmegharị"").
* The passage also clarifies that the code region *doesn't actually prevent copying* but serves to establish the company's market presence. This highlights the misleading nature of their claim.
* The phrase ""esere ego dịka mmiri"" (charging money like water) implies that the added value of the code region is minimal, and the primary motivation is market control.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A chọrọ ha ka ha gbasaa ike ahịa (They want them to expand their market power):**  While true that it *helps* with market presence, it's not the *primary* claim they're making, and the passage focuses on the deceptive nature of that claim.
* **C: Ha na-enye aka maka ịtụgharị mkpụrụ ego (They help with revenue generation):** The passage directly contradicts this by saying they are essentially charging for something that doesn't provide real protection.
* **D: Ha anaghị enye aka n'ịkwụsị ohi (They don't help stop piracy):** The passage states that they *don't* stop piracy, but that's not what the company *claims*.  The deception lies in the claim, not the reality.

Therefore, the claim that the code region helps *prevent piracy* is the one the company is spreading, even though it's not accurate.

Kedu usoro a na-emekarị mgbe ị na-abanye na obodo gị?,"The correct answer is **A: Elele maka mbata na ọpụpụ**.

Here's why:

The provided text directly states: ""Dịka nnyocha mbata na ọpụpụ anaghị adịkarị ya maọbụ ọ dịrị n'ụdị a sịkwa ka emee mgbe ị batara n’ala nna gị..."" This indicates that customs checks for both imports and exports are a standard part of entering a country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ihe ekwuputara:** While declarations might be *part* of the process, they aren't the primary or most encompassing aspect mentioned in the text.
* **C: Ọnụ ahịa iwu kachasị nke ngwaahịa:** This is irrelevant to the process of entering a country.
* **D: Njikwa nke kọstọm:** While customs control is mentioned, the text highlights the *checks for imports and exports* as the main point related to entry.

Therefore, **A** is the most accurate answer based on the given text.
"
Kedu n'ime ozi ndị a ka ị kwesịrị ịma tupu ị gaa obodo gị?,"The correct answer is **D: Ma anabatara ma ọ bụ na ọ bụghị nke ngwaahịa ị na-ebu**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of knowing what you are allowed to bring into your country.  Specifically, it states: ""Kpachara anya ịmara ihe a ga-ekwe gị webata na nke iwu megidere ịwebata..."" (Pay attention to knowing what is allowed to be imported and what is prohibited...).

Option D directly addresses this by asking about the import status of the goods you are carrying. The other options are related but not as directly linked to the initial warning about customs and immigration:

*   **A:** While customs checks *might* happen, the passage highlights the *potential* for them, not a guarantee.
*   **B:** Over-declaration is a problem, but understanding what's allowed to be brought in is more fundamental.
*   **C:** Custom controls are mentioned as a potential source of problems, but knowing the import status is the primary concern.

Therefore, knowing if your goods are allowed in (or require specific documentation) is the most important thing to know *before* traveling to your destination.

This clearly indicates that the peaks (highest points) of the mountains are what allow climbers to find new routes.

This directly translates to ""Star Alliance handles the entire southern Pacific side from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti, which is a LATAM Airlines flight.""

Therefore, Star Alliance is the alliance that offers the longest flight path in the Southern Hemisphere according to the provided text.
"
"Na Southern Hemisphere, kedu mmekorita ụgbọ elu na-enyefefe oke osimiri kacha nta?","The correct answer is **A: Njikọ nke Stars**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sta Alayans na-ahụ maka ihe niile belụ sọọsọ akụkụ ọwụwa anyanwụ Pasifik Ndịda site na Santiago de Chile ruo Tahiti, nke bụ njem ụgbọelu LATAM Otuụwa."" This indicates that Star Alliance is the alliance that provides the only direct flight across the South Pacific.

Kedu ụlọ ọrụ nlegharị anya dochie Global Running Tours?,"The correct answer is **D: Njem na-agba ọsọ na Barcelona**.

The passage states: ""Ọ bidoro site na Running Tours Barcelona na Running Copenhagen..."" This means Running Tours Barcelona was one of the first to start, and thus a predecessor to Global Running Tours.
"
Ahịrịokwu ahụ na-ekwu na ole dị iche iche na-ahụ anya na-ejikọta site na njem na-agba ọsọ?,"The correct answer is **A: Anọ**.

The passage states: ""...ejikọta ọtụtụ ndị nweta mmemme ọsọ na kọntinent anọ.""  The phrase ""kọntinent anọ"" means four continents. Therefore, there are four distinct locations mentioned (Barcelona, Copenhagen, Prague, and others which are grouped together as ""anọ"" - four).
"
Kedu ka ndị njem nlegharị anya ga-esi bulie ohere ha nwere ịhụ agụ n'ụzọ doro anya?,"The correct answer is **A: Gaa na safari na-eje ije**.

Here's why:

This means that walking safaris (safari na-eje ije) allow for better observation of animals, even better than using binoculars or microscopes. The other options are incorrect based on the text.

"Kedu ihe ga-eme njem nlegharị anya dị ọnụ ala, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Na-achịkọta otu quartet**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""gbalịa zute ndị ọzọ ma wube otu òtù nke mmadụ anọ ruo isii maka ọnụego ka mma kwa-otu-onye."" This translates to ""try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people for a better price per person.""  A group of four to six people is a ""quartet"" or a small group.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-akpụ akpụ n'onwe ya** - This means traveling alone, which the passage discourages for better pricing.
*   **C: Soro onye ibe ya na-aga** - This means traveling with a companion, but doesn't specify the size of the group.
*   **D: Na-achịkọta ndị ọrụ nke opekata mpe isii** - This refers to a group of six, but the passage focuses on a group of four to six for optimal pricing.

Here's why:

The provided text states: *""gbalịa zute ndị ọzọ ma wube otu òtù nke mmadụ anọ ruo isii maka ọnụego ka mma kwa-otu-onye.""* This translates to ""try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people for a better rate per person.""

Therefore, two people traveling together (a group of four) would likely get the best per-person rate. Option C is the closest to this description.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ndị njem na-adị njikere ịkwagharị ụgbọ ala:** This refers to the availability of buses, not the ideal group size for the best price.
*   **B: Mmadụ atọ:** A group of three is less likely to get the same good rate as a group of four to six.

The text explicitly states: ""Ngosipụta ya ugboro ugboro n’egwu, ihe nkiri, edemede na omenaala ama ama nyere aka mee dị ka amata obodo ahụ na ihe nhụmaama ya n’ụwa niile.""  This directly translates to using various forms of media and culture to promote the city.

The other options are mentioned as *features* of San Francisco, but not as the *means* by which it gained international recognition.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that San Francisco has a large tourism infrastructure *and* numerous hotels, restaurants, and great venues for events.  This implies tourism is a significant part of the economy, not just a supporter of businesses.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the text:

* **A: Ọtụtụ ihe nkiri na akwụkwọ egosila ya:** The text says San Francisco has been repeatedly showcased in films, literature, and popular culture.
* **B: Enwere otutu nri Asia:** The text specifically mentions San Francisco being among the top ten cities for Asian food, listing Korean, Thai, Indian, and Japanese cuisine.
* **C: Ebe mgbakọ na ụlọ oriri na ọṅụṅụ dị ọtụtụ:** The text mentions ""great venues for events,"" implying many places for gatherings and entertainment.



Therefore, option D is the only statement that doesn't align with the information provided in the text.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that travel agents handle things like visa applications. If a traveler doesn't have a visa, the travel agent *cannot* help them with the necessary arrangements.  All the other options describe travelers who *would* benefit from a travel agent's services.

Here's why:

The passage states that a travel agent providing a letter of introduction helps travelers feel confident and know they have a place to relax upon arrival.  It also mentions the convenience of the travel agent handling changes to the itinerary *before* the hotel is involved.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Azụmahịa na hotels:** The passage focuses on the benefits *to the traveler*, not to businesses.
*   **C: Nchịkọta zuru oke:** While a letter of introduction can be *part* of a complete package, the primary benefit isn't a full collection.
*   **D: Na-eme ndoputa:** The passage mentions the travel agent can help with itinerary changes, but the main point is the initial convenience of having the letter of introduction.

* **The text explicitly states that while translation tools have improved significantly, they can still be inaccurate.** It mentions they are ""worthy of scrutiny"" and ""can be flawed.""
* **Options A, B, and C are all mentioned or implied in the text.** The text discusses translating text in real-time, translating official languages, and using smartphones for translation.

The text explicitly states: ""Otu n'ime ihe eji eme nke a bụ Ntụgharị Kegugulụ, nke na-enye ohere ime ntụgharị na-anọghị n'ịntanetị ka e budatachara asụsụ a chọrọ.""  This directly links the ability to do offline translation to advancements in translation software.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **B: Ekwentị ndị amamihe (Expert dictionaries)** - While helpful for translation, the text doesn't connect expert dictionaries to *offline* translation.
*   **C: Inweta ozi asụsụ (Audio language input)** - The text mentions voice-to-text recognition but not how that relates to offline translation.
*   **D: Ngwa ngwa nkọwa ngwa ngwa (Fast processing software)** - While fast processing is beneficial, the text highlights the software itself as the key factor in enabling offline translation.

Kedu n'ime ihe omume ndị a na-adịghị ebute oke mmiri?,"The correct answer is **A: Snow na-amị amị (Snowfall)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that some triggering events *involve* water, like ""mmiri ozuzo sinoo na-ezokwu ọzọ"" (water freezing and flowing again). Snowfall itself doesn't inherently involve water in the same way that melting snow or freezing water does. The other options – ""anyanwụ ọkụ"" (hot sun/sunshine), ""mmadụ"" (people), and ""snowfall ọzọ"" (additional snowfall) – can all contribute to melting snow and creating water, which is a trigger for avalanches."
"Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ebute oke mmiri ozuzo, dị ka ekwuru n'amaokwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **A: Na-enweghị arụ ọrụ, snow na-egbuke egbuke**.

The passage states: ""ngbe ụfọdụ ihe omume mbido na-akpalite bụ anyanwụ na-ekpo sinoo ọkụ, **mgbe ụfọdụ mmiri ozuzo sinoo na-ezokwu ọzọ**..."" This directly connects melting snow to the release of meltwater. Option A, ""Na-enweghị arụ ọrụ, snow na-egbuke egbuke,"" describes the process of snow melting, which is the cause of meltwater.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọ dịghị-snow mkpọda nke dị steepụ:** Steepness of the slope is related to avalanches, not the release of meltwater.
* **C: Snow na-adaghị n'elu mkpọda dị nkọ:**  The steepness of the slope is related to avalanches, not the release of meltwater.
* **D: Ndị mmadụ na-emetụghị ya, snow:** The passage mentions humans as a potential trigger for avalanches, but it doesn't state that humans *don't* cause meltwater release.

"Mmiri na yogọt Kedu ihe bụ ihe ndabere nke curry, dị ka akụkụ ahụ siri dị?","The correct answer is **A: Mmiri na yogọt**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ụmụ mpaghara imeala nke Ebe Ugwu Indịa na Pakistan, a na-ejikarị yogọọt n'ime ụmụ kọrị; n'ime Ebe Ndịda Indịa na mpaghara ndị ọzọ dị n'akụkụ mmiri nke okpuru kọntinent ahụ, a na-ejikarị mmiri ara akị oyibo.""

This directly indicates that water and yogurt are the bases used in preparing curry, depending on the region. The other options are not explicitly mentioned as the primary base.
"
Kedu ihe curry a na-eji mmiri ara ehi aki oyi dochie oge ụfọdụ n'ebe ụfọdụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Yogurt**.

The text states: ""Ụmụ mpaghara imeala nke Ebe Ugwu Indịa na Pakistan, a na-ejikarị yogọọt n'ime ụmụ kọrị..."" which translates to ""The people of the foothills of the Great Indian Plateau in India and Pakistan often use yogurt in their curry.""

Therefore, yogurt is used in curry in some areas to achieve a certain texture (either thick or watery).
"
Gịnị kpatara ugwu Transantarctic ji dị mkpa iji rute ala dị larịị?,"The correct answer is **A: Ọtụtụ mgbe, McMurdo ọdụ na-emechi.**

Here's why:

The passage states the Norwegian Coastal Highway is a route *from* McMurdo Station to the South Pole.  If McMurdo Station is frequently closed, it would make the coastal highway a crucial alternative route to reach the South Pole.  The other options are not directly supported by the text.
"
Kedu ihe ọkọlọtọ na-egosi n'akụkụ okporo ụzọ South Pole?,"The correct answer is **C: Oghere snow kpuchie**.

The text states: ""Sno ya kpụkọtara ọnụ nwere ọtụtụ oghere nke e jiri ọtụtụ ọkọlọtọ sụjuo ma mee akara."" This translates to ""The snow is packed together with many openings that are marked with many flags.""  Therefore, the flags are on the snow.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ụzọ dị na McMurdo Station** - The text mentions McMurdo Station as a starting point, but not that the flags are located *at* the station.
*   **B: Na-ebu mmanụ ụgbọala na traktọ** - This describes how the sled moves, not what's on the surface of the route.
*   **D: Gburugburu mkpọda, akụkụ dị ize ndụ** - While the South Pole is a harsh environment, the text doesn't specify the flags are near glaciers or desolate areas."
Kedu ozi dị mkpa gbasara njem na South Africa nke a na-ahapụ na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Ihe achọrọ maka visa dị iche dabere na obodo ahụ.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Visa na-adà ọnụahịa dị iche site na mba ruo na mba ma metụta kwa site n’obodo i siri bịa."" (Visa costs vary from country to country and also depend on the city you are coming from.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Iji ụgbọ ala nyocha bụ ụzọ dị mma iji hụ saịtị ndị na-apụ apụ na mbụ:** While the passage *does* mention using a 4x4 vehicle for exploring remote areas, it doesn't say it's the *best* or *only* way to see off-the-beaten-path sites. It just highlights the necessity for certain areas.
* **C: Ihe fọrọ nke nta ka ọ bụrụ mba niile dị na South Africa nwere udo:** The passage directly contradicts this. It says, ""Ọ bụghị obodo niile gbara Sawụt Afrịka gburugburu kwụsiri ike dịka ha."" (Not all of South Africa is as well-developed.)
* **D: Ọ bụrụ na ịnya ụgbọ ala, a tụrụ aro 4x4:**  The passage states that a 4x4 is *recommended* for off-road travel, not that it's *required* if you're simply driving a vehicle.



"
"Kedu ihe a ga-ewere na ndụmọdụ na-ekwesịghị ekwesị, dabere na akụkụ ahụ, maka ndị njem nleta na-achọ ịnya ụgbọ ala gburugburu South Africa?","The correct answer is **A: Iwu ahụ nwere ike ịdepụta ngwa enyemaka mberede n'ime ụgbọ ala.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ihe ọchụchọ na Visa na-adà ọnụahịa dị iche site na mba ruo na mba ma metụta kwa site n’obodo i siri bịa. Mba ọbụla nwekwara iwu prụrụ iche nke na-ekwu ngwa mberede nke aghaghị idi n'ụgbọala."" This directly supports the idea that emergency provisions are part of the legal requirements for vehicle travel.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ọtụtụ ebe enwere ike iji ụgbọ ala mgbe niile, n'agbanyeghị na a tụrụ aro 4x4:** The passage explicitly mentions that 4x4 is *recommended* for off-road travel, implying it's not suitable for *all* places.
* **C: Njem ụgbọ ala dị mma maka ndị chọrọ ịpụ n'okporo ụzọ a kụrụ akụ:** While true, the passage frames the vehicle trip as a way to *see* the landscape, not specifically to explore remote areas.
* **D: Ọ bụghị mba niile dị n'Ebe Ndịda Africa bụ ndị kacha mma maka njem:** This is directly supported by the passage's mention of varying visa costs and different legal requirements in different countries.

Therefore, option A is the only one directly and accurately reflected in the provided text.

Kedu ihe ize ndụ nwere ike ịhapụ akpa gị n'echeghị ya n'akwụkwọ a?,"The correct answer is **D: Ndị ọchịchị nwere ike nyochaa ha ka ha bụrụ ịdọ aka ná ntị bọmbụ.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Akpa na-enweghị onye na-elekọta ha na-abụ ihe ebumnuche maka izu ohi ma na-adọtakwa uche ndị ọchịchị na-atụ egwu bọmbụ.""  This directly addresses the concern that authorities might treat unattended bags as bomb threats.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Enwere ike iwere ha:** While it *is* possible for bags to be taken, the passage focuses on the danger of leaving them *unattended*, not the act of someone taking them.
* **B: Ị nwere ike ịmalite iburu ọgwụ n'amaghị ama:** The passage warns against carrying drugs, not about accidentally starting to use them.
* **C: Mmadụ nwere ike imehie ha maka nke onye ọzọ:** While theft is mentioned, the primary danger highlighted is the reaction of authorities treating the bag as a bomb threat.



"
Kedu maka iji ọgwụ eme ihe na-ekwughị na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **D: Ọbụlagodi na ịnweghị ọgwụ n'ime akpa gị, ndị ọchịchị nwere ike ijide ha.**

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the dangers of carrying medication across international borders, regardless of whether it's prescribed or not.** It specifically mentions that even without medication, you could face severe consequences like lengthy imprisonment or even the death penalty in some countries.
* **Option D directly reflects this danger.** It highlights that possession of medication can lead to arrest and detention, even if you weren't intentionally trying to smuggle it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ndị mejọrọ nke mbụ na mba ụfọdụ nwere ike ị nweta ntaramahụhụ ọnwụ:** This is mentioned in the context of *smuggling* medication, not just carrying it. The passage's main point is the overall risk, not specifically the penalty for attempted smuggling.
* **B: Mgbe ị na-eme njem na mba ofesi, ekwesịrị ịgbaso usoro nchekwa ndị ọzọ:** While generally good advice for travel, the passage focuses specifically on the danger of carrying medication, not general safety measures.
* **C: Enwere ike iji nkịta zụrụ azụ ịchọpụta ọgwụ na-enweghị ịdọ aka ná ntị:** This is mentioned as a method of *smuggling* medication, not the general danger of carrying it. The passage's main point is the risk, not how smugglers might try to avoid detection.



"
Kedu ụdị ihe ọṅụṅụ na-adịghị akwadoro dị ka ihe ị ga-agbalị ime n'ụlọ mgbe ịnọrọ?,"The correct answer is **B: Kọfị**.

The passage states: ""Were isi kofi mejuputa ulo gi n’ututu were kwazia chamomile n’akwado ezumike mejuo ya n’abali."" This translates to ""Don't fill your house with coffee every day when you're trying to enjoy your rest."" This implies that the passage advises *against* having coffee readily available when you are trying to relax at home. Therefore, it doesn't recommend making coffee when you're trying to unwind.



"
"Ọ bụrụ na obodo gị nwere aha ọma maka ịbụ obodo a na-aṅụ mmanya, kedu n'ime ihe ndị a ka ị ga-aga mgbe ị nọ?","The correct answer is **D: Ebe a na-eri ihe na-eme tii chamomile.**

Here's why:

The passage states that if your town is known for its tea culture, you should go to a tea house or a place where you don't usually go to drink tea. Option D directly aligns with this advice, as it suggests a place where chamomile tea is served, indicating a tea-focused establishment.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Na mpụga agbataobi gị, enwere ụlọ ahịa kọfị:** While coffee shops exist, the passage emphasizes tea culture. A coffee shop doesn't necessarily indicate a town known for its tea.
*   **B: Na-echekwa maka smoothies ma ọ bụ ihe ọṅụṅụ:** This is too general. It doesn't specifically relate to tea culture.
*   **C: Ebe ị ga-aṅụ ihe ọṅụṅụ nke ị na-ezere:** This doesn't fit the context of exploring your town's tea culture.



"
Ebee ka ahụrụ ihe oyiyi nduru?,"The correct answer is **C: Na Eysturoy, agwaetiti ahụ**.

The passage states: ""Na yaadị ụlọ ụka, e nwere ụmụ nduru akpụrụ n’ofe ụfọdụ ili na-adọrọ mmasi."" This translates to: ""Near the church, there are children of the parish in some of the walls that are of interest.""  The church is located in Obodo Haldarsvik, which is on Eysturøi island. Therefore, the children were found on Eysturøi.

Option A is incorrect because it refers to the time taken to travel *to* the village, not where the children were found.
Option B is incorrect because it's not mentioned anywhere that the children were found in a place where noises are made.
Option D is incorrect because the passage states the children were *near* the church, not *inside* it.



"
Kedu ụdị visa ga-achọ ka mmadụ gosipụta nkwado ego zuru oke?,"The correct answer is **D: Visa ụmụ akwụkwọ**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Visa ụmụ akwụkwọ nwere ihe ọchịchọ dị iche ma usoro ngwa dị iche na nke onye njem nkịtị maọbụ visa ọrụ."" It also mentions the need for proof of financial support, which is a key requirement for student visas.
"
Kedu onye o yikarịrị ka ọ ga-achọ mgbakwunye visa ha?,"The correct answer is **C: Nwa akwụkwọ kọleji si mba ofesi**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that studying in a foreign country requires a different type of visa (a student visa) than a tourist or business visa.  It also mentions that student visas have different requirements and application processes.  Therefore, a student from another country would be the one most likely needing to obtain a visa for this purpose.
"
Kedu mgbe ọ dị mkpa ka ị kpachara anya maka anwụnta?,"The correct answer is **D: N'oge ụgbọala (While driving)**.

The question states: ""Karịchaa n'oge ọkọchị, Ị kwesịrị ịnọ na nche maka anwụnta ma ọbụrụ na I kpebie ịga mkpagharị n'ọhịa udummiri. Ọbụrụgodi na iji ụgbọala agbafe ọhịa udummiri, nkeji ole m'ole ụzọ ghere oghe mgbe ị na-aba ụgbọala ezuola anwụnta iso gị bata.""

Translation: ""During the rainy season, you should be vigilant for wildlife if you decide to go hunting in the forest. If you are driving a vehicle through the forest, how many times should you look for wildlife while driving to avoid hitting them?""

Therefore, the question is specifically about being vigilant *while driving*.



"
"Kedu ihe ị ga-akwụsị ime, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị, iji zere anwụnta mgbe ị na-eme njem na oke ọhịa?","The correct answer is **A: Ogologo oge ejiri na ọnụ ụzọ ụgbọ ala meghere** (Long time the canoe is closed).

Here's why:

* **The question states:** ""Karịchaa n'oge ọkọchị, Ị kwesịrị ịnọ na nche maka anwụnta ma ọbụrụ na I kpebie ịga mkpagharị n'ọhịa udummiri."" (During the rainy season, you should be careful of crocodiles if you decide to go fishing in the swamp.)
* **The question asks:** ""Kedu ihe ị ga-akwụsị ime, dịka akụkụ ahụ siri dị, iji zere anwụnta mgbe ị na-eme njem na oke ọhịa?"" (What should you do, as the text suggests, to avoid crocodiles when traveling in the swamp?)
* **The text implies that crocodiles are a concern during the rainy season.**  The phrase ""Ogologo oge ejiri na ọnụ ụzọ ụgbọ ala meghere"" (Long time the canoe is closed) means the canoe is not used often, suggesting it's closed up, likely during the rainy season when crocodiles are more active.  Therefore, avoiding using the canoe (and thus, being out on the water) is a way to avoid crocodiles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ịga njem n'oge okpomọkụ** (Going on a trip during the hot season) - The text specifies the *rainy* season.
* **C: Ka ị na-na-agagharị na mpaghara subtropical** (As long as you go fishing in subtropical areas) - The text mentions swamp fishing, not specifically subtropical areas.
* **D: Na-aga maka mkpagharị na ịhapụ ụgbọ ala ahụ n'echeghị ya** (Go fishing and leave the canoe without expecting it) - This is a dangerous action and would *increase* the risk of encountering crocodiles.



Therefore, **A** is the only option that logically follows from the given text and addresses the issue of avoiding crocodiles during the rainy season."
Kedu n'ime nkwupụta ndị a gbasara Sundarbans na-adakọghị na ozi dị na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **B: Ahịhịa na-ekpuchi ọkara nke mkpokọta mpaghara ya**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Sundarbans kpuchiri ohere km² 3850, nke mmiri maọbụ ala apịtị kpuchiri otu ụzọ n'ụzọ atọ ya."" This means the forest *doesn't* cover half of the total area. It's a mix of land and water.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the text:

* **A: A na-ahụ ụfọdụ n'ime oke ọhịa ndị siri ike fọdụrụ n'ebe ahụ:** The text mentions that, ""Ka mgbe 1966, ka Sundarbans ji buru ebe obibi nso anu ohia ana asi na aga enwe ihe dika 400 Royal Bengal tiger..."" This implies a significant presence of dense forest suitable for tigers.
* **C: Akara mangrove kacha ibu n'ụwa niile:** The text states, ""...anyị enwe ihe dika 30,000 mgbada nwere ntupo na mpaghara ebe ahu."" While not explicitly saying it's the biggest, the large number of mangrove patches suggests a very substantial mangrove forest.
* **D: Enwere mgbada ahụrụ anya ebe ahụ karịa agụ Bengal:** The text specifically mentions the presence of ""ihe dika 400 Royal Bengal tiger..."" indicating a significant tiger population.



Therefore, option B is the only statement that directly contradicts the information provided in the text.



"
Kedu mpaghara oke ọhịa dị na ala India?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National ọha ubi**.

The text states: ""Akụkụ nke oke ọhịa n'ime ókèala nke Indịa ka a na-akpọ Obianụọhịa Kemba Sundarbans."" This directly translates to ""A part of the forest in the territory of India is called the Sundarbans National forest.""
"
"Ònye, n'iburu n'uche paragraf ahụ, o yikarịrị ka ọ ga-enwe ma ọ dịkarịa ala iwu bụ isi nke asụsụ Bekee?","The correct answer is **A: Ndị nwere ike ikwukọrịta ma ọ dịkarịa ala n'asụsụ abụọ ọzọ.**

Here's why:

* **The paragraph emphasizes the global spread and varied usage of English.** It mentions that many people around the world know ""soft English"" (a colloquial or regional variation) and that people from different regions have distinct ways of speaking. 
* **This points to a broad familiarity with English as a second language**, which is implied in the paragraph. The paragraph doesn't specifically say English *is* the official language, but it does suggest that it's widely known and used.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Ndị ntorobịa (Teenagers):** The paragraph doesn't focus on teenagers specifically.
* **C: Ndị na-aga Toronto (People going to Toronto):** Toronto is just one example of a location mentioned.
* **D: Ndị agadi (Elderly people):** The paragraph doesn't focus on the elderly.

Therefore, the most accurate inference from the paragraph is that those who are comfortable speaking at least two other languages would likely understand and appreciate the nuances of English as presented.



"
"Kedu ihe nwere ike isi ike ikwu okwu, dabere na akụkụ ahụ?","The correct answer is **D: Slang mpaghara**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes regional variations in speech.** It highlights how people from different cities (Manchester, Boston, Jamaica, Sydney, Toronto) have distinct ways of speaking and expressing themselves, often using unique vocabulary and pronunciation. This is a hallmark of slang and regional dialects.
* **The passage mentions difficulty in ""calling up confidence""** which suggests a barrier to fluent communication stemming from unfamiliarity with local expressions.
* **Option A (ụda olu dị iche iche na nkebiokwu)** is too broad. While pronunciation and vocabulary are involved, the passage specifically points to *regional* differences.
* **Option B (Na-aza)** is unrelated to the passage's content.
* **Option C (Asụsụ e dere ede)** is not mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, the passage strongly suggests that **slang mpaghara** (regional slang) is the reason for communication difficulties.

"Kedu ihe atụ, dabere na paragraf ahụ, ga-akacha mma maka onye njem na-achọ ịnya ụgbọ ala site na ọdụ mpaghara?","The correct answer is **A: Onye njem ahụ na-aga Jakar ma zụtalarị tiketi tupu oge eruo**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states that buses to Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30. It also suggests buying a day ticket in advance, especially since the buses are busy. Therefore, the best course of action is to buy a ticket *before* 6:30-7:30 if you are traveling to Jakar.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Onye njem ahụ ga-apụrịrị n'elekere 7 nke ụtụtụ n'ihi na ha na-aga Bumthang:** While this is *a* possibility, the paragraph doesn't say you *have* to leave at 7:00 AM.  You could leave earlier and buy a ticket in advance.
*   **C: Onye njem kwesịrị ịpụ mgbe elekere 11 gachara n'ihi na ha na-aga Paro:** The paragraph mentions Paro and Punakha as nearby destinations accessible by taxi, not bus.
*   **D: Onye njem ahụ rutere n'ọdụ ụgbọ mmiri ahụ tupu elekere 6:20, onye njem ahụ na-aga n'ebe ọwụwa anyanwụ:** The paragraph doesn't provide information about arrival times, only departure times and travel routes.

"Site na ọdụ ụgbọ ala dị n'etiti mpaghara, kedu ndụmọdụ ị ga-enye onye njem chọrọ ịga ọwụwa anyanwụ?","The best answer is **B: Zụrụ tiketi tupu oge eruo**.

Here's why:

* **The prompt states:** Buses to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
* **The prompt also states:**  Buses run frequently throughout the day, but the earlier ones fill up.
* **The suggestion from local passengers:** Buy a day ticket in advance.

Therefore, buying a ticket *before* 8:30 AM ensures you secure a seat on one of the early buses to Jakar/Bumthang.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Mgbe 8:30 gasịrị, bọs na-apụ naanị:** This is incorrect. The prompt explicitly states buses run frequently.
* **C: Ọtụtụ ụgbọ ala na-apụ ụbọchị niile:** While true, this doesn't help the traveler *secure* a seat.  They'll still be competing with other passengers.
* **D: Ikekwe ụdị njem kachasị ezi uche dị na ya bụ ụgbọ ala nkekọrịta:** The prompt doesn't mention shared taxis as the best option.  It focuses on buses and day tickets.

Kedu otu n'ime okwu ndị a kpọtụrụ aha na-abụghị eziokwu gbasara Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ụgbọ elu enweghị ike iru ebe ahụ.**

The text explicitly states: ""Taa, Timbuktu obodo agụọ na-egbu, agbanyeghị n'ugwu ya na-eme ya otu ndọta ndị nleta, na o nwere otu ọdụ ụgbọelu."" This directly contradicts option C.

Here's why the other options are accurate based on the text:

*   **A: Omenala Arab na-emetụta ya nke ukwuu karịa mba ndị ọzọ:** The text says, ""Ọ bụ otu isi nkwụsịtụ n'oge Henry Louis Gates Ihe-ebube pụrụ iche PBS nke Ụwa Afrịka.

*   **D: Ọ na-aga n'ihu na-adọta ndị ọbịa nwere mmasị:** The text says, ""agbanyeghị n'ugwu ya na-eme ya otu ndọta ndị nleta"".

Therefore, the only inaccurate statement is that planes cannot reach Timbuktu."
Kedu nke eziokwu Timbuktu na-abịa bụ nke ziri ezi?,"The correct answer is **A: Site n'ụgbọelu, ị nwere ike iru obodo ahụ.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Kama ịbụ ogbenye, ọ dị egwu:** The text doesn't mention Timbuktu being frightening. It highlights its scholarly nature and attractiveness to visitors.
* **C: E jiri ya tụnyere obodo ndị dị nso, ọ nwere obere mmetụta ndị Africa:** The text actually says the opposite: ""Obodo ahụ dị n'ọdịiche kachasị ya n'ụmụ obodo nke mba ahụ fọdụrụnụ, n'ihi na o nwere karịa mmasị nke Arabik karịa otu Onye Afrịka."" (The city is most different from the people of the country remaining, because it has more interest in Arabic than any African.) This implies a significant African influence, albeit overshadowed by Arabic.
* **D: Obodo a abụghịzi ebe ndị njem nlegharị anya:** The text states: ""...na o nwere otu ọdụ ụgbọelu"" (...and it has one airport), implying it *is* accessible by air travel, a common method for tourists. It also mentions attracting visitors.

"Na mbụ, olee mgbe e zubere asọmpi Olympic nke oge okpomọkụ? ","The correct answer is **A: 2021 Ọgọọst**.

The text states: ""Engwuregwu Paralimpiks ga-eme site n'Ọgọọst 24 ruo na Septemba 5 2021."" (The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24 to September 5, 2021.)

"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ oge ọwa nwere ike ị bụ tọnadò?","The correct answer is **D: Mgbe o rutere ala**.

This clearly indicates that a tornado forms *when* the funnel reaches the ground.  While wind speed is a factor, the passage specifically links the formation of the tornado to ground contact.
"
Kedụ otu n’ime ndị a bụ ihe njirimara eji mara tonado?,"The correct answer is **A: Ha na-emepụta ikuku okirikiri ihe ruru 100-200 ga kwa awa.**

Here's why:

* The provided text explicitly states: ""Ha na ebupute oke ikuku (ọtụtụ mgbe maịlụ 100-200 kwa awa)..."" This directly matches option A.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ha na-agagharịkarị n’iji ibu n’anyì ezigbo arụ:** The text doesn't mention a connection to severe weather. While tornadoes *can* occur in severe weather, it's not a defining characteristic used to identify them.
* **C: Ha na-agbanwe bụrụ awa mgbe o metụrụ n’ala:** The text says they *begin* as funnel clouds and become tornadoes *after* hitting the ground. It doesn't mention them changing *to* tornadoes after an hour.
* **D: Ha na-agbanwe ọgbaraogo nke na-akwa akwapụ ikuku akwapụ:** This isn't a characteristic described in the text. While a funnel cloud might appear to be rotating, the text focuses on the wind speed and the lifting of debris.

"Dịka ihe paseeji kwuru, site n’ebe onye njem natara ndụmọdụ gbasara ọnọdụ ndọrọndọrọ n’ebemwega obodo ha?","The correct answer is **B: Site n’aka ihe ahụrụ egosipụtara n’ime ndụmọdụ njem ahụ.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ndị ndụmọdụ gasị bụ naanị obere nchịkọta nke ọnọdụ ndọrọndọrọ n’otu obodo...Uche ndị e gosipụtara na-esekarị n'elu, n'izugbe na ntọghasị dị ukwuu ma a tụnyere ya ozi ndị a kọrọ nke ọma dị ebe ọzọ.""

This means the travel advisories themselves are a collection of information about the safety situation, and that information is what travelers should rely on. The passage explicitly says the information *within* the travel advisories is what is being presented.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Site n’aka ndị ọchịchị nke obodo ahụ ha ga-aga hụ** - The passage says travel advisories are a *collection* of information, not a direct communication from the local government.
*   **C: Site n’aka ụmụafọ nke obodo ahụ ha ga-aga hụ** - The passage doesn't mention local children as a source of information.
*   **D: Site n’aka gọọmenti nke aka ha** - While the government issues the advisories, the passage focuses on the information *within* those advisories, not the government directly.



"
"Na mmemme nke ndụmọdụ njem, kedụ ihe ndị mbịambịa nwere ike ịhụ?","The correct answer is **D: Ozi akọwara gbasara ọnọdọndọrọ nke obodo ahụ.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Iji mee atụ, ndị Amerịka nọ na Mịdụl Ist nwere ike igabiga ihe dị iche n'ihe ndị Yurop maọbụ Arab ga-agabiga. Ndị ndụmọdụ gasị bụ naanị obere nchịkọta nke ọnọdụ ndọrọndọrọ n’otu obodo.""  This means travel advisories are about the *reported* conditions of a place, not a comprehensive or objective assessment.  They reflect the perception and information available, which is essentially ""ozi akọwara gbasara ọnọdọndọrọ nke obodo ahụ.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Metụtara nkagbu inshọransi:** While insurance is important, the passage doesn't focus on insurance specifically in the context of travel advisories.
* **B: Ụmụ nchịkọta dịkarịrị na mfe gbasara ọnọdụ ndọrọndọrọ nke obodo ahụ:** The passage states that the travel advisories are a *collection* of information, not necessarily a simple or easy assessment.
* **C: Metụtara inshọransi ahụike:**  Similar to A, the passage doesn't emphasize health insurance specifically in the context of travel advisories.

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agencies are a good option for those traveling to countries with different cultures and languages.  Option C directly reflects this by mentioning travel that showcases linguistic diversity.  

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nje nke ebe mgbakọ ọrụ n’obodo nke onye njem garala na mbụ:**  While travel agencies *can* book these, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as a key strength.
* **B: Njem izu-abụọ dị anya n’atụmatụ ego akpọrọaha:** The passage doesn't mention weekend trips or budget planning as a primary focus of travel agencies.
* **D: Njem ofesi mbụ nke onye njem:** This is irrelevant to the agency's purpose.

Here's why:

* The passage states that travel agencies have been around for a hundred years and can be a good option for travelers who want a more comfortable experience than past travel experiences.
* It also mentions that travel agents can offer opportunities for travel similar to what the traveler is looking for.
* The passage further advises to look at travel brochures and websites to find travel options.
* **Option A** directly aligns with the idea of using a travel agency to arrange a trip, especially if it involves flying to a destination. This is a standard use of a travel agency's services.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B:** While travel agents *could* help with unique, adventurous trips, the passage doesn't specifically focus on adventurous travel.
* **C:** The passage doesn't mention language skills as a primary reason to use a travel agent.
* **D:**  While travel agents can help with culturally similar destinations, it's not the core benefit highlighted in the passage.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ihe nwere ike i nyere onye njem aka gbanahụ mmegbu mgbe ọ na-aga ebe ọhụrụ ndịọzọ?","The correct answer is **D: Gbanahụ nhọpụta na mbanye (Adapt to new surroundings)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that traveling involves facing differences in various aspects of life – customs, laws, food, language, etc.  It warns against being unprepared and feeling lost or discouraged. The core message is about **adapting** to the new environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Na-atụ anya izugbe ga ndị yiri onwe ha dịka ebee ka ha siri bịa (Expect people to be like themselves where they are going)** - This is the opposite of what the passage advocates.  It highlights the *differences* to be prepared for.
*   **B: nke ị na-amachaghịInwe mmasị iji nwàlee nri (Not having interest in trying new food)** - While trying new food *is* part of adapting, the passage is broader than just food.  The main point is about adapting to *all* aspects of the new environment.
*   **C: Kwere n’otu iwu ahụ dịka ebee ka ha siri bịa (Agree to the same laws as where they are going)** - This is not necessarily true and can be problematic. Laws vary greatly between countries and cultures.  The passage isn't about blindly agreeing; it's about being aware of and adjusting to the existing laws.



"
"Dịka ozi dị na paseeji kwuru, kedụ ụdịrị onye nwere ike inata ọdachị ahụmiihe mgbe ọ na-aga mba ofesi?","The correct answer is **D: Onye nke nwere mmasị na mmụta.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that traveling involves experiencing things different from home – customs, laws, food, language, etc.  It explicitly states that being prepared for these differences will prevent frustration and disappointment.  This preparation is directly linked to a willingness to *learn* about new cultures and adapt to new situations.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Onye nke nwere mmasị n’ezigbo nri:** While food is mentioned, the passage isn't primarily about a love of food.
* **B: Onye nke nwere mgbalị n’ịgbanwe:**  While adaptability is important, the passage focuses more on proactively *understanding* the differences, which points towards a desire for learning.
* **C: Onye nke nwere mmasị keonwe ya:**  The passage doesn't mention interpersonal relationships as a core component of preparing for travel.

Kedụ otu n’ime nke akwadoghị ndọmọdụ maka ndị njem na-aga ikwalite obodo na oge mbụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Nweta iji mata fauna otuebe tupu ihie ụra n’ala ahụ.**

Here's why:

* **A: Nweta iji mata fauna otuebe tupu ihie ụra n’ala ahụ (Get to know the local fauna before going to sleep on the ground):** This is crucial for safety.  You need to be aware of potentially dangerous animals that might be present and avoid sleeping in a place where they could pose a threat.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kwụsị imefu ego na nri n’oge mbụ gị (Stop spending money on food during your first time):**  It's important to have sufficient food, especially when adjusting to a new environment. Cutting back too much could be detrimental.
* **C: Obere àkwà maọbụ àkwà mbugharị bụ ihe akwadoro ma ọ bụrụ n’ịga anọ n’ezi (Small blankets or moving blankets are recommended if you are going to sleep on the floor):** While blankets are helpful, focusing *solely* on blankets as a safety measure isn't the most important. Knowing the environment and potential dangers is paramount.
* **D: Tinye n’ụlọ nkwarị dị mma n’oge mbụ ịlọrutere (Put it in a good store as soon as you arrive):** This doesn't relate to the safety or comfort of a traveler adjusting to a new place. It's about shopping, not adapting to the environment.



Therefore, understanding the local fauna and taking precautions to avoid potential dangers is the most important initial step for a traveler adjusting to a new environment.



"
Kedụ otu n’ime ndị ana-akpọghị aha dịka ihe na-eme mmefu ego mgbe ana eme nkwalite obodo?,"The correct answer is **C: Matraasi maọbụ paadị maka ụlọikwuu (Matress or bedsheet for a hammock)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes how traveling to developing regions can be a significant financial burden. Option C directly relates to the passage's point about needing to prepare for basic comforts and potential discomforts when traveling to these areas.  Bringing a mattress or bedsheet for a hammock is a relatively inexpensive way to improve sleep and comfort while traveling and thus a good example of a cost-effective preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ǹkà-nri Keọdịda (Keopedia food):**  While food is a concern, ""Keopedia food"" isn't a recognized or typical item brought for travel preparations.
* **B: Ụmụ ọrụ dị mma (Good clothes):** Good clothes are important, but the passage focuses on basic comfort and shelter.
* **D: Ụmụ ụlọ nkwarị dị mma (Good quality shoes):** Like good clothes, shoes are important, but the passage's focus is more on basic comfort during travel and a cheap preventative measure.



"
"Kedụ otu n’ime usoro kehọrọ kachasị mma maka njide iwu nke nwere ike ichọ nṅomi keanahụ nke iwu ha, ma o nweghị ike inweta ohere n’intaneeti?","The correct answer is **C: Dosa kọpị echekwara na memori laptọọpụ ha.**

Here's why:

* **The original text emphasizes the importance of having multiple backups.** It specifically mentions storing a copy on a USB drive *inside* the laptop case (for situations where internet access is unavailable).
* **Option C directly reflects this instruction.** It states saving a copy on the laptop's memory.
* **Option A (Nye onye gị na ya so eme njem kọpị):** While helpful, this isn't a *backup* for the traveler themselves if the original is lost.
* **Option B (Na ezipụrụ onwe ha kọpị ozi-e):**  This refers to emailing a copy, which requires internet access – the very thing the question states is *not* available.
* **Option D (Na-eme nchekwa kọpị n’ “urukpu”):** While ""urukpu"" might refer to a safe place, it's not a standard technical term for a backup location. It's less specific and less reliable than saving directly on the laptop's memory.

Therefore, option C aligns perfectly with the instructions in the original text regarding offline backup methods.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, kedụ otu n’ime ndị a nke ana-enweghị ike igosipụta n’iwu ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Adreesì ozi-e onye inshọransi**.

The passage specifically states: ""Ha kwesịrị igosi adreesị ozi-e onye mkpuchi gị na akara ekwentị n'egosi obodo osi maka ndụmọdụ na nzọrọ."" This means the insurance company's email address is *not* required on the ID.  The other options are all mentioned as things that *should* be included.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, kedụ ebe ọjọọ gosipụtara nhakọ ihengosi ahụ nke e jikarị n’ọrụ?","The correct answer is **A: 6 x 6 cm nke adịghị mma**.

The passage states: ""Ụfọdụ igwe foto ọkara nwere akụkụ sentimita 6 n'elu 6, ya bụ negetiv nwere milimita 56 n'elu 56, ikwu ya kpọmkwem."" This directly identifies the 6x6 cm format as being a common negative size for certain types of cameras. The passage then goes on to describe the advantages of this format, implying it's a standard.  Therefore, it's not presented as ""bad"" or ""wrong,"" but rather a specific format used in medium format cameras. Options B, C, and D refer to 35mm film formats, which are discussed in the context of comparison to the 6x6 format.
"
Kedụ ụdị nke nhakọ ihengosi na-enye ngosipụta nke dịka nke yiri DSLR?,"The correct answer is **C: 56 x 56 mm ihengosi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ụfọdụ igwe foto ọkara nwere akụkụ sentimita 6 n'elu 6, ya bụ negetiv nwere milimita 56 n'elu 56, ikwu ya kpọmkwem.""  This directly links the 56 x 56 mm format to cameras that offer an image display similar to a DSLR. The other options are either too general (35mm) or describe a size (6x6cm) without specifically mentioning the display quality."
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, kedụ otu n’ime ndị a ga-abụ ụzọ dị mma iji bido azụmaahịa ederede njem?","The correct answer is **A: Mụọ nhakọ weebụ (Study travel websites)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ụzọ kachasị mfe ibido ọrụ edemede gbasara njem bụ mụta na webụsaịtị na-ede gbasara njem."" (The easiest way to start a travel writing career is to study websites that write about travel.)  Option A reflects this directly.

While the other options *could* be part of a larger strategy, they aren't the *easiest* or most direct starting point according to the passage.
"
"Mgbe Ị ga-ebido ime azụmaahịa ederede njem, kedụ ikikere ọzọ nke nwere ike ibu ụzọ mụchaa?","The best answer is **A: Ime blọg**.

Here's why:

* **Ime blọg (Blogging)** is an excellent way to learn and practice writing about travel.  You can write about your own experiences, research destinations, share tips, and build a following. It provides a platform to experiment with different writing styles and topics related to travel.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as ideal as a blog for *starting* to learn and build a travel writing career:

* **Na-eme nhakọ weebụ (Web scraping)** is a technical process of extracting data from websites. While potentially useful later, it's not a good starting point for learning *how to write* about travel.
* **Ziri ezi (Proofreading)** is an important step in any writing process, but it's not where you *learn* to write.
* **Nkepụta weebụsaịtị (Website templates)** provides a design structure for a website. Again, this comes *after* you know what you want to write about.

Therefore, starting a blog is the most logical and practical way to begin your journey in travel writing.

Kedụ ụdịrị ọnọdụ ihuigwe a na-achọpụtakarị ọrịa eriri afọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ekpomọọkụ ihuigwe (Fever)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Na kwa n’ebite aka mgbe onoghi n’ahu mmadu. Ebe enwere okpomoku ihu igwe nje n’etoo osiso ma kwa n’ebite aka mgbe onoghi n’ahu mmadu."" This translates to ""And it spreads by hand-to-hand contact. Where there is a fever, the germs are easily spread when touching people.""  Therefore, fever (okpomọọkụ ihuigwe) is a common symptom associated with these types of illnesses.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, ịgbananwụ o nwere ike nchekwa ahụ na gịnị?","The correct answer is **D: Delhi Belli**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions ""ihe otiti nke Delhi Belly"" as an example of a stomach bug caused by bacterial infections. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ụmụ nsogbu eriri afọ (Typhoid fever):** While mentioned as a stomach bug, typhoid fever is a systemic illness, not typically categorized as a ""Delhi Belly"" type of infection.
* **B: Geemụ otuebe (Cholera):**  Cholera is a severe diarrheal disease, but the passage doesn't specifically link it to the types of infections listed as ""Delhi Belly"" equivalents.
* **C: Ụmụ nsogbu nku ume (Respiratory illnesses):** The passage focuses on digestive illnesses (""stomach bugs"") and doesn't discuss respiratory illnesses.



"
Kedụ nke n’ime ndị a bụ ohere ọma nke njem mpaghara Schengen ahụ?,"The correct answer is **A: Gbanahụ ntinye akwụkwọ ọtụtụ visa**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọ bụrụ na ị nọrọ n'ọgbọ a, i nwere ike igafe oke ala ma zere nnyocha paspọtụ. N'otu aka ahụ, site n’inwe otu visa Schengen, ị kwesịghịzi itinye akwụkwọ maka visa otu n’ime mba ndịòtù Schengen nke ọ bụla iche, ya mere chekwa oge, ego na mmepe akwụkwọ.""  This directly highlights that a Schengen visa eliminates the need for multiple visa applications.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Emefu obere:** The passage doesn't mention any benefit related to smaller luggage.
* **C: Gbanahụ nnyocha njikwa ọtụtụ paaspọtụ:** While the passage mentions avoiding passport checks, it's a consequence of the Schengen area, not the primary *benefit* being discussed. The main benefit is visa simplification.
* **D: O nweghị paaspọtụ a chọrọ:** The passage assumes you *have* a passport. It doesn't address the issue of not having one.



"
Ihe nke agaghị inwe ike ịchọta n’ala ili nke Tutankhamun?,"The correct answer is **A: Ụfọdụ ihe ichọ mma (Some treasures)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ọtụtụ ihe oke ọnụ ahia nọ n'ili a anọghịzị na ya, kama e wegala ha na Ijipshịan Muziọm nọ na Kairo.""  This means many treasures *were not* found in Tutankhamun's tomb, and were removed. Therefore, you wouldn't find ""some treasures"" there.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isi mummi (A mummy's head)** -  Mummies were definitely present in the tomb. The passage mentions the intact mummy was a major point of interest.
* **C: Ngù mummi ga (A mummy mask)** - Mummy masks were also part of the burial process and would have been found with the mummy.
* **D: Ụba gasị (A sarcophagus)** - The tomb was designed with a sarcophagus to hold the mummy.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwụrụ, kedụ ebemwega Vancouver nke ga-adị mma n’ọnụahịa maka ndị njem? ","The correct answer is **C: Agwaetiti Bowen**.

Here's why:

The passage states that Agwaetiti Bowen is a destination offering outdoor activities and is easily accessible from Vancouver, including by ferry from Granville Island. 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Agwaetiti Granville** is a location *near* Vancouver, not a destination *for* Vancouver residents to escape to for outdoor activities.
*   **B: Oshimiri ahụ ruo na akụkụ Ihuigwe** is a general description of the coastline and not a specific destination.
*   **D: Whistler** is mentioned as a ski destination, but the passage focuses on Agwaetiti Bowen as a more general outdoor recreation spot."
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ ebemwega nke nwere ike inye ndị njem ezigbo ahụmiihe pụrụiche na Vancouver?","The correct answer is **A: Agwaetiti Bowen**.

The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island offers unique outdoor experiences such as boating, hiking, camping, and more. It highlights its proximity to Vancouver and its attractions like the Winter Olympics and skiing/snowboarding in winter, and hiking in summer. 

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Whistler:** While Whistler is a popular destination, the passage doesn't focus on it.
* **C: Ime obodo Vancouver:** The passage focuses on outdoor activities outside the city.
* **D: Agwaetiti Granville:** The passage mentions Granville Island as a ferry access point *to* Bowen Island, but doesn't describe it as a destination itself for unique experiences.

The passage states: ""N’oge udu mmiri (Nọvemba ruo Maachị), ibu mmiri ahụ ga-akarịkwu ma Ozizo mmiri ga-esikwa ike."" This directly answers the question about when visitors can see the waterfall at its most powerful, which is when the water is flowing most heavily.
"
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ ihe bụ ọdachi ịga na Mmiri okwute Victoria Falls n’etiti Nọvembà na Marchị?","The correct answer is **A: Nlele nke enweghị mgbochi nke Ọdịda mmiri.**

The passage states: ""N’oge udu mmiri (Nọvemba ruo Maachị), ibu mmiri ahụ ga-akarịkwu ma Ozizo mmiri ga-esikwa ike."" This indicates that the Victoria Falls is at its most powerful and impressive during this time, with a powerful, unobstructed flow of water. Therefore, the passage highlights the *unobstructed power* of the falls during the rainy season.
"
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ nke n’ime ndị a nke akwadoghị mgbe eji drone eme ihengosi?","The correct answer is **C: Na-achọgharị ikikere (Requesting permission)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọ bụrụ na iji drone arụ ọrụ, tulee n’oge dịka ihe e nyere gị ikikere iseta maọbụ ikikere maọbụ ikikere ọzọ gasị achọrọ.""  This means you should *seek* permission before flying a drone.  The other options are all things that are *mentioned as necessary* when flying a drone, according to the passage:

* **A: Na-atule n’ọdịniihu maka nnata ikikere iji mee ihengosi (Obtain permission in advance for filming)** - Directly stated in the passage.
* **B: Na-enweta ikikere ndịọzọ (Obtain additional permissions)** - Implied by the need to check local regulations.
* **D: Na-eme ihengosi naanị n’ebe ndị mmadụ jupụtara ebe nke agaghị enwe ike ịchọpụta drone (Film only in areas populated where the drone is not visible)** - This is a safety precaution and a way to respect privacy, which the passage suggests.

Therefore, the only option that the passage *doesn't* say is required is requesting permission. The passage says you need to obtain permission, not necessarily request it (though requesting is a good first step).



"
"Dịka paseeji kwuru, kedụ ebe ndị kachasị mma ime ihengosi site n’iji dromụ?","The correct answer is **D: N'ebe ndị i burula ụzọ nata ikike maka ya.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""If you use a drone, follow the rules as set by the local authorities and the rules that are legally allowed and possibly require permission."" This means you should only fly in areas where you have obtained the necessary permissions or where drone use is explicitly allowed. Option D directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nọketere ndị mmadụ nso agaghị abụ nsogbu maka ahụrụ dromụ:** This is incorrect because the passage mentions drones being a potential safety hazard and potentially dangerous to people.
* **B: N’ebe nke ana-anabataghị ikike isè fòto:** While potentially a place where drone use might be less restricted, the passage doesn't suggest avoiding areas with photo restrictions as a primary strategy. It emphasizes following local drone rules.
* **C: N’ebe ndị mmadụ jupụtara ebe nke agaghị enwecha ike ịhụ dromụ:** This is also not a good strategy. The passage focuses on legal permissions and local rules, not on simply avoiding being seen.

"Dịka e dere n’akwụkwọ, kedụ nkwupụta metụtara ndebanye aha achọrọ maka usoro visa abụghị eziokwu?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụrụ na ị nọ n’ụlọ e nyere onye mbịambịa njem, ị gaghị eme ndebanye aha.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Ọtụtụ obodo nwere iwu dị otu ahụ, ụlọ nkwari akụ dị gburugburu ga-ahụ maka ndebanye aha (hụ na ịjụrụ ese).""  It also says, ""Ọ bụrụ na ị nọ n’ụlọ e nyere onye mbịambịa njem, ị gaghị eme ndebanye aha.""  Option A directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Mba niile chọrọ ndebanye aha n’ebe ikikere otuebe ha gasị:** The passage clearly says that this isn't always the case (""ya mere chọpụta tupu oge eruo"").
*   **C: gịga i gara na ndị na-ahụ maka ọpụpụ na mbata mmadụ n’obodo ka a ga-achọ:** The passage mentions this as a *possible* requirement in some places, but it's not universally required.
*   **D: N’ụfọdụ ebe gasị, ụlọnkwarị otuebe nwere ike ijikwa ndebanyeaha ahụ:** The passage states this as a *possibility*, but not a guaranteed requirement.

Therefore, option A is the only one that aligns directly with the information presented in the passage.

Kedụ nke n’ime ndị a abụghị ebe ndị mbịambịa njem nwere ike ịga jikwaa ndebanye aha ha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ụlọ nkwarị ebe ha bi (Their home)**.

Here's why:

The text states that in some places, you *don't* need to register your address with local authorities. It then lists alternatives like:

*   **Police station:** (Option A) - The text mentions this as a place some people don't need to register.
*   **Airport/Departure point:** The text specifically states that people *only* need to register if they are staying in a hotel near the departure point.
*   **Immigration office:** (Option D) - This is a common place for registration.

Therefore, the only option that is explicitly *not* mentioned as a place where registration *might* occur is their home."
Onye bụ onye na-agaghị enweta uru site na mwepụta onwe n’oge njem?,"The correct answer is **B: Onye na-achọ ka akwụọ ya nnukwu ụgwọ ọnwa.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that working a year-long volunteer job often involves little to no pay.  Therefore, someone who *needs* a high monthly income would not benefit from this type of experience. The other options all describe potential benefits of volunteering: meeting new people, learning new things, gaining new perspectives, and potentially saving money.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ etu mwepụta onwe mgbe anọ n’ihenrite ofesi nyere onye njem n’ego ya?","The correct answer is **A: Ụgwọ ọnwa ka a na-enye kwa mgbe**

The passage explicitly states: ""... ọtụtuụ ọrụ akwụghị ụgwụ na-enye ọnụụlọ na ụgbọ ma ole na ole na-akwụ obere ụgwọ ọnwa."" This means that a small monthly allowance is provided.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: Ọ na-eduba n’ohere nnweta ọrụ:** The passage doesn't mention a fluctuating amount of pay.
*   **C: Ana-enye ụlọ na bọodụ mgbe ụfọdụ:** The passage mentions that housing (ụgbọ) might be provided, but it doesn't say it happens ""mgbe ụfọdụ"" (sometimes). The passage uses the more general term ""ọnụụlọ"" (family/housing).
*   **D: O ga-enyere gị aka inweta uche amamiihe:** While the experience might broaden your perspective, the passage doesn't directly link the allowance to gaining international recognition.

The passage explicitly states: ""Nleta """"nkịtị"""" ahụ na-agụnye ifeba n'Ọdụ Ụgbọ Elu Ụwa Nile Nke Ọlando, baa bọọsụ gaa n'Ụlọ Nkwari Akụ Dizni nọ n'ebe mepere emepe, nọọ ihe dị ka otu izu na-apụghị n'ala Dizni, ma wee laghachi ụlọ."" This describes flying to Orlando and staying at the Disney resort for a week.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nọ n’izu na-eme ngagharị n’ọdụ egwuregwu:** While potentially part of the trip, the passage doesn't emphasize a gaming event as the core of the ""Disney World experience.""
* **B: Nọ na saịtị ụlọnkwarị nọpụrụ anọpụ:** Staying at a resort is part of the trip, but the passage describes the entire journey, not just the resort itself.
* **C: Nọrọ njem niile ahụ n’akụrụngwa Disney:** The passage mentions staying at the Disney resort, but it doesn't specify that *all* transportation and activities must be within Disney's facilities.

Therefore, option D best encapsulates the description of a significant and elaborate trip to Disney World as presented in the passage.
"
Kedụ otu n’ime nkwupute a banyere Walt Disney World bụ nke abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **B: E nwere mbanye on-saịtị dị adị**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Disney anaghi ekwe: i gaghi enye onye ozo tiketi gi."" This directly implies that Disney *doesn't* allow ticket resellers and therefore, there aren't official on-site ticket sales for resale. The passage focuses on people selling tickets independently through platforms like eBay and Craigslist.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate based on the passage:

*   **A: Tiketi nke mbanye ọdụ egwuregwu nwere ike site n’aka fere n’aka ndị njem ndịọzọ:** The passage explicitly mentions that many people buy and sell tickets through eBay and Craigslist.
*   **C: E nwere bọsịsị dị adị ga-ebu ndị mmadụ site n’ọdụ ụgbọelu gaa n’akụrụngwa:** The passage describes the ""Walt Disney World"" experience as often including a bus transfer from the airport to the resort.
*   **D: Tiketi ọtụtụ-ụbọchị bụ nke ana-ahụkarị na weebụsaịtị orire nrefù ga:** The passage mentions people travelling for many days in Walt Disney World and buying tickets on independent websites.



Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the passage is that on-site ticket sales are readily available for purchase by other people.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ nsogbu nke e nwere ike ikpuchi n’ọzụzụ nke klassi ọkachamara maọbụ na mbipụta ga?","The correct answer is **C: Nkwado mpaghara agha (Combat zone support)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the training addresses ""production of exercises, numerous first aid encounters and **treatment for the wounded in the area of ​​conflict**."" This directly relates to combat zone support.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Mgbanahụ ọzara (Disaster relief):** While related to emergencies, the passage specifically mentions ""area of conflict,"" not a general disaster.
*   **B: Nkwado enyemaka mbụ nke ọgwụgwọ (Medical first aid support):**  The training *includes* first aid, but it's not the *primary* issue the passage highlights. The focus is broader than just first aid.
*   **D: Ọrụ omume (Operational tasks):** The passage mentions ""production of exercises,"" which relates to operational tasks, but the main focus is on the medical aspects within the conflict zone.



"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ isiokwu ga nke i nwere ike imecha na klassi ọzụzụ ọkachamara?","The correct answer is **A: Ọgwụgwọ mbụ (First Aid)**.

Here's why:

The passage discusses the need for combat-ready individuals to be trained in emergency response. It mentions ""Ọmụmụ gburugburu keiro"" (presumably a training program) that covers first aid, trauma care, and other survival skills. The passage explicitly states it includes ""ọtụtụ mgbata ọsọ enyemaka mbụ na ọzụzụ maka ngwaagha n'oge ụfọdụ"" (many first aid and medical procedures for injuries during conflict).

Therefore, first aid is a key component of the training described and a fitting conclusion for a professional first aid class.

The other options are less relevant:

*   **B: Mpaghara agha ga (Combat zones)** - While mentioned, it's the *location* of the training, not the *topic* of a class.
*   **C: Mgbanahụ ọzara (Civil unrest)** - This is a broader category than the specific training described.
*   **D: Ogige siri ike (Harsh terrain)** - This is another aspect of the environment, not the core subject of a first aid class.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ nhọrọ kachasị ibe ya mma iji gbochie mmebi mmiri ọṅụṅụ?","The correct answer is **B: Zụta mmiri e siri n’ọkụ**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that there are many ways to purify water, but some are better than others, especially for sensitive individuals.
* It recommends buying bottled water from a reputable company if you are concerned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sie mmiri n’ọkụ ọtụtụ nkeji:** The passage indicates that some water needs many minutes to boil, while others only need one minute.  It doesn't say boiling is *the best* method, and it also highlights the concern for purity.
* **C: Sie mmiri n’ọkụ otu nkeji:** Similar to A, the passage doesn't imply that one minute of boiling is universally the best method for purity.
* **D: Nyochaa mmiri ahụ maka ụmụ nje ama:** While checking for bacteria is important, the passage doesn't mention this as a solution to *prevent* contamination in the first place. It focuses on purification methods.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ihe nwere ike ịra ahụ ọ bụrụgodu ndị nwere ǹkà igwu mmiri?","The answer is **C: Igwu mmiri na mmiri na-ebu ebu.**

Here's why:

The passage states that the current of the water is strong and it's very difficult to swim against it. The passage also mentions that after escaping the water, swimming becomes more strenuous.  Therefore, the most logical implication is that swimming in murky/muddy water would make it *even harder* to escape and more tiring.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Igwu mmiri dịka ndị na-arụ ọrụ n’oshiiri (Swimming like a diver):** While a diver might face strong currents, the passage doesn't draw a parallel to diving. It focuses on escape and the difficulty of swimming *out*.
* **B: Igwu mmiri na mmiri dị oke omimi (Swimming in very clear water):**  Clear water doesn't inherently make escaping easier. The strong current is the primary problem.
* **D: Igwu mmiri na mmiri nwere ikuku (Swimming in water with foam):** Foam doesn't directly relate to the current strength and the difficulty of swimming.
"
Gịnị ka i nwere ike ime iji dọta gị n’obubu?,"The correct answer is **C: Gwuo mmiri n’ụzọ ọzọ** (Pump the water in another way).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a situation where the water is flowing in a direction that makes it extremely difficult to pump it out.**  The passage specifically mentions the powerful current and the difficulty of overcoming it.
* **Option C directly addresses this issue by suggesting an alternative pumping direction.** This is the most logical way to try and overcome the current and extract the water.
* **Option A** is mentioned in the text but the passage says to ""try other strategies for where you are not held"".
* **Option B** is impossible as the water is too powerful to resist.
* **Option D** is not a solution and may make the situation worse.

"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ ebendobe nke ị ga n’ụlọ ukwu ga-abụ ihe ziri ezi n’ọpụpụ mkpagharị ezumiike?","The correct answer is **D: Nọketere ụzọmmiri ọbụla obodo**.

The passage states that waterways are a great way to spend vacation time, and it gives examples of various waterways: the Loire, Rhine, Danube, and Erie.  It then says these waterways can be followed for hiking and biking.  Therefore, the passage implies that **any** of these waterway destinations would be a good choice for a relaxing vacation.
"
"Dịka paseeji ahụ kwuru, kedụ otu n’ime ndị a ga-abụ ọkachamara akwadoro maka ụmụnwanyị na-eme njem na ogige ahụ?","The correct answer is **B: Mara maka ọdịiche nke omanaala nwere ike mkpalite agwà n’uju site na otuebe.**

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights cultural differences and potential misinterpretations of gestures.** It specifically mentions that women travelers should be aware that cultural norms can lead to misunderstandings.
* **Option B directly addresses this point.** It advises women to be aware that seemingly innocent gestures (like offering a gift) can be misinterpreted. This aligns perfectly with the passage's focus on cultural sensitivity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zere mkparịtaụka ọnọdụ alụmdi:** While this might be generally good advice, it's not specifically mentioned or emphasized in the passage as a key area of cultural awareness.
* **C: Zere iyi ọla na-emuke emuke:** The passage mentions offering gifts can be misinterpreted, but it doesn't specifically call out *what* gifts to avoid.
* **D: Jiri atachi obi mgbe ọ dị mkpa:**  This is a general piece of advice and not the most specific answer related to the passage's cultural sensitivity focus.

"Site n’ebe akọwara na paseeji ahụ, kedụ ihe ga-enye aka maka ụmụ nwanyị ndị njem?","The correct answer is **C: Ghọta na ndịiche dị n’omenala nyere atụmatụ mgbanahụ ịkwụrụ chim.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ụmụ nwanyị kwesịrị ịghọta na ndịiche omenala nwere ike ịkpata ihe ha ga-ewere dị ka ịchọ okwu ma ọ bụghị ihe a na-ara ahụ ịhụ isoro gị, ijide site n'aka, dgz.""  This means understanding cultural differences is key to interpreting interactions.
* **Option C directly reflects this point.** It highlights how cultural norms can affect how interactions are perceived, specifically in the context of unwanted advances.
* **The other options are less accurate:**
    * **A: Mata na ọdịchaghị mfe iso mmadụ:** While true in many situations, it's not the *primary* advice given by the passage, which focuses on cultural awareness.
    * **B: Yiri ọla aka buru ibù iji gosipụta ọnọdụ alụmdi:**  The passage mentions jewelry as a way to *show* marital status, but it doesn't make it the core advice for safety.
    * **D: N’ọnọdụ eleghara anya na nrata niile ị na-enweta, kwụrụ chim n’ịjụ ụmụnwoke:** This is actively discouraged by the passage (""o kwesighi ekwesi!"").



Therefore, understanding cultural differences and how they can influence interactions is the most important piece of advice the passage offers for female travelers.

"Kedu ọnọdụ, dị ka akọwara na paragraf ahụ, nwere ike ime ka onye na-ese foto anụ ọhịa rụọ ọrụ nke oghere pụrụ iche?","The correct answer is **A: Ọ bụrụ na ha na-ese foto nke karịsịa obere anụmanụ**.

Here's why:

The paragraph states: ""Foto anụ ọhịa na-achọ ogologo oghere telephoto, n’agbanyeghi ihe dika igwe nnụnụ maọbụ obere okike choro oghere ndi ozo."" This implies that photographing *small animals* often requires a longer telephoto lens because they are further away and smaller in frame.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Ọ bụrụ na e ji foto ndị ahụ etinye n'ihe a ga-ere ere:** While this is a factor for some photographers, it doesn't directly cause the need for a special lens.
* **C: Mgbe ị na-ese foto ụmụ anụmanụ ihere:**  Photographing elusive animals is challenging, but it doesn't inherently require a special lens. It requires patience and skill.
* **D: Ọ bụrụ na ogige nwere ntuziaka akọwapụtara maka ịse foto nke anụ ọhịa:**  Location guidelines might exist, but they don't dictate the type of lens needed.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is **A**.



"
Kedu nke n'ime ihe ndị a na-abụghị ihe ịma aka nwere ike ime maka ndị na-ese foto anụ ọhịa kwuru na akụkụ ahụ?,"The correct answer is **C: Ịzụta ụdị anya m dị mkpa (Buying expensive equipment)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that photo wildlife photography requires good equipment, including a long telephoto lens.**  While good equipment *helps*, it's not the primary challenge mentioned.
* **The passage highlights several challenges:** finding unique animals, dealing with unpredictable animal behavior (being shy or aggressive), and working in difficult environments.
* **Buying expensive equipment is a logistical consideration, but not a direct challenge *during* the photo shoot.**  The other options all describe direct obstacles a wildlife photographer faces while trying to capture a photo.



Therefore, the option that is *least* likely to be a direct challenge faced by wildlife photographers is buying expensive equipment.



"
Kedu nke nwere ike ịkpata onye ọkwọ ụgbọ ala nwere ugwu gafere nsogbu kacha nta?,"The correct answer is **B: obere nguzogide (small tire tread)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that in snowy and icy conditions, low tire tread makes it difficult to steer the vehicle like on asphalt.  A small tire tread provides less grip and therefore more difficulty in navigating these conditions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Okporo ụzọ ndị njem na-akpụ akpụ na ya (Rough roads):** While rough roads can be a problem, the passage specifically highlights the issue with snow and ice. The question asks for the *least* trouble, and a vehicle with adequate tread can handle moderately rough roads better than one with poor tread in snow/ice.
*   **C: Oke ụmụ irighiri mmiri (Large water splashes):** The passage mentions water splashes as a problem, but it doesn't directly link them to the *least* trouble for a vehicle navigating mountainous terrain.
*   **D: Mgbochi mgbaraihe (De-icing):** De-icing is a *solution* to a problem, not a factor that minimizes trouble *during* the drive.

Therefore, a small tire tread directly contributes to the *most* trouble in the snowy/icy conditions described, making it the factor that leads to the *least* trouble for a vehicle with *small* tire tread.



"
Kedu akụkụ nke ụtụ isi ego nwere ike ịbụ otu na mba niile?,"The correct answer is **A: Ụgwọ (Amount)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that different cities have different ways of *setting* taxes and that the *amount* of taxes varies from country to country.
* The passage also mentions that in countries with federal governments like the US and Canada, both the federal and local governments set taxes differently.

While the *types* of taxes (like property taxes, income taxes, etc.) can vary significantly, the *amount* of tax paid is a core element that is directly addressed in the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Nrụpụta ihe owuwu (Revenue generation):**  The passage doesn't directly discuss revenue generation as a universal aspect of taxes. While taxes generate revenue, the *way* revenue is generated is highly variable.
* **C: nke ị na-etinye (What you pay):** This is too broad. While *what* you pay (e.g., income, property value) is part of the tax calculation, the passage focuses on the *amount* of the payment.
* **D: Nkata (Rates/Percentages):** The passage mentions that tax *rates* can vary, but it emphasizes that the *amount* of taxes paid differs across countries and regions.

Therefore, the amount of tax is the most consistent aspect mentioned in the passage that could be similar across countries.



"
Nkeji edemede ahụ na-ekwu na ị ga-etinye akwụkwọ ụtụ isi ego gị ebe ị dabere ma ọ bụrụ na ị na-arụ ọrụ ná mba ọzọ?,"The correct answer is **C: Na mba ebe ị na-arụ ọrụ ugbu a**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""N'ufodu mba nwere goomenti etiti dika United States na Canada, ana anako utu isi ego ma na goomenti etiti na kwa na mpaghara ya kpatara na onuego n’aka mgbodo ya ji di iche iche na mpaghara obula."" This implies that taxes are levied based on where you work.

The question asks where you pay taxes if you are working in another country. The passage doesn't specify the exact location but implies it's related to where the work is performed. Option C, ""Na mba ebe ị na-arụ ọrụ ugbu a,"" aligns best with this implication.  The passage doesn't mention residency as the primary factor for tax liability in this context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ebe ọ bụla ị na-ebikarị:**  While residency *can* influence taxes, the passage focuses on where you *work* in relation to taxes.
* **B: N'ime United States:** The passage specifically mentions the US and Canada, but it doesn't state that taxes are *always* paid in the US, even if you're working in another country.
* **D: ebe ọ bụla enwere obere ụgwọ:** This is irrelevant to the tax system and isn't mentioned in the passage.



"
Kedu n'ime nkọwa ndị a maka ngosi ngosi ụwa nke na-abụghị eziokwu?,"The correct answer is **C: Ihe nwere ike ịga n'ihu ruo ọnwa isii**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Agbanyeghị n’ime tiori ha nwere ike imeli kwa afọ (ọbụrụhaala na ha nọ na mba dị iche iche), na omume ha anọghị ya. Emume ndị a na-anọtekarị aka oge ọ bụla n'etiti ọnwa atọ ruo isii..."" 
* **This means:** While theoretically, these exhibitions *could* run for up to six months (if held in different countries), the reality is they typically run for a shorter period.

Let's look at why the other options are true based on the text:

* **A: Ngosipụta nwere ike igosi akụkọ ma ọ bụ omenala obodo:** The text explicitly mentions this: ""...ngosipụta okooko osisi nke mba ụwa bụ mmemme ndị pụrụ iche ebe a na-egosipụ ifuru, ubi mkprụ osisi na ihe ọzọ ọbụla gbasara osisi.""  This implies the exhibition shows something about the region/country where the exhibition is being held.
* **B: N'akụkụ ngosi nka na ihe ọmụma, ihe ngosi botanical na-egosipụta:**  The text directly states: ""...ngosipụta okooko osisi nke mba ụwa bụ mmemme ndị pụrụ iche ebe a na-egosipụ ifuru, ubi mkprụ osisi na ihe ọzọ ọbụla gbasara osisi."" This refers to botanical aspects.
* **D: Ntinye aka adịghị mkpa site na mba niile:** The text says they are held in ""different countries"" suggesting participation is international."
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a chọrọ maka ngosi ngosi mba ụwa ma ọ bụ ngosi ngosi ụwa?,"The correct answer is **B: Enweghị ike ịme mmemme ahụ kwa afọ n'otu mba ahụ.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Agbanyeghị n’ime tiori ha nwere ike imeli kwa afọ (ọ bụrụhaala na ha nọ na mba dị iche iche), na omume ha anọghị ya."" This directly confirms that the event is not held annually in the same country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: A ghaghị iwepụta akụkọ ihe mere eme nke mba, yana ihe ịma aka zuru ụwa ọnụ ugbu a:** The text mentions that these are showcased *as part of* the event (""akụkọ ihe mere eme na akụkọ ihe mere eme""). It doesn't say they shouldn't be included.
* **C: Ihe omume nwere ike ịdịru karịa ọnwa isii:** The text says the events typically take place between March and June, implying they *don't* last longer than six months.
* **D: Mba niile ga-esonyerịrị maka ngosi a ga-anabata ya:** The text mentions events happening in different countries, contradicting the idea that *all* countries must participate.



"
Kedu n'ime omume ndị a ga-eme ka mwakpo anụmanụ ghara ịdị obere?,"The correct answer is **C: na-edebe anụ ọhịa wolf ma ọ dịkarịa ala 25 yad.**

Here's why:

The passage states that wolves are a major factor in reducing wildlife attacks.  Specifically, it says wolves tend to stay within a 25-meter radius of the bison, elk, moose, and bears.  Maintaining a wolf presence (or at least mimicking their range) will help keep these large animals in check and reduce the likelihood of attacks.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: na-ebute osisi na-esi ísì ụtọ:**  Smell-based deterrents are not mentioned as a key strategy in the passage.
* **B: Na-ebupụ ihe mkpofu n'ogige:**  Adding garbage would likely *attract* more animals, increasing the risk of conflict.
* **D: Iri nri a na-eji egbochi anụmanụ:**  The passage does not mention eating meat as a deterrent.



"
Kedu n'ime ihe ndị a na-ekwughị na paragraf dị ka ihe nwere ike ime ka ụmụ anụmanụ na-awakpo ụmụ mmadụ?,"The correct answer is **C: na-enye anụ ọhịa nri**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph explicitly states that people are injured because they *don't give animals enough space* and that *bison, elk, moose, bears, and all large animals can fight*.
* The paragraph also mentions that bears are attracted to food left by tourists. This directly links providing food to animals approaching humans and potentially becoming aggressive.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ike isi (strength):** While the animals are large and strong, the paragraph doesn't suggest their strength *causes* them to attack. It's the lack of space and potential for territorial disputes that's the primary issue.
* **B: Ọdịda idobe anya dị mma (good eyesight):** Good eyesight might help animals detect humans, but it's not presented as a direct cause of attacks.
* **D: anụmanụ ndị na-amabughị ndị mmadụ nso (animals not used to people):** The paragraph actually implies the opposite. The animals are becoming *accustomed* to people being present, which is part of the problem.
