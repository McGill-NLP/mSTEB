"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat fi alfqrh, ayun men hedh leys methalaan 3la at3alam aletfa'eley?","The correct answer is **B: medres akhetbarat alekfa'h aledraseyh** (a teacher who tests academic proficiency).

Here's why:

The paragraph discusses ""scaffolding"" as a learning method, where support is provided to individuals undergoing new learning experiences.  It specifically mentions examples like using new computer software or starting a new project.

* **A: bernamej t'eleymey fi bedayh l'ebh alekmebyewter** (an introductory computer learning program) - This *is* an example of scaffolding, providing support for learning new software.
* **C: bernamej derash mesteql** (independent study program) - While independent, it can still benefit from scaffolding – perhaps by having readily available help or guidance.
* **D: medreb dewrey alesghar** (a young child's Microsoft Office trainer) - This is a specific example of scaffolding, providing tailored support for learning a particular program.
* **B: medres akhetbarat alekfa'h aledraseyh** (a teacher who tests academic proficiency) - This is about *assessment*, not providing support during the *learning process*.  It's evaluating what has been learned, not helping someone learn it.



Therefore, a teacher who *tests* proficiency is not an example of scaffolding in the context of the paragraph.

ay mema yely la yesf bedqh mefhewm at3alam aletfa'eley?,"The correct answer is **C: yu'eref ayedaan basem at3alam aletfa'eley afetradeyaan (It defines simple learning scaffolds)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that scaffolds are *not* a way of learning, but rather a *tool* to aid learning. It also mentions that scaffolds can be *private and real*.  Option C states that scaffolds ""define simple learning scaffolds."" While this is *true*, it's a very narrow definition and not the central concept the passage focuses on.

Let's look at why the other options are *supported* by the text:

*   **A: yemken an yewjed at3alam aletfa'eley afetradeyaan (Private learning scaffolds can exist):** The passage states ""Yumkin 2an takuna assaqalat iftiradiyyatan wa 7aqiqiyyatan 3ala 7addin sawa2"" (Scaffolds can be private and real, on a spectrum).
*   **B: hew wesyelh mesa'edh akether men kewnh teryeqh t'elem (It is more of a helping tool than a way to learn):** The passage clearly states ""huw wesyelh mesa'edh akether men kewnh teryeqh t'elem"" (It is more of a helping tool than a way to learn).
*   **D: yusetkhedm at3alam aletfa'eley letqedyem aled'em fi bedayh tejrebh at3alam (Scaffolding uses to provide support in the beginning of a learning experience):**  The passage mentions ""Yusetkhedm at3alam aletfa'eley letqedyem aled'em fi bedayh tejrebh at3alam"" (Scaffolding uses to provide support in the beginning of a learning experience).

Therefore, Option C is the *least* accurate answer as it only scratches the surface of the passage's explanation of scaffolds. It doesn't capture the core concept that scaffolds are tools to *support* learning, not learning methods themselves.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey meyzh may sebyes alety yemken an tefyed aletlab aledyen yewajhewn mesheklh fi aleqra'h?","The correct answer is **C: 3anewan weyb wahed (One web address)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yumkin alwusul ila hadhihi assaf7a bi suhula min khilal tawfir 3unwan web wa7id faqat, mimma yaj3al min assahl tadhakuriha wa kitabatiha lil tullab alladhina qad yuwajihuna mushkilatan fi istikhdam law7at almafati7 aw fi attahji2a."" (This page can be easily accessed by providing only one web address, which makes it easier to remember and write for students who may have difficulty using the keyboard or with spelling.)

While the other options are features of MySpace, they aren't specifically highlighted as helping students with reading difficulties.  The unique web address is presented as a benefit for students struggling with typing or spelling, thus making it easier for them to access and use the platform.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mema yely lm yekn jez2aan men rad Krushchev 3la a3mal shaghab al 3ummal?","The correct answer is **C: zeyadh khafd al 2ujur (further reduction of wages)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Krushchev agreed to some economic demands.  It also mentions he sent tanks to restore order. However, the text highlights that the workers' protests were *due to* a lack of food and *low wages*.  Therefore, *increasing* wage reductions would be the opposite of addressing the workers' grievances and wouldn't have been part of Khrushchev's response.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: t3eyn r2eyes wzra2 jedyed (appointing a new prime minister):** The text says Khrushchev agreed to appoint Wladyslaw Gomulka as prime minister.
* **B: astkhdam aldbabat laset3adh alnzam (using tanks to restore order):** The text states Khrushchev sent tanks to restore order.
* **D: ala3teraf beb3d alemtaleb alaqetsadeyh (acknowledging some economic demands):** The text explicitly says Khrushchev agreed to some economic demands.



"
ayun men ataly lm yekn sebbaan a3mal shaghab fi Bolanda?,"The correct answer is **A: ashhuyu3iyya**.

The text states the workers were protesting **shortages of food and wage cuts** (naqs al ghidha2 wa khafd al 2ujur) and the protests became a **general anti-communist** demonstration (i7tijaj 3am didda ashhuyu3iyya).  While the other options were *part* of the cause, anti-communism was the broader context of the protests.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men ataly lm yu2ther 3la al3laqat beyn alSovieti wa al Wilayat al Mutta7ida al amrikiya?","The question asks which of the listed options *did not* affect the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States, according to the provided text. Let's analyze the text:

The text states that World War II, in which Germany was a shared enemy, led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, after the war, differences in ideology, operations, and culture contributed to the disintegration of countries. Former allies became adversaries, and the Cold War began. The Cold War is described as a long-lasting conflict fought through proxy wars in various regions.

Now let's look at the options:

*   **A: alakhetlafat aletheqafeyh (Cultural differences)** - The text explicitly mentions cultural differences as a factor contributing to the deterioration of relations.
*   **B: alara2 7wl Almanya (Disagreements about Germany)** - The text mentions that Germany was a shared enemy during WWII, implying that disagreements about Germany's fate or role after the war could have affected relations.
*   **C: al 3amaliat al mutanaqida (Contradictory operations)** - The text mentions contradictory operations as a factor leading to the disintegration of countries and the beginning of the Cold War.
*   **D: almnaz3at almut3aliqh bi alanzimh (Conflicts related to ideologies)** - The text explicitly mentions differences in ideology as a factor contributing to the deterioration of relations and the beginning of the Cold War.

All options A, B, C and D are mentioned in the text as factors influencing the relationship between the Soviet Union and the United States after World War II.

Therefore, there is no correct answer among the provided options, since all are related to the conflict between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, if forced to choose the *least* directly mentioned, B (disagreements about Germany) is the weakest connection. The text focuses more directly on ideological and operational differences.

Given this, and assuming there might be a slight nuance intended, **B: alara2 7wl Almanya (Disagreements about Germany)** is the *most likely* answer because while Germany is mentioned as a shared enemy *initially*, the text pivots to ideological and operational differences as primary drivers of the Cold War. The disagreements about Germany's future are a stepping stone to those larger conflicts.

However, it's crucial to remember the inherent flaw of the question, which requires choosing a factor *not* mentioned when all are tangentially relevant.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{B}$"
ay mema yely la yesf bedqh alegherd men eresal alenbedat al'esebyh fi jami3 anha' alejsem?,"The correct answer is **B: edarh tadfq aldam (Managing blood flow)**.

Here's why:

* **The original text states:** ""Ya7afz algihaz al3asaby 3ala attawazun bi irsal nbadhat 3asabiya 3an tariq aljism lil 7ifaz 3ala tadaffuq addam duna 3a2iq.""  This translates to: ""The nervous system maintains balance by sending nerve impulses through the body to protect blood flow without interruption.""

* **The text highlights the speed of nerve impulse transmission:** ""Yumkin irsal hadhihi annabadat al3asabiya bi sur3a fi jami3 an7a2 aljism mimaa yusa3id fil 7ifaz 3ala aljism 2aminan min ayi tahdid mu7tamal."" This translates to: ""These nerve impulses can be sent quickly to all parts of the body, which helps protect the body safely from any potential harm.""

* **The purpose isn't just about blood flow *occurring* (A) or maintaining overall balance (C).** While blood flow is crucial for balance, the focus here is on the *control* or *management* of blood flow. The nerve impulses actively *regulate* blood flow to ensure it remains uninterrupted.  Also, avoiding physical threats (D) is a consequence of maintaining body safety, not the primary reason for sending nerve impulses.

Therefore, **managing blood flow** best encapsulates the function described in the text.



"
mada yemken al3thwr 3aleh fi hedbh alejyezh?,"The correct answer is **D: alharam al akbar (the Great Pyramid)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Yu3ad al haram al akbar fil Jiza a7ad al 3aja2eb assab3a al lati la tazal qa2ima 7atta al yawm."" (The Great Pyramid of Giza is considered one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still remain today.)  It also highlights that the Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu.

While the other options are also mentioned in the text (tombs, temples, and the other pyramids), the *Great Pyramid* (al-haram al-akbar) is the most prominent and central feature discussed.



"
ma kan alegherd men alharm alakbar?,"The correct answer is **B: letkeryem fer'eren (to honor the pharaoh)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Shuyyida al haram al akbar ka naw3 min takareem lil fer3an ufou"" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built as a type of honor for the pharaoh.""
"
men alems'ewel 3an ma3ereftena balheryeq aledy demr alema3ebed?,"The correct answer is **C: Strabo**.

The text states: ""Dawwan al mu2arreخ al Yunani Strabo la7eqan 2al 2esem bel shakel al ladhi na3refuhu 7aleyyan..."" which translates to ""The Greek historian Strabo later recorded the name in the form we know it today..."" This indicates that Strabo is the source of our current knowledge of Herostratus's name.

While Alexander the Great is mentioned as being involved in the reconstruction, he didn't originally identify Herostratus as the perpetrator. The legend of Herostratus's name being erased is also mentioned, implying Strabo's account is a later record.
"
ayun hew jemlh deqyeqh feyma yekhes e'eadh bena' ma3ebed Artemis?,"The correct answer is **B: a'eyed bena'eh b3d 'ehed Alexander alakebr** (It was rebuilt after the death of Alexander the Great).

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""fi wa8tin la7i8, ba3da wafati Al-Iskandar, u3ida bina2 al-ma3bad fi 3am 323 8abl al-milad."" (In reality, after the death of Alexander, the temple was rebuilt in the year 323 BC.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: duf'eِt tekaleyf e'eadh alebna' men qebl Alexander alakebr** (Alexander the Great paid the costs of rebuilding) - The passage says Alexander *offered* to pay, but his offer was rejected.
* **C: aumer Herostratus betghetyh tekaleyf e'eadh alebna'** (Herostratus ordered to pay the costs of rebuilding) - The passage doesn't mention anything about Herostratus ordering rebuilding or paying costs.
* **D: a'eyed bena'eh fi 3am 320 qebl alemyelad** (It was rebuilt in the year 320 BC) - The passage explicitly states it was rebuilt in 323 BC, not 320 BC.

"wefqaan llfqrh, meta kan abekr weqt yemken an yesyer feyh new' ma 3la qedmeyn?","The correct answer is **A: mundhu sab3 malayin sana**

The text states: ""Lam yasir aslafuhum mina al-Australopithecus (al-qurud mustaqimat alqama 3la anna7w al-mu3tad. **Tamma al3uthur 3ala asnaf dhat qadamayn fi 7ifriyat Australopithecus mundhu sab3at malayin sana**..."" which translates to: ""Their ancestors were not like Australopithecus (upright-walking apes). **Footed species were discovered in Australopithecus excavations 7 million years ago**...""



While the text also mentions discoveries at 4.2-3.9 million years ago, it directly states that *Australopithecus* (the ancestors) were already walking upright 7 million years ago.  Therefore, the earliest timeframe mentioned for creatures walking on two legs is 7 million years ago."
ay men hedh alanewa' kan yesyer banetzam 3la qedmeyn?,"The correct answer is **C: fesa'el dat qedmeyn (Bipedal species)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tamma al3uthur 3ala asnaf dhat qadamayn fi 7ifriyat Australopithecus mundhu 4.2-3.9 milyun sana..."" (Species with two feet were discovered in Australopithecus excavations since 4.2-3.9 million years ago). This directly points to species that walked on two feet.
* The question asks which *type* of species walked on two feet. ""Fesa'el dat qedmeyn"" translates to ""bipedal species.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sahelanthropus:** The text mentions Sahelanthropus *might* have walked on two feet 7 million years ago, but it's not definitively stated, and the text primarily focuses on Australopithecus as confirmed bipedal species.
* **B: Homo Erectus:** While Homo Erectus *is* a bipedal species, the text doesn't mention it directly.  The focus is on the earlier Australopithecus species.
* **D: Australopithecus:** The text states Australopithecus *was* a bipedal species (discovered with two-legged fossils). However, the question asks for the *type* of species that walked on two feet, and ""bipedal species"" is a more encompassing and accurate answer.

Here's why:

The passage describes how Germany used U-boats to try and stop the Allied forces (specifically Britain) from transporting troops and supplies across the Atlantic. The goal was to prevent Britain from receiving reinforcements and resources, which could have allowed the Allies to defeat Germany.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: a'eterad alebda'e' aleqademh men beryetaneya (Intercepting the advance of supplies from Britain):** While disrupting supplies was a goal, the passage specifically highlights preventing *receipt* of supplies, not intercepting an advance *from* Britain.
* **C: neql alemwad 'eber alemheyt alatelsey (Transporting materials across the Atlantic using the Atlantic):** The passage focuses on using U-boats *against* Atlantic transport, not using the Atlantic itself for transport.
* **D: men' ameryeka men telqey alashekhas walebda'e' (Preventing America from receiving people and supplies):** The passage focuses on Germany's efforts to stop Britain, not America.

Therefore, option B most accurately reflects Germany's objective during World War II as described in the passage."
"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat alewaredh fi alfqrh, men heqq akebr nejah fi alherb alebheryh khelal hemlh shemal alatelsey?","The correct answer is **C: alaleman walebreytaneywen** (The Germans and the British).

Here's why:

The text states that the Battle of the Atlantic is a prime example of how naval warfare was used to transport personnel and supplies across the ocean. It highlights that the Americans were trying to transport personnel and supplies to help Britain, while the Germans were trying to stop this movement using U-boats.  The text implies that the success (or failure) of both sides was crucial.  If the Allies had failed to transport supplies, Germany might have been able to invade Britain. Therefore, both the Germans and the British played a key role in the outcome.

The options are:

*   **A: albreytaneywen walameryekyewn** (The British and the Americans) - While the Americans were involved, the text emphasizes the German efforts to stop the British and the overall struggle between the Allied and Axis powers.
*   **B: alalman** (The Germans) - This is incorrect because the text highlights the Allied efforts to transport supplies and the German attempts to halt them.
*   **C: alaleman walebreytaneywen** (The Germans and the British) - This is correct as it reflects the central conflict and the mutual dependence of both sides in the battle.
*   **D: alebreytaneywen** (The British) - Incorrect for the same reason as option B.



"

The text explicitly states: ""lam yakon al-sarj 8ad okhtori3a ba3d, lithalika 7araba al-fursan al-ashurioun 3ala '6uhur khyolihim al-3aria.""  This translates to ""The saddle had not been invented yet, therefore the Assyrian horsemen fought on the bare backs of their horses.""
"
keyf kanet tukhad alema3earek alety testekhedm alefresan?,"The correct answer is **C: 3la zher alekheyl** (On the backs of horses).

The text explicitly states: ""Sila7o al-fursan howa jaysh yo8atil 3ala '6uhur al-khayl."" which translates to ""Their cavalry weapon was an army that fought on the backs of horses.""

"wefqaan llfqrh, ayen len tejd mewatenaan babelyaan 'eadeyaan?","The correct answer is **B: yhedr ahetfalaan fi ma3ebed asasey** (They hold ceremonies in primary temples).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""كان للكل معبد فيه ما مفتوح ثم ملذ داخلي لا يستطيع دخوله إلا الكهنة. كانوا يقدمون القرابين للآلهة ويحاول الكهنة تلبية احتياجات الآلهة من خلال الاحتفالات والأعياد."" This translates to: ""There was for each a temple, some of which were open, and then an inner sanctuary that only the priests could enter. They would offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to meet the needs of the gods through celebrations and festivals.""

Option B directly reflects this statement about holding ceremonies (احتفالات - ahtifalat) in temples (في معابد - fi ma'abid).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yejleb qerabeyn ela sahh ma3ebed** (They bring sacrifices to the temple courtyard): While sacrifices were offered, the passage emphasizes ceremonies and festivals as a way to fulfill the gods' needs. Bringing sacrifices to the courtyard is just one aspect of the offerings.
* **C: fi 'eyed fi sahh ma3ebed** (During holidays in the temple courtyard): This is too specific. The passage mentions celebrations (احتفالات - ahtifalat) in general, not just during holidays.
* **D: yejleb qerabeyn ela khelwh amenh** (They bring sacrifices to a place away from it): The passage clearly states sacrifices were brought *to* the temple.



"
ay mema yely kan mekhessaan lelkhenh thedyedaan?,"The correct answer is **C: ala'eyad** (الأعياد).

The text mentions: ""كان الناس يقدمون العربون للآلهة و يحاول الكهنة تأدية احتياجات الآلهة من خلال الاحتفالات و **الأعياد**"". This translates to: ""People offered tributes to the gods and priests tried to fulfill the needs of the gods through **festivals and holidays**.""  The word ""الأعياد"" (al-a'yaad) directly translates to ""holidays"" or ""festivals"".
"
meta aketseb alemlek tewt 3anekh amewn sema3eh sey'eh?,"The correct answer is **C: b3d aketshaf qebrh** (After the discovery of his tomb).

The text explicitly states: ""Fi 7in tamma naheb al 3adid min al qubur al qadima, illa annahu lam yattem al 3abath bi hadha al qabr. 7ufidhat mou3dham al adawat al lati dufinat ma3a Tutankhamun bi tariqa jayyida, bi ma fi dhalika al alaf min al qita3 al athariyya al masnu3a min al ma3aden al tahminah wal a7jar al nadira."" (While many ancient tombs were robbed, this tomb was not disturbed. Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun were preserved well, including thousands of archaeological pieces made of precious metals and rare stones.)

And further: ""Fi 7in tamma naheb al 3adid min al qubur al qadima, illa annahu lam yattem al 3abath bi hadha al qabr. 7ufidhat mou3dham al adawat al lati dufinat ma3a Tutankhamun bi tariqa jayyida, bi ma fi dhalika al alaf min al qita3 al athariyya al masnu3a min al ma3aden al tahminah wal a7jar al nadira. **Fi 7in tamma naheb al 3adid min al qubur al qadima, illa annahu lam yattem al 3abath bi hadha al qabr. 7ufidhat mou3dham al adawat al lati dufinat ma3a Tutankhamun bi tariqa jayyida, bi ma fi dhalika al alaf min al qita3 al athariyya al masnu3a min al ma3aden al tahminah wal a7jar al nadira.**"" (While many ancient tombs were robbed, this tomb was not disturbed. Most of the items buried with Tutankhamun were preserved well, including thousands of archaeological pieces made of precious metals and rare stones.) The discovery of the tomb and its contents is what brought Tutankhamun fame and recognition.  The text highlights how *unlike* other tombs, this one was well-preserved, implying its discovery is the reason for its current fame.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Fi 7in tamma naheb al 3adid min al qubur al qadima, illa annahu lam yattem al 3abath bi hadha al qabr."" This translates to: ""While many ancient tombs were robbed, but this tomb was not disturbed.""
* **The text emphasizes:** ""aketshaf qabrihi fi 3am 1922 ja3aluhu min al mashahir."" This translates to: ""The discovery of his tomb in 1922 made him famous.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: wed'eh fi lewa'eh alemlek aleqdeymh** (included in the lists of ancient kings): The text states the opposite - he wasn't recorded in most lists of ancient kings *until* his tomb was discovered.
* **C: serqh alaf aleqt' alatheryh men qebrh** (thousands of artifacts were stolen from his tomb): The text explicitly states his tomb was *not* plundered.
* **D: ahemyeth khelal al'esewr alemseryh aleqdeymh** (his importance during the ancient Egyptian empire): While he *became* important *because* of his tomb, the text doesn't say he was important *during* the empire itself before the discovery.



"
ma aledy kan alesha'er aleywenaney Homer gheyr qader 3la aleqyam bh?,"The correct answer is **D: aleklam (speaking/reciting)**.

Here's why:

The text states that Homer is a famous *poet*. Ancient Greek oral tradition relied heavily on memorization and recitation of poetry. While Homer undoubtedly had other abilities, his fame stems from his poetry. The question asks what Homer might *not* have been able to do well, implying a skill that wouldn't directly contribute to being a renowned poet.  Therefore, it's more plausible he wouldn't be particularly skilled at things like listening, seeing, or walking, compared to the core skill of reciting and composing poetry. 

The question is phrased a bit trickily, but focusing on what *isn't* a primary characteristic of a famous poet helps to arrive at the answer.
"
ay yewnaney meshhewr ma3erewf beshey' akher gheyr aladeb?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

* **Pythagorus** is known for his famous theorem about the relationship between the sides of right triangles, a mathematical concept, not primarily for his literary works.
* **Homer** is primarily known as a poet (author of the Iliad and Odyssey).
* **Sophocles** and **Aristophanes** are both known as famous playwrights.

Therefore, Pythagoras is the only one listed who is renowned for something other than literature.
"

The text states: ""Kanat an-nisa2 tathu fil fana2"" which translates to ""The women would gather in the courtyard.""  This indicates that the family spent a significant amount of time in the courtyard.
"
ma aledy lm yekn mhemaan jedaan lel'ea'elh al'eberyh?,"The correct answer is **A: menakhhem (their homes)**.

The question asks what was *not* important to Jewish families. The paragraph states: ""Lam yumathel al manzel ahamiya balighah"" which translates to ""The home did not hold great importance."" Therefore, the homes (manazelhem) were not a primary concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: metajerhem (their shops)** - The paragraph says shops were open fronts, indicating they *were* a part of their lives.
*   **C: menazelhem (their homes)** - The paragraph explicitly states homes *did not* hold great importance.
*   **D: tebkhhem (their cooking)** - The paragraph doesn't mention cooking being particularly important or unimportant.

So, only ""menakhhem"" (their homes) directly reflects the information provided in the text.
"

The text explicitly states: ""على الرغم من أن جميع هذه الدول كانت ""إسكندنافية""، إلا أنه كانت هناك اختلافات كثيرة بين الشعوب، والملوك، والعادات، **والتاريخ** في الدنمارك والسويد والنرويج وأيسلندا."" which translates to ""Although all these countries were ""Scandinavian"", there were many differences between the peoples, the kings, the customs, **and the history** in Denmark, Sweden, Norway and Iceland.""

The text also mentions differences in ""العادات"" (customs) and ""الشعوب"" (peoples), and ""التاريخ"" (history). While the text mentions ""الملوك"" (kings), it doesn't explicitly mention religion as a point of difference. Therefore, religion (al-ared) is the most likely answer.

This translates to: ""while the poor and women ate their food while sitting on chairs, the wealthy men preferred to hold feasts together where they rested beside them while consuming their meals.""

Therefore, the wealthy Roman men preferred to eat while reclining, not sitting on chairs."
ay mema yely len yekwen jez'aan men welyemh rewmaneyh qedyemh?,"The correct answer is **D: tebq men aledyek alerwemy alemshewy** (they eat roasted pork).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""...bi ma fi dhalika al 5anzir al bari wal 6awus wal 7alazon wa naw3 min al qawared yusamma al zaghiba."" which translates to ""...including wild boar, cattle, snails, and a type of rodent called zaghiba.""  While not specifically saying ""roasted pork,"" *al-khinzir al-bari* (wild boar) was a common food source for the Romans, and roasting was a typical preparation method.  Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the text states the poor and women ate their meals sitting on chairs, while wealthy men held feasts and rested on couches. It also states they did *not* have things like thura (a type of food), chocolate, or even a diet that included things from America or Asia.

"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay mema yely men gheyr alemrejh an yekwen lh tatheyr da'em?","The correct answer is **A: مجتمع (mujtama3 - society)**.

The passage states: ""Al 7adara hiya thaqafa farida mushtaraka bayna majmu3atin kabira mina an-nas al-ladhina ya3ishuna wa ya3maluna bi shaklin ta3awuniy, ay mujtama3.""  This translates to: ""Civilization is a unique culture shared by a large group of people who live and work in a cooperative manner, i.e., a society.""

The passage emphasizes that civilization is a product of a **society**.  The other options are incorrect because:

* **B: الثقافة صغيرة (al-thaqafa saghira - culture is small):** The passage says civilization involves a *large* group of people.
* **C: مدينة مستقلة ذاتيًا (madyna mustaqila thatiyan - an independent self-sufficient city):** While cities are a part of civilization, the passage focuses on the broader societal aspect.
* **D: الثقافة حضارية (al-thaqafa hadariyya - culture is civilized):** The passage defines civilization *through* its culture, but doesn't equate culture *being* civilized with being the core element that needs constant development.

Therefore, **society (مجتمع)** is the fundamental element, according to the passage, that requires continuous development for civilization to thrive.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy yesbeq alamh?","The correct answer is **A: theqafh hedaria (civilization)**.

Here's why:

The text starts by defining ""Al Hadara"" (Civilization). The first sentence clearly states: ""Al 7adara hiya thaqafa farida mushtaraka bayna majmu3atin kabira mina an-nas al-ladhina ya3ishuna wa ya3maluna bi shaklin ta3awuniy, ay mujtama3.""  This translates to ""Civilization is a unique culture shared among a large group of people who live and work in a cooperative manner, that is, a society.""

Therefore, the passage is *about* civilization, and it defines civilization at the very beginning. The other options are incorrect because they describe things mentioned *within* the definition of civilization, but not what precedes the definition itself.

ay jemlh 7wl Drukgyal Dzong leyset sheyhh?,"The correct answer is **C: demr heryeq al3adid men athar aleql'eh** (destroyed by fire, many of its relics).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""fi 3am 1951, tasabbaba 7ariq fi baqa2 ba3d athar Drukgyal Dzong, mithl surat Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""  This translates to ""In 1951, a fire caused damage to some relics of Drukgyal Dzong, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""  It doesn't say the entire Dzong was destroyed or that *many* relics were destroyed.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **A: buneyt lelahetfal banetsar aleqwat aletbetyh alemg7wleyh** (built to celebrate the victory of the protective forces against the surrounding Mongol Tibetans): The text explicitly says Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel built the Dzong to commemorate his victory.
* **B: teq' fi Bhutan** (is located in Bhutan): The text clearly states ""Drukgyal Dzong li 2e7ya2 dhekra entisarihi 3al quwat al Tibet al Mangoliyya"" which implies it's in Bhutan.
* **D: aneshaha Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel** (was built by Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel): The text explicitly states ""buneyt lelahetfal banetsar aleqwat aletbetyh alemg7wleyh"" which implies Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was responsible for its construction.

* **Option A directly reflects this:** ""alebqaya alewheydh alemtebqeyh kanet sewrh Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal"" translates to ""The remaining relics were the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: anetsert aleqwat aletbetyh alemg7wleyh** - This translates to ""The surrounding forces were defeated.""  The fire didn't cause a defeat of any forces.
* **C: lem tetather sh'ebeyh mekan alejdeb** - This translates to ""The area of the attraction was not affected."" The fire *did* affect the area, damaging relics.
* **D: hafez 3aleha Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyal** - This translates to ""Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel preserved it.""  Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel was long gone by 1951, so he couldn't have preserved anything then.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: دمر الفيتناميون بنوم بن (The Vietnamese destroyed Phnom Penh):** While the text mentions Vietnamese incursions, it doesn't state they destroyed Phnom Penh.
* **B: غزت كمبوديا تايلاند عام 1772 (Cambodia invaded Thailand in 1772):** The text says Thailand invaded Cambodia, not the other way around.
* **C: غزت الفيتناميون كمبوديا في بداية القرن الثامن عشر (The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia at the beginning of the 18th century):**  The text says Vietnamese incursions occurred in the later part of the 18th century, not at the beginning.

* **Option D accurately reflects this statement.**  It directly translates to the idea of multiple Thai invasions.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: غزا الفيتناميون كمبوديا عدة مرات** (The Vietnamese invaded Cambodia several times): While the passage mentions Vietnamese incursions, it doesn't say they invaded *several times* like the Thais did.
* **B: غزا التايلانديون والفييتناميون كمبوديا عام 1772** (The Thais and the Vietnamese invaded Cambodia in 1772):  While there was an invasion in 1772, the passage emphasizes the *repeated* nature of Thai attacks.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the Dutch East India Company *transformed* the rudimentary production of grains and *employed Chinese workers* in rice and sugar plantations. It *doesn't* mention them starting the production of native grains. They focused on rice and sugar.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

This translates to: ""In 1895, after the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, whereby it relinquished sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.""

Therefore, the treaty resulted in Japan gaining control of Taiwan.

* The passage states: ""Yushir mi8dar ayunat al-naytrugyn (al-haydrwjiyn fy al2as al-haydrwjiyn) ela mustawa al2as al-haydrujiny fy al-madati al-kymawiya al-mukhtabara.""  This directly translates to: ""The amount of hydrogen ions (hydrogen in the hydronium ion) indicates the level of hydronium ion in the tested chemical substance.""
* Hydrogen ions (H+) are essentially protons (H) that have lost their electron.
* The passage explains that the concentration of hydrogen ions reflects the acidity or basicity of the substance.

Therefore, measuring the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) is the way to determine the level of hydronium ion concentration, and thus the acidity/basicity of the chemical substance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: meda asaseyh aw hemdeyh alemadh alekyemya'eyh (acidic or basic nature of the chemical substance):** While acidity/basicity *is* what's being determined, the question asks *how* it's measured.  The answer is through hydrogen ion concentration.
* **B: 3dd al brotonat alemwejwedh fi alemadh alekyemya'eyh (number of protons present in the chemical substance):**  The passage refers to hydrogen *ions* (H+), not just protons.  Moreover, knowing the total number of protons isn't enough; you need to know their concentration in a solution.
* **D: 3dd al elektronat alemwejwedh fi alemadh alekyemya'eyh (number of electrons present in the chemical substance):**  Electron count is irrelevant to acidity/basicity. The focus is on the hydrogen ion concentration.

This translates to: ""The amount of hydrogen ions (hydrogen in the hydrogen ion concentration) indicates the level of the hydrogen ion concentration in the tested chemical substance.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: al brotonat (protonation)** - Protonation is the process of adding a proton (H+) to a molecule. Hydrogen ions *are* protons, but the question asks about the *amount* of hydrogen ions, not the process of protonation.
* **C: al quluwiya (basicity)** - Basicity refers to the ability of a substance to accept hydrogen ions. While related, it's not the *amount* of hydrogen ions itself.
* **D: al elektronat (electrons)** - Electrons are negatively charged particles. Hydrogen ions are formed when hydrogen *loses* its electron, becoming a proton.

ay men alejmel atalyh la tesf bedqh qety' asewd?,"The question asks which of the options **does NOT** accurately describe a pride of lions. Let's break down the description provided in the text and analyze each option:

* **Text Summary:** Lions live in prides, which consist of 1-3 adult males, several females, and cubs. Females are closely related and form strong family bonds.  Prides behave similarly to wolf packs or dogs, and are very aggressive.

Now let's analyze each option:

* **A: yetserfewn beshekl meshabh leqtey' aleklab (They behave similarly to dog packs):**  The text explicitly states ""Tasarraf jama3at al-2usud methla qati3 al-dhi2ab aw al-kilab"" (Lion prides behave like wolf packs or dogs).  This is **accurate**.

* **B: nesbh aledkewr ela alenath leyset metsaweyh (The number of males to females is not equal):** The text mentions ""ma yasel ila thalathina 2untha wa sheblan"" (up to thirty females and cubs) and ""1-3 adult males."" This means there's a significantly lower number of males compared to females.  This is **accurate**.

* **C: aledkewr walenath jami3ehem mertebtewn aretbataan wetheyqaan (Males and females are all connected by close and strong bonds):** The text states ""wa aydan takunu moumitah lel ghayah bi nisabti li fara2isiha"" (and they are extremely aggressive regarding their territories). The text also specifically says ""Female are closely related and form strong family bonds."" While aggressive regarding territory, the bonds *within* the pride are strong, especially amongst the females. This is **accurate**.

* **D: hem memyetwen wajetma'eyewn (They are aggressive and social):** The text states ""hem memyetwen wajetma'eyewn"" (they are aggressive and social). The text also states ""Tasarraf jama3at al-2usud methla qati3 al-dhi2ab aw al-kilob"" (prides behave like wolf packs or dogs) which indicates they are social. and ""Tasarraf jama3at al-2usud methla qati3 al-dhi2ab aw al-kilob"" (and are very aggressive). This is **accurate**.

Since all of the options are accurate based on the text, there must be an error in the problem. However, the options all state that the lions are aggressive and social. Considering the fact that the lion packs are known to be one of the most aggressive species and maintain the strongest social structure it could be assumed that the most accurate description is social.

**Therefore, the most likely intended answer is C or D.**"

Males usually have close bonds with each other, forming large family groups of brothers and sisters. Lion prides are like wolf packs or dog packs, and other animals greatly resemble lions in behavior (but not other large cats)). The text compares their behavior to wolf packs and dog packs which involve hunting and social dynamics, not necessarily ""playful"" behavior. However, the description ""other animals greatly resemble lions in behavior"" supports that lions engage in hunting and social dynamics. **This could be considered correct or incorrect depending on how strictly we define ""playful"".**

*   **C:  (This option is missing from your provided options)**

*   **D:  (This option is missing from your provided options)**

Because option B refers to ""playful behavior"" while the text focuses on hunting and social dynamics, we can assume **option B is incorrect.**

Without options C and D, we'd need to pick between B, or the missing options.

I'd assume based on the missing options, that the best option would be **B** since it is the most incorrect.



I will confirm that option B is incorrect.

Final Answer: The final answer is $\boxed{B}$"
alaraneb feryesh sha'e'eh lay new' men alheywanat alemfetresh?,"The correct answer is **C: aleqtet metwesth alhejm** (medium-sized).

Here's why:

The Arabic text states: ""Yujad adnaha qe6a6 mutawasi6at al a7jem... bed2an mina al araneb... wal ghizlan.""  This translates to: ""The smallest of them are medium-sized rabbits... starting from rabbits... and reaching deer.""

The question asks why rabbits are a common type of predatory animal. The text establishes that rabbits belong to the medium-sized category and are part of a range of sizes that includes other predatory animals.  Therefore, their medium size makes them a significant part of the food chain and a common predator.

This translates to: ""Finally, there are many small foxes (including the arctic fox) that eat the smaller prey more frequently, such as insects, rodents, and birds.""

Therefore, rodents (al qawared) are listed as one of the animals that the small foxes eat. The other options (rabbits, wolves, deer) are mentioned as examples of foxes but are not directly stated as prey of the small foxes in this passage.

This translates to: ""All the animals that the ocelot hunts are much smaller than it in size, approximately.""  It *doesn't* say they *only* hunt small animals.  They hunt a variety of animals that are smaller than themselves.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: aletmahey ma3 m7ythem** (They camouflage with their surroundings):  The text says ""yumkinuha al-ru2ya jayyida fy al-'6alam bilru2yati al-layliya walatta7aruk bikhilsa shadyda kathalik. ta96ad al-a9lwt fara2saha min khilal al-indimaj fy tafa9yl al-by2a al-mu7y6a biha thumma al-an8'9a'9 3ala fara2siha.""

This means ""The ocelot takes its chances by blending into the patterns of its surrounding environment and then pouncing on its prey."" Pouncing suggests a chase initiated by scent or sight.
* **C: alelyel** (At night): The text states ""yumkinuha al-ru2ya jayyida fy al-'6alam bilru2yati al-layliya..."" which means ""It has good vision in the dark with excellent night vision...""  Therefore, they hunt at night.

The tiger's roar doesn't resemble the lion's roar with its growl, but it resembles a series of roars and growls.""

The passage doesn't mention differences in their ability to climb, jump, or strength compared to black panthers (which are leopards, not a separate species). The primary difference highlighted is the nature of their roar.

The text describes how a group of settlers, when faced with a new environment (different resources, different competitors), are *forced* to develop new traits and adaptations to survive and compete more effectively. This adaptation is a key part of the overall process of evolution described in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: mejmew'eh segheyrh tefshel fi alazedhar fi mewq' jedyed (A small group fails to thrive in a new location):** While the text mentions that some groups might disappear, the core idea is not about failure, but about adaptation and evolution.

Translation: ""Most insects are characterized by their ability to have two pairs of wings, and also by their body length. This enables them to have a wide space for maneuvering to escape from predators.""

The key phrase is ""majmu3a wasi3a min alamakn assaghira lil ikhtiba2"" which means ""a wide space for maneuvering.""  Having two pairs of wings, combined with body length, allows insects a larger area to maneuver and evade predators. Therefore, the area of maneuvering is increased.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: emedadat alegheda' (food extensions):** While insects use wings to find food, the text doesn't directly link wing pairs to food extensions.
* **C: al'ethewr 3la alazewaj (mating success):** Wings *can* be used for mating displays, but the text primarily emphasizes predator evasion, not mating success.
* **D: ser'eh aletyeran (flight speed):**  The text doesn't state that having two pairs of wings necessarily increases flight speed.  Maneuvering is the emphasized benefit.



"
ay mema yely lm yedker fi alfqrh ba'etebarh shey'eaan yetather beqderh alhesherh 3la aletyeran?,"The correct answer is **B: meda alheyah** (the length of the body).

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that insects benefit from their ability to fly due to their **short body length**, providing them with a wider space to maneuver and escape predators. The text specifically says ""Tatamayaz mu3zam al7asharat bi qudratiha 3la thany ajni7atiha marra ukhra bi tul aljism."" which translates to ""Most insects are characterized by their ability to have two wings, and also by the length of their body.""  This suggests that while body length is mentioned, it's not presented as a *benefit* of flight in the same way that short body length is.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aletkather (reproduction):** The text states that flight helps insects find mates for better reproduction.
* **C: jema3 alegheda' (gathering food):** The text mentions that flight helps insects search for food.
* **D: alef'ealeyh (predators):** The text explicitly states that flight helps insects escape predators.

Therefore, the length of the body isn't described as something that directly benefits insects from their ability to fly, unlike other aspects mentioned in the text.



"
ay men alekhesa'es atalyh la tertebt 'eadh ma3 aledyenasewrat?,"The correct answer is **B: aleryesh (feathers)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that scientists believe birds (""tuyur"") are the descendants of dinosaurs. It highlights several dinosaur-like features in birds:

*   Clawed feet
*   Laying eggs
*   Bipedal stance (walking on two legs like a T-Rex)

While feathers are a key characteristic of birds, the passage emphasizes that these features, along with other similarities, link birds to dinosaurs. The passage doesn't suggest feathers are *not* related to dinosaurs, but rather highlights *other* features that strengthen that connection.

The other options are all mentioned as dinosaur-like features in birds:

*   **almshey 3la alesaq alekhelfeyh (walking on hind legs):** The passage says birds walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex.
*   **wed' alebyewd (laying eggs):** The passage explicitly states that dinosaurs laid eggs and birds do too.
*   **aqedam dat mekhaleb (clawed feet):** The passage states birds have claws.



Therefore, feathers aren't considered *unrelated* to dinosaurs, they are just not specifically mentioned in the features listed in the passage as linking modern birds with their dinosaur ancestors.



"
ay mema yely la y'etebr 'eadh semh meshetrekh beyn aletyewr waledyenasewrat?,"The correct answer is **C: aleqderh 3la aletyeran (The ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""La ya3tabirohom alkathir mina annaha daynasurat nadharan li annaha tamtalik rishan wa yumkinuha attayaran."" which translates to ""Many people don't consider them dinosaurs despite them having intelligence and being able to fly.""

This means the ability to fly is listed as a *reason* why people *don't* consider birds to be dinosaurs, implying it's a key difference.  The other options (laying eggs, using hind feet to walk, and having clawed feet) are all mentioned as similarities between birds and dinosaurs.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay jez' men nebat seykaseyat qed yakelh aletrayesratewbes 3la alarejh?","The correct answer is **A: alawraq alesha'ekh (the sharp leaves)**.

The text specifically states that the ""sikasyat"" plant has ""awraq al-haddah wal sha2ikah"" (sharp and prickly leaves). The Triceratops used its strong beak to remove these leaves before eating the stem.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men ataly men alemrejh an yakelh aletrayesratewbes? ","The correct answer is **D: نبات له فخ خشب سام (Plant with a poisonous woody trap)**.

The text explicitly states: ""ولذا فمن غير المرجح أن يأكلها أي ديناصور، على الرغم من أن حيوان الكسلان وغيره من الحيوانات مثل الببغاوات (سليل الديناصورات) يمكن أن تأكل الأوراق أو الفاكهة.""  This translates to: ""Therefore, it is unlikely that any dinosaur would eat it, although animals like sloths and parrots (descendants of dinosaurs) can eat leaves or fruit.""  

The reason it's unlikely for the Triceratops to eat it is because the plant is poisonous.  Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the text suggests the plant's poisonous nature makes it unsuitable, even for animals that normally eat plants.

The text states: ""الریاضات الشتویة هي الأكثر شعبية في المناطق الشمالية حيث يتنافس الأيغاليون في الألعاب الدولية والفعاليات الأولمبية"" which translates to ""Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions where the Alpine skiers compete in international competitions and Olympic events.""

Option C, ""aletzelj 3la alethelj"" (skiing), is a winter sport. The text specifically mentions that winter sports are popular in the northern regions of Italy.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kurat al qadam (football/soccer):** The text mentions football is popular, but doesn't specifically link it to the northern regions.
*   **B: alekrh aleta2erh (ice hockey):**  While hockey is mentioned as a sport in Italy, the text links winter sports popularity to the *northern* regions specifically.
*   **D: sebaq seyarat F1 (Formula 1 car racing):** F1 racing is mentioned as a sport in Italy, but not associated with the northern regions or winter sports popularity.

This translates to: ""Luxembourg long tried to be a neutral state, but Germany occupied it in the First World War and the Second World War.""

While the Belgian Revolution (B) saw parts of Luxembourg become part of Belgium, and the formation of the European Union (D) is a later development, the text directly links the occupation by Germany to the World Wars. Therefore, the Second World War is the most accurate answer to the question of when certain parts of Luxembourg became Belgian.
"

This translates to ""Luxembourg has long tried to be a neutral state, but Germany occupied it during World War I and World War II.""

Therefore, the German occupation is the key factor related to Luxembourg's neutrality (or lack thereof). The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alanedmam ela al ette7ad al Europiy (its membership in the European Union):**  This is a result *after* the period of neutrality, not a defining characteristic of it.
*   **C: alethewrh aleblejyekyh (the Belgian Revolution):** This is related to the history of the regions that *became* part of Luxembourg, not to Luxembourg's neutrality itself.
*   **D: t7wlha ledwelh mesteqlh (its transformation into an independent state):** The text mentions Luxembourg becoming an independent state, but this is a historical fact, not something related to its neutrality.

The text states: ""ghaliban ma tastakhdimu allatiniya fil i7tifalat addiniya"" which translates to ""They often use Latin in religious ceremonies.""

Therefore, the primary reason for using Latin in Vatican City is for religious ceremonies.
"
"fi medyenh Vatican, ma aledy la tusetkhedm alelghh aleyetaleyh feyh?","The correct answer is **A: aletshery' (the legislation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Madinat al-Vatican tastakhdim madinat al-italiya fi tashri3atiha wa bayanatiha arrasmiya.""  This translates to ""The Vatican City uses Italian law in its legislation and official data."" Therefore, legislation is *not* used in the Vatican City.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aletwasel alersemy (official communication):**  The passage mentions the Vatican uses Italian in its official communication.
* **C: aletqews aledyenyh (religious ceremonies):**  The passage explicitly states that Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
* **D: aletwasel aleywemy (daily communication):**  While not explicitly stated, it's implied that Italian is commonly used in daily communication within the Vatican City, as most employees use it.

Therefore, mixing sound on advanced computers is primarily used for music production.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alersewm alemt7erkh (Animated drawing):** The passage discusses creating animated drawings, not mixing sound.
* **C: aleswer (The picture/image):**  While computers are used for image processing, the passage doesn't directly link mixing sound to image manipulation.
* **D: ale'edad (The calculation/computing):** While computers are used for calculations, the passage specifically refers to sound processing and mixing.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kana li madinatay Harappa wa Mohenjo-daro mer7adh bi nidham shatef fi kulli manzilin taqriban mutasel bi nizam sarf si7hi muta6awer."" This translates to ""The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had baths with a drainage system in almost every house connected to a comprehensive sanitary drainage system.""

While other locations are mentioned having baths, the passage specifically highlights Harappa and Mohenjo-daro as having baths *with* a connected drainage system in *every* house. Therefore, Mohenjo-daro is the best answer.
"

The text explicitly states: ""Kana li madinatay Harappa wa Mohenjo-daro mer7adh bi nidham shatef fi kulli manzilin taqriban mutasel bi nizam sarf si7hi muta6awer."" which translates to ""The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a network of drains in almost every house connected to a coordinated sanitary drainage system.""

While the text mentions other locations with baths (mara7id), it specifically links the sophisticated drainage system to Harappa and Mohenjo-daro. Santorini, Egypt, and the Levant are mentioned as having baths, but not the advanced drainage system described in the text.

The Arabic text clearly states: ""Nadharan li anna al-juz2 al-sufli mena al-shafra mun7ani qalilan, 7aythu tamil al-shafra ila janib aw akhar, fa inna al-7affa al-mulamisa lil jalid tan7ani aydan. Hadha al-amr yatasabab fi dawaran al mutazalej.""

This translates to: ""Considering that the lower part of the blade is slightly curved, where the blade bends to one side or the other, then the baffle touching the ice also bends. This matter causes the freezer to rotate.""

Option A directly reflects this explanation about the curvature of the lower blade causing the rotation. The other options are not mentioned in the text.

This describes a **concave (muqa'ar)** cavity between the two layers of the blade, which causes the ice to rotate when the refrigerator leans.

Therefore, option C, ""meq'erh,"" is the accurate description.

This means to return to a lower energy level, they need to release a small particle of light called a photon. Scientists call this process ""**al-enbi3ath al-musta7ath lel esh3a3**"" which translates to ""stimulated emission of radiation"" or ""stimulated emission of photons"".

The text then emphasizes that this process involves the emission of photons, which is stimulated by radiation (light).  The other options are incorrect:

* **A: alesh'ea' (الإشعاع) - Radiation:** While related, it's not the *process* of getting rid of excess light.
* **C: alefwetwen (الفوتونات) - Photons:**  Photons are the particles emitted, not the process itself.
* **D: alaneb'eath alemhefِz lelesh'ea' (الانبعاث المحفز للاشعاع) - Stimulated Emission of Radiation:**  While close, the text specifically uses the term ""photons"" and refers to the process that *produces* photons in this context, which is ""stimulated emission of photons"".  Option B is the most precise translation of the scientific process described.



"

Translation: ""To return to their previous level, they must emerge from the unhealthy state they are in due to radiation. They do this by emitting a small particle of light called a photon. Scientists call this process ""radiation-induced emission"" **because bright light destroys harm, which causes photons to be emitted, and light is a type of radiation.**""

This clearly indicates that the emission of photons is a *reaction to radiation*. The other options are not supported by the text.

Here's why:

The text states that after 200 hours of operation, the filament burns out and the light bulb stops working. The crucial point is the safety warning:

""الأولاً، يجب إيقاف تشغيل مفتاح وحدة الإيقاع أو فصل القابل. يرجع هذا إلى أن الكهرباء المارة إلى المقبس حيثما يثبت الجزء المعدني من المصباح قد تعرضك لصدمة كهربائية بالغة إذا لمست الجزء الداخلي من المقبس أو القاعدة المعدنية للمصباح بينما لا يزال جزء منها في المقبس.""

Translation: ""First, you must turn off the control unit switch or unplug it. This is because the electricity passing to the socket where the metal part of the lamp is fixed may expose you to a severe electric shock if you touch the inner part of the socket or the metal base of the lamp while part of it is still in the socket.""

This warning implies that **electricity continues to flow to the socket even when the bulb burns out**, making it dangerous to handle the lamp without first disconnecting it. Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the text focuses on the electrical current persisting.



"

The text explicitly states: ""Awalan, yajib i8af tashghil mifta7 wahdat al-i'9a2a aw fa9l al-kabil."" This translates to ""Firstly, you must turn off the switch of the unit of rhythm or unplug the cable."" This indicates that the cable is a crucial component to disconnect before replacing the light bulb due to the risk of electric shock.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: alefteyl (the socket):** While important for connecting the bulb, the text emphasizes turning off the *cable* to prevent shock.
* **B: meftah alemsebah (the light switch):**  The text mentions turning off the switch, but it also stresses unplugging the cable, implying the cable is the more critical disconnection point.
* **C: qa'edh alemsebah (the light bulb holder):** The text refers to the ""qa'idah al ma3daniyyah lel mesba7"" (the metallic base of the bulb) and the risk of touching it while it's still connected. While important, the text focuses on disconnecting the cable *first*.



Therefore, the text directly instructs to unplug the *cable* before working on the light bulb, making it the most relevant answer.

"wefqaan llfqrh, mada yhedth 3anedma tenqesm alenwah?","The correct answer is **B: yetm theryer aletaqh (energy is released)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yu2adi taqsim annawat maratan ukhra ila itlaq ba3d min hadhihi attaqa."" This translates to ""The splitting of the nucleus releases some of this energy.""  The context throughout the passage is about nuclear fission (splitting the nucleus), which is known to release a tremendous amount of energy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yetm aketsab al brotonat (protons are gained):**  The passage discusses the *splitting* of the nucleus, not gaining protons.
* **C: tesbh aledrat gheyr mesteqrh (the particles become unstable):** While unstable nuclei *can* decay, the passage doesn't state that splitting a nucleus *makes* the particles unstable.  Unstable nuclei are already unstable.
* **D: tefqed alenyewterwenat (neutrons are lost):** The passage mentions neutrons are *part* of the nucleus and are involved in fission, but it doesn't say neutrons are *lost* during the splitting process.  Neutrons are often released during fission.

Here's why:

The text describes using artificial satellites in space to overcome the Earth's atmosphere, which distorts observations.  The question asks what reflects signals to help us adjust to the red (presumably referring to the red shift of light from distant galaxies).  Artificial satellites are a key component in receiving and processing signals from space.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: alletleysekwebat (telescopes)** Telescopes are used *in space* to avoid atmospheric distortion, but the question isn't asking about the instrument itself, but rather what *reflects* signals.
*   **C: aladewa' (medicines)** Medicines are irrelevant to the problem of observing distant galaxies.
*   **D: aleswareykh (rockets)** Rockets are used to *launch* satellites and telescopes, not to reflect signals.



"

The text explicitly states: ""Yata6allab al amr saruخan 3emlaqan yazid ertifa3ahu 3an 100 qadam li wadhe3 qamar sina3iy aw teleskob fil fadha2."" which translates to ""The matter is accomplished by a giant rocket that rises more than 100 feet to place an artificial moon or telescope in space.""

Therefore, rockets are used to launch telescopes into space.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""al7adath addwry huwa shay2un ya7duthu miraran wa tikraran bi shaklin muntazam"" which translates to ""The periodic event is something that happens repeatedly and regularly.""

Therefore, the key aspect to observe for the passage of time through periodic events is their **repetition**.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: almdh (the past)**: While periodic events can relate to the past, the *observation* of time through them is based on their ongoing repetition in the present.
*   **C: alather (the greater)**: This doesn't relate to periodic events or the measurement of time.
*   **D: als'ewebh (the difficulty)**:  While understanding time can be difficult, the *observation* of time is based on the regularity of events, not their difficulty.

The paragraph highlights Charles II's academic achievement as a positive aspect of his upbringing, leading to his success.

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: al7osol 3ala derjh 2:2 (getting a 2:2 degree):** While the text mentions this as a positive achievement, it's not the *primary* model being presented. The *process* of going to university is emphasized.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: anedm ela alejyesh qebl alanetha' men alemdersh (انضم إلى الجيش قبل الانتهاء من المدرس)**:  The passage states he *didn't* join the army immediately after school; he went to university first.
* **B: ders 'elem alathar (درس علم الآثار)**:  While he *did* study archaeology, it's not the most significant accomplishment highlighted in the context of the question about what he was the *first* to do based on the provided information.  He earned a degree which is the more noteworthy achievement for the royal family.
* **D: aletheq bekleyh Trinity (التحق بكلية Trinity)**:  He went to Trinity College, but it's not the *first* thing he did. He earned a degree *while* at Trinity.

"wefqaan llfqrh, yetqelb 3dd alemthedtheyn alaselyeyn balhendeyh bena'an 3la ay 3amel?","The correct answer is **A: eda tem ahetsab lhejat meshabhh jedaan lelghh alhendeyh** (If the dialects closely resemble the Hindi language).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yakhtalief 3adad al natiqin beha 7asab ma edha kana yatum 7isab al lahjat wathiqat al sila biha aw la."" This translates to: ""The number of speakers varies depending on whether the dialects closely resemble it or not.""

The text then goes on to say: ""Tatarawa7 al taqdirat min 340 milyon ila 500 milyon muta7addith, wa ma yasil ila 800 milyon shakhs yumkinuhum fahm al lugha.""  This translates to: ""Estimates range from 340 million to 500 million speakers, and as many as 800 million people can understand the language.""

This indicates that the speaker count is affected by *how closely* a dialect relates to the Hindi language. Option A accurately reflects this.
"
ay men ataly hey jemlh sheyhh 7wl alelghetyen alhendeyh walaredyh?,"The correct answer is **A: eadh ma yekwen henak anefsal beyn alemthedtheyn balelghetyen** (there is no separation between the two languages).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Al Hendiyya wal Urdu mutashabihatan fil mufradat lakennahuma mukhtalifatan fil kitaba. Fil mu7adathat al yawmiyya, yumkin li muta7adithi kilta al lughatayn 3adatan fahem ba3dhihima al ba3dh."" (Hindi and Urdu are similar in vocabulary but different in writing. In everyday conversation, speakers of both languages can usually understand each other.)

This indicates a close relationship and a lack of fundamental separation between the languages.  Option A captures this essence.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: hema mekhetleftan fi alektabh** (they are different in writing) - While true, it's only *one* difference mentioned.  The core relationship is more than just the writing system.
* **C: enha metshabhh fi kel men alemferdat walens** (they are similar in both vocabulary and grammar) - The text says they are similar in vocabulary, but *different* in grammar. This option is inaccurate.
* **D: tekhetlef fi alemferdat** (they differ in vocabulary) -  This is the opposite of what the text states. They are similar in vocabulary.



"
ay mema yely leys heqyeqh deqyeqh 3an abejdeyh alhanejwel?,"The correct answer is **C: akhetr'eh alemlek alerab' laserh Joseon** (It was invented by the fourth king of Joseon).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Laqad kana al Malek Sejong rabe3 muluk Joseon..."" (King Sejong was the fourth king of Joseon...). While it's true he was the fourth king, the question asks if the *invention* was by the fourth king. The text emphasizes that the invention happened *during his reign*, but doesn't explicitly say he was the *one who invented it*. The text says he was ""a7ad akthar al muluk e7tiraman"" (one of the most respected kings), but doesn't state he personally invented Hangeul.  The invention is attributed to him, but the wording implies a broader context of his reign.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **A: tem akhetra'eha fi bedayh 'ehed alemlek seyjewnej** (It was invented at the beginning of King Sejong's reign): The text clearly states it was invented during his reign (1418-1450).
*   **B: kan alasem alasely lelabejdeyh hewnan jeywenjewm** (The original name for the alphabet was Hummin Jeongeum): The text states this directly.
*   **D: tem akhetra'eha 3an 3amd** (It was invented intentionally): The text states it was invented ""3an 3amd"" (intentionally).



Therefore, option C is the only one that is not directly supported by the provided text.
"
tem tegheyyer alabejdeyh Hunmin Jeongeum fi alenhayh ela mada?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states: ""Qutliqa fil asel 3ala abjadiyat al Hangeul isim Hummin Jeongeum..."" which translates to ""The alphabet Hangeul was originally called Hummin Jeongeum...""

Therefore, the name of the alphabet changed to **Hangeul**.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey al lughat alety tathert balelghh alesneskeryetyh?","The correct answer is **B: al lughat al Europiyh** (European languages).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""al lugha al Sansekritiyya hiya lugha mu3aqqada wa ghaniya lel ghaya kanat masdaran lel 3adid min al loughat al 7adithah, tamaman methla al Latiniyya wal lati tu3addu masdar al lughat al Eurobbiyya methel al Faransiyya wal Esbaniyya.""

Translation: ""The Sanskrit language is a complex and very rich language that was a source for many modern languages, just like Latin, which is considered the source of European languages such as French and Spanish.""

Therefore, the Sanskrit language significantly influenced European languages.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, teqles asetkhedam alelghh alesneskeryetyh besbeb mada?","The correct answer is **D: التسلسل الهرمي (al-tadaruj al-haramy)**.

The text explicitly states: ""وبعد تجميع الأبانيساد تلاشت اللغة السنسكريتية بسبب التدرج الهرمي"" which translates to ""And after compiling the hymns, the Sanskrit language disappeared due to the hierarchical progression/decline (tadaruj al-haramy)."" This means the language declined over time, leading to its disappearance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: التعقيد (al-ta'qid) - Complexity:** While the text mentions Sanskrit is a complex language, it doesn't state complexity *caused* its decline.
* **B: الهجرة الريح (al-hijra al-rayeh) - Aryan migration:** The text mentions Aryan migration as a possible *origin* of the language, but not as a *cause* of its decline.
* **C: اللغات الأقرب لها (al-lughat al-aqrab laha) - Languages related to it:**  The text compares Sanskrit to Latin and mentions its influence on other languages, but doesn't connect related languages to the *decline* of Sanskrit.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men alejmel atalyh hey jemlh deqyeqh feyma yet'eleq balejadebyh 3la ayew?","The correct answer is **A: jadebyh alared setjedbek aqel men jadebyh ayew** (The gravity of Earth pulls you less than the gravity of another planet).

Here's why:

The text explains that a person weighing 90 kg on Earth weighs only 16 kg on another planet. This is because the gravitational pull of Earth is stronger than the gravitational pull of the other planet. Therefore, Earth's gravity pulls less on you than the gravity of the other planet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: jadebyh ayew tesheb akether, welheda alesbeb yeql weznek** (The gravity of the planet is stronger, and the reason is that your weight decreases). This is the opposite of what the text states.
* **C: jadebyh ayew tesheb akether, welheda alesbeb yezyed weznek** (The gravity of the planet is stronger, and the reason is that your weight increases).  Again, this is incorrect.  Weight is a measure of the force of gravity on an object's mass.
* **D: jadebyh alared setjedbek aqel men jadebyh ayew** (The gravity of Earth pulls you less than the gravity of another planet).  This is incorrect because Earth's gravity *does* pull you less than the gravity of *another* planet, but the question is about the comparison between Earth and *another planet*.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Qad yujad almazid mina al mintaqa al-mudhlima (maria) 3ala aljanib alqarib wa dhalika li anna alqishra araq kana su3ud al7imam alburkaniya ila assat7 2amran sahlan."" (There might be more dark areas (maria) on the near side, and this is because the crust was thinner, making volcanic eruptions to the surface easier.)
* **This implies:** Since the crust is thinner on the near side, there are fewer volcanic eruptions, and therefore, *less* dark material (maria) on that side. This, by implication, means there's *more* dark material on the far side.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alejaneb aleqreyb lh qesherh akether semkaan** (The crust on the near side is thicker): The passage explicitly says the crust is *thinner* on the near side.
* **B: aleqsherh areq ta7ta almurtafa3at** (The crust is thinner beneath the mountains): The passage says the crust is *thinner* beneath the mountains, not thicker.
* **D: qed yekwn henak 7imam aqel ta7ta almurtafa3at** (There might be fewer volcanoes beneath the mountains): The passage states that volcanic eruptions are *easier* beneath the mountains due to a thinner crust.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayen hey qishrat alqamar alakether sumkan?","The correct answer is **C: ta7ta almurtafa3at** (under the highlands).

The passage states: ""Innahu aqalu sumkan ta7ta al mintaqa al-mudhluma (maria), wa akthara sumkan ta7ta almurtafa3at."" This translates to: ""It is thinner under the dark areas (maria), and thicker under the highlands.""

"bena'an 3la alemfeqrh, ay mema yely y'eteqdh b3d alenas?","The correct answer is **B: alebsher gheyr qaderyen 3la asetkeshaf 'ewalem akhera** (humans are not able to explore other worlds).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Wa lakin, idha 7adatha hadha fi ayi waqt, fa min almu7tamal alla ya7duth li fatrat tawila jidan. annujum muntashira li darajat anna hunak trilyunat al amyal bayna annujum allaty tu3tabar """"jiran"""". Rubbama sayqif a7fadik fi 3alm gharib wa ytsa2alun yawman ma 3an aslafihim alqudama?"" which translates to: ""But, if this were to happen at any time, it is likely that it would not happen for a very long time. Stars are spread to the extent that there are trillions of miles between stars considered 'neighbors'. Perhaps your descendants will visit a strange world one day and ask about their ancient ancestors?""

This indicates that while interstellar travel *might* be possible in the distant future, it's currently **not able** or **not certain** if humans will be able to explore other worlds.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: safer alebsher ela nejwem akhera** (humans are traveling to other stars) - While the passage discusses traveling to other stars, it doesn't state that humans *are* currently doing this.
*   **C: alheyah mewjewdh 3la kewakeb akhera** (life exists on other planets) - The passage *does* touch upon the possibility of life on other planets, but the focus is on human exploration, not the existence of life itself.
*   **D: henak aqel men teryelyewnat alameyal beyn alenjewm** (there are fewer than trillions of miles between stars) - The passage directly contradicts this by saying there are *trillions* of miles between stars.



"
ma aledy yesbh areq kelma anetqelt b'eyedaan 3an merkez aleshems?,"The correct answer is **C: aleghaz (the gas)**.

The Arabic text states: ""Yusmma al-juz2 al-kharijy allathy narah 3indma nan'6ur ela al-shams basm al-fwtwsfyr wahuw ma yu89ad bih """"haltu al-'9aw2""""."" and ""Yusmma al-ghaz a8al waznan kullama 2bta3adna 3an markaz al-shams.""

This translates to: ""The outer part that we see when we approach the sun is called the photosphere, and it is what is perceived by photography."" and ""The gas becomes lighter the further we get from the center of the sun.""

Therefore, the gas (al-ghaz) becomes lighter the further away from the sun's center.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay jez' men aleshems mer'ey men alared?","The correct answer is **A: aleqsherh (the crust/shell)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""La yujad lil shams qeshra methel al ard yumkinuku al wuquf 3alayha."" This translates to: ""The sun does not have a crust like the earth that you can stand on.""  Then it goes on to say that the part we see when we look at the sun is the ""haltu al-'9aw2"" which is the photosphere.  The crust (qeshra) is the outermost layer, and the only part mentioned as visible from a distance is the crust.

Therefore, the crust (qeshra) is the part of the sun visible from the Earth.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Ta7duth al a6war kawkab al zuhra nadharan li2anna janeb kawkab al zuhra (aw al qamar) al muwajeh lel shams huwa al mudha2 faqat."" (The phases of Venus occur because the side of Venus (or the moon) facing the sun is only illuminated.)
* **This observation directly supported Copernicus's heliocentric theory:** Copernicus proposed that the planets revolve around the Sun. The phases of Venus are only possible if Venus orbits the Sun, and not the Earth.
* **The other options are incorrect:**
    * **B: 3bwr kewkeb alezherh (The transit of Venus):** While the transit of Venus was later important, the passage focuses on the phases of Venus as the initial support for Copernicus.
    * **C: teshabh aleshems ma3 kewkeb alezherh (The similarity between the sun and Venus):** The passage doesn't mention any similarity between the Sun and Venus.
    * **D: teshabh aleshems ma3 aleqmer (The similarity between the sun and the moon):** The passage discusses the phases of Venus, not the moon.



"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Ta7duth al a6war kawkab al zuhra nadhariyyat Copernicus al lati tanussu 3ala 2anna al kawakeb tadouru 7awla al shams."" This translates to ""The phases of Venus supported Copernicus's theory which states that the planets revolve around the sun.""  Galileo's observation of Venus's phases was key evidence *supporting* Copernicus's heliocentric theory (the sun-centered model of the solar system).

"wefqaan llfqrh, men ayen yejma3 nher al Amazon alemyah?","The correct answer is **A: anhar asegher (smaller rivers)**.

The text states: ""Ya3mal 3ala tajmi3 almiyah min alaf al-anhar assaghira."" which translates to ""It works to collect water from thousands of smaller rivers.""
"
ay leqb la yunesb ela nher al Amazon?,"The correct answer is **A: enh thaney atewl nher** (It's the second longest river).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nahr al-Amazon huwa thany atwal wa akbar nahr 3la wajh al-ardh.""  This translates to ""The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on the face of the earth.""  Therefore, it is *not* the second longest, it's the *longest* (after the Nile).

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: enh alenher alakebr** (It's the greatest/largest river): The text explicitly states it's the largest.
* **C: enh alenher alatewl** (It's the longest river): The text explicitly states it's the second longest, but also the largest.
* **D: enh alenher al'ered** (It's the widest river): The text explicitly states it's the widest.



"
ma hew mejal al3mal alemdekwer fi alfqrh waledy yewzef aqel 3dd men alefnezweyleyyen?,"The correct answer is **A: al zira3a (Agriculture)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Thultha al Venezueliyin al ladhi ya3malun fi qita3 al khadamat yu3mal rubqiihim fi assina3a wa 5umsihim fi al zira3a.""  This translates to ""A third of Venezuelans working in the service sector work in industry, and a fifth work in agriculture.""

The question asks which sector employs the *least* number of Venezuelans. Since agriculture employs a fifth (20%) of those working in the service sector (which is a subset of all employed Venezuelans), it employs fewer people than industry.  The text also mentions oil is a major industry but only employs 1% of the Venezuelan workforce, making agriculture the sector with the fewest employed Venezuelans.



Therefore, agriculture is the sector with the fewest employed Venezuelans out of the options provided.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men aleqta'eat atalyh tewzef akebr 3dd men alefnezweyleyyen?","The correct answer is **A: al khadamat (the services sector)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Thultha al Venezueliyin al ladhi ya3malun fi qita3 al khadamat yu3mal rubqihim fi assina3a wa 5umsihim fi al zira3a."" This translates to: ""A third of Venezuelans who work in the services sector, a quarter of them work in industry and a fifth work in agriculture."" 

This indicates that the services sector employs the largest number of Venezuelans who then work in other sectors (industry and agriculture).  While the passage mentions oil is important, it specifically says *only one in a hundred* Venezuelans work in the oil industry, making the services sector the sector with the most employment.

This translates to: ""Stars emit light and heat due to the energy resulting from the bond or fusion of hydrogen atoms together to form heavier elements.""

* The question asks what fusion allows for stars to do.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: bena' mefa3lat alanedmaj (building fusion reactors)** - The text mentions scientists are *working* on building fusion reactors, but it doesn't say fusion *allows* for it.
* **C: esedar aledw' walherarh (emission of light and heat)** -  This is a *result* of fusion, not what fusion *allows* for.
* **D: enesha' derat heyderwejyen (creation of hydrogen atoms)** -  Fusion is the *opposite* of creating hydrogen atoms; it's the process of combining them.



"
ay mema yely seyunesha mefa'el anedmaj mefyed?,"The correct answer is **A: alheyderwejyen (hydrogen)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tutleq al-noujoum al-dhaw2 wal 7arara bi sabab al-taqah al-natijah 3inda ertibat aw endimaj dharrat al-hydrojen ma3an li tashkil 3anaser athqal.""  This translates to: ""Stars emit light and heat due to the energy resulting from the reaction or fusion of hydrogen atoms together to form heavier elements.""

The text then goes on to say that scientists are working on creating devices that can produce energy in the same way, implying they are trying to replicate hydrogen fusion. Therefore, the desired element for a beneficial fusion reactor is hydrogen.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alenjewm (stars):** Stars *use* hydrogen fusion, they aren't the fuel *for* a fusion reactor.
*   **C: aledrat (atoms):** While atoms are involved, the text specifies *hydrogen* atoms.
*   **D: aletaqh (energy):** Energy is the *result* of the fusion, not the fuel itself.



"
ma hew aletrekyeb alekyemya'ey lelma'?,"The correct answer is **C: درتان من الهيدروجين وذرة أكسجين (Dertan min al-hayderuujin wa dhirat oksijen)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yu3addu alma2 almurakkab min dharatayn hydrogen wa dharart oxygen. Lahu nafs attarkib aljuzay2i swa2 kana ghazan aw sa2ilan aw salban.""  This translates to: ""Water is considered a compound consisting of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom. It has the same molecular composition whether it is a gas, liquid, or solid.""

Option C accurately reflects this: ""Water is made of two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom.""
"
"3anedma yetgheyr shekl alema', ma aledy seybeqa kema hew?","The correct answer is **A: alebneyh alejzey'eyh** (its molecular structure).

Although its physical states may change, its chemical state remains the same.""

The question asks what remains the same when the shape of the molecule changes.  The passage explicitly says the molecular *composition* (al-arkib al-juzay'i) remains the same.  Molecular composition refers to the arrangement of atoms - the way the molecules are built.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Matatalabat al mawad mouwafaqa bi ejma3 min jami3 al wilayat an yujri ta3dilaha..."" This translates to ""The articles required unanimous agreement from all states to carry out amendments...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: esheraf kebyer men seltat aledwelh (Large supervision from the central government):** The text actually says the central government *lacked* authority and was often uncooperative.
* **B: neqs alesleth dakhel alekwenghers (Lack of authority within the Congress):** While the Congress lacked enforcement power, the question is about *legislation* itself.  The lack of enforcement stemmed from the unanimous consent requirement.
* **D: 3dm wejwed selth tenfeydeyh wetneyh (Absence of an executive and judicial branch):**  The text mentions the *absence of an executive branch* (lack of enforcement), but the unanimous consent requirement is a separate issue related to the legislative process.



Therefore, the unanimous agreement requirement on amendments is the most directly linked issue preventing the states from easily forming specific laws.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay jemlh ta3kes bedqh halh alhekwemh alemrekzeyh khelal alherb alethewreyh?","The best answer is **D: taleft alhekwemh alemrekzeyh men 3anesreyn r'eyesyeyn (The central government lacked two key elements).**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Kana al Kongres yaftaqer 2ela ay solta li fard 2al 9ara2eb...wa besabab 3adam wujud solta tanfidhiyya 2aw qa9a2iyya wa6aniyya..."" This translates to ""The Congress lacked any power to enforce decisions...and because of the absence of an executive or judicial and administrative power...""

* **Options A, B, and C are partially true but don't capture the core weakness:**
    * A: ""tem ferd aledra'eb men qebl alekwenghers wesletat alewlayh"" (Decisions were enforced by the Congress and the authority of the states) - This is *incorrect* because the passage says the Congress *lacked* enforcement power.
    * B: ""kanet alet'edeylat 3la alemwad t'etemd 3la selth alekwenghers"" (Amendments on matters depended on the authority of the Congress) -  While the passage mentions needing unanimous consent, this doesn't highlight the *lack of power to enforce* those amendments.
    * C: ""kan memthelw alewlayh yefteqrewn ela alhedwer"" (State representatives lacked a role) -  This is a weak statement. The passage shows states were largely *absent* due to the lack of power and willingness to participate.

* **Option D directly addresses the central weakness:** The passage highlights the absence of both an executive (to enforce laws) and a judicial (to interpret laws) branch. This absence of *two key elements* fundamentally undermined the central government's effectiveness.

Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and comprehensive answer based on the provided text.
"
keyf tekteb aleklemat alemwejwedh 3la zher e3lan alasetqelal?,"The correct answer is **C: meqlewbh rasaan 3la 'eqeb** which translates to ""upside down"".

The text explicitly states: ""Yudhher al-nnas fi al juzu2 min al mustanad maqluban."" which means ""People in the document show it upside down."" This refers to the declaration of independence.
"
teshether senghafewrh bay mema yely?,"The correct answer is **A: alemsahat alekhedra' alhedreyh (the lush green spaces)**.

Here's why:

The text mentions Singapore's transformation into a ""madinat 7ada2eq estiwa2iyya"" which translates to ""city of gardens"".  This directly refers to its lush greenery and parks.  The selection of the orchid as the national flower is a result of this emphasis on gardens and natural beauty.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: aletnezh (tea):** While tea is important to Singapore, the text doesn't mention it in relation to the country's transformation.
* **C: reyadat alemghamerh (adventure tourism):** This isn't mentioned in the passage.
* **D: alefnewn alada'eyh (food festivals):** The text focuses on the natural environment and the orchid.
"
ma hey faneda meys jewkewyem?,"The correct answer is **C: hedyeqh nebateyh** (plant garden).

Here's why:

The question ""ma hey faneda meys jewkewyem?"" translates to ""What is Miss Joaquim?""  The text states that Miss Joaquim is the national orchid of Singapore. Orchids are plants, and the text also refers to Singapore as a ""madinat 7ada2eq estiwa2iyya"" (city of gardens). Therefore, Miss Joaquim is a plant.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jezyerh** (island) - While Singapore is an island, Miss Joaquim is a flower, not the island itself.
* **B: zherh** (land/soil) -  Miss Joaquim grows in soil, but she is the flower, not the land.
* **D: nesb wetney** (national symbol) - While she is the *national flower*, the question asks what *is* Miss Joaquim, not what *role* she plays.

Here's why:

The text states: ""illa annahu lam yatim attafawuq 3ala ahramat Al-Giza min 7aythu al7ajm wa attamayuz alfani fi bina2iha"" which translates to ""However, it was not possible to surpass the pyramids of Giza in terms of size and artistic distinction in their construction.""

The question asks what aspect of the Giza pyramids Egyptians in the New Kingdom were impressed by. The text explicitly mentions **size (al7ajm)** as a key factor.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: 3mrhem (their age):** While the pyramids are old, the text focuses on their size and artistic achievement, not their age as the primary reason for admiration.
*   **B: asetkhedam alhejr (the use of stone):**  The text mentions using stone in building other pyramids, but doesn't say this aspect of the Giza pyramids was particularly impressive.
*   **D: bena'ehem (their construction):** While construction is impressive, the text specifically highlights size as the primary aspect that couldn't be surpassed.

"wefqaan llfqrh, men ayen thajer alheywanat al'eashebh s'eyaan wera' alametar?","The correct answer is **B: aletlal aleshemaleyh (the northern hills)**.

The text states: ""Fi kul 3am taqriban fi shaher teshrin al awwal, yusafer ma yuqareb min 1.5 milyon min akili al a3shab na7wa al suhul al janubiyya, **3abra nahr Mara, min al tilal al shamaliyya min ajl al amtar**.""

This translates to: ""Almost every year in the month of October, nearly 1.5 million herbivores migrate towards the southern plains, **crossing the Mara River, from the northern hills in search of rain**.""
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey alemnetqh alety teghader menha akili i al a3shab fi weqt ma hewaley Naysan?","The correct answer is **A: mentaqat Serengeti**.

The text states: ""Thumma na3ud ila al shamal 3abra al gharb, maratan ukhra 3abra nahr Mara, **ba3da hutul al amtar fi Naysan.**"" which translates to ""Then we return to the north via the west, another time crossing the Mara River, **after the rains in April**.""

The text then goes on to say ""Tatadaman mentaqat Serengeti mutanazah Serengeti al wataniy, wa mentaqat ma7miyat Ngorongoro wa ma7miyat Maswa Game fi Tanzania wa ma7miyat Maasai Mara al wataniyya fi Kenya."" which translates to ""The Serengeti area, Serengeti National Park, the Ngorongoro Conservation Area, Maswa Game Reserve in Tanzania and Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya are interconnected.""

Therefore, the herbivores return to the Serengeti area after the rains in April.

The text explicitly states: ""Atlaqat Almanya 3ala al hujum isim """"3amaliyat asad al ba7er"""""" which translates to ""Germany launched the attack under the name """"Operation Sea Lion"""""""". 

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: dewnekyerk** - This is Dunkirk, the location of the evacuation.
*   **C: Kriegsmarine** - This is the name of the German Navy.
*   **D: alebheryh alemlekyh** - This is the British Royal Navy.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: "" Lel saytara 3ala hadhihi al buldan, saya7tajun ila minassat etlaq lel quwat, 7atta tatamakan al quwat min al eb7ar 3abra al ba7r al abyad al moutawasset wa ghazuw Afriqya.""  This translates to: ""To control these countries, they would need a launch platform for forces, so that the forces could sail across the Mediterranean Sea and conquer Africa.""

The other options are mentioned but not presented as a *key element* of the Italian strategy for controlling African countries. The text mentions building new ships (B) and clearing British bases in Egypt (D), but these are presented as steps *towards* establishing the launch platform (C), not as the central strategy itself.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy a'etebr alhedf alasasey leyetaleya men alherb?","The correct answer is **A: alasetyela' 3la alebledan alaferyeqyh** (Controlling the African countries).

The text explicitly states: ""tamaththalat al ahdaf al ra2isiyya al Italiyya fi al duwal al Afriqiyya."" which translates to ""The main goals of the Italians were in the African countries.""  The rest of the text explains *why* they wanted to control these countries (for a launch platform, etc.) but the primary goal itself is stated as controlling Africa.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bena' jeysh webheryh aqewa** (Building a stronger army and navy): While they did build new divisions, the text emphasizes the need for a launch platform for forces to invade Africa, not simply a stronger army and navy in general.
* **C: aletkhels men alesfen alemseryh** (Getting rid of British bases in Egypt): This is a *necessary step* to achieve the main goal (controlling Africa) but not the main goal itself. It's a tactic.
* **D: enesha' qewa'ed beryetaneyh** (Establishing British coastal bases): This is completely unrelated to the main goal described in the text. The text emphasizes *removing* British bases.



"

The text states: ""Hakula2 hum al Faransiyoun al ladhin sana3u as-salam ma3a al Alman 3am 1940 wa ta3awanu ma3 al ghuzat fil 3amal badalan min qitalihim."" This translates to: ""I say that they are the French who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders in work instead of fighting them.""  The French in power at that time were the fascist French.  Therefore, they established a relationship with the Germans.
"
men hem alhelfa' alemsharekwen fi 3malyh deraghewn?,"The correct answer is **A: alameryekyewn waleqwat alefrenseyh alherh** (The Americans and the Free French forces).

The text explicitly states: ""La8ad 7arrar al-amrykywn wal8uwat al-faransiya al-7urra janub Farnsa fy mudta la tatajawaz usbu3ayn..."" (The Americans and the Free French forces liberated southern France in a period not exceeding two weeks...).



The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: hekwemh feyshey alefrenseyh walameryekyewn** (The Vichy French and the Americans) - The text refers to the Free French, not the Vichy regime.
*   **C: alaleman walefrenseywen** (The Germans and the French) - While Germans were invaders, the text focuses on the liberation *by* Americans and Free French.
*   **D: alameryekyewn walaleman** (The Americans and the Germans) - Germans were the invaders; the text describes the liberation of France.



"
tesbeb tetweyr ay teknewlewjeya fi bed' aleghewasat fi alesfer thet alema'?,"The correct answer is **D: aleradar (radar)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Fi bidayat nushub al 7arb, laqad safaru fi al ghaleb 3abra al ba7r, wa laken 3endama bada2a al radar fi al 6a6awwor wa asba7a akthar deqqatan, edh6arrat al ghawwasat ila al ghaws ta7ta al ma2 li tajannub ru2yataha.""

This translates to: ""At the beginning of the war, they mostly sailed across the sea, but when radar became more accurate, submarines retreated to dive underwater to avoid being seen.""

Therefore, the development of radar was the key technological advancement that led submarines to dive deeper and avoid detection.  The text directly links the improvement of radar technology to the change in how submarines operated.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: U-Boates (U-Boats):** U-Boats were a *type* of submarine, not a technology that *caused* the change in how submarines operated.
*   **B: meda etelaq alenar (the range of firing):** While range is important, it wasn't the primary driver for the shift to deeper diving.
*   **C: alemlahh (ammunition):** Ammunition isn't a technological advancement related to submarine diving behavior.



"
"khelal asetkhedamha alawel, kan netaq aleghewasat mhedwedaan jedaan fi ay mejal?","The correct answer is **C: etelaq alenar** (firing weapons).

The text states: ""Fi dhalika al waqet kanu yattasimun bil bu6u2 al shadid wa kana nitaq ar-rimaya ma7dudan lil ghaya."" which translates to: ""At that time they operated with intense stealth and the firing range was extremely limited."" This directly refers to the limited range when firing weapons (or torpedoes) from the submarines.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, men aledy anethek alatefaqeyh? ","The correct answer is **D: aleswefyetyewn** (the Soviets).

The text explicitly states that more than 800,000 soldiers of the **Red Army (aljaysh al a7mar)** entered Poland, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts. The Soviet actions are described as a violation of treaties like the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet Non-Aggression Pact with Poland, and other international agreements. Therefore, the Soviets are the ones involved in the agreements being violated.
"
ay mema yely lm yenfedh alejyesh alahemr?,"The correct answer is **C: e'eadh tenzeym 3la tewl alejser** (to re-establish order along the length of the bridge).

Here's why:

The text states that the initial plan was to retreat and re-establish order *along the length of the bridge*. However, the Soviet Red Army invaded eastern Poland, creating the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, and thereby *not* fulfilling the initial plan.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: enesha' jebhh awekraneyh** (to establish the Ukrainian front): This *did* happen, according to the text.
* **B: ajetyah alemnateq alesherqeyh** (to invade the eastern regions): This *did* happen, according to the text.
* **D: anethak alema3eahedh** (to violate the treaties):  The text explicitly states that the Soviet invasion *violated* treaties. It doesn't say the Red Army *didn't* violate them.

Therefore, the only option that represents a planned action that *was not carried out* is re-establishing order along the length of the bridge.



"

The text states: ""في كamin sharq Bardia، 2asara albritانيون almuhandis al3am lil jaysh al itali al3ashير، **الجنرال Lastucci**."" which translates to ""In an ambush east of Bardia, the British captured the chief engineer of the Italian army's tenth army, **General Lastucci**.""

The other options are incorrect:

*   B: قتيل في طبرق (Kutil fi Tobruk - Killed in Tobruk) - While Marshal Balbo was killed in Tobruk, this refers to a different person.
*   C: ألقبنتانيون ألقبض عليه (Alqabtanayyun alqabdu alayh - The British captured him) - This is true, but the *where* he was captured is more specific and mentioned in the text.
*   D: قتيل بينيران صديقة (Kutil bi niran sadyaqah - Killed by friendly fire) - This describes how Balbo was killed, not Lastucci.



"

The text states: ""fi 28 Yunyu/7uzayran, qutila almarishal Italo Balbo, al7akim al3am li Libya wa waliy 3ahd Mussolini bi niran sadiqa athna2 hubutih fi **Tobruk**.""  This translates to ""On July 28th/August 7th, Marshal Italo Balbo was killed by friendly fire during his landing in **Tobruk**.""
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men aletqenyat atalyh jez' mhem men aletamel aletbety?","The correct answer is **A: memaresh temareyn aletnefs (directly practicing breathing exercises)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Min khilal al-yoga al-kundalini, tastayqidhu taqat kundalini...an tariq awdha3 al-yoga wa **tamarin attanafus** wa attaghani wa attakhayulat."" (Through Kundalini yoga, Kundalini energy is awakened...through yoga postures and **breathing exercises**, chanting, and visualizations.)

While the other options (visualization, yoga postures, and chanting) are mentioned as part of Kundalini yoga, the passage directly links *breathing exercises* as a key component within that practice.
"
"""wefqaan llfqrh, keyf yetm tensheyt aleshakerat athena' """"merkez"""" aletamel aletbety?""","The correct answer is **B: eber tekheyl alalhh (through visualization)**.

The text specifically mentions the activation of chakras through ""tajsyd al-2aliha al-mukhtalifa"" (the embodiment of different deities).  Visualization of deities is a key component of Tantric practices used to activate the chakras.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: men khelal wed'eyat aleyweja alemkhetlefh (through different mantras)**: Mantras are important for focusing the mind, but while mentioned in the overall text context, they are not the primary method for *stimulating* the chakras.
* **C: tekrar aletraneym (repeating the name)**: Similar to mantras, repeating a name is helpful, but visualization is presented as the core mechanism.
* **D: memaresh temareyn aletnefs (direct breathing exercises)**: Breathing exercises are definitely part of the overall practice, but the text connects chakra stimulation more directly to visualization and the embodiment of deities within tantric methods.



Therefore, **B: eber tekheyl alalhh (through visualization)** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.



"

The text states: ""bada2 al-mughany Sangu Sharma fi al-masa2 yaleihi Gay Shankar Tshudary."" (The singer Sangu Sharma started in the evening followed by Gay Shankar Tshudary.)

Therefore, Jai Shankar Choudhary is the second singer mentioned to have performed during the program.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, men qedm aghenyh deyneyh athena' teqdeym alet3am?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

Lakkha Singh presented the Chhappan Bhog show, accompanied by singer Raju Khandelwal.""

Therefore, Lakkha Singh presented the devotional songs and the food offering.



"

The text states: ""al-mughanniya al-turkiya Syzyn Aksu 3ar'9an ghina2yan ma3 al-tynwr al-ey6aly Alysandrw Safyna walmughany al-yunany Harys Alyksw."" which translates to ""The Turkish singer Sezen Aksu presented a musical performance with the high tenor Alessandro Safina and the Greek singer Haris Alexiou.""

This is mentioned *before* the performance of the ""Nar al-Anadolu"" dance troupe. Therefore, Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou were the performers immediately before the final act described.



"
ma hey jenseyh Alessandro Safina?,"The correct answer is **B: yewnaney (Greek)**.

The text states: ""almughany al-yunany Harys Alyksw"" which translates to ""the Greek singer Harys Alyksw"".  Alessandro Safina is mentioned right after, indicating he is the other singer performing with Alyksw. Therefore, he must be Greek.
"
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay men alejmel atalyh gheyr sheyhh?","The correct answer is **C: au'etey alerkab meyah** (The passengers were drowning in water).

Here's why:

* **The passage describes a very hot day (90 degrees Celsius) and the discomfort of being trapped in a crowded train.**  The focus is on the heat and the delay in releasing people.
* **Option A (""kan henak heryeq fi saneta kelara"" - There was a fire in the Santa Clara train)** is plausible and consistent with a dangerous situation.
* **Option B (""kan alenas 'ealeqyen 3la qetar af'ewaney"" - The people were stuck on a runaway train)** is also possible and fits the context of a dangerous train situation.
* **Option D (""asetgherq alamer 60 deqyeqh 3la alaqel lekheraj awel shekhes men aleqtar"" - It took at least 60 minutes to get the first person out of the train)** is a direct quote from Scott Kouns, confirming the delay.
* **Option C (""au'etey alerkab meyah"" - The passengers were drowning in water)** is completely unrelated to the passage's content. The passage describes extreme heat, not water.

Therefore, option C is the only statement that doesn't align with the provided information.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, men aledy adela bet'eleyq beshan mestewa alherarh gheyr alemreyh?","The correct answer is **A: musheghel aleqtar (train operator)**.

The text states that the train operator (musheghel aleqtar) was responsible for getting people out of the train due to the extreme heat. The quote from Scott Kouns directly mentions the heat being 90 degrees inside the train and the unpleasantness of being trapped for a long time. Therefore, the train operator is directly involved in addressing the issue caused by the high temperature.

The text states: ""Lakina alkahraba2 2inqata3at mu2aqatan fi Tonga..."" which translates to ""But electricity was cut off immediately in Tonga..."" This is the only place mentioned where a power outage occurred due to the tsunami.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, keyf tathert tewnegha baneqta' aletyar alekherba'ey?","The correct answer is **D: lem tetmekn alesletat men telqey alethedyerat dat aleslh (the authorities were unable to receive the warning)**.

This translates to ""But the electricity was cut off completely, which prevented the authorities in Tonga, according to what was circulated in the media, from receiving a warning about a tsunami issued by the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC).""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: aubelgh 3an b3d aladerar (reported after some damage):** The text doesn't mention any damage reported *before* the power outage.
* **B: lem tetleq alesletat aneba' beshan alethedyerat alemrefw'eh (the authorities didn't receive a warning regarding the measured levels):** While the warning was the issue, the phrasing isn't accurate. The authorities didn't miss the *measured levels* themselves, they missed the *warning* based on those levels.
* **C: tathert qera'at mestewa seth alebher (the measured levels of the sea were affected):** The text mentions the measured levels, but it doesn't say they *affected* anything. It's the lack of a warning based on those levels that's important.

The text explicitly states: ""Wajahat al-shorta al-nyuzalandiyya mushkilatan fi istikhdam banadeq al-radar al-sari3a li ma3rifat mada al-sur3a al-lati yasir biha Reid bi-sabab inkhifad mustawa sayarat Balck Beauty.

(The New Zealand police faced a problem in using the fast radar guns to know the speed at which Reid was driving due to the low level of the Black Beauty car. And the police were able to control Mr. Reid's speed one time when he reduced his speed to 160 kilometers per hour.)

This indicates that the police *were* able to use the radar guns when he was driving at 160 km/h. Options B, C, and D are not supported by the text.

This translates to: ""The New Zealand police faced a problem in using the rapid radar guns to determine the speed at which Reid was traveling due to the **low level of the Black Beauty car**.""

A low car obstructed the radar signal, making accurate speed measurement difficult. The other options are incorrect based on the text.

* **The paragraph (P)** states: ""2u'9rimat al-niran fi sijn 2abu '3rib al-3ira8i 5ilal a3mal 4a'3ab"" which translates to ""Shots were fired in the Abu Ghraib prison during the events.""

Therefore, option D directly reflects the information provided in the paragraph. The other options are not explicitly mentioned or are not the primary event described.
"
lemaza aketseb alesjen al'eraqey sema3eh sey'eh? ,"The correct answer is **D: aketshaf esa'h ma3eamelh alesjena' (discovery of the abuses within the prison)**.

Here's why:

* **The Arabic text states:** ""sa2at sum3at al-sijin ba3da iktishaf sou2 mu3amalat al-sujuna2 ba3da tawali al-quwwat al-amarikiyya li zimam al-2umur.""
* **Translation:** ""The prison's reputation worsened after the discovery of the prison abuses after the prolonged control of the American forces.""

Option D directly reflects this information. The discovery of abuses (mu3amalat al-sujuna2) is what led to the prison's bad reputation (sum3at al-sijin).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: adermet feyh alenyeran (it was set on fire):** While there might have been incidents of fire, the text focuses on the *abuses* within the prison, not fires.
* **B: tewlet aleqwat alameryekyh alesyetrh (the prolonged control of American forces):**  The text mentions the *prolonged control*, but it's the *discovery* of the abuses *during* that control that damaged the reputation. The control itself wasn't the primary cause.
* **C: kanet henak al3adid men a'emal aleshegheb (there were many acts of aggression):** While aggression might have occurred, the text is specific about the discovery of *abuses* (mu3amalat) which is more precise.



"

The text states: ""Laqad alghat al-firqa 3ardaha fi mal3ab al-7arb al-tidhkari fi Maui..."" This translates to ""The team cancelled its **performance** at the Memorial War Stadium in Maui...""  The context of a stadium and a cancelled performance strongly suggests a sporting event, specifically a football match (soccer is commonly referred to as ""kerh"" in Arabic).  While ""3ard"" can mean performance, in this context, given the stadium setting, it's understood to refer to a sporting event.

The other options are less likely:

* **A: ered shery (serial drama)** -  Doesn't fit the stadium setting.
* **C: hefl mewseyqey (music concert)** -  While possible, a football stadium is less typical for a concert.
* **D: heflh jema3 aletber'eat (children's party)** - Highly unlikely in a war memorial stadium.

This translates to: ""The band's management company, HK Management, did not initially provide a reason when the concert was canceled on September 20th, but the following day they claimed it was due to logistical reasons.""

Therefore, HK Management (s7erkh aledarh) offered an explanation for the cancellation.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **C: b3d tameyn aletmewyel** (After securing funding): The passage doesn't mention funding before the realization about the doorbell.
*   **D: b3d zhewr najh 3ala QVC** (After a successful appearance on QVC):  QVC marketing came later.

This translates to: ""including John Grant, that the crisis of funding and the qualitative shift in the philosophy of educational television programs led to the cancellation of the series.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: 3dm wejwed jewa'ez Emmy (Lack of Emmy Awards):** The text says Reading Rainbow *did* win Emmy Awards.
* **C: ray John Grant (John Grant's opinion):**  While John Grant praised the show, his opinion wasn't the reason for cancellation. The text mentions his opinion *in relation to* the funding crisis.
* **D: nejah Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood (Success of Mister Rogers' Neighborhood):** The text mentions Mister Rogers' Neighborhood as a successful show, but it doesn't say its success contributed to Reading Rainbow's cancellation.



Therefore, insufficient funding is the direct cause mentioned in the text for the show's cancellation."

*   **C: anha melwethh balefteryat (it is infected with pests):** The text doesn't mention pests as the reason for the danger.



Therefore, option D is the only option directly supported by the text."

The text explicitly states: ""Sarra7a David O'Shannessy kabir mufatishi RSPCA New South Wales li eza3at ABC anna muraqabat wa taftish al-masale5 yajeb an takuna amran sha2i3an fi Australia. **Satursil al-dawa2ir al-talfizywniya al-mu'3la8a bitta2kyd 2eshartaa 8awiyatan ela 2ula2ik al-ashkha9 allathyn ya3malwn ma3 al-7ayawanat** mafaduha anna al-rafahiya hiya al-awlawiya al-8u9wa."" 

This translates to: ""David O'Shannessy, chief inspector of RSPCA New South Wales, told ABC that monitoring and inspection of slaughterhouses should be a common thing in Australia. **Closed-circuit television cameras will be strongly installed, with a clear signal directed at those who work with animals**, the purpose of which is that welfare is the highest priority.""

Therefore, the focus is on the installation of closed-circuit television cameras.

"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy yemken an yesa'ed fi terseykh ahemyh r'eayh alheywanat leda 'emal alemselkh alasetraleyyen?","The correct answer is **C: 3malyat tefteysh alemsalekh alemtekrerh (Frequent slaughterhouse inspections)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Sarra7a David O'Shannessy kabir mufatishi RSPCA New South Wales li eza3at ABC anna muraqabat wa taftish al-masale5 yajeb an takuna amran sha2i3an fi Australia."" (David O'Shannessy, chief inspector of RSPCA New South Wales, told ABC that slaughterhouse monitoring and inspections should be a common occurrence in Australia.)

* **The purpose of the CCTV cameras:** The text explains that the CCTV cameras are meant to ""ta2kyd 2eshartaa 8awiyatan ela 2ula2ik al-ashkha9 allathyn ya3malwn ma3 al-7ayawanat mafaduha anna al-rafahiya hiya al-awlawiya al-8u9wa."" (strongly emphasize to those who work with animals that welfare is the priority). This is achieved through frequent inspections where the footage can be reviewed.

While options A and B are related to animal welfare and the RSPCA, the text directly links the strengthening of the importance of animal welfare to *frequent slaughterhouse inspections*. Option D is incorrect as ABC is just reporting the information, not directly contributing to animal welfare through these measures.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey mhenh aleshekhes aledy tem a'eteqalh?","The correct answer is **A: taleb (student)**.

The text states: ""wa yablughu min al-3umur 16 3aman"" which translates to ""and he reaches the age of 16 years old"".  It also refers to him as ""talib"" which means ""student."" Therefore, the person arrested is a student.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, beynema kanet alakhebar tentesher 3an a'eteqal akher, aqeymet jenazat lekm men aledhaya ?","The correct answer is **B: thelathh** (three).

The text states: ""...thalaatha min al-da7aya al-tis3a 3an annahu tamma tashyi3 janazat Jeff Weise wa thalatha min al-da7aya al-tis3a..."" which translates to ""...three of the nine victims, concerning that the funeral of Jeff Weise and three of the nine victims took place...""

Therefore, the funeral was for **three** victims.
"
"redaan 3la alahetjajat, ay dewlh lm temdey qedmaan fi atefaqeyh mekafhh aletzeyyef aletjareyh alemweq'eh ?","The correct answer is **B: bolanda**.

This directly indicates Poland did not ratify the agreement.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men alebledan atalyh qerret tajeyl 3malyh alanedmam ela atefaqeyh mekafhh aletzeyyef aletjareyh?","The correct answer is **B: leythewaneya (Latvia)**.

The text states: ""Laqad arja2at kul min Latvya wa Slovakya 3amaliyat al-endimam ila etifaqiyat mukafa7at attazwir attijari."" This translates to ""Both Latvia and Slovakia have resumed the process of joining agreements to combat trade development.""

Therefore, Latvia is one of the countries that decided to resume the process of joining the agreements. Slovakia is also mentioned, but it's not an option.



"
kem 3dd alashekhas aledyen aseybewa netyejh hewadeth herarh ay bewd aleza'edh?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""...wa tarik arba3at ashkhas ma3a 7uruq 6afifa"" which translates to ""...and four people with minor burns.""
"

The text states: ""Apple ...  lati wasafatha al-sharika bi annaha ''ghayr khatira.'' "" which translates to ""Apple ... which the company described as 'not dangerous'.""
"
"khelal khetabh, ma aledy qal Steve Jobs en s7erkh Apple set'eyed akhetra'eh?","The correct answer is **B: alhatef (the phone)**.

The passage states: ""الـyawm sa-tu3id ikhtira3 al-hatif min jadid"" which translates to ""Today we will reinvent the phone from scratch.""

Therefore, Steve Jobs said Apple would reinvent **the phone**.
"
ma hew alegherd men khetab Steve Jobs aledy asetmer sa'eteyn?,"The correct answer is **C: etelaq hatef jedyed** (launching a new phone).

The text explicitly states that Steve Jobs unveiled a device and said they would ""reinvent the phone."" This strongly indicates he was launching a new phone model.
"
mada a'elent Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner fi alemserh alarejnetyeny?,"The correct answer is **A: tersheyhha lelr'eash** (her candidacy for the presidency).

The text states: ""Wa a3lanat al-sayida Krichner 3azmaha al-tarashu7 lil-ri2asa fil al-masra7 al-arjentini..."" which translates to ""And Mrs. Kirchner announced her intention to run for the presidency in the Argentine theater...""
"
ayen a'elent Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner 3an neytha aletreshh?,"The correct answer is **C: fi alemserh alarejnetyeny 3la b3d 31 meylaan men Buenos Aires**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""...al-sayida Krichner 3a'lanat tarashu7ha lil-ri2asa fil alemserh al-arjentini...""  This translates to ""...Ms. Kirchner announced her candidacy for the presidency in the Argentine theater...""
* The text also says the theater is 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires (""...bi-sifatiha 3udwan fi wafed mu7afazat Buenos Aires...bi-sifatiha 3udwan fi wafed mu7afazat Buenos Aires, wa a3lanat al-sayida Krichner 3a'lanat tarashu7ha lil-ri2asa fil alemserh al-arjentini wa huwa nafes al-makan al-ladhi kanat tabda2 fihi 7amlatiha al-intikhabiyya 3am 2005 li majles al-shuyukh bi-sifatiha 3udwan fi wafed mu7afazat Buenos Aires."").

Let's break down why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fi mesrh 3la b3d 31 meylaan men La Plata** - While it's *near* La Plata, the text specifies the theater is *Argentine* and near Buenos Aires.
* **B: fi mesrh bewyens ayers fi La Plata** - The theater is described as *Argentine* not in Buenos Aires.
* **D: fi mesrh labelata fi Buenos Aires** - The theater is in La Plata, not Buenos Aires.

Here's why:

The text states: ""lam yatim takhzin al-wasa2et 3ala mawqe3 Big Brother"" which translates to ""the media (videos) were not stored on the Big Brother website.""  It also says that the law on internet content regulation applies *only if* the content is actually stored on a server. Therefore, because the videos weren't stored on the Big Brother website, the existing laws on content regulation *don't* apply to Big Brother, despite the video being available online.
"

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Yanusu qanun khadamat al-bath 3ala tandhim mu7tawa al-internet, wa lakin li kay yatimma i3tibaruhu ka mu7tawa internet, yajib an yakuna mawjudan fi3liyan 3al al-server.""  This translates to: ""The broadcasting services law regulates internet content, but for it to be considered internet content, it must actually be present on the server.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yejb an yetm bethha 3al alenetrent (it must be streamed on the internet):**  Streaming is a *method* of delivery, not the core requirement for being considered internet content. Content could exist on a server and be downloaded, for example.
* **C: la yemken tekhezyenha 3al mawq' weyb (it cannot be archived on a website):**  The passage doesn't forbid archiving.  It focuses on the *presence* on the server.
* **D: yejb an tetm alemwafeqh 3aleha men qebl hey'eh alatesalat wale3lam alasetraleyh (it must be approved by the Australian Communications and Media Authority):**  While approval might be required in *some* cases, the passage doesn't mention it as a universal condition for being considered internet content. The core requirement is the server presence.



"
men hew z'eyem alhezb alelyebraley alasetraley?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text states: ""Wa min al-murajja7 an yakhluf al-sayed Costello ra2is al-wuzara2 John Howard ka-za3im lil 7izb al-librali."" This translates to ""And it is likely that Mr. Costello will succeed Prime Minister John Howard as leader of the Liberal Party.""  Therefore, according to the text, Peter Costello was poised to become the leader of the Liberal Party.
"
lemaza la temtelk asetraleya balef'el sena'eh taqh newweyh?,"The text doesn't explicitly state *why* Australia doesn't have a nuclear power industry. It only mentions Peter Costello's support for it *if* it becomes economically viable. 

However, based on common knowledge and the options provided, the most likely reason, and the one implied by the text's conditional nature, is:

**D: meklefh lelghayh (too expensive)**

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes that Costello only supports nuclear power if it's economically beneficial. This suggests the current cost is a barrier.
* Nuclear power plants are notoriously expensive to build and maintain.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely based solely on the text:

* **A: alafetqar leld'em al3am (lack of public support):**  While public opinion can influence policy, the text doesn't mention public opposition. Costello's statements suggest he believes it *could* be accepted if economically viable.
* **B: metheyrh leljedl lelghayh (raises controversy for itself):** The text doesn't focus on controversy; it focuses on economic potential.
* **C: khetyerh lelghayh (dangerous for itself):** While nuclear power has safety concerns, Costello's statements imply these are manageable *if* the economic benefits are realized.



**Therefore, the best answer, given the limited information, is D.**



"

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**. The text implies he competed with a coach, as he's mentioned alongside another athlete, suggesting a team or coaching relationship.
"
ay dewlh ahetlet alemrekz al'easher fi betwelh sewber jey lef'eh alensa' fi wed' alewqewf?,"The correct answer is **A: fenlenda (Finland)**.

The text states: ""Katja Saarinen min Filanda bi nafis al-markaz."" which translates to ""Katja Saarinen from Finland with an excellent position.""  The text doesn't explicitly say she finished second, but the phrasing suggests a high placement, and the other options have descriptions that don't fit."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay jemlh jewl Blake leyset deqyeqh?","The correct answer is **C: asetkhedm 'emewd athena' alhejwem (used the pillar to protect himself from the glass)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Nada al-mudhi3 al-ladhi tamma i3tiqaluhu fi-msra7 al-jarima, al-hujum wa za3ama annahu istakhdama al-3amud li-7imayat nafsihi min al-zujajat al-lati kanat turma na7wahu min qibal 30 shakhsan.""  This translates to: ""The accused claimed at the crime scene that he was attacked and that he used the pillar to protect himself from the glass that was thrown at him by 30 people.""

* The text *does* say the accused claimed he used the pillar for self-defense.

* The text says Judge Blake said ""al-mas2ala shibih 7atmiyya"" (the matter is almost certain) and he would be sent to prison. This is a judgement about obstructing justice, not a statement that Judge Blake said something inaccurate.

Therefore, option C is the only one that contradicts what the text actually says. The Judge's statement about the matter being ""almost certain"" is not related to the details of the accused's claim.
"
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay mema yely lm yhedth lebleyk?","The correct answer is **C: t'ered lelhejwem b'emewd** (He claimed he attacked with intent).

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Nada al-mudhi3 al-ladhi tamma i3tiqaluhu fi-msra7 al-jarima, al-hujum wa za3ama annahu istakhdama al-3amud li-7imayat nafsihi min al-zujajat al-lati kanat turma na7wahu min qibal 30 shakhsan.""  This translates to: ""The accused, who was arrested at the crime scene, claimed an attack and stated that he used the pillar to protect himself from the glasses that were thrown at him by 30 people.""  This means Blake *denied* attacking with intent, claiming self-defense.

* **Option A:** ""adeyn bethemh e'eaqh mesar al'edalh"" (He was blamed for obstructing the course of justice) - This *did* happen, as stated in the text: ""Tammat idanat Blake bi annahu yu3arqil masar al-3adala"" (Blake was found guilty of obstructing the course of justice).

* **Option B:** ""aleqy aleqbed 3aleh"" (He was arrested) - This *did* happen, as stated: ""Wa tammat idanat Blake bi annahu yu3arqil masar al-3adala"" (Blake was found guilty of obstructing the course of justice) implies arrest.

* **Option D:** ""qeyl lh enh men alemhetmel an yuresl ela alesjen"" (He was told that it was likely he would be sent to prison) - This *did* happen, as stated: ""Qeyl lh enh men alemhetmel an yuresl ila assijin."" (He was told that it was likely he would be sent to prison).

* **Option C:** ""t'ered lelhejwem b'emewd"" (He claimed to attack with intent) - This is the *opposite* of what the text says. He *denied* attacking with intent.

Therefore, the only option that correctly identifies something Blake *did not* do, according to the text, is **C**.
"

Here's why:

The passage states the UN is focusing on funding to help countries affected by climate change and deal with its consequences. The passage *specifically* mentions the transfer of technologies to help developing countries.  

The other options are all potential uses of the funds, not something *excluded* from the UN's focus:

*   **A: tanwi3 al-ma7asil (Diversifying crops)** is a potential use of funds.
*   **C: manzil muqawima lil fayadanat (Resilient homes)** is a potential use of funds.
*   **D: aletkhefyef men athar al-27tibas al-7arary al'ealemy (Mitigating the effects of global warming)** is the overarching goal, not something excluded. The funding aims to help countries *deal with* the effects, not necessarily *mitigate* the cause itself.

Therefore, the passage *explicitly* mentions the transfer of technology, and the question asks what is *not* being used for this purpose.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy tamel alamem alemthedh fi eneqadh?","The correct answer is **A: alemal, men khelal mesharekh aletkenwelwejya (the economy, through technological cooperation)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...tabadul al-ta8niyat limusa3adit adduwal annamiya 3ala annumuw bi6uru8 a8al talwythan."" This translates to ""...exchanging technologies to help developing countries grow in a more sustainable way.""  The passage then goes on to mention funding for building climate-resilient homes, better water management, and diversifying crops.  These are all economic development strategies.  The ""technological cooperation"" mentioned directly links to economic growth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alemhaseyl (the fields)** - While agricultural diversification is mentioned, it's not the overarching theme of extended projects.
* **C: aleghabat alemteyrh alemtebqeyh (the remaining bird habitats)** - This is not mentioned in the passage.
* **D: alashekhas alemtedrerwen men sew' edarh alemyah (the people suffering from water management issues)** - While the passage mentions better water management, it focuses on the *solutions* and the *economic development* associated with them, not just the people affected.



"
ay mema yely lm yesteshhed bh alebret mewteshanegha keshey' la yezal yet'eyen alatefaq 3aleh?,"The correct answer is **C: qewa'ed alemnesha (the rules of establishment)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: """"lam nasil ba3d ila itifaq 3ala qawa3ed al-mansha2 wa jalsat al-ta3rifa..."""" which translates to """"we haven't yet reached an agreement on the rules of establishment and the introductory meeting."""" 

This directly identifies ""qawa'ed al-mansha2"" (the rules of establishment) as something that still needs to be agreed upon.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eda kanet benyen sewf tendem ela menteqh aletjarh alherh lelqarh aleferyeqyh** (If Benin is involved, it will join the African Free Trade Area) - This is a statement of potential involvement, not something still being debated.
* **B: aletareykh aledy yemken an tebda feyh aletjarh** (The date when trade can begin) -  The text says trade *could* begin in July 2020, implying a date has been tentatively set.
* **D: jewher dewabet alet'ereyfh** (The essence of the definitions) - While definitions are important, the text specifically highlights the ""rules of establishment"" as the outstanding issue.

Here's why:

The text states: ""lam nasil ba3d ila itifaq 3ala qawa3ed al-mansha2 wa jalsat al-ta3rifa, laken al-3amal al-ladhi natabannah yakfi li bede2 al-tadawol fi al-awwal min Yulyo/Tammuz 2020.""  This translates to: ""We haven't yet reached an agreement on the establishment's rules and introductory meeting, but the framework we adopt is sufficient to begin trading in early July/Tammuz 2020.""

This directly indicates that a sufficient working framework (etar 3amal kafen) exists, making it possible to start trading.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kan tareykh alebd' fi yewleyw jez'aan men sherwet neyjeyreya lelanedmam ela menteqh aletjarh alherh lelqarh aleferyeqyh** (The start date in July was part of Nigeria's condition for joining the free trade area for the African continent): The text doesn't mention Nigeria's condition.
*   **C: tm alemwafeqh 3aleh men qebl mefwed aletjarh wal sina3a fi alal ette7ad alaferyeqy** (It was approved by the trade and industry delegates at the African Union): The text doesn't mention approval by delegates.
*   **D: tem alatefaq 3la qewa'ed alemnesha wejwher dewabet alet'ereyfh** (An agreement was reached on the establishment's rules and the essence of its definitions): The text explicitly states that *no* agreement has been reached on the establishment's rules and definitions, but a working framework is sufficient.

Here's why:

The text states that the Atlanta schools showed a noticeable increase in test scores, and the Atlanta Constitution newspaper published a report highlighting problems with the test results. The report claimed the scores increased too quickly and that the school discovered internal problems but *failed to take action to address the results*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aletla'eb betqeryer Jourenal-Conestitution (Playing with the Atlanta Constitution report):** The text doesn't mention playing with the report, only that the report *highlighted* the problems.
* **B: alefshel fi alta3lem alhedrey alembetker (Failure in innovative education):** The text actually describes success in innovative education (winning awards).
* **D: alebelagh 3an derjat akhetbar menkhefdh (Reporting low test scores):** The newspaper *reported* on *high* test scores that were suspect, not low scores.

Therefore, the failure to address the internal problems discovered is the most accurate assessment based on the provided text."

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tushir al-adila ba3da thalika ila anahu tamma al-3abath biawra8 al-ikhtibar ma3a Hall, ila janib 34 min mas2uli al-ta3lim al-akharin, fi 3am 2013.""  This translates to ""Later evidence indicates that the test papers were tampered with, along with 34 other education officials, in 2013.""

The Atlanta Journal-Constitution report, according to the text, only mentioned the *problems with the test results* and the *rapid increase in scores* without mentioning the evidence of the tampering itself.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thesn derjh alakhetbar gheyr al'eadey (Unusual test scores)**: The report *did* mention the unusual increase in scores.
* **C: alefa'ez beja'ezh alemsherf alewteny 3la al3am 2013 (Winner of the national principal award for 2013)**: The text mentions the person winning the national principal award, so this wasn't omitted.
* **D: aqetrahat beshan abetkar alta3lem alhedrey (Suggestions for innovative teaching)**: The text mentions that the person had previously received an award for innovative teaching.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is B, because the evidence of the test paper tampering is the key piece of information that the report *didn't* disclose.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma hey alema3elewmat alema3erewfh b3d aletfejyer?","The correct answer is **A: al3dd alenha'ey lelesabat (The final number of victims)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""al-arqam al-niha2iyya laysat wadi7a 7atta al-la7dha"" which translates to ""the final numbers are not clear until now."" This directly indicates that the final death toll is unknown.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ay mebanen anefjert aleqnabel baleqreb menha (Which buildings did the bombs explode near?)** - The text mentions explosions near governmental buildings, but doesn't specify *which* buildings.
* **C: eda tem tefjeyr qenabel edafeyh (If bombs are detonated...)** - This is a hypothetical situation, not a fact presented in the text.
* **D: alhesyelh alersemyh lelqetla (The official version of the killers)** - The text doesn't provide information about who the killers are, only that there were explosions.

"mundhu anedmamh ela Manchester City fi 3am 2017, kem 3dd alembareyat alety khadha heysews?","The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The text states: "" Wamunthu thalik al-7in fa8ad sharak al-barazyly fy 53 mubaratin linnady fy jamy3 al-musaba8at..."" which translates to ""And since then, the Brazilian has participated in 53 matches for the club in all competitions...""

While the number of goals (24) is also mentioned, the question asks about the number of matches played.

The text also explicitly states he came from Palmeiras.

ayun jemlh 3an deywef alenzel gheyr sheyhh?,"The correct answer is **D: غلبية الهدief كانوا من أهل القدس (Ghalyabiyyat al-hada'if kanu min ahl al-Quds)**, which translates to: **The majority of the pilgrims were from the residents of Jerusalem.**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""كان أغلب نزلائ هذا الفندق مواطنين إماراتيين"" (Kan aghlab nuzala' hadha al-funduk muwatinin imaratiyyin) - ""The majority of the guests in this hotel were Emirati citizens.""
*  It also says: ""كانت حاصيل الوفاة تصل إلى 15 على الأقل مع توقع ارتفاع هذا العدد."" (Kanat hasail al-wafāt taṣil ila 15 'ala al-aqal ma'a tawaqqu' irtifā' hadha al-'adad.) - ""The death toll reached at least 15 with an expectation of its increase."" While this mentions deaths, it doesn't directly relate to the *pilgrims' origin*.
* Option D accurately reflects that the majority of the pilgrims were from Jerusalem, which is implied by the context of the Hajj pilgrimage and the mention of Emirati citizens (who might be visiting Jerusalem as part of their Hajj).
* Options A, B, and C are incorrect because the text doesn't say the pilgrims had a fever, weren't locals, or that there was a sheikh.



Therefore, the most fitting and accurate sentence describing the origin of the pilgrims is D.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men alejmel atalyh sheyh?","The correct answer is **D: kan ghalebyh aledyewf men sekan mekh alemhelyeyn** (the majority of the deceased were residents of neighboring countries).

Here's why:

* **The original text states:** ""Kana aghlab nuzala2 hadha al-funduk muwatinin imaratiyyin."" (The majority of the guests in this hotel were Emirati citizens.)
* **The text also states:** ""Wa wasalat 7asilat al-mawta ila 15 3ala al-aqal ma3a tawaqqu3 irtifa3 hadha al-3adad."" (And the death toll reached at least 15 with the expectation that this number would rise.)

This indicates that while the majority of *guests* were Emirati, the deceased were *mostly* from neighboring countries. Option D accurately reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lem yekn henak ay wefyat** (There were no deaths) - This is directly contradicted by the text mentioning a death toll of at least 15.
* **B: kan jami3 aledyewf men alemarat al'erebyh alemthedh** (All the guests were from the extended Arab Emirates) - While many were Emirati, the text doesn't say *all* guests were from the extended Arab Emirates.
* **C: kan aledyewf henak 'esheyh alhej** (The deceased were pilgrims) - The text doesn't state that *all* the deceased were pilgrims, although they were at the hotel for pilgrimage. It only states the hotel was hosting pilgrims.

The text explicitly states: ""Wa la yazalun yas3un li ma3rifat mada quwwat hadha al-istidam wa kayfa sa-yu2athir 3ala al-ared."" This translates to: ""And they are still striving to know what the power of this impact is and how it will affect the ground.""

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: hejm alasetdam (collision force):**  While the force is being studied, the text doesn't specifically state the collision *force* itself as established information. It's something they're *trying* to determine.
* **B: mewq' alasetdam (collision location):** The text mentions the satellites' altitude (491 miles above the ground) but not the specific *location* on the ground where the impact will occur.
* **D: mewq' alaneqad (location of debris):** The text states that the US strategic command is tracking the debris, but it doesn't provide the *location* of the debris itself as established information.

Therefore, the impact of the collision on the ground (how it will affect the ground) is the most established piece of information related to the collision, according to the text.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy la yezal yet'eyen thedyedh feyma yet'eleq baletsadem?","The correct answer is **D: alhejm aledqeyq lelthetm (the exact power of the impact)**.

Here's why:

The Arabic text states: ""Wa la yazalun yas3un li ma3rifat mada quwwat hadha al-istidam wa kayfa sa-yu2athir 3ala al-ared."" This translates to: ""And they are still striving to know the extent of the power of this impact and how it will affect the ground.""

Option D, ""alhejm aledqeyq lelthetm"" (the exact power of the impact), directly reflects this statement.  The text explicitly mentions the scientists are trying to determine the power of the impact.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: men seyt3amel ma3 tetb' alaneqad (who will deal with the debris):** While the US strategic command is tracking the debris, the core question the scientists are still investigating isn't *who* will deal with it, but *what* the impact's power will be.
* **B: meda ser'eh seyr alaqemar alesna'eyh weqt alasetdam (how fast the artificial satellites were going at the time of impact):** The text provides the speed of the satellites, but the ongoing investigation isn't about the speed itself.
* **C: keyf seytem mesharekh neta'ej thelyel aletkhetyet (how the analysis results will be shared):** The text mentions the analysis will be published on a public website, but the central question about what's still unknown is the power of the impact.

"wefqaan llfqrh, fi ay merkez hel baten dat merh beqa'emh aghena alameryekyeyn?","The answer is **A: alareb'ema3eh (24th)**.

The question asks for Batten's ranking in the list of the richest Americans. The text states he ranked 190th. However, the options are in Arabic numerals, and there seems to be a typo in the question, as it refers to a list of the ""400 richest Americans"". The text says Batten was ranked 190th. Considering the provided options, the correct one is 24th, although the context of the provided text refers to a different ranking. 

If we assume the question meant ""What is Batten's rank in the list of the top 400 richest Americans?"" and the text is missing information, we cannot definitively answer. However, if we assume the given ranking (190th) was meant to be interpreted differently, then the closest option that could be reached by a misinterpretation of the numbers might be 24th (though this is a stretch). But given the text specifically says ""190th"", none of the provided options are correct. 

However, if we assume the question is referencing a general list of the wealthiest individuals, and the options are the rankings provided, then ""alareb'ema3eh"" which translates to 24th is the closest option to the provided ranking of 190th.

**Therefore, there seems to be an error in the question's premise or the provided options.** The text states Batten was 190th in the list, while the options offer different rankings. However, given the options, **A: alareb'ema3eh (24th)** is the closest option to the rank of 190th.



"
lay men ataly tebr' Batten?,"The correct answer is **A: qa'emh aghena alameryekyeyn** (the richest Americans).

Here's why:

The text states: ""I7talla Batten al-martaba 190 fi qa2imat aghna 400 amrikiyyan li 3am 2008 bi-tharwatin tuqadaru bi-na7wi 2.3 milyar dolar."" This translates to: ""Batten ranked 190th on the list of the richest 400 Americans for the year 2008 with a fortune estimated at about 2.3 billion dollars.""

Therefore, the question ""lay men ataly tebr' Batten?"" (Whom did Batten rank among?) is answered by ""qa'emh aghena alameryekyeyn"" (the richest Americans).



The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: jama3eh Virginia** (Virginia communities) - Batten graduated from the college, but the text doesn't state he ranked *among* Virginia communities.
*   **C: 3dd kebyer men alema3esesat** (a large number of institutions) - This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: kelyat mekhessh lelfenwen wal'elewm** (College of Arts and Sciences) - While Batten graduated from this college, the question is about *ranking* among people, not institutions.

Here's why:

The original text states that the law prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors *in the entire state of California*. Option A accurately reflects this core aspect of the law.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: gheramat maleyh lelmekhalefyen (heavy fines for offenders):** While the law includes fines, the primary aspect described is the prohibition of the sale/rental. Fines are a *consequence*, not the core of the law's definition.
*   **C: hezr bey' aw tajeyr al'eab alefyedyew al3aneyfh lelqesr kharej California (prohibition of sale/rental of violent video games to minors outside of California):** The law is specifically mentioned as applying to California.
*   **D: ashetrat wed' melseq 3la alal'eab al3aneyfh (stickers placed on violent video games):** This refers to a *method of classification* that the law proposes, not the law itself.

Therefore, option A best summarizes the main point of the law described in the text."

The quote ""Mike ta7adatha kathiran khilala jalasat al-istima3… kuntu asta3id lidha lam asma3 ma kana yaqul"" means ""Mike spoke a lot during the hearing... I was preparing for that so I didn't hear what he was saying.""  The quote is attributed to Miller, referring to Mike.

Here's why:

The quote says, ""kuntu asta3id lidha lam asma3 ma kana yaqul"" which translates to ""I was preparing, so I didn't hear what he was saying."" This directly indicates Miller wasn't paying attention to Duvall while he was getting ready to speak.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: terk Duvall anetba'eaan leda Miller athena' jelsh alasetma' (Duvall didn't follow Miller during the hearing):** The quote doesn't mention Duvall following Miller.
* **C: thedth tefla Duvall ketheyraan athena' jelsh alasetma' (Duvall talked a lot during the hearing):** The quote explicitly states that Miller *didn't hear* what Duvall was saying, implying Duvall's speech wasn't audible or impactful *to Miller*. It doesn't confirm Duvall talked a lot.
* **D: kan yewley ahetmamaan wetheyqaan leqsh Duvall (He was trying to pay attention and focused on Duvall):**  The quote says the *opposite* – Miller wasn't paying attention.

This translates to ""And Layton requested to make changes to the draft law on environmental protection during the meeting with the Prime Minister, also demanding a new, complete and comprehensive wording for the draft law on the environmental protection party.""

The question asks who requested changes to the ""law on environmental protection."" The text explicitly says it was **Layton**.

However, the question refers to the ""draft law on environmental protection"" (which is the same as the ""law on environmental protection""). The text continues to mention that Stephen Harper is the Prime Minister of Canada, and that John Howard is the Prime Minister of Australia. Stephen Harper is the one who suggested that the changes should be made to the draft law on environmental protection. 

Therefore, the question is asking who suggested the changes, and the answer is **D: Stephen Harper**.

**I apologize for the initial misinterpretation.** I am still under development and learning to accurately process complex information.

Here's why:

The question asks what the researchers used FTIR spectroscopy to observe.

This translates to: ""Researchers found crystals in the urine of dogs when melanin and cyano acid were added. The composition of these crystals matches those found in the urine of the experimentally infected domestic animals when compared using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).""

Therefore, FTIR spectroscopy was used to observe the **crystal composition** in the urine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: weza'ef alekla** (Weak food) -  The text doesn't mention food.
* **C: alheywanat alaleyfh alemtatherh** (Experimentally infected animals) - While the text mentions these animals, FTIR wasn't used to *observe the animals themselves*, but rather to analyze the *urine* of the animals.
* **D: t3am alheywanat alaleyfh alemlewth** (The diet of experimentally infected animals) - The text doesn't focus on the diet, but on the crystal composition in the urine.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: لم يصب أيًا من الأشخاص داخل المنزل (None of the people inside the house were injured):** The passage explicitly states the driver was injured.
* **C: تم نقله من مستشفى في كامبريدج إلى مستشفى في جريت يارموث (He was transferred from a hospital in Cambridge to a hospital in Great Yarmouth):**  The passage mentions he was initially taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth and later to Addenbrooke Hospital in Cambridge. While a transfer *did* occur, the question asks what *happened* to the driver, not just what medical facilities he was moved between.
* **D: ساعدت خدمة الإطفاء في إخرجه من سيارته (The fire service helped him exit his car):** The passage mentions the fire service *exiting him from the car*, but the question asks about injuries, not the extraction process.

While other options might be true to some extent, the text emphasizes teamwork as the key factor in South Africa's success.



Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: qedrh alet3amel ma3 alekrh (ability to deal with pressure):** The text doesn't specifically highlight pressure management as a prominent feature.
* **C: ada' ra'e fi bedayh alebtewlh (excellent performance at the beginning of the tournament):** While they had a good start (26-0), the text doesn't focus on the initial performance as a defining characteristic *throughout* the tournament.
* **D: alemharat aledfa'eyh (defensive skills):** The text mentions strong defense, but teamwork and ball control are given equal or greater weight in explaining their victory.

This translates to: ""And South Africa started strongly against their southern counterparts, but soon their performance declined with the progress of the tournament.""

This indicates that South Africa's performance started strong, but *declined as the tournament continued*.  Option D accurately reflects this.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Li 2awal marra, saddarat al-Sin fi al-3am al-madi sayyarat akthar min Almanya..."" (For the first time, China exported more cars than Germany last year...). Option D contradicts this direct statement.

Let's look at why the other options are accurate reflections of the passage:

* **A: nema alaqetsad As-siny beshekl kebyer mundhu ejera' aleselahat** (The Chinese economy has developed greatly since the implementation of reforms) - The passage says economic reforms were initiated under Deng Xiaoping and the economic volume has increased 90 times.
* **B: As-sin ledyha sewq letsedyer alesyarat akebr men alewlayat alemthedh** (China has an export market for cars larger than the United States) - The passage states China exported more cars than Germany and became the largest market for automotive industry. This implies a significant export market.

Therefore, only option D presents a fact directly contradicted by the passage.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: b3d alemzeyd men aleselahat alaqetsadeyh (after more economic reforms):** While economic reforms were key, the text doesn't say it *depends* on more reforms to surpass the US. It's a potential outcome *after* existing reforms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: theml alaletzamat alety tedf' bemrhelh tenmeytha (resemble the commitments made at their development stage):**  The text *opposes* this, suggesting it's unrealistic.
* **B: aletrekyez 3la alenatej alaqetsadey (focus on economic results):** While the text mentions economic results, it doesn't say to *focus* on them at the expense of other considerations.
* **C: tejawez mes'ewelyathem alhaleyh (exceed their current responsibilities):**  The text explicitly cautions against this: ""la yanbaghi an yutlab minhum ta7ammul iltizamat tatajawaz mar7alat al-tatwir wal mas2uliyya wal qudurat"" (it should not be required of them to bear commitments exceeding their development stage, responsibilities, and capabilities).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: asas aletkhefyedat** (the basis for reductions): While the text mentions the economic result as the basis, it doesn't state this as *what* wasn't mentioned.
* **B: eseda' alemshewrh ela alebledan alenameyh beshan aletlewth** (calling for consultations with developing countries regarding mitigation): The text *does* mention encouraging developing countries to avoid the old path of mitigation, so this wasn't omitted.
* **C: tareykh yamel an yetm feyh khefd aneb'eathat alekrebwen** (a timeline for when carbon emissions will be reduced):  The text doesn't mention a specific timeline.

This translates to: ""The path of the physician galaxy exerts a force on the black hole galaxy, just as the moon exerts a force on the Earth, which causes tides and bulges.""

The passage also mentions the researchers were studying the gravitational interaction between the black hole and the path of the physician galaxy.

Therefore, the researchers were observing both the black hole and the path of the physician galaxy.

The text then implies that the conservatives are criticizing her for spending on the garbage.  The sarcastic nickname ""Bush's Frugality"" suggests they believe she is being overly frugal *to the point of being stingy* about spending on what they deem important, and the text explicitly connects this sarcasm to spending on the garbage.

Therefore, the liberals are the ones criticizing the reconstruction efforts.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ayen setkewn aladewa' men alemrekbh alefda'eyh setaredset mer'eyh awelaan?","The correct answer is **B: shemaley California**.

The text states: ""Satata7arrak al-markaba min al-sa7el al-gharbi li shamali California..."" which translates to ""The spacecraft will move from the western coast to northern California..."" This indicates that northern California is where the capsule will first be seen.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, setsejl alemrekbh alefda'eyh reqmaan qeyaseyaan lay mema yely?","The correct answer is **C: al'ewedh alaser' ela alared (the fastest return to Earth)**.

While options B and D are mentioned in the passage, they are not the *primary* benchmark the spacecraft is aiming to achieve. Option A is incorrect because the passage doesn't mention anything about a wider range of visibility.



"

The text states: ""Wajadu hunak juthata Sarwga Balaswbramanyan -al-bali'3 min al-3umr 53 3aman- fi a'36iytin mula6akhatin beddima2.""  This translates to ""There were found the remains of Saruja Balasubramanyan - the 53-year-old - in a covered container in the car.""

The text also mentions ""attabiba Malar Balasubramanian al-baligha min al-3umur 29 3aman"" which translates to ""the doctor Malar Balasubramanian, 29 years old.""

Therefore, Malar and Saruja are sisters. ""Sheqyeqh"" means sister in Arabic.
"

3la mada asethewdet eBay,"The answer is **A: Microsoft**.

The question states that eBay had three major acquisitions in history, and that it was working to diversify its revenue streams and gain popularity in regions dominated by Skype, such as China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil.  Microsoft acquired eBay in 2002. 

Therefore, the correct answer is **A**.
"
ma aledy tes'ea eBay letheqyeqh men khelal alasethewad?,"The correct answer is **B: aletwes' ela menateq jedyedh (expanding to new regions)**.

Here's why:

The question states eBay conducted 3 major acquisitions to diversify revenue sources and gain popularity in regions dominated by Skype (like China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil). This directly indicates an expansion strategy into new geographical markets.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: t'ezeyz eyeradatha (increasing its revenue):** While acquisitions *can* increase revenue, the primary goal stated is expanding to new regions and gaining popularity in those areas.  Revenue increase is a *result* of those activities, not the main objective.
* **C: t'ezeyz mekanetha (improving its platform):**  Acquisitions *might* involve platform improvements, but the context emphasizes geographical expansion.
* **D: ereda' hamely alashem (reducing its costs):**  This is not mentioned in the text.  While acquisitions can sometimes be done to reduce costs, it's not the focus of this particular scenario.



Therefore, the core purpose of the acquisitions in this case is market expansion.

This translates to: ""About 40 more people from the marketplace remained in the square refusing to return to their rooms. The negotiators tried to clarify the situation...""  This indicates that the negotiators were trying to resolve the situation with the remaining people who refused to leave. Therefore, the negotiators are the ones who were trying to engage with the people remaining in the square.

ay mema yely tesbeb fi alenhayh fi teraj' alesjena' 3an a'emal aleshegheb?,"The correct answer is **B: aleghaz alemseyl leldemw' (The effective use of tear gas)**.

The passage states: ""Wsur3an ma dakhal '9uba6 mujahazun bimu3adati mukafa7ati al-sha'ab al-fina2 wa7a9aru annuzala2 bil'3az al-musyil lidmw3."" This translates to: ""And quickly, '9uba6 entered equipped with tear gas to confront the rioters and dispersed the inmates with tear gas.""

The passage goes on to say that the tear gas was effective in dispersing the rioters. This successful use of tear gas is the reason the prisoners eventually stopped fighting and returned to their cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alemfawedat alnaje7h (Successful mediation):** While mediation attempts were made, the passage states the prisoners' demands weren't clear, and mediation wasn't successful *until* the tear gas was used.
* **C: alezmela' alesjena' alejrha (The injured prisoners):** The passage mentions injured prisoners but doesn't state this caused the prisoners to stop fighting.
* **D: heryeq (The fire):**  While the fire was a major event, the passage indicates the fire *caused* the prisoners to fight *more* intensely initially, not to eventually cease fighting. The tear gas was what broke the intensity.

This translates to: ""The Supreme Leader of the country, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has stopped relying on inflation, considering it a ""trap"" whose history goes back to before the Islamic revolution of 1979, and the state must free itself from it.""

Therefore, Khamenei believes Iran should move away from relying on inflation.

The text explicitly states: ""kanat al-marra al-ula al-lati ta3tarifu fiha masadir Iraniyya rafi3at al-mustawa bi-anna al-3uqubat laysa laha ay ta2thir"" which translates to ""it was the first time that high-ranking Iranian sources acknowledged that the sanctions have no impact.""

While OPEC, the European Union, and Ayatollah Khamenei are mentioned as parties affected by the sanctions or commenting on the situation, the text highlights that *Iranian sources themselves* were the first to admit the sanctions' ineffectiveness. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.

ay men ataly leys jez'aan men 3malyh aletsewyet fi fernesa?,"The correct answer is **D: ferz memthelw alemreshheyn lelasewat (the pre-filling of candidate lists for voting)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that voters fill out a pre-printed ballot indicating the candidate they choose. It *doesn't* say that candidate lists are pre-filled.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the voting process in France, according to the text:

* **A: senadeyq alaqetra' aleshefafh (transparent ballot boxes):** The text mentions that ballot boxes have been transparent since 1988 for voters and observers to see.
* **B: alemmethelwen aledyen yerselhem alemreshhewn (representatives sent by candidates):** The text states that candidates can send representatives to observe the process.
* **C: aletweqy' 3la qa'emh aletsewyet (signing on the voting record):** The text mentions that voters sign the voting record to confirm their participation (except for those already registered).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Allen i7da athriya2 al-alam wa qad istathmara al-kathir min tharwatihi fi al-istikshaf al-ba7ri..."" which translates to ""Allen is one of the world's billionaires and has invested a lot of his wealth in marine exploration..."" This directly answers the question of what Allen invested in to begin the 8-year search.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: therweth (wealth):** While Allen invested his wealth, the question asks *what* he invested *in*, not just the resource.
* **B: ahetmamh beqyas ala'emaq (his interest in measuring depths):**  While depth measurement might be related to the search, it's not the primary investment.
* **D: ahetmamh balherb (his interest in warfare):**  The passage mentions his interest in warfare as a focus in his exploration, but not specifically as the investment that *began* the 8-year search for Musashi.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy anefq 3aleh Allen mebleghaan kebyeraan men amewalh?","The correct answer is **B: alasetkeshaf alebhery (marine exploration)**.

The text explicitly states: ""wa bada2a sa3yuhu lil 3uthur 3ala Musashi min khilal ihtimamuhu adda2im bil 7areb."" which translates to ""and he began his efforts to find Musashi through his constant interest in marine exploration.""  It also mentions he invested a lot of his wealth in marine exploration (""istathmara al-kathir min tharwatihi fi al-istikshaf al-ba7ri""). Therefore, investing in marine exploration is the correct answer.

"wefqaan llfqrh, men alemhetmel an y'edey ay mema yely ela zerwef khetrh fi alemsen' w7wlh?","The correct answer is **B: alesyezyewm alemsh' (Cesium and Iodine)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Wifqan lil wikala al-nawawiyya al-yabaniyya, tamma iktishaf al-sizyum wal yud fi al-masna3."" (According to the Japanese Nuclear Agency, cesium and iodine were discovered in the plant.)

The question asks what is likely to be repeated in the circumstances of the plant and its surroundings. Since cesium and iodine were found, they are the most relevant elements to be repeated in the area.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: weqwed aleyweraneywem (Uranium fuel)** - While uranium fuel was likely present, the text states that the authorities *suspect* it was there and that it *might* have leaked and exploded. It doesn't state it was definitely repeated.
*   **C: aledkhan alabeyd (White smoke)** - White smoke is mentioned as something the authorities warned residents to avoid, not something expected to be repeated.
*   **D: alayewdeyn (Yod)** - While Yod is correct, Cesium and Yod are both mentioned in the text, but Cesium is a more significant radioactive concern in these situations.

Therefore, **Cesium and Iodine (alesyezyewm alemsh')** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."

*   **C: tejneb asetneshaq aledkhan alabeyd (avoid inhaling white smoke):** The text explicitly mentions avoiding inhaling the white smoke.
*   **D: alametna' 3an sherb meyah alesnebwer (avoid drinking well water):** The text advises against drinking water from the well.

This translates to: ""And he said during an interview that the new alternative is causing concern because of the high mortality rate.""

While the other options are related to XDR-TB, they aren't the *primary* concern according to Dr. Moll.  The high mortality rate of patients treated with the new alternative is what he finds most worrying.

This translates to ""An infected person can transmit the infection to 10 or 15 people in a period not exceeding one year.""

The question asks how many patients were confirmed to have contracted the new virus *from the hospital*. The text says ""kana ithnan 3ala al-aqal min 3ummal al-mustashfa ya7milunahu,"" which means ""at least two hospital workers were carrying it.""  It *also* states that ""ba3d al-marda qad usibu bi-virus min al-mustashfa,"" meaning ""some patients may have been infected with the virus from the hospital.""

However, the question is specifically about patients infected *from the hospital*.  The text doesn't give a precise number of patients confirmed to have contracted it from the hospital. It only mentions that some patients *may* have been infected from the hospital.

The question is misleading because it asks for a confirmed number but the text doesn't provide it. But among the given options, the most appropriate answer is **B: 2**, since the text specifically mentions *at least two* hospital workers carrying the virus, and it's implied that some patients also contracted it from the hospital, though not confirmed.

Therefore, the best available answer from the options is **B: 2**.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate description of the technology used in the NextGen system.

Here's why:

The text states that NextGen uses satellites instead of ground-based radar to track aircraft. This allows for **more precise tracking of aircraft movements** by air traffic controllers.

Let's look at why the other options are not the *direct* benefit to air traffic controllers:

*   **A: terq teyran aqesr (shorter flight paths):** While NextGen *enables* shorter flight paths, the direct benefit to controllers isn't the shorter path itself, but the enhanced tracking that *allows* for the optimization of those paths.
*   **C: khefd aneb'eathat alekrebwen (reduced carbon emissions):** This is an *indirect* benefit of NextGen, stemming from optimized flight paths and fuel efficiency, but not a direct effect on how controllers work.
*   **D: kemyh aqel men alewqewd (less fuel consumption):**  Similar to C, this is an indirect consequence, not a direct benefit to air traffic controllers.

Therefore, the criticism was *about* improving their success rate. Options B, C, and D are either too general or don't capture the specific reason for the criticism mentioned in the text.

Here's why:

The text states: ""...wa khasatan 7alat al-sayarat al-masruqa bi-hadaf ta3ziz mu3addal naja7 al-wikala"" which translates to ""...especially stolen car cases with the goal of boosting the agency's success rate.""  The subsequent information about the initiative and resource allocation in 2005 reinforces that the focus is on stolen car cases.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: t'ezeyz ma3edel nejah alewkalh (enhancing the agency's success rate)** - While increasing the success rate is a *goal*, the text specifies *how* the success rate is to be enhanced – by focusing resources on stolen car cases.
* **C: aletrekyez 3la alejra'em alety yejb an yekwen men aleshel helha (focusing on cases that must be solved)** - The text doesn't say the initiative focuses on *all* unsolvable cases; it focuses specifically on stolen car cases.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""sajjala 403 hadafan fi 468 mubarat"" (scored 403 goals in 468 matches).  Option A claims he scored *more than* 468 goals, which is factually incorrect according to the provided text.

Let's look at why the other options *do* accurately reflect Bobek's career with Partizan:

* **B: sejl ahedafaan akether men ay la'eb akher** (scored more goals than any other player): The text states, ""Lam yasbeq li 2ay shakhs akhar an dhahara aw sajjala ahdafan lel nadi akthar men Bobek"" (No other person has appeared or scored more goals for the club than Bobek).
* **C: tem aletsewyet lh dat merh kafedl la'eb fi tareykh alefreyq** (was voted as the best player in the club's history): The text says, ""fi 1995, 2ukhtira ka afdal la3eb fi tarikh nadi Partizan"" (in 1995, he was chosen as the best player in Partizan's history).
* **D: zher fi mebareyat akether men ay la'eb akher** (played in more matches than any other player): The text says, ""sajjala 403 hadafan fi 468 mubarat"" (scored 403 goals in 468 matches). This implies he played in 468 matches, which is more than many, if not most, other players.

Therefore, only option A contradicts the information presented in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: l'eb le Zagreb qebl Partizan Belgrade** (He played for Zagreb before Partizan Belgrade): The text says he was from Zagreb but *doesn't* say he played for Zagreb before joining Partizan.
* **C: l'eb ma3 Partizan heta 3am 1995** (He played with Partizan until 1995): The text states he stayed until 1958, not 1995.

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because:

* A: ""alezwej walezwejh kelahema men Texas"" (Both the husband and wife are from Texas) - While they got married in Texas, the husband was born in Buffalo.
* B: ""kan henak khemsh dhaya"" (There were five victims) - The passage mentions four victims, not five.

The text states: ""wa dafa3at beha al-riya7 al-3atiya wal amwaj ila 7ajez al-amwaj"" which translates to ""and the strong wind and the waves pushed it towards the wave barrier.""

This indicates that the immediate concern of the officials was the damage caused by the weather conditions. While other options are possible consequences, the primary issue mentioned in the text is the weather's impact on the ship. The worry about releasing the fertilizer cargo stems *from* the ship being pushed by the waves and wind.

Therefore, option B directly reflects the first, and most immediate, worry expressed by those involved.

Here's why:

* **A: hedth alethetm qebl aletqat alhemwelh** (The incident happened before the cargo collision) - This is stated as fact in the text.
* **B: kan 3la metn alesfeynh 100 metr men alewqewd weqt alethetm** (There were 100 meters of fuel on board the ship at the time of the incident) - This is also stated as fact in the text.
* **C: men beyn atheny 'esher men aferad aletaqem, aseyb wahed** (From between the twelve crew members, one was injured) - The text explicitly mentions ""kanat al-isaba al-wa7ida hiya kasr fil 2anf"" (the only injury was a broken nose), implying one person was injured.
* **D: duf3at alsafynh ela 7ajez al-amwaj** (The ship was pushed to the wave barrier) - This is stated as fact in the text.

Options A, B, and D are all factual statements directly supported by the text. Option C is a slight rephrasing of a fact, but the wording is subtly different. Therefore, C is the one that is *least* directly and literally repeated in the text.



"

This translates to: ""Several large television screens were installed in different places in Rome to allow the public to watch the mourning. **Similar arrangements were made in many other cities in Italy** and in the rest of the world, especially in Poland...""

Therefore, the screens were installed in various cities *other than* Rome.
"
ayen aqeymet merasem alejnazh?,"The correct answer is **D: awelaan fi rewma, them fi medyenh eyetaleyh akhera** (first in Rome, then in another Italian city).

Here's why:

The text states:

* ""Tamma tarkib 3iddat shashat telefizyon kabira fi amakin mukhtalifa fi Roma lil sama7 lil jumhur bi-mushahadat al-3aza2."" (Several large television screens were installed in different places in Rome to allow the public to watch the funeral.) - This indicates ceremonies took place *in* Rome.
* ""la siyyama fi bulanda wallati shahadaha 3adad kabir min al-nas."" (especially in Poland, where a large number of people witnessed it.) - This indicates ceremonies took place *in* Poland.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: fi mewaq' mekhetlefh fi jami3 anha' rewma** (in different locations throughout all of Rome) - While screens were in different locations in Rome, the question asks about the *location* of the ceremonies themselves.
* **B: fi bewlenda** (in Poland) - While Poland held ceremonies, the text also says Rome.
* **C: fi sa7et alqdeys btrus** (at the Church of St. Peter) - The text says the crowd couldn't fit in the Church of St. Peter, indicating ceremonies weren't solely *at* that location.

Therefore, the ceremonies took place in Rome and Poland. Option D best captures this.

The text mentions the following individuals who were involved:

2.  Zachary Cuddeback (21 years old)
3.  Edgar Veguilla
4.  Kristoffer Schneider

Therefore, there are four individuals mentioned."

The text states: ""Sila7 Uka byaqa byna...akalla 3ala ra2isi rajoulen 5amsiniy."" This translates to ""Uka's weapon malfunctioned...and aimed at a fifty-year-old man.""  This indicates Uka was the one whose weapon failed.

The text states: ""La8ad 7awalat riya'9at al-askwash walkaratyh...adkhul ela al-barnamij al-owlamby..."" which translates to ""Squash and table tennis have tried to enter the Olympic program...""  This indicates that table tennis (karateyh) was one of the sports that was voted on to remain outside the Olympic program.
"

Therefore, the Rugby Federation is one of the sports selected for inclusion.

The text states: ""Wa ba3da 250 3aman, ta7awalat Guinness..."" which translates to ""And after 250 years, Guinness became...""

This indicates that it took 250 years for Guinness to become a global company earning over 10 billion euros annually, starting from the lease agreement in 1759.
"
hewaley kem melyar dewlar tedrha Guinness kel 3am?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states that Guinness earns ""akhtar min 10 milyarat yoro (ay ma yu3ad 14.7 milyar dolar amriki) kul 3am.""  This translates to ""more than 10 billion euros (which is equivalent to 14.7 billion US dollars) each year.""

Therefore, 14 billion dollars is the closest option.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: sab3a** (seven).

The text explicitly states: ""Ta2kadat isabat batta bi enflwnza attuyur H5N1, tamma al-3uthur 3alayha mayyita fi mustanqa3at Lyon sharq Faransa."" which translates to ""A duck was confirmed to be infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus, it was found dead in the Lyon area in eastern France.""

While other countries are mentioned as having cases, France is where this specific event (the discovery of a dead infected duck) occurred.

The text states: ""Lam takun tuwajih Haiti ay mashakil muta3alliqa bil marad mundhu 7iqbat al 1800, ay qabla wusul al-quwwat."" This translates to ""Haiti had not faced any disease-related problems since the 1800s, i.e., before the arrival of the forces.""  Since the earthquake and the subsequent deployment of peacekeepers caused the outbreak, the last disease wave before that was before the earthquake.



"

The text states: ""مما sababa bi dukhul al-baktirya ila rawafid nahr Artibonite, a7ad akbar rawafid Haiti."" which translates to ""which resulted from the entry of bacteria into the tributaries of the Artibonite River, one of the largest tributaries of Haiti.""

Therefore, the Artibonite River is mentioned as the location where the bacteria entered and spread.
"
ma aledy tekhett alhekwemh alayerlendeyh lef'elh?,"The correct answer is **B: sen qewaneyn akether seramh beshan sama7eyh alemkhedrat** (tightened laws regarding drug legalization).

Here's why:

* The Arabic text explicitly states: ""Wa shaddadat al-hukuma al-irlandiyya `ala darurat tashri` barlamani li tas7i7 al-wade`.""  This translates to: ""And the Irish government emphasized the necessity of a parliamentary law to rectify the situation.""

* The government spokesperson then says: ""Innahu min al-daruriy al-yawm min mandhur al-se7ha al-3amma wal 3adala al-jina2iya an yatimma san attashri` bi-aqrab waqtin mumkin"" which means: ""It is necessary today, from the perspective of public health and criminal justice, that the law be enacted as soon as possible.""

*  The Health Minister expresses concern about individuals benefiting from existing legalization and the implications of regulations issued since the unconstitutional changes took effect.

Taken together, this indicates that the Irish government is **tightening laws regarding drug legalization** to address issues of public health and criminal justice. The initial statement about needing a law to ""rectify the situation"" and the spokesperson's emphasis on urgent enactment suggests a move towards stricter control, not legalization.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: tewzey' aledanat 3la mertekbey jera'em alemkhedrat** (explaining penalties for drug offenders) - While penalties might be a part of the broader strategy, it doesn't capture the core action the government is taking.
* **C: tekhefyef aleqwaneyn alemt'eleqh besmaheyh alemkhedrat** (relaxing laws related to drug legalization) - This is the opposite of what the text describes.
* **D: elegha' tejreym alemkhedrat** (abolishing drug offenses) -  The text doesn't suggest abolishing offenses; it suggests strengthening laws.



"
ma aledy kan qanewneyaan ma3eqetaan fi ayerlenda?,"The question asks about a law that was previously in effect in Ireland. The provided text discusses a government's urgency to legislate for correction of a situation, mentioning a law related to specific substances that was in effect *before* ""extra-constitutional changes"" took effect.  The text implies this previous law is now being repealed or amended.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: alestew** - This likely refers to ""the state"" in Arabic, which isn't the type of law being discussed.
* **B: alahetyal** - This is the closest to the idea of a ""law"" or ""regulation"" but doesn't perfectly capture the nuances of a pre-existing legal framework.
* **C: ala'eteda'** -  This is ambiguous and doesn't directly relate to a law.
* **D: alemkhedrat** - This refers to ""the regulations"" or ""the control"" - this fits the context of a law related to specific substances.

The text emphasizes that the changes that took place were ""extra-constitutional"". This suggests a legal framework was in place *before* these changes, and the current legislation is aiming to correct the situation *caused* by those changes.  Therefore, the previously existing law was likely related to the control and regulation of substances.

Considering the options, **D: alemkhedrat** (regulations or control) is the most suitable answer because the text specifically mentions ""the control related to the substances that were issued since the extra-constitutional changes took effect."" This implies there *were* regulations in place before those changes.



Therefore, the answer is **D: alemkhedrat**."
ma hew sebb aletheqyeq ma3 alejaney alemshetbh bh?,"The correct answer is **A: alet'edey 3la memtelkat alegheyr** (trespassing on someone else's property).

The Arabic text explicitly states: ""al-jani al-dhakar al-mushtabah bihi yakhda3 lil ta7qiq bi-tuhmat al-ta3addi 3ala mumtalakat al-ghayr wa laysa al-takhrib.""

This translates to: ""The male suspect is undergoing investigation on the charge of trespassing on someone else's property and not vandalism.""

Therefore, the suspect is being investigated for trespassing.
"
"3nd tegheyyer alelafeth, ma aledy lm yef'elh alemshetbh bh?","The correct answer is **B: tezyenha b3lamh selam** (decorated it with a peace symbol).

Here's why:

The Arabic text describes how the sign was altered: ""tamma atta3dil bi-istikhdam ak-qumash al-aswad al-muzayyan bi-3alamt al-salam..."". This translates to ""...it was modified using black fabric decorated with a peace symbol...""

The question asks what the suspect did when changing the lettering. The text explicitly states the sign was decorated with a peace symbol.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: gheyr ahed herwefha** (didn't change any letters) - The text clearly states the sign *was* changed.
*   **C: elhaq derr madey bha** (attached a material to it) - While the fabric is attached, the key action described is the decoration.
*   **D: asetkhedm aleqmash alemshema3 let'edeylha** (used a suede material to change it) - The text mentions *black* fabric, not suede.

While the text mentions other accusations (using vulgar language, teaching flirting, lying about being the head teacher, violating property rights), it *explicitly* states he is *not* punished for violating property rights. Therefore, it's the accusation directly mentioned regarding his current status.



The accusation of violating property rights."
"wefqaan llfqrh, men lm yuakhed rheynh men qebl rewlanedw meynedweza?","The correct answer is **D: meswerwen (Filipino photographers)**.

The text states: ""7alla al-musawiruna la7iqan ma7alla sayidda musinna, edh annaha kanat bi 7aja ila estekhdam al-mer7adh. Tamma itlaq annar 3ala Mendoza."" which translates to: ""The photographers were actually near an elderly woman, as she needed to use the restroom. Gunfire was directed at Mendoza.""

This indicates that the Filipino photographers were present at the scene and were therefore taken hostage. The question asks who was *not* taken hostage *before* Rolando Mendoza opened fire. The text says the hostages were released *after* Mendoza was shot. Therefore, the photographers were among those held hostage.

Let's break down the other options:

*   **A: sa'ehewn (Security guards):** The text doesn't mention security guards.
*   **B: rejal sherth (Authorities/Police):** The text does not mention police or authorities being hostages.
*   **C: atfal (Children):** The text explicitly states that children were among the released hostages.

Therefore, the only group explicitly mentioned as being hostages is the Filipino photographers.
"
"bena'an 3la alfqrh, ay alerha3an lm yetm aletaked men etelaq serahhem mebkeraan?","The correct answer is **D: alatefal (the children)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""7alla al-musawiruna la7iqan ma7alla sayidda musinna, edh annaha kanat bi 7aja ila estekhdam al-mer7adh. **Tamma itlaq annar 3ala Mendoza.**"" (The photographers actually targeted an elderly woman, as she needed to use the restroom. **Fire was then fired at Mendoza.**)

Following this, the text continues: ""**Sara7 set raha2en, baynahom atfal wa musinin, wa kadhlika al-musawirouna al-Filibbiniyyun.**"" (**Six hostages were released, including children and elderly people, as well as the Filipino photographers.**)

The question asks which group's release wasn't confirmed early. The text implies the children were among the hostages released, but the exact timing isn't specified, and there's no indication their release was confirmed early. The other options (elderly, photographers) *were* explicitly mentioned as part of the released group.

Therefore, the answer is **D: alatefal (the children)**.

Therefore, the proponents (or advocates) are collecting the signatures.

This translates to: ""And the proposed legislation, after its amendment, now works the petitioners in collecting a petition of 1.2 million signatures to submit it to the National Congress in November.""

Therefore, the petitioners will submit their petition to the National Congress of Brazil.

"wefqaan lerwayh Armand Versace, ma aledy hedth mebasherh qebl an yebda alheshed fi aletfa'el 3la aletqes?","The correct answer is **A: bedat alethelwej (The hail started)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""thuma tasqustu 7abbat al-barad min assama2"" which translates to ""then hailstones fell from the sky."" This is directly followed by Armand Versace's quote.  The quote then describes the chaotic scene of people running and pushing each other. The hail starting is the event that immediately precedes his devastating statement about losing his sister and her friend.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: kan al'ered metakheraan khems deqa'eq (The show was delayed five minutes)** - This is mentioned at the *beginning* of the passage, not directly before the described chaos.
*   **C: kanet henak reyah shedyedh (There was a strong wind)** - Strong wind is mentioned earlier in the passage, but not the event directly before the chaotic scene.
*   **D: feqd ather ahed aferad alaserh (One of the crew members was lost)** - While Armand mentions a person in a wheelchair being pushed, his core statement is about losing his sister and friend due to the escalating chaos. The loss of a crew member is a detail *within* his description of the chaos, not the immediate preceding event.



"
"wefqaan le Versace, meta bedat aqewa aleryah?","The correct answer is **B: b3d alametar (after the rain)**.

The text states: ""wa ba3da 7wali daqiqa tasilu al-riya7 ila 70 kilometer bi-sa3a ... thuma ya2ti al-matar..."" which translates to ""and after about a minute, the wind reaches 70 kilometers per hour... then the rain comes...""

Therefore, according to Versace, the strongest wind started *after* the rain began."
"qebl feryed, kem 3dd al'ewasef alekbera alety sujelt sherq 35 derjh gherbaan?","The answer is **B: thalatha (three)**.

This translates to: ""Fred is the strongest tropical cyclone recorded to date south and east in the Atlantic since the emergence of satellite images, **the third largest cyclone only recorded east at an angle of 35 degrees west.**""

Therefore, there have been three such cyclones recorded east at that angle.

The paragraph states: ""...wa sayasma7u lahu dhalika bi-an yakuna mutwafiqan ma3 kullen min 802.11a wa 802.11b wa 802.11g bi-sharit an ta7tawi al-ma7atta al-asasiyya 3ala ajhizat radio muzdawija.""

This translates to: ""...and it will be allowed to be compatible with all of 802.11a, 802.11b, and 802.11g *on the condition that the main station has dual radio devices*.""

Therefore, dual radio devices on the main station are the requirement for 802.11n to be compatible with older standards like 802.11b.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ser'eat aser' bektheyr (much faster speed)** - While 802.11n is faster, the speed itself isn't the compatibility requirement.
*   **B: aleqderh 3la teshegheyl 802.11b 3la 5.0 jeyghahertez (ability to operate 802.11b on 5.0 GHz)** - 802.11b operates on 2.4 GHz, not 5.0 GHz.
*   **C: natej 600 meyghabeyt fi alethaneyh (result of 600 megabits per second)** - The speed is a *result* of 802.11n, not a compatibility requirement.

This translates to: ""It was decided that the person holding the gold medal for the 100 meter and 200 meter freestyle swam across three rounds during the Commonwealth Games.""

Therefore, the answer is **B: thelatha** (three).

The question states the athlete was prevented from taking necessary medication *during* the games. This implies the medication was prohibited by the rules of the Commonwealth Games. The other options don't align with the information provided. The athlete *was* having pain (implied by needing medication), so A and B are incorrect. C is irrelevant to the reason for the medication restriction.

(News from the Icelandic Meteorological Office indicated no seismic activity in the Hekla area during the past 48 hours.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: kheryeth alezlezal aledwelyh (the international earthquake map)**: The earthquake map is mentioned as a general resource, but the passage specifically focuses on reports from the Icelandic Meteorological Office.
* **D: alenshat alembelgh 3anh fi menateq akhera men ayeslenda (activity reported in other areas of Iceland)**:  While activity elsewhere in Iceland *might* provide context, the passage's uncertainty specifically relates to the Hekla area and the lack of confirmation about recent tremors.

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ila janib 7amlih li thalath adawat 3ilmiya muhimma..."" which translates to ""In addition to carrying three important scientific instruments...""  This confirms that the probe *did* carry scientific instruments.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kan lelmerkebh alemdareyh alety atelqet alemsebar taqem** (The maneuvering vehicle that launched the probe was successful):  While the launch itself was a success, the text focuses on the probe's success *after* deployment. This statement isn't directly addressed in the provided text.
* **C: kan etelaq alemsebar najhaan** (The probe's launch was successful): The text says the probe successfully entered lunar orbit, but doesn't mention the launch itself being successful.
* **D: kanet jewaneb alemsebar theml reswemaan** (The sides of the probe were like drawings): The text mentions the probe carried a national emblem of India on all sides, not that the sides *were* drawings.



Therefore, option B is the only statement that is directly supported by the provided text.

ay men al'ebarat atalyh tesf alemsebar aleqmery bedqh?,"The correct answer is **C: tem etelaqh men merkebh medareyh ma7wlh** (It was launched from a controlled carrier).

Here's why:

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: hebt baleqreb men aleqteb aleshemaley lelqemr** (It landed near the North Pole of the Moon): The text says it landed near the *South* Pole.
* **B: kan hebweth najhaan** (It was a successful landing):  The text describes the *launch* and entering lunar orbit, not the *landing*.  While the launch was successful, this option isn't accurate in describing what happened.
* **D: kan yheml adateyn hametyen** (It carried two important instruments): The text states it carried *several* important instruments (adateyn hametyen), not just two.



Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately reflects information provided in the original text.

The text explicitly states: ""Qama al-hukumat bi'idati malayin min amubulat lu8a7 altihab addima'3, mima sayusa3id fi e3dad al-wakalat a9i7iyti lil3am al-mu8bil."" This translates to: ""The government has procured millions of doses of hemorrhagic fever vaccine, which will help in preparing the immunization agency for the upcoming year.""

The other options are mentioned as *past* measures or preventative actions, but the *final* immunization plan mentioned is the vaccine.
"

The text states: ""Yanta8il al-mar'9 3an 6ari8 al-khanazir wallaty tanta8il ba3d thalik ela al-ensan 3an 6ari8 al-ba3u'9."" which translates to ""The disease spreads through pigs, which then spreads to humans through the bite.""  Therefore, pigs are the intermediary in the transmission.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Qad yantoj 3an e5faq al-qarar al-thani, al-ladhi yaqtare7 7adhr al-zijat al-madaniyya min as7ab al-jenes nafsahu, fata7a al-bab amama al-naqabat al-madaniyya mustaqbalan.""  This translates to: ""The failure of the second decision, which proposes banning civil unions between people of the same sex, could open the door to representative civil unions in the future.""

Option B directly reflects this potential outcome. The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **A: fhes fewrey l HJR-3 (Immediate review of HJR-3):** While HJR-3 will be reviewed, the text doesn't say it's a *direct* consequence of the second decision failing.
*   **C: jelsh teshery''eyh tar'eh (Delay of legislative action):**  The text indicates a review will occur in 2015 or 2016, not necessarily a delay.
*   **D: men' alal ette7adat alemdenyh alemthelyh (Banning representative civil unions):** The text suggests the opposite – that failure to ban one type of union could *lead* to the recognition of another.

This translates to: ""After this procedure, HJR-3 will be reviewed a third time by the next elected legislative body in **2015 or 2016 to remain in effect.**""

While the initial changes happened in 2011 and there was a review on a Tuesday, the specific target date for the second goal (review and potential continuation) is 2015 or 2016.

Therefore, the British newspaper The Guardian claimed that Deutsche Bank was managing many of the shell companies used for tax evasion.

The text explicitly states: ""Eyran al-shahr al-ma'9y aswa2 karitha jawiya laha munth sanawat ta7a6amat 6a2iratu rukkab kanat mutawajjiha ela Armynya mima asfar 3an ma8tal 168 kanu 3ala matniha."" This translates to ""Iran this month experienced the worst air disaster in years when a passenger plane en route to Armenia crashed, resulting in the death of 168 people on board.""

The other options refer to smaller incidents:

*   **B: thetm merwheyh alesherth (the police helicopter incident)**:  Mentioned as a separate incident involving 4 deaths, but significantly fewer than the plane crash.
*   **C: thetm aleta'erh fi teryeqha ela eyeran men aremyenya (the plane crash on the way to Iran from Armenia)**: This is not mentioned in the text.
*   **D: thetm aleta'erh fi meshhed (the plane crash in Mashhad)**: This refers to a different incident involving 17 deaths, again less than the Armenia plane crash.



"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the following causes for the frequent accidents in Iran:

* **""Al-7awadith al-jawiya sha2i3a fi Iran, allaty tamlik u9tulan 8adiman la tatimu 9ianatuh bi shakl jayid min ajl al-amaliati al-madania wa al-3askaria.""** (Air accidents are common in Iran, which have old planes that are not properly maintained for civil and military operations.)
* **""Wa ta3ni al-3uqubat al-dawliyya al-jadid annahu la yumkinu shira2 tayyarat.""** (And the new international sanctions mean that it is not possible to purchase planes.)
* **""Wa fi ashahr nafsihi ijta7at ta2irat rukkab ukhra madrajan fi Mashad wa stdamat fi jidar musfiratan 3an maqtali 17 shakhsan.""** (In the same month, another passenger plane crashed at an airport in Mashhad and crashed into a cliff, resulting in the death of 17 people.)
* **""Wa fi ashahr nafsihi ijta7at ta2irat rukkab ukhra madrajan fi Mashad wa stdamat fi jidar musfiratan 3an maqtali 17 shakhsan.""** (In the same month, another passenger plane crashed at an airport in Mashhad and crashed into a cliff, resulting in the death of 17 people.)

The reasons given are old planes, poor maintenance, and sanctions preventing the purchase of new planes.  The text *doesn't* mention a lack of systems that allow the purchase of new planes; in fact, it says the opposite - sanctions *prevent* it.

Therefore, option B is the incorrect choice. Options A, C, and D all align with the information presented in the text as contributing factors to the accidents. However, the question asks which is *not* a cause.
"

Here's why:

* The report *explicitly* states that no one can predict if any course of action in Iraq will prevent the escalation of civilian unrest, increased violence, or a slide into chaos. This directly contradicts option B, which suggests violence can be avoided.
* Options A and C are both explicitly mentioned in the report.
* Option D, ""neda' men ajel ejema' ameryeky"" (a call for a US consensus), is *not* mentioned in the provided text.  The report focuses on the US needing to develop a new diplomatic initiative.



Therefore, B is the only option that is *not* supported by the text of the report.



"
lem yheth feryeq derash al'eraq fi teqreyrh 3la ay mema yely?,"The correct answer is **D: enesha' mebaderh deblewmaseyh jedyedh (Establish a new diplomatic initiative)**.

Here's why:

The report explicitly states: ""min tawsiyatiha al-baligh 3adaduhu 78 tawsiya, yanbaghi intikhadh mubadara diblumasiyya jadida qabla nihayat al-3am li ta2min 7udud al-3iraq doda al-tadakhulat al-3ida2iyya wa i3adat al-3alaqat al-diblomassiya ma3 al-buldan al-mujawira."" (Among its 78 recommendations, a new diplomatic initiative should be taken before the end of the year to secure Iraq's borders against foreign interference and restore diplomatic relations with neighboring countries.)

While the report *does* advocate for establishing a new diplomatic initiative (option D), it *also* mentions other points:

* **B: tegheyyer fewrey fi alatejah (Immediate shift in direction):** The report criticizes the current executive branch's handling of Iraq and notes an immediate shift in its approach, supporting this statement.
* **C: asetkhedam alemnaqeshh alemfetwhh (Use of open discussion):** The report advocates for using open discussion but doesn't state it was *done* in the report itself, rather it advocates for its use.
* **A: e3lan deman lewqef al3anef alemtezayed (Declaration of an end to escalating violence):**  The report states that it *warns* about escalating violence, but doesn't mention a declaration of ending it. It acknowledges the risk of increased violence.

Therefore, option D is the most directly and explicitly stated recommendation within the report.
"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""wa qalat al-shorta inna Lo Piccolo kana yamluk al-a8labiya,idh annahu kana al-yad al-yumna li Provenzano fi Palermo...""

This translates to: ""and the police said that Lo Piccolo held the majority, therefore he was Provenzano's right hand in Palermo...""
"
"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat alewaredh fi alfqrh, ma hew sebb wefah Falcone?","The correct answer is **A: qutel khelal alherb alety qadatha Riina** (killed during the war waged by Riina).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Provenzano jabah ha'ula' ar-ru'asa' bi-wad'i haddan lil harb allati qadatha Riina..."" (Provenzano confronted these leaders by setting a limit to the war waged by Riina...). It then mentions that this war resulted in the deaths of Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino in 1992.  Therefore, the cause of Falcone's death, according to the provided text, was his killing during the war orchestrated by Riina.

The other options are not supported by the text:

*   **B: qetleth alesherth** (killed by a rival) - The text doesn't specify the killer.
*   **C: aumer Lo Piccolo beqtelh** (ordered by Lo Piccolo to kill him) - While Lo Piccolo is mentioned as having influence, the text doesn't state he ordered Falcone's death.
*   **D: qutel 3la yed zemyelh selyeby alemafeya Paolo Borsellino** (killed by the rival mafia member Paolo Borsellino) -  This is incorrect; the text indicates Falcone and Borsellino were killed *during* the war Riina initiated, not by Borsellino.



"
ay mema yely leys ahed awesmh Hitoshi Saito?,"The correct answer is **D: khebyer jewdew (Judo expert)**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Tuwufiya la3eb al-judoka al-yabani Hitoshi Saito al-fa2ez bi midaliyatayn dhahabiyatayn olombiyatayn 3an 54 3aman."" This translates to ""The Japanese judoka player Hitoshi Saito, the winner of two Olympic gold medals at 54 years old, passed away.""  This confirms he won Olympic gold medals.
* The text states: ""kana Saito ra2is lajnat al-tadrib fi itti7ad al-judo al-yabani waqta wafatihi."" This translates to ""Saito was the head of the training committee in the Japanese Judo Association at the time of his death."" This confirms he was the head of the training committee (and thus a leader within the Judo association).
* The text explicitly states he won two Olympic gold medals.

While the text doesn't *directly* say he's a ""Judo expert,"" his achievements (Olympic gold medals, head of the training committee) strongly imply expertise in Judo. However, option D is the *least* accurate description based *only* on the provided text. The other options are directly supported by the text.



"
ayen temken Iwasaki men tejneb akhed alew'ewed?,"The correct answer is **A: aleyaban (Nepal)**.

The text states: ""haraba min alzawaj fi Nepal"" which translates to ""he escaped from the wedding in Nepal"". This implies he avoided the wedding (and therefore potentially the traditions/customs associated with it) by fleeing to Nepal.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: neybal (Nepal)** - This is a repetition of the location he escaped *from*, not where he avoided customs.
*   **C: alhend (India)** - He was *arrested* in India, not able to avoid customs there.
*   **D: aletbet (Tibet)** - He was attacked in Tibet, not able to avoid customs there.

So, the only place where the text implies he avoided something related to customs is Nepal.
"
men hajem Iwasaki?,"The correct answer is **C: kelb (dog)**.

The text states: ""wa hajamahu kalb mas3ur fi al Tibet"" which translates to ""and a famous dog attacked him in Tibet.""

Here's a breakdown of why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: zewjeth alemhetmelh (his expected husband):** The text says he *escaped* from marriage in Nepal, not that he was attacked by his husband.
* **B: qerasana (his cousins):** The text says his cousins stole his motorcycle.
* **D: alesherth (his inheritance):** The text doesn't mention any attack related to inheritance.



"
meta anha Alonso sebaqh?,"The correct answer is **C: b3d an anha Schumacher sebaqh** (after Schumacher overtook him).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kana zamiluhu fi al-fariq Fernando Alonso fi al-sadara li mu3zam al-sibaq, lakinnahu anha al-sibaq mubasharatan ba3da tawaqufihi al-mufaji2,rubbama bi-sabab 3ajalatin amamiyya bi-jihat al-yamin matwiyya bi-shaklen ghayr sa7i7. Anha Michael Schumacher sibaqahu ba3da fatratin wajiza min Alonso, bi-sababi darar atta3liq fi al-ma3arik al-3adida khilal al-sibaq.""

Translation: ""His teammate Fernando Alonso was in the lead for most of the race, but he overtook the race immediately after his surprising stop, perhaps due to a front wheel on the right folded in an incorrect way. Michael Schumacher overtook him after a short period from Alonso, due to damage from collisions in many battles during the race.""

This clearly indicates that Schumacher overtook Fisichella, and *then* Alonso was overtaken by Schumacher. Therefore, Alonso was overtaken *after* Schumacher overtook him.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: b3d an atelf Schumacher 'ejelth alamameyh** (after Schumacher lost the front wheel) - The passage doesn't specify *when* Schumacher lost the front wheel, only that Fisichella stopped.
*   **B: feqd Fisichella alesyetrh 3la seyareth** (after Fisichella lost control of his car) - Fisichella lost control *first*, but the question asks when Alonso was overtaken, not when Fisichella lost control.
*   **D: qebl akhed alesdarh** (before taking the lead) - This is incorrect because Alonso *was* in the lead for most of the race.



"
ma aledy def' Schumacher ela enha' sebaqh mebkeraan?,"The correct answer is **B: tesadem ma3 Alonso** (crashed with Alonso).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Anha Michael Schumacher sibaqahu ba3da fatratin wajiza min Alonso, bi-sababi darar atta3liq fi al-ma3arik al-3adida khilal al-sibaq."" This translates to: ""Schumacher overtook him after a short period from Alonso, due to damage from contact in many battles during the race.""

The context implies that the damage from the contact (specifically, ""darar atta3liq"" - damage from contact/collision) with Alonso is what allowed Schumacher to overtake Fisichella *earlier* in the race than he would have otherwise. The initial part describes Fisichella's crash and then explains Schumacher's move.  While there might have been other factors (like a problem with Fisichella's car - option C - that caused him to crash initially), the text explicitly links Schumacher overtaking Fisichella to the damage resulting from contact with Alonso.

Therefore, option B is the best fit based on the provided text.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, mhemh men hey aleferaj bekfalh 3an alema3eteqleyn?","The correct answer is **A: aledabet aledy ajera ala'eteqal (the officer who made the arrest)**.

The text states: ""Thumma yatim idkhal arrusum fi nidham al-7asoub al-khas bil wilaya haythu yatem tatabo3 al-7ala. **Wa yudfi al-tabi3 arrasmi 3ala al-tuham al-lati yuwajihuha al-dabet al-ladhi qama bil i3tiqal.**""  This translates to: ""Then the fees are entered into the state's specific computer system where the case is tracked. **And the official nature is attached to the accusations facing the officer who made the arrest.**""

Therefore, the officer who made the arrest is responsible for formally documenting the accusations.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Fi Abril/nisan min hadha al-3am, asdara al-qadi Glynn amran mu2aqatan bil sijin al-mu2aqat dodda al-mansha2a li fard itlaq sara7 al-mu7tajazin ba3da akthar min 24 sa3a min qubulihim wa la-dhin lam ya7sulu 3ala jalsat istima3 min qibali mufawwad al-mahkama.""  This translates to: ""In April of this year, Judge Glynn issued an official order for the release of detainees after more than 24 hours of their acceptance and those who have not had a hearing from the judge's mediator.""

The question asks what is required for detainees to be released after more than 24 hours, according to the rules. The passage clearly states it's an official order issued by Judge Glynn.  The other options are related, but not the direct requirement mentioned in the passage.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma alsbb aldy lm yustkhdm ltfsyr el'3a2 jawlat al-e3ada?","The correct answer is **D: alaltbas aldustury (constitutional ambiguity)**.

The text states: ""sarra7a diblomasiyun annahum wajadu ma yakfi min al-ghumud fi al-dustur al-Afghani li iqrar anna jawlat al i3ada ghayr daruriya."" This translates to: ""Diplomats stated that they found enough ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to decide that the repeat round is not necessary.""

Option D, ""alaltbas aldustury,"" directly translates to ""constitutional ambiguity.""  The text explicitly mentions this ambiguity as the reason for the decision.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: almakha6ir al-amniya (security concerns):** While security concerns are mentioned as a *reason* for the initial decision to hold a repeat round, the text says that diplomats found *ambiguity* in the constitution to *reject* the need for another round.
* **B: atana8'9 ma3 al-dustur (contradiction with the constitution):** The text says that previous decisions indicated a possible *contradiction* with the constitution, but it's the *ambiguity* that was used to justify not needing a repeat round.
* **C: alnfqat almrtf3eh (high expenses):** High expenses aren't mentioned in the text as a reason for the decision.

The passage states: ""Wa sarra7a diblomasiyun annahum wajadu ma yakfi min **al-ghumud fi al-dustur al-Afghani** li iqrar anna jawlat al i3ada ghayr daruriya.""

This translates to: ""And diplomats stated that they found enough **ambiguity in the Afghan constitution** to decide that the repeat round is not necessary.""

Option C directly reflects this statement. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kant mkhalfh lldustur (It was contrary to the constitution):** The text says it was the *ambiguity* in the constitution, not that it directly contradicted it.
*   **B: kant hnak makha6ir amniya (There were security risks):** Security risks are mentioned as a *reason* for the need for a repeat round, but not as the reason for deeming it unnecessary.
*   **D: kant alantkhabat muklfah jedan (The elections were too expensive):** The passage doesn't mention the cost of elections.

Therefore, the ambiguity in the constitution is the key factor diplomats cited for not needing a repeat round."

The sentence then goes on to say that these political agents are responsible for providing governmental services and judicial matters, in accordance with Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution. Therefore, the political agents are the ones providing the judicial services.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ayyana arra2is al-Bakistani """"wukala2 siyasiyyin"""" li 7ukum al-manatiq al-qabaliyya FATA..."" which translates to ""Pakistani leaders appointed 'political agents' to govern the tribal areas FATA...""  This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best fit:

* **A: hm y8dmwn al-khadamat al-qada2iyya (they provide judicial services):**  The text says they are responsible for providing both governmental services AND judicial matters, but it doesn't *specifically* state that providing judicial services is their *only* function.
* **C: hm mltzmwn baldutur al-Bakistani (they are bound by the Pakistani constitution):** While the text mentions they operate under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution, it doesn't state they are *bound* by the entire constitution.  They are applying a specific article.
* **D: ldyhm sytrh kamlh 3la mnat8 mu3ena (they have complete control over a specific area):** The text states they have ""shibih kamila"" (almost complete) control, not *complete* control.

Let's look at the options:

*   **A: afdal fylm (best film)** - The text explicitly says the film was nominated in *all* categories *except* for best film.
*   **B: afdal mu2thrat bsryh (best visual effects)** - The text doesn't mention visual effects.
*   **C: afdal ta3dilat sawtiyya (best sound editing)** - The text mentions ""afdal ta3dilat sawtiyya"" (best sound mixing) but not ""best sound editing"".
*   **D: afdal aghani asliya (best original song)** - The text specifically states the film's songs were nominated for best original song.

While other things are affected, the question asks what *remained operational* after the earthquake.  The passage says *all* reactors in the Shika plant were shut down. Therefore, the remaining operational reactors in Shika are none.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alma6ar fi Ishikawa (The Nutu beacon in Ishikawa):** The text says the beacon *remains suspended* (""ma6ar Nutu fy mu7afathat Eyshykawa mu'3la8an"").
* **C: jmy3 khdmat alskk al7adydyh (All railway services):** The text says railway service is *disrupted* in affected areas (""ta'9ararat ba3'9 a6uru8 watawa8afat khidmatu assikak al-7adidiya fy al-mana6i8 al-muta'9arira"").

The text explicitly states: ""Wa tufid al-taqarir anna akthar min 9400 manzilan yaftaqidun lil ma2 wa 100 manzil taqriban min 8ayr kahraba2. **Ta'9ararat ba3'9 a6uru8 watawa8afat khidmatu assikak al-7adydiya fy al-mana6i8 al-muta'9arira wala yazal ma6ar Nutu fy mu7afathat Eyshykawa mu'3laqan.**"" This indicates disruptions like power outages and railway closures *due to the earthquake*.  

The text *also* states: ""**Afadat annahu tamma ighlaq kul min al-mufa3alayn raqam 1 wa 2 fi ma7atat Shika lil taqa al-nawiyya.**""  This directly says that reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika nuclear power plant were shut down. This shutdown is a *direct consequence* of the earthquake and a measure taken for safety.

While other options are affected by the earthquake, the shutdown of the reactors at Shika is presented as a specific and direct *decision made because of* the earthquake.



Therefore, the most accurate answer is B.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn al8a9'aya altalyh 3'yr mdrjh fi al-wathi8a?","The correct answer is **B: sbb 7rb 3am 1967**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states the agreement is ""according to borders prior to the 1967 war.""  Therefore, the war itself is not the basis *of* the agreement; it's the point of reference for the borders. The agreement *relies* on the pre-1967 borders, not the war's causes.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: mst8bal al-Qudus:** The text says the agreement also covers the future of Jerusalem.
*   **C: alwjwd al3askry fi al-wady:** The text details an agreement regarding Israeli military presence in the Jordan Valley.
*   **D: alniza3 3la al7dwd:** The text says the agreement addresses the border dispute.



"
ay mma yly lys mn m6aleb Falas6yn?,"The question asks: ""Which of the following is NOT a concern of the Palestinians?""

The text states the following are topics of discussion:

*   **Borders based on conditions prior to the 1967 war:** This is a core Palestinian concern, as they want borders based on the pre-1967 lines.
*   **Continued military presence in the Jordan Valley:** This is a Palestinian concern, as they oppose a long-term Israeli military presence in the area.
*   **The issue of the future of Jerusalem:** This is a central Palestinian concern, as they claim Jerusalem as their future capital.
*   **A military presence for 5 years in the Jordan Valley:** The text notes that the Palestinian side is willing to allow a military presence for only 5 years.

Option D says ""wjwd 3askry lmdh 5ms snwat fi wady al-Ardayn"" (a military presence for 5 years in the Jordan Valley). This is *not* a concern of Palestinians, but rather a *compromise* they are willing to make (albeit reluctantly).

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: wjwd 3askry lmdh 5ms snwat fi wady al-Ardayn**.
"
fi ay bld drs Ma al8anwn?,"The correct answer is **C: Australia**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""darasa fi jami3at New York wa fi kuliyyat al-7uquq fi jami3at Harvard"" which translates to ""studied at New York University and at the Faculty of Law at Harvard University"". Harvard University is in the United States, and New York University is also in the United States.

The question asks where Ma studied law. The text doesn't explicitly say *where* Harvard Law School is located. However, the text also mentions that Ma lives in Hong Kong.

The options provided don't include the United States. Since the question asks about where Ma studied *law* and not where he lives or where he got his green card, we need to find the university where he studied law. The text mentions Harvard Law School, which is in the United States, but that's not an option.

There seems to be a discrepancy or error in the provided options, as none of them directly reflect the location of Harvard Law School (USA). However, if we must choose the best fit from the given choices, we have to consider the context.

Let's re-evaluate:

*   Ma studied at Harvard Law School.
*   Harvard Law School is in the USA.
*   The options do not include USA.

This suggests there is an error in the question or the options.

However, there might be a mistake in my initial interpretation. The phrase ""dhou al-mazhar al-7asan, kana shaklan akhtar min kawnihi jawharan"" (with his handsome appearance, he was a more dangerous form than a jewel) refers to Ma's appearance, not his studies.

The most accurate answer we can derive from the provided choices is **A: alwlayat almthdh alamrykyh** (The United States of America). This is because Harvard University is located in the United States, and the question asks where Ma studied law, implying a university education.

I apologize for the initial incorrect response. After carefully considering the options and the text, **A: alwlayat almthdh alamrykyh** is the best possible answer from the given choices.

**However, it's important to note that the question and options are flawed.**
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, f2n munasrh ay dawlh sa3edt fi fwz Ma fi alantkhabat?","The correct answer is **A: alwlayat almthdh alamrykyh (The United States)**.

Here's why:

* The text states that Ma studied at New York University and Harvard Law School, both in the United States.
* He obtained a ""Green Card"" (bitaqat al-ikama adda2ima), which is a permanent residency card in the United States.
* The passage mentions a ""munasaha"" (proposal/initiative) to strengthen relations *with China*. This implies that the election victory is linked to a policy of closer ties with China. While Hong Kong and China are mentioned, the context of Ma's education and Green Card strongly suggests the United States played a role.

Therefore, the US is the most logical answer based on the information provided.  The other options are less directly supported by the text.

This translates to: ""and most of the affected families discovered that Carolyn Wilson from the Housing Authority in Oakland (OHA) had stolen their private insurance policies and fled the city.""

While the other options are mentioned in relation to the situation, Carolyn Wilson worked *for* the Oakland Housing Authority.
"
"m3 b8a2 arb3 sba8at fi almaosem, mn fi almarkz alrabe3 fi al-butula?","The answer is **D: Bowyer**.

Here's the breakdown:

The question states: ""Fil markaz al-thalith, yatakhallaf Hamlin bi 20 noqta, lakinahu yataqadam bi 5 niqat 3an Bowyer.""  This translates to: ""In third place, Hamlin lags by 20 points, but he is ahead by 5 points of Bowyer.""

Therefore, Bowyer is in 4th place.
"
"b3d alsba8 almazkur fi alfa8arh, km 3dd aln8a6 alty ymtlkha Kahne fi btwlh al-butula?","The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The text states: ""Yakhruj Kahne wa Truex al-markaz al-khamis wal sadids 3ala attawali bi-rasid 2220 wa 2207 noqta.""  This directly tells us that Kahne has 2220 points.

This translates to: ""And from a total of 24,000 meteorites approximately known to have fallen on the ground, about 34 have been confirmed to be from Mars.""

Therefore, the answer is 34.
"
"kma zkr fi alfa8arh, ma alshyh 7wl alskhwr alty wujd anha mrykhyh alasl?","The correct answer is **A: عُثر عليهم جميعاً خلال تساقط نيزك في يوليو**.

Here's why:

The question asks ""kma zkr fi alfa8arh, ma alshyh 7wl alskhwr alty wujd anha mrykhyh alasl?"" which translates to ""As mentioned in the article, what is the reason surrounding the fact that the rocks found were originally Martian?"".

The text states: ""Khamsata ʿashr min hathihi assukhur tuʿza ila tasaqut annayzak fi Yulyu al-madi."" This translates to ""Fifteen of these rocks are attributed to a meteor shower in last July.""

The options provided don't directly ask about the *reason* surrounding the discovery, but rather *what the reason is*. The text directly links the Martian rocks to the July meteor shower.

Therefore, the answer is A, as it directly states that all the rocks were discovered during a meteor shower in July. Options B, C, and D are incorrect because they provide specific numbers or comparisons that are not the direct answer to the question.
"

The text states: ""Schumacher al-ladhi i3tazala 3am 2006 ba3da fawzhihi bi-butulat al-Formula 1 li 7 marrat..."" which translates to ""Schumacher who retired in 2006 after winning the Formula 1 championship 7 times...""

The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: b3d 7adeth Felipe Massa** (after Felipe Massa's accident) - The text mentions Massa's accident *after* Schumacher's retirement, not as the cause of it.
*   **C: b3d an 7l m7l Felipe Massa** (after Felipe Massa filled his place) -  The text says Massa *replaced* Schumacher, not the other way around.
*   **D: fi nihayh mawsem 2009** (at the end of the 2009 season) - Schumacher retired in 2006.



"
mta a6eyb Massa?,"The correct answer is **D: 8bl mawsem 2009** (Before the 2009 season).

The text states: ""Wa mina al-muqarar an yaghib Massa 3an baqiyat mawsam 2009 3ala al-aqal."" which translates to ""And it was decided that Massa would be absent for the rest of the 2009 season at least.""
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, kyf sy2ethr altrtyb 3la shrkh AOL?","The correct answer is **C: synafs 3dd mstakhdimw Yahoo w Microsoft 3dd mstakhdimy AOL**

Here's why:

The text states that the large use of AOL in America facilitated its promotion of instant messaging. However, it also clearly states that the user base of Yahoo and Microsoft combined *already* surpasses AOL's user base. 

Option C directly reflects this statement: ""The number of Yahoo and Microsoft users competes with the number of AOL users.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mn almrj7 an yzdad 3dd mst5dmy AOL (It is expected that the number of AOL users will increase):** The text doesn't suggest an expectation of increasing AOL users. It's talking about the current situation and the competitive pressure.
* **B: stkwn AOL alshrkh alwhydh alty twrt swq alrsa2el alfwryh (AOL will be the only company that offers the instant messaging market):** This is not supported by the text, which mentions competitors like Yahoo and Microsoft.
* **D: ln ytm ast5dam AOL b3d alan fi alwlayat almthdh (AOL will not be used in the future in these states):** The text indicates that AOL *did* use instant messaging and was popular.  It doesn't predict its complete disappearance.



"
ay mma yly 8d yntahy b3d altrtyb aljdyd?,"The correct answer is **C: حرية AOL في تطوير السوق بويترتها الحاشية (AOL's freedom to develop the market with its own characteristics).**

Here's why:

* **The passage states that AOL's dominance in instant messaging was due to its widespread use.**  The passage also says that even with a shift in the market, this freedom needs to be maintained. This implies that AOL's unique approach and freedom of development are threatened by competition.
* **A, B, and D are less directly tied to the central conflict.** While internet development, instant messaging use, and the existence of Yahoo and Microsoft are all related to the online landscape, they are not *directly* threatened by the new competitive environment described in the passage.  The passage is specifically concerned with AOL's ability to continue innovating and maintaining its unique position.

Therefore, AOL's freedom to develop the market according to its own characteristics is the most likely to be impacted or potentially curtailed in the new market dynamic.  The other options are more general or describe the existing state of affairs.



"

The text states: ""ma asfara 3an maqtal dabiti shurta wa isabat akhtar min 3ishrin akharin."" which translates to ""which resulted in the death of a police officer and the injury of more than twenty others.""

It also says: ""Wa qala maktab al-mu7afiz inna 19 min afrad ashurta kanu min bayn al-musabin."" which translates to ""And the governor's office said that 19 members of the police were among the injured.""

Therefore, only one police officer was killed. The question asks how many people killed were *not* police officers. Since only one police officer was killed, and that's the only person mentioned as being killed, the answer is 0.
"

The text explicitly states: ""ashurta innaha tashtabih bi-dulu3 tanzim al-dawla Da3esh fi al-hujum"" which translates to ""the police said that it resembles the signs of the Daesh organization in the attack.""

Therefore, the police are the ones reporting on the suspected similarity to ISIS.

The text mentions the others (Gingrich, Perry, and Romney) continuing their campaigns, although Gingrich faced a tough time and Perry planned to remain in the race.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn athna 3ela mrsh7 a5ar b2d ntyjh almu2tmr al7zby?","The correct answer is **A: Bachmann**.

The text states: ""arrarat Bashman, allaty fazat bi istitla3 Amis Stru fi Aughustus, inha2 7amlatiha.""  This translates to ""Bachman, who won the nomination of Ames Straw in August, decided to end her campaign.""  Since she ended her campaign *after* the party convention, she is the candidate who withdrew based on the results of the convention.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""ta7awul jadid gharib al-atwar qad tawajaza al-7udud"" which translates to ""a new, strange, out-of-the-ordinary development that has gone beyond the limits."" This directly indicates an unusual and unexpected situation, meaning an out-of-the-ordinary development.

The other options don't fit the description:

*   **A: mbtde2 (Beginner):**  The text doesn't suggest the station is in a beginner phase.
*   **C: 3la altry8a al8dimh (In the old way):** The text talks about a *new* development.
*   **D: ma7ly (Local):** While the program features local personalities, the core issue is the *nature* of the development itself, not its geographical scope.

While David Headley was involved with the militants (option C) and the attack involved weapons (option D), the text specifically highlights that he *provided the information* that was crucial for the successful execution of the attack. Option B (hand grenades) are mentioned as part of the weapons, but not what Headley facilitated. Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the provided text is information.

This indicates the attackers used a train to reach at least one of their targets.

While other modes of transport *could* have been used, the text specifically mentions the train station. Therefore, ""al8itar"" (the train) is the most accurate answer based *solely* on the provided text.

The text states: ""Qad khasira mu2akaran amama Raonic fi iftita7iyat Brisbane"" which translates to ""He lost heavily to Raonic in the Brisbane opener."" This means Raonic won.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: hsd Raonic n8a6 3la alshbkh bnsbh 88%** (Raonic won points with a percentage of 88%) - This refers to Nadal's percentage of points won, not Raonic's.
* **C: faz Nadal 3la Raonic** (Nadal won against Raonic) - This is the opposite of what the text says.
* **D: sjl Raonic 76 n86a** (Raonic's score was 76 points) - This refers to Nadal's points won in the first set, not Raonic's.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma kant ntyjh mbarah Nadal wa Raonic b3d al2rsal alawl?","The correct answer is **B: faz Nadal bi 76 n8a6** (Nadal won with 76 points).

Therefore, option B is the only one that accurately reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** This describes Raonic's winning percentage, not Nadal's points in the first set.
*   **C:** This describes the overall match score, not the first set score.
*   **D:** The text clearly states Nadal won, not Raonic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fi alsbaq althany, anht Carpenado qbl mtzljh mn al-Majar:** While Carpenado finished ahead of Gyöngyi Dani (from Hungary) in the Giant Slalom, the text doesn't say she finished *before* any competitor from Hungary in *either* race.
* **C: anha 3dd akbr mn almtzljat sbaq altzlj Giant Slalom m8arnh m3 sbaq altzlj Slalom:** The text states she competed *less* than the number of athletes in the Giant Slalom compared to the Slalom race (117 in Giant Slalom vs. unspecified in Slalom).
* **D: anht Carpenado fi almrtbh al3eashrh fi sbaq altzlj Slalom:** The text says she finished in 10th place in the Slalom race, which is consistent with the English translation, but this isn't the best or most direct reflection of a key result.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kant nta2ej akhtbar a3eda2 mn athad alwlayat almthdh alwtny lkrh alslh (NBA) eyjabyh** - This is too broad. The text specifically mentions a player *in the Utah Jazz*.

* **C: la3eb fi Utah Jazz kan ada2eh d3eyfaan b3ed ntyjh akhtbar eyjaby** - This refers to the player's *condition* after the positive test, not the reason for the postponement. The postponement is due to the *positive test itself*.

The question states that ""Inna qarar al-sayed Rudd bi-tawqi3 ala itifaq Kyoto lil munakh ya3zilu al-wilayat al-muta7ida..."" which translates to ""Mr. Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto climate agreement isolates the United States...""

The text states: ""رفضت الحكومة الأسترالية المحافظة السابقة التصديق على بروتوكول كيوتو، قائلة إننه سيدر بـ الاقتصاد من خلال اعتماده الكبير على صادرات الفحم.""

This translates to: ""The previous conservative Australian government rejected ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, saying that it would harm the economy due to its heavy reliance on coal exports.""

Therefore, the government believed that ratification of Kyoto would negatively impact **coal exports**.

The text explicitly states: ""في إطار برنامج assayed attabe3 li jam3iyat arrumat arriyadiyin (NSW)."" which translates to ""Within the framework of a program followed by the Australian Native Wildlife Association (NSW).""  Option A accurately reflects this.

While options B and C mention organizations involved, they aren't the specific program the shooters were recruited for. Option D is incorrect because the text doesn't say Mick O'flynn is the leader of a program *by* the Australian Native Wildlife Association. He works *with* NPWS.
"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Fi al-sharaka al-ma3quda bayna al-mutanazahat al-wataniyya wa 5edmat al-7ayat al-barriya (NPWS) wa rabitat arrumat arriyadiya fi Autralia (NSW), jara tawdhif muta6awi3in mu2ahhalin, fi i6ar barnamaj assayed attabe3 li jam3iyat arrumat arriyadiyin (NSW).

This translates to: ""In the partnership between the national parks and wildlife services (NPWS) and the Australian Native Wildlife Association (NSW), qualified assistants were employed in a program designed to follow the Australian Native Wildlife Association (NSW). According to Mick O'Flynn, who is in charge of conservation at the park and heritage with NPWS, the four rangers who were selected for the first shooting operation received comprehensive training on safety and practice.""

The question asks which sentence *doesn't* accurately reflect the pest control trial. While the trial involved training and selection, the text *explicitly states it wasn't evaluated* because it was the first trial. Therefore, option A is the only sentence that accurately reflects a limitation of the trial as described in the text.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: تلقى المتلقون إرشادات تدريبية (The recipients received training guidelines.)** - This is true, as stated in the text.
* **C: أشرف الحراس على المتلقين (The rangers supervised the recipients.)** - This is also true, as stated in the text.
* **D: تم اختيار أربعة حراس لعملية إطلاق النار الأولى (Four rangers were selected for the first shooting operation.)** - This is true, as stated in the text."
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ayn 3uthr 3la alanshqaq?","The correct answer is **A: fi ryft faly (in the Rift Valley)**.

The text states: ""Bina2an 3ala hadhihi al-7afriya, hadha ya3ni anna al-inqisam ablar bi kathir mimma kana mutwaq3an bi wasitat al-adila al-juzay2iya."" (Based on this fossil, this means the separation occurred more than expected through molecular evidence.)

Then, Berhane Asfane says: “Hadha ya3ni annahu yajib isti3adat kulla shay2.” (This means everything needs to be re-evaluated.)

The question asks where the separation occurred. The text explicitly states that the separation occurred in the Rift Valley (""ryft faly""). While the fossil and molecular evidence were used to determine this, the location is the Rift Valley.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: 3la hfryh (on the fossil)** - The fossil was *used* to determine the location, it wasn't the location itself.
*   **C: 3la dlyl jzy2ey (on molecular evidence)** - Molecular evidence was used as a tool to *determine* the location.
*   **D: fi Ethiopia (in Ethiopia)** - While the researcher is in Ethiopia, the Rift Valley is the specific geographic region.

The text states: ""بينما **بنا2ان 3ala hadhihi al-7afriya**... (While **building on these fossils**...)"". This indicates that the discovery of the fossils was the initial event that led to the findings mentioned. The text also says that the division (انقسام - inqisam) happened in a way that was more extensive than expected *through* the use of molecular evidence.  Therefore, the discovery of the fossils is the primary event that was unexpected in its scale.

"
ma aldy summ lybdw wkanh jihaz alt7km 3n bu3d lltlfaz?,"The correct answer is **B: jihaz t7km Nintendo Revolution**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the main controller looks like, and the text explicitly states: ""Wa yashabhu jihaz al-ta7akkum dhalika al-khas bil tilfaz..."" which translates to ""And the controller resembles that special for the television...""  Then, it identifies this controller as the ""jihaz Nintendo Revolution"" (Nintendo Revolution device).

While option A mentions ""mstash3ery jihaz alt7km"" (controller sensors), it doesn't describe the overall look of the controller itself. Options C and D are incorrect as they refer to the speaker (almut7dth alr2eysy) and the device itself (jihaz Nintendo Revolution), respectively, but aren't the *description* of what it *looks like*.

* Option A directly reflects this information.
* Options B, C, and D are also mentioned in the text but are secondary details *related to the threat*, not the core information that the Xinhua news agency reported.  The core information is the threat itself.



"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""tushiru attaqarir al-awwaliya ila ta7awul masar atta2erh ila Afghanistan ba3da an muni3at min al-hubut adtirari fi Urumqi."" (Initial reports indicate a change in the plane's course to Afghanistan after being prevented from an emergency landing in Urumqi.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tm akhttaf alta2erh** (The plane was hijacked) - While the plane *was* taken off course, the text doesn't explicitly confirm a hijacking.  It focuses on the route change.
* **B: mun3et alta2erh mn alhbwt aladtrary** (The plane was prevented from an emergency landing) - This is *part* of the story, but it doesn't capture the main point of the initial report mentioned in the question.
* **D: tlqt al6a2erh thdydaan bwjwd qnblh** (The plane received a threat about the presence of a bomb) -  This is also part of the story, but not the primary focus of the initial report as presented in the question.



Therefore, option C best reflects what the Xinhua news agency's initial report stated.

This translates to: ""Ms. Sara Danius, during a radio program on Sveriges Radio in Sweden, announced that the committee has stopped its efforts to reach Bob Dylan after its failure to reconcile with him regarding his winning the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2016.""

Therefore, option D accurately reflects Sara Danius's announcement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alfa2ez bja2ezh Nobel ll2dab** (Winning the Nobel Prize in Literature): While the context is about the Nobel Prize, the announcement isn't *about* him winning; it's about the committee's efforts to contact him *after* he won.
*   **B: lm ttlq alljnh ay rdwd mn almt3eawnyn** (The committee didn't receive any response from his associates): The text explicitly states they *did* receive a friendly response.

The passage states that the Nobel committee was unable to reach Bob Dylan after their attempts to communicate with him regarding his Nobel Prize win.  While Sara Danius (the secretary) tried to contact his associates, the main point is that they couldn't reach *him*.

* Therefore, Gordon Johndroe is the one who commented on the statement.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: alshafh** (Arabic for ""the oral"") - This is a general term and not a specific person.
* **B: George W. Bush** - While the commitment was made during George W. Bush's presidency, the text specifies that Gordon Johndroe *described* the commitment.
* **D: mt7dth basm kuriya al-shamaliyya** (Arabic for ""spokesperson for North Korea"") - The text states the commitment came *from* North Korea, but the comment was made by a spokesperson *for the Bush administration*.

Therefore, the correct answer is **D: akthr mn 1000** (more than 1000). While the text says ""about a thousand"", the question asks how many countries received his prints, and the number is 28. The options aren't perfectly aligned, but ""more than 1000"" is the closest representation of the total number of prints produced for various countries, as it implies a number exceeding 1000. Option A is incorrect as the text states ""about a thousand"" and not ""more than 2000"". Option B is incorrect because the text clearly states that prints were made for 28 other countries. Option C ""tqrybaan 2000"" (approximately 2000) is incorrect as the text explicitly mentions about a thousand.

So, considering the options provided, **D** is the best choice, even though it's not a perfect match to the exact figure in the text.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* The text *states* that the hospital followed protocol.  It explicitly says ""Ittaba3a al-mustashfa brutukul mukafa7iti al-3adwa wayata'9aman thalik fa9l al-mary'9 3an al-akharyn."" (The hospital followed the infection control protocol and ensured this by isolating the patient from others.)
* The text *does* state the patient visited Nigeria, which had numerous Ebola cases (A).
* The text *does* state the patient is in stable condition (D).

This translates to: ""Perhaps microbes were a source of transporting water to Earth alongside the organic matter that could form proteins and support life. Scientists are eager to understand how planets and stars form, and especially how life on Earth formed since the emergence of microbes on Earth a long time ago.""

The last part of the sentence emphasizes the scientists' desire to understand the *timing* of the microbes' arrival on Earth (""munth 2i96idam al-muthannbat bil2ar'9"").  While they also want to understand how life formed, the specific focus mentioned in the text is the *when* of the microbes.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: kyf ttshkl albrwtynat** (how proteins are formed):  While mentioned, it's not the primary focus of what scientists want to discover.
* **C: ma hy almadh al3edwyh** (what is organic matter):  Again, mentioned, but not the central question.

The text states: ""Wa kanat sur3at arriya7 fi waqtin sabiq min al-yawm 83 kilometer bi-sa3a, wa min al-mutwaqqa' an tastamira bil inkhifad.""  This translates to: ""And the wind speed at a previous time of the day was 83 kilometers per hour, and it is expected to continue decreasing.""  The first sentence describes the wind speed *before* the storm reached the Maldives. The question asks when it was expected to continue decreasing. Since the text links the decreasing wind speed to the storm's progression, and the current speed (83 km/h) is mentioned in relation to a ""previous time,"" it implies the decrease was expected *before* it reached the Maldives.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 3ndma ankhfdt sr3eh alryah ela hwaly 83 kilometer fi alsa3a** (When the wind speed decreased to about 83 kilometers per hour): This describes a point in time, but the text *states* the wind speed was already 83 km/h at a ""previous time,"" and it's expected to *continue* decreasing.

Wa kanat sur3at arriya7 fi waqtin sabiq min al-yawm 83 kilometer bi-sa3a, **wa min al-mutwaqqa' an tastamira bil inkhifad.**"" and ""Balagha al-i3sar al-istiwa2i Gonu fi dhurwatihi riya7an mutawasila wasalat sur3atuha ila 240 kilometran fi sa3a (149 milan fi sa3a).""

The key sentence is: ""Balagha al-i3sar al-istiwa2i Gonu fi dhurwatihi riya7an mutawasila wasalat sur3atuha ila **240 kilometran fi sa3a (149 milan fi sa3a)**.""

The question asks about the wind speed of the Gonu cyclone. The text explicitly says the wind speed reached 240 kilometers per hour (149 miles per hour).  Since option A only lists 149 kilometers per hour, and the question asks for *the* wind speed, this is the correct answer. Option B and C list the speed in miles per hour which isn't what the question asks. Option D mentions an earlier wind speed of 83 kilometers per hour which is not the current/maximum wind speed.

ay mma yly la y3etbr mn khasyat Karenia brevis?,"The correct answer is **C: hw mt3edd alkhlaya (it is multicellular)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""wa huwa ka2in ba7riy wa7id al-khaliyya ya7duthu bi-shakl tabi3iy."" which translates to ""and it is a marine organism, a unicellular organism, that occurs naturally."" This means Karenia brevis is *not* multicellular.

Let's look at why the other options *are* concerns related to Karenia brevis:

* **A: hw nw3e mn al67aleb (it is a type of algae):** The text states it's an algae (""ta7alib"").
* **B: ymkn an yshl a3esab albshr (it can paralyze human nerves):** The text says the algae produces a potent toxin that can paralyze both humans and fish.
* **D: hw tby3ey almnsha (it is a naturally occurring phenomenon):** The text says it occurs naturally, and natural factors can contribute to its rapid proliferation.



"
ay mma yly la ystty3 Karenia brevis alqyam bh?,"The correct answer is **C: y2ethr 3la almyah** (grow on the water).

Here's why:

* **The text states that *Karenia brevis* is a single-celled marine organism that grows naturally.** This implies it lives *in* the water, not *on* the water's surface.
* **The text explicitly mentions that high concentrations of *Karenia brevis* cause harmful algal blooms (HABs).** This indicates its ability to multiply and cause problems.
* **The text details the toxic effects of the algal bloom, including harming fish and potentially humans.**
* **The text mentions that natural factors can allow for rapid growth.**
* **The text states that the algae produces a potent toxin.**

Therefore, the only option that's *not* mentioned as something *Karenia brevis* can do is grow on the surface of the water.



**Translation of the options for clarity:**

* **A: shl ala3esab fi alasmak** (cause neurological problems in fish) - This is mentioned in the text.
* **B: alzyadh alsry3eh fi al3edd t7t ay zrf** (rapid growth under any circumstances) - This is mentioned in the text.
* **C: y2ethr 3la almyah** (grow on the water) - This is *not* mentioned in the text.
* **D: entaj sm 3asby** (produce a potent toxin) - This is mentioned in the text.

The text explicitly states: ""La8ad wu9if mu3addal hu6wl alam6ar -allthy wa9al ela 6.34 buw9t 3ala mi8yas awahw- 3ala annahu """"mufyd""""."" This translates to ""The rate of rainfall - which reached 6.34 on the Saffir-Simpson scale - has stopped and is considered """"beneficial"""".""  It also mentions ""al-amtar mas7uba bi-3awasif ra3diyya wa bareq mutakarir"" which means ""the rains were accompanied by normal storms and frequent lightning.""

The text *doesn't* mention street flooding (fydanat alshwareع).  It mentions rainfall, storms, lightning, and a stop in the rainfall rate, which is considered beneficial. Therefore, street flooding is the only thing that wasn't reported as a result of the typhoon according to the text.

Here's why:

* **The original text states:** ""Tasabbabatt ba8ayaha fy hu6wl am6ar fy mu3'6am al-jazira..."" (The rest caused heavy rainfall in the island's core...) This directly indicates that the island's core experienced the heavy rainfall.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: astfadt Oahu mn htwl alamtar alnatj** (Oahu benefited from the resulting heavy rainfall) - The text doesn't say Oahu benefited. It mentions heavy rainfall *in the core of the island*.
* **B: tm tsnyfha awlaan 3la anha mnkhfd astwa2ey qbl an tthwl ela 3easfh mn alf2eh alrab3eh** (It was initially classified as a low-intensity storm before intensifying to a Category 4 hurricane) - The text says it was a Category 4 hurricane *before* weakening. It doesn't mention a lower initial classification.
* **D: htwl b3d alamtar mshwbh bbrq** (The heavy rainfall was accompanied by lightning) - The text states the rain was accompanied by lightning, but it doesn't say the *heavy rainfall* was accompanied by lightning. It just mentions lightning as a general occurrence.

Here's why:

The text states: ""2uqila Piquet Jr. ba3da ja2izat al-majar al-kubra 3am 2009."" which translates to ""Piquet Jr. was dismissed after the 2009 Grand Prix.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: t3rd Fernando Alonso l7adth** (Fernando Alonso had an accident) - While Alonso *was* involved in an accident in 2008, the text focuses on Piquet Jr.'s dismissal *after* the 2009 race.
*   **B: hqq Piquet Jr. alnsr** (Piquet Jr. won) - The text explicitly says Piquet Jr. *didn't* win, and the events surrounding the 2008 race were controversial due to a deliberate crash.
*   **D: t3erdt syarh al2aman l7adth** (The safety car had an accident) - The safety car was deployed *because* of Alonso's accident, but the text doesn't say the safety car itself had an accident.

"

The text clearly states: ""Wa 3indama twajahat al-sayarat al-lati kanat amama Alonso lil 7usul 3ala ak-wuqud ta7ta sayyarat al-aman, tamkkana Alonso mina al-fawz."" which translates to ""And when the cars ahead of Alonso approached for refueling under the safety car, Alonso was able to win."" This directly links the incident to the refueling process.

The text also says: ""...ala al-rughum min annahu kana yu3taqad annu hadhihi al-3amaliyya tastaghreq waqtan atwal bi sabab al-takathur..."". This means ""...despite it being believed that this process took much longer due to reproduction...""

Therefore, the research found that the formation of the new species (the evolution process) happened in just two generations, which is *less* time than what scientists previously thought. The other options are not directly addressed as taking less time.



"

Here's why:

* The text states that researchers discovered a new type of bird, but it **doesn't mention the name** of the new species.
* The researchers *did* report on:
    * **Location of origin:** Galapagos Islands
    * **Timeframe of evolution:** Two generations
    * **Evolutionary processes:** Evolution from Darwin's finches, ground finches, small migratory warblers, and large migratory warblers.

Therefore, the only information *not* mentioned is the name of the new species.

* The provided text explicitly states: ""CowParade, akbar 7adath 3am fil 3alam bayna sharay Yunyu wa Oghustus."" This translates to ""CowParade, the biggest event in the world annually between June and August.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ""y7dth fqt fi almdn alty t3etbr """"ebda3eyh"""" "" (It only happens in cities considered ""creative"")**: The text says Bucharest is being renovated *as* a creative city to host CowParade, but it doesn't limit CowParade to only cities with that designation.
* **B: aqamh Bucharest City Hall (Hosted by Bucharest City Hall)**: While the Bucharest City Hall is organizing the event, the text focuses on CowParade itself, not just who hosts it.
* **C: hw 7dth fny fnyqam fi alsyf fi jmy3 an7a2 jnwb shrq Orobba (It is an event that takes place in the summer in all parts of Southeast Europe)**: The text says Bucharest will be the *first* in Southeast Europe to host CowParade, not that it happens throughout the entire region in the summer.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Infasala mu7arikun 3inda al-iqla3 wa lakin min ghar ay adrar..."" which translates to ""A motor separated during takeoff, but without any damage..."" This is an accident.

The text then says: ""...mimma ajbara Rusya 3ala ta3liq 3amal ta2irat ll-76 mu2aqatan."" which translates to ""...which forced Russia to immediately suspend the operation of Il-76 aircraft.""

Therefore, the reason Russia suspended the use of Il-76 aircraft is due to an accident.
"

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kanat ta2irat ll-76 3unsuran muhimman li kul min al-jaysh arrusi wal sovyeti mundhu fatrat al-sab3inat..."" This translates to: ""The Il-76 aircraft were an important element for both the Russian and Soviet armies since the 1970s...""

The question asks what an Il-76 is. The text refers to it as ""ta2erh"".

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: ta2erh**.

**Note:** ""Ta2erh"" likely refers to the Il-76 aircraft. This is a bit of a trick question because the provided options don't directly list the aircraft type. The text itself uses ""ta2erh"" to refer to it. The answer choices are provided in Arabic.

This translates to: ""Fluke wrote that the efforts made by some to prevent women from speaking about women's health have not succeeded. This result has been achieved thanks to the many positive relationships and encouragement received from men and women alike, who have been urging her to consider birth control pills as a medical necessity.""

The key phrase is ""...bi-fadil al-a3liqat al-ijabiya wal tashji3 al-lati 7asalat 3alayh min qibal **arrijal wa nisa2**..."" which means ""...thanks to the positive relationships and encouragement received from **men and women**...""

The question asks who *didn't* want women to speak about their health.  The text indicates that this effort was made by ""some"" men (arrijal). Therefore, the males are the ones who didn't want women to speak about their health.



Therefore, the answer is **A**.

It is completely transparent like water. Therefore, if you stand by the shore, you will be able to see any objects or materials that are submerged in the bottom.""

The second part of the text says: ""Bi-qadri ma na3lamahu, hunaka jisim kawkabi wa7id faqat ya3ridu dinimakiyya akthar min Titan, wa ismuhu Kawkab al-Ared"""" which translates to: ""As far as we know, there is only one planetary body that shows more dynamics than Titan, and its name is Earth.""

The text explicitly mentions that the transparent substance behaving like water is on a body named **Titan**. While the text also mentions Earth, the context is about the transparent, water-like substance behaving similarly on Titan.

Therefore, the answer is **B: Titan**.

(Scientists say the color of the feathers of this animal is brownish-chestnut on top with a pale or carotene-colored underside.)  This is a *confirmation* of the presence of feathers.

The other options are *results* or *inferences* derived *from* the discovery of feathers, not the discovery itself:

* **B: fhm an alrysh lm ystkhdm fi altyran** (Understanding that feathers were not used for flying) is an *inference* based on the feather's structure.
* **C: nzrh 3la ttwr alrysh** (Looking at the evolution of feathers) is a *result* of studying the feathers.

This translates to: ""The structure of the feathers indicates that it was not used during flight but to regulate body temperature or display. And the researchers suggested that despite this being the tail of a small dinosaur, the evidence shows full feathers and not small feather plumes.""

Therefore, the dinosaurs did *not* have small feather plumes, but **full feathers (rysh balgh)**.

(...but the official study indicated that it was less effective than what is needed to reduce mortality rates.) This means it wasn't a complete preventative measure against death, but it *did* have some impact on reducing mortality.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: hw msnw3 mn ajsam mdadh** (It is a cocktail of antibodies) - This is directly stated in the text.
* **C: kan bmthabh m3eyar mraqbh fi tjrbh PALM** (It was used as a control element in the PALM trial) - The text clearly says this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: azhrt aldrasat anh qd ykwn lh fwa2ed akthr mma kan y3etqd sabqaan** (The study showed that it might have more benefits than previously thought) - While the passage mentions ZMapp showing promising results, it doesn't state the study showed it *might* have *more* benefits.

* **C: tm astkhdam ZMapp kasas lltjrbh** (ZMapp was used as the treatment in the experiment) - This is partially true, but it doesn't capture the *control* aspect of the trial. ZMapp wasn't the *only* treatment, but a baseline for comparison.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: snt amryky wahd lkl mnha** (one thousand American dollars for each): This is the cost, not the method of creation.
*   **C: shra3eh qablh lltba3eh** (a printable layer):  While it *is* printable, it's not *just* a printable layer; it's a more complex structure.

The other options are consistent with the text:

These features were found on all parts of the moon's surface, and it appears they were subjected to the least amount of atmospheric factors. **This indicates that the events that produced them were relatively recent.**)

The text then says: ""wa tata3arad hadhihi al-nadhariyya ma3a iddi3a2 anna al-qamar khalin tamaman min ay nashat jiyoloji."" (and this theory is presented alongside the claim that the moon is completely devoid of any geological activity).

If the moon is *completely* devoid of geological activity, then the fissures (and the shrinking) would have to be very recent events.  Therefore, the theory's formation is relatively recent. Option D accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: القمر يتقلص ببطئ (The moon is shrinking slowly):** The text states the shrinking is *rapid*.
*   **B: منذ وقت طويل (A long time ago):** The text implies the events are relatively *recent*.
*   **C: لا يوجد الكثير من البيانات عن سطح القمر (There isn't much data about the moon's surface):** The text discusses *many* data points (fissures found on all parts of the moon).

The text further mentions that the Public Prosecutor's Office has told journalists that no justice will be served until the charges are formally brought. This implies that the *publishing of the pictures* is the problematic aspect, and it's linked to the potential for bias.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: t3elyqat edafyh (additional comments)** - While comments might be a factor, the text focuses more on the pictures.
*   **C: mnaqshat adlh shhwd al3eyan (discussing witness testimony)** - The text mentions witness testimony but frames it in relation to the pictures, suggesting the bias stems from the pictures, not directly from the testimony.

The passage states: ""...su2al yumathil ahammiyya bali'3a 3ind al-tafkir fi a5laqiyyat al-ijhath qa2ilan innahu sayakun munafiyan lila5laq at-ta3liq 3ala tafa9il al-7alat al-mu7tamala."" This translates to: ""...a question that holds great importance when considering the ethics of abortion, saying that it would be inconsistent with established morals in relation to considering possible situations.""  The question being referred to is ""mata ya3taqid an tabda2 al-7ya"" - ""when does one believe life begins?"".  This is directly related to the ethics of abortion.

While Roberts mentions the consistency of Supreme Court rulings (B) and the right to privacy (D) and the Roe v. Wade case (A), the central question he raises about the ethics of abortion is *when life begins*.



"
ma hw almwdw3e aldy sh3er Roberts anh ghyr akhlaqy llghayh b7yth la ymkn mnaqshth?,"The best answer is **A: atsaq a7kam alm7kmh al3ulya (Consistency of Supreme Court rulings)**.

Here's why:

The passage highlights Roberts' emphasis on the importance of consistent Supreme Court rulings (""ahammiyat a7kam al-ma7kama al-3ulya al-mutasiqa""). He explicitly stated that the Roe v. Wade case was a ""settled law"" and that he believed in the ""dignified right to privacy"" based on that decision.  The passage frames the issue as whether abandoning this consistent legal precedent would be unethical (""munafiyan lila5laq at-ta3liq"").

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: qarar Roe dodda Wade (Roe v. Wade decision):** While mentioned, the passage isn't *directly* arguing about the Roe v. Wade decision itself. It's arguing about the *ethical implications of potentially overturning* a long-standing precedent established by that decision.
* **C: al7q aldmny fi alkhswsyh (Dignified right to privacy):**  This is a component of Roberts' argument, but it's tied to the *consistency* of the Supreme Court's rulings based on Roe v. Wade.
* **D: tfasyl alqadaia (Details of the case):** The passage doesn't delve into the specific details of the Roe v. Wade case; it focuses on the *legal and ethical implications of potentially changing* the ruling.



Therefore, the central theme Roberts is discussing in terms of ethical implications is the importance of upholding consistent Supreme Court jurisprudence, which is reflected in the long-standing Roe v. Wade precedent.

The text says: ""Tamma ida2at shu3a3ayn lil ishara ila assama2 athna2a al-layl."" This translates to ""Two rays were lit to indicate the sky during the night."" Therefore, the rays point towards the sky.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, mta sytm bna2 na6i7at shab jdydh fi almwq3?","The correct answer is **D: albna2 mstmr** (Construction is ongoing).

Here's why:

The text states: "" Yajri al-3amal 3ala bina2 khams nati7at sa7ab jadida fi almawqi3..."" which translates to ""Work is ongoing on building five new cloud structures at the site..."" This indicates that the construction is not yet complete and is still in progress.  Option D best reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: fi mntsf alnhar** (at midday): The text mentions a memorial garden at midday, not the construction of the cloud structures.
*   **B: fi alsa3a 8:46 sba7an** (at 8:46 am): This is the time the camp was established, not when the cloud structures are being built.
*   **C: khlal allyl** (during the night): While the text mentions signals for midnight, it doesn't state that the construction happens at night. It implies that work is happening continuously.

* The text explicitly states: ""Tudhhiru suwar al-ashi3a ta7t al-7amra2 anna mutaghyirat al-7arara min al-layl ila nnahar shibaha li tilki al-lati fil kuhuf...""  This translates to ""The infrared images show that the temperature changes from night to day are similar to those in caves...""
*  The fluctuating temperature (warmer during the day, colder at night) is a key characteristic of caves, indicating they act as thermal conduits.
* The text contrasts the temperature behavior of The Seven Sisters with the stable temperatures of large surface areas, reinforcing the cave analogy.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: qtr mdakhl alkhf (the depth of entrance of the cave):** While the depth is mentioned, it's not the primary indicator of the cave-like nature.
* **C: alms7 aljywlwjy (the geological survey):**  The geological survey is mentioned as the source of the information, not the information itself.
* **D: swr alkhwf 3la alard (images of caves on the ground):** The text doesn't mention images of caves on the ground. It focuses on the infrared images showing temperature changes.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tudhhiru suwar al-ashi3a ta7t al-7amra2 anna mutaghyirat al-7arara..."" which translates to ""The infrared ray images show that the temperature variations...""
* The other options are incorrect. While the text mentions the caves are deep, it doesn't say they are ""deep pits in the earth,"" or that temperature variations are measured by ""the depth of the cave"" or ""geological surveys."" The temperature variations are observed *through* the infrared images.

Therefore, option D is the only inaccurate statement. The other options are all supported by the text:

*   **A: استخدامه شرح أثناء الهجوم (Istikhdamuhu sharh athnaa al-hujoom - His use of an explanation during the attack):** The text doesn't directly state this, but it's plausible as part of the investigation, so it's not definitively false.
*   **B: زعم أنه فجر قنبلة حش فيها ناس (Zaa'am annahu fajara qanbalatan hash fiha nas - He claimed to have detonated a bomb containing people):** The text says he detonated a bomb with explosives, implying the possibility of casualties.
*   **C: السلطات على دراية بعرقه (Al-sultat 'ala diraya bi 'irqih - The authorities are aware of his ethnicity):** The text explicitly states: ""ya3rifun annahu yantami ila majmu3at al-Uighur al-3irqiyya"" (they know that he belongs to the Uyghur ethnic group).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: hwyat jmy3 almsharkyn (The identity of all participants):** The text only mentions one suspect.
* **C: aldaf3 wra2 alhjwm (The motive behind the attack):**  The text doesn't provide any information about the motive.

Here's why:

The passage describes a situation where the pilots were maintaining a safe distance from the maneuvering units during the exercise. The Russian ground control actively intervened to restore the situation to normal. This implies a potential issue with the pilots not maintaining the appropriate distance, which is a critical safety concern during such maneuvers.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **B: al7ifaz 3la bwslh khrbyh** (Maintaining a destructive approach): The passage doesn't mention anything about a destructive approach being a problem.
* **C: tnshyt alnfath** (Activating ejection): While ejection is a possibility in dangerous situations, the passage doesn't indicate that the pilots were in imminent danger requiring ejection.
* **D: ast3eadh alwd3e altby3ey** (Preparing for a landing situation):  The passage focuses on the maneuvers during the flight, not preparing for a landing.



Therefore, the most likely problem encountered was maintaining the correct distance from the maneuvering targets.

This translates to: ""The Russian ground control activated the aircraft and restored the situation to normal for the search.""  The whole context is about a search operation (ma7a6ati al-fa'9a2ya) which means search for wreckage (usually from a crash).  The initial goal of such a search is to find a lost wreckage. The text doesn't mention anything about adjusting fleets, completing a drive, or activating openings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **C: تم رفع دعوى القضية في عام 2003.** (The case was filed in 2003.) - The text says the *law* passed in 2003 is being used, not that the case was filed in 2003.
* **D: رفعت AOL دعوى القضية.** (AOL filed the case.) -  The text states AOL *was accused of* something, not that AOL *filed a lawsuit*.


Therefore, **Option A (AOL was accused of distributing unwanted material)** best reflects the information contained in the provided text."

It also says ""qadiman min Ishbaliya"" which means ""coming from Seville"". This means he started playing for **Ishbaliya** before joining Barcelona.

This translates to: ""and there will not be issued any warning regarding this matter by the Jakarta Geophysical Agency, since the earthquake did not meet the requirements of its magnitude of 6.5.""

Option D directly reflects this reason. The other options are not mentioned or supported by the text.

*   **A: lm ykn hnak khtr mn hdwth tswnamy (There was no danger of a tsunami occurring):** While true, it's a consequence of the earthquake's magnitude, not the primary *reason* for not issuing a warning.

The question asks *why* the earthquake caused a reaction.  The text directly links the residents' worry and departure to the earthquake itself, not to the earthquake's magnitude, a tsunami threat, or the issuing of a warning. Therefore, their worry is the primary reason for the reaction.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: thdyd tswnamy (tsunami threat)**: The text explicitly states there was no tsunami threat.
*   **C: esdar thdhyr (issuing a warning)**: While a warning *might* have been issued, the text doesn't state that it was. The focus is on the *reaction* of the people.
*   **D: 6.5 drjh 3la almqyas (6.5 degrees on the scale)**:  The text mentions the magnitude, but it's used to explain *why* a tsunami warning wasn't issued, not as the cause of the people's reaction.

* **Convection and rotation are identified as key drivers of solar activity.**

The text explicitly states: ""Asba7a mawqe3 The Onion imbraturiyyat akhbar mu7akat sakhira 7aqiqiyya..."" which translates to ""The Onion website became a real empire of satirical news..."" and goes on to describe its various formats.  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn h3la' ghyr mdrj fi embratwryh dy anywn llmhakah alsakhrh alekhbaryh?","The correct answer is **A: atlas 3almy (atlas 3alamiy)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...wa atlas 3alamiy tamma itlaquhu mu2akharan wa yusamma Our Dumb World """"3alamuna al-ghabiy"""". "" which translates to ""...and a global atlas that was recently launched and is called Our Dumb World """"Our Stupid World"""".""

The other options are also mentioned in the text:

* **C: mwq3 elktrwny (electronic website)** - The text says ""mawqa3in iliktroniy jadhaba akthar min 5 malayin za2ir"" (""electronic website that attracted more than 5 million visitors"").
* **D: nskhh mtbw3eh (printed edition)** - The text mentions ""isdarin matbu3"" (""printed edition"").



Therefore, the atlas is a correct answer and the most fitting among the choices. Film is not mentioned in the text.

The text states: ""Indala3at al-i7tijajat fi Whitehall muqabel madkhal Downing Street al-ladhi ta7rushu al-shorta..."" which translates to ""The protests erupted in Whitehall opposite the entrance to Downing Street, where the police were confronting them...""

Therefore, the police were confronting protesters at the entrance to Downing Street.

ma hw alshyh fi albhth aldy ajrah aldktwr eyhwd awr?,"The correct answer is **D: b3d alf'eran ghyr almsabh balskry msabh alan balskry**

Here's why:

* The Arabic text states: ""ladayna al-2an fe2ran fi 3omor al-arba3 ashhor ghayr mousabin bi da2 as-soukari, ba3da an kanou mousabin bihi min qabel"" which translates to: ""We now have an infant at the age of four months who is not affected by diabetes, after having been affected by it previously."" 
* This indicates that the research found infants *without* a prior history of diabetes *developing* diabetes at four months. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: qd tkwn alnta'ej mfydh llmrda aldyn y'eanwn mn mrd alskry mn alnw'e 1 almwjود msbqaan** (The results may be useful for patients who already have type 1 diabetes): The text explicitly says the results are *not* related to type 1 diabetes.
* **B: b3d alf'eran almsabh balskry sabqaan lm t'ed msabh balskry** (After the infant was caused by diabetes previously, he did not get affected by diabetes again): This is the opposite of what the text says. The infant *did* develop diabetes again.
* **C: enh mtfa'el ban alnta'ej qd t'edy ela 3laj** (It is related that the results may lead to treatment): While the text mentions the possibility of treatment, it's not the core finding of the research itself.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy yshk fyh aldktwr awr?","The correct answer is **B: eda kan al3laj mmknaan** (if treatment is possible).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Wa yushakkek al-doktor Ehud Ur, mithil ba3edh al-5ubara2 al-a5arin, fi imkaniyat ashifa2 min marad as-soukari"" which translates to ""And Dr. Ehud Ur, like some other experts, doubts the possibility of a cure for diabetes.""

Option B directly reflects this doubt about the feasibility of a cure. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A:** Dr. Ur doesn't doubt the results are irrelevant to type 1 diabetes; he doubts a cure is possible in general.
*   **C:** Dr. Ur doesn't doubt the opinions of other experts; he shares their doubts.
*   **D:** Dr. Ur doesn't doubt the possibility of the infant remaining without diabetes; he doubts a cure for diabetes exists.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kanat kanat tu7awil atta2ira Twin Otter al-hubut fi Kokada al-bari7a khilal al-ri7la raqam CG4684 attabi3a li tayaran PNG, illa annaha muni3at min al-hubut.""  This translates to: ""The plane Twin Otter was trying to land in Kokada yesterday during flight number CG4684 following a PNG flight, but it was prevented from landing."" This implies at least one attempt.
* Later, it says: ""wa9a3ub al-wu9ul elayh bil7ad allthy dafa3a ela enzal shur6iyayn fy al-ghaba min ajl al-9u3ud ela makan al-7adith walba7th 3an najyn."" This translates to: ""We reached the crash site with the extent that forced two emergency landings in the forest in order to reach the site of the accident and search for survivors.""  The mention of *two* emergency landings strongly suggests *at least three* attempted landings before the failures forced them to crash.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lm ttmkn alta'erh fi alasl mn alhbwt bsbb altqs (The plane initially could not land due to the weather).** While bad weather contributed to the landing failure, the text doesn't state that *initially* the plane couldn't land due to weather.  The primary reason given for the landing failure is being *prevented* from landing.
* **B: thtmt alta'erh fi mkan b'eyd jdaan (The flight landed in a very distant place).** The plane *crashed* in a forest, not landed in a distant place.
* **D: tathr albhth 3n mwq'e thtm alta'erh baltqs (The search for the location was affected by the weather).** The text states that the search for the crash site was affected by the weather, but this isn't a direct consequence of the landing attempts.

Therefore, option C is the only one supported by the text."
ma aldy tsbb fi eyqaf alrhlh CG4684 lhbwtha?,"The correct answer is **D: كانت الأحوال الجوية سيئة (The weather conditions were bad)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""كما تسببت الأحوال الجوية السيئة كما تعسبب في فشل الهبوط."" which translates to ""And the bad weather conditions also caused the failure of the landing.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: لم يكن من الممكن الوصول إلى موقع الهبوط (It was not possible to reach the landing site):** While a contributing factor, the text says they *did* locate the crash site, so this isn't the direct reason for the landing being prohibited.
* **B: كان هناك العديد من الطائرات الأخرى قبل CG4684 (There were many other planes before CG4684):** This is irrelevant to the reason for *this* flight's landing prohibition.
* **C: تم تحويل مسار الطائرة إلى كوكودة (The plane's course was diverted to Kokoda):** The text says the plane *attempted* to land in Kokoda, but the landing was prohibited.  A diversion to Kokoda isn't mentioned.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kana annas yadribuna al-alwa7 al-zujajiyya bil karasi, laken al-nawafedh la yumkinu kasruha."" (People were hitting the glass panes with chairs, but the windows couldn't be broken.) This means they *tried* to break the windows, indicating a struggle.
* Franciszek Kowal's quote: """"enkasara a7ad alwa7 al-zujaj fi al-nihaya wa bada2ou bil 5ourouj min al-nafidha."""" (""Finally, one of the glass panes broke and they started to exit through the window."")  This implies effort and struggle *leading up to* the window finally breaking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tmkn mn ksr nafdh** (He managed to break the window): While he was part of the group that eventually broke the window, the text doesn't explicitly say *he* managed it. It says ""one of the glass panes broke.""
* **B: lm ysb bada fi alnhayh** (He didn't start in the end):  He *did* start to exit through the window *after* it broke.
* **C: ksr krsyaan athna' mhawlth alkhrwj** (He broke a chair while trying to exit): The text states people were hitting windows *with* chairs, not that he broke a chair while trying to exit.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: mn almtwq'e an tshtd al3asfa ltsbh e3sar (It is expected that the storm will intensify into a hurricane tomorrow)** - While intensification is mentioned, it doesn't explain *why* impact assessment is difficult.
* **B: al'elma' ghyr mtakdyn mn ryah al3asfa almstmrh (Scientists are not certain about the storm's sustained winds)** -  The text doesn't mention any uncertainty about sustained winds.
* **D: al3asfa b3eydh jdaan 3n myamy (The storm is very far from Miami)** - The distance from Miami is mentioned as a point of reference, but the main reason for difficulty in assessing impact is its distance from the mainland in general.

This translates to ""and that some studies indicate that the disease must become less lethal before it causes global epidemics.""

Therefore, the answer is A.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, km kan ale3sar b'eydaan 3n fwjyan?","The answer is **D: 77 kilometer**.

Here's why:

* The question states the location is about 70 kilometers from the main Fujian highways.
* The hurricane is moving *towards* Fujian.
* Therefore, the distance between the hurricane and Fujian is the initial distance (70km) plus the distance it travels towards Fujian (11km).
* 70km + 11km = 77km

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly hw alhdf al3am llhkwmh?","The correct answer is **D: التخفيف من اكتظاظ العربات (Reducing traffic congestion)**.

Here's why:

The announcement states the government is extending its commitment to fund the purchase of more buses (specifically 300 additional, bringing the total to 1300) *to alleviate traffic congestion*.  While the other options are factual details of the announcement, they are not the overarching *goal* the government is trying to achieve. The ultimate purpose of buying more buses is to reduce crowding/congestion.



"
mada a'elnt alhkwmh?,"The correct answer is **C: enha tkhtt ltmwyl 1300 3arbeh edafyh** (She is funding the purchase of 1300 additional buses).

Here's why:

* The question asks what the government announced.
* The passage states the government is extending its commitment to fund *1300* additional buses.
* Option C directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: enha tkhtt ltmwyl 300 3arbeh edafyh** (She is funding the purchase of 300 additional buses):  The announcement is for 1300, not 300.
* **B: enha mltzmh btkhfyf mshklh alnql** (She is committed to alleviating the transportation problem): While the bus purchase aims to alleviate the problem, the *specific announcement* is about funding 1300 buses.
* **D: sytm hl mshklh alaktzaz bhlwl mars** (This congestion problem will be solved by March): The announcement is about extending the funding commitment, not a promise of a solution by March.

* The second quote says: ""Wa adafat: 'Wa ma3a dhalik, fa inna khafid mustawa al-tahdid ila khatir la ya3ni anna al-tahdid al-shamel qad zala tamaman'"" which translates to ""And she added: 'And nevertheless, the level of the threat has been lowered to a danger level, which does not mean that the comprehensive threat has completely disappeared.'""

Therefore, the known information is that **the level of the threat has been lowered.** Options B and C are directly contradicted by the text. Option D is not supported by the provided information.

The text states: ""3uqidat al-lajnah ka rad min Martelly 3ala al-e7tijajat wasi3at al-nitaq al-munahidha lel nidham wa lati endala3at fi Tishrin al-awwal.  **Qala Martelly 3ala al-e7tijajat** (Martelly responded to the protests). This means the committee was *responding* *to* the protests, not *to* the protests.  Therefore, the assertion that the committee *responded* *to* the protests is not accurate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: athart alantkhabat almtakhrh alahtjajat** (The subsequent elections highlighted the protests): The text doesn't say elections highlighted protests. It says the protests were a cause of the election changes.
*   **C: wtalbt alahtjajat bastqalh almjls alantkhaby alm3qt alsabq** (And the protests demanded the resignation of the previous election council): While the protests did demand the resignation, the text doesn't say the protests *requested* it.
*   **D: kant alahtjajat 3nyfh fi b3d alahyan** (The protests were sometimes violent): The text explicitly states this: ""3anifa a7yanan bisabab al-ekhfaq fi 3aqd entikhabat..."" (sometimes violent due to the failure to hold elections...).

Therefore, option A is the only statement that is *not* supported by the text.

This translates to: ""and the presiding committee, last month, mediated the resignation of the previous interim electoral council as part of a set of measures for managing the country towards holding new elections.""  The presiding committee *mediated* the resignation, indicating they proposed or at least facilitated it.  The text also states that the resignation was a *response* to the protests, implying the presiding committee was involved in the process.

This translates to ""The United States Gymnastics Federation supports the undertaking of an independent investigation which may shed light on how the exploitation of trust...might not have been discovered for a long time and should include any necessary and appropriate changes.""

The other options are not supported by the text:

The text explicitly states: ""Kanat safina mudada lil algham min tiraz Avenger fi tariqiha ila Puerto Princesa fi **Palawan**."" This means the ship was traveling *to* Palawan, not based *in* Palawan.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: kant fi tryqha ela Puerto Princesa (it was on its way to Puerto Princesa)** - The text clearly states this.
* **C: enha sfynh kshfen 3n alalgham (it was a submarine detection ship)** - The text says ""safina mudada lil algham"" which translates to ""a ship equipped for anti-submarine warfare"" or ""a submarine hunting ship,"" making this accurate.
* **D: kant mulhqh fi alastwl alsab'e llbhryh alamrykyh (it was attached to the US Seventh Fleet)** - The text states ""Tamma ta3yin al-ustul al-sabi3 al-7arbi al-amriki wa maqaruhu fi Sasebo, Nagasaki fil Yaban"" which means the US Seventh Fleet and its headquarters were assigned to Sasebo, Nagasaki in Japan. The ship being part of that fleet is accurate.

This translates to: ""In a press conference, through the press secretary, Donald Trump announced that the American forces would leave Syria. This announcement came after Trump had a phone conversation with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.""

Therefore, Donald Trump is the one who made the announcement. While the press secretary conveyed the message, the source of the announcement was Trump.

This translates to ""and the American forces will take over the guarding of the ISIS fighters prisoners whom the Arab countries, according to the statement, refused their return.""  The prisoners are in Syria, and the Arab countries refused to take them back. Therefore, Syria is the location where the prisoners are and the responsibility for their care/guarding is being taken over by the US.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eda'eyh (ادعائي)** - This means ""my claims"" or ""my allegations"" and doesn't relate to the type of terrain.

The passage states: ""بالرغم من أن منصب الميناه سيارتفع بدمعة أقدام فقط من الفيضان، إلا أن يعمل المسؤولون أن يكون ذلك كافياً ل**استعادة الحواجز الرملية المتآكلة في اتجاه مجرى النهر**.""  This translates to: ""Although the river's discharge will only increase with floods, the officials should work to **restore the eroded sand barriers in the direction of the river's flow**.""

Therefore, the officials' goal is to restore the sand barriers, which are essential for creating sandbars and beaches, which in turn support wildlife.  Option A directly reflects this goal.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: تكون الشواطئ (tkwn al-shawati')** - Forming beaches is a *result* of restoring the sand, not the action the officials are taking.
* **C: زيادة عدد الشبوط الحذاب (zyadh 3dd al-shubut al-ahdab)** - Increasing the number of the ribbonfish is a potential *outcome* if the ecosystem recovers, but it's not the official's immediate action.
* **D: المزيد من مواطن الحياة البرية (al-mazeed mn mawaatin al-hayat al-barriyya)** - More wildlife habitats is a *desired result* of restoring the ecosystem, not the official's immediate action.

The construction of the dam stopped the seasonal sediment flow, leading to the disappearance of these habitats, and consequently, impacting fish populations and threatening the striped fish.  Therefore, the impact on wildlife habitats is a direct result of the dam's construction.

Makis Triantafylopoulos is mentioned as the journalist who reported the news about the corruption, making him a news reporter, not someone directly involved in the alleged corrupt activities.

The question asks which group *isn't* mentioned as part of the scandal. The text mentions judges (qadah) and lawyers (muhamun) as being involved. However, it doesn't mention **doctors (shafywn)**. Therefore, doctors are the group not explicitly mentioned in connection with the scandal.



"
km 3dd altsdydat alty khsrtha alhnd?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**.

The text explicitly states: ""wa khasirat 7 wikits li inha2 al-tasfiya"" which translates to ""and lost 7 wickets to end the qualification.""
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hy a3la drjh fi alashwat?","The correct answer is **A: 70 rkdh**.

The question states: ""Robin Uthanna 7aqqaqa a3la natija fi al-adwar mu7rizan 70 ramya..."" which translates to ""Robin Uthanna achieved the highest score in the tournament with 70 runs...""

Therefore, 70 runs is the highest score mentioned.
"
ay mma yly lys sbbaan lehbat Adam Cuerden?,"The best answer is **B: 7zf fn Wales (Removal of Wales)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Inna [Wales] kana kadhiban ma3ana mudhu al-bidaya.Fa qad tasarafa awalan kama law kana dhalika li asbab qanuniya. Thumma tadhahra bi-annahu yastami3 ilayna, wusulan ila 7adfhihi al-fanni"""".  This translates to: ""Indeed [Wales] has been lying to us since the beginning. He initially acted as if it were for legal reasons. Then he appeared to be listening to us, leading to his technical removal.""  This directly indicates that the removal of Wales is the central issue causing Adam Cuerden's concern.

While the other options are related, they aren't the *main* reason for his concern.

*   **A: syash almwq'e aljdydh fyma yt'elq balmhtwa aljnsy (New website policy regarding sexual content):** This is mentioned at the end as a result of the public outcry, not the primary trigger for Cuerden's frustration.
*   **C: edm esgha' Wales lh (Wales' listening to them):** This is a step *leading* to the removal, not the root of his anger.
*   **D: akadyb 7wl sbb hdf alfn (Lying about the reason for the technical removal):** While Wales' lying is mentioned, the *consequence* of that lying – the removal – is the core of Cuerden's problem.

Therefore, the removal of Wales is the most direct and significant reason for Adam Cuerden's concern.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy tm hdfh mn almwq'e?","The correct answer is **B: mhtwa jnsy (sexual content)**.

The text explicitly states: ""...wusulan ila 7adfhihi al-fanni"" which translates to ""...leading to his technical removal."" The subsequent sentence discusses the societal concern and efforts to formulate a policy regarding ""al-mu7tawa al-jinsi"" which translates to ""sexual content."" Therefore, the removal was related to sexual content.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly la yd'emh Amir Khan?","The correct answer is **C: ara' alnsa' (Women's opinions)**.

Here's why:

* **Amir Khan explicitly stated he believes women's fighting should not be included.** This is clearly mentioned in the text: ""A3taqidu annho la yanbaghi 3ala annisa2 al-qital. Hadha ra2yi al-7aqiqi"" (I believe that women's fighting should not be included. This is my true opinion).
* **He said he would support British competitors in the 2011 Olympics.** This is mentioned: ""illa annahu qala innahu sayad3am ak-mutanafisin al-britaniyin fi ulimbiyad 2011 al-lati tuqamu fi London."" (However, he said that he would support the British competitors in the 2011 Olympics which will be held in London).
* **He didn't say anything about hosting the Olympics in London.**
* **The question asks what he *doesn't* support.** He *does* support the British competitors.  He *doesn't* support women's fighting.  His opinion on women's opinions isn't directly addressed.

Therefore, the best answer is C because the text focuses on his opinion regarding women's fighting and his support for British athletes, and doesn't provide enough information to conclude he doesn't support women's opinions *specifically*. He doesn't support women fighting, which is related to their opinions and participation.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly syd'emh Amir Khan 3la alrghm mn rayh alshkhsy?","The correct answer is **C: awlmbyad 2012**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Bi-raghem min ta3liqatihi, illa annahu qala innahu sayad3am ak-mutanafisin al-britaniyin fi ulimbiyad 2011 al-lati tuqamu fi London."" This translates to: ""Despite his comments, he said that he would support the British competitors in the 2012 Olympics held in London.""

Therefore, despite his personal opinion against female fighters, Amir Khan stated he *would* support the 2012 Olympics.
"
mta mat Peter Lenz?,"The correct answer is **B: b3d sqwth mn drajth** (after falling from his bike).

The text states: ""Saqata Lenz min fawq darrajatihi 2athna2 fatrat 2al 2e7ma2, thumma sadamahu zamiluhu 2al mutasabeq Xavier Zayat. Tammat mu3alajetuhu 3ala 2al fawr min qebal 2al taqem 2al tobbe 2al mutanaqqel wa tamma naqluhu 2ela mustashfa ma7alli 7aythu tuwuffiyya la7iqan.""

Translation: ""Lenz fell from his bike during the race, then his colleague, racer Xavier Zayat, collided with him. He was immediately treated by the paramedics and was taken to a local hospital where he tragically died.""

Therefore, he died *after* falling from his bike.
"
mn hw Xavier Zayat?,"The correct answer is **B: mtsabq akhr** (another racer).

The text states: ""thumma sadamahu zamiluhu al mutasabiq Xavier Zayat"" which translates to ""then his colleague the racer Xavier Zayat collided with him.""
"

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome fear **based on the unknown or a lack of control.** This directly aligns with option B.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: eda kan alrakb ykhjl mn khwfh** (if the traveler is ashamed of their fear):  The text doesn't mention shame.
* **C: eda kan alrakb ynfr mn jmy'e anwa'e alnql** (if the traveler is afraid of all modes of transport): The text focuses *specifically* on flying.
* **D: eda kan qlqh ynb'e mn ahdath m3lmh la 3laqh lha baltyran** (if their anxiety stems from an event unrelated to flying): The text emphasizes fear *related* to flying.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the information presented in the text.

Here's why:

The question states that it's rare to book directly with the airline without first researching and comparing prices. The text emphasizes the potential for significant price differences between different booking platforms. Therefore, comparing prices across multiple platforms is the most important step for a cost-conscious traveler.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: albhth fi 'erwd shrkat alsfr almt3ddh (Searching on multiple travel agency websites):** While important, the text explicitly states to *first* compare prices *before* booking with the airline.
* **B: alhjz mbashrh m3 shrkh altyran (Booking directly with the airline):** The text implies this is not the optimal approach *first*, as you risk missing out on better prices.
* **D: tfqd mwq'e shrkh altyran (Checking the airline's website):** Checking the airline's website is helpful, but the text recommends comparison *before* visiting the airline's website.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy yjb 3la almsafryn f'elh awlaan mn ajl tamyn afdl as'ear alrhlat almmknh?","The correct answer is **B: mqarnh alas'ear byn mhrkat bhth alrhlat almkhtlfh (Comparing prices between different flight search engines)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Fi ba3e9 al a7yan mumkin an takhtalif talifat arri7lat nafsiha ila 7ad kabir fi majmu3at mukhtalifa..."" which translates to ""Sometimes the cost of the flight itself can differ significantly in different groups...""  This means prices vary between search engines.  Therefore, comparing prices is crucial to finding the best deal.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tfqd mwq'e shrkh altyran (Checking the airline's website):** While checking the airline's website is good practice, the passage emphasizes comparing prices *before* booking.
* **C: alhjz mbashrh mn khlal shrkh altyran (Booking directly through the airline):**  The passage advises comparing prices *first* and only then considering booking directly.
* **D: alhjz mbashrh m3 wkyl alsfr (Booking directly with a travel agent):** The passage specifically says booking directly through the airline *before* searching is less beneficial.



"
mta ykwn wjwd mrafq llshhnh drwryaan?,"The correct answer is **C: 3ndma tursl alashya' kamt'eh ytm fhsha (When sending goods as unpacked items).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lil husul 3alayha bishaklin asra3 huwa ersaluha ka amti3aten tamma fat7uha. Lan tasma7 al andhimat sharikat attayaran bi irsal al amti3a min ghaer rakeb, haythuma ta2ti anta.""  This translates to: ""To get them faster is to send them as unpacked items. Airlines will not allow sending goods as unpacked, where you are involved.""

This clearly indicates that a companion (mrafq) is necessary when sending goods *as unpacked items*.  This is because airlines have restrictions on sending unpacked items.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: 3ndma tursl alashya' 3n tryq alshhn aljwy (When sending goods by air freight):** While air freight is mentioned, the passage doesn't say a companion is *always* required for air freight. It's specifically tied to sending goods as unpacked items.
* **B: 3ndma tstkhdm alshrkh ta'eratha alkhash (When using the company's special aircraft):**  The passage doesn't mention special aircraft.
* **D: 3ndma ytm alt3aml m3 altslym mn qbl shrkh akbr (When dealing with delivery by a larger company):** The passage doesn't specify that dealing with a larger company necessitates a companion.

Here's why:

The prompt states that frequent flyer benefits can vary significantly between airlines within the same alliance.  It also emphasizes that frequent flyer points might be more valuable with one airline over another *within the same alliance*.  Therefore, prioritizing the airline that accrues the most points is the most logical approach to maximizing your rewards.

Let's look at why the other options are less ideal:

* **B: shrkh altyran fi akbr thalf** (The airline in the largest alliance): While alliance size is a factor, it doesn't guarantee better benefits for *you*.
* **C: shrkh altyran alty tsafr m3ha ghalbaan** (The airline you fly with most often):  Frequency of travel is important, but not the *sole* determinant of the best rewards program.
* **D: shrkh altyran alty qd tdyf amtyazat edafyh** (The airline that may offer extra perks):  Extra perks are nice, but points are often the most flexible and valuable reward.  The prompt focuses on points.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn qd yqadam nqat msafr da'em akthr?","The correct answer is **A: shrkh tyran mkhtlfh fi thalf mkhtlf** (Different airlines within the same alliance).

Here's why:

The prompt states that while it might seem easy to stick with one airline, the benefits (like frequent flyer points) can vary significantly *between airlines within the same alliance*.  Therefore, different airlines within the same alliance might offer more frequent flyer points.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shrkh alkhtwt aljwyh almntzmh tht nfs althalf walty tsafr m3ha akthr** (The same airline within the same alliance and the one you fly with most).  This is the opposite of what the prompt implies.  Sticking with one airline doesn't guarantee the highest points.
* **C: shrkh alkhtwt aljwyh almntzmh tht thalf mkhtlf walty tsafr m3ha akthr** (A different airline within a different alliance and the one you fly with most).  This is unlikely to yield the most points because you're not leveraging the frequent flyer program of the alliance you fly with most often.
* **D: shrkh tyran mkhtlfh dakhl nfs althalf** (Different airlines within the same alliance). This *is* a possibility, but A is a more precise and direct restatement of the prompt's core idea.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn alhwas altalyh ymkn an td'ef bsbb alefrat fi tnawl alkhwl?","The correct answer is **B: albsr (vision)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yumkinu an tashmal al-a7dath assi7ya al-mu7tamala 3ala al-mada al-ba3id min al-ifrat fi shurb al-ku7ul talaf al-kadib wa 7atta fuqdan al-basar wal wafat."" (Possible health events in the long term from excessive alcohol consumption can include liver damage and even loss of vision and death.)

While the text mentions liver damage (""talaf al-kadib""), it directly links excessive alcohol to potential vision loss (""fuqdan al-basar""). The other options (hearing, taste, smell) are not mentioned in connection with alcohol-related health risks in this passage.
"
"kma wrd fi alfa8arh, ma aldy ymkn an yqll mn alathar aldarh llkhwl?","The correct answer is **C: tnawl alkhwl ba'etdal (Drink alcohol in moderation)**.

Here's why:

The original text explicitly states: ""Ishrab al-mashrubat al-ku7uliya bi-i3tidal"" which translates to ""Drink alcoholic beverages in moderation.""  It also explains the dangers of excessive alcohol consumption.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tnawl alkhwl m3 almythanol (Drinking alcohol with methanol):**  The text *warns against* consuming illegally produced alcohol which *may contain* methanol. This is dangerous, not a way to lessen the harm.
* **B: shrb alkhwlyat almntjh bshkl ghyr qanwny (Drinking illegally produced alcoholic beverages):** The text *strongly warns against* this due to the dangerous contaminants.
* **D: alshrb m3 ashkhas mkhtlfyn (Drinking with different people):**  The text doesn't mention anything about the impact of drinking with different people.



Therefore, the only option aligning with the text's advice is to drink alcohol in moderation.



"
ayn tkwn qym al'eqarat mn byn a3la qym amstrdam?,"The best answer is **A: hy alqnah (it is the canal)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the Grachtengordel (Canal Belt) is a highly desirable area in Amsterdam.  The question asks where property values are among the highest in Amsterdam.  The text directly links the canal to the area's high value.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: fi ay mwq'e tm thdydh kmawqa3 turathiy 3alamiy tabi3 lil UNESCO (in a location threatened as a UNESCO World Heritage site).** While the UNESCO status is *part* of what makes the area valuable, the passage doesn't directly state that the area is *threatened*.  It emphasizes its heritage and value.
* **C: almnatq alty tmt ezaltha mn wst almdynh (the areas that were removed from the center of the city).** This is factually incorrect. The Canal Belt *is* in the center of the city.
* **D: almwaq'e dat alqymh altarykhyh (locations with historical value).**  While the Canal Belt *does* have historical value, the passage emphasizes the *canal itself* as a key element contributing to the high property values.



"
lmada tm tsnyf Mintaqat al Qanat kmawqa3 turathiy 3alamiy tabi3 lil UNESCO?,"The correct answer is **A: قيمتها التاريخية والثقافية (Its historical and cultural value)**.

The text explicitly states that the Canal Ring was classified as a UNESCO World Heritage site ""بفضل ثقافتها الفريدة و قيمتها التاريخية"" (thanks to its unique culture and historical value). While the other options are true aspects of the area, they are not the *reason* for the UNESCO classification according to the provided text.

This translates to: ""the gloomy atmosphere of the temple, and its views over the Tonle Sap lake make the climb to the top worthwhile.""

The text explicitly states that the views over Tonle Sap make the climb worthwhile. While the other options are related to visiting the area, they aren't specifically mentioned as making the visit to Phnom Krom *worthwhile* according to the text.  The Angkor Pass is a requirement, but not a feature that makes the visit appealing.  A trip to Siem Reap or the lake nearby are mentioned as possibilities but not as reasons to visit Phnom Krom itself.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma almtlwb mn alzwar ldkhwl Phnom Krom?","The correct answer is **C: alhswl 3la tsryh Angkor (getting an Angkor pass)**.

The text states: ""Yalzam wujud mamar Angkor li dukhul al-ma3bad... (You must have an Angkor pass to enter the temple...)"" This directly indicates that an Angkor pass is required.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""تتطلب لياقة بدنية، ولا يمكن أن تئم إلا في فصل الصيف من تشرين الثاني حتى Şubat، و **تقتصر إلى حد كبير على شبه الجزيرة والجزر وبحر Ross**.""  This translates to: ""It requires physical fitness, and it cannot be done except in the summer season from November to February, and **it is largely limited to the peninsula, islands, and Ross Sea**.""

This limitation on where you can go and the timing of the trip directly relates to the difficulty of physical transportation. Options A, B, and C are not mentioned as restrictions in the provided text.



"
ay jz' mn antartyka qd yzwrh alsa3a almhtm btslq aljbal?,"The correct answer is **B: almntqah al-dakhlia (the interior region)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tadhhab al-jawlat al-jawwiyya al-mutakhassisa ila addakhil, min ajel tasalluq al jibal aw lil wusul ila al qutub al ladayhi qa3ida kabira.""  This translates to: ""Special air tours go to the interior, for the purpose of climbing mountains or reaching the pole which has a large base.""

Therefore, the interior region is the area visited for mountain climbing.  The other options are mentioned as areas where tourism is generally limited or concentrated.



"

The text states: ""Tu3addu mu3dham teleskobbat al-ba7eth al-7aditha marafiq ha2ila fi al-manatiq al-na2iya dhat al-dhuruf al-jawwiya al-mula2ima."" This translates to: ""Most of the recently discovered observatories are facilities located in remote areas with suitable weather conditions.""

Option C directly reflects this information. The text also says that the pollution of light is not the main problem now and is usually found in cities or holy places, which eliminates options B and D. Option A is a consequence of the observatories being in remote areas, but not the location itself.
"

Here's why:

The text states: ""3adatan ma tabqa ka mata7if aw mawaqi3 ta3limiyyah"" which translates to ""Usually, they remain as museums or educational sites."" This indicates that telescopes from the past are typically found in museums.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: fi hrm jam3h (in the Grand Mosque):** The text says light pollution isn't the main problem it is today and is more common in cities, not religious sites.
* **C: fi mwq'e t'elymy (at an educational site):** While educational sites *can* house telescopes, the text explicitly states museums as the typical location for historical ones.
* **D: fi mnshah kbyrh (in a large facility):** This is too general and doesn't align with the specific context of historical telescopes being preserved in museums.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hy almntqh alafdl lywm alshat'e alhad'e?","The answer is **C: mantiqat North Harbour**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""jami3 ashawati2 taqriban ramliya 2amina li ssiba7a, wa tujad bi-aghlabiha dhilal ashjar pohutukawa."" (almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them have pohutukawa trees providing shade). This describes the North Harbour beaches. The text doesn't mention St Heliers, Mission Bay, or Waitemata Harbour specifically being *the best* for quiet swimming.  It focuses on the North Harbour as having calm, sandy beaches with shade – ideal for a relaxing swim.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ayn mn almhtml an tkwn zrwf alsbahh alakthr amanaan?","The text states: ""Jami3 ashawati2 taqriban ramliya 2amina li ssiba7a, wa tujad bi-aghlabiha dhilal ashjar pohutukawa."" which translates to ""Almost all beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them have pohutukawa trees.""

Then it specifically says: ""Hadhihi shawati2 3a2iliya muzda7ima fi ba3dh al-a7yan ma3a majmu3a mina al-matajir allati tastaffu 3ala ashati2. assiba7a 2amina."" which translates to ""These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes crowded, with a collection of shops that cater to beach activities. **Swimming is safe**.""

Since the text states that swimming is safe on *almost all* beaches, and doesn't specify any danger at any beach, we have to infer from the description of each beach area to determine which one *sounds* like it would be safest.

*   **Devonport:** Described as being in the North Harbour, safe for swimming, and having pohutukawa trees.
*   **mantiqat North Harbour:** Described generally with safe swimming and pohutukawa trees.
*   **wst Auckland:** (Mid Auckland) Described as family-friendly and sometimes crowded.
*   **Long Bay:** Described as being at the northernmost point of the North Harbour, safe for swimming and having pohutukawa trees.

There's no *explicit* answer in the text. However, the description of **Devonport** and **Long Bay** both say that swimming is safe. Based on the options provided, the best answer is **A: Devonport** or **D: Long Bay**. Since Devonport is listed first among the options describing safe swimming, it is the most likely answer.

However, based on the options, the most accurate answer, considering that the question asks where swimming would be safer, is likely either Devonport or Long Bay. Since both are North Harbour beaches, and the prompt wants a specific place, **A: Devonport** is a reasonable selection.

**Therefore, the best answer is A: Devonport.**

"

Here's why:

The original text explicitly forbids ""wade3 3alamat aw al kitaba 3ala al judran fil hayakil"" which translates to ""placing signs or writing on the walls of the structures."" Option B, ""trk 3lamh fi mkan ma 7owl almwq'e"" (leaving a sign somewhere around the site), is a direct synonym and therefore equally inappropriate.

Let's look at why the other options are acceptable:

* **A: altsrf bwqar (Being respectful):** The text stresses the importance of respect and honoring the site.
* **C: elqa' ald'eabat (Playing games):** While generally not appropriate for a sacred site, it's not explicitly forbidden in the text.
* **D: khdsh mbna (Scratching the building):** The text forbids distorting the sites by damaging the structures.

Therefore, option B is the most clearly inappropriate action based on the provided text.



"
ay mn hdh altalyh tsf lghat altwasl almshtrk?,"The correct answer is **D: مكتسب (muktasab)**, which means **acquired**.

Here's why:

The Arabic text describes a ""مُسَاعِدَة"" language (assistant language) as one that is *not* a natural or inherent language. It's created intentionally to facilitate communication where a shared language is difficult. This means it's **acquired** – learned and adopted by people who don't naturally speak it.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: مستنته (mustantih)** - Derived/Inferred - This doesn't fit the description of a constructed language.
* **B: غير طبيعية (ghayr tabii'iyya)** - Not natural - While the assistant language *is* not natural, it's not the defining characteristic in the context of how it's acquired.
* **C: مبنية (mabniyya)** - Constructed/Built - While assistant languages are constructed, the key aspect is that they are *acquired* by speakers of other languages.



"
ay jmlh la tsf bdqh allghat almsa'edh?,"The best answer is **B: enha lghat tby'eyh wmbnyh** (it is a constructed and built language).

Here's why:

* The original text states: ""Al-lughat al-musa3ida hiya lughat mus6ana3a aw mabniyya tamma insha2uha bi qasd tashil attawasul bayna al-shu3ub...""  This translates to: ""The auxiliary language is a constructed or built language that has been intentionally created to facilitate communication between peoples...""

* Option B directly reflects this, highlighting that the language is *constructed* and *built*.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: enha lghat 'edwyh tstkhdm ltshyl altwasl byn alashkhas aldyn qd la yfhmwn b3dhm alb3d btryqh akhra** (It is a simplified language used to facilitate communication between people who may not understand each other in another way). While the auxiliary language *facilitates* communication, the text emphasizes its *constructed* nature and purpose beyond simple simplification.
* **C: enha lghat mbnyh lthsyn synarywhat alatsal als'ebh** (It is a built language for overcoming difficult communication). This is too narrow. The auxiliary language isn't *only* for overcoming difficulties; it has a broader purpose of enabling communication between speakers of different languages.
* **D: tnsha klghat mhymnh byn almt7dthyn blghat mkhtlfh** (All important languages are created between speakers of different languages). This is incorrect.  Not all important languages are auxiliary languages; many natural languages exist.



Therefore, **B** is the most accurate and directly supported by the original text.

This indicates that passengers need to verify the cabin location as part of the procedures when traveling by sea in winter.

The text also mentions that passengers are informed of the visa requirements (shurut atta2shira), but the primary instruction regarding winter crossings focuses on cabin location.

This translates to: ""In the case of crossing the North Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as crossing the ice causes terrible situations for the most vulnerable people.""

The question asks what passengers can avoid *according to the text*. The text directly warns about the dangers of crossing the ice. The other options are either unrelated (A and D) or are requirements for the journey (C - obtaining a visa), not something to be avoided.

Therefore, the repeated use of Catalan on signs and announcements is because it's legally the primary official language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: enha mfhwmh 3la ntaq aws'e mn alesbanyh** (It has a wider understanding than Spanish): The text actually says the opposite – Spanish is used for public transport announcements because they need to reach a wider audience.
* **C: enha allghh almfdlh fi brshlwnh** (It's the preferred language in Barcelona): The text states that while Catalan is the official language, Spanish is used for announcements due to practical reasons. It doesn't say Catalan is *preferred*.
* **D: almwatnwn aldyn yt7dthwn alkatalwnyh hm akthr mn ytrdd 3la almtrw walmrafq al3amh alakhra** (Citizens who speak Catalan are more frequent users of the metro and other public facilities): The text doesn't provide information about who uses the metro.

This translates to: ""Regular announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan, but announcements about unplanned disruptions are made through a system with a diverse group of languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.""

Therefore, English is one of the languages used for announcements about disruptions.

"bna'an 3la alfa8arh, ay mn wsa'el alrahh altalyh mn ghyr almhtml an ytm e'eta'eha alawlwyh fi mbyt weftar raqy?","The text emphasizes that the primary factors differentiating upscale accommodations are **bedding and breakfast**. 

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: بنود قائمة الطعام المتخصصة (Specialized menu items):** While a good breakfast is important, the text focuses more on the *type* of breakfast offered (seasonal, local dishes) rather than specific menu items.
* **B: مفروشات إتقان فريد (Unique exquisite furnishings):** The text explicitly mentions ""afkham anwa3 al-afrisha"" (the finest kinds of furnishings), including handmade items and antique beds. This is a key differentiator.
* **C: مساحات خارجية جيدة التصميم (Well-designed outdoor spaces):** The text mentions ""misa7at khadhra2 mushadhabba"" (landscaped green spaces) and a ""7awdh siba7a"" (fountain). This is a positive aspect but not the *primary* focus.
* **D: WiFi سريع (Fast WiFi):**  While WiFi is a desirable amenity, the text doesn't highlight it as a defining characteristic of upscale establishments.

Therefore, based on the text's emphasis, the best answer is **B: مفروشات إتقان فريد (Unique exquisite furnishings)**. The text directly links luxurious furnishings with a high-end experience.



**Final Answer: B**"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the main points of competition between luxury hotels and breakfasts are **""al-firash wa wajabat al-iftar"" (beds and breakfast)**. It further details that the beds can be handmade or antique, and the breakfast can include seasonal local foods or traditional dishes. 

Modern decor is not mentioned as a key differentiator. The text focuses on the quality of the beds and the food offered. Therefore, modern decor is the one not mentioned.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Satastadhif Beijing 7aflatay al-iftita7 wal khitam wa tadhahurat al-jalid addakhiliya.""  This translates to: ""Beijing will host the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony and the indoor ice shows.""

*   **A: mrasm alafttah (opening ceremony)** - The text explicitly mentions this.
*   **C: mrasm alakhttam (closing ceremony)** - The text explicitly mentions this.
*   **D: ahdath aljlyd aldakhlyh (indoor ice shows)** - The text explicitly mentions this.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: mntqh tayzytshngh lltzlj (TaiyiCheng snow region)** - While skiing events will be held in the TaiyiCheng region, the text specifically states that **Beijing** will host the opening and closing ceremonies and the indoor ice shows. The TaiyiCheng region is a separate location.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly ststdyfh bkyn fi 3am 2022?","The correct answer is **C: dwrh alal'eab alawlmbyh alshtwyh (Hosting the Winter Olympic Games)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Satakunu madinat Pekin fi ssin al-madina al-mudhifa lil-al3ab al-Olimpiya ashitwiya fi 3am 2022"" which translates to ""The city of Beijing will be the host city for the Winter Olympic Games in the year 2022.""

While Beijing also hosted the opening and closing ceremonies (B), and indoor skating shows (B), the main focus of the passage is that Beijing hosted the Winter Olympics. It also mentions that other skiing events will take place in Zhangjiakou (which is near Beijing). The text doesn't mention hosting the Summer Olympics. Therefore, option C is the most accurate and comprehensive answer.



"

The text states: ""Laqad tadamman mu3dham al-ashkhas al-3amilina fi tarbiyat addawajin, wa lakin hunaka aydan ba3d al-ma5atir 3ala muraqibi a66uyur."" This translates to ""Most people working in raising poultry were involved, but there were also some risks to bird flu monitors.""

Therefore, bird flu monitors are specifically mentioned as being at risk. While others are also at risk, the text explicitly identifies bird flu monitors as one of the groups facing danger.
"

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tamma al-iblagh 3an aqal min alef 7ala bayna al-bashar, lakin b3dhaha kana qatilan."" (Less than a thousand cases have been reported among humans, but some of them have been fatal.)
* **Option B directly reflects this information.** The passage highlights that there are cases in humans, exceeding the reported cases in birds (though the actual number of bird cases isn't specified).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: fqt 'emal aldwajn asybwa balenflwnza** (Only veterinarians cause influenza) - The passage mentions that most people working in raising chickens are involved, but doesn't claim they *cause* the influenza.
* **C: mraqbw altywr m3rdwn lkhtr alesabh** (Bird watchers are exposed to danger) - While the passage mentions a risk to bird watchers, it's not the central point describing the influenza itself.
* **D: jmy'e alhalat almblgh 3nha fi albshr kant qatlh** (All reported cases in humans were fatal) - The passage explicitly states that *some* of the human cases were fatal, not *all*.

The text specifically states: ""في قitarات annawm allayliya, yumkin lil-mu7assil istilam jawazat assafar 7atta la taqta3a nawmak."" which translates to ""In night sleeper trains, the passenger can receive travel documents so that their sleep is not interrupted.""

Therefore, you can have your ID checked **on the moving train**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that in the ""upper equatorial regions"" of Singapore (north of the equator), you'll need to deal with ""heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, which is rarely).""  This directly points to the problem of heat.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely based on the text:

* **A: alt'erd llsrqh (theft):** The passage doesn't mention any issues with theft.
* **B: edm emkanyh alwswl ela almtajr (lack of access to shops):** The passage says you can buy almost anything after arriving.
* **D: aldya'e (getting lost):**  There's no indication of difficulty in getting lost.

Therefore, the most probable problem mentioned in the passage for staying in the upper equatorial regions of Singapore is heat exhaustion.
"

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Therefore, someone with a nut allergy would want to avoid them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: shkhs yfdl alhlwyat alakthr ghna** (someone who prefers richer sweets) - The text describes the pastries as ""rich and diverse"" and mentions nuts, which *contribute* to richness, but doesn't say someone who prefers richness would want to *avoid* them.
* **C: shkhs la yhb alshwkwla** (someone who doesn't like chocolate) - The text doesn't mention chocolate.
* **D: shkhs yfdl alnkhat alhlwh 3la alnkhat alghnyh** (someone who prefers sweet flavors over rich flavors) - The text describes the pastries as ""rich and diverse,"" implying they have a rich flavor profile. Someone who prefers sweet over rich would likely *avoid* them.

Therefore, the only logical reason someone would want to avoid German pastries based on the text is a nut allergy.
"
ma hw almkwn aldy y'etbr 3nsraan mwsmyaan fi alm3jnat alalmanyh?,"The correct answer is **A: التفاح (altfah)** which means **apple**.

The text states: ""Tu3tabar mu3ajjanat al-fakiha sha2i3a, 7aythu yatimmu tahy attufa7 **في** al-mu3ajanat 3ala madar assana..."" This translates to: ""Fruit pastries are considered common, where apples are grown in pastries throughout the year...""  This indicates apples are a key ingredient, appearing throughout the year.

While almonds, hazelnuts, peaches, and cherries are mentioned as ingredients in German pastries, the text explicitly states that apples are cultivated *in* the pastries themselves, making them a seasonal and core ingredient.

This translates to: ""The advice assumes that travelers do not steal or encroach on the property of others or participate in illegal markets or begging or exploit others to achieve their personal gains.""

Asking for money from people falls under the category of exploitation or seeking personal gains through others, which is directly prohibited by the advice.

Let's look at why the other options *are* good advice for budget travel:

* **A: albhth 3n wza'ef ghrybh llqyam bha athna' rhlatk (Look for strange weaknesses to do during your trip):** This likely refers to finding free activities or opportunities – a good way to save money.
* **B: kn mrnaan m3 mstwa rahtk (Be flexible with the level of your trip):**  Being flexible means being willing to adjust your plans to fit your budget – a core principle of budget travel.
* **D: khfd alnfqat mthl alt3am walskn (Reduce expenses such as food and accommodation):** This is a fundamental aspect of budget travel.



"

This describes a person who is willing to face a challenge (althady) to achieve extremely low travel expenses. The other options aren't directly linked to the core motivation described in the text.

ay mn altsryhat altalyh la tsf bdqh alqyadh byn Point Marion wa Fairmont?,"The correct answer is **C: nadraan ma ytm alaltzam bhdwd alsr3eh (Compliance with speed limits is rare)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tu3addu assur3at al-muqarrara al-mubayana 3ala allafitat aqal bishaklin mal7udh mimma kanat 3alayh fil aqsam assabiqa wa alla7iqa – 3adatan ma takun 35-40 mile fi assa3a (56-64 km / sa3a) – wa yumathil al-iltizam bi hadhihi assur3at ahamiyat baligha akthar min ayi shay2 akhar. (The speed limits indicated on the signs are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections - usually 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and compliance with these speeds is of vital importance.)""

This directly contradicts option C, which claims that speed limits are rarely followed. The text emphasizes the *importance* of adhering to the low speed limits.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate descriptions:

* **A: hnak msahat twylh mn altrq alryfyh alna'eyh (There are long stretches of remote rural road):** The text mentions ""khidmat al-hatif al-ma7mul aqwa bi-kathir huna min al-3adid min al-imtidadat al-2ukhra li-ttariq, 3ala sabil al-mithal Pennsylvania Wilds. (Cell phone service is much stronger here than on many other stretches of the road, for example, Pennsylvania Wilds).""  Remote rural roads often have weaker cell service, so strong service suggests a relatively isolated area.

* **B: almmrat dyqh (The road is narrow):** The text mentions ""almmrat dyqh"" as a description.

* **D: la ynbghy an tkwn khdmh alhatf almhmwl mshklh (Cell phone service shouldn't be a problem):** The text states that cell phone service is *stronger* here than in other locations.

This translates to: ""It features steep declines, curves, and narrow lanes. If you are not accustomed to driving on rural roads, then stay focused: **take curves at high speed**."" The passage emphasizes that taking curves at high speed is a major concern.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alwqw'e fi hrkh almrwr alkthyfh (Traffic congestion)** - The passage doesn't mention traffic congestion as a problem on this road.
* **B: nqs khdmh alhatf alkhlwy alkafyh (Lack of sufficient mobile phone service)** - The passage states the opposite: mobile phone service is *stronger* here than on many other stretches of the road.

Options A, B, and C (ability to swim, high physical fitness, and jumping ability) are all mentioned as being involved in canyoning, even if not a *huge* requirement.  However, the text *specifically* says it requires ""little training."" Therefore, having a lot of training isn't *required* to *start* canyoning.



"
ay mma yly qd ykwn drwryaan lrhlh tjdyf najhh?,"The best answer is **D: qdrh alsbahh (swimming ability)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states the activity involves canyons filled with water.** Therefore, being a strong swimmer is crucial for navigating the water within the canyon and for safety in case of falls.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: qdrh ryadyh mtqadamh (advanced athletic ability):** While some athleticism helps, the text says it requires *relatively* little training compared to other adventure sports.
* **B: tjrbh sabqh m3 alghws (previous experience with diving):**  The text doesn't mention diving as a core element. Swimming is more relevant.
* **C: shhadh fi altjdyf (certification in canyoning):** While a certification is *recommended* and ideally desirable, the question asks what is *necessary*.  The text indicates that relatively little training is needed to *start*.  Therefore, a certification might be a later step, but not an immediate requirement for a successful trip.

**Therefore, swimming ability is the most essential prerequisite based on the information provided.**

The text explicitly states: ""Yumkinu attakhyim fi assayara idha kana ladayk minivan kabir aw sayarat daf3 ruba3y aw sedan aw Station Wagon bi-maqa3id ta2khudh wadh3 al-istilqa2.""  This translates to: ""You can camp in a car if you have a large minivan, a 4x4 car, a sedan, or a Station Wagon with reclining seats.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: fhm qwy lqywd syartk** (a strong understanding of your car's limitations): While useful, it's not a *necessary* condition for camping.
* **C: khymh** (a tent): A tent is camping equipment, not a car feature.
* **D: mlkyh khash lltkhyym fyha** (private property where you can camp):  This refers to *where* you camp, not a feature of the car itself.

The text explicitly states: ""Yumkinu 2an yu2ady insha2 khayma fi milkiya khassa aw fi madina min ayi 7ajm ila jadhb al-intibah ghayr al-marghub fihi bi-suhula."" This translates to: ""It can be done to set up a tent in private property or in a city of any size to attract unwanted attention easily.""

The question asks what a camper might want to avoid if they want to avoid attracting attention. The text suggests setting up a tent in a city or private property *attracts* attention. Therefore, avoiding setting up a tent in such locations would help avoid unwanted attention.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: qyadh syarh akbr, mthl syarh df'e rba'ey aw shahnh sghyrh (Driving a larger car, such as a quad-wheel drive or a small van):** The text implies larger cars *are* used for camping, not that they help avoid attention.

*   **D: alaftqar ela alelmam balmrkbh alty ystkhdmha (Lack of knowledge about the vehicle being used):** The text doesn't suggest a lack of vehicle knowledge affects attention.

This translates to: ""You will find the romantic and charming city of Sintra, which became famous among foreigners after registering a description of its stunning views by Lord Byron.""

Therefore, Lord Byron's positive descriptions are the reason for Sintra's fame among foreigners.

The question asks why Armenia doesn't officially recognize Nagorno-Karabakh as a state. The text states that a new republic was established in Nagorno-Karabakh with Armenian support, but it lacks recognition from any existing state, including Armenia.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alhrb dd aladrbyjanyyn (war against Azerbaijan):** While the war contributed to the situation, it doesn't explain *why* Armenia doesn't recognize Nagorno-Karabakh.
*   **C: alhjj adrbyjan aldblwmasyh (diplomatic struggle with Azerbaijan):** This describes the ongoing diplomatic conflict, not the reason for the lack of recognition.
*   **D: aljmhwryh aljdydh (the new republic):** The new republic itself is the *result* of the situation, not the reason for Armenia's non-recognition.

Therefore, the core issue is the status of the Nagorno-Karabakh region, which is the reason Armenia doesn't officially recognize it as a state."
ma aldy la yzal y'ethr 3la al3laqat byn Azerbaijan wa Armenia?,"The best answer is **C: alhjj aldblwmasyh (the diplomatic struggle)**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks about the *current* impact.** The passage states that ""Yuwasil aljadal al diBlomasi 7awla al mintaqa fi ifsad al3alaqa bayn Armenia wa Azerbaijan"" - meaning ""The diplomatic dispute over the region continues to damage the relationship between Armenia and Azerbaijan."" This indicates that diplomacy (or lack thereof) is the ongoing factor affecting relations.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: alarmn aldyn y'eyshwn fi Azerbaijan (the people living in Azerbaijan):** While the people are affected, the passage focuses on the *relationship* between the two countries, not specifically on the population.
* **B: 7rb 1994 (the 1994 war):** The war was a significant event *leading to* the current situation, but the passage emphasizes that the conflict is ongoing and its consequences are still being felt through diplomatic efforts.
* **D: eqlym Nagorno-Karabakh (the Nagorno-Karabakh region):** Nagorno-Karabakh is the *core issue* of the conflict, but the passage highlights the broader ongoing struggle *around* that issue, which is diplomatic.



Therefore, the continuous diplomatic struggle is the most accurate answer to the question of what still affects the relationship between Azerbaijan and Armenia.

Option B, ""wजूद ثلاث ركاب"" (having three passengers), is the direct implication of this statement regarding extra fees.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aleqamh fi mntqh akhra (taking it to another area):** The text doesn't mention fees related to destination.
* **C: aldhab ela abtawn (going to Uptown):** The text mentions Uptown as having more child-friendly options, but not as a fee-related factor for ride-sharing.

This translates to: ""Families in Charlotte do not use taxis in general, although they may be useful in certain circumstances. There is an additional cost for more than two passengers, so this option may be more expensive than necessary.""

This indicates that taxis are considered a potentially *negative* aspect of living in Charlotte with children due to the cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: as'ear alskn (housing prices)** - The text doesn't mention housing prices at all.
* **C: almqymyn mn mnatq akhra (residents from other areas)** -  This is a fact stated in the text, not a negative aspect of *living* there with children.

This translates to: ""Before the arrival of the Spanish in the 13th century, the north of Chile was under the rule of the Incas, while the indigenous inhabitants of the Araucanian (Mapuche) lived in central and southern Chile."" The text then explicitly states the Mapuche were one of the last independent indigenous groups in America and did not fully submit to Spanish rule until Chile's independence. Therefore, they controlled the northern part of the region *before* the Spanish arrival.

* **C: kant alhrwb alnablywnyh jaryh** (The Napoleonic Wars were ongoing) - This is explicitly stated.
* **D: a'elnt tshyly astqlalha** (The declaration of independence) - Chile declared independence in 1810.
"
kyf ymkn llnas alwswl ela alqra alna'eyh fi mntqh Liguria?,"The correct answer is **B: balsyarh aw alqtar** (by train or boat).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Tarbut al qitarat wal qawareb al quran, wa la yumkin lil sayyarat al wusul ilayha min al kharej.""  This translates to ""Trains and boats connect the villages, and cars cannot access them from the outside.""  Therefore, the only ways to reach these villages are by train or boat.
"
"""ma aldy yshyr elyh almstlh aleytaly """"Cinque Terre""""?""","The correct answer is **A: khms qra (five villages)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Cinque Terre, al lati ta3ni khams aradi, tadumu khams qura sa7iliyya saghira hiya Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza wa Monterosso..."" which translates to ""Cinque Terre, which means five lands, consists of five small coastal villages which are Riomaggiore, Manarola, Corniglia, Vernazza and Monterosso...""

Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" means ""five villages"".
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hw nw'e alhda' almnasb lzrwf alshta' alzlqh almhtmlh?","The correct answer is **D: ahdyh bdwn rsm b'emq 1/5 bwsh (hoes without a pattern with a depth of 1/5 inch or more)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yajib an yakun annamat 3amiq bi darajatin kafiya 5 mm (1/5 inchan) aw akthr..."" which translates to ""The tread must be sufficiently deep with a depth of 5 mm (1/5 inch) or more...""

Option D accurately reflects this requirement by mentioning a tread depth of 1/5 inch or more.  The other options are incorrect because they don't match the described characteristics of footwear suitable for slippery winter conditions. The text emphasizes tread depth and material flexibility, not heel type or specific sole patterns.



"
ayun mn altaly ln ysa'ed fi thsyn aljr 3la altrq aljlydyh athna' zrwf alshta'?,"The correct answer is **D: alma' (water)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that sand, gravel, and salt (calcium chloride) are used to improve traction on icy roads.** This is because they provide grip.
* **Water on ice will make the surface *more* slippery, not less.** Ice is already a slick surface, and adding water will exacerbate the problem.

Therefore, water would *not* help prevent slipping on icy roads. The other options (salt, gravel, sand) all improve traction.
"
ay mn altaly hw tshabh dqyq byn Hawaii wjzr Cook?,"The correct answer is **C: ytsharkan nfs almntqh alzmnyh** (They share the same time zone).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Li-tamayuziha bi-nnitaq azzamany nafsahu li-Hawaii, yundhar a7yanan ila al-juzur 3ala annaha """"al-mantiqa al-3aliya min Hawaii""""."" (To distinguish them by the same time zone as Hawaii, the islands are sometimes referred to as the ""upper region of Hawaii"").

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: klahma ldyh al'edyd mn alfnadq alkbyrh** (Both have many large hotels) - The text says Cook Islands *lack* large tourist hotels.
* **B: klahma lys lhma wd'e wlayh** (Both are not landlocked) - The text doesn't mention whether either is landlocked or not.
* **D: klahma lys fyh ay mdn** (Both have no cities) - The text states Cook Islands have *no* cities. Hawaii, however, has many cities.



"
ay mma yly la ysf bdqh jzr Cook?,"The correct answer is **A: enha asghr mn Hawaii** (it is smaller than Hawaii).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ala arraghm min kawniha asghar 7ajman, fa hiya tudhakkir ba3dh kibar assin azza2irin laha bi-Hawaii qabla istiqlaliha..."" which translates to ""Despite being smaller in size, it reminds some of the larger islands it has in Hawaii before its independence..."" This means Cook Islands are *smaller* than Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: enha arkhbyl** (it is archipelago): The text says ""Innahu arkhabil yadhum 15 jazira..."" which means ""It consists of an archipelago of 15 islands...""  So, it *is* an archipelago. The statement isn't what the text is saying.
* **C: almdyntan alr'eysytan huma Rarotonga wa Aitutaki** (the two main cities are Rarotonga and Aitutaki): The text says ""ahammuha jazirat Rarotonga wa Aitutaki"" which translates to ""The most important ones are the islands Rarotonga and Aitutaki."" It does *not* say they are cities.
* **D: tshark aldwlh aljzyrh almntqh alzmnyh m3 Hawaii** (the state shares the time zone with Hawaii): The text states ""tadhumu juzur Cook ay mudun, wa lakinnaha tadhmu 15 jazira mukhtalifa"" which means ""Cook Islands do not have any cities, but it consists of 15 different islands."" and ""tshark aldwlh aljzyrh almntqh alzmnyh m3 Hawaii"" (The state shares the time zone with Hawaii) is in option D, but the text doesn't actually say that."
ay mn mhtat alhras altalyh tqadam nw'eyn mn khyarat aleqamh?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text explicitly states: ""Sirena m7attat al7irasa al-wa7ida allaty tuqaddimu assakan fi salat nawm mushtaraka wa wajabat sakhina bil-2idhafa ila attakhyim.""  This translates to ""Sirena is the only ranger station that offers accommodation with shared sleeping arrangements and hot meals in addition to camping.""

The text also mentions that La Leona, San Pedrillo, and Los Patos *do not* offer accommodation with hot meals and shared sleeping arrangements, and are only available for camping without meal service. Therefore, only Sirena offers two distinct options (accommodation with meals and camping only).
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ayn ymknk hjz tsryh hdyqh eda knt tryd astkhdam alnqwd bdlaan mn ala'etman?","The correct answer is **C: mqha CafeNet El Sol**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Min al-mumkin al-7usul 3ala tasari7 al-7adiqa mubasharatan min markaz al-7irasa fi muqata3at Puerto Jiménez, lakinnahum la yaqbalun bitaqat al-i2timan. Tuqaddimu CafeNet El Sol khidmat 7ajz muqabil rusum qadruha 30 dolar amriki, aw 10 dolarat amrikiya li yawm w7id.""

This translates to: ""It is possible to obtain a park permit directly from the guard station in the Puerto Jiménez area, but they do not accept credit cards. CafeNet El Sol offers a reservation service for a fee of $30 US dollars, or $10 US dollars per day.""

Therefore, CafeNet El Sol is the only option mentioned where you can reserve a permit *without* using a credit card. While Puerto Jiménez is where you *can* get a permit, the text explicitly says they don't accept credit cards.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma nw'e altzlj aldy ytm fi altdarys alakthr anhdaraan?","The correct answer is **A: almshy lmsafat twylh 3la altzlj** (walking long distances on snow).

The text explicitly states: ""haythu yatimmu hadha al-akhir fi tadharis shadidat al-in7idar wa tatatallab zallajat wa a7dhiya akthar salaba.""  This translates to ""where the latter (mountaineering/climbing) is done in very steep terrains and requires skis and more rigid boots.""  The text then contrasts this with snowshoeing (""Think of snowshoeing as a path similar to walking for a long distance"").  Therefore, snowshoeing involves walking long distances on snow.

Options B, C, and D are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy qd ysa'ed almtzljyn fi almnatq alryfyh aldyn yrghbwn fi alwswl ela sr'eat a3la?","The correct answer is **D: masarat mu3adda (prepared paths)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""fina dhil adhuruf al-jayida, satakunu qad qat'a masafat kabira ila 7addin ma mina almashy - wa lakin nadharan ma satatamatta3 bi-sur3at attazalluj arrify bidun 7aqibat dhahr thaqila fi masarat mu3adda.""

Translation: ""Under favorable conditions, you will have covered a large distance similar to walking - but regardless, you will enjoy a fast skiing speed without a heavy backpack on prepared paths.""

This indicates that prepared paths are key to achieving faster skiing speeds without the burden of a heavy backpack. The text implies that skiers can achieve a faster speed *on prepared paths*.
"
ywajh almsafrwn aldyn y'eanwn mn sdmh al'ewdh s'ewbh fi f'el mada?,"The correct answer is **D: إعادة التكيف مع ثقافتهم الأصلية (re-adjusting to their original culture)**.

Here's why:

The question asks what travelers face *because* of the culture shock they experience. The text states: ""...أحيانًا يواجه المسافرون الذين لديهم وقت سهل في التكيف مع الثقافة الجديدة، صعوبات خاصة في إعادة التكيف مع ثقافتهم الأصلية."" (Sometimes travelers who have an easy time adapting to the new culture face special difficulties in re-adjusting to their original culture.)

Option D directly addresses this difficulty. The other options are related to the culture shock itself (adaptation to a new culture, patience and understanding), but not the specific difficulty travelers encounter *upon returning home*.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, qd tkwn sdmh al'ewdh s'ebh bshkl khas 3la ay nw'e mn almsafryn?","The correct answer is **A: almsafrwn aldyn 'eanwa mn sdmh thqafyh sy'eh bshkl khas** (Travelers who experienced a significant cultural shock).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""sadmat al-3awda bi sur3a akthar min assadma attaqafiyya (hunaka aqal min maralat shaher al-3asal), wa tastamirru li fatra atwal, wa yumkin an takun akthar shidda."" (The return shock is faster than the cultural shock (there is less than the honeymoon period), and it lasts longer, and it can be more intense).  This suggests that those who had a strong cultural shock are more likely to experience a difficult readjustment upon returning.

The text also highlights the difficulty of reintegrating with original customs after adapting to a new culture: ""indma safarta ila al-kharej li awwal marra, yakun al-ashkhas bi shakl mu7tamil saburin wa mutafahhimin, wadi3in bi i3tibarihim anna al-musafirin ya7tajun ila atta2aqlum fi balad jadid."" (When you travel abroad for the first time, people are likely to be patient and understanding, forgiving them because they consider travelers need to adapt to a new country). This implies that the people who experience the biggest cultural shock will find the return process hardest.



Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: almsafrwn aldyn tkyfwa bsr3eh athna' eqamthm fi alkharj** (Travelers who adapted quickly during their stay abroad): The text suggests the *opposite* - those who had a strong cultural shock are more prone to a difficult return. Quick adaptation would likely mean a smoother transition.
* **C: almsafrwn aldyn ma zalwa fi mrhlh shhr al'esl** (Travelers who are still in the honeymoon period): The text indicates that returning *before* reaching the honeymoon period (a quick adaptation) is more difficult.
* **D: almsafrwn bsbr aql** (Travelers with less patience): The text discusses the patience of *others* towards travelers returning, not the patience of the travelers themselves.



Therefore, option A aligns most closely with the information presented in the text."
"wefqaan llfqrh, ma aledy la yu3etebr nesyhh deqyeqh lel3zef alnaje7 3la al akkordyon?","The correct answer is **C: a7ers 3la derb addarajat al museqiyya ma3 ebeqa2 aleyd mesterkheyh**

Here's why:

The original text explicitly states: ""Ta2akkad min 2an takun yadika mustar5eya qader al 2emkan fil 3azef 3ala jami3 addarajat al museqiyya bi shakel sa7ee7 -7awel aydan alla taqum bi 7araka ghareba bi asabe3ek.""  This translates to: ""Make sure your hand is relaxed and capable of playing all musical notes correctly - also try not to make strange movements with your fingers.""

Option C directly reflects this instruction – focusing on the correct musical notes while keeping the hand relaxed.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ll 7osol 3ala sewt a3la, zed al8uwa alety tedghet bha 3la al-mafatyh** (To get a louder sound, increase the force with which you press on the keys) - The text advises *against* using excessive force.
*   **B: abeqِ al7araka gheyr aledrewreyh fi 7adha aladena lel7efaz 3la taqetk** (Maintain unnecessary movement in this area to conserve your energy) - This is actually a good point, and the original text supports keeping finger movements relaxed and unnecessary movements avoided.
*   **D: zed alser3a alety tusheghel bha alemnefakh 7osol 3ala 7ajem 2edafi** (Increase the speed with which you operate the bellows to get the desired volume) - The text mentions using the bellows to achieve the desired volume but doesn't state increasing speed is the key.

Therefore, option C is the best and most accurate reflection of the instructions given in the original text."
"3nd al3zef 3la al akkordyon, ayun mema yely seysa3edek 3la zeyadh alswet?","The correct answer is **B: mezyed men al8uwa (more power)**.

The text states: ""tathakkar annahu laysat hunak 7ajatan lina8r 3ala al-mafaty7 bi8uwa kabyra lil7u9wl 3ala mustawa 9awt e'9afy min al-biyanw."" This translates to ""Remember that there is no need to press the keys with great force to achieve a strong sound on the level of the piano's power.""

Then it says, ""Li-hul3a 3ala 7ajem 2edafi min 2alat al akkordyon, yumkenuka 2este5dam manfa5 ma3 mazed min al daghet aw assur3a."" This translates to ""To achieve my desired volume from the accordion, you can use a blower along with more pressure or faster.""

While faster playing *can* contribute to volume, the primary way to increase sound (power) is by applying more pressure to the keys. Option B directly addresses this.
"
lemaza tuqet3 7awaf al sura 3la al telfaz?,"The correct answer is **B: lky tughati al sura al shashah bi akmaliha** (To ensure the picture fills the screen completely).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Yusamma hadha al amr al khuruj 3an itar al shasha. 2ujriya dhalika lel ta2akud min anna al sura tughati al shashah bi akmaliha.""  This translates to: ""This matter is called exiting the screen frame. This is done to ensure that the picture fills the screen completely.""

Options A, C, and D are incorrect based on the provided text. The text doesn't mention allowing screen translation, simple conversion to other formats, or cutting the screen translation to be close to the bottom edge.
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay men almusheklat atalyh qd twajh almr2 3nd ta7wyel film ela tenseyq DVD?","The correct answer is **A: sura la tmla2 kamel alshashah** and **D: 7awaf maqtow3a**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""kullu ma tarah 3ala al telefizyon tamma qassuhu min a3la wa asfal wa min al jawaneb."" (Everything you see on television has been cut from the top, bottom, and sides.) This directly leads to the problem of the image not filling the entire screen (A) and the edges being cut off (D).

* **The text also mentions:** ""wa edha kana maqta3 al video yadom tarjamat shashah bi al qurb min al juz2 al sufliy lelghaya, fa innaha lan tazhar bil kamel."" (And if the video cut is long, the subtitles near the bottom will not appear completely.) This indirectly supports the issue of the screen not being fully utilized.

* **Options B and C are incorrect:** The text states the problem *is* the image not filling the screen, not that subtitles are only partially cut. It doesn't say the image *does* fill the screen.



"

The passage states: ""Sayashun aljeneral John Cadwalder hujuman mudhallilan dhidda al7amiya albritaniya fi Bordentown..."" which translates to ""General John Cadwalder will launch a feigned attack against the British encampment in Bordentown...""
"

The text states: ""muswadat maktuba bi khat alyad waq3aha ra2is al Congress John Hancock wa al amin al-3am 3ala bo3d bidh3 binayat ila matba3at John Dunlap."" This translates to: ""A handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and the Secretary of State was sent to John Dunlap's printing house.""

While John Hancock signed the draft, the question asks who *received* the signed draft and read it. The text says a copy was sent to George Washington, who read it to his troops. Therefore, the answer is George Washington.
"

The text states: ""nuskha ila London fi 10 Oghustus"" which translates to ""a copy arrived in London on August 10th.""

The text explicitly states: ""rijal assayid Stark mawaqi' 3ala tol aljidar fi attaraf ashamaly li mawqi3 almusta3mir."" which translates to ""The men of Mr. Stark occupied positions along the wall on the northern side of the colony's position.""
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, meta mad rejal Stark siyajhum?","The correct answer is **C: khelal almad almunkhafid** (During the low tide).

The text states: ""عندما فتح المندخفض فجوة على طول النهر الغامض على طول الشرق الشرقي من شبه الجزيرة، قاموا بسرعة بتوسيع السياج بجلد حجري قصير إلى شمال ينتهي عند حافة المياه على شاطئ صغير."" This translates to: ""When the low tide opened a gap along the muddy river along the eastern shore of the peninsula, they quickly expanded the fence with a short stone wall to the north ending at the water's edge on a small beach.""

Therefore, the wall was built *during* the low tide when the gap appeared.

The passage explicitly states: ""Tu3addu al mamalek aththlath wa7ida min akthar al 3usur damawiyya fi tari5 dawlat As-sinal-qadima..."" which translates to ""The Three Kingdoms period is considered one of the most bloody eras in the history of the ancient Chinese dynasty...""

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Fi mar7alat attir7al yasir jaysh annaml laylan..."" which translates to ""In the migration phase, the ant army travels at night...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: ykwn ladyhem makhzwen qelyel men al ta3am (They have a small food supply):** The text says ""yaqil alghidha2 almuta7 laha"" which means ""the available food becomes scarce for them.""  So they *don't* have a small food supply *during* the migration, but rather it's becoming scarce.
* **C: yeqwemwen b3mal a3eshash tetgheyr b3d 17 yawman (They build temporary dwellings that change after 17 days):**  The text says ""ya3mal sakinu almusta3mara khilal hadhihi almar7ala 3la insha2 masـakin mu2aqqata, tataghayar yawmiyyan"" which means ""The inhabitants of the colony build temporary dwellings during this phase, which change daily.""  This doesn't specify a 17-day period.
* **D: yesyrwon khelal annhar (They travel during the day):** The text directly contradicts this, stating they travel *at night*.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ay jemlh ta3kes bidqh 3adat alta3sheysh li musta3marat jaysh annaml khelal mar7alat attir7al?","The correct answer is **C: yegheyrewn ala3shash yawmeyaan** (They change their nests daily).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sakinu almusta3mara fi mar7alat attir7al waqtama yaqil alghidha2 almuta7 laha. Wa ya3mal sakinu almusta3mara khilal hadhihi almar7ala 3la insha2 masـakin mu2aqqata, **tataghayar yawmiyyan**.""  This translates to: ""The inhabitants of the colony, when food becomes scarce during the migration phase, build temporary dwellings, **which change daily**.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: yabnwn a3shash khelal al layel** (They build nests during the night): The text mentions building temporary dwellings, but doesn't specify *when* they build them. It says they build them when food is scarce.
*   **B: yesyerwen lemudat 17 yewmaan bidwon ta3sheysh** (They wander for 17 days without settling down): The text states they *do* settle down temporarily, building temporary dwellings.
*   **D: yestekhedmewn ala3shash zataha fi kamel mudet mar7ala** (They use the same nest throughout the entire duration of the phase): The text explicitly says they build *temporary* dwellings that change daily.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of the ants' living habits during the migration phase.



"
ayun mma yely swf yastemr 3la alrughem men wojwod isharat kharijiya?,"The correct answer is **C: assa3a albiologiya (the biological clock)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""الsa3a albiologiya hiya mudhabdhibat dhatiyat al istidama wa allaty satastamirru li fatra min rukub addarajat al7ur 7ata fi 7alat 3adam wujud isharat kharijiya.""  This translates to: ""The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that will continue for a period of free oscillation even in the absence of external signals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dawrat dakhiliya zatiya (internal intrinsic cycle):** While the biological clock *is* an internal intrinsic cycle, the passage specifically identifies the *biological clock* as the entity that continues to function.
* **B: tariqat attanzim altabi3y almuntazam (the natural regular way of regulation):** The passage states that the natural regulation is documented in many organisms, but doesn't say it will *continue* regardless of external signals.  It's more about the documented existence of regular cycles.
* **D: al-iqa3at almarsuda (observed rhythms):**  The passage mentions observed rhythms, but says they aren't *limited* to responding to external signals. It doesn't say they will continue regardless of external signals.

Therefore, only the biological clock is specifically identified as continuing even in the absence of external signals.



"
ay mustal7 yasf alaferad aledyen yuzherwon mutgheyrat li simat namatiya mu7addada?,"The correct answer is **D: mut3addidy alashkal**.

Here's why:

* **The question asks:** What term describes individuals exhibiting multiple variations of specific traits?
* **The text states:** ""fa sayakunun mut3addidy alashkal"" - which translates to ""then they will be polytypic"" or ""multiform.""
* **Polytypic (mut3addidy alashkal) refers to organisms displaying multiple forms or variations within a population.**

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **muwa7ady ashakl (monomorph):**  These are organisms with a single, uniform form. This is the opposite of what the question describes.
* **alka2inat al7aya (living creatures):** This is a very general term and doesn't describe specific variations within a population.
* **naw3 (species/type):** This refers to a distinct group of organisms with shared characteristics, not to variations within a group.



"
ayun mema yely hwa almustla7 alsa7i7 ll alka2inat al7aya alety tesheghel mintaqa mu3ayna?,"The correct answer is **B: alskan**.

Here's why:

* **Alskan (السكان)** translates to ""population"" or ""settlement."" The question asks what term refers to living organisms occupying a specific area.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Muwa7ady ashakl (مواحدي الشكل)** translates to ""unicular"" or ""monotypic."" This refers to a single, uniform species.
* **Naw3 (نوع)** translates to ""species"" or ""type.""  While related, it doesn't directly describe the *group* of organisms occupying a region.
* **Mut3addidy alashkal (متعددي الأشكال)** translates to ""polymorphic"" or ""multiform."" This refers to organisms exhibiting multiple forms or variations within a species.



The passage describes a group of organisms sharing a specific location, and ""alskan"" is the term that directly refers to the population living in a particular area.

ayun mema yely leys mithalan 3la alsiya7a alqa2ima 3ala attabi3a?,"The correct answer is **D: sayd al asmak bi aldbubh alsina3eyh (Fishing with artificial lures)**.

Here's why:

* **Ecotourism** is defined as tourism based on observing natural environments and wildlife. It emphasizes minimizing negative impacts and promoting conservation.

Let's analyze the options:

* **A: almashey ela shelal (Hiking to waterfalls)** - This is a typical ecotourism activity as it involves experiencing natural landscapes on foot.
* **B: taswir al7ayat albirriya (Wildlife photography)** - Directly aligns with ecotourism's focus on observing and appreciating wildlife.
* **C: ziyarat mat7af 3ulum (Visiting a science museum)** - While potentially educational, a general science museum isn't specifically focused on *natural* environments and wildlife in the same way as ecotourism.
* **D: sayd al asmak bi aldbubh alsina3eyh (Fishing with artificial lures)** - This activity is more akin to recreational fishing, which can sometimes be unsustainable and detrimental to fish populations and ecosystems.  The use of artificial lures can also be considered less aligned with a natural, observational approach to ecotourism.



Therefore, fishing with artificial lures is the least representative of ecotourism principles.



"

The text explicitly states: ""yatarabtu aljami3 bi tariqatin ma bi nizam naql ya3tamid 3ala assayarat alkhasa wa yad3amuha"" which translates to ""they all connect in some way through a transportation system based on private cars and supported by them.""

Therefore, the basis of the transport system described is private cars.
"

The text states: ""Al-iliktrunat laha shu7nat kahraba2iya saliba"" which translates to ""Electrons have a negative electric charge.""  Electrons are the particles that orbit the nucleus.
"

The text explicitly states: ""Tatakawwan annawat min naw3ayn mina aljusaymat - naytrunat wa prutunat."" which translates to ""The nucleus consists of two types of particles - neutrons and protons.""
"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun mema yely hew mithal 3la raqam thuna2y mukwan men khamsa ajza2?","The correct answer is **C: 10010**.

Here's why:

* **Binary numbers** are based on the digits 0 and 1.
* **The question asks for a binary number with five digits.**

Let's examine each option:

* **A: 1010** - This is a binary number with *four* digits.
* **B: 12001** - This is not a binary number because it contains the digit '2'. Binary only uses 0 and 1.
* **C: 10010** - This is a binary number with *five* digits (1, 0, 0, 1, 0).
* **D: 110101** - This is a binary number with *six* digits.

Therefore, only option C fulfills both conditions stated in the question.
"

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states that the *presence* of an audience *generally* changes the writing, because students are often the harshest critics of themselves. The paragraph emphasizes that writers of blogs strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.  Option B claims a *lack* of criticism, which is the opposite of what the paragraph describes.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

* **A: ta7sin fi qudrat al kitaba wa al qawa3id (improvement in writing ability and rules):**  The paragraph mentions that blogging encourages students to be more analytical and critical, which implies an improvement in writing skills.
* **C: edrak aws3 ll bi2a almu7yta bhem (broader awareness of the surrounding environment):** The paragraph states that blogging allows students to respond to online materials and identify their own perspectives, contributing to a broader awareness of the environment.
* **D: zeyadh alrghabh fi mwaselt att3allum (increased desire to continue learning):**  The paragraph states that blogging encourages students to continue learning by responding to internet materials.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""inna al-7aja ila itharat ihtimam aljumhur tulhimu attullab li yakunu adhkiya2 wa mumayazin (Toto, 2004)"" which translates to ""the need to arouse audience interest inspires students to be smarter and more distinguished."" This directly links the desire for audience attention to improved writing skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: al2setjabh alemtekrerh ll mawad 3la al internet (Responding to online materials):** While responding to online materials *can* improve skills, the text focuses more on the *audience* as the motivator, not specifically on the online materials themselves.
* **B: alraghabh almuli7a fi tajnub al2ntiqad (The strong desire to avoid criticism):**  The text mentions avoiding criticism as a potential benefit of blogs, but it doesn't portray it as the primary motivator for improving writing *skills*.
* **D: al7ajeh li-atta3awun (The need for cooperation):**  While cooperation can be a benefit of blogging, the text doesn't prioritize it as a key motivator for improving writing skills.



Therefore, the text most strongly emphasizes audience interest as the driving force behind students' efforts to improve their writing.

The text explicitly states that the asynchronous communication allows students to **send questions to teachers at any time** and expect a quick response, **replacing the need to wait for the next face-to-face meeting.**  Option B directly contradicts this, suggesting face-to-face access is available at any time, which isn't the benefit described.

Let's look at why the other options are benefits mentioned in the text:

*   **A: istikhdam al-internet ka mawred (using the internet as a resource):** The text mentions internet and the World Wide Web as a resource for students.
*   **C: sa3at 3amal marina (our working hours):** The text mentions limited time with flexible working hours.
*   **D: atta7akkum fi al watirat (control over the pace):** The text states that asynchronous communication allows students to control the pace of learning.



"
"wefqaan llfqrh, ayun men jawaneb alatesal gheyr alemtezamen atalyh leys marinan li ttullab?","The correct answer is **A: watirat at3alum (learning pace)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that the online learning method ""Yuti7 li ttullab alqudra 3ala al3amal wifqan li darajat taqaddumihim wa tta7akkum fi watirat alma3lumat atta3limiya.""  This translates to: ""It allows students the ability to work according to their level of progress and control the rate of educational information."" This indicates that the **learning pace** *is* flexible.

The text also mentions:

* **Sa3at al3amal (working hours):** ""Hunaka alqalil min alquyud azzamaniya ma3 imkaniyat sa3at 3amal marina."" - There are few time restrictions with the possibility of our working hours.  This implies flexibility in working hours.
* **Al mawad atta3limiya (educational materials):** ""Istikhdam al-internet wa shabakat alweb al3alamiya al3alamiya lil muta3allimin alwusul ila alma3lumat fi kul al-awqat."" - Using the internet and global web networks allows learners access to information at all times. This indicates flexible access to materials.
* **Istikhdam al-internet (use of the internet):**  Already mentioned above as being flexible for accessing information.

Therefore, the only option that is *not* presented as flexible is **learning pace (watirat at3alum)**, because the text states students *control* the rate of information.

ma aledy leys medkewraan fi alfqrh ka she2 qed yerbuth almr2 ma3 qala3 al 3usur al wusta?,"The best answer is **A: 7ufar alzinzana (Dungeons)**. Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes sensory experiences related to the castle ruins:** It mentions hearing the sounds of battles, smelling the scent of fear emanating from the dungeons. This suggests the dungeons are a particularly potent and enduring element of the castle's atmosphere.
* **The passage asks about the basis of our imagination regarding medieval castles:**  The dungeons are a common and often terrifying feature of castles, readily inspiring stories and imagination.
* **The other options are more general:** While battles, chivalry, and knights are associated with castles, the passage doesn't specifically highlight their lasting impact on our imagination *in the same sensory way as the dungeons*.

Therefore, the dungeons are the most specific and evocative element mentioned in the passage that could be linked to our imagination of medieval castles.

This directly supports option D, which says the castle was built to withstand long and intense attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: talb Lord Hastings judran al qal3ah alsamykh** (Lord Hastings requested the castle's thick walls) - While Lord Hastings *did* initiate rebuilding, the text focuses on the existing walls' strength, not a request for thicker ones.
*   **B: a7tajet al7ad aladena men alet7syn bisbab teby3eh aleblad alhad2eh fi weqt alebna2** (The castle needed significant improvement due to the country's peacefulness during the construction period)- The text says the country was *relatively peaceful* during Hastings' construction, and defense was still necessary. It does *not* state the castle needed improvement *because* of the peacefulness.
*   **C: lm ykn bena2 al qal3ah mu3tadan li tlek al fatra al zamanyh** (The castle's construction wasn't common for that time period) - The text explicitly states the castle *was* built during that time period.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the large glazed windows were *not* a typical feature for a castle like Kirby Muxloe during the described period. It highlights the strength of the walls and the defensive measures, implying the windows were an unusual and potentially vulnerable element.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: asas mabney let7amul alhajmat (foundation built to withstand attacks):** The passage describes the strong walls as capable of withstanding attacks, implying a solid foundation.
*   **C: t7syenat aqel men b3d alqila3 (improvements after the castle):** The passage doesn't mention improvements after the original construction.
*   **D: judran ra8y8a (thick walls):** The passage explicitly praises the thick walls for their defensive capabilities.

This translates to: ""Running competitions across the country take place during the winter season, in addition to physical exercises for the upper part of the body are the best preparation for the running season.""

Therefore, the text emphasizes strength training for the upper body as crucial preparation.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: aletderb 3la 3bwr albelad jeryaan fi alsyef** (Training to run across the country during summer): The text says winter is the best time for long-distance running.

*   **C: f3elha fi aqel men thelath deqa2eq** (Doing it in less than three minutes): This refers to the speed of running, and the text emphasizes endurance over speed.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that as the distance decreases (from 1/4 mile to 1/2 mile), speed becomes less important and endurance becomes paramount. It explicitly states: ""bi attab3 yajib 2an yatamata3 al3adda2 min addaraja al 2ula, arrajul alladhi yumkinuh attaghalub 3ala arraqam al-qiyasi almutamathil fi daqiqatayn, bi qadrin la ba2sa bihi min assur3a, wa lakin yajib saql alqudra 3ala atta7amul fi jami3 almakhatir.""  This translates to: ""Naturally, the runner from the first level must possess the ability to overcome the standard times in two minutes, with a speed that is acceptable, but it is necessary to focus on the ability to endure all dangers.""

Option B directly reflects this emphasis on endurance (""saql alqudra 3ala atta7amul""). While speed is mentioned, the text prioritizes the ability to withstand challenges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aletderb 3la 3bwr alebled jeryaan khelal aِshher alesheta'** (training to run across the country during the winter month): While running across the country might be part of preparation, the text focuses on the specific endurance needed for shorter distances.

* **D: seql alser3a 3 hesab aleqderh 3ala aletheml** (focusing on speed at the expense of endurance): This is the opposite of what the text advocates.

* **The provided text states:** ""La yumkin lil mumarasat alghidha2iya assalima wa7daha 2an tuwallida 2ada2an mutamayizan..."" which translates to ""Safe nutritional practices alone cannot produce excellent performance...""

The text emphasizes that while good nutrition is important, it's not the *only* factor.  Excellent performance requires more than just good diet.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: thesyen alada' (improving performance):**  Nutrition *can* improve performance, but the text suggests it's not enough *on its own* for *excellent* performance.
* **B: zeyadh aletmet' (increasing enjoyment):**  Good nutrition can contribute to enjoyment, but the text doesn't primarily focus on enjoyment.
* **D: aleshh al3amh (generally):** This is too vague and doesn't address the specific aspect of performance.



Therefore, the answer that best aligns with the text's emphasis is **C: ada' memtaz**.  The text implies that excellent performance needs other factors beyond just nutrition.

Let's analyze each option:

* **A: memaresh aletghedyh alemnasebh (Following a balanced diet):** The text explicitly states that a healthy nutritional plan alone can't produce excellent performance, but it *can* significantly impact the health of young athletes.  It also mentions it helps maintain energy balance and develop healthy habits.  This is a positive factor for enjoyment.

* **B: teqdeym ada' 3ala mestewa memtaz basetmerar (Performing at an excellent level consistently):**  The text mentions that a healthy diet *can* help improve performance. Consistent excellent performance would undoubtedly contribute to enjoyment.

* **C: aletretyeb alef'eal (Genuine organization):** The text states that a healthy diet helps develop ""healthy habits"" and understand the various aspects of athletic training. This implies organization is beneficial.

* **D: al7efaz 3la tewazen shey leltaqh (Maintaining a balanced lifestyle in general):** The text explicitly mentions that a healthy diet helps maintain energy balance.  Maintaining a balanced lifestyle, including diet, is connected to enjoying the sport.

Since all options seem to be related to a healthy lifestyle or athletic development, let's re-read the question very carefully. The question asks what is *NOT* suggested. There might be a nuance I'm missing.

Upon closer examination, the text **doesn't directly link maintaining a balanced lifestyle to enjoyment**. While it's healthy and supports performance, the text is more focused on the nutritional aspects contributing to health and performance, not necessarily directly to enjoyment of the sport itself.

Therefore, the most likely answer is **D: al7efaz 3la tewazen shey leltaqh (Maintaining a balanced lifestyle in general)**, as it's the least directly related to the explicit mention of enjoyment in the text.

This translates to: ""Athletes may feel that they prefer a product even when it doesn't provide real benefits.""  This is driven by personal preference, not necessarily by the product's effectiveness or cost.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: lha fwa2ed muthebth (it has proven benefits):** The text says many misconceptions exist about what's needed, implying that the perceived benefits might not be accurate.
* **C: sewf tuhesn men ada'ehem beshekl kebyer (it will greatly improve their performance):**  The text contradicts this, saying they might feel they prefer a product even if it doesn't provide real benefits.
* **D: henak mefaheym khat'eh alety theyt balema3edat alaqel teklefh (there are false misconceptions that they are led to believe about the less expensive equipment):** While misconceptions exist, the text focuses on the athlete's *feeling* of preference, regardless of whether the misconception is true or not.

This translates to: ""Products can be purchased according to need, but most of them will have little or no impact on the results.""  And later: ""it's a moderate distance sport that is relatively inexpensive; and with that, there are many misconceptions about the few basic pieces of equipment required to participate.""

Therefore, the key takeaway is that you don't need a lot of equipment; a few basic pieces are sufficient. Options A (many equipment) and B (a strong established athletic background) are incorrect. Option D (many exercises) isn't directly supported by the text's main point.

Translation: ""...understanding the intentions of others is a very important matter. It allows us to resolve the potential ambiguity in physical actions.""

This means that understanding the intentions of others is *necessary* to interpret their physical actions. The passage implies that we *must* understand their intentions to correctly interpret what they are doing. Therefore, ""alerghebh"" (necessary) best fits the context.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alenyh** (unnecessary): The passage explicitly says it *is* necessary.
* **C: aleyeman** (rightly): While understanding intentions can lead to a right interpretation, the passage focuses on the *need* for understanding, not solely on achieving a right interpretation.

This directly connects understanding intentions to reducing uncertainty about what someone is doing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

This translates to: ""There is no longer pressure for individual recall, but the ability to remember people has become more focused.""  The passage also mentions a fundamental change in the way learning and knowledge are disseminated.

The core implication of these changes is a shift from individual knowledge acquisition and recall to a more interconnected system of knowledge exchange.  The mention of a ""fundamental change in the way learning and knowledge are disseminated"" points directly to the increased importance of sharing and circulating knowledge.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: eqamh shebkat ala'emal (maintaining work networks)**: This directly relates to maintaining professional relationships, which aligns with ""continuous relationships.""
* **B: alebqa' 3la tewasel ma3 al'ea'elh (staying in touch with family)**: This is a prime example of maintaining personal relationships, directly aligning with ""continuous relationships"" and ""personal sharing.""
* **C: alebheth lelsefr (searching for travel)**: While the internet *can* be used for travel planning, it doesn't inherently represent the *maintenance of existing relationships* or *personal sharing* that the passage highlights.  It's more about individual interest.
* **D: meqabelh ashekhas jedd (meeting new people)**:  This relates to forming new connections, which aligns with the potential for ""personal sharing"" and ""continuous relationships"" through online interactions.



Therefore, searching for travel is the option that *least* reflects the concepts of maintaining existing relationships or personal sharing as discussed in the passage.

Here's why:

The original text discusses factors motivating internet use related to personal engagement. It mentions ""personal participation"" and ""continuous relationships."" Let's look at the options:

* **A: alebheth 3an wesfh** (searching for a description): This could be a form of personal exploration and engagement.
* **B: alensher 3la lewhh menaqeshh 3la alenetrent** (posting on a discussion board on the internet):  Directly relates to sharing and interaction, a form of personal participation.
* **C: alebheth 3an mentejat aler'eayh alsa7i7** (searching for correct products of research): This is about academic/professional research and doesn't inherently focus on *personal* engagement or relationships. It's more about information gathering for a specific purpose.
* **D: edarh alesh'ewen alemaleyh** (managing personal finances): While potentially done online, this isn't primarily about social interaction or personal relationships fostered by the internet.

Therefore, searching for correct products of research is the least likely option to reflect internet use for personal engagement and building relationships, as discussed in the text.

(And among the major developments at that time - as a result of the crusades - people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.) This development occurred as the Western Europe was beginning to shape its distinctive style.
* The text also mentions that Western trends could be delayed by 25-30 years due to communication channels.  The ""close of the Middle Ages"" is a reasonable timeframe for this delay and the subsequent emergence of a unique style.
* Option B (during the Byzantine period) is too early.
* Option C (about 25-30 years after the Middle Ages) is not directly supported by the text, although the delay is mentioned.
* Option D (during the 12th century) is too specific and doesn't encompass the overall timeframe described in the text.

Here's why:

* The text emphasizes that we can live in more harmony with nature and join the environmental movement. This hinges on increased awareness and concern.
* It compares addressing environmental problems to treating a disease – you need to understand the root cause.  Increased awareness is the first step to understanding the root cause.
* The passage explicitly states that the world has changed due to scientific and technological advancements, leading to bigger problems.  This implicitly suggests a need for a shift in how people perceive and interact with the environment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: meqat'eh kheyarat nemt alheyah alemterf** (cutting off advanced life options): This is a vague and unrelated option.
* **B: alenshateyh** (activities): While activities are part of the solution, they are not the *fundamental* and *long-term* answer to the problems. Awareness is a prerequisite for effective activity.
* **C: thedyed sebb alemsheklat** (the cause of the problems): This is simply restating the problem and not a solution.



Therefore, increased public awareness is presented as a crucial foundation for finding and solving the environmental problems discussed in the text.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Hadha al2amr yushbihu tmaman 3ilaj maradh mas7ub bi a3radh fi al3adid mina al7alat."" This translates to ""This matter is exactly like treating a disease accompanied by symptoms in many cases.""  The analogy is to treat the root cause of the illness, not just the symptoms.

* **Options A, B, and D** all relate to addressing the root cause or symptoms of environmental problems:
    * **A: alanekherat fi alenshateyh (Reducing activities)** relates to lessening the environmental impact.
    * **B: t'eteyl alasebab alejderyh lelmesheklat (Identifying the underlying causes of the problems)** directly addresses the root cause.
    * **D: al'eyesh betreyqh akether sedyeqh lelbey'eh (Living in a more environmentally friendly way)** is also about mitigating the impact.

* **Option C** focuses on personal career decisions, which are unrelated to addressing the core environmental problem. It's about choosing a path in life, not about fixing the issues affecting the planet.

Therefore, choosing among professional life choices is the option that *doesn't* represent treating the root cause of environmental problems.

Here's why:

The passage highlights a contradiction: the Catholic Church amassed immense wealth and power while preaching about using wealth to alleviate suffering and poverty. This raises questions about whether the Church truly adhered to its own core principles.

Option D directly addresses this contradiction. If the Church's actions were aligned with the *principles of its own faith*, then the claim that it was deceiving people would be false.  The passage implies that there's a disconnect between the preached principles and the actual behavior, suggesting a potential deception.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: eda kan tewzey' aletherwh demn alekneysh menasebaan** (if the distribution of wealth from the Church was appropriate): While distribution is relevant, the core issue is whether the accumulation itself was consistent with the Church's tenets. Appropriate distribution doesn't negate the underlying concern about the acquisition of vast wealth.
* **B: eda kan yejb t'edeyl mettelbat 'eqeydh aledyanh** (if it was necessary to change the religious principles): The passage doesn't suggest the principles themselves were wrong, only that they weren't consistently applied.
* **C: terkeyz alesleth demn alekneysh** (the focus of the Church): The passage isn't directly questioning the Church's focus, but rather the *application* of its focus.



Therefore, option D is the most accurate response because it pinpoints the crucial question of whether the Church's actions were consistent with its own declared beliefs, which is the heart of the passage's implied critique."

The text explicitly states the crowd *forced* the King and Queen to open the windows of their carriage *on the way to Paris*.  While they *were* compelled to leave Versailles and they experienced the horrifying scene of the head on a pike, the text doesn't say they were forced to return to Paris.  The context is about their flight *to* Paris.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: feth newafed seyarethem (open the windows of their carriage):** The text states they were forced to do this.
* **B: alekherwej alemfaj' men Versailles (the sudden exit from Versailles):** The text states they were forced to leave Versailles.
* **C: meshahedh qet' ras hares (witnessing the decapitation of a guard):** The text explicitly describes this horrifying event.



Therefore, only the return journey to Paris is not mentioned as something they were forced to do by the crowd.

The passage doesn't state that the *law itself* changed as a result of Britain's actions.

Let's look at why the other options *were* consequences:

*   **A: reghebh alemaneya fi tetbeyq tekteyk herbey meshabh** (Germany's desire to apply a similar naval warfare tactic): The text says Germany expected a similar response to the unrestricted submarine warfare.  This implies a desire to replicate Britain's tactics.
*   **B: wud'et sefn gheyr mesharekh fi merma alekhetr** (neutral ships were placed in danger): The mine-laying in international waters directly endangered neutral ships.
*   **D: t'eder alewsewl ela alemedadat alhamh** (the ability to reach the home islands): The blockade aimed to cut off Germany's supply lines, making it harder to reach its home islands.



Therefore, the only consequence *not* mentioned in the text is a change to international law."

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kan mekhalefaan lelqanewn aledwely** (was contrary to international law) - While true, this describes the *violation* of the blockade, not the blockade itself. The question asks what the blockade *was*.
* **B: def' herb ghewasat alemaneya** (defending the German submarine war) - The passage describes Britain's actions, not Germany's submarine war.

Let's look at why the other options are less correct:

* **B: alaqetrab men aledheyh (approaching him):** The text says to *observe* while approaching, not to immediately approach.
* **C: fhes wed'eyh aledheyh (examining his condition):**  While examining the condition is important, the text emphasizes *observing* first.

*   **D: hawel melahezh ay ma3esherat khetr (Try to notice any risky behaviors).** This can be relevant to long-term health and prevention, but isn't a direct reflection of the *immediate* results of a health checkup. It's more about future risk factors.

(Also, after the revolution, professions were open to all advanced men from it, which allowed the most ambitious and outstanding to succeed.)

This directly reflects a shift away from the traditional emphasis on social class (the *beqah*, or class) and towards merit and ability (*al-kafa'ah*, or competence/merit).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: azedyad aled'em lelamh** (an increase in support for the monarchy): The French Revolution *overthrew* the monarchy, so this is the opposite of what happened.
* **C: tebney alayedyewlewjeyh alejmhewreyh** (the building of democratic ideologies):  While the revolution did contribute to democratic ideals, the passage focuses more on the practical shift in how people were judged for opportunities.  The construction of democratic ideologies is a broader concept.

ay khedmh 3amh yuqal anha alakether tesbebaan balasetya' fi alebledan alemteqdemh?,"Let's analyze the Arabic text and the question to understand the connection and find the correct answer.

**Understanding the Arabic Text:**

The text describes a common problem in society: transportation systems (anzimat annaql). People generally complain about them.  It contrasts this with developed countries where complaints are less about transportation quality and more about issues like water quality or collapsing bridges. The text then asks *why* transportation systems are plagued by such complaints and why they fail so frequently daily. It ends by questioning whether transportation engineers are inadequate or if there's a deeper, more fundamental issue at play.

**Understanding the Question:**

The question asks which public service in developed countries is reported to cause the most problems.

**Connecting the Text and the Question:**

The Arabic text highlights that *transportation systems* are a significant source of complaints and failures *in many countries*. It then contrasts this with developed countries where the issues are different.  The question asks which public service in developed countries is the *biggest* problem.

**Analyzing the Options:**

*   **A: jewdh alemyah (Water Quality):** While water quality is a concern, the text explicitly states developed countries have *fewer* complaints about water quality compared to transportation.
*   **B: bena' alejsewr (Bridge Construction):** Bridge construction issues are mentioned as a contrast to transportation problems in the text. It's a potential problem, but not necessarily the biggest.
*   **C: alenqel al3am (Public Transportation):** This is *exactly* what the Arabic text focuses on as a major source of problems. The text uses the example of complaints about public transportation systems in many countries.
*   **D: alta3lem (Education):** Education is not mentioned in the Arabic text.

**Conclusion:**

Based on the text's emphasis on public transportation issues and the contrast with problems in developed countries, the correct answer is **C: alenqel al3am (Public Transportation)**.  The question is phrased to ask about problems in developed countries, but the text uses a comparison with developed countries to highlight the severity of transportation problems *generally*. Therefore, public transportation is the best fit.



**Therefore, the correct answer is C.**"

Here's why:

The Arabic text states:

* ""Alkullu yusharik fi almujtama3 wa yastakhdimu anzimat annaql."" (Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems.)
* ""yashtaki aljami3 taqriban min anzimat annaql."" (Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.)
* ""Nadran ma tasma3 fil buldan almutaqadima mustawayat mumathila min ashakawa 7awla jawdat almiyah aw aljusur almutasaqita."" (It's rare to hear similar complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges in developed countries.)

This clearly indicates widespread complaints about transportation systems, which is exactly what option C states.  The text implies that this is a significant issue affecting a large portion of the population.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yhebha jami3 men yestekhedmha (Everyone loves it):** This is the opposite of what the text says. The text highlights widespread complaints.
* **B: leyset benfes sew' jewdh alemyah (It's not inherently a problem with water quality):** While the text *mentions* the lack of complaints about water quality in developed countries, it doesn't say that transportation problems are *related* to water quality.  The main point is the complaints about transportation itself.
* **D: hey mejaneyh fi aghelb aledwel alemteqdemh (It's mostly free in most developed countries):**  The text doesn't mention the cost of transportation in any country.  It focuses on the complaints people have about it.

This translates to: ""For the sake of accuracy, the study of traffic flow is considered a difficult task because it is not possible to predict the behavior of drivers with 100% accuracy.""

Therefore, the difficulty in accurately measuring traffic flow stems from the unpredictable behavior of drivers.  The other options are related to traffic, but not directly tied to the unpredictability of drivers:

* **A: ser'eh 7erkh alesyer (car exit speed):** While speed is a factor in traffic, the unpredictability of drivers is the core difficulty in accurately measuring the overall traffic flow.
* **B: tekhetyet aletreq (road width):**  Road width is a physical characteristic of the road, not related to driver behavior.
* **C: teshegheyl aletreq (road operation):** This is a general term and doesn't directly address the difficulty caused by unpredictable drivers.

This translates to: ""To represent traffic flow for a better outcome, a relationship was established between the three main characteristics: (1) traffic flow, (2) density, (3) speed. This relationship helps in **planning and designing road facilities**.""

Therefore, road design is a key application of mathematically modeling traffic flow.  The other options are related but not as directly linked to *mathematically representing* traffic flow:

* **A: تشغيل الطرق (operation of roads)** - This is a consequence of good design, not the modeling itself.
* **B: سلويك الـسائق (driver's safety)** - While related to traffic flow, the text doesn't directly connect safety to mathematical representation.

It also emphasizes the role of the genetic material (""ahammiyat qit3an almada alwirathiya almuta2athira"" - the importance of the affected segments of the hereditary genome).

Option B directly addresses the influence of the inherited genetic material, which is central to understanding how mutations are passed down and their consequences.  The other options are relevant but less fundamental:

*   **C: new' aletferh (The type of mutation):** The type of mutation certainly matters, but the question asks *what determines the capacity for transmission*, and the genetic material is the core factor.
*   **D: eda kanet aletferh qaderh 3la aletsebb fi mewt alekhelaya (If the mutation is capable of causing cell death):** Cell death is a consequence of mutations, not a determinant of their transmissibility.

Therefore, the importance of the inherited genetic material (B) is the most direct and accurate answer to the question.

"bena'an 3la alema3elewmat alewaredh fi alfqrh, ma aledy la t'etemd 3aleh tatheyrat aletferat alemkhetlefh?","The correct answer is **C: ahemyh alemadh alewratheyh alemtatherh (importance of the affected genetic segments)**.

Here's why:

The original text states: ""Yumkinu 2an tatasabbaba attafarat fi mawt alkhlaya aw assratan fi amakin ukhra min aljism. **Yumkin faqt naql attafrat fi khalaya alkhat aljurthumy ila al-atfal, wa ahammiyat qit3an almada alwirathiya almuta2athira**...""  This directly links the importance of the affected genetic segments (""ahammiyat qit3an almada alwirathiya almuta2athira"") to the potential for the mutation to be passed down and to cause cellular effects.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: meqdar alemadh alewratheyh alemtatherh (amount of the affected genetic material):**  While the amount of genetic material might be relevant, the text focuses on the *importance* of the specific segments affected, not just their quantity.
* **B: eda kanet alekhelaya alemtatherh fi alekhet alenetashey (if the affected cells are in the germline):**  The text *does* mention the germline, but the primary emphasis is on the *importance* of the affected segments, regardless of cell location.  The passage also states that mutations in non-germline cells can cause cell death or other effects.
* **D: new' aletferh alemtatherh (type of the affected mutation):** The text mentions the *type* of mutation (different types of mutations), but it highlights the *importance* of the affected segments as a key factor.



Therefore, option C best reflects the information presented in the text regarding the factors influencing the impact of mutations.

Therefore, the primary goal of an experiment is to disprove or reject hypotheses. The other options are related but not the *primary* goal. Experiments *can* reveal the path of scientific inquiry (B), *can* lead to questions (C), and *can* guide scientific research (D), but the core function is hypothesis testing.

The text explicitly states: ""Wa ma3a dhalik fa inna ijra2 attajarib wa7dahu la yakfi...tar7 alas2ila, kama anna ibda2 almula7azat yuwajih alba7th al3ilmy kadhalik.""  This translates to: ""And however, conducting experiments alone is not enough...raising questions, as well as making observations, also guides scientific research.""

Therefore, the text implies that relying *only* on the scientific method (which encompasses more than just experiments) is insufficient. It specifically highlights that observations and asking questions are also crucial.  Option A, ""alemnhej al'elemy lewhedh"" (the scientific method alone), is the only option that reflects this idea.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay jemlh 7wl ala'easeyr leyset sheyhh?","The correct answer is **D: yemken lesr'eh aleryah fi b3d ala'easeyr an tesl ela 300 meyl fi alesa'eh** (The wind speed in some storms can reach 300 miles per hour).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Tasil sur3at hadhihi al3awasif al3anifa ila 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph).""  This means the *maximum* wind speed is 480 km/h or 300 mph.
* **Option D says:** ""yemken lesr'eh aleryah fi b3d ala'easeyr an tesl ela 300 meyl fi alesa'eh"" (wind speed in some storms can reach 300 miles per hour). This is a *lower* speed than the maximum mentioned in the passage. Therefore, it's not entirely accurate according to the text.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate:

* **A: ala'easeyr qaderh 3la tedmeyr alakhedr waleyabes fi mhetyha** (Storms are capable of destroying vegetation and land in their path): This is directly stated in the passage: ""Tasil sur3at hadhihi al3awasif al3anifa ila 480 km/h (133 m/s; 300 mph). ala'easeyr qaderh 3la tedmeyr alakhedr waleyabes fi mhetyha"" (These violent storms can reach 480 km/h... Storms are capable of destroying vegetation and land in their path).
* **B: tedreb ala'easeyr menateq mhedwedh meqarenh bal'ewasef alakhera** (Storms hit limited areas compared to other storms): The passage states: ""Biyab'ath ala'easeyr sur'eh aleryah lakether lakether. Biyab'ath ala'easeyr sur'eh aleryah lakether lakether men ala'ewasef alakhera."" (Storms send wind speeds... much more than other storms). This implies they are more concentrated or limited in their impact area.
* **C: Biyab'ath ala'easeyr sur'eh aleryah lakether lakether men ala'ewasef alakhera.** (Storms send wind speed much more than other storms.) This is correct and stated in the text.

Therefore, Option D is the only one that is *not* entirely accurate, making it the answer to the question."

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Taqtali3 al-a3asyr al-ashjar"" which translates to ""It uproots trees"". Option D directly reflects this.
* **Option A** is incorrect because the passage says the storm lasts *more than* three hours, not that it *does* last three hours.
* **Option B** is true, but it doesn't describe the destructive power as effectively as option D. While wind speed is high, the passage emphasizes the uprooting of trees.
* **Option C** is incorrect because the passage states the storm is *smaller* in comparison to other severe storms.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate description of the storm's destructive capabilities based on the provided text."

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes Muhammad's inclination towards solitude and a detachment from worldly affairs.** The description of Hira Cave highlights its isolation and the feeling of complete seclusion experienced within.
* **The passage mentions Muhammad's tendency towards contemplation and his longing to engage with the cosmos.** This suggests a need for quiet reflection.
* **Option C directly reflects this need for solitude and time alone for contemplation.**

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: hew yeqder aleslam wal'euzelh (he appreciates Islam and solitude).** While the passage describes solitude, it doesn't explicitly state Muhammad's appreciation *of Islam*. It focuses on his personal inclination towards contemplation.
* **B: yemken leldejyej alekharejy an yusa'ed fi aletfekr (other people can help in thinking).** The passage describes a state of *internal* reflection.  It's more about the individual needing time alone, not external help.
* **D: kan yetweq leky yura weyusema3 (he longed to see and hear).**  The passage directly contradicts this. The cave offers very limited visibility and hearing. It emphasizes sensory deprivation, not a desire for sensory input.



Therefore, **C** is the most accurate answer based on the provided text."
"wefqaan llfqrh, lemaza asetkhedm alhedyed awelaan?","The correct answer is **C: al-ajalat (the wheels)**.

This indicates that the iron wheels *caused* more wear on the wooden ones. Therefore, the wooden wheels weren't able to handle the wear and tear effectively.  The final sentence says: ""fi 3am 1767, tamma istibdal al3ajalat alkhashbiya bi 3ajlat 7adidiya."" (In 1767, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels). The implied reason for the replacement is that the iron wheels could handle the wear and tear better.  Option C directly reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: lanha zadet ser'eh alahesnh** (Because it increased its speed). The text doesn't mention speed as a factor.
* **B: kanet tu'etebr akether f'ealeyh** (It was considered more durable). While durability is a factor, the text emphasizes the *wear and tear* on the wooden wheels, implying the iron wheels were *better at handling wear* rather than inherently more durable overall.
* **D: kanet tetakel besbeb alhedyed 3la alemsarat** (It was worn out because of the iron on the tracks). The text says the *iron on the carriage wheels* caused wear on the wooden wheels, not wear on the tracks themselves.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that a core idea of technological determinism is that technological development follows a path that transcends cultural and political influence. Option B directly contradicts this idea. The text emphasizes that technology *influences* societies, not the other way around.

Let's look at why the other options *do* reflect the core ideas of technological determinism:

* **A: tatheyrat aletkenwelwejya 3la alemjetma3 mukeyfh ajetma'eyaan (Technological changes in society how they organize themselves):** This reflects the idea that technology *determines* social organization and how societies function.
* **C: lelteknewlewjeya tatheyrat metaselh 3la alemjetma3 (For technology, changes are coupled in society):**  This aligns with the deterministic view that technological changes are inextricably linked to and shape societal changes.
* **D: alettewr aletkenwelwejy leys mebneyaan 3la aletatheyr alesyasey (Technological development is not based on political influence):**  This is a direct reflection of the core belief in technological determinism – that technology follows its own course, independent of political factors.

The passage explicitly states:

* **""Yaqsod bi kalemat 2a3la darorat 2an tabda2 min attaraf wa tadfa3 al qaws""** -  ""When using the word 'a3la' (upper), it means you must start from the tip and push the arc.""

Therefore, starting from the end of the arc (""alebd2 men nhayh aleqwes"") is the opposite of what the passage describes for the ""a3la"" arc. The other options are all mentioned in relation to the arc:

* **A: sewt akether n3wma (softer sound)** -  The upper arc generally produces a softer sound.
* **B: 3lamh tebdew methel aledbash (looks like a lightning bolt)** - The passage says the upper arc's symbol resembles a lightning bolt.
* **C: sewt aqewa (louder sound)** - The lower arc is generally louder.

This translates to: ""The chimpanzee's hand and foot are similar in size and strength, which reflects the use of the hand for carrying weight while walking using the fingers.""

The question asks what describes the chimpanzee's physical characteristics. The passage highlights the similarity in size and strength between their hands and feet.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: hey akether asetqamh men telk leda alebsher** (They are more upright than those of humans): The passage discusses the shift in hand use, not their upright posture compared to humans.

The passage describes how genetic diversity arises through the addition of new genetic variation and the removal of variation from a contrasting group by natural selection. It then states that **""alfasl wa i3adat attarkib"" (separation and recombination)** is responsible for exchanging variation between the two groups with each generation. Recombination is the process where genetic material is shuffled and rearranged during sexual reproduction.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: mestetrh (inherited)** - While variation *can* be inherited, recombination isn't the mechanism of inheritance itself.
*   **C: alefsel (separation)** - Separation is part of the process, but it's not the mechanism that *removes* variation and facilitates exchange.
*   **D: ma3eberh (expressive)** - Expressive variation refers to how genes are expressed, not the creation or exchange of genetic variation.

Therefore, **recombination** is the process mentioned in the text that facilitates the exchange of genetic variation between groups."
ay 3malyh hey alems'ewelh 3an edafh akhetlafat weratheyh?,"The correct answer is **A: alefsel (partition)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Ya3malu alfasl wa i3adat attarkib 3ala tabdil attabayun dhahaban wa iyaban bayna almajmu3atayn ma3a kulli jil.""  This translates to ""Partition and recombination operate on the exchange of variation back and forth between the two populations with each generation.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: e'eadh aletrekyeb (recombination):** Recombination is *part* of the process, but not the overarching answer to *how* genetic differences are added. It's a mechanism *within* the partitioning.
* **C: aletferh (mutation):** Mutation creates new variations, but the text focuses on the *division* and *exchange* of variations *between* populations. While mutation contributes to the raw material of genetic diversity, it isn't the primary driver of the described process.
* **D: ma3eberh (expression):** Expression refers to how genes are *used* to create traits. It's irrelevant to the creation and spread of genetic diversity between populations.



Therefore, **partition (alfsel)** is the most accurate answer, as it describes the fundamental action of separating populations and allowing genetic differences to accumulate and exchange.

(Often, members of a subculture indicate their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of a certain style, which includes vocabulary, behaviors, and dialects.)

Option D directly reflects this statement, focusing on the use of style as a form of symbolism to signal group affiliation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: عبر محاولات الاندماج (Eber muhawalat al-indmaj - Through attempts at integration):**  While some subcultures might *eventually* seek integration, the primary way they signal affiliation is through their distinct style, not through attempts to blend in.

*   **C: 3laqath ma3 alatefal alakheryen (relationship with other children)** - While stereotypes *could* affect relationships, the text focuses on academic performance based on internalizing stereotypes, not social interactions.
*   **D: t'ereyfh lel'ereq (their definition of race)** -  The text isn't about how a child defines race, but about how stereotypes *related to race* affect them.

Here's why:

The text describes ""wu7shy"" or ""mutawa7ish"" children (feral/wild children) as having difficulties with social interaction and exhibiting behaviors similar to animals. They are raised without human contact and lack the typical social skills.

* **A: al'eyesh beshekl mesteql (living independently)** - The text mentions some feral children living alone in the wilderness, so this aligns.
* **C: meywel an'ezaleyh (inclined to flee/avoid)** - The text states they exhibit fear of humans and avoid them, so this aligns.
* **D: aleqleq alajetma'ey (socially anxious)** - This is a reasonable inference from their lack of social skills and fear of humans, so it aligns.
* **B: mharat mhadethh qewyh (strong speaking skills)** -  The text doesn't mention strong speaking skills as a characteristic of feral children. In fact, due to their lack of human interaction, it's unlikely they would develop strong speaking skills. The focus is on their lack of *social* communication, not their linguistic ability.

Therefore, strong speaking skills are the *least* likely characteristic of a child raised as ""mutawa7ish"" according to the text.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that ""it is claimed that some feral children were abandoned by their parents due to severe intellectual or physical disabilities of the child."" This highlights a lack of social nurturing as a contributing factor.
* The text emphasizes that feral children exhibit behaviors ""similar to domestic animals,"" which directly relates to a lack of human socialization.
* Option A is incorrect because the text doesn't directly link feral behavior to physical disability. While it mentions disabilities *leading to abandonment*, it doesn't say the behavior *itself* stems from them.
* Option C is incorrect because the text indicates that abandonment is *a cause* of feral behavior, not a requirement.
* Option D is incorrect because the text points to a lack of social nurturing (intellectual or physical disabilities of parents) and not necessarily severe intellectual disabilities as *the sole* cause of feral behavior. It's about the *lack of social development*.

Here's why:

The text describes *Zira'at al-Kafaf* (subsistence farming) as a simple, often organic system focused on meeting the family's food needs using locally available resources and simple techniques to increase yields *enough*.  It's not about maximizing output for profit through modern technologies.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with *Zira'at al-Kafaf*:

* **A: aletrekyez 3la ghelh telbey hajat 'ea'elh alemzar' (Focusing on meeting the family's needs of the farmer):**  This aligns perfectly with the core principle of subsistence farming.
* **B: enetaj alet3am leby'eh lelakheryen (Producing crops for sale to others):** While subsistence farming is primarily for family consumption, some surplus *could* be sold, especially in developing countries, and wouldn't necessarily contradict the overall concept.
* **D: aletzewd balebdewr alemhelyh lemnetqh alemzar' (Providing local labor for the farmer):** This is also a common characteristic of subsistence farming, relying on family and local help.



Therefore, focusing on high yields through modern technologies is fundamentally *incompatible* with the simple, resource-conscious nature of *Zira'at al-Kafaf*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

This directly points to going to tourist destinations.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ghemr anefshem fi aletheqafh alemhelyh (immersing oneself in local culture):** While cultural immersion *can* be part of recreational travel, the text primarily focuses on the *change of scenery* as the core element.

Here's why:

The Arabic text explicitly states: ""Laqad qallalat qisas alnaja7 hadhihi min makhawif attaghyir, baynama khalaqat ittijahat ijabiya na7wa attaghyir fil mustaqbal."" (These success stories have reduced fears of change, while creating positive directions towards change in the future.)  The text directly connects sharing successful business models to alleviating fear of change.

While the other options are *also* mentioned as contributing factors, the text makes the strongest link between *successful business models* and reducing fear of change.  The core point is the impact of these examples on fostering openness to new changes and directions.



Therefore, option A best reflects the key message of the Arabic text regarding alleviating fear of change.

This directly aligns with option D, which says there is no single method in learning. The text emphasizes that learning happens through experience between the learner and the presented knowledge, and that many people watch educational programs without ever applying the knowledge. This highlights the lack of a single, definitive path to learning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: b3d aletjareb alta3lemeyh akether fa2edh men gheyrha (After educational experiences, it is better than others):** While experience is important, the text doesn't say it's *better* than other methods, just that it's a key part of the learning process.  The core message is about the absence of a singular best method.
* **B: yejb an yerkez alta3lem 3la alasheya2 alety n3eteqd anena sewf nekhetberha (Learning should focus on things we believe we will experience):** The text *contradicts* this.  It points out that people learn from programs even if they don't experience the subject matter directly.
* **C: b3d aletreq alta3lemeyh afedl men gheyrha (After educational methods, it is better than others):** This is the opposite of what the text states. It explicitly denies the existence of a single best educational method.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that learning is a process of experience between the learner and the presented knowledge. It highlights that many people watch educational programs without ever applying the knowledge.  The text *directly contradicts* the idea of prioritizing learning *after* educational experiences.  The point is that learning happens *through* experience, even if that experience doesn't lead to immediate application.

Let's look at why the other options are aligned with the text:

* **A: henak al3adid men aletreq let'eleym alema3elewmat (There are many ways to learn information):**  The text explicitly mentions television programs and other methods of learning, reinforcing the idea of diverse pathways.
* **C: t3tamed tejrebh t3eleymeyh 3la almut3alem wa al ma3erefh al mqedmh (An educational experience depends on the learner and the presented knowledge):** This is a central theme of the text. The learning process is shaped by the interaction between the learner and the information.
* **D: alema3erefh alety qed la netbeqha abedaan tebqa jedyerh bat3alam (Knowledge that we may never apply remains valuable in learning):** The text illustrates this point with examples of things people learn about (archaeology, home renovation) that they may never actually do. The value lies in the learning process itself.



Therefore, option B presents a viewpoint directly opposed to the core tenets expressed in the text about the nature of learning and experience.

The provided text discusses intentional awakenings *within* a normal sleep cycle.  The goal isn't to completely eliminate sleep, but to briefly interrupt it and then return to it. Option C directly reflects this: setting an alarm for 20 minutes and then returning to sleep.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: leqra'h lesa'eh wensef qebl al'ewedh ela alnawim:** Reading for an hour and a half before going back to sleep is not directly related to *intentional awakenings during* a sleep cycle.  It's more about trying to fall asleep.

* **Option D describes a goal related to *returning to sleep* after waking up, which is a separate concept from the methods outlined in the text.** The text doesn't offer advice on how to quickly fall back asleep after waking.

Let's look at why the other options *are* consistent with the text:

This translates to: ""With a *lower* number of rapid eye movements at night, these states in which you feel real sleep and your body rests become rare to the point where they become a problem.""

The passage goes on to explain that lucid dreaming is dependent on the brain *trying* to have lucid dreams each night.  To achieve this, the brain needs to cycle through REM sleep.  If the REM cycles are *spaced too closely together* (meaning the time between them is short), the feeling of real sleep and body rest becomes rare, leading to the problem described. Therefore, the time between REM cycles is what increases when the brain tries to increase the frequency of lucid dreams.



The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: kemyh halat 7erkh al'eyen alesrey'eh (The number of rapid eye movements):** The passage says the *number* of REM cycles is *lower*, not higher.
*   **B: mestewyat aletaqh (The level of arousal):** The passage doesn't directly link lucid dreaming frequency to arousal levels.
*   **C: tewl halh alet'eafey (The length of the sleep cycle):** The passage doesn't specifically discuss the length of the sleep cycle, just the frequency/spacing of REM cycles.

This translates to: ""With a *lower number of rapid eye movements at night*, these states in which you feel like you're actually sleeping and your body rests become rare to the point of becoming a problem.""

Therefore, a *decrease* in REM sleep (characterized by fewer rapid eye movements) is the cause of the problem described in the passage.  This leads to the vivid dreams being prolonged and exhausting.

Here's why:

The passage states that both traditional and non-traditional teams *subject themselves to the standards of differentiation* (يخضعون لمعايير التمييز التي يخضع لها الفرق التقليدية).  This implies an expectation of similar performance based on those standards.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

The rule helps determine an optimal placement for the main subject within the composition.  The intersection point is suggested as a good starting point. So, this *is* a goal.

*   **B: enesha' heyah wetaqh demn sewrh (Creating hierarchy and power within the image):** The text talks about maintaining a degree of order, and the placement at the intersection of dividing lines suggests a way to create a structured hierarchy within the image.  So, this *is* a goal.

*   **C: ebeqa' alemwedw' demn mekan mhedd wef'eal (Keeping the subject from a threatened place and acting):** This option doesn't directly relate to the Triad Rule as described in the text. The rule focuses on composition and placement, not on the subject's emotional state or ""threatened"" position. It is about *where* the subject is, not *how* it feels. Therefore, this option is *not* a goal.

*   **D: taseys nezam demn sewrh (Establishing order from the image):** This is a direct reflection of the text's statement about maintaining a degree of order within the composition. So, this *is* a goal.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: ebeqa' alemwedw' demn mekan mhedd wef'eal (Keeping the subject from a threatened place and acting)**. It's the only option that doesn't align with the described goals of the Triad Rule.

* **A: henak terkeyz 3la tejrebh halat alederak aleslemyh walembhejh** (There is a focus on the experience of a peaceful state of consciousness and joy) - This directly reflects the text's description of Sufism emphasizing states of peace, insight, happiness, and even ecstatic absorption.
* **B: ateba' aleswefyh yes'ewen lew'ey ederakey lheqyeqh rewhaneyh** (Sufis strive for a deeper understanding of spiritual truth) -  The text states Sufis aim for a deeper understanding of reality through personal experience.
* **C: qed yetbena ateba' aleswefyh memaresat tesa'ed fi t'ezeyz r'eyethem lelheqyeqh alelheyh** (Sufis may adopt practices that help strengthen their perception of spiritual truth) - This aligns with the text's statement that Sufis utilize practices to enhance their experience of spiritual reality.



Therefore, option D is the only one that accurately reflects a point *contrary* to the description of Sufism provided in the text.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that Sufism is distinguished by its emphasis on **personal, direct experience** of a state of consciousness. It mentions experiences like peace, insight, joy, and even ecstatic absorption. 

Option B, however, talks about shared and collective experiences. This is contrary to the Sufi focus on the individual's direct encounter with the divine.  The text emphasizes a solitary and personal journey towards understanding.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: ales'ey wera' alhedth ela alheqyeqh alelheyh** (focusing on the pursuit of truth itself): The text says Sufis strive to attain truth and understanding of the divine.
* **C: terkeyz 3la halh alederak alembhejh** (focus on the state of blissful awareness): The text highlights experiences of joy, bliss, and ecstatic absorption as key aspects of Sufism.
* **D: ales'ey ela ederak wa'ey lelelh** (focus on conscious awareness of God):  This is a core element of Sufism, as the text mentions a unique state of consciousness.

This translates to: ""Then the theory was established that the Maori people had migrated from Polynesia in a great voyage, and then took New Zealand from the Moriori and established an agricultural society there.""

Therefore, the Moriori, not the Maori, established the agricultural society in New Zealand.

"wefqaan llfqrh, alemjemw'eh alety asetadet alemwas kanewa aleskan alawa'el lay mewq'e?","The correct answer is **B: neywezyelneda (New Zealand)**.

While the text later discusses the Moriori and Chatham Islands, the initial belief was that the Maori were the earliest inhabitants of *New Zealand*. Therefore, the answer is B.

Here's why:

The description of the ""simple algorithm"" states it's designed for beginners with little or no experience and limited motor skills.  It only allows for one simple action at a time and no complex actions like reversals.  This suggests the algorithm is suitable for someone who is just starting to learn and needs something very basic.

* **A (almjled yefdel aleqyam b'edh teyat ma3eaan):**  Choosing specific actions doesn't necessarily relate to the algorithm's suitability for beginners.
* **B (almjled ledyh mharat herkeyh metqedmh):**  Someone with advanced motor skills wouldn't need a simple algorithm.
* **C (almjled yesn' aweryejamey tettelb teyat 'ekesyh):** The algorithm specifically *doesn't* allow for reversals, making this unsuitable.
* **D (almjled jerbha sabeqaan lemrh wahedh aw merteyn feqt):** This is the best fit because it aligns with the algorithm's intention to help beginners who haven't had much practice. It implies the person is still in the early stages of learning and could benefit from a very basic, manageable approach.



"

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states the simple pattern was developed to help **inexperienced or those with limited motor skills**. This directly contradicts option A.
* Options B, C, and D all align with the description of the simple pattern:
    * **B: aletreyqh la thetwey 3la teyat 'ekesyh (The method does not rely on mirror images)** - The text mentions no complex, mirrored patterns.
    * **C: yejb an yekwen lelteyat mewaq' mheddh (The patterns must have direct locations)** - The text says all patterns have direct locations.
    * **D: hey teryeqh jeydh lelmejledyen dewy alemharat alherkeyh alemhedwedh (It's a good technique for memorizers with limited motor skills)** -  This is a direct restatement of the purpose of the pattern.



Therefore, option A is the only one that is not a correct description of the simple pattern.

"wefqaan llfqrh, ay mewq' leys mertebtaan bhedarh wadey alesned?","The correct answer is **B: nher Sarasvati (Sarasvati River)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""على الرغم من أن بعض العلماء يتكهنون بانه نظراً لوجود الحضارات أيضاً في أحواض نهر الساراسوati الجاف حالياً، يجب أن يطلق عليها اسم حضارة Indus-Sarasvati..."" (Although some scientists speculate that due to the existence of civilizations also in the dry riverbeds of the Sarasvati River currently, it should be called the Indus-Sarasvati civilization...)

This indicates that while there may have been civilizations in the Sarasvati River basin, the Indus civilization is primarily associated with the Indus River (Wadey Assend).  The text suggests combining the names, but it doesn't claim the Sarasvati River *is* the Indus River.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related:

*   **A: Harappa:** The text explicitly mentions Harappa as one of the first sites excavated of the Indus civilization (""بعد Harappa، التي تعد أول مواقعها التي سيتم التنقيب عنها في عشرينيات القرن العشرين"").
*   **C: جمیع المناطق في شمال شرق أفغانستان (All regions in Northeast Afghanistan):** The text states the Indus civilization extended to this area (""تعد من بين الحضارات التي امتدت إلى أحواض نهر الساراسوati الجاف حالياً، ويجب أن يطلق عليها اسم حضارة Indus-Sarasvati"").
*   **D: معظم باكستان الحديثة (Most of modern Pakistan):** The text states that the Indus civilization spanned this region (""وتعد من بين الحضارات التي امتدت إلى أحواض نهر الساراسوati الجاف حالياً، ويجب أن يطلق عليها اسم حضارة Indus-Sarasvati"").

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions ""al-Harappan civilization"" as an alternative name for the Indus-Sarasvati civilization, referencing Harappa as one of its first discovered sites.  Therefore, it *is* mentioned.

The text also mentions:

*   **hedarh alesned wa Sarasvati (Indus and Sarasvati civilization)** - This is the primary name discussed.
*   **hedarh nher alesned (Indus River civilization)** - This is a descriptive term referring to the civilization's location.
*   **hedarh wadey alesned (Indus River Valley civilization)** - This is another descriptive term referring to the civilization's location.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""min tabi3at alta3awun annahu 3indama tastafid al aghlabiya sayakun hunaka da2man almazid min almakasib 3ala almada alqasir min khilal attasaruf bi ananiya"" which translates to ""It is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefit, there will always be more gain in the short term through selfish behavior.""

This directly supports option C, which describes a selfish approach to gain short-term benefits, even if it harms others.  The passage acknowledges this as a natural (though not necessarily optimal) tendency.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alt'eawen ma3 alakheryen** (Cooperation with others): The passage explicitly argues *against* solely relying on selfishness and advocates for cooperation for long-term benefit.
* **B: e'eta' alawelweyh lelmesalh aledateyh lelferd** (Prioritizing individual immediate interests): While the passage mentions selfish behavior, it contrasts that with long-term benefit through cooperation, so this isn't the main point.
* **D: ederak an alejsh' yemken an yekwen mefyedaan** (Realizing that the army can be beneficial):  The passage doesn't mention the army at all.

This translates to: ""And it is the nature of cooperation that when the majority benefit, there will always be more gain in the short term through **acting selfishly**.""

Therefore, if someone focuses on immediate benefits, they will tend towards selfishness, as described in the passage.  The passage directly links short-term gain with selfish behavior.

"wefqaan llfqrh, men gheta jez'aan kebyeraan men nefqat alherb?","The correct answer is **D: alesh'eb aleflebyeny (the Filipino people)**.

This translates to ""They were forced to pay debts to the American colonial regime, to bear a large part of the expenses and benefits **on the bonds that were floated in the name of the Philippine government**..."".

While the Philippine government is mentioned, the implication is that the **Filipino people** ultimately bore the brunt of the financial burden. The passage emphasizes that the Filipino people were forced to pay debts and bear expenses related to the war.

Here's why:

The text states that the High Middle Ages (the era of the Knights Templar, 1000-1300) *followed* the Early Middle Ages. Therefore, the Early Middle Ages came before the High Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: awakher al 3usur al wosta (Late Middle Ages):** This period is *after* the High Middle Ages.
*   **B: al qurun al thane 3ashar (12th Century):** This is a part of the High Middle Ages, not a period before it.

"

Here's why:

The text states that the High Middle Ages (the period of the Knights Templar) ended around 1300.  The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and continued until approximately 1500. Therefore, the late Middle Ages is the period that came after the High Middle Ages.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: al qurun al thane 3ashar (12th century):** This is a period *within* the High Middle Ages, not a period that came *after* it.
* **C: al 3usur al wosta al 3ulya (High Middle Ages):** This is the same period as the one described in the question.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions:

*   **""Kana lada al jarra7in ma3refa bil 3adid min al muhadde2at bima fi dhalik al morfin...""** (The surgeons had knowledge of many painkillers, including morphine...)

Morphine is a sedative. The passage also mentions using herbs like scopolamine. So, while the passage discusses pain management and some specific herbal remedies, it doesn't mention *sedatives* in general.  The question asks what treatment isn't mentioned. Sedatives used for spasms are not specifically mentioned, making option A the correct answer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: asetkhedam mestekhelsat men bedwer ala3eshab leskewbewlameyn** (Using extracts from herbs like scopolamine): This is mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: weqf tedfeq aledm bemshabek sheryaneyh** (Stopping blood flow with arterial clamps): This is mentioned in the passage.
*   **D: ejera2 3malyat betr lemreda aleghengheryena** (Performing tracheotomies for patients with respiratory problems): The passage doesn't mention tracheotomies.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Kana lada al jarra7in ma3refa bil 3adid min al muhadde2at..."" (The surgeons had knowledge of many painkillers...). This refers to the use of medicines and surgical techniques.
* **The text mentions:** ""Asba7o bari3ana fil bater li enqadh al marda..."" (They became skilled in saving patients...). This points to surgical skill and methods.
* **The text also says:** ""Imbaratur Augustus fi tajnid al-a6ibba2, wa shakkalu awal fayla8 6ibbiy rumaniy li istikhdamih fi a38ab al-ma3arik."" (Emperor Augustus recruited doctors and formed the first Roman medical corps to be used in the harshness of battle). This clearly indicates the formation of medical corps.
* **The text does NOT mention the establishment of teaching hospitals.** While Roman medical knowledge advanced, the text doesn't say they created hospitals specifically for teaching purposes. The advancements were made through practical experience and the development of medical corps.

Therefore, option C is the only one not directly supported by the text. The other options are mentioned or implied within the passage.

The passage states: ""Tatamayyaz albinayat almukhtalifa bi qudrat mutanawi3a, kama annaha 7assasa li atwal almawjat almukhtalifa...""  This translates to: ""Different eye structures are characterized by diverse abilities, as they are sensitive to different wavelengths.""  The passage emphasizes that the difference in eye structures lies in their sensitivity to various wavelengths of light.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: mettelbat aleka3an alhey (relationship to the living organism):** While the eye structure adapts to the needs of the organism, this isn't the *primary* factor determining the difference *between* eye structures in different organisms.
* **C: mestewa alhedh (level of sharpness):** The passage mentions different levels of sharpness, but the *basis* for the difference in sharpness is still the sensitivity to different wavelengths.

(The spiritual guide represents a fundamental aspect of all Hindu religions, but in Sikhism it acquired importance that forms the essence of Sikh beliefs.)  This highlights the unique importance of the teacher (morshed arruحي) in Sikhism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Option A: kanet alesyekheyh netyejh aneqsam ta'efi dakhel aletqaleyd alhendewseyh** (Sikhism arose as a result of sectarian divisions within Hindu traditions) - The text states Sikhism *developed* in the 15th century, not that it *arose as a result of divisions.* While it did develop *within* Hinduism, the text doesn't say the divisions *caused* it.
* **Option C: khelf ts3 mu3llemyn b3d mu2eses aldyen, Guru Nanak** (Nine teachers followed the founder of the religion, Guru Nanak) - The text says *nine* teachers followed Guru Nanak, not three.
* **Option D: b3d teqaleyd alesyekheyh metjedrh fi alhendewseyh** (Sikh traditions are deeply rooted in Hinduism) - The text acknowledges that Sikhism developed *within* Hinduism and that its traditions are *rooted* in Hinduism, but it also emphasizes that Sikhism has *unique* aspects (the importance of the teacher).  So, saying it's *deeply rooted* doesn't negate the uniqueness mentioned.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

It states Sikhs ""ala al rughem min 2e3terafehem bi judhur al-Hendoseyya wa taqalidiha"" (although they acknowledge their roots in Hindu traditions).  This doesn't make it a core belief *within* Sikhism itself.
* **C: refd ala3teraf bi al deyanat al hindeyya alakhera (rejection of acknowledging the last Hindu religion):** The text doesn't mention rejecting Hindu religions.

This translates to: ""Children's behaviors lead to many problems because they """"engage in risky behaviors, argue, and defy rules"""" **in order to stimulate their brains because they cannot be stimulated with ordinary means**.""

This clearly indicates they engage in risky behaviors to get attention and stimulation because regular methods don't work.  Option C directly reflects this reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: letqelyel fert alenshat (To reduce the excess of activity):** While they *have* excess energy, the text focuses on the *reason* for risky behaviors, not the energy itself.
* **B: lemsa'edethem 3la aletwasel ma3 alaqeran (To help them communicate with peers):** The text states they have problems communicating with peers due to behavioral differences, not that they engage in risky behaviors *to* communicate.

The Arabic text states: ""عندما لا يرى الأشخاص أن الغزل الأمريكي أدخم لا يشكل خطراً محتملاً، فإنه قد يقتربون كثيراً منه و يعرضون أنفسهم للخطر...""

Translation: ""When people don't see the American Ghazal as a likely threat, they might get very close to it and expose themselves to danger...""

This directly indicates that **approaching too closely** is the risky behavior to avoid. The text warns that people underestimate the threat and therefore get too close, putting themselves in danger.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: تجهل وجودهم (ignoring their existence):** Ignoring something doesn't necessarily prevent danger; it might just make it more likely to happen unexpectedly.
*   **C: التقليل إلى أدنى حد من مستوى التهديد المحتمل (minimizing the potential threat to the lowest level):** This is the *incorrect* mindset. The text argues against *underestimating* the threat.
*   **D: مراقبتهم من مسافة بعيدة (monitoring them from a safe distance):**  While monitoring from a distance is safer, the text focuses on the danger of getting *too* close, not avoiding contact entirely.

The text explicitly states: ""Tu3addu dawlat Madagascar akbar al-buldan bila munazi3, wa hiya bi-mathabat qarra bi-mufradiha 3indama yata3allaqu al-7ayat al-barriya."" This translates to: ""The state of Madagascar is considered the largest country without conflicts, and it is firmly a continent on its own when it comes to wildlife.""

While the other options are mentioned, the text emphasizes Madagascar's significance specifically for its wildlife.

This translates to: ""There are theological Christian interpretations of this tradition, but it may be related to spring and fertility following a Christian pattern. Most traditional churches hold the Easter night on Saturday during the Easter family, and often the gatherings meet at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.""

The text connects the traditional Easter celebration with **watching the sunrise (mshahdh shrwq alshms)**, a practice often associated with the resurrection of Christ. While other options might relate to spring and renewal, the text directly links the traditional church celebration with observing the sunrise.

The text explicitly states: ""Yajib 2an yakuna ladayka tadhkarat dhahab wa 3awda li-ithbat tul muddat 2iqamatik."" which translates to ""You must have a round trip ticket to prove the duration of your stay.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jwaz sfr sary almf'ewl b3d 6 ashhr mn twarykh alsfr (A valid passport expired after 6 months from the date of travel):**  The text says the passport must be valid for at least 6 months *after* the travel date, not that it expires *after* 6 months.
* **B: rsalh d'ewh qanwnyh (A legal invitation letter):** While a legal invitation letter might be *helpful* it's not a *required* condition explicitly stated in the text.
* **D: btaqh aleqamh alamrykyh alda'emh (A permanent American residence card):** The text says American Green Card holders are exempt from some requirements, but it doesn't say a Green Card is *required* to enter Ecuador. It's a condition for *exemption*, not a condition for entry.

The other options are related but not the primary reason stated in the text:

* **A: alhfaz 3la 3dd almsafryn 3nd alhd aladna (Maintaining the number of travelers at the minimum)** isn't directly mentioned.
* **C: takyd mdh eqamh almsafr (Emphasizing the duration of the traveler's residence)** is mentioned, but the overarching reason is organized migration flow.
* **D: dman slahyh jwazat alsfr (Ensuring the validity of the passport)** is a specific requirement, not the primary reason for the overall conditions.

Translation: ""It is possible to find high-end glasses with prestigious trademarks in these areas, but they have two problems; some may be counterfeit, and the genuine imported products may be more expensive for us.""

This directly indicates that high-end glasses are likely to be *more* expensive in foreign countries. The other options are either mentioned as potentially cheaper (eye exam) or are not directly related to price differences (health insurance, glasses without brand names).
"

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: qd tkwn hnak hajh ela fhs edafi ll'eyn (there might be a need for an additional eye exam):** While getting an eye exam is good advice, the text focuses specifically on the risks associated with purchasing eyeglasses. It's not a primary concern mentioned as a *danger* of buying in a foreign country.
* **B: qd la tkwn alwsfh salhh letarat m3ynh (the prescription might not be valid for the eyeglasses):**  The text advises bringing the medical prescription, implying this is a solution to this problem, not a risk.
* **D: qd la yghty altamyn altklfh (the insurance might not cover the cost):** While insurance coverage can be an issue, the text's main point is about the quality and authenticity of the eyeglasses themselves.



Therefore, **C** directly reflects the danger specifically highlighted in the provided text.

Here's why:

* **Option A** is incorrect because the text states that the pound sterling and credit cards are generally accepted *throughout* the islands, not just the remote ones.
* **Option B** is incorrect because the text says the US dollar is accepted ""in many instances"" in Stanley, not that Stanley is the *only* place.
* **Option C** is correct. The text explicitly states: ""Kad yakun mina al-musta7il tadawul 3umlat juzur Falklands wa sarfiha kharij al-juzur, lidha yanbaghy mubadalat annuqud qabla mughadarat al-juzr."" (It may be impossible to circulate and exchange Falklands currency outside the islands, therefore it is necessary to exchange money before leaving the islands.)
* **Option D** is incorrect. The text clearly states that the pound sterling is the most widely accepted currency *in general* when excluding the Falklands pound.

Therefore, only option C accurately reflects the information provided in the text."

Here's why:

The text states: ""Sayatimmu qabul al-junayh al-istarlini 3umuman fi ayi makan fil juzur..."" which translates to ""The British Pound will generally be accepted in any place in the islands..."" This means the British Pound is accepted throughout the Falkland Islands.

While credit cards and US dollars are sometimes accepted, the text explicitly mentions the British Pound is accepted everywhere. Options A, C, and D are incorrect because they don't reflect the general acceptance throughout the entire islands.
"

The text states that temple festivals include decorated elephant processions and temple orchestras, but *doesn't* mention baby elephants specifically as a standard part of the celebrations.  The other options (anniversary of the temple, birthday of the deity, and other major events related to the temple) are all explicitly mentioned as reasons for the festivals.



"

This means temple festivals include processions of decorated elephants.
* Option C directly mentions the processions *during* the temple festivals, aligning perfectly with the text.
* Option A is too general (""in any place"") and doesn't specify the context.
* Option B is incorrect; the processions are part of the festival, not *in* the temple itself.
* Option D is not mentioned in the text.

This means there's no point in searching for discounts on first class or business class tickets for direct flights. The airlines are aware of travelers willing to pay a premium for speed and comfort, and they charge accordingly.

The text then says:  ""df'e alnfqat mn khlal shrktk (paying the expenses through your company)"" is implicitly the way to avoid those high costs, as the company would bear the expense.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: hjz aldrjh alawla bdlaan mn ala'emal (booking first class instead of business class):** The text states first class is expensive.
* **C: hjz rhlh ghyr mbashrh mn aldrjh alawla (booking a non-direct flight in first class):**  This is unlikely to be cheaper and would still be first class.
* **D: al'ethwr 3la khsm (getting a discount):**  The text states there are no discounts for first/business class on direct flights.

The text states: ""Attariqa al wadi7a lil safar fil daraja al oula aw darajat rijal al a3mal hiya dafe3 mablaghan min al mal lil 7usul 3ala al imtiyaz...""  This translates to: ""The clear way to travel in first class or business class is to pay a sum of money to obtain the privilege...""

The question asks: ""wfqana llfa8arh, ma aldy sykwn mdy'eh llwqt llbhth 3nh 3nd hjz drws ajrh m3ynh?"" which means ""According to the text, what is the key to saving time when booking specific fare classes?""

The text then explains that business class (darajat rijal a'emal) offers a faster and more luxurious way to travel, and people are willing to pay more for it.  Therefore, knowing about business class fares is the key to saving time (and potentially money) when booking a flight with a specific fare class.

This translates to ""Don't forget to add additional costs for additional visas, departure fees, land transport, and so on for all those places outside of Africa.""

Options B, C, and D are mentioned, but only option A directly reflects a cost specifically related to *additional* travel outside of Africa that needs to be factored into the total price comparison.

This translates to ""In some countries or types of stores, there is at least one restaurant inside the facility, and it is often an informal restaurant to a certain extent and at reasonable prices.""

While microwaves (D) are mentioned as a way for customers to heat food, they aren't an offering *provided by the supermarket itself* to attract ready-meal buyers. The text focuses on the supermarket providing the restaurant.

Options B and C are incorrect because the text states the opposite – supermarkets are increasing variety in ready meals (B) and the text doesn't mention ""alt3am alny2"" (potentially meaning ""raw food"" or something similar) as a draw for ready-meal buyers.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that the dialects of French in Belgium and Switzerland differ slightly from the French spoken in France.
* It mentions differences in the numbering system and pronunciation of some words.
* Importantly, it concludes that Belgians and Swiss who speak French are taught standard French in school, *so they can understand even if you use the standard French numbering system.*

This implies they *might not* understand the exact, precise way French is spoken in France (the ""m3zm al-Fransiya almhkyh fi Fransa""), even though they are familiar with standard French.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: nidham attarqim al-Faransy al-qiyasi (the standard French numbering system):** The text says they *can* understand even if you use the standard numbering system.
* **B: klmat Fransiya ghrybh (words of France are strange):** The text mentions pronunciation differences but doesn't suggest entire words are strange.
* **C: ntq b3d alklomat al-Fransiya (pronunciation of some French words):** The text *does* mention differences in pronunciation.

The text explicitly states: ""lidha sa-yakunun qadirin 3ala fehmika 7atta en stakhdamata nidham attarqim al-Faransy al-qiyasi."" This translates to: ""therefore they will be able to understand you even if you use the standard French numbering system.""  This implies that the standard French taught in schools *is* understood, and the difference lies in other aspects like the numbering system and pronunciation.  It's *not* something lacking as in France.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ntq kl alklmat** (pronunciation of all words): The text says ""yakhtalifu nitqu ba3edh al-kalimat ikhtilafan basitan"" (the pronunciation of some words differs slightly), so not all words have the same pronunciation.
* **B: nzam altrqym** (numbering system): The text clearly states that the numbering system is different in Belgium and Switzerland.
* **D: thj'eh b3d alklmat alfrnsyh** (missing some French words): The text doesn't say that any French words are missing.

Option B describes the scenario where you *don't* book directly with the airline, implying a violation of the rule.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: eda knt tsafr m3 WestJet:** The text lists WestJet as an airline offering discounted last-minute tickets. This doesn't imply a scenario where you wouldn't book directly.

Here's why:

The passage states that using a dedicated GPS device or buying new maps are options when the map application isn't sufficient.  The first sentence also implies that using a map application via GPS on your smartphone is generally the easiest and most convenient. Therefore, you would opt for a dedicated device or maps when you *can afford* it, and when the phone-based option is lacking (due to data issues or coverage).  The other options are incorrect:

* **B: 3ndma tkwn mtakdaan mn anh sykwn ldyk atsal byanat (When you are sure you have data access):** The passage explicitly says that GPS on a smartphone is problematic without data access.
* **C: 3ndma tkwn kharj alntaq (When you are outside the coverage area):** This is a reason *to avoid* relying solely on your phone's GPS, not a reason to use a dedicated device *more* often.
* **D: 3ndma la trghb fi ast'ejar jhaz (When you do not want to rent a device):** This is a personal preference and doesn't relate to when a dedicated GPS is a better option than a phone app.

The text explicitly states: "" Idha lam yakun ladayka ittisal bayanat fi hatifik, aw 3indama yakun kharij nitaq attaghtiya, fa qad yakun ada2uhu ma7dud aw ghayr muta7."" This means that a lack of data connection or being outside of coverage can make using GPS apps difficult or impossible.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: توفير المال (Tawfeer al mal) - Saving money:** The text mentions the possibility of *spending* money on a new GPS device or rental.
* **C: تجنب إيجار (Tanjub ijaar) - Avoiding rental:** The text suggests renting a GPS device as an option.
* **D: لا تحتاج إلى شراء خراط جديد (La tahtaj ila shira' kharaat jadeed) - No need to buy new maps:** The text mentions buying new GPS maps as a possibility.



Therefore, the main reason why using a phone's GPS app might not be ideal compared to a dedicated GPS device is the potential for data connection issues.

This translates to: ""Make sure that the agent through whom you book is specialized in the Galapagos Islands and has good knowledge of a diverse range of ships.""

This is the direct advice given in the text for ensuring you find a suitable ship.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: alhjz fi mjmw'eh ttkwn mn akthr mn 8 rkab ldyhm ahtmamat mmathlh (Booking in a group of more than 8 people with similar interests):** While group booking *can* be helpful, the text doesn't emphasize this as the primary way to ensure a suitable ship.

The text describes how Tabdhul al-kazinuhat tries to keep guests gambling by providing:

*   Excellent food and drinks
*   Entertainment
*   Making it difficult to leave
*   Sometimes, alcoholic beverages

The text explicitly states that alcohol weakens judgment and that skilled gamblers know the importance of staying focused. 

Option A, ""wfrh aldw' altby'ey (Free medical care),"" is completely unrelated to the tactics used to keep guests gambling.  The focus is on creating a pleasant and disorienting atmosphere. Free medical care doesn't fit into that strategy. The other options (B, C, and D) all align with the tactics described in the text.

This translates to: ""And with that, intoxication weakens the ability to distinguish, and all professional gamblers know the importance of staying alert.""

The passage also mentions that casinos often make it difficult to find exits and encourage guests to spend more time and money.  While these are things a gambler should be aware of, the text directly links alcohol consumption to impaired judgment – a critical factor for a gambler to avoid.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: qbwl ay hwafz (accepting any incentive):** While accepting incentives can be risky, the passage doesn't focus on this as a primary concern.
* **C: tfqd alwqt aw alsa'eat (losing time or hours):** This is a consequence of the casino's tactics, not something the gambler *must* avoid based on the passage's warnings.
* **D: alastfsar 3n aqrb mkhrj (asking about the nearest exit):**  The passage indicates casinos try to obscure exits, making this a good idea, not something to avoid.

This demonstrates that waving the hand (altlwy7) in a certain way can have different meanings in different cultures.  The text directly links the waving gesture in rural Malaysia to the meaning of ""come.""

"""wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hy alesharh alty qd t3ny """"3ud""""?""","The correct answer is **A: التلويح مع راحة اليد باتجاه الداخل (Wattalwiḥ ma' raḥat al-yad bitajāh al-dākhil)** which translates to **Waving with the palm facing inward**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""qad yartakib a7ad al-musafirin al-Bri6aniyyin fi Esbanya 5a6a2 3inda al-talwiḥ bi yadihi lil wada3 wal lati tatdhamman ra7at al-yad al-lati tuwajih al-shakhes al-ladhi yulawwiḥ (badalan min attalwiḥ lil shakhes al-muqabel) ka ishara lil 3awda.""

This translates to: ""a Bahraini traveler in Spain may commit a mistake when waving his hand to say goodbye, which includes the palm facing the person waving to (instead of waving to the person facing him) as a sign of return.""

Therefore, the palm facing inward is the signal for ""return"".  Option A accurately reflects this.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy ysbb alshqwq?","The correct answer is **B: anhar jlydyh ghyr mstqrh (unstable glaciers)**.

The text states: ""Al-anhar al-jalidiyya laysat thabita, wa lakinnaha tatdaffaq na7wa asfal al-jabal. Wa sa-yu2addi dhalika ela 7uduth tashaquqat, wa shuquq...""  This translates to: ""The glaciers are not stable, but they flow downwards towards the mountain. And this will lead to the occurrence of cracks and fissures...""

The text directly links the instability of the glaciers (""al-anhar al-jalidiyya laysat thabita"") to the formation of cracks (""tashaquqat, wa shuquq"").  Options A, C, and D describe *consequences* of the unstable glaciers (ice bridges, collapsing caves, falling blocks), not the direct cause of the cracks.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn h3la' ymkn ekhfa'eh bwasth jswr althlj?","The correct answer is **A: al-tshqqat (التشققات)**, which means ""the cracks"".

Therefore, the cracks are the ones that could be hidden by the ice bridges.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Goma was devastated by the Nyiragongo eruption and that there is ongoing fighting in the northern Kivu region, which surrounds Goma. This indicates a need for precautions in the surrounding area.
* While the Nyiragongo volcano itself is mentioned, the broader danger is the instability in the region, not just the volcano.
* The text mentions the city center (wist al-madinah) was heavily damaged, suggesting it's a dangerous area, but the surrounding area is the primary concern for travelers.
* Rwanda is mentioned as being nearby, but the text doesn't directly link precautions to Rwanda itself. It's the area *around* Goma that needs attention.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Yumkinuka istikhdam boda boda (taxi 3ala shakl darraja nariya) li ttajawwul fi Goma. yablugh assi3r al-3ady (al-ma7ally) na7wa 500 frank kunghuly li rri7la al-qasira."" (You can use boda boda (motorcycle taxi) to travel in Goma. The usual (local) price is about 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.)

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: almshajrat fi shmal kyfw mslyh** (the forests in northern Kivu are well-equipped): The text mentions fighting in northern Kivu, but doesn't say the forests are ""well-equipped"" for tourists. It's a vague statement.
* **B: enha mkan jyd lttb'e alghwryla aljblyh bas'ear m3qwlh** (it's a good place to follow the mountain guerrillas at a reasonable price): The text mentions that it's a good place to follow mountain guerrillas *because* it's a good place to *see* them. It doesn't imply it's a good place to *follow* them, and the price is mentioned in relation to a motorcycle taxi ride, not guerrilla tours.
* **D: tq'e qa'edh brkan nyraghwnghw fi almdynh** (it's located at the foot of Mount Nyiragwngha in the city): The text says the city was affected by an eruption *near* Mount Nyiragwngha, but doesn't say the city is *at the foot* of the mountain.

Therefore, option C is the only one directly supported by the text.

(The permit is limited to protecting the valley...) and ""...yujad 3adad ma7dud min attasari7 al-ma7juza li-talabat al-7udhur al-mutawaffira 3ala asـas asـbaqiyat al-7udhur."" (...there is a limited number of permits reserved for applicants based on a first-come, first-served basis.)

* Options B and C are incorrect: The permit isn't *only* available in January; it's available for a limited time before the start of the season.  You *can* obtain the permit without being a participant; it's for protecting the valley.

* Option D is partially correct (there are a limited number of permits), but option A is more comprehensive because it describes the *system* of obtaining the permit (first-come, first-served basis).

ay mma yly aql ahtmalaan ll'ethwr 'elyh fi nw'e alfnadq almwswfh fi alfa8arh?,"The text describes historic hotels from the golden age of steam railroads and the railway line, built in the 19th or early 20th centuries. These hotels were frequented by celebrities, offered delicious food and excellent entertainment, and featured antique furnishings alongside older forms of entertainment. While often privately owned, they sometimes hosted heads of state and other prominent figures.

Considering this description, let's analyze the options:

*   **A: bar kwktyl (cocktail bar)** - This is *highly likely*. Historic hotels often had cocktail bars as part of their entertainment and social offerings.
*   **B: mt'em fakhrh fi almwq'e (a restaurant proud of its location)** - This is *likely*. The text explicitly mentions delicious food being offered.
*   **C: zmla' dywf mshhwryn aw m3rwfyn (famous or well-known guests)** - This is *likely*. The text explicitly mentions that celebrities frequented these hotels and sometimes heads of state.
*   **D: ghrf tm tjdydha m3khraan m3 trqyat hdythh (rooms recently renovated with modern amenities)** - This is the *least likely*. The text emphasizes *antique furnishings* and the hotels maintaining a character from a past era. While some renovations might have occurred, the core description points to preserving the historic character rather than modernizing extensively.

Therefore, the least likely to be found in the described type of hotel is **D: ghrf tm tjdydha m3khraan m3 trqyat hdythh (rooms recently renovated with modern amenities)**.

**So the answer is D.**

**B: mt'em m3 tahen mtmyz (Excellent dining with distinguished cuisine)**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that these hotels ""ghaliban ma kanat tuqaddimu ta3aman shahiyan wa saharat ra2i3a"" (often offered delicious food and wonderful entertainment).  This highlights the importance of the dining experience.
* While the other options are desirable, they are not emphasized as strongly as the food and entertainment.
* **A: almfrwshat al'etyqh fi jmy'e anha' al'eqar (Standard furnishings in all properties)** is mentioned as being outdated.
* **C: salh tqadam altrfyh allyly (Availability of nighttime entertainment)** is noted as a feature, but the delicious food is highlighted more prominently.
* **D: as3ear m3qwlh llghrf (Reasonable room prices)** is mentioned as a factor for travelers with limited funds, but it's not emphasized as a defining characteristic of these hotels.

Therefore, excellent dining with distinguished cuisine aligns best with the information presented in the text about these historical hotels.

This clearly refers to the Jardín de la Unión.

* **The text states:** ""Callejon del Beso (Mamsha alqubla) shurfatan tafsil baynahuma 69 cm faqat hiya mawtin 2usturat 7ob qadima."" This confirms the presence of the old love story.
* **The text explicitly mentions:** ""mbna dyr qdym"" (old monastery building) - ""wfqan llfa8arh, ay mma yly ghyr mwjwd fi hdyqh alathad?"" ""mbna dyr qdym"" is the answer.

(Families with young children may need more preparation, but taking a day in the open air is easy even with infants and preschool-aged children).

Option D directly contradicts this statement. The other options are all supported by the text:

* **A:**  The text mentions ""hnak hajh ela alqlyl mn althdyr llmshy lmsafat twylh 3la almsarat alshlh"" (there is a little bit of variation in walking long distances on the path).
* **B:** The text says ""tkhtlf almsafat, wlkn mn almftrd an ytm tghtytha fi ghdwn ywm wahd"" (the distance varies, but it is assumed that it will be covered in one day).
* **C:** The text states ""alashkhas aldyn ytmt'ewn bmstwa m3tdl mn allyaqh albdnyh qadrwn 'emwmaan 3la alastmta'e bhda alnshat"" (people who have a moderate level of physical fitness are able to enjoy this activity).

This translates to: ""To go for a one-day walk along a relatively easy path, some preparation is needed, and any person with moderate fitness can enjoy it.""

The question asks when a daily walk is required. The text implies that a daily walk is suitable when the person is physically fit enough to enjoy it.  The other options are not directly supported by the text:

* **B: عندما ينتوي على مسار أسهل (When intending to take an easier path):** The text says the path should be relatively easy, but doesn't require an easier path *daily*.
* **C: عندما يذهب الأطفال في نزهة (When children go for a walk):** While families with young children need more preparation, the text doesn't link *daily* walks specifically to children's outings.
* **D: عندما يكون الارتفاع في بيئة طبيعية أكثر (When the altitude in a natural environment is higher):**  The text mentions the walk takes place in open air (هواء الطلق), but doesn't directly connect altitude to the need for daily walks.

This translates to: ""In the counties of Rogaland and Agder, they are usually called """"hei"""" which means a coastal plain devoid of trees, often covered with heather.""

The question asks about the difference in the hills in Rogaland or Agder compared to the rest of Norway. The text explicitly points out that these hills (referred to as ""hei"") are *often* covered with heather, which is a key difference.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: thtwy 3la ashjar (they are covered with trees):** The text specifically says ""khaliya min al-ashjar"" (devoid of trees).
* **B: la ywjd mdayq (there is no disturbance):** This is irrelevant to the description of the hills.
* **C: alhdab fi alghalb mtsawyh (the hills are mostly equal):** The text doesn't mention the elevation or shape of the hills, only their vegetation.

The text explicitly states: ""Ghaliban ma yushar ela hadhihi al-hidhab bi isim """"vidde"""" mimma ya3ni masa7a wasi3a wa maftouha bila ashjar...""  This translates to: ""Often these ridges are referred to by the name """"vidde"""" which means a wide and open area without trees...""

Therefore, an open land area is a defining characteristic of the ""vidde"" and thus, a characteristic that *will* be found in Norway.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: الأهداب المغطاة بالغابات (al-hidāb al-mughaṭṭā bil-ghābāt - ridges covered with forests):** The text states the ""vidde"" is *without trees*, so this is the opposite of what it describes.
* **C: مدينق شديد الانحدار (madayniq shadīd al-inḥidār - very steep slopes):** While Norway *does* have steep slopes, the text focuses on the ""vidde"" as a *wide, open area*, not a steep one.
* **D: مستنقعات (mustanqaʿāt - swamps):**  The text mentions that some ""hei"" (a similar area) are often covered in marshes, but it doesn't define the ""vidde"" as being a swamp. While marshes *can* be found in Norway, it's not a defining characteristic of the ""vidde.""

* It also mentions that many hill stations receive a significant amount of snow (""kammiyyat si77iyya min athalj"").
* The activities mentioned (skiing, snowshoeing) are directly related to snowfall.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: n'eal dyqh (tight boots):** While tight boots are mentioned as a safety precaution, they don't directly prevent the foot from getting caught.
* **C: rka'eb jldyh (leather stirrups):** Leather stirrups are a standard component of stirrups and don't offer a safety mechanism against getting caught.

* Finally, it says that families with children are rare.

Therefore, a guest in their mid-thirties (which is older than the typical twenties but not as significantly older as someone in their forties or fifties) would be less likely than someone in their twenties to be the *most* probable guest to encounter in a shared room.  A solo traveler (B) might be more common than someone traveling with young children (C) because families are rare.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** "" Idha kunta turid 2an tata3allam kayfiat ramy al-boomerang allathy ya3udu ilayk..."" (If you want to learn how to throw the boomerang that comes back to you...)
* **The passage emphasizes:** ""...fa ta2akkad min 2anna ladayk wa7idan munasiban lil-3awda."" (...then make sure you have one suitable for returning.)
* **The passage also warns:** ""Mu3dham anwa3 al-boomerang al-mutawaffira fi 2ustralya la ta3ud ila ramiha marra 2ukhra."" (Most types of boomerangs available in Australia do not return to the thrower a second time.)

This indicates that not all boomerangs return, and you need a specific type *capable* of returning. Option D accurately reflects this nuance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: st'ewd da'emaan ela ydk eda tm rmyha bshkl shyh** (It always returns to your hand if thrown skillfully) - The passage states that even with skill, *most* boomerangs don't return.
* **B: hy akthr sh'ebyh byn alskan almhlyyn mn alsyah** (It is more similar among the locals than the tourists) - This is irrelevant to how the boomerang *works*.
* **C: la ytwfr alkthyr mn albwmyrangh fi astralya** (Many boomerangs are not available in Australia) - The passage says the opposite, that *most* are not returning boomerangs, implying they are available.

Translation: ""The contagious disease is the disease caused by one of the pathogenic agents, such as viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other parasites.""

Option B directly reflects this information. The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alashkhas almsabwn (infected people)**: While infected people *spread* disease, they are not the *cause* of the disease itself.
*   **C: albiktiria (bacteria)**: Bacteria are *examples* of pathogenic agents, but not the encompassing cause of all contagious diseases.
*   **D: allqa7at (vaccines)**: Vaccines are used to *prevent* contagious diseases, not to spread them.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy la yu3erf anh ysbb mrdaan m3dyaan?","The correct answer is **A: allqa7at (vaccinations)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Qad ta3tamid hadhihi al-mutatallibat ghaliban 3ala al-buldan al lati zaraha al musafir aw al lati yanwi ziyarataha."" This translates to ""These requirements often depend on the countries the traveler has visited or intends to visit.""

The text further says that governments often require travelers to receive vaccinations against various diseases. Vaccinations are a preventative measure *against* infectious diseases, meaning they are used to protect people from diseases caused by pathogens like viruses and bacteria.  Therefore, vaccinations prevent illness, not *cause* it.

The other options (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) are all *agents* that *cause* infectious diseases.  The question is asking what is used to prevent diseases caused by these agents.

Therefore, vaccinations are the answer, as they are used to protect against diseases caused by viruses and bacteria.

Here's why:

* **The premise of the first statement** highlights that VPNs are superior to proxies because they redirect *all* internet traffic, not just HTTP.  The question asks when a proxy is *sufficient*.
* **Option C** directly addresses this.  If the user *only* needs to redirect traffic using the TCP protocol, a proxy would be sufficient. This implies they aren't concerned about the comprehensive traffic redirection a VPN provides.
* **Options A and B** describe scenarios where a VPN is *better* than a proxy, not when a proxy is sufficient.
* **Option D** mentions bandwidth requirements, which are a consideration for *both* proxies and VPNs, but doesn't determine when a proxy is *sufficient*.

Therefore, a proxy is only enough when the user's primary need is to redirect TCP traffic.

* **Option A is true.** The text mentions the difference in pronunciation between single ""r"" and double ""rr"".
* **Option B is true.** The text states that most words are pronounced as they are written.

This indicates that modern shopping centers are a *recent* development in Izmir, not something that existed before the modern era.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: ashshaware3 al wasi3a (wide streets):** While wide streets are mentioned, it doesn't specify when they were built. However, the text implies they are a more recent feature alongside other modern developments.
*   **B: al mabani dhat al wajihat azzujajiyya (buildings with glass facades):** Similar to wide streets, the text implies these are newer architectural features.
*   **D: al asquf attaqlidiyya dhat al qarmid al a7mar (replica churches with red tile roofs):**  These are described as ""replica"" which indicates they are recent constructions attempting to emulate older styles.

Therefore, the only option clearly stated as a *recent* addition is shopping centers.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the text:

* **A: almdynh thyt bkhlyj kbyr (The city is located by a large bay):** The text says ""Laqad kanat madinat Smyrna al qadimat taqa3 7awla khalij dakhem"" which translates to ""The ancient city of Smyrna was located around its bay.""

Wide avenues and buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers, as well as traditional red-tiled churches, the Grand Bazaar, mosques and old churches are spreading."" This indicates a more European Mediterranean feel than traditional Turkey.
* **C: ymknk al'ethwr 3la kl mn mrakz altswq alhdythh walkna'es alqdymh (You can see both the modern shopping center and the old churches):** The text explicitly mentions both ""mariz altswq alhdythh"" (modern shopping centers) and ""kana'es alqdymh"" (old churches).



Therefore, option D is the only statement that is *not* mentioned in the provided text.

""الإمبراطور"" (al-Embrator) means Emperor, and the text explicitly mentions the Emperor of Japan.

Here's why:

The text states that while Al-Quds has significant religious, cultural, and historical importance, *most other countries and the United Nations do not recognize it as the capital of Israel.*  This lack of international recognition is a point of contention and a factor that would likely *discourage* tourism for many people.

Here's why the other options are less likely to be the *least* probable:

* **A: alahmyh aldynyh llmdynh (its religious importance):** The text explicitly calls it a holy city for three major religions, making its religious importance a major draw.
* **C: erwdha althqafyh (its cultural scene):** The text mentions cultural importance and numerous shops, cafes, restaurants, indicating a vibrant cultural scene.
* **D: almwaq'e altarykhyh al'edydh (its numerous historical sites):** The text highlights the abundance of historical and archaeological sites.



Therefore, the lack of widespread international recognition as the capital of Israel is the most probable factor to deter tourists.

The text states that a Wild Card allows entry to a *selected group* of parks or *all* national parks in South Africa.  If a traveler *only* visits Kruger National Park, they wouldn't benefit from a Wild Card unless it specifically covers Kruger (which isn't guaranteed by the text).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: msafr ykhtt lzyarh akbr 3dd mmkan mn South African National Parks (SANParks)** - This *would* benefit from a Wild Card, as the card allows access to a group (or all) of SANParks.
* **C: msafr bmyzanyh mhdwdh wmhtm brswm almntzh** -  Having a limited budget and being sensitive to park fees *would* make a Wild Card beneficial, as it offers a more cost-effective way to visit multiple parks.

* **C: alkhwf alsghyrh (small fears):** The passage doesn't mention fear as a factor causing danger.
* **D: alkablat alfwladyh (the steel cables):** The cables are *there* for support in the steepest parts, reducing danger, not *causing* it.

* **al-lu7um (meat)**, especially pork.
* **al-khdarat (vegetables)** are mentioned as used in various dishes.

However, grains (al-hbwb) are *not* specifically mentioned as a core ingredient in the Mallorcan cuisine described in the text. While bread *is* a grain product, the question asks for the fundamental ingredient itself, not just a product *made from* grains.

The text explicitly states: ""Tuqaddim al-3adid mina al-amakin fi Rotorua wajabat hangi **tuthab bil-7arara al-jawfiyya**"" (Many places in Rotorua offer hangi dishes cooked with geothermal heat). It *doesn't* say you can *find* geothermal hangi in Rotorua in general. It specifies that places in Rotorua *use* geothermal heat.

* **A: ystkhdm hangi altaqh al7raryh alardyh alahjar alsakhnh mn alnar ltskhyn alhfrh** (Hangi uses geothermal heat and hot stones from fire to heat the pit) - This is a direct quote from the text.

* **D: alahjar alsakhnh (hot stones):**  Repeated, but still a correct answer according to the text.
* **A: ghaz (gas):** Gas heating isn't mentioned in the text.



Therefore, the best answer is **C** because it represents a significant method of hangi pit heating that is *not* mentioned in the provided options.  The repetition of ""alahjar alsakhnh"" might be a distractor.

This indicates that bringing a *brightly colored headscarf (mlhf)* is what will lead to a positive reception. The other options are incorrect:

*   **B: tghtyh ktfyk (cover your shoulders):** While covering shoulders is required, the text emphasizes the *color* of the covering.
*   **C: ast'earh mlhf mn aldyr (borrow a headscarf from the monastery):**  Borrowing is an option, but the text focuses on bringing your own *brightly colored* covering.
*   **D: artda' tnwrh tsl lfwq alrkbh (wear a tunic that reaches above the knees):** This describes the required length of the tunic for men, not what would elicit a smile from the monks/nuns for women.

It also says ""yutlabu min arrijal irtida2 sarawil tughati arrukbatayn"" which means ""men are required to wear trousers that cover the knees.""

This translates to: ""Because the areas are sparsely populated, and therefore light pollution is not often a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.""

Options A, C, and D are related to *when* the aurora is visible or when light pollution is low, but the passage explicitly links stargazing enjoyment to the *lack of population density* which reduces light pollution. Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer.

Without a clear line of sight, the service simply won't work.

Here's why:

The text states: ""wa-l-aksu sa7i7"" which means ""and the opposite is true."" It also says that when it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it's winter in the Southern Hemisphere (where Montevideo is).  Furthermore, it mentions that winter in Montevideo (""fasl ashita2u fi nisf al-kura al-2ardhiya ashamaly wal 3aksu sa7i7"") brings cooler temperatures, although humidity can make it feel colder.  Therefore, to avoid windy conditions, the traveler should visit during Montevideo's winter months.

Here's why:

The text states: ""yakunu fasl assayf hunak 3indama yakunu fasl ashita2 fi nisf al-kura al-2ardhiya ashamaly wal 3aksu sa7i7."" This translates to ""It is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.""

This translates to: ""Currently, there are graffiti artists, and the activity of writing on walls is 'legitimate'.""  This directly contrasts with the idea of vandalism (تخريب).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: خرشبات (Vandalism):**  The text defines graffiti *as* a form of vandalism, but it also acknowledges the existence of artists who create graffiti that is *not* destructive.
* **C: جداريات غير مرغوب فيها على الممتلكات العامة (Undesirable murals on public property):**  This describes *vandalism*, not the artistic activity.
* **D: علامات غير مفهومة (Unintelligible marks):** While some graffiti might be unintelligible, the text doesn't focus on this aspect, and it's not a defining characteristic of all graffiti.

*   **C: tshghyl almwsyqa ela wqt mtakhr mn allyl (playing music until a late time at night):** The text says that *some parts* of the festival might continue playing music late, but it doesn't say that this late-night music is considered *essential* to the experience by most.

The text also mentions that small towns are not good for visitors due to problems with drunk driving and high concentrations of intoxicated people.

Therefore, the text advises visitors to avoid seeking nightlife in small town bars in Northern New Mexico. The other options are either mentioned as places with nightlife (casinos) or are not discussed in relation to nightlife suitability.

(Furthermore, all the mentioned casinos approximately offer drinks, and many of them bring commercial entertainment (primarily the large casinos directly surrounding Albuquerque and Santa Fe).)

*   **""al-bira al-ma7aliya al-2ukhra tusamma """"Manta"""".** (The other local beer is called ""Manta"".) This describes another beer.

*    **""3asa2ir al-fakiha murtafi3a, illa 2annaha ra2i3a.""** (Juices are expensive, but they are delicious.) This describes juices.

The text mentions that Australians find ""white coffee"" (likely referring to a coffee with a lot of milk, potentially a latte) strange. This implies that discerning travelers who prefer less milky coffee might want to avoid it. The question is asking for which drink discerning travelers might want to avoid.

Therefore, considering the context that Australians are strange about ""white coffee,"" a discerning traveler who prefers coffee without much milk might want to avoid it. However, none of the options directly relate to the Australians and the coffee.

The only item in the list that can potentially be avoided is the juice because the text mentions that they are expensive. So we can consider juice as a possible option that can be avoided.

* The text specifically states: ""Bi nnisba lil 2usturaliyin, fa-2ina fikrat al-qahwa """"al-bayda2 al-musatta7a"""" ghariba 3anhum."" This translates to ""As for Australians, the idea of 'flat white' is strange to them.""

Therefore, a waiter might mistakenly offer a flat white to an Australian because it's an unfamiliar drink to them.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alqhwh alsghyrh alswda' (espresso):** The text explicitly states espresso is understood.
* **B: rqm wahd (Number One):** This refers to the beer ""Number One"" and is understood.

"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mma yly la y'etbr sfh nmtyh llbarysyyn?","Let's break down the Arabic text and the question to determine the answer.

**Understanding the Arabic Text:**

The text translates roughly to:

""The Persians claim they are arrogant, stubborn, and deceitful. While this often is just a superficial stereotype, the easiest way to fit in in Paris is to act with the best behavior, i.e., to be a ""well-bred"" person (nurtured well). This will make things easier. The surprising foreign elements for the Persians will quickly evaporate if the main word is mentioned after it.""

**Identifying the Stereotypes:**

The text explicitly mentions three negative stereotypes attributed to Persians:

*   **Ananiyyun (أنانيون):** Arrogant
*   **Ghalidhum (غالضهم):** Stubborn
*   **Muta3ajrifun (متعجرفون):** Deceitful/Conceited (this carries a strong sense of arrogance and superiority)

**The Question:**

The question asks which of the following is *not* considered a stereotype of Persians according to the text.

**Analyzing the Options:**

*   **A: alghrwr (الغرور):** Arrogance - This *is* listed as one of the stereotypes.
*   **B: alfzazh (الفزاز):**  This word isn't present in the text, and it doesn't directly relate to the stereotypes mentioned. It is a colloquial term and doesn't fit the seriousness of the text.
*   **C: almrh (المرح):**  Fun/Playfulness - This *is not* listed as a stereotype in the text.  The text focuses on negative traits.
*   **D: almbaghth (المبغة):**  This word isn't present in the text and doesn't directly relate to the stereotypes. It also is a colloquial term and doesn't fit the seriousness of the text.

**Therefore, the correct answer is C: almrh (المرح) because the text doesn't portray Persians as fun/playful, and it's not mentioned as a stereotype.**

**Final Answer: C**"

This translates to: ""Metroplus is said to be more comfortable and less crowded, but its cost increases slightly, although it is still cheaper than regular metro tickets in Europe.""

Option C directly reflects this information.  The other options are incorrect:

*   **A: alhaflh fi mqadamh alqtar (it is the carriage at the front of the train):** The text mentions Metroplus carriages are at the front, but this isn't a benefit *of the first class* itself, but rather a characteristic of the Metroplus service.
*   **B: edm wjwd alkthyr mn alnas (the presence of many people):** Metroplus is *less* crowded.
*   **D: lha nfs s'er tdkrh Metro (it has the same price as a Metro ticket):** The text states Metroplus is *cheaper* than a regular metro ticket.

*   **A: التسبب في تفه جلدي (Causing skin irritation):** The text mentions that unfamiliar animals *can* cause allergies (حساسية). Skin irritation can be a type of allergic reaction.

*   **B: تهيج الحساسية (Allergic irritation):** The text explicitly states that unfamiliar animals *can* cause allergies (الحساسية).

*   **C: نشر عدوى (Spreading infection):** The text mentions that unfamiliar animals *can* spread diseases (تنشر السم). Spreading infection is a consequence of this.

*   **D: التسبب بسبب قوى (Causing due to strength):** This is a broad and vague statement. While some animals *can* cause serious injuries (جروح بالغة) or even death, the text doesn't specifically state that unfamiliar animals typically cause harm *due to strength*. The text focuses on disease, allergies, and food contamination.

Therefore, the answer that is **not** explicitly mentioned as a typical consequence is **D: التسبب بسبب قوى (Causing due to strength)**. While it is *possible* for an animal to cause injury due to strength, this isn't the main concern the text highlights.

**So the correct answer is D.**

Here's why:

The Persian text mentions ""kul matjar mawjud fil zawiya mali2"" which translates to ""every shop available in the corner"".  A ""corner shop"" (mtajr alzawyh) is the closest and most natural interpretation of this phrase in the context of where prepaid phone cards would be sold.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

*   **A: fi bldan m3ynh (in certain countries)** - This is too general. The text doesn't specify that the cards are only available in certain countries.
*   **B: fi mhtat alqtar (in supermarkets)** - While some supermarkets might sell prepaid cards, the text's focus on ""corner shops"" makes this less likely.
*   **D: 3nd alhwatf al'emwmyh (at public phones)** - While you *might* find cards at public phones, the text says the cards can be used from public phones *or* regular phones, not necessarily that you buy them *at* public phones.

The initial text mentions that a common way to access cheaper call rates is through free phone numbers that can be dialed from most phones.  Option B directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: la ymkn alwswl elyha ela fi bldan mhddh (It's not possible to access them in certain countries):** The text implies availability, not inaccessibility.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ay mn alashjar altalyh aql shyw'eana fi mntzh bhyrat Plitvice alwtny?","The passage states that Plitvice Lakes National Park is characterized by trees like **tannub** (telegraph tree). It doesn't mention the prevalence or absence of other trees like **azzan, blwt (oak), or shwh (beech)**. However, the question asks which tree is *least* common. 

Since the passage explicitly highlights tannub, and doesn't mention the other trees being particularly abundant, we have to infer. The answer must be the one *not* specifically mentioned and potentially less prevalent.  While the passage doesn't give definitive information, ""azzan"" is the least likely to be highlighted in a description of the park's characteristic trees. 

Therefore, the most reasonable answer, based on the information provided and the task of finding the *least* common tree, is **A: alzan**.

However, it is important to note this is an inference based on the provided text.  A definitive answer requires more information about the tree distribution in the park.

*   Golden eagle (nisir)
*   Lynx (buma)

*   Wild boar (qi6 al wa7shi)
*   Deer (6ahyuj)

None of the options (Turkia, ghryr al'esl, ta'er alshbnm, dyk alkhlnj) are listed as animals found in the park.  ""Ghryr al'esl"" (non-native) is the closest answer because the text describes a variety of animals, some of which are endangered and specific to the area, while others might be introduced or non-native. However, it is important to note that the text does not describe introduced species and just mentions the presence of endangered animal species.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy tsa'ed bh rmwz almntqh balf'el?","The correct answer is **D: alnskh ghyr alqanwny (illegal copying)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Fi 7aqiqat al amer, la tata2aththar rumuz al manatiq bi annasikh ghayr al qanunu..."" which translates to ""In reality, the region codes are not affected by illegal copying...""  The whole argument revolves around the fact that the supposed reason (""to avoid piracy"") is a false pretense. The real intention is to gain more control and profit, achieved by implementing a system of illegal copying.

Therefore, the passage directly addresses the issue of illegal copying (al-nskh ghayr al-qanuni) and its role in the company's motives.

This directly contradicts option B, which claims the purpose is to avoid illegal copying. The text indicates the code is *not* being affected to avoid illegal copying. It's being circumvented by using a similar copier.

The text clearly identifies the *real* motive as gaining greater market dominance and profit.  Options A, C, and D are either implied by the text or completely unrelated to the actual deception.

The text explicitly states the official procedure is to **declare** items that exceed legal limits.  While customs monitoring (D) is mentioned as a possible source of annoyance, it's not the *procedure* itself. The other options are less relevant:

* **A: fhs alhjrh** (immigration inspection) - While important, the question is specifically about procedures *upon arrival*, focusing on goods.
* **C: alhdwd alqanwnyh llashya'** (legal borders for items) - This is not a procedure; it's a concept related to what can/cannot be brought in.

Therefore, **B: ale3lan 3n alashya'** is the most accurate answer.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: eda kant hnak nqth tftysh llhjrh (If there is a deportation inspection):** While deportation inspections *can* occur, the text focuses on pre-arrival preparation, not the inspection itself.
* **C: eda kant hnak rqabh jmrkyh (If there is customs surveillance):** Customs surveillance is a possibility, but the text's main point is what *you* need to do *before* arriving, not reacting to existing surveillance.
* **D: eda kant ayun mn alashya' alty jlbtha ghyr msmwhh (If any of the things you brought are prohibited):**  This is a consequence of *not* declaring prohibited items. The text's focus is on declaring beforehand.

The question asks which alliance covers the entire South Pole. The passage then mentions that Star Alliance covers almost everything in the South Pole, with the exception of a specific route.  SkyTeam doesn't cover any of the ocean crossings, and LATAM Oneworld is just one specific flight path and not a full alliance covering the entire region. Therefore, Star Alliance is the closest option to covering the entire South Pole.

This implies that SkyTeam has the *least* coverage of the ocean crossings in the southern hemisphere.  The other options are incorrect because:

mada yjb an yf'el alsa3a eda kan yaml fi awdh r'eyh mmknh llfhd?,"The correct answer is **C: astkhdam almnzar (use binoculars)**.

Here's why:

The text says: ""A7yanan ma takun al-2usud wal fuhud wa nnumur khajula wa yumkinuka ru2yatuhum bi-shakl afdhal bi-istikhdam al-mindhar.""  This translates to: ""Sometimes lions, leopards, and tigers are shy and you can see them better by using binoculars.""

The question asks what to do if you're on a walking safari and might see a leopard. The text directly addresses seeing shy animals like leopards *better* with binoculars.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aldhab fi rhlh sfary llmshy lmsafat twylh (go on a walking safari for long distances):** This is simply describing the activity, not a solution for seeing a leopard.
* **B: aldhab fi nzhh 3la alaqdam (go on a walk):** Again, just describing the activity.
* **D: akhd syarh wastkhdam m3dat qyasyh (take a guide and use measuring equipment):**  While a guide is helpful, the text doesn't mention measuring equipment and the key advice is about seeing shy animals better.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Tamil ba3dh al-7ayawanat, mithil al-fiyala wa zzrafat, ila al-iqtirab min assayarat 3an kathab..."" which translates to ""Some animals, such as zebras and giraffes, approach cars closely...""

Therefore, zebras (alzrafat) are mentioned as animals that might approach cars during a safari.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy sykhfd tklfh aljwlh?","The correct answer is **D: aldhab m3 mjmw'eh mn sth aw akthr** (Traveling with a group of six or more).

Here's why:

The text states: ""fa 7awil muqabalat ashkhas akharin wa takwin majmu3at min arba3 ila sittat ashkhas lil-7usul 3ala si3r afdhal lil-fard."" which translates to ""so try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people to get a better price per person.""  Option D accurately reflects this.

The text also mentions that solo travelers or those with one friend might pay more, and that the practice of offering lower prices for individuals is often a deceptive tactic to make people think they need to pay more. Therefore, traveling in a larger group is the way to get the best deal.
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, mَn mِn almrjh an y'emn afdl s'er lljwlh?","The correct answer is **D: mjmw'eh mn khmsh (a group of five)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""fa 7awil muqabalat ashkhas akharin wa takwin majmu3at min arba3 ila sittat ashkhas lil-7usul 3ala si3r afdhal lil-fard."" This translates to: ""so try to meet other people and form a group of four to six people to get a better price per person.""

While a group of five is within the 4-6 range, it's the closest and most accurate answer among the choices.  The other options are incorrect based on the provided text.

The passage explicitly states: ""Laqad sa3ada taswiruha al-mutakarrir fil musiqa wal aflam wal 2adab wal thaqafa asha3biya fi ja3l al-madina wa ma3alimiha ma3rufa fi jami3 an7a2 al-3alam."" This translates to ""Its frequent depiction in music, films, literature, and popular culture has helped make the city and its landmarks known throughout the world.""

While the other options are true about San Francisco, they aren't directly linked to *global recognition* as strongly as the artistic depictions are. The passage emphasizes the *spread* of San Francisco's image through various art forms.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that San Francisco's economy relies on **diverse sources**, including professional services, government, finance, trade, and tourism.  It doesn't claim that tourism is the *only* source.  Options A, B, and C are all supported by the text.

Here's why:

The text describes how travel agents can help with booking accommodations, transportation, and often include extras like breakfast.  This is most beneficial to someone who doesn't want to handle all the details themselves – an unorganized traveler.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: msafr 'erdh ll'efwyh (traveler looking for discounts):** While travel agents *can* sometimes find discounts, the text focuses on the convenience of booking through them, not solely on price.
* **C: almsafr aldy lm y'emn tashyrth b3d (traveler who hasn't obtained a visa yet):**  Visa requirements are a separate issue and not directly addressed as a reason to use a travel agent.
* **D: msafr yfdl hjz sfqat albaqat (traveler who prefers booking package deals):** The text says travel agents *often* offer package deals, but it doesn't imply that only package deal seekers benefit from their services. The convenience factor is a broader benefit.

Here's why:

The text explicitly mentions that travel agencies can ""al-i7tifadh bil-7ajz min ajlik"" (hold the booking for you), which implies they can also handle and provide travel documents.  The other options are already mentioned in the text:

*   **B: sfqat alfnadq (hotel deals)** - The text says travel agencies often make deals with specific hotels.
*   **C: albaqat alshamlh (comprehensive packages)** - The text mentions that travel agencies usually offer packages including breakfast and transportation.
*   **D: alahtfaz balhjz (holding the booking)** - The text explicitly states that they can hold the booking for you.

Therefore, the only benefit *not* mentioned in the text is the provision of processed travel documents.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: mhrkat altrjmh almuhsnh (improved translation engines)** - While improved engines contribute to better translation, they don't enable offline translation.
* **B: alhwatf aldkyh (smartphones)** - Smartphones are devices that can *use* the offline translation feature, but they aren't the feature itself.
* **D: alttbyqat fi f'eh altrjmh fi alwqt alhqyqy (applications in real-time translation)** - Real-time translation can be online or offline depending on the application and whether language data has been downloaded.  The text focuses on how to enable offline translation.

Icy snow is *sticky*, not a trigger. The text then goes on to list potential triggers.

Let's look at why the other options *are* triggers:

* **B: albshr (humans):** The text mentions ""a7dath tabi3iyya ukhra aw insaniyya"" (other natural events or human ones), indicating humans can be a trigger.
* **C: ash'eh alshms (sun's rays):** The text mentions ""darajat 7arart ashsha,es tatasabba fi taskhin aththalej"" (the temperature of the sun causes the snow to warm up), indicating the sun is a trigger.
* **D: alhtwl althljy aledafy (the snowpack above):** The text states ""ba3ed al thalej al ladhi tamma sa7buhu yumkin an yakun mu7affizan li ma tabaqqa"" (the snow that has been accumulated can be a trigger for what remains).

Therefore, the only option that is *not* a trigger for an ice slide is icy snow.

This directly indicates that sticky, un-triggered snow is the condition that leads to a snowslide. The other options are incorrect based on the text:

*   **B: mnhdrat shdydh alanhdar bdwn thlj (a steep slide without snow):** The passage clearly states snow is necessary for a snowslide.
*   **C: hjm althlj alza'ed 3la almnhdrat shdydh alanhdar (the excess volume of snow on the slide is very steep):** While steepness is mentioned, the passage focuses on the snow's stickiness and lack of triggers.

This translates to: ""In southern India and some other coastal regions of the Indian subcontinent, the use of cashew milk is common.""  Since ""milk"" translates to ""allban"" and cashew milk is a type of milk, the answer is milk.

* **The passage states:** ""Hiya laysat dhakiyya lil ghaya, lidha yajeb an ya2khud al masar in7irafan tawilan 7awla jibal Transantarctic lil wusul ila al hadaba."" This translates to ""It is not very smart, therefore a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains must be taken to reach the plateau.""  The ""it"" refers to the specialized tractors.
* **The passage also describes the terrain:** ""thuluj madghuta ma3a shuquq mamlu2a wa mu3allama bil a3lam"" (compressed snow with filled cracks and marked with flags). This indicates the terrain is difficult and potentially dangerous to navigate with the tractors.
* **Option C directly addresses the reason for the detour:** The tractors' lack of intelligence/sophistication necessitates a longer, more careful route.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ghalbaan ma ytm eghlaq mhth McMurdo** (McMurdo is not usually closed) - While this *might* be true, the passage doesn't mention McMurdo being closed as a reason for the detour.  The main issue is the terrain and the tractors' limitations.
* **B: althlj almdghwt khtyr** (compressed snow is dangerous) -  While the snow *is* dangerous, the passage doesn't explicitly state the danger as the *reason* for the detour. The tractors' inability to navigate safely are the primary driver of the detour.
* **D: enh ashl mn alsfr 'ebr bhr Ross** (it's easier to travel across Ross Sea) - The passage implies the Ross Sea route is *not* easier, but rather the difficult terrain necessitates the detour around the mountains.

It is not very smart, so it is necessary to take a long detour around the Transantarctic Mountains to reach the plateau. **It consists of compressed snow with filled cracks and marked with flags.**""

Therefore, the cracks filled with ice are explicitly mentioned as a characteristic of the South Pole's route. The other options are mentioned but not as a general characteristic of the route itself.

You should consider that although South Africa is stable, not all neighboring countries are. **Unique laws require what you need in terms of documents to be in the car.**)

While the other options are mentioned in the text, they are presented as facts *about* exploring South Africa, not as things the traveler should be *aware of* for a successful trip.  The visa requirements are a crucial practical consideration for anyone traveling to South Africa and potentially exploring neighboring countries.

(You must keep in mind that despite the stability of South Africa, not all neighboring countries are like that.) This is a crucial piece of advice for travelers.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: qd yttlb alqanwn b3d bnwd altwar'e dakhl alsyarh** (The law may require entering the country with the car after certain procedures): While car import procedures are mentioned, this isn't a *primary* piece of advice for sightseeing travelers.

This is misleading.
* **C: y'ed alsfr 'ebr alsyarh amraan ra'e'eaan lawl'ek aldyn yttl'ewn ela alanhraf 3n altrq alnmwdjyh** (Traveling by car is a wonderful thing, but those who deviate from the main roads): This statement is not directly supported by the text and downplays the importance of careful planning.

    * The risk of being searched for drugs using sniffer dogs (implicitly leading to drug charges).
    * The possibility of items being targeted by thieves (A).
    * The possibility of attracting authorities due to bomb threats (implicitly because of potential contents).

* **The text *doesn't* explicitly mention:**
    * **Getting mixed up with someone else's bags (C).** While logically a risk, it's not directly stated in the provided text.

Therefore, option C is the most accurate answer to what is *not* mentioned in the text as a potential danger.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly mentions that authorities can use drug-sniffing dogs at any time without prior notice.** This implies they have the right to search luggage.
* **Option D directly reflects this possibility of confiscation.** The text states luggage belonging to absent owners is a target for theft and can also attract the attention of authorities concerned with explosives. While not directly about drugs, it highlights that luggage can be subject to search and confiscation regardless of its contents.
* **Option A is correct:** The text states severe punishments, even for first-time offenses, can include imprisonment for over 10 years or the death penalty.
* **Option B is correct:** The text repeatedly emphasizes the need for increased caution when traveling internationally.
* **Option C is correct:** The text explicitly mentions that drug-sniffing dogs can be used without prior notice.

Therefore, while multiple options are correct, option D is the most comprehensive and directly implied consequence of the information provided in the text regarding luggage and authorities.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Imla2 manzilaka bi qahwa ghaniyya saba7an..."" which translates to ""Fill your home with rich coffee in the morning..."" This implies coffee is something you *have* in the house, but it doesn't say you *make* it at home.  The text also mentions ""shay al babunij al muhaddi2 fi laylan"" (caffeinated licorice tea at night), which is something made.

The question asks what drink is *not* mentioned as something you make at home.  Since coffee is only mentioned as being *present* in the home, and not necessarily made there, and the text does mention making licorice tea, coffee is the best answer.

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: esyr (tea)** - The text explicitly mentions ""shay al babunij"" (licorice tea).
*   **C: j'eh (juice)** - The text mentions ""kaseb al mazid min al waqet lil 3adid min al-ashya2 al-mumayyaza"" (gain more time for many special things) and suggests making juices as an adventure.

This translates to: ""If you live in a city with a diverse drinking culture, then go to the cafes located in neighborhoods you don't usually visit.""

Option C directly reflects this advice. The other options are less specific or not mentioned in the text.

This means a student visa generally requires proof of sufficient funds, along with an acceptance letter from the educational institution.

Options A, B, and C are incorrect because:

* **A: tashyrh al'eml (work visa)** requires proof of employment, not funds for study.
* **B: tashyrh syahyh (tourist visa)** doesn't require proof of funds for a long stay, and is for short visits, not studying.

Tatallab ta2shirat attulab bi shaklin 3am shurut wa ijra2at taqdim mukhtalifa 3an ta2shirat assuyya7 aw rijal al a3mal al 3adiyya.""  This translates to: ""Residency, in general, in any foreign country to obtain a visa in advance for a long period is required. Student visas in general require different conditions and procedures for submission than tourist visas or ordinary businessmen.""

The text emphasizes the *different* and *more complex* requirements for international student visas compared to tourist or business visas. Therefore, an international student is the one who would need a lengthy explanation regarding visa requirements.

It specifically states ""yajeb an tatwa55a ashad al-7adhar min al-ba3udh idha qarrarta al-tanazzuh 3abra al-ghabat al-matira"" which translates to ""You must exercise the utmost caution from a distance if you decide to wander through the rain forest.""

While the text mentions caution even while driving, the overarching theme is the danger of the rain forest itself. Therefore, the safest time to be particularly cautious (given the context) is *when you are in the rain forest*.

This translates to: ""Even if you are driving your car through the rain forest, even if it is like a flat area, in a few seconds with the doors open while you are entering the car, it is enough for someone to jump into the car with you.""

This means leaving the doors open, even briefly, while driving in the rainforest (especially a flat area) poses a risk of someone jumping into the car, potentially leading to danger.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alqyadh khlal alsyf** (Driving during the day): The text doesn't mention anything about driving during the day. The danger is related to the rainforest environment, not the time of day.
* **C: alqyadh 'ebr almnatq shbh alastwa'eyh** (Driving through a flat area similar to a plateau): The text *does* mention driving through a flat area similar to a plateau, but it's not the *reason* for the danger. The danger is the open doors.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, mn almrjh an ykwn ldyh fhm mhdwd 3la alaql llghh alenklyzyh?","The correct answer is **A: alashkhas aldyn yt7dthwn lghtyn akhryyn 3la alaql (People who speak at least two other languages)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tata7addath al-3adid min adduwal bi-akmaliha al-ingliziya bi-talaqa, wa 7atta akthar min dhalik yumkinuka 2an tatawaqqa3 ma7duda - khassatan bayna ashabab **al-3anawin, wa allaty ghaliban ma yas3ub nutquha bi-wudhu7**.""  This means English is widely spoken, and you can expect a limited understanding, *especially among people with accents (and who likely speak other languages)*.

The example with the men from different countries further emphasizes this point. They are speaking in their own languages, and while English is used, there's still a distinct cultural flavor and local expressions.

Therefore, the passage suggests a limited understanding of English is probable *when interacting with people who speak other languages*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **B: alashkhas alasghr snaan (Younger people)**: The passage doesn't directly link age to limited English understanding.
*   **C: alashkhas almsafrwn ela twrntw (People traveling to Toronto)**:  Traveling to Toronto doesn't inherently mean limited English proficiency.  Toronto is a multicultural city where many people speak different languages.
*   **D: alashkhas alakbr snaan (Older people)**: The passage doesn't make a connection between age and limited English.



"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma aldy ys'eb ntqh?","The correct answer is **B: al3nawyn (titles)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Yantabiqu hadha al-2amr bi-shaklin khas 3ala al-3anawin, wa allaty ghaliban ma yas3ub nutquha bi-wudhu7."" which translates to ""This matter applies in a special way to titles, and which are often difficult to pronounce clearly.""

While other options are related to language, the text specifically links the difficulty in pronunciation to titles. Therefore, option B is the most accurate.

"wfqaan llfa8arh, ma hw alsynaryw almthaly llmsafr aldy ykhtt lrkwb haflh mn alma7ta aldakhlyh byn almnatq?","The correct answer is **A: almsafr almtjh ela Jakar wqd ashtra balf'el tdkrh mn qbl** (The traveler heading to Jakar and has indeed purchased a ticket in advance).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Nadharan li 2anna al-7afilat bayna al-manatiq ghaliban ma takunu mumtali2a, fa min al-musta7san shira2 tadhkira qabla ayam qalila."" (Because intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to purchase a ticket a few days in advance.)

The text also mentions that buses heading east and to Jakar depart between 06:30 and 07:30.  Therefore, a traveler going to Jakar should purchase a ticket in advance to ensure a seat.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: almsafr almtjh ela Bumthang wyhtaj ela almghadrh bhlwl 7** (The traveler heading to Bumthang and needs to leave 7 hours early) - The text doesn't mention needing to leave 7 hours early for Bumthang. It only states buses head east and to Jakar between 6:30-7:30.
* **C: almsafr almtjh ela Paro wyhtaj ela almghadrh b3d 11** (The traveler heading to Paro and needs to leave after 11) - The text doesn't mention needing to leave after 11 for Paro.
* **D: almsafr almtjh shrqaan wysl ela alma7ta qbl alsa3a 6:20** (The traveler heading east and arrives at the bus station before 6:20) - While arriving early is good, the text highlights the *necessity of pre-purchasing a ticket* for east-bound buses, not just arriving early.



"

The text states: ""Nadharan li 2anna al-7afilat bayna al-manatiq ghaliban ma takunu mumtali2a, fa min al-musta7san shira2 tadhkira qabla ayam qalila."" which translates to ""Given that intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to book a ticket a few days in advance.""

The question asks for good advice for someone traveling east from the inner station. The text specifies that most buses heading east (and to Thimphu/Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30, but they are often full. Therefore, booking in advance is the best advice.
"
ay mma yly lys wsfaan dqyqaan le Timbuktu?,"The correct answer is **C: la ymkn alwswl elyha balta'erh (it's impossible to reach by plane)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Ila janib 3adm imkaniyat al-wusul ilayha nisbiyan, asba7at """"Timbuktu"""" tustakhdam ka isti3ara lil aradhy al-ghariba al-ba3ida."" (Alongside the relative difficulty of reaching it, ""Timbuktu"" has become used as a metaphor for strange, distant lands.) This implies it *is* reachable, just not easily.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate descriptions:

* **A: ldyha tathyr 'erby akthr mn bqyh alblad (it has a more Arab character than the rest of the country):** The text directly says, ""Al-madina fi tanaqud sarikh ma3a baqiyat mudun al-bilad, li-annaha tatamayaz bi-tabi3 3araby akthar min kawniha ifriqiya."" (The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it is characterized by a more Arab character than being African.)
* **B: enha t'eany mn alfqr (it suffers from poverty):** The text says, ""enha t'eany mn alfqr"" (it suffers from poverty).
* **D: la tzal 3aml jdb llsyah alfdwlyyn (it still attracts international tourists):** The text mentions, ""Baqat PBS fi tanaqud sarikh ma3a baqiyat mudun al-bilad, li-annaha tatamayaz bi-tabi3 3araby akthar min kawniha ifriqiya."" (PBS remained in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it was characterized by a more Arab character than being African.) And it goes on to say it's a metaphor for distant lands, implying it's known and visited.



Therefore, only option C is demonstrably incorrect based on the provided text.



"
ay mn alhqa'eq altalyh 3n Timbuktu shyh?,"The correct answer is **C: lha tab'e afryqy aql mn almdn almhyth** (It has a more Arab character than the cities of the country).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Al-madina fi tanaqud sarikh ma3a baqiyat mudun al-bilad, li-annaha tatamayaz bi-tabi3 3araby akthar min kawniha ifriqiya.""  This translates to ""The city is in stark contrast with the rest of the country's cities, because it is characterized by a more Arab character than being African.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ymkn alwswl ela almdynh balta'erh** (It is possible to reach the city by plane): The text mentions that Timbuktu is a destination for tourists and has a airport, but it doesn't specifically state that it's reachable *by plane*. It mentions the desert sands as a hazard in 1990, suggesting travel might have been challenging.
* **B: hy ghrybh akthr mn kwnha fqyrh** (It is stranger than being poor):  The text states that Timbuktu is poor (""ghrybh akthr mn kwnha fqyrh"" is a misinterpretation). It does note that it's a contrast to other cities, but the focus is on its Arab character.
* **D: lm t'ed almdynh tjdb alsyah** (The city did not attract tourism): The text states the opposite: ""Li-annaha tatamayaz bi-tabi3 3araby akthar min kawniha ifriqiya."" This implies it *does* attract tourists.



"

The text states: ""Satuqam al-al3ab ashibh olimpiya fil fatra min 24 August ila 5 September 2021."" This translates to ""The Asian Games will be held from August 24 to September 5, 2021.""
"
"wfqaan llfa8arh, fi ay nqth ysbh ale3sar alqm3y e3saraan?","The correct answer is **D: بعد ملامس الأرض (After touching the ground)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tabda2 ka mamarrat tahbut min al ghuyum al 3asifa, thumma tusbi7 """"a3asir"""" 3inda lamsiha lil ared."" which translates to ""It begins as a descent path from storm clouds, then it becomes """"violent"""" when it touches the ground.""

Option D directly reflects this statement.  The passage clearly indicates that the phenomenon becomes particularly violent *after* it makes contact with the ground. Options A, B, and C describe earlier stages of the phenomenon, not the point when it becomes especially violent.
"

Here's why:

* **The original text explicitly states:** ""Tuwalled riya7 3atiya (a7yanan 100-200 mil bissa3a)..."" which translates to ""It generates strong winds (sometimes 100-200 miles per hour)...""
* **Option A directly reflects this key characteristic.**
* **Option B is incorrect:** The text says it *can* lift things, not that it *doesn't* move heavy things.
* **Option C is correct but not the *most* precise answer:** While it's true the storm becomes ""abrasive"" upon hitting the ground, the defining feature mentioned in the text is the strong wind speed.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The text describes it as drawing in air, not pushing it outwards.

Therefore, Option A is the most accurate and directly supported by the original description of the desert storm (al-easar).

The text explicitly states: ""Qad targhab aydhan fi rruju3 ila mashurat 7ukumat bi-khilaf 7ukumatik..."" which translates to ""You may also want to refer to the advice of the government other than your own government...""  This implies seeking advice from the government of the destination country.

Option B is incorrect because the text warns against relying solely on the summarized advice in the travel consultation. Option C is incorrect because the advice is typically for citizens of the destination country, not travelers in general. Option D is incorrect because while the traveler's own government might offer advice, the text specifically encourages looking at the government of the destination country.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that travel advisories are ""مجرد ملخص موجز للوضع السياسي في بلد واحد"" (just a brief summary of the political situation in one country).
* It also mentions that the information provided is often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
* Option B directly reflects this description of a travel advisory as a concise summary of the political situation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: tamyn alelgha' almtathr** (affected cancellation insurance): While the passage mentions the possibility of needing cancellation insurance, it doesn't describe *what* a travel advisory is in relation to it.
* **C: altamyn alshy almtathr** (affected health insurance): Similar to option A, health insurance is mentioned as a possible need, but it's not what the passage describes as a travel advisory.
* **D: m3lwmat mfslh 3n alhalh alsyasyh fi albld** (detailed information about the political situation in the country): The passage *contradicts* this option by stating that travel advisories are *not* detailed.

Here's why:

The text states that travel agencies are particularly helpful for:

*   **Travel experiences beyond the traveler's previous experience:** This implies first-time international travel would fall into this category.
*   **Travel related to nature, culture, language, or low-income countries.** While not explicitly stated as the *most* likely, a first trip abroad often involves exploring new cultures, languages, and potentially unfamiliar environments.

The other options are less likely to necessitate a travel agent:

*   **A: Travel to a familiar place where the traveler has been before:** This doesn't require assistance.
*   **B: A two-week trip with a limited budget:** While a travel agent *could* help with budget travel, it's not the primary reason someone would seek assistance.
*   **C: A trip involving cancellation:**  A travel agent would be useful *during* the cancellation process, but not the primary reason to seek booking assistance.



"

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents often specialize in certain types of travel, budgets, or destinations. Option B directly aligns with this point.  If a traveler wants something beyond a standard package (like a specific adventure, cultural experience, language immersion, or trip to a less-visited country), a specialized travel agent would be most beneficial.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: 3ndma yhjz almsafr rhlat dhab weyab lzyarh msqt rash (When the traveler books a round trip to visit a popular destination):**  While a travel agent *can* assist with this, it's not where they offer the most unique value. A traveler can easily book this themselves.
* **C: 3ndma yjyd almsafr allghh alam lwjhh alejazh (When the traveler finds the language of the destination difficult):** While a travel agent *might* be able to help with this (e.g., find a language immersion trip), it's not the primary reason to use one.  The traveler could research language learning resources independently.
* **D: 3ndma yzwr almsafr mwq'eaan tkwn fyh alakhtlafat althqafyh malwfh lh (When the traveler visits locations with significant cultural differences):** A travel agent *can* be helpful with this, but again, not as much as for a specialized trip.  The traveler could research cultural norms and etiquette themselves.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate reflection of the passage's advice.

Here's why:

The text emphasizes that travelers should be prepared for differences in customs, rules, and other aspects compared to their home country.  It specifically states that failing to consider these differences can lead to disappointment or even offense. Option A directly reflects this by suggesting the traveler should *expect* these differences.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: alrghbh fi tjrbh alat'emh ghyr almalwfh (willingness to try unfamiliar food):** While experiencing local cuisine is part of travel, it's not directly related to avoiding disappointment based on cultural differences.
* **C: alaltzam bnfs alqwanyn almwjwdh fi almkan aldy yatwn mnh (adhere to the same laws existing in the place they come from):** The text explicitly says the traveler shouldn't expect the *same* laws, rules, and customs.  This is the opposite of what option C suggests.
* **D: tjnb albhth almsbq 3n alskn (avoid pre-searching for accommodation):**  Pre-searching for accommodation is a practical travel tip, but it's not directly connected to understanding and respecting cultural differences.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that when traveling, you shouldn't expect things to be ""as they are in your country."" It emphasizes differences in customs, rules, behavior, etc.  Someone who dislikes change would be *most likely* to be disappointed when encountering these differences. They'd be resistant to adapting and might find the new environment frustrating.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: shkhs yhb alat'emh alghrybh (a person who loves strange food):**  The text doesn't mention food.  A love of trying new food would likely *enhance* the travel experience, not cause disappointment.
* **C: shkhs mnghlq aldhn (a shy person/introvert):** While introverts might find new environments overwhelming initially, the text's primary focus is on adapting to cultural differences, not on personality traits like introversion.
* **D: shkhs ystmt'e balt'elm (a person who enjoys learning):** The text suggests a need for awareness and learning. Someone who enjoys learning would likely embrace the new experiences and adapt more easily.

Here's why:

The text explicitly warns **against** sleeping on the ground in areas where local animals are unknown.  Option A suggests *learning* about these animals *before* sleeping, which is the opposite of the warning. The text emphasizes taking precautions *because* of the unknown animals.

Let's look at why the other options are supported by the text:

* **B: tjnb alsrf bkthrh 3la alt3am khlal ayamk alqlylh alawla** (Avoid excessive eating during your first few days) - The text recommends sticking to Western food, suggesting caution with unfamiliar local cuisine.
* **C: ywsa bsryr atfal aw arjwhh shbkyh fi halh altkhyym** (Bring a cot or metal frame for camping) - The text explicitly advises using a cot or metal frame when camping to stay away from pests.
* **D: alastthmar fi fndq 'ealy aljwdh 3nd wswlk lawl mrh** (Invest in a high-quality hotel upon arrival) - The text recommends staying in Western-style hotels, implying that this is a safe and comfortable option for first-time visitors.



Therefore, only option A contradicts the advice given in the text.

Here's why:

The text specifically advises taking a sleeping bag or a metal frame (to elevate you off the ground) when camping in areas with unknown local animals.  This is presented as a safety precaution.  

While the other options (western food, quality services, and quality hotels) are mentioned as things that can help with acclimatization, they are not presented as *essential safety items* to be concerned about *more than anything else* when adjusting to a developing country.  The sleeping arrangements are directly linked to safety.



Therefore, the text emphasizes taking a sleeping bag or mattress for safety reasons, making option C the correct answer.

This translates to: ""If you are traveling with a laptop or tablet, then store a copy in its memory or hard drive (you can access it without internet).""

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

The text explicitly states that you need to be able to *show* the email address to the insurance company.  It doesn't say you need to show it *on the phone*. The other options (phone numbers for consultation/authorization and for submitting claims) are all listed as necessary to have readily available.

Option C accurately reflects this. Option D is technically correct for the dimensions, but it's referring to the *format* (35mm film) not the negative size.  The question asks for the size of the *negative*. The text doesn't directly state the negative size, but it implies the format (35mm) is the most common, and negatives are made from the film.

This translates to ""The size of the standard film strip is 35 mm (36 × 24 mm) and it is the most common. ... it gives a precision approximately similar to a current DSLR camera.""

1. **Mastering the coordination and editing of content on the web (writing the blog).**
2. **Then, potentially creating your own website.**

Therefore, writing the blog is the logical first step to build experience and a portfolio before considering a standalone website.  The other options are subsequent steps, not the starting point.

This translates to: ""For example, by obtaining a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply to obtain a visa for each member state in Schengen separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.""

While options B (saving money) and C (avoiding multiple border checks) are *benefits* of Schengen, they aren't the *primary* advantage.  The most significant advantage, and what the text highlights, is avoiding multiple visa applications. Option D is incorrect because a passport is still required.

This translates to: ""During the rainy season (starting from November to March), the water level will rise and the waterfall will be more intense and violent. We assure you that you will get wet if you cross the bridge or walk through the paths near the waterfall. And on the other hand, due to the rise in water level, specifically, your view of the actual waterfall will be obscured by water!""

Therefore, to have an unobstructed view, travelers should visit *outside* the rainy season. Options A, B, and C all describe conditions that would *obstruct* the view.

We confirm that you will get wet if you cross the bridge or walk through the exposed passages near the waterfall. On the other hand, due to the rise in water level, specifically, your view of the actual waterfall will be obscured by water!)

This means that visiting between November and March will result in a *blocked view* of the waterfall. Therefore, to see the waterfall *without any obstruction*, you should avoid visiting during this season.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""**atta7liq ta2ira bidun tayar bil qurb min matar aw fawq 7ashd min annas fikra sayyi2a, 7atta law lam yakun dhalika mukhalifan lil qanun fi mintaqatik.**""  This translates to: ""Flying a drone close to an airport or over a crowd of people is a bad idea, even if it's not illegal in your area.""

Option D directly contradicts this warning. The passage discourages flying near crowds, and suggests minimizing the drone's visibility.

Let's look at why the other options are *not* the best answers:

* **A: althqq msbqaan mma yusmh lk btswyrh (Checking beforehand what you are allowed to film):** This is *encouraged* by the passage.  ""**ta7aqaq musbaqan mimma yusma7 laka bi taswirihi...**"" means ""Check beforehand what you are allowed to film...""
* **B: alhswl 3la trkhys edafy (Obtaining additional permits):** This is also *encouraged* by the passage. ""**alhswl 3la trkhys edafy**"" is mentioned as part of the requirements.
* **C: albhth 7wl altsaryh (Researching permits):** Similar to B, researching permits is necessary and not discouraged.

Therefore, option D is the only one that reflects a discouraged practice based on the passage's warnings.

Here's why:

The provided text emphasizes the following points regarding drone photography:

* **Respect for privacy and avoiding disturbance:** The text strongly discourages flying drones near crowds of people, even if it's not explicitly illegal.  The primary concern is avoiding disturbing others.
* **Obtaining permission:** The text highlights the need to check regulations and obtain any required permits before flying a drone.

Option A aligns with these principles. Flying near a crowd that wouldn't be bothered by a drone prioritizes minimizing disturbance. Options B, C, and D are directly contradicted by the text's warnings about crowds and the need for permits.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""في العديد من البلدان التي يوجد بها مثل هذا القانون، تتوالى الفنادق المحلية عمليات التسجيل"" (In many countries where such a law exists, local hotels handle the registration process).  It also mentions that registration is *not* required for those staying outside tourist areas.  This directly contradicts option B.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: eda knt tqym fi amakn eqamh syahyh, fqd la thtaj ela altsjyl** (If you are staying in tourist areas, you may not need to register) - This is directly supported by the text.
* **C: qd tkwn hnak hajh lzyarh mkatb alhjrh** (There may be a need to visit the immigration office) - The text mentions this possibility (""في حالات أخرى، لا تشتريت عمليات التسجيل إلا لمن يقيمون خارج أماكن الإقامة السياحية"" - In other cases, registration is only required for those staying outside tourist accommodations).
* **D: fi b3d alamakn, ymkn llfnadq almhlyh alt3aml m3 altsjyl** (In some places, local hotels can deal with registration) -  This is directly stated in the text (""تتوالى الفنادق المحلية عمليات التسجيل"" - local hotels handle the registration process).

* The text mentions that local hotels often handle registration.
* It also mentions registering with local authorities (like the local police or immigration offices) *if* you're not staying in tourist accommodations.
* **The text does not mention the local post office as a place to handle registration.**

Therefore, the local post office is the option that is *not* mentioned as a possible location for registration.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that volunteering while traveling is not primarily about financial gain. While some opportunities offer room and board and low stipends, the core benefits are cultural immersion, personal growth, meeting new people, and gaining new skills.  

Option B directly contradicts this.  Someone seeking a large salary is focused on financial reward, which is not the main reason the passage presents volunteering as a good travel activity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: shkhs yaml fi tkwyn sdaqat jdydh syf'el dlk fi alkharj** (A person who enjoys forming new friendships will do so abroad): The passage explicitly mentions meeting new people as a benefit.
* **C: shkhs yaml fi aktsab mharh jdydh** (A person who enjoys acquiring new skills): The passage states that learning to respect different viewpoints and gaining new skills are benefits.
* **D: shkhs qd ykwn mhtmaan balghrfh walmakl** (A person who might be interested in room and board and food): The passage mentions that many volunteering positions *do* provide room and board and food, and some even pay low salaries.  This person might find it appealing.

This translates to: ""It can also be a good way to increase your budget to allow for a longer stay in a place, despite the fact that many volunteer jobs provide accommodation and meals...""

Options A and B are incorrect because the text doesn't claim accommodation is *always* provided (A) or that volunteering *always* leads to job opportunities (B). Option D is a secondary benefit, but the text specifically highlights accommodation and meals as budget-saving factors.

This means spending the *entire* trip on Disney properties is a key part of the ""average"" Disney trip. Options A, B, and D describe things that *could* be part of a Disney trip, but aren't necessarily defining characteristics of the ""average"" experience.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: **""attazakir ghayr qabila lil intiqal ila ghayrik.""** (Tickets are not transferable to others.) This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the text:

* **B: yutah skn fi almwq'e** (Accommodation is available on the premises):  The text says: **""wa ba3da dhalika ya2ty maw3id al-3awda ila al-watan.""** (and after that comes the date of return to the homeland), implying a stay. The entire description is about a trip *to* Disney World, which necessitates accommodation.
* **C: hnak haflat mtahh lnql almsafryn mn almtar ela al'eqar** (There are buses available to transport travelers from the airport to the accommodation): The text mentions: **""Yatimmu istikhdam al-3adid min attadhakir allaty yatimmu bay3uha 3abra al-internet min khilal mawaqiع al-mazadat mithl eBay aw Craigslist juz2iyan ka tadhakir Park-hopper muta3addidat al-ayam.""** (Many tickets are used which are sold online through auction sites like eBay or Craigslist partially as multi-day Park Hopper tickets).

(Everyone planning a trip to a war zone should get professional training...and this is usually done through practical experience. The course usually takes from two to five days and will include role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.)

The text then contrasts this with the limited availability of publications focusing on war zones: ""Kutub wa almajallat alaty tatanawal baqa2 al7ayat albariya sha2i3a, lakina almanshurat alaty tatanawal manatiq al7arb qalila."" (Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are common, but publications dealing with war zones are scarce.)

Therefore, the training and publications focus on the specific skills and preparedness needed for *war zones*.  Options B (first aid), D (role-playing), and A (survival in the wilderness) are mentioned as *components* of the training, but the overarching topic is preparedness for war zones.

This translates to: ""The course usually lasts from two to five days and will include role-playing, a lot of primary weapons, and sometimes training on weapons.""

The other options are either mentioned as generally available literature or are not directly linked to the course content as described. While the course might touch upon conflict zones, the primary focus according to the text is on practical skills, specifically weapons training.

Here's why:

* **The text emphasizes that different purification methods are effective against different contaminants.** It states that boiling for one minute might suffice in some areas, while other areas require several minutes.
* **The text also suggests purchasing bottled water from a reputable company if you are concerned.** This implies that the water source might not be safe.
* **Option D directly addresses the core issue: identifying the specific contaminants present.** Knowing the contaminants allows you to choose the *most effective* purification method.

Let's look at why the other options are not the best:

* **A: an yughla alma' l'edh dqa'eq (boil water for several minutes):** While boiling is a common method, the text indicates that the required boiling time varies depending on the contaminants.  It doesn't specify the optimal time.
* **B: shira2 almyah alm3bah fi zjajat (buy bottled water):**  This is a safe option, but it doesn't address the situation where bottled water might not be available or affordable. It's also not a proactive purification method if you want to use the existing water source.
* **C: an yughla alma' lmdh dqyqh wahdh (boil water for one minute):** This is only suitable for areas where the water is relatively safe and the contaminants are easily destroyed by one minute of boiling. It's not a universally effective solution.



Therefore, the best approach, according to the text's logic, is to **test the water to identify the specific contaminants present** and then choose the appropriate purification method.

Here's why:

The text states: ""بالتوبولوجيا تحت الماء، يتركز التدفق العائد إلى بعض أقسام أعمق ويمكن أن يتشكل تيار سريع إلى المياه العميقة هناك."" (Due to the underwater topology, the return flow concentrates in some deeper sections and a fast current can form to the deep water there.)

This implies that areas near coral reefs are likely to experience these concentrated currents and fast flows. The text goes on to say that most fatalities occur trying to swim against the current. Therefore, avoiding these areas is recommended.

Options B, C, and D are less likely based on the provided text:

*   **B: alsbahh fi almyah al'emyqh (swimming in deep water)** - While deep water *can* have strong currents, the text specifically mentions concentrated currents in *some* deeper sections, and coral reefs seem to be part of those sections.
*   **C: alsbahh 'eks altyar (swimming against the current)** - The text explicitly warns against this.
*   **D: alsbahh 7wl alamwaj (swimming around waves)** - While waves can create currents, the text focuses on the currents formed by the underwater topography.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""أغلب حالات الوفاة ناتجة عن الإرهاق في محاولات السباحة عكس التيار، والذي قد يكون أمرًا مستحيلاً."" (Most cases of death result from exhaustion in attempts to swim against the current, which may be impossible.)

It further advises: ""بمجرد خروجك من التيار، فإن السباحة للخلف لن تكون أصعب من المعتاد."" (Once you exit the current, swimming backwards will not be more difficult than usual.)

Therefore, swimming in the opposite direction of the current is the recommended action. Options A and B are incorrect because they suggest trying to swim *with* the current or swimming *faster* against it, both of which are dangerous and counterproductive. Option D is irrelevant.

    * **D: astkhdm alqwh 3nd aldrwrh (Use force when necessary):** The text advises being *resolute in rejecting men* and *not being afraid of defending your position*, but it doesn't recommend using force. It prioritizes assertive communication over physical confrontation.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: edrak anh mn ghyr almalwf atba'eha (Realize that it is not customary to follow her):** While it's good to be aware of cultural norms, the passage doesn't focus on *following* a woman. It focuses on responding to unwanted attention.

The passage states: ""al 3amal fil kharij fi 3umum al amer ya3ni annahu yajeb 3alayka taqdim daribat addakhel fi addawla al lati tuqim biha"" which translates to ""working abroad in general means that you must pay the income tax in the country where you reside.""

Since the question asks where to pay taxes if you're working abroad but present in another location, and the passage emphasizes paying taxes in the country of residence, option C is the most accurate. While the country where you work might have some involvement, the *residence* is the key factor for tax obligations.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: aynma tkwn mwjwd 'eadhan (wherever you are present legally):** While being present legally is relevant, the passage focuses on residency.

* **C: ymkn an tstmr alahdath hta sth ashhr (Events can last up to six months)** - The text states: ""Tasـtamirru hadhihi al-fa3aliyat 3adatan ma bayna thalath wa sittat ashhur..."" (This activity usually lasts between three and six months...).

ay mma yly hw qa'edh m3rd 'ealmy aw m3rd dwly?,"The correct answer is **C: yjb an tstmr alahdath hta sth ashhur** (Events must last for at least six months).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Tasـtamirru hadhihi al-fa3aliyat 3adatan ma bayna thalath wa sittat ashhur..."" (This activity usually lasts between three and six months...).  This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: yjb an t'erd al'erwd tarykh aldwlh wqdaya al'ealm** (Exhibitions must display the history of the country and global issues) - While the text says exhibitions *can* cover these topics, it's not a mandatory requirement. The purpose is broader.
* **B: la ymkn lnfs albld astdafh alahdath 3la asas snwy** (A country cannot host events on a yearly basis) - The text indicates events *do* occur annually in different countries, just not necessarily in the same country every year.
* **D: lky ynzm alm3rd, yjb an tshark fyh jmy'e albldan** (To organize the exhibition, all countries must participate) - The text doesn't mention that all countries *must* participate.  Participation is voluntary.

alqyam bay mma yly syqll mn ahtmalyh wqw'e hjwm hywan?,"The correct answer is **D: rd'e al7ywanat bfdlat alt3am (Feeding animals).**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""wala yanbaghy it3am hadhihi al-7ayawanat aw iz3ajiha"" (and it is not permissible to feed these animals or disturb them).  Feeding animals is a direct cause of them approaching humans and potentially attacking.

Let's look at why the other options are less relevant:

* **A: hml ala'eshab al'etryh (Carrying fragrant herbs):** While the text mentions avoiding strong smells, fragrant herbs are not specifically cited as a risk factor.
* **B: ezalh alqmamh mn mwq'e almkhym (Removing garbage from the campsite):**  This is good practice for hygiene but not a primary cause of animal attacks according to the text.
* **C: alhfaz 3la msafh 25 yardh mn ald'eab (Maintaining a distance of 25 yards from the cubs):** This is important, but the text emphasizes the general danger of getting too close to *any* animal, not just cubs.  And feeding can cause animals of any size to approach.



Therefore, feeding animals (option D) is the most direct and cited reason for a potential animal attack in the provided text.

ay mma yly lm ydkr fi alfa8arh ksbb mhtml lhjmat alhyah albryh?,"The correct answer is **C: et3am alhyah albryh (Feeding wild animals)**.

The text explicitly states: ""wala yanbaghy it3am hadhihi al-7ayawanat aw iz3ajiha"" which translates to ""and it is not permissible to feed these animals or disturb them.""  The text also mentions that feeding can cause attacks.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: alrwa'i7 alqwyh (Strong smells):**  The text directly mentions that strong smells attract animals.
* **B: edm alhfaz 3la almsafh (Maintaining distance):** The text details specific distances to maintain from different animals.
* **D: al7ywanat ghyr almtalfh m3 albshr (Non-harmful animals with humans):** The text acknowledges that even seemingly non-harmful animals (like deer and rabbits) can attack.
