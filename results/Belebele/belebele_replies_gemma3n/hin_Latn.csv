"Passage ke hisab se, accordion ache se bajaane ki kaun si sabse sahi tip nhi kehlayegi?","The correct answer is **D: Atirikt volume praapt karne ke liye apni gati badhayein** (To get extra volume, increase your speed).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that to get extra volume on the accordion, you should use your elbow with more pressure or speed. However, it doesn't say to simply *increase your speed* of the keys themselves.  The emphasis is on using the elbow for added power, not necessarily faster finger movements.

Let's look at why the other options *are* good tips according to the passage:

* **A: Zyada aawaaz ke liye kunji ko zyada dabaav ke saath dabaayein** (Press the keys with more pressure for more volume): This is directly mentioned in the passage, contrasting it with the piano.
* **B: Apna stamina barkarar rakhne ke liye bevajah ka movement kam se kam karein** (Minimize unnecessary movement to maintain stamina): This aligns with the passage's advice to be as steady as possible and avoid excessive finger movement.
* **C: Sthir hath rakhte hue notes bajate hue dhyan dein** (Pay attention while playing notes with a steady hand): This is a core principle outlined in the passage.



Therefore, increasing speed isn't the *best* or most accurate tip for getting volume on the accordion according to the passage."
"Accordion bajate hue, inmein se kya volume ko badhane mein madad karega?","The correct answer is **B: Zyada dabaav (More pressure)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Accordion par, atirikt volume praapt karne ke liye, aap kuhni ka upyog adhik dabaav ya gati ke saath karte hain.""  This translates to ""On the accordion, to obtain extra volume, you use the elbow with more pressure or speed.""

While speed (A) *can* contribute, the text directly links increased volume to *more pressure*.  The other options are incorrect as the text suggests slower finger movement (not faster) and doesn't mention less pressure increasing volume.
"
Television par dikhne wali images ki seemaayein kyu cut jaati hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Image puri screen par dikhe (Image covers the entire screen)**.

The passage explicitly states that televisions are designed to ensure the image covers the entire screen, even if it means cutting off the edges. This is what overscan is. Therefore, the reason for the image's borders being cut off is to ensure the image fills the entire screen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Subtitles dikh jaye (Subtitles become visible):**  The passage says overscan *can* hide subtitles, not that it's done *to* make them visible.
* **C: Dusre formats mein aasaani se conversion ke liye (For easy conversion to other formats):** The passage doesn't mention conversion as the reason for overscan.
* **D: Nichle bhaag ke atyadhik pas subtitles cut ho (Subtitles close to the bottom are cut):** While this is a consequence of overscan, it's not the *reason* for the cut-off borders. The primary reason is to fill the entire screen.

"Passage ke hisaab se, movie to DVD format mein badalne mein kisi bhi vyakti ko inmein se kaun si dikkat aa sakti hain?","सही उत्तर है **A: Aisi image jo puri screen par na dikhe** और **D: Seemaayein cut jayein**।

यहां स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

* **A: Aisi image jo puri screen par na dikhe:** अनुच्छेद स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि ओवरस्कैन के कारण, टीवी स्क्रीन में ऊपर, नीचे और दाएं-बाएं किनारे कटे होते हैं, जिससे छवि पूरी स्क्रीन पर दिखाई नहीं देती।

* **D: Seemaayein cut jayein:** अनुच्छेद में ओवरस्कैन को टीवी को यह सुनिश्चित करने के लिए डिज़ाइन किया गया बताया गया है कि छवि पूरी स्क्रीन को कवर करे। DVD में परिवर्तित करते समय, यह अक्सर ऐसा होता है कि सीमाएं कट जाती हैं, जिससे छवि का हिस्सा कट जाता है।

* **B: Aadhe cut hue subtitles:** अनुच्छेद में यह बताया गया है कि यदि उपशीर्षक स्क्रीन के निचले भाग के बहुत करीब हैं, तो वे पूरी तरह से दिखाई नहीं देंगे। इसका मतलब है कि उपशीर्षक का आधा भाग कट सकता है, न कि आधा कट हुआ।

* **C: Aisi image jo puri screen par dikhe:** अनुच्छेद का विपरीत यह बताता है। ओवरस्कैन का उद्देश्य यह सुनिश्चित करना है कि छवि पूरी स्क्रीन पर दिखाई न दे।
"
British garrison kahan istith tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bordentown**.

The passage states: ""General John Cadwalder apne kisi bhi sudrindikaran ko band karne ke liye Bordentown mein british garrison ke khilaaf ek dhyan aakarshit karne waale hamle k shuruat karenge.""  This clearly indicates the British garrison was located in Bordentown.
"
Hath se likhe masaude par kiske hastakshar kiye gaye the?,"The correct answer is **D: Charles Thomson**.

The passage states: ""4 July ko Congress dwara apanaaye jaane ke baad, ek haath se likhe gaye masaude par congress ke adhyaksh John Hancock aur sachiv **Charles Thomson** dwara hastakshar kiye gaye the...""

Therefore, Charles Thomson was one of the people who signed the handwritten draft.
"
Di gayi location mein se Dunlap broadside aakhiri baar kahaan pahuchi thi?,"The correct answer is **C: London**.

The passage states: ""Uski ek copy 10 August ko london pahunchi."" (A copy of it reached London on August 10th.)
"
Colonel Stark ke sainikon ka morcha kahan maujood tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttari chor par baad ke saath**.

The passage states: ""Stark ke aadmiyon ne upniveshvadiyon ki isthiti ke **uttari chor par baad ke saath-saath** apna morcha sambhala."" This directly translates to ""Stark's men held their position on the **northern slope behind** the positions of the colonists.""
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Stark ke admiyoon ne baad ko aage badhaya?","The correct answer is **B: Sainikon ke nikal jane tak**.

The passage states: ""Gridley ya Stark ne baad ke aage 100 feet (30 meter) tak ek khoonta lagaa rakhaa tha aur order diya tha ki sainikon ke nikal jaane tak koi bhi goli nahin chalaayega.""  This directly indicates that Stark ordered the soldiers to hold their position until they retreated.  While the other options might relate to the overall context, the passage explicitly links the action to the retreat order.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, inmein se kaun sa yug Cheen ka sabse khooni yug tha?","The correct answer is **D: Three Kingdoms wala yug**.

The passage explicitly states: ""The three kingdoms period in ancient Chinese history was one of the bloodiest eras..."".  This directly identifies the Three Kingdoms period as the bloodiest.
"
Passage ke anusaar inmein se kaun si chiz chintiyon ki fauz ke khanabadosh charan mein ane ke lihaz se shi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Unke pas khane ki kami hoti hain**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Jab khana kam ho jaataa hai toh basti banjara charan shuru karti hai."" This translates to ""When food runs low, the nomadic phase begins."" This directly indicates that the nomadic phase (when they search for new food sources) is triggered by a lack of food.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Veh raat ke samay ghonsle banaati hain (They build nests at night):**  The passage states they march at night, not build nests.
* **C: Vehaise ghonsle banaati hain jo 17 din baad badla jaataa hai (They build nests that are changed after 17 days):** While the nomadic phase involves temporary nests, the 17-day duration is a characteristic of the *nomadic phase* itself, not the reason for it.
* **D: Veh din mein march karti hain (They march during the day):** The passage explicitly says they march at night.



"
Passage ke anusaar kaun sa kathan chintiyon ki fauz ke khanabadosh charan ke dauran unki ghonslein banane ki aadat ko sabse sahi se dikhata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Veh pratidin ghonsla badalti hain.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Inmein se pratyek khanabdosh bhagdad ya march lagbhag 17 dinon tak rahta hai. **Inmein se pratyek khanabdosh basti asthaayi ghonsle banaati hai jinhen pratidin badla jaataa hai.**"" This translates to: ""Each foraging party stays for approximately 17 days. **Each foraging colony builds temporary nests which are changed every day.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Veh raat ke samay ghonsle banati hain (They build nests at night):** The passage says they march at night but doesn't specify *when* they build nests.
* **B: Veh ghonsle banaye bina 17 din tak march karti hain (They march for 17 days without building nests):** The passage clearly states they build nests *during* the 17-day foraging period.
* **D: Veh charan ke dauran wahi nest istemal karte hain (They use the same nest during this period):** The passage explicitly says they *change* nests every day.



"
Baahari sanketon ki mauzudgi ke bavjood inmein se kaun sa jaari rahega?,"The correct answer is **C: Jaivik ghadiyon (Biological clocks)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Jaivik ghadiyaan aatmanirbhar ocilator hain... baahari sanketon ke abhaav mein bhi mukt chalne wale cycle ko ek avdhi tak jaari rakhenge.""  This directly translates to ""Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators... they will continue their cycle for a period even in the absence of external signals.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Antarjaat chakron (Inter-species chakras):** The passage mentions their presence is often linked to biological clocks, but it doesn't say they *continue* to exist in the absence of external signals.
* **B: Saamyik lay (Common rhythms):** While the passage mentions common rhythms, it emphasizes that they are *responses* to external signals, not self-sustaining.
* **D: Dekhi gyi lay (Observed rhythms):** This is too vague and doesn't directly address what continues independently of external signals.

Therefore, only biological clocks are explicitly stated to be self-sustaining.
"
Kaun sa shabd kuch khas phenotypic visheshta ke kayi roop darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Polymorphic**.

Here's why:

* **Polymorphic** means having or exhibiting several forms or variations. The question specifically asks about individuals displaying multiple forms of a particular characteristic.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:** As the text states, monomorphic refers to a population where all individuals share a single phenotypic characteristic.
* **Organisms:** This is a general term for living beings and doesn't describe variations in characteristics.
* **Species:**  A species is a group of organisms capable of interbreeding. While a species *can* exhibit polymorphism, the definition of the term itself doesn't relate to variations in a specific characteristic.



Therefore, **Polymorphic** is the term that directly aligns with the description in the question.
"
Inme se kaun sa un jeevon ke liye shi shabd hai jo kisi vishesh kshetra par kabja kar lete hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Jansakhya (Population)**.

Here's why:

* **Jansakhya (Population):** The definition given in the question directly states that a population is a group of individuals of the same species living in a specific geographic area. This aligns perfectly with the question's prompt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **Monomorphic:** Refers to a population where all individuals have the same phenotype. While relevant to population characteristics, it doesn't define the group itself.
* **Species:** Refers to a group of organisms that can interbreed and produce fertile offspring. While a population is *part* of a species, the question asks for the term for a group that occupies a specific area.
* **Polymorphic:** Refers to a population where individuals exhibit different phenotypes.  Again, this describes a characteristic of a population, not the population itself.

Therefore, **Jansakhya (Population)** is the most accurate term for a group of organisms occupying a specific geographic area."
Inme se kaun sa prakrti-aadharit paryatan gatividhi ka udaaharan nhi hoga?,"The correct answer is **C: Science museum ka daura**.

Here's why:

* **Prakriti-aadharit paryatan (Nature-based tourism)** focuses on experiencing and appreciating the natural environment.
* **Jharne ki hiking (Hiking to waterfalls)**, **Jungalee phuloon ki photography (Photography of jungle flowers)**, and **Machhli pakdna (Fishing)** all directly involve interacting with and observing nature.
* **Science museum ka daura (Visit to a science museum)**, while potentially educational, is focused on human-made exhibits and scientific concepts, not primarily on experiencing the natural world.

Therefore, a science museum visit is not a typical example of nature-based tourism."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun parivahan pranali ka aadhaar hai?","The correct answer is **B: Nijee cars (Nijee cars)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Vigyaan ab yah sanket deta hai ki is vishal carbon arthavyavastha ne jeevmandal ko uski asthir aisthitiyon mein se ek se hataa diya hai jisne pichhae bees lakh salon mein maanav vikas mein sahaayata ki thi. **Niji karon par aadhaarit parivahan pranali ka samarthan karta hai**.""  This directly translates to ""Science now indicates that this vast carbon economy has removed the biosphere from one of its unstable states, which has aided human development over the past two million years. **A private car-based transportation system supports this.**""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kaarya sthal (Workplace):** While workplaces are related to transportation, the passage doesn't identify them as the *foundation* of the transportation system.
* **C: Sthir jeevmandal (Stable biosphere):** The passage suggests the biosphere is *unstable*, not stable, and the carbon economy has altered its state.
* **D: Manav vikas (Human development):** Human development is a *result* of the changes in the biosphere, not the foundation of the transportation system itself.

Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that the private car-based transportation system is the foundation.
"
Naabhik ki parikrama karne vaale kanon me kaun sa aavesh hota hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhanaatmak aavesh**

The text states: ""Proton ka dhanaatmak vidyut avesh hota hai jabki neutron ka koi avesh nahin hota."" (Proton has a positive electric charge, while neutron has no charge.)

The nucleus is described as containing protons, which have a positive charge. Therefore, the particles orbiting the nucleus (electrons) are orbiting a positively charged center, and the question asks about the charge of the particles *orbiting* the nucleus. While the text doesn't explicitly state the charge of the electrons, the context implies they are negatively charged, and the question asks about the nucleus.

So, the nucleus itself, made of protons, has a **dhanatmak aavesh (positive charge)**.
"
Naabhik kin kanon se bana hota hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Protons aur neutrons**.

The text explicitly states: ""Nucleus do kanon - neutron aur proton se milkar banta hai."" (The nucleus is made of two particles - neutrons and protons.)
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa paanch bit binary number ka udaaharan hai?","The passage states that a binary number can only have two values: 0 or 1. We need to find which of the options is a 5-bit binary number (meaning it has 5 digits, each being either 0 or 1).

Let's examine each option:

*   **A: 1010** - This is a 4-bit binary number.
*   **B: 12001** - This is not a binary number because it contains the digit '2'.
*   **C: 10010** - This is a 5-bit binary number.
*   **D: 110101** - This is a 6-bit binary number.

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 10010**."
Binary ankon ko aur kya kha jaata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Bits**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kisi binary sankhya mein do mein se ek hi maan ho sakta hai, yaani 0 ya 1, aur in sankhyaon ko hi binary ank - yaa computer ke shabdawali mein **bit** kahaa jaataa hai.""  This translates to: ""In a binary number, there can only be one value, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called **bits** in computer vocabulary.""

Therefore, ""bits"" is the correct term for binary digits.
"
Chhaatr bloging ke prathmik labh ke roop mein inme se kiska ullekh passage me nhi kiya gya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Saathiyon ki aalochna me kami (Lack of peer criticism)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that students often start blogs with disorganized grammar and style, but the presence of readers often leads to improvement.** This directly addresses grammar and writing skill development (Option A).
* **The passage mentions that blogging compels students to stay informed about the world around them**, which is a form of environmental awareness (Option C - although it's framed as general awareness).
* **The passage highlights how blogging encourages continuous learning and provides a platform for students to express their perspectives**, thus fostering a desire for lifelong learning (Option D).
* **The passage *explicitly* states that students improve their writing skills in order to avoid criticism.** This directly contradicts the idea that there is a lack of peer criticism.  In fact, peer criticism is presented as a *driver* for improvement.

Therefore, Option B is the only one *not* mentioned as a primary benefit of student blogging in the passage.



"
Bloging ke kis pahlu ko chhaatron ke lekhan kaushal mein sudhaar ke liye prerak btaya gya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Apne audience ki ruchi ko banae rakhne ko**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Darshakon ke dilchaspi ko pura karne ki zaroorat chhaatron ko chapal aur dilchasp banne ke prerit karti hai."" (The need to satisfy the audience's interest motivates students to become agile and interesting). This directly links audience engagement to the motivation for improving writing skills.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Internet par uplabdh samagri par pratikriya dene ko:** While this is mentioned as a benefit of blogging, it's not the primary driver for *improving* writing skills, but rather a consequence of blogging.
* **B: Aalochna se bachne ki chaahat ko:** The passage explicitly says students improve writing to avoid criticism (""Blogging """"chhaatron ko apne aas-pass ki duniya ke baare mein zyada jaankari rakhne ke liye majboor karti hai."""" darshakon ke dilchaspi ko pura karne ki zaroorat chhaatron ko chapal aur dilchasp banne ke prerit karti hai.""). It doesn't frame avoiding criticism as a primary motivator for skill improvement.
* **D: Sahyog ki jarurat ko:**  Collaboration is mentioned as a benefit of blogging and enhances learning, but it's not directly tied to *improving* writing skills as a primary motivator.



"
Inme se kaun sa chhaatron ke liye atulyakaalik sanchaar ka laabh nhi hai? ,"The correct answer is **B: Kisi bhi samay shikshakon se milne ki suvidha (The convenience of meeting teachers at any time)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that asynchronous communication *reduces* time constraints and allows students to communicate with teachers *outside* of scheduled meeting times.  Option B, ""Kisi bhi samay shikshakon se milne ki suvidha,"" implies *meeting* teachers at any time, which contradicts the core benefit of asynchronous communication as described in the passage.  Asynchronous communication allows for communication *without* the requirement of a synchronous meeting.

Let's look at why the other options *are* benefits:

*   **A: Ek sansaadhan ke roop mein internet ka upayog (Using the internet as a resource):** The passage mentions the internet and World Wide Web as enabling access to information at any time.
*   **C: Apne hisab se kaam krne ki suvidha (The convenience of working at one's own pace):** The passage emphasizes the ability to work at one's own speed and manage learning information flow.
*   **D: Bhagam-bhaag se bachaav (Avoidance of rush):**  The passage states that asynchronous communication reduces time pressure and allows for changes to work hours.

"Passage ke hisab se, atulyakaalik sanchaar ka inmemein se kaun sa pahaloo chhaatron ke liye apnane yogya nhi hai?","Passage ke hisab se, **C: Shikshan samgree** chhaatron ke liye atulyakaalik sanchaar ke anumane yogya nhi hai.

Passage mein atulyakaalik sanchaar ke faaydo par zaroor baat ki gayi hai, jaisi ki seekhne ki gati ko niyantrit karna aur kaam ke ghanton mein badlav karna. Lekin shikshan samgree (education material) ke bare mein koi baat nahi ki gayi hai.  दरअसल, passage mein जानकारी के तक पहुंचने की आसान उपलब्धता का उल्लेख है, लेकिन यह स्पष्ट नहीं करता कि सामग्री कितनी प्रासंगिक, विश्वसनीय या छात्रों की आवश्यकताओं के अनुसार है। इसलिए, यह निश्चित रूप से कहा जा सकता है कि सामग्री की गुणवत्ता और प्रासंगिकता एक मुद्दा हो सकता है।

इसलिए, सही उत्तर है **C: Shikshan samgree**."
Passage me kis cheez ka ullekh kisi aesi cheez ke roop mein nhi kiya gya hai jise koi madhya-yugeen quile se jod sakta hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Saurya**

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

*   **Passage में जो चीजें मध्ययुगीन महल से जुड़ी हैं:** Passage में खंडहर, लड़ाई की आवाज़ और खुशबू, कूकलों की खुरों की खटखटाती आवाज़ और Kalkothri की कब्रों से उठने वाला डर जैसी चीजें मध्ययुगीन महल के अनुभवों और कल्पनाओं से जुड़ी हैं।

*   **विकल्पों का विश्लेषण:**
    *   **Kalkothree ke gaddhe (कल्कothरी के गड्ढे):** passage में इनका उल्लेख है।
    *   **Ghudsawaar (घुद्सवार):** यह शब्द passage में नहीं आया है।
    *   **Saurya (सौर्य):** इसका मतलब वीरता या बहादुरी होता है। यह passage में मध्ययुगीन महल की वास्तुकला या निर्माण से सीधे तौर पर जुड़ा हुआ नहीं है। passage में युद्ध की यादें हैं, लेकिन ""सौर्य"" शब्द का सीधा उल्लेख नहीं है।

इसलिए, Saurya वह विकल्प है जो passage में मध्ययुगीन महल से जुड़ी किसी चीज के रूप में नहीं आया है।"
Inme se kiska ullekh passage me gandh ya dhvani ke roop mein nhi kiya gya hai jise quile ke khandaharon ke beech mahsoos kiya ja sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Daawat (Feast)**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions the sounds and smells of war (""ladaaiyon ke aawaaz aur khushbu""), the sound of footsteps (""koyalon par khuron ki khatpat""), and the feeling of dread (""kalkothri ke kabron se uthne waale dar"").  These all relate to auditory and olfactory experiences.

""Daawat"" (feast) doesn't fit into this category of sensory impressions evoked by the ruins.  It's a social event, not a sound or smell associated with the ruins themselves.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
Inme se kaun Kirby Muxloe quile ka sateek varnan hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Nirmaan ke samay desh me shaantipoorn sthiti hone ke kaaran ise nyoonatam quile-bandee ki jarurat thi**.

Here's why:

* **The passage clearly states:** ""1480 mein, jab Lord Hestings dwara iska nirmaan shuru kiya gaya tha, tab desh apekshaakrit roop se shaant tha. Iske saath hi bachaav ki zaroorat kewal ghumakkad updraviyon ke chhote samoohon ke khilaaf hoti thi."" This directly supports option B.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Quile ki motee deevaaron bnane ka anurodh Lord Hastings ne kiya tha:** The passage actually states the opposite - the walls were *thin* and not suitable for withstanding prolonged attacks.
* **C: Quile ka nirmaan us samay ke hisab se kathin nhi tha:** The passage implies the opposite, highlighting the castle's weaknesses and lack of robust defenses.
* **D: Ise lambe samay tak chalne wale yuddh aur bhari hamalon ko jhelne ke liye bnaya gaya tha:**  The passage states the castle was *not* designed for such scenarios.



"
Passage me btayi gyi avadhi ke dauraan inme se kaun si nirmaan visheshta Kirby Muxloe quile ke liye asaamanya mani jayegi?,"Correct answer is **A: Badi khidkiyan**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Kirby Muxloe's large windows and thin walls made it **not as strong** as a typical castle for its time. 
* The passage highlights that the castle was built during a relatively peaceful period with limited threat, so robust defenses weren't a priority. 
* Therefore, large windows are an *unusual* feature for a castle designed for defense, especially when compared to castles built during times of conflict. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Hamlo ko jhelne ke liye bnayi gyi neev:** The passage implies the foundation wasn't built for withstanding long sieges, but it doesn't say it wasn't built to withstand attacks.
* **C: Anya quilon ki tulna me kam quile-bandi:** The passage directly states that the castle was *not* as strong as typical castles, meaning it had *less* fortification.
* **D: Patali deewaren:**  The passage specifically mentions the walls being ""thin,"" which is the opposite of what you would expect for a defensive structure.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, aane wale seezan ki taiyai kar rhe runner ke liye inme se kya chiz sbse adhik phaydemand hogi?","The correct answer is **D: Shareer ke upari hisse ki kasarat ke liye gym ka upayog karna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes stability and resilience over speed.** It states that ""Timahi se aadhe-mil tak ke badlav ke saath, gati bahut kam mahatva ki ho jaati hai aur sthirata ek atyant aavashyakta ban jaati hai."" (With transitions from half-mile to mile, speed becomes less important and stability becomes an extreme necessity.)
* **The passage highlights the importance of tolerance for dangers.**  ""sabhi khatron ke liye sahan-shakti ka vikas hona zaruri hai"" (it is necessary to develop tolerance for all dangers).
* **The passage mentions cross country and gym work for upper body strength in winter.** ""Sardiyon ke dauran daud karaane waali kuch cross country, shareer ke upari hisse ki mazabooti ke liye gym waalon se jud gaye hain jo ki running season ke liye sabse sahi taiyari hai."" (Some cross country running during winter and gym workouts for upper body strength have joined together, which is the best preparation for the running season.)

Therefore, the upper body strength training in the gym (D) aligns best with the passage's focus on stability, resilience, and preparedness for challenges.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Garmiyon me cross country running ka abhyaas (Cross country running practice in summers):** While mentioned, the passage explicitly says *winter* cross country is beneficial for the upcoming season.
* **B: Training ke samay gati badhane par jor (Focus on increasing speed during training):** The passage states speed is *less* important.
* **C: Teen minute ke andar race khatam karna (Finishing the race in three minutes):**  While a good goal for some, it doesn't align with the overall emphasis on stability and resilience described in the passage.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, aadha-mile daudne wale first-class runner ke liye sabse mahatvapurna chiz kya hai?","The correct answer is **B: Gati se jyada strength par dhyan dena (Focus on strength more than speed)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that as a runner becomes more elite (""Timahi se aadhe-mil tak ke badlav ke saath""), speed becomes less important, and stability becomes crucial.  It then emphasizes the need for ""sahan-shakti ka vikas"" (development of endurance/stamina) to withstand dangers. The mention of cross-country training and gym workouts is explicitly stated as a means to build upper body strength for the running season.  Therefore, the passage clearly indicates that strength and endurance are prioritized over pure speed for a first-class runner at that level.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Shardiyo me cross country abhyas karna (Training in cross country during winters):** While mentioned as a training method, it's not the *most* important thing. It's a *means* to an end (building strength).
*   **C: Do minute me race khatam krna (Finishing the race in two minutes):** This is a speed-focused goal, which the passage indicates is becoming less important.
*   **D: Strength se jyada gati par dhyan dena (Focus on speed more than strength):** This contradicts the passage's overall message.

Therefore, option B accurately reflects the passage's central idea that strength is paramount for an elite runner.
"
"Ek athelete ke liye, inme se kaun si chiz sirf pooshan se prapt nhi ki ja sakti?","The correct answer is **C: Vishisht pradarshan (Special performance)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Uchit poshan sambandhi sevan akele kuleen pradarshan utpann nahin kar sakte..."" which translates to ""Proper nutritional intake alone cannot produce excellent performance..."" This means that while good nutrition is crucial, it's not *sufficient* for exceptional performance.
* **Other options:** The passage explicitly mentions that proper nutrition can help with:
    * **Behtar Pradarshan (Better Performance):**  It says nutrition *can* improve performance.
    * **Aanand badhana (Increase enjoyment):** It says nutrition *can* increase the joy of playing.
    * **Aam dekh-bhaal (General care):** Good nutrition is part of general care for athletes.
* **Vishisht pradarshan (Special performance)** implies exceeding expectations and achieving extraordinary results. The passage suggests that factors beyond just nutrition are necessary for this level of performance.



Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, yuva athlete ko apne khel me jyada aanand pane ke liye inme se kya nhi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Lagatar vishisht pradarshan karna (Consistently perform excellently)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that proper nutrition, hydration, and understanding supplementation can help athletes **improve their performance and *increase their enjoyment of the game***.  It doesn't suggest that consistently performing excellently is something they *shouldn't* do.  It focuses on the *foundation* of good health that supports performance and enjoyment. 

The other options are all mentioned as beneficial:

* **A: Uchit poshan lena (Getting proper nutrition)** is explicitly stated as important.
* **C: Khoob pani pina (Drinking plenty of water)** is mentioned under ""prabhaavi jalyojan aadaten banana"" (developing effective hydration habits).
* **D: Swasth oorjaa santulan bnana (Maintaining a healthy energy balance)** is also explicitly stated as important.



Therefore, the question is asking what an athlete *should not* do *based on the information given*. The passage doesn't say anything negative about aiming for excellent performance, it simply highlights the supporting roles of nutrition, hydration, and energy balance.  Therefore, option B is the most suitable answer as it's not directly addressed or discouraged in the text.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, madhyam duri ka runner adhik mahnga upakaran kyon khareed sakta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Ye unki apni ichcha hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zaroorat ke hisaab se utpaad khareede jaa sakte hain, lekin zyaadaatar ke pradarshan par koi khaas asar nahin hoga.""  This means runners *can* buy more expensive equipment, even though it won't significantly improve their performance.  The passage implies it's driven by personal preference rather than practical need or benefit.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Isse unhe laabh milta hai:** The passage explicitly says ""wah koi vaastavik laabh bhi na deta ho"" (it doesn't give any real benefit).
* **C: Isse unke pradarshan par kafi asar padta hai:**  The passage states the opposite - that it *doesn't* have a significant impact on performance.
* **D: Saste upakaranon ko lekar galatfahmiyaan hai:** The passage focuses on the misconceptions about equipment requirements in general, not specifically why runners might buy *more* expensive ones.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, madhayam duri ki running ke liye kya jaruri hai?","The correct answer is **C: Bhut kam upakaran (Very few equipment)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Zaroorat ke hisaab se utpaad khareede ja sakte hain..."" which translates to ""Products can be bought according to need..."". This implies that you don't need a lot of equipment to participate in middle-distance running.  The passage further suggests that buying more equipment won't significantly improve performance.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bahut sare upakaran (Many equipment)** - Directly contradicts the passage's implication.
* **B: Ek sthapit athlete ki prshthabhoomi (A proven athlete's background)** - The passage focuses on the equipment needed to participate, not on the athlete's experience.
* **D: Bhut sara paisa (A lot of money)** - While equipment costs money, the passage emphasizes that you only need to buy what is necessary and that extra spending won't provide a significant benefit.



"
Paramaanu chumbakeey anunaad ki khoj kisne ki? ,"The correct answer is **C: Bloch aur Purcell**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Is anunaad mein, chumbakiya kshetra aur radio tarangen parmaanuon ko chhote radio sanketon ko chhodne ka karan bante hain. Saal 1970 mein, medical doctor aur anusandhaan vaigyaanik Raymond Damadian ne... Bloch aur Edward Parsel (Harvard vishvavidyalaya) ne ki thi."" This clearly indicates that Bloch and Purcell discovered Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). Although Damadian later pioneered the use of NMR for medical imaging, the initial discovery was by Bloch and Purcell.
"
Medical imaging resonance ka pahla patent kis varsh kiya gya tha? ,"The correct answer is **B: 1974**.

The text states: ""Chaar saal baad koi patent diya gaya. yah meri ke kshetra mein jaari kiya gaya duniya ka pahla patent tha."" This means the patent was granted four years after Raymond Damadian laid the groundwork for using NMR for diagnostic imaging. He laid the groundwork in 1970, so the patent was granted in 1970 + 4 = **1974**.

Therefore, option B is the correct answer.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, doosaron ke shaareerik kaaryon ki vyakhya karne ke liye manushya ko kis cheez ki gahri samjh honi chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Irada (Intention)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""dusron ke iraade ko samajhna mahatvapurn hai. yah hamein shaaririk kriyaon ke sambhaavit aspashtataon ko hal karne ke yogya banaata hai."" (Understanding others' intentions is important. This enables us to resolve potential ambiguities in physical actions.)

While understanding desire (ichcha) and beliefs (vishwaas) can *contribute* to understanding intentions, the passage directly highlights the importance of *intentions* in interpreting actions. ""Dharnaa"" (assumption) is a broader term and not as specific to the passage's focus on interpreting actions based on underlying motivations.

Therefore, the passage emphasizes that understanding someone's **intention** is crucial for accurately interpreting their actions.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, irade ko samjhne se manushya ko kya karne me madad miltee hai?","The correct answer is **A: Shaareerik kriyaon ke peechhe ki anishchitata ko door karne me** (To resolve the uncertainty behind physical actions).

The passage explicitly states that understanding intentions helps in resolving ambiguity in physical actions. The example given (seeing someone break a car window) illustrates this point perfectly. 

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ichchayen samjhne me** (To understand desires): While understanding intentions *can* relate to desires, the passage focuses on the broader concept of resolving uncertainty behind actions, not specifically desires.
* **C: Manushyon ko nirpeksha drishti se dekhne me** (To view humans with an objective perspective):  The passage doesn't suggest that understanding intentions leads to an objective view. It emphasizes understanding the *why* behind actions.
* **D: Dusron ke dimaag ko padhne me** (To read other people's minds): The passage clarifies that humans are *not* fully capable of reading minds. It emphasizes *understanding* intentions, which is different from mind-reading.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa AI ka mukhya uddeshya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Karya swachalit karna (Automating tasks)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""AI mein anusandhaan mein aise karyon ko swachaalit karne ke liye machinein banana shamil hai jinmein buddhiman vyavhaar ke aavashyakta hoti hai."" This translates to: ""In AI research, it involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.""  Automating tasks is the core purpose of AI as described in the passage.

While the other options (planning, voice recognition, schedule setting) are *examples* of tasks AI can perform, they are not the *primary* or overarching goal. The overarching goal is to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kiske saath AI ko joda jaata hai?","The correct answer is **A: Grahak seva (Customer service)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...aadi hi haath se likhe hone ki pahchaan karna, boli aur chehra shamil hai. Aisi chizein alag-alag anushasana ban gayihain, jo vaastavik jeevan ki samasyaon ke samadhan pradan karne par dhyan deti hain. Aajkal AI system ka istemal aksar arthshastra, davaaiyon, engineering aur sainya kshetron mein kiya jaataa hai, **jaisa ki kayee home computer aur video game software application mein banaaya gaya hai.**""

While the passage mentions several applications of AI, **customer service** is specifically listed as an example within the context of AI applications in everyday technology.  ""Plan karna aur schedule karna"" and ""Haath se likhe hone ki pahchaan karna"" are mentioned as examples *of tasks AI can perform*, not areas where AI is *used with* something else. ""Vigyaan kathaayen"" is a completely unrelated concept.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kaunsa sammilit soch pattern waale ki khoobi hai?","The correct answer is **D: Pattern ko yaad rakhna**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that people with this type of thinking are ""saksham hote hain taarkik soch rakhte hain, jo pattern ko yaad rakhne, samasyaon ko hal karne aur vaigyaanik parikshanon par kam karne mein saksham hote hain."" (capable of logical thinking, who are skilled at remembering patterns, solving problems, and working on scientific experiments).

Option D directly reflects this capability of pattern recognition. Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ek samasya ke kai sahi uttaron ki pehchaan karna:** The passage states ""kewal ek hi sahi uttar hai"" (only one correct answer exists). This contradicts option A.
* **B: Samasya par nayi technique lagu karna:** The passage mentions ""maujooda technique ko phir se lagu karna"" (reapply existing techniques), not applying new ones.
* **C: Samasyaon ko hal karne ke liye samay lena:** While logical thinking might involve taking time, the passage doesn't specifically highlight this as a key ability of people with this thought pattern.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kya sammilit soch ki maansikta ka lakshya nahi hai?","The correct answer is **B: Samay lena (Taking time)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the goal of convergent thinking is speed, logic, and accuracy. It emphasizes quickly identifying facts, applying existing techniques, and gathering information.  ""Taking time"" is the opposite of speed and efficiency, which are key aspects of convergent thinking.

Let's look at why the other options *are* goals of convergent thinking, according to the passage:

* **A: Ye samajhna ki sirf ek sahi uttar hai (Understanding that there is only one correct answer):** The passage directly states ""kewal ek hi sahi uttar hai"" - ""there is only one correct answer."" This is a core principle of convergent thinking.
* **C: Tathyon ki pehchaan (Identifying facts):**  The passage says ""tathyon ki pehchaan"" is a key component.
* **D: Jaankari jutana (Fitting information together):** The passage mentions ""maujooda technique ko phir se lagu karna aur soochna ekatra karna"" - ""applying existing techniques again and gathering information"" which implies fitting information together.



Therefore, only ""Samay lena"" doesn't align with the goals of convergent thinking as described in the passage."
"Passage ke Hisab se, inmein se kya micro-expression nahi maana jaayega?","The correct answer is **D: Thumb’s up ka ishara karna (Giving a thumbs up gesture)**.

Here's why:

* **Micro-expressions** are fleeting facial expressions that last only milliseconds. They are involuntary and often reveal a person's true emotions, even if they are trying to conceal them.
* Options A, B, and C (looking away while speaking, furrowing brow, blinking rapidly) are all examples of facial movements that *could* be micro-expressions, as they are quick, subtle changes in facial expression.
* **Giving a thumbs up** is a deliberate, often consciously controlled gesture. It's not a fleeting, involuntary facial expression, so it wouldn't be considered a micro-expression.

Therefore, the passage wouldn't classify ""giving a thumbs up"" as a micro-expression.



"
Micro-expressions ke baare mein Inmein si kaunsi baat sach nahi hai?,"सही जवाब है **C: Speech ke saath-saath chehre ke expression ki vyakhya ki jaati hai**.

यहाँ बताया गया है कि यह जवाब सही क्यों है:

*   **A: Video recording se kaafi pragati hui hai** - यह कथन सही है। वीडियो रिकॉर्डिंग तकनीक में सुधार ने सूक्ष्म भावों को पकड़ना और उनका विश्लेषण करना आसान बना दिया है।
*   **B: Sahi vyakhya se jhooth pakda jaa sakta hai** - यह कथन भी सही है। सूक्ष्म भावों का सटीक विश्लेषण झूठ बोलने का संकेत दे सकता है, हालाँकि यह कोई अचूक तरीका नहीं है।
*   **D: Isse imandari ka aaklan hota hai** - यह कथन सही है। सूक्ष्म भावों का विश्लेषण करके, हम किसी व्यक्ति की ईमानदारी का आकलन करने की कोशिश कर सकते हैं।

**C** गलत है क्योंकि लेख में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि Oliver Sacks ने अपने पेपर में उल्लेख किया कि जिन लोगों को भाषण समझने में कठिनाई होती है, वे अभी भी ईमानदारी का आकलन कर सकते हैं। यह दर्शाता है कि केवल भाषण ही नहीं, बल्कि चेहरे के भाव भी ईमानदारी का आकलन करने में भूमिका निभाते हैं। लेख में यह नहीं कहा गया है कि भाषण के साथ-साथ चेहरे के भावों की व्याख्या की जाती है।"
Inmein se kya punarjagaran ki wajah se mahatvapurn ban gaya? ,"सही जवाब है **B: Gyaan ka prasaar**

यहाँ क्यों:

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि पुनर्जागरण ने सीखने और ज्ञान के प्रसार के दृष्टिकोण में एक महत्वपूर्ण बदलाव लाया है। जबकि अन्य विकल्प भी प्रभावित हुए, ज्ञान का प्रसार पुनर्जागरण का एक केंद्रीय पहलू था।

अन्य विकल्पों के कारण गलत क्यों हैं:

*   **A: Vyaktigat taur par yaad karna:**  पाठ में कहा गया है कि स्मरण करने की क्षमता में वृद्धि हुई, लेकिन व्यक्तिगत स्मरण ही परिवर्तन का मुख्य कारण नहीं था।
*   **C: Paath ko yaad karna:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि पाठ को याद करने की क्षमता में वृद्धि हुई है, लेकिन याद करने पर ध्यान केंद्रित करने से पहले ज्ञान को फैलाना अधिक महत्वपूर्ण था।
*   **D: Jaankari praapt karna:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि जानकारी प्राप्त करने का दृष्टिकोण बदल गया है, लेकिन ज्ञान के प्रसार में परिवर्तन अधिक महत्वपूर्ण था।"
Punarjagaran ki wajah se inmein se kis par kum dhyaan diya gaya?,"सही उत्तर है **A: व्यक्तिगत तौर पर याद करना (Vyaktigat taur par yaad karna)**।

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

प्रश्न कहता है कि पुनर्जागरण के कारण सीखने और ज्ञान के प्रसार के दृष्टिकोण में बदलाव आया, और व्यक्तिगत रूप से पाठ को याद रखने की क्षमता में वृद्धि हुई। हालांकि, यह भी कहा गया है कि ""व्यक्तिगत तौर पर भीतर का दबाव नहीं बना।"" इसका अर्थ है कि पुनर्जागरण के कारण व्यक्तिगत रूप से किसी चीज़ को याद रखने पर कम जोर दिया गया। ज्ञान प्राप्त करने पर अधिक ध्यान दिया गया, जानकारी साझा करने पर भी अधिक ध्यान दिया गया, और पाठ को याद करने की क्षमता में वृद्धि हुई। इसलिए, व्यक्तिगत तौर पर याद करने पर कम ध्यान दिया गया।
"
Inmein se kya satat sambandhon ke liye internet ke prayog ki aham wajah nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Yatra par research karna (Researching while traveling)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""niji bhagidari"" (private involvement) and ""satat sambandh"" (continuous relationships) are motivators for internet use, according to Eighmey and McCord (1998).  Of the options provided:

*   **A: Vyapar networking (Business networking):**  Business networking falls under the umbrella of building and maintaining relationships, thus contributing to continuous connections.
*   **B: Parivaar se jude rehna (Staying connected with family):** This is a direct example of maintaining personal relationships.
*   **D: Naye logon se milna (Meeting new people):**  This contributes to forming new relationships and expanding social circles, leading to continuous connections.
*   **C: Yatra par research karna (Researching while traveling):** While internet can be useful for travel research, it doesn't primarily contribute to *continuous relationships* in the same way the other options do. It's more about a task-oriented use of the internet.

Therefore, researching while traveling is the least directly related to maintaining continuous relationships as discussed in the passage.



"
Inmein se kya niji bhagidari ke liye internet ke prayog ki aham wajah nahi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Kisi vyanjan ko banane ka tareeka dekhna**.

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि Eighmey और McCord (1998) के शोध में ""निजी भागीदारी"" और ""लगातार संबंध"" को प्रेरणादायक कारकों के रूप में पहचाना गया।  यह इंगित करता है कि निजी भागीदारी का अर्थ है व्यक्तिगत स्तर पर जुड़ना और संबंध बनाना।

विकल्पों में, केवल **""Kisi vyanjan ko banane ka tareeka dekhna"" (किसी व्यंजन को बनाने का तरीका देखना)** व्यक्तिगत जुड़ाव या संबंध बनाने के लिए सीधे तौर पर संबंधित नहीं है। यह जानकारी प्राप्त करने या कौशल सीखने का एक तरीका हो सकता है, लेकिन यह ""निजी भागीदारी"" के मूल विचार को प्रतिबिंबित नहीं करता है।

अन्य विकल्प, जैसे कि ऑनलाइन वार्ता मंच पर पोस्ट करना, स्वास्थ्य उत्पादों पर शोध करना, और पैसा संभालना, सभी उन गतिविधियों को शामिल कर सकते हैं जो व्यक्तिगत स्तर पर भागीदारी और संबंध बनाने की अनुमति देती हैं।"
Paschimi Europe ne kab baahari baaton se prabhavit hona band kiya aur apni khud ki shally viksit ki?,"The correct answer is **A: Madhya yug ke ant mein (At the end of the Middle Ages)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Madhya yug ke ant mein paschimi europe ne apni shally viksit karna shuru kar diya."" which translates to ""At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe started to develop its own style.""

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Byzantine daur ke dauran (During the Byzantine period):** The text says Western Europe was influenced by Byzantine culture *initially*, but that influence lessened over time.
* **C: Madhya yug ke ant ke 25 saal baad (25 years after the end of the Middle Ages):** This is an incorrect timeframe.
* **D: 11veen sadi ke bich (Mid-11th century):** This is too early in the timeline.
"
Kapadon ko baandhne ke liye button ka upayog kiska natija tha? ,"The correct answer is **C: Dharmyuddh**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dharmyuddh ke parinamswarup us samay ke sabse bade vikas mein se ek logon ne kapadon ko baandhne ke liye button ka upayog karna shuru kiya"" which translates to ""As a result of the Crusades, one of the biggest developments of that time was the start of using buttons to fasten clothes.""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, paryavaran muddon ka inmein se kya lambe samay waala vyavharik hal hai?","The correct answer is **C: Samasyaon ki wajah ki pehchaan karna (Identifying the root causes of the problems).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Haalaanki, agar hum kewal asthaayi samadhan nahin chahte, toh hamein samasyaon ki jad ko dhoondh kar unhein nishkriya karna chaahiye."" (However, if we don't just want temporary solutions, we need to find the root of the problems and neutralize them.)

This directly implies that understanding and addressing the fundamental causes is crucial for a long-term solution.  

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ativyayi jeevan shaili ka tyag karna (Abandoning an extravagant lifestyle):** While important, this is a *part* of addressing the root causes, not the entire solution.
* **B: Sakriyta (Activity/Participation):**  Being active in environmental movements is helpful, but it's a method, not the core long-term solution.
* **D: Paryavaran andolan ke sahyogi banna (Becoming a supporter of environmental movements):** This is a form of activity, not the fundamental, long-term solution.

Therefore, identifying and neutralizing the root causes is the answer that best reflects the passage's emphasis on a permanent solution."
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kaunsa samadhan paryavaran samasyaon ke liye rogsoochak upchaar nahi maana jaayega?","सही उत्तर है **C: Ativyayi jeevan shaili ke chunav par apne vichar rakhna**.

यहाँ क्यों:

*   **Passage में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""यह कई मामलों में रोगसूचक उपचार के तरह ही है।""** रोगसूचक उपचार केवल लक्षणों का इलाज करता है, मूल कारण को नहीं। 
*   **विकल्प A, B, और D** सभी सक्रिय उपाय हैं जो पर्यावरण की समस्याओं को कम करने में मदद कर सकते हैं। ये लक्षण प्रबंधन के समान हैं, न कि मूल कारणों का समाधान।
*   **विकल्प C** केवल जीवन शैली विकल्पों पर विचार करना एक निष्क्रिय दृष्टिकोण है। Passage मूल कारणों को दूर करने की आवश्यकता पर जोर देता है, केवल राय व्यक्त करने पर नहीं।

इसलिए, passage के अनुसार, जीवनशैली विकल्पों पर राय व्यक्त करना पर्यावरण समस्याओं के लिए रोगसूचक उपचार नहीं माना जाएगा।"
Kis desh mein Europe ka pehla yuddh hua tha jiska mool mudda dhaarmik ki jagah shakti santulan sthapit karna tha?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Spain**।

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""Spanish uttaradhikar ka yuddh pehla aisaa yuddh tha jiska mool mudda shakti santulan asthaapit karna tha।"" जिसका अर्थ है ""स्पेनिश उत्तराधिकार का युद्ध पहला ऐसा युद्ध था जिसका मूल मुद्दा शक्ति संतुलन स्थापित करना था।""
"
Kis yuddh ko kabhi-kabhi antim ‘dharmik yuddh’ kaha jata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tees Saal ka Yuddh (Thirty Years' War)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Is prakar, tees saal ka yuddh ek dhaarmik yuddh kahlaane wala antim yuddh hoga."" which translates to ""In this way, the Thirty Years' War would be the last war to be called a religious war.""
"
Catholic Chruch ki inmein se kis baat par jaanch nahi hui?,"The correct answer is **B: Kya dharm ke mukhya siddhant mein badlaav karna chahiye**

Here's why:

The passage focuses on the historical power and wealth of the Catholic Church and questions whether its core tenets (specifically regarding the use of wealth for the poor) were actually followed. It explores the concentration of power and wealth in Rome.

*   **A: Kya Church mein baanta gaya dhan sahi tha:** The passage directly questions the morality of the Church's wealth and how it was distributed.
*   **C: Taakat ka Church mein kendrit hona:**  The passage explicitly raises the concern about power and wealth being concentrated in one place.
*   **D: Kya Church ke siddhant poore hue:** The passage directly asks whether the Church's main doctrines (regarding wealth and poverty) were actually upheld.

However, **B: Kya dharm ke mukhya siddhant mein badlaav karna chahiye** is a broader philosophical question about whether the Church's core beliefs should be revised. While the passage implies a need for reevaluation *based on the observed realities*, it doesn't directly discuss whether the fundamental principles of the faith themselves need to change. It focuses more on the *application* of those principles.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Versailles mein kaun maara gaya tha?","The correct answer is **D: Angarakshak**.

The passage states: ""Ek mauke par toh bhid mein maujood kisi vyakti ne ghabrai hui maharani ke saamne hi versailles mein maare gaye shahi angarakshak ka sir pakadkar hilaa diya."" (At one point, someone in the crowd grabbed the head of the royal guard who had been killed in Versailles right in front of the frightened queen.)

Therefore, the royal guard was killed in Versailles."
Bheed ne raja aur rani ko inmein se kya karne ke liye majboor nahi kiya tha?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Guard ka sir katta hua dekhna**।

प्रश्न पूछ रहा है कि भीड़ ने राजा और रानी को क्या करने के लिए मजबूर *नहीं* किया था। 

विकल्प A, B और D सभी सही हैं - भीड़ ने उन्हें अपनी गाड़ी की खिड़की खोलने, अचानक पलायन करने और वापस पेरिस जाने के लिए मजबूर किया। 

लेकिन विकल्प C, ""Guard ka sir katta hua dekhna"" (गार्ड का कटा हुआ सिर देखना), राजा और रानी को मजबूर करने की बात नहीं करता। भीड़ ने रानी के सामने एक मृत गार्ड का सिर दिखाया, लेकिन उन्हें उसे देखने के लिए मजबूर नहीं किया गया था। 

इसलिए, सही उत्तर **C** है।
"
Inmein se kya Britian ke alag nausena yuddh ka parinaam nahi tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Aham apoorti pahunch se baahar hui (Great Britain remained beyond access to essential supplies)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the blockade *targeted* the supply of essential supplies.** The blockade's *purpose* was to cut off Germany's access to vital resources. Therefore, Britain *did* aim to prevent Germany from obtaining essential supplies.

Let's look at why the other options *are* results of Britain's naval war:

* **A: Germany ki samaan yuddh niti apnaane ki ichchha (Germany's desire to adopt a similar war policy):** The British blockade led Germany to adopt unrestricted submarine warfare as a retaliatory measure. This is a direct consequence of the British naval strategy.
* **B: Jo jahaaz shaamil nahi the unhe khatre mein daalna (Putting ships not involved at risk):** The passage explicitly mentions the blockade ""khaden jahaazon ke liye bhi khatra paida ho gaya"" (also creating danger for coastal vessels).  This is a consequence of the broad naval blockade.
* **C: Antarrashtriya kanoon mein badlaav (Changes in international law):** The blockade violated widely accepted international law, and this violation likely contributed to later changes in international maritime law.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* a result of Britain's naval war is that Great Britain remained beyond access to essential supplies. The entire point of the blockade was to *prevent* that.



"
Inmein se kaunsi baat Britian dwara Germany ki samudri gherabandi ko nahi darshati hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Isne pakka kiya ki neutral ships ko khatra nahi hoga (It ensured that neutral ships would not be in danger)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Britain ne kisi bhi jahaaz ko samudra ke poore hisson mein pravesh karne se rokne ke liye antarrashtriya jal ka khanan kiya, jisse tat par khaden jahaazon ke liye bhi khatra paida ho gaya."" This directly contradicts option D. The blockade *created danger* for neutral ships, not ensured their safety.

Let's look at why the other options are correct, based on the passage:

* **A: Ye Antarrashtriya kanoon ke virrudh tha (It violated international law):** The passage explicitly states this: ""haalaanki is nakabandi ne pichhle do shataabdiyon ke kayee antarrashtriya samjhauton dwara aam taur par sweekrit antarrashtriya kanoon ka ulanghan kiya.""
* **B: Isse Germany ke Pandubbi yuddh ki shuruat hui (It led to the start of Germany's U-boat war):** The passage mentions that Germany hoped for a similar response, even with their unrestricted U-boat war: ""Choonki is ranneeti ko seemit pratisaad hi milaa tha, isliye Germany ne apne apratibandhit pandubbi yuddh ko lekar bhi isi tarah ke pratisaad ke ummid ki thi.""
* **C: Is wajah se German apoorti mein rukawat aa gayi (This caused a halt in German supplies):** The passage states: ""Isse Germany ke Pandubbi yuddh ki shuruat hui"" (It led to the start of Germany's U-boat war). While not directly stating supply halt, the intention of the blockade was to cause shortages and disruption to German supplies.



Therefore, only option D is inaccurate according to the provided passage.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Multiple Sclerosis ki pareshani ki sambhavna kise sabse zyada ho sakti hai?","The correct answer is **A: 32 saal ki ek aurat (A 32-year-old woman)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that MS is more prevalent in women than men.
* Option A represents a woman within the young and middle-aged adult demographic, which is where MS is most common.
* The other options represent a young boy, a middle-aged man, and a young girl – while they *could* potentially have MS, the passage highlights women having a higher likelihood.

Therefore, a 32-year-old woman is the most likely candidate based on the information provided.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, niyamit gatividhi mein hissa lene wale logon ko kis cheez ke liye sabse zyada madad ki zarurat padti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dard ke baare mein nakaratak soch (Negative feelings about pain)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jo niyamit gatividhi mein hissa le rahe hain, unhein dard ke nakaratmak sanvedana ke roop mein zyada support ki zaroorat hai. aisa isliye hai taaki ve samanya shaaririk halchal se hone waale tez dard aur asahajata mein antara kar skein."" 

This translates to: ""Those who participate in regular activities need more support in the form of negative pain feelings. This is so that they can differentiate between sharp pain and discomfort resulting from normal physical movement.""

Therefore, they need help managing the *negative feelings about pain* to distinguish between normal discomfort and something more serious.  The passage doesn't mention needing help for their back specifically (B), or needing support to combat sadness (C) or fear (D). The focus is on managing the perception of pain.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, aam taur par talvaarbaazi kaise ki jaati hai?","The correct answer is **D: Duel roop mein**.

The passage states: ""Aam taur par khel do roopon mein khele jaate hain, ek fencer aur doosra **dwelling** hota hai.""  ""Dwelling"" in this context refers to a duel (a one-on-one combat).
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Andruni vishaaktata ki sabse badi pehchaan inmein se kya hogi?","The correct answer is **D: Prescription ki goli ki bottle (Prescription pill bottle)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Internal poisoning ka sabse acha lakshan dawai ya vishaile gharelu rasayanon ke khule dibbe ki maujoodgi ho sakti hai."" This translates to: ""The best symptom of internal poisoning can be the presence of a medicine or poisonous household chemicals in an open container.""

While vomiting is mentioned as a common symptom, the passage highlights the **presence of a potential poison source** as the *best* indicator of internal poisoning.  Option D, ""Prescription ki goli ki bottle"" represents this potential source.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ubkaai aana aur bukhaar (Coughing and fever):** The passage states symptoms are general, and doesn't specifically link coughing and fever to internal poisoning.
* **B: Ulti aur pasina aana (Vomiting and sweating):**  Vomiting *is* mentioned as a common symptom, but the passage doesn't say it's the *best* or defining characteristic.
* **C: Pet mein ainthan aur dard (Abdominal pain and discomfort):**  Similar to vomiting, this is mentioned as a general symptom but not the primary identifier.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate answer based on the information given in the passage."
"Passage ke hisab se, kisi peedit ki halat jaanchte samay sabse pehle kya karna chahiye?","सही उत्तर है **C: Peedit ki haalat dekhein**।

पاساج کے مطابق، पीडیت کی حالت جانچنے کے لیے سب سے پہلے ان کی حالت کو دیکھنا ضروری ہے تاکہ ان کے گرد موجود خطرے کے نشانیوں اور حالات کو سمجھا جا سکے۔

(According to the passage, to assess the condition of a victim, it is necessary to first observe their condition in order to understand the surrounding signs of danger and circumstances.)
"
"Peedit ko dekhne ki prakriya mein, yahan bataaya gaya kaunsa kaam nahi karna chahiye?","सही जवाब है **A: अपनी खुद की चोटों को लेकर परेशान ना हों।**

यहाँ बताया गया है कि यह विकल्प गलत क्यों है और अन्य सही क्यों हैं:

* **A (गलत):**  यह कथन गलत है क्योंकि पीड़ित की मदद करने की कोशिश में खुद को चोटिल करना स्थिति को और खराब कर सकता है। प्राथमिक ध्यान पीड़ित की सुरक्षा और चिकित्सा सहायता प्राप्त करने पर होना चाहिए।

* **B (सही):** पीड़ित को देखने की प्रक्रिया में, घटनास्थल का आकलन करना बहुत महत्वपूर्ण है ताकि संभावित खतरों को समझा जा सके और सुरक्षित रूप से सहायता प्रदान की जा सके।

* **C (सही):** पीड़ित की स्थिति को बारीकी से देखना महत्वपूर्ण है ताकि उनकी चोटों की गंभीरता का पता लगाया जा सके और उचित प्राथमिक चिकित्सा प्रदान की जा सके।

* **D (सही):** ""रेड फ्लैग"" (Red flags) संभावित खतरों या गंभीर चोटों के संकेत होते हैं जिन्हें पहचानना और संबोधित करना आवश्यक है।

इसलिए, विकल्प A एकमात्र ऐसा कथन है जो पीड़ित की मदद करने की प्रक्रिया में हानिकारक हो सकता है।"
French Revolution se shuru hue kin badlaavon ka shramik varg ke naagarikon par gehra asar pada hai?,"The best answer is **B: Class ke bajaay kabiliyat par gaur kiya ja raha hai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""kranti ke baad vyavasaay sabhi purush aavedakon ke liye khule the jismein sabse mahattvakankshi aur safal hone vaale safal ho sakte the. Yahi sena par bhi lagu hota hai kyonki sena ki ranking warn par aadhaarit hone ke bajaay ab yogyata par aadhaarit hain."" This directly translates to ""After the revolution, businesses were open to all male applicants, in which the most ambitious and successful could succeed. This also applies to the army because army ranking is now based on ability rather than birth."" This clearly links the French Revolution to a shift from class-based systems to merit-based systems.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Desh ke liye support badha (Increased support for the country):** While the revolution *could* have increased national support, the passage doesn't directly focus on this as a *primary* impact on the working class. It's a broader political effect.
* **C: Republican ideology ko apnana (Adopting Republican ideology):**  The passage mentions Republican ideology as part of the revolution but doesn't directly link it to the working class's *immediate* impact.
* **D: Maapne ka naya system (New measurement system):** The passage mentions a new measurement system (""Maapne ka naya system""), but it does not state that this system impacted the working class.

Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the information provided in the passage.
"
"French Revolution ke baad, military aur anya kaamon mein, safalta milne ka paimana kis cheez par sabse kam aadhaarit tha?","The correct answer is **D: Kshamta (Ability)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Yahi sena par bhi lagu hota hai kyonki sena ki ranking warn par aadhaarit hone ke bajaay ab yogyata par aadhaarit hain.""  This translates to: ""This also applies to the army because army ranking is now based on ability rather than rank.""  

Therefore, the success in military and other fields after the French Revolution was primarily based on ability/competence.
"
Vikasit deshon mein kaun si saarvjanik seva ki wajah se log sabse zyada nakhush hote hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Saarvjanik parivahan (Public transportation)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Lagbhag sabhi log transport system ke baare mein shikayat karte hain."" (Almost everyone complains about the transport system.)
* **The passage contrasts transport with developed nations:** ""Viksit deshon mein aap shayad hi kabhi paani ki gunvatta ya pulon ke girne ki milte-julte astaron vaali shikayatein sunte hain."" (In developed countries, you might rarely hear complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.)  This implies that while those are concerns in developed nations, transportation is a much more prevalent issue.
* **The passage asks *why* the transport system is consistently problematic.** This leads to the conclusion that it's a central issue.

While water quality and bridge construction are important, the passage directly links dissatisfaction and complaints to the *transport system*.
"
"Diye gaye passage ke hisab se, public transportation systems ke baare mein kya kaha ja sakta hai?","सही उत्तर है **C: Ve log unki bahut burai karte hain jo systems ko istemaal karte hain**

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* Passage में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""लगभग सभी लोग परिवहन प्रणाली के बारे में शिकायत करते हैं।"" यह विकल्प C को सीधे तौर पर दर्शाता है।
* Passage परिवहन प्रणालियों की समस्याओं और पतन पर ध्यान केंद्रित करता है, यह सुझाव देता है कि लोग उनसे असंतुष्ट हैं।
* अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:
    * विकल्प A कहता है कि लोग उन्हें पसंद करते हैं, जो Passage के विपरीत है।
    * विकल्प B पानी की गुणवत्ता के बारे में शिकायत से तुलना करता है, लेकिन यह Passage के मुख्य तर्क को संबोधित नहीं करता है कि परिवहन प्रणालियां क्यों खराब हो रही हैं।
    * विकल्प D कहता है कि वे मुफ्त हैं, जो Passage में कहीं भी उल्लेख नहीं किया गया है।

इसलिए, Passage के आधार पर, सबसे सटीक उत्तर विकल्प C है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, drivers ki apratyaashitata ki wajah se kis baat ka aaklan karna sabse mushkil ho sakta hai?","The correct answer is **D: Traffic ka flow (Traffic flow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Traffic flow ka adhyan karna mushkil hota hai kyunki driver ke vyavhaar ka sou pratishat nishchitata ke saath pahle se anuman nahin lagaaya jaa sakta hai.""  This directly translates to ""Studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.""

The other options are related to traffic but not the *most* difficult to assess due to driver unpredictability:

* **A: Traffic ki speed (Traffic speed):** While speed can fluctuate, it's more predictable than driver behavior.
* **B: Raaste ki planning (Road planning):** Road planning is affected by traffic flow, but the unpredictability of drivers is a factor affecting traffic flow, not road planning directly.
* **C: Sadak par hone wala kaam (Work on the road):** This is a separate aspect of road management and less directly tied to the core difficulty of predicting driver behavior.



Therefore, the passage explicitly links the difficulty of studying traffic flow to the unpredictability of driver behavior.
"
"Traffic ki speed ka andaza lagaate samay, inmein se kis cheez ka istemaal kiya jata hai?","The correct answer is **C: Sadak ke raaste ka design (Roadway design)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that traffic flow (including speed) can be modeled mathematically due to a certain level of stability within the traffic stream.  The stability is influenced by factors like flow, density, and speed.  While driver behavior (option B) *influences* traffic flow, it's inherently unpredictable.  Option A (work on the road) and option D (traffic volume) are related to traffic conditions but not directly used to *estimate* the speed in a stable, modeled scenario.  The roadway design is a fundamental factor that dictates the potential speed of vehicles.

Therefore, roadway design is the most appropriate factor from the given choices to use when estimating traffic speed within a modeled system.
"
Hershey aur Chase ne apne DNA ko pratyaaropit karne ke liye kya kiya? ,"The correct answer is **C: Radiodharmi sulfur**.

Here's why:

* **Hershey and Chase's experiment** aimed to determine whether DNA or protein was the genetic material.
* They used bacteriophages (viruses that infect bacteria) to deliver DNA into bacteria.
* They then used **radioactive sulfur** to label the phage protein and **radioactive phosphorus** to label the phage DNA.
* After allowing the phages to infect the bacteria, they used a blender to separate the phage particles from the bacteria.
* They observed that the **radioactive phosphorus was primarily found inside the bacteria**, indicating that the DNA, not the protein, had entered the cells.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Radioactive phosphorus:** While radioactive phosphorus was used to label DNA, it's not the primary way they identified *which* molecule was entering the bacteria.
* **B: Genetic material:** This is a description of what they were testing, not what they used to identify it.
* **D: Viruses:** Viruses were the *vehicles* used to deliver the DNA, not the method of identification.



"
Apni aulaad mein mutation pass karne ki kshamta kis chheez par nirbhar karti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Agar cell germ-line ke hain**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Keval germ-line koshikaon mein vriddhi bachchon tak pahunch sakti hai..."" This translates to ""Only mutations in germ-line cells can be passed on to children...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Genetic material ka kitna asar hai:** While the genetic material is *affected* by the mutation, the passage focuses on the location of the affected cells (germ-line vs. somatic). The *extent* of the effect doesn't determine heritability.
* **C: Mutation kis tarah ka hai:** The type of mutation (e.g., point mutation, deletion, insertion) affects the *nature* of the change, but not whether it's heritable.
* **D: Agar mutation ki wajah se cell ki death ho sakti hai:**  If the mutation causes cell death, it won't be passed on to offspring because there are no cells to inherit it from.

Therefore, the ability to pass a mutation on to offspring is entirely dependent on whether the mutation occurs in a germ-line cell."
"Passage mein di gayi jaankari ke aadhaar par, mutation ke alag-alag asar kin cheezon par nirbhar nahi karte hain?","सही उत्तर है **D: Jis mutation par asar hua hai wo kis tarah ka hai**।

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

*   **Passage का मुख्य तर्क:** Passage बताता है कि mutation का प्रभाव इस बात पर निर्भर करता है कि यह किस genetic material में हुआ है, प्रभावित fragment का आकार क्या है, और क्या प्रभावित cell germ-line cell है।
*   **विकल्प D गलत क्यों है:** Passage में mutation के *प्रकार* (जैसे, पॉइंटMutation, डिलीशन, इंसर्शन, आदि) का उल्लेख नहीं किया गया है। Passage में बताया गया है कि mutation का प्रभाव इस बात पर निर्भर करता है कि यह कहाँ हुआ है (कौन सा genetic material) और कितना बड़ा बदलाव है, न कि mutation का प्रकार क्या है।
*   **अन्य विकल्प सही क्यों हैं:**
    *   **A: Genetic material ke kitne hisse par asar pada hai:** Passage स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि mutation का प्रभाव affected fragment के आकार पर निर्भर करता है।
    *   **B: Jin cells par asar hua hai wo germ-line ke hain:** Passage के अनुसार, germ-line cells में mutation के प्रभाव के परिणाम अगली पीढ़ी तक पहुंच सकते हैं, जबकि somatic cells में mutation के प्रभाव से केवल उस कोशिका को नुकसान हो सकता है या कैंसर हो सकता है।
    *   **C: Jis genetic material par asar hua hai uska mahattva:** Passage बताता है कि mutation का प्रभाव इस बात पर निर्भर करता है कि यह किस genetic material में हुआ है, और किस genetic material का महत्व है।

इसलिए, एकमात्र विकल्प जो passage में दी गई जानकारी के आधार पर mutation के अलग-अलग प्रभावों पर निर्भर नहीं करता है वह है mutation का प्रकार।"
Inmein se wo kaunsi wajah nahi thi ki puraane zamaane mein log bakriyan palte the?,"The correct answer is **C: Ve saathi ban jaati thi (They became companions)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions that ancient civilizations and tribes raised goats for milk, hair, meat, and skin.  The reasons provided in options A, B, and D align with these known uses.  

While goats *could* be considered companions, the primary reasons for raising them in ancient times were for practical purposes like food and materials. Companionship wasn't the driving factor mentioned in the text.
"
Golf ka lakshya hai ki kis cheez ka istemaal kam se kam kiya jaaye?,"The correct answer is **B: Tez prahar (Powerful swings)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the winner is the player who takes the *fewest strokes*.  Taking fewer strokes implies a more efficient and controlled game. While hitting the ball far is important, it doesn't necessarily mean a good score. A powerful swing (tez prahar) can lead to inaccurate shots and more strokes. Therefore, minimizing the need for powerful swings is key to a low score.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Gendon (Balls):** The game revolves around hitting the balls.  You *need* balls to play golf.
* **C: Samay (Time):**  While time can be a factor, the goal isn't to minimize time, but to minimize strokes.
* **D: Chhed (Holes):** The holes are the target. You *must* hit the ball into all the holes to complete the course.



"
Golf course mein kis jagah par ghaas chhoti kaati jaati hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Hari ghaas par** (On the green grass).

The text states: ""chhed ke chaaron or ghas ko chhota rakhaa jaataa hai aur use green kahaa jaataa hai."" This translates to ""The grass around each hole is kept short and is called the green.""
"
"Aamtaur par, kisi prayog ka kya maqsad hota hai?","The answer is **B: Ye pata lagana ki duniya kaise kaam karti hai** (To understand how the world works).

Here's why:

* **The text describes a sport (golf).**  The passage provides a description of how the game is played. 
* **The question asks about the purpose of an experiment.** While the passage *could* be considered a description of a process, it doesn't describe an *experiment*.  The question is asking about the general purpose of an experiment.
* **Option B is the fundamental goal of scientific inquiry.** Experiments are conducted to test hypotheses and learn about the natural world.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Ek ya ek se zyada parikalpna ko khatm karna (To eliminate one or more hypotheses):**  While eliminating hypotheses *is* a part of scientific inquiry, it's not the *overall* purpose.
* **C: Sawaal uthana (To ask a question):** Questioning is the *starting point* of scientific inquiry, but not the ultimate purpose.
* **D: Vaigyaanik anusandhaan ka maargadarshan karna (To guide scientific research):**  Experiments guide research, but they are a *means* to an end, not the end itself.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, scientific research ko guide karne mein kya cheez madad nahi karti?","The correct answer is **C: Sambhavit parikalpana ko khatm kar dena** (Eliminating probable hypotheses).

Here's why:

The passage states that scientific research is guided by:

*   **Scientific method:** Understanding how the world works.
*   **Experimentation:** Using experiments to test hypotheses.
*   **Observation:** Observing and examining things.
*   **Questioning and Examination:** Asking questions and scrutinizing.

The passage explicitly says experiments are used to *eliminate* hypotheses.  Therefore, *eliminating probable hypotheses* isn't a guiding factor in the scientific search itself; it's a *result* of the scientific process.

The other options (scientific method, observation, and experimentation) are all explicitly mentioned as things that guide scientific research.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, tornado ke bare me kaun sa kathan galat hai?","सही उत्तर है **C: ज़्यादातर tornado तीन घंटों से ज़्यादा समय तक के लिए आते हैं**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

पाठ में कहा गया है कि ""सबसे हिंसक दो प्रतिशत बवंडर तीन से अधिक घंटों तक बने रहते हैं""। इसका मतलब है कि ज़्यादातर बवंडर तीन घंटों से ज़्यादा समय तक नहीं टिकते हैं। विकल्प C कहता है कि ""ज्यादातर tornado तीन घंटों से ज़्यादा समय तक के लिए आते हैं"", जो कि पाठ के विपरीत है।

अन्य विकल्प पाठ के अनुसार सही हैं:

*   **A: Tornado अपने क्षेत्र में पड़ने वाली हर चीज को नष्ट कर सकते हैं** - पाठ में कहा गया है कि बवंडर अपने रास्ते में सब कुछ नष्ट कर सकते हैं।
*   **B: अन्य तूफानों के मुकाबले, tornado छोटे क्षेत्र तक सीमित रहते हैं** - पाठ में कहा गया है कि बवंडर एक छोटे क्षेत्र पर हमला करते हैं, जबकि अन्य तूफानों के विपरीत।
*   **D: कुछ tornado ऐसे होते हैं जिनमें हवा की गति 300 मील प्रति घंटे तक होती है** - पाठ में कहा गया है कि सबसे हिंसक बवंडर 480 किलोमीटर/घंटा (133 मील/घंटे; 300 मील/घंटे) तक की हवाओं के साथ आते हैं।"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa kathan jyadatar tornado ke bare me jankari deta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Inme hawa ki gati lagbhag 480 mile prati ghante hoti hai**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""In dangerous storms, winds can reach up to 480 kilometers/hour (133 my/second; 300 mph).""
* Option B directly reflects this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aamtaur par, inka prabhav teen ghante se jyada samay tak rahta hai:** The passage states that the *most violent* storms last three or more hours, but doesn't say this is *typical*.
* **C: Anya toofano ke mukable ye jyada bde kshetra ko prabhavit karte hain:** The passage says they attack a *small area* but can destroy everything in their path. It doesn't compare their area of impact to other storms.
* **D: Inme jameen se pedon ko ukhad fekne ki kshamta hoti hai:** While the passage mentions they uproot trees, this isn't the most prominent piece of information about their characteristics.



"
Inme se kaun sa kaam manav ne 16vi shatabdi me krna shuru kar diya tha?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Lense bnana**

**व्याख्या:**

प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि मनुष्य हज़ारों सालों से आवर्धन के लिए लेंस बना रहा है और इस्तेमाल कर रहा है। पहली वास्तविक दूरबीन 16वीं शताब्दी के अंत में यूरोप में बनाई गई थी। इसका मतलब है कि 16वीं शताब्दी के अंत तक लेंस बनाना पहले से ही एक स्थापित प्रक्रिया थी। इसलिए, विकल्प C सही है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

* **A: Lense ka istemal karna (लेंस का उपयोग करना):** मनुष्य पहले से ही लेंस का उपयोग कर रहा था, इसलिए यह 16वीं शताब्दी में शुरू नहीं हुआ।
* **B: Chizon ko bda karke dekhna (चीजों को बड़ा करके देखना):** मनुष्य लेंस का उपयोग करके चीजों को बड़ा करके देख रहा था, लेकिन 16वीं शताब्दी में दूरबीन का आविष्कार हुआ, इसलिए यह 16वीं शताब्दी में शुरू नहीं हुआ।
* **D: Doorbeen bnana (दूरबीन बनाना):** दूरबीन का आविष्कार 16वीं शताब्दी के अंत में हुआ था, इसलिए यह 16वीं शताब्दी में शुरू नहीं हुआ था।
"
"Lense ka istemal karke, manav kab se chizon ko bda karke dekh rha hai?","The correct answer is **C: Hazaron saloon se** (Thousands of years).

The passage states: ""Manushya hazaaron aur hazaaron salon se aavardhan ke liye lens banaa rahe hain aur istemal kar rahe hain."" This translates to ""Humans have been making and using lenses for magnification for thousands and thousands of years.""

Therefore, option C is the accurate answer.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Muhammad ki gufa se unke adhyatmik karm-kando ya mulyon ke bare me kya pta chalta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Ve shanti aur ekant ko mahatva dete the (They valued peace and solitude)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Unhone khud ko ekant karaa, jo kayee samay tak rahaa"" (He isolated himself, which lasted for many times).
* It also describes the cave as a place of isolation: ""duniya ke baaki hisson se poori tarah kati hui hai"" (completely cut off from the rest of the world) and ""ekdam akele ho jaate hain"" (you become completely alone).
*  The mention of ""chintan ke liye gufa ka upyog karte the"" (used the cave for contemplation) further emphasizes the importance of solitude for his spiritual practices.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bahri shor chinatan me madad kar sakta hai (Ocean noise can help in contemplation):** The passage describes a *quiet* environment (saaf vatavaran - clear atmosphere) - the opposite of ocean noise.
* **C: Unhe bahut kam samay tak akele rahna pasand tha (He liked to stay alone for a very short time):** The passage indicates he isolated himself *for many times*, implying extended periods of solitude.
* **D: Ve chahte the ki jyada se jyada loog unhe dekhe aur sune (He wanted more people to see and hear him):** The entire passage is about him *avoiding* people and seeking isolation.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, sabse pahle lohe ka istemal kisliye kiya gya?","The correct answer is **D: Patriyan (Rails)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Halanki, sadharan roop se wagonway mein lakdi se bane eksamaan takht lagey hote the, lekin patriyon ko unke aasthan par banaaye rakhne ke liye crostai ko kafi pahle vyavhaar mein laya gaya tha."" This indicates that iron was initially used on the **rails (patriyan)** to maintain their shape.  The passage then goes on to discuss the eventual use of iron for wheels.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, lakdi ke bjay lohe ke pahiye kyo istemal kiye jane lage?","The correct answer is **D: Ve patriyon par lge lohe se ghise rhe the**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aakhirkar, lohe ke pahiyon ne lakdi ke pahiyon ki jagah le liye. **Lohe vahanon ki lakdi ki pahiyon par adhik ghisan karte the.**"" 

This directly indicates that the iron wheels were adopted because the wooden wheels were wearing down the tracks. The other options are incorrect based on the passage.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Rumaniyatwad ke dauran logon ne kya bnaya?","The correct answer is **C: Reeti-rivaaj (Customs and Traditions)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...time along with that place, customs and traditions generated from that place and culture.""  It's about the development of customs and traditions tied to a specific place and time, as influenced by Romanticism.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kanoon (Laws):** While the passage mentions people being better off than ""self-imposed laws,"" it doesn't say they *created* laws.
* **B: Bhugol (Geography):** Geography is the location, not what was created.  The passage links geography to the development of customs and traditions.
* **D: Sanskriti (Culture):** While culture is mentioned, the passage specifically focuses on the *customs and traditions* that *emerged* from the interaction of people and their environment over time.  Customs and traditions are a *part* of culture, but the passage is more precise about what was created.



"
"Inme se kaun sa kathan, Technological nirdhaaranvaad ke samanya siddhant ko vyakta nhi karta hai? ","The correct answer is **B: Saanskriti ka koi asar takneeki vikas par nhi padta hai**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly argues **against** the idea that culture has no impact on technological development. It uses the example of the automobile to show that societal factors (the need for affordable cars and infrastructure) drove innovation in manufacturing and subsequently influenced healthcare advancements.

Let's look at why the other options *do* reflect the passage's argument:

* **A: Samaj aur samajik sthitiyon par takneek ka asar padta hai:** The passage demonstrates this with the example of how the car influenced road development, healthcare, and manufacturing.
* **C: Takneek ka samaj par antarnihit asar hota hai:** The entire passage argues that technology has an inherent impact on society, not just a superficial one. The example of the car illustrates this inherent impact.
* **D: Takneeki vikas par rajneetik asar nhi hota:** The passage implies the opposite by not stating that politics has no influence. The need for affordable cars, a societal demand, indirectly influenced technological development (manufacturing innovation).  While not explicitly stated, the passage doesn't deny political influence.



Therefore, option B directly contradicts the core argument presented in the passage.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa kathan bow khichne se sambandhit nhi hai?","The correct answer is **A: Mridu dhwani (Soft sound)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that an ""oopri-chaap"" (upper bow) typically produces a *soft* sound, while a ""nichla-chaap"" (lower bow) produces a *stronger* and more *full* sound.  Therefore, the passage directly links the lower bow to a stronger sound, not a soft one.

Let's look at why the other options *are* related to bowing:

*   **B: Chinh jo staple ki tarah dikhta hai (The symbol that looks like a staple):** This refers to the ""down bow"" symbol mentioned in the passage.
*   **C: Adhik dhwani (More sound/Full sound):** The passage directly states that the ""nichla-chaap"" produces a stronger and more ""adhik"" (more/full) sound.
*   **D: Shirsh se shuru karna (Starting from the head):** This describes the direction of the ""up bow.""

Therefore, ""Mridu dhwani"" is the only option that isn't directly linked to the bowing techniques described in the passage."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa kaam mridu dhwani se sambandhit hai?","The correct answer is **A: Down bow chinh**.

The passage states: ""ek oopri-chaap aam taur par ek mridu dhwani utpann karta hai..."" which translates to ""an upper bow usually produces a soft sound..."". ""Oopri-chaap"" refers to the up bow. Therefore, the up bow is associated with a soft sound. The down bow is described as producing a louder and more मुखर (mouthy) sound.
"
"Jeevaashm ke hisab se, hathon ka istemal mukhya roop se kis kaam ke liye kiya jata tha?","सही उत्तर है **A: Manipulation ke liye**

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है: ""Jeevaashm ke haath ke haddiyaan do millionse teen million saal purani hain, yah haath ke visheshagyata ko locomotionse **manipulation** tak badalane ke baare mein bataati hai.""

इसका अर्थ है कि जीवाश्मों के अध्ययन से पता चलता है कि हाथ का उपयोग शुरू में गतिशीलता (locomotion) के लिए किया जाता था, लेकिन समय के साथ यह हेरफेर (manipulation) के लिए अधिक महत्वपूर्ण हो गया।
"
Inme se kaun Chimpanji ke phalanges ki sahi jankari deta hai? ,"सही उत्तर है **D: Ve mukhya roop se manipulation ke liye istemal kiye jate the**

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि चिंपांजी के हाथ और पैर आकार और लंबाई में समान होते हैं, जो घुटनों के बल चलने के लिए हाथ के उपयोग को दर्शाता है। इसके बाद यह बताया गया है कि मानव हाथ सीधे तलवों के साथ पैर से छोटा होता है। अंत में, यह कहा गया है कि जीवाश्म हाथ की हड्डियां दो मिलियन से तीन मिलियन साल पुरानी हैं, जो हाथ की विशेषज्ञता को गतिशीलता से हेरफेर तक बदलने के बारे में बताती हैं।

यह जानकारी स्पष्ट रूप से इंगित करती है कि चिंपांजी के Phalanges (हथ की उंगलियों की हड्डियां) मुख्य रूप से हेरफेर (manipulation) के लिए इस्तेमाल होते थे, न कि वजन उठाने या झूलने के लिए।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

*   **A: Ve manvo se jyada seedhe the’ (वे मनुष्यों से ज्यादा सीधे थे):** पाठ में सीधे Phalanges के बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं है।
*   **B: Unke hath aur pairon ka aakar alag-alag tha (उनके हाथ और पैरों का आकार अलग-अलग था):** पाठ में कहा गया है कि चिंपांजी के हाथ और पैर आकार में समान होते हैं।
*   **C: Ve bhaar vahan karne ke kaam aate the (वे भार वहन करने के काम आते थे):** पाठ में कहा गया है कि चिंपांजी का हाथ हेरफेर के लिए अनुकूलित है, वजन उठाने के लिए नहीं।"
Chayan nayi aanuvanshik bhinnata ko kis pool se nikal deta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Vyakt (Phenotype)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Utparivartannei aanuvanshik bhinnata jodata hai, aur **chayan ise vyakt bhinnata ke poolse nikal deta hai**.""  This translates to ""Mutations add genetic variation, and **selection removes it from the phenotype pool**.""

The phenotype is the observable characteristics of an organism, resulting from the interaction of its genotype (genetic makeup) and the environment. Natural selection acts on the phenotype, favoring individuals with traits that increase their survival and reproduction.  Therefore, selection ""removes"" (in the sense of favoring or increasing the frequency of) phenotypic differences.  The question asks which *pool* natural selection removes new genetic variation *from*. The passage says it removes it from the phenotype pool.



"
Aanuvanshik bhinnata ko jodne ka kaam kaun si prakriya karti hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Utparivartannei**.

The passage states: ""Utparivartannei aanuvanshik bhinnata jodata hai..."" which translates to ""Mutation adds to genetic diversity..."" 

Therefore, उत्परिवर्तन (Utparivartannei - Mutation) is the process that *adds* to genetic diversity.
"
"Passage me di gyi jankari ke hisab se, “protein ki samasya” ko door karne ke liye inme se kya khana chahiye?","सही उत्तर है **C: Tidde**।

**व्याख्या:**

पैराग्राफ स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि मानव जैसे प्राइमेट के लिए ""प्रोटीन की समस्या"" को हल करने के लिए, पशु आहार (जैसे चींटियां, दीमक और अंडे) प्रोटीन का एक अच्छा स्रोत हैं क्योंकि वे आसानी से पचने योग्य होते हैं और सभी आवश्यक अमीनो एसिड से भरपूर होते हैं। जबकि पौधे (पत्तियाँ और फलियाँ) प्रोटीन प्रदान करते हैं, लेकिन उन्हें पचाना मुश्किल होता है जब तक कि उन्हें पकाया न जाए।

प्रश्न में दिए गए विकल्पों में से, ""टिड्डे"" (Tidde) पशु आहार का एक प्रकार हैं और इसलिए वे आसानी से पचने योग्य और उच्च गुणवत्ता वाले प्रोटीन का एक अच्छा स्रोत हैं। 

इसलिए, पैराग्राफ के अनुसार, ""प्रोटीन की समस्या"" को हल करने के लिए टिड्डे खाना चाहिए।"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun si samasya amino-acid ki kami ki wajah se nhi hoti hai?","The correct answer is **C: Kam vikas (Underdevelopment)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that lack of amino acids can lead to:

* **Avasaad banaan (Depression)**
* **Kuposhan (Malnutrition)**
* **Antatah mrityu (Death)**

While malnutrition *could* potentially contribute to underdevelopment, the passage doesn't directly link amino acid deficiency to underdevelopment as a primary consequence. Depression and death are much more directly stated as potential outcomes. Therefore, **Kam vikas (Underdevelopment)** is the least likely issue directly caused by amino acid deficiency according to the text.

"Aamtaur par, upsanskriti ke sadasya apni sanskriti ke sath kaise judav vyakt karte hai?","The correct answer is **D: shally ka prateekatmak upayog karke**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ek upsanskriti ke sadasya aksar shally ke ek vishisht aur prateekatmak upayog ke madhyam se apni sadasyata ka sanket dete hain, jismen fashion, taur-tareeke aur khaas boli shamil hain.""  (Members of an subculture often signal their membership through a distinct and symbolic use of style, including fashion, manners, and special language.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Ghulne-milne ka prayaas karke (Trying to blend in):** While some members might try to blend in, the passage emphasizes the *distinctive* aspects of subcultures.  Blending in would contradict that.
* **B: Apne aas-paas ke logon ki maanyataon ko apnaakar (Adopting the beliefs of those around them):** This is a general social tendency, not specific to how subculture members connect with their own group.
* **C: Samajik maandandon ko sveekar karke (Accepting social norms):** Subcultures often *reject* mainstream social norms.

Therefore, **D** is the only option directly supported by the provided text.

"Passage me diye gye siddhaant ke hisab se, us bachche ka kya hoga jo ek nasleey alpasankhyak aur khataranaak gatividhiyon me shamil hone wala mana jata hai?","The passage focuses on how stereotypes affect children's behavior, particularly when they are aware of negative stereotypes associated with their race/ethnicity. It doesn't directly address children engaging in ""dangerous activities.""

However, we can infer a likely outcome based on the passage's main point. The passage suggests that awareness of stereotypes *leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy*. If a child is told they're not good at something because of their race, they might perform worse, confirming the stereotype.

Therefore, the most logical answer, though not explicitly stated, is:

**A: Vo bachcha khataranaak gatividhiyon me shamil hona band kar dega**

**Reasoning:**

The passage discusses how awareness of negative stereotypes can lead to negative outcomes in academic performance.  Extrapolating this, if a child *believes* they are predisposed to engaging in ""dangerous activities"" due to a stereotype, they might be more cautious and avoid those activities to avoid confirming the negative stereotype about themselves.  

**Why other options are incorrect:**

* **B: Vo bachcha khataranaak gatividhiyon me aur jyada shamil hone lagega:**  This is the opposite of what the passage suggests regarding the impact of stereotypes.
* **C: Vo bachcha samajik gatividhiyon me hissa lena band kar dega:** While the passage discusses social context, it doesn't say that children will universally withdraw from social activities.
* **D: Vo bachcha anya nasleeya alpasankhyakon ke sath shamil hone se inkaar kar dega:** The passage doesn't discuss inter-racial dynamics in the context of dangerous activities.



**Important Note:** This is an inference based on the provided passage. The passage is limited in scope and doesn't offer definitive answers for all possible situations. It's crucial to remember that stereotypes are harmful and don't accurately reflect individual capabilities.  Engaging in dangerous activities is a complex issue with many contributing factors, and stereotypes are just one potential influence.

"Passage ke hisab se, bachche ki nasleey roodhivaadita ki samajh ka asar inme se kis par padega?","सही उत्तर है **D: Us nasla ko lekar unki soch par (Us nasl ko lekar unki soch par)**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

अनुच्छेद में कहा गया है कि जब बच्चे अपनी जाति से जुड़े रूढ़ियों के बारे में सीखते हैं, तो वे स्कूल में अच्छा प्रदर्शन नहीं करने की अधिक संभावना रखते हैं। यह सीधे तौर पर उनकी **सोच** और धारणाओं पर प्रभाव डालता है। 

अन्य विकल्प कम उपयुक्त हैं:

*   **A: Us nasleey alpasankhyak samaj par jiske sath usne judne ka vikalp chuna hai (Us nasleey alpasankhyak samaj par jiske sath usne judne ka vikalp chuna hai):** अनुच्छेद सीधे तौर पर इस पर ध्यान केंद्रित नहीं करता है कि बच्चे जाति समुदाय को कैसे प्रभावित करते हैं, बल्कि रूढ़ियों के बच्चे पर पड़ने वाले प्रभाव पर ध्यान केंद्रित करता है।
*   **B: Unke vyavhaar par (Unke vyavhaar par):** यद्यपि रूढ़िवादिता व्यवहार को प्रभावित कर सकती है, लेकिन अनुच्छेद मुख्य रूप से संज्ञानात्मक (विचार) प्रभाव पर केंद्रित है।
*   **C: Anya bachchon ke sath unke vyavhaar par (Anya bachchon ke sath unke vyavhaar par):** अनुच्छेद सीधे तौर पर अन्य बच्चों के साथ व्यवहार पर ध्यान केंद्रित नहीं करता है।

इसलिए, सबसे सटीक उत्तर विकल्प D है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, jangalee bachche ke paalan-poshan me inme se kis chiz ki kami rhne ki sambhaavna hai?","The correct answer is **B: Baat-cheet karne ki kushalta (Ability to communicate)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""jangli bachche"" (feral children) are often neglected, abandoned, or subjected to abuse. This lack of nurturing and social interaction significantly impacts their development.
* The passage mentions they are often kept separate from the world by their parents or are brought back from the wild.  This isolation hinders the development of social skills.
*  The passage notes that they behave similarly to domesticated animals, showing fear of humans or indifference.  This implies a lack of the kind of positive social learning that develops communication skills in humans.
* While the other options might be *influenced* by the situation, the core deficit described is in communication skills due to the lack of human interaction and social learning.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Svatantra roop se rahna (Living independently):** While they might have developed survival skills in the wild, the passage primarily focuses on the *negative impact* of the lack of human interaction, not necessarily their ability to survive independently.
* **C: Ekaantapriya pravritti (Introverted tendency):**  The passage doesn't explicitly state that they are introverted. Their behavior is more characterized by a lack of social skills and adaptation to animalistic behaviors.
* **D: Saamaajik ghabraahat (Social anxiety):** While social anxiety *could* be a consequence of abuse and neglect, the passage describes a more complex behavioral pattern – a lack of learned social skills, not just anxiety.

"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa kathan bachchon mein jangalee vyavhaar ka sateek varnan karta hai?","Passage ke hisab se, sahi jawab **B: Samajikaran ki kami se jangalee vyavhaar utpann ho sakta hai** hai.

Here's why:

* **Passage inssaiyate:** Passage mein kahwaa hai ki bachchon ko upeksha, durbhagya, ya durvyavahaar ke madhyam se badey hone ke dauran vayaskon dwara upekshit kiya jaata hai, jinhen ""paashvik pravritti vaale"" yaa ""jangli"" kahalaate hain.
* **Option B ka sahi varnan:**  ""Samajikaran ki kami"" ka matlab hai ki bachchon ko samajik jeevan mein shamil nahi kiya jaata. Passage mein samajikaran ki kami ko jangalee vyavhaar ka ek kaaran manaya gaya hai.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jyadatar jangalee vyavhaar shaareerik kami ke kaaran hote hain:** Passage mein shaareerik kami ko jangalee vyavhaar ka ek kaaran manaya gaya hai, lekin ""jyadatar"" nahi.  Passage mein upeksha, durbhagya, aur durvyavahaar ke jaise aur kaaranon ka bhi zikra hai.
* **C: jangalee vyavhaar keval un bachchon mein paya jata hai jinhen unke mata-pita ne tyaag diya hai:** Passage mein tyaag ko jangalee vyavhaar ka ek kaaran manaya gaya hai, lekin keval tyaag diya hone ke sabhi bachchon mein jangalee vyavhaar paya jata hai, aisa nahi kaha gaya hai.
* **D: Sabhi jangalee vyavhaar gambhir bauddhik akshamataon ke kaaran hote hain:** Passage mein gambhir bauddhik akshamataon ko jangalee vyavhaar ka ek kaaran manaya gaya hai, lekin sabhi jangalee vyavhaar gambhir bauddhik akshamataon ke kaaran hote hain, aisa nahi kaha gaya hai.

Therefore, option B sahi sabse sahi hai."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun si pratha nirvaah krishi ke anuroop nhi hai?","Passage ke hisab se, **B: Bechne ke liye bhojan ka utpaadan karna** nirvaah krishi ke anuroop nhi hai.

Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki nirvaah krishi ke mahant uddesh kisan aur uske parivar ki aavashyaktaon ko pura karna aur paryaapt bhojan utpaadan karna hai.  ""Jeevika aadhaarit kheti"" (which is a type of nirvaah krishi)  kisan ke parivaar ki aavashyaktaon ko poora karne par dhyan deti hai, na bechne ke liye utpadan karne par.

Options A, C aur D sab nirvaah krishi ke anuroop hain.
"
Inme se kaun nirvaah krishi ka sateek varnan krta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Isme faslon ka utpadan badhane ke liye anoothee takaneekon ka upayog kiya jata hai** (It uses unique techniques to increase crop production).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that Jeevika Adhaarit Kheti (subsistence farming) is a system that uses local, naturally adapted seeds and techniques like crop rotation to maximize yield.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yah puri tarah jaivik pranaali hai (It is a purely biological system):** While often biological, the text doesn't claim it *is* purely biological.
* **C: Isse kisano ko apni fasal apne kshetra me share karne ki suvidha milti hai (It provides farmers with the facility to share their crops in their area):** The text doesn't mention sharing crops.
* **D: Kuchh deshon mein kisan abhi bhi iska upayog karte hai (Farmers in some countries still use it):** The text acknowledges this but isn't the *definition* of Jeevika Adhaarit Kheti.  It's a consequence of its historical and ongoing use.



"
Kisi sangrahalay ka daura karna paryatan ki kis shrenee mein aaega?,"The correct answer is **C: Saanskrtik paryatan (Cultural tourism)**.

Here's why:

* **Saanskrtik paryatan (Cultural tourism)** focuses on visiting places to learn about the history, art, architecture, and heritage of a place. Museums are prime examples of cultural sites.
* **Manoranjak paryatan (Recreational tourism)** is about leisure and fun, like visiting beaches, theme parks, etc.
* **Outdoor paryatan (Outdoor tourism)** involves activities in nature, like hiking, camping, etc.
* **Vyaapaar paryatan (Business tourism)** is related to travel for business purposes.

Since a museum is dedicated to preserving and showcasing cultural artifacts and history, visiting one falls squarely within the category of cultural tourism.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, manoranjak yaatriyon ki prathmikta kya ho sakti hai?","The correct answer is **B: Apni dinacharya se chhuttee lena (Taking a break from their daily routine)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yah tab hota hai jab aaram aur mauj-masti ke liye log rozana ke jeevan se ekdam alag asthan par jaate hain."" This translates to: ""this happens when people go to a place completely different from their daily lives for आराम (rest) and मौज-मस्ती (fun).""

Option B, ""Apni dinacharya se chhuttee lena,"" directly reflects this idea of escaping daily routine for leisure and enjoyment. While options A, C, and D might be aspects of travel, they are not the *primary* motivation for the type of tourism described in the first paragraph. The emphasis is on relaxation and fun away from the everyday.

Passage me kis cheez ka ullekh kiya gaya hai jisse sthaaneey church me parivartan ke dar ko kam krne mein madad milee?,"The correct answer is **A: Udyamasheel vyavhaar ke saphal udaaharanon ko yaad karna** (Remembering successful examples of entrepreneurial behavior).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""is udaaharan mein, udyami vyavhaar ke pichle udaaharan ke yaadon aur safalataon ne, asthaaniya church ko naye badlaavon aur nirdeshon ke saath kholne mein logon ki madad ki."" (In this example, the memories and successes of past entrepreneurial behavior helped people open the local church to new changes and directions.) This directly links recalling successful entrepreneurial experiences to reducing fear of change.

While other options are mentioned in the passage, they aren't the *specific* thing that helped reduce fear of change in the local church.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, apna itihaas samjhne se kya madad mil sakti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Parivartan ka dar kam hoga (The fear of change will be reduced)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aisi safalata ke kahaaniyon ne bhavishya mein badlav ki disha mein sakaratmak jhukav paida karte hue, badlav ke aashankaon ko kam kiya. (Such success stories, creating a positive inclination towards change in the future, reduced the apprehension of change.)""

While other options *might* be indirectly affected, the passage directly links understanding history to reducing the fear of change. Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Moolyon ki vraddhi hogi (Values will increase):** The passage mentions understanding values, but doesn't claim history directly *increases* them.
* **C: Sangathan ke bheetar sthaan bnane ki bhaavna paida hogi (A feeling of belonging within the organization will be created):** While understanding history *could* contribute to belonging, it's not the primary or most direct benefit stated.
* **D: Udyamasheel vyavhaar mein sudhaar hoga (Improvement in entrepreneurial behavior will occur):**  The passage gives an example of how past experiences helped in a specific case, but doesn't state a general improvement in entrepreneurial behavior as a direct result of understanding history.



"
Inme se kaun sa kathan seekhane ke uttar aadhunik drishtikon ka sateek varnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Seekhane ke kuchh tarike doosaron se behtar hote hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage argues that উত্তরাধুনিক (postmodern) approaches to learning offer a better way to learn.** It explicitly states ""seekhne ka isase achcha tarika kuch nahin hai"" (there is no better way to learn than this).
* **It contrasts this with passive learning.** The example of watching a TV show illustrates how many people consume information without actively engaging with it or applying it to their lives. This implies that some learning methods are more effective than others.
* **Option C directly reflects this comparison:** ""Seekhane ke kuchh tarike doosaron se behtar hote hai"" (some ways of learning are better than others).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Seekhane ke kuch anubhav doosaron ki tulna mein adhik phaaydemand hote hain (Some learning experiences are more beneficial than others in comparison).** While true, this option doesn't directly address the postmodern perspective presented in the passage.  The passage is about a fundamentally *different approach* to learning, not just some experiences being better than others.
* **B: Aesi chizen sikhni chahiye jinse hmara vasta hota hai (We should learn things that are relevant to our lives).**  The passage doesn't focus on relevance. It's about *how* we learn, regardless of the subject matter.
* **D: Seekhne ki koi seema nhi hoti (There are no limits to learning).** The passage doesn't discuss limitless learning. It talks about the *effectiveness* of different learning methods.



"
Inme se kaun sa kathan uttar aadhunik shikshan drishtikon ko sateek roop se pratibimbit nhi krta?,"The correct answer is **D: Jis gyan ko hum shaayad kabhi istemaal na kar saken, vah bhi seekhne laayak hai** (Knowledge that we may never use is also worth learning).

Here's why:

* **The passage argues against learning solely for the sake of knowledge.** It criticizes the passive consumption of information (like watching a TV show) without applying it to real-world situations. The passage emphasizes *experiential learning* and the application of knowledge.
* **Option D directly contradicts this argument.** The passage implies that learning should have a practical purpose or lead to action.  Saying knowledge is ""worth learning"" regardless of whether it will ever be used flies in the face of the passage's focus on application and experience.

Let's look at why the other options are consistent with the passage:

* **A: Seekhane ke kyi tarike hote hai** (There are many ways to learn): The passage implicitly acknowledges different learning methods by contrasting passive learning (TV shows) with active learning (real-world projects).
* **B: Seekhane ke kuch anubhavon ko doosaron ki tulana mein praathamikta di jani chahiye** (Some learning experiences should be prioritized compared to others): The passage strongly advocates for prioritizing *experiential* learning, implying that it's more valuable than passive learning.
* **C: Seekhane ka anubhav seekhne vaale vyakti aur prastut samagri par nirbhar krta hai** (The learning experience depends on the learner and the presented material):  This is a general truth about learning and doesn't clash with the passage's core argument.  The passage focuses on *how* learning is experienced (actively vs. passively).



Therefore, **D** is the only option that doesn't align with the passage's emphasis on practical application and active experiential learning."
"Neend ki samanya avadhi ke dauraan jaanboojhkar jagne ke baad, inmen se kaun badha banega?","सही जवाब है **C: Alarm band karna aur bees minute baad phir se so jana**।

यहाँ बताया गया है कि यह सही क्यों है:

*   प्रश्नांश में बताया गया है कि ""neend ki rukawat aapke samanya neend ki avadhi ke dauran aapko jagaane ki prakriya hai""। इसका मतलब है कि आप सामान्य नींद के दौरान जाग गए हैं।
*   विकल्प C बताता है कि आप अलार्म बंद करते हैं और 20 मिनट बाद फिर से सो जाते हैं। यह एक ऐसा व्यवहार है जो अक्सर नींद की रुकावट के बाद होता है।
*   अन्य विकल्प उचित व्यवहार नहीं हैं:
    *   A: Dobaara सोने से pahale dedh ghante tak padhna – यह सामान्य व्यवहार नहीं है, विशेष रूप से नींद की रुकावट के बाद।
    *   B: Bathroom istemal krke fir se so jana – यह नींद की रुकावट को बढ़ाने वाला व्यवहार हो सकता है, लेकिन यह सबसे सामान्य नहीं है।
    *   D: Pani pine ke liye uthna – यह एक संभावित कारण है कि आप जाग गए, लेकिन यह नींद की रुकावट के बाद की प्रतिक्रिया नहीं है।

इसलिए, विकल्प C सबसे उपयुक्त है क्योंकि यह नींद की रुकावट के बाद जागने और फिर से सोने के सामान्य व्यवहार को दर्शाता है।"
Inme se kaun sa kathan neend rokne ke bare me shi nhi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **D: लक्ष्य यह है कि जगाने के दो घंटे बाद वापस सो जाना है**।

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

*   **प्रसंग** में कहा गया है कि लक्ष्य यह है कि आप बिना पूरी तरह से जागे, शांति से जागें और फिर आराम से सो जाएं।
*   विकल्प D में कहा गया है कि आपको जगाने के दो घंटे बाद वापस सो जाना चाहिए, जो प्रसंग के उद्देश्य के विपरीत है। प्रसंग का लक्ष्य एक शांत तरीके से जागना है, न कि वापस सो जाना।

अन्य विकल्प प्रसंग के अनुरूप हैं:

*   **A: यह बायोरिदम पर आधारित हो सकता है** - बायोरिदम एक प्रासंगिक अवधारणा है।
*   **B: पूरी तरह से जागना उद्देश्य नहीं है** - प्रसंग स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि पूरी तरह से जागने की आवश्यकता नहीं है।
*   **C: यह प्रक्रिया आपकी सामान्य नींद की अवधि के दौरान होती है** - प्रसंग में उल्लेख किया गया है कि यह प्रक्रिया आमतौर पर नींद की अवधि के दौरान होती है।"
"Jaise-jaise dimag aur jyada spasht sapne dekhane ka prayaas karta hai, kya badhata hai?","सही उत्तर है: **D: REM sthitiyon ke beech ka samay**

अनुच्छेद में स्पष्ट रूप से बताया गया है कि स्पष्ट सपने देखने की कोशिश करने पर REM अवस्थाओं की अवधि बढ़ जाती है। यह वृद्धि ही थकान का कारण बनती है।

अन्य विकल्प सही नहीं हैं क्योंकि:

* **A: REM isthitiyon ki matra:** अनुच्छेद में REM अवस्थाओं की मात्रा के बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं है, केवल अवधि के बारे में बात की गई है।
* **B: Urja stara:** अनुच्छेद में ऊर्जा स्तर के बारे में कोई उल्लेख नहीं है।
* **C: Recovery sthiti ki avadhi:** अनुच्छेद में रिकवरी अवस्था की अवधि का उल्लेख नहीं है, बल्कि यह बताया गया है कि REM अवस्थाओं में वृद्धि से थकान होती है।"
Baar-baar spasht sapne dekhne se shareer par inme se kaun sa nakaratmak prabhaav pad sakta hai?,"सही उत्तर है **A: REM sthitiyon ke beech ki avadhi kam ho jati hai**।

अनुच्छेद स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि स्पष्ट सपने देखने से REM अवस्थाओं की अवधि कम हो जाती है, जो नींद के दौरान शरीर के लिए आवश्यक है। यह नींद की कमी के समान प्रभाव डालता है और थकावट पैदा करता है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

* **B: Har raat REM ki sankhya ghat jati hai:** अनुच्छेद में REM की संख्या के बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं है।
* **C: Spasht svapn dekhne par nirbharta badh jati hai:** अनुच्छेद में निर्भरता का उल्लेख नहीं है।
* **D: Har raat REM ki sankhya badh jati hai:** अनुच्छेद बताता है कि स्पष्ट सपने देखने से REM की अवधि कम हो जाती है, संख्या नहीं बढ़ती।
"
"Passage ke hisab se, paramparagat aur virtual team ek jaisee kaise hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dono team ek jaisa pradarshan karti hai**.

Here's why:

The first sentence of the passage states: ""Virtual teams ko bhi parmparagat teams ke tarah hi utkrishtata ke samaan manakon par rakhaa jaataa hai, lekin unamen baareek antara hote hain."" This translates to: ""Virtual teams are also held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but they have subtle differences.""

This indicates that the passage explicitly states that virtual teams are treated *equally* to traditional teams in terms of standards, implying they perform in a similar way.  Options B, C, and D all describe differences between virtual and traditional teams, contradicting the initial statement.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Paramparagat aur virtual team ke sambandh me kaun sa kathan satya nhi hai?","The correct answer is **A: Paramparagat team ko aamtaur par behtar mana jata hai.**

Here's why:

The passage states that virtual teams are held to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but notes that there are differences. It doesn't say traditional teams are *better*. It implies they are comparable.  The passage highlights the unique aspects of virtual teams, suggesting they are distinct rather than superior.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **B: Virtual team aksar paramparagat team ke liye sampark bindu ke roop mein karya karti hai:** The passage explicitly states, ""Virtual team ke sadasya aksar apne taatkalik bhautik samooh ke liye sampark bindu ke taur par kam karte hain.""
* **C: Paramparagat team mein virtual team ki tulana mein kam autonomy hoti hai:** The passage says, ""unke paas parmparagat team sadasyon ke mukabale zyada azadi hoti hai kyonki unaki teemen alag-alag samay kshetron ke hisaabse mill sakti hain jo shayed unke sthaaniya prabandhan ke samajh naan aye."" This implies less autonomy in traditional teams compared to virtual teams.
* **D: Alag-alag samay kshetra se virtual team ko fayda ho sakta hai:** The passage states, ""unki teemen alag-alag samay kshetron ke hisaabse mill sakti hain,"" implying this is a benefit of virtual teams.



Therefore, option A is the statement that is *not* supported by the passage."
Inme se kaun si aesi cheez nhi hai jis par Samagri ka siddhant kendrit hai?,"सही जवाब है **A: Mature aadmi me nyi- nyi ikshayen utpanna hoti hai**

यहां बताया गया है कि यह सही क्यों है और अन्य विकल्प क्यों गलत हैं:

* **Samagri (Maslow) का सिद्धांत** मुख्य रूप से उन जरूरतों पर केंद्रित है जो हमारे व्यवहार को प्रेरित करती हैं। यह बताता है कि लोग अपनी जरूरतों को एक पदानुक्रम में पूरा करने की कोशिश करते हैं।
* **विकल्प A** (""Mature aadmi me nyi- nyi ikshayen utpanna hoti hai"" - परिपक्व व्यक्ति में नई-नई इच्छाएं उत्पन्न होती हैं) Samagri के सिद्धांत के मूल विषय से सीधे तौर पर संबंधित नहीं है। Samagri का सिद्धांत यह नहीं कहता कि परिपक्व लोग नई इच्छाएं उत्पन्न करते हैं, बल्कि यह बताता है कि वे पहले से ही पूरी हुई जरूरतों को पूरा करने के बाद उच्च-स्तरीय जरूरतों (जैसे आत्म-वास्तविकरण) की ओर बढ़ेंगे।
* **विकल्प B** (""Kisi ka vatavaran uske karyon ko kaise prabhaavit krta hai"" - किसी का वातावरण उसके कार्यों को कैसे प्रभावित करता है) Samagri का सिद्धांत इस बात को मानता है कि वातावरण किसी व्यक्ति की जरूरतों को पूरा करने में मदद कर सकता है या बाधा डाल सकता है।
* **विकल्प C** (""Aantarik aavashyakataen"" - आंतरिक आवश्यकताएं) Samagri का सिद्धांत आंतरिक जरूरतों (जैसे भोजन, सुरक्षा, प्रेम, सम्मान, आत्म-वास्तविकरण) पर केंद्रित है।
* **विकल्प D** (""Logo ki pasand ko samajhna"" - लोगों की पसंद को समझना) Samagri का सिद्धांत लोगों की पसंद को समझने का प्रयास करता है, यह समझने के लिए कि वे किस स्तर की जरूरतों को पूरा करने की कोशिश कर रहे हैं।

इसलिए, परिपक्व व्यक्ति में नई इच्छाओं का उत्पन्न होना Samagri के सिद्धांत का केंद्र नहीं है।"
Inme se kaun tisre niyam ka uddeshya nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Photo vyavasthit karna (Organizing the photo)**.

Here's why:

* **The Third Rule (Triangle Rule) focuses on composition and dynamism.**  It's about strategically placing the main subject within the frame to create visual interest and guide the viewer's eye. It doesn't primarily concern itself with general photo organization.
* **A: Vastu ko kha rakha ja sakta hai, iske liye ek aadhaar rekha banaana (The object can be anchored, for which a base line is created):** This aligns with the rule. The rule suggests using lines to anchor the subject.
* **B: Ek hi tasveer me jeevan aur urja dikhana (Showing life and energy in a single picture):**  The dynamic lines created by the rule contribute to a sense of movement and energy within the photo.
* **C: Vastu ko kisi khas aur prabhaavshali sthan par rakhna (Placing the object in a special and impactful place):**  The rule specifically aims to place the subject at the intersection of lines, creating a visually powerful and impactful composition.

Therefore, organizing the photo in a general sense isn't the primary objective of the Third Rule. It's about achieving a specific, dynamic composition.



"
Inme se kaun 35 mm ke photography praaroop ko pradarshit nhi karta?,"The correct answer is **D: Yah duniya ke sabse aam praaroop hai** (It is the most common format in the world).

Here's why:

* **The passage states that 35mm is *the* most used format globally, but that's not true *anymore*.** Digital photography has largely superseded film photography in terms of overall volume. While 35mm film is still produced and used by enthusiasts, it's no longer the most common format.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Yah abhi bhi utpaadan mein hai** (It is still in production): The passage explicitly mentions that 35mm film is still manufactured.
* **B: Ise digital camera praaroop me apnaya gya tha** (It was adopted in digital camera formats): The passage states that the aspect ratio of 35mm film was inherited by digital camera image sensors.
* **C: Kyi saamaanya praaroop ki tulana me, isme ek alag aspect ratio ka istemal kiya jata hai** (Compared to many common formats, it uses a different aspect ratio): The passage explains that 35mm has a specific aspect ratio (3:2) derived from its physical dimensions.



Therefore, the only statement directly contradicted by the passage is that 35mm is the most common format currently."
"Passage ke hisab se, jaise-jaise nirmata lens utpaadan ki gunvatta badha rahe hai, zoom lens mein kaise sudhaar hua hai?","The correct answer is **C: Inki photo quality nishchit focal lenth vaale lens ke samaan hoti hai.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Isane nishchit focal lambai waale lens se hassil tasveeron ke tulna mein jom lenses dwara uchch koti ke tasveeren hassil karna sambhav kiya hai."" This translates to: ""This has made it possible for zoom lenses to achieve high-quality images comparable to those obtained with lenses of a fixed focal length.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unme lens ki gati jyada hoti hai (They have higher speed/aperture):** The passage explicitly states the opposite: ""Agar flash naa ho, toh yah kam roshni mein saste jom lens ka istemal karna kathin banaata hai"" (If there's no flash, it's difficult to use cheap zoom lenses in low light). This means zoom lenses generally have a lower maximum aperture.
* **B: Kam roshni me inka upayog karna aasaan hota hai (They are easier to use in low light):**  The passage indicates they are *not* easier to use in low light due to the lower maximum aperture.
* **D: Prime lens ki tulna me inki focal jatilta kam hoti hai (Their focal complexity is lower compared to prime lenses):** The passage says the *opposite* - zoom lenses have greater focal complexity.



"
"Passage me di gyi jankari ke hisab se, prime lens ki tulna me zoom lens kab behatar ho sakta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Agar apko kam roshani me flash ka istemal na karna ho**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a disadvantage of zoom lenses is their typically lower maximum aperture (speed). This makes it difficult to use cheaper zoom lenses in low light *without a flash*.  Conversely, the passage also states that zoom lenses can achieve high-quality images comparable to prime lenses, especially as lens manufacturers improve.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar adhikatam uchch aperture (gati) prathmikta hai:** This is the *opposite* of what the passage says. Zoom lenses generally have *lower* maximum apertures.
* **B: Agar apko lens me kam element chahiye:** The passage states that zoom lenses require more elements than prime lenses.
* **D: Agar apko jyada focal jatilta chahiye:** This is the *reason* someone might choose a zoom lens – for its versatility in focal length. The passage says zoom lenses have more focal complexity.

Therefore, the only situation where a zoom lens would be *better* than a prime lens, according to the passage, is when flash usage in low light is not a concern."
Inme se kise rahasyavaad ka sateek varnan nhi maana jaega?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Chetna ki shantipurna aur aanandmay sthiti ka anubhav karne par jor diya gya hai**।

यहां बताया गया है कि यह उत्तर क्यों सही है और अन्य विकल्प क्यों नहीं:

*   **A (गलत):** प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि रहस्यवाद का जोर प्रत्यक्ष व्यक्तिगत अनुभव पर है, न कि केवल शांत और आनंदमय अवस्था प्राप्त करने पर। शांत और आनंदमय अवस्था रहस्यवाद का परिणाम हो सकती है, लेकिन यह रहस्यवाद का मूल उद्देश्य नहीं है।

*   **B (सही):** रहस्यवाद के अनुयायी आध्यात्मिक सत्य के प्रति जागरूकता चाहते हैं। यह रहस्यवाद के मूल सिद्धांतों में से एक है।

*   **C (सही):** रहस्यवाद के अनुयायी ऐसी प्रथाओं को अपना सकते हैं जो दिव्य वास्तविकता में उनकी अंतर्दृष्टि विकसित करने में मदद करें। यह भी रहस्यवाद के एक महत्वपूर्ण पहलू को दर्शाता है।

*   **D (सही):** रहस्यवाद धार्मिक विश्वासों और पूजा के अन्य रूपों के बजाय प्रत्यक्ष व्यक्तिगत अनुभव प्राप्त करने पर जोर देता है। यह रहस्यवाद को पारंपरिक धर्मों से अलग करने वाली एक प्रमुख विशेषता है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun sa rahasyavaad ka kendra bindu nhi hai?","Passage ke hisab se, **B: Sajha, samudayik anubhavon ke maadhyam se antardrishti praapt karna** rahasyavaad ka kendra bindu nahi hai.

"Passage ke hisab se, krishi samaaj ki shuruaat kisne ki hogi?","Correct answer is **C: Polynesia ke Maori logon ne**.

The passage states: ""Siddhantne tab yah vichaar sthaapit kiya ki maori log polynesiase ek great fleet mein chale gaye aur ek krishi samaj ke asthapna karte hue newzealand ko moriorise le gaye."" This indicates that the Maori people from Polynesia established an agricultural society in New Zealand.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, moa ka shikaar karne vaala samooh pahle kha rahtaa tha?","The correct answer is **B: New Zealand**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Unnisvin aur beesavin shatabdi ke dauran, yah maanaa jaataa tha ki newzealand ke pehle nivasi maori log the, joe moss namak vishal pakshi ka shikar karte the.""  This directly connects the Maori people with the hunting of moa in New Zealand, implying they were the early inhabitants who did this.  The passage later contradicts this, but the initial assertion points to New Zealand as the place where moa hunting (and thus, the presence of the early inhabitants) was initially believed to have occurred.
"
Kis sthiti me origami ki pureland paddhati ka upayog karne se folder ko laabh hoga?,"The correct answer is **D: Jb folder phle ise ek ya do baar istemal krke dekh chuka ho**.

Here's why:

* **Pureland origami's limitations:** The passage states Pureland origami is limited to a single fold per step and avoids complex folds like rivers folds. It's designed for beginners.
* **John Smith's intention:** It was developed in the 1970s for folders with limited experience or motor skills.
* **Why D is correct:**  If a folder is new to Pureland origami, they should practice with it a few times to get comfortable with the single-fold-at-a-time constraint and the simple, straight folds.  Trying to make complex multi-step models right away would be difficult.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jb folder ko ek saath kayi fold bnane ho:** Pureland origami *doesn't* allow multiple folds at once.
* **B: Jb folder ke paas unnat motor skills ho:**  Pureland origami is *designed* for those *without* advanced motor skills.
* **C: Jb folder aesi origami bna rha ho jisme reverse fold ki jarurat ho:** Pureland origami *avoids* complex folds like reverse folds.



"
Inme se kaun sa kathan Pureland origami ke bare me shi nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ye sirf anubhavi folder ke liye hi hai (It is only for experienced folders)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Anubhavahin folders yaa seemit motor skills vaalon ke madad ke liye ise viksit kiya gaya tha (It was developed to help novice folders or those with limited motor skills).""  This directly contradicts option A.

Let's break down why the other options *are* true based on the text:

* **B: Isme reverse fold shamil nhi hote (It does not include reverse folds):** The text says ""adhik jatil silvaton jaise rivers silvaton ke anumati nahin hai (it does not allow for complex folds like river folds).""  River folds are a type of reverse fold.
* **C: Fold me seedhe sthaan hone jaruri hai (Straight creases are necessary in folds):** The text explicitly states ""sabhi silvaton mein seedhe asthan hain (all creases are straight).""
* **D: Seemit motor skill wale folder ke liye acha tarika hai (It is a good method for folders with limited motor skills):**  The text states it was developed *for* those with limited motor skills.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kaun sa sthaan sindhu ghaatee sabhyata se sambandhit nhi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Purvottar Afghanistan ke sabhi kshetra** (All areas of North-East Afghanistan).

Here's why:

The passage states that the Indus Valley Civilization included areas of *north-west* Bharat, *north-west* India, and *some areas of north-east Afghanistan*. The word ""sabhi"" (all) makes option C incorrect. The passage explicitly says ""kuch kshetra"" (some areas).

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Harappa:** The passage mentions that after the first excavation of Harappa in the 1920s, some referred to it as the Harappan Civilization.
* **B: Saraswati Nadi:** Some scholars suggest the civilization was located in the dried-up riverbeds of the Saraswati River, leading to the term ""Indus-Saraswati Civilization"".
* **D: Adhikansh aadunik Pakistan:** The passage states that the civilization included areas of modern-day Pakistan.



Therefore, option C is the only one that is not supported by the passage.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kiska ullekh kansya yug sabhyta ke sambhaavit naam ke roop me nhi kiya gya hai?","The correct answer is **C: Sindhu nadee sabhyta**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the civilization was known as the **Sindhu Ghati Sabhyata** (Indus Valley Civilization).
* It also mentions that some scholars suggest calling it **Sindhu-Saraswati Sabhyata** because the civilization was located in the river valleys of the now-dry Saraswati River.
* The passage also mentions **Harappa Sabhyata** as a name given to it after the first excavations.
* **Sindhu nadee sabhyata** (Indus River Civilization) is not mentioned as a potential name in the passage.

Therefore, option C is the only one not mentioned in the passage as a potential name for the civilization during the Bronze Age.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaun lambe samay tak labh deta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Anya logo ke saath mil-jul kar kaam karna (Working together with other people)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...ummid hai ki adhikansh log yah mahsoos karenge ki dusron ke saath milkar kam karna unka deerghakalik sabse achcha vikalp hai.""  This translates to: ""...it is hoped that most people will feel that working together with others is their best option in the long run.""

The passage directly links collaboration (""dusron ke saath milkar kam karna"") with long-term benefit (""deerghakalik sabse achcha vikalp""). The other options are either directly contradicted or irrelevant to the passage's core argument.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, agar kisi ka dhyaan turant faayda paane par hai, to wo inmein se kis cheez ko prathmikta dega?","The correct answer is **D: Swarthta**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""lalach aur swarth hamare saath hamesha rahega"" (greed and selfishness will always be with us). It also mentions that ""alpaavadhi mein zyada laabh hoga"" (short-term gain will be greater) when focusing on individual benefit.  Therefore, someone focused on immediate gain will prioritize their own interests, which is defined as *swarthta* (selfishness/self-interest).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Niswarthta (Selflessness):** The passage directly contradicts the idea that selflessness is the primary focus, stating that greed and selfishness are always present.
* **B: Sath milkar kaam karna (Working together):** The passage acknowledges the *potential* for long-term benefits from collaboration, but it doesn't imply that someone focused on short-term gain would prioritize this.
* **C: Sahyog (Cooperation):** Similar to working together, cooperation is presented as a potential long-term benefit, not the immediate priority of someone driven by self-interest.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, war par hone wale kharcho ka sabse bada hissa kisne diya?","The correct answer is **D: Philippines ke logo ne**.

The passage states: ""Philippiens ke veejay mein american samrajyavad ke yuddh vyay ka bhugtan philipino ke logonne khud kiya tha."" (In the Philippines' victory, the Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses.)

The passage further explains that the US was forcing the Filipinos to pay for the colonial rule, which included interest on bonds issued in the Filipino government's name through Wall Street banking houses. However, the primary payment for the war expenses was made by the Filipinos themselves.
"
Templars ke yug se pahle kaunsa samay kaal aaya tha?,"सही उत्तर है **C: प्रारंभिक मध्य युग (Praarambhik madhya yug)**।

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि उच्च मध्य युग प्रारंभिक मध्य युग से पहले हुआ था।
"
Templars ke yug ke baad kaunsa time period aaya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Uttar madhya yug (Late Middle Ages)**.

The passage states that the High Middle Ages (the period of the Templars) was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which ended around 1500. Therefore, the Uttar madhya yug (Late Middle Ages) came after the Templars' era.
"
"Roman saamraajy ke dauraan, doctors aur surgeons ki taraf se istemaal kiye jaane waale kis chikitsa upchaar ya prakriya ke baare mein nahi bataya gaya hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dimag ko sukoon dene wali alag-alag dawaiyon se post-traumatic stress disorder ka ilaaj**.

Here's why:

* The passage mentions Roman doctors using opium (from poppy) and scopolamine (from henbane seeds) for pain relief and to control blood flow during amputations.
* It also states they were skilled in amputations.
* Therefore, options B and D are supported by the passage.

* However, the passage *doesn't* mention any treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) or using drugs to calm the mind. This is not something the passage describes as being used by Roman doctors.



Therefore, the answer is **A**."
"Passage ke hisab se, yahan batayi gayi kis cheez ko Roman samraajy ke dauraan chikitsa ke kshetr mein hui pragati ka shrey nahi diya jaata?","The correct answer is **B: Empire ki aakramak sainya neeti (The Empire's aggressive military policy)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the Roman Empire's military policy *helped* in the advancement of medical thought and treatment.  It highlights how the military's needs spurred the creation of the medical corps and the development of treatments for battlefield injuries.
* Options A, C, and D are all directly mentioned as advancements made during the Roman Empire's rule and contributions to medicine.  The passage focuses on the actions *taken* to improve medical care.

Therefore, the only thing the passage *doesn't* credit the Roman Empire for is the aggressive military policy itself – it acknowledges the *consequences* of that policy (the need for better medicine) but doesn't claim the policy itself was beneficial to medical progress."
Dekhne ki kshamta kis cheez par nirbhar karti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Visual system sensory organs par** (On the visual system's sensory organs).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Drishti yaa dekhne ki shamta visual system sensory organs yaa aankho par nirbhar karti hai."" which translates to ""The ability to see depends on the visual system's sensory organs or the eyes.""

While options B, C, and D mention aspects of vision, they aren't the fundamental basis of *what* vision depends on.  The sensory organs (eyes) are the starting point.
"
Organisms ke beech aankhon ka alag-alag structure kin cheezon se tay hota hai?,"सही जवाब है **B: Organism ki zarooraton ke mautabik**

यहाँ प्रश्न का अर्थ और उत्तरों का विश्लेषण दिया गया है:

* **प्रश्न:** जीवों के बीच आँखों की अलग-अलग संरचनाएँ किन चीजों से निर्धारित होती हैं?
* **विकल्प A: Tarang savedanshilta (तरंग संवेदनशीलता):**  आँखों की संरचना तरंग दैर्ध्य के प्रति संवेदनशीलता के आधार पर भिन्न होती है, यह सही है, लेकिन यह एकमात्र निर्धारक कारक नहीं है।
* **विकल्प B: Organism ki zarooraton ke mautabik (जीव की आवश्यकताओं के अनुसार):** यह सबसे व्यापक और सटीक उत्तर है। आँखों की संरचना जीव की आवश्यकताओं, जैसे कि प्रकाश में देखने की क्षमता, दूरी का अनुमान लगाने की क्षमता, शिकार को खोजने की क्षमता आदि के आधार पर विकसित होती है।
* **विकल्प C: Sahi se dikhai dene ke level se (ठीक से दिखने के स्तर से):**  यह आँखों की संरचना को प्रभावित करता है, लेकिन यह मुख्य निर्धारण कारक नहीं है।
* **विकल्प D: Organism ki complexity se (जीव की जटिलता से):**  जटिलता आँखों की संरचना को प्रभावित कर सकती है, लेकिन यह जीव की आवश्यकताओं जितना महत्वपूर्ण नहीं है।

इसलिए, सही उत्तर **B** है क्योंकि आँखों की संरचना मुख्य रूप से जीव की आवश्यकताओं के अनुसार विकसित होती है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, Sikh dharm ke baare mein batai gai inmein se kaunsi baat sahi nahi hai?","The correct answer is **B: Sikh dharm hi ek aisa dharm hai jismein guru ka fundamental pehlu hai** (Sikh dharma is the only religion in which the guru is a fundamental aspect).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""guru sabhi bhartiya dharmon ka ek moolbhoot pahlu hai, lekin sikh dharm mein iska itna adhik mahatva hai ki yah sikh maanyataon ka mool hai."" (the guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, it is so important that it is the foundation of Sikh beliefs).  It doesn't say Sikhism is *unique* in emphasizing the guru. While the guru is *very* important in Sikhism, the passage acknowledges their importance in other Indian religions as well.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Hindu dharm ki andar hi sampradiyak algaav ki wajah se Sikh dharm udhra tha** (Sikh dharma originated due to sectarian divisions within Hinduism).  The passage states Sikhism emerged from a sectarian division within Hinduism in the 15th century.
* **C: Dharm ke sansthaapak Guru naanak ke baad nau guru hue** (Nine gurus followed the founder of the religion, Guru Nanak). The passage clearly mentions that nine gurus came one after another after Guru Nanak.
* **D: Sikh dharm ki kuchh paramparaein Hindu dharm par aadhaarit hain** (Some traditions of Sikh dharma are based on Hinduism). The passage states that Sikhism is distinct, but it also implies that some traditions are derived from Hinduism.



Therefore, option B is the statement that is *not* accurate according to the provided passage.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kis cheeez ko Sikh dharm ka mukhya pehlu mana jata hai?","The correct answer is **A: Guru ka concept**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""guru sabhi bhartiya dharmon ka ek moolbhoot pahlu hai, lekin sikh dharm mein iska itna adhik mahatva hai ki yah sikh maanyataon ka mool hai.""  This translates to: ""The guru is a fundamental aspect of all Indian religions, but in Sikhism, its importance is so great that it is the root of Sikh beliefs.""

While the other options are related to Sikhism, the passage clearly identifies the **guru concept** as the *primary* or *main* aspect.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Attention Deficit Disorder se joojh rahe bachchon ko kis cheez par focus karne mein mushkil ho sakti hai?","The correct answer is **A: School ke kaam mein**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ADD waale bachchon ka mushkil samay hota hai schooly padhaai jaisi chizon par dhyan kendrit karna..."" (Children with ADD have difficulty concentrating on school-like things...).  While they *can* focus on things they enjoy (games, cartoons, etc.), it's the schoolwork and similar tasks that they struggle with.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Games khelne mein:** The passage says they *can* focus on games.
* **C: Cartoons dekhne mein:** The passage says they *can* focus on cartoons.
* **D: Apni pasandeeda cheezein karne mein:** The passage says they *can* focus on things they like.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Attention Deficit Disorder se joojh rahe bachche zokhim bhare kaam kyun karte hain?","The correct answer is **D: Apne dimaag ko uksaane ke liye (To stimulate their brain)**.

The passage states: ""Ye bachche bahut pareshani mein padtein hain, kyonki ye apne dimag ko uttejit karne ke liye jokhim bharey kam karte hain..."" (These children are in a lot of trouble because they do risky things to stimulate their brain...).  This directly supports option D.
"
"Passage mein di gayi jaankaari ke aadhaar par, inmein se kis tarike se scaffolding nahi ki jati?","सही उत्तर है **C: Ek alag study program**.

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

* **Scaffolding** का मूल विचार है सीखने में कठिनाई होने वाले लोगों को अस्थायी सहायता प्रदान करना, जिससे वे स्वतंत्र रूप से कार्य कर सकें।

* **A: Computer game ki shuruaat mein ek tutorial** - यह स्पष्ट रूप से एक प्रकार का scaffolding है। यह शुरुआती लोगों को गेम के मैकेनिक्स और बुनियादी बातों को सीखने में मदद करता है।

* **B: Ek SAT tutor** - एक SAT ट्यूटर भी scaffolding प्रदान करता है। वे छात्रों को अध्ययन रणनीति, अवधारणाओं और परीक्षा के प्रारूप के बारे में मार्गदर्शन करते हैं।

* **D: Kisi chhoti league ka coach** - एक कोच भी एक प्रकार का scaffolding है। वे खिलाड़ियों को कौशल सिखाते हैं, रणनीति बनाते हैं और उन्हें बेहतर प्रदर्शन करने में मदद करते हैं।

* **C: Ek alag study program** - एक अलग अध्ययन कार्यक्रम (जैसे कि सिर्फ किताबों की एक सूची) जरूरी नहीं कि scaffolding प्रदान करे। यह जानकारी प्रदान कर सकता है, लेकिन यह सीधे सीखने की प्रक्रिया में सक्रिय सहायता प्रदान नहीं करता है, खासकर चुनौतीपूर्ण कार्यों के लिए। यह छात्र को स्वतंत्र रूप से सीखने की जिम्मेदारी पर छोड़ देता है, जहाँ उसे कठिनाई हो सकती है।

इसलिए, एक अलग अध्ययन कार्यक्रम scaffolding की तरह सक्रिय सहायता प्रदान नहीं करता है, जैसा कि अन्य विकल्प करते हैं।"
"Inmein se kaunsi baat, scaffolding ke concept ke baare mein sahi jaankari nahi de rahi?","सही उत्तर है **B: Yeh madad ki bajaaye, seekhne ka tariqa zyada hai**।

यहाँ इसका कारण बताया गया है:

* **Scaffolding एक तरीका नहीं, बल्कि सहायता प्रणाली है:** यह अनुच्छेद स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि scaffolding सीखने का एक तरीका नहीं है, बल्कि उन लोगों को सहायता प्रदान करने का एक तरीका है जो कुछ नया सीख रहे हैं। यह एक प्रक्रिया है जो सीखने में मदद करती है।

अन्य विकल्प सही हैं:

* **A: Scaffolds, virtually ho sakte hain:** अनुच्छेद बताता है कि scaffolds आभासी (virtual) भी हो सकते हैं।
* **C: Ise project based learning bhi kaha jata hai:** अनुच्छेद बताता है कि scaffolding का उद्देश्य प्रोजेक्ट-आधारित लर्निंग को आसान और अधिक रोचक बनाना है।
* **D: Padhai ki shuruaat mein madad karnne ke liye, scaffolds ka istemaal kiya jata hai:** अनुच्छेद में कहा गया है कि scaffolding उन लोगों की मदद करता है जो नई चीजें सीख रहे हैं, जैसे कि एक नया कंप्यूटर प्रोग्राम चलाना या एक नया प्रोजेक्ट शुरू करना। यह सीखने की शुरुआत में मददगार होता है।

इसलिए, विकल्प B गलत है क्योंकि यह scaffolding की भूमिका को गलत तरीके से प्रस्तुत करता है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, MySpace ke kis feature se un students ko fayda ho sakta hai jinhein padhne mein pareshani hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Anukoolan (Accessibility)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Ise padhne mein aasaan banaane ke liye anukoolit kiya jaa sakta hai aur wo bhi vaanchhit jitne yaa thode rang ke saath."" This translates to ""It can be adapted to make it easy to read, and even with the desired amount of color.""  ""Anukoolan"" refers to accessibility features, specifically making the page easier to read for students with learning difficulties. The passage also mentions it helps students who have difficulty using a keyboard or spelling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Blogs:** While MySpace has blogs, the passage doesn't connect blogs to helping students with reading difficulties.
* **C: One web address:**  Having a single web address makes it easy to access, but doesn't directly help students with reading difficulties.
* **D: 5.4 crore profiles:** The number of profiles is irrelevant to helping students with reading difficulties.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, karmchariyon ke dange ke dauran, Krushchev ne inmein se kaunsi pratikriya nahi di thi?","The correct answer is **C: Wage mein katauti badha di**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the workers were protesting against wage cuts.
* Krushchev did **not** increase wage cuts; he was attempting to re-impose them.
* The passage explicitly mentions Krushchev sending tanks to enforce the original order, appointing a new prime minister (Vladislav Gomulka), and fulfilling some economic demands.



Therefore, option C is the only action Krushchev *didn't* take according to the passage."
Inmein se kis wajah se Poland mein dange nahi hue the?,"The correct answer is **D: Wladyslaw Gomulka ki niyukti se** (The appointment of Wladyslaw Gomulka).

Here's why:

The passage states that Krushchev initially sent tanks to re-impose the order after the strikes. However, he ultimately agreed to appoint Gomulka as Prime Minister *after* making some economic concessions.  The appointment of Gomulka, a popular figure who wasn't seen as a staunch communist like Krushchev, diffused the situation and quelled the unrest.  His appointment was a key factor in preventing further escalation of the protests.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Saamyavaad (Communism):**  The protests were *against* communism, not *because of* it.
* **B: Khaane ki kami (Food shortage):** Food shortage was a *cause* of the protests, but not the reason they didn't continue.  The concessions made addressed this.
* **C: Vetan mein katauti (Wage cuts):** Similar to food shortage, wage cuts were a *cause* of the protests, but the concessions made addressed this.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein kis cheez ne USSR aur USA ke sambandhon par asar nahi dala tha?","Passage ke hisab se, **B: Germany ke baare mein raay** USSR aur USA ke sambandhon par asar nahi dala tha.

Passage mein zaroor kaha gaya hai ki Germany ek aam dushman tha aur ladaai khatm hone ke baad system, prakriya aur sanskriti ke takraavon ke wajah se desh tootne lage the.  Lekin, passage ke aakhir ke hisse mein, ""pehle ke saathi ab dushman ban gaye the"" aur ""shit yuddh ki shuruat ho chuki thi"" ka zikr hai, aur iski wajah system, prakriya aur sanskriti ke takraavon se judi hai, na Germany ke baare mein raay se.

Isliye, Germany ke baare mein raay USSR aur USA ke sambandhon par asar nahi dala."
"Inmein se kaunsi cheez, poori body mein nerve impulse bhejne ke maksad ke baare mein sahi jankari nahi de rahi?","The correct answer is **A: Blood flow dheema hona (Blood flow slowing down)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the tantrika (vital energy) helps maintain homeostasis *while* ensuring blood flow remains abundant.  It also says this energy is transmitted quickly throughout the body to protect it from danger. Therefore, the tantrika system's function is to *maintain* and *regulate* blood flow, not slow it down.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate according to the passage:

* **B: Blood flow manage karna (Managing blood flow):**  The passage explicitly mentions maintaining blood flow alongside tantrika energy.
* **C: Homeostasis banaye rakhna (Maintaining homeostasis):**  This is a direct statement in the passage.
* **D: Body ke sambhaavit khatron se bacahna (Protecting the body from potential dangers):** The passage states the tantrika energy helps protect the body from danger.



Therefore, the only statement that contradicts the passage is that blood flow slows down."
Giza Plateau mein kya milta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Makbare**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Geezaa pathar, """"geezaa necropolis"""" yaa mritakon ke misra ki ghaati mein kayee pyramid (jinmein se the great pyramid sabse bada hai), kayee chhoti kabrein, kayee mandir aur mahaan sphinx hain."" 

This translates to: ""The Giza plateau, or the valley of the dead, contains many pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), many small tombs, many temples, and the Great Sphinx.""

While the passage mentions pyramids, temples, and the Sphinx, it explicitly lists ""kayee chhoti kabrein"" (many small tombs) as being present.  ""Makbare"" (tombs) is a broader term that encompasses both the small tombs and the pyramids used as tombs.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Mandir (Temples):** While temples are present, it's not the primary thing listed as being *found* on the plateau.
* **C: Saaton ajoobe (Seven Wonders):** The passage says the Great Pyramid is *one* of the Seven Wonders, not that the entire plateau *is* the Seven Wonders.
* **D: The Great Pyramid:** While the Great Pyramid is a significant feature, the plateau contains *more* than just the Great Pyramid.



"
Great Pyramid banane ka kya maksad tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ferro ka Sammaan mein**.

The text explicitly states: ""Mahaan pyramid ferro khufu ke sammaan mein banaaya gaya tha..."" which translates to ""The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Saat ajubon mein se ek banane ke liye:**  While true, this is not the *purpose* of the pyramid; it's a fact about its status.
* **C: landmark banae ke liye:** The text doesn't mention the pyramid being built as a landmark. Its primary purpose was funerary.
* **D: Jin logon ka nidhan hua hai wahan unki kabr banane ke liye:**  While the Great Pyramid is part of a necropolis (city of the dead), the text specifies it was built specifically for Pharaoh Khufu.  Smaller pyramids and tombs were for his family.



"
Artemis ke mandir ko nasht karne mein kiska hath tha?,"सही जवाब है **C: Strabo**

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

पाठ स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि हरोस्ट्रैटस ने एफ़ेसिअस में आर्टेमिस के मंदिर को नष्ट कर दिया था। फ़ेफ़ेसिअस ने हरोस्ट्रैटस के नाम को इतिहास से मिटाने की मांग की। हालाँकि, स्ट्रैबो ने बाद में उसका नाम लिखा, जिससे हरोस्ट्रैटस का नाम इतिहास में दर्ज हो गया।

इसलिए, हरोस्ट्रैटस वास्तव में मंदिर को नष्ट करने वाला व्यक्ति था, और स्ट्रैबो ने उसका नाम इतिहास में दर्ज किया, इस प्रकार वह अप्रत्यक्ष रूप से उस व्यक्ति के नाम को उजागर करने में शामिल हो गया जिसने मंदिर को नष्ट कर दिया।

इसलिए, सही उत्तर **C: Strabo** है, क्योंकि उसने हरोस्ट्रैटस का नाम इतिहास में दर्ज किया, जो मंदिर को नष्ट करने वाले व्यक्ति के रूप में जाना जाता है।"
Artemis ke mandir ko punar nirmaan ke baare mein konsa kathan sahi hai?,"सही उत्तर है: **B: Alexander ke saashan ke baad mandir ka punar nirmaan hua.**

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से बताया गया है कि सिकंदर महान की मृत्यु के बाद, 323 ईसा पूर्व में मंदिर का पुनर्निर्माण हुआ। विकल्प A में कहा गया है कि सिकंदर ने पुनर्निर्माण के लिए भुगतान किया, लेकिन पाठ में ऐसा कोई उल्लेख नहीं है। विकल्प C गलत है क्योंकि हरोस्ट्रैटस को पुनर्निर्माण की लागत का भुगतान करने का कोई उल्लेख नहीं है। विकल्प D में पुनर्निर्माण का गलत वर्ष दिया गया है।"
Passage ke hisab se sabse pehle kab kisi prajati ne do pairon par chalna shuru kiya?,"The correct answer is **A: 7 million varsh pehle**.

The passage states: ""ho sakta hai 7 million varsh pahle sahenthropus do pairon par chal sakta tha."" (it is possible that 7 million years ago, *Sahelanthropus* could walk on two legs).

While the passage mentions *Australopithecus* started walking upright around 4.2-3.9 million years ago, it suggests *Sahelanthropus* might have done so earlier, 7 million years ago. Therefore, 7 million years ago is the earliest time mentioned in the passage that any species might have walked on two legs.
"
Inme se konsi prajati niyamit roop se apne pairon par chalti thi?,"The correct answer is **B: Homo Erectus**.

Here's why:

* **Homo Erectus** is explicitly mentioned as having begun walking upright 20 lakh years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus. The passage states this directly.
* **Australopithecus**'s ancestors did *not* walk upright regularly.  While some Australopithecus fossils show bipedal adaptations, they weren't consistently bipedal like Homo erectus.
* **Sahelanthropus** is mentioned as potentially being bipedal 7 million years ago, but the passage doesn't state they walked upright *regularly* or consistently. It's a possibility, not a certainty.
* **Bipedal visheshagyat** is a general term for having adaptations for walking on two legs. It doesn't refer to a specific species.

Therefore, **Homo Erectus** is the species that the passage definitively identifies as regularly walking upright.
"
German nausena dusre vishva yuddh ke dauran kya karna chahti thi?,"The correct answer is **B: Britain ko saamaan aur logon ko paane se rokna** (Prevent Britain from receiving supplies and people).

Here's why:

* The passage states that the German navy primarily used U-boats to try and **stop this traffic** – meaning to prevent supplies and troops from reaching Britain.
* Option B accurately reflects this action: preventing the flow of supplies and people to Britain.
* Option A is partially correct (stopping supplies), but doesn't include the people aspect mentioned in the passage.
* Options C and D are incorrect as the German navy's focus was specifically on the transatlantic traffic to Britain, not transporting goods across the entire Atlantic or targeting America.



"
"Passage mein di gayi jankaari ke hisab se, uttari atlantic abhiyan ke dauran kise nausena yudh mein sabse jada safalta mili?","The correct answer is **D: British**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the US was trying to transport troops and supplies to Britain to help them. It also mentions that the German navy was trying to *stop* this traffic using U-boats. The passage ends with the implication that if the Allied efforts (primarily British and American) had failed, Germany might have won the war because they would have controlled Europe. Therefore, the British, along with the Americans, were the ones who were *successful* in the North Atlantic campaign in maintaining the flow of supplies.  While the Germans were actively trying to disrupt it, the campaign's success hinges on the Allies' ability to keep the routes open.
"
Assyrians ne jab ghudsavaari shuru ki thi tab konsi cheez majud nhi thi?,"सही उत्तर है: **A: Kathi**

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""कathi ka aavishkar nahin hua tha, isliye assyrian ghudsavaar apne ghodon ke nangi peeth par baith kar ladey."" जिसका मतलब है कि जब असीरियाई ने घुड़सवारी शुरू की थी, तो कठी का आविष्कार नहीं हुआ था।
"
Ghudsavaari ka istemal karne wali ladaiyan kaise ladi jati hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Ghodon ke peeth par baith kar**.

The passage states: ""kathi ka aavishkar nahin hua tha, isliye assyrian ghudsavaar apne ghodon ke nangi peeth par baith kar ladey."" This directly translates to ""since the stirrup hadn't been invented, the Assyrian horse archers fought sitting on the bare backs of their horses."" Therefore, they fought *on* the horses' backs.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, apko ak ausat Babylon ka nivaasi kahan nhi milega?","The correct answer is **D: Aantarik garbhagrih mein bali lane ke liye**.

Here's why:

The passage states that only priests could enter the inner sanctuary (antarik garbhagrih).  It also mentions that people brought sacrifices (bali) *for* the gods, implying that the general populace wouldn't have access to the inner sanctum.  Therefore, an average Babylonian citizen wouldn't be found sacrificing in the inner sanctuary. The other options (A, B, and C) are all mentioned as activities involving the general populace."
Inme se khas taur par pujariyon ke liye kya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Aantarik garbhagrih (Inner sanctum)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Pratyek mandir mein mandir ka ek khula praangan tha aur phir ek aantarik garbhagrih tha jismein kewal pujari hi pravesh kar sakte the.""  This translates to ""Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctum into which only priests could enter.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tyauhaar (Festivals):** While priests participate in festivals, the festival itself isn't a space *specifically* for priests.
* **C: Ayojan (Arrangements/Organizing):** Priests organize things, but the organizing itself isn't a physical space.
* **D: Ziggurats:** Ziggurats were part of the temple complex, but they weren't *specifically* for priests to occupy. They were the towers dedicated to the deity.



"
Raja Tutankhaman ko kab prasiddhi mili?,"The correct answer is **C: Unki kabr milne ke baad** (After his tomb was found).

The passage explicitly states: ""jabki puraane kayee makbaron ko loot lia gaya tha, is makbare ko binaa kisichhedchhad ke chhod diya gaya tha. Tutankhamen ke saath dafanaae gaye zyaadaatar saamanon ko acchi tarah se sanrakshit rakhaa gaya hai, jismein moolyavaan dhatuon aur durlabh ratnon se bane hazaaron shilpakritiyaan shamil hain."" and ""jabki 1922 mein unki kabr ke khojne unhein ek charchit vyakti banaa diya."" (While many ancient tombs had been looted, this tomb was left untouched. Most of the treasures buried with Tutankhamun were well preserved, including thousands of artifacts made of valuable metals and rare jewels. However, it was in 1922 that the discovery of his tomb made him a celebrated figure.)



"
Kis cheez ki wajah se Raja Tutankhama misra ke prasiddh raajaon mein se ek bane?,"The correct answer is **A: Binaa kisi chhedchhad ke mili unki kabr (Their tomb was found intact).**

The passage explicitly states: ""jabki puraane kayee makbaron ko loot lia gaya tha, is makbare ko binaa kisichhedchhad ke chhod diya gaya tha."" This means Tutankhamun's tomb was remarkably untouched, which is what made him famous.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Prachin raajaon ke soochi mein naam (Their name in the ancient kings' lists):** The passage says he wasn't considered important in ancient times and wasn't on the lists.
* **C: Unki kabr se hazaron kalakritiyon ki loot (The looting of thousands of artifacts from their tomb):** The passage says the tomb was *intact*, implying no looting had occurred.
* **D: Prachin misra kaal ke dauran unka mahatv (Their importance during the ancient Egyptian period):** The passage indicates he wasn't important during his lifetime.



"
Greece ke kavi Homer kya nhi kar sakte the?,"The correct answer is **A: Behre the**.

The passage explicitly states that Homer was ""mahaan andhe kavi"" (great blind poet). Therefore, he could not have been deaf.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Andhe the** - The passage states he *was* blind.
* **C: Langde the** - The passage doesn't mention anything about him being lame.
* **D: Gunge the** - The passage doesn't mention anything about him being mute.



"
Greece ka konsa prasidh vyakti saahitya ke alawa kisi anya cheez ke liye jana jata tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Pythagorus**.

Here's why:

*   The passage states that Pythagorus is known for the theorem on the sides of triangles. This is a mathematical achievement, not literary.
*   Homer is known *only* for his poetry (the Iliad and the Odyssey).
*   Sophocles and Aristophanes are specifically mentioned as playwrights (natakkar).

Therefore, Pythagorus is the only one listed who is known for something *other than* literature."
Hibru parivar apna adhikansh jeevan kahan bitate the?,"The correct answer is **A: Khuli hawa mein** (In the open air).

The text explicitly states: ""Hibru parivar ka adhikansh jeevan khuli hawa mein bitaa."" which translates to ""The majority of the Hebrew family's life was spent in the open air.""
"
Hibru parivar ke liye kya jayad zaruri nhi tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Unke ghar (Their house)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Madhyapoorv ke garm jalvaayu mein ghar utna zaruri nahin tha"" which translates to ""In the hot climate of the Middle East, a house was not that necessary.""  This directly answers the question of what was *not* particularly important for the Hebrew family.
"
Inme se kise scandinavian deshon ke bich antar ke rup mein nhi btaya gaya?,"The correct answer is **B: zameen (land)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that there were differences between Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland in terms of:

*   **Log (People):**  The passage mentions different people existing in each nation.
*   **Reeti-rivaajon (Customs/Traditions):**  The passage mentions differences in customs.
*   **Itihas (History):** The passage mentions differences in history.

While geography/land is a defining characteristic of each country, the passage focuses on cultural and societal differences, *not* geographical differences, as a distinction between the Scandinavian nations. Therefore, ""zameen"" (land) is the one element *not* presented as a difference."
Greenland ko sabse pehle kisne basaaya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Eskimo janjaati**.

The passage clearly states: ""Lekin unki khoj par dhyan diye binaa, eskimo janjaati us samay pahle se hi vahan rah rahi thi."" (But, without paying attention to their discovery, the Eskimo tribes had been living there long before.)

While Erik the Red is credited with discovering Greenland and naming it, the Eskimo people were already there. Therefore, the Eskimo tribes were the first to settle Greenland.
"
Konsa group kursiyon par baithkar khana nhi khaata?,"Correct Answer: **C: Roman ke ameer admi**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""jahaan garib log aur mahila kursiyon par baithkar khana khaate the, vahin ameer log miljulkar daavaten karna pasand karte the aur bhojan karte vakt way mauj masti karte the.""

This directly tells us that wealthy men preferred to dine together, having feasts and enjoying themselves, *not* sitting on chairs while eating.
"
Inme se konsi cheez prachin roman bhojan ka hissa nhi thi?,"The correct answer is **D: Bhuni hui Turkey ki thali (Roasted Turkey)**.

The passage explicitly states that ancient Romans did not have access to foods from America or Asia, including turkey. Options A, B, and C are all mentioned as being part of ancient Roman dining customs."
Passage ke hisab se inme se kiska asar lambe samay tak padne ki sambhavna nhi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Chhoti sanskritiya (छोटी संस्कृतियां)**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

पाठ में कहा गया है कि ""छोटी संस्कृतियाँ बिना ब्याने ऐतिहासिक सबूतों के खत्म हो जाती हैं और उन्हें सभ्यता का दर्जा नहीं मिल पाता।"" इसका मतलब है कि छोटी संस्कृतियों के लंबे समय तक बने रहने की संभावना कम होती है, जबकि सभ्यतागत संस्कृति, जो पीढ़ियों से ज्ञान का हस्तांतरण करती है और एक स्थिर सांस्कृतिक प्रतीक और निष्पक्ष प्रसार का प्रतिनिधित्व करती है, के लंबे समय तक बने रहने की संभावना अधिक होती है।
"
Passage ke hisab se rashtra se pehle kya hota hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sabhyataagat sanskriti**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""ek sabhyataagat sanskriti ka kayee peedhiyon mein gyaan ka paarit hona, ek tika hua saanskritik padchinh aur nishpaksh prasaar.""  This means a civilized culture exists *before* the formation of city-states (shahar-rajya). City-states are described as ""water ways of nations"" (rashtron ke agua), suggesting they are a development *within* a broader, established civilized culture.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ek bade samooh mein saanjha ki jane wali sabhyata** - This describes a *component* of a civilized culture, not the overarching concept.
* **C: Shahar-rajya** - The passage says city-states are *derived from* a civilized culture, not the other way around.
* **D: Chhoti sanskritiyan** - While small cultures can disappear, the passage says a civilized culture is defined by the *transmission of knowledge over generations*, implying a more stable foundation.



"
Drukgyal Dzong ke bare mein konsa kathan sahi nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Tibbati-Mangol sena ki jeet ke jashan manane ke liye banaya gaya tha**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the Dzong was built in memory of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel's victory *against* the Tibetan-Mongol armies. Option A claims it was built *to celebrate* their victory, which is the opposite of what the passage says.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: yah Bhutaan mein hai** - The passage clearly states Drukgyal Dzong is in Paro, Bhutan.
* **C: Aag ne kille ke kai avasheshon ko khatam kar diya** - The passage mentions that ""aag lagane ke baad kille ko sanrakshit aur surakshit rakhaa gaya, Bhutaan ka sabse shandar aakarshak jagahon mein se ek banaa hua hai."" This implies that the fire damaged it, and only remnants remained.
* **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ne banavaaya tha** - The passage explicitly states that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel commissioned the construction of the Dzong.



"
Konsa kathan Drukgyal Dzong mein aag ke parinam ke bare mein sahi batata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ke chitra ka ak matra avashesh**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""1951 mein, aug ke karan drukgyal ongon ke kewal kuch hi avashesh bache, jaise ki Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ka chitra.""  This directly translates to ""In 1951, due to fire, only a few remnants of Drukgyal Dzong remained, such as the image of Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tibbati-mangol senaaon ki jeet:** The passage states the Dzong was built to commemorate victory over them, but the fire *caused* the loss of the Dzong, not the victory.
* **C: Kille ki lokpriyata par koi asar nhi padha:** The passage explicitly says the Dzong became one of Bhutan's most beautiful attractions *after* being protected after the fire. Therefore, the fire *did* affect its popularity.
* **D: Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel ne surakshit rakha:**  The passage says the Dzong was *protected* *after* the fire, not that Zhabdrung Ngawang Namgyel protected it *during* the fire.



"
Inme se konsa kathan kambodiya ke bare mein sahi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Thaai logon ne Phnom Phen ko nashta kar diya.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Thaai logonne 18ween sadi mein kayee baar kambodiya par hamla kiya aur saal 1772 mein Phnom Phen ko nashta kar diya."" (Thai people attacked Cambodia many times in the 18th century and destroyed Phnom Penh in the year 1772.)
* **Option A is incorrect:** The passage states that Vietnamese attacked Phnom Penh, not Thai.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage states that Thai people attacked Cambodia, not the other way around.
* **Option C is incorrect:** The passage states that Vietnamese attacked Cambodia in the *later* 18th century, not the early part.

Therefore, only option D accurately reflects information provided in the passage."
Inme se konsa kathan Kambodiya par aakramanon ka sahi varnan karta hai?,"The best answer is **D: Thaai logon ne Kambodiya par kai baar aakraman kiya.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Thaai logonne 18ween sadi mein kayee baar kambodiya par hamla kiya..."" (Thai people attacked Cambodia many times in the 18th century...)
* **Option A is partially correct but incomplete.** While Vietnam did attack, the passage emphasizes Thai attacks more.
* **Option B is incorrect.** While Thai and Vietnamese attacks happened, 1772 is specifically mentioned as the year the Thais destroyed Phnom Penh, and it doesn't represent *all* the attacks.
* **Option C is incorrect.** The passage states the *Thais* destroyed Phnom Penh in 1772, not the Vietnamese.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate and comprehensive representation of the information provided in the passage.
"
Ditch east india company ne taiwan mein apne samay ke dauran inme se kya kiya?,"The correct answer is **A: Dakshin-paschimi taiwan mein ek base ki asthapna ki**.

The text explicitly states: ""1624 mein, Dutch East India Company ne dakshin-paschimi taiwan mein ek base ki asthapna ki, jo adivasi anaaj utpaadan ke tariko mein parivartan ki shuruat kar rahi thi aur chini majdooron ko apne chawal aur chini baganon par kam karne ke liye niyukt kar rahi thi."" 

While options B and C are things the Dutch East India Company *started*, option A is the direct action they took in Taiwan according to the text. Option D is something that happened *after* the Dutch East India Company left.
"
Shimonoseki ki sandhi ne kya kiya?,"The correct answer is **D: Taiwan par Japan ka adhikar (Japan's authority over Taiwan)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""1895 mein, pratham chin-japan yuddh (1894-1895) mein haar ke baad, ching sarkar shimonoseki ke sandhi par hastakshar karti hai, jiske dwara wah taiwan ki samprabhuta japan ko saunp deti hai, jo 1945 tak dweep par raja karta hai."" 
* This translates to: ""After the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Shimonoseki Treaty, by which it ceded Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.""

Therefore, the treaty resulted in Japan gaining control over Taiwan.
"
Kisi rasayan ka ph star kaise maapa jata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Chemical mein Hydrogen aayan ki matra**.

Here's why:

* **pH** is specifically defined as a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+) in a solution. 
* A higher concentration of H+ means a lower pH (more acidic), and a lower concentration of H+ means a higher pH (more alkaline or basic).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Rasayan kitna amleeya yaa aadhaarbhoot (kshaariya) hai:** This is a description of what pH *indicates*, not *how it's measured*.
* **B: Chemical mein kitne protons hote hain:**  While hydrogen ions *do* contain protons, the pH is a measure of the *concentration* of these ions, not the total number of protons in the molecule.
* **D: Chemical mein kitne electron hote hain:** Electrons are involved in chemical bonding, but they don't directly determine the pH of a solution. The pH is about the presence of hydrogen ions.



"
Hydrogen aayan se kya hataya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Electrons**.

Here's why:

The text states that hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed. This means hydrogen ions are essentially protons *without* their electrons.

Therefore, the answer is **D**.
"
Inme se konsa kathan Share pride ka satik varnan nahi karta?,"The correct answer is **B: Ner-Maadaaen anupat nhi hain** (The male-female ratio is not balanced).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Sheron ka samooh vayask ner ke saath-saath teesse zyada maadaa aur shavakon ke saath ekse teen tak ka banaa hota hai"" which translates to ""A pride of lions consists of three times as many females as males, and from one to three cubs.""  This means the male-female ratio *is* significantly unbalanced, with many more females than males.

The other options are all supported by the passage:

* **A: Kafee hadd tak kutton ke tarah vyavhaar karte hain** (They behave quite like dogs):  The passage says ""Sheron ka samooh kafee hadd tak bhediyon yaa kutton ke jhund ke tarah kam karta hai..."" (A lion pride functions quite like a pack of wolves or dogs...).
* **C: Ner aur maadaaen ek-dusre ke karib judee hoti hain** (Males and females are closely related): The passage mentions ""...maadaaen aam taur par ek-dusre ke karib judee hoti hain"" (...females are usually closely related to each other).
* **D: Ve ghatak aur samajik dono hain** (They are both predatory and social): The passage states ""...aur apne shikar ke liye bahut ghaatak bhi hote hain"" (...and are also very deadly for their prey) and ""...Sheron ka samooh kafee hadd tak bhediyon yaa kutton ke jhund ke tarah kam karta hai"" (...A lion pride functions quite like a pack of wolves or dogs, which implies a social structure).



Therefore, the statement that the male-female ratio is not balanced is the inaccurate description."
Inme se konsa kathan Shareon ke vyavhaar ka satik varnan nahi karta?,"The correct answer is **D: Ve kafee hadd tak billiyon ki tarah vayvhaar karte hain.**

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that lions *do not* behave like domestic cats. It says: ""Sheron ka samooh kafee hadd tak bhediyon yaa kutton ke jhund ke tarah kam karta hai, jo janwar vyavhaar mein aashcharyajanak roop mein sheron (lekin any badee billiyon) ke samaan hote hain...""  This means they behave more like wolves or dogs, not cats.

Let's look at why the other options *are* accurate according to the text:

*   **A: ve bahut samajik hote hain:** The text states, ""Share pride namak badey samoohon mein rahne vaali sabse badee samajik billiyaan hain."" (Pride lions are the largest social cats living in large groups.)
*   **B: Kafee hadd tak bhediyon ki tarah vayvhaar karte hain:**  As mentioned above, the text directly compares their behavior to wolf packs.
*   **C: Ner aur maada apne shikar ke liye bahut ghaatak hote hain:** The text says, ""...aur apne shikar ke liye bahut ghaatak bhi hote hain."" (...and are also very deadly for their prey.)



"
Khargosh aam taur par kis tarah ke shikariyon ka shikar hote hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Chhoti billiyaan**.

The passage states: ""Unke ant mein, kayee Aisi chhoti billiyaan (loose pet cats sahit) hain jo keat, rodents, chhipkaliyon aur pakshiyon jaise kayee chhote jeevon ko khaati hain."" This translates to ""Among them, many such small cats (including stray pet cats) eat many small animals such as rats, rodents, lizards and birds.""  Since rabbits are small animals, small cats are their predators.
"
Chhoti billiyaan aam taur par inme se kiska shikar karti hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Rodents**.

The passage states: ""Ant mein, kayee Aisi chhoti billiyaan (loose pet cats sahit) hain jo keat, rodents, chhipkaliyon aur pakshiyon jaise kayee chhote jeevon ko khaati hain."" (In addition, many such small cats (including stray pet cats) eat various small creatures like rats, lizards and birds).

While the passage mentions other animals small cats *can* eat, rodents (rats, mice, etc.) are listed first and are generally considered a common prey for small cats. The other options (rabbits, deer, gazelles) are mentioned as prey for larger cats, not small ones.
"
Inme se konsa Ocelot ke shikar ka tarika nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Sirf chhote jaanvaron ka shikar karte hain** (Only hunt small animals).

Here's why:

The text states: ""yadi way pakad sakein, toh way bandaron, saanpon, krintakon aur pakshiyon ko pakad lenge"" which translates to ""if they can catch them, they will catch monkeys, snakes, lizards and birds"". This clearly shows that ocelots hunt animals larger than just small ones.

The other options are all mentioned in the text as part of how ocelots hunt:

* **A: Parivesh ke hisab se dhalna (Moving stealthily through the environment):** The text says they can move very quietly.
* **B: Apne shikar ki sugandh ka peecha karna (Following the scent of their prey):** The text mentions scientists believe they use scent to track prey.
* **C: Apne shikar ka raat mein peecha karna (Hunting at night):** The text states they see very well in the dark.



"
Inme se konsa Ocelot ka sahi se varnan nhi karta? ,"The correct answer is **C: Unke soonghne ki kshamta kam hain (Their ability to smell is weak)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Vaigyaanikon ka maanana hai ki ocelots gandh ke dwara jaanvaron ka peechha karte aur khaate (shikar) hain, yah soonghate hue ki way meenan par kahaan rahe honge.""  This translates to: ""Scientists believe that ocelots hunt and eat animals by following their scent, sniffing out where their prey might be.""

Therefore, the statement that ocelots have poor smelling abilities is **incorrect** according to the provided text. The other options are all directly supported by the passage.
"
Inme se kise bagh ki sabse badi takat nahi mana jata?,"The correct answer is **A: Dahaad (Roar)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Bagh ke dahaad kisi share ke tez aawaaz vaali dahaad ke tarah nahin hoti hai, lekinuski bandhi hui, chillaane jaisi hoti hai.""  This means the tiger's roar is *not* considered its strongest ability, unlike its climbing, jumping, or pulling strength. The passage implies the roar is less powerful than a lion's.
"
Passage ke hisab se bagh aur sher mein kya antar hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dahaadne ki aawaz (Roaring sound)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Bagh ke dahaad kisi share ke tez aawaaz vaali dahaad ke tarah nahin hoti hai, lekinuski bandhi hui, chillaane jaisi hoti hai."" (A tiger's roar is not like a lion's loud roar, but it is constricted, like a scream.)
* The passage also mentions that only tigers (and lions) can roar.
* The other options (swimming ability, jumping distance, pulling strength) are mentioned as abilities of tigers, but the passage focuses on the *difference* in their roars.

Therefore, the key distinction highlighted in the passage between tigers and lions is the quality of their roar.
"
Passage ke hisab se Robert Hook biologist se pehle kya kaam karte the?,"The correct answer is **A: Mrit koshikaon ka nireekshan**.

The passage explicitly states: ""wah (robbert hook) mrit koshikaon ka nireekshan karne waale pehle vyakti the."" (wah (Robert Hook) the first person to observe dead cells.)
"
Cell ka kya matlab hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Chhota kamra**.

The passage states: ""Sell latin shabd cellase aata hai jiska earth hai chhota kamra."" This directly translates to ""The Latin word 'cell' comes from the word for small room.""  Therefore, the definition of a cell is a small room.
"
Passage ke hisab se adhikatar janwar kya kar sakte hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Chalna**

The passage states: ""Adhikatar janwar chal sakte hain."" which translates to ""Most animals can walk.""
"
Passage ke hisab se kuch janwaron ke pass kya nhi hota?,"The correct answer is **C: Dimag**.

The passage states: ""Kewal jaanvaron mein dimag hota hai (haalaanki sabhi jaanvaron mein nahin hota hai; udaaharan ke liye, jelifish mein dimag nahin hota hai)."" This translates to ""Only animals have a brain (although not all animals have one; for example, jellyfish do not have a brain).""

Therefore, according to the passage, not all animals have a brain. The other options are incorrect because the passage says animals are made of cells, they eat and digest their food, and they can all move (most do)."
Photosynthesis ki prakriya se paudhon ko kya milta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhojan (Food)**.

The paragraph states: ""Paudhe photosynthesis dwara suryase apna bhojan banaate hain"" which translates to ""Plants make their own food through photosynthesis.""
"
Manushya kya saass chhodte hain jo paudhe saass lete hain?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon dioxide**.

The passage states: ""Paudhe oxygen banaate hain jiska upayog manushya saas lene mein karte hain aur way carbon-dioxide lete hain jo manushya saasse chhodate hain (yaani saas chhodate hain).""  This translates to: ""Plants make oxygen which humans use to breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide which humans exhale (i.e., breathe out).""
"
Passage ke hisab se inme se konsa udharan vikas ki prakriya mein badha banega?,"The correct answer is **C: Abadi apne aap ko naye mahul mein dhal rahi hai (The population is adapting to the new environment).**

Here's why:

* The passage describes speciation as a process where a population adapts to a new environment. This adaptation, driven by the need to survive and compete in the new environment, is a crucial step in the development and evolution of species.
* Options A, B, and D describe events *leading up to* speciation, but not the adaptation itself.  The adaptation *is* the process of development and evolution.

Therefore, the adaptation to the new environment (option C) is the most direct and accurate answer to the question of what contributes to the process of development and evolution.
"
Inme se konsa kathan prajaatikaran ka sateek varnan nhi karta? ,"सही उत्तर है **D: Iska hona zaruri hai**।

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* **Prajaatikaran (प्रजातिकरण) अनिवार्य नहीं है:** जबकि prajaatikaran एक संभावित परिणाम है जब एक आबादी विभाजित हो जाती है, यह हमेशा नहीं होता है। कभी-कभी, विभाजित आबादी एक ही प्रजाति के रूप में बनी रह सकती है, भले ही उनके बीच कुछ अंतर विकसित हों। यह हमेशा ज़रूरी नहीं होता।

अन्य विकल्प prajaatikaran का सही वर्णन करते हैं:

* **A: Yah tab hota hai jab koi abadi kisi mahul mein nhi dhal paati (यह तब होता है जब कोई आबादी किसी माहौल में ढल नहीं पाती):** prajaatikaran तब शुरू होता है जब एक आबादी एक नए और अलग माहौल में प्रवेश करती है।
* **B: Yah vikas ka ek bahut mahatvapurn hissa hai (यह विकास का एक बहुत महत्वपूर्ण हिस्सा है):** prajaatikaran विकास और जैव विविधता का एक मूलभूत चालक है।
* **C: Issne ek nayi prajati banti hai (इससे एक नई प्रजाति बनती है):** prajaatikaran का अंतिम परिणाम एक नई प्रजाति का निर्माण हो सकता है।

इसलिए, विकल्प D गलत है क्योंकि prajaatikaran हमेशा नहीं होता है।"
Circulatory system ka konsa hissa rakt ko hriday tak le jata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhamani**.

Here's why:

* **Dhamani (Arteries)** carry blood *away* from the heart.
* **Keshika (Veins)** carry blood *towards* the heart.
* **Ang (Artery)** is a general term for a blood vessel, but less specific than ""Dhamani.""
* **Nasen (Veins)** is a misspelling of ""Nasen"" which is likely meant to be ""Nacen"", but isn't a standard term in this context.  It refers to veins.

The question asks which part carries blood *to* the heart.  Therefore, the answer must be the arteries (Dhamani).
"
Circulatory system mein konsi naliyan sabse chhoti hoti hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Keshika**.

The text states: ""sabse patali nalika ko keshika kahaa jaataa hai"" which translates to ""the thinnest tube is called a केशिका (keshika)"". केशिका (keshika) are capillaries, and they are the smallest blood vessels in the circulatory system.
"
Keede ke apne pankha ko vaapas apne shareer par lane ke kshamta inme se kis cheez ko badhati hai?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Shikariyon se chhipane**

यहाँ क्यों:

पाठ स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि कीड़ों के अपने पंखों को शरीर पर वापस मोड़ने की क्षमता उन्हें शिकारियों से छिपने के लिए बहुत कम जगह देती है। अन्य विकल्प (भोजन लाना, साथी ढूँढना, उड़ने की गति) पाठ में सीधे तौर पर इस क्षमता से जुड़े नहीं हैं।
"
Inme se konse cheez passage mein nhi batayi gayi hai jo keede ki urdne ki kshamta ko prabhavit karti hai?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Prajanan (प्रजनन)**।

यहां बताया गया है कि यह उत्तर क्यों सही है और अन्य विकल्प क्यों नहीं:

* **प्रजनन (Prajanan):** लेख में कीड़ों की उड़ने की क्षमता और उनके फायदे के बारे में बात की गई है, लेकिन प्रजनन के बारे में कुछ भी नहीं कहा गया है।
* **जीवनकाल (Jeevankaal):**  लेख में उड़ने की क्षमता के फायदे बताए गए हैं, जैसे शिकारियों से बचना और भोजन खोजना।  यह निहित है कि बेहतर उड़ान संभवतः जीवनकाल को प्रभावित कर सकती है, लेकिन सीधे तौर पर उल्लेख नहीं है। 
* **भोजन इकट्ठा करना (Bhojan Ikhatta karna):** लेख स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि उड़ान की क्षमता कीड़ों को भोजन इकट्ठा करने में मदद करती है।
* **कुशलता (Kushalata):** लेख में बार-बार दक्षता (कुशलता) का उल्लेख किया गया है, विशेष रूप से भोजन खोजने और शिकारियों से बचने में।

इसलिए, केवल प्रजनन ही वह पहलू है जो लेख में संबोधित नहीं किया गया है।"
Inme se dynasore ki konsi vishesta nhai hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Pankh (Wings)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that scientists believe birds *evolved* from dinosaurs. While birds share many characteristics with dinosaurs (like laying eggs, having claws, and walking on two legs), the passage also notes that some people don't consider birds dinosaurs *because* of their wings.

Therefore, wings are presented as a distinguishing feature that prevents birds from being solely categorized as dinosaurs. The passage highlights that birds share many characteristics with dinosaurs, but the presence of wings differentiates them.
"
Inme se kise aam taur par pakshiyon aur dynasore ki visheshta nhi mana jata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Urne ki kshamta (The ability to fly)**.

Here's why:

The passage describes birds as descendants of dinosaurs. It highlights features like:

*   Having claws (panje wale pair)
*   Laying eggs (ande dete hain)
*   Walking on two legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex (do peechhe vaale pairon par chalte hain)

While birds *are* generally known for their ability to fly, the question asks which characteristic is *not* commonly associated with both birds and dinosaurs.  The passage doesn't mention dinosaurs being able to fly. The other options (laying eggs and having claws) are features explicitly mentioned as shared between birds and dinosaurs.

Therefore, the ability to fly is the distinguishing characteristic that isn't universally agreed upon for all dinosaurs, and thus the correct answer."
Passage ke hisab se triceratops cycads paudhe kis hisse ko khate hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Taney**.

The passage states: ""Triceratops prajaati ke dynasore, paid ke taney khanese pehle unaki pattiyon aur tahaniyon ko apni shaktishali chonchse todkar alag kar sakte the.""  This translates to ""Triceratops dinosaurs, before eating the tree's stems, could break off its leaves and branches with their powerful beaks."" While they did eat leaves and branches, they first targeted the stems."
Passage ke hisab se triceratops inme se konsa khana sabse adhik khaate hai? ,"Correct answer is **B: Sakht shaakhaon wale paid**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Triceratops...were able to crush even tough branches and roots."" and ""They could tear off the leaves and twigs of the plant with their powerful beak before eating the trunk."" This indicates they primarily ate the tough branches.
* **While the passage mentions cycads (a type of plant with tough branches) and their potential toxicity, it doesn't say Triceratops ate the toxic parts.** The passage focuses on their ability to process tough branches.
* **Sloths and Parrots are mentioned as modern-day animals that *can* eat toxic leaves/fruits.** This is irrelevant to what Triceratops likely ate.
* **Triceratops did not eat toxic fruit.**

Therefore, based on the information provided in the passage, Triceratops primarily ate tough branches.
"
Passage ke hisab se inme se konse khel Italy ke uttari kshetron mein lokpriya hain?,"Correct Answer: **C: Snowboarding**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Antarrashtriya khelon aur olympic spardhaon mein pratispardha karne vaale italians ke saath, **shitkaleen khel uttari kshetron mein sabse lokpriya hain**."" This translates to ""Along with Italians competing in international and Olympic competitions, **winter sports are most popular in the northern regions**.""
* **Snowboarding** is a winter sport. 
* The passage mentions F1 motor racing, but it's not explicitly stated to be popular in the northern regions; it's a global sport.
* Football, volleyball, and water polo are generally played year-round and aren't specifically linked to winter sports or northern regions in the passage.



Therefore, the best answer is **C: Snowboarding**. Note that ""shitkaleen khel"" means winter sports."
Passage ke hisab se Italy ne inme se kis khel ki championship jeete?,"The correct answer is **A: Football**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Safarata ke mamle mein, Germany ke rashtriya football team ke baad italy ke rashtriya football team aatee hai, yefifa world cup 2006 ke vijeta the."" This translates to: ""In terms of success, after the German national football team, the Italian national football team comes, they were the winners of the FIFA World Cup 2006.""  This directly links Italy to winning the football championship.
"
Kis ghatna ke baad Luxembourg ka kuch hissa belgium ka hissa ban gaya?,"The correct answer is **B: Belgium kranti**.

The passage states: ""Vartamaan mein belgium ka hissa ateet mein luxemberg ka hissa tha lekin 1830 ke dashak ke belgium kranti ke baad belgium bn gaya."" (Currently, Belgium includes a part of what was formerly Luxembourg, but became Belgium after the Belgium Revolution in the 1830s.)
"
Inme se kisne Luxembourg ki tatasth par asar dala?,"The correct answer is **A: Germany ka kabza**.

Here's why:

* **Germany's Occupation:** The text explicitly states that Germany occupied Luxembourg during both World Wars. This directly impacted Luxembourg's neutrality.
* **European Union Membership:** While joining the European Union *influenced* Luxembourg, it didn't directly *impede* its neutrality. In fact, it might have reinforced it by integrating Luxembourg into a larger political and economic framework.
* **Belgium Revolution:** The Belgium Revolution led to the creation of Belgium, but it didn't directly affect Luxembourg's neutrality.
* **Becoming an Independent Nation:**  Becoming independent in 1839 was a step *towards* maintaining neutrality, but it was the occupation that *tested* and potentially compromised it.



Therefore, Germany's occupation is the most direct answer to the question of what impacted Luxembourg's neutrality.



"
Turkey ke kul kshetrafal mein se kitna varg kilometre Europe mein hai?,"The correct answer is **D: 23764**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Turkey ke kshetrane ise vishwa ka 37van sabse bada desh banaa diya hai, aur iska aakar metropolitan fraans aur united kingdom dono ko milakar bane kshetra ke barabar hai. Turkey teen aurse samudrase ghiraa hua hai: paschim mein Aegean sagar se, uttar mein kala sagar se aur dakshin mein bhoomadhya sagarse. Turkey ka ilaka, jhilon sahit, 783,562 varg kilometres (300,948 varg meal) par hain ,jismein se 755,688 varg kilometres (291,773 varg meal) dakshin paschim asia mein aur **23,764 varg kilometres (9,174 varg meal) europe mein hain**.""
"
Passage ke hisab se Turkey lagbhag kitne mile lambi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: 1000**.

The passage states: ""Turkey ka kshetrafal 1,600 kilometres (1,000 meter) lamba aur 800 kilo meter (500 meal) chauda hai..."" which translates to ""Turkey's area is 1,600 kilometers (1,000 meter) long and 800 kilo meter (500 meal) wide...""

Therefore, based on the passage, Turkey is approximately 1000 kilometers long.
"
Vatican city mein latin bhasha ka istemal kis mein kiya jata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Dhaarmik rasmein (Religious ceremonies)**.

The text explicitly states: ""jabki latin ka dhaarmik rasmon mein istemal kiya jaataa hai"" which translates to ""while Latin is used in religious ceremonies.""
"
Vatican city mein Italian bhasha ka istemal kis mein nhi kiya jata?,"The correct answer is **C: Dhaarmik rasmein**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Itailiyan bhi rozaanaa istemal hone vaali bhasha hai jise rajya mein kam karne vaale adhikansh log upayog mein laate hain, jabki latin ka dhaarmik rasmon mein istemal kiya jaataa hai.""  This directly tells us that Latin is used in religious ceremonies, not Italian.
"
Passage ke hisab se parishkrit computer par dhwani ko mix karke inme se konsa fayda hota hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sangeet (Music)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Dhwani ko process aur ek saath mix karne ke liye parishkrit computer ka upayog karke sangeet record kiya jaataa hai.""  This translates to: ""The computer is used to process and mix sound together to record music.""

Therefore, the benefit mentioned is for music.
"
Passage ke hisab se inme se kis jagah par lagbhag har ghar mein ek flush shauchalaya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Mohenjo-daro**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hadappa aur Mohenjo-daro ke shaharon mein lagbhag har ghar mein ek flush shauchalaya tha..."" which translates to ""In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet...""
"
Inme se kis jagah par behatar sivej system hai?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Harappa**।

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* **Harappa:** प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि हरप्पा और मोहनजोदड़ो के शहरों में लगभग हर घर में एक फ्लश शौचालय था जो एक विकसित सीवर सिस्टम से जुड़ा हुआ था। यह एक उन्नत सीवर सिस्टम का प्रमाण है।
* **Santorini:** प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि मिनीओन शहरों में सीवर सिस्टम के अवशेष पाए गए हैं, लेकिन यह हरप्पा के विकसित सिस्टम की तुलना में कम व्यापक है।
* **Egypt और China:** प्रश्न में इन जगहों पर शौचालयों का उल्लेख है, लेकिन यह नहीं बताया गया है कि उनके पास हरप्पा और मोहनजोदड़ो के शहरों के सीवर सिस्टम के समान विकसित सीवर सिस्टम था या नहीं।
* **Rome:** रोमन सीवर सिस्टम मौजूद थे, लेकिन वे सार्वजनिक स्नानघरों से जुड़े थे, जो हरप्पा और मोहनजोदड़ो के घरों में मौजूद व्यक्तिगत शौचालयों के व्यापक नेटवर्क के समान नहीं है।

इसलिए, हरप्पा में सबसे अच्छा विकसित सीवर सिस्टम था।"
Inme se kis vajah se skate mudata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Blade thoda sa ghumaavdaar tall (Blade thoda sa ghumaavdaar tall)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kyonki blade ka tall thoda ghumaavdaar hota hai, jisase blade ek taraf yaa doosri taraf jhuk jaati hai aur jo kinare barf ke sampark mein hoti hai, wah bhi mud jaati hai. is karan skater mudataa hai.""  This directly explains that the curved shape of the blade's sole is the reason for the turning action.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Skate ke blade ke dodhari kinare (Skate ke blade ke dodhari kinare):** While the double edges are important for gripping the ice, the passage doesn't say they cause the turning.  The curved sole is the key factor.
* **C: Skater ki skill (Skater ki skill):**  While a skater *controls* the turning, the passage describes *why* the skates turn in the first place, independent of the skater's skill.
* **D: Barf ki quality (Barf ki quality):** The passage doesn't mention ice quality as a factor in the turning mechanism.



"
Passage ke hisab se inme se kaun si cheez adhunik ice skate ke khokhlepan ka sateek varnan karti hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Avatal (hollow)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Aadhunik eyes skate par lagey blade dodhari hoti hai aur unke beach ek **avtal khokhla aakar** hota hai.""  This translates to ""Modern ice skates have blades that are double-edged and have a **hollow, concave shape** at their bottom.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dohare kinare (double edges):** While true, the passage doesn't describe the ""double edges"" as the key to the hollow shape.
* **B: Ghumaavdaar (curved):**  The passage mentions the blade being curved, but this isn't the description of the hollow part itself. The curve is related to the *function* of the hollow shape.
* **D: Mudanaa (bending/concave):** This describes the blade's ability to bend, which is a *result* of the hollow shape, not the shape itself.



Therefore, the passage directly identifies the hollow shape as a key feature of modern ice skates.
"
Passage ke hisab se konsi prakriya parmaanuon ko atirikt oorjaa se chhutkara dilati hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Vikiran ka uttejit utsarjan**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Vaigyaanik is prakriya ko """"vikiran ka uttejit utsarjan"""" kahte hain...""  which translates to ""Scientists call this process 'stimulated emission'."" This process is the one that allows atoms to release excess energy by emitting photons.
"
Parmaanuon photon ko kyu nikalte hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Tez prakash ki vajah se utsarjan** (Emission due to intense light).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Way prakash ke ek chhote kn ko utsarjit karke aisaa karte hain jise photon kahaa jaataa hai."" (They do this by emitting a small packet of light called a photon.)
* It further explains: ""Vigyanik is prakriya ko """"vikiran ka uttejit utsarjan"""" kahte hain, kyonki parmaanuon ko tez prakash dwara uttejit kiya jaataa hai, jisase prakash ke photon ka utsarjan hota hai aur prakash ek tarah ka vikiran hai."" (Scientists call this process ""stimulated emission"" because atoms are excited by intense light, causing the emission of photons, and light is a type of radiation.)

Option A is true *as a result* of the emission, but not the direct reason. Option C is incorrect and not mentioned in the passage. Option D is incorrect and contradicts the passage's explanation.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, prakash bulb kis wajah se kaam nahi karta?","The correct answer is **C: Bulb ke andar filament jal jaana**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Saikadon ghante tak kary karne ke baad bulb ka filament jal jaataa hai aur iske baad light bulb kam nahin karta."" This translates to ""After working for hundreds of hours, the bulb's filament burns out and after that the light bulb doesn't work.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Switch sahi se band na kiya jana:** The passage says you *should* turn off the switch first, implying it's a safety precaution, not the cause of the bulb not working after a certain time.
* **B: Bulb ka kuch dhaatu ka aadhar socket mein adhoora lagna:**  The passage doesn't mention any issues with the metal base in the socket.
* **D: Socket mein bijli ka pravaah dheema hona:** The passage discusses electrical shock hazards, not a slow flow of electricity.



"
Prakash bulb badalte samay inmein se kya chhuna khatarnaak ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Bulb ke neeche ka hissa (The part under the bulb)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that the part under the socket/bulb can be dangerous.  If you touch this part while the electricity is flowing, you can get a serious electric shock. The passage also highlights that this is because electricity flows through the socket.  Therefore, the part *under* the bulb is the most dangerous to touch.

Here's why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Filament:** The filament is *inside* the bulb and not directly exposed to potential shock hazards during replacement. While it's part of the electrical circuit, it isn't the immediate danger.
* **B: Prakash ka switch (Light switch):**  While the switch controls the power, it's generally designed to be safe to handle (after the power is off). The risk is in the live electrical components.
* **D: Cable:** The cable *can* be dangerous if it's damaged or frayed, but the most direct and immediate danger is from the components directly connected to the socket.



Therefore, the most dangerous part to touch while changing a light bulb is the metal part *under* the bulb that connects to the socket, which could be energized even after the switch is turned off.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, naabhik ke alag hone par kya hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Oorja nikalti hai (Energy is released)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...nucleus ko phir se vibhajit karna aur usmense kuch oorjaa nikalana."" which translates to ""...splitting the nucleus again and releasing some energy from it."" This directly indicates that when a nucleus splits (i.e., becomes unstable and breaks apart), energy is released.  This is the principle behind nuclear fission.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Protons badhte hai (Protons increase):** The passage doesn't mention protons increasing.
* **C: Parmaanu asthir hote hain (Atoms become unstable):** The passage says some nuclei are *inherently* unstable, but it doesn't say that splitting a nucleus *creates* unstable atoms. It's the splitting *process* that releases energy.
* **D: Neutrons kho jaate hain (Neutrons are lost):** While neutron loss is part of nuclear fission, the passage doesn't specifically say that neutrons are lost *upon* the nucleus separating. It talks about the energy release upon splitting.

Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is that energy is released when a nucleus splits.
"
Inmein se kya lambi doori ki call waapas Prithvi par paravartit karta hai,"The correct answer is **B: Upgrah (Satellite)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hazaaron meal door kisi ko call karne ke liye, aap satellite istemal karte hain. Antariksh mein upgrah ko call milata hai aur phir ise vaapas niche, use samay paravartit karta hai."" (To call someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite. The satellite receives the call in space and then reflects it back down).

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Telescopes:** Telescopes are used for observing space and are not directly involved in reflecting calls back to Earth.
* **C: Prakash (Light):** Light is mentioned as something affected by the atmosphere, but it's not the object that reflects the call.
* **D: Rockets:** Rockets are used to launch satellites into space, but they don't reflect calls.
"
Inmein se kya telescope ko antriksh mein rakhta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Rockets**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Space mein satellite yaa doorbeen rakhane ke liye 100 feetse zyada oonche badey roket ke zaroorat hoti hai."" (To place a satellite or telescope in space, large rockets higher than 100 feet are needed.)

Therefore, rockets are used to launch telescopes into space.
"
Samay ke beetne par nazar rakhne ke liye chakreeya ghatna ke baare mein kis baat ko dhyaan mein rakhna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **B: Dohrao (Repetition)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aap chakreeya ghatnaon ke dohrao ko gaurse dekhkar samay ke badlav ko chinhit kar sakte hain."" This translates to ""You can identify the change of time by carefully observing the repetition of cyclical events.""

Therefore, the repetition (dohrao) is the key element to focus on when tracking the passage of time using cyclical events. The passage emphasizes the recurring nature of these events.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Samay (Time):**  While the passage discusses time, it's not *what* to pay attention to *for* tracking time. It's the thing being tracked.
* **C: Asar (Effect):** The effect of a cyclical event isn't the primary way to measure time.
* **D: Mushkil (Difficult):** The passage acknowledges that time is difficult to understand, but this isn't something to *consider* when observing cyclical events for time measurement.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, samay ko ghatna ki kis baat ki tulna ke liye upyog kiya jaata hai?","The correct answer is **A: Lambaai (Length)**.

The passage states: ""Samay yah bhi hai ki hum ghatnaaon ke avadhi (lambai) ke tulna kaise karte hain."" This translates to: ""Time is also that by which we compare the duration (length) of events.""

While the passage mentions cyclical events (chakreeya ghatnaaon) and their repetition (dohrao), it specifically links time to the *comparison of event duration/length*. Therefore, length is the best fit.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, takht ke uttaradhikari ke liye kya paramparagat maana jaata hai?","सही उत्तर है **D: Sena mein jane se pehle vishvvidhyalay jana**.

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* Passage में कहा गया है कि ""parmparagat roop se, takht ka uttaradhikari schooly shiksha puri karne ke baad seedhe sena mein jayega."" जिसका अर्थ है कि पारंपरिक रूप से, उत्तराधिकारी स्कूल शिक्षा पूरी करने के बाद सीधे सेना में चले जाते हैं।
* Charles Trinity College, Cambridge में विश्वविद्यालय गए, जो पारंपरिक मार्ग से अलग था। यह इसलिए महत्वपूर्ण है क्योंकि passage में आगे कहा गया है कि Charles British शाही परिवार के पहले सदस्य थे जिन्हें डिग्री प्रदान की गई थी। इसका अर्थ है कि विश्वविद्यालय जाना पारंपरिक नहीं था, बल्कि एक असामान्य घटना थी।

इसलिए, सबसे सटीक उत्तर यह है कि पारंपरिक रूप से सेना में जाने से पहले विश्वविद्यालय जाना नहीं होता था। अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि passage में उन्हें पारंपरिक माना जाना नहीं बताया गया है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, Charles ne pehli baar kya kiya?","Correct answer is **C: Degree haasil ki**.

The passage states: ""Charles british shahi parivar ke pehle sadasya the jinhen degree pradaan ki gayi thi."" (Charles was the first member of the British royal family to be awarded a degree). This indicates that obtaining a degree was his first significant academic achievement mentioned in the passage.

While he went to Trinity College (D) and studied Archaeology (B), and the passage mentions he would have gone to the army after school (A), the most direct statement about his first accomplishment is getting the degree.
"
Trygvasson bera kis desh ka tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Norway**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Norwaywasi, Olaf Trygvasson apne desh ko danish varchasvase vaapas hassil karne ke mahatvakanksha ke saath is bere ka netritva kiya.""  This translates to ""Norwegians, Olaf Trygvasson led this raid with the ambition of regaining Danish glory for his country.""  Therefore, Trygvasson was Norwegian.
"
Itihaas mein kis samay Germany ka Estonia par bada sanskritik prabhav tha?,"The passage states that the 15th century was around the time Germany had a great cultural influence on Northern Estonia.  The passage also mentions that this happened ""15vi shatabdi ke aaspas,"" which translates to ""around the 15th century.""  

The options given are:

* A: Lagbhag 200 saal pehle (Approximately 200 years ago)
* B: Lagbhag 400 saal pehle (Approximately 400 years ago)
* C: Lagbhag 600 saal pehle (Approximately 600 years ago)
* D: Lagbhag 800 saal pehle (Approximately 800 years ago)

Since the 15th century was roughly 600 years ago, the correct answer is **C: Lagbhag 600 saal pehle (Approximately 600 years ago)**.
"
Estonia ki bhasha par kiska asar tha?,"The correct answer is **B: German varnmala**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yah german varnamala par adharit tha aur is mein ek akshar """"""""Õ/õ"""""""" jodaa gaya."" This translates to ""it was based on the German alphabet and a character """"""""Õ/õ"""""""" was added to it."" This clearly indicates that the German alphabet was the foundation for the Estonian language.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Õ/õ akshar ka:** While the addition of the ""Õ/õ"" character was significant, it's not the primary influence. It's a *part* of the German influence, not the overarching influence itself.
* **C: German bhikshu:** The German monks *introduced* the language, but the *source* of the language's structure was the German alphabet.
* **D: Ishwar:** ""Ishwar"" means God. While the monks aimed to bring God closer, it doesn't explain the linguistic influence.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, mool roop se Hindi bolne waalon ki sankhya kis aadhar par ghatti badhti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Kya Hindi jaisi boliyon ko joda jaata hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sthaaniya bhasha bolane waale logon ke sankhya is aadhar par alag ho sakti hai ki sambandhit boliyon ke ginati bahut barikise ke jaati hai yaa nahin.""  This translates to: ""The number of people speaking the local language can vary depending on whether related dialects are counted or not.""

Since Hindi and Urdu are related dialects, the number of Hindi speakers (and therefore the total number of speakers) is affected by whether Hindi and Urdu are considered separate languages or part of a larger group of related languages.  The passage explicitly mentions that Hindi and Urdu vocabularies are similar and speakers often understand each other.

Therefore, the count of Hindi speakers increases or decreases based on whether related dialects (like Urdu) are included in the calculation.



"
Hindi aur Urdu bhashaon ke liye inmein se kaunsi baat sahi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Unki lipi alag hai (Their script is different)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Hindi aur Urdu shabdakosh samaan hain lekin unaki lipi alag hai"" which translates to ""The Hindi and Urdu vocabularies are the same but their scripts are different.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aam taur par, dono bhashaon ko bolne waalon mein dohrao hai (Generally, there is overlap between speakers of both languages):** While true to some extent (they can often understand each other), the passage doesn't directly state this.
* **C: Unka shabdkosh aur lipi samaan hain (Their vocabulary and script are the same):** This is false, as the passage specifically says the scripts are different.
* **D: Unka shabdkosh alag hai (Their vocabulary is different):** This is false, as the passage states their vocabularies are the same."
Inmein se kya Hangeul akshar ke baare mein sahi tathya nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ise Raja Sejong ke rajya mein banaya gaya tha** (It was created during the reign of King Sejong).

Here's why:

The text states that King Sejong *commissioned* the creation of Hangeul in 1444, and it was created *at his call*.  It doesn't say he finished creating it within his reign. While he oversaw the project and it was completed during his time, the full creation wasn't necessarily finished *during* his entire reign.  The creation process continued after his death.

The other options are all explicitly stated as true in the provided text:

*   **B: Akshar ka mool naam Hunan Jeongeum tha** (The original name of the characters was Hunmin Jeongeum) - Directly stated.
*   **C: Ise Joseon rajvansh ke chauthe raja ne banaya tha** (It was created by the fourth king of the Joseon dynasty) - Directly stated.
*   **D: Ise jaanboojh kar banaya gaya tha** (It was created consciously) - Directly stated.



Therefore, option A is the only statement that isn't entirely accurate according to the given information.



"
Hunmin Jeongeum akshar ko kis mein badal diya gaya?,"The correct answer is **B: Hangeul**.

The text states that Hunmin Jeongeum is the original name of the Hangeul alphabet.

"Passage ke hisab se, sanskrit ka asar kin bhashaon par hua hai?","The correct answer is **D: Bhartiye bhashayen**.

The passage states: ""Sanskrit ek bahut hi jatil aur samriddh bhasha hai, jisane kayee aadhunik bhartiya bhaashaon ke liye srot hone ka kam kiya hai..."" which translates to ""Sanskrit is a very complex and rich language, which has served as a source for many modern Indian languages...""

While Sanskrit *influenced* European languages (Latin, French, Spanish), the passage specifically mentions its impact on *Indian* languages. Therefore, option D is the most accurate.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, sanskrit ka upyog kis wajah se fika pad gaya?","The correct answer is **D: Padanukram**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Upanishadon ke sankalan ke baad, sanskrit kewal padanukram ke karan fika parh gayee."" This translates to ""After the compilation of the Upanishads, Sanskrit became faded simply because it was not being read."" (Padanukram means reading/recitation).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jatilta (Complexity):** The passage mentions Sanskrit is complex, but doesn't say complexity caused its decline.
* **B: Aryan Pravas (Aryan Migration):** While the Aryan Migration theory is mentioned as one theory about Sanskrit's origin, the passage doesn't link it to the decline of the language.
* **C: Latin bhashayen (Latin Languages):**  The passage mentions Sanskrit *influenced* European languages, but doesn't say Latin languages caused Sanskrit's decline.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, lo par gravity ke liye inmein se kaunsi baat sahi hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dharti ka gurutvaakarshan lo ke gurutvaakarshan ki tulna mein aapko kum kheenchega**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that your weight on the Moon would be significantly less than on Earth. This is because the Moon's gravitational pull is weaker than Earth's.  Therefore, Earth's gravity is pulling on you more strongly than the Moon's gravity, resulting in a higher weight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Lo ka gurutvaakarshan adhik khinchega, isliye aapka vazan kum hoga:** This is the opposite of what the passage says. The Moon's gravity is *weaker*, so you'd weigh less.
* **C: Lo ka gurutvaakarshan adhik khinchega, isliye aapka vazan adhik hoga:**  Again, this is the opposite. Weaker gravity means less pull and therefore less weight.
* **D: Dharti ka gurutvaakarshan lo ke gurutvaakarshan se adhik khinchega:** The passage says the Moon's gravity is *less* than Earth's.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Inmein se kaunsi baat Chand ki baahri parat ke liye sahi hai?","The correct answer is **B: Unche kshetron ke neeche crust patla hota hai.**

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""yah samudra ke niche patala aur oonche kshetron ke neeche motaa hota hai.""  (It is thin under the oceans and thick under high terrains).  This directly implies that the crust is thinner under high terrains.
* Option A is incorrect because the passage says the *closest* pole has a crust thickness of 70km, while the *farthest* pole has 100km, making the closest pole thicker.
* Option C is not directly mentioned in the passage.
* Option D is incorrect because the passage says the crust is *thicker* under high terrains.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, chaand ki parat sabse moti kis jagah par hai?","The correct answer is **C: Pahadi zameen ke neeche (Under hilly terrain)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yah samudra ke niche patala aur **oonche kshetron ke neeche** motaa hota hai.""  This translates to ""It is thicker under the oceans and **under hilly terrain**."" Therefore, the moon's crust is thickest under hilly terrain.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Paas ki taraf (Near side):** The passage mentions the crust is 70km thick on the near side, which is not necessarily the thickest.
* **B: Wahan, jahan maria zyada hai (Where there are more maria):**  The passage says maria are *on* the surface because lava flowed easily, not that the crust is thickest there.
* **D: Maria ke neeche (Under the maria):** This is incorrect because the passage explicitly states it's thicker under hilly terrain, not maria.



"
"Passage ke aadhaar par, inmein se kin baaton par kuchh log bharosa karte hain?","The correct answer is **C: Anya grahon par zindagi maujood hai (Life exists on other planets)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""kuch log sochate hain ki vahan kya ho sakta hai jabki kuch any maante hain ki dusren grahaan par elean yaa any jeev ho sakte hain"" (some people wonder what could be there, while others believe that aliens or other living beings might exist on other planets).  This directly supports option C.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Insaan se doosre stars par travel kiya hai (Humans have traveled to other stars):** The passage discusses dreaming of this possibility, but doesn't state that humans have actually done it. It's hypothetical.
* **B: Insaan doosri duniya ki khosh karne ke kabil nahi hai (Humans are not capable of making other planets habitable):**  The passage doesn't touch upon humanity's ability or inability to make other planets habitable.
* **D: Taaron ke beech kharbon meel se bhi kam doori hoti hai (The distance between stars is less than billions of miles):** While the passage mentions that stars are very far apart and that the distance between ""neighboring"" stars is only a few light-years, it doesn't say that the distance is *less than billions of miles*. It's a comparison to the vastness of space.



"
"Veh kya cheez hai jo sooraj ke center se jitna aage hoti jaati hai, utni hi patli hoti jaati hai?","The correct answer is **C: Gais**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Surya ke kendrase door jaate-jaate gais patali hoti jaati hai."" which translates to ""As you move away from the center of the Sun, the gas becomes thinner."""
"Passage ke hisab se, sooraj ka kaunsa hissa dharti se dikhta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Photosphere**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Suraj ko dekhte samay jo baahari bhaag dikhai deta hai, use photosphere (panorama) kahte hain."" This translates to ""When viewing the sun, the outer part that is visible is called the photosphere.""
"
Inmein se kis observation ki mada se Copernicus theory ki pushti hui?,"The correct answer is **A: Venus ke phases (Venus's phases)**.

Here's why:

* **Galileo's observation of Venus's phases:** Galileo's observation of Venus exhibiting phases similar to the Moon was a crucial piece of evidence.  These phases (crescent, gibbous, etc.) can only be explained if Venus orbits the Sun, not the Earth.  If Venus orbited the Earth, it would always appear as a crescent.

* **Copernicus's theory:**  Copernicus's heliocentric theory proposed that the planets, including Earth, orbit the Sun. Galileo's observation directly supported this theory.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Venus ka transit (Venus's transit):**  While Venus transits (passing between the Sun and Earth) are important for calculating planetary distances, they don't directly prove that Venus orbits the Sun.
* **C: Sooraj ki Venus se samanta (Sun's alignment with Venus):**  This isn't a concept directly related to proving Copernicus's theory.
* **D: Sooraj ki chaand se samanta (Sun's alignment with the Moon):** This is irrelevant to the debate about Earth vs. Sun at the center of the solar system.

Therefore, **Venus ke phases** are the observation that supported Copernicus's theory.
"
"1610 mein, Galileo Galilei ne yahan batayi gayi cheezon mein se kya dekha tha?","The correct answer is **B: Venus ke phases**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Galileo observed that Venus had phases *similar to the moon*.  Phases are a result of the changing angles at which we view the illuminated portion of a celestial body as it orbits the Sun.
* The passage later connects these phases to Copernicus's heliocentric model (planets orbiting the Sun), indicating that the phases were key to supporting that theory.
* Option A is incorrect because the passage mentions phases of Venus *similar to the moon*, not the moon itself.
* Option C is a conclusion *drawn* from observing Venus's phases, not what Galileo directly observed in 1610.
* Option D, ""Venus ka transit"" (transit of Venus), is a different astronomical event. The passage doesn't mention a transit.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Amazon River ko paani kahan se milta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Chhoti nadiyon se**.

The passage states: ""Amazon dharti ke sabse chaudi nadee bhi hai, jo kabhi-kabhi chhah meal jitni chaudi ho jaati hai. Hamare grah ke nadiyonse mahasagaron mein jaane vaale paani ka 20% hissa amazonse aata hai. Mukhya amazon nadee 6,387 kilo meter (3,980 meal) lambi hai. **isamen hajaaron chhoti nadiyan milti hain.**""  This clearly indicates that the Amazon River gets its water from thousands of smaller rivers.
"
Amazon River ki kis baat ke liye sarahna nahi ki jati hai?,"सही उत्तर **B: यह सबसे बड़ी नदी है** है।

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि अमेजन नदी पृथ्वी की दूसरी सबसे लंबी और सबसे बड़ी नदी है, न कि सबसे बड़ी।"
"Passage mein bataaye gaye kis kaam mein, Venezuela ke logo ko sabse kam naukriyan milti hain?","The correct answer is **B: Udyog (Industry)**.

The passage states that approximately one-fourth of those who work in Venezuela are employed in industry. The text also says that in the service sector, roughly two-thirds of workers are employed, and in agriculture, about one-fifth are employed. Therefore, industry has the lowest proportion of workers among the three sectors mentioned.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kis kaam mein Venezuela ke logo ko sabse zyada naukriyan di jati hain?","The correct answer is **A: Serva (Service)**.

The passage states: ""Venezuela ke kam karne waale do tihai log seva kshetra mein kam karte hain..."" which translates to ""Two-thirds of those who work in Venezuela work in the service sector..."" This indicates that the service sector employs the most people.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, fusion se taaron ko kya karne mein madad milti hai?","The correct answer is **B: Fusion reactors banane mein**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Vaigyaanik reactor banaane ke liye kam kar rahe hain jo use tarah se oorjaa banaa sakta hai.""  (Scientists are working to build reactors that can generate energy in the same way.)
* The passage also mentions that fusion powers stars with light and heat.  The goal is to replicate that process in a reactor.
* While fusion *does* create heavier elements (option A), the passage's primary focus in the context of reactor development is on *building* those reactors.
* Fusion doesn't *create* hydrogen atoms (option D), it combines them.
* While fusion *does* produce light and heat (option C), the passage links that output directly to the energy generation *in stars*, and the goal is to achieve similar energy generation in a reactor.  The core of the paragraph is about building the reactor, not the light and heat themselves.



Therefore, option B is the most accurate answer based on the passage."
"Koi faydemand fusion, inmein se kaunsa reactor banayega?","The correct answer is **A: Hydrogen**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that stars produce light and heat through the fusion of hydrogen atoms.
* The goal of fusion reactors is to replicate this process.
* Therefore, the reactor would be designed to work with hydrogen.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Stars** are the *source* of fusion, not the reactor itself.
* **C: Atoms** are the building blocks, but the reactor focuses on the *fusion* of hydrogen atoms.
* **D: Energy** is the *result* of fusion, not the component that *creates* the reactor.
"
Paani ki raasaynik sanrachna kya hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Do hydrogen atom aur ek oxygen atom**.

The passage states: ""yogic jal hydrogen ke do anuonse aur oxygen ke ek anuse milkar banaa hota hai..."" which translates to ""yogic jal is formed by two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom...""  ""Yogic jal"" is another name for water, and the chemical formula for water is H₂O (two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom).
"
"Jab paani apna roop badalta hai, to kaunsi cheez waisi hi rehti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Aanvik sanrachana (Molecular structure)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""iski ek hi aanvik sanrachana hai chaahe wah gais, taral yaa thos ho"" which translates to ""it has the same molecular structure whether it is gas, liquid or solid.""  The passage goes on to say that only the physical state changes, but the chemical state remains the same.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ghanatav (Density):** The passage mentions density changes (""taral avastha saghan hoti hai"" - liquid state is dense).
* **C: Bhautik isthiti (Physical state):** The passage states that the physical state *does* change (""iski bhautik isthiti badal sakti hai"" - its physical state can change).
* **D: Taral nitrogen (Liquid nitrogen):** While liquid nitrogen is used as an example of a substance that behaves similarly in different states, the question asks what *stays the same* when water changes form, not what it's *like*.



"
"Pasaage ke hisab se, kuchh qanoonon ko laagoo karne ki koshish karte samay, terah raajyon ke liye inmein se kaunsa mudda zaroori nahi tha?","The correct answer is **A: Rajya adhikaariyon ki taraf se bhari nigraani (Strict oversight by state authorities)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage emphasizes the weakness of the central government during the Revolutionary War.** It states the Congress had no power to levy taxes, enforce laws, or override state laws.  It also highlights that states often didn't cooperate and didn't take the central government seriously.

* **Option A, ""Strict oversight by state authorities,"" aligns with this weakness.**  The passage directly states that state authorities often didn't cooperate and didn't take the central government seriously. Therefore, strict oversight from state authorities would *hinder* the central government's ability to implement laws.

* **Options B, C, and D all reflect weaknesses of the central government as described in the passage.**
    * **B (Lack of power within Congress)** is explicitly stated.
    * **C (Need for unanimous consent for amendments)** is mentioned as a major obstacle.
    * **D (Non-existent national executive/judiciary)** is also directly stated.

Therefore, the only option that *doesn't* represent a challenge for the central government according to the passage is strict oversight by state authorities."
"Pasaage ke hisab se, krantikari yuddh ke dauran, inmein se kaunsi baat kendra sarkaar ki haalat par sahi baithti hai?","Correct answer is **C: Raajyon ke pratinidhi ke maujoodgi ki kami rahi**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""...their representatives often did not even show up in the assembly."" This directly addresses the lack of representation from the states in the central government, which was a major weakness.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Congress aur rajya adhikaariyon ne karon ko laagoo kiya tha:** The passage says Congress *didn't* have the power to impose taxes.
* **B: Congress ke adhikaar se tay hona tha ki sanshodhan karna hain ya nahi:** The passage doesn't mention Congress having the power to decide on amendments.
* **D: Kendriya sarkar mein do mukhya ghatak the:** The passage states Congress was the *only* significant component of the central government.



"
Swatantrata ke mool ghoshna ke pichhe kaise shabd likhe gaye hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Ulte (Upside down)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""paath dastaavez ke tall par dikhai deta hai, ulta."" which translates to ""the notation appears upside down at the bottom of the document.""
"
Singapore inmein se kiske liye mashhoor hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Shaharee hariyaalee (Urban greenery)**.

The passage states that Singapore, at the beginning of its independence, used the Singapore Botanic Gardens to help transform the island into a ""tropical garden city."" This directly points to Singapore's reputation for urban greenery.
"
Vanda Miss Joaquim kya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Ek phool (A flower)**.

The text states: ""1981 mein, advance kism ke arched hybrid wanda mis joakim ko desh ke rashtriya fool ke roop mein chuna gaya tha."" This directly translates to ""In 1981, the advanced breed of arched hybrid Vanda Miss Joaquim was chosen as the national flower of the country."" Therefore, Vanda Miss Joaquim is a flower.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Giza pyramids ki kis gunavatta se, Naye saamraajy ke misravaasiyon ke hairan hone ki ummeed nahi thi?","The correct answer is **C: Unka aakaar (Their size)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the New Kingdom Egyptians were amazed by the pyramids built by their predecessors, *which were more than a thousand years old.* This implies they were impressed by the age and the skill involved in building them.
* The passage specifically mentions that no subsequent pyramid construction ever surpassed the size and construction technique of the Giza pyramids. 
* While the use of stone, construction technique and age were all impressive, the passage explicitly highlights that no pyramid *ever surpassed the Giza pyramids in size.* Therefore, the New Kingdom Egyptians wouldn't have been surprised by the size of the Giza pyramids, as they were already the benchmark.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, shakahari jeev khaane ki talaash mein kahan aate hain?","The correct answer is **C: Dakshini maidaan**.

The passage states: ""lagbhag 1.5 million shakahari jeev-jantu barish ke liye uttari pahaadiyonse hote hue, maaraa nadee ko paar karke **dakshini maidanon ke or jaate hain**."" (Approximately 1.5 million vegetarian creatures come from the northern hills for the rains, crossing the Mara River and going towards the southern plains.)
"
"Passage ke hisab se, shaakaahaaree praanee April ke aaspaas kis kshetra ko chhod dete hain?","The correct answer is **B: Dakshini maidaan**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""har saal october mahine ke aas-paas, lagbhag 1.5 million shakahari jeev-jantu barish ke liye uttari pahaadiyonse hote hue, maaraa nadee ko paar karke dakshini maidanon ke or jaate hain.""  This translates to: ""Every year around October, approximately 1.5 million vegetarian creatures, coming from the northern hills for rain, cross the Mara River and go towards the southern plains.""

Therefore, they move towards the southern plains (Dakshini Maidaan).
"
Operation Sealion mein kis desh par hamla kiya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Britain**.

The passage states: ""France ke ladaai ke saath-saath germanyne britten ke dweep par aakraman karne ke liye taiyar hona shuru kar diya tha.""  This translates to ""Along with the fight in France, Germany began preparing to invade the island of Britain.""
"
Britain par kiye gaye hamle ko Germany ne kya naam diya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Operation Sealion**.

The text explicitly states: ""Germany ne is hamale ko """"operation sealian"""" naam diya."" (Germany named this attack ""Operation Sealion"".)
"
Africa ke desho par qabza karne ke Italy ki yojna mein inmein se kis cheez ko zaroori step ke taur par nahi bataya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Sena ki tukdiyon ke liye launching pad ki sthaapana**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states Italy's main goal was to conquer African countries.**
* **It explicitly mentions the need for a military unit to cross the Mediterranean and attack Africa.**
* **The passage details the need to break free from British holdings and ships in the Mediterranean.**
* **While building new ships (B) and securing a way to enter Africa (which a launching pad could facilitate) were considered, the passage *doesn't* mention establishing a launching pad for military units as a necessary step.**

The other options (Egypt breaking free, building ships, and destroying British holdings) are all directly linked to Italy's plan to conquer Africa, as outlined in the passage.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Italy ke yuddha ka mukhya uddeshya kya mana gaya tha?","The correct answer is **A: Africa ke deshon par qabza karna**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Italy ka mukhya lakshya african desh the. Un deshon par kabza karne ke liye..."" (Italy's main goal was African countries. To conquer those countries...)

While other options are mentioned as *means* to achieve that goal, the primary objective of Italy's military actions according to the passage was conquering African nations.
"
Hamla karne walo ke saath kisne dostana rishte banaye?,"The correct answer is **B: Vichy French**.

The passage states: ""ye francici log hi the jinhone 1940 mein Germans ke saath shanti asthaapit ki thi aur aakramankariyon se ladne ke bajaay unke saath kam kiya tha."" This translates to ""These French people were the ones who established peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with them instead of fighting the invaders."" These French people are referred to as Vichy French.
"
Operation Dragoon mein shaamil sahayogi kaun the?,"The correct answer is **A: Americans aur Free French**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Kewal do hafton mein amerikiyon aur free French balon ne dakshini Fraance ko mukt kar diya tha..."" (In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French liberated southern France...).
"
Kis technology ke vikaas ki wajah se panadubbiyan paani ke niche yaatra karane lagi?,"The correct answer is **D: Radar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Lekin jaise-jaise radar viksit hone lagey aur zyada steak hote gaye, pandubbiyon ko dikhanese bachane ke liye paani ke niche jaane ke liye mazboor hona padaa.""  This translates to: ""But as radar developed and became more sophisticated, submarines were forced to go underwater to avoid being seen.""

Therefore, the development of radar was the reason why submarines started traveling underwater.  ""You-boat"" is simply the German term for submarine. The other options (targeting range and navigation) are not directly linked to the *reason* submarines started going underwater."
"Pehli baar istemaal karne ke dauran, panadubbiyaon ki kabiliyat kin cheezon mein sabse kam thi?","The correct answer is **C: Nishaanaabaazee mein (Shooting range)**.

The passage states: ""Pehle aur dusre vishvayuddh mein pandubbiyon ka istemal kiya gaya tha. Lekin tab unaki raftar kafee dhimi aur shooting range bhi bahut kafee seemit hua karti tha."" (Submarines were used in the First and Second World Wars. But at that time, their speed was quite slow and their shooting range was also very limited.) This clearly indicates that the submarines' shooting capability was limited.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kisne agreement ka ullanghan kiya? ","The correct answer is **D: Soviet ne**.

The passage states: ""Unhone yah riga shanti sandhi, the soviyat-polish non-aggression pact aur anya antar rashtriya dwipakshiya aur bahupakshiya dono tarah ke sandhiyon ka ulanghan karte hue kiya tha."" This translates to: ""They violated the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.""  ""They"" refers to the Soviet Union's Red Army.
"
Inmein se kaunsa kaam Red Army ne nahi kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Bridgehead ke saath reorganization**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the plans for retreating and joining the Romanian bridgehead were made ""almost overnight"" *after* the Red Army invaded Poland's eastern territories.  The passage emphasizes the speed and lack of planning for these measures due to the sudden Soviet attack.  It doesn't say they were reorganized *with* the bridgehead.

Let's look at why the other options *were* actions of the Red Army:

* **A: Ukraine ka morcha banana (Creating the Ukrainian front):** The passage explicitly states the Red Army established the Belarus and Ukrainian fronts.
* **B: Poorvi kshetron par hamla (Attack on eastern territories):** The passage directly mentions the Red Army's invasion of Poland's eastern territories.
* **D: Sandhi ka ullanghan (Violation of treaties):** The passage highlights the Soviet Union's violation of the Riga Peace Treaty and the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact.



"
Italian Tenth Army ke Engineer-in-Chief ko kya hua tha?,"सही जवाब है: **C: Unhein British ne pakad liya tha**

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि जनरल लास्टुसी को 10 जून, 1940 को इटली द्वारा युद्ध की घोषणा करने के समय लीबिया में कैपुजो किले में ब्रिटिशों ने पकड़ लिया था। विकल्प A में किले का गलत नाम है, और विकल्प B और D पाठ में उल्लिखित घटनाओं से मेल नहीं खाते।"
Italo Balbo ko kahan mara gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Tobruk**.

The passage states: ""28 june ko, libia ke governor general aur marshal musolini ke spasht uttaradhikari marshal italo balbo, tobrook mein land karte samay friendly fire mein maare gaye.""  This translates to ""On June 28th, the governor general of Libya and Marshal Mussolini's clear deputy, Marshal Italo Balbo, was killed by friendly fire while landing at Tobruk.""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kaunsi takneek, Tibetan meditation ke zaroori hissa hain?","The correct answer is **A: Saans lene ke vyaayaam ka abhyaas karna (Practicing breath exercises)** and **B: Mantra dohrana (Reciting Mantras)** and **C: Devtaon ki kalpana karna (Visualizing deities)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions these techniques as being part of Tibetan Buddhism:

*   **Shwas abhyas (breath exercises)** are mentioned under the context of Kundalini Yoga.
*   **Mantras** are also listed as part of Kundalini Yoga techniques.
*   **Chitranse (visualizations of deities)** are mentioned as a technique used in Daiv Yoga.

Therefore, options A, B, and C are all correct based on the provided text. While D (achieving mastery in yog mudras) is also mentioned, the passage doesn't explicitly state it as a *necessary* part of Tibetan meditation in the same way it lists breathing, mantra, and deity visualization.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Tibetan meditation ke “center” ke dauran chakras kaise sakriya hote hain?","Passage ke hisab se, Tibetan meditation ke ""center"" ke dauran chakras sakriya hote hain **B: Devtaon ki kalpna karke**.

Passage mein likha hai: ""Alag-alag devtaon ke chitranse oorjaa channels ko saaf kiya jaataa hai, chakron ko sakriya kiya jaataa hai aur aatmagyaan chetna ka nirmaan kiya jaataa hai.""  Isse pata chalta hai ki devtaon ki kalpna (visualization) chakras ko sakriya karne ka ek tareeka hai.
"
Program ke dauran doosra bhakti geet kisne sunaya?,"The correct answer is **D: Jai Shankar Choudhary**.

The passage states: ""Gaayak sanju sharmane sham ke shuruat ke,uske baad jaya shankar chaudharine chhappan bhog bhajan bhi gaya..."" This translates to ""Singer Sanju Sharma started in the evening, after which Jai Shankar Choudhary also sang a chhappan bhog bhajan...""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, khana kilate samay kisne bhakti sunaya?","The correct answer is **A: Lakkha Singh**.

The passage states: ""Lakkha singhne bhajan gayaki ke kamaan sambhali. gaayak, raju khandelwal unke saath the. Lakkha singhne chhappan bhog bhajan bhi prastut kiya."" This means Lakkha Singh presented the Chhappan Bhog Bhajan while Raju Khandelwal accompanied him. Therefore, Lakkha Singh is the one who sang bhajans while the food was being served.
"
Us raat ki second-last performance kaunsi thi?,"The correct answer is **A: Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina aur Haris Alexiou**.

The passage states: ""Turkey ki gayika Sejen Aksu ne italian Alessandro Safina aur Greek gaayak Harris Alexey ke saath karyakram kiya. Ant mein, turkey ke nritya samooh fire off anatolia ne """"troy"""" show pesh kiya."" This indicates that Sezen Aksu, Alessandro Safina, and Haris Alexiou performed together second to last.
"
Alessandro Safina kis desh se hain?,"The correct answer is **D: Italian**.

The text explicitly states that Alessandro Safina is Italian (""italian Alessandro Safina"").
"
Passage ke aadhaar par inmein se kaunsi baat sach nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Santa Clara mein aag lag gayi thi (Fire broke out in Santa Clara)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage mentions extreme heat (90°F) as the reason for giving water to the passengers.**  It focuses on the heat, not a fire.
* **The passage explicitly states ""Log ek roller coaster par phanse hue the"" (People were trapped on a roller coaster).** This makes option B true.
* **The passage says ""Passengers ko paani diya gaya tha"" (Passengers were given water).** This makes option C true.
* **The passage mentions it took at least an hour to get the first person off the ride.** The passage says ""pehle vyakti ko sawari parse utaarane mein kamse kam ek ghanta lagaa tha"" (it took at least an hour to get the first person off the ride).  Option D is close but says ""60 minutes"" while the passage states ""ek ghanta"" (an hour). It's close enough to be considered a plausible interpretation of the passage and therefore *not* explicitly false.

Therefore, the only statement that is *not* supported by the passage is that a fire broke out.



"
"Passage ke hisab se,asuvidhaajanak taap star ke sambandh mein kisne tippani ki?","The correct answer is **B: Agni kaptaan ne (Fire captain)**.

The passage states, ""Fire captain Scott Conusne kahaa, """"90 ke dashak mein tapman ke saath santa clara mein yah ek germ din tha."""" "" This translates to ""Fire captain Scott Conusne said, """"This was a brutal day in Santa Clara with the temperature in the 90s."""""".  Therefore, the fire captain commented on the uncomfortable temperature.

Tsunami ki gatividhi ki wajah se kahan ki bijli gul ho gayi thi?,"The correct answer is **A: Tonga**.

The text states: ""Tonga mein koi badee kshati yaa chot ke suchna nahin mili hai, lekin bijli asthaayi roop se chully gayi thi..."" which translates to ""No information of major damage or injury was received in Tonga, but electricity was temporarily cut off...""

The electricity being cut off in Tonga is directly linked to the tsunami activity.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, bijli gul hone ki wajah se Tonga par kya asar pada?","The correct answer is **D: Adhikaariyon ko zaroori chetavniayn nahi mili thi** (Officials did not receive the necessary warnings).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tonga mein koi badee kshati yaa chot ke suchna nahin mili hai, lekin bijli asthaayi roop se chully gayi thi, jiske karan kathit taur par tongan adhikariyon ko ptwc dwara jaari sunami chetavani milna rook gayi thi.""

This translates to: ""There were no reports of major damage or injuries in Tonga, but the electricity was temporarily out, which meant that Tongan officials could not reliably receive the tsunami warning issued by PTWC.""

Therefore, the power outage prevented officials from receiving the crucial tsunami warnings.
"
Jonny Reid ki driving speed ko maapne ke liye police ne apni radar gun ka istemaal kab kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Jab veh 160km/h se zyada ki speed par gaadi chala raha tha.**

The passage states: ""Police unaki raftar sirya tabhi map sucky, jab way rtaar kam karke 160 kilometres/ghanta par aa gaye the.""  This translates to: ""Police were able to measure his speed only when his speed decreased and came down to 160 kilometers/hour.""  This means the police used the radar gun when he was *exceeding* 160 km/h, and then slowing down to reach that speed.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, New Zealand police ke liye Jonny Reid ki speed par nazar rakhna mushkil kyun tha?","The correct answer is **B: Car bahut neechi thi** (The car was very small).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Blek beauty ke chhote aakar ke vajah se newland ke police ko speed radar gana ka istemal karke shree reed ke rtaar pata lagaane mein kathinaaee ho rahi thi.""  This translates to: ""Because of the small size of the Black Beauty, the New Zealand police were having difficulty tracking Mr. Reid's speed using speed radar.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Veh 160km/h ki speed se gaadi chala raha tha** (He was driving at 160km/h): While this is true, it doesn't explain *why* the police had difficulty.
* **C: Usne sirf saat bar pull paar kiya** (He only crossed the bridge seven times): The number of times he crossed the bridge is irrelevant to the difficulty in tracking his speed.
* **D: Auckland Harbour Bridge bahut purana hai** (Auckland Harbour Bridge is very old): The age of the bridge is unrelated to the police's difficulty in monitoring his speed.



"
Butte sa juda bhookamp kahaan kendrit tha?,"The correct answer is **B: 40 meel dakshin mein**.

The passage states: ""Bhookamp dilon ke uttar-uttar poorv mein lagbhag 20 kilo meter (15 meal) aur beaut ke dakshin mein lagbhag 65 kilo meter (40 meal) ki doori par kendrit tha.""

This means the epicenter was 65 miles south of Butte.
"
Abu Ghraib mein dange ke dauran kya hua?,"The correct answer is **C: US ki sena ne niyantran le liya (The US army took control)**.

The provided text states that after the abuses at Abu Ghraib prison became known, the US army was put in charge of managing it. This directly supports option C."
Iraq ki jail kis wajah se badnaam hui? ,"The correct answer is **D: Qaidiyon ke saath badtameezi ki jaankaari mili** (Information about bad behavior towards prisoners was received).

Here's why:

* The question states: ""Kaidi durvyavahar ke pata chalane ka baad jail kukhyaat ho gayee"" which translates to ""The jail became infamous after information about prisoner abuse came to light.""
* Option D directly reflects this statement.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ismein aag lagaa di gai thi** (It was set on fire): The text doesn't mention a fire.
* **B: US ki sena ne niyantran le liya tha** (The US army took control): The text says the US army *took over* the jail *after* it became infamous, not that the infamy was *caused* by the US army taking control.
* **C: Wahan kai dange hue** (There were many riots): While riots may have contributed to the jail's reputation, the text explicitly states that prisoner abuse was the reason for its infamy.



"
Maui ke War Memorial Stadium mein kis tarah ka aayojan hone wala tha?,"सही जवाब है **C: Sangeet samaaroh (संगीत समारोह)**।

पाठ में कहा गया है कि बैंड का शो रद्द कर दिया गया था, और आम तौर पर बैंड के शो संगीत समारोह होते हैं। अन्य विकल्प संदर्भ में उपयुक्त नहीं हैं।
"
"Aakhir mein, aayojan ke cancel hone ke sambandh mein kisne safayi di?","The correct answer is **A: Band ne**.

The passage states: ""Band ne Mau ke war memorial stadium mein hone waale show ko radd kar diya..."" which translates to ""The band cancelled the show at Mau's War Memorial Stadium...""

While the management company later cited preparation reasons, the *band* was the one who announced the cancellation and apologized. Therefore, they are ultimately responsible for the cancellation.
"
Bishkek ke kuchh nivaasiyon ne lootpaat ke liye kise zimmedaar thehraya?,"The correct answer is **C: Pradarshanakaariyon ko (Protesters)**.

The text states: ""kayee bishkek nivaasiyonne dakshin ke pradarshankariyon ko is arajakata ke liye doshi thaharaaya.""  This translates to ""Many Bishkek residents blamed the southern protesters for this unrest."" Therefore, the residents held the protesters responsible for the looting.
"
Lootpaat ke liye dakshin ke pradarshanakaariyon ko kisne zimmedaar mana?,"The correct answer is **A: Bishkek ke nivaasiyon ne (Bishkek residents)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""kayee bishkek nivaasiyonne dakshin ke pradarshankariyon ko is arajakata ke liye doshi thaharaaya."" This translates to ""many Bishkek residents blamed the Southern demonstrators for this unrest.""

Therefore, Bishkek residents blamed the Southern demonstrators for the looting.
"
Ring anubhav se bikree kab badhi?,"The correct answer is **A: Shark Tank par upasthiti ke baad**.

The passage states: ""Siminoff kahaa ki 2013 mein shark tank episode mein unke dikhane ke baad bikri mein badhotari hui..."" This directly indicates that sales increased *after* appearing on Shark Tank.
"
Jamie Siminoff ne Ring shuru karne ka faisla kab liya?,"The correct answer is **A: Yeh mehsoos karne ke baad ki unki khud ki doorbell aparyaapt thi**.

The text states: ""Isase pehle, Ring ke CEO, Jamie Siminoff ne bataaya tha ki company tab shuru hui jab uske darwaane ke ghanti uske garaj mein sthit dukaan se sunai nahin detee thi."" (Before this, Ring's CEO, Jamie Siminoff, had said that the company started when the doorbell at his garage-based store couldn't be heard from inside.)

This indicates that the initial motivation for starting Ring was his own experience with an inadequate doorbell.
"
Reading Rainbow ke har episode mein bachchon ko kis cheez ka sujhaav diya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Sthaaniya pustakalay ka (Local library)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bachchon ko apni library mein jaakar yekitaaben padhani chaahiye."" which translates to ""Children should go to their library and read books.""
"
Reading Rainbow series ke cancel hone ki kya wajah rahi hogi?,"सही उत्तर है **A: अपर्याप्त फंडिंग (Insufficient Funding)**।

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""funding ke kami aur shaikshik television programming ke darshan mein badlav donone is shrinkhala ko samaapt karne mein yogdan diya hai"" (फंडिंग की कमी और शैक्षिक टेलीविजन प्रोग्रामिंग में बदलाव दोनों ने इस श्रृंखला को समाप्त करने में योगदान दिया)।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं:

* **B: Emmy awards ki kami (एमी पुरस्कारों की कमी):** पाठ में एमी पुरस्कारों का उल्लेख नहीं है।
* **C: John Grant ki raay (जॉन ग्रांट की राय):** पाठ में जॉन ग्रांट के उद्धरण का उल्लेख है, लेकिन यह श्रृंखला के रद्द होने का कारण नहीं बताया गया है।
* **D: Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood ki safalta (मिस्टर रॉजरस' नेबरहुड की सफलता):** पाठ में मिस्टर रॉजरस के नेबरहुड का उल्लेख है लेकिन यह श्रृंखला के रद्द होने का कारण नहीं बताया गया है।
"
Ped ke sambandh mein Amsterdam aur museum ke adhikaariyon ne inmein se kaun si baat nahi kahi thi?,"The correct answer is **A: Pakka hai ki yeh gir hi jayega (It is certain that it will fall)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text states that the tree was deemed a public health hazard due to being infected with a fungus and posed a fall risk.
* The authorities decided to cut it down on Tuesday, but an emergency court ruling saved it.
* The text explicitly says it's a public health hazard.
* It's implied the tree was in danger of falling, but the court ruling prevented the *certainty* of its fall.
* The text mentions the tree has a cavity, indicating a weakened state.
* Therefore, the statement ""Pakka hai ki yeh gir hi jayega"" contradicts the fact that the court intervention prevented a definite fall.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Ise sanrakshit karna chahiye (It should be preserved)** - This aligns with the court ruling to save the tree, indicating a need for preservation.
* **C: Ismein pahphoond lagi hui hai (It has a cavity)** - The text directly states ""unka turk hai kiuske girne ka pura khatra tha"" which implies the presence of a cavity.
* **D: Yeh sarvajanik svasthy ke liye khatarnaak hai (It is dangerous for public health)** -  This is explicitly mentioned in the text.



"
"RSPCA ke mukhy nirikshak ke hisab se, inmein se kiske liye, nireekshan ka manak bana dena chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Janwaron ke saath kaam kar raha koi bhi vyakti (People who care for animals)**.

Here's why:

The quote from David O'Shonnesy states that CCTV cameras would provide a ""strong signal to people who care for animals that their welfare is the highest priority.""  Therefore, the inspection standard should be for those who *handle* the animals. While CCTV would be installed *in* abattoirs (D), the core message is about the responsibility of the people involved in animal care. Option A (CCTV cameras) is a tool, not the standard. Option C (Surveillance installations) is too broad.

Therefore, B is the most accurate answer.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Australia ke qasaikhaano ke shramiko ke liye, pashu kalyaan ki zaroorat ko mazbooti dene mein kya cheez madad kar sakti hai?","The correct answer is **A: CCTV cameras ka installation**.

Here's why:

* The passage states explicitly: """"CCTV nishchit roop se, jaanvaron ka paalan-poshan karne waale logon ko ek mazboot sanket dega ki unka kalyan sarvocch prathamikta hai"""" which translates to ""CCTV will certainly give people who care for animals a strong signal that their welfare is their top priority.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: RSPCA ke saath zaroori meetings:** While RSPCA is advocating for CCTV, the passage doesn't say meetings are the primary way to improve animal welfare.
* **C: Qasaikhaano ke niyamit nirikshan:**  The passage mentions regular inspections as desirable, but it highlights CCTV as a specific tool for conveying a commitment to animal welfare.
* **D: ABC se nirikshan:** ABC (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) is a news outlet.  The passage refers to a statement made to ABC, but doesn't suggest ABC inspections directly improve animal welfare within slaughterhouses.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, jis vyakti ko giraftar kiya gaya hai vah kya kaam karta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Chaatr (Student)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...ek any chhaatr ko 21 march ke school mein golibari ke silsile mein giraftar kiya gaya hai."" (another student was arrested in connection with the school shooting on March 21st).
"
"Passage ke hisab se, jab ek aur giraftari ki khabar fail rahi thi, tab kitne logo ka antim sanskar kiya ja raha tha?","The correct answer is **B: Teen**.

The passage states: ""Jeff Weas aur nau peediton mein se teen ka antim sanskar karte samay..."" which translates to ""While conducting the last rites of Jeff Weas and three other victims..."".
"
"Dharane ke virodh mein, kaunsa desh ACTA samjhaute par hastakshar karne ke lie aage nahi aaya?","The correct answer is **B: Poland**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pichle mahine Poland mein badey virodh pradarshan hue the jabus deshne acta par hastakshar kiye the, jiske karan polland ke sarkarne is samjhte abhi manjur nahin karne ka faisala kiya hai."" (Last month, large protests took place in Poland against the US-China ACTA, because of which the Polish government decided not to approve the agreement yet.)

Therefore, Poland is the country that did not move forward with signing the ACTA agreement.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaunse desh ne ACTA samjhaute ko manjur nahin karne ka faisala kiya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Latvia**.

The passage states: ""Poland ke sarkarne is samjhate abhi manjur nahin karne ka faisala kiya hai."" It also mentions that Latvia and Slovakia are ""donone acta mein shamil hone ke prakriya mein deree ke,"" meaning they haven't fully agreed to it.  However, the question asks which country *decided not to approve* the agreement. Only Poland has explicitly made that decision.  However, since Latvia is listed among those that haven't fully agreed, and it is an option, it's the best choice.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Estonia:** The passage mentions Estonia as a location where protests occurred, but doesn't say anything about their stance on ACTA.
* **B: Lithuania:** Same as Estonia, mentioned as a protest location, but no stance on ACTA.
* **C: Scotland:** Same as Estonia and Lithuania, mentioned as a protest location.



While Poland explicitly decided not to approve, Latvia is the closest answer among the options provided, as they haven't fully agreed to ACTA either.
"
iPod overheatig ki ghatna ki vajah se kull kitne logo chhote aayin?,"The correct answer is **A: 4**.

The text states: ""jisase cull chhah baar aug luggy aur chaar log mamuli roop se jall gaye."" which translates to ""causing six instances of burns and four people got mildly burned.""
"
Yah kisne kaha ki overheating ki ghatnayein zyaada gambhir nahin hain?,"The correct answer is **D: Apple**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Mantralayane apple ke report ke asthagan ko yah kahte hue pratikriya dee hai ki wah """"yakinan pachtaave ke yogya hai."""" This translates to: ""The ministry responded to Apple's report by saying that it is 'certainly worthy of regret.'""  This implies the ministry (METI) believes Apple *doesn't* think the overheating incidents are serious enough. Apple's report being ""worthy of regret"" suggests they aren't taking the issue seriously enough. Therefore, Apple is the one who hasn't taken the incidents seriously.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: METI:**  METI *criticized* Apple's report, not said the incidents weren't serious.
* **B: iPod ke maalik (iPod owners):** The text doesn't mention iPod owners commenting on the severity of the incidents.
* **C: Japan ke fire department:** The text doesn't mention the fire department's opinion.



"
"Apne bhashan ke dauran, Steve Jobs ne Apple ke kis product ka phir se aavishkar karne ki baat ki?","The correct answer is **B: Phone**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Aaj aipal apne phone ka phir aavishkar karne jaa raha hai..."" which translates to ""Today Apple is going to reinvent its phone...""
"
Steve Jobs ke do ghante ke bhashan ka maksad kya tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Naya phone launch karna**.

The text explicitly states: ""Aaj aipal apne phone ka phir aavishkar karne jaa raha hai..."" (Today Apple is going to reinvent the phone...). This directly indicates that the purpose of Steve Jobs' speech was to announce a new phone.
"
Argentine theatre mein Christina Fernandes die Kirchnerne ne kya ghoshana ke?,"The correct answer is **A: Apne rashtrapati pada ke ummidwari ke ghoshana ke**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Vartamaan senator aur argentine ke pratham mahila christina fernandes die kirchnerne call sham buenous iresse 50 kilometres (31 meal) door shahar lae plata mein apne rashtrapati pada ke ummidwari ke ghoshana ke.""  This translates to: ""Current senator and Argentina's first woman, Christina Fernandez de Kirchner, announced her candidacy for the presidency in La Plata, a city 50 kilometers (31 miles) from Buenos Aires, last night.""

Therefore, option A is the correct answer.
"
Christina fernandes die kirchnerne ne kis jagah par apne chunaw ladne ke ghoshana ke?,"The correct answer is **C: Buenos ires se 31 meel dur Argentine Theatre mein**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Vartamaan senator aur argentine ke pratham mahila christina fernandes die kirchnerne call sham buenous iresse 50 kilometres (31 meal) door shahar lae plata mein apne rashtrapati pada ke ummidwari ke ghoshana ke."" This translates to: ""Current senator and Argentina's first woman Christina Fernandez de Kirchner called Buenos Aires 50 kilometers (31 miles) away in the city of La Plata to announce her candidacy for the presidency.""  It then continues to say that she announced her candidacy in an Argentine theatre. Therefore, the most accurate answer is that she made her announcement in an Argentine theatre, 31 miles from Buenos Aires in La Plata."
Big brother ke bare mein ACMA ko kya pata chala?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Unhone Censorship kanoonon ka ulanghan nahi kiya tha**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

प्रश्न के अनुसार, ACMA ने पाया कि बिग ब्रदर ने ऑनलाइन कंटेंट सेंसरशिप कानूनों का उल्लंघन नहीं किया क्योंकि कंटेंट उनकी वेबसाइट पर स्टोर नहीं किया गया था।  इसलिए, ACMA ने यह निष्कर्ष निकाला कि उन्होंने कानूनों का उल्लंघन नहीं किया।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **B: Media ko big brother ki website par store kiya gaya tha** - यह प्रश्न के कथन के विपरीत है।
*   **C: Censorship kanoonon ka ulanghan kiya gaya tha** - यह प्रश्न के कथन के विपरीत है।
*   **D: Content bhautik roop se server par mila tha** - प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि कंटेंट भौतिक रूप से सर्वर पर नहीं था।"
Internet content maane jaane ke liye media ko konse parameters ke under aana chahiye?,"सही जवाब है **B: Ise bhautik roop se server par hona chahiye**

यहाँ इसका कारण बताया गया है:

प्रश्न ACMA (भारतीय दूरसंचार नियामक प्राधिकरण) के एक फैसले के बारे में है, जिसमें कहा गया है कि बिग ब्रदर ने ऑनलाइन सामग्री सेंसरशिप कानूनों का उल्लंघन नहीं किया क्योंकि सामग्री उनकी वेबसाइट पर स्टोर नहीं की गई थी।  

प्रश्न के अनुसार, प्रसारण सेवा अधिनियम इंटरनेट सामग्री के लिए नियंत्रण प्रदान करता है, लेकिन यह सामग्री को भौतिक रूप से सर्वर पर मौजूद होने की आवश्यकता बताता है।  

इसलिए, इंटरनेट सामग्री को ""इंटरनेट सामग्री"" माने जाने के लिए, उसे भौतिक रूप से सर्वर पर मौजूद होना चाहिए। अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: Ise internet par stream kiya jaana chahiye:**  यह गलत है क्योंकि वीडियो को इंटरनेट पर स्ट्रीम किया जा सकता है, लेकिन फिर भी यह ""इंटरनेट सामग्री"" नहीं मानी जा सकती यदि वह भौतिक रूप से सर्वर पर मौजूद नहीं है।
*   **C: Ise kisi website pe store nahi kiya ja sakta:** यह गलत है क्योंकि सामग्री को वेबसाइट पर स्टोर किया जा सकता है, लेकिन यह महत्वपूर्ण नहीं है कि सामग्री सर्वर पर भौतिक रूप से मौजूद हो।
*   **D: Ise ACMA ki taraf se approv hona chahiye:** यह गलत है क्योंकि ACMA की स्वीकृति जरूरी नहीं है कि सामग्री को ""इंटरनेट सामग्री"" माना जाए।"
Australia ki Liberal Party ka leader koun hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Peter Costello**.

The text explicitly states: ""Australia ke treasurer aur liberal party ke neta ke roop mein pradhaanmantri john hoard ke jagah lene waale peater castellone..."" which translates to ""Peter Costello, who took over as treasurer and leader of the Liberal Party from Prime Minister John Howard...""
"
Australia mai phele se koi nuclear power industry kyon nhi hai?,"The best answer is **B: Bahut controversial hai (Very controversial)**.

Here's why:

* The provided text highlights that Peter Costello, the new Treasurer and Liberal Party leader, states there's ""no fundamental objection"" to nuclear energy. This implies that the *reason* nuclear power hasn't been adopted is not necessarily a lack of fundamental opposition, but rather a complex and potentially contentious issue.
* While cost (D) could be a factor, the statement focuses on Costello's *support* for it *if* it becomes economically viable.
* Public support (A) might be a factor, but the text doesn't explicitly state this. It focuses on Costello's position.
* While nuclear power *can* be dangerous (C), the text doesn't directly say this is the reason for its lack of development. The statement from Costello suggests that the opposition is more nuanced than simply a fear of danger.

Therefore, the most encompassing and likely reason, given the context, is that nuclear power is a highly debated and controversial topic in Australia.



"
Kis skier ne guide ki madad se pratiyogita me hissa liya?,"The correct answer is **C: Maciej Krezel**.

The text states: ""Poland nivasi netrahin purush, **Mekies crazell** aur unaki **guide Ainaa Augerzinska**ne super-jee mukabale mein terahvaan asthan hassil kiya.""  This clearly indicates that Maciej Krezel (Mekies crazell) competed with his guide Ainaa Augerzinska.
"
Mahilaaon ki standing class ke liye super-jee mai konsa desh dasaven asthan par raha?,"The correct answer is **A: Finland**.

The text states: ""Finland use pratiyogita mein katja sarinan ke saath dasaven asthan par rahaa"" which translates to ""Finland, with Katja Sarinen, came in tenth place in the competition.""
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, blek ke baare mein kaunsa statement sahi nahi tha?","The correct answer is **B: Usne hamale ki baat ko sweekar karlia tha (He admitted to the attack)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Prenenter, jise mauka-ae-vaardaatse girtaar kiya gaya tha,ne hamalese **incar kiya** aur daavaa kiya kiusne poll ka istemal khud ko lagbhag tees logon dwara fenke jaane waali bottlesse bachaane ke liye kiya.""  This translates to: ""The presenter, who was arrested at the scene of the incident, **denied** the attack and claimed he used the pole to protect himself from approximately thirty bottles thrown by people.""

Therefore, Black denied the attack, not admitted to it.  Options A, C, and D are all supported by the passage.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Blek ke sath inmein se kya nahi hua tha?","The correct answer is **C: Us par pole se hamla kiya gaya tha**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that Blek was found guilty of *attempting to obstruct justice*. It does *not* state that he was the target of an attack with a pole.
* The passage confirms that Blek was arrested.
* The passage confirms that Blek was found guilty of attempting to obstruct justice.
* The passage confirms that the judge told Blek that a jail sentence was ""virtually certain.""



"
Sanyukt Rashtra Sangh ke vaishvik taapvriddhi fund ka istemaal kis kaam ke liye nahi kiya jayega?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Vikashil deshon mein praudyogikee lane ke lie**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि संयुक्त राष्ट्र संघ का वैश्विक तापमान वृद्धि निधि विकासशील देशों को कम प्रदूषक तरीकों से आगे बढ़ने में मदद करने के लिए है।  यह निधि बाड़-रोधी घरों, बेहतर जल प्रबंधन और फसल विविधता के लिए उपयोग की जा सकती है।  इसलिए, यह विकासशील देशों में औद्योगिकी लाने के लिए नहीं है।

अन्य विकल्प निधि के उपयोग के वर्णित उद्देश्यों में से हैं।"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Sanyukt Rashtra Sangh kya bachaane ki ummid kar raha hai?","The correct answer is **C: Bache hue jungles ko bachaane ki**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Baali mein is agende ke any vishayon mein duniya ke bache hue jungles ko bachaane..."" which translates to ""In Bali, other items on this agenda include saving the world's remaining jungles...""
"
Nimnlikhit me kisko Albert Muchangane aisi chiz ke roop me maana jiske lie sehamti ki aavashykta hai?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Tariff riyaayatein**।

यहां कारण बताया गया है:

प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि ""हम अभी तक मूल और टैरिफ रियायतों के नियमों पर सहमत नहीं हुए हैं""। Albert Muchangane का उल्लेख इस संबंध में एक महत्वपूर्ण व्यक्ति के रूप में किया गया है, इसलिए यह स्पष्ट है कि टैरिफ रियायतों पर सहमति एक ऐसी चीज है जिसके लिए सहमति की आवश्यकता है।

अन्य विकल्प इतने सीधे तौर पर नहीं हैं:

* **A: अगर बेनिन AFCTA में शामिल होगा:** यह एक व्यापक मुद्दा है, और Muchangane विशेष रूप से टैरिफ रियायतों की सहमति पर ध्यान केंद्रित कर रहे हैं।
* **B: तारीख जब व्यापार शुरू हो सकता है:** Muchangane ने कहा कि उनके पास व्यापार शुरू करने के लिए ढांचा है, लेकिन उन्होंने टैरिफ रियायतों पर सहमति की कमी को एक बाधा के रूप में उजागर किया है।
* **C: मूल नियम:** Muchangane ने मूल नियमों और टैरिफ रियायतों दोनों का उल्लेख किया, लेकिन टैरिफ रियायतों को सहमति की कमी के कारण अधिक महत्वपूर्ण बाधा के रूप में दर्शाया गया है।"
"Passage ke hisaab se, July se trading kyun shuru ho sakti hai?","The correct answer is **B: Niyamon aur riyayaton ka paryaapt dhancha maujood hai.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""hamare paas 1 july, 2020 ko vyaapaar shuru karne ke liye paryaapt dhancha hai"" which translates to ""we have enough framework to start trade on July 1, 2020."" This indicates that the existence of a sufficient framework (rules and tariff concessions) is the reason trade could start.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AfCFTA mein shamil hone ke liye july ki start date nigeria ki terms ka part thi:** While Nigeria planned to join AfCFTA, the passage doesn't explicitly state that July 1st was a term set by Nigeria.
* **C: AU vyaapaar and udyog aayukt manjuri de di:** The passage mentions that the Commissioner of Trade and Industry announced Benin's inclusion, but it doesn't say he approved trade for July 1st. Agreement on terms is needed, not just approval.
* **D: Mool niyamon aur tarriff riyaayaton par sahmati ho gae hain:** The passage explicitly states that agreement on the fundamental rules and tariff concessions hasn't been reached yet (""ham abhi tak mool aur tarriff riyaayaton ke niyamon par sahmat nahin hue hain"").



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, atlanta journal-constitutionne ne shiksha adhikariyon par kya aarop lagaaya?","The correct answer is **A: Journal-Constitution ki report ke sath ched chhad karne ka**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ke baad, test results mein hui pareshaniyon ko bataate hue dha atlanta journal-constitutionne ek report prakashit ke. Report mein bataaya gaya gaya ki test ke ank teyn gatise bay,us schoolne aantarik taur par kuch samasyaon ko pahachaana par unhein thik karne ke liye kuch nahin kiya. Uske baad ke saboot is or ishara karte hai ki hallne pariksha ke prashnapatronse chhedchhaad ke thi, aur 2013 meinuske saath hi 34 anya shiksha adhikariyon par iska aarop lagaaya gaya tha."" This clearly indicates that the Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported that Hall had tampered with the exam questions.

While options C and D are mentioned in the passage, they aren't the primary accusation made by the newspaper. Option B is incorrect because the passage states Atlanta Schools *saw* a significant improvement in test scores.
"
"Passage me di gai jaankari ke hisaab se, Dha Atlanta Journal-Constitution ki report mein kis baat ka ullekh nahi kiya gaya tha?","सही उत्तर है **D: शहरी शिक्षा में नए तरीके अपनाने के सुझावों की**।

यहां बताया गया है कि यह उत्तर सही क्यों है:

*   **प्रश्नानुसार, passage में कहा गया है कि Dha Atlanta Journal-Constitution की रिपोर्ट में टेस्ट स्कोर में हुए बदलावों का उल्लेख किया गया था, यह भी कि स्कूल ने आंतरिक समस्याओं को पहचाना लेकिन उन्हें ठीक नहीं किया, और यह भी कि परीक्षण प्रश्नों से छेड़छाड़ हुई थी।**
*   **हालांकि, passage में यह नहीं बताया गया है कि Dha Atlanta Journal-Constitution की रिपोर्ट में शहरी शिक्षा में नए तरीकों को अपनाने के सुझावों का उल्लेख किया गया था।**

अन्य विकल्प सही क्यों नहीं हैं:

*   **A: अंकों की असामान्य रूप से हुई वृद्धि:** passage में कहा गया है कि Atlanta schools में टेस्ट स्कोर में एक बड़ा सुधार देखा गया था।
*   **B: ऐसे सबूतों की जो papers के साथ हुई छेड़छाड़ की:** passage में स्पष्ट रूप से बताया गया है कि सबूत यह संकेत देते हैं कि हॉलने परीक्षा के प्रश्नपत्रों से छेड़छाड़ की थी।
*   **C: साल 2013 के national superintendent के विजेता की:** passage में बताया गया है कि हॉलने को 2013 में राष्ट्रीय superintendent का विजेता घोषित किया गया था।"
"Passage ke hisab se, bumbaari ke baad inme kis baat ke baare me pata chala?","The correct answer is **A: Ghayalon ki kul sankhya (Total number of injured)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""aadhikarik reportsse pushti hoti hai ki 30 tak ghayal hue hain"" (official reports confirm that up to 30 people were injured).
* While the official death toll is mentioned (""aadhikarik mrityu darr aath bataati hain"" - official death toll states eight), the passage explicitly mentions the injured as a known number (up to 30).
* The passage mentions the location of the explosions (""sarkari imaaraton ke paas"" - near government buildings), but doesn't provide a comprehensive list of specific buildings.
* The passage doesn't mention any other explosions.

Therefore, the passage provides the most information about the total number of injured after the bombings.
"
Jeesas ne 2017 mein Manchester City mein shamil hone ke baad se kul kitne match khelein hain?,"The correct answer is **D: 53**.

The passage states: ""Tabse, brazilne sabhi pratiyogitaon mein club ke liye **53 matches** mein bhaag lia..."" (Since then, he has played 53 matches for the club in all competitions...).

The question asks about the number of matches played *since joining Manchester City*. While the fee is mentioned, it's irrelevant to the number of matches played.
"
Jeesas ko kis club se 27 million ki fees dekar apni team me shamil kiya?,"The correct answer is **B: Manchester City**.

The text states: ""21 varshiya jeesas pichle saal janwari 2017 mein **brazil ke club palmyrasse ps 27 million ke kathit fees ke liye manchester city mein shamil hue the**."" (21-year-old Jesus joined Manchester City for a claimed fee of 27 million PS from Brazilian club Palmeiras last year in January 2017.)
"
chhatrawas ke baare me inme se kaunsa kathan sahi nahi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Adhikatar Mehman pavitra sthal se aaye the**

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* **A: Mehman teeratyatra ke lie Makka me the (मेहमान तीर्थयात्री के लिए मक्का में थे):** यह कथन सही है क्योंकि पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से उल्लेख किया गया है कि चतरावस में कई तीर्थयात्री रहते थे जो हज यात्रा से पहले शाम को पवित्र शहर में आते थे।
* **B: Kuch mehman sthaniya nagarik nahi the (कुछ मेहमान स्थानीय नागरिक नहीं थे):** यह कथन सही है क्योंकि पाठ में कहा गया है कि मेहमान ज्यादातर संयुक्त अरब अमीरात के नागरिक थे, जिसका अर्थ है कि कुछ गैर-स्थानीय नागरिक भी थे।
* **C: Mehman hajj yarta ki poorv sandhya ke lie aaye the (मेहमान हज यात्रा की पूर्व संध्या के लिए आए थे):** यह कथन भी सही है क्योंकि पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से उल्लेख किया गया है कि तीर्थयात्री हज यात्रा से पहले शाम को आते थे।
* **D: Adhikatar Mehman pavitra sthal se aaye the (अधिकतर मेहमान पवित्र स्थल से आए थे):** यह कथन गलत है।  पाठ में कहा गया है कि मेहमान *ज्यादातर* संयुक्त अरब अमीरात के नागरिक थे। यह नहीं कहा गया है कि वे पवित्र स्थल से आए थे, बल्कि यह कहा गया है कि वे हज यात्रा के लिए मक्का में आए थे।

इसलिए, विकल्प D कथन है जो चतरावस के बारे में गलत है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kaunsa kathan sahi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Mehman hajj yatra ke poorv sandhya ke lie aaye the.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""...kayee teerthayaatri rehte the jo hajj yatra ke poorv sandhya par pavitra shahar mein aate the."" This directly translates to ""...many pilgrims stayed who came to the holy city on the eve of the Hajj pilgrimage.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Koi mrityu nahi hui (No one died):** The passage explicitly states ""Marane vaalon ke sankhya kamse kam 15 hai"" (The number of dead is at least 15).
* **B: Sabhi mehman Sanyukt Arab Amirat ke nagrik the (All guests were citizens of the United Arab Emirates):** The passage says ""Chhatrawas ke mehman adhikatar sanyukt arab amirat ke nagrik the"" (The guests of the accommodation were mostly citizens of the United Arab Emirates), not *all* of them.
* **D: Adhiktar mehman makka ke sthaniya log the (The majority of guests were local people of Mecca):** The passage states the majority were from the United Arab Emirates.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, takraav ke baare me kaunsi jaankari pukhta nahi hai?","The correct answer is **A: Takraav ke size ki (The size of the collision)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that scientists are *still trying to determine* the size of the crash.** This indicates that the size is not yet definitively known.
* **The passage mentions the crash location (altitude of 491 miles), the impact rate, and the potential impact on Earth.**  These are aspects that scientists are investigating and discussing.
* **The passage explicitly says that the US Department of Defense is monitoring debris.** This confirms that the location of the debris is being tracked.

Therefore, the only piece of information the passage says is *not* firmly established is the size of the collision."
"Passage ke hisab se, takraav ke baare me abhi kis baat ka pata lagaya jaana baaki hai?","सही उत्तर है **D: Crash kitna bada tha**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि वैज्ञानिकों को यह पता लगाने की कोशिश करना जारी है कि दुर्घटना कितनी बड़ी थी। अन्य विकल्प, A, B, और C, पाठ में सीधे तौर पर संबोधित नहीं किए गए हैं। जबकि अमेरिकी रक्षा विभाग मलबा ट्रैक कर रहा है, और यह बताया गया है कि वैज्ञानिकों को टक्कर के आकार को मापने में परेशानी हो रही है, इसलिए D सबसे सटीक उत्तर है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, sabse ameer amerikiyon ke soochi mein Batten ko kis asthan par rakha gaya tha?","The correct answer is **C: 190 vein**.

The passage states: ""2008 ke 400 sabse ameer amerikiyon ke soochi mein Batten ko $ 2.3 billion ke anumaanit sampatti ke saath **190 vein asthan par rakhaa gaya tha**."" (In the list of the 400 wealthiest Americans in 2008, Batten was ranked at 190th place with an estimated fortune of $2.3 billion.)
"
Batten ne inmein se kisko daan diya?,"The correct answer is **C: kaafi saare sansthanon ko** (to quite a few institutions).

Here's why:

The passage states that Batten ""was a major donor to various institutions."" While he attended Virginia University, the passage doesn't say he only donated to it. It explicitly says he was a ""major donor"" to many organizations. Option A is incorrect because he didn't donate to the list of wealthiest Americans. Option B is only partially correct, as he did donate to Virginia University, but the passage indicates broader giving. Option D is too specific; while he may have donated to colleges focused on arts and science, the passage doesn't state that *specifically*.
"
Governor Ernold schwarzenegger ne inme se kis bill par hastaskhar nahi kiye hain?,"The correct answer is **C: California ke bahar nabaligo ko beche ya kiraye par die jaane vaale hinsak video game ke ban par**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Governor Schwarzenegger signed a bill banning the sale or rental of violent video games to minors *within California*.  It doesn't mention any action regarding a ban outside of California. The other options are all directly mentioned as part of the bill he signed.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kaun kahi gayi baato ko ansuna karta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Miller**.

The passage states: ""Jab tippani ke liye kahaa gaya, toh Miller ne kahaa, """"Mike sunate samay bahut saaree baatein karta hai ... mein taiyar ho rahaa tha isliye wah jo kaha rahaa tha mein vaastav mein use soon nahin rahaa tha.""""""  This translates to: ""When asked for a comment, Miller said, """"Mike talks a lot while listening... I was getting ready so I wasn't really listening to what he was saying.""""""

Therefore, Miller admits to not listening to what Mike was saying.
"
"Passgae ke hisab se, baate sunne ke mamle mein Miller ke lie inmein se kaunsi baat sach hai?","Passage ke hisab se, sahi jawab **B: Vah taiyaar hone ki vajah se baate sahi se sun nahi saka** hai.

Passage mein Miller ke kahne ka matlab hai ki woh taiyaar hone ke karan Duvall ki baaton par poora dhayan nahin de pa raha tha.  Usne ""mike sunate samay bahut saaree baatein karta hai... mein taiyar ho rahaa tha isliye wah jo kaha rahaa tha mein vaastav mein use soon nahin rahaa tha"" kaha.  Yeh dikhata hai ki Miller busy tha aur uske dhyan vichar Duvall ki baaton se hat gaya tha.

Dusre options sahi nahin hain kyunki:

* **A: Duvall ne baaton ke dauraan Miller par prabhav daala:** Passage mein yeh bataya gaya hai ki Duvall ne Miller par prabhav nahin daala.
* **C: Duvall ke bachhe baaton ke beech me bahut baatein kar rahe the:** Passage mein Duvall ke bachhon ka zikr nahin hai.
* **D: Vah Duvall ki kahaani par pura dhayan de raha tha:** Passage mein Miller ke busy hone ka zikr hai, dhayan dene ka nahin.
"
‘Swachh Vayu Adhiniyam’ (clean air aikt) mein sudhar karne ka sujhav kisne dia?,"The correct answer is **B: The Conservative Party**.

The text states: ""Laytonne pmse mulakat ke dauran conservative party ke paryaavaran bill mein badalaav ke liye kahaa tha. ab conservative party ke paryaavaran bill ko """"poori tarah se phir se likhne"""" ke liye kahaa jaa rahaa hai."" This indicates the Conservative Party suggested changes to the Clean Air Act, and later the bill itself is being rewritten.
"
Is baat ka kisne khandan kia ki ‘Swachh Vayu Adhiniyam’ chunav se pehle kiya jaane vala stunt hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Rajya sarkar ke adhikari (State government officials)**.

The passage states: ""Jab sanghiya sarkarne devonport, tasmania mein mercy aspatal ka vittaposhan karne ke liye kadam uthaaya, tab **rajya sarkar aur kuch sanghiya sansadonne november tak bulaaye jaane vaale sanghiya chunaav ke prastaavana mein is karya ke aalochana ke**."" This translates to ""When the central government took steps to finance the Mercy Hospital in Devonport, Tasmania, then the **state government and some national parliamentarians criticized this action in the lead-up to the upcoming federal election in November**.""

This criticism indicates that the state government officials (and the parliamentarians they represent) viewed the central government's actions as a political stunt ahead of the election.
"
Jab Cyanuric acid aur melamine compound billi ke mutra mein ek dusre ke sath pratikriya karte hain to kya banata hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Crystal**.

The passage explicitly states: ""do compound ek dusre ke saath milkar crystal banaate hain..."" which translates to ""the two compounds form crystals together...""
"
Shodhkarta infrared spectroscopy ka istemaal kise observe karne ke lie karte hain?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Paltu janwar ke mutra mein crystal bante hue**.

**व्याख्या:**

प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि शोधकर्ताओं ने इन्फ्रारेड स्पेक्ट्रोस्कोपी (FTIR) का उपयोग करके मेल खाने वाले क्रिस्टल की संरचना की तुलना की जो प्रभावित पालतू जानवरों के मूत्र में पाए गए थे। FTIR का उपयोग पदार्थों की आणविक संरचना को निर्धारित करने के लिए किया जाता है। इस मामले में, वे यह देखने के लिए FTIR का उपयोग कर रहे थे कि क्या दूषित पालतू भोजन के कारण पालतू जानवरों के मूत्र में बनने वाले क्रिस्टल के समान क्रिस्टल बन रहे हैं।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: Kidney ke karyapranali (किडनी की कार्यप्रणाली):**  इन्फ्रारेड स्पेक्ट्रोस्कोपी सीधे किडनी की कार्यप्रणाली को देखने के लिए नहीं उपयोग किया जाता है।
*   **C: Jo paltu janwar prabhavit hue (जो पालतू जानवर प्रभावित हुए):** FTIR सीधे तौर पर प्रभावित जानवरों को देखने के लिए नहीं उपयोग किया जाता है, बल्कि उनके मूत्र में बनने वाले क्रिस्टल की संरचना को देखने के लिए उपयोग किया जाता है।
*   **D: Dooshit paltu bhojan (दूषित पालतू भोजन):** FTIR का उपयोग दूषित पालतू भोजन की संरचना की जांच के लिए किया जा सकता है, लेकिन इस प्रश्न में इसका उपयोग मूत्र में बनने वाले क्रिस्टल की संरचना की तुलना करने के लिए किया जा रहा है।"
Luna ko “Queen of Extreme” kisne kaha?,"The correct answer is **D: Tommy Dreamer**.

The text states: """"Luna pahali queen off extreme thi. ... wah raatuski tarah hi khaas thi."""" This quote is attributed to Tommy Dreamer.
"
Luna ko “ajib” kisne kaha?,"The correct answer is **B: Dustin Runnels**.

The text states: ""Dustin """"goldst"""" Runnelsne tippani ke ki """"Luna mere jaisi hi ajib thi..."""" which translates to ""Dustin ""goldst"" Runnels commented that ""Luna was just like me, strange..."""".
"
Durghatna mein driver ke sath inmein se kya nahi hua?,"The correct answer is **C: Use Cambridge ke Great Yarmoth aspatal mein le jaya gaya**.

Here's why:

* The text states the driver was initially taken to Great Yarmouth's Gems Paigat Hospital, then *transferred* to Edenbrook Hospital in Cambridge.  He wasn't initially taken *to* Great Yarmouth's Great Yarmouth Hospital.

Let's look at why the other options *are* correct:

* **A: Usko sir me chot aayi (He got a head injury):** The text explicitly states he suffered serious head injuries.
* **B: Usne ghar ke andar kisi ko nuksaan nahi pahuchaya (He didn't harm anyone inside the house):** The text says he crashed *into* something but no one in the house was hurt.
* **D: Apataklin sevaaon ne gaadi se nikalne mein madad ki (Emergency services helped him out of the car):**  The text clearly states the emergency services extracted him from the red Audi TT.



"
Rugby Taurnament ke dauraan Dakshin Africa ke gameplay mein kaunsi chiz sabse hatkar dikhai di?,"The correct answer is **A: Shaandar team work**.

The passage states: ""Unaki anushaasit raksha, gendbaji ke calla aur **team ke achche kamne** unhein baahar khadaa kar diya..."" This translates to ""Their disciplined defense, bowling skills and **team's good work** got them out...""  This clearly indicates strong teamwork was a key factor in their success.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Dakshin Africa ke khel mein kab sudhar hua?","The correct answer is **D: Taurnament ke aage badhne par**.

The passage states: ""Unaki anushaasit raksha, gendbaji ke calla aur team ke achche kamne unhein baahar khadaa kar diya aur ab yah saaf ho gaya tha ke yeteam takkar degi."" This indicates that their performance improved as the tournament progressed, leading to the expectation of a strong competition.

Option A is incorrect because the match started at 10:00, but the improvement didn't happen immediately at the start. Option B is incorrect as the passage doesn't mention Raska's strategy. Option C is incorrect because the passage says they improved *after* the match against their sisters.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kaunsa kathan Chean ki arthavyavastha ko satik roop se nahi dikhata?","The correct answer is **D: Chean ne germany ki tulna mein adhik karon ka niryaat kabhi nahi kiya**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Pahali baar, pichle saal Chean germany ke tulna mein adhik karon ka niryaat kiya...""  This directly contradicts option D.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **A: Sudhar ke baad se Chean ki arthvyavastha mein tezi se badhotari hui:** The passage says ""Pehle aarthik sudhaar deng ke netritva mein hue Tabhise, chean ka aarthik aakar 90 gunaa bada gaya hai."" This clearly indicates rapid growth.
* **B: Car ke vyapar ke lie Chean me America se bhi badha bazaar hai:**  The passage mentions ""Pahali baar, pichle saal chean germany ke tulna mein adhik karon ka niryaat kiya aur is vyavasaay kshetra ke sabse badey bazar ke sanyukt rajya americase age nickel gaya."" This directly states China surpassed the US in car exports.
* **C: Chean ke gdp america ke gdp se zyada ho sakti hai:** The passage concludes with ""Chean ke gdp aane waale do dashakon may america ke gdpse zyada ho sakti hai.""



Therefore, option D is the only statement that is not accurate according to the passage."
"Passage ke hisab se, Chean ki gdp America ki gdp se kitne samay me aage nikal sakti hai?","The correct answer is **B: Do dashakon mein (In two decades)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Chean ke gdp aane waale do dashakon may america ke gdpse zyada ho sakti hai."" This translates to ""China's GDP could exceed America's GDP in the next two decades.""
"
Hu ne vikashil deshon ko kya karne ka sujhav dia?,"The correct answer is **D: Pradooshan ke purane rastho se bachne ka** (Avoiding pollution from old methods).

Here's why:

The text states: ""Unhone vikashil deshon ko """"puraane tareekonse pradooshan failaanese rokne aur baad mein safai karne ke liye protsaahit kiya.""""""  This directly translates to ""They encouraged developing countries to prevent pollution from old methods and clean up later.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jimmedari lene ka jisse unka vikas tezi se ho** (Taking responsibility so that their development happens quickly): This is the opposite of what the text suggests.  The text is about *limiting* responsibility to what developing countries can handle.
* **B: Aarthik utpaadan par dhyan dena** (Focusing on economic production): While the text mentions economic production as a basis for the cuts, it doesn't suggest focusing *on* it as a suggestion to developing countries.
* **C: Apni maujood jimmedariyon ke alava aur jimmedari nibhane ka** (Fulfilling additional responsibilities beyond their existing ones):  This is also the opposite of what the text suggests. The text emphasizes that developing countries should *not* take on responsibilities beyond their capacity.



"
Hu ne kis baat ka ullekh nahi kiya?,"The correct answer is **D: Carbon utsarjan ki katautee ka aankada (Data on carbon emission reduction)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while the goal is to reduce carbon dioxide emissions per unit of domestic production by 20% from 2005 to 2020, **they did not specify any data for the reduction**. The text explicitly mentions that the targets would be based on China's economic output, but no concrete numbers were given.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: katauti ka adhar (Basis of reduction):** The passage does mention that the targets will be based on China's economic output.
* **B: Pradooshan ke mamle mein vikasashil deshon ko sujhav (Suggestion to developing countries on pollution):** The passage clearly states that developed countries urged developing countries to avoid polluting in the old ways and clean up later.
* **C: Vah taareekh jisme ummeed hai ki carbon ke utsarjan mein katautee hogi (Date on which carbon emission reduction is expected):**  The passage specifies the timeframe (2005-2020) for the reduction.



Therefore, the only thing Hu did *not* mention is specific data or numbers related to the carbon emission reduction.



"
Veeraman ne inmein se kiske lie kaha ki haalat achche nahin hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Angola**.

Richard Veermanne said that the situation in Angola is very bad. The text states: ""angola mein mahamari failane ke rtaar ab tak ke sabse bure daur mein pahunch gayi hai aur vahan ke haalat bahut kharab hain."" which translates to ""The spread of the epidemic in Angola has reached the worst period so far, and the conditions there are very bad.""



"
Abhiyojan ki vajah se Hoon ka cabinet pad kaun lega?,"The correct answer is **C: Lamb**.

The text explicitly states: ""saansad norman lamb ke vyapar mantri banane ke ummid hai. yah pada devi ke mantrimandal mein jaane ke vajah se khaali hui hai."" This translates to ""It is expected that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will be appointed as the Minister of Business. This post has become vacant due to Devi going into the cabinet.""

Therefore, Norman Lamb will likely take Hoon's cabinet position.
"
Abhiyojan ke maddenajar vyapar mantree ki bhoomika kaun nibhaega?,"The correct answer is **A: Lamb**.

The text states: ""saansad norman lamb ke vyapar mantri banane ke ummid hai."" which translates to ""It is expected that Member of Parliament Norman Lamb will be appointed as the Minister of Business.""
"
Kemili cent-sense opera ke dauraan kalakar darshakon ko kya karane ke lie protsaahit karate hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Munch par performance me shamil hone ke lie**.

Here's why:

The question asks what the actor encourages the audience to do. The text states, ""...yetheatre khud darshakon ko bhi isamen saath shamil hone ke liye prerit karte hain,"" which translates to ""...theatre itself encourages the audience to participate in this."" This directly means the audience is encouraged to participate in the performance (on the stage/munch).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ganje bhari sigaraten peene ke lie:** The actor is *smoking* these cigarettes, but the text doesn't say he's encouraging the audience to do so.
* **B: Japan ki yatra karne ke lie:**  There's no mention of encouraging a trip to Japan.
* **D: Unhe apni zindagi ki pasandida chize karne ke lie:** This is not mentioned in the text. The story focuses on the actor's addiction and its impact.



"
Opera ke dauraan mukhya roop se sigarate kaun peeta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Kalakaar (Actor)**.

The text states: ""munch par kalakar ganje bhari sigaraten peete hain"" which translates to ""on the stage, the actor(s) smoke marijuana-filled cigarettes.""
"
"""Leonov ka """"spacewalk"""" vala doosara naam kya hai?""","The correct answer is **C: Extravehicular activity**.

The text states: ""18 march 1965 ko unhone antariksh yaan ke baahar akele baarah minutese zyada samay tak rahkar pahali maanavyukt chahalkadami (eva), yaa **""""spacewalk"""" kiya**.""  Then it explains that ""spacewalk"" is another name for this activity.  And the text also mentions ""pahali maanavyukt chahalkadami"" which translates to ""first manned spacewalk"".  ""Extravehicular activity"" is the standard English term for what the text describes.
"
Lenove ne kis mission ke soviate bhaag ka netritva kiya?,"The correct answer is **B: Apollo-Soyuz**.

The text states: ""Dasa saal baad, unhone apolo-soyuz mission ke soviate bhaag ka netritva kiya jo yah darshaata raha ki antariksh race samaapt ho gayi thi."" (Ten years later, he led the Soviet part of the Apollo-Soyuz mission which demonstrated that the space race was over.)
"
Durghatna me kaun ghayal hua?,"The correct answer is **A: Gibson**.

The text states: ""Durghatna ke baad, gibson ko aspatal pahunchaaya gaya lekin kuch hi samay baad unaki mrityu ho gayee."" (After the accident, Gibson was taken to the hospital but died shortly after.)

The text also mentions the truck driver wasn't injured. The workers at the garage and the children were witnesses and fled the scene.
"
Jin logon ke sath durghatana hui unka kya hua?,"The correct answer is **A: Dono mar gaye**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Gibson ko aspatal pahunchaaya gaya lekin kuch hi samay baad unaki mrityu ho gayee"" which means Gibson died shortly after being taken to the hospital.
* It also says, ""Truck chaalak...durghatna mein ghayal nahin hua tha"" (The truck driver...was not injured in the accident). While he wasn't injured, the question asks what *happened* to people involved in the accident. Since Gibson died, the driver, although unharmed, was still involved in the tragic event. Therefore, the best answer is that both people connected to the accident resulted in death or serious consequences (one died, the other was involved in a fatal accident).

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Ek ko kuch nahi hua, doosra mar gaya:** The truck driver was not injured, so this isn't accurate.
* **C: Vey ro aur chilla rahe the:** This describes the children at the scene, not those involved in the accident.
* **D: Dono ghayal ho gaye:** Gibson died, so this is false.
"
Karyakram par kaam kar rahe vaigyaanik inmein se kiski vajah se hone vaale prabhaavon ko observe karne ki ummeed kar rahe the?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Dark matter**

यहाँ क्यों:

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि टीम ""आकाशगंगा के डार्क मैटर और मिल्की वे के डार्क मैटर के बीच जवारीया बलों के कारण"" होने वाले प्रभाव की तलाश कर रही थी।  इसके अलावा, यह कहा गया है कि वे यह निर्धारित करने के लिए प्रोग्राम लिख रहे थे कि डार्क मैटर सामान्य पदार्थ को किस प्रकार प्रभावित करता है।

अन्य विकल्प सही नहीं हैं:

* **A: Aam padaarth:** सामान्य पदार्थ के प्रभाव की तुलना डार्क मैटर के प्रभाव से की जा रही है, इसलिए यह मुख्य फोकस नहीं है।
* **B: Jwaar bhaata:**  ज्वार-भाटा की तुलना डार्क मैटर के प्रभाव से की गई है, लेकिन यह टीम की रुचि का प्राथमिक क्षेत्र नहीं है।
* **C: Chhote kan:**  छोटे कणों का उल्लेख है, लेकिन यह डार्क मैटर के प्रभावों की खोज के संदर्भ में अधिक सामान्य है।"
Vaigyaanik inmein se kaunse matter ko observe kar rahe the?,"The correct answer is **D: Sagitarius galaxy aur akashganga**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Team jis prabhaav ke talash mein thi wah akashganga ke dark matter aur milky way ke dark matter ke beach jwaariya balon ke karanse hota hoga...Vaigyaanik yah nishkarsh nikalane mein saksham the ki kala padaarth any kale padaarth ko use tarah prabhaavit karta hai jis tarah se aam padaarth karta hai.""

This indicates the scientists were observing the dark matter in the Milky Way (akashganga) and the Sagitarius galaxy to understand the gravitational effects between them. The moon and Earth are mentioned only as an analogy for the gravitational pull.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, roodhivaadiyon ne kiski aalochana nahin ki?","The correct answer is **A: Rahat raashi ke kharch ki**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ""kuch rajkoshiya roodhivaadiyonne """"bushes ke nyu orleans deal"""" ka mazaak banaaya hai"" and that ""Punarnirmaan ke koshish ke spasht aalochana washington ke kathit ghanisht logon ko punarnirmaan ke theke die jaane par kendrit rahi hai.""

* **""bushes ke nyu orleans deal"" ka mazaak banaaya hai:** This implies the conservatives mocked the deal, which likely involved spending and potential mismanagement of funds. This points towards criticism of spending.
* **""Punarnirmaan ke theke die jaane par kendrit rahi hai""**:  This directly states that the criticism focused on the awarding of reconstruction contracts to specific people in Washington.

Options B, C, and D are all implied criticisms mentioned in the passage.  Option A (Rahat raashi ke kharch ki - spending on relief funds) is not explicitly mentioned. Therefore, the conservative critics did not criticize the spending on relief funds, according to this passage.
"
Toofaan catarina ke rahat prayaason ke lie punarnirmaan contract ki aalochana kaun kar raha hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Washington ke logon ne**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Punarnirmaan ke koshish ke spasht aalochana washington ke kathit ghanisht logon ko punarnirmaan ke theke die jaane par kendrit rahi hai."" 

This translates to: ""Clear criticism of the reconstruction efforts has focused on awarding reconstruction contracts to the closely connected people of Washington.""

Therefore, the people of Washington are criticizing the reconstruction contract. Option A mentions ""rajkoshiya roodhivaadiyonne"" (conservative bureaucrats) making fun of something, but the *criticism* of the contracts specifically comes from Washington people.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, stardust antariksh yaan ke light sabse pehle kahaan dikhai degi?","The correct answer is **B: Northern California**.

The passage states: """"yah uttari california ke paschimi that par chalega aur..."""" which translates to ""it will travel along the western part of Northern California...""  Therefore, Northern California is the first place mentioned where the light show will be visible.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, antariksh yaan inmein se kaunsa record banayega?","सही उत्तर है **C: सबसे तेज़ी से धरती पर वापस लौटने का।**

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""Stardust धरती के ओर इतनी तेज़ी से वापस लौटेगा कि अब तक के सारे रिकॉर्ड टूट जाएंगे। फिलहाल यह रिकॉर्ड अपोलो X के कमांड मॉड्यूल का है जो मई, 1969 में सबसे तेज़ गति से धरती में वापस लौटा था।""
"
Dr. Malar Balasubramanian ka Saroja Balasubramanian se kya sambandh tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Mata (Mother)**.

The text states that Saroj Balasubramanian was 53 years old and covered in blood, and Dr. Malar Balasubramanian was found near her.  The name similarity strongly suggests they were mother and daughter.
"
Sara Balasubramanian ka shav kahaan mila?,"The correct answer is **B: Sadak ke bagal mein**.

The text states: ""...found on the roadside about 15 miles north of Cincinnati in the suburb of Blue Ash, Ohio..."". This clearly indicates the body was found on the roadside.
"
eBay ne kiska adhigrahan kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Skype**.

The passage states: ""eBay ke itihas mein sabse bada adhigrahan hai...Skype ke pakad mazboot hai..."" This translates to: ""eBay's biggest acquisition in history is...Skype has a strong hold...""

Therefore, eBay acquired Skype.
"
Is adhigrahan se eBay kya haasil karana chaahata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Naye chhetro me vistar karna (Expand into new markets)**.

The passage states that eBay is making a large acquisition in regions where Skype has a strong foothold (China, Eastern Europe, and Brazil).  This directly indicates a desire to expand into those new geographical markets.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Apne revenue ko consolidate karna (Consolidate revenue):**  While consolidation *can* be a result of acquisitions, the passage doesn't suggest this as the primary goal. The focus is on *new* regions.
* **C: Apni profile ko behtar banana (Improve its profile):**  A better profile *might* be a side effect, but it's not the explicit goal stated.
* **D: Apne sheyaradharkon ko santushth karna (Satisfy shareholders):**  This is a possible underlying motivation for *any* business decision, but the passage doesn't directly mention shareholder satisfaction. The core message is about geographic expansion.



Therefore, **B** is the most direct and accurate interpretation of eBay's intentions based on the provided text."
"Passage ke hisab se, kisne ladai ke baad yard mein rah gaye kaidiyon se baatchit nahin ki?","The correct answer is **A: Vartaakaron ne** (The negotiators).

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Baatchit karne vaalonne isthiti ko sudhaarne ke koshish ke, lekin kaidiyon ke maang spasht nahin hai."" (Negotiators tried to improve the situation, but the prisoners' demands were not clear.) This implies that the negotiators were *attempting* to communicate, but the prisoners weren't willing to clearly state their demands.  The other options are incorrect:

* **Agni bachav dal ne (Firefighters):** The firefighters extinguished the fire, not engaged in conversation.
* **Adhikariyon ne (Officers):** The officers used tear gas to subdue the prisoners.  They weren't negotiating.
* **Aspatal ke staff ne (Hospital staff):** The hospital staff treated the injured, but the passage doesn't mention them directly engaging in conversation with the prisoners.



Therefore, the passage implies the negotiators were unable to effectively communicate with the remaining prisoners after the fight.



"
Inmein se kiski vajah se antatah kaidi dange se peechhe hat gaye?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Aansu gas (Aansu gas)**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

* पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से उल्लेख किया गया है कि ""जल्दी ही, दंगा संबंधी उपकरणों से लैस अधिकारियों ने हाते में प्रवेश किया और आंसू गैस की मदद से कैदियों को काबू में कर लिया।""
* आंसू गैस का उपयोग दंगा रोकने और कैदियों को नियंत्रित करने के लिए किया गया था, जिससे उन्हें दंगा छोड़ने के लिए मजबूर होना पड़ा।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

* **A: सफल बातचीत:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि बातचीत करने वालों ने स्थिति को सुधारने की कोशिश की, लेकिन कैदियों की मांग स्पष्ट नहीं थी, इसलिए बातचीत सफल नहीं हुई।
* **C: घायल साथियों की वजह से:** घायल साथियों की वजह से कैदियों का दंगा छोड़ने का कोई उल्लेख नहीं है।
* **D: आग की वजह से:** आग को बुझा दिया गया था, और आग लगने से दंगा रोकने का कोई संबंध नहीं बताया गया है।"
"Ayatollah Ali Khamenei ki raay mein, Iraan desh ko khud ko kis chiz se mukt karana chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Tail pe nirbharta (Oil self-sufficiency)**.

The passage states: ""Desh ke supreme leader ayatollah ally **khaamenine tell par nirbharta ko ek aise """"jaal"""" ke roop mein paribhaashit kiya hai jo 1979 mein iraan ke islamic kranti ke pahle se bunaa jaa raha hai aur jisase desh ko apne aapko azad karna chaahiye.**"" This translates to: ""The country's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has defined oil self-sufficiency as a 'web' that has been woven since the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution and through which the country should free itself.""

Therefore, Khamenei believes Iran should free itself through achieving oil self-sufficiency. While the other options are mentioned in the context of sanctions, the passage explicitly connects the desire for freedom to oil self-sufficiency.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Irani arthavyavastha par pratibandh ke prabhaav ko kisne swikar kiya?","The correct answer is **A: Varishth sootron ne**.

The passage states: ""Television par kiye gaye live comments mein pahali baar senior iranian sootronne yah maanaa tha ki pratibandhon ko koi prabhaav hua tha."" (In live comments on television, for the first time, a senior Iranian official admitted that the sanctions had an impact.)

Therefore, a senior Iranian official (sootron) admitted that the sanctions had an impact on the Iranian economy."
Inmein se kya frace ki matdan prakriya ka hissa nahin hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Ummidvaar ke pratinidhiyon dvaara voton ki ginati kiya jana** (Counting of votes by candidate's representatives).

Here's why:

The text states that the counting of votes is done by **""swayamsevakon dwara vishisht prakriyaon ka paalan karte hue kadee nigrani mein maton ke ginati ke jaati hai.""** This translates to ""counting of votes is done under strict supervision by volunteers following specific procedures."" It *doesn't* say that the candidates' representatives are involved in the counting process.  Instead, it emphasizes independent supervision.

Let's look at why the other options *are* part of the French voting process described in the text:

*   **A: Pardarshi matdan boxes** (Transparent ballot boxes) - Explicitly mentioned as being in place since 1988.
*   **B: Ummidavaron ki aur se bheje gaye pratinidhi** (Representatives sent by candidates) -  The text states representatives can be sent to observe the process.
*   **C: Voting roll par hastaakshar karana** (Signing the voting roll) -  This is clearly mentioned as a step in the voting process.



Therefore, option D is the only option not supported by the provided text."
Matdata apne chune hue ummidvaar ka sanket kahaan dete hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Lifafe par** (On the envelope).

The passage states: ""matadaata khud ko booth mein alag-thalag kar lete hain, ek kagaj ke ek poorv-mudrit shit daalte hain jo lifafe mein unki pasand ke ummidwar ko darshaati hai.""  This translates to: ""Voters isolate themselves in the booth, place a pre-printed slip of paper in an envelope showing their preferred candidate.""
"
Allen ko Musashi ki aath saal ki khoj shuroo karne ke lie kis chiz se prerna mili?,"The correct answer is **A: Uski sampatti se (His wealth)**.

The passage states: ""Duniya ke sabse dhanee logon mein se ek alonne apni sampatti ka adhikansh hissa samudri khoj mein lagaaya..."" which translates to ""One of the wealthiest people in the world invested most of his wealth in marine exploration...""  This directly indicates that his wealth was the driving force behind starting Musashi's eight-year search.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Unki samudree tal manchitran ki ruchi se (His interest in marine mapping):** While the passage mentions using sea level mapping, it doesn't state that the wealthy person was personally interested in marine mapping. The interest was in finding the wreckage.
* **C: Unke samudree anveshan mein nivesh se (His investment in marine exploration):**  This is too vague. The *investment* was *because* of his wealth.
* **D: Unke yudh me hone vali dilchaspi se (His interest in war):** The passage explicitly says he wanted Musashi to find something *outside* of war. This eliminates this option.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Allen ne apne dhan ka ek ahem hissa kis par kharch kiya?","The correct answer is **B: Samudri anveshan mein (In marine exploration)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Duniya ke sabse dhanee logon mein se ek alonne apni sampatti ka adhikansh hissa samudri khoj mein lagaaya aur mushishi ko yuddh mein aajivan ruchise baahar khojne ke liye apni khoj shuru ke."" This translates to: ""One of the richest people in the world invested the majority of his wealth in marine exploration and started the search for Musashi, who had completely withdrawn from the world of warfare.""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inmein se kiske karan plant mein aur uske aas-pas khataranaak sthitiyaan utpann hone ki sambhavana hai?","The correct answer is **A: Uranium Idhan**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that authorities believe the uranium fuel containers *broke and are leaking*. This leakage is the source of the dangerous situation.
* While radioactive caesium and iodine are detected, they are *products* of the uranium leak. They are the *result* of the uranium being exposed.
* The white smoke is a symptom of the problem, not the primary cause.

Therefore, the broken uranium fuel containers are the direct cause of the dangerous situation.
"
Plant mein hui ghatna ke baad sthaniy nivasiyon ko bataye gaye suraksha sujhavon mein se kaunsa inmein se ek nahin hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Safed dhuyen ko andar lene ke lie (To inhale the white smoke)**.

Here's why:

* The report states the white smoke is a sign of a serious incident involving radioactive materials.
* All the other options (turning off air conditioners, staying indoors, and avoiding tap water) are safety precautions to minimize exposure to radiation and potential contamination.
* Inhaling the white smoke would directly expose people to potentially harmful radioactive particles.

Therefore, option C is the *opposite* of a recommended safety precaution.
"
"Dr. Moll ke hisab se, XDR-TB ke baare mein sabse chintaajanak baat kya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Iski mrityu dar bahut adhik hai (Its mortality rate is very high)**.

The passage explicitly states that Dr. Moll described XDR-TB as ""bahut zyada mrityu darr ke karan bahut chintajanak aur khatarnaak tha"" which translates to ""very alarming and dangerous due to a very high mortality rate.""  While the other options are also mentioned, the high mortality rate is directly highlighted as the most concerning aspect.
"
Naye variant se sankramit kitane marizon ke svasthyakarmi hone ki pushti ki gayi?,"The correct answer is **D: 1**.

The passage states: ""...in mein kamse kam do aspatal swaasthya karyakarta the."" This means at least two healthcare workers were infected. While the text mentions the potential for one infected person to transmit to 10-15 contacts, it specifically confirms that **at least one** healthcare worker was infected.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate answer based on the provided text.
"
Nextjen pranali kis takneek ka upyog karti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Upgrah-aadhaarit takneek**

The passage explicitly states: ""yah upgrah-aadhaarit praudyogiki ka upayog karta hai..."" which translates to ""it uses satellite-based technology...""

While the technology *improves* precision (as mentioned in the passage), the core technology being used is satellite-based. Therefore, option A is the most accurate answer.
"
Nextjen hawai yatayat niyantrakon ko sidhe kaise laabh pahunchaata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Adhik steak vimaan ki jagah (More steak information for aircraft)**.

The text explicitly states that Nextgen helps air traffic controllers by providing pilots with ""adhik steak jaankari"" which translates to ""more steak information"" or, more accurately, ""more steak (situational) information"". This is a simplified way of saying more detailed and accurate information about the aircraft's location and surrounding environment.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chhote udaan maarg (Shorter flight paths):** While Nextgen *enables* shorter flight paths, the text doesn't directly say this is a benefit to air traffic controllers. It's a consequence of the improved accuracy.
* **C: Carbon utsarjan mein kami (Reduced carbon emissions):**  This is a *result* of Nextgen's efficiency, but it's not a direct benefit *to* the air traffic controllers.
* **D: Kam Indhan (Less fuel):** Similar to carbon emissions, this is a result of the improved efficiency, not a direct benefit to the controllers.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, kis chiz par dhyan kendrit karne ke lie itihasakaron ne FBI ki aalochana nahin ki?","The correct answer is **B: Asani se sulajhane vaale aparaadhon ke lie sansaadhan aavantit karne par**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that historians criticized FBI policies *focused on addressing the fear of failure* and specifically mentions the agency's struggle with cases like **car theft**. 
* The passage also highlights Congress allocating funds in 2005 to dedicate agents to **adult pornography**. This suggests a focus on that specific area, not necessarily on ease of resolution of crimes.
* Option A is incorrect because the passage states that the criticism was related to the *fear of failure* and the desire to *ease* success.
* Option D is incorrect because the passage *does* mention car theft as a specific area of concern.



Therefore, option B is the only one that's *not* mentioned in the passage as a subject of historical criticism regarding FBI policy."
Ashlilta ki pehal FBI ko kya karne ke lie majaboor karti hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Agents ko pornograhy vale mamlo me samarpit karna chahiye (Agents should be dedicated to pornography cases)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Congressne vitt varsh 2005 mein ashlilata ke liye nidhikaran shuru kiya aur nirdisht kiya ki fbi ko vayask pornography ke liye 10 agents ko samarpit karna chaahiye."" (Congress started funding for obscenity in fiscal year 2005 and specified that the FBI should dedicate 10 agents to adult pornography.)

This directly indicates that the funding and subsequent directive *forced* the FBI to dedicate agents to pornography cases. While the passage mentions FBI concerns about its success rate, the direct action taken by Congress is about dedicating agents to pornography. Options A, B, and C are inferences or misinterpretations of the text.
"
JAS 39c Gripen ki durghatana par pratikriya dene vaale agnishaman vahan ka kya hua? ,"The correct answer is **B: Ludhak gaya**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""karravaai karne ke dauran airport ka agnishaamak vaahan **ludhak gaya tha**."" which translates to ""during the response, the airport's fire vehicle **exploded**.""
"
"JAS 39C Gripen ke durghatanagrast hone ke baad, hawai adde ko kiske lie band kar diya gaya tha?","Correct answer is **A: Vaanijyik udaanon**.

The passage explicitly states: ""jiski vajah se vaanijyik udaanon ke liye hawai adde ko band kar diya gaya."" (which resulted in the airport being closed for commercial flights).
"
Irani kranti ke dauraan brejhinski ne kiske salahkar bane the?,"The correct answer is **A: Kissinger**.

The passage explicitly states: ""NSA ke roop mein, unhone kootneetik roop se vishwa mamalon ko sambhaalane mein carter ke sahaayata ke..."" and later mentions the Iranian Revolution which led to the Iran hostage crisis in 1979.  The passage also mentions Brezhinski serving as NSA to Kissinger from 1977-1981. Therefore, Brezhinski was Kissinger's advisor during the Iranian Revolution.
"
Saal 1977 tak rashtriya suraksha salahakar ke pad par kaun raha?,"The correct answer is **B: Kissinger**.

The text states: ""phir 1977se lekar 1981 tak rashtriya suraksha salaahkar (nsa) ke roop mein heinry kissinger ko seva dee."" (then from 1977 to 1981 he served as national security advisor (NSA) under Henry Kissinger.)"
Inmein se kaunsi uplabdi partizen belgrade ke sath bobek ke career ko satik roop se nahin darshati hai?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Unhone sabhi khiladiyon se zyada goal kiye**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

प्रश्नोत्तरी में कहा गया है कि बobeck ने अपने समय में अपनी टीम के साथ 468 मैचों में 403 गोल किए। प्रश्न भी कहता है कि ""Bobeck के तुलना में किसी और ने कभी भी क्लब के लिए ज़्यादा प्रदर्शन या ज़्यादा गोल नहीं किए हैं।"" इसका मतलब है कि बobeck ने टीम के लिए सबसे ज़्यादा गोल किए, लेकिन यह **सभी खिलाड़ियों** के खिलाफ नहीं है। उनकी तुलना में कुछ अन्य खिलाड़ी हो सकते हैं जिन्होंने अधिक गोल किए हैं, लेकिन Partizani Belgrade के इतिहास में किसी अन्य खिलाड़ी ने बobeck की तुलना में अधिक प्रदर्शन नहीं किया है।

इसलिए, यह विकल्प B गलत है क्योंकि यह दावा करता है कि बobeck ने सभी खिलाड़ियों से अधिक गोल किए हैं, जबकि दी गई जानकारी इंगित करती है कि उन्होंने ऐसा नहीं किया।"
Partizan belgrade ke sath bobek ke itihaas ke baare mein inmein se kaunsa kathan satya hai?,"सही उत्तर **A: Unhone 1945 se Partizan ke lie khelna shuru kia** है।

यहाँ बाकी विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

* **B: Partizan belgrade se pehle vah Zagreb ke lie khele:** प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि वह Zagreb में पैदा हुए थे और Belgrade में Partizan के लिए खेले।
* **C: Veh 1995 tak Partizan ke lie khele:** प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि वह 1958 तक Partizan के लिए खेले।
* **D: Partizan ke sabse ache khiladi ke taur par jane jane ke bad usne kafi naam kamaya:** प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि 1995 में उन्हें Partizan के इतिहास के सबसे शानदार खिलाड़ी के रूप में चुना गया था, जिससे पता चलता है कि उन्होंने पहले ही काफी नाम कमा लिया था। यह विकल्प थोड़ा अस्पष्ट है और सही सटीक नहीं है।

इसलिए, केवल विकल्प A पूरी तरह से प्रश्न में दी गई जानकारी से समर्थित है।"
Passage ke anusaar kaun si vishesta Hesperonychus ko Velociraptor se alag banati hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Iska dusra panja bada hai**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Iska doosra panja bada tha, jisase iska naam hesperonicus paan, jiska earth hai """"paschimi panja""""."" (Its second claw was large, which gave it the name Hesperonychus, whose etymology is ""western claw"").

While other options are true about Hesperonychus (it's a warm-blooded predator, bipedal, and a bird), the passage specifically highlights the *large second claw* as a distinguishing feature.
"
“Hesperonychus” ka matlab kis prajati ki sharirik visheshta se nikala gya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Panje**.

The text states: ""Iska doosra panja bada tha, jisase iska naam hesperonicus paan, jiska earth hai """"paschimi panja""""."" This directly translates to ""Its second claw was big, which is why it got the name Hesperonychus, whose meaning is ""western claw"".""
"
Inme se kaun sa kathan shooting ke bare mein shi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Couple ki shaadi ek saal pehle Buffalo mein hui**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Couplene ek saal pehle Texas mein shaadi ke aur apne doston aur rishtedaron ke saath celebrate karne ke liye buffalo aa gaye."" (The couple came to Buffalo a year ago to celebrate their wedding with friends and relatives.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pati aur biwi dono Texas se the** - The passage only says they celebrated their wedding *in* Texas, not that they were from Texas.
* **B: Panch peedit the** - The passage says four people died in the shooting, not five.
* **D: Shooting Buffalo mein hui** - The passage states they came *to* Buffalo to celebrate their anniversary, but it doesn't say the shooting happened in Buffalo.  It only mentions that one of the deceased was born in Buffalo.



"
Inme se kaun sa kathan shooting ka event kahan hua us jagah ke bare mein shi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Buffalo mein varshgaanth ki party mein hui thi.**

Here's why:

* The passage states the couple came to Buffalo to celebrate their first wedding anniversary with friends and relatives.
* It also mentions the shooting happened in the shooting.

Therefore, the shooting occurred during the anniversary party in Buffalo. The other options are incorrect based on the information provided."
"Passage ke hisab se, shuruat me Luno ko lekar adhikaariyon ko chinta kya thi?","सही उत्तर है **A: उर्वरक Cargo की कमी**।

पैसेज में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि 100 मीटर का जहाज अपना सामान्य खाद्य सामग्री लेने के लिए जा रहा था, और अधिकारियों को शुरू में डर था कि माल का भार अधिक होगा। इससे पता चलता है कि उनकी चिंता उर्वरक कार्गो की मात्रा से संबंधित थी।"
"Passage ke hisab se, Luno ke tootane ke baare mein inmein se kaun sa kathan satya nahin hai?","The correct answer is **B: Tootane ke samay jahaaz mein 100 meter eendhan bhara hua tha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states the Luno was carrying 120-160 cubic meters of *eendhan* (fuel), not 100 meters.** The question is trying to trick you by using the same word, but the units are different. 100 meters is a length, while cubic meters is a volume.
* **A: Maal uthaane se pehle jahaaz toota tha:** The passage says the ship was going to get supplies *before* it broke. This is true.
* **C: Chaalak dull ke baarah sadso me se sirf ke chot lagi thi:** The passage explicitly states that 12 out of 14 members of the Chaalak Dull tribe were saved, and only one had a broken nose. This is true.
* **D: Jahaaz ko baandh me dhakela gaya tha:** The passage says strong winds and waves pushed the ship into a reef. This is true.

Therefore, only option B is not supported by the information provided in the passage.
"
Algeria ne kis dashak mein swatantra haseel ki?,"The correct answer is **C: 1960**.

The text states, ""1960 ke dashak mein film nirdeshan sikhaane ke liye wah naye swatantra hue algeria vaapas aa gaye."" (In the 1960s, he returned to newly independent Algeria to teach film directing.)
"
Kahan antim sanskar ke liye television screen nhi lagaye gye the?,"The correct answer is **D: St. Peter Square mein (In St. Peter's Square)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Cent Peters Square mein antim sanskar ke liye har kisi ke liye pahunch panna mumkin nahin tha"" (It was not possible for everyone to get access for the last rites in St. Peter's Square).  It then goes on to say that screens were set up *everywhere else* to allow people to watch.

Therefore, screens were *not* set up in St. Peter's Square.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pure Rome mein (Throughout Rome):** The passage explicitly says screens were placed in *various* locations throughout Rome.
* **B: Kayi sari Italian shaharon mein (In many Italian cities):** The passage mentions screens were set up in other Italian cities.
* **C: Poland ki kayi jagahaon mein (In many places in Poland):** The passage explicitly states screens were set up in Poland.



"
Antim sanskar kahan hua tha?,"The best answer is **A: Rome ki alag-alag jagahon mein (In different places in Rome)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Rome mein alag-alag jagahon par kayee badey television screen lagaae gaye taaki log samaroh dekh sakein."" (In Rome, many large television screens were installed in different places so that people could watch the ceremony.)
* While St. Peter's Square is mentioned as the place where access was impossible for everyone, the ceremony wasn't *only* there.  It was broadcast in various locations across Rome.
* Poland and other Italian cities had setups *to watch* the event, but the actual *Antim Sanskar* (final rites) took place in Rome.

Therefore, option A is the most accurate and complete answer based on the provided text.
"
"Visfot ke baad, gambhir roop se ghayal ke taur par kiska ilaaj kiya gaya?","The correct answer is **A: Kam se kam paanch logo ka** (At least five people).

The text states: ""Jab adhikari pahunche toh apartment mein visfot ho gaya. Koi gambhir roop se ghayal nahin hua. Lekin dhamaake ke samay maujood kam se kam paanch logon ko sadma lagaa, unka ilaaj kiya jaa raha tha."" This translates to ""When the officer arrived, the apartment exploded. No one was seriously injured. But at the time of the explosion, at least five people were present and received medical attention.""
"
Gas risaav ki report kisne ki?,"The correct answer is **A: Building mein ek padosi ne (A neighbor in the building)**.

The text states: ""Gas company ke ek adhikari ne padosi dwara kiye gaye gas leak ke phone ke chalte jagah ka dora kiya."" This translates to: ""A gas company official conducted a site visit after receiving a phone call from a neighbor regarding a gas leak."" Therefore, the neighbor reported the gas leak.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, hamle mein kitne log maare gaye?","Passage ke hisaab se, hamle mein **2** log maare gaye. Passage mein kaha gaya hai ki ""unka ka hathiyar tab vifal ho gaya jab paanchven vyakti ke sir par nishana lagaya,"" jisse pata chalta hai ki paanchvin vyakti maara gaya tha. Passage mein, Nicholaus Eldon, Zachary Cuddeback, Edger Veguilla aur Kristofferr Schneider zakhmi hain. Isliye, maare gaye logon ki sankhya **2** hai.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: 2**.
"
Hamle ke dauraan ek mauke par kiska hathiyaar fire nahi kar paya?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Una**।

प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि ""Unka ka hathiyar tab vifal ho gaya jab paanchven vyakti ke sir par nishana lagaya."" इसका मतलब है कि 'Un' (जो कि क्रिस्टोफर श्नाइडर हैं) का हथियार बेकार हो गया। बाकी लोगों (Cuddeback, Schneider, Alden) के बारे में हथियार के बेकार होने का कोई उल्लेख नहीं है।

इसलिए, सही उत्तर 'Una' (क्रिस्टोफर श्नाइडर) है।"
Kaunse khel ko olympic karyakram se bahar kar diya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Baseball**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Baseball aur Softball ne olympic karyakram mein jagah banaane ka prayaas kiya...jinhen (baseball aur softball) 2005 mein olympic khelo se baahar kar diya gaya tha."" (Baseball and Softball tried to make a place in the Olympic program...which were expelled from the Olympic games in 2005.)

Therefore, Baseball is the correct answer.
"
Antarrashtriya Olympic Committee ne kis khel ko khelo mein shamil karne ke liye matdan kiya?,"सही उत्तर है: **C: Rugby union**

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""Rugby khaas taur par rugby union aur golf ko olympic mein bhaag lene ke liye paanch khelo mein se chuna gaya."" (रग्बी विशेष रूप से रग्बी यूनियन और गोल्फ को ओलंपिक में भाग लेने के लिए पांच खेलों में से चुना गया।)

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

* **A: Rollersports** - पाठ में Rollersports का उल्लेख नहीं है।
* **B: Baseball** - पाठ में Baseball का उल्लेख है, लेकिन यह विकल्प सबसे विशिष्ट नहीं है क्योंकि Rugby Union को भी चुना गया था।
* **D: Softball** -  पाठ में Softball का उल्लेख है, लेकिन यह विकल्प सबसे विशिष्ट नहीं है क्योंकि Rugby Union को भी चुना गया था।"
Arthur Guinness ne Saint James' Gate Brewery ko kitne saalo ke liye lease par diya?,"The correct answer is **D: 9000**.

The text states: ""24 september, 1759 ko, Arthur Guinness Dublin, Ireland mein Saint James' Gate Brewery ke liye **9,000 saal** ke lease par hastakshar kiye."" (On September 24, 1759, Arthur Guinness signed a 9,000-year lease for the Saint James' Gate Brewery in Dublin, Ireland.)

While the business became a global enterprise 250 years later, the question specifically asks about the *length of the lease*.
"
Guinness har saal kitne billion dollars kamata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: 14**.

The text states that Guinness earns *more than* 10 billion American dollars per year, and the option that best reflects the number mentioned is 14.
"
European sangh ke kitne desho mein H5N1 virus ki pushti ki gayi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Saat**.

The passage explicitly states: ""France European sangh ka saatvaan desh hai, jo is virus ki maar jhel rahaa hai."" (France is the seventh European Union country to suffer from this virus.)
"
H5N1 virus ka sabse naya mamla kahan paya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: France**.

The passage explicitly states: ""H5N1, manushyon ko bird flue ke ghaatak hone ki pushti ki gayi hai, jo somwar ko France ke poorv mein Lyon ke paas daldali bhoomi mein paya gaya hai."" This translates to ""H5N1, the deadly bird flu has been confirmed in humans, which was found on Monday in marshland near Lyon in eastern France.""
"
shanti sainikon ke karan phailane se pehle Haiti ka is bimari se aakhiri bar samna kab hua tha?,"The correct answer is **A: 1800 ke dashak mein (In the 1800s)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Tukadiyon ke pahunchane se pehle, 1800 ke dashak se haiti ka kabhi-bhi beemariyon se judi samasyaon se saamana nahin hua tha."" (Before the debris arrived, Haiti had never faced disease-related problems since the 1800s.)



"
Kis jagah ke kachare ne bimari ko badhne me yogdaan dia?,"The correct answer is **A: Artibonite nadi**.

The passage states that waste from the UN camps was not properly disposed of, allowing bacteria to enter the Artibonite River and its tributaries.
"
Irish sarkar kya karne ki yojana bana rahi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Davayion ki anumati dene par adhik kathor kaanoon laagoo karne ki** (Implementing stricter laws on drug legalization).

Here's why:

* The passage states the Irish government is emphasizing the necessity of **legislative laws** to improve the situation.
* The government spokesperson mentions the importance of the law for **public health and criminal justice**. This implies stricter controls and potential penalties related to drug use and trafficking.
* The Health Minister expresses concern for the well-being of those benefiting from temporary legalizations and the long-term impact of temporary unconstitutional changes on drug-related perceptions. This indicates a move towards stricter regulations and a cautious approach to drug policies.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nashili Davayion ke aparaadhiyon ko saza sunane ki** (Punishing drug criminals): While this is a possible outcome of stricter laws, the passage focuses on *new laws* and the broader implications, not just punishment.
* **C: Davayion ke kanoon me dheel dene ki** (Loosening drug laws): The passage implies the opposite - moving towards *stricter* laws.
* **D: Davayion ko apradh mukht karne ki** (Making drugs crime-free): This is directly contradicted by the language in the passage which stresses the need for laws and regulations.



"
Ireland mein asthaayee roop se kya vaidh tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Dawaiyan (Medicines)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...dawai se judi dhaaranaon ko age ki peedhi ke liye saunp diya"" which translates to ""...the concept related to medicines was entrusted to the next generation.""  This implies that temporary legality was granted to medicines.  The context of improving the state of the government and public health further supports this.
"
Sandigdh aparadhi se poochtach kis liye ke jaati hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Atikraman ke lie (For assault)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Los Angeles police vibhaag ke ek pravakta Christopher Garcia ne kahaa ki sandigdh purush aparadhi ki gundagiri ke bajaay **atikraman ke liye jaanch ke jaa rahi hai**."" This translates to: ""A spokesperson for the Los Angeles police department, Christopher Garcia, said that the suspicious man is being investigated **for assault, not for robbery**.""
"
"Sanket me badlav karte samay, sandigdh ko kya nahi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Uske kisi akshar me badlav nahi karna chahiye** (He should not change any of its letters).

Here's why:

The passage states that the investigation was conducted by changing the letter ""O"" to ""E"" using a black tarp decorated with peace and heart symbols.  Therefore, the suspect should *not* change any of the letters.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Shanti chinh se sajana chahiye** (He should be decorated with peace symbols): The passage *does* say it was decorated with peace symbols. This isn't what the question is asking.
* **C: shaaririk roop se kshatigrast karna chahiye** (He should be physically injured): This is explicitly stated as *not* happening in the passage.
* **D: Tirpal istemal karke sansodhit kiya jana chahiye** (He should be investigated by using a tarp): The passage describes the *method* of investigation (using the tarp), not a requirement for the suspect's actions.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, angreji ke tutor Karno par inmein se kaunsa aarop nahin tha?","The correct answer is **B: Ek chhatra ke sath dating**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions that a former student claimed Karno taught dating skills and acted like a ""friend"" to students. This implies *potential* dating involvement, but it's not a direct accusation of dating a *student*.
* The passage states Karno was accused of unauthorized advertising.
* The passage mentions Karno's notes contained language considered offensive by parents and that he used inappropriate language in class.
* The passage mentions Karno was previously accused of copyright infringement.

Therefore, while the passage alludes to potentially inappropriate relationships with students through the statement about teaching dating skills, it doesn't explicitly accuse him of dating a student.  The other options are directly mentioned as accusations."
"Passage ke hisab se, Rolando Mendoza ne kise apna bandhak nahi banaya?","सही उत्तर है **B: Policewalo ko**।

पाठ के अनुसार, Rolando Mendoza ने पर्यटकों को बंधक बनाया, लेकिन पुलिसकर्मियों को नहीं। यह जानकारी सीधे पाठ में दी गई है। अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि Mendoza ने बच्चों, पर्यटकों और फोटोग्राफरों को बंधक बनाया था।"
"Passage ke hisaab se, kin bandhako ko jaldi chhodne ki chhodne ki pushti nahi ki gayi?","The correct answer is **A: Paryatakon (Tourists)**.

The passage states that ""Bachchon aur bujurgon sahit chhah bandhakon ko jaldi chhod diya gaya, aur filipino photographers ko bhi."" This means children, elders, and photographers were released.  Tourists are mentioned as being held hostage but are not explicitly stated to have been released. Therefore, the passage doesn't confirm their release.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Brazil mein samlaingik vivaah ko vaidh banaane ke support mein kaun hastakshar ekatra kar raha hai?","The correct answer is **A: Pradarshankari**.

The passage states: ""Pradarshankariyon ko aashaa hai ki wo november mein rashtriya congress ke samne prastut karne ke liye 12 lakh hastakshar ekatra karke ek yachika bana lenge."" This translates to ""Demonstrators hope to collect 1.2 million signatures to create a petition to present to the National Congress in November."" Therefore, demonstrators are collecting signatures to support same-sex marriage.
"
Pradarshankari apni yachika kise denge?,"The correct answer is **C: Brazil ki rashtriya congress**.

The passage states: ""Pradarshankariyon ko aashaa hai ki wo november mein rashtriya congress ke samne prastut karne ke liye 12 lakh hastakshar ekatra karke ek yachika bana lenge."" This directly translates to ""Demonstrators hope to gather 1.2 million signatures to create a petition to present in front of the national congress in November.""
"
"Armand Versace ke hisaab se, bhid dwara mausam par pratikriya dene se thik pehle kya hua tha?","The correct answer is **C: Tez hawa chal rahi thi**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Pradarshan chalu hone ke paanch minute mein hawa shuru ho jaati hai, lagbhag ek minute baad, hawa 70 kilometer/ghanta tak pahunch rahi hai... phir barish aati hai, lekin itni tez aur itni badi booden ki yah aapaki twacha ko sui ke tarah chubhati hai, phir akash se ole girte hain...""

This clearly indicates that strong winds occurred *before* the rain and hail, and *before* the hailstones fell.  Therefore, strong winds were the event that happened immediately after the demonstration started and before the hailstones.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Ole girne lage:**  The passage states that hailstones fell *after* the rain.
*   **B: Pradarshan paanch minute deri se hua:** The passage says the wind started 5 minutes *after* the demonstration began.
*   **D: Usne family ke ek member ko kho diya:** This is an event that happened *during* the chaos, not *before* the reaction to the weather.



"
"Versace ke hisaab se, sabse tez hawaein kab shuru hui?","The correct answer is **A: Pradarshan chalu hone ke kuch mintue baad**.

The passage states: ""Pradarshan chalu hone ke paanch minute mein hawa shuru ho jaati hai, lagbhag ek minute baad, hawa 70 kilometer/ghanta tak pahunch rahi hai..."" This directly indicates that the strong winds started about five minutes after the demonstration began. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **B: Barish ke baad:** The passage says the wind started before the rain.
*   **C: Apni behen ko khone ke baad:** This is a tragic event, but the passage doesn't link it to the start of the strong winds.
*   **D: Ole girne se phele:** The passage says the winds started before the hail.



"
Fred se phele 35°W ke poorv mein kitne bade toofan record kiye gaye hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Teen**.

The passage states: ""...and 35°W के पूर्व में केवल तीसरा प्रमुख तूफ़ान रिकॉर्ड है।"" which translates to ""...and only the third major storm has been recorded at 35°W east."" Therefore, three major storms have been recorded at that location.
"
"Jab Fred, Cape verde dveepon ke paas aaya tha, to vah kis disha ki or badh raha tha?","The correct answer is **D: Uttar-paschim (Northwest)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""is samay fried **105 mile prati ghante (165 kilo meter prati ghanta) ki hawa ke gati se uttar-paschim ki or badh raha hai**.""  This translates to ""at this time Fred was moving at a speed of 105 miles per hour (165 kilometers per hour) **northwest**.""
"
Inmein se kiski gati apne poorvavartiyon ki tulana mein tez hai?,"The correct answer is **A: 802.11n**.

The text explicitly states: ""600 megabit/second ke adhikatam theoretical throughput ke saath 802.11n ke gati apne pehle vaale chalakon se ullekhaniya roop se bahut tez hai.""  This translates to ""With a maximum theoretical throughput of 600 megabit/second, the speed of 802.11n is significantly faster than its predecessors.""
"
802.11n ko 802.11b ke sath sangat karne ke lie kya chiz jaruri hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Dual radio**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""yah ise 802.11a, 802.11b aur 802.11g ke saath peechhe ki or sangat karne ke anumati dega, basharte ki bases station mein dohare radio hone."" This directly translates to: ""it will allow it to backward-compatible with 802.11a, 802.11b and 802.11g, **provided that the base station has dual radios**.""

Therefore, dual radio capability on the base station is the requirement for 802.11n to work with older standards like 802.11b.
"
Olympic swarna padak vijeta ko rashtramandal khelon mein kitani spardhaon mein bhaag lena tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Paanch**.

The question states the athlete was supposed to participate in:

* 100 meter freestyle
* 200 meter freestyle
* Three relay races

That's a total of 1 + 1 + 3 = 5 competitions.
"
Olympic swarna padak vijeta apne dard ki davaa kyon nahi le raha tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Rashtramandal khelon mein ise lene ki anumati nhi thi (He wasn't allowed to take it in national games).**

Here's why:

The question states that the swimmer couldn't take the necessary medication because it was **prohibited in sports**. Option D directly reflects this reason.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Use koi dard nahi hua (He didn't have any pain):** The passage explicitly mentions he was experiencing pain (""dard ko door karne ke liye"").
*   **B: Isse uski tabiyat kharab ho gai (His health got worse):** While the medication might have impacted his health, the passage doesn't state that this was the direct reason he couldn't take it. The prohibition in sports is the key point.
*   **C: Use chinta thi iska uski sehat par bura prabhav padega (He was worried it would negatively affect his health):** While worry *could* be a factor, the passage focuses on the *prohibition* of the medication in competition, not just his concern about potential side effects.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, bhookamp gatividhi ke baare mein bhram ki sambhavana kya ho sakti hain?","The correct answer is **A: kale baadlon ka maujood hona (the presence of dark clouds)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Baadlon se bhram ke sambhavana paida hui, ki vakai mein visfot hua tha."" This translates to ""The clouds created a possibility of illusion, that in fact, an explosion had occurred."" Therefore, the dark clouds led to the illusion of an eruption, which is related to the possibility of a seismic event.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, phase me badlav kab hota hai?","Correct answer is **C: 10 March ko**.

The passage states: ""Tez bhookamp gatividhi ke parinamswarup isthiti parivartan 10 march ko jwalamukhi ke shikhar caldera ke uttar-poorv ki or hua tha."" (Strong earthquake activity resulted in a change in the state near the volcano's summit caldera on March 10th.)

Therefore, the phase change happened on March 10th.
"
Chandrayaan-1 ki lunar probe ke baare mein inmein se kaun sa kathan satya nahin hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Orbiter ko launch karne vale probe mein ek crew tha (The probe that launched the orbiter had a crew)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Maanav rahit lunar orbit chandrayan -1 ne apne moon impact probe (mips) ko chhod diya..."" which translates to ""The uncrewed lunar orbit Chandrayaan-1 released its moon impact probe (MIP)..."" This means there was no crew on the probe itself.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **B: Probe me zaruri instrument the (The probe had essential instruments):** The passage mentions ""Teen mahatvapurn vaigyaanik upkaranon ko le jaane ke alawa..."" meaning ""Besides carrying three important scientific instruments...""
* **C: Probe ke ejection safaltapoorvak hua (The probe's ejection was successful):**  The passage states the probe ""safaltapurvak chand ke dakshini dhruv par utra tha"" meaning ""successfully landed on the south pole of the moon"".  The implication is that it successfully detached from the Chandrayaan-1 orbiter.
* **D: Probe ki sides me paint hua tha (The probe had paint on its sides):** The passage says ""...lunar probe ke saath bhartiya rashtriya dhwaj bhi tha jo ki sabhi aur chitrit tha"" which means ""...along with the lunar probe was the Indian national flag which was painted on all sides.""



Therefore, the only false statement is that the probe itself had a crew.
"
Inmein se kaunsa kathan lunar probe ko satik roop se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Uski crash landing safal rahi** (Its crash landing was successful).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...aur safaltapurvak chand ke dakshini dhruv par utra tha"" which translates to ""...and successfully landed on the southern pole of the moon.""  This confirms a successful crash landing.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Vah Chandrama ki uttari dhruv ke pass utra tha** (It landed near the northern pole of the moon) - The passage clearly states it landed on the *southern* pole.
* **C: Maanav rahit lunar orbit ko bahar nikala tha** (The unmanned lunar orbit was launched) - While the mission *involved* a lunar orbit, the question asks about the *probe*. The passage mentions the probe being released and its impact.  It doesn't say the orbit itself was launched.
* **D: Isme do mahatvapurn upkaran the** (It had two important instruments in it) - The passage states it carried *three* important scientific instruments.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, bimari se bachav ka kaunsa upaay sabse aakhir mein kiya jaega?","The correct answer is **C: Encephalitis vaccine**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sarkarne encephalitis vaccine ke kayee million vial ka vaadaa kiya hai, jo agle saal swaasthya agencies ko taiyar karne mein madad karega.""  This indicates that the vaccine is promised for *next* year, implying it's the last measure being planned or implemented among the options.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Keetnashakon ka istemal (Insecticide use):** The passage mentions ""keetnashakon ke chhidkav jaise upaay"" (insecticide spraying) as something Prakop forced the government to do. It's already being implemented.
* **B: Suar pakadane vaale (Pig catchers):** The passage mentions deploying pig catchers, but it's presented as one of the actions the government *was forced* to take.
* **D: Machhardani (Moth/mosquito breeding control):** The passage mentions distributing thousands of mosquito breeding control units.  This is also an action already being implemented.



"
Bimari manushyon mein kaise aati hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Machharon se (From mosquitoes)**.

The passage states: ""yah bimari suaron ke karan hoti hai, jo baad mein machharon ke madhyam se manushyon mein aati hai."" which translates to ""This disease is caused by pigs, which later spreads to humans through mosquitoes.""
"
Dusri saza ki viphalata ke kya parinaam ho sakata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: HJR-3 ki fir se samiksha ki jaayegi**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""is prakriya ka paalan karte hue, HJR-3 ke prakriya mein bane rahne ke liye 2015 yaa 2016 mein agle nirvaachit vidhansabha dwara phir se sameeksha ke jaayegi."" This directly translates to ""Following this process, HJR-3's process will be reviewed again by the next elected legislature in 2015 or 2016 to remain within the process.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: samlingi naagarik sanghon ka bhavishy ka adhikaar (Future rights of same-sex citizens' unions):** While the passage *implies* potential future rights, it doesn't explicitly state that the failure of the second bill *will* lead to them. The passage discusses the possibility, not a guaranteed outcome.
* **C: apatkalin legislative session (Emergency legislative session):** The text doesn't mention anything about an emergency legislative session.
* **D: samlaingik naagarik sanghon ki manahi (Rejection of same-sex citizens' unions):** The text doesn't state that the second bill's failure will *reject* same-sex unions; it merely indicates a pause and potential future review.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, doosri saza ko kab hataya gaya?","The correct answer is **A: legislative session ke dauraan**.

The passage states: ""is legislative session mein tab badlav hue jab doosri saza pehle house of representatives dwara khatm kar dee gayee aur phir somwar ko senate ne use roop mein paas kiya."" (Changes occurred during this legislative session when the second bill was passed by the House of Representatives and then passed by the Senate on Monday.) This indicates the second bill was removed during the current legislative session. Option A is the most accurate.
"
“Panama Papers” kiske liye leak hue the?,"The correct answer is **B: Press**.

The passage states: ""Panama papers panama ke kanooni firm Mossack Fonseca lagbhag dus million dastavejon ke liye ek shabd yugm hai jise sun **2016 ke vasant mein press ko leak kar diya gaya tha**...""  This directly indicates that the documents were leaked to the press.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, British akhbar ne daava kiya tha ki dhan chhupaane ke lie istemaal ki jane vali kai comaniyon ka prabandhan kaun kar raha tha?","The correct answer is **C: Deutsche Bank**.

The passage states: ""British akhbar The Guardian ke anusaar duetsche bank ne ise pura karne ke liye istemal ki jaane waali 1200 shell companiyon mein se ek tihai ko mote taur par niyantrit kiya.""  (According to the British newspaper The Guardian, Deutsche Bank largely controlled a third of the 1200 shell companies used to do this.)
"
Inmein se kis vimaan durghatana mein sabase adhik mauten huin?,"The correct answer is **C: Armenia se Iran ja rahe plane crash mein**.

The passage states: ""Pichle mahine iran mein kayi varshow baad ek behad kharab hawai hadsa hua, jab **armenia jaa rahaa ek vimaan durghatnagrast ho gaya tha, jis par savaar 168 logon ki maut ho gayee**."" This translates to ""Last month, after many incidents, a very bad air accident occurred in Iran, when **a plane traveling from Armenia crashed, resulting in the death of 168 people**.""

Option C accurately reflects this information. The other options state incorrect death tolls.
"
Iran mein hone vali anek hawai durghatanaon ka inmein se kaunsa karan nahin hai?,"सही जवाब है **B: Naye vimaan khareedane ke liye budget ki**

विकल्प A, C और D सभी लेख में उल्लिखित कारणों से मेल खाते हैं। लेख स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि:

*   Iran में पुराने विमान हैं जिन्हें ठीक से रखरखाव नहीं किया गया है।
*   अंतर्राष्ट्रीय प्रतिबंध नए विमान खरीदने से रोकते हैं।
*   हवाई दुर्घटनाओं का एक सामान्य कारण विमानों का खराब रखरखाव है।

लेख में बजट के बारे में कोई उल्लेख नहीं है। इसलिए, यह विकल्प सही उत्तर है क्योंकि यह लेख में उल्लिखित कारणों में से नहीं है।"
Inmein se kya Iraq adhyayan samooh ki report mein shaamil nahin tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ek ghoshana ki kuchh badlavon ke sath iraq mein badhti hinsa se bacha ja sakata hai**.

Here's why:

* The report explicitly states that there is **no guarantee** that any action will stop sectarian war, increased violence, or instability in Iraq. This directly contradicts option B, which suggests a guarantee of preventing increased violence with some changes.

The other options are all mentioned in the text:

* **A: Vartamaan neeti ki aalochana:** The report is described as ""behad aalochanatmak"" (highly critical) of the current administration's policy.
* **C: Iraq ki seemaon ko surakshit karne ki sifaarishen:**  The first recommendation is to secure Iraq's borders.
* **D: America ki sehmati banane ke liye ek yachika:** The report opens with a petition to create common ground on the Middle East and foreign policy in the US.



"
Iraq adhyayan samooh ne apni report mein inmein se kiska aagrah nahin kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Badhti hinsa ko rokane ki gaurantee vali ghoshna ne**.

Here's why:

* The report explicitly states that *no one can guarantee* that any action in Iraq will stop sectarian war, increased violence, or instability. Therefore, the report wouldn't advocate for making such a guarantee.
* The report strongly criticizes the current US policy in Iraq and calls for immediate change.
* The report advocates for open discussion and a unified approach to Middle East policy within the US.
* The report's first recommendation is to initiate a new diplomatic initiative to secure Iraq's borders and rebuild relationships with neighbors.

Therefore, option A is the only one that contradicts the information provided in the question."
"Police ke hisaab se, Provenzano ka dahina haath kise mana jata hai?","The correct answer is **B: Lo Piccolo**.

The text states: ""Police ne kahaa ki lo piccolo ki sthiti maboot thi kyonki wah palermo mein provenzano ka dahina haath tha..."" which translates to ""Police said that Lo Piccolo's position was strong because he was Provenzano's right-hand man in Palermo...""
"
"Passage mai di gai jaankari ke hisaab se, Falcone ki maut ki kya vajah thi?","The correct answer is **A: Reena-dwara sanchaalit yuddh ke dauraan mara gaya tha (He was killed during the war led by Reena)**.

The passage states: "" mafia yoddha Giovanni Falcone aur Paolo Borsellino ki jaan chali gayi thi jismein 1992 mein rajya ke viruddh reena-dwara sanchaalit yuddh ko samaapt kiya gaya tha"" (mafia soldier Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino died in the war led by Reena which ended in 1992 against the state).
"
Inmein se kaun Hitoshi Saito ki prashansaon mein se ek nahin hai?,"सही जवाब है: **C: Do baar ke olympic gold medals ke vijeta**

यहां कारण दिया गया है:

प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि Hitoshi Saito ने ओलंपिक गोल्ड मेडल नहीं जीते थे। वे ओलंपिक और वर्ल्ड चैंपियन थे, लेकिन गोल्ड मेडल विजेता नहीं थे।

अन्य विकल्प सही हैं:

* **A: Do baar ke world Champion** - प्रश्न में उल्लेख किया गया है कि वह दो बार के विश्व चैंपियन थे।
* **B: All Japan judo federation ke adhyaksh** - प्रश्न में उल्लेख किया गया है कि वह ऑल जापान जुडो फेडरेशन ट्रेनिंग कमेटी के अध्यक्ष थे।
* **D: Judo expert** - यह जानकारी प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से नहीं दी गई है, लेकिन यह माना जा सकता है कि दो बार के ओलंपिक और विश्व चैंपियन होने के नाते वह जुडो विशेषज्ञ थे।

इसलिए, केवल विकल्प C गलत है।"
Iwasaki pratigya lene se bachane mein kahan safal rahi?,"The passage states that Iwasaki ran away from a wedding in Nepal. It doesn't mention anything about him successfully avoiding a vow (pratigya) in any of the listed locations. Therefore, the question is flawed based on the provided text.

However, if we *assume* the question is asking where he *ran away from* a situation, then the answer would be **B: Nepal**.

But again, based *solely* on the text, there's no information to support any of the options related to avoiding a vow.

**Therefore, the best answer, given the flawed question, is B.** However, it's important to note the question is not fully answered by the passage.
"
Iwasaki par kisne attack kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Samudri daakuon ne** (Pirates).

The question asks who attacked Iwasaki, and the passage states: ""Use samudri daakuonne lootaa tha"" which translates to ""He was looted by pirates.""
"
Alonso ne apni race kab samaapt kari?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Alonso ne apni race kab samaapt kari? Schumacher ke samne wala pahiya toot jaane par**।

प्रश्न पूछता है कि Alonso ने अपनी दौड़ कब समाप्त की। दिए गए पाठ के अनुसार, Alonso ने अपनी दौड़ तब समाप्त की जब सामने का पहिया बुरी तरह से फट गया था।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:
* **B:** Fisichella का नियंत्रण खोना Alonso की दौड़ को प्रभावित करता है, लेकिन Alonso की दौड़ को समाप्त नहीं करता।
* **C:** Schumacher की दौड़ को समाप्त होने का कारण Alonso का होना नहीं था।
* **D:** Alonso ने दौड़ शुरू करने से पहले दौड़ को समाप्त नहीं किया।"
Schumacher ka apni race jaldi samaapt karne ka kya karan tha?,"सही जवाब है **D: Car ke suspension ko kshati pahunchi thi**।

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से लिखा है कि Michael Schumacher की रेस कई टकरावों के कारण उनके कार के सस्पेंशन को नुकसान पहुंचा था, जिसके चलते उन्हें जल्दी रेस खत्म करनी पड़ी।

अन्य विकल्प सही नहीं हैं क्योंकि:

* **A: Usne apni car par niyantran kho diya:** यह विकल्प गलत है क्योंकि पाठ में कहा गया है कि Fisichella ने नियंत्रण खोया था।
* **B: Alonso se takkar ho gai:** पाठ में Alonso के साथ टक्कर का उल्लेख नहीं है।
* **C: Fisichella ki vajah se pahiya toot gaya:** यह विकल्प आंशिक रूप से सही है, लेकिन यह Schumacher के रेस खत्म होने का मुख्य कारण नहीं है।  कार के सस्पेंशन को नुकसान पहुंचने से ही रेस खत्म हुई।
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, giraftar logon ke liye jamanat karne ka kaam kiska hai?","The correct answer is **D: Court ke commissioner ka**.

The passage states: ""Aayukt jamaanat pradaan karta hai,"" which translates to ""The Commissioner provides bail."" The passage also mentions the Commissioner being involved in cases where people are detained for more than 24 hours without appearing before the court commissioner. Therefore, the Court Commissioner is responsible for granting bail.
"
"Passage mein ullikhit asthayi nirodhak aadesh ke hisab se, giraftar kie gaye logon ko 24 ghante se adhik samay tak hirasat mein rakhne ke lie kya anumati di jani chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Jamanat (Bail)**.

The passage states: ""isamen aise logon ko zabardasti 24 ghanton se zyada rakhane par pabandi hai jo jail mein aane ke baad nyayalaya commissioner ke samne pesh nahin kiye gaye. **Aaropon ko aupchaarik roop aur anumati dee jaati hai, tab aayukt jamaanat pradaan karta hai.**""

This directly translates to: ""This includes a ban on forcibly holding such people for more than 24 hours who have not been presented before the court commissioner after coming to the jail. **If the charges are officially accepted and approved, then the commissioner grants bail.**""

Therefore, bail is the authorization needed to hold arrested individuals for more than 24 hours, according to the temporary restraining order.
"
Passage ke anusaar naa bhaagne ki kaun si vajah nhi di gayi thi?,"The correct answer is **B: Samvidhaan ka virodhabhas (Contradiction with the Constitution)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that officials decided not to run due to:

*   **Adhikariyon ne dusre chunaav ke kharch aur suraksha jokim ko bachaane ke liye (To save the expenses of another election and security risks).** - This refers to both cost and security risks.
*   **Rajnitiyon ne kahaa ki unhone nirnaayak matt ko anaavashyak roop se nirdhaarit karne ke liye afghan samvidhaan mein kafi aspashtata paayi thi. (Politicians said they found sufficient ambiguity in the Afghan Constitution to unnecessarily determine the decisive vote.)** - This highlights the ambiguity in the constitution as a reason.

The passage **contradicts** the earlier reports that said rejecting the decisive vote would be unconstitutional. Therefore, it doesn't present the argument that it would contradict the constitution as a reason for not running.

Options A (Suraksha jokim), C (Zyada kharch) and D (Samvidhaan mein kafi aspashtata) are all reasons mentioned in the passage."
Raajnitigyon ne kyu bhaagne ko anavashayak tehraya?,"The correct answer is **C: Samvidhaan mein aspashtata thi (There was ambiguity in the constitution)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Raajnitigyon ne kahaa ki unhone nirnaayak matt ko anaavashyak roop se nirdhaarit karne ke liye afghan samvidhaan mein kafi aspashtata paayi thi.""  This translates to ""Politicians said that they found sufficient ambiguity in the Afghan constitution to unnecessarily determine the decisive vote.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yah samvidhaan ke viroddh gya (It went against the constitution):** The passage says the ambiguity was used *to* avoid a decisive vote, not that avoiding it was against the constitution.
* **B: Surakhsha jokhim tha (There was a security risk):** While security risks might have been a factor in the overall decision, the passage doesn't directly state that *that* is why politicians found the decisive vote unnecessary.
* **D: Chunaav bahut jyada kharcila tha (The election was very expensive):** The passage mentions election costs, but doesn't connect it directly to the politicians' reasoning about the decisive vote.



"
FATA ko nyaayik sevaayen kaun pradaan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Raajneetik agents**.

The passage explicitly states: ""ye agent pakistani samvidhaan ke anuchhed 247 ke tahat sarkar aur nyaayik sevaayen pradaan karne ke liye zimmedaar hain."" (These agents are responsible for providing government and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani Constitution.)
"
"""FATA ke """"raajneetik agents"""" ke baare mein niche diye gaye kathano mein se kaun sa sahi nhi hai?""","The question asks which statement about the ""political agents"" in FATA is *incorrect*. Let's break down each statement based on the provided text:

* **A: Ve nyaayik sevaayen pradaan karte hain (They provide judicial services)** - The text explicitly states this: ""...Pakistani samvidhaan ke anuchhed 247 ke tahat sarkar aur nyaayik sevaayen pradaan karne ke liye zimmedaar hain."" ( ...they are responsible for providing government and judicial services under Article 247 of the Pakistani constitution.)  So, this statement is **correct**.

* **B: Ve Pakistani rashtrapati dware chune gye the (They were chosen by the Pakistani President)** - The text states: ""1947 mein british raj se pakistan ke azadi paane ke samay se hi kshetron par lagbhag pura swashasi niyantran karne waale FATA par shasan karne liye pakistani rashtrapati ne """"raajneetik agents"""" niyukt kiye hain."" (Since the time of Pakistan gaining independence from the British Raj in 1947, the Pakistani President has appointed ""political agents"" to govern the areas with almost complete administrative control over FATA.)  So, this statement is **correct**.

* **C: Ve Pakistan ke samvidhaan ka paalan karte hain (They uphold the constitution of Pakistan)** - While not explicitly stated as their *sole* duty, the fact that they provide government and judicial services *under the Pakistani constitution* implies they are responsible for upholding it. This is a reasonable inference and likely **correct**.

* **D: Unka kuch khaas area par pura niyantran hai (They have complete control over a certain area)** - The text says they were appointed to ""govern the areas with almost complete administrative control over FATA."" This implies they have a significant level of control over a specific area (FATA). So, this statement is **correct**.

Looking back at the question, we need to find the *incorrect* statement. It seems that options A, B, C and D are correct. However, **option D ""Unka kuch khaas area par pura niyantran hai"" is the most potentially misleading and possibly incorrect statement.** While the political agents have significant control, the text says ""almost complete administrative control"". It doesn't say they have *complete* control.

Therefore, the best answer is **D: Unka kuch khaas area par pura niyantran hai.**
"
Emma Stone ka namankan kis award ke liye hua tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Sarvshreshth sah-abhinetri (Best Actress)**.

The text states: ""Gosling aur stone ko kramshah sarvshreshth abhineta aur abhinetri ke liye namankan mila hai."" which translates to ""Gosling and Stone received nominations for Best Actor and Best Actress.""
"
Kis award ke liye film ka namankan nhi kiya gaya tha?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Sarvshreshth Visual Effects**.

प्रश्न में दिए गए विवरण में सर्वश्रेष्ट विज़ुअल इफ़ेक्ट्स (Sarvshreshth Visual Effects) का उल्लेख नहीं किया गया है। अन्य सभी विकल्प (सर्वश्रेष्ठ फिल्म, सर्वश्रेष्ठ ध्वनि मिश्रण, सर्वश्रेष्ठ मूल गीत) पुरस्कारों की सूची में शामिल हैं।"
Niche diye gaye mein se kaun-sa bhookamp ke bad bhi karyarath tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Ishikawa mein hawai adda**.

Here's why:

* The text states: ""toshikawa praant mein noto hawai adda band hai."" (In Ishikawa prefecture, Noto airport is closed.)
* The text also states: ""iskshetra 9400 ghar paani ki kamee se joojh rahe hai aur lagbhag 100 bijli ke kamee se."" (In this area, 9400 households are struggling with water shortage and approximately 100 have power outages.)  This implies the power plant was *reduced*, not shut down completely.
* The text mentions roads and rail services were damaged, but doesn't say they were permanently shut down.
* The text says reactors 1 and 2 at the Shika plant were shut down due to the earthquake, but doesn't mention all reactors.
* Therefore, the airport in Ishikawa is the only thing explicitly stated as being *closed* after the earthquake.



"
Passage ke anusaar niche diye gaye mein se kaun bhookamp se hue nuksaan ko jhel gaye?,"The correct answer is **B: Shika plant ke do reactor**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""iske shika nuclear power plant ke reactor number 1 aur 2 band kar die gaye the."" (the Shika nuclear power plant's reactor number 1 and 2 were shut down).

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Kuch ghar (Some houses):** While the passage mentions water shortages affecting 9400 houses, it doesn't directly link the damage to the houses *specifically* to the earthquake.
* **C: Kuch sadaken (Some roads):** The passage says roads were damaged, but doesn't state that the damage was *caused* by the earthquake.
* **D: Noto Airport:** The passage mentions the Noto Airport was closed, but it doesn't explicitly state the closure was *due to* the earthquake. While it could be a consequence, the passage doesn't directly attribute it to the earthquake's impact on the plant.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, inmein se kaun si samasya dastaavez mein shaamil nhi hai?","The correct answer is **B: 1967 ke yuddha ki vajah (The cause of the 1967 war)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the document will address the border dispute based on the borders of 1967. 
* It also mentions Jerusalem's future status and the military presence in the Jordan Valley as key issues being discussed.
* However, the *cause* of the 1967 war is not mentioned as a topic included in the document. The document focuses on the consequences and border adjustments *after* the war.



Therefore, option B is the only one that isn't directly or indirectly referenced as being part of the document's scope."
Inmein se kaun si Palestine ki maang mein se nhi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Jordan ghaati mein panch saal ki sainya mauzudgi**

यहाँ कारण दिया गया है:

प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि PA (Palestinian Authority) वर्तमान सैन्य स्थिति को केवल **पांच साल** तक जारी रखने के लिए सहमत है।  जबकि, प्रश्न में यह भी कहा गया है कि इजराइल वर्तमान सैन्य स्थिति को अगले **दस साल** तक बनाए रखना चाहता है।

इसलिए, PA की मांग में **पांच साल** के लिए ही सैन्य उपस्थिति की बात कही गई है।  विकल्प D में ""पांच साल"" का उल्लेख है, लेकिन यह PA की मांग से असंगत है, क्योंकि प्रश्न में PA सिर्फ पांच साल तक सैन्य उपस्थिति को जारी रखने के लिए सहमत है, यह मांग नहीं कर रहा है।

अन्य विकल्प (A, B, और C) सभी PA की मांग के अनुरूप हैं।
"
Ma ne kis desh mein law ki padhayi ki?,"The correct answer is **A: America**.

The text states: ""unhone **new york vishvavidyalaya aur harvard law school mein adhyayan kiya** aur unke paas america ke sthaai nagrikta wala """"green card"""" bhi tha.""  This translates to ""He studied at New York University and Harvard Law School and also had permanent residency in America.""
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Ma ke chunaav ki jeet mein kis desh ka sath tha?","The correct answer is **D: Cheen**.

The passage states: ""in aaropon ke bavjood, maane chini mahadweep ke saath ghanishth sambandhon ke vakalat karte hue ek munch par jeet hassil ki."" which translates to ""despite these accusations, she won on a platform advocating for strong relations with the Chinese mainland.""
"
"Jaisa ki passage mein bataya gaya hai, Carolyn Wilson shehar chodne se pehle kiske liye kaam karte the?","The correct answer is **C: OHA**.

The passage states: ""Jab kiraayedaron ne sajha karna shuru kiya ki unke saath kya hua tha, toh isamen shamil zyaadaatar parivaaron ko achaanak pata chalaa ki OHA ke Carolyn Wilson ne unki suraksha jama raashi chura liye thi aur shehar se bhaag gaya tha."" This clearly indicates that Carolyn Wilson worked for OHA.
"
Season ki chaar race bachi rahne par Drivers championship ke chauthe sthan par kaun hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Hamlin**.

The text states that Hamlin is in third place, and Bowyer is five points ahead of him. Therefore, Hamlin is in fourth place.
"
Passage mein btayi gayi race ke anusaar Drivers ki Championship mein Kahne ko kitne points mile?,"The correct answer is **A: 2220**.

The passage states: ""kahane aur truex, junior kramshah 2,220 aur 2,207 ankon ke saath paanchven aur chhathe asthan par hain."" This directly tells us that Kahne has 2,220 points.
"
Passage ke anusaar kitni baar logon ne ulkapindon ko girte hue dekha jo ki bad mein satyaapit hua ki ve mool roop se mangal se hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Paanch baar**.

The passage states: ""Yah itihas mein paanchvin baar maanaa gaya hai ki logonne dekhaa dharti par geerate hue yuddh samagri ke rasayanik roop se pushti ke gayee hain."" This translates to ""It has been observed in history for the fifth time that people have seen chemical confirmation of meteorite falls on Earth.""
"
Jaisa ki passage mein bataya gaya hai patharon ke bare mein kya shi hai jo ki mool roop se mangal mein mile hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Sabhi july mein hue ulkapat ke dauraan mile hain (All of them were found during the impact in July).**

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Inmein se pandrah chattaanen pichhali july mein hue ulkapat ke daaine hain"" which translates to ""Of these, fifteen rocks were found during the impact in July.""
* Option A reflects this specific information.
* Options B, C, and D are incorrect because:
    * 24,000 is the total number of known meteorites, not the number of Martian meteorites.
    * The price of the rocks is mentioned but not directly related to their origin.
    * 34 is the number of *verified* Martian meteorites, not all the Martian meteorites found in July.



"
Schumacher kab retire hue?,"The correct answer is **B: Apne satve championshit ki jeet ke baad**.

The text explicitly states: ""Schumacher ne saal 2006 mein is khel se sanyas le liya tha."" which translates to ""Schumacher retired from the sport in the year 2006.""

The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A: Felipe massa ke ghayal ho jaane ke baad** -  Schumacher's retirement wasn't *because* of Felipe Massa's injury.
*   **C: Felipe massa ki jagah badlne ke baad** - Schumacher retired *before* taking over Massa's position.
*   **D: 2009 season ke aakhir mein** - The text says he retired in 2006, not at the end of the 2009 season.



"
Massa kab ghayal hue?,"The correct answer is **A: Grand Prix ke dauraan**.

The text states: ""Felipe Massa massa ke ghayal ho jaane ke baad..."" which translates to ""After Felipe Massa got injured..."" and then mentions the accident at the 2009 Hungarian Grand Prix.
"
Passage ke anusaar vyavastha AOL ko kaise prabhavit karegi?,"The correct answer is **C: AOL ke kul upayogkartaon ki sankhya eksath Yahoo aur Microsoft ke upayogkartaon ka saamna karegi.**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yahoo! aur Microsoft sevaaon ke upayogkartaon ke sankhya eksath AOL ke grahakon ke sankhya ka saamana karegi.""  This translates to ""The number of Yahoo! and Microsoft users will face the number of AOL customers.""

This directly means that AOL's total user count will be challenged by the combined user bases of Yahoo! and Microsoft.  Option C accurately reflects this.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: AOL ke upayogkartaon ke sankhya sambhavtah badhegi (AOL's user count will likely increase):** The passage suggests the *opposite* - a challenge to AOL's user base.
* **B: AOL eklauti aise company hogi jo IM market viksit karegi (AOL will be the only company to develop the IM market):** The passage implies competition within the IM market.
* **D: AOL ab america mein upyog nhi kiya jayega (AOL will no longer be used in America):** The passage discusses the future sustainability of AOL in the face of competition, not its immediate disappearance.



"
Inmein se kaun shayad nayi vyavastha ko khatam kar sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Yahoo aur Microsoft ki bhaagidaari (The partnership of Yahoo and Microsoft)**.

Here's why:

The passage argues that AOL's success is due to widespread internet use, but suggests this model isn't sustainable. The core issue is the competition between AOL and Yahoo/Microsoft. A partnership between Yahoo and Microsoft would create a much stronger competitor, capable of challenging AOL's dominance and potentially disrupting the existing market.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: America ke under internet ke apne vyaapak upayog (Widespread internet use in America):**  While widespread internet use is *fueling* the current situation, it doesn't directly *end* the existing system. It's a fundamental condition, not a disruptive force.
* **B: IM market ka upayog (Use of the IM market):** The Instant Messaging (IM) market is mentioned, but it's not presented as a major disruptive force. It's more of a component of the overall online experience.
* **C: AOL ke apni khud ke raftar se market ko age badhaane ki azaadi (AOL's freedom to grow the market at its own pace):** This is the *reason* AOL is doing well now, but it doesn't represent a threat to the existing competitive balance. It's the current state of affairs, not something that would end it.



Therefore, the partnership of Yahoo and Microsoft is the most likely to disrupt the current system and potentially end AOL's dominance.



"
Hamale mein mare gye kitne log police adhikari nhi the?,"The correct answer is **B: 2**.

The question asks how many of the people killed were *not* police officers. The text states that two police officers were killed. Therefore, the answer is 2.
"
Kisne hamle ke liye kathit zimmedaar btaya?,"The correct answer is **A: Police**.

The passage states: ""Police ne kahaa ki unhein hamale ke liye zimmedaar kathit Daesh (ISIL) ladaakon par sandeh hai."" (Police said that they suspect militant Daesh (ISIL) fighters to be responsible for the attack.)
"
Florida mein sabhi rajya ke roop mein vijeta hone ki vajah se Mitt Romney ko sammaanit kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Rajya ke sabhi pratinidhi**.

The passage states: ""Florida ne apne sabhi pachas pratinidhiyon ko Romney ko sammaanit kiye..."" This directly translates to ""Florida honored Romney with all 50 of its representatives...""

Option B (Republican Party ke namankan) is a *result* of the honor, but not the reason for the honor itself. Option A is incorrect as it mentions only 32 representatives. Option D (46 pratishat vote) is the vote percentage Romney received, not the reason for being honored.
"
Passage ke anusaar praathamik chunaav mein Gingrich ko kitne pratishat vote mile?,"The correct answer is **B: 32 pratishat**.

The passage states: ""Newt Gingrich sadan ke poorv american vaktaa 32 pratishat ke saath dusre sthan par aye."" (Newt Gingrich, former House American speaker, came in second place with 32 percent.)
"
Passage ke anusaar caucus ke parinaam ke bad kaun nhi ladai jaari nhi krega?,"The correct answer is **D: Romney**.

Here's why:

* The passage states:
    * **Gingrich** will praise Santorum but criticize Romney.
    * **Perry** initially said he would evaluate the results before deciding his path, but later said he would remain in the race and focus on South Carolina.
    * **Bachmann** decided to end her campaign.
* The passage does *not* mention Romney's future plans. He is only mentioned as the target of Gingrich's criticism.  Therefore, based on the information given, Romney's plans are unknown, and we can't say he *won't* continue the fight.

So, Romney is the only one whose future participation in the race is not mentioned.
"
Passage ke anusaar caucus ke parinaam ke bad kisne dusre pratyashi ki badayi ki?,"The correct answer is **B: Gingrich**.

The passage states: ""Natija aane ke baad Gingrich ne Santorum ki tarif ke, lekin Romney ke ninda ke..."" (After the results, Gingrich praised Santorum, but criticized Romney...).
"
2015 ke pehle show sirf kis jagah dikhaya gya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: TogiNet Radio**.

The passage states: ""इसके शुरुआती दिनों में, इस शो को केवल लंबे समय तक चलाने वाली इंटरनेट रेडियो साइट TogiNet Radio, Tock Radio पर फ़ीचर किया गया था."" which translates to ""In its early days, this show was only featured on the internet radio site TogiNet Radio, Tock Radio.""
"
Station ne show ko kis tarah ke ghumaav ke taur par dikhaya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Avyavasthit**.

The text states the website described the show as ""naye aur kharab tareekese avyavasthit ghumaav ke saath puraane samay ke radio theatre"" which translates to ""old time radio theatre with new and chaotic twists."" Therefore, ""avyavasthit"" (chaotic/disorganized) is the correct answer.
"
David Headley ne aisa kya ektrit kiya jisse ki aatankvaadi samooh ko madad mili?,"The correct answer is **A: Jaankari (Information)**.

The text states: ""David Headley ki scouting aur suchna ektrikaran se pakistani aatankvaadi samooh lashkar-e-taiyaba ke 10 bandukdhariyon ko operation ko safal banaane mein madad mili thi.""

This translates to: ""With David Headley's scouting and **information gathering**, the Pakistani terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba's 10 gunmen were helped to make the operation successful.""

Therefore, David Headley provided **information** which aided the terrorists.
"
Aatankvaadi samooh ne Mumbai aane ke liye parivaah ke kis saadhan ka istemal kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Naav (Boat)**.

The text states: ""26 november 2008 ko mumbai ke hamlawar **naav** ke dwara pahunche..."" which translates to ""On November 26, 2008, the Mumbai attackers arrived **by boat**...""
"
Kaun sa kathan passage mein diya gye Nadal aur Raonic’s Brisbane Open match ke natije ko sahi se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic ne Nadal ko haraya**.

The passage states: ""Way hall hi mein brisbane open mein Raonic ke khilaf haar gaye the."" This translates to ""In the same hall, he lost to Raonic at the Brisbane Open.""  Therefore, Raonic won.
"
Passage ke anusaar first serve ke bad Nadal aur Raonic ke match ke kya natija rha?,"The correct answer is **A: Raonic ko net 88% point mile**.

The passage states: ""First serve mein nadal ko 76 match winning points mein 88% nett points mile."" This translates to ""On first serve, Nadal got 88% net points in 76 match-winning points.""  This implies that Raonic received the remaining points (which is the net points Nadal didn't get) on first serve. Options B, C, and D are incorrect based on the provided text.
"
Teen naye Naked News broadcasts mein kaun si bhasha ka program shaamil nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Japani**.

The question states that the three new Naked News broadcasts will be in Spanish, Italian, and Korean. Japanese is mentioned as a language that already has reports available, but isn't part of the *three new* broadcasts.
"
Passage ke anusaar naya Naked News broadcasts kahan uplabdh nhi hoga?,"The correct answer is **C: Theater**.

The passage states that Naked News will be available on television, web, and mobile devices. It doesn't mention theater as a platform."
Kitne pratiyogiyon ne vishal slallum ko pura nhi kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: 4**.

The question asks how many competitors *failed to complete* the giant slalom. The text states: ""Mahilaaon ke vartamaan samooh mein chaar skier apna run pura karne mein asafal rahe"" which translates to ""In the current group of women, four skiers failed to complete their run.""

While the text also mentions 45 skiers failing in the giant slalom overall (""giant slallum mein kul 117 mein se 45 skier is race mein asthan paane mein asafal rahe""), the question specifically asks about the *visual slalom* (vishal slallum). The passage mentions that 4 skiers failed to complete their run in the women's group during the giant slalom, but it doesn't specify that those were from the visual slalom. However, it is the only number related to the visual slalom and the failure to complete the run.
"
Kaun sa kathan Championship ki daud ke parinaam ko sahi se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Doosri daud mein Hungary ke skier se pehle Carpenado ne daud samaapt ki.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""...Carpenado ne... vishal slallum mein... 1:09.02 minute hangri ke nauvein sthan ke finisher gnogi daanise dasaven asthan par dhimi gati se samaapt hui.""  This means Carpenado finished *before* the Hungarian skier.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Vishal slallum mein 45 skiers ne apni daud samaapt nhi ki:** The text says 45 skiers failed to finish in *giant slalom*, not Vishal slalom.
* **C: Zyadatar skier ne slallum ki tulna mein vishal slallum samaapt ki:** The text doesn't provide information about the number of skiers who completed either type of slalom. It only describes Carpenado's performance in both.
* **D: Carpenado ne slallum dasavein sthan mein samaapt ki:** The text states Carpenado finished tenth in *giant slalom*, not Vishal slalom.  It also mentions he failed to finish in the Vishal slalom.
"
NBA ne niman mein se kise sthagit karne ka faisla kiya?,"The correct answer is **A: Basketball season**.

The question asks what the NBA decided to postpone. The text states the NBA postponed its professional basketball season. While a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive, the *decision* was to postpone the *season*.
"
Passage ke anusaar virus ki vajah se NBA ko kis chiz ki chinta hui?,"The correct answer is **D: Utah Jazz ke khiladi test positive aya.**

The passage states: ""Nba ke faisale ke baad ek utah jazz khiladi covid-19 postive paya gaya."" This directly indicates that a player from the Utah Jazz tested positive for COVID-19, causing concern.

While the other options might be related, they aren't directly supported by the text. Option A is too general, Option B mentions multiple players, and Option C talks about performance, which isn't mentioned in the passage.
"
Washington Capitals ke liye Atlanta Thrashers ke virudh kisne khek jeetane wala goal kiya?,"The correct answer is **A: Nicklas Backstrom**.

The passage states: ""us raat rookie Nicklas Backstrom ke khel jitaane waale goal se ovechkin ko sabse pahali madad milli."" (That night, rookie Nicklas Backstrom's game-winning goal gave Ovechkin his first assist.)
"
Capitals banam Thrashers game ke dauran kisne season ka 60van goal scor kiya?,"The correct answer is **C: Alex Ovechkin**.

The text explicitly states: ""Raat ka unka doosra goal season ka unka 60van goal tha..."" which means Alex Ovechkin scored his 60th goal of the season during the game.
"
Northern rock bank ko kab sarkar ke madad sahaayata thi?,"The correct answer is **D: Mortgage sankat ke dauran**.

The passage states: ""2007 mein subprime mortgage sankat ke dauran northern rock ko iske exposure ke karan samarthan ki zaroorat thi."" (In 2007 during the subprime mortgage crisis, Northern Rock needed support due to its exposure.) This means the government aid was provided *during* the crisis, before the nationalization.
"
Passage ke anusaar Northern Rock bank ke saath Virgin samoh ki dealings ko kaun sa kathan sabse shi se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Virgin Group ne mortgage sankat ke dauran bank ko aapaatkaleen sahaayata ki peshkash ki.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Sir Richard Branson's Virgin Group had bid for banks that were rejected *before* nationalization."" This directly connects Virgin Group to offering assistance to Northern Rock during the 2007 subprime mortgage crisis.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Virgin samooh, Northern Rock ki sampatti prabandhan karne waali company ko bhi kharidti hai:** The passage states that Virgin *only* bought the ""good bank,"" not the asset management company.
* **B: Virgin Group, bank ke rashtriyakaran hone ke bad use kharidti hai:** The passage clearly says Virgin made bids *before* nationalization.
* **D: Virgin Group ki bank ke liye pehli boli bank ke rashtriyakaran hone ke bad ki gayi:** The passage says Virgin made bids *before* nationalization.



Therefore, option C is the most accurate reflection of Virgin Group's dealings with Northern Rock, as described in the passage."
Passage ke anusaar Kyoto jalavaayu samjhaute par hastakshar karne se kis desh ko farq pada hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sanyukt rajya america**.

The passage explicitly states that ""Shree Rudd's decision to sign the Kyoto climate agreement has alienated the United States of America, which will now be the only developed nation to have not ratified the agreement.""

Therefore, the United States is the country affected by the Kyoto climate agreement.
"
Australia ke poorv sarkar sochti hai ki Kyoto ke pushti karne se kise nuksan hoga?,"The correct answer is **B: Desh ki arthavyavastha (The country's economy)**.

The passage states: ""Australia ke poorv roodhivaadi sarkarne kyoto ke pushti karne se mana karte hue kahaa ki jabki bharat aur china jaise desh utsarjan lakshyase nahin bandhe hain, **isse koyale ke niryaat par bhari nirbharta ke saath arthavyavastha ko nuksan hoga**.""

This directly translates to: ""The former conservative government of Australia opposed the ratification of Kyoto, saying that while countries like India and China are not bound by emission targets, **it would harm the economy with its heavy dependence on coal exports**.""

While coal exports are *part* of the economic concern, the core of the concern is the impact on the overall economy.
"
Kis program ke tahat nishaanebaajon ki bharti ki gyi thi?,"The correct answer is **C: NPWS program**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Npws aur australia ke sporting shooters association (nsw) ke beech saajhedaari mein talent hunting show ke tahat kabil swayamsevakon ke bharti ke gayee thi."" This translates to: ""Volunteers were recruited through a talent hunting show in collaboration between NPWS and the Australia Sporting Shooters Association (NSW).""

While the Sporting Shooters Association is involved, the key program leading to the recruitment is the one organized by NPWS.
"
Inmein se kaun sa kathan keat niyantran pareekshan ko sahi se darshata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Nishaanebaajon ke rangers dwara bariki se nigrani ke jaani thi.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""use tarah poorak keat niyantran pareekshan mein nishanebazon ke rangers dwara bariki se nigrani ke jaani thi."" (In the same way that the examination was monitored, the supplementary control examination was closely monitored by rangers of the marksmen.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kyunki yah program ka pehla pareeksahn hai iska mulyankan nhi kiya gaya tha** (Because this is the first examination of the program, it has not been evaluated.) - The passage implies evaluation *was* done, as it mentions the effectiveness of the examination was evaluated.
* **B: Nishaanebaajon ko prashikshan se judey nirdesh mile** (The marksmen received instructions related to training.) - While true, this is a detail and not the core representation of the control examination.  The key aspect of the control examination described is the close monitoring.
* **D: Chaar nishaanebaajon ko chuna gaya** (Four marksmen were selected.) -  This is a detail about the selection process, not the examination itself.



Therefore, option C is the only one that accurately depicts the control examination as described in the passage."
Passage ke anusaar vibhajan kahan mila?,"The correct answer is **B: Jeevashmon par**.

The passage states: ""Jeevashmon ke aadhar par..."" which translates to ""Based on the basis of living organisms...""

While the passage mentions Ethiopia and the Rift Valley Research Service, it clarifies that the idea of division/separation (vibhajan) is based on the analysis of living organisms (jivashmon). Therefore, the most accurate answer is that the passage refers to it being based on living organisms.
"
Passage ke anusaar kya umeed se pehle hua?,"The correct answer is **B: Vibhajan (Division)**.

The passage states: ""Jeevashmon ke aadhar par, iska matlab hai ki **vibhajan aanvik sakshya dwara pratyaashit hone ke tulna mein bahut purana hai**."" This translates to ""Based on biomonitors, this means that **division is much older than expected by scientific evidence**.""

Therefore, division (vibhajan) happened before what scientific evidence predicted.
"
Video game ke dauran khilaaniyon ke movement control karne ke liye khilaaniyon ko kya karna hoga?,"The correct answer is **D: Hawa se controller ko move karein**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""yah device ko hawa mein move karke khilaaniyon ko action aur movement control karne ke anumati dega."" This directly translates to ""this device will allow players to control actions and movement by moving the controller in the air.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tay karein ki controller ke sensor ko console ke pas rakha gaya ho:** While the sensors *need* to be near the console, the passage focuses on *how* the players control the game, not the sensor placement.
* **B: Unki isthiti ko tribhujaakar karein:**  The passage mentions the controller's ability to create a triangular position in 3D space, but this is a *result* of the controller's movement, not the action the player performs to control the game.
* **C: Sensor unke television ke paas rakhein:** The passage explicitly states the sensors need to be *near the console*, not the television.



"
Television remote se milta-julta dikhne wala kya design kiya gaya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Nintendo Revolution controller**.

The paragraph explicitly states that Satoru Iwata unveiled the controller *for the Nintendo Revolution console*.  While the other options are related, they aren't the specific design being described. The controller itself is the design.
"
Samachar agency shinhuane ki taza report mein kya nahi bataya gya?,"The correct answer is **A: Vimaan ko bum se udane ki dhamki di gayi (The plane was threatened with a bomb)**.

Here's why:

* The prompt states that initial reports mentioned a bomb threat. 
* The question asks what the *latest* report from Xinhua *didn't* say.
* The prompt also mentions that later reports said the plane was diverted to Afghanistan due to the bomb threat. 
* The prompt explicitly mentions that the initial report stated the plane was diverted *after* denying an emergency landing in Urumqi, and then returned to Afghanistan. 

Therefore, the latest report *would* likely still mention the bomb threat as the reason for the diversion, but the prompt doesn't say the latest report *confirmed* the threat. 

The other options are explicitly stated as facts in the prompt or directly implied by it.
"
Samachar agency shinhuane ki pichli report mein kya nahi bataya gya?,"The correct answer is **A: Vimaan ke apaharan ho gya tha**

Here's why:

The question asks what the *later* reports *didn't* say. The initial report from Xinhua claimed a plane hijacking. However, subsequent reports indicated a bomb threat and a forced landing in Afghanistan. The later reports *contradicted* the initial claim of a hijacking.

*   **B: Vimaan ko apatkalin landing se incar kar diya gya tha** - This *was* mentioned in the later reports.
*   **C: Vimaan ko Afghanistan vaapas le jaya gaya tha** - This *was* mentioned in the later reports.
*   **D: Vimaan ko bum se udane ki dhamki di gayi** - This *was* mentioned in the later reports.

Therefore, the later reports did *not* confirm the initial claim of a hijacking.
"
Radio karyakaram ke dauran Saara Danius ne kya ghoshna ki thi?,"The correct answer is **D: Samito Bob Dylan tak pahuchne ke prayason ko chhod degi**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...hocker, apne prayason ko chhod chuke the."" This translates to ""...has abandoned their efforts to reach Bob Dylan."" Saara Danius confirms this by saying, ""filhal hum kuch nahin kar rahe hain"" (currently we are not doing anything).  The entire context revolves around the Swedish Academy giving up on trying to get Bob Dylan to accept the Nobel Prize.
"
Kaun nhi pahuch paya?,"The correct answer is **A: Bob Dylan ke nazdiki sahyogi**

The passage states: ""saahitya mein 2016 ke nobel puraskar jeetane ko lekar seedhe bob dylan tak pahuchane mein asamarth hocker, apne prayason ko chhod chuke the."" This translates to: ""Unable to directly reach Bob Dylan regarding the 2016 Nobel Prize in Literature, his assistants have left.""

Therefore, Bob Dylan's assistants couldn't reach him directly.
"
Pratigya ko kisne “ek mahatvapurn kadam” btaya?,"The correct answer is **C: Garden Jondrone**.

The passage states: ""Bushes pravakta garden jondrone uttari koria ke pratigya ko """"koriyai praaydweep ke satyaapit kiye jaa sakane vaale denuclearisation ko paane ke disha mein ek mahatvapurn kadam"""" bataaya."" This translates to ""Bushes spokesperson Garden Jondrone said that North Korea's pledge is a 'significant step towards achieving denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula'.""

Therefore, Garden Jondrone is the one who called the pledge a ""significant step.""
"
Slania ne kayi deshon ke liye kitne stamps banaye?,"The correct answer is **D: 1,000 se jyada**.

The text states: ""Unhone sweeden aur 28 dusre deshon ke liye 1,000se yaada stamp banaae."" This translates to ""He made more than 1,000 stamps for Sweden and 28 other countries.""
"
Passage ke anusaar tankiyon ke chhidra se lagataar leakage ki kya vajah hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Thermal expansion**.

The passage states: ""Budhwar ke dopahar tak tank ke under thermal expansionse shayed abhi bhi tank went leak ho rahe the."" This directly indicates that thermal expansion is the cause of the ongoing leakage.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Doosra containment area ke kshamata tak bharna** - The passage says the second containment area isn't full.
* **B: Niyamit fire-command system pareekshan** - This was the *cause* of the initial spill, not the cause of the ongoing leakage.
* **D: Fort Greely ke pump station me se ek mein fire** - While a fire initiated the spill, the ongoing leakage is attributed to thermal expansion.



"
Reliyef valves kyu khula rha?,"The correct answer is **B: System pareekshan ke bad power failure hua tha**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""ek niyamit fire-command system pareekshan ke chalte bijli chale jaanese reliyef valve khula gaye..."" (During a routine fire-command system test, power failure caused relief valves to open...).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Tank ke ander thermal expansion tha:** Thermal expansion is a *consequence* of the valves opening, not the *cause* of them opening.
* **C: Tankiyon ki poorna kshamata thi:**  The passage states the tank *could* hold 55,000 barrels, but it wasn't full.  This is irrelevant to why the valves opened.
* **D: Doosra containment area abhi tak zyada barrel nhi rakh sakta:** The capacity of the second containment area is irrelevant to why the initial valves opened.



"
Vartamaan mein nauvaan ward mein paani kitna oopar hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kamar se oopar**.

The passage states: ""Nauvaan ward, jo toofan catarina ke dauran 20 feet tak oonchaa dekhaa gaya tha, wah vartamaan mein kamar se oopar paani mein hai..."" This directly tells us the water level is above waist height.
"
"Toofan catarina ke dauran, Nauve ward me kya hua?","The correct answer is **B: Kamar se oopar paani tha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Nauvaan ward, jo toofan catarina ke dauran 20 feet tak oonchaa dekhaa gaya tha, wah vartamaan mein kamar se oopar paani mein hai..."" This directly translates to ""Navaan ward, which was seen to be 20 feet high during Hurricane Katrina, is now underwater up to waist level...""

Let's look at why the other options are not as accurate:

* **A: Pani 100 ki chaudain me fail gya (Water spread over a 100-foot area):** While the water *is* spreading, this doesn't fully describe what happened to the *ward* itself.
* **C: Baadh ka pani 20 feet tak oonchaa dekhaa gaya (Flood water was seen to be 20 feet high):** This describes the flood height *during* the hurricane, not the current situation.
* **D: 6 inch barish ne kshatigrast baandhon ko tod dia (6 inch of rain broke damaged levees):** This describes the *cause* of the current situation, not what happened *to* the ward.



"
Inme se kis kathan ki pushti Hamilton ne nhi ki?,"The correct answer is **A: Mareez ke kahi jane ki** (The patient's whereabouts).

Here's why:

The passage focuses on:

* **The patient being admitted to Harvard Hospital in critical condition.**
* **The patient having traveled to Nigeria, where Ebola cases have occurred.**
* **The hospital following infection control protocols.**

The passage *doesn't* mention what the patient's whereabouts are *now* or any details about where they might have gone after Nigeria. It only states they traveled *to* Nigeria.

The passage *does* state:

* **B: Sambhaavit sankraman ke khatre ki** (The risk of infection). This is directly implied by the fact that the patient traveled to an area with Ebola and is admitted in critical condition.
* **C: Niyamon ka paalan kiye jane ki** (Compliance with the rules).  The passage explicitly states the hospital followed infection control rules.
* **D: Mareez ki maujooda sthiti ki** (The patient's current condition). The passage states the patient was admitted in *critical* condition.



Therefore, the statement Hamilton did *not* make is about the patient's current or future whereabouts.



"
Vaigyaanik kya samajhna chahte hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Prithvi kaise bany (How Earth was formed)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Vaigyaanikon ko yah samajhne ki ummid hai ki grah kaise bante hain, khas kar prithvi kaise bany, choonki dhumketu prithvis e bahut pehle takra chuke the.""  This translates to: ""Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, since धूमकेतु (comets) collided with Earth a very long time ago.""

* **Option D directly reflects this statement.** The passage explicitly mentions understanding the formation of Earth.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dhumketu prithvi se kab takraye (When did comets collide with Earth?)** While the passage mentions collisions, it's not the *primary* thing scientists hope to understand. The *formation* of Earth is the larger goal.
* **B: Protiens kaise bany (How are proteins formed?)** This is unrelated to the passage's topic.
* **C: Organic tatva kya hain (What are organic elements?)** This is also unrelated to the passage's topic.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, chhanbin band karne me local police ki kya bhumika thi?","The correct answer is **A: Unhone fbi ke kahane par chhanbin band ki.**

The passage states: ""Adhikariyon ko khatare ke sachchai ke baare mein pata nahin hai, isliye maryland parivahan pradhikaranne fbi ke kahane par iski chhanbin band kar dee hai."" (Officials did not know the truth about the danger, therefore the Maryland Transportation Authority closed it based on the FBI's statement.)

This directly indicates that the local police (Maryland Transportation Authority) closed the tunnel based on the FBI's recommendation.  The other options are incorrect:

* **B:** They didn't make the decision themselves; they acted on the FBI's advice.
* **C:** Sending drivers to alternate routes was a separate action taken *after* the tunnel was closed.
* **D:** The passage says there was no notification of traffic delays on the alternate route.



"
chhanbin band karne par surang ke pravesh ka kya hua?,"The correct answer is **A: Surang ke pravesh ko band kar dia gya** (The entrance to the tunnel was closed).

The passage explicitly states: ""Surang ke pravesh ko band karne ke liye dump trucks ka istemal kiya gaya tha..."" which translates to ""Dump trucks were used to close the entrance to the tunnel...""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, photographer ko vaahan se takkar lagne se pahle kaun si ghatna nhi hui thi?","The correct answer is **D: Photographer bieber ki photo lena chahta tha**.

Here's why:

* The passage states the photographer was attempting to take a photo of a police traffic stop. There's no mention of him trying to take a photo of Justin Bieber.
* Options A, B, and C are all explicitly mentioned in the passage.

Therefore, D is the only statement that is *not* supported by the text.
"
Photographer ko vaahan se takkar lagne se pahle wah kya karna chahta tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Pulis stop ke photo lena chahta tha**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Entertainment news website TMZ ka maanana hai ki photographer ne apna vaahan sepulweda boulevard ke doosri taraf roka tha aur sadak paar karne aur jaari rakhane se pehle pulis stop ke photo lene ke koshish ke."" (Entertainment news website TMZ believes that the photographer had stopped his vehicle on the other side of Sepulveda Boulevard and tried to take a photo of the police stop before crossing and continuing.)
"
Kaun sa kathan rashtrapati ke virus se sankramit hone ki sthiti ka sateek varnan nhi karta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Ve accha mahsoos nhi kr rhe (They are not feeling well)**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Rashtrapati ke haalat stir hai, haalaanki wah kayee dino tak ghar par ekant mein rahenge."" This means his condition is stable, not that he is not feeling well. In fact, he mentions feeling well enough to work from home.

The other options are all mentioned in the text:

* **B: Unke gale mein kharash hai (He has a sore throat)** - The text says ""gale mein kharash"" (sore throat).
* **C: Unki haalat stir hai (His condition is stable)** - This is stated directly.
* **D: Unhe bukhaar hai (He has a fever)** - The text says ""bukhaar"" (fever).



Therefore, the statement that the President is not feeling well is the one that directly contradicts the information provided in the text."
"Passage ke hisab se, rashtrapati ke baare mein nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan saty hai?","The correct answer is **B: Wah kayee dino tak ghar par ekant mein rahenge.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Rashtrapati ke haalat stir hai, haalaanki wah kayee dino tak ghar par ekant mein rahenge."" (The President's condition is stable, however, he will remain in isolation at home for several days.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unhe bukhaar nhi hai (He doesn't have a fever):** The passage says, ""Bukhaar aur gale mein kharash ke alawa..."" (Besides fever and sore throat...) which implies he *does* have a fever.
* **C: Wah telecommuting karke apna kam pura kar sakte hai (He can complete his work by telecommuting):** While he *says* he can telecommute, the passage doesn't state that he *will* be doing so. He's in isolation, so it's a possibility, not a certainty.
* **D: Wah virus se kayi baar sankramit ho chuke hai (He has been infected with the virus many times):** The passage only states he *has been* infected, not that he's been infected multiple times.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that is directly and accurately supported by the passage."
"Passage ke hisab se, tropical cyclone gonu ke kab kamzor rahne ke apeksha thi?","The correct answer is **A: Maldive pahunchne se pahle**.

The passage states: ""Din ke shuruat mein, havaayen lagbhag 83 kimmy/ghanta thi aur iske kamzor rahne ke apeksha thi.""  This directly indicates that the weakening was expected *at the start of the day*, before the cyclone reached the Maldives.
"
Tropical cyclone gonu ke dauran havaayon ki charm par gati kitni thi?,"The correct answer is **A: 149 kilometer prati ghante**.

The question asks for the wind speed during the cyclone's peak, and the passage states the wind reached 240 kilometers per hour.  The passage also mentions 149 kilometers per hour, which is a conversion of the same wind speed into miles per hour. Since the question is phrased in kilometers per hour, 149 km/h is the correct answer.
"
Nimnalikhit mein se kise karenia bravis ke lakshan nhi maana jaata hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Yah Bahu-koshika wala jeev hai** (यह बहु-कोशिका वाला जीव है)।

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि karenia bravis एक **एकल-कोशिका वाला** समुद्री जीव है। विकल्प C सीधे तौर पर इस जानकारी का खंडन करता है। बाकी विकल्प पाठ में दी गई जानकारी के अनुसार सही हैं।"
Karenia bravis inme se kya nhi kar sakta?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Kisi bhi parasthiti me iski sankhya naatakiya roop se badhti hai**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

पाठ में कहा गया है कि ""Praakritik karaka adarsh isthitiyon ka nirmaan karne ke liye ek dusre ko kat sakte hain, jisase is shaiwal ke sankhya naatakiya roop se b sakti hai।"" इसका मतलब है कि Karenia bravis की संख्या हमेशा नाटकीय रूप से नहीं बढ़ती है, बल्कि यह पर्यावरणीय कारकों पर निर्भर करती है। 

अन्य विकल्प पाठ के अनुसार सही हैं:

* **A: Machhali ke nason ko kamzor kar sakta hai:** पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि Karenia bravis एक neurotoxin बनाता है जो मछली और मनुष्यों दोनों के नसों को कमजोर कर सकता है।
* **C: Jal ko prabhaavit karta hai:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि Karenia bravis ""jal ko prabhaavit karta hai।""
* **D: Neurotoxin banaata hai:** पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि Karenia bravis एक neurotoxin बनाता है।

इसलिए, केवल विकल्प B ही सही नहीं है क्योंकि यह कहता है कि Karenia bravis की संख्या हमेशा नाटकीय रूप से बढ़ती है, जो पाठ में गलत बताया गया है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, Felicia toofan aane par kya nhi hota hai?","The correct answer is **D: Baadh aa jati hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aisi koi suchna nahin mili hai ki baadh yaa kshati ho."" which translates to ""No information has been received about any damage or disaster.""

Therefore, based on the provided text, floods did *not* occur. The other options are mentioned as happening during the storm."
Felicia toofan ke bare me kaun sa kathna galat hai?,"The incorrect statement is **D: Varsha ke samay bijli bhi giri (Lightning also struck during the rains)**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kuch varsha ke samay aandhi aai aur baar-baar bijli giri."" which translates to ""During some rainfall, a storm came and lightning struck repeatedly."" This implies the lightning strikes were *during* the storm, not *with* the rains.  The question asks which statement is *incorrect* about the Felicia storm.  The statement that lightning struck *with* the rains is not directly stated, whereas the text mentions the storm and then the lightning strikes.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Ohu ke liye laabhkari barish hui (Beneficial rainfall occurred for Ohu):** The text explicitly states ""Ohu par ek gaze par 6.34 inch tak pahunchane waali namee ko laabhkari """"bataaya gaya."""" (The moisture reaching up to 6.34 inches per foot in Ohu was considered beneficial.)
* **B: Shreni 4 ke toofan me badlne se pahle ise ushnakatibandhiya avasaad kha gya (It suffered a heatwave depression before turning into a Category 4 storm):** The text says, ""Felicia toofan ke bare me kaun sa kathna galat hai? Shreni 4 ke toofan me badlne se pahle ise ushnakatibandhiya avasaad kha gya"" which translates to ""Which statement about the Felicia storm is incorrect? It suffered a heatwave depression before turning into a Category 4 storm"" - this question implies that the heatwave happened *before* becoming a category 4 storm.
* **C: Adhikatar dweepon mein musladhar barish hui (Heavy rainfall occurred in most islands):** The text mentions ""Adhikatar dweepon mein musladhar barish hui"" (Heavy rainfall occurred in most islands).

Therefore, **D** is the incorrect statement.
"
Kaun sa kathan 2009 hangri gran pri ke parinaam ko sateek roop se darshaata hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Picket junior ko hangri grand pri ke baad nikal diya gaya**.

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है कि अन्य विकल्प क्यों गलत हैं:

* **A: Fernando Alonso durghatnagrast ho gaya:** यह कथन गलत है। प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि पिकेट जूनियर दुर्घटनाग्रस्त हुआ।
* **B: Picket junior ns jeet darj ki:** यह कथन भी गलत है। प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि Alonso के दुर्घटनाग्रस्त होने के बाद पिकेट जूनियर जीतने की स्थिति में आ गया था, लेकिन उसने जीत दर्ज नहीं की।
* **D: Safety kar se durghatna hui:** यह कथन आंशिक रूप से सही है, लेकिन मुख्य फोकस पिकेट जूनियर के करियर पर है। प्रश्न का मुख्य उद्देश्य 2009 हंगरी ग्रैंड प्रिक्स के परिणाम के संदर्भ में पिकेट जूनियर के करियर पर केंद्रित है।

विकल्प C सीधे तौर पर प्रश्न में दी गई जानकारी से मेल खाता है कि पिकेट जूनियर को 2009 हंगरी ग्रैंड प्रिक्स के बाद टीम से हटा दिया गया था।"
Durghatna kab hui?,"सही जवाब है **C: Safety kar ke aage aane se pahle**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

प्रश्न कहता है कि ""जैसे ही अलॉन्सो के इंजन के कारण सुरक्षा कार के लिए नीचे ईंधन भरने के लिए चली गई, वह जीत दर्ज करने के लिए आगे बढ़ गया।""  इसका मतलब है कि दुर्घटना सुरक्षा कार के आने से पहले हुई थी।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

* **A: Alonso ke stop ke baad:** यह गलत है क्योंकि दुर्घटना ईंधन भरने के दौरान हुई थी, न कि ईंधन भरने के बाद।
* **B: Jab anya kar eendhan lene ke liye chully gayee:** यह थोड़ा भ्रामक है। यह ईंधन भरने के दौरान की बात करता है, लेकिन दुर्घटना वास्तव में सुरक्षा कार के आने से पहले हुई थी।
* **D: Picket:** पिकट एक व्यक्ति का नाम है, दुर्घटना का समय नहीं।"
"Passage ke hisab se, nimnalikhit mein se kisane shodhkartaon ke mool anumaan se kam samay liya?","सही उत्तर है **A: Prajaati ke nirmaan me**।

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

* Passage कहता है कि नई प्रजातियों का निर्माण केवल दो पीढ़ियों में हुआ।
* Passage में यह भी उल्लेख है कि Galapagos Finch प्रजातियों के बीच प्रजनन में प्रजातियों के निर्माण में काफी समय लगा।

इसलिए, प्रश्न पूछा जा रहा है कि किस चीज में शोधकर्ताओं के मूल अनुमान से कम समय लगा। चूँकि नई प्रजातियों का निर्माण सिर्फ दो पीढ़ियों में हुआ, इसलिए यह विकल्प (A) सही है।
"
Shodhkartaon ne kya nhi bataaya?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Nai prajaati ka nirmaan kha hua**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

*   प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि अध्ययन ने एक नई पक्षी प्रजाति के निर्माण की जानकारी दी है।
*   उत्तर विकल्प A कहता है कि शोधकर्ताओं ने यह नहीं बताया कि नई प्रजाति का निर्माण खा हुआ है। यह जानकारी अध्ययन में शामिल नहीं है।
*   अन्य विकल्प, B, C और D, अध्ययन में उल्लिखित जानकारी का सारांश हैं। शोधकर्ताओं ने नई प्रजातियों के विकास के समय, प्रजातियों के नाम और प्रजातियों के निर्माण में प्रजनन की भूमिका के बारे में बताया है।"
Kalaatmak karyakram kha honge?,"The correct answer is **B: Bucharest city me**

The text states: ""Artistic event (kalaatmak karyakram) bhi bucharest city hall ke campaign ka ek hissa hai..."" which translates to ""Artistic event (kalaatmak karyakram) is also a part of the Bucharest city hall's campaign...""

Therefore, the artistic event is taking place in Bucharest city.
"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan CowParade ka sateek varnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Yah duniya ka sabse bada saarvajanik calla karyakram hai.**

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""coupred ka ayojan karne wala dakshina-purvi europe ka yah pahla shaharhoga.  ... beach duniya ka sabse bada saarvajanik calla karyakram..."" which translates to ""...this city will be the first in Southeastern Europe to organize Coupeder, ...the world's largest public art event...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ""Yah keval un shaharon mein hota hai jinhen """"creative"""" maana jaata hai""** - While the text mentions Bucharest's goal of creating a creative image, it *doesn't* say Coupeder only happens in creative cities.
* **B: Ise Bucharest City Hall ne aayojit kiya tha** - The text states that Bucharest City Hall is *part of* the campaign, but it doesn't definitively say they *organize* Coupeder. It says they are organizing the *largest public art event*.
* **C: Yah poore dakshina-poorvee europe mein garmiyon mein aayojit hone vaala ek calla karyakram hai** - The text specifies Coupeder happens in June and August. It doesn't say it takes place *throughout* Southeastern Europe in the summer.



"
Kis kaaran se rouse ne II-76s ka upayog karna band kar diya?,"The correct answer is **B: Durghatna ke Kaaran (Because of the accident)**.

The text explicitly states that the IL-76s were grounded ""bainaa kisi kshati ke 7 october ko injan takeoff ke dauran alag ho gaya"" (on October 7th, without any casualties, the engine separated during takeoff).  This accident is the reason they were grounded.

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aantarik sainikon ke kaaran (Because of the internal soldiers)** - The text mentions internal soldiers operating the aircraft, but it doesn't say this caused the grounding.
* **C: Soviyat senaaon ke kaaran (Because of the Soviet soldiers)** -  The text refers to the Soviet and Russian armies using the IL-76, but doesn't link that to the grounding.
* **D: Uski jaanch baki thi (Because its inspection was pending)** - The text mentions a probe was set up *for* Chhanbin, but doesn't say a pending inspection caused the grounding.



"
II-76 kya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ek vimaan (An airplane)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Il-76. 1970 ke dashake hi russie aur soviyat senaaon ka mukhya ghatak raha hai."" which translates to ""Il-76. Since the 1970s it has been a main component of the Russian and Soviet armies."" And later, it mentions an accident involving ""takeoff ke dauran alag ho gaya"" (separated during takeoff), a characteristic of aircraft.
"
The Simpsons ke liye kisne lekhan team ko niyukt kiya tha?,"The correct answer is **B: Saiman**.

The text states: ""1989 mein usne Brooks aur Groening ke saath the Simpson ko rachane mein madad ke aur wah show ke pahali writing team ko niyukt karne ke liye uttardaayi tha."" This translates to ""In 1989, he helped create The Simpsons with Brooks and Groening and appointed the first writing team for the show."" The ""he"" refers to Saiman, as he is the subject of the first sentence.
"
"Fluke ke anusaar, use sakaaraatmak comment aur protsaahan kaun bhej raha tha?","The correct answer is **D: Mahila aur purush dono** (Women and men both).

The text states: ""Mahila aur purush, dono ke orse bee sankhya mein mille sakaratmak comment aur protsaahan..."" which translates to ""Positive comments and encouragement were received from both women and men...""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kuchh log nahin chaahate the ki mahilaen kis baare mein bolen?","The correct answer is **C: Mahilaaon ke swaasthya ke baare mein**

Here's why:

* The passage states that ""Flukene likhaa hai ki kuch logonne mahilaaon dwara mahilaaon ke swaasthya ke baare mein bulwaane ka prayaas kiya jismein way asafal rahe.""  This translates to ""Fluke wrote that some people tried to raise awareness about women's health through women, but they failed.""
* The passage then goes on to say that, despite this failure, positive comments and encouragement from both men and women led to the conclusion that contraceptives should be recognized as essential medicines.

Therefore, the people who tried to prevent women from speaking about women's health were trying to suppress discussions about **women's health**.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kaun sa grah sarvaadhik gatisheel hai?","The correct answer is **A: Dharti (Earth)**.

The passage states: ""Stoffenne kahaa, jahan tak hum jaanate hain, ek hi aisaa grah hai, jo tyton ke tulna mein zyada gatishilata dikhaata hai aur uska naam hai, dharti.""  This translates to: ""Stoffenne said, as far as we know, there is only one such planet that shows more dynamism compared to the others, and its name is Earth.""
"
Pardarshi taral padaarth se yukt nadiyon aur jheelon kee pahachaan kis grah par kee gaee hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Tyton**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Stoffenne kahaa, jahan tak hum jaanate hain, ek hi aisaa grah hai, jo tyton ke tulna mein zyada gatishilata dikhaata hai aur uska naam hai, dharti."" (Stoffenne said, as far as we know, there is only one such planet which shows more activity compared to the Titans, and its name is Earth.)

The passage then describes a characteristic of Earth: ""Yah paani ke tarah vyavhaar karne jaa raha hai. Yah bilkul paani ke tarah pardarshi hai. isliye agar aap kinare par khade hain, aap satah mein niche maujood kankar yaa keechad dekh sakenge."" (It is behaving like water. It is completely transparent like water. Therefore, if you stand on the shore, you can see pebbles or mud below the surface.)

This description points to the presence of rivers and lakes on Earth, which are made of transparent liquid, allowing visibility to the bottom.  The question asks where transparent liquid rivers and lakes are identified. Since the passage links the transparency and the visibility to Earth, the answer must be Earth. However, Earth is not listed as an option. Since the text says Earth is ""more active than the Titans"" and only identifies one planet with this trait, and then specifically links the transparent liquid to Earth, the most reasonable interpretation is that the question is flawed. However, among the available choices, **Tyton** is the only one that's even remotely related to the concept of liquid and activity (Titans are moons of Saturn known for their liquid methane lakes and complex atmosphere).

Therefore, despite the logical inconsistency, the best answer from the choices given is **B: Tyton**.
"
Inamen se kaun sa nishkarsh pankh kee khoj ka parinaam nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Is baat ki pushti ki jyadatar dynasore ke pankha the** (The confirmation that most dinosaurs had wings).

Here's why:

* **The passage states that the discovery *supports* the idea that at least some dinosaurs had wings.** It doesn't confirm that *most* dinosaurs had wings. The passage highlights the new information about wing structure, color, and development, but doesn't generalize to the entire dinosaur population.

Let's look at why the other options *are* conclusions of the wing discovery:

* **A: Janwar ke pankh ka rang** (The color of the animal's wings): The passage explicitly mentions the discovery of the color of the dinosaur wings.
* **B: Yah samajh ki pankhon ka upayog udaan mein nhi kiya jata tha** (The understanding that wings were not used for flight):  The passage states that wing structure suggests they were used for temperature regulation or display, not flight.
* **C: Pankhon ke vikaas ki aham jankari** (Important information about wing development): The passage details discoveries regarding the structure and development of the wings, including the possible late development of the rachis.



Therefore, only option D is not a conclusion drawn from the wing discovery described in the passage."
Dynasore ke pankhon me kya nhi tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Neeche ka bhaag halke rang ka (The lower part was light in color)**.

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""Vaigyaanikon ka yah kahna hai ki is janwar ke romchhidra bhoore aur carotenoid ke niche ka rung bhura-bhura tha.""  This translates to ""Scientists say that this animal's pores were brown and the color under the carotenoids was brown-brown."" This indicates the lower part was *not* light.
* The text mentions barbules are present in the wings.
* The text mentions rachis is present in the wings.
* The text states that the wings were not developed for flight, but for temperature regulation or display.

Therefore, the only option that contradicts the information provided in the text is ""Neeche ka bhaag halke rang ka"".



"
Zmapp ke baare me kaun sa kathan asatya hai?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Yah antibody se banta hai**

यहाँ क्यों:

* **Zmapp** एक मोनोक्लोनल एंटीबॉडी कॉकटेल है। यह एंटीबॉडी से ही बना है, लेकिन विकल्प A यह कहता है कि यह एंटीबॉडी से नहीं बनता।

अन्य विकल्प सही हैं:

* **B: Yah ilaaj karne ke liye hai, lekin maut ko nhi rok sakta:**  यह सही है क्योंकि Zmapp ने संक्रमण का इलाज करने में कुछ हद तक सफलता दिखाई थी, लेकिन मृत्यु दर को कम करने में अपेक्षित लाभ के मुकाबले कम प्रभावी था।
* **C: Palm pareekshan mein, ek niyantran ke roop mein karya karta hai:**  यह भी सही है। Palm परीक्षण में, Zmapp को एक नियंत्रण के रूप में उपयोग किया गया था ताकि अन्य उपचारों की तुलना की जा सके।
* **D: Adhyayanon se pata chalata hai ki isake laabh, pratyaashit laabh se kam hain:** यह भी सही है। अध्ययनों ने दिखाया कि Zmapp का लाभ मृत्यु दर को रोकने के लिए अपेक्षित लाभ से कम था।"
Inmen se kaun sa kathan Palm pareekshan ke bare me shi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Niyantran ke roop mein teen any upchaaron ke sath tulna ke gyi, jisme se ek ZMapp tha।**

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है कि यह उत्तर सही क्यों है और अन्य विकल्प क्यों गलत हैं:

*   **B सही है:** प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से बताया गया है कि ""Palm pareekshan mein, zmappne ek niyantran ke roop mein karya kiya, jiska arth hai ki vaigyaanikonne ise baseline ke roop mein istemal kiya aur iske saath teen any upchaaron ke tulna ke।"" इसका मतलब है कि अध्ययन ने ZMapp को एक नियंत्रण के रूप में अन्य तीन उपचारों के साथ तुलना की।

*   **A गलत है:** प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि अध्ययन ने पाया कि ZMapp का लाभ अपेक्षित लाभ से कम था। इसलिए, यह कथन गलत है।

*   **C आंशिक रूप से सही है, लेकिन B अधिक सटीक है:** यह सही है कि ZMapp का उपयोग एक बेसलाइन के रूप में किया गया था, लेकिन केवल ZMapp का उपयोग बेसलाइन के रूप में करने से पूरी तस्वीर नहीं मिलती। अध्ययन ने ZMapp की तुलना अन्य उपचारों से की। इसलिए, B अधिक व्यापक और सटीक उत्तर है।

*   **D गलत है:** प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से बताया गया है कि ZMapp की प्रभावशीलता कम थी। इसलिए, यह कथन गलत है।"
Shodhakartaon ke hisab se naee chip sabase jyada upyogi kahaa hogi?,"The correct answer is **A: Alp aaya waale deshon mein (In low-income countries)**.

The text explicitly states that the scientists believe the chip will be most useful in low-income countries because it can help diagnose diseases like cancer, TB, HIV, and malaria, where access to advanced diagnostic tools is limited, and survival rates for diseases like cancer are lower compared to wealthier countries.
"
Diagnostic tool ke nirmaan ke lie kis vidhi ka upayog kiya jaega?,"The correct answer is **C: Print karne yogya chip**.

The text states the tool is a ""chhoti print karne yogya chip"" (small printable chip). While the chip is made using a standard inkjet printer, the *tool* itself is the chip.  The other options are components *used* in the tool's creation, not the tool itself.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, lobet scarps ke baare mein kaun sa kathan saty nahin hai?","The correct answer is **D: Ve chanda ke satah par jyada nhi hai (They are not very widespread on the lunar surface)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states that lobet scarps are found ""pure chandrama par paaye gaye"" (found all over the moon).** This directly contradicts option D, which says they are not very widespread.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Hall hi mein bane hai (They were formed recently):** The passage states they ""nyuntam roop se mausam ke karan raaba hue dikhai dete hain, jo yah darshaata hai ki kisi bhoogarbhiya ghatnaaonne unhein hall hi mein banaaya tha"" (roughly appear to have been formed due to weathering, which shows that some geological events formed them recently).
* **B: Chand puri tarah se bhoogarbhiya gatividhise rahit nhi hai (The moon is not completely devoid of geological activity):** The passage explicitly states that the discovery of lobet scarps ""is daave ka khandan karta hai ki chand puri tarah se bhoogarbhiya gatividhise rahit hai"" (refutes the claim that the moon is completely devoid of geological activity).
* **C: Chandrama ke sikudane ke vajah se hue hain (They were caused by the shrinking of the moon):** The passage directly states that lobet scarps are ""chandrama ke sikudane ke vajah se hue hain"" (caused by the shrinking of the moon).



"
"Passage ke hisab se, bhoo-aakrtiyon ke sambandh mein kaun sa siddhaant bataata hai ki chandrama par bhoogarbhiya gatividhi ho rahee hai?","The correct answer is **A: Chandrama sikud rha hai (The moon is shrinking)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the discovery of lobate scarps on the Moon's surface, which are believed to be formed due to the Moon's contraction, challenges the idea that the Moon is geologically inactive.  The passage explicitly links the shrinking of the Moon to the formation of these landforms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bhoo-aakrtiyan bhut pahle bni thi (The landforms were formed a long time ago):**  The passage states the scarps appear *recently* due to weathering, thus contradicting this.
* **C: Chandrama par inki sankhya bhut kam hai (There are very few of these on the Moon):** The passage says the scarps are *widespread* across the Moon.
* **D: Hall hi mein bani hai (They were formed recently):** While the scarps are recently *weathered*, the underlying cause, according to the passage, is the shrinking of the Moon.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, abhiyog lagane tak aur kya nahin hoga?","The correct answer is **A: Tippani nahin ke jaayegi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Crown office, jo ki abhiyog paksh ke liye immedaar hai, ne patrakaron ko sanket diya hai ki kamse kam abhiyog lagane tak koi tippani nahin ke jaayegi.""  (The Crown Office, who are the immediate representatives of the prosecution, have signaled to journalists that no comments will be made until at least charges are brought.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Tasveeron ka prakashan nhi hoga** - The passage mentions that eyewitnesses *could* be influenced by the widespread publication of images, but it doesn't say that the publication of images will be prohibited. In fact, the courts have looked at the publication of images as potentially prejudicial.
* **C: Chashmadid gawah pr baat nhi hogi** - The passage states that eyewitnesses *can* be influenced by the images, but this doesn't mean they won't be spoken to.
* **D: Article ka prakashan nhi hoga** - The passage doesn't say anything about the publication of articles. It focuses on comments and the publication of images.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, sealers ke liye vartamaan samasya kya nahin hai?","The correct answer is **D: Pighalti barf (Melting snow)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that the current situation is bad for sealers because of **heavy snowfall (tez barfbari) and the amount and thickness of the snow (pek barf ke matra aur motai)**.  Pitman specifically mentions that the current snow conditions are the worst in 15 years for sealers.

While the passage mentions bad weather conditions (mausam ke kharab isthiti), it doesn't specifically highlight *melting snow* as a problem. The focus is on the *amount* and *thickness* of the snow, implying a buildup.  Therefore, melting snow isn't the primary issue being discussed.

The options A, B, and C (heavy snowfall, snow thickness) *are* mentioned as problems. Therefore, the only option that is NOT mentioned is melting snow.
"
"Barf ke alawa, bachaav ke prayason par aur kiska prabhaav pad raha hai?","सही उत्तर है **D: Sealers**।

प्रश्नों में कहा गया है कि Pitman के अनुसार, बर्फ की मात्रा और मोटाई पिछले 15 वर्षों में ""sealers"" के लिए सबसे खराब है। इसका मतलब है कि बर्फ की स्थिति का सीधा असर sealers पर पड़ रहा है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

* **A: Aapurti ki kami (आपूर्ति की कमी):** आपूर्ति की कमी का उल्लेख नहीं किया गया है।
* **B: Mausam ke isthiti (मौसम की स्थिति):**  मौसम की स्थिति को ""बचाव के प्रयासों"" के संदर्भ में माना जा रहा है, लेकिन प्रश्न बर्फ के अलावा किसी और पर प्रभाव के बारे में पूछ रहा है।
* **C: Madad ki kami (मदद की कमी):** मदद की कमी का उल्लेख नहीं किया गया है।"
Roberts ne kis chiz par apne vichaar prakat karne se manna kar diya?,"The correct answer is **C: Jeevan ki shuruat par**.

The passage states: ""Garbhpaat ke naitikta par vichaar karte samay ek mahatvapurn sawal, jeevan kab shuru hota hai par sambhaavit mamalon ke baarikiyon par tippani karne ko anaitik bataate hue robertsne is par apne vichaar prakat karne se saann-saann manna kar diya."" This translates to: ""While considering the ethics of abortion, a crucial question, when does life begin, Roberts reluctantly expressed his views on this, having been told that commenting on the nuances of possible cases is unethical.""

Therefore, Roberts reluctantly refrained from expressing his views on **when life begins**.
"
Roberts ko kis vishay par baat karna naitikta ke khilaf lgta tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Cases ki khas baton par**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Robertsne is par apne vichaar prakat karne se saann-saann manna kar diya. Halanki, unhone apne pehle ke bayaan ko dohraya ki row versus wade """"bhoomi ka vyavasthit kanoon"""" tha, jis mein uchchatam nyayalaya ke susangat nirnayon ke mahatva par jor diya gaya tha. **usne yah pushti bhi ke hai ki use gopaniyata ke nihit adhikaron par yakeen hai, jis par ki row nirnay adharit hai.**""

The key part is: ""**anaitik bataate hue robertsne is par apne vichaar prakat karne se saann-saann manna kar diya**"" and ""**tappani karne ko anaitik bataate hue...sambhaavit mamalon ke baarikiyon par tippani karne ko anaitik bataate hue...**"" This indicates that Roberts felt it was unethical to comment on the specific details/nuances of cases, particularly regarding the topic of when life begins.

While he references *Roe v. Wade* and privacy rights, the ethical issue wasn't with those concepts *per se*, but with commenting on the *specific cases* that derived from them.

Therefore, option D is the most accurate.
"
Prakash ke do kirane kha chahmak rhi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Aasmaan me (In the sky)**.

The text states: ""Ratbhar aasmaan ke or dekhne ke liye prakash ke do kiranon ko taiyar kiya gaya hai."" (Two rays of light have been prepared to look towards the night sky.)

Therefore, the rays of light are in the sky.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, site par naee gaganachumbee imaaraten kab banaee ja rahee hain?","The correct answer is **D: Kam chal raha hai (Currently under construction)**.

The passage states: ""Site par panchnei gaganchumbi imaraton par kam chal raha hai..."" which translates to ""Construction is currently underway on five sky-scraping buildings at the site...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dopahar me (In the afternoon):** The passage doesn't mention the time of day the construction is happening.
* **B: Subah 8:46 baje (At 8:46 AM):** This refers to a specific event (the initial ""thik"" mentioned) but not the ongoing construction.
* **C: Ratbhar (Throughout the night):** The passage mentions preparing rays of light to see the night sky, but this doesn't indicate that construction is happening throughout the night.



"
Kis jankari pta chlta hai ki saaton bahanen gufaaen hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Gufaaon me ghusane ke jagah ka diameter**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sabhi gufaaon, jinka naam """"saat bahanen"""" rakhaa gaya, mein ghusane ke jagah ka diameter kamse kam 100se 250 meter (328se 820 wheat) hai.""  This directly indicates that the diameter of the entrance is a characteristic used to identify these caves.

While temperature (A) is mentioned as a characteristic, the passage doesn't say *temperature* is the *reason* they are called ""Saat Bahanen"".  Geological surveys (C) and cave images (D) are mentioned in the context of Glen Cushing's statement, but they are not the defining characteristic *of the caves themselves*. They are used to *study* them. Therefore, diameter is the direct identifier.
"
Saaton bahano ka tapman kaise pta chlta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Infrared chitra se (From Infrared images)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Infrared chitra dikhaate hain ki raat aur din ke badale tapmanse..."". This translates to ""Infrared images show that...temperature changes between day and night..."". Therefore, the temperature of the caves is determined using infrared images.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, sandigdh ke baare mein kaun sa kathan satya nhi hai?","The correct answer is **D: Use chotein nhi aai (He didn't get any injuries)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Bum visfot ke shuck mein ek vyakti ko giraftar kiya gaya hai, jise dhamaake mein kuch chotein aai hain."" (A person was arrested in the aftermath of the explosion, who sustained some injuries in the blast.)

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Usne hamla karte samay vaahan ka istemal kiya (He used a vehicle during the attack):** The passage says ""teen pahiyon waale vaahan ko nikal diya"" (a three-wheeled vehicle was driven out), indicating the vehicle was used in the attack.
* **B: Usne kathit taur par visfot kiya (He forcibly detonated an explosion):** The passage states ""shakhasne bhid mein visfotakonse hathiyarband"" (forcibly detonated an explosive weapon in the crowd), implying he was responsible for the explosion.
* **C: Uski jaati adhikariyon ko pata hai (His ethnicity is known to the authorities):** The passage mentions ""wah uighar jaatiya samooh ka sadasya hai"" (he is a member of the Uyghur ethnic group).



Therefore, the only statement that is *not* true according to the passage is that he didn't get injured.
"
Adhikaariyon ne hamale ke sambandh mein kis jaanakaaree kee pushti kee hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Uski jaati (His ethnicity)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""way jaanate hain ki wah uighar jaatiya samooh ka sadasya hai"" which translates to ""they know that he is a member of the Uyghur ethnic group.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Uske aathee ki pahachaan (His identity)** - While his ethnicity is mentioned, his specific identity (name, address, etc.) is unknown.
*   **C: Hamle ka uddeshya (The purpose of the attack)** - The text doesn't provide any information about the motive behind the attack.
*   **D: Uska naam (His name)** - The text explicitly states that authorities do not yet know his name.



"
Ellis Park me kaun si team match khelegi?,"The correct answer is **C: South Africa aur Australia**.

The text states: ""is seereez ka final match springbox aur australia ke beach, agle hafte johannesburg ke ellis park mein khela jayega."" This directly translates to ""the series final match between Springboks and Australia will be played next week at Ellis Park, Johannesburg.""
"
Springbox agla match kha khelegi?,"The correct answer is **C: Johannesburg**.

The text states: ""is seereez ka final match springbox aur australia ke beach, agle hafte johannesburg ke ellis park mein khela jayega."" This translates to ""The final match of this series between the Springboks and Australia will be played next week at Ellis Park in Johannesburg.""
"
Space station mission ke dauraan kisase pareshaanee huee?,"The correct answer is **B: Gyroscope rakhne se**.

The passage states: ""Spacewalk ke ant tak space station mission mein pehle ek **gyroscope ke nuksan** ke bavjood stationne apna rukh banaae rakhaa."" (Until the end of the spacewalk, the space station maintained its orientation despite a **gyroscope failure**.)

Therefore, the problem was the failure of the gyroscope. Options A, C, and D are incorrect.
"
Passage ke anusaar space station ke mission ka lakshay kya tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Spacewalk poori karna**

Here's why:

The passage states that a spacewalk was conducted. The mention of a damaged gyroscope and the subsequent actions to regain the station's attitude are steps taken *during* the spacewalk mission. While the other options are related to the events described, they aren't the overall goal of the mission. The goal was to complete the spacewalk, and the gyroscope issue and the Russian actions were obstacles that needed to be overcome to achieve that goal.
"
Inmein se kaun sa kathan is mamle ke bare mein shi nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Is par us rajya mein mukadama chalaya gaya AOL ka mukhyalay tha**.

Here's why:

The provided text states: ""P: is mamle par virginia mein mukadama chalaaya gaya kyunki yah agrani internet seva pradaata AOL ka ghar hai..."" This translates to ""P: a case was filed in Virginia because it is the home of leading internet service provider AOL...""

The key point is that the case was filed in Virginia *because* AOL's headquarters were located there. The statement ""Is par us rajya mein mukadama chalaya gaya AOL ka mukhyalay tha"" is essentially restating the reason *why* the case was in Virginia, not a separate, incorrect fact. The other options are all directly supported by the text.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

*   **B: Vishwaas haasil kiya gaya (Trust was obtained):** The text says ""vishwaas hassil kiya gaya"" which means ""trust was obtained"".
*   **C: Mamle mein spam email se sambandhit kanoon ka istemaal kiya gya (A law related to spam emails was used in the case):**  The text explicitly mentions that the case involved a law created in 2003 to prevent unwanted bulk email and spam.
*   **D: AOL par aarop lagaya ja rha tha (AOL was being accused):** The text states that the case was filed ""kyunki yah agrani internet seva pradaata AOL ka ghar hai, wah company jisane aaropon ko uksaayaa"" - ""because it is the home of leading internet service provider AOL, the company that incited the accusations"". This indicates AOL was being accused of something.



"
Inme se konsa kathan mamle ka sahi varnan karta hai?,"The best answer is **D: AOL ne mukadama shuru kiya tha.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""P: is mamle par virginia mein mukadama chalaaya gaya kyunki yah agrani internet seva pradaata AOL ka ghar hai, wah company jisane aaropon ko uksaayaa.""  This translates to ""P: A case was filed in Virginia because it is the home of leading internet service provider AOL, the company that spurred the accusations."" This strongly implies AOL initiated the legal action.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: AOL par anchaahe distributor ka aarop lagaya gaya tha (A spam distributor was accused of something against AOL):** While the text mentions spam distributors, it doesn't say *they* were accused *of* something against AOL.  It says AOL was the company that was accused *by* the spam distributors.
* **B: Is case mein do mukhya internet seva pradaata shamil the (Two major internet service providers were involved in this case):**  The text only mentions AOL.
* **C: Is mamle par 2003 mein mukadama chalaya gaya tha (A case was filed in 2003):** The text says the law was created in 2003, but it doesn't specify the case was filed *in* 2003. It only says the case was filed *because* of AOL.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Vidal ne teen season pehle kis club mein khelna shuru kiya tha?","The correct answer is **A: Sevilla**.

The passage states: ""28 varshiya vidal teen season pehle sevillase barka mein shamil hue the."" which translates to ""28-year-old Vidal joined Sevilla three seasons ago."""
Vidal ne Barça ke liye kitne game khele?,"The correct answer is **A: 49**.

The question states: ""Katlan ke rajdhani (Barcelona) mein jaane ke baadse, vidalne club ke liye 49 game khele the.""  This translates to ""After going to the capital of Catalonia (Barcelona), Vidal played 49 games for the club.""
"
Match mein virodhi team kon thi?,"The correct answer is **B: Bolonia**.

The text states: ""Wah ravivaar ko niyojit bolonia ke khilaf hone waale matchse pehle team ke hotel mein thehra hua tha."" This translates to ""They were staying at the team hotel before the scheduled match against Bologna on Sunday.""
"
Jerkus hotel mein kyun ruka tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Sunday ke match ke liye**.

The passage states: ""Wah ravivaar ko niyojit bolonia ke khilaf hone waale matchse pehle team ke hotel mein thehra hua tha."" This translates to: ""The team was staying at the hotel before the scheduled match against Bologna on Sunday.""
"
Jakarta bhubhautiki agency chetavani jaari kyun nhi karegi?,"The correct answer is **D: yah bhookamp ke liye parmiaan ke aavashyakta ko pura nahin karta tha** (It did not meet the threshold for a tsunami).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Jakarta bhubhautiki agency ke anusaar, koi sunami ke chetavani jaari bhi nahin ke jaayega kyonki bhookamp 6.5 ke aavashyakta ko pura nahin karta tha."" (According to the Jakarta geological agency, no tsunami warning will be issued because the earthquake did not meet the requirement of 6.5.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Sunami ka koi khatra nhi tha** (There was no tsunami danger) - While true, this is a consequence of the agency's decision, not the *reason* for the decision.
* **B: Nivaasiyon ke beech dahashat failne se rokne ke liye** (To prevent panic among residents) - The passage doesn't mention panic as a factor in the agency's decision.
* **C: Sthaniya karobaaron ko hone wale asar se bachane ke liye** (To protect local businesses from potential impact) -  The passage doesn't mention business protection as a reason.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **D**.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, bhookamp ka karan kya tha?","The correct answer is **D: Parimaan paimaane par 6.5**.

The passage states: ""...kyonki bhookamp 6.5 ke aavashyakta ko pura nahin karta tha."" This means the earthquake wasn't strong enough (6.5 on the Richter scale) to trigger a tsunami warning.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: sthaniya logon ke beech dahashat** (local people's terror): The passage mentions fear, but doesn't attribute the earthquake to terror.
* **B: Sunami ka khatra** (tsunami danger): The passage says there was *no* tsunami danger.
* **C: Jaari ki gayi chetavani** (issued warning):  The passage states *no* tsunami warning was issued.



"
Inme se kis wajah se surya aur any sitaaron ki gatividhi sanchaalit hoti hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Parikraman aur Prakash**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""मंडल के सभी सितारों की गतिविधियाँ उनके प्रकाश, उनके परिक्रमण द्वारा संचालित थी, किसी और कारण से नहीं।"" (The activities of all stars in the system are driven by their light, by their orbit, and not by any other reason.)
*  The passage mentions that the Rosby number (related to plasma flows) is used in conjunction with a star's brightness and rotation to understand its magnetic activity.  However, the primary drivers of stellar activity, according to the passage, are **light (prakash)** and **orbit (parikraman)**.

Therefore, option C accurately reflects the information given in the passage.  The other options include elements not directly cited as the *primary* drivers.
"
Kisi sitare ki Rosby sankhya ko kese nirdharit kiya jata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Prakash aur Parikraman (Luminosity and Rotation)**.

The text explicitly states: ""एक taare ke rosby sankhya, jo plasma flowse sambandhit hai, ka pata lagaane ke liyeuski chamak aur rotation ka ek saath istemal kiya jaataa hai..."" which translates to ""To determine a star's Rosby number, its luminosity and rotation are used together...""  Luminosity is a measure of brightness (similar to ""prakash""), and rotation is ""parikraman"" (rotation) in this context.
"
Survey mein hissa lene wale kitne prathishat log Australia ko turant gantantra banana chahte the?,"The correct answer is **B: 29 prathisha**.

The question asks about the percentage of people who wanted Australia to become a republic *immediately*. The text states: ""Survey ke natije ke mutabik, survey mein shamil 29 pratishat logon ka maanana hai ki Australia ko jaldse jald ek gantantra ban jaanaa chaahiye..."" which translates to ""According to the survey results, 29 percent of the people included in the survey believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible...""
"
"Julia gillard, Australia ko kab gantantra banana chaahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Raani Elizabeth dwiteeya ke shasankal ke baad**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Karyavahak pradhaanmantri julia gillard ne 2010 ke sanghiya chunaav ke campaign ke dauran daava kiya ki wah maanti hain ki raani elizabeth dwiteeya ke shasankal ke ant mein Australia ko ek gantantra banana chaahiye."" (Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a democracy by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.)

While the survey results mention opinions on *when* Australia *should* become a democracy, Gillard's stated position is that it should happen *after* Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
"
Kis sanstha par kanuni jaanch chal rahi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Niyojit parenthood**.

The question states: ""Comen ke neetine yojnabaddh pitritva ko ek lambit jaanch ke karan ayogya thahraya ki kaise yojnabaddh pitritva iske paise bataata hai aur kharch karta hai..."" This directly links the legal investigation to **Niyojit parenthood**.
"
Cliff Stearns kis kameti ke head hain?,"The correct answer is **A: House energy end comers kameti**.

The text states: ""...who house energy end comers kameti ke antargat aata hai."" This translates to ""...which falls under the jurisdiction of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.""

Therefore, Cliff Stearns is the head of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Swiss mahila ke sath kya nhi hua tha?","The correct answer is **B: Use maar diya gaya tha**

Here's why:

* The passage states that police arrested five people for raping a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile and laptop from them. 
* It *doesn't* say she was killed.  The passage only mentions the rape and the recovery of her belongings.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chori hua samaan baramad hua:** The passage explicitly states the stolen laptop and mobile were recovered.
* **C: Uske sath 5 logo ne yaun utpidan kiya:** The passage states that five people were arrested for raping her.
* **D: Uska phone aur laptop chori hua tha:** The passage mentions her phone and laptop were recovered *after* the arrests, implying they were stolen.



"
2007 mein kis company ko taiwan sustainable awardse sammaanit kiya gaya?,"The correct answer is **C: ASUS**.

The passage explicitly states: ""yah baat 2007 taipe it mahine mein charcha mein rahi. Lekin laptop computer par upabhokta bazaar maulik roop se vividhtapurna hoga aur chini ganarajya ke karyakari yuan dwara 2007 mein asus ko taiwan sustainable awardse sammaanit kiya gaya ke baad badal jayega."" This translates to: ""This matter was discussed in Taipei for 2007 months. But the consumer market for laptop computers will become more diverse and will change after ASUS was honored with the Taiwan Sustainable Award in 2007 by the People's Yuan of China.""



"
ASUS Eee PC kya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Laptop**.

The text explicitly states: ""Bachat aur suvidha ko dhyan mein rakhte hue, asus eee pc ko duniyabhar mein pesh kiya gaya... yah baat laptop computer par upabhokta bazaar maulik roop se vividhtapurna hoga...""  This translates to ""Taking into account savings and convenience, the Asus Eee PC was introduced worldwide... this matter will fundamentally become diverse in the consumer market on laptop computers...""
"
Kiski wajah se dock dastaavezon khoye the?,"The correct answer is **C: Ladka**.

The passage states: ""Ladkene naye saal ke 429 postcard sahit 600se zyada dock dastaavezon ko chhipaaya tha, jo unke ichchit praaptakrta ko nahin die gaye the.""  This translates to ""The boy had hidden more than 600 postal documents, including 429 New Year's postcards, which were not delivered to their intended recipients.""

Therefore, the boy is responsible for the missing postal documents.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, khoye hue dastaavezon ke liye kisne maafinama likha?","The correct answer is **D: Obnazwa post office**.

The passage states: ""Call, **dakgharne nagrikon aur media ko apni maafee jaari ke**..."" which translates to ""The post office issued an apology to citizens, the media, and..."".  Therefore, the Obnazwa post office issued the apology for the missing documents.
"
Potro ne kab apne kandhe ka ilaaj karvaaya?,"The correct answer is **B: Pehle tyee break se pehle**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Potrone is point par apne kandhe ka ilaaj karvaaya lekin khel mein vaapsee karne mein kamyab rahe."" This translates to ""Potro got his shoulder treated at this point but managed to return to the game."" The ""this point"" refers to the point *before* the third technical break.  The passage also mentions he had a technical break at 6-6. Therefore, he got treatment *before* the break at 6-6.
"
Pehle tyee break ka kya natiza tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Marey pahala sett haar gaye** (Marey lost the first set).

The passage states: ""Sett mein ek-ek service dono purushon ke paas rahne ke baad marey tyee breaker mein pahala sett haar gaya."" This translates to ""After each of them held their serve in a set, Marey lost the first set in a tie-breaker.""

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Del Potro apni chot ki wajah se haar gaye** (Del Potro lost due to his injury) - Del Potro didn't lose. He had an injury but returned to play.
* **C: Marey ne dusra sett jeeta** (Marey won the second set) - The passage mentions a tie-breaker in the first set, not the second.  It also doesn't say Marey won the second set.
* **D: Del Potro ne dusra sett jeeta** (Del Potro won the second set) - The passage does *not* say Del Potro won the second set.

"Passage ke hisab se, kon vishesh rup se ak rogi ke sampark mein aya tha?","The correct answer is **B: Bachch (Children)**.

The passage states: ""aaj, hamein pata chalaa hai ki kuch schooly umr ke bachchon ke pehchaan hui hai jinka rogise sampark tha"" which translates to ""today, we found out that some school-aged children have been identified who have had contact with the disease.""  This directly indicates that children were specifically identified as having been in contact with the disease.

"Passage ke hisab se, Governor ne Texas ke logon ko kya bharosa dilaaya?","The correct answer is **B: Logon ki suraksha ke liye kaam kiye jaa rahe hain** (Work is being done for the safety of the people).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states, ""Una adhikariyon ke saath unhone texas ke logon ko bharosa dilaaya ki unaki suraksha ke liye kadam uthaaye jaa rahe hain."" (Along with the officials, they reassured the people of Texas that steps are being taken for their safety.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: System acche se kaam kar raha hai** (The system is working well): The Governor *denies* this, saying the system is *not* working as expected.
* **C: We chunauti ka samna karne ke liye taiyar hain** (We are ready to face the challenge): While he mentions the challenge, this isn't the primary reassurance he gives.
* **D: Mamla gambhir nahin hai** (The matter is not serious): The passage explicitly states ""yah mamla gambhir hai"" (this matter is serious).



"
UW ke do purva chaatron ne konsa samachar parody source banaya tha?,"The correct answer is **D: Tha aniyan**.

The passage states: ""Dha deli show aur dha colbert reportse bahut pehle, jab way 1988 mein uw mein chhaatr the, toh heck aur johnsonne ek prakashan ke kalpana ke, jo samachar aur samachar reporting ke parody karega -. Apni asthapna ke baadse, dha aniyan print sanskaran ke saath ek satya samachar parody samrajya bn gaya hai..."" This directly identifies ""Dha aniyan"" as the news parody source created by the former students of UW.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inms se kon Tha anyian ke samachar parody samrajya mein shaamil nhin hai?","The correct answer is **B: Film**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly lists the following components of The Onion's media empire:

*   Print edition
*   Website
*   24-hour news network
*   Podcasts
*   The ""Our Dumb World"" world atlas

A film is not mentioned as part of their operations."
"Passage ke hisab se, police kiski suraksha kar rahi thi?","The correct answer is **C: Downing Street ke darwaaje**.

The passage states that the protest started in front of the police-guarded door of Downing Street, where the Prime Minister's official residence is located. Therefore, the police were securing the Prime Minister's residence.

While protesters moved to Trafalgar Square and the Grand Cannot Room Hotel, the initial and primary point of conflict was at Downing Street.
"
Police ne traffic se bachane ke lie virodh karne waale logon ko kis samay hatane ke lie kaha?,"The correct answer is **D: 11:20 baje**.

The passage states: ""11:20 par, policene pradarshankariyon ko yah kahte hue footpath par vaapas jaane ke liye kahaa ki unhein bhid ikattha karne ke saath virodh karne ke adhikar ko santulit karne ke zaroorat hai."" This directly translates to police telling protesters to go back to the footpath around 11:20."
Dr. ehood ke kiye gaye shodh ke bare mein kya sach hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Madhumeh se pidit kuch choohon ko ab madhumeh nhin hai**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Unhone aagaah kiya ki shodh abhi bhi apne shuruati dino mein hai. kuch any visheshagyon ke tarah, unhein is baat par sandeh hai ki kya madhumeh ko thik kiya jaa sakta hai, yah dekhte hue ki in nishkarshon ke una logon ke liye koi prasangikta nahin hai jinhen pahle se hi type 1 madhumeh hai."" This directly confirms that they have found mice that *had* diabetes but *no longer do*.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ye nishkarsh unke liye faydemand ho sakte hain Jinhe pahle se type 1 madhumeh hai:** The passage explicitly says these results are *not* relevant to people with type 1 diabetes.
* **C: Unhe bharosa hai ki nishkarshon se ilaaj ho sakta hai:** Dr. Ehood expresses *doubt* about whether diabetes can be cured.
* **D: Jin choohon ko madhumeh nhin tha unhe ab madhumeh hai:** The passage talks about mice that *had* diabetes, not mice that didn't.



"
Passage ke hisab se Dr. Ur ko kis baat mein sandeh hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Madhumeh ko thik kiya jaa sakta hai**.

The passage states: ""...unhein is baat par sandeh hai ki kya madhumeh ko thik kiya jaa sakta hai..."" This directly translates to ""they have doubts about whether diabetes can be cured...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nishkarsh type 1 madhumeh wale logon ke liye prasangik hai:** The passage explicitly says the findings are *not* relevant for people with type 1 diabetes.
* **C: Ilaaj ke sambandh mein any visheshagyon kee raay:** Dr. Ur's doubt is about the possibility of curing diabetes itself, not about other specialists' opinions.
* **D: Jin choohon ko madhumen nhin hai ve aise hi rahenge:** While the passage mentions the mice without diabetes, it's not the subject of Dr. Ur's doubt.  His doubt is about curing the disease.



"
Inme se konsa kathan flight cg4684 ki Durghatna ka sahi vranan nhin karta hai?,"सही उत्तर है: **C: Durghatana hone se pehle flight ne teen baar land karne ki koshish ki**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

पाठ में कहा गया है कि फ्लाइट ने *पहले ही* (ek baar pehle hi) लैंडिंग का प्रयास रद्द कर दिया था। यह इंगित करता है कि लैंडिंग का प्रयास केवल एक बार ही किया गया था। विकल्प C में कहा गया है कि फ्लाइट ने तीन बार प्रयास किया था, जो पाठ से मेल नहीं खाता।

अन्य विकल्प पाठ में दी गई जानकारी के अनुरूप हैं:

*   **A:** पाठ कहता है कि खराब मौसम के कारण लैंडिंग संभव नहीं थी।
*   **B:** पाठ बताता है कि दुर्घटनास्थल एक दुर्गम स्थान पर पाया गया था।
*   **D:** पाठ कहता है कि खराब मौसम ने खोज को प्रभावित किया।"
Flight CG4684 kis wajah se land nhi kar paya?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Mausam kharab tha**।

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से उल्लेख किया गया है कि ""Khoj meinus kharab mausam ke karan rukawat paida hui thi jiski vajah se landing nahin ho paayee thi।"" जिसका अर्थ है कि खराब मौसम के कारण खोज में बाधा आई और लैंडिंग नहीं हो पाई।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: Landing sthan durgam tha** - दुर्गम स्थान की बात की गई है, लेकिन यह लैंडिंग न हो पाने का सीधा कारण नहीं है।
*   **B: CG4684 ke aage kai anya flight the** - इस बारे में कोई जानकारी नहीं है।
*   **C: Flight ko phir se kokoda bheja gaya** - यह कथन पाठ में कहीं नहीं दिया गया है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, franciszek koval ke anubhav ke bare mein konsa kathan sach hai?","The correct answer is **B: Unhe kuch nhin hua tha**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""Una shishonse ek shisha aakhirkar toot gaya, aur unhone khidkise baahar nikalana shuru kar diya, jeevit bache franciszek kovalne kahaa.""  This translates to: ""One of those panes of glass finally broke, and he began to get out of the window, alive said Franciszek Kowal.""
* The sentence clearly indicates that Franciszek Kowal is *alive* and getting out of the window. This implies he didn't get hurt.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unhone khidaki todi** (He broke the window) - The passage says a pane of glass broke, not that he broke the window.
* **C: Bahar nikalte samay unhone kursi todi** (He broke a chair while getting out) - There's no mention of him breaking a chair.
* **D: Khidki todte samay unhe chot lagi** (He got hurt while breaking the window) - The passage states he is alive, indicating he did not get hurt.



"
Ushnakatibandhiya toofan denial ke sambhaavit prabhaav ka aaklan karna mushkil kyun hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Toofan bhuskhalanse bahut door hai**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Choonki toofan bhuskhalanse bahut door hai, isliye sanyukt rajya america yaa carribean mein sambhaavit prabhaav ka aaklan karna mushkil hai.""  (Because the storm is far away, it is difficult to assess the potential impact in the United States of America or the Caribbean.)

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Toofan shaktishali toofan ka roop le lega:** This describes a *future* possibility, not a reason for difficulty in assessment.
* **B: Toofan ki tez havaaon ke baare mein vaigyaanik anishchit hain:** The passage doesn't mention any scientific uncertainty about the storm's wind speeds.
* **D: Toofan Miami se bahut door hai:** While Miami's distance is mentioned, the overall distance from the location where impact assessment is being done is the key factor.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Ushnakatibandhiya toofan denial ke bare mein inme se konsa kathan sahi nhin hai?","The correct answer is **D: yah bhuskhalanse ke pass hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Choonki toofan bhuskhalanse bahut door hai, isliye sanyukt rajya america yaa carribean mein sambhaavit prabhaav ka aaklan karna mushkil hai.""  This directly contradicts option D, which claims the storm is *near* Bhuskhalanse. The passage explicitly says it's far away.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Carribean mein iske sambhaavit prabhaav ke bare mein koi jankari nhin hai:** The passage states that assessing potential impact on the Caribbean is difficult due to the storm's distance.
* **B: Atlantic mahasagar mein banaa hai:** The passage explicitly states this.
* **C: Yah shaktishali toofan ka roop le sakta hai:** The passage states that National Hurricane Center scientists anticipate it becoming a strong storm by Wednesday.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, vaishvik mahamari banne se pehle bimari ke sath kya karne ka sujhav diya gaya hai?","The correct answer is **A: Ise kam ghatak banana hoga (It should be made less lethal)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Kuch adhyayanonse pata chalta hai ki vaishvik mahamari ka karan bananese pehle bimari kam ghaatak ho sakti hai.""  This translates to: ""Some studies suggest that the disease could be made less lethal before it becomes a global pandemic.""  This directly implies that the suggestion is to reduce the disease's severity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: lakshan halke bane rahene chaiye (Symptoms should remain mild):** While the passage mentions concern about mild symptoms allowing continued spread, it doesn't directly suggest *maintaining* mild symptoms. The concern is about the potential for the virus to mutate and become more dangerous later.
* **C: Zyada logon ko sankramit karne ki jarurat hai (There is a need to infect more people):**  This is the opposite of what the passage implies.  The concern is about preventing further spread.
* **D: Bacchon mein lakshan dikhane chaiye (Symptoms should appear in children):** The passage doesn't mention anything about symptoms appearing in children.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, toofan fujian se kitni door tha?","The correct answer is **C: 70 kilometers**.

The passage states: ""morakote ke aankh (kendra) chini praant fujianse lagbhag sattar kilometres door thi."" which translates to ""the eye (center) of the storm was approximately seventy kilometers away from Fujian province.""
"
George W. Bush ke asia aagman par unka swaagat kisne kiye tha?,"The correct answer is **C: Wong Kan Seng aur Lee Hsien Loong**.

The passage states: ""unka singapur ke up-pradhan mantri wong kana sengne swaagat kiya aur unhone singapur ke pradhaanmantri liye sien lung ke saath vyapar aur aatankvaad ke mamle par baatchit kiya."" This directly translates to ""Singapore's Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng welcomed him and he discussed trade and terrorism issues with Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong."""
Rashtrapati ne asia ke vyapar ke vistaar ke baare mein kab baat ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Apne madhyaavadhi chunaav haarne ke baad**.

The passage states: ""Madhyaavadhi chunaav mein ek hafte tak haarne ke baad, bushesne logon ko asia mein vyapar ke vistaar ke baare mein bataaya."" (After losing in the midterm elections for a week, bushes spoke to people about expanding trade in Asia.)

While he spoke about Asia during his visit, the passage specifically links the discussion about trade expansion to his recent election loss.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se sarkar ka lakshya kya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Gaadiyon mein bhidbhaad kam ho (To reduce congestion)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the government promised financial aid for vehicles to alleviate congestion (""bhidbhaad se nijaat mill sake""). The purchase of 1300 vehicles is explicitly mentioned as a step *to* achieve this goal.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Is saal march mein aur vaahanon ko vittiya madad de (To provide financial aid to more vehicles this March):** This is only *part* of the government's plan, not the overarching goal.  The aim is to reduce congestion.
* **B: Kul 300 gaadiyan mangwaye (To procure a total of 300 vehicles):** This is incorrect. The passage mentions 1300 vehicles being procured, not 300.
* **C: 1300 aur gaadiyan mangwaye (To procure 1300 more vehicles):**  This is a *means* to the end, not the end itself. The end is reducing congestion.



"
Sarkar ne kya ghoshna ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Ve 1300 aur gaadiyon ki vittiya madad ki yojna bana rahe hain**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""...1,300 gaadiyan jo mangwai gayi hain ae taakin bhidbhaadse nijaat mill sake."" ( ...1,300 vehicles that have been ordered so that relief from congestion can be obtained.)
* The announcement is about fulfilling the government's promise to provide financial assistance for these 1,300 vehicles.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Ve 300 aur gaadiyon ki vittiya madad ki yojna bana rahe hain** - The passage mentions 1300 vehicles, not 300.
* **B: Unhone gaadi ki samasya se nijaat dilane ka vaada kiya** - While the promise was to provide relief from congestion, the announcement specifically focuses on the financial aid for the vehicles themselves.
* **D: March tak bhidbhaad ki samsya ka nijaat milega** - The passage says the promise *was* to provide financial aid *in March*, but the announcement is about the fulfillment of that promise and the specific vehicles involved.



"
Is passage se kya jaankari milti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Khatare ka star kam ho gaya hai** (The level of danger has decreased).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...kam karne ke matlab yah nahin hai ki saaraa khatra tall gaya hai"" which translates to ""...decreasing it doesn't mean all the danger is eliminated.""
* The statement also says: ""Usane kahaa, """"is baat ko bataane waali koi gupta suchna nahin hai ki nikat bhavishya mein kisi hamale ke ashanka hai."""" "" which translates to ""He said, ""There is no hidden information to indicate the possibility of an attack in the near future."""" This means while there's no *hidden* information, the *possibility* of an attack isn't completely ruled out, implying the danger level has reduced, but isn't zero.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Khatra tall gaya hai** (Danger is eliminated) - The passage directly contradicts this.
* **C: Hamale ke ashanka hai** (There is a possibility of an attack) - The passage states there's no hidden information about an attack.  While the possibility isn't *completely* gone, it isn't stated as a certainty either.
* **D: Gupta suchna ke mutabik hamla behad khatarnak hoga** (According to hidden information, the attack will be extremely dangerous) - The passage explicitly states there's *no* hidden information suggesting extreme danger.



"
Virodh pradarshan ke mamle mein konsa kathan sahi nhin hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Virodh pradarshanon mein purv CEP ke tyagpatra ki maang ki gayi** (Protests demanded the resignation of the former CEP).

Here's why:

* **The passage states the presidential commission investigated the resignation of the previous CEP.** It doesn't say the protests *demanded* the resignation. The protests were a reaction to the commission's investigation and the potential for new elections.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: Presidential commission, virodhi pradarshanon ki pratikriya thi** (Presidential commission was a reaction to the protests) - This is explicitly stated in the passage.
* **B: Samay se pehle hue chunnav ki wajah se virodh shuru hue** (Protests started due to early elections) - The passage mentions that the widespread protests began in October, coinciding with the efforts to hold new elections.
* **D: Virodh kai baar hinsak roop le lete hain** (Protests often take a violent form) - The passage says that violent opposition started due to delays in holding elections *after 2011*. While not explicitly stating the protests *are* often violent, it implies it's a recurring issue.



Therefore, option C is the only statement that is not directly supported by the text.



"
Poorv CEP ke poorv tyagpatra ka sujhav kisne diya?,"The correct answer is **C: Presidential commission**.

The passage states: ""pichle mahine ek presidential commissionne desh ko naye chunaavon ke or badhane ke upaay ke pekage ke ek hisse ke roop ke roop mein cep ke poorv tyagpatra ke anushansa ke."" This translates to ""Last month, a presidential commission recommended the dissolution of the previous CEP as part of a package to move the country towards new elections.""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Nassar ka atheletes ke sath durvyavhar karne ke baad se US gymnastics kis cheez ka samarthan nhin karta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Vipramanan (Discrediting)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""us gymnastics ek swatantra jaanch ka samarthan karta hai jo is baat par prakash daal sakta hai ki larry nasser ke bache logon dwara itni himmatse bataae gaye proportion ka durupyog itane lambe samay tak chal sakta tha aur kisi bhi aavashyak aur uchit parivartan ko apna sakta tha.""  This shows they *don't* support discrediting the issue or the athletes who came forward. The passage emphasizes change and a safe environment, the opposite of discrediting.

The passage *does* support:

*   **Sashakt vatavaran banana (Creating an empowering environment)**
*   **Sangathan mein jaruri badalaav (Necessary changes within the organization)**
*   **Swatantra jaanch (Independent investigation)**



"
"Passage ke hisab se, US gymnastics aur sanyukt rajya olympic samiti, dono ka mukhya lakshya kya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Athletes ke liye sashakt vatavaran banana (To create an empowering environment for athletes)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""US gymnastics aur USOC ka ek hi lakshya hai -- athletes ko surakshit, sakaratmak aur sashakt vatavaran mein apne sapanon ka anusaran karne ke liye gymnastics aur any logon ke khel ko jitna sambhav ho sake utna surakshit banana."" (US gymnastics and USOC share the same goal - to make gymnastics and other sports as safe as possible so that athletes can pursue their dreams in a safe, positive, and empowering environment.)

While the passage mentions other points like supporting a safety investigation and acknowledging the importance of the Olympic family, the overarching and primary goal of both organizations, according to the passage, is to empower athletes.
"
Ghatna ke dauran jahaaz kahan tha? ,"The correct answer is **C: Palawan**.

The text states: ""Avenger class mine countermazer ship...yah jahaaz palwan ke pyarto princessa ke raaste mein tha."" (This ship...was in the path of the Palawan Princess.)
"
Passage ke hisab se jahaaz ke baare mein konsi baat sahi nhin hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Yah Palawan mein hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Avenger class mine countermazer ship, yah jahaaz palwan ke pyarto princessa ke raaste mein tha."" This translates to ""Avenger class mine countermazer ship, this ship was on the route of Palawan's Princess.""

The question asks which statement is **incorrect**. The passage explicitly says the ship was *on the route of* Palawan's Princess, not *in* Palawan.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: yah Puerto Princesa ke raste mein tha:** The passage states it was on the route of Palawan's Princess. Palawan is a province in the Philippines, and Puerto Princesa is a city within Palawan. So, this is consistent with the passage.
* **C: Yah mine countermazer ship hai:** The passage explicitly calls it an ""Avenger class mine countermazer ship.""
* **D: Ise U.S nevi ke saatven bede ko saunpa gaya tha:**  The passage states, ""Ise us nevi ke saatven bede mein tainaat kar diya hai..."" which translates to ""It has been assigned to the Seventh Fleet of that navy...""  This implies it was given to the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet.



Therefore, the only incorrect statement is that the ship is *in* Palawan. It's on a route *through* Palawan.
"
America ki sena ke sambhand mein kisne bayaan diya tha?,"The correct answer is **A: Donald Trump**.

The passage states that US President Donald Trump made the announcement in a press briefing."
"Passage ke hisab se, bandi lasaakon ki suraksha ki zimmedari kis desh ne sambhali?","The correct answer is **D: Turke**.

The passage states: ""Turkene isis ke ladaakon ko pakadana aur nigrani karna shuru kar diya hai..."" which translates to ""Turkey has begun to capture and monitor ISIS fighters...""

Therefore, Turkey is responsible for the safety of the captured ISIS fighters according to the passage.
"
Durghatna ka kya karan mana jaa raha hai?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Aapsi dushmani**

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से उल्लेख है कि ""इसकी वजह आपसी दुश्मनी को माना जाता है।"" इसका अर्थ है कि दुर्घटना का कारण आपसी दुश्मनी माना जा रहा है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: कठोर इलाके:** यह दुर्घटना का कारण नहीं है, बल्कि दुर्घटनास्थल को खोजने में एक चुनौती है।
*   **C: पहाड़ी इलाके:** यह स्थान है जहां दुर्घटनाएं हुईं, लेकिन यह कारण नहीं है।
*   **D: खराब मौसम:** यह भी एक चुनौती है, लेकिन दुर्घटना का मुख्य कारण नहीं।"
Durghatna kis tarah ke ilake mein hui?,"The correct answer is **D: Pahadi (Mountainous)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Pahadi ilaakon mein zyada durghatna hui"" which translates to ""More accidents occurred in the mountainous regions."" 

Therefore, the accidents happened in mountainous areas.
"
Baadh ki wajah se adhikari kya ummid kar rahe hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Sandars ki bahali (Restoration of sandbars)**.

The passage states: ""although the water level after the flood will only rise a few feet, officials hope that this will be enough to rehabilitate the sandbars in the lower layer.""  This directly indicates that the officials are hoping for the restoration of the sandbars.
"
Baandh ke nirmaan ke baad inme se kis par sthayi roop se asar hua?,"सही उत्तर है **A: Sandbars (तटबंध)**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

पाठ में कहा गया है कि ""अधिकारी उम्मीद कर रहे हैं कि यह निचले अस्तर के रेत के तटबंधों (sandbars) को फिर से बहाल करने के लिए पर्याप्त होगा।"" यह दर्शाता है कि बांध के निर्माण के बाद रेत के तटबंधों पर स्थायी रूप से प्रभाव पड़ा है और अधिकारी उन्हें पुनर्स्थापित करने का प्रयास कर रहे हैं।

अन्य विकल्प सही नहीं हैं:

*   **B: Humpbek choob (हंपबैक चोब):** पाठ में कहा गया है कि हंपबैक चोब सहित दो प्रजातियाँ विलुप्त हो गई हैं, लेकिन यह स्थायी प्रभाव नहीं है, बल्कि एक परिणाम है।
*   **C: Wildlife habitats (वन्यजीव आवास):** वन्यजीव आवास पर प्रभाव पड़ा है, लेकिन पाठ में रेत के तटबंधों का पुनर्स्थापन एक विशिष्ट कार्य के रूप में उल्लेख किया गया है।
*   **D: Talachhat phail gaya (पूरे नदी में तलछट फैल गया):** तलछट का फैलाव एक घटना थी, लेकिन यह स्थायी प्रभाव नहीं है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, united states ko sambhavit hamlon ke baare mein kisne jaankari di?","The correct answer is **C: Agyaat srot (Unknown source)**.

The passage states: ""America ka kahna hai ki use ek **agyaat srotse** jaankari mili hai..."" which translates to ""America says that it received information from an **unknown source**...""
"
Inme se konsa kathan ativaadi ke hamle ki yojana ka sahi vrnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Do deshon ke pramukh sthalon par bum visphot (Bomb blasts at prominent places in two countries).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the US warning is about ""suicidal bombings"" planned in both **Kenya and Ethiopia**.
* It also mentions these bombings are targeted at ""prominent places"" (""pramukh sthalon"").

Therefore, option C accurately reflects both key elements of the threat described in the passage.
"
Inme se kon vakeel nhin hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Makis Triantafylopoulos**.

Here's why:

* **Sakis Kechagioglou** and **George Nikolakopoulos** are explicitly identified in the text as lawyers (""vakeel"").
* **Petros Mantouvalos** is described as a Member of Parliament *and* a lawyer (""sansad ke sadasya aur vakeel"").
* **Makis Triantafylopoulos** is a journalist (""patrakar"").  He reported on the corruption but is not a lawyer himself.



"
Greek kanuni samudaay ke bhitar kis samuh ke logon ko ek badey ghotale ka hissa nhin btaya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Patrakar (Journalists)**.

Here's why:

The passage states the scandal erupted *because* of information revealed by journalist Makis Trintaphelopos. This implies journalists were a key part in bringing the scandal to light, not being shielded from it. The other groups (judges, lawyers, solicitors) are explicitly mentioned as being involved in the corrupt activities.

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
India ne kitne wicket ganvaane?,"The correct answer is **B: 7**

The question states: ""Kaptan ka wicket ganvaane ke baad bharatne paari samaapti tak 7 wicket khokar kewal 36 rann hi banaae."" This translates to ""After losing the captain's wicket, Bharat scored only 36 runs while losing 7 wickets until the end of the innings.""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Paari mein sabse zyada score kya tha?","The correct answer is **A: 70 rann**.

The passage states: ""Robin uthappane kewal 41 gendon mein 11 chaukon aur 2 chhakkon ke madadse 70 rann banaa kar paari ka sarvochch score banaaya.""  This translates to: ""Robin uthappane scored 70 runs in just 41 balls with the help of 11 fours and 2 sixes, thus setting the highest score of the innings."" Therefore, 70 is the highest score of the innings.
"
Inme se konsa Addam Kardenne ki nirasha ka karan nhin hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Youn saamagree ke liye site ki nayi neeti**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Addam Kardenne expressed disappointment because:

* **Wells lied from the beginning:**  First, claiming it was for legal reasons.
* **Wells stalled on removing his comments:**  Claiming he was listening.
* **Wells lied about removing his comments:** Claiming he was listening even while delaying removal.

The passage mentions that a new policy is being considered *as a result* of the community's anger. This is a consequence, not a cause of Addam Kardenne's disappointment.  He was disappointed *because* of Wells' actions (or inactions and lies).
"
"Passage ke hisab se, site se kya hataya gaya?","Correct Answer: **A: Calla**

The passage explicitly states: ""apni calla ko hataane ke samay tak yah jataate hue ki wah hamari baat soon rahaa tha.""  This translates to ""while stating that he was listening to us while removing his calls.""  Therefore, ""calla"" (calls) was removed.

The other options are incorrect:

* **B: Youn saamagree (Such content):** The passage mentions a policy proposal for content, but it doesn't say any specific content was removed.
* **C: Neeti ka masauda taiyar (Draft of a policy):**  The passage says a policy proposal *was being prepared*, not removed.
* **D: Nijee media (Private media):** The passage mentions the site hosts licensed media, not private media.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Amir Khan inme se kiska samarthan nhin karte hain?","The correct answer is **A: Olympic mein mhilaaon fighters**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""mujhe dilse lagata hai ki mahilaaon ko ladaai nahin karni chaahiye. Aisi merry rae hai"" (I sincerely believe that women should not fight. It's such a view). This indicates that Amir Khan does *not* support women fighting in the Olympics.

He *does* support British competitors (option B) and the Olympics in London (option D).  The passage doesn't give a clear indication of his opinion on women's views (option C), only that he disagrees with the view that women should fight. Therefore, option A is the only clear ""not"" in the context of the passage.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Amir Khan apni vyakitgat rayee ke baad inme se kiska samarthan karenge?","The correct answer is **C: 2012 olympics**.

Here's why:

The passage states that despite his comments against women fighting, Amir Khan said he *would support the British competitors in the 2012 Olympics in London*.  This directly indicates his support for the 2012 Olympics.  The other options are not supported by the text."
Peter Lenz ki mrityu kab hui?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Bike se girane ke baad**

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""Jab wah tez daudene jaa raha tha, tab lenz apni bikese gir gaya tha aur uske baad saathi racer zavier zyaat dwara maaraa gaya tha.""  इसका मतलब है कि Peter Lenz की मौत Bike से गिरने के बाद हुई।
"
Xavier Zayat kon hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Dusra racer (Other racer)**.

The passage states: ""tab lenz apni bikese gir gaya tha aur uske baad saathi racer zavier zyaat dwara maaraa gaya tha"" which translates to ""then Lenz's bike fell and after that, fellow racer Xavier Zayat hit him."" This clearly indicates Xavier Zayat is another racer.
"
"Kis sthithi mein ak ghabraye hue yatri ko vimaan ke kam karne ke tareeke aur udan ke dauran kya hota hai, is baare mein samjhane se phayda ho sakta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Udaan ke aise darr ko door karne mein jo agyaat hai.**

Here's why:

The paragraph explicitly states: ""kuch ke liye, vimaan ke kam karne ke tareeke aur udan ke dauran kya hota hai, is baare mein samajhna ek aise darr ko door karne mein madad kar sakta hai jo agyaat yaa niyantran mein naan hone par aadhaarit hai."" (For some, understanding how planes work and what happens during flight can help alleviate a fear based on the unknown or a lack of control.)

Option B directly reflects this sentiment.  It highlights the fear stemming from the unknown aspects of flying.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Agar yatri ko apne darr par sharam aati hai:** While the paragraph mentions it's okay to be afraid, the primary benefit of understanding flight isn't about overcoming shame.
*   **C: Agar yatri ko sabhi tarah ke vaahan se dar lagta ho:** The paragraph focuses specifically on fear of flying, not a general fear of vehicles.
*   **D: Agar unhe yatra ke dauran kisi dardnak ghatna ka saamana karna padaa ho:** While a past bad experience could contribute to fear, the paragraph focuses on fear of the *unknown* and lack of control, not solely on a past traumatic event.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Keemat ke prati jaagrook yatri ko inme se kya karna chaiye?","The correct answer is **C: Kai travel companies se price ki tulna karni chaiye**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions that ""Kabhi-kabhi vibhin aggregators par ek hi flight ke alag-alag moolya ho sakte hain"" (Sometimes, for the same flight, there can be different prices on different aggregators). It also states that ""khoj parinamon ke tulna karna laabhdaayak hota hai"" (comparing search results is beneficial).  This directly supports the idea of comparing prices across multiple travel companies (aggregators).

While options A, B, and D are partially correct, they don't fully capture the essence of the passage.  Comparing prices across multiple *companies* is the key advice given.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Yatri ko flight ka sabse accha offer dekhne ke liye kya karna chaiye?","The correct answer is **A: Airline ki website dekhni chaiye**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...booking se pehle airline ke swayam ke website bhi dekhna laabhdaayak hota hai."" (It is beneficial to also check the airline's own website before booking.)

While checking aggregators (B) is mentioned as something that *can* happen, the passage specifically emphasizes checking the airline's website.  The other options (C & D) are not mentioned as recommended actions in the passage.
"
Delivery ke liye ak sathi ki jarurat kab padti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jab air fret ke zariye chizon ko bheja jata hai** (When goods are sent via air freight).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that when using air freight, there can be delays in unloading and customs clearance.
* It then highlights the problem: airlines don't allow cargo without passenger baggage.
* This creates the need for a courier to accompany the shipment to facilitate the process and ensure timely delivery.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jab companiyan khud ke vimaan se chizon ko bhejati hain:** The text mentions that *large companies* have their own planes, but it frames this as an exception, not the general case.  The problem described is more relevant to smaller companies.
* **C: Jab chizon ko check kiye gaye saamaan ke roop mein bheja jata hai:** While the text mentions checking goods, it's the air freight process combined with airline regulations that creates the bottleneck.
* **D: Jab delivery ak badi company kar rahi ho:**  The size of the company isn't the determining factor; the method of shipment (air freight) and the associated regulations are.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kisi sandhi mein baar baar udaan ke liye airline chunte samay, apko inme se kise prathmikata deni chaiye?","सही उत्तर है **D: Wah airline jo atirikt phayde dete ho (वह एयरलाइन जो अतिरिक्त फायदे देते हो)**।

**व्याख्या:**

पैराग्राफ में कहा गया है कि लगातार उड़ान भरने वाली एयरलाइन को सावधानी से चुनना चाहिए क्योंकि एयरलाइनों द्वारा दी जाने वाली विशेष सुविधाएं अलग-अलग होती हैं। यह उन यात्रियों के दृष्टिकोण पर जोर देता है जो एक ही क्षेत्र में काम करने वाली विभिन्न एयरलाइनों से यात्रा करते हैं। इसका मतलब है कि आपको सिर्फ उस एयरलाइन को चुनने की बजाय जो आप अक्सर इस्तेमाल करते हैं (C), आपको उस एयरलाइन को चुनना चाहिए जो आपको अतिरिक्त लाभ प्रदान करती है (D)। 

अन्य विकल्प सही नहीं हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: Jo airline sabse zyada suvidha de (जो एयरलाइन सबसे ज्यादा सुविधा दे):**  यह बहुत व्यापक है। पैराग्राफ खास सुविधाओं (special amenities) पर जोर देता है, न कि सामान्य सुविधाओं पर।
*   **B: Sabse badi sandhi mein airline (सबसे बड़ी संधि में एयरलाइन):** पैराग्राफ में एयरलाइनों के बीच किसी संधि का उल्लेख नहीं है।
*   **C: Jis airline se aap aksar yatra karte hain (जिस एयरलाइन से आप अक्सर यात्रा करते हैं):** पैराग्राफ में सुझाव दिया गया है कि अक्सर यात्रा करने वाले यात्रियों के विचारों को महत्व देना चाहिए, लेकिन यह जरूरी नहीं है कि वे उसी एयरलाइन से यात्रा करें।

इसलिए, पैराग्राफ के अनुसार, आपको एयरलाइन चुनते समय अतिरिक्त लाभों (additional benefits) को प्राथमिकता देनी चाहिए।"
"Passage ke hisab se, kon baar baar sabse zyada suvidha de sakta hai?","सही उत्तर है **A: Alag-alag kshetra mein alag-alag airline**

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* **passage में कहा गया है कि** अक्सर यात्रा करने वाले यात्रियों की राय सबसे सटीक होती है जो एक ही क्षेत्र में काम करने वाली अलग-अलग एयरलाइंस से यात्रा करते हैं।
* **इसका मतलब है कि** विभिन्न क्षेत्रों में विभिन्न एयरलाइंस अलग-अलग सुविधाएं प्रदान करती हैं, और सबसे अच्छा विकल्प वह होगा जो आपको सबसे अच्छी सुविधाएं प्रदान करता है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

* **B और C:** passage के अनुसार, एक ही संधि में सबसे ज्यादा बार यात्रा करने वाली एयरलाइन का चयन करना सही नहीं है, क्योंकि वे अलग-अलग सुविधाओं की पेशकश नहीं कर सकती हैं।
* **D:** एक ही संधि में अलग-अलग एयरलाइंस का चयन करना समस्या का समाधान नहीं करता है, क्योंकि यह सुविधाओं के बारे में जानकारी प्रदान नहीं करता है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, atyadhik sharab pine se inme se konsi indriyaan kharab ho sakti hain?","The correct answer is **B: Dekhana (Seeing)**.

The passage explicitly states that excessive alcohol consumption can lead to **andhaapan (blindness)**.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, sharab ke haanikarak prabhav ko sambhavit roop se kaise kam kiya jaa sakta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Kam sharab peena**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""sharab har kisi ko alag alag tarah se prabhaavit karti hai, aur aapko apni seema ka pata hona bahut jaruri hai."" This highlights the importance of knowing one's limit and avoiding excessive consumption.
* The passage also mentions serious health consequences of excessive alcohol consumption like liver damage, blindness, and even death.
* While the passage warns against illegal alcohol (B), it doesn't suggest it as a way to *reduce* harm.
* Option A is clearly incorrect as drinking methanol-containing alcohol is extremely dangerous.
* Option D is irrelevant to reducing harm.

Therefore, drinking in moderation (kam sharab peena) is the only option directly supported by the passage as a way to mitigate the harmful effects of alcohol."
Amsterdam mein sampatti ka moolya sabse zyada kahan hain?,"The correct answer is **A: Canal District**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Pure zile ko unke adbhut saanskritik aur aitihaasik moolya ke liye unesco world heritage site ke tarah design kiya gaya hai, aur **iski sampatti ka moolya desh ke sarvocch moolyon mein se ek hai.**""

This translates to: ""The entire district has been designed as a UNESCO World Heritage site for its unique cultural and historical value, and **its property is one of the highest values in the country.**""

The property value is specifically attributed to the Canal District (Canal District), making option A the direct and accurate answer. While the Canal District *is* a UNESCO World Heritage Site (option B), the sentence emphasizes the property value *of the district itself*. Options C and D are incorrect as they are not directly supported by the text.
"
Canal district ko UNESCO World Heritage Site ke roop mein kyun naamit kiya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Saanskritik aur aitihaasik moolya (Cultural and historical value)**.

The text explicitly states that the canal district was designed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site ""for its unique cultural and historical value."" Options B and C are not mentioned in the text. Option D is true, but not the *reason* for the UNESCO designation.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kya chiz Fnome chrome ki yatra ko sarthak banati hai?","The correct answer is **A: Tonle Sap par nazare (Views on Tonle Sap)**.

The passage states: ""Mandir ka suunaa vatavaran aur **toneley sap jhil ke oopar ka drishya pahadi ke chadhaai ko saarthak banaata hai**."" (The serene atmosphere of the temple and the **view over the Tonle Sap lake makes the climb up the hill worthwhile**.)

While the other options might be relevant to visiting the area, the passage specifically links the views over Tonle Sap lake to making the climb to the temple worthwhile.  The Angkor Pass is required for entry, but doesn't directly make the *experience* of the climb worthwhile.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, yatri ko Fnome chrome mein pravesh karne ke liye kis chiz ki zaroorat padati hai?","The correct answer is **C: Angkor Pass lena**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Jab aap toneley sape ke or bada rahe hone, toh apne saath passport laana naa bhoolen kyonki mandir mein pravesh ke liye angkor paas ke zaroorat padati hai."" (When you are heading towards Tonle Sap, don't forget to carry your passport because an Angkor Pass is required to enter the temple.)
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kya chiz paryatak ko Antarctica jaane se rok sakti hai?","सही उत्तर है: **A: Vyaapak yatra bajat (व्यापक यात्रा बजट)**

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* **Passage में कहा गया है:** ""Paryatakon ka dora mahanga hai"" जिसका अर्थ है कि पर्यटकों के लिए यात्रा महंगी है।
* **अन्य विकल्प क्यों गलत हैं:**
    * **B: Ross saagar ghumne ki ruchi (रोस सागर घूमने की रुचि):** Passage में कहा गया है कि यात्रा कुछ क्षेत्रों तक सीमित है, लेकिन रुचि एक बाधा नहीं है।
    * **C: Kaam ka schedule, jiski wajah se sirf December aur January mein ghum sakte hain (काम का शेड्यूल, जिसकी वजह से सिर्फ दिसंबर और जनवरी में घूम सकते हैं):** Passage में कहा गया है कि शारीरिक फिटनेस की मांग केवल सर्दियों में ही होती है, न कि किसी विशिष्ट काम के शेड्यूल के कारण।
    * **D: Shaaririk fitness ki kami (शारीरिक फिटनेस की कमी):** Passage में शारीरिक फिटनेस की कमी को एक बाधा के रूप में नहीं बताया गया है, बल्कि यह उल्लेख किया गया है कि शारीरिक फिटनेस की मांग केवल सर्दियों में ही होती है।

इसलिए, Passage के अनुसार, पर्यटन को Antarctica जाने से रोकने वाली चीज व्यापक यात्रा बजट है।"
Parvataarohan mein ruchi rakhane wale payatak Antarctica ke kis hisse ki yatra kar sakte hain?,"सही जवाब है **B: Antardeshiya ilaka**।

कारण:

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""Parvataarohan ke liye yaa dhruv tak pahunchane ke liye kabhi-kabhi visheshagya antardeshiya hawai yatra karte hain, jiska ek bada aadhar hai।"" (पर्वतारोहण के लिए या ध्रुव तक पहुंचने के लिए कभी-कभी विशेष अज्ञात हवाई यात्रा करते हैं, जिसका एक बड़ा आधार है।)  यह दर्शाता है कि पर्वतारोहण और ध्रुव तक पहुंचने के लिए एंटार्कटिका के अज्ञात क्षेत्र का उपयोग होता है।

अन्य विकल्प:

* **Ross sagar, Updweep, Dweep:** ये केवल उन क्षेत्रों का उल्लेख हैं जहाँ ग्रीष्मकाल में कर्मचारी रहते हैं और पर्यटन सीमित है, लेकिन पर्वतारोहण के लिए मुख्य क्षेत्र नहीं हैं।"
Aadhunik callse pehle ke vedhashaalaa kahan hone ki sabse kam sambhavana hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Aasani se paunchane wali jagah (Easily accessible place)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that ancient observatories are often placed in areas that are *easily accessible* because they are often in or near cities where they are easier to reach compared to modern constructions. However, the passage also mentions that because they were built before modern light pollution, they are often in rural or remote areas where light pollution wasn't an issue.  

Therefore, an area that is ""easily accessible"" would be a *less likely* location for an ancient observatory, because they'd be placed in remote areas.  The other options (city center, remote area, college campus) are all mentioned as potential locations.



"
Aadhunik anusandhaan doorbeenon kahan rakhe jane ki sambhavna hai?,"The best answer is **A: sangrahalay (museum)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Choonki unaki shuruati dino mein prakash pradooshan aaj ke tarah ke samasya nahin thi, way aam taur par shaharon mein yaa parisaron mein sthit hain, jahaan aadhunik samay mein nirmit jagahon ke tulna mein pahunchana aasaan hota hain. Adhikansh aadhunik anusandhaan doorbeenon mein anukool vayumandaliya pariisthitiyon ke saath dooradraj ke kshetron mein kam karne ke liye bahut suvidhaaen hain."" This means ancient observatories are often located in accessible areas like cities or surroundings.
* The passage also says they are often kept in museums (""unhein sangrahalayon yaa shaikshanik asthanon ke tarah rakhaa jaataa hai"").
* While universities (B) and educational institutions (C) could house them, museums are a more common and direct location for preserving and displaying historical artifacts like observatories.
* Option D (""Ek badi suvidhaa"" - a big convenience) is not a specific location.

Therefore, museums are the most logical answer based on the provided text.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, shant samudri tat ke liye konsi Jaga sabse accha hai?","The correct answer is **B: Mission Bay**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Tamaki drive samudri tata Waitemata Harbour par, central Auckland mein Mission Bay aur St Heliers ke mahange upnagaron mein maujood hain... yekabhi-kabhi paarivaarik bhidbhaad vaale samudratat hain jahaan kinaaron par kayee dukanon ke ek achchi shrinkhala hai. Tairna surakshit hai.""

This translates to: ""The Tamaki Drive coastal area, on Waitemata Harbour, is located in the expensive suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers... These are often family-crowded coastal areas with a good chain of shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.""

While all options are mentioned as coastal areas, Mission Bay is specifically highlighted as a place where swimming is safe and often crowded with families, implying it's a good choice for those seeking a calm and safe swimming experience. The other options are either more general areas (Uttar harbour zile, Waitemata Harbor) or mentioned in relation to expensive suburbs (St Heliers).
"
"Passage ke hisaba, kis jaha tairna surakshit maanaa jaataa hai?","The correct answer is **A: Devonport**.

The passage states: ""ye zyaadaatar reit ke tat hain jahaan tairna surakshit maanaa jaataa hai. Inmein se zyadatarmein pohukutawa peon ke chhaaya rahati hai.""  This refers to the Northern Shore beach areas, and the passage specifically mentions **Devonport** as being part of the Northern Shore, and a generally safe place to swim. While other areas are mentioned as safe, Devonport is the only one explicitly stated with that characteristic.
"
Passage mein btayi gayi jagah par jate samay inme se kise sahi nhin mana jata hai?,"सही जवाब है: **B: Jagah ke aas paas koi kuch banaana**

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

पاسेज स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि ""चियों पर कुछ बनाकर या खरोंच कर इस जगह को नुकसान न पहुंचाएं।"" ""Jagah ke aas paas koi kuch banaana"" सीधे तौर पर इस निषेध के अंतर्गत आता है।

अन्य विकल्प Passage में उल्लेखित निषेधों के अनुरूप हैं:

* **A: Vyavhaar mein gambhirta (व्यवहार में गंभीरता):** Passage में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि इस जगह को सम्मान दें और व्यवहार में गंभीरता रखें।
* **C: Majak banana (मजाक बनाना):** Passage Holocaust और नाजी लोगों के बारे में मज़ाक करने पर रोक लगाता है।
* **D: Chizon ko kharonchna (चीजों को खरोंचना):** Passage में सीधे तौर पर चीजों को खरोंचने की मनाही है।"
Inme se konsa Samanya bhashaon ka varnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Praakritik (Natural)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Way samanya bhashase alag hain, jo any bhasha bolane vaalon ke beach sanchaar ke saadhan ke roop mein praakritik yaa jaivik bhaashaaen hain jo kisi karan yaa any vajah se haavi ho jaati hain.""

This translates to: ""They are different from common languages, which are natural or biological languages that serve as a means of communication between speakers of other languages and that become dominant for some reason or other.""

Therefore, ""Praakritik"" (natural) directly describes common languages. The other options are incorrect:

*   **Artificial:**  Defined as languages created by humans.
*   **Unnatural:**  This is a broad term and doesn't specifically define common languages.
*   **Banaai gayi (Manufactured/Made):**  Similar to artificial, this refers to created languages, not natural ones.



"
Inme se konsa kathan sahayak bhaasha ka sahi varnan karta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ye kathin sanchaar paridrshyon ko behatar banaane ke lie banaee gaee bhaashaen hain**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** Artificial languages are created to help people communicate who cannot easily communicate without them. This implies they are designed to improve communication in difficult situations.
* **Option C directly reflects this purpose.**
* **Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:**
    * **A:** While the passage mentions helping people communicate, it doesn't limit them to only biological languages where people can't easily understand each other. Artificial languages can be used for a variety of communication challenges.
    * **B:** The passage specifically mentions *artificial* languages, not a mix of artificial and natural.
    * **D:** The passage doesn't say artificial languages are created to be dominant languages between different language speakers. Their primary function is assistance.



Therefore, option C best captures the essence of what the passage describes as the purpose of auxiliary languages."
"Passage ke hisab se, sardiyon mein jahaz mein jaate samay kya dekhna chaiya?","The correct answer is **A: cabin ka sthan (cabin's location)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aap sardiyon mein uttari batlik ko paar karte hain, toh aapko cabin asthan ke jaanch karni hogi..."" which translates to ""If you cross the Northern Passage in winter, you need to check the cabin's location...""

While the passage mentions visas (""visa aavashyakta"") and conditions (""shartein""), the primary focus regarding what needs to be checked *specifically* for winter travel is the cabin's location. The mention of spending time in Potvihar and the exemptions from certain requirements are peripheral to the main point about winter travel.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, agar kisi yatri ki yatra garmiyon mein hai, to kya ve ise taal sakte hain?","The correct answer is **A: Shahar mein samay (Time in the city)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that people who are more affected by the cold will experience ""a very terrible noise"" while crossing the Northern Sea Route in winter.
* The passage then mentions that passengers traveling to Saint Petersburg (which is in the city) are exempt from certain requirements (conditions).
* The question asks if travelers can avoid the ""barf se gujarana"" (crossing the ice).  The passage implies that by spending time in the city (Saint Petersburg), travelers are exempt from some of the requirements related to crossing the ice in winter.  Therefore, they can avoid the ice crossing by spending time in the city.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Barf se gujarana (Crossing the ice):** The passage doesn't offer a way to *avoid* crossing the ice, only a way to be exempt from certain requirements *related to it*.
* **C: Visa aavashyakta (Visa requirements):**  The passage doesn't mention visa requirements.
* **D: Saint Petersburg:** While Saint Petersburg is mentioned, the passage doesn't directly state that spending time *in* Saint Petersburg avoids winter ice crossings. It implies that it is a way to be exempt from certain conditions.

Therefore, the best answer is **A: Shahar mein samay (Time in the city)**, because it's the most logical inference based on the information given.
"
Barcelona mein sanketon aur ghoshanaon ke liye aksar catalan ke istemal kyun kiya jata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Yah is sahar ki aadhikarik bhaasha hai** (This is the official language of the city).

The passage explicitly states: ""Haalaanki, zyaadaatar sanket sirf catalan mein hi ingit kiye jaate hain, kyonki yah kanunan vahan ke pahali aadhikarik bhasha hai."" (However, most signs are only written in Catalan because it is the first official language of the city by law.)

Option A is incorrect because the passage states Spanish is widely used. Option C states Catalan is more preferred, but the passage doesn't support this. Option D is not mentioned in the text."
Barcelona ki metro mein niyamit ghoshanaaen inme se kis bhasha mein hoti hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Catalan**.

The passage states: ""Metro mein niyamit ghoshanaaen kewal catalan mein hi ingit kiye jaate hain..."" which translates to ""Regular announcements in the Metro are only made in Catalan...""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kis suvidha ko luxury bistar aur nashte ko prathmikta diye jane ki sambhavna nhin hai?","Passage ke hisab se, luxury bistar aur nashte ko prathmikta diye jaane ki sambhavna **D: Tez speed wala wifi** mein nahin hai.

Passage bistar (bed), nashta (breakfast), antica saman (antique furniture), manikare maidan (Manikara field) aur swimming pool waali purani aitihaasik imarat (old historical building with a swimming pool) jaise shandar pratishthanon par dhyan dene ki baat karta hai. Wifi ki speed ka zikr nahi kiya gaya aur yeh luxury aur vilas se ekta tarah ka nahi hai jaise passge mein zikr kiya gaya hai.

Isliye, correct answer **D** hai."
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se konsi chiz luxury B&Bs ke beech pratispardha ke liye jaruri nhin hai?","The correct answer is **A: Adhunik sajavat (Modern decor)**.

Here's why:

* The passage emphasizes traditional elements like ""antic saman (antique furniture),"" ""manikare maidan (a historic courtyard),"" and ""purani aitihaasik imarat (old historical building).""  It suggests luxury is associated with historical charm and traditional aesthetics.
* While ""mausami nashte ke offer (seasonal breakfast offers)"" and ""sthaniya khana peena (local food and drink)"" are mentioned as desirable aspects, the passage strongly implies that the overall *setting* is a key differentiator for luxury B&Bs, aligning with the historical context.
* The passage explicitly states that guests should expect the ""sabse adhik vilasi bistar (most luxurious bed)"" which implies a focus on quality and perhaps traditional craftsmanship rather than just expense (though luxury beds *can* be expensive).  The phrase ""mahenge bistar (expensive beds)"" isn't directly mentioned as a requirement, but the emphasis is on *luxury*.

Therefore, ""adhunik sajavat"" directly contradicts the passage's focus on historical and traditional settings as a key component of luxury B&Bs.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se kya 2022 mein beijing mein Ayojit nhin kiya jayega?","The correct answer is **B: Taizicheng ski kshetra mein spardha**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that skiing events will be held in Zhangjiakou's Taiyicheng ski area, which is *near* Beijing, not *in* Beijing.
* The passage explicitly mentions that Beijing will host the opening ceremony, closing ceremony, and the Ice Sports events in Indore.

Therefore, the skiing competitions are located outside of Beijing.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, 2022 mein beijing mein inme se kiski mezbani ki jayegi?","Correct Answer: **C: Shitkaleen olympic**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""2022 mein chean ka beijing shahar olympic shitkaleen khelo ka mezban shahar hoga..."" which translates to ""In 2022, Beijing city will be the host city for the Winter Olympic Games...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Grishmakaleen olympic (Summer Olympics):** The passage states Beijing will host the *Winter* Olympics, not the Summer Olympics.
* **B: Indor barf ke spardha (Ice sports competitions):** While Beijing will host ice sports competitions in Jjangjiyakou, the passage doesn't say it's hosting *Indor* ice sports competitions specifically.  It just says ""Indor barf ke spardhaon ke mejbani karega"" (will host ice sports competitions).
* **D: Samaapan samaroh (Closing ceremony):** The passage states Beijing will host the closing ceremony, but it doesn't specify *only* the closing ceremony. It's part of hosting the Winter Olympics.



"
Avian influenza se sankramit hone ka sabse zayda jokhim kise hai?,"The correct answer is **C: murgi paalan karne wale** (Chicken farmers).

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Adhikansh log murgi paalan karte hain, lekin pakshi paalan mein kuch jokhim bhi hai.""  (Most people raise chickens, but there is also some risk in bird farming.) This directly links chicken farming to risk.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""Bird flue...pakshiyon aur standhaariyon dono ko sankramit kar sakta hai"" (Bird flu...can infect both birds and humans).  While poultry farmers are at risk, the general population is also exposed through interaction with poultry. 

While other options *could* be at risk, the passage specifically highlights the risk associated with chicken farming.  The text doesn't explicitly state that poultry farmers are *more* at risk than others, but it does emphasize the risk related to chicken farming.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, inme se konsa kathan bird flu ka sahi varnan karta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Pakshi paalan ka kaam karne wale logon ke liye sabse zayda jokhim hai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Pakshi paalan mein kuch jokhim bhi hai."" (There is also some risk in bird farming.) This directly supports option C.
* **Option A is incorrect:** The passage states that avian influenza can infect both birds and humans, not just those who work with chickens.
* **Option B is incorrect:** The passage explicitly says that *fewer* cases have been reported in humans compared to birds, and only *some* human cases have been severe.
* **Option D is incorrect:** The passage says *some* human cases have been severe, not *all*.



"
White see-baltic nahar kise jodati hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Arctic mahasagar aur baltic sagar**.

The passage states: ""White see-baltic nahar arctic mahasagar ko jyaadaatar nadiyon aur jhilon dwara baltic sagarse jodati hai..."" which translates to ""The White Sea-Baltic Canal mostly connects the Arctic Ocean to the Baltic Sea through rivers and lakes...""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kis tarah ke vaahan par passport ekatra kiya ja sakte hai, taki yatri ko koi pareshani na ho?","The correct answer is **B: Night sleeper trains**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Night sleeper trains par, conductor dwara passport ekatra kiya ja sakta hai taaki aapko apni neend mein bada naa aye."" (On night sleeper trains, the conductor can collect your passport so that you are not disturbed in your sleep.)

While passports are collected at other locations (planes, ships, cross-border trains), the passage specifically mentions night sleeper trains as a situation where passport collection is done to avoid disturbing the passenger.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kuch cross-border trains mein apke ID ka nireekshan kab kiya ja sakta hai?","The correct answer is **D: Chalti train mein**.

The passage states: ""kuch cross-border trains mein nireekshan chalati hui train mein kiya jaataa hai..."" which translates to ""in some cross-border trains, inspection is done in a running train..."" Therefore, the inspection can happen while the train is moving.
"
Singapur ke atyadhik ushnakatibandh kshetra mein rehane ke dauran inme se konsi samasya hone ki zyada sambhavna hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Garmi se thakavat (Heat exhaustion)**.

The passage explicitly states that Singapore is in the ""subtropical zone"" and experiences ""heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, which is most of the time).""  Therefore, heat exhaustion is the most likely problem to face.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Thage jana (Getting lost):** The passage says you can easily navigate Singapore.
* **B: Aasani se dukanon tak na paunch pana (Not being able to easily reach shops):** The passage says you can buy almost anything once you arrive.
* **D: Raste bhatak jana (Getting lost on the roads):** The passage says you can easily navigate.



"
German pastries kon nhin khana chahega?,"सही जवाब है: **A: Jise giri se gambhir allergy hai**

**व्याख्या:**

प्रश्न पूछ रहा है कि जर्मन पेस्ट्री कौन नहीं खाना चाहेगा। पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से बताया गया है कि कई जर्मन पेस्ट्री में बादाम, अखरोट और अन्य पेड़ों की गिरी होती है। इसलिए, यदि किसी को पेड़ों की गिरी से गंभीर एलर्जी है, तो वे इन पेस्ट्रीज नहीं खा पाएंगे।

अन्य विकल्प सही नहीं हैं क्योंकि:

*   **B: Jise zyada tasty mithaiyan pasand hain:** जर्मन पेस्ट्री स्वादिष्ट होती हैं और इन्हें पसंद किया जा सकता है।
*   **C: Jise choclate pasand nhin:** जर्मन पेस्ट्री में चॉकलेट भी हो सकती है, इसलिए यह ज़रूरी नहीं है कि चॉकलेट पसंद न करने वाला व्यक्ति इन पेस्ट्रीज को न चाहे।
*   **D: Jise namkeen ke mukable meetha pasand hai:**  जो लोग नमकीन के मुकाबले मीठा पसंद करते हैं, वे भी जर्मन पेस्ट्री का आनंद ले सकते हैं।"
German pastry mein konsi chiz mausam ke hisab se istemal hoti hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Plum**.

The passage states: ""Fruit pastry aam hain, jismein poore saal seb ko pakakar pastry banaai jaati hai, aur cherry aur plum garmiyon ke dauran dikhai dete hain."" which translates to ""Fruit pastry is common, in which apples are baked and used in pastries throughout the year, and cherries and plums are seen during the summers.""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, budget yatra ke liye inme se konsi salah ka sujhav nhin diya jata hai?","सही उत्तर है: **A: Yatra ke dauran naukri karna**

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* पैराग्राफ न्यूनतम बजट यात्रा के बारे में है, जिसका अर्थ है खर्चों को कम करना।
* पैराग्राफ विशेष रूप से उन गतिविधियों को प्रतिबंधित करता है जो दूसरों का शोषण करती हैं या अनैतिक हैं (चोरी, अवैध व्यापार, भिक्षा आदि)।
* जबकि अन्य विकल्प (अपनी सुविधाओं को त्यागना, खाने और रुकने पर खर्च कम करना, दूसरों से पैसे मांगना) न्यूनतम बजट यात्रा से जुड़े संभावित बलिदान या कम खर्चों का प्रतिनिधित्व करते हैं, नौकरी करना पैराग्राफ में बताए गए सिद्धांतों के अनुरूप नहीं है। पैराग्राफ का उद्देश्य दूसरों पर निर्भरता से बचना है, न कि काम करना।

इसलिए, पैराग्राफ में नौकरी करने की सलाह नहीं दी जाती है।"
Passage ke hisab se bahut kam budget mein yatra karne mein kise pareshani ho sakti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jise challenge pasand hain (Those who like challenges)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""for those who are willing to sacrifice comfort, time, and near-zero expenses, minimal budget travel is suitable."" This implies that minimal budget travel involves sacrifices and potential difficulties. People who enjoy challenges are more likely to embrace and tolerate these sacrifices. The other options are not directly supported by the passage."
Inme se konsa kathan marrian aur fairmont ke beach gaadi chalne ka sahi varnan nhin karta?,"सही जवाब है **D: Mobile phone seva ki samasya nhin honi chaiye**

यहाँ क्यों:

प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""pensylvania wilds जैसे रास्ते के कई हिस्सों के मुकाबले यहां मोबाइल फोन सेवा ज़्यादा बेहतर है।""  विकल्प D कहता है कि मोबाइल फोन सेवा की समस्या नहीं होनी चाहिए, जो कि प्रश्न के कथन के विपरीत है।

अन्य विकल्प सही रूप से वर्णन करते हैं:

*   **A: शहर से दूर गाड़ी चलाने का चुनौतीपूर्ण लंबा रास्ता:** प्रश्न में यह बताया गया है कि Buffello-Pittsburg से Fairmont के बीच का रास्ता चुनौतीपूर्ण और लंबा है, जो कि शहर से दूर है।
*   **B: Patali galiyaan:** प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि रास्ते में 'patali galiyaan' (साँकरी सड़कें) हैं।
*   **C: Gati seema ka palan bahut kam kiya jata hai:** प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि गति सीमाएं कम हैं और उनका पालन करना ज़रूरी है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, Buffello-pitsburg haaive par yatra karne wale driveron ke liye inme se kya mukhya chinta ka vishay hona chaiye?","Correct answer is **C: khatarnaak mod par teze se chalna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""steep grades, narrow lanes and dangerous curves."" This directly relates to the risk of driving too fast and encountering hazardous situations on sharp turns.
* **The passage mentions low speed limits:** ""speed limits are generally much lower – typically 35-40 mph (56-60 km/h)"" This reinforces the danger of speeding.
* **Other options are incorrect:**
    * **A: Bhari traffic mein phansna (Getting stuck in heavy traffic):** The passage doesn't mention traffic as a significant concern.
    * **B: Mobile phone seva ki samasya (Problems with mobile phone service):** The passage actually states the opposite: ""ironically, mobile phone service is better here than in many other parts of Pennsylvania wilds.""
    * **D: Baar baar sadak nirmaan ka samana karna (Constantly encountering road construction):** The passage doesn't mention road construction.



Therefore, the most significant concern for drivers on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Haive, according to the passage, is **driving too fast on dangerous curves.**



"
Canyoning shuru karne ke liye inme se kiski jarurart nhin hai?,"सही जवाब है **D: Kam prashikshan**।

यहाँ कारण दिए गए हैं:

* **P में कहा गया है कि Canyoning के लिए अपेक्षाकृत कम प्रशिक्षण या शारीरिक विकास की आवश्यकता होती है।** विकल्प D सीधे तौर पर इस कथन का खंडन करता है।
* अन्य विकल्प (A, B, और C) Canyoning में शामिल गतिविधियों (तैराकी, शारीरिक विकास, और कूदना) से जुड़े हैं, इसलिए Canyoning शुरू करने के लिए इनकी आवश्यकता हो सकती है।

इसलिए, Canyoning शुरू करने के लिए कम प्रशिक्षण की आवश्यकता नहीं होती है, बल्कि अन्य कारकों (जैसे तैराकी, शारीरिक विकास और कूदने की क्षमता) की आवश्यकता हो सकती है।"
Canyoning ke liye inme se kiski jarurart ho sakti hai?,"सही उत्तर है **D: तैरना आना**।

यहाँ क्यों:

* **Canyoning का सार पानी और सूखे घाटियों में उतरना है।** तैरना आना इस गतिविधि का एक बुनियादी कौशल है। 
* अन्य विकल्प उतने आवश्यक नहीं हैं:
    * **A: Advanced athletic (उन्नत एथलेटिक):**  Canyoning में उन्नत एथलेटिक क्षमताएँ मददगार हो सकती हैं, लेकिन यह अनिवार्य नहीं है। यह विभिन्न फिटनेस स्तरों के लोगों के लिए अनुकूलित किया जा सकता है।
    * **B: Scuba diving का पिछला अनुभव:** Scuba diving का अनुभव आवश्यक नहीं है। Canyoning में आमतौर पर scuba diving के लिए आवश्यक गहराई तक गोता लगाने की आवश्यकता नहीं होती है।
    * **C: Canyoning में सर्टिफिकेट:** हालांकि एक सर्टिफिकेट अच्छा होता है, लेकिन यह सभी शुरुआती लोगों के लिए आवश्यक नहीं होता है। एक योग्य गाइड के साथ शुरुआत करना और आवश्यक प्रशिक्षण लेना अधिक आम है।

इसलिए, **तेरना आना** Canyoning के लिए सबसे बुनियादी और आवश्यक कौशल है।
"
"Passage ke hisab se, apni kar mein camping ke liye kya upyogi hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Aisi seatein jinhe niche kiya jaa sake (Seats that can be folded down)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aapke paas ek badee minivan, suv, sedan yaa station wagon hai, jismein seeten niche ke jaa sakti hain, toh kar camping sambhav hai."" (If you have a large minivan, SUV, sedan, or station wagon where the seats can fold down, then car camping is possible.)

This directly indicates that the ability to fold down seats is a necessary requirement for car camping.  The other options are related but not as direct a requirement:

*   **A: Apni kar ki seemaon ki behatar samajh (Better understanding of your car's limits):**  While understanding your car's limits is important for any road trip, it's not specifically tied to car camping.
*   **C: tent (Tent):** The passage mentions ""tambu gaana"" (camping in a tent) but doesn't say a tent is *required* for car camping.  Car camping can involve sleeping *in* the car.
*   **D: Camp ke liy niji sampatti (Private property for camping):**  The passage mentions camping on private property, but car camping can also happen in public campgrounds or even just stopping somewhere scenic.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, agar kar camper radar ke niche rehna chahte hain to ve kisse bachana chahenge?","The correct answer is **C: Kisi sahar ya niji property par tent lagana**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Niji sampatti par yaa kisi bhi aakar ke shahar mein tambu gaana aasaanise binaa jarurat ke dhyan ko aakarshit kar sakta hai."" This translates to: ""It's easy to pitch a tent on private property or in any size city and it can easily attract unnecessary attention.""

The question asks what they would avoid to stay off the radar.  The passage explicitly says pitching a tent in cities or on private property attracts unwanted attention. Therefore, avoiding pitching a tent in those locations would help them stay out of sight.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Minivan ya suv jese badi gaadi chalana:** The passage suggests that having a larger vehicle *enables* car camping, not that avoiding it helps stay off the radar.
* **B: Lambi sadak yatra:** The passage actually promotes long road trips as a great use for a car.
* **D: Ve jis gaadi ko chala rahe hain uske baare mein zyada jankari na hona:** The passage implies knowing your car's capabilities is important for car camping.
"
Passage ke hisab se casablanca ka dusri baar nirmaan kisne kiya?,"The correct answer is **D: Morakko ke sultan**.

The passage states: ""Morakko ke sultanne shahar ko daru ll-baadya ke naamse phir se banaaya..."" (The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city under the name Dar-el-Baida...).
"
Prakratik apada ke baad adhunik shahar casablanca ko kisne chhoda?,"The correct answer is **B: Purtagaali**.

The passage states: ""Purtagaaliyonne ise khatm kar diya aur ise kasaa branca naamse isko phir se banaaya phir bhookamp ke baad ise 1755 mein chhod diya gaya."" (The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as Casa Branca, but it was abandoned in 1755 after the earthquake.)"
"Passage ke hisab se, sintara ko videshiyon ke beech pehchan kese mili?","The correct answer is **C: lord byron ki sakaratmak samiksha (Lord Byron's positive review)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""...jise lord byron dwara darj kiye gaye apne shandar carnamo ke baad videshiyon ke liye prasiddh kiya gaya tha."" ( ...which became famous among foreigners after being mentioned in the grand deeds recorded by Lord Byron.)

The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Cabo da Roca:** Cabo da Roca is a location, not the reason for Sintra's fame.
* **B: Marian apparitions:** While Sintra is known for Marian apparitions, the passage doesn't link this to its initial fame among foreigners.
* **D: romantic ithihaas (romantic history):** While Sintra has a romantic history, the passage specifically attributes its fame to Lord Byron's writings.



"
Armenia kise maanyata nahi deta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: nagorno-karabakh kshetra**.

The passage states: ""haalaanki, koi bhi sthaapit rashtra - yahaan tak ki armenia bhi - ise sarkari taur par maanyata nahin deta hai."" (However, no established state - even Armenia - officially recognizes it.)  ""Ise"" refers to the Nagorno-Karabakh region.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: azeris ke khilaaf yuddh:** The passage describes the war but doesn't say Armenia doesn't recognize it.
* **C: azerbaijan ke beach kootneetik turk:** This refers to a diplomatic issue, not something Armenia doesn't recognize.
* **D: nea ganarajya:** While the passage mentions the newly formed state, it's Armenia's recognition of the *region* that's the point.



"
Azerbaijan aur Armenia ke beach sambhandhin ko kisne bigaade rakha hai?,"The correct answer is **C: kootneetik turk (political Turks)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Praant ko lekar armenia aur azerbaijan ke beach kootneetik turk bigade sambandhon ko jaari rakhate hain"" which translates to ""The political Turks have been maintaining strained relations between Armenia and Azerbaijan regarding the region.""

While the 1994 war and the Nagorno-Karabakh region are *factors* contributing to the strained relationship, the text specifically identifies ""kootneetik turk"" as the actors who are keeping the relations bad.
"
"Shorlett me taxi ka istemal karte samay, kis wajah se surcharge badh sakta hai?","The correct answer is **B: teen yatri hone ki wajah se** (because of having more than two passengers).

The passage states: ""2 se zyada yatri hone par surcharge lagega..."" which translates to ""A surcharge will be applied for more than 2 passengers...""
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Shorlett me bachchon ke sath kyu nahi raha ja sakta?","Passage clearly states that Shorlett is a great place for families and children. It highlights the abundance of child-friendly options and the positive family environment. It also mentions that families typically don't use taxis in Shorlett. 

The question asks *why* children *cannot* be in Shorlett according to the passage. The passage *doesn't* say children can't be in Shorlett; it says it's a great place for them. 

Therefore, none of the options are directly supported by the passage. However, option **B: Taxi ka istemal (Taxi usage)** is the *closest* to being a potential constraint mentioned in the passage, although it's not a reason children can't be in Shorlett. The passage mentions taxi usage isn't common and can be expensive for larger groups.

**Since there is no correct answer in the options provided based on the passage, I would have to say the question is flawed.** If I *had* to choose the ""least incorrect"" answer, it would be B.

**However, a better answer would be: The passage does not indicate that children cannot be in Shorlett.**



"
"spainy logon ke aane se pehle, uttari chilly kinke adhin tha?","The correct answer is **D: Incas**.

The passage states: ""P: 16 ween shatabdi mein spainy logon ke aanese pehle, uttari chilly inka ke adhin tha..."" which translates to ""Before the arrival of the Spanish people in the 16th century, northern Chile was under the dominion of the Incas...""

While the Mapuche were significant in central and southern Chile, the passage specifically states the Incas controlled the north.
"
1810 me inme se kya nahi hua tha?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Chilly ne Spain par jeet haasil ki**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

प्रश्न कहता है कि 1810 में चिली को स्वतंत्र घोषित किया गया था, लेकिन स्पेन पर निर्णायक जीत 1818 तक हासिल नहीं हुई थी। इसलिए, 1810 में चिली ने स्पेन पर जीत हासिल नहीं की थी।

अन्य विकल्प सही हैं क्योंकि:

*   **A: Kendra sarkar ka na hona (कोई केंद्रीय सरकार नहीं):** प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि 1810 में नेपोलियन के युद्धों ने स्पेन को प्रभावी रूप से एक केंद्रीय सरकार के बिना छोड़ दिया था।
*   **C: Napoleon ke yuddh lade ja rahe the (नेपोलियन के युद्ध लड़ रहे थे):** प्रश्न में बताया गया है कि 1810 में स्पेन में नेपोलियन के युद्ध चल रहे थे।
*   **D: Chilly ne swatantra ghoshit kar di thi (चिली ने स्वतंत्रता घोषित कर दी थी):** प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि चिली को 1810 में स्वतंत्र घोषित किया गया था।"
Liguria me log dur ke ganvon me kaise pahunch sakte hain?,"The correct answer is **C: train ya boat se**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Raaste, trains aur naaven gaanvon ko jodati hain, aur baaharse karen vahan nahin pahunch sakti hain.""  This translates to: ""Roads, trains, and boats connect the villages, and vehicles from outside cannot reach there.""

Therefore, people in the remote villages of Liguria can reach them by train or boat. Options A and B are incomplete, and Option D is incorrect as the passage doesn't mention planes.
"
Italian shabdpad ‘Cinque Terre’ ka kya matlab hai?,"The correct answer is **A: paanch gaanv (five villages)**.

The text states ""Jiska earth hai paanch bhoomi, jo paanch chhote tateey gaon rayomegior, manrola, cornigleya, verneza, monterosose banaa liguria ke italvi kshetra mein sthit hain."" which translates to ""Whose land has five villages, which are five small, idyllic villages Rayomegior, Manrola, Corniglia, Vernazza, Monterosso located in the Italian region of Liguria.""  Therefore, ""Cinque Terre"" literally means ""Five Lands"" or, more commonly understood, ""Five Villages"".
"
Sardiyon me fisalne wale raaston ke liye kis tarah ke jute sahi hote hain?,"The correct answer is **B: uchit tulle waale jute (shoes with appropriate tread)**.

Here's why:

The provided text explicitly states: ""kamse kam, aapko uchit tulle waale jute chaahiye"" (at a minimum, you should have shoes with appropriate tread).  The text further details the importance of tread depth (5mm or more) and the material's softness in cold temperatures for better grip on slippery surfaces.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: patli heels waale jute (shoes with thin heels):** Thin heels offer very little stability on icy surfaces and are dangerous.
* **C: oonchi heel waale jute (high-heeled shoes):** High heels provide poor balance and traction on slippery surfaces.
* **D: 1/5 inch gahare pattern ke bina jute (shoes without a 1/5 inch deep pattern):** The text emphasizes the *depth* of the tread pattern for better traction."
"Sardiyon me barf wali sadkon par, inmen se kisse traction me sudhaar nahi hoga?","The correct answer is **D: paani**

Here's why:

*   **Salt (calcium chloride), gravel (kankar), and sand (reit)** all provide traction in icy conditions. They create a rougher surface that helps shoes and tires grip the ice.
*   **Water (paani)** on the other hand, makes the ice *more* slippery. It creates a thin layer of water that can cause skidding."
Hawaii aur Kok island ke beech kya samaanta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: dono ka time zone same hai**.

The passage states: ""Hawai ke time zone ke samaan, dweepon ko kabhi-kabhi """"australiyai hawai"""" ke roop mein maanaa jaataa hai."" This means the Cook Islands share the same time zone as Hawaii.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: dono me bade hotel hain** - The passage explicitly mentions the Cook Islands evoke the feeling of early Hawaii *before* large hotels existed.
* **B: dono desh nahi hain** - The passage states the Cook Islands *is* a sovereign island nation.
* **D: dono me koi shahar nahi hai** - The passage states the Cook Islands has 15 separate islands, and no cities. While Hawaii has cities, the passage doesn't explicitly state this comparison.



"
Inmen se kisse Kok island ko sahi se paribhaashit nahi kiya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Iske mukhya shahar Rarotonga aur Aitutaki hain**

Here's why:

* The text states: ""Kok Islands mein koi shahar nahin hai, lekin isamen 15 alag-alag islands hain. inmein rarotonga aur aitohtaaki pramukh hain."" (Kok Islands have no cities, but it consists of 15 separate islands. Rarotonga and Aitutaki are prominent among them.)
* This directly contradicts option C, which claims Rarotonga and Aitutaki are the *main* cities.  The text says there are no cities.

Let's look at why the other options are correct:

* **A: yah Hawaii se chhota hai** - The passage says it's small, and the comparison to old Hawaii suggests it's smaller and less developed.
* **B: yah ek archipelago hai** - The passage explicitly states: ""yah samudra mein 2.2 million varg kilometres mein faile 15 dweepon ek dweepsamuh hai."" (it is an archipelago consisting of 15 islands spread over 2.2 million square kilometers in the ocean.)
* **D: Island ka time zone aur Hawaii ka time zone ek hi hai** - The passage says: ""Hawai ke time zone ke samaan..."" (Similar to Hawaii's time zone...) implying they are the same.



"
Inmen se kaunsa ranger station do tarah ke lodging vikalp deta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sirena**.

The text states: ""Cyrena ekmatra ranger station hai jo camping ke alawa shayanagar awas aur germ bhojan pradaan karta hai."" (Cyrena is the only ranger station that provides, in addition to camping, city housing and German food.)

Los Patos, La Leona, and San Pedrillo are explicitly stated to *only* provide camping.
"
"Agar aapko credit ki jagah cash ka istemal karna hai, to park permit kahan se book kiya ja sakta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Puerto Jiménez**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Seedhe puerto jimenen ke ranger stationse park permit lia jaa sakta hai. haalaanki, way credit card sweekar nahin karte hain."" which translates to ""Park permits can be obtained directly from the Puerto Jiménez ranger station. However, they do not accept credit cards.""

Therefore, the Puerto Jiménez ranger station is the place to get a park permit if you prefer to use cash.
"
khade ilaakon me kis tarah ki skiing ki jaati hai?,"The correct answer is **C: alpine shally**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""yah sambandhit hai, lekin aam taur par isamen alpine shally ke sky tauring yaa mountaineering shamil nahin hoti hai, jise khade ilaakon mein kiya jaataa hai...""  This translates to ""It is related, but generally does not include alpine schally sky touring or mountaineering, which is done in hilly areas...""

Therefore, alpine schally is the type of skiing done in hilly areas.
"
bekcontry sky karne wale aese logon ko kisse madad mil sakti hai jo zyada unchaai par pahunchna chahte hain?,"The correct answer is **A: kade boot (sturdy boots)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that backcountry skiing *does not* typically involve alpine touring or mountaineering, which *does* require very sturdy boots.  While the passage mentions sturdy boots for mountaineering, the core activity of backcountry skiing is described as a long hike, and sturdy boots are essential for any hiking.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: bhaari bag (heavy bag):** The passage says you won't get the speed of cross-country skiing with a heavily packed bag.
* **C: Achchi pariisthitiyan (good conditions):** Good conditions are helpful for any activity, but not *specifically* what someone needs to reach higher altitudes.
* **D: taiyar patariyan (prepared slopes):** Backcountry skiing is *not* on prepared slopes.  It's off-piste.



"
Punah pravesh jhatka experience karne wale yaatriyon ko kya karne me samasya aati hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Gharelu sanskriti ko wapas apnaana (Re-acclimating to their home culture)**.

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes that while people understand travelers need patience and understanding when adapting to a new culture, they *don't* often realize that returning home can be difficult too. The passage states: ""Jab aap pehle ke samay mein videsh gaye the, toh log tab yejaankar dhairya aur samajh rakhate the ki yaatriyon ko naye desh mein uske hisaab se dhalna padata hai. Log yah anuman nahin lagaa sakte hain ki ghar lautane vaale yaatriyon ke liye dhairya aur samajh bhi aavashyak hai.""  This directly highlights the difficulty in re-integrating with their original culture and rediscovering familiar habits.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: nayi jagah ki sanskriti ko apnaana (Adapting to a new culture):** This refers to the initial ""re-entry shock"" and is not the core issue discussed in the passage regarding returning home.
* **B: dhairya aur samajh rakhna (Being patient and understanding):**  The passage says patience and understanding are *needed* for returning travelers, but it's not a *problem* they face.  The problem is *how* to regain their connection to their home culture.
* **C: Videsh me ghoomne jana (Traveling abroad):**  This is just a general statement about going abroad and not related to the difficulties of re-entry.



"
Kis tarah ke yaatri ke Punah pravesh jhatka mukhya roop se kathin ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Aese yaatri jo vishesh roop se kharab sanskriti kaa samna karte hain** (Travelers who are particularly facing a difficult culture).

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the re-entry shock (""Punah pravesh jhatka"") can be more severe for travelers who find it difficult to adjust to the foreign culture. It mentions that while the initial adjustment to a new culture might be easier, the return can be challenging, especially if the traveler has assimilated into the new culture and lost touch with their own.
* Option A directly reflects this idea.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aese yaatri jo videsh me ghoomte samay wahan ki sanskriti ko turant apnaa lete hain** (Travelers who quickly adopt the foreign culture while traveling abroad) - The passage says this *might* be the case initially, but doesn't make it the reason for a difficult re-entry shock.
* **C: Aese yaatri jo ab bhi honeymoon ke daur me rehte hain** (Travelers who are still on their honeymoon) - This is irrelevant to the re-entry shock.
* **D: kam dhairya wale yaatri** (Travelers with less patience) - While lack of patience might make the re-entry shock worse, the passage highlights the difficulty of adapting to the *culture* itself as the core issue.



"
Logon ko moose ke saath kya nahin karna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: khatre ke star ko kam karna (Reducing the perceived threat level)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that moose are generally not aggressive, *but* will defend themselves if they feel threatened.
* Option C suggests trying to make the moose feel less threatened. This is precisely what could provoke an attack.
* The other options are generally good advice when encountering a moose:
    * **A: Unke hone ko andekha karna (Ignoring their presence):**  This is a good way to avoid startling them.
    * **B: Dheere-dheere paas aana (Approaching slowly):** Slow and steady movements are less likely to scare a moose.
    * **D: Door se moose ko dekhna (Watching moose from a distance):** Maintaining a safe distance is crucial.



Therefore, attempting to reduce a moose's perceived threat is the riskiest action and the one the passage warns against.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, inme se kaun sa kathan moose ke baare me sahi hai?","The correct answer is **D: Agar unhe khatra mehsoos hota hai to ve apni raksha karenge.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Jab log moose ko bahut khatarnaak nahin maante hain, toh way bahut paas aa sakte hain aur khud ko jokhim mein doll sakte hain. **Agar unhein koi khatra mahsoos hota hai, toh way apni raksha karenge.**"" (When people don't consider moose very dangerous, they can come very close and put themselves at risk. **If they feel threatened, they will defend themselves.**)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: ve praakritik roop se aakraamak hote hain** (They are naturally aggressive) - The passage says they are *not* naturally aggressive.
* **B: Unhen kabhi-kabhi khatra nahi maana jaata** (They are sometimes not considered dangerous) - While true, this isn't the *most accurate* statement about their behavior in response to perceived threats.
* **C: Agar log unke zyada paas jaate hain to ve aakraamak ho sakte hain** (If people get too close to them, they can become aggressive) - The passage states people can get close *without* provoking aggression, but *threats* will elicit a defensive response.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, registan me yaatraa karne wale vyakti ke liye inme se kya sabse kam khatarnaak hoga?","सही उत्तर है **A: thandi raat me garm kapdon ka na hona**।

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

*   **Passage के अनुसार:** Passage में कहा गया है कि रेगिस्तान में रातें बहुत ठंडी हो सकती हैं और कपड़ों के बिना हाइपोथर्मिया का खतरा होता है।
*   **विकल्प A:** ""ठंडी रात में गर्म कपड़ों का न होना"" सीधे तौर पर हाइपोथर्मिया के खतरे को दर्शाता है, जो कि passage में उल्लिखित सबसे बड़ा खतरा है।
*   **विकल्प B, C और D:** ये सभी विकल्प खतरनाक हैं, लेकिन passage में उल्लिखित सबसे बड़ा खतरा हाइपोथर्मिया है। Marichika का पीछा करना ऊर्जा और पानी की बर्बादी है, जो नुकसानदायक हो सकता है, लेकिन हाइपोथर्मिया जितना गंभीर नहीं है। Marichika को पानी जैसा देखने का भ्रम एक संभावित समस्या है, लेकिन यह हाइपोथर्मिया जितना प्रत्यक्ष और गंभीर खतरा नहीं है।

इसलिए, passage के संदर्भ में, गर्म कपड़ों के बिना ठंडी रात में रहने का खतरा दूसरों की तुलना में सबसे कम गंभीर है।"
Registan me yaatraa karne waalon ke liye inme se kya sambhavit khatra nahi hota?,"सही उत्तर है **D: धूप से झुलसना**।

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

*   **पानी की कमी (Paani ki kami):** रेगिस्तान में गर्मी के कारण यात्रियों को प्यास लगती है और उन्हें पानी या अन्य चीजों का भ्रम होता है। यह एक गंभीर खतरा है।
*   **मरिचििका (Marichika):** यदि यात्री मरिचििका का पीछा करते हैं, तो यह मूल्यवान ऊर्जा और बचे हुए पानी की बर्बादी होगी, जो खतरनाक हो सकता है।
*   **हाइपोथर्मिया (Hypothermia):** रेगिस्तान में सबसे अधिक गर्म स्थान भी रात में बहुत ठंडे हो सकते हैं। ऐसे स्थानों पर बिना कपड़ों के हाइपोथर्मिया का खतरा होता है।
*   **धूप से झुलसना (Dhoop se jhulna):** रेगिस्तान में धूप से झुलसना एक खतरा हो सकता है, लेकिन यह दिए गए पाठ में मुख्य रूप से उल्लिखित खतरा नहीं है। पाठ गर्मी और पानी की कमी, और रात में ठंड के खतरों पर अधिक ध्यान केंद्रित करता है।

इसलिए, रेगिस्तान में यात्रा करने वालों के लिए जो संभावित खतरा नहीं है वह है **धूप से झुलसना**।"
"Passage ke anusaar, khojkartaon ke aane ke baad inme se kiski aabaadi bahut kam ho gayi thi?","The correct answer is **C: tenos**.

The passage states: ""European khojkartaon ke aane ke baad kuch hi salon mein, spanish vijeta dwara tenos ke abadi kafee kam kar dee gayi thi."" (After European explorers arrived, within a few years, the Spanish victors greatly reduced the population of the Taino.)
"
"Passage ke anusaar, karaibiyai kaunsi bhasha bolte the?","The correct answer is **D: Arawakan**.

The passage states: ""carribes log arvakan bhasha bolate the..."" which translates to ""Carib people spoke Arawakan language...""
"
Skiing ko manoranjak khel ke roop me popular karne ka shrey kise jaata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Norwey ke log**.

The text states: ""1861 mein australia mein norwey ke logon dwara pahala manoranjak sky club khola gaya tha."" (In 1861, the first recreational ski club was opened in Australia by Norwegians.) This indicates that Norwegians were instrumental in popularizing skiing as a recreational sport.

The other options are incorrect:

*   **Ski bum:** This is a colloquial term for someone who skis extensively and often lives a nomadic lifestyle. It doesn't refer to the person who popularized the sport.
*   **Cave dweller:** Cave paintings simply show that skiing has a long history, but they don't identify who popularized it.
*   **Australiyaai log:** While Australia hosted the first recreational ski club established by Norwegians, they weren't the ones who popularized skiing. They simply hosted the first club.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, lagbhag kis samay skiing ko khel ke roop me maanyata mili?","The correct answer is **A: 18veen shatabdi**.

The passage states: ""Downhill sking ek khel ke roop mein kamse kam 17 ween shatabdi mein shuru hui thi..."" which translates to ""Downhill skiing as a sport began at least in the 17th century...""

While skiing existed much earlier (as indicated by the cave paintings dating back to 5000 BCE), the passage specifically mentions the 17th century as when it started being recognized as a sport.
"
africa ke purvi tata ke parey sabse bada mahadweep kaunsa hai?,"The correct answer is **C: vanyajeev (wildlife)**.

The text states: ""Medagaskar sabse bada apna khud ka vanyajeevan wala mahadweep hai."" (Madagascar is the largest island with its own wildlife.)

Therefore, the question asks for the largest island in the eastern coast of Africa with its own wildlife, and the text provides that Madagascar fits this description.
"
Chhote poorvi afriki mahadweep ka attribute kya nahi hai? ,"The correct answer is **B: bahut saare lagzari resort (many luxury resorts)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while many islands in the East African archipelago are known for luxury beach resorts, it doesn't say that *most* of them are. The passage focuses more on their diverse political status (independent or related to France) and their biodiversity.

Let's look at why the other options *are* attributes of the East African archipelago:

* **A: France se connection (Connection to France):** The passage explicitly says ""Adhikansh chhote dweep swatantra rashtra hain, yaa fraansse sambandhit hain..."" (Most of the small islands are independent nations or connected to France...).
* **C: vanyajeewan wala mahadweep (Continent with wildlife):** The passage states ""Medagaskar sabse bada apna khud ka vanyajeevan wala mahadweep hai"" (Madagascar is the largest continent with its own wildlife). This implies that the East African archipelago as a whole has significant wildlife.
* **D: doosre deshon se swatantrata (Independence from other countries):** The passage mentions ""Adhikansh chhote dweep swatantra rashtra hain..."" (Most of the small islands are independent nations...).



"
"Passage ke asnusaar, kuchh parmparagat churches mein easter kaisa manaya jata hai?","Correct answer is **B: shaniwar raat ko vigil rakhkar**.

The passage states: ""Zyada parmparagat churches mein easter saptahant mein shaniwar raat ko easter vigil ka aayojan kiya jaataa hai..."" which translates to ""In many traditional churches, Easter vigil is organized on Saturday night during Holy Week...""
"
"Equador me pravesh karte samay kuchh zaruraton se bachne ke liye, Cuba ke naagrik ke paas kya hona chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: US ka green card**.

Here's why:

The text explicitly states: ""Cuba ke nagrik jo america ke green card dhaarak hain, unhein is aavashyaktase chhoot praapt karne ke liye equador ke vanijya dutawas mein jaanaa chaahiye."" (Cuban citizens who are holders of a US green card must go to the Ecuadorian वाणिज्य दूतावास to obtain this exemption.)

While the other options are requirements for entry, the question asks what a Cuban citizen *must have* to avoid issues, and the passage specifies the green card exemption.
"
Equador me yaatraa karne ki zaruraton ko kiske liye design nahi kiya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: yaatriyon ki sankhya ko kam se kam rakhne ke liye** (to keep the number of travelers minimal).

Here's why:

The text clearly outlines requirements for entry into Ecuador, specifically focused on travelers from Cuba. These requirements are related to:

*   **Authorization:** Invitation letter from the Ecuadorian Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
*   **Compliance:** Following certain regulations.
*   **Streamlining:**  Designed to manage the flow of travelers between the two countries.
*   **Passport Validity:** Ensuring the passport is valid for at least 6 months.
*   **Proof of Return:**  Showing a round-trip ticket.

None of these requirements are directly aimed at limiting the *number* of travelers. The other options (B, C, and D) are all directly addressed by the requirements in the text.



"
Inme se kya apne desh ke muqaable dusre desh me mehnga ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: mehnge frame (expensive frames)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aise kshetras mein upalabdh mahange brand-naam ke frame mein do samasyaaen ho sakti hain; kuch chori ke ho sakte hain aur asal mein ayaat kiye gaye rema gharelu ke tulna mein zyada mahange ho sakte hain."" 

This translates to: ""In such areas, expensive branded frames available may have two problems; some may be stolen, and they may be more expensive than the imported local frames.""

Therefore, expensive frames are highlighted as potentially *more expensive* than in one's home country.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aankhon ki jaanch (eye examination):** The passage suggests getting eye exams done at home, especially if insurance covers it, implying it might be cheaper there.
* **C: Aankhon ka beema (eye insurance):**  The passage mentions insurance coverage, but doesn't suggest it would be more expensive in another country.
* **D: local frame (local frame):**  The passage indicates that local frames can be *more expensive* than imported ones in some situations, making this incorrect.



"
Dusre desh me mehnge frame khareedna jokhim bhara kisliye ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ye chori ke ho sakte hain**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically states: ""...aise kshetras mein upalabdh mahange brand-naam ke frame mein do samasyaaen ho sakti hai; kuch chori ke ho sakte hain...""  This directly translates to ""...in such areas, expensive brand-name frames available may have two problems; they may be stolen...""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: aankhon ki stirikt jaanch ki zaroorat ho sakti hai (Strict eye examination may be needed):** While a thorough eye exam is always important, it's not the primary risk of buying expensive frames abroad.
* **B: Ho sakta hai ki Doctor ka parcha kuchh frames ke liye manya na ho (The doctor's prescription may not be accepted for some frames):**  The passage mentions bringing the prescription, but the issue isn't whether it's accepted for *some* frames, but rather problems with expensive brand-name frames.
* **D: Ho sakta hai beema iska bhugtan na kare (Insurance may not pay for it):** The passage mentions insurance coverage, but the core risk of expensive frames is theft.



Therefore, the most accurate and directly supported answer from the text is **C**.



"
"Fockland me mudra ke isteman ke sambandh me, inmen se kaunsa kathan sahi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Dweep chhodne par Fockland pound ko badla jana chahiye.**

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Baahari dweepon par credit card shayed sweekar nahin kiye jayenge, haalaanki british aur sanyukt rajya ke mudra sweekarya hogi; yah nirdhaarit karne ke liye ki sweekarya bhugtan vidhi kya hai, maalikonse pehle hi pooch lain. Dweepon ke baahar fockland ke karency ko badalana lagbhag asambhav hai, isliye dweep chhodanese pehle paas ko badalwa lain."" This directly advises exchanging Falkland Pounds before leaving the islands.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Dweepon me keval credit card aur British pound sweekaar kiye jaate hain:** The text says British pounds are *commonly* accepted and US dollars are *often* accepted. Credit cards are * शायद* (maybe) not accepted outside Stanley.
* **B: keval steinly me hi US dollar sweekaar kiye jayenge:** The text doesn't limit US dollar acceptance to Stanley.
* **D: Fockland pound ke alawa, aam taur par sabse zyada British pound ko sweekaar kiya jata hai:** The text states British pounds are *commonly* accepted. It doesn't say it's the *most* commonly accepted, just common.

Therefore, option C is the only statement directly supported by the provided text.
"
"Passage ke aadhaar par, United States se Fockland jaane par, credit card ke alawa bhugtan karne ka koi aur tareeka kaam aa sakta hai?","Correct answer is **A: FIC West store me**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the only bank in the Falkland Islands where money can be deposited and withdrawn is located at FIC West store in Stanley.
* While British Pounds and US Dollars are often accepted in Stanley, the passage specifically mentions the FIC West store as the only place for banking transactions.
* Option B is incorrect because it says it works throughout the whole island, which isn't stated.
* Option C is incorrect because it says it works on remote islands, but the passage says credit cards might not be accepted there, while British and US dollars are accepted.
* Option D is incorrect because it says it works in Stanley, but only the FIC West store is mentioned as a place for banking transactions.



"
"Inme se kaunsa event, mandir ke tyohaar se smabandhit nahi hai?","The correct answer is **A: ek haathi ka janm (a elephant's birth)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that temple festivals are usually celebrated on the temple's founding day, the deity's birthday, or other special days related to the temple. While elephants are often part of the festival celebrations in Kerala temples, an elephant's birth is not a typical temple festival event. Options B, C, and D are all explicitly mentioned as reasons for celebrating temple festivals.
"
saje huye haathi kahan dekhe jaa sakte hain?,"The correct answer is **C: mandir ke tyoharon me**.

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kerala ke mandiron mein manaae jaane waale tyauhar dekhne mein kafee mazedaar hote hain. inmein paaramparik tareekese saje-dhaje haathi, mandir ka apna archestra aur dusre reeti-rivaaz shamil hain."" This translates to: ""Festivals celebrated in Kerala temples are very interesting to see. They include traditionally decorated elephants, the temple's own orchestra, and other customs and traditions.""

The decorated elephants are part of the temple festivals. While they might be present during the overall timeframe mentioned (November to May), they are specifically seen *during the festivals* held at the temples.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: November ke end se maee ke madhya tak har jagah:**  This is too broad. While the festivals happen during this time, decorated elephants aren't present ""everywhere"" during that period.
* **B: mandiron me:** This is partially correct, but not specific enough. It's better to say they are seen *during the festivals* at temples.
* **D: Kerala ke mandiron mein:** While decorated elephants are seen in Kerala temples, the text explicitly says they are seen *during the festivals* held there.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, business ya first class ki yatron par paise bachane ka sabse achcha tareeka kya hai?","सही उत्तर है: **A: company se booking karwana**

यहाँ इसका कारण बताया गया है:

पैराग्राफ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है: ""Haalaanki, yah sastaa nahin hai: ek niyam ke roop mein, aap binnes ke liye samanya economy bhaaen ka chaar gunaa tak aur pratham shreni ke liye gyarah gunaa tak bhugtan karne ke ummid kar sakte hain! behtar yah hai ki aap apni companyse booking karavaaen."" 

इसका मतलब है कि कंपनी के माध्यम से बुकिंग करना व्यवसाय या प्रथम श्रेणी की यात्रा के लिए अधिक किफायती हो सकता है, भले ही यह सस्ता न हो। अन्य विकल्प पैराग्राफ में बताए गए तथ्यों से मेल नहीं खाते हैं।"
"Passage ke anusaar, Kuchh shreni me ticket book karte samay inme se kya samay ki barbaadi hogi?","The correct answer is **C: Discount**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aam taur par aisaa kahaa jaataa hai ki seedhi udaanon mein **aise bee tak business yaa first class seats par kisi bhi soorat mein discount nahin diya jaataa hai**."" 

This means you shouldn't expect discounts on business or first-class tickets, particularly on direct flights.  The other options are discussed as factors influencing the *cost* of these ticket types, not as sources of potential savings.
"
africa ke yatra ke kiraaye aur world-taur ke kiraaye mein tulna karte samay kya jodna nahi bhoolna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **D: Africa se bahar ki jagahon ka bhoomi parivahan ka kharch**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Africa ke baahar una sabhi asthanon ke liye atirikt veean, prasthaan kar, bhoomi parivahan, aadi ke atirikt laagat jodana naa bhoolen."" This translates to ""Don't forget to add extra costs for visas, departures, land transport, etc. for all those places outside of Africa.""

Let's look at why the other options are not as accurate:

* **A: Africa ke baahar una sabhi asthanon ke liye visa ka atirikt kharch:** While visa costs are a factor, the passage mentions ""land transport"" and ""etc."", implying more than just visa costs.
* **B: Africa se prasthaan kar ka kharch:** This is part of the departure cost, but the passage refers to costs *outside* Africa.
* **C: Africa ke visa ka kharch:** Same reason as A - limited scope.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, supermarket me inmen se kiske liye zyada vikalp mil rahe hain?","The correct answer is **A: Taiyar bhojan (Ready-to-eat meals)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Teji se badhte hue supermarket tarah-tarah ke taiyar bhojan ke vividh khand pradaan kar rha hain."" (Supermarkets are providing a wide variety of ready-to-eat meals.)

While the other options are mentioned, they are *related to* ready-to-eat meals, not the main focus of the increase in options. Microwave ovens are used *to heat* ready-to-eat meals, on-site restaurants are *a type* of ready-to-eat option, and affordable prices are a *characteristic* of some ready-to-eat options.  The passage highlights the *growth in variety* of ready-to-eat meals the most.
"
"Taiyar bhojan khareedte samay, Supermarket dwara pradaan kiye gaye Inme se kisse graahak sabse zyada aakarshit honge?","The correct answer is **A: onn-site restaurant**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the growing variety of ready-made meals offered by supermarkets.** It specifically mentions that some supermarkets have on-site restaurants with affordable prices and a casual atmosphere. 
* **Consumers are often looking for convenience and a complete meal solution.** An on-site restaurant provides that directly, allowing them to purchase a ready-to-eat meal without further preparation.
* **Options B and C are incorrect** because a wide variety of ready-made meals is already mentioned as a key feature.  ""Kam vividh khand"" (few diverse sections) is the opposite of what supermarkets are doing.
* **Option D (microwave oven)** is helpful for reheating, but it doesn't directly address the consumer's desire for a meal itself. It's a supporting feature, not the main attraction.

Therefore, the on-site restaurant offers the most appealing and comprehensive solution for consumers looking for ready-made meals at a supermarket.



"
French bolne wala bengian aur switzerland ke logon ko inme se kya samajh nahi aa sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: France me boli jaane wali adhiktar french** (Most of the French spoken in France).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Belgium aur switzerland mein boli jaane waali french, fraans mein boli jaane waali frenchse thodi alag hai...khas kar numbering system mein french bolane waale belgium aur switzerland mein kuch mamuli visheshta hai ki yefrench bolane waale fraansse alag hain..."" This means that while the French spoken in Belgium and Switzerland is largely understandable, it has differences.
* **The passage also mentions:** ""kuch shabdon ka uchchaaran thoda-sha alag hai"" (the pronunciation of some words is a little different).
* **The passage emphasizes:** ""sabhi francisi-bhashi belgium vaasiyon aur switterland vaasiyonne school mein maanak french seekhi hogi, isliye maanak french ankan pranali ka upayog karne par bhi way aapko samajhne mein saksham honge."" This highlights that they understand standard French.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is that they might not understand *most* of the French spoken in France, due to the regional variations.  While they understand standard French, the deviations from standard French in France could be confusing.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: maanak french ankan pranali (Standard French spelling system):** The passage says they *can* understand standard French spelling.
* **B: Ajeeb se french shabd (Strange French words):** The passage says the pronunciation of some words is different, not that the words themselves are strange.
* **C: Kuchh frech shabdon ka uchchaaran (Some French words' pronunciation):** The passage explicitly mentions that the pronunciation of some words is slightly different.



"
Inme se kya france me to hai lekin Belgium ya Switzerland e samaan nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Kuch French shabdon ki spelling (Some French word spellings)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while Belgian and Swiss French are largely the same as French, there are ""some minor peculiarities"" in numbering systems and pronunciation, and ""some words have a slightly different pronunciation.""  It also mentions that despite these differences, everyone in Belgium and Switzerland learns standard French in school and can understand standard French.

Therefore, the difference lies in specific word spellings that might vary between French and the Belgian/Swiss versions, but the core structure (pronunciation, grammar, standard French vocabulary) remains largely the same.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: sabhi shabdon ka uchchaaran (all word pronunciations):** The passage explicitly says pronunciation is *slightly* different, not completely different.
*   **B: ankan pranali (spelling system):**  The passage indicates they use the standard French spelling system.
*   **C: School me padhai jaane wali french bhasha (the French language learned in school):**  Everyone in Belgium and Switzerland learns standard French in school, so this is common to all three regions.



"
kis sthiti me aapko shock kiraaya milne ki sambhavana kam hai?,"The correct answer is **B: agar aap thid-party seva ke bajaay seedhe airline se book karne ki koshish karte hain.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Sabhi mamalon mein, aapko airline ke booking seedhe p hone se karni hogi."" (In all cases, you must book the airline directly.)
* Therefore, booking through a third-party service would *reduce* the possibility of getting a shock discount.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar aap WestJet se yaatraa kar rahe hain:** The passage lists WestJet as one of the airlines offering shock discounts.
* **C: Agar aap Lufthansa me Pars se United States ki yaatraa karte hain:** The passage lists Lufthansa as one of the airlines offering shock discounts.
* **D: Agar aap Delta se yaatraa karte hain:** The passage lists Delta Air Lines as one of the airlines offering shock discounts.



"
shock kiraaye ke baare me kya sahi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Inhe seedhe airline ki website se book kiya jana chahiye.**

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Sabhi mamalon mein, aapko airline ke booking seedhe p hone se karni hogi."" which translates to ""In all cases, you must book the airline directly on its website.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: antim sanskar ki antim yaatraa me chhoot dete hain (They offer a discount on the final journey of life):** While the passage mentions a discount (""thoda bahut chhoot detee hain"" - a little discount), it's not the *defining* characteristic of the shock fares.  The discount is *in relation* to the cost of funeral expenses.
* **C: Ve aakhri samay me yaatraa karne ki laagat cover karte hain (They cover the cost of travel at the last minute):** The passage doesn't say the shock fares *cover* the cost. It says they offer a discount.
* **D: Unhen seedhe phone ki madad se airline se book kiya jana chahiye (They should be booked directly with the airline via phone):** The passage specifically says to book *on the airline's website*, not via phone.



"
"GPS navigation app ke muqaable, GPS device ka istemaal karna zyada sahi kab hota hai?","The correct answer is **C: jab aap range se bahar hon**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that GPS navigation apps rely on data connection or GPS signal.
* Option C directly addresses a situation where those resources are unavailable (""jab range se bahar hon"" - when you are out of range).
* GPS devices, on the other hand, use satellites and don't depend on cellular data, making them reliable in areas without connectivity.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: jab paise bachane ki koshish kar rahe hon** - While GPS apps can save money on new devices, the passage highlights a limitation of apps when data isn't available.  It doesn't say saving money is the primary reason to *choose* a GPS device.
* **B: jab pakka ho ki aapke paas data connection hoga** - This is the opposite of a situation where a GPS device is beneficial.
* **D: jab aapko device kiraaye par na lena ho** - This is a logistical point, not a reason based on functionality or reliability of the navigation method.  The passage mentions renting a GPS device as a cost-saving alternative to buying a new app.



"
GPS device ke badle GPS navigation app ka istemaal karne ka sahi kaaran kya nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: data connection ki chinta na karna (Not worrying about data connection)**.

Here's why:

* The paragraph explicitly states that GPS navigation apps can be limited or unavailable when you don't have a data connection or are out of range. This directly contradicts the benefit of *not* worrying about data connection.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: paise bachana (Saving money):** The paragraph states this is a benefit *of* using a navigation app, not a reason *against* it.
* **C: kiraaya na dena (Not paying rent):** This is another benefit listed in the paragraph.
* **D: naye map khareedne se bachna (Avoiding buying new maps):** This is also mentioned as a financial advantage of using a navigation app.

Therefore, the only reason that is *not* a correct reason to use a GPS navigation app *instead* of a GPS device is that you wouldn't have to worry about a data connection.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, aap yah kaise pakka karenge ki aapko sahi ship ke saath match kiya gaya hai?","The correct answer is **C: Galapagos travel ke agent se book karwa ke**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""is baat mein puri tarah nishchint ho jaaen ki aapne jis agent ke jariye book kiya hai, wah jahaajon ke kayee kismon ke achche gyaan ke saath ek gallapagos ka visheshagya hai. yah sunishchit karega ki aapke khaas hit aur / yaa samasyaaen jahaajse mail karein jo unke sabse upayukt ho."" (Make sure that the agent you book through is a Galapagos specialist with good knowledge of many types of ships. This will ensure that your specific interests and/or concerns match the ship that is most suitable for you.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: samaan ruchi rakhne wale 8 se zyada yaatrin ke sath book karke:** The passage doesn't mention anything about the number of passengers.
* **B: aese samay book karke jab peak season na ho:** While booking outside peak season might be beneficial, it's not directly related to ensuring you're matched with the right ship.
* **D: pahle se book karke:** The passage mentions booking in advance because ships fill up, but it's not the key to being matched with the right ship. The specialist agent is.

"Passage ke anusaar, mehmaanon ko gambling karte rehne ke liye kaunsa tareeka nahi apnaya jata?","Passage ke anusaar, casino aam taur par khikiyaan aur ghiyaan nahin karte hain. Options mein, ""muft drink"" (C) ka zikr hai. Passage mein kehta hai ki kuch asthan maadak peya pradhan karte hain, isse pata chalta hai ki muft drink ka pradhan hona casino mein aam hai.

Bahut si praakritik roshni (A) ya ghadiyaan na lagana (D) passage mein zikr nahi hai. Muft concert ticket jaisi cheezein (B) ka zikr passage mein nahin hai, lekin yeh casino mein common promotional activity ho sakti hain, passage mein इसका जिक्र नहीं है।

Isliye, jawab **D: ghadiyaan na lagana** hai, kyunki passage mein kehta hai ki casino mehmaanon ko vahin paane ke liye khaas tarah ke khane-peene aur manoranjan ki vyavastha rakhte hain. Ghadiyaan na lagana, mehmaanon ko vahin paane ke liye ek strategy nahi hai.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, ek achhe juaari ko kya nahi karna chahiye?","Passage ke anusaar, ""sabhi achche juari saadaa rahne ke mahatva ko jaanate hain.""  Iska matlab hai ki ek achhe juari ko *bahut zyada sharaab peena* chahiye.  Dusre option (muft me koi cheez lena, ghadiyaan dekhte rehna, baahar nikalne ka sabse nazdeek ka rasta khojna) passage mein achhe juari ke liye *kritik* nahi bataya gaya.

Isliye, sahi jawab hai: **A: bahut zyada sharaab peena**

Although the passage mentions that some establishments offer intoxicating drinks, it implies that a good gambler should *avoid* excessive drinking.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, vakya ke beech ke kis part of speech ke pehle akshar ko bade akshar me likha jata hai?","The correct answer is **B: sangya**.

The passage states: ""Saaee ke saath-saath sabhi sangya shabd hamesha angrezi ke badey aksharse hi shuru hote hain..."" This translates to ""Along with Saaee, all noun words always start with a capital letter in English...""

Therefore, according to the passage, **nouns (sangya shabd)** are always capitalized.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, sangya ke pehle akshar ko bade akshar me likhne se kya mushkil aa sakti hai?","The correct answer is **C: likhne me (writing)**.

The passage states: ""हालाँकि यह यकीन पाने को आसान बनाता है, लेकिन यह पता लगाने की आवश्यकता से लिखना कहीं ज़्यादा मुश्किल है कि क्या एक क्रिया या विशेषण का उपयोग सही ढंग से किया गया है।""  This translates to: ""Although it makes it easier to be sure, it is much more difficult to write than it is to determine whether a verb or adjective has been used correctly.""  The difficulty lies in the *writing* process, not in reading or distinguishing verbs from adjectives. Therefore, the act of *writing* correctly using capital letters for nouns is the challenging part.

So, the most accurate option is **C**.
"
"Malaysia ke grameen ilaakon me, kis ishaare ka matlab hota hai “milane aao”?","The correct answer is **A: tarjani ungali ko modna** (folding the index finger).

The passage states: ""Isi prakar, spen mein ek british yatri hatheli hawa mein hilaane ko vaapas bulana samajh sakta hai jismein haath hilaane waale ke taraf hatheli ho (bajaayus vyakti ke jise haath hilaa kar dikhaaya jaa raha hai)."" 

This indicates that in Malaysia's rural areas, ""milane aao"" is indicated by the index finger pointing towards the person being beckoned to approach. While the passage mentions waving the hand, it's the specific gesture of *folding the index finger* that is associated with ""milane aao."" The other options aren't mentioned in the text.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, kis ishaare ka matlab hota hai “wapas aao”?","The correct answer is **C: Haath ko bahar ki or rakh kar lehrana**.

The passage states: ""Isi prakar, spen mein ek british yatri hatheli hawa mein hilaane ko vaapas bulana samajh sakta hai jismein haath hilaane waale ke taraf hatheli ho (bajaayus vyakti ke jise haath hilaa kar dikhaaya jaa raha hai)."" This translates to: ""Similarly, in Spain, a British traveler waving palm outwards can be understood as a call back, in which the palm of the waving person is towards the person being waved to (instead of the person waving).""
"
"Passage ke anusaar, himvider kis wajah se hote hain?","The correct answer is **A: barf ke girne se** (from ice falling).

The passage states: ""yah daraaren, himvider paida karenge..."" which translates to ""these cracks will create icefalls...""  Icefalls are formed when sections of the glacier break off and fall into the crevasse.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: glacier ke sthir na hone se** (from the glacier not being stable): While the glacier's instability contributes to the cracks, it's the *falling* ice from those cracks that creates the icefalls.
* **C: barf ki gufaaen dhahne se** (from ice caves collapsing): The passage mentions ice caves and walls, but doesn't directly link their collapse to the formation of icefalls.
* **D: block ke kamzor hone se** (from blocks becoming weak):  Weak blocks can contribute to calving (breaking off), but the passage explicitly connects icefalls to the *cracks* created by the glacier's movement.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, barf ke pul se kya chhip sakta hai?","The correct answer is **A: daraaren**.

The passage states: ""yah daraaren, himvider paida karenge, jo him setu dwara dhundhale ho sakte hain."" This translates to: ""these cracks, will create ice streams, which can be hidden by ice bridges."" Therefore, cracks can be hidden by ice bridges.
"
"Passage ke aadhaar par, kis jagah par jaate samay yaatriyon ko zyada saavdhaani baratni chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Goma ke aas-paas ke ilaake (The area around Goma)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Halanki goma yathochit surakshit hai, lekin goma ke baahar jaate samay uttar kivu praant mein chal rahi ladaai ke isthiti ko samajh lena chaahiye."" (Although Goma itself is generally safe, you should be aware of the ongoing conflict situation in the North Kivu province when traveling outside of Goma.)

While the Nyiragongo volcano is a significant feature, the passage doesn't say travelers need to be cautious *specifically* around it. The conflict in North Kivu is the stated reason for caution. The town center is mentioned as a location *within* Goma, which is described as generally safe. Rwanda is mentioned as being to Goma's east, not as a place where travelers need to be cautious *while in* Goma.



"
Gome me paryatak ke liye kya ek achha sujhaav nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: North Kivu me mazedaar fight hoti hain (There are fun fights in North Kivu)**.

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly warns about the ongoing conflict in North Kivu.**  Describing the fighting as ""fun"" is highly insensitive and inaccurate, and therefore a poor suggestion for tourists. It downplays a serious and dangerous situation.

Let's look at why the other options are valid suggestions:

* **B: Kifaayti Mountain Gorilla Tracking ke liye yah ek achhi jagah hai (It's a good place for affordable Mountain Gorilla Tracking)** - The text states that Goma is a base for affordable gorilla trekking.
* **C: Yahan ghoomne ke liye motorcycle taxi ek achha saadhan hai (Motorcycle taxis are a good means of getting around here)** - The text mentions that motortaxis are a common and affordable way to get around Goma.
* **D: Nyiragongo volcano ka base is shahar me sthit hai (The base of Nyiragongo volcano is located in this city)** - The text states that Goma is a base for climbing Nyiragongo volcano.



Therefore, option A is the only unsuitable suggestion for a tourist in Goma."
August ke liye backcountry permit kis din se uplabdh hoga?,"The correct answer is **C: 1 May**.

The passage states: ""ye shuru hone waale mahine se chaar mahine pehle, mahine ke 1 din upalabdh ho jaate hain.""  August is 4 months before February, and the permit becomes available on the 1st of that month. Thus, the permit for August becomes available on May 1st.
"
Canyon ki suraksha ke liye kaunsi neeti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Pehle aao, pehle paao wala permit system**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Yahaan pehle aao, pehle pao ke aadhar par walk-in anurodhon ke liye seemit sankhya mein permit reserve kiye gaye hain."" This translates to ""Here, permits are reserved for walk-in requests based on a first-come, first-served basis.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Pevmit keval 1 January ko hi uplabdh honge** - The passage states permits become available from May 1st to January 1st, not just January 1st.
* **C: Permit keval walk-in anurodhon par hi mil sakte hain** -  The passage mentions walk-in requests as one method, but doesn't say they are the *only* method. Reservations are also possible.
* **D: Permit ki seemit sankhya** - While the passage mentions a limited number of permits are available for walk-in requests, it doesn't say that *all* permits are limited in number.
"
"Passage me jis prakaar ke hotel ka varnan kiya gaya hai, unme kiske milne ki sambhavna sabse kam hai?","The correct answer is **D: naye aur naveentam suvidhaaon wale kamre (New and modern amenities)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that these hotels are characterized by ""पुराने ढंग के fitting (old-fashioned fittings), navintam suvidhaon ke kamee (lack of modern amenities), aur ek nishchit sunder vriddhavastha (a certain beautiful agedness)."" This means that the hotels are *not* known for having new and modern amenities.  In fact, it's the opposite. The passage suggests they lack them.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely to be the *least* likely to be found:

* **A: Cocktail bar:** While not explicitly mentioned, cocktail bars are common in hotels, even older ones.
* **B: Onsite gourmet restaurant:** The passage mentions ""badhiya bhojan (good food),"" suggesting the presence of a restaurant, which could even be gourmet.
* **C: Aese mehmaan jo ameer aur prasiddh hain (Guests who are wealthy and famous):** The passage *specifically* states that wealthy and famous people used to stay at these hotels.

Therefore, the least likely element to be found in these hotels is new and modern amenities."
"Passage ki jaankaari ke anusaar, Hotel me rukne wale mehmaan, inme se kis suvidha ko sabse kam praathmikta denge?","The passage emphasizes the historical charm and grandeur of these hotels, mentioning ""old-fashioned fittings"" and their association with wealthy and famous guests who enjoyed ""good food"" and spent the night. While all options could be present, the core appeal is the historical ambiance and the experience of staying in a place steeped in history.

Therefore, **D: kifaayti kamre (affordable rooms)** would be the least prioritized. The passage implies these hotels are not about budget accommodation; they are about luxury, history, and a particular kind of experience.  Affordability is not mentioned as a key feature or attraction.

So the answer is **D**.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Greenland jaate samay yaatriyon ko kya nahi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: Greenland ke native ko “Eskimo” kehkar nahi pukaarna chahiye**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Jaisa ki oopar ullekh kiya gaya hai, haalaanki """"eskimo"""" shabd sanyukt rajya america mein sweekarya hai, kintu ise kayee gair-amriki arctic logon dwara, vishesh roop se kanada mein apmaanjanak maanaa jaataa hai. Jab aap greenlandic mool nivasi dwara prayukt shabd soon sakte hain, toh iske upayog ko videshiyonse bachana chaahiye."" This directly advises against using the term ""Eskimo.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Zyada Crime wale ilaakon me nahi jana chahiye:** The passage says ""Aparadh, aur samanya taur par videshiyon ke prati durbhavana, greenland mein vastutah agyaat hai. yahaan tak ki kasbon mein bhi is tarah ke kshetra nahin hain."" (Crime and general hostility towards foreigners are virtually unknown in Greenland.)
* **B: bhaari kapde nahi le jane chahiye, kyuki wahan pure saal garam mausam rehta hai:** The passage says, ""agar aap jitna uttar ke or jayenge, utani thand begin...paryaapt germ kapade laana aavashyak hai."" (as you go further north, the cold increases...it is necessary to bring sufficient warm clothes.)
* **C: Wahan kaam karne ka nahi sochna chahiye, kyuki intenet connection slow ho sakta hai:** While the passage mentions internet connection is good (""Passage ke anusaar, Greenland jaate samay yaatriyon ko kya nahi karna chahiye""), it does not say to avoid working there due to slow internet."
"Passage ke anusaar, taiyaari na karke jaane wale yaatriyon ke liye Greenland me sabse zyada mushkil bhara kya ho sakta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Mausam (Weather)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Thand ka mausam shayed ekmatra vaastavik khatra hai jiska saamana binaa taiyari vaalon ko karna hoga. Yadi aap thand ke mausam mein greenland ke yatra karte hain... toh paryaapt germ kapade laana aavashyak hai."" (Cold weather might be the only real danger that unprepared travelers will face. If you travel to Greenland in the cold weather... then it is necessary to bring sufficient warm clothes.)

While crime is mentioned as virtually unknown, and Nordic mosquitoes can be bothersome, the cold weather and the need for appropriate clothing are highlighted as the most significant concern for unprepared travelers.
"
Inme se kise ab central plaza ke roop me istemaal kiya jata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Jardín de la Unión**.

The text explicitly states: ""Ab yah kendriya plaza ke roop mein kary karta hai."" which translates to ""Now it functions as a central plaza.""
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Jardín de la Unión me kya nahi milta?","The correct answer is **D: puraani building (old building)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Jardín de la Unión was created as an atrium for a 17th-century convent, and the Temple of San Diego is the *only* building that remains. This implies the garden itself is not a building.
* The passage mentions a ""puraani prem katha ka ghar"" (house of an old love story) referring to Callejon del Beso.
* The passage mentions restaurants surrounding the garden.
* The passage mentions free concerts in the central park gazebo.

Therefore, a *puraani building* (old building) is not something the passage says you can find *in* Jardín de la Unión. The Temple of San Diego is the only surviving old building mentioned, and it's located *within* the garden, not the garden itself.



"
"Passage ke aadhaar par, din me hiking karte samay inme se kis kathan ko galat maana jaa sakta hai?","The correct answer is **D: Din me hiking karna aese parivaaron ke liye sahi nahi hai jinme bachche hain.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Chhote bachchon waale parivar ko zyada taiyari ke zaroorat hogi, lekin chhote bachchon aur pri-school bachchon ke saath bhi ek din baahar ke ser aaramse sambhav hogi."" (Families with young children will need more preparation, but even with young children and preschoolers, a day trip outdoors is easily possible.)

This directly contradicts option D, which claims that hiking isn't suitable for families with children. The passage indicates it *is* possible, though with more preparation.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: Aasaan raaston par din me hiking ke liye thodi taiyaari ki zarurat hoti hai** - The passage says ""Saral prabhaav ke saath ek din ke vriddhi ke liye thodi taiyari kar lenny chaahiye"" (With simple effects, some preparation should be done for a day trip). This aligns.
* **B: Doori zyada ho sakti hai, lekin unhen ek din ke andar cover kiya jana chahiye** - The passage says ""ek hi din mein cover kiya jaa sakta hai"" (can be covered in one day). This aligns.
* **C: Aam taur par, thode fit log is gatividhi aa aanand le paate hain** - The passage says ""ek din baahar ke ser aaramse sambhav hogi"" (a day trip outdoors is easily possible), and it mentions ""thode fit log"" (some fit people) can enjoy it. This aligns.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, din me hiking karte samay kab kam taiyaari ki zarurat kab hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: jab hiker sharirik taur par fit ho (when the hiker is physically fit)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Koi bhi samanya roop se fit vyakti unka anand le sakta hai"" which translates to ""Any generally fit person can enjoy it."" This implies that if you are physically fit, you don't need extensive preparation for a day hike.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: jab raasta aasaan ho (when the path is easy):** While an easy path might make hiking easier, the passage doesn't explicitly connect path difficulty to preparation needed.
* **C: jab bachche hiking karne ja rahe hon (when children are going hiking):**  The passage mentions that families with young children need *more* preparation, not less.
* **D: jab hiking prakritik paryavaran me ho (when hiking is in a natural environment):** The passage says hiking typically occurs in natural environments, but this doesn't relate to the level of preparation needed.



"
"Baaki bache Norway ki tulna me, Rogland aur agder me pathaar ke baare me kya alag hai?","The correct answer is **D: Ve samanyatah heather se dhake hote hain (They are commonly covered in heather)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that in Rogland and Agder, the rocks are often called ""heyee,"" which refers to desolate, marshy land often overgrown with heather.
* The passage describes Norway's rocks as sudden, high, or low flat stones, often called ""kaupa,"" and mentions the term ""earth"" which refers to a vast, open space.
* Option D directly reflects this detail about the heather covering in Rogland and Agder.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Wahan ped hain (There are trees there):** The passage doesn't mention trees.
* **B: Wahan fjord nahi hain (There are no fjords there):** The passage doesn't mention fjords.
* **C: Pathaar zyadatar plain hain (The rocks are mostly plains):** The passage explicitly states the rocks are *not* plains, but rather sudden, high, or low flat stones.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Normay me aam taur par kya nahi hota?","The correct answer is **D: Moorland**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Norway's hills and valleys create unique features: ""a sudden high, more or less flat stone."" These stones are called ""chaudaai.""  ""Moorland"" is not mentioned as a common feature of Norway based on the provided text. The passage mentions ""Rogland and Agder"" where these stones are often called ""heyee,"" which is described as ""barren marshy land.""  Therefore, moorland is not a standard characteristic described in the passage.
"
Skiing me ruchi rakhne wale paryatakon ko hill station kab jana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Sardiyon ke mausam me (In winter)**.

The paragraph explicitly states that many hill stations offer skiing and snowboarding during the winter, when there is good snow. Therefore, tourists interested in skiing should visit during the winter season.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, aamataur par hill stussions par sabase jyaada paryatak kab aate hain?","The correct answer is **C: garmiyon ke dino mein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""bhartiya hill stussions par paryatakon ka zyada jamaavaa garmiyon ke dino mein hota hai..."" which translates to ""The highest crowd of tourists occurs in Indian hill stations during the summer days...""
"
"Agar aapko koi naav dhudhne me madad chahiye, to aapko kya nhi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **D: apne saath yatra karne waale any yatriyo ko ignore karna (Ignoring the other passengers traveling with you)**.

Here's why:

The prompt explicitly states the opposite of ignoring other passengers. It emphasizes connecting with them to understand their needs and help them find boats. Options A, B, and C are all actions encouraged in the prompt. Therefore, ignoring fellow passengers is the one action you *shouldn't* do.
"
"Agar aapko koi naav dhudhne me madad chahiye, to aapko marina me kya karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: naavikon se sampark banaayege (connect with boatmen)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""baar mein naavikonse sampark banaane ke koshish aati hai"" which translates to ""later try to connect with the boatmen."" This is a key step in helping people find the boat they're looking for.

Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Radar me rahege (Stay in the radar)**: This is irrelevant to finding boat rides.
* **C: Sirf un logon se baat karenge jo apni naav ki safai kr rhe ho (Only talk to those who are cleaning their boats)**: The passage encourages talking to *many* people, not just those cleaning boats.
* **D: apne saath yatra karne waale any yatriyo se bachege (Stay away from other passengers traveling with you)**: The passage encourages interacting with other passengers.



"
dweep ke aupaniveshik ateet mein ruchi rakhane vaale paryatak ko kaun sa sthaan pasand aaega?,"The correct answer is **A: uttari tata (northern coast)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Hangkang dweep ke shahari vikas ka jyaadaatar hissa punah nirmit bhoomi par uttari tata ke saath adhik roop se bharaa hua hai. yah wah jagah hai jahaan british upaniveshvaadiyonne apna banaaya aur isliye agar aap is jagah ke aupaniveshik ateet ke sabooton ko dhoondh rahe hain, toh yah ek achchi jagah hai.""

This directly links the northern coast to Hong Kong's colonial past and the historical remnants of British influence.
"
sarvshreshth najare prapt karne ke liye aapko kha jana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: victoria harbaur**.

The text states: ""Hangkang ke sarvshreshth naaren praapt karne ke liye, dweep ko chhonen aur covloon waterfront ke vipareet chale jaye."" which translates to ""To get the best views of Hong Kong, cross the island and go across to the opposite side of Kowloon waterfront.""  This implies that the best views are *of* Victoria Harbour.
"
kuchh kathiyon mein aisa kya hota hai jo savaar ke pair ke rakab mein phansane ke jokhim ko kam karane mein madad karta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: suraksha pattiyaan (safety straps)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically states: ""kuchh kathi, vishesh roop se angrezi kathi mein suraksha pattiyaan hoti hain jismein ek rakab chaman kathise girata hai yadi ek girata hua savaar use peechhe ke or khinchata hai.""  This translates to: ""Some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety straps in which a leather strap comes off if a falling rider is pulled backward.""  This directly addresses the risk of a rider's foot getting trapped in the stirrup and being pulled.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: kafee patale tale vaale riding boots (slippery, thickly sole riding boots):** While these provide grip, they don't directly prevent a foot from getting trapped.
* **C: chamade ki rakab (leather stirrup):** The text describes leather stirrups as *part* of the safety straps, not a solution on their own.
* **D: adhik sthirata pradhan karte hain (provide more stability):**  While stability is a benefit of a good saddle, it doesn't specifically address the risk of a foot getting trapped.



"
riding boot ki kaun si visheshata rakab ka upayog karte samay savaar ki suraksha badhaane mein madad karti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: kafee patale tale (sufficiently smooth soles)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that many riders wear riding boots with ""a smooth, sufficiently slippery sole."" This is to help prevent the rider's foot from getting caught in the stirrup if they fall.  A smooth sole allows the foot to slide out if necessary, reducing the risk of being pulled.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Chamda (Leather)**: While leather is a common material for riding boots, it's not the primary feature that enhances safety with stirrups.
* **C: Heal (Heel)**: Heels help prevent the foot from slipping *through* the stirrup, but it's the smooth sole that addresses the risk of getting *caught*.
* **D: Chaude tale (Wide soles)**: Wide soles aren't mentioned and wouldn't inherently contribute to safety in this scenario.

Therefore, the key feature of the riding boot related to stirrup safety is its smooth sole.
"
Hospitality exchange network ke madhyam se yaatriyon ko kaun si suvidhayen milti hai?,"The correct answer is **A: sthaaniya mezbaanon ke saath rahne ki suvidha**.

Here's why:

* **The passage describes the core function of hospitality exchange networks as connecting travelers with locals.** This allows travelers to stay with hosts in their destination city.
* While the passage mentions Kessy Fentonne finding a cheap flight and connecting with other travelers, these are not *direct* benefits provided *by* the hospitality exchange network itself. They are outcomes of using the network.
* The passage doesn't mention local guides.

Therefore, the primary benefit of a hospitality exchange network is staying with local hosts.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, hospitality exchange network ke sambandh mein nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan saty nhi hai?","सही उत्तर है **A: Shaharon mein yaatriyon ko hmesha sthaaniya logonse jodata hai**

यहाँ क्यों:

*   **Passage कहता है:** aisaa sangathan hai jo una shaharon mein yaatriyon ko sthaaniya logonse jodata hai... (यह संगठन उन शहरों में यात्रियों को स्थानीय लोगों से जोड़ता है...)।  ""Hamesha"" (हमेशा) शब्द का प्रयोग Passage में नहीं किया गया है। Passage केवल यह कहता है कि नेटवर्क यात्रियों को स्थानीय लोगों से जोड़ता है, लेकिन यह जरूरी नहीं है कि यह हमेशा हो।

*   **विकल्प B, C और D Passage में सही रूप से वर्णित हैं।** Passage स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि:
    *   कुछ नेटवर्क अतिरिक्त सत्यापन के लिए कहते या मांग करते हैं।
    *   शहरी में उपलब्ध मेजबानों की सूची यात्रियों को प्रदान की जाती है।
    *   कभी-कभी यात्रियों को स्थानीय लोगों की समीक्षाएं प्रदान की जाती हैं।

इसलिए, Passage के अनुसार, ""शहरों में यात्रियों को हमेशा स्थानीय लोगों से जोड़ता है"" कथन सत्य नहीं है।"
"Passage ke hisab se, saajha hostel mein kis prakaar ke yatri milane ki sambhaavana sabase kam hai?","The correct answer is **C: Bachchon ke saath waale parivar (Families with children)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""Bachchon ke saath waale parivar dikhana ek bahut hi namumkin see baat hai"" (It is a very unlikely thing to see families with children). This means families with children are the least likely type of traveler to be found in hostels.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, aam taur pr hostel me kon log rhte hai?","The correct answer is **A: Bachchon ke saath waale parivar**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Bachchon ke saath waale parivar dikhana ek bahut hi namumkin see baat hai..."" which translates to ""It is very difficult to see families with children..."" This indicates that families with children are *not* typically found in hostels. However, it *does* mention that some hostels allow them to stay in private rooms.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: 22 saal ki umr wale 3 log, jo ek sath yatra kr rhe hai:** The passage mentions that hostels are *often* for people around 20 years old, but it doesn't specify that 22-year-olds are common, or that groups of three are a regular occurrence.
* **C: 70 saal ke km umr ka pariwar:**  The passage doesn't mention older families.
* **D: Bachchon ke saath waale 2 parivar:** The passage implies that families with children are rare, not a common occurrence.



Therefore, the most accurate answer based on the passage is that families with children are rarely seen in hostels, even though some hostels may accommodate them in private rooms.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan boomerang phenkane ka sateek varnan karta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Sahi se fekane par yah apke hath me vaapas aa jata hai** (When thrown correctly, it comes back to your hand).

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Agar aap yah sikhna chahte hain ki boomerang kaise fenka jaataa hai, toh aapke paas vaapas aane wala sahi boomerang hona chaahiye."" (If you want to learn how to throw a boomerang, you need to have a boomerang that comes back.) and ""Sahi se fekane par yah apke hath me vaapas aa jata hai."" (When thrown correctly, it comes back to your hand.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Yatriyon ki apeksha sthaaniya logo me mashur hunar hai** (Boomerang is a popular skill among tourists): The passage says boomerang is a popular skill *tourists* want to learn, not that it's a popular skill among locals.
* **C: boomerang Australia mein kam upalabdh hai** (Boomerang is scarce in Australia): The passage says most boomerangs available in Australia *aren't* returning ones.
* **D: Sirf kuch hi boomerang vaapas aate hai** (Only some boomerangs come back): The passage implies that *some* boomerangs return, but not the majority available in Australia. It highlights the need for a *returning* boomerang.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kiska upayog mukhya roop se jawa ke vyanjanon mein kiya jaata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: narial chini (coconut sugar)**.

The text explicitly states: ""jawa ke vyanjanon mein pramukh swaad moongfali, mirch, chini (vishesh roop se jawa ke narial chini) aur vibhin sugandhit masalon ka hota hai"" which translates to ""The main flavors in Javanese cuisine are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various fragrant spices.""
"
"Passage ke hisab se, sankraamak rog kaise phailata hai?","The correct answer is **A: sankramit vyakti dwara (from an infected person)**.

The passage states: ""Sankraamak bimari wah bimari hai jo aas-paas ke sankramit vyakti dwara aasaanise failati hai."" which translates to ""Infectious disease is a disease that easily spreads from nearby infected individuals.""

Therefore, the disease spreads from an infected person.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Sankraamak bimari kisse nhi hoti?","The correct answer is **A: Vaccine se**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that infectious diseases are caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi, or other parasites (रोगानु).
* Vaccines are used to *prevent* infectious diseases, not *cause* them.
* Viruses, bacteria, and fungi are explicitly mentioned as causes of infectious diseases in the passage.

Therefore, vaccines are not a cause of infectious diseases according to the text.
"
Kis sthiti mein Vyaktigat VPN pradaata ke bajaay web proxy chunana upayogakarta ke lie paryaapt hoga?,"The correct answer is **C: way kewal http traffic ko dobara routet karna chahte hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage highlights the key differences between a VPN and a web proxy.** VPNs handle *all* internet traffic, while web proxies typically only handle HTTP traffic.
* **The question asks when a web proxy would be sufficient.** If a user *only* needs to route HTTP traffic (like browsing websites), a web proxy will suffice. They don't need the broader protection and functionality of a VPN.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jo saare internet traffic ko dobara routet karna chahte hai:** This is *exactly* what a VPN *does*, so it wouldn't be sufficient for a web proxy user.
* **B: Way raajneetik niyantran aur jasusi se bachna chahte hai:**  VPNs provide better security and anonymity than web proxies, so a web proxy wouldn't be a good choice for these purposes.
* **D: Way zyada bandwidth aur behtar gunvatta waali seva chahte hai:**  While some web proxies might offer good speed, VPNs are generally known for providing better and more consistent bandwidth and quality.  The passage doesn't indicate a web proxy will inherently meet this need better.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, VPN aur web proxy ke liye inme se kaun sa kathan galat hai?","The correct answer is **D: VPN sirf http trafic ko dobara routet kr skte hai**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Way kewal http hi nahin, balki saare internet traffic ko dobara routet karte hain."" (They not only route HTTP but all internet traffic.)
* **Option D contradicts this.** It claims VPNs *only* route HTTP traffic.  The passage clearly says they route *all* internet traffic.

Let's look at why the other options are correct based on the passage:

* **A: VPN, web proxy ke mukable zyada bandwidth aur behtar gunvatta waali seva pradaan karta hai:** The passage states VPNs typically provide more bandwidth and better quality service.
* **B: Web proxy se saare internet traffic ko dobara routet nhi kia ja sakta:** The passage explicitly says VPNs route all internet traffic, implying web proxies *cannot* do that.
* **C: VPN ke mukable web proxy ki seva ki gunvatta behtar nhi hoti:** The passage implies that VPNs have better quality service than web proxies.

Therefore, option D is the only statement that directly contradicts the information provided in the passage.
"
Aap apne rahne waali jagah ke phone company ka istemal kab kar sakte hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Calls internet par root kiye jaane ke vajah se**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Calls internet par root kiye jaane ke vajah se aapko apne rahne waali jagah yaa yatra karne waale asthan ke phone company ka istemal karne ke zaroorat nahin hoti hai."" This translates to: ""Because of rooting calls on the internet, you do not need to use the phone company of your place of residence or the place you are traveling.""

This directly answers the question of *when* you *cannot* use your local phone company, which is the opposite of asking *when* you *can*. The passage implies that rooting calls on the internet is the condition that allows you *not* to use your local phone company. Therefore, option A is the most logical answer.  The other options (B, C, and D) are methods of obtaining a phone number, but don't directly explain when you *would* use your local phone company.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kuch call recieve karne ke liye kya karna hoga?","Correct answer is **A: vaishvik number kharidana hoga**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Aksar, aapko alagse ek vaishvik number kharidana hoga jo pstn phone ko aapko call karne ke anumati deta hai.""  This directly translates to ""Often, you will need to buy a separate international number that allows a PSTN phone to call you.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: sthaniya ke phone company ka istemal karna hoga:** The passage says you *don't* need to use a local phone company.
* **C: aap jis samudaay mein rehte hain vahan ka sthaaniya number lena hoga:**  The passage implies you don't *have* to get a local number.
* **D: pstn phone Kharidana hoga:** The passage mentions needing a PSTN phone *in conjunction with* an international number, but doesn't say you have to buy a PSTN phone.  It's the international number that's key.

Nimnalikhit mein se kaun Italvi shabdon ke uchchaaran ka sateek varnan nhi karta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Zyaadaatar shabdon ka uchchaaran unke svar ke aadhaar par bhin hota hai.**

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states that ""zyaadaatar shabdon ka uchchaaran vaise hi kiya jaataa hai jaise unhein likhaa jaataa hai."" This directly contradicts option D.
* Options A, B, and C are all accurately described in the text. The text mentions the difference between 'r' and 'rr', the generally consistent pronunciation with spelling, and the special consideration for 'c' and 'g'.



Therefore, option D is the only one that doesn't align with the provided description of Italian pronunciation."
Emir ki nimnalikhit mein se kaun si visheshata aadhunik samay se pahale utpann hui thi?,"The correct answer is **D: laal tile vaali chhaten (red tile roofs)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the city, once the ancient city of Smyrna, *now* has a modern, developed, and busy economy. It contrasts the modern aspects with the *traditional* ones.
* Red tile roofs are a characteristic of traditional Turkish architecture and existed long before the modern development described.
* Boulevard, glass-fronted buildings, and shopping centers are all features of a modern city and therefore developed *after* the city's ancient and traditional periods.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun Emir ki sateek visheshata nhi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **B: पारंपरिक तुर्की का माहौल है**।

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि ""हालांकि शहर में पारंपरिक तुर्की की तुलना में भूमध्यसागरीय यूरोप जैसा माहौल है।"" इसका मतलब है कि यह पारंपरिक तुर्की संस्कृति का प्रतिनिधित्व नहीं करता है।

अन्य विकल्प पाठ में उल्लिखित विशेष विवरण हैं:

*   **A: शहर विशाल खाड़ी से घिरा है** - पाठ में इसका उल्लेख है।
*   **C: आपको आधुनिक शॉपिंग सेंटर और पुराने चर्च दोनों मिल जाएंगे** - पाठ में इसका उल्लेख है।
*   **D: यहाँ तुर्की का दूसरा सबसे बड़ा बंदरगाह है** - पाठ में इसका उल्लेख है।"
hanami shabd ka taatpary kis cheez ko dekhne se hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Cherry blossom**.

The text explicitly states: ""Cherry blossom dekhna hanami kahalaata hai..."" which translates to ""Watching cherry blossoms is called hanami..."" Therefore, hanami refers to the act of viewing cherry blossoms.
"
Cherry blossom dekhne ke liye pahli paartiyon ki mejabaanee kisne ki?,"The correct answer is **C: Japan ke samrat**.

The passage states: ""Japan mein, pehle cherry blossom parties ko samrat dwara kewal khud aur apne khaas samudaayon ke any sadasyon ke liye imperial nyayalaya ke aspas host kiya jaataa tha.""  This translates to ""In Japan, initially cherry blossom parties were hosted by the emperor only for himself and other members of his special communities near the imperial palace."" Since the passage refers to Japan and the emperor, option C is the most accurate."
"Passage ke hisab se, Yarushalem ka nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa pahaloo me paryatan ko sabse kam aakarshit karne ki sambhaavana hai?","The correct answer is **B: irayal ke rajdhani ke roop me**.

Here's why:

The passage states that while Jerusalem *is* the capital of Israel, most other countries and the UN *do not* recognize it as such. This implies that the disputed political status of Jerusalem is a potential deterrent to tourism, unlike its other highly attractive features.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Shahar ka dhaarmik mahatva (Religious importance of the city):** The passage explicitly mentions its religious significance as a major draw for tourism.
* **C: Saanskritik kendra ke roop me (As a cultural center):** The passage also highlights its cultural importance as a major attraction.
* **D: Kayee aitihaasik sthal hai (Having many historical sites):**  The passage emphasizes the abundance of historical sites as a key reason for its popularity.



Therefore, the fact that its capital status is disputed makes it the least likely factor to *attract* tourists, and could even *deter* some.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kisaka ullekh passage mein us roop mein nhi kiya gaya hai jisake lie yarushalem jaana jaata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Rajnitik mahatva (Political importance)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly mentions Jerusalem's rich history, religious importance (being a center for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), and cultural significance. It also mentions its tourist attractions like historical sites, ancient ruins, and vibrant shopping.

While the passage implies a certain level of political importance by mentioning that many countries don't recognize it as Israel's capital, it doesn't directly state that Jerusalem is known *for* its political importance. The focus is on its history, religion, and culture.

Therefore, the passage doesn't emphasize political importance as much as the other aspects.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kis prakaar ke yatri ko Wild card khareedne se laabh nhi hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Jo yatri sirf Crugger national park dekhna chahta hai.**

Here's why:

The passage states that a Wild Card is beneficial for seeing ""South Africa's select parks *or all South African National Parks*.""  Option B describes a tourist who *only* wants to see Kruger National Park. Since the Wild Card is more advantageous when visiting multiple parks, this type of tourist wouldn't benefit from purchasing it. The other options are incorrect because:

*   **A:** A tourist who wants to see all SANParks would definitely benefit from a Wild Card.
*   **C:** While the cost of park fees is a consideration for all tourists, the Wild Card can potentially save money in the long run.
*   **D:** A tourist who wants to see Kruger National Park along with another park would benefit from a Wild Card.



"
Kaun sa kathan Crugger national park ka sateek varnan nhi karta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: yah dakshin africa ka sabse chhota park hai**.

The text states that Kruger National Park covers 19,500 square kilometers, making it quite large.  Option C says it's the *smallest* park, which contradicts the information given. The other options are all accurately reflected in the text.
"
Nimnalikhit mein se kis parvat ke oonche bhaagon mein parvataarohiyon ke liye khatra paida karane ki sambhaavana sabase adhik hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Chhoti gufa (Small cave)**.

Here's why:

The text specifically mentions the small cave at the top having a very low height and a small ledge. This presents the most direct and immediate danger for climbers. It's not just a difficult climb; it's a potentially dangerous squeeze and maneuvering space.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Geele hone par (When wet):** While being wet makes the climb more dangerous generally, it's a condition that affects many parts of the climb, not just one specific hazard.
* **B: Pathar ke seedhiyaan (Stone stairs):** Stone stairs are a part of the climb but, with proper footing, are manageable. They are not the most *inherently* dangerous element.
* **D: Steel cable:** Steel cables are a safety aid, not a danger. They are designed to prevent falls.



Therefore, the small cave is the most direct and specific source of potential danger mentioned in the passage.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kathan passage mein varnit machu pichu parvat ki chadhaai ko sateek roop se nhi btata hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Oonche bhaagon mein khi bhi sahayak railing nhi hai**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""chadhaav waale bhaagon mein steel cable ek sahayak railing pradaan karte hain"" (In the uphill sections, steel cables provide a supportive railing). Option B contradicts this statement.

The other options are all directly mentioned in the passage:

*   **A: Fit vyakti ko sans mein takleef hone ke ummid hai:** ""Itna kahane ke baad, sans mein takleef hone ke ummid rakhein"" (After all this, expect difficulty in breathing).
*   **C: Shirsh ke paas ek chhoti gufa hai jise ooparse guzaaraa jaanaa chaahiye:** ""Shirsh ke paas ek chhoti gufa hai jise ooparse guzaaraa jaanaa chaahiye, yah kafee kam hai aur ek bahut chhota nichod hai."" (There is a small cave near the top that has to be crossed from above, it is very small and a very narrow notch).
*   **D: Oonche bhaag geele hone par khatarnak ho jate hai:** ""kyonki yah jaldi hi khatarnak ho sakta hai, visheshkar jab geele hone, kyonki yah jaldi hi khatarnak ho sakta hai."" (because it can become dangerous quickly, especially when wet).



"
"Passage ke hisab se, inamen se kaun Majercane khana ka mukhya bhojan nhi hai?","Correct answer is **C: Anaaj (Grains)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that Majercane cuisine is based on roti (flatbread), vegetables, and meat (especially pork). It mentions bread specifically as part of a popular dinner. It does *not* mention grains as a primary component. 

Therefore, the answer is **C**.
"
"Passage mein di gayi jankari ke aadhaar par, Haingi bhojan ke baare mein kaun sa kathan saty nhi hai?","The correct answer is **B: Garm pathhron ka istemal karne wale haingai wellington me milte hain.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Gadde ko yaa toh aug dwara germ pattharonse germ kiya jaataa hai yaa kuch jagahon par bhutapiya garmi swabhavik roop se zameen ke kshetras ko germ banaa detee hai."" This means hot stones are used to heat the ground for cooking, not that hot stone-using hangi are found in Wellington.
* **The passage also states:** ""Rotorua mein kayee jagah geothermal haingai pradaan karte hain..."" and ""any haingai ka christchurch, wellington aur any jagahon par namuna lia jaa sakta hai."" This supports options A, C, and D as being true based on the text.

Therefore, option B is the only statement that contradicts the information provided in the passage.
"
Haingai gadde ko garm karne ke vishisht tareeke ke roop mein nimnalikhit mein se kiska ullekh nhi kiya gya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Gas**.

Here's why:

The passage mentions two ways to heat the haingai pit:

*   **Aug (augers)** are used to heat the pit by germinating stones.
*   **Geothermal heat** naturally heats the ground in some areas.

Gas is not mentioned as a method of heating the haingai pit in the provided text. The other options (germ stones, geothermal heat) are explicitly mentioned."
Kisi sadhu yaa nunse vishesh maanyata ka kya parinaam ho sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Chamkile rung ka kapda pahana hai**.

The passage explicitly states: ""...toh aapko pravesh dwaar par sadhu yaa nunse ek pyaari see muskan milegi.""  This occurs when you bring a special, brightly colored garment.  Therefore, wearing a brightly colored garment is the action that leads to a pleasant interaction with the sadhu or nun.



Here's why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aapke kandhe bhi dhake hain:** While the passage mentions covering shoulders, it doesn't link that specifically to a special treatment from the sadhu/nun.
* **C: Mathon se sir par lapetane ka kapda lia hai:**  This action is described as a standard procedure, not something that earns a special reaction.
* **D: Ghutanon se upar ki skirts pahni hai:** The passage states skirts are *required* to cover the knees for women, not that wearing them above the knees is noteworthy.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa kapda kisi math se lene ke liye upalabdh nhi hai? ,"सही उत्तर है **B: Shorts**.

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है:

पाठ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि महिलाओं को गणित में प्रवेश करते समय स्कर्ट पहनने की आवश्यकता होती है और पुरुषों को घुटनों को ढकने वाले ट्राउजर पहनने की आवश्यकता होती है।  यह भी कहा गया है कि महिलाओं के लिए, बिना तैयारी के आने वाली महिलाओं के लिए सिर को ढकने के लिए एक कपड़ा उपलब्ध कराया जाता है। पुरुषों के लिए, ट्राउजर प्रवेश द्वार पर स्टॉक से लिए जा सकते हैं, लेकिन उन्हें हर बार उपयोग के बाद नहीं धोया जाता है।

शॉर्ट्स का उल्लेख कहीं नहीं किया गया है, और इसलिए यह संभावना है कि उन्हें गणित में प्रवेश करने के लिए उपलब्ध नहीं कराया जाता है।

इसलिए, अन्य विकल्प (स्कर्ट, ट्राउजर, सिर को ढकने का कपड़ा) पाठ में उल्लिखित हैं, जबकि शॉर्ट्स नहीं हैं।"
Antarctic kshetron mein jaate samay kisi yatri ko sitaaron ko dekhane ka sabse adhik avasar kab milega?,"The correct answer is **D: Jab prakash pradooshan kam ho** (When there is less light pollution).

Here's why:

The text explicitly states that due to the low population density and often the problem of light pollution in these areas, you can enjoy the stars.  While the other options might contribute to a good stargazing experience, the *most* direct factor mentioned is the lack of light pollution.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

*   **A: Garmiyon me (In summer):** The passage focuses on the polar night and the lack of sunlight. Summer is the opposite of that.
*   **B: Kshetra mein jansankhya bahut kam ho (When the population is very low):** While a low population contributes to less light pollution, it's not the *direct* reason for stargazing opportunities. The absence of light is the key.
*   **C: Sardiyon mein (In winter):**  This is true because of the polar night, but the passage emphasizes that light pollution is the major factor enabling star viewing.



"
Satellite phone ko kab sell phone ke asthan par upayog nhi kar sakte?,"The correct answer is **C: Ghar ke baahar rehna par**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Aam taur par satellite phone ko mobile phone ke asthan par upayog nahin kiya jaa sakta, kyonki satellite p hone se call karne ke liye aapko upgrah ke rekha par ghar ke baahar rehna pegaan."" This translates to ""Normally, satellite phones cannot be used in place of mobile phones because to make a call from a satellite, you have to be outside the terrestrial line, i.e., outside the house.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Agar upgrah ke rekha par rukawat hai to (If there is interference on the terrestrial line):** While interference *can* be a problem, the primary reason for not being able to use a satellite phone *instead of* a mobile phone is the need to be *outside* the terrestrial line.
* **B: Doorasth asthanon mein (In remote locations):** Remote locations are where satellite phones are *most* useful, not where they *can't* be used.
* **D: Agar kuchh nishchit data kharch ki aavashyakata hoti hai (If there is a need for specific data spending):** Data spending isn't the reason why satellite phones can't replace mobile phones in many situations.

Therefore, the most accurate answer is **C**."
Sell phone ki tulna mein satellite phone kab behtar hoga?,"The correct answer is **D: Sell phone me coverage nahin hone par (When there is no coverage on a cell phone)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that satellite phones are a good option *when cell phone coverage is unavailable* in remote locations.  The entire premise of the passage revolves around the lack of cell phone service and the need for a satellite phone as an alternative.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Shahar me chhitiyan manate samay (During peak hours in the city):** This is irrelevant to the primary purpose of a satellite phone, which is to overcome lack of coverage.
* **B: Jahaaz par (On an airplane):** While satellite phones can be used on airplanes, the passage doesn't highlight this as a primary benefit.  Cell phone coverage is often available on airplanes now.
* **C: Jab remote data ki jarurat na ho (When remote data is not needed):**  The passage mentions that satellite phones are used for remote data and voice services, implying that this data *is* often needed.  Therefore, this isn't a reason a satellite phone would be *better*.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kis par sangharsh ke kaaran transnistria ganarajya ka nirmaan hua?,"The correct answer is **B: Jaatiya sangharsh (Ethnic conflict)**.

The provided text explicitly states: ""Moldova ek bahu jaatiya ganarajya hai, jo jaatiya sangharshse peedit rahaa hai. 1994 mein, is sangharsh ke vajah se purvi maldova mein transnistria ganarajya ke nirmaan ghoshana hui...""

This clearly indicates that the conflict is rooted in ethnic tensions.
"
Transnistria ganarajya mein nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa hissa moldova ke baaki hisson se alag hai?  ,"The correct answer is **C: Sanyukt rashtra ki maanyata**.

Here's why:

* **Bhasha (Language):** Russian is widely used in Transnistria, just like it is in Moldova.
* **Dharm (Religion):**  While Moldova's dominant religion is Orthodox Christianity, Transnistria also has a significant Orthodox Christian population.
* **Mudra (Currency):** Transnistria has its own currency, which distinguishes it from Moldova.
* **Sanyukt Rashtra ki Maanyata (Recognition by the United Nations):** This is the key difference. Transnistria is *not* recognized by any UN member state, setting it apart from the rest of Moldova which is recognized internationally.



"
Passage ke anusaar yatri ko hawa ke mausam se bachne ke liye Montevideo kab jaana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **D: Montevideo ke sardi ke mahino mein (In Montevideo's winter months)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Sardi ka mausam bhraamak taurse thand ho sakta hai: tapman shayed hi kabhi barfila ho, lekin hawa aur namee ke gathbandhanse thermometer ke tapmanse adhik thand mahsoos ho sakti hai.""  This translates to: ""The winter season can deceptively be cold: the temperature might rarely be snowy, but the combination of wind and humidity can make it feel colder than the thermometer reading.""

Therefore, to avoid the feeling of cold due to wind and humidity, one should visit Montevideo during its winter months.
"
Passage ke anusaar yatri agar thand ke aadi nahi hain to unhe Montevideo kab jaana chahiye?,"The correct answer is **A: Jab Montevideo mein garmi hoti hai** (When it's hot in Montevideo).

Here's why:

* The passage states that Montevideo is in the subtropics and experiences temperatures often exceeding +30°C during the summer months.
* The question asks when someone who doesn't like cold should visit.
* Therefore, they should visit during the hot season, which is the summer.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Jab uttari golardh mein garmi hoti hai** (When it's summer in the Northern Hemisphere): This is not directly related to Montevideo's climate.  While the Northern Hemisphere's summer corresponds to Montevideo's winter, the passage focuses on what Montevideo experiences.
* **C: Jab Montevideo mein barish ka mausam hota hai** (When it's rainy season in Montevideo): The passage states there is no distinct rainy or dry season.
* **D: Jab uttari golardh mein sardi hoti hai** (When it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere): This corresponds to Montevideo's winter, which is described as potentially cold *feeling* due to wind and humidity, but not typically snowy. It's not the ideal time for someone who doesn't like cold.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, inmein se kya sampatti ke saath barbarta ke bajaay ek sthaapit bhiitichitra kalakar se juda maana jaayega?","The correct answer is **A: Bhittichitra karyakram**.

Here's why:

* The passage states: ""is sandarbh mein bhittichitra aksar avaidh hone ke bajaay kalakritiyonse milate julate dikhate jate hain."" (In this context, murals often look more like artworks than illegal acts.)
* It further mentions: ""...sthaapit bhittichitra kalakar, bhittichitra karyakram aur """"vaidh"""" deevaaren upalabdh hain."" (...established mural artists, mural programs, and ""legal"" walls are available.)
* This indicates that a mural *program*, associated with established artists, is a legitimate and accepted way of creating murals, distinct from illegal acts like spraying graffiti on private property.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Aspasht likhaavat (Unclear writing):** The passage contrasts this with the *established* murals, implying unclear writing is not the defining characteristic of legitimate murals.
* **C: Sarvjanik sampatti par anchaahe chitra (Random pictures on public property):** This is specifically mentioned as the type of mural often associated with vandalism, which the passage contrasts with established murals.
* **D: Avaidh tags (Illegal tags):**  This is also directly linked to the vandalism aspect of murals that the passage is differentiating from legitimate art.



"
Musical festival mein shaamil hone waale logon ke liye unka sabse aham hissa kya hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Us jagah par camp lagaana (Setting up camp there)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that ""zyaadaatar log ise apne anubhav ka ahem hissa maante hain"" (most people consider this an important part of their experience). It further explains that many attendees choose to camp near the event venue.

While the other options are mentioned, they are not presented as the *most* important aspect.  Here's a breakdown:

* **A: Chhote bachchon ke saath aana (Coming with small children):** This is only relevant to families with young children, and not a universal element of the festival experience.
* **C: Der raat tak music chalana (Music playing late at night):**  While important, it's one element of the overall festival experience, not *the* most important.
* **D: Jaldi pahunchna (Arriving early):**  The passage mentions arriving early to be close to the stage, but this is a strategy *for* a better experience, not the core of it.

Therefore, setting up camp is directly highlighted as a key and often considered essential part of the musical festival experience.
"
Passage ke anusaar festival mein aane waale adhiktar ko kya karna chahiye taaki wo music ke paas camp laga sake?,"The correct answer is **D: Jaldi pahunchna (Arrive early)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Agar aap action ke nazdeek rehna chahte hain toh aapko music ke nazdeek vaali camping site par jaldise jaldi pahunchana hoga."" (If you want to be close to the action, you must reach the camping site closest to the music as soon as possible.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Der raat ko jaana (Go late at night):** The passage says to arrive *early* to be close to the music.
* **B: Parivaaron waale ilaakon mein rukna (Stay in family areas):** This is for families with young children, not for being close to the music.
* **C: Off-site camp lagana (Set up camp off-site):** The passage talks about camping *at* the festival grounds, near the music.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, paryatakon ko uttari New Mexico mein nighlife dekhne ke liye kisse bachna chahiye?","The correct answer is **B: Chhote sheharon ke sharaabkhaane (Small town saloons)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""yahaan ke chhote kasbon ke madhushala hamesha baaharse aye paryatakon ke ghoomane ke liye acchi jagah nahin hain."" which translates to ""The saloons in the small towns are never a good place for visiting tourists.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Nagar (Cities)**: The passage says you need to visit Albuquerque or Santa Fe for a significant nightlife experience, so cities are *necessary* for nightlife, not something to avoid.
* **C: Malls**:  The passage doesn't mention malls at all.
* **D: Casinos**: The passage states that most casinos serve alcohol and host major brand entertainment, so they are *not* something to avoid.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, paryatakon ko uttari New Mexico mein mashhoor manoranjan ki jagahen kahan zyada mil sakti hain?","The correct answer is **C: Sante Fe ke paas Casino mein**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Haalaanki, oopar soochibaddh lagbhag sabhi casino peya dete hain, aur unamense kayee naam-brand manoranjan (mukhya roop se badey albuquerq aur santa fay ke aspas ke badey waale) lekar aate hain.""  (However, almost all listed casinos serve drinks, and they bring many name-brand entertainment (mainly larger ones around Albuquerque and Santa Fe).)

Therefore, the most prominent location for popular entertainment is near Santa Fe (and also Albuquerque, but Santa Fe is specifically mentioned as being close to casinos with large-brand entertainment).
"
Paise bachane waale paryatak is tarah ke pey se bachna chahenge?,"The correct answer is **C: Local beer**. Here's why:

The passage states: ""Mukhya local bear 'number one' hai, yah ek complexes bear nahin hai, balki yah aapko tajgi detee hai. any local bear ko """"manta"""" kahaa jaataa hai."" This implies the ""mukhya local bear"" (the main local beer) is a good value for money and is considered the best.  The passage then says, ""any local bear ko """"manta"""" kahaa jaataa hai,"" suggesting local beer is the preferred choice and cost-effective.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Australia ki wine:** The passage suggests New Zealand and Australia wines might be better, implying they might be more expensive.
* **B: Bottle ka paani:**  While a safer option, the passage notes it's readily available if you're worried about the local water. It doesn't imply a cost-saving benefit.
* **D: Falon ka juice:** The passage explicitly says ""falon ka juice mahanga hai lekin bahut achcha hai"" (fruit juice is expensive but very good).

Therefore, a budget-conscious traveler would want to avoid the local beer (""mukhya local bear"") and opt for the other, potentially more cost-effective, options. However, the text heavily favors the local beer being the best choice for value. Since the question asks what they'd want to *avoid*, and the local beer is implied to be a good value, it's not an option they'd avoid.  The question is phrased in a slightly misleading way, but the *best* answer based on the information is the local beer.  However, since the options ask which they would want to avoid, **D: Falon ka juice** is the closest to a correct answer given the options, as it is explicitly stated as being expensive.



"
"Passage mein bataye gaye ilaake ke anusaar, inmein se kaunsa pey sever ko uljhan mein daal sakta hai?","The correct answer is **D: Flat white**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""For Australians, the idea of 'flat white' coffee is foreign."" This means someone from Australia would likely be unfamiliar with a flat white and thus potentially confused by it.

Let's look at why the other options are less likely:

* **A: Short black:** The passage describes short black as a ""short black 'espresso'"". It doesn't suggest it's unfamiliar or confusing.
* **B: Number one:**  ""Number one"" is described as a ""mukhya local bear"" and provides a feeling of freshness. It doesn't imply unfamiliarity.
* **C: New Zealand se Sauvignon Blanc:**  The passage suggests New Zealand wine might be better than French wine. It doesn't indicate that Sauvignon Blanc specifically would be confusing.



"
"Teen sadiyon tak chala, upnivesh ka daur kis samooh ne shuru kiya tha?","The correct answer is **D: Spaniards**.

The text states: ""Spen ke logonne upanivesh call ke shuruat ke, jo teen shataabdiyon tak jaari rahaa."" (Spaniards started the colonization, which lasted for three centuries.)
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Paris ke nivasi se ghulne milne ka sabse achchha tareeka kya hai?","The correct answer is **A: Paris ke nivasi ke vyavhar ki nakal karna**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...paris mein ghulane-milane ka sabse achchha tarika abhi bhi apna sabse achcha vyavhaar karna hai, kisi aise vyakti ke tarah abhinaya karna jo """"bien alev"""" (achchi tarah se palla-badha) ho.""

""Bien alev"" implies mimicking the behavior of a Parisian – a refined, polite, and sophisticated demeanor.  The passage essentially advises you to *copy* the behavior of a Parisian to blend in. While options C and D are related to good etiquette, option A more accurately captures the essence of the passage's advice.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, inmein se kya paris ke nivasiyon ki aam aadat nahi hai?","The passage states that Parisians are often perceived as arrogant, rude, and proud. It also says this is often a misconception. The passage then advises to act like someone who is ""bien élevé"" (well-bred) to make socializing easier.

Looking at the options:

* **A: Ahankar (Arrogance):** The passage explicitly mentions Parisians being perceived as arrogant.
* **B: Asabhya (Rude):** The passage explicitly mentions Parisians being perceived as rude.
* **C: Shokhi (Playfulness):** The passage doesn't mention playfulness or being lighthearted.
* **D: Achanak kuch kar dena (Doing something suddenly):** The passage doesn't mention impulsive behavior.

Therefore, the answer is **C: Shokhi (Playfulness)** because the passage does not attribute playfulness to the residents of Paris.
"
Cape Town ki Metro Rail ki pratham shreni ka faayda kya hai?,"सही जवाब है **B: Zyada log nahi hote**

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

प्रश्न सीधे तौर पर ""प्रatham श्रेणी (Metro Plus) का फायदा क्या है?"" पूछता है। पाठ स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि Metro Plus ""अधिक आरामदायक और कम भीड़ वाला"" होता है।

अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:

*   **A: Dabba train ke aage hota hai:** पाठ में बताया गया है कि Metro Plus हमेशा ट्रेन के पीछे होता है।
*   **C: Yeh teesri shreni ke ticket se kum daam ka hota hai:** पाठ में कहा गया है कि यह यूरोपीय मेट्रो टिकटों से सस्ता है, न कि तीसरी श्रेणी के टिकट से।
*   **D: Yeh metroticket ke daam ka hota hai:** यह विकल्प अस्पष्ट है और पाठ में दिए गए जानकारी से सीधे तौर पर संबंधित नहीं है।"
"Passage ke anusaar, Cape Town ki har local train mein kya hota hai?","The correct answer is **D: Dono pehli aur teesri shreni ke dabbe**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Har train mein metro plus aur metro dabbe hote hain..."" (Every train has Metro Plus and Metro carriages...)
* Metro Plus is described as the first class (pratham shreni) and Metro is the third class.

Therefore, each train has carriages for both the first class (Metro Plus) and third class (Metro).

Inmein se kya jaanvaron ke keede nahi karte?,"सही उत्तर है **D: गंभीर चोट लगना**

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

प्रसंग बताता है कि कीड़े (keat) आमतौर पर जानवर और कीड़े होते हैं जो यात्रियों के लिए समस्या पैदा करते हैं। ये कीड़े भोजन को दूषित कर सकते हैं, बीमारियों को फैला सकते हैं, एलर्जी पैदा कर सकते हैं, और यहां तक कि संक्रमण भी फैला सकते हैं।

* **कहरों का लगना (Kharonch maarna):** कीड़े (जैसे मच्छर, मक्खियां, आदि) के कारण कहरों का लगना एक आम समस्या है।
* **एलर्जी करना (Allergy karna):** कुछ कीड़े एलर्जी पैदा कर सकते हैं।
* **संक्रमण करना (Sankraman karna):** कीड़े बीमारियाँ फैला सकते हैं।
* **गंभीर चोट लगना (Gambhir chot lagna):** गंभीर चोटें अक्सर जानवर द्वारा होती हैं, कीड़े द्वारा नहीं। प्रसंग में विशेष रूप से कहा गया है कि संक्रमण फैलाने वाले खतरनाक जानवर कीड़े नहीं माने जाते हैं।

इसलिए, गंभीर चोट लगना कीड़ों से संबंधित नहीं है, बल्कि जानवरों से संबंधित है।"
Prepaid phone cards ko kahan khareeda jaa sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Kone ki dukaanon par (Corner shops)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""har koney ki dukan pre-paid phone card ke ek bhraamak kataar se bhar jaati hai..."" which translates to ""every corner shop is filled with a deceptive row of pre-paid phone cards...""

While the other options *might* sometimes sell them, the passage directly points to corner shops as a primary place to find them.
"
Kuch cards dwara behtar call darein kaise mil sakti hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Toll-free numbers se** (From toll-free numbers).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""In services are often accessible through a toll-free telephone number which can be called from most phones without any charge.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Khaas deshon meon hi mil sakti hain** (Only available in certain countries) - While some cards might be specific to certain countries, the text focuses on how to *access* better calls, not necessarily where they are available.
* **C: Kone ki dukaan par** (At the corner shop) -  While you buy the card at the shop, the question asks how to get *better calls* through the card.
* **D: Pay phone ka isteymaal karke aur kuch atirikt shulk dekar** (By using a pay phone and paying an extra charge) - The text doesn't mention needing to pay extra to get better calls. It focuses on toll-free numbers.

"Passage ke hisaab se, Plitvice Lakes national park mein inmein se kaunsa ped kum paaya jaata hai?","The passage states that the Plitvice Lakes National Park is mainly surrounded by **beach, spruce, and fir trees**. Oak trees are not mentioned.

Therefore, the correct answer is **B: Oak**.
"
Inmein se kaunsa durlabh jeev-jantu Plitvice Lakes national park mein mil sakta hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Honey Badger** and **D: Capercaillie**.

The text specifically mentions that ""European honey badger"" and ""capercaillie"" can be found in Plitvice Lakes National Park.

Therefore, both B and D are correct based on the provided text. Since the question asks for *which* of the durlabh jeev-jantu, and both are listed, either would be considered acceptable. However, in a multiple choice setting where only one answer is usually expected, and assuming the question intends a single best answer, the inclusion of ""European honey badger"" (Honey Badger) is more specific to the information given.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, sthaniye codes kis cheez mein madad karte hain?","Correct answer is **B: Bazaar ko niyatran mein rakhne**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Vaastavik uddeshya un companiyon ko apne bazaron par adhik niyantran denaa hai..."" (The real intention of these companies is to have more control over their markets...)

The passage also says that local codes have no effect on illegal copying, dismissing the claim that they prevent piracy. Therefore, options A, C, and D are incorrect.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, media companiyon dwara sthaniye codes ke baare mein kya jhooth bola jaata hai?","The correct answer is **B: Inse avaidh nakal roki jaa sakti hai**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Vaastav mein, asthaaniya code ka avaidh nakal par koi prabhaav nahin padata; bilkul usi tarah jaise ek disc ki bit-for-bit copy kisi bhi device par vaisi hi chalegi jakis asal disc chalti hai."" This means that local codes *cannot* stop illegal copying, which is the lie the media companies are telling.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Bazaar par adhik niyantran ke liye ye zaroori hain:** While the passage mentions control over markets as the *real* intention, it doesn't say they lie *about* this. It lies *about* the effectiveness of local codes.
* **C: Paise ki kataai mein aham hai:** The passage says this is a *consequence* of the lies, not the lie itself.
* **D: Inse piracy durlabh hi roki jaa sakti hai:** This is the opposite of what the passage says. It claims local codes *don't* stop piracy.



"
"Apni matrbhoomi mein aane par, kaunsi baat anaupcharik hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Immigration checks**.

The passage states that immigration checks are *not* typically common when coming to one's homeland, but are *formal*. Therefore, immigration checks are considered unofficial in that context. The other options are either formal procedures or descriptions of rules, not things that are typically *not* done.
"
Apni matrbhoomi mein aate samay aapko inmein se kya pata hona chahiye?,"The correct answer is **D: Kya aapke dwara laye gaye kisi samaan ko anumati nahi hai (Whether the goods you have brought in do not have permission).**

Here's why:

The prompt emphasizes being aware of what you *can* and *cannot* bring into your homeland.  It also highlights the importance of declaring anything exceeding legal limits.  Option D directly addresses this core concern – knowing if your belongings have the necessary permission or are prohibited.

Here's why the other options are less directly relevant:

*   **A: Kya immigration chauki hogi (Whether there will be an immigration checkpoint):** While it *might* happen, the prompt focuses more on the content of what you're carrying, not the likelihood of a checkpoint.
*   **B: Kya kanuni seema se upar ka samaan batana hoga (Whether goods exceeding the legal limit will need to be declared):** This is related, but D is a more comprehensive concern. Knowing *what* isn't allowed is as important as knowing about exceeding legal limits.
*   **C: Kya seema shulk niyantran hoga (Whether there will be border tax control):** This is a specific type of control and not the overall focus of the prompt.

Therefore, understanding whether your belongings require permission or are prohibited is the most important thing to know when returning to your homeland, according to the prompt."
"Passage ke anusaar, kis cheez ki bahutayat se parvatarohiyon ko Cochamó Valley mein naye raaste milte rehte hain?","The correct answer is **D: deewaaren (walls)**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""...duniya bhar ke parvatarohi iski divaaron ki anthin sambhaavanaon ke bich lagaatar naye-naye raaste banaa rahe hain.""  This translates to: ""...mountain climbers are continuously creating new paths among the potential within its walls.""

Therefore, the climbers are finding new routes within the **walls** of the Kokomo Ghaati.
"
"Passage ki jaankari ke anusaar, dakshini golardh mein sabse zyada crossings kaun cover karta hai?","The correct answer is **B: Star Alliance**.

The passage states: ""Haalaanki, star alliance mein purvi dakshin prashant ko chhor kar Santiago day chili se Tahiti tak sub kuch shamil hai..."" which translates to ""However, in Star Alliance, everything from Santiago de Chile to Tahiti is included except for the eastern South Pacific..."" This indicates that Star Alliance covers the most transoceanic crossings in the Southern Hemisphere mentioned in the passage.

The other options are incorrect:
* **SkyTeam:** The passage explicitly states SkyTeam doesn't cover any of the three major ocean crossings.
* **South Pacific:** The South Pacific is a region, not an airline alliance.
* **LATAM Oneworld:** LATAM Oneworld is a specific flight route within the Star Alliance network, not the entire alliance.
"
Dakshini golardh mein kaunsi airline sabse kum crossings cover karti hai?,"The correct answer is **D: SkyTeam**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Koi bhi airline gathbandhan dakshini golardh mein sabhi teen mahasagar crossing ko cover nahin karta hai (aur Sky Team inmein se koi bhi cover nahin karti hai)."" This directly indicates that SkyTeam is the airline alliance that *doesn't* cover all three major ocean crossings in the Southern Hemisphere, making it the one with the fewest crossings covered.

The other options are incorrect:

* **Star Alliance:** The passage mentions Star Alliance *does* cover a significant portion of the Southern Hemisphere, specifically from Santiago, Chile to Tahiti.
* **South Pacific:** This isn't an airline alliance, but a region.
* **LATAM Oneworld:** This is a specific flight route within the Oneworld alliance, not a general covering of crossings.



"
Kis sangathan ne Global Running Tours mein safalta paayi?,"The correct answer is **B: Go Running Tours**.

The passage states that Go Running Tours is the ""Uttaradhikari"" (successor/parent company) of Global Running Tours and operates dozens of perspectives across four continents. It then mentions Barcelona and Copenhagen as examples of their tours, and that Prague is joining soon.  Therefore, Go Running Tours achieved success with Global Running Tours.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Go Running Tours kitne drishti se chalne waale sangathano ko jodne mein madad karte hain?","The correct answer is **A: Chaar**.

The passage states: ""Global running tours ke uttaradhikari, go running tours chaar mahadweepon par darjanon drishti se chalane waale pradaata hain."" This translates to: ""The successor to global running tours, Go Running Tours connects dozens of providers across four continents."" While ""darjanon"" means dozens, the question asks how many continents Go Running Tours connects providers *across*. The passage explicitly states four continents.
"
Paryatak ko cheetah sabse saaf tareeke se dekhne ke liye kya karna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Doorbeen ka istemaal**

Here's why:

The text states: ""Kabhi-kabhi sher, chite aur tendue sharmile hote hain. aap unhein doorbeen ke zariye achchi tarah se dekh paayenge."" This translates to: ""Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy. You can see them clearly with binoculars.""

While walking safaris (options A & B) *might* offer opportunities to see cheetahs, the text specifically highlights the use of binoculars for *clearly* seeing them, especially when they are shy. Option D is incorrect as binoculars are better than only standard equipment.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, safari mein vaahan mein aagantuko ko kis tarah ka janwar dekhne ko mil sakta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Lions**.

The passage states: ""Kabhi-kabhi sher, chite aur tendue sharmile hote hain. aap unhein doorbeen ke zariye achchi tarah se dekh paayenge."" which translates to ""Sometimes lions, cheetahs, and leopards are shy. You can see them well with binoculars.""

While giraffes and cheetahs are mentioned as animals that can be seen, the passage specifically mentions lions.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, tour ki keemat kisse kum hogi?","The correct answer is **D: Chh ya zyada logon ka samuh khojkar** (Finding a group of six or more people).

The passage states: ""taaki aapko prati vyakti ke hisaab se padne wala kharch kam ho jaye"" which translates to ""so that the cost per person is reduced.""  This happens when you join a group of four to six people or more.  Option D accurately reflects this.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, kise sasbe achchhi tour ki dar milegi?","The correct answer is **D: Paanch ka samuh (A group of five)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""taaki aapko prati vyakti ke hisaab se padne wala kharch kam ho jaye"" which translates to ""so that the cost per person is reduced.""  This implies that a larger group will result in a lower cost per individual.  Of the choices provided, a group of five (chaar se chhah logon ko jodne ki koshish karein - try to join four to six people) is the most likely to significantly reduce the cost per person.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Paryatak jo car badal sakte hain (Tourists who can change cars):** This is irrelevant to the cost of a tour.
* **B: Teen ka samuh (A group of three):** While better than traveling alone, a group of three won't reduce the cost as much as a larger group.
* **C: Saath yatra kar rahe do dost (Two friends traveling together):** This is the scenario the passage *discourages* as it doesn't leverage the cost-saving benefits of a larger group.



Therefore, a group of five is the option that best aligns with the passage's advice on minimizing the cost per person."
"Passage ke anusaar, San Francisco ko duniya bhar mein mashur kisne kiya?","The correct answer is **A: Kala aur media ke kai prakaaron ka hona (The continuous presentation of music, films, literature, and popular culture)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Sangeet, films, saahitya aur lokpriya sanskriti ke lagaatar prastuti karan shahar aur iski khaas jagahon ko duniya bhar mein mashur karne mein madad ki hai."" (The continuous presentation of music, films, literature, and popular culture has helped to make the city and its special places famous around the world.)

While the other options mention aspects of San Francisco's economy, the passage directly links its fame to its vibrant cultural scene.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, San Francisco ke baare mein inmein se kaunsi baat sahi nahi hai?","The correct answer is **D: Arthvyavastha poori tarah paryatan par nirbhar hai (The economy is entirely dependent on tourism)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states that San Francisco's economy is diverse.** It lists several major sectors beyond tourism: professional services, government jobs, finance, and business. 
* Option A is supported by the passage mentioning ""sangeet, films, saahitya"" (music, films, literature) contributing to the city's fame.
* Option B is supported by the passage stating ""dusre asiai pakwan, jaise ki koriyai, thaai, bhartiya aur japani ke liye, desh ke sabse acchi jagahon mein se San Francisco bhi ek hai"" (San Francisco is one of the best places in the country for other Asian cuisines, such as Korean, Thai, Indian and Japanese).
* Option C is supported by the passage mentioning ""kayee hotel, restaurant, aur sarvottam sammelan ke suvidhaon ke saath ek bada paryatak buniyaadi dhancha viksit kiya hai"" (has developed a large tourism infrastructure with many hotels, restaurants, and excellent convention facilities).

Therefore, the statement that the economy is *entirely* dependent on tourism is incorrect, as the passage provides evidence of a more diversified economic base.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, travel agent ki sevaon ka kis tarah ka yatri faayda nahi utha sakta?","सही उत्तर है **A: Faisla ना ले सकने वाला यात्री**।

यहाँ कारण दिया गया है:

* **Passage में कहा गया है:** ""Agar aap offer ke baare mein sochne yaa destination ke liye document (jaise visa) paane ke liye samay chahte hain, toh way aapko reservation ki suvidha bhi de sakte hain.""  इसका मतलब है कि ट्रैवल एजेंट आपको निर्णय लेने के लिए समय देता है।
* **अन्य विकल्प गलत क्यों हैं:**
    * **B: अचानक कुछ करने वाला यात्री:**  ट्रैवल एजेंट बुकिंग करने से पहले जानकारी प्रदान करते हैं, जिससे अचानक यात्रा की योजना बनाने वाले यात्री भी लाभ उठा सकते हैं।
    * **C: जिस यात्री ने अब तक अपना वीजा सुरक्षित नहीं किया है:** Passage स्पष्ट रूप से कहता है कि किसी भी शोध या अनुरोध के लिए, यात्री को पहले ट्रैवल एजेंट के माध्यम से संपर्क करना चाहिए। यह उन यात्रियों के लिए महत्वपूर्ण है जिन्होंने अभी तक वीजा प्राप्त नहीं किया है।
    * **D: जिस यात्री को पैकेज डील पसंद हों:** Passage बताता है कि ट्रैवल एजेंट अक्सर विशेष होटल डील और पैकेज डील पेश करते हैं।

इसलिए, उन यात्रियों को लाभ नहीं होता जो निर्णय लेने में असमर्थ हैं, क्योंकि ट्रैवल एजेंट उन्हें सोचने और समय लेने की अनुमति देते हैं।"
Passage mein inmein se kya travel agent se booking karne ka faayda nahi bataya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Yatra ke dastavezo mein jaldi (Getting travel documents quickly)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly mentions that you should inquire about documentation *through* the travel agent, not directly with the hotel. It doesn't say the travel agent guarantees faster documentation.
* The passage highlights benefits like special hotel deals, all-inclusive packages (breakfast, transport, hotel), and the ability to hold a reservation. 

Therefore, the passage doesn't state that travel agents help with getting travel documents quickly. The passage suggests you should go through them, but doesn't guarantee expedited processing.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Real-time text translator apps kya nahi kar sakti?","The correct answer is **D: 100% baar sahi anuvaad karna (Translate 100% correctly every time)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""...kyonki ab bhi mumkin hai ki sub kuch galat ho raha ho. (because it's still possible that everything is going wrong.)""
* It also mentions that while translation engines have improved, ""bakwas kafei hadd tak kam hua (nonsense has been reduced significantly).""  This implies that errors still occur.
* Option D directly reflects this point – real-time translation apps are not guaranteed to be 100% accurate.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Videshi bhasha ke sandesh ka anuvaad karna (Translate messages in foreign languages):** The passage mentions this capability directly (""Jab upayog karta smart phone ko object ki ore karta hai, toh is shreni ke kuch application sanketon par text yaa vaastavik duniya mein videshi bhaashaon mein anuvaad kar sakte hain. (When using, if the smartphone is pointed at an object, some applications in this category can translate text or in the real world in foreign languages.)"")
* **B: Poore text khand ka anuvaad karna (Translate entire text segments):**  The passage states this as a key feature of real-time translation apps (""Poore text khand ka anuvaad karna (Translate entire text segments)"").
* **C: Cheezon par maujood text ka smartphone se anuvaad karna (Translate text on things from the smartphone):** This is also mentioned directly (""Cheezon par maujood text ka smartphone se anuvaad karna (Translate text on things from the smartphone)"").



"
Offline anuvaad kisse hote hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhasha ka data download karna** (Downloading language data).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""google translate hai, jo man chaahi bhasha data download karne ke baad offline anuvaad karne deta hai"" (Google Translate is one of the most important apps in this category, which allows for offline translation after downloading the desired language data).

While the other options contribute to offline translation, the passage highlights *downloading language data* as the key enabling factor.

* **A: Behtar anuvaad engines** (Better translation engines) are important for *quality* of translation, but not directly for *offline* functionality.
* **B: Smartphones** are the device used to *run* the app, but not the reason for offline translation.
* **D: Real-time anuvaad shreni mein applications** (Real-time translation apps) is the category, but not the *mechanism* for offline translation.
"
Inmein se kya Himaskhalan ka trigger nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Manav (Humans)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that avalanches can be triggered by various factors, including:

*   **Suraj dwara burn ko garm karna** (Sun warming the snow)
*   **Thodi barfbari** (Light snowfall)
*   **Anya praakritik ghatnaayein** (Other natural events)
*   **Aksar manushya ko prerit karne waali mool ghatna hoti hai** (Often a primary event that inspires humans - implying human action can be a trigger).

The passage explicitly lists sun, snowfall, and other natural events as triggers. While humans *can* trigger avalanches, the passage doesn't say they *always* do, or that they're a fundamental, inherent trigger like the others. The other options (chipchipi barf and atirikt barfbaari) are also mentioned as potential triggers.

Therefore, while humans *can* be a trigger, the passage doesn't define them as a *necessary* or *inherent* trigger in the same way that natural events are. So, humans is the best answer because the other three options are mentioned in the text as potential triggers, while humans is only mentioned as the source of the triggering event.



"
Passage ke anusaar inmein se kya himaskhalan ki tarah neeche aata hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Chipchipi barf jo trigger na hui ho (Sticky snow that hasn't been triggered)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states, ""Samasya yah hai ki barf chipchipi hai, isliye ise niche aane ke liye kuch triggering ke aavashyakta hoti hai..."" (The problem is that the snow is sticky, therefore it needs a triggering event to come down...).
* This means sticky snow doesn't move on its own; it needs something to start the slide.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Bina barf waali khadi chadhai (Snow-free steep slope):** The passage discusses snow slides (himaskhalan), so a snow-free slope wouldn't be relevant.
* **C: Khadi chadhai par zyada barf (A steep slope with a lot of snow):** While a steep slope with a lot of snow *can* lead to a slide, the passage focuses on the *sticky* nature of the snow and the need for a trigger. The amount of snow alone doesn't guarantee a slide.
* **D: Logon dwara anchhui barf (Snow pushed by people):**  The passage mentions natural triggers like sunlight, snowfall, and other natural events.  While people can push snow, this isn't explicitly mentioned as the *only* trigger and isn't the core problem discussed in the passage.

Therefore, the passage highlights the sticky nature of the snow and the necessity of a trigger for it to slide, making **A** the most accurate answer."
"Passage ke anusaar, kya cheezen curry ki aadhar hain?","The correct answer is **B: Jadi-bootiyan aur masale**.

The passage states: ""Curry ek aisaa vyanjan hai jise maans ya sabziyon saath jadi-bootiyan aur masale milakar banaaya jaataa hai."" (Curry is such a dish which is made by mixing meat or vegetables with herbs and spices.)

While dahi and nariyal ka doodh are used *in* curries, the passage identifies *jadi-bootiyan aur masale* (herbs and spices) as a core component, along with meat or vegetables.
"
"Kuch ilaakon mein, kiski jagah nariyal ke doodh ka istemaal kiya jaata hai?","The correct answer is **B: Sabjiyan**.

The text states: ""Dakshini Bharat mein aur upmahadweep ke kuch anya tateeya kshetron mein aam taur par nariyal ke doodh ka upayog kiya jaataa hai."" and earlier it mentions ""Uttari Bharat aur Pakistan ke antardeshiya kshetron mein aam taur par dahi ka upayog curry mein kiya jaataa hai.""  This implies that where dahi is commonly used in the North and Pakistan, coconut milk is commonly used in the South and other parts of the subcontinent.  The text doesn't specify *what* the coconut milk replaces *in terms of ingredients*, but it strongly suggests it's used where dahi is used.  Since the text mentions dahi is used with meat and vegetables, it logically follows that coconut milk replaces dahi when used with vegetables.
"
Pahadi maidan tak aane ke liye Transantarctic parvaton ke chaaro ore ek lamba chakkar kyu lagana padta hai?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Ross samudra se yatra ki tulna mein ye aasaan hai**

यहाँ क्यों:

प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि ""पहाड़ी मैदान तक आने के लिए ट्रांसअंटार्कटिक पर्वतों के चारों ओर एक लंबा चक्कर लगाना पड़ता है।"" इसका मतलब है कि सीधे जाने का कोई आसान रास्ता नहीं है। विकल्प D सुझाव देता है कि भले ही लंबा चक्कर लगाना पड़ता है, फिर भी यह रॉस सागर से यात्रा करने से बेहतर है। अन्य विकल्प सीधे तौर पर इस बात की व्याख्या नहीं करते कि ट्रांसअंटार्कटिक पर्वतों के चारों ओर चक्कर क्यों लगाना पड़ता है:

*   **A: McMurdo Station aksar band rehta hai:** स्टेशन के बंद होने से यात्रा रूट प्रभावित हो सकता है, लेकिन यह पर्वतों के चारों ओर चक्कर लगाने का मुख्य कारण नहीं है।
*   **B: Thos barf khatarnak hoti hai:** बर्फीली जमीन खतरनाक हो सकती है, लेकिन यह स्वचालित रूप से ट्रांसअंटार्कटिक पर्वतों के चारों ओर चक्कर लगाने के लिए मजबूर नहीं करती है।
*   **C: Vishesh tractors tez nahi hote:** ट्रैक्टरों की गति धीमी होने से यात्रा में समय लगता है, लेकिन यह पर्वतों के चारों ओर चक्कर लगाने का कारण नहीं है।

इसलिए, विकल्प D सबसे उपयुक्त व्याख्या प्रदान करता है।"
Dakshini dhruv par jhando se kya chinhit hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Barf se bhare himvider (Ice-filled snowdrifts)**.

The passage states: ""ise kewal vishesh tractors dwara le jaya jaa sakta hai, jismein khinch kar le jaane waali slays ke saath eendhan aur aapoorti ho. **yah daraaren bhari hui aur jhande dwara chihnit thos barf hai**.""  This translates to: ""It can only be taken by special tractors, which have towing slays with fuel and supplies. **This is solid snow filled with cracks and marked with flags**.""

Therefore, the flags mark the ice-filled snowdrifts along the route.
"
Passage mein aisa kya nahi likha hai jo dakshini Africa mein ghoomte samay paryatakon ko pata hona chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Dakshin Africa ke lagbhag sabhi padosi desh sthir hain (South Africa's almost all neighboring countries are stable)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that while South Africa is peaceful, its neighboring countries are *not*. This directly contradicts option C.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned in the passage:

* **A: Alag alag deshon mein visa ko lekar alag kanoon hain (Different countries have different laws regarding visas):**  The passage clearly mentions that visa requirements and fees vary by country and also depend on the traveler's origin.
* **B: Ubad khabad raaste par maujood jagahon par car se jaana behtar hota hai (It's better to travel by car to places off the beaten path):** The passage states that exploring beyond typical tourist spots is a great way to experience South Africa, and that a car (especially a 4x4) is suitable for this.
* **D: Agar car se yatra kar rahe hain to 4x4 ka sujhaav diya jaata hai (A 4x4 is suggested if traveling by car):**  The passage advises that a 4x4 is recommended, particularly for exploring areas off the beaten path and because of potentially challenging road conditions.



Therefore, option C is the only statement *not* found in the passage.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, car se dakshin africa ghoomne waale parytakon ke liye kya salah kharab maani jaayegi?","The correct answer is **C: Car se yatra un logon ke liye achchha vikalp hai jo aam raaston se alag jaana chahte hain**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""car se dakshini Africa mein pravesh karna sabhi kshetra ke sundarta ko dekhne ke saath-saath samanya paryatan maargon se hatkar anya asthanon par jaane ka ek adbhut tarika hai."" (Entering South Africa by car is a wonderful way to see the beauty of all areas along with going to other places away from common tourist routes.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Kanooni roop se car mein kuch khaas samaan rakhna padega:** The passage mentions that laws vary by country regarding emergency supplies, but doesn't say it's a general requirement to carry *specific* items.
* **B: Waise 4x4 ki salah di jaati hai, lekin adhiktar jagahon ko samany vahan se bhi ghooma jaa sakta hai:** The passage says *many* areas can be reached with a standard vehicle, but it *strongly recommends* a 4x4 for some areas, especially considering the instability in neighboring countries.
* **D: Dakshini Africa ka har padosi desh ghoomne ke lihaj se theek nahi hai:** The passage mentions legal requirements and emergency supplies vary *by country of origin* - not that South Africa's neighbors are inherently ""not okay"" to visit.



Therefore, option C best reflects the passage's main point about the benefits of traveling in South Africa by car, especially for those who want to explore beyond the typical tourist routes."
Passage mein apne bags khaali chhodne par kya khatra nahi bataya gaya hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Kisi aur ka samaan samjha jaa sakta hai**.

Passage में bags को खाली छोड़ने के खतरे के बारे में निम्नलिखित बातें बताई गई हैं:

* **आप अनजाने में drug वाहक बन सकते हैं:** यह मुख्य खतरा है जिस पर जोर दिया गया है।
* **Bag चोरी हो सकते हैं:** यह एक संभावित खतरा है जिसका उल्लेख किया गया है।
* **अधिकारी बम के खतरे से आकर्षित हो सकते हैं:** यह भी एक संभावित खतरा बताया गया है।

लेकिन passage में यह नहीं बताया गया है कि bags को खाली छोड़ने से किसी और का सामान गलत समझा जा सकता है।

इसलिए, विकल्प C गलत है क्योंकि passage में इसका उल्लेख नहीं किया गया है।"
Passage mein drug vaahak ke baare mein kya nahi bataya gaya hai?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Adhikari aapke bags japt kar sakte hain, chahe aap drugs na le jaa rahe hon.**

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* **Passage** स्पष्ट रूप से बताता है कि ड्रग-स्नफिंग कुत्तों द्वारा किसी भी समय किसी भी बैग को बिना किसी चेतावनी के ले जाया जा सकता है, भले ही उसमें ड्रग्स न हों। यह बैग के चोरी होने या अधिकारियों का ध्यान आकर्षित करने के खतरे को भी इंगित करता है।
* **विकल्प D** कहता है कि अधिकारी आपके बैग को जब्त कर सकते हैं, भले ही आप ड्रग्स न ले जा रहे हों। Passage ऐसा दावा नहीं करता। Passage का मुख्य ध्यान ड्रग्स को अनजाने में ले जाने के खतरे और इसके परिणाम पर है।

अन्य विकल्प Passage में उल्लिखित हैं:

* **विकल्प A:** Passage में कहा गया है कि कुछ देशों में पहली बार अपराध करने वालों को 10 साल या उससे अधिक की जेल या मौत की सजा हो सकती है।
* **विकल्प B:** Passage में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है कि अंतर्राष्ट्रीय यात्रा करते समय विशेष ध्यान रखना चाहिए।
* **विकल्प C:** Passage में ड्रग-स्नफिंग कुत्तों द्वारा बिना किसी चेतावनी के किसी भी समय किसी भी बैग को ले जाने की बात कही गई है।

इसलिए, केवल **विकल्प D** Passage में उल्लिखित जानकारी का सटीक विपरीत है।"
Kis tarah ka pey ghar par chhutti ke dauraan banane ke baare mein nahi bataya gaya hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Beer**.

The text suggests making smoothies or blending drinks, and mentions going to a bar/pub, but it doesn't specifically mention making or consuming beer at home during vacation. Therefore, beer is the drink type not discussed.
"
"Agar aapka shehar apni peene ki sanskriti ke liye jaana jaata hai, to aapko chhutti ke dauraan kahan jaana chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Pubs jahan aap aam taur par nahi jaate** (Pubs where you don't usually go).

Here's why:

The passage suggests exploring a bar or pub that is *different* from your regular hangout if you're in a city known for its drinking culture. Option C directly reflects this advice.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

*   **A: Aapke pados se baahar ke coffee shops:** While a good idea for a coffee, it doesn't specifically address the advice about exploring a different drinking culture.
*   **B: Juice ya smoothie ke shops:** This is related to making smoothies, not exploring the local drinking scene.
*   **D: Chamomile chai banane waale restaurants:**  This is related to relaxation and tea, not the city's drinking culture.



"
Kabooraton ki moortiyan kahan hain?,"The correct answer is **B: Church ke parisar mein** (In the church premises).

The passage explicitly states: ""Church ke parisar mein, kuch kabron par kabootaron ke sangamarmarse banaai gayi dilchasp moortiyaan hain."" (In the church premises, interesting sculptures have been made on some graves with pigeon mosaics.)
"
Kis tarah ke visa mein vyakti ko aarthik sahyog ka saboot dikhana padta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Chhaatr visa**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Chhaatr visa mein aam taur par ek samanya paryatak yaa vyaavsaayik visa se alag zarooratein aur aavedan prakriyaaen hoti hain. Adhikansh deshon ke liye, aapko us sansthan se ek prastaav patra ki aavashyakta hogi, jahan par aap adhyayan karna chahte hai aur course ke pehle varsh mein khud ke kharche ke liye dhan ka saboot bhi.""

This directly indicates that a student visa requires proof of financial support for the first year of studies.
"
Kise badhi tareekh ke visa ki zaroorat padegi?,"The correct answer is **C: Antarrashtriya Chhaatr (International Student)**.

The text explicitly states that international students, unlike typical tourists or business travelers, often need a visa for longer stays and face different requirements and application processes for a student visa.
"
Aapko machchharon par khaas savdhani kab rakhni chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Varshavan ke beech (During the monsoon)**.

The passage specifically states that you need to be cautious of mosquitoes ""agar aap uposhnakatibandhiya varshaavan ke beech se jaane ke baare mein sochte hai"" (if you think about traveling through the monsoon). While mosquitoes might be present in summer and when driving, the passage emphasizes the monsoon as the key time to be alert.
"
"Passage ke anusaar, aapko varshavan mein gaadi chalate samay machchharon se bachne ke liye kya nahi karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Vahan ke darwaze zyada der tak khule rakhna**.

Here's why:

The passage states that mosquitoes have enough time to enter the car when the doors are open for even a few seconds. Therefore, avoiding leaving the doors open for extended periods is key to preventing mosquito entry.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Garmiyon ke dauran gaadi chalana:** The passage doesn't say that driving in summer is a problem; it focuses on the monsoon season.
* **C: Uposhnakatibandhiya ilaakon mein gaadi chalana:** The passage suggests that driving in areas with high mosquito populations (uposhnakatibandhiya) is problematic.
* **D: Chadhai karte samay vahan khaali chhod dena:** The passage doesn't mention anything about leaving the car empty while driving uphill.



"
"Passage ke anusaar, Sundarbans ke baare mein inmein se kya baat sahi nahi hai?","The correct answer is **B: Iska aadha ilaaka daldal mein hai (Its half area is in swamps)**.

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Sunderban 3,850 varg kilometres mein phaila hai, jismein se karib ek tihai mein paani/daldal wala ilaka hai."" (Sundarbans is spread over 3,850 square kilometers, of which almost one-third is water/swampy area.) This means only *one-third* is swampy, not half.

Let's look at why the other options are correct according to the passage:

* **A: Ismein kuch bache hue shaktishaali jungle hain (It has some remaining powerful jungles):** The passage explicitly says ""way kuch antim shaktishali jungles mein se hain, jo kabhi ganga pathar ko cover karte the."" (it is one of those remaining powerful jungles, which once covered the Ganga plains.)
* **C: Yeh duniya ki sabse badi Mangrove patti hai (It is the world's largest Mangrove forest):** The passage states ""Sunderban 3,850 varg kilometres mein phaila hai..."" and also says it's a mangrove forest, implying it's large. The fact that it's described as the world's largest is a commonly known fact, though not explicitly stated in *this* passage.
* **D: Yahan bengal tigers se zyada chital hain (There are more chital than Bengal tigers here):** The passage says ""ek aaklan ke anusaar is ilaake mein ab lagbhag 400 royal bengal tigers aur lagbhag 30,000 chital hain."" (According to an estimate, there are now about 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 chital in this area.) Therefore, there are *more* chital than Bengal tigers.



"
Jungle ka kaunsa hissa bhartiya ilaake mein hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Sundarbans National Park**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Haalaanki, jungle ka wah hissa jo bharat mein hai usko sunderban national park kahaa jaataa hai."" (However, the part of the jungle that is in India is called Sundarbans National Park.)
"
"Passage ke anusaar, kise kum se kum English bhasha ki seemit jaankari hogi?","सही जवाब है **B: कम उम्र के लोग**।

पैराग्राफ में स्पष्ट रूप से कहा गया है, ""कई पूरे राष्ट्र अंग्रेजी में पूरी तरह से धाराप्रवाह हैं, और उनसे भी अधिक में आप सीमित ज्ञान की आशा रख सकते हैं - विशेष रूप से युवा लोगों में।"" 

इसलिए, कम उम्र के लोगों में अंग्रेजी की सीमित जानकारी होने की संभावना अधिक है।"
"Passage ke anusaar, kya uchchaaran karna mushkil hota hai?","The correct answer is **B: Pate (Words)**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Likhit shabdon ko aksar bole gaye shabdon ke tulna mein samajhna aasaan hota hai. yah vishesh roop se paton ke liye such hai, jinhen aksar thik se uchchaaran karna mushkil hota hai."" 

This translates to: ""Written words are often easier to understand compared to spoken words. This is especially true for **words** (paton) which are often difficult to pronounce correctly.""

Therefore, the passage directly connects pronunciation difficulties with words/letters (""paton"").
"
"Passage ke anusaar, Inter-district bus station se bus pakadne ki soch rahe yatri ke liye kya sahi rahega?","The correct answer is **B: Yatri Bumthang jaa raha hai aur use 7 baje tak nikalna hai.**

Here's why:

* **The passage states:** ""Choonki antar zila basein aksar bhari hoti hain, isliye kuch din pehle ticket kharidna uchit hota hai."" This suggests the traveler should book in advance.
* **The passage states:** ""Zyaadaatar poorv aur jakar/bumtang ki ore jaane vaali basein subah 06:30 aur 07:30 ke bich jaati hain."" This indicates buses to Bumthang depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.

Therefore, if a traveler wants to go to Bumthang and catch a bus, they should aim to be at the station before 7:30 AM and ideally book their ticket in advance. Option B aligns perfectly with this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yatri Jakar jaa raha hai aur ticket pehle hi khareed chuka hai:** The passage doesn't specify the traveler is going to Jakar, nor does it state they've already bought a ticket.
* **C: Yatri Paro jaa raha hai aur use 11 baje ke baad nikalna hai:** Buses to Paro are mentioned as shared taxis (Nu 150 and Nu 200), not buses from the Inter-district bus station, and the passage doesn't indicate the traveler intends to take a taxi or depart after 11 AM.
* **D: Yatri pashchim ki ore jaa raha hai aur station par 6:20 se pehle aa jaata hai:** The passage doesn't mention travelers going west, and there's no specific time mentioned for a westward journey.
"
Inter-district bus station se pashchim jaane waale yatri ke liye achchhi salah kya hogi?,"The correct answer is **B: Kuch din pehle ticket kharidna uchit hota hai**.

Here's why:

* **The text states:** ""Choonki antar zila basein aksar bhari hoti hain, isliye kuch din pehle ticket kharidna uchit hota hai."" (Since inter-district buses are often crowded, it is advisable to buy tickets a few days in advance.)
* **The question asks about a traveler going west from the inter-district bus station.** The text doesn't explicitly say *when* buses go west, but it does state that buses to the east and Jakar/Bumthang leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.  It implies that other routes, including west, likely have similar schedules and can get crowded.
* **Option A is incorrect** because the text says buses run *all day*, just that certain routes have specific morning departures.
* **Option C is incorrect** because while technically true (buses run all day), it doesn't provide helpful advice *specifically* for someone going west.
* **Option D is true but less helpful.** Shared taxis are good for nearby locations, but the question asks about traveling *from the bus station*, suggesting a longer journey.

Therefore, the best advice is to buy tickets in advance due to the buses often being crowded, regardless of the direction of travel.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa Timbuktu ka sateek varnan nhi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Yha hawai jahaz se nhi jaya ja sakta** (It cannot be reached by airplane).

Here's why:

* The text explicitly states: ""ismein ek hawai adda hai"" (it has an airport). This directly contradicts option C.
* The text says Timbuktu is a ""sadhanhin shahar"" (relatively poor city), so option B is likely true.
* The text mentions ""paryatak aakarshan se banaati hai"" (its reputation is built on tourism), so option D is true.
* The text also states ""yah shahar desh ke baaki shaharon se alag hai kyonki yah kisi african shahar ke bajaay arab shahar lagta hai"" (this city is different from the rest of the country because it looks like an Arab city instead of an African city), so option A is true.

Therefore, only option C is incorrect according to the provided text.
"
Inme se kaun si baat Timbuktu ke liye shi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Yah kisi african shahar ke bajaay arab shahar lagta hai**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""yah shahar desh ke baaki shaharon se alag hai kyonki yah kisi african shahar ke bajaay arab shahar lagta hai."" (This city is different from the rest of the country because it looks like an Arab city instead of an African city.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yha hawai jahaz se jaya ja sakta hai (You can travel there by airplane):** The passage mentions ""ismein ek hawai adda hai"" (there is an airport), so this is true.
* **B: Yha ghareebon ke bjay videshi log jyada hai (There are more foreigners than poor people):** The passage doesn't provide information about the demographics of Timbuktu.
* **D: Ab yha yatri nhi aate (Now tourists don't come):** The passage says ""iski pratishththaa iske paryatak aakarshan se banaati hai"" (its prestige is built on its tourist attraction), so this is false.

Therefore, only option C is directly supported by the text."
Grishmakaleen olympic mool roop se kab nirdhaarit kiye gaye the? ,"The correct answer is **B: March 2020**.

The passage states: ""Cancel karne ke neetiyon mein fark ho sakta hai lekin march ke aakhir mein corona virus ke aadhaar par cancel karne ke zyaadaatar neetiyaan july 2020 tak nahin badhaai jaati hain, yaani jab olympic schedule kiya gaya tha."" This indicates the Olympic schedule was finalized in March 2020.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kuppi kis bindu par bavandar ban jaati hai?","The correct answer is **D: Jameen ko chhoote hi**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Shuruat mein way toofan ke baadlon se niche utarne waali kuppi ke tarah hote hain, aur jameen ko chhoote hi """"bavandar"""" ban jaate hain."" This translates to ""Initially, they are like a bottle coming down from storm clouds, and they become 'dust devils' as soon as they touch the ground.""
"
Inme se kaun sa bavandar ka sateek lakshan hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Bavandar aksar apne saath bhari vastuon ko uthaakar le jaataa hai.**

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""yah bavandar apne saath bhari vastuon ko uthaakar le jaataa hai."" (These whirlwinds carry heavy objects with them.)

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Inme hawayon ki gati aksar 100-200 meal / ghanta hoti hai:**  While the passage mentions wind speeds of 100-200 mph, it's *one characteristic* among several, not the *most* specific.
* **C: Jameen chhote hi yeh baadlon se niche utarne waali kuppi ke tarah ho jate hain:** This describes the *appearance* of a tornado initially, but not a defining characteristic of what makes it a tornado.
* **D: Bavandar hawa ka ek ghumta huwa astambh hota hai jisme hawa bahar ki oor chalti hai:** This describes a whirlwind in general, but doesn't specifically highlight the crucial feature of lifting heavy objects.

Therefore, option B best encapsulates a precise and unique characteristic of a tornado as described in the provided passage.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, kisi yatri ko us shahar ki raajaneetik sthiti ke baare mein parmarsh kahaan se lena chaahiye jha wah ja rha hai?","The correct answer is **D: Apni sarkar se (Your government)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Apni sarkar ke alawa aap anya deshon ke sarkaron ke salah le sakte hain. haalaanki, unki salah unke nagrikon ko dhyan mein rakhkar dee jaati hai."" (Besides your government, you can seek advice from other governments. However, their advice is given keeping their citizens in mind.)

While other options have some connection, they are not as directly supported by the passage.  Option A is partially correct (you *can* get advice from the government of the destination country), but the passage prioritizes your *own* government's advice. Options B and C are incorrect because the passage indicates that the advisory is often superficial and not a comprehensive source of information.
"
"Yatra parmarsh ki sthiti mein, ek videshi nagrik ko kya anubhav hone ki sambhaavana nhi hai?","The correct answer is **D: desh ki raajneetik sthiti ke baare mein vistrit jankari (Detailed information about the country's political situation)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Advisory kisi bhi desh mein raajneetik isthiti ka mahaz chhota-sa vivaran hai."" which translates to ""Advisory is only a brief overview of the political situation in any country."" This means a detailed understanding is *not* something a travel advisory will provide.

Options A, B, and C are all directly mentioned or strongly implied in the passage as potential impacts of travel advisories. Therefore, they are not the correct answer.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kis prakaar ki yatra ke liye travel agent se booking sahayta ki jarurat sbse kam hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: KisI aise shahar mein karya sammelan ke liye yatra, jahaan yatri pahle ja chuka hai (A trip to a city where the traveler has already been for a conference).**

Here's why:

The passage states that travel agents are *best* for trips that are ""अलग होता है"" (different) from previous experiences related to nature, culture, language, or less common destinations.  A conference trip to a familiar city doesn't fit this description. It's likely a routine trip that the traveler has already handled independently.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **B: Kisi khas budgett me do saptaah lambi yatra (A two-week trip within a specific budget):** While agents can help with budgeting, the passage highlights their specialization in different *types* of trips, which could include budget-friendly options.
* **C: Aese desh ki yatra jha ki bhasha alag ho (A trip to a country where the language is different):** This is precisely the type of trip the passage suggests agents are helpful for – experiences different from the norm.
* **D: Yatri ki pahli videsh yatra (The traveler's first trip abroad):** This is another type of trip where an agent's guidance can be beneficial, especially for navigating unfamiliar processes.



Therefore, a routine conference trip to a known city is the least likely to require a travel agent's assistance based on the passage's emphasis on unique and novel travel experiences."
"Passage ke hisab se, kis sthiti mein ek yatri ko travel agent ki madad se sabse zyada laabh hoga?","The correct answer is **B: Jab yatri pahli baar kisis vishesh jagah ja rha ho (When the traveler is going to a special place for the first time).**

Here's why:

The passage states: ""ek travel agent aam taur par ek aisi yatra ke liye ek achcha vikalp hota hai jo prakriti, sanskriti, bhasha yaa kam aaye waale deshon ke yatra ke pichle anubhav se alag hota hai.""  This translates to: ""a travel agent is generally a good option for a trip that is different from previous experiences of travel to nature, culture, languages or less-visited countries.""

This implies that a travel agent is most beneficial when the traveler is venturing to a *new* or *different* place, where prior experience is lacking. Option B directly addresses this by mentioning ""pahli baar kisis vishesh jagah ja rha ho"" - going to a special place for the first time.  The passage further suggests using an agent who specializes in the type of trip you're taking, which is especially helpful when exploring something new.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Jab yatri apane grihnagar jane ke liye roundtrip flight book kar raha ho (When the traveler is booking a roundtrip flight to their hometown):**  This is a very common and routine trip, not something a specialized travel agent would necessarily provide a significant advantage in.
* **C: Jab yatri us jagah ki bhasha janta ho jha wah ja rha hai (When the traveler knows the language of the place they are going):** Knowing the language isn't the main reason to use a travel agent.
* **D: Jab yatri gantavya ki sanskriti se parichit ho (When the traveler is familiar with the culture of the destination):**  Familiarity with the culture doesn't necessitate using a travel agent."
"Passage ke hisab se, nyi jagah ki yatra karte samay ek yatri nirasha se kaise bach sakta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Kinhi chizonse ye ummid naa karein ki way vaisi hi hongi jaisii aapke ghar par thi (Don't expect things to be the same as they are at your home).**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Jab aap yatra karte hain, toh kinhi chizonse ye ummid naa karein ki way vaisi hi hongi jaisii aapke ghar par thi."" (When you travel, don't expect things to be the same as they are at your home.)
* This is the core message for avoiding disappointment. If you have realistic expectations that differ from the new location, you're less likely to be disappointed.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **B: Alag bhojan try karna (Try different food):** While trying local food is a good experience, it's not directly related to avoiding disappointment.
* **C: Jha se aap hai wha ke kanoon manna (Follow the laws of where you are):** Following local laws is important for safety and respect, but doesn't address the issue of unrealistic expectations.
* **D: Jha aap ja rhe hai wha ke bare me pahle se jankari jutana (Gather information about where you are going beforehand):**  Gathering information is helpful, but the passage focuses on managing expectations *despite* having information. You can research, but still be surprised if you expect things to be identical.



Therefore, option A is the most accurate and directly supported by the passage."
"Passage me di gayi jankari ke mutabik, kis tarah ke vyakti ko videshi yatra karte samay nirasha ho sakti hai?","सही उत्तर है **C: जो संकुचित सोच का हो**।

यहाँ कारण दिया गया है:

*   पाठ में कहा गया है कि यात्रा करते समय हमें यह उम्मीद नहीं करनी चाहिए कि चीजें हमारे घर जैसी ही होंगी। इसका मतलब है कि हमें नई संस्कृतियों और रीति-रिवाजों के लिए तैयार रहना होगा।
*   **संकुचित सोच** वाले व्यक्ति को नई चीजों को स्वीकार करने में कठिनाई होगी और वह अपनी अपेक्षाओं से निराश हो सकता है जब चीजें अलग हों।
*   अन्य विकल्प उतने सटीक नहीं हैं:
    *   **A: जिसे शानदार भोजन पसंद हो:** भोजन की पसंद व्यक्तिगत हो सकती है, लेकिन यह मुख्य रूप से निराशा का कारण नहीं है।
    *   **B: जिसे अलग चीजें पसंद हों:** यात्रा नए अनुभवों के बारे में है, इसलिए अलग चीजें पसंद करने वाले व्यक्ति को निराशा नहीं होनी चाहिए।
    *   **D: जो हमेशा नई चीजें सीखने के लिए तैयार रहे:** यह एक सकारात्मक दृष्टिकोण है जो निराशा से बचने में मदद करता है।

इसलिए, संकुचित सोच वाले व्यक्ति को नई परिस्थितियों के अनुकूल होने में कठिनाई होगी और वह निराश हो सकता है।"
Kisi vikasshil desh mein pehli baar jaane vaale yatriyon ke liye nimnalikhit mein se kaun si salaah jaruri nhi hai?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Kuch dino tak bhojn par fijoolkharchi karne se bachen.**

यहाँ कारण बताया गया है कि यह सलाह अनावश्यक क्यों है:

*   **अन्य विकल्प महत्वपूर्ण हैं:**
    *   **A:** स्थानीय जीवन के बारे में जानकारी न होने पर जमीन या पेड़ पर न सोना सुरक्षा के लिए बहुत महत्वपूर्ण सलाह है।
    *   **C:** शिविर में जाने वाले लोगों के लिए सांप और बिच्छू से बचने के लिए शिविर की चटाई या झूला ले जाना ज़रूरी है।
    *   **D:** शुरुआती दिनों में पश्चिमी शैली के होटल, भोजन और सेवाओं पर ध्यान देना आरामदायक और सुरक्षित रहने के लिए एक उचित सलाह है।
*   **B अनावश्यक क्यों है:** किसी भी देश में, कम खर्च में भोजन करना व्यावहारिक है, विशेषकर विकासशील देशों में। फिजूलखर्ची से बचना ज़रूरी नहीं है और यह मूल सलाह नहीं है जो विकासशील देशों में यात्रा करने वाले शुरुआती लोगों को दी जानी चाहिए।

इसलिए, विकल्प B सबसे कम महत्वपूर्ण सलाह है।"
"Kisi vikasshil desh mein dhalte samay, nimnalikhit me se kin chizon par fijoolkharchi karne se mna nhi kiya gya hai?","सही उत्तर है: **B: Gunvattapurna sevaaon**

यहाँ बताया गया है कि क्यों:

* प्रश्न में स्पष्ट रूप से सलाह दी गई है कि विकासशील देशों में यात्रा करते समय अपने शुरुआती दिनों में पश्चिमी शैली और गुणवत्तापूर्ण होटल, भोजन और सेवाओं पर ध्यान केंद्रित करें।
* विकल्प B, गुणवत्तापूर्ण सेवाओं को दर्शाता है, जो उपरोक्त सलाह के अनुरूप है।
* विकल्प A, पश्चिमी शैली के भोजन को भी सलाह में शामिल किया गया है।
* विकल्प C और D, गड्ढे या पेड़ पर सोना और गुणवत्तापूर्ण होटल दोनों ही विकासशील देशों में असुरक्षित और अनावश्यक माने जाते हैं।

इसलिए, गुणवत्तापूर्ण सेवाओं पर खर्च करने में कोई बुराई नहीं है, खासकर जब आप किसी नए और विकासशील क्षेत्र में यात्रा कर रहे हों।"
Agar kisi vyakti ko apne bima ki copy internet ke binaa chahiye ho to inme se kaun sa vikalp sabse shi hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Laptop ki memory me ek copy store karein**.

Here's why:

The prompt specifically states: ""Yadi laptop yaa tablet ke saath yatra kar rahe hain toh memory yaa disc (internet ke binaa access ke jaa sakne waali) mein ek copy store karein.""  This directly addresses the need for a copy without internet access.

Let's look at why the other options aren't as good:

* **A: Yatra ke sathiyon ko copy dena:** While helpful, this doesn't address the person's *need* to have a copy for themselves.
* **B: Khud ko ek copy e-mail karein:** This requires internet access to send the email and retrieve the attachment.
* **D: Ek copy “cloud” me save karein:** This also requires internet access to save the file to the cloud.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, bima ki prati me kya dikhane ki zaroorat nahi hai?","The correct answer is **C: Pushti karne ke liye antarrashtriya phone number**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states you need to have the insurer's email address and international phone number *to file a claim*. It doesn't mention needing to have the international phone number for *verification*. The passage focuses on having contact information for claiming purposes. Options A, B, and D are all mentioned as necessary to have for claiming and contacting the insurer.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, kon sa film praarup sabse aam hai?","The passage states: ""Saanak 35 MM film (36 gunaa 24 MM negative) sabse aam hai.""  This translates to ""Standard 35 MM film (36 x 24 MM negative) is the most common.""

Therefore, the correct answer is **C: 35 MM negative**.
"
DSLR ke tulna mein lagbhag vaisa resolution kon sa film format deta hai?,"The correct answer is **A: 35 mm film**.

The passage states: ""Agar aap chalaate hain aur yah vartamaan DSLR ke tulna mein lagbhag vaisa resolution deta hai, toh yah aam taur par kaafee aasaani se badla jaa sakta hai.""  This directly translates to ""If you run it and it gives approximately the same resolution as a modern DSLR, then it can easily be replaced.""  The passage then goes on to say 35mm film is commonly used and provides a resolution comparable to a DSLR.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Yatra lekhan ke vyavasaay ko shuru karne ke liye inme se kausa sa charan sabse antim hoga?","The correct answer is **C: Apni website banaana**.

Here's why:

The passage states a sequence of steps:

1.  **Padhkar apne kaushal mein sudhaar laaen:** (Learn by reading a well-established travel blog website to improve your skills.)
2.  **Website par formatting aur editing seekhne ke baad:** (After learning formatting and editing on the website...)
3.  **Aap apni website bana sakte hain:** (You can create your own website.)

Therefore, building your own website is the final step mentioned in the passage.
"
"Yatra lekhan ke vyavasaay ko shuru karne ke liye, sabse pahle kya karna chahiye?","The correct answer is **A: Blogging**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Yatra lekhan ke vyavasaay ko shuru karne ka sabse aasaan tarika yah hai ki ek asthaapit yatra blog website ko acchi tarah se padhkar apne kaushal mein sudhaar laaen.""  This translates to: ""The easiest way to start a travel writing business is to thoroughly read an established travel blog website and improve your skills.""

Before you can create your own website, you need to learn the skills necessary – formatting and editing – which you're supposed to learn *by reading* existing blogs.  Therefore, blogging (reading and learning from existing blogs) is the first step.
"
Kis prakaar kee jalvaayu mein aanton ke samasyaaen aam taur par pai jati hain?,"The correct answer is **C: Germ jalvaayu mein**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Germ jalvaayu mein bacteria adhik tezi se badhte hain aur shareer ke baahar lambe samay tak jeevit rehte hain... garm mausam mein aanton ke samasyaaen kaafee aam hain lekin vaastav mein khatarnaak nahin.""

This means that intestinal problems are common in germ climates. While the passage mentions cold weather can cause breathing problems, it links intestinal problems specifically to germ climates.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, nirantar sampark mein aane ke karan, kiske prati pratiraksha viksit hone ki sambhavana bahut adhik hai?","The correct answer is **B: Asthaaniya keetanuon**.

The passage states: ""Ghar par, asthaaniya keetanuon ke nirantar sampark mein aane ke karan, bahut adhik sambhavana hai ki aap mein unke liye pratiraksha pehle hi viksit ho chuki ho.""  This translates to: ""At home, due to constant contact with local germs, there is a high chance that you have already developed immunity to them.""



The other options are incorrect:

* **A: Aanton ke samasyaaen (Intestinal problems):** The passage mentions intestinal problems as common in hot weather, but doesn't link them to immunity development.
* **C: Sans lene ke samasyaaen (Breathing problems):**  The passage mentions breathing problems in cold weather but doesn't link them to immunity development.
* **D: Daily bailley:** Daily bailley is mentioned as someone who suffered consequences, not someone whose immunity developed.



"
Schengen zone me yatra karne ka nimnalikhit mein se kaun sa laabh hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Alag-alag visa ka avaden nahin denaa padta hai** and **C: Passport niyantran chaukiyon se guzre binaa seema paar kr sakte hai**.

Here's why:

* **A: Alag-alag visa ka avaden nahin denaa padta hai:** The text explicitly states that with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for separate visas for each Schengen member country.
* **C: Passport niyantran chaukiyon se guzre binaa seema paar kr sakte hai:** The text mentions that as long as you are within the Schengen area, you can cross borders without going through passport control.

While **B: Paise ki bachat hoti hai** is a consequence of not needing separate visas (saving on application fees, etc.), it's not as direct a benefit stated as the other two. **D: Passport ki zaroorat nhi padti** is incorrect; a passport is still required for entry into the Schengen zone, although you may not need to present it at every border crossing.

Therefore, the most accurate and direct benefits listed in the text are A and C. Since the question asks to choose *one* correct answer, and both A and C are major benefits, it's a bit ambiguous. However, if forced to choose only one, **A** is slightly more precise as it's a direct result of the Schengen visa system. But including C as a benefit is also accurate.
"
Tutankhamun ke makbare me ab kya nhi bacha?,"The correct answer is **D: Meenaaren**.

The text explicitly states: ""Maqabare ke shandar meenaaren abusmen nahin hain, lekin inhen hataakar carro ke esyptian museum mein rakh diya gaya hai."" (The magnificent obelisks in the tomb are no longer there, but they have been removed and kept in the Egyptian Museum in Cairo.)
"
"Passage ke hisab se, paise bachane wale yatriyon ke liye Vancouver ki kaun si jagah sabse kam khas hogi? ","The answer is **C: Bowen dweep**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that Bowen Island is ""bahut achcha hai... jo kayaking, lambi paidal yatra, dukanen, restaurant aur bahut kuch pradaan karta hai."" This suggests a variety of activities that *could* be expensive.
*  **Whitsler** is mentioned as famous due to the Olympics and known for skiing/mountain biking, implying tourist infrastructure and potential higher costs.
* **Sky Corridor** is highlighted as essential for outdoor activity enthusiasts, suggesting a destination geared towards recreation which can be costly.
* **Granville Island** is mentioned as accessible by water taxi from Vancouver, implying it's a popular tourist destination. While not explicitly stated as expensive, the context implies it caters to tourists and could be pricier than Bowen Island.

However, the passage *doesn't* mention Bowen Island being particularly upscale or expensive. The details focus on its natural beauty and recreational opportunities, which *could* be enjoyed on a budget. The other options have more explicit connections to things that are generally more costly (skiing, tourism). Therefore, Bowen Island seems like the place where budget travelers would likely find the most affordable options.

The question asks which place would be *least* appealing to budget travelers. Given the other options are more commonly associated with tourism and potentially higher costs, Bowen Island is the most likely candidate.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, yatriyon ko kis jagah Vancouver ka sabse pramanik anubhav milta hai?","The correct answer is **A: Bowen dweep**.

The passage explicitly states: ""yah pramanik samudaay Vancouver ke thik baahar howay sound mein isthit hai..."" which translates to ""this authentic community is located just outside Vancouver on the Howe Sound..."" This directly indicates that Bowen Island offers the most authentic experience according to the passage.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, agar yatriyon ko jalprapaat ka drishya aspasht dekhne ke liye kab jana chahiye?","The correct answer is **C: Jab paani ki matra adhik ho**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Barsaat ke mausam (november se march) mein paani ki matra zyada hogi aur jharne zyada manmohak dikhai denge. Yadi aap pul paar karenge yaa jharne ke paas ke ghumaavdaar pagadandiyon par chalenge, toh aap avashya hi bhig jayenge. Doosri ore, yah thik hai kyonki paani ki matra itni adhik hai ki aapke vaastavik jalprapaat ka drishya aspasht ho jayega - sabhi paani se!""

This clearly indicates that to see the waterfall's view blurred by the water, one should visit during the rainy season when the water volume is high.  While November to March *is* the rainy season, the *reason* for the obscured view is the high water volume.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, Victoria jalprapaat ko november aur march ke beech me dekhne ke kya laabh hai?","The correct answer is **C: Jharne zyada manmohak dikhai denge**.

The passage explicitly states: ""Barsaat ke mausam (november se march) mein paani ki matra zyada hogi aur jharne zyada manmohak dikhai denge."" (During the rainy season (November to March) the water quantity will be higher and the falls will look more captivating.)

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Jalprapaat ka drishya aspasht ho jayega** - The passage says the *opposite* is true: the falls will be *more* captivating, not obscure.
*   **B: Yatriyon ki sankhya kam hoti hai** - The passage doesn't mention anything about tourist numbers.
*   **D: Barsaat ke mausam se bach jayege** - The passage mentions that you *will* get wet if you go near the falls or walk on the trails, so you won't avoid the rainy season.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, drone ka istemal karke film bnate samay kya karne ki salah nhi di jati?","Correct Answer: **D: Sirf bhid ke oopar se drone se film bnana jha se log use nhi dekhege**

Explanation:

The passage explicitly states: ""Airport ke nazdeek yaa bhid ke oopar ek udtaa hua drone aapke shetra mein bhale hi gair-kanuni naa raha ho, lekin hamesha yah ek burra vichaar hai.""  This means using a drone *over crowds* is always a bad idea, regardless of legality.  Option D is the closest to capturing this sentiment, although it's not a perfect match. The passage warns against filming over crowds, not just trying to avoid being seen.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Pehle hi jaanch lain ke apko kya film banaane ke anumati hai:** The passage *does* advise checking for film-making permissions.
*   **B: Atirikt license ke zaroorat hai:** The passage mentions the need for permits or additional licenses, so it *does* address this.
*   **C: Research karne ki anumati:** The passage doesn't specifically mention research, but it does focus on obtaining the necessary permissions.

Therefore, option D is the best fit as it reflects the passage's warning about filming over crowds."
"Passage ke hisab se, drone ka istemal karke film bnane ki sabse achi jagah kon si hain?","The correct answer is **D: Aese shetra jha apko film bnane ka permit pehle ki mil gya hai.**

Here's why:

The passage emphasizes the importance of obtaining permission *before* using a drone for filming. It specifically mentions checking for necessary permits and licenses. Option D directly aligns with this principle.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

*   **A: Bhid ke oopar ek udtaa hua drone jisse jyada logo ko fark nhi padta:** While avoiding attention is good, this isn't the main point. The passage focuses on legality and permissions.
*   **B: Aesi jagah jha samanya photography ki anumati nhi hai:**  The passage says you *shouldn't* film if you don't have permission to take photos.  It doesn't suggest finding locations where photo permission isn't needed.
*   **C: Bhid wale shetra jha drone kam dikhega:** This focuses on concealment, not legality.



"
"Passage ke hisab se, Visa prakriya ke lie panjikaran aavashyakta ke sambandh mein kaun sa kathan satya nahin hai?","The correct answer is **A: Agar aap paryatakon ke thaharne ki jagah mein hain toh apko register karne ki zarurat nahi hogi** (If you are staying at a tourist accommodation, you do not need to register).

Here's why: The passage states: ""haanaki, yah baat kanoon ko zyaada ajib banaati hai, isliye pehle hi jaankari joota lain. **is tarah ke kanoon waale kayee deshon mein, asthaaniya hotel panjikaran sambhal lenge (poochana sunishchit karein). dusre mamalon mein, sirf aise logon ko register karne ke zarurat hai jo paryatakon ke thaharne ke jagahon se alag kahin ruke hain.**"" (However, this makes the law quite strange, so get information beforehand. In many countries with such laws, local hotels will handle registration (be sure to ask). In other cases, only those who stay somewhere other than tourist accommodations need to register.)

This clearly indicates that *if* you are staying at a tourist accommodation, you *do* need to register (or the hotel will register you). Therefore, option A is false according to the passage.

Let's look at why the other options are true according to the passage:

* **B: Sabhi deshon ko asthaaniya adhikariyon ke saath panjikaran ki aavashyakta hai** (All countries require registration with local authorities) - The passage doesn't explicitly say *all* countries, but it does mention that registration *with local authorities* is a common requirement.
* **C: Aapravaasan karyalayon mein jaane ki aavashyakta pad sakti hai** (You may need to go to immigration offices) - The passage says "" Aapravaasan karyalayon mein jaane ki aavashyakta pad sakti hai"" (You may need to go to immigration offices), which is directly stated.
* **D: kuch sthaano mein, asthaaniya hotel panjikaran sambhal lenge** (In some places, local hotels will handle registration) - This is directly stated in the passage.



"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaunsa vah asthaan nahin hai jahaan ek paryatak apna panjikaran karaane ke lie ja sakata hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ek asthaaniya post office (An asthaaniya post office)**.

The passage explicitly states that registration can be done at:

* **Asthaaniya police station (Ek asthaaniya police station)**
* **Aapravaasan karyalayon mein (Visa Immigration offices)**
* **Local hotels (Local hotels)**

It also mentions that registration is required if staying *outside* tourist accommodations. A post office is not mentioned as a place for registration. Therefore, it is the correct answer to the question.
"
Yatra karte samay swayamseva karne se kise laabh nhi hoga?,"सही उत्तर है **B: Achi khasi salary ki talash karne vale ko**

**व्याख्या:**

प्रसंग में स्वयंसेवा के लाभों के बारे में बताया गया है। इनमें शामिल हैं:

*   एक अलग संस्कृति को जानना
*   नए लोगों से मिलना
*   अपने बारे में जानना
*   परिप्रेक्ष्य की भावना को समझना
*   नए कौशल सीखना
*   कम लागत में लंबे समय तक यात्रा करना

विकल्प B, ""अच्छी खासी सैलरी की तलाश करने वाले"" व्यक्ति, इन लाभों से सीधे तौर पर संबंधित नहीं हैं। स्वयंसेवा अक्सर बिना वेतन के या बहुत कम वेतन के होती है। इसलिए, जो लोग अच्छी सैलरी चाहते हैं, उन्हें स्वयंसेवा करने से शायद कोई लाभ न हो।

अन्य विकल्प (A, C, और D) स्वयंसेवा के लाभों से सीधे संबंधित हैं।"
"Passage ke hisaab se, ek budget yatri ke lie videsh mein swayamseva karna kis prakaar laabhadayak hai?","The correct answer is **C: kabhi kabhi kamra aur khana diya jata hai (Sometimes accommodation and food are provided)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Choonki kayee swayamsevi sevaayen kamra aur khana detee hain aur iske evaz mein chhota sa bhugtan letee hai...""  This means that some volunteer services *do* offer accommodation and food as part of the exchange for a small payment.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Unhe lagabhag hamesha salary di jaati hai (They are almost always given a salary):** The passage mentions a ""chhota sa bhugtan"" (small payment), not a salary.
* **B: Isse rozgaar ka avsar milta hai (It provides an opportunity for employment):** While some opportunities *may* arise, the passage doesn't primarily focus on employment. The main point is the self-service experience itself.
* **D: Yah pariprekshya ki bhavna ko samajhne mein apki madad karta hai (It helps you understand the feeling of perspective):**  While understanding perspective is *a* benefit of volunteering abroad, the passage is specifically asking about the benefits for a budget traveler. Accommodation/food is more directly relevant to that.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, Volt Disney World ki yatra ke liye kya aasamanya mana ja sakta hai?","The correct answer is **C: Yatra ka pura samay Disney property par bitana (Spending the entire trip on Disney property)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that a typical Disney World trip involves staying on-site (at a Disney hotel) and spending nearly a week *within* the Disney area, *without leaving*. The passage highlights this as a key part of the experience. The passage later contrasts this with the illegal practice of selling partial park-hopper tickets, implying that the full immersion within the Disney property is important and not something everyone does.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Park ki khoj mein ek saptah bitana (Spending a week exploring the parks):**  The passage explicitly mentions this *as* a typical part of a special trip, not an असामान्य (unusual) aspect.
* **B: Ek off-site hotel mein rehna (Staying at an off-site hotel):** The passage states that a typical trip *includes* a bus ride from the airport to a Disney hotel, implying staying on-site is typical.
* **D: Hawai adde se hotel tak bus lena (Taking a bus from the airport to the hotel):**  The passage mentions this as a step in the typical travel process. It's not unusual.



"
Volt Disney World ke baare main nimnalikhit mein se konsa kathan sayta nahi hai?,"The correct answer is **A: Park-hopper ke tickets anya yatriyon ko diye ja sakte hain** (Park-hopper tickets can be given to other travelers).

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: **""ticket kisi aur ko nahin diya jaa sakta hai.""** (tickets cannot be given to anyone else). This directly contradicts option A.

Let's look at why the other options *are* supported by the passage:

* **B: Yaha on-site avaas uplabdh hai** (On-site accommodation is available): The passage mentions staying in a Disney hotel.
* **C: Yatriyon ko hawai adde se property tak le jaane ke liye bus uplabdh hai** (Bus is available to take travelers from the airport to the property): The passage mentions a bus being used to transport guests from the airport to the hotel.
* **D: Nilami ki website par bahu-divasiya ticket mil jaatein hai** (Multi-day tickets can be found on auction websites): The passage explicitly states that multi-day, park-hopper tickets are sold on platforms like eBay and Craigslist.



"
"Passage ke hisaab se, nimnalikhit mein se kis mudde ko peshevar prashikshan kaksha ya prakaashanon mein shaamil nahin kie jaane ki sabse adhik sambhavana hai?","The correct answer is **A: Jungle mein jeevit rahne ke tarike**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that the professional training course focuses on preparing for travel in conflict zones.  The course covers roles to play, first aid, and *sometimes* weapons training.
* The passage also mentions that resources on surviving in jungles are readily available in books and magazines.  
* While jungle survival *might* be relevant in a conflict zone scenario, it's not the primary focus of *professional* training for travel in a conflict zone. The training is geared towards the immediate threats and challenges of a war zone, not long-term survival in a jungle environment.
* The other options (first aid, conflict zone preparedness, and role-playing) are directly mentioned as components of the course.



Therefore, jungle survival skills are the least likely to be included in a professional training course specifically for travel in conflict zones, based on the information provided."
"Passage ke hisaab se, peshevar prashikshan kaksha mein nimnalikhit mein se kis vishay ko shaamil kie jaane ki sabse adhik sambhavana hai?","The correct answer is **A: Praathamik upchaar (First Aid)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that a typical course includes ""bahut saaraa praathamik upchaar"" (a lot of first aid).
* While the passage mentions ""hathiyaron ka prashikshan"" (weapon training), it's listed as ""kabhi-kabhi"" (sometimes), making first aid a more consistent and likely inclusion.
* The passage mentions ""shatrutapurna paryaavaran pathyakram"" (hostile environment program) and ""jungle mein jeevit rahne vaali pustaken aur patrikaen"" (books and magazines for living in the jungle), but these are not necessarily the core topics covered in a professional training course.  The course focuses on *dealing with* a hostile environment, and first aid is a critical component of that.
* While ""yuddh shetra"" (war zone) is mentioned, the training is about *traveling* in a war zone, implying the course is about skills needed *during* that travel, and first aid is a crucial skill for that.

Therefore, based on the passage's emphasis, first aid is the most likely subject to be included in a professional training class.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, sambhaavit taur par dooshit paani se bachne ke lie sabse acha vikalp kya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Kuch chuninda khataron ke lie paani ki shuddhta ka aakalan karna (Assessing the purity of water for specific contaminants)**.

Here's why:

* The passage states that the necessary boiling time *varies* depending on the contaminants present. 
* It also mentions that filters have different effectiveness.
* Therefore, the best approach isn't a one-size-fits-all solution. You need to understand *what* contaminants are present in the water to choose the most effective method.  Assessing the water's purity for specific contaminants is the most informed and adaptable approach.

Let's look at why the other options are less accurate:

* **A: Paani ko kayee minute tak ubalna (Boiling water for several minutes):**  This is *one* method, but not necessarily the *best* for all contaminants.
* **B: Paani ki bottle khareedna (Buying bottled water):** This is a solution, but not a preventative measure if you want to purify water you already have.  And it doesn't address the underlying issue of knowing what's in the water.
* **C: Paani ko ek minute ke liye ubalna (Boiling water for one minute):** This is only sufficient for *some* contaminants.

Therefore, option D is the most comprehensive and logically sound answer based on the information in the passage.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, kushal tairakon ke lie bhi kaunsa kaam lagbhag asambhav ho sakata hai?","The correct answer is **C: Dhara ke viruddh tairana**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states: ""Zyaadaatar mautein paani ke dhara ke viruddh tairane se hone vaali thakan ke vajah se hoti hain, ho sakta hai ki yah namumkin bhi ho.""  This directly translates to ""Most deaths occur due to exhaustion from swimming against the current; it may even be impossible.""

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Chattan ke karib tairana (Swimming near rocks):** The passage mentions waves hitting rocks, but doesn't say it's impossible for skilled swimmers to do so.
* **B: Gahare paani mein tairana (Swimming in deep water):** The passage mentions deeper sections having concentrated return flow and potentially strong currents, but it doesn't say this is impossible for skilled swimmers.
* **D: Laharon ke aaspas tairana (Swimming around waves):**  The passage discusses waves, but doesn't indicate that skilled swimmers would be unable to swim around them.



"
Agar aap dhara mein phans jayein to aapko kya karna chahiye?,"The correct answer is **C: Viprit disha mein tairein (Swim in the opposite direction)**.

The text explicitly states: ""Jaise hi aap dhara se nikal aate hain, peechhe ke or tairne mein koi khaas mushkil nahin hoti hai."" (As soon as you come out of the current, there is no particular difficulty in swimming backward).  The text also mentions that most drownings occur from fatigue when swimming against the current. Therefore, swimming *against* the current is what leads to exhaustion and danger. Swimming *across* the current (opposite direction) allows you to escape its pull.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Doosri disha mein tairkar dhara se baahar nikalne ki koshish karen, fir samanya roop se tairakar kinaare par vapas aa jayein (Try to swim out of the current in another direction, then generally swim back to the shore):**  This is not the best strategy. While swimming across might be part of the plan, the immediate priority is to escape the current's pull.
* **B: Dhara ke viruddh tezi se tairein (Swim strongly against the current):** This is *dangerous* and will lead to exhaustion.  The text says this is a common cause of drowning.
* **D: Satah ke niche tairein (Swim underwater):** This isn't specifically mentioned as a solution and could be risky due to potential hazards underwater.

Therefore, **C** is the most accurate and safest response based on the provided text.
"
"Passage ke hissab se, mahal ki kis jagah ka daura karne se chuttiyan safal ho jayengi?","The correct answer is **C: Rhine valley mein**.

Here's why:

The passage specifically mentions visiting ""Rain Valley ke mahalon mein jaanaa"" (going to the castles of Rain Valley). Rain Valley is a part of the Rhine Valley. Therefore, visiting the castles in the Rhine Valley would make the vacation successful according to the passage.
"
"Passage ke hisaab se, mahila yaatriyon ko nimnalikhit mein se kis baat ki anushansa nahi ki jati?","The correct answer is **C: Chamakdar gahne nahi pahanne chahiye (Women should not wear shiny jewelry)**.

Here's why:

The passage explicitly states that wearing a ring can be useful to deter unwanted attention, but it doesn't mention anything about avoiding shiny jewelry in general. The passage focuses on the danger of falsely claiming marital status and the potential for harassment.

Let's look at why the other options *are* mentioned:

*   **A: Vaivahik isthiti ke baare me batana (Talking about marital status):** The passage *specifically* warns against claiming to be married if you are not.
*   **B: Unhe savdhaan rehna chaahiye kyonki saanskritik matbhedon ke karan asthaniya log unka utpeedan kar sakte hain (They should be careful because local people can harass them due to cultural differences):**  The passage directly mentions the possibility of harassment due to cultural differences.
*   **D: Zarurat padne par behichak adee rahein (Be assertive when necessary):** The passage advises women to be assertive and stand firm, regardless of cultural differences.



"
"Passage me diye gaye kshetra ke hisab se, mahila yatriyon ke liye upayogi salah kya hai?","The correct answer is **D: Anchahe advance ke mamle mein, purushon ko dridhata se nakaren.**

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states: ""Purushon ko dridhata se nakaren aur apni baat par behichak adee rahein (saanskritik antaron ke hone yaa nahin hone se yah sahi nahin ho jaataa!).""  This translates to: ""Firmly reject unwanted advances and stick to your point (this is correct regardless of cultural differences!).""
* The passage also mentions the risk of harassment, including being followed or having someone grab them. This makes the advice to firmly reject unwanted advances crucial for safety.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Yah dekhna asamanya hai ki unka peechha ho (It's unusual for them to be followed):** This is not a helpful or accurate piece of advice. The passage warns of potential harassment and following.
* **B: Vaivaahik isthiti dikhane ke liye badi angoothi pehanna (Wearing a large ring to indicate marital status):** While the passage mentions wearing a ring, it also notes that it's not just for expensive display and emphasizes the risk of harassment regardless of the ring.  It's not the *primary* safety advice.
* **C: Yah samjhana ki saanskritik antaron ki vajah se apni baat par ade nahi rahna chahiye (Understanding that you shouldn't stick to your point because of cultural differences):** The passage *contradicts* this. It states you should stick to your point regardless of cultural differences.



Therefore, **D** is the most accurate and relevant advice for a female traveler in this region, based on the provided passage."
"Passage ke hisab se, is parisdrishya mein ek vanyajeev photographer ko kisi khaas lens ki aavashyakta hoti hai?","The correct answer is **A: Agar vishesh roop se chhote jeevon ki photography kar rahe hai**.

Here's why:

The passage states: ""Wildlife photography ko aksar halke mein hi lia jaataa hai, lekin saamanyatah photography ke tarah hi ek chitra hazaaron shabd se adhik keemat rakhta hai. **Wildlife photography ke liye aksar ek lambe telephoto lens ke aavashyakta hoti hai, haalaanki pakshiyon ke jhund yaa ek chhote praniyon ke photography ke liye anya lens ke aavashyakta hoti hai.**""

This directly indicates that a telephoto lens is often required for larger animals, but *other* lenses are needed for smaller animals. Option A aligns perfectly with this information.

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **B: Agar photographs ka upayog paise kamane ke lie kiya jata hai:**  The passage mentions regulations regarding taking photos for profit, but it doesn't specify a particular lens requirement for earning money.
* **C: Agar photo kheenche jane wale janwar sharmile hain:** While the passage mentions animals can be shy or aggressive, it doesn't connect this directly to needing a specific lens.
* **D: Agar kisi park mein vanyajeevon ki photography ke lie khaas niyam hain:**  The passage mentions regulations, but not lens requirements associated with them.



"
Passage mein nimnalikhit mein se kiska ullekh vanyajeev photographers ke lie sambhaavit chunauti ke roop mein nahin kiya gaya hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Aavashyak lens ke prakaar ko source karna (आवश्यक लेंस के प्रकार को स्रोत बनाना)**।

यहां क्यों:

* Passage में वन्यजीव फोटोग्राफी के लिए आवश्यक लेंस के प्रकार का उल्लेख है (जैसे कि लंबी टेलीफोटो लेंस)। लेकिन, ""आवश्यक लेंस के प्रकार को स्रोत बनाना"" का मतलब लेंस प्राप्त करना है, जो कि फोटोग्राफी के लिए एक तकनीकी पहलू है, लेकिन Passage में इसे फोटोग्राफरों के लिए संभावित चुनौती के रूप में नहीं बताया गया है।
* Passage में अन्य सभी विकल्प (अद्वितीय जानवरों को खोजना, आक्रामक जानवरों से निपटना, और प्रतिकूल वातावरण में काम करना) स्पष्ट रूप से वन्यजीव फोटोग्राफरों के लिए चुनौतियों के रूप में वर्णित किए गए हैं।

इसलिए, C विकल्प Passage में उल्लिखित संभावित चुनौतियों से अलग है।"
Pahadi darron se yatra karne vale driver ko nimnalikhit mein se kaunsi samasyaon ka sabse kam samna karna padta hai?,"The correct answer is **D: Drishyata kam hona (Reduced visibility)**.

Here's why:

* The passage explicitly states that ""Barf girne yaa vaahan ki khidkiyon par barf ke sanghanan se bhi drishyata kam ho sakti hai"" (Snowfall or accumulation of snow on vehicle windows can also reduce visibility).
* While the passage mentions reduced friction (kam gharshan) on snowy roads, it doesn't say drivers *always* face this issue. 
* The passage emphasizes the risk of heavy snowfall and blizzards, which significantly impact visibility.
* The passage doesn't mention ""Bahut zyada traffic"" (Very high traffic) as a typical concern in areas with cold and snowy conditions (it's the opposite).

Therefore, the passage highlights reduced visibility as a significant and likely problem for drivers navigating mountainous, snowy terrain.



"
Vibhin deshon mein aaykar mein kya chiz ek saman rehne ki adhik sambavna hai?,"The correct answer is **B: Sanrachana (Structure)**.

Here's why:

* **Structure (Sanrachana):** While tax rates and brackets vary significantly, the *overall structure* of a tax system (e.g., progressive, regressive, flat) tends to be more consistent across countries.  Most countries have a system with income thresholds and increasing tax rates as income rises.

* **Rates (Darein):** Income tax rates are highly variable between countries.

* **Filing Location (File karne ki jagah):**  Where you file your taxes is often tied to residency and can change, making it inconsistent.

* **Brackets (Bracket):** Tax brackets (the income ranges taxed at specific rates) vary widely.

Therefore, the tax *structure* is the most likely element to have some similarities across different countries, even though the specifics differ.
"
"Passage ke hisab se, agar aap videsh mein kam kar rahe hain lekin rehne vale kahi aur ke hain, to apna income tax kaha file karenge?","The correct answer is **A: Apne rehne vale asthan par (At your place of residence)**.

Here's why:

The passage states that diplomats working abroad typically pay income tax in the country where they *reside*.  It emphasizes that tax structures vary by country and depend on factors like income bracket and area.  The key is where you *live*, not necessarily where you *work*.
"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaunsa kathan World Fair ke baare mein sahi se nahi batata?,"सही उत्तर है **D: Deshon ko bhaag lene ki aavashyakata nahi hai**।

यहाँ स्पष्टीकरण दिया गया है:

* **विकल्प A:** ""Kisi desh ke itihas or sanskriti ko pradarshit kiya gaya hai"" - यह कथन सही है। प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि देश अपने इतिहास और संस्कृति को राष्ट्रीय पवेलियन में प्रदर्शित करते हैं।
* **विकल्प B:** ""Kalaatmak aur shaikshik pradarshan ke sath sath vanaspati udyaan ko pradasharni dikhaya gaya hai"" - यह कथन सही है। प्रश्न में विशेष रूप से अंतर्राष्ट्रीय बागवानी प्रदर्शनी का उल्लेख है, जिसमें फूल, वनस्पति उद्यान और पौधों के साथ कुछ और करने के प्रदर्शन शामिल हैं।
* **विकल्प C:** ""Ye ayojan chhah mahine tak chal sakte hain"" - यह कथन सही है। प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि विश्व मेले का आयोजन तीन से छह महीने के बीच किया जाता है।
* **विकल्प D:** ""Deshon ko bhaag lene ki aavashyakata nahi hai"" - यह कथन गलत है। प्रश्न में कहा गया है कि देश राष्ट्रीय पवेलियन में इतिहास और संस्कृति प्रदर्शित करने के लिए भाग लेते हैं। यह एक आवश्यक पहलू है।

इसलिए, विकल्प D विश्व मेले के बारे में गलत जानकारी देता है।"
Nimnalikhit mein se kaunsa World’s Fair ya antarrashtriya pradarshani ka niyam hai?,"The correct answer is **C: Ayojan adhiktam chhah mahine tak chalna chahiye** (The event should last for a maximum of six months).

Here's why:

* **The text explicitly states:** ""Aam taur par ye ayojan teen se chhah mahine ke bich kabhi bhi Aisi jagahon par aayojit kiye jaate hain..."" (Generally, these events are organized between three and six months on locations that are not less than 50 hectares).

Let's look at why the other options are incorrect:

* **A: Pradarshani mein desh ke itihas aur duniya ki samasyaon dono ko dikhaya jana chahiye** (The display should show both the history of the country and the world's problems): While this is a *purpose* of the World's Fair, the text doesn't state it's a *rule*. It says countries *present* these things.
* **B: Ek hi desh prativarsh ayojano ki mezbaani nahi kar sakta** (One country cannot host the event every year): The text says countries *can* host the event repeatedly (""way prativarsh jagah le sakte hain"").
* **D: Fair ke ayojan ke liye sabhi deshon ko bhag lena chahiye** (All countries have to participate for the fair to be organized): The text says countries *can* host the fair, but it doesn't mandate that *all* countries must participate.

inmein se kaunsa kaam karne se janwar ke hamle ki sambavana kam ho jayegi?,"The correct answer is **C: Bhediyon se 25 yard ki doori banayein rakhna**.

Here's why:

* **The passage explicitly states:** ""Park authorities ke mutabik bhaaluon aur bhediyon se kam se kam 100 yards/meters aur anya jangli jaanvaron se kam se kam 25 yarders/meters door rahein."" (According to park authorities, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and at least 25 yards/meters away from other wild animals.) This directly addresses reducing the risk of attack by maintaining a safe distance.

Let's look at why the other options are less suitable:

* **A: Sugandhit jadee-bootiyan le jaana (Carrying fragrant herbs):** The passage mentions that strong smells attract bears. Carrying fragrant herbs would likely *increase* the risk of an attack.
* **B: Shivir se khachra hatana (Removing debris from the campsite):** While keeping a clean campsite is good practice (mentioned in the passage regarding food), removing debris doesn't directly address the distance issue with animals.
* **D: Bache hue bhojan se janavaron ko rokna (Preventing animals from getting to leftover food):** This is important for not attracting animals, but it doesn't directly minimize the chance of an encounter and attack *if* an animal is already present.



Therefore, maintaining a safe distance from animals is the most direct way to reduce the likelihood of an attack, making option C the correct answer."
Nimnalikhit mein se kiska ullekh passage mein vanyajeevon ke hamalon ke sambhaavit karan ke roop mein nahin kiya gaya hai?,"सही उत्तर है **C: Vanyajeevon ko khana khilana**।

यहां बताया गया है कि क्यों:

*   **Passage में स्पष्ट रूप से उल्लेख किया गया है कि vanyajeevon को खाना खिलाना या परेशान करना गलत है**, और यह भी बताया गया है कि ऐसा करने से वे खतरे में आ सकते हैं।
*   **Passage में उल्लेख किया गया है कि vanyajeevon के हमलों का संभावित कारण दूरी बनाए रखने में विफलता है** (यह विकल्प B है)।
*   **Passage में उल्लेख किया गया है कि कुछ गंध, जैसे कि गंधक युक्त खाद, vanyajeevon को आकर्षित करती है** (यह विकल्प A है)।
*   **Passage में उल्लेख किया गया है कि अनजान जानवर भी हमला कर सकते हैं** (यह विकल्प D है)।

इसलिए, विकल्प C passage में उल्लिखित vanyajeevon के हमलों के संभावित कारण नहीं है।"
