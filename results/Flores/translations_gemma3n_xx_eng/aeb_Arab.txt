This doesn't confirm the holiness of the fact that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is a common theory, but it offers additional details that fossils generally cannot provide, like color and arrangement, you see.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were chestnut brown on top and the sides were a yellowish-beige or a color of carotenoids.
The discovery provides a greater understanding of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers don't have a fully developed bony chain, called the "spine," but they have other features of feathers - like barbs and small projections. Researchers have discovered that the spine was largely a separate evolutionary development from these other characteristics.
The structure of the wings suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggest that despite this tail belonging to a small dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers belonging to a single large one, not a small chick.

They found hydrogen cyanide and melamine in samples analyzed from pets that died after eating contaminated pet food.
As researchers at the university have said, the two compounds react with each other to form crystals that disrupt kidney function.
Researchers have noticed crystals forming in the urine of cattails when melamine and cyanuric acid are added.
The composition of these crystals is identical to that found in the affected animal's bladder when compared using infrared spectroscopy (FTIR).
I don't know what you're thinking about this story or not, but most of the goods coming from Central America enter this country without taxes.
Despite this, we pay taxes on eighty percent of the goods we export through customs tariffs in Central American countries.
This is not logical, and it's also not fair.
Everything I tell people, they treat you the way they treated us.
California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed a bill prohibiting the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The bill stipulates that a warning label reading "18" be placed on violent video games sold in the state of California, and anyone who sells them to a minor will face a fine of $1000 per offense.
The Prosecutor General, Kier Starmer QC, issued a statement this morning announcing the trial of Hołownia and Price.
He resigned, and they want to replace him in the Council of Ministers with a member of parliament, specifically Difi. What is unexpected is that the member of parliament, Norman Lamb, will take the position of Minister of Business, which will leave it vacant for Difi.
He and Bryce are in agreement to attend court at Westminster on February 16th.
The deceased were Nicolas Aldin, 25 years old, and Zakari Koudibac, 21 years old, and Koudibac was the one who was driving.
Edgar Veyna injured his hand and mouth, while Christopher Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Schneider is suffering from constant pain, one of his eyes is blind, and he lost some of his skull; his face was rebuilt with titanium. All of this happened when the "Okha" weapon failed to kill a fifth man it was aimed at in the head.
Schneider submitted his statement in a link to a video from a US Air Force base in his country.
After what happened on Wednesday, Karpanido competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first race was a slalom ski race, and she didn't finish the first round. 36 out of 116 competitors got the same result in this race.
And her race to the end – the giant slalom ski race – she achieved tenth place in the women's sitting group with a run time of 4:41.30, which is 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Luchs and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Gjonji Dani.
Four para-skiers from the disabled team failed to finish their heats, and 45 of a total of 117 skiers in the giant slalom race failed to achieve a placement in the race.
The police are urging you to recover the stolen computer and mobile phone.
The Deputy Prosecutor General said, "We arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman and recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are Baba Kangar, Botha Kanga, Ramبرو Kangar, Gaza Kangar, and Vishnu Kangar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, said that the defendants attacked the court and had their faces covered.
Despite there being three people in the house when I entered, they didn't hit me.
The driver hit him hard on the head.
The bags that were involved in the accident were locked, and emergency services got the driver out of a red Audi TT.
They shook the Molotov cocktail at James Baggett of Great Yarmouth.
He went to the Belvedere on Speybrocht in Cambridge.
Since then, Adikaia has been accused in the Sheriff's Court in Edinburgh of murdering her son.
She is currently suspended, awaiting indictment and trial. Any evidence from a witness is questionable because her picture has been published everywhere.
This is a common practice, Yasser, in other courts in the United Kingdom. However, the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts considered that publishing the images could be biased.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee says that "it appears to me that journalists are heading in a dangerous direction if they publish photos or anything related to any suspect."
The office of the public prosecutor, generally responsible for allegations, told journalists that there wouldn't be any other comments until at least the indictment.
The document reportedly reveals, according to the leak, the disagreement on borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The other topics that they say are related to it guarantee the future status of Jerusalem, which we consider an important issue for both peoples, and they also have the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a continued military presence in the Golan Heights for ten years, barely after they correct the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to this continued presence for five years, as it is.
The team needed to increase close supervision on the integrated pest control experiment they launched. The experiment is being monitored and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
In partnership between the "National Parks and Wildlife Authority" and the "Australian Sports Archers Association," they selected qualified volunteers within the association's hunting program.
According to Mike O'Flynn, the acting director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four fishermen selected for the first hunting operation received safety guidelines and comprehensive training.
Yesterday, Martili took the oath in a new temporary electoral council consisting of nine members.
This is Martelli's fifth interim electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential committee recommended the resignation of the interim legislative council as part of a series of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The committee was Martelli's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests have started, which sometimes turn violent, because they failed to hold the elections that were supposed to happen since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating in "iPod" devices were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said that they were considering 27 incidents related to devices.
Last Friday, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents of overheating phones, and the company classified them as "not serious."
The ministry replied to Apple's request to postpone the report, saying "very regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (Friday 9:19 PM Greenwich Mean Time).
The Emergency Management Office in Northern Mariana stated that they haven't been notified of any damage in the country.
The Tsunami Warning Center in the Pacific region stated that there are no indications of a tsunami occurring.
A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, and took two tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza opened fire with his M16 rifle on the tourists.
Many hostages are being rescued, and at least six people are confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages were released early, including children and the elderly, along with the Filipino photographers.
And then the photographers took the place of عزوزة because she needed to go to the bathroom. And they shot at Mendoza.
His father's leggings and he worked as a doctor.
And he trained as an obstetrics doctor and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Oakland in 1959.
"Leggins" is investigating premature births during his free time, which was when he worked at the hospital.
Research has shown that administering a hormone accelerates lung maturation in the fetus.
"Xinhua" reported that government investigators received the flight recorders, also known as the "black box," on Wednesday.
The wrestling colleagues spoke well of Lona.
Tumi Dreamer said: "Luna was the first extremist queen. My first manager, Luna passed away on the night of the two moons. A strong woman, one of a kind."
Dustin "Goldust" Rhodes said: "Luna was quirky like me... maybe even more than me... we loved her and we'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Out of 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the percentage of those in favor of Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard said during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia needs to become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the financial respondents agree with this viewpoint and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
Regarding the conflicting opinions in the survey, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
The physical fitness of the gold medalist in the Olympic Games is questionable due to his complaints, and he had to swim 100m and 200m freestyle in three stages at the Commonwealth Games.
I can't take the necessary medication to reduce the pain because its use is prohibited in the games.
Curtiss Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Missouri–Kansas City, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using various devices and programs, starting at the beginning of February, and announced it on Tuesday.
Perhaps comets were a source of delivering water to Earth, along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists love to understand how the planets formed, especially how Earth formed from the impact of comets with the Earth a long time ago.
Kimo is 53 years old, he started his tenure at the beginning of this year and approved the draft law last month that legalizes same-sex marriage.
He said that the rumors were "political gossip and nonsense."
He/She could run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the Federal Aviation Administration says will allow pilots to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of liters of kerosene each year and reducing carbon emissions.
It uses a technology linked to satellites, unlike the old technology that uses ground radar to allow air controllers to pinpoint the aircraft's location more accurately and provides pilots with more specific information.
There aren't any additional transportation options, and the ground trains won't stop at Wembley. There aren't also more parking spaces, parking facilities, or transport hubs.
The fear of a shortage of transportation has raised the possibility that the interview will be conducted without an audience.
A study was published Thursday in the journal "Science" about the emergence of a new type of bird in the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in America and Uppsala University in Sweden said that the development of new species has accelerated by two generations, despite their belief that this process would take much longer – due to the interbreeding between the Darwin's finch, the ground finch, the cactus finch, and the ground finch with the past beak.
Gold can be shaped into many forms. It can be damaged in small pieces.
It can be pulled into a thin thread that twists and turns. It can be rolled or folded into shapes like leaves.
It could be thinned a bit and applied to another metal. And it could be so thin that it was used for hours to decorate hand-drawn pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
The pH of a chemical substance is determined, and an indicator for this pH can be made from red cabbage juice.
The color of red cabbage juice changes according to the acidity of the substance, not its alkalinity.
The pH level is measured by the number of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the chemical substance you want to test.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (because hydrogen atoms are composed of one proton and one electron).
Mix the dry powders together and squeeze them with clean, damp hands until they form a ball.
The moisture on your hands interacts with the outer layers, giving you a strange feeling and forming a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with drainage in almost every house, connected to an advanced sewage system.
Remnants of sewage systems were found in the homes of the cities of Minoan in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were extra toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were a part of public baths that men and women would go to together.
How do you communicate with someone thousands of miles away? You use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost simultaneously.
The satellite is launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and visibility.
The matter requires a giant rocket, taller than 100 feet, to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel changed the shape of the world remarkably; but what Lina contributed most significantly was making transportation easier and faster.
They brought us the train, the car, and a lot of other transportation devices.
Below them, there are other cats of medium size that feed on prey of medium size, ranging from rabbits to gazelles and antelopes.
There are a lot of small kittens (including stray house cats) eating small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of rank, a special function for each cat that prevents them from competing with others.
Black cats are the most social cats and live in large groups called packs.
A pride of lions consists of one adult male and three adult males, along with females and cubs, totaling up to thirty.
Usually, the females are closer to each other, being a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves like a pride of wolves, not like dogs. And surprisingly, these animals resemble lions (but not other large cats) in their behavior and kill their prey.
With its athletic build, the tiger can climb (even if not very well), and swimming and jumping long distances, and its bite force is five times stronger than a human's.
The tiger belongs to the same group (the genus of tigers) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. The four are the only ones who can roar.
The roar of a tiger isn't like the roar of a lion – all volume – but it's closer to a yell with angry words.
The dwarf tiger likes to eat small animals, and hunts monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if he gets the chance. And most of the animals that the dwarf tiger hunts are smaller than him.
Scholars believe that the fennec foxes track and hunt animals using their sense of smell; they even sniff out where they are on the ground.
You can see well in the dark with the night vision feature, and it moves stealthily even more. The Sumatran tiger hunts fruit bats by hiding in its surroundings and pouncing on them.
How do we separate a small group of living organisms (a small population) from the main population they belong to (for example, if they migrate across a mountain range or river, and cannot easily return from a new island), they mostly find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in previously.
Given that this new environment contains different resources and competitors, the newly formed group needs different characteristics or methods of adaptation to become a stronger competitor compared to its previous needs for strength.
There hasn't been any change to the original population ever, and they still need the same adaptation methods as we've always known them.
Over time, the new residents gradually adapt to their new environment, becoming slightly less similar to the other residents.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two groups will be so different that we wouldn't even say they are of the same type.
This process we call speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is considered a deterministic outcome and an important part of much evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (i.e., exhalation).
Plants make their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide more shade.
We make our houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat comes from plants, too. Without plants, animals can't live.
The Mosasaurus was the dominant predator in its time. That's why it wasn't afraid of anything, except for other Mosasaurs.
The long jaws they had were encrusted with more than 70 teeth, resembling blades, along with another set in the roof of the mouth, which means there's nothing to stand in his way and prevent him from escaping.
We don't know exactly, but perhaps he had a diverse diet. His diet included turtles, the giant whale, and other dinosaurs, and he might have been a carnivore.
And it attacked everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't escape it.
Despite the fact that we recognize most of the foods eaten during the holiday, the Romans also had their share of unusual or uncommon festive dishes, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and a type of rodent called the zaghba.
There was another difference: when the poor and women ate, they sat on benches, while the wealthy men liked to hold feasts with each other and would recline on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman meals didn't include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have any cotton, or tomatoes, or potatoes, or cocoa, and the ancient Romans didn't eat dandelions.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, and it was considered the house of the god.
People used to offer sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to serve the gods during celebrations and holidays.
Every temple has an open courtyard leading to a safe sanctuary that only the priests can enter.
They built unique clock towers shaped like pyramids called ziggurats, which were part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a safe haven for God.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't considered very important.
Most of the Jewish family's life was outdoors.
The women were tidying up the household items in the courtyard. The passageways were just makeshift counters overlooking the street. And they used stone to build the houses.
There weren't any large forests in the land of Canaan, that's why wood was so expensive.
People settled in Greenland scattered. Scandinavian sagas tell that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland on a charge of murder, and how he traveled to the west, finding land which he named Greenland.
Regardless of their discovery, Inuit tribes lived there previously.
There were significant differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of the countries of "Denmark," "Sweden," "Norway," and "Iceland," despite them all being "Scandinavians."
If you watch the movie "The National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map is depicted on the back of the Independence Declaration.
But that's not true. Even though there's something written on the back of the paper, it's not a treasure map.
The phrase "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776" is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence. The text appears at the bottom of the paper, upside down.
Although it's not specifically written in this part of the text, we know that the large manuscript (measuring 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was stored folded at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it's likely the code was simply added as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the battles that followed led to the liberation of northern France, but the south hadn't been liberated yet at that time.
France was ruled by "Vichy." They are the French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and served with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France, and called the operation "Operation Dragoon".
In two weeks, there will be good fortune. The Americans liberated the Free French forces south of France, and they were heading to Germany.
Civilization is a shared individual culture among a large group of people who live and work together cooperatively.
The origin of the word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," and is related to "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or the state of the city. This defines an additional method of how the social mass is structured.
Self-sufficient cities are like the ancestors of nations. Civilized culture means transmitting knowledge across many generations, leaving a lasting cultural imprint, and disseminating knowledge in a fair way.
Many small cultures are disappearing without leaving any real historical record or being recognized as genuine civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states formed a weak central government, and the Congress existed under the framework of the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no authority to impose taxes, and because there was no national executive or judicial authority, nor did it rely on the state authorities, which were mostly uncooperative, to enforce all its laws.
And he didn't have the authority to exceed tax laws and tariffs imposed between regions.
The materials required unanimous approval from all governorates before they could be amended, and the governorates mocked the central government to the point that their representatives were always absent.
The Italian national team, along with the German national team, are among the second most successful teams in the world in football and were champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, luge, and Formula One car racing.
Winter sports are the most popular in the northern regions, and Italians competed in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has about 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the seventh largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands Japan possesses, it is usually called -from a geographical perspective- an "archipelago".
Taiwan appeared to be on the road back in the 15th century, and European sailors passing by it called it Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to change the original grain production practices and employ Chinese laborers in the rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty armies (1644-1912) dominated the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government revised the Treaty of Shimonoseki, through which China ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
The city of Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings, which are Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the House of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings present have been rebuilt on the edges of the complex to give tourists a better idea of how it originally appeared.
In 1976, they recovered thirty percent of Machu Picchu, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the standard focal length for still photography worldwide is 35mm, which was the dominant film format at the end of the film photography era.
Its production continues to this day, but more importantly, the image sensors in digital cameras have the same aspect ratio.
The 35mm model is actually a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
The aspect ratio of the image is (how do we divide by 12 to get a simpler whole number ratio) it's 3:2.
It equals or approximates many common aspect ratios (like a set of advanced image system formats) this one.
The rule of threefold (or the law of three) that is often misused and that people always make fun of, constitutes a simple guiding principle that works to create dynamics while maintaining a degree of order in a clear image.
The most impactful place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image vertically and horizontally (see the example).
The Catholic Church, which became wealthy and powerful, was subject to scrutiny during this period of European history.
Christianity has linked European countries together for over a thousand years, despite differences in language and customs.
The comprehensive power she possessed affected everyone, from the king to the general public.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the Church's money exists specifically for this reason.
The central authority belonged to the Church in Rome for over a thousand years. This concentration of power and money sparked a lot of people's questioning regarding adherence to the requirements of the doctrine.
Soon, Britain started blockading Germany by sea after the skirmishes began.
The strategy proved effective; cutting off military and civilian supplies, despite the fact that this blockade violates generally applicable international law, which has been codified and coordinated in several international agreements in the past two centuries.
Britain has grabbed international waters to prevent any ship from entering entire sectors of the oceans, a move that has threatened even neutral vessels.
Because the response was limited to this tactic, I expected Germany to react similarly to the U-boat war that wasn't restricted to them.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were peacefulness and isolation.
After they saw the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries wanted to avoid this situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to America to work for Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in America with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of presenting different time periods; each era of China, or each dynasty in power, was of a different kind.
And between each ruling dynasty, there was an unstable era of divided states. The most famous period was that of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
During these periods, a fierce war broke out between many nobles to seize the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, and thousands of people died in wars vying for the highest positions in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from the dictatorship to a republican system, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not just the ruler.
After the revolution, professions were open to all qualified applicants, and those with greater ambition were allowed to succeed more than others.
The same applies to the army, because the army's classifications now are based on weaponry instead of class.
The French Revolution inspired many more oppressed working-class people in other countries to ignite their own revolutions.
Mohammed was interested, Yasser, in matters that transcend this worldly life. And he used to go to Ghar, and then ascend to "Hiraa" atop Mount "Nur" to meditate.
This cave, which has remained throughout the ages, gives us a vivid and clear picture of the spiritual inclinations of the Prophet Muhammad.
The cave is located on the summit of a mountain in the north of Mecca, and it is isolated, Yasser, from the rest of the world. **Note:** "ياسر" (Yasser) appears to be an interjection or name inserted into the sentence. I've included it in the translation as is, as its meaning isn't clear from the context. It might be an expression of surprise or emphasis, or simply a name.
In truth, it wasn't a simple thing, even if you knew it existed. And as soon as you entered the cave, it became completely isolated.
You can't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky above the mountains located in that place. Nor can you hear or see much of this world in the middle of the cave.
The Great Pyramid in Giza Governorate is the only one of the Seven Wonders that is still standing to this day.
The Egyptians built it in the third century BC. The Great Pyramid is one of the large pyramids built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or the "Giza necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings has a lot of pyramids (the Great Pyramid is the largest) as well as smaller tombs, temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were also built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "acute accent" looks like the letter "V," and the "grave accent" looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
An upward arrow means you have to start from the top and pull the curve, while a downward arrow means you have to start from the end of the curve (meaning you pull the curve with your hands) and tighten it.
The upper vocal fold usually produces a softer sound, and the lower vocal fold is stronger.
Don't hesitate to draw your markings with a pencil, but don't forget that the printed crooked markings exist for a musical reason, that's why you usually have to respect them.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their young children (Marie Thérèse who was 11 years old, and Louis Charles and Charles-Philippe who were four years old), and the King's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, found themselves forced to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789, amidst a chaotic atmosphere of market women.
They returned to Paris via Calais, and a lot of people were with them, shouting and chanting against the King and Queen.
A group of fans succeeded in forcing the King and Queen to resolve their youth issues.
A member of the gang gestured at a dead Royal Guard in Versailles with his head in front of the grieving Queen at a specific time.
The Filipino people are the ones who bore the expenses of an imperial war that America waged on the Philippines.
These people were forced to pay taxes to the American colonizer to cover a large part of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government in Wall Street.
Of course, the huge profits coming from exploiting the Filipino people for a long time will be the main gain for American imperialism.
We need to understand the context that led to the organization existing, so that we can understand the Knights Templar.
The era when those events happened was called the High Middle Ages, which is a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages came before the Early Middle Ages, and then came the Late Middle Ages, and everyone who died in all of them was roughly in the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing a broad range of ideas in practice, from the idea that technology drives society or that technological necessity exists, to the strong feeling that there is a fundamental logic linked to scientific laws and their manifestations in technology that controls the destiny of humankind.
There are two common underlying ideas in most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology on its own follows a course that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on stable societies, not those that are not connected to society.
For example, there are people who say that the electricity engine will connect us to road development.
However, creating a network of roads throughout the country is a bit daunting if it doesn't bring in economic profit. That's why they are developing new roads to lower the cost of car ownership.
The collective ownership of cars increases the rate of road accidents, which generates new technologies in healthcare to treat injured bodies.
Romance had a big influence in the cultural determinism brought by writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schelling.
Within the context of the Romantic movement, geography is what shaped people, and at the same time, customs and culture related to that geography emerged. These were considered, being harmonious with the community's place, better than laws imposed by force.
Paris is famous especially for being the fashion capital of the modern world, and Constantinople was the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It became known as a center of luxury from the year 400 AD until the year 1100 AD.
Its value plummeted in the 12th century due to the return of the Crusades, which brought back their gifts like silk and spices, which were more valuable than what was available in the Byzantine markets.
At this time, Paris has replaced Constantinople as the fashion capital.
Gothic style arrived in Tebkha between the 10th and 14th centuries.
Initially, Byzantine culture had a significant impact on the East.
Despite this and due to the slow spread of information through communication channels, patterns in the West can be delayed by approximately 25 to 30 years.
In the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at that time was the Crusades, how people started using locks to secure their livestock.
Subsistence farming is the farming they do to produce enough food to feed the farmer and his family.
Subsistence farming – often organic – is a simple system where they use stored seedlings suitable for the local climate, along with crop rotation or other easy techniques to increase production.
Most farmers used to work in subsistence farming, and this situation still exists in many developing countries.
Subcultures foster connections among individuals with similar thought patterns and those who feel marginalized by societal norms, enabling them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are likely distinct due to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The characteristics that define a subculture can be the language, or aesthetics, or religion, or politics, or gender, or geography, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures show their affiliation through their clothing, behavior, and the language they speak.
One of the well-known methods in Ras el-Ain that they use to illustrate the importance of socialization relies on some traumatic cases of children who suffered, whether they were neglected, suffered hardship, or were harmed by abuse, and those who are not socially connected to adults when they grow up.
These little ones are called "the wild ones" or "the feral ones." Some people have taken in some lost children (usually whose parents)... In some cases, the neglect of children was due to the parents' refusal to accept the significant mental and physical disabilities of the child.
Ferocious children can be subjected to mistreatment in their childhood or to strong traumas before they are neglected or run away.
And there are others who say that those who raised them were animals; and there are a few others who say that they lived in the forest alone.
When a child is raised by non-human animals, the wild child exhibits behaviors (within physical limits) that closely resemble the behaviors of a domesticated animal, such as fear of humans or not wanting to mistreat them.
Despite project-based learning making the learning process easier and more important, support goes beyond that.
Interactive learning is not a method of learning, but rather a supporting tool that provides support to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Interactive learning can be virtual or on-site; and, in another form, the teacher is a form of interactive learning, as is the paperclip man in Microsoft Office.
Interactive learning is supported within the program and aims to pose questions, provide motivation, and explain procedures that students may find difficult to handle independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons ranging from neglect and abuse to extortion.
It's not necessary for anyone, even the youngest, to grow up in an environment that doesn't prioritize nurturing, care, and education, but they are still growing up like this.
He knows that the alternative care system is considered a safe zone for children.
Our foster care system is intended to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Alternative care must provide all the necessities that they lacked in the homes they came from before.
The internet combines elements of both mass and personal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of approaches to uses and methods of satisfaction.
For example, some propose "learning" and "socialization" as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personalized participation" and "lasting relationships" were identified as new motivational aspects by Amy and McCord (1998) in their study of audience response to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important discoveries in the field of interpreting micro-expressions, which are facial movements lasting for a fraction of a second.
They say, especially that a slave can discover if someone is lying by how they interpret small expressions correctly. **Note:** The phrase "العبد ينجم" is a bit unusual and might carry a metaphorical meaning depending on context. I've translated it literally as "a slave" but it could also imply someone who is very observant or perceptive.
Oliver Sacks, in his paper, pointed out that the president's speech suggests that individuals unable to understand speech due to brain damage are capable of accurately assessing truthfulness.
And also consider the idea that these abilities are shared with some animals in the analysis of human behavior, like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown the existence of two groups regarding genetic variations: a hidden group and another apparent group.
The boom increases new genetic variations, and natural selection eliminates them from the pool of expressive variations.
Separation and reassembly lead to variation that is random, not a continuous or gradual change between the two groups with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for ruminant animals with a digestive system similar to humans to meet their amino acid requirements from the available plant resources.
Also, failure in this can lead to severe consequences: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources that are easily and abundantly available were the proteins that can be obtained from leaves and legumes, but these proteins are difficult for us, as vertebrates, to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal foods (ants, white ants, and eggs) are not as easy to digest as it is, but they provide proteins in high quantities and contain all the essential amino acids.
If you take everything into consideration, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in some way, like chimpanzees in the savanna.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking up during your normal sleep period and then sleeping again after a short period (10 to 60 minutes).
You can easily use this little stimulant to bring you back to consciousness without fully waking you up all at once.
You would find yourself returning to sleep in the mattress while lying down. You can put it in another part of the house; you don't need to get up from the bed to silence it.
The other options, based on biological systems, include drinking a lot of fluids (especially water and tea, and a diuretic) before bed, so one will feel the urge to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely related to the amount of stress in their body and soul.
The less tension there is, the more positivity life's strength gives you. Everyone has the potential to find peace and complete contentment.
Everyone is striving for enlightenment. The only thing that prevents it is our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it expanded through the Mahayana path of love and other Hindu yoga techniques.
Tibetan Buddhism is extremely simple in principle. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everyone.
The energy of "Kundalini" (the energy of enlightenment) awakens through yoga pauses, breathing exercises, singing, and visualizations, with "Kundalini Yoga."
The Tibetan meditation center is the god of yoga. By visualizing the different deities, the energy channels purify, the chakras become activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany represented a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States of America. However, with the end of the war, the clash of systems, procedures, and cultures led to the outbreak of conflict between the two countries.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It should have been this war lasting forty years ahead, and the fighting would have been in the field, on the roads of proxy armies, in battlegrounds from Africa to Asia, and in Afghanistan, and Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Via Romana.
Nevertheless, these plans weren't formed overnight. When more than 800,000 Red Army soldiers entered the Soviet Union and formed the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after the invasion of the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
Using cargo ships is considered the most effective way to transport a lot of people and goods across the oceans.
Traditions dictate that the mission of the navy is to ensure your country's ability to transport its people and goods, but at the same time, it is exposed to the ability of your enemy to transport their people and goods.
One of the most prominent modern examples is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans tried to shake things up with people and goods in the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
At the same time, the German navy was trying to counter this invasion, especially in this submarine world.
If the Allies had failed, the majority would have been Germany entering Britain, just like it did with the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time in close to 10,000 years in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes started raising livestock and other animals for their own benefit, to easily provide milk, hair, meat, and hides.
The dairy goats were generally raised in herds that grazed on hills and other grazing lands, often herded freely with the majority being young or adolescents, like regular grazing livestock. These grazing methods are still used to this day.
Carrot bags were made in England in the 16th century.
Although old carriage wheels were made of parallel planks, they allowed the horses to pull harder, run faster, and shake the harness much more compared to the axles that were considered very difficult at that time.
They invented the iron for trains a little while ago to fix the tracks, but later it became apparent that when they put the railway line on top of the track, it makes it more effective.
And she did as is customary for them, except that the iron consumed the wheels and the plank of the stalls.
And in the end, they replaced the wooden wheels with iron wheels. In 1767, they used the first complete iron axles.
Walking was the first means of transportation. Humans started walking upright two million years ago, coinciding with the emergence of Homo erectus (meaning upright man).
Their ancestors, Australopithecus, didn't walk upright in a stable manner.
Fossil remains of foot bones have been found in Australopithecus excavations dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start living more sustainably, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even be proactive in reducing future suffering to some extent.
This is exactly like treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we need to find the root of the problems and address them properly.
It's clear that the world has changed a lot because of scientific progress and technology for humanity, and problems have grown due to population growth and the luxurious lifestyle of humans.
After it was adopted by Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft was sent to John Dunlap's print shop, a little nearby, where it was corrected by Speaker of the House John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson.
At night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as "Dunlap Monetary Bulletins."
The first public reading of the document by John Nixon took place in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25-fold documents represent the oldest remaining copies of the US Declaration of Independence, but the original handwritten version did not survive.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think of them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things related to birds that still appear like dinosaurs.
It has legs with external layers of protection and claws, and it lays eggs, and it walks on its legs in succession like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
All computers used today rely, by default, on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, which are 0 or 1, and these numbers are referred to as binary numbers – or bits – which we use in the programming language of the computer.
Internal poisoning might not show its symptoms immediately. An immediate diagnosis can't be built just because symptoms like vomiting appear, as they are generally not specific enough.
The presence of a dissolved medicine packet or toxic chemicals at home can be a good indicator of internal poisoning.
Look at the label to learn the first aid instructions specific to the given poison.
Insect scientists use the term "aphid" in its official sense to refer to this group of insects.
This word comes from the ancient knowledge of bed bugs, and they are insects that have adapted significantly to parasitizing humans.
Both "killer cockroach" and "bed bug" are well-known for their incubation period, and they adapt to living in the nest or home of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research indicates that the likelihood of females being affected by multiple sclerosis is twice that of males.
A couple can decide that it's not in their best interest, or in the best interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples can choose to create a savings plan for their children's education.
In an adoption process, the original parents relinquish their parental rights so that two other spouses can care for the child.
The main goal of science is to understand the way the world works through a scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
Despite this not being unique in this matter, experimentation is considered a test that can be used to refute one or more potential hypotheses; posing questions and making observations also guides scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on ancient texts, and particularly on the Gospel in Latin.
I accepted Aristotle's views on all scientific matters, including psychology.
At the time knowledge fell among the Greeks, the West found itself isolated from its philosophical and scientific Greek roots.
In many instances, the rhythms of research in physiology and behavior at Barsha depend on self-cycles and their production through biological clocks.
The rhythmic cycles have been documented, and they are not just responses to external periodic signals, for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-oscillators that communicate during periods of consecutive cycles until external influences begin to affect them.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used precipitates or viruses to introduce their DNA into the bacteria.
They conducted two experiments to label either nuclear thymine acid using radioactive phosphorus or its protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the affected cells are from germline cells or not.
Mutations in germline cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas who love to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife, flora, and fauna.
The examples of activities that can be done at the fishing site include fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting gardens, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, filming, and learning information about this type of monkey (orangutan) in Borneo.
People leave the small towns in droves every morning to go work, and they meet other workers on the way in the place they just left.
In this vibrant mode of transport, everyone supports and is connected to a transportation system based on their own personal grudges.
The scientific community points to the fact that the massive economy dependent on carbon has displaced a vital ecosystem from one of its stable states that supported human development over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation systems. Everyone is complaining about the transportation systems.
Rarely do you hear in developed countries levels like this of complaints about water quality and collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems produce these complaints, and why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic is the study of the movement of drivers and individual vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because you can't predict driver behavior one hundred percent.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonable pattern; that's why traffic flow exhibits a reasonable pattern and can be expressed approximately mathematically.
To better clarify traffic flow, relationships were established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were among the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects are characterized by their ability to fold their wings along the length of their bodies.
This gives them a larger collection of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that can't fold their wings today are dragonflies and water gnats.
Since thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the sun (and even the other stars).
This thing seems logical, because you don't feel the ground moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest river and the largest river in the world. It contains more water than eight times what is in the second largest river in the world.
The Amazon River is the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of up to 9.66 kilometers in some places.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the water that flows into the world's oceans from the planet's rivers.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Despite the fact that the construction of pyramids using stone continued even until the late Egyptian Old Kingdom, the pyramids in Giza are unmatched in terms of size and artistic distinction in construction.
The Musarawa people were astonished by the ancient relics of their ancestors that remained for more than a thousand years in the modern kingdom.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and has the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is the language of everyday life used by most government employees, while Latin is usually used in religious ceremonies.
All the residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, and it's possible to discover all these elements in nature in their original form and extract them relatively easily using primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is similar to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although it assumes that they transform into new materials to form what we have observed.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered minerals. And there are minerals in nature like silver and gold, too.
Furthermore, it's crystallized to obtain alloys containing small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the universe is created from matter. All matter is created from small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny, that trillions of them can fit in the space of the period at the end of this sentence.
The pencil quickly became a wonderful friend to many people when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing tools, the use of pencils has decreased and their status has declined.
People write messages on the computer these days, instead of using a typewriter.
The slave wonders how the keyboard will become obsolete when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the basis that it gathers energy to form a core filled with protons and neutrons.
It's like rolling a heavy ball over a hill. The core cracks again, and a bit of that energy comes out.
Some of the atoms have nuclei that are not stable, meaning they tend to break apart with a simple movement or change.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The length of the ridge is approximately 70 kilometers on the near side and 100 kilometers on the far side.
The lowest offering is under Maria, and the highest is under the highlands.
There might still be lunar lava on the near side because the crust is thinner. It would have been easier for the lava to erupt to the surface.
Content theories are churning, but they can't find anything to excite or attract people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs or desires that emerge and manifest when they reach a certain point.
These theories explore the need that drives some people to enjoy doing certain things and the things in their environment that influence whether or not they do specific actions.
Two common theories of motivation are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge to make managers lead their former colleagues, one of them being the attempt to remain like the others.
This type of manager struggles with making unpleasant decisions, implementing disciplinary actions, performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
Another thing is, one transforms into someone who can no longer feel, and feels they must/needs to change everything the team used to do and possess.
Ultimately, the captain is primarily responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This behavior manifests in many situations of conflict between leaders and the rest of the team members.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of distinction as traditional teams, but there are some subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their physical groups.
They often had more autonomy than members of traditional teams, and their teams could be organized according to different time zones, which might not be understood by their local administration.
Larson and Lafasto (1989, p. 109) describe the existence of a genuine "shadow team" as a unique component of a virtual team.
Each member submits their reports to the "invisible team" (the management team), and the "invisible team" sets the standards for each member.
Why would a certain organization want to establish an educational organization in a process that takes a long time? Innovation is one of the goals of applying the concepts of institutional learning.
By effectively utilizing all available resources in the organizational administration process, we can see innovation and excellence.
As a result, synergy within the organization can be achieved to overcome obstacles and focus on implementing new, innovative measures that meet the needs of all.
Before the organization can be able to innovate, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the concept of continuous improvement as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
The availability of data linked to neuroscience provides tangible evidence for the theoretical approach in knowledge research. This helps to narrow down the research area and make it much more precise.
The connection between neurology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, injuries, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain cognitive functions.
New technologies allow us to see and explore brain structures and processes in ways we never thought possible before.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Despite the fact that artificial intelligence has a strong connotation with science fiction, it represents an important branch of computer science and deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation in machines.
The search in artificial intelligence involves creating machines to perform tasks that require intelligent behavior automatically.
The examples include control, planning, scheduling, and the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions. Furthermore, you recognize handwriting, voice, and facial features.
These things are no longer separate fields, but rather focus on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are currently being used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, to create many applications for home PCs or video games.
Field trips are a big part of any department. Many times, the teacher likes to take her students to places that aren't easily accessible by car.
Technology provides a solution for virtual field trips. Students can see the artifacts in the museum, visit the whale tank, and enjoy sweet art while sitting with their classmates in the classroom.
Zaid says that doing a virtual field trip is a great way to remember a specific trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, the students from Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year for their trip to the state capital, and they redesign this website every year, but they keep the old versions online so it's like a registration.
Furthermore, blogs are predicted to collaborate in improving the students' skills. While students are usually starting their experience with blogs with incorrect grammatical and spelling rules, having an audience who provide feedback in general is beneficial.
Since students are usually the most criticized audience, anyone who writes on the blog starts trying to improve their writing so they won't be criticized.
Blogs help students to become smarter about their entourage. The key is to capture the audience's attention and inspire students to be skillful and useful (Toto, 2004).
Documentation is a vital tool for collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can "enable students to become more capable of analysis and critique; and through effectively responding to what exists online, students can define their positions regarding what others write, adding to their ability to form their own opinions on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada, where two languages are spoken and there are numerous art exhibitions and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Niagara Falls, we find them in the far south, and in the north we find the beautiful Nature House, which isn't exploited in Meskoka and what follows it.
All these things and more highlight Ontario as what people abroad call the "Canadian thing."
The large areas in the north are regions with a relatively small population, and some of them are almost uninhabited.
To put things in perspective, the number of African American residents in the United States is greater than the number of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa in the Indian Ocean are a gateway to the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island of all, and it is an independent continent, especially concerning wildlife.
Most of the small islands are independent countries, or affiliated with France, and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
The Arabs spread Islam to the country and propagated it widely in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century, and the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
From the north, the African coast borders the region, and the Atlantic Ocean borders it from the south and west.
Regardless of their marital status, women who are traveling must announce that they are married.
A wedding ring is useful, but not one that causes me trouble.
You must understand women that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that they are used to being followed and grabbed by the arm, and change.
Be strong in the face of men's pressures, and don't be afraid to stick to your guns (don't let cultural differences be something accepted!).
The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinids used the new city of Casablanca as a strategic port, called "Anfa," after its founding on the Berber sailors' road in the 10th century BC.
The Portuguese destroyed it, then rebuilt it and called it "Casa Branca" to escape it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city in the name of his tribe, and the Spanish merchants established Casablanca, where they set up commercial bases.
Casablanca is considered one of the least-shopped places in Morocco.
It's easy to find places for Moroccan traditional goods vendors all over the old city, like tagines, pottery, leather goods, shisha pipes, and all kinds of cheap merchandise, but it's all catered to tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, located in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In the year 2002, the lava from the Nisyros volcano destroyed Ghoma, and the ash covered most of the city's streets, especially the downtown area.
Any visit outside of "Gouga" requires you to go through security checks to understand the ongoing state of war in the "Kifou" district, while "Gouga" is reasonably safe.
The city is considered a base for viewing the sunrise over Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest ways to follow the mountain gorillas in Africa.
You can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to explore the city of Goma, and the usual fare (locally) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Unlike how it used to be difficult to get to, "Timbuktu" is now used when they talk about distant, foreign lands.
The city of Timbuktu is called a poor city, despite the fact that its reputation has made it a tourist attraction, and they even added an airport there.
In 1990, they added it to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, because of the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main episodes for Henry Lewis Gates on his PBS series "Africa's Wonders."
The city strongly contrasts with the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab character than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The area of the park is 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different ecological zones, each with its own wildlife.
It is called one of the attractive places in South Africa, and its park is also called one of the main national parks in South Africa (South African National Parks).
There are daily patrols to preserve the park and to enter it, like all national parks in South Africa.
It might be useful to get a Wild Card, as it gives you access to a selection of South African theme parks and all of South Africa's national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the territory of Hong Kong its name, and it's the place considered a destination for many tourists.
The neatly dressed girls who photograph the Hong Kong skyline resemble a dazzling graph floating above the wet waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and walk to the North Point Waterfront on the opposite side.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban development is densely concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place the British colonizers made, like their own place, so if you're looking for evidence of the region's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
Sundarbans is considered the largest mangrove belt in the world, extending for 80 kilometers (50 miles) along the remote coastlines of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest area located in India is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just swamps for mangrove trees; they contain a bit of the last remaining evidence of the dense thickets that covered the Ganges River plain in days gone by.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 square kilometers, nearly a third of which is covered by water/swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a wildlife reserve, and estimates say there are around 400 Royal Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
The roosters come out of the internal station between the regions (crossing the river) in the middle of the day, even though most of them, especially the livestock in the east and Jakar/Boumathang, come out between 6:30 and 7:30.
Because of the football matches between neighborhoods, they are often crowded. It's advisable to book your tickets in advance, days before.
Most areas are served by small Japanese "Kiran Koster" vehicles, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and comfortable way to get around for nearby places, like Nu 150 and Bounakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the city of Oyapock in Brazil and Saint Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The height of the tower is 83 meters, its length is 378 meters, and it has two tracks, each with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The works were completed in August 2011, and it was opened to traffic in March 2017.
It is planned that the bridge will start operating its full capacity in September 2017, at the same time as the completion of the Brazilian customs points is expected.
The Guarani were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is known today as Eastern Paraguay. The Guarani lived on a semi-nomadic hunting and gathering lifestyle, and cultivated just enough for subsistence.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups like the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting animals, gathering plants, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay emerged, which was previously known as the "Giant Province of the Spice Islands" as a result of the conflict between Spanish colonizers and indigenous groups.
The Spanish colonial period lasted for three centuries.
Although Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest competitions of the year take place in December, at the Tarat Polo in Las Canitas.
You can also enjoy watching smaller tournaments and matches here at other times of the year.
To get news about tournaments and places to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is valued similarly to the British Pound (GBP).
They say you can exchange money at the only bank in the islands, located in Stanley, on the other side of the FIC West shop.
The British pound is generally accepted anywhere in the islands, and Stanley credit cards, and the US dollar is accepted most of the time.
In remote islands, there's a chance they won't accept credit cards, even though they might accept British and American currency; check with the locals beforehand to know how to pay.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, that's why you need to exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, the summer will be like winter in the northern hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical region; and it's normal for temperatures to exceed 30 degrees Celsius during the summer months.
It can be very cold in winter: it doesn't take much for temperatures to drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make the weather colder than the thermometer shows.
The amount of rain remains fairly constant throughout the year, and there aren't clearly defined "rainy" and "dry" seasons.
Even though many animals in the garden are used to seeing people, wildlife is still wild and you shouldn't feed them or bother them.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from baboons and hyenas, and 25 meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, wild boars, moose, bears, and almost all other large animals can be attacked.
Dozens of visitors get hurt every year because they don't leave a safe distance. These animals are big, wild, and considered dangerous, and that's why it's necessary to give them their own space.
In addition to this, be careful because smells attract bears and other wild animals, so don't hang food around and don't cook smelly food, and maintain the cleanliness of the campsite.
The city of Apia is the capital of Samoa, and this city is located on the island of Apolo, with a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1950s and served as the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
The Strait of Beaufort was a place of failed naval confrontations in 1889 when seven battleships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the Strait.
All the ships sank except for one British torpedo boat. Approximately 200 American and German people drowned.
In the struggle organized by the Maoist movement for independence, a peaceful gathering in the town resulted in the killing of the supreme leader Toubbi Tamesis Liloufi the Third.
Because of Oakland being between two toilets, there aren't many beaches; the most popular ones are located in three places.
North Shore stretches (in the North Harbor area) along the Pacific Ocean, extending from Long Beach in the north to Redondo Beach in the south.
The shores are mostly sandy, and the waters are safe, with most of them still having bougainvillea trees along the coast.
The roads of Tamaki are located on Brette and Yatimata, in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers, in the heart of Auckland.
These family quarters can get crowded at times, and they have a nice collection of shops lined up along the shore. The sea is calm.
The basic popular beer is known as "Numrowahed" (Number One), it's not a mixed drink, but a drink that gets you high and relaxes you. And the other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many kinds of French drinks, but the New Zealand and Australian drinks are better.
Tap water is drinkable, but it's easy to find bottled water if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is strange. A small black coffee is an "espresso," while cappuccino on top is just cream, not foam, and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The juices made from grapes are excellent, even though they are expensive.
Many diving trips to the coral reefs take place throughout the year, and the coral reefs are rarely damaged for any of these reasons.
Nevertheless, seek advice from the authorities, follow all signs, and be careful with the safety warnings.
