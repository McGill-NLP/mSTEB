This not only confirms that some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but provides more details than fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the plumage of this animal was brown-chestnut on the upper part, with a pale or carotenoid coloration on the lower part.
The discovery also allows for obtaining detailed information regarding the evolution of bird feathers.
Since the dinosaur's plumage does not possess the basic structure, the so-called rachis, but instead has other characteristics typical of feathers, barbs, and barbules, researchers have concluded that the rachis is likely the result of a later evolutionary development of these characteristics.
The structure of the plumage suggests it wasn't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or courtship. Researchers hypothesize that, despite being the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen exhibits adult plumage rather than downy chick feathers.
According to the researchers' hypotheses, despite the tail belonging to a young dinosaur, the specimen reveals adult plumage and not that of a chick.

Brightness is used together with rotation to define the Rossby number of a star, which is linked to the plasma flow.
The lower the Rossby number, the weaker the star's activity compared to magnetic inversions.

The work carried out was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate the surveys conducted of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team was to be triggered by tidal forces between the dark matter of this galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a gravitational force on the Earth that generates the tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the galaxy of the Sagittarius.
Scientists have been able to deduce that the effects of dark matter on other dark matter are the same effects as those of "normal" matter.
This theory suggests that much of the dark matter around a galaxy is gathered in a sort of halo, formed by a multitude of small particles.

Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona, stated: "Their thermal behavior is not as constant as that of large terrestrial caves, which often maintain a relatively stable temperature, but it is consistent with them being deep holes in the ground."
In France, voting is traditionally a low-tech experience: voters enter an isolated booth and place a pre-printed ballot in an envelope indicating their chosen candidate.
After the verification of his identity by the officials, the voter deposits the ballot in the ballot box and signs the electoral register.

Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent, so that voters and observers can witness that at the start of the voting, no envelopes are present and that no other envelopes are inserted besides those of the voters, duly counted and authorized.
Candidates may send their representatives to assist at every stage of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, in accordance with specific procedures.

Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is expected to take over the role of Minister for Business left vacant by Davey.
The appearance of Huhne and Pryce at Westminster Magistrates' Court is scheduled for February 16th.
The victims were Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and the driver, Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old.
Edgar Veguilla sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Kristoffer Schneider will require facial reconstructive surgery.
Uka's weapon didn't explode when pointed at a fifth man's head. Schneider suffers constant pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a section of his skull, and his face has been rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified via video conference from a US Air Force base in his country.
In addition to Wednesday's event, Carpanedo participated in two individual races at the Championships.
She was first in the slalom, where she recorded a DNS (Did Not Start) on the first run. Another 36 competitors out of 116 in the same race did not finish the event.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, saw her finish tenth in the women's seated category, with a combined time of 4:41.30, slower by 2:11.60 minutes than the first-place finisher, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and slower by 1:09.02 minutes than the ninth-place Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers in the women's group were unable to finish their runs, and 45 of the 117 participants in the Giant Slalom did not place in the race.
The Madhya Pradesh police have managed to recover the laptop and cell phone that had been stolen.
Deputy Inspector General DK Arya announced: "Five people have been arrested for the rape of the Swiss woman. We have also recovered her cell phone and laptop."
The names of the defendants are: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
According to Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
None of the three people who were in the house at the time of the car crash were injured.
Nevertheless, the driver was seriously injured in the head.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
From that moment on, Adekoya is at Edinburgh Sheriff Court accused of killing his own son.
She is being held pending trial and indictment, but any testimony given by a witness may be tainted, as her image has been widely published.
This is a common practice in other parts of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice has different parameters. Scottish courts have in fact ruled that the publication of the photos is potentially prejudicial.
According to Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee, "journalists who publish photos or other material of suspected individuals are walking on a minefield."
The Crown Office, which has overall responsibility for judicial proceedings, has stated to journalists that no new comments will be released at least until the formal act of indictment.
According to reports, the subject of the document will be the border dispute, which Palestine wants to be based on the existing borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to what is said, other topics addressed include the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Once the agreement is signed, Israel demands a constant military presence in the valley, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to abandon this presence for only five years.
The shooters within the experimental program for the control of harmful animals had to be carefully monitored by the rangers, since the experiment was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
Within the framework of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, the NPWS, in collaboration with the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., has recruited qualified volunteers.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director of Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four marksmen selected for the initial shooting operation received exhaustive training and safety instructions.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in to a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) composed of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth provisional electoral council in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission proposed a package of measures aimed at pushing the country towards new elections, including the resignation of the previous CEP.
The commission formulated Martelly's response to the widespread protests, which began in October, that contest the regime.
Occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failure to hold elections, some of which were scheduled as far back as 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of malfunctioning iPod overheating have been reported, resulting in a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 incidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Industry (METI) announced that it had been informed by Apple of 34 further incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious."
In its response, the ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "absolutely deplorable."
The earthquake tremor in the Marianas was felt at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
According to the emergency management office of the Northern Mariana Islands, no damage has been reported in the nation.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center reported that there were no tsunami signals in effect.
In Manila, the capital of the Philippines, a former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus.
With his M16 rifle, Rolando Mendoza opened fire on the tourists.
Many of the hostages have been saved, at least six have died.
Seventeen hostages, including children and the elderly, were immediately released along with the Filipino photographers.
Photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was fatally shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and pursued a career in medicine.
After completing her midwifery training, she began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his free time Liggins began to study cases of premature labor.
Her research showed that the administration of a hormone would accelerate the maturation of the lungs in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black boxes" containing flight recordings on Wednesday.
Even her wrestling colleagues wanted to pay tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first Queen of the Extreme. My first manager. She died on the night of the two moons. Unique, just like her. A strong woman."
"Luna was quirky like me… Maybe even more so… I care about her and I'll miss her… Let's hope she's in a better place," Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented.
According to a survey conducted on 1,400 people before the 2010 federal elections, those opposed to Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
During the campaign for the 2010 federal elections, the interim prime minister, Julia Gillard, stated that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
This opinion is shared by 34% of the survey participants, who believe Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Contrary to the survey, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% think it should never become one.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but she suffered several ailments that led to doubts about her physical condition.
He wasn't able to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because they are banned from the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest prime number ever known to date.
The discovery was verified by several people through the use of various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been one of the sources that brought water and organic matter to Earth, that is, the material capable of forming proteins and supporting life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, and in particular how Earth formed, having collided with comets a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, has been in office since the beginning of this year as governor; last month he signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
According to him, speculation is nothing more than "political chatter and nonsense."
A candidacy for the presidency in 2016 is being speculated.
According to the FAA, the NextGen system would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel annually, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
The system uses satellite technology instead of outdated ground-based radar, allowing air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation is being arranged, and local trains will not stop at Wembley, while there is no parking available for cars or park-and-ride facilities on site.
The concerns regarding the absence of transportation have brought to light the possibility of holding the match behind closed doors, without the support of the team's fans.
According to a study published Thursday in the journal Science, a new species of bird would have originated in the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
According to researchers at the University of Princeton, United States, and the University of Uppsala, Sweden, the new species evolved in just two generations, although it was thought that much more time would be needed for this process; this is due to the interbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the immigrant cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled to create minuscule forms.
It can be drawn into a thin thread, suitable for twisting and braiding. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and adhered to other metals. It was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images in books called "illuminated manuscripts" precisely because of its ability to be made so thin.
This concerns the so-called pH of the substance. Using red cabbage juice, it is possible to create a pH indicator.
The juice of the red cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical element is.
The pH level of the analyzed chemical substance is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions present (the H in pH).
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms are made up of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dried powders together and then, with clean and damp hands, roll them into a ball.
Between the humidity present on your hands and the outer layers, a reaction will be triggered that will cause a strange sensation and form a sort of shell.
Almost all the houses in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a bathroom with running water connected to an advanced sewage system.
In Greece, remains of sewage systems have been discovered in the dwellings of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets existed in antiquity in Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, they were sometimes incorporated into public baths, frequented by a mixed audience of men and women.
To call someone far away, thousands of miles away, a satellite is used.
The satellite in space receives the signal and then sends it back almost instantaneously.
The satellite launch into space was carried out with a rocket. Scientists rely on space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere partially distorts the light and the view.
To transport a satellite or telescope into space, a rocket taller than 100 feet is necessary.
The wheel has enormously changed the world. Among the various advantages it has offered us, the most important is that it has provided us with simpler and faster transportation.
Thanks to his invention, the train, the automobile, and several other means of transportation appeared.
Below them are other medium-sized felines that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including free-ranging domestic cats) that feed on small prey, notably more numerous, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The concept of a niche is the secret to their success, a particular goal that each feline has and that allows it to avoid competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
The packs are composed of adult males, usually 2 or 3 related to each other, and a number of females and pups that can reach 30.
Females are usually closely related to each other, being a large family of daughters and sisters.
The pride of lions acts in a way very similar to a pack of wolves or dogs, whose behavior is in fact surprisingly similar to that of lions (but not to other large cats), also regarding mortal attacks on their prey.
A complete athlete: the tiger is able to climb (although not very well), swim, make very long jumps, and exert a pulling force five times greater than that of a strong man.
The tiger belongs to the same family (the genus Panthera) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four felines are the only ones that roar.
The tiger's roar isn't as powerful as the lion's, but it's more like a phrase of shouted, angry words.
Ocelots love to feed on small animals. If possible, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds, and almost all of their prey are much smaller than they are.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find their prey (animals to eat) thanks to their sense of smell, sniffing the ground where they have been.
Thanks to their night vision, they are able to see very well in the dark, as well as move stealthily. To hunt their prey, ocelots camouflage themselves with their surroundings before pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population to which it belongs (for example, if it moves beyond a mountain range or a river, or moves to a new island, thus making a possible return difficult), it will likely find itself in an environment different from the one it was in before.
This new environment is characterized by diverse resources and competitors, therefore, to position itself as a strong competitor, the new population will need characteristics or transformations different from those previously required.
The original population hasn't changed at all; it continues to need the same adaptations as before.
As time goes by and the new population adapts to its new environment, it increasingly resembles the other population less and less.
At some point, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different from each other that they will no longer be able to be defined as belonging to the same species.
This process, which consists of the formation of new species, is called speciation. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a fundamental element of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that is breathed by humans and absorb the carbon dioxide exhaled by the same (through respiration).
Plants produce their own nourishment with the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses starting from plants and produce clothes with plants. A large part of the food we eat is made from plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time and, for this reason, feared nothing, except for other mosasaurs.
More than 70 razor-sharp teeth protruded from its long jaws, plus an additional row situated on the palate, so there was no escape for anyone who crossed its path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible it had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's also possible that it was a cannibal.
He would even attack anything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like the T-Rex couldn't have competed with him.
Although much of their food would seem familiar to us, Roman banquets also included several strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a dormouse.
Another difference was that while the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, the wealthy men enjoyed feasting together lying on their sides while consuming their meal.
Naturally, the meals of the ancient Romans did not include various foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia centuries later.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cacao, and none of the ancient Romans had ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each deity, which was considered the dwelling place of the god.
People made sacrifices to the gods, and the priests sought to provide for the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then an inner sanctuary accessible only to the priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built and became part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a sanctuary dedicated to the god.
Thanks to the mild climate that characterizes the Middle East, the house wasn't of fundamental importance.
Much of Jewish family life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard, while the shops were simple outdoor stalls facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Canaan there were no large forests, so wood was particularly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Nordic sagas recount that Erik the Red gave it its name, having encountered Greenland on his journey after being exiled from Iceland for murder.
But, regardless of their discovery, Inuit tribes were already living there at that time.
Even though they are all "Scandinavian" countries, the people, monarchs, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland had very different characteristics.
If you've seen the movie "The Mystery of the Templars," you might think that a treasure map is drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is false. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text appears upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence the large parchment document (measuring 29.75 inches by 24.5 inches) was rolled up for storage.
Probably, therefore, the annotation was added only as a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had led to the liberation of northern France, but the south was still occupied.
It was governed by the Vichy regime, that is, by those French people who in 1940 had made peace with the Germans and had allied themselves with the invaders, instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded southern France: this offensive action was named "Operation Dragoon".
American and Free French forces had liberated the south of France in just two weeks and were heading towards Germany.
By civilization, we mean a specific culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work collaboratively, forming a society.
The word "civilization" derives from the Latin "civilis," which means civil; the term is in turn linked to "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and in a certain way thus defines the dimensions of society as well.
City-states were the first entities to anticipate the idea of nationhood. The culture of a civilization means transmitting knowledge across generations, leaving an indelible cultural imprint through equitable dissemination.
Minor cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces, and are therefore not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states formed a weak central government for the first time, and the Congress was its only component, according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and given the absence of an executive or judicial power at the national level, it relied on the state authorities, often uncooperative, to enforce its acts.
He didn't even have the authority to bypass fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
To amend the articles, the unanimous consent of all states was required. These states, for their part, had so little regard for the central government that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is, along with the German team, the second most successful football team in the world and won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports there are: football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more widespread in the northern regions and see Italians competing in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan is made up of almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the seventh largest archipelago in the world!
From a geographical point of view, Japan is referred to as an "archipelago," considering the presence of groups of islands that make it up.
Taiwan emerged in the 15th century when European sailors passing by recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwestern part of Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation that affected the indigenous people's cereal production systems and employing Chinese laborers to work in its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan came under the control of the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912); in 1885, Taiwan was declared a province of the Qing Empire.
After being defeated in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, thereby ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan; the island remained under Japanese government until 1945.
Machu Picchu comprises three primary structures, notably the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Much of the peripheral buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of their original appearance.
In 1976, 30% of Machu Picchu had been excavated, but restoration work is still ongoing.
The most common format in the world for still photography, for example, is 35mm, the same as the film most used at the end of the analog photography era.
It is still produced today, and more importantly, its aspect ratio is inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strangely, the height of the 35 mm format is 24 mm and its width is 36 mm.
The proportions of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of integers) are therefore considered 3:2.
The proportions of many of the formats created (for example, the APS format family) are equal to or very close to this value.
The often-exploited and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while simultaneously maintaining a sense of order within an image.
According to this rule, the most effective point to position the main subject corresponds to the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (as in the example).
In this phase of European history, the Catholic Church, having become rich and powerful, found itself under scrutiny.
Christian religion had acted as a binding force between European states for over a thousand years, despite linguistic and cultural differences.
His omnipresent power has influenced everyone, from the king to ordinary citizens.
One of the foundations of Christianity is that wealth should serve to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's monetary reserves exist precisely for this reason.
The central authority of the church remained in Rome for over a thousand years, and this convergence of power and money has led many to question whether this principle was upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Great Britain decided to implement a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective: it involved interrupting any essential military and civilian supply, despite this blockade violating international law, which is typically accepted and codified in numerous international treaties of the last two centuries.
Great Britain undermined international waters to prevent any vessel from accessing entire sections of the ocean, also endangering neutral ships.
Since this tactic had elicited a limited response, Germany expected a reaction similar to its indiscriminate submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among much of the citizenry and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wished to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla accepted a job offer from the Edison Company in New York City, which led him to move to the United States of America.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation written by Charles Batchelor (his supervisor from his previous job) and addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, different periods of time were indicated in a very unique way: each period of China or each family that was in power constituted a specific dynasty.
Even the intervals between the individual dynasties were characterized by periods of instability and division among the provinces. The most well-known was the so-called Three Kingdoms period, between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty, which lasted for 60 years.
In these periods, fierce wars broke out among many nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the most violent eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting to secure a place of honor in the imposing palace of Xi'an.
The social and political effects are numerous; among these, we can cite the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republic, nationalism, and the belief that the nation belongs to the people and is not the property of a single sovereign.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, professions were open to all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and fortunate to succeed.
The same applies to the military, since the army rankings, instead of being based on class, now are based on caliber.
The French Revolution was also a source of inspiration for many other oppressed workers in various countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad had a deep interest in matters that go beyond earthly life. He was accustomed to going to a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "noor" (light) to meditate.
The cave, which has survived the passage of time, offers in itself a very clear image of Muhammad's spirituality.
The cave sits on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if one knew of its existence. Once inside the cave, the isolation is total.
You see nothing but a wonderful clear sky and a large number of mountains all around. From inside the cave, you can see or hear very little of the surrounding world.
Of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one to have survived in a relatively good state today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the largest pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, is home to numerous pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Giza), various smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The important pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The indication "arcata in su" resembles a V, and the indication "arcata in giù" resembles a paperclip or a square without the bottom side.
Towards the top means you should start from the tip and pull back the bow, and towards the bottom means you should start from the grip (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow towards yourself.
An ascending bow usually produces a softer sound, while a descending bow results in a louder and more decisive sound.
You can decide to add your personalized annotations in pencil, but please keep in mind that the markings of the rehearsal marks you find printed have a musical significance, so they should generally be respected.
On October 6, 1789, a crowd of market women forced King Louis XVI, gripped by terror, to leave Versailles and return to Paris, along with Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Maria Theresa, 11 years old, and Louis Charles, 4 years old), and Elizabeth, the king's sister.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and screaming threats against the rulers.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone in the crowd showed the terrified queen the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war expenses of U.S. imperialism, sustained to conquer the Philippines, were paid by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a large part of the expenses, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Clearly, the enormous profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the profits underpinning United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must know the context that led to the creation of this order.
The period in which the events took place is commonly called the High Middle Ages, the period of European history that covers the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (from the year 1000 to 1300 AD).
The Middle Ages are conventionally divided into the Early Middle Ages, the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages, with the Late Middle Ages concluding around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological innovation or technological imperative to the narrow sense according to which humanity's destiny is driven by an underlying logic, associated with scientific laws and their realization in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: the first is that the development of technology itself follows a path that goes far beyond political and cultural influence, and the second is that technology has "effects" on societies that are intrinsic, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, we can state that the automobile necessarily entails the development of the road network.
However, a national road network for only a few cars is not economically sustainable, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, and consequently to the invention of new rescue techniques for treating the injured.
Romanticism was characterized by a significant element of cultural determinism, drawn from authors such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the framework of Romanticism, geography conditioned individuals, and over time customs, traditions, and culture linked to this geography arose that, being in harmony with the context of society, proved more effective than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Similarly to Paris, known today as the world's contemporary fashion capital, Constantinople was the capital of fashion in feudal Europe.
Its fame as a nerve center of luxury began around 400 AD and continued roughly until 1100 AD.
During the 12th century, his prestige diminished, especially because the crusaders returned bringing gifts like silk and spices, which were worth more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of capital of fashion passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of the Gothic style was reached in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by the Byzantine culture of the East.
But the slowness of communication routes means that the spread of styles in the West could be delayed by 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments of the era, a result of the Crusades, was the introduction of buttons for fastening clothes.
Agriculture is defined as subsistence agriculture when it is practiced solely for the purpose of producing enough to satisfy the food needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple system, usually organic, that uses preserved seeds native to the local ecosystem in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques aimed at maximizing yields.
Historically, much of the farming population practiced subsistence agriculture, and in many developing countries it still is.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar opinions who don't feel represented by societal norms, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures distinguish themselves based on the age, ethnicity, social class, position, and/or sex of their members.
The characteristics that define what makes a subculture distinctive can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Often, members of a subculture indicate their affiliation through a peculiar and symbolic use of style, which includes fashion, manners, and slang.
One of the most commonly used methods to explain the importance of socialization is to analyze some unhappy cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, grew up without proper socialization with adults.
These children are called "feral" or wild. Some of them have been segregated by people (often their own parents): in some cases, the abandonment is motivated by the parents' rejection of a serious intellectual or physical disability.
Feral children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma prior to abandonment or escape.
Other children may have been raised by animals; still others appear to have lived alone in the wilderness.
When a feral child is raised entirely by non-human animals, they exhibit behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely analogous to those of the particular animal that cared for them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning itself simpler and more interesting, while scaffolding goes a bit further.
Scaffolding is not a mode of learning, but rather a support for those undertaking a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is an example of "scaffolding," but so is the little paperclip-shaped assistant in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are integrated into the software and aim to query, prompt, and explain procedures that the student may have had difficulty managing on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse, and even extortion.
A child should never grow up in an environment that doesn't guarantee them nourishment, care, and education, but unfortunately that happens.
We believe that foster care represents a safe area for these children.
Our foster care system should provide safe homes, loving foster parents, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
It is assumed that the trust will cover all unmet needs in the home from which they were taken.
The internet encompasses elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The characteristic elements of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and gratifications theory.
For example, as important motivations for using the Internet, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested (James et al., 1995).
The study by Eighmey and McCord (1998) on public reactions to websites identified two new aspects of motivation, namely "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships."
The use of video recording has allowed for significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, which are facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is argued that it is possible to discover if a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
In his essay "The President's Discourses," Oliver Sacks illustrated how people unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are nonetheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even claims that these skills in interpreting human behavior could be shared with animals, such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research demonstrated the existence of two pools of genetic variation, namely hidden variation and expressed variation.
With mutation, new genetic variability is added; through selection, it is eliminated from the pool of expressed variability.
Generation after generation, segregation and recombination redistribute variation back and forth between the two pools.
For a primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans, it is difficult to satisfy its amino acid needs with the plant resources available in the savanna.
Furthermore, the failure to carry out these activities has serious consequences: slowed growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, even death.
The plant resources most easily accessible would have been the proteins present in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us, unless they are cooked.
Animal foods, on the other hand (like ants, termites, eggs), are not only easy to digest, but they provide a high amount of protein, containing all the essential amino acids.
In light of all this, it shouldn't be surprising that our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a certain sense, just as savanna chimpanzees do today.
Sleep interruption is the process of intentional awakening that occurs during normal sleep, followed by a return to sleep (10–60 minutes later).
This process can be easily implemented using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to a state of consciousness, without fully waking you up.
If you should decide to reset the clock while you're asleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you'll be forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other rhythm-focused options include consuming plenty of fluids before bed (especially water or tea, known for its diuretic properties), which forces you to get up from bed to urinate.
A person enjoys inner peace that is proportionally opposite to the tension present in their body and spirit.
The less tension there is, the more positive the existing life force is. Each of us has the potential ability to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. This goal is only hindered by our tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been enriched by the path of love of the Mahayana ritual and various techniques of Indian yoga.
Generally speaking, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It is founded on Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of all-encompassing love.
Kundalini Yoga activates the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through the use of yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Deity Yoga is the core of Tibetan meditation. Through the depiction of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and the consciousness of enlightenment is developed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, leading to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. With the end of the war, systemic, procedural, and cultural conflicts caused a rift between the two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies; thus, the Cold War began.
It would have lasted for the next 40 years and would have been fought for real, by mercenary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other countries.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already been broken; the only option was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
These plans, however, quickly proved obsolete when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army advanced and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish non-aggression pact, and other international, bilateral, and multilateral treaties.
Using ships for the transport of goods is certainly the most efficient way to move large volumes of people and goods across the oceans.
From time immemorial, the task of navies has been to guarantee the country's safeguarding of its ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously countering the same ability of the enemy to move their people and their goods.
One of the most recent and noteworthy examples supporting this theory is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. During the battle, the Americans were trying to move men and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to support Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, primarily using submarines, attempted to disrupt this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't succeeded, Germany would likely have had the opportunity to conquer Great Britain, just as it had done in the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
They began to be domesticated by ancient cultures and tribes to easily have milk, fleece, meat, and skin available.
Domestic goats were typically raised in herds left free to roam the hills or other grazing areas, often tended by goat herders (similar to shepherds) who were frequently children or adolescents. These herding methods are still used today.
Already in the 16th century in England, wagonways were built.
Despite being simply formed by parallel wooden planks, wagonways, when compared to the slightly rougher roads of the period, allowed the horses that used them to reach greater speeds and move heavier loads.
Sleepers were introduced relatively early to hold the rails in place. Gradually, however, it became clear that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron bar on top.
It became a common practice, although iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels gave way to iron ones. In 1767, the first completely iron rails appeared.
The first means of transportation that humans encountered were their own legs. Humans began walking upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
His predecessor, the australopithecus, did not habitually walk upright.
Signs of bipedal specialization are present in Australopithecus fossils dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although it is possible that Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
To try and lessen future suffering to some extent, we can start adopting more environmentally friendly lifestyles, we can join the environmentalist movement, and we can also engage in activism.
In many cases, this only works as a symptomatic treatment. If, however, we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and disable it.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, while problems have increased because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After the Congress adopted it on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was then sent to John Dunlap's printing house a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, now known as "Dunlap's Manifestos".
The document was read aloud for the first time on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall, and the task was entrusted to John Nixon.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read to his troops stationed in New York on July 9th, while a copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 strokes of Dunlap still known are the oldest existing copies of the document. The original manuscript is lost.
According to many paleontologists today, one category of dinosaurs survived and is still alive. These are what we call birds.
Many tend not to consider them dinosaurs due to their feathers and ability to fly.
Yet birds have many characteristics that unite them to dinosaurs.
Like the T-Rex, they have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two back legs.
Ultimately, the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers is at the basis of all computers currently used.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and in technical computer language these numbers are called binary digits or bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Its symptoms, including vomiting, are very general, making an immediate diagnosis impossible.
The main indication of internal poisoning could be the presence in the home of an open container of medication or harmful chemicals.
Check if the label contains first aid instructions relevant to that specific poison.
The term acari (mites and ticks) is used formally by entomologists for this group of insects.
The term comes from the ancient familiarity with bed bugs, insects that have strongly adapted to becoming human parasites.
Both Asian longhorned beetles and bed bugs are nidicolous, meaning they are adapted to live in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, multiple sclerosis (MS) accounts for approximately 400,000 known cases, ranking first among neurological diseases affecting young people and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a condition that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has shown that the probability of developing MS in females is double that of males.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their best interest, or in their child's best interest.
These couples have the opportunity to choose an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method effectively guides most scientific inquiry.
But it's not just about experimentation, since an experiment is a test used to exclude one or more of the possible hypotheses; posing questions and making observations also allows you to guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly on the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on various subjects of knowledge, including psychology, were accepted.
With the progressive decline of the Greek language, the West was isolated from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many have observed that physiological rhythms and behavior depend decisively on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms have been documented, which are not merely reactions to external periodic signals, in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators, whose free cycle continues for a period of time even in the absence of external stimuli.
One of the first experiments to suggest that DNA was the genetic material was the one conducted by Hershey and Chase.
Hershey and Chase used bacteriophages, that is viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They carried out two experiments highlighting the DNA of the bacteriophage with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a range of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the relevance of the genetic material involved, and whether the cells affected belong to the germline.
Only mutations transmitted to children occur at the germ cell level; mutations that occur elsewhere can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including flora and wildlife.
Among the examples of activities to do on site are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and studying information regarding the ecosystem.
For example, by visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small countryside towns by car to go to work, crossing paths with other people whose workplace is the place they just left.
In this dynamic give-and-take, everyone is in some way connected to a transportation system based on private cars, which they support at the same time.
Today science reveals that this massive carbon-based economy has forced the biosphere outside of one of its conditions of stability that has allowed human evolution over the last two million years.
Every person participates in social life and uses transportation systems, about which almost everyone complains.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear complaints of similar levels regarding water quality or bridges falling into disrepair.
Why do transportation systems attract so many complaints, why are they rejected every day? Are the engineers who design them incompetent, or are there deeper reasons?
"Traffic Flow" (or "traffic flow") is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles from one point to another and the interactions they generate with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow studies are complex because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, driver behavior tends to fall within a reasonably consistent range, and therefore, traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be represented generically mathematically.
To obtain a more accurate representation of traffic flow, the three main variables have been correlated: (1) volume, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These studies are useful for planning, designing, and managing road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. The ability to fly allowed them to more easily evade predators and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects benefit from the ability to fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to take advantage of a greater variety of small hiding places to hide from predators.
Among all the insects that exist today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only ones that are unable to fold their wings.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
For some people he was right, but many others believed the opposite, namely that the solar system, including the Sun itself (and also the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
Which seems sensible, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the largest and second-longest river in the world. It carries an amount of water equal to 8 times that of the second largest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river on Earth, with a width that reaches up to six miles in some places.
The Amazon River accounts for 20% of the total water discharged into the planet's oceans from all the world's rivers.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. Thousands of smaller tributaries flow into it.
Stone pyramids continued to be built until the end of the Old Kingdom, but despite this, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were enchanted admiring the monuments of their ancestors, which at that time were more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City consists of approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the one with the smallest population.
The language of Vatican City for legislation and official communications is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language spoken by most people working within the State, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
In Vatican City, all citizens are Roman Catholics.
Man began to learn about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper already in antiquity: these elements can be found in nature in their native form and can be extracted in a fairly simple way with the help of primitive tools.
According to the philosopher Aristotle, everything is composed of a combination of one or more of the following four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
These indeed resemble the four states of matter, namely (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. However, he also theorized that they transformed into new substances, forming what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There can also be alloys composed of minimal amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
In the universe, everything is made of matter, and all matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly tiny, so small that trillions of them could fit into the space at the end of this sentence.
After its invention, the pencil thus proved to be a good friend to many.
Unfortunately, with the introduction of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lower status and is used less and less frequently.
Today everyone writes messages on computer screens and never needs to get near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what fate the keyboard will have when something newer arrives.
The principle that energy is required to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons is the basis of how a fission bomb works.
Basically, it's like rolling a heavy cart up a hill. So, by further dividing the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart in the presence of little or no force.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust, and its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust has a thickness of approximately 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under mountainous areas.
I am Maria, and they might be more numerous on the near side because the crust is thinner. This facilitated the ascent of lava to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding what satisfies or attracts individuals.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they become adults.
These theories analyze what unites certain people and motivates them to do what they do, and what contextual factors in which they live push them to do or not do certain things.
Among the most widespread content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, when managers start directing their former colleagues, two behaviors may emerge. On the one hand, there are those who try to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
The manager of this type finds it difficult to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary actions, evaluate performance, and define and assign responsibilities.
On the other extreme, the manager transforms into a completely different person, feeling the need to change the entire team's work and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the person who is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This attitude often generates disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
The standard of excellence for virtual teams is similar to that of conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Members of the virtual team often serve as a point of contact for their next physical group.
They often have greater autonomy compared to members of conventional teams, as meetings can occur depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by local management.
The existence of a veritable "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a fundamental element of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is defined as the management team to which each member refers and which sets the standards for each member.
Why should an organization have the will to undertake the long process that leads to the construction of a learning organization? A good reason to implement organizational learning concepts can be innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, a collaborative process within an organization to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process to meet customer needs.
For an organization to be considered innovative, it is necessary for leaders to create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) illustrates the continuum theory as a method employed to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological findings have demonstrated the physical existence of a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. The research area is becoming more focused and therefore much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior is at the basis of scientists' research.
It has long been known that certain types of brain damage, trauma, injuries, and tumors can affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The introduction of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never observed before.
This offers us a large amount of information and material to create simulation models that help us understand our mental processes.
Despite having a strong science fiction connotation, AI represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
Research on AI includes the development of machines to automate operations that require intelligent behavior.
Some examples of application include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become distinct disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is today often used in economic, medical, engineering, and military fields, as well as being integrated into various software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips represent a fundamental part of teaching. Often, teachers would like to take their students to places that are not reachable by bus.
The solution is offered by technology with virtual field trips. Students can see museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual school trip is also an excellent opportunity to share travel experiences and reflections with future classes.
For example, every year students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the capital; the website is redesigned each year, but previous versions are kept online and become an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Often, in fact, their first experiences with blogs are characterized by poor grammar and spelling, but generally the presence of an audience changes things.
Since students are usually the most critical audience, the blog author strives to improve their writing to avoid negative judgments.
Blogs also "force students to become more aware of the moment around them." The need to cultivate public interest motivates students to be ingenious and interesting (Toto, 2004).
The blog is a tool that aims to encourage collaboration and develop students' learning far beyond the normal school day.
The correct use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical. By actively responding to online materials, students can define their own position within the writings of others, as well as outline their own perspectives on specific issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the picturesque and bilingual capital of Canada, rich in art galleries and museums that tell the country's past and present.
Further south are Niagara Falls, and to the north you can admire the natural and unspoiled beauty of the Muskoka region and much more.
All of this and more makes Ontario typically Canadian according to foreigners' opinions.
The vast areas further north are sparsely populated; among these, some are wild lands almost uninhabited.
If one compares the populations, the result may be surprising to many: in the United States, the number of African American citizens is higher than that of Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and its natural heritage makes it a continent unto itself.
Almost all of the smaller islands, known as luxurious beach resorts, are largely independent nations or associated with France.
To the lands, the Arabs also brought Islam, which embarked on a long journey towards the Comoros and Mayotte.
In the 15th century, the discovery of the sea route to India, by the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama, opened the way for European influence and colonialism.
To the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel, while to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
For female travelers: all are advised to declare that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
It's important for women to realize that cultural differences can lead to what they consider harassment, and that it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Have the firmness to reject men, and do not be afraid to oppose them (cultural differences or not, there is no justification!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC; named Anfa, it was a strategically important port used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenides.
The Portuguese destroyed it to rebuild it as the White House, which they abandoned in 1755 following an earthquake.
The Moroccan sultan rebuilt the city called Daru l-Badya, later named Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who chose these locations for their commercial bases.
Throughout Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting cities for shopping.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and lots of trinkets, but all of this is reserved only for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city located in the easternmost part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed Goma, burying much of the city's roads, especially those in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, it's advisable to do thorough research before making any trips outside of Goma, in order to properly assess the state of the ongoing clashes in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for the climb to Mount Nyiragongo, in addition to being one of the most affordable opportunities to see mountain gorillas in Africa.
It's possible to use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The normal price (in local currency) is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Even as a consequence of its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has come to end up as a metaphor for exotic and faraway lands.
Today Timbuktu is a decaying city, but due to its reputation it remains a tourist attraction, also equipped with an airport.
In 1990, it was inscribed on the UNESCO List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat posed by desert sands.
It was one of the main stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World" ("Meraviglie del mondo africano").
With its more Arab than African touch, the city clearly distinguishes itself from the others in the country.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches eastward along the border with Mozambique. To the north, it borders Zimbabwe, and its southern border is represented by the Crocodile River.
With a surface area of 19,500 km², the park encompasses 14 distinct ecozones, each sustaining different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the most important of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, daily conservation and park entrance fees are required.
Even purchasing a Wild Card could be useful, as it allows access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island, which gives its name to the entire territory, represents the main destination for many tourists.
The series of buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glittering bar graph, made even more striking by being framed by the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To enjoy the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and visit Kowloon's waterfront across from it.
Most of the urban development on Hong Kong Island has concentrated on the reclaimed land along the densely populated northern coast.
This is the place that the English colonizers chose for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of this land, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest in the world. They extend for 80 km (50 mi) inland from the coast in Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans have been declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO. The part of the forest included in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not only made up of mangrove swamps: they also contain what remains of the imposing jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is made up of swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary; the area is estimated to have a population of 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although many (especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang) leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since service buses between different districts are often full, it will be wise to buy your ticket a few days in advance.
Most neighborhoods are served by comfortable and sturdy small Japanese buses.
Shared taxis are a convenient and fast way to reach nearby locations, including Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge that connects the city of Oiapoque, in Brazil, to Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock, in French Guiana.
Its two pylons are 83 meters high, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
Under the bridge, the vertical clearance is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the opening to traffic only occurred in March 2017.
In September 2017, when the Brazilian customs checkpoints are likely to be completed, the bridge should be fully operational.
The Guaraní were the most important indigenous group living in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters and also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was inhabited by other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycuru and Payaguá, who lived on hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Great Province of the Indies," came into being in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a period that lasted three centuries, the period of colonization.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has been able to maintain much of its indigenous identity and characteristics.
Everyone knows that Argentina boasts one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
In December, the most important tournament of the year takes place at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Here you can watch minor tournaments and matches at other times of the year as well.
To get information about tournaments and to purchase tickets for polo matches, you should contact the Argentine Polo Association.
The Falkland Islands have their own official currency, the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
The only bank on the islands, located in Stanley opposite the FIC West store, offers currency exchange services.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands. In Stanley, you can often also pay with credit cards and US dollars.
It's likely that credit cards are not accepted on the outer islands, although British and US currencies may be accepted. Check with the owners in advance to decide on an acceptable method of payment.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is situated in the subtropical region; during the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are quite normal.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity gives the sensation of a temperature lower than what the thermometer shows.
There aren't defined "dry" and "rainy" seasons: the amount of rain remains virtually constant throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park authorities recommend maintaining a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves and a distance of 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may seem: bison, elk, deer, bears, practically all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured for not maintaining a proper distance. It is necessary to leave these animals adequate space, as they are large, wild, and potentially dangerous animals.
Also keep in mind that smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking foods with strong odors, and try to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of the Samoa Islands. It is located on the island of Upolu and its population is just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded between 1850 and 1860 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In this port occurred the tristfully famous ship arrest of 1889, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, with the exception of a British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme chief.
There are many beaches, as Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are divided into three areas.
The beaches facing the Pacific Ocean of the North Shore (in the North Harbour district) stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
These are mainly sandy beaches, safe for swimming, and most of them enjoy the shade of pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive in Auckland Central, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers, overlook the Waitemata Harbour.
These are family-friendly beaches, sometimes a bit crowded, surrounded by a wide selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The most well-known local beer is a simple, pleasant, and refreshing beer called "Number One". The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can get many French wines, but the Australian and New Zealand ones might better withstand the journey.
The tap water here is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
According to Australians, the 'flat white' coffee originated from a foreign idea. An 'espresso' is a short, black coffee, a cappuccino is topped with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with Belgian hot chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but very good.
Throughout the year, many excursions are held on the coral reef, and injuries resulting from these excursions on the coral reef are rare.
Always ask authorities for advice, follow instructions, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear from October to April near beaches and river estuaries north of Seventeen Seventy. Outside of this period, they can only be found occasionally.
Sharks are present, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and tend to keep their distance.
The habitat of saltwater crocodiles is mainly composed of the river estuaries north of Rockhampton, as they do not actively live in the ocean.
By booking in advance, the traveler has the peace of mind of finding a place to sleep once they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with certain hotels, but it is still possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the same agencies.
Travel agencies generally offer packages including breakfast, airport transfers, or even combined flight + hotel packages.
They can also hold your booking if you need time to consider the offer or to obtain any further documents required for your destination (e.g. a visa).
However, any modifications or requests must first be submitted to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
On the occasion of some music festivals, most attendees decide to camp on site, considering this aspect a crucial element of the experience.
To be close to the center of the action, it's necessary to arrive early and secure a spot near the music.
Remember that once the music ends on the main stages, there may be festival sections where the music continues late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, as crossing the ice can cause quite annoying noises for those exposed to it.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time for exploring the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check conditions).
Generally, casinos do everything possible to increase the amount of time and money spent by their guests. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer exclusive food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and encourage them to stay.
In some establishments, alcoholic beverages are offered by the house. However, a state of intoxication impairs judgment, and any good gambler knows how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who decides to drive at high altitudes or on mountain passes should take into account the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures close to freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, friction is reduced, and it is not possible to drive as you would on clean asphalt.
During a snowstorm, a lot of snow can fall in a very short time, trapping you.
Even precipitation and snow squalls, or the formation of ice or condensation on the vehicle's windows, can reduce visibility.
However, ice and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic continues to flow almost uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are probably the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the centerpiece of many visitors' holidays.
In its popular usage, the term safari refers to trips taken by land, particularly in the savanna, to see the beautiful African wildlife.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars more closely, so ordinary equipment is sufficient to get a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes timid, and for this reason it is possible to observe them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "walking safari") is an excursion that can last a few hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2012, and some of the events will take place in other locations scattered throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics. The first Olympics were in fact held in 1964.
If your booking for flights and accommodation for 2020 was made before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, however most coronavirus cancellation policies, as of the end of March 2020, do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that the cost of most event tickets will be between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, while regular tickets will cost approximately 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry faster. Many hotels offer the use of an iron and ironing board, even if they are not present in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer, if you have one available.
Be careful not to expose the fabrics to excessively high temperatures, to avoid shrinkage or, in the worst case, burns.
There are various ways to disinfect water, and some of these prove to be more effective against specific risks.
In certain areas, boiling water for a minute is sufficient; in others, many minutes are required.
The effectiveness of filters varies, so if in doubt, it's advisable to consider purchasing bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers can come into contact with animal parasites that are not prevalent in their regions of origin.
Parasites can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, in addition to transmitting toxins or infections.
The same infectious diseases and dangerous animals that can injure or kill people with force are not usually qualified as harmful animals.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy products exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot, especially on products like alcohol and tobacco.
The stretch of the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway between Point Marion and Fairmont is the one with the most difficult driving conditions, as it often traverses isolated areas within the vegetation.
If you're not accustomed to driving on country roads, it's advisable to keep your eyes wide open, as steep inclines, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than those in the preceding and following sections (typically 35-40 mph / 56-64 km/h). Their strict observance is extremely important.
Strangely, however, in this area the level of mobile phone service coverage is much higher compared to what is present in other parts of the route, for example in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German desserts are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite flavorful and varied, similar to those in neighboring Austria further south.
Fruit desserts are a timeless classic, from those with apples available all year round to those with cherries and plums, which make their appearance during the summer.
Various German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. The most popular cakes often go very well with a cup of strong coffee.
Those who wish to sample small but flavorful pastries can look to those called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish prepared with herbs and spices combined with meat or vegetables.
Curry can be presented either "dry" or "wet," depending on the amount of liquid it contains.
In northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is typically used in curries in the inland regions; in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
Given the presence of 17,000 islands to choose from, the term "Indonesian cuisine" is a generic term that covers a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, when used without further specification, the term generally refers to foods originating from the central and eastern areas of the main island, Java.
Javanese cuisine, now widely spread throughout the archipelago, offers a series of simple dishes; its dominant flavors come from the use of peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and are hung on either side of the saddle.
They guarantee greater stability for the rider but can present safety problems due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting stuck.
If a jockey is thrown from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged by the escaping horse. To minimize this risk, there are some safety measures that can be taken.
First of all, most knights wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather thin sole.
Subsequently, some saddles, especially English saddles, have incorporated safety bars, which cause a leather stirrup to detach from the saddle when, in the event of a fall, the rider pulls it backward.
Cochamó Valley: Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, where there are a large number of enormous granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks of the summits offer breathtaking views. Climbers from all over the world continuously blaze new routes on its potentially infinite walls.
Downhill snow sports, such as skiing and snowboarding, are very popular and involve gliding on snow using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is one of the main tourist activities and boasts many enthusiasts, sometimes also defined as "ski bums" (those who wander for skiing), who dedicate entire periods of vacation to skiing in a particular resort.
The principle behind skiing is very ancient: the earliest cave paintings depicting humans skiing date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing, as a sport, has its origins at least in the 17th century; the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened in 1861 by Norwegians.
Ski touring: the activity is also called off-piste, ski mountaineering, or ski trekking.
It's connected, even though it usually doesn't understand them, to ski touring or skimo, which are practiced on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski slope as a route similar to a hiking trail.
If the conditions are good, you'll be able to cover distances somewhat greater than those covered on foot, but you'll only rarely reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but made up of many independent countries. Normally, to travel through multiple countries you would need to apply for a visa and go through passport control multiple times.
However, regarding this aspect, the Schengen Area functions rather like a single country.
If you remain within this area, it is usually possible to go from one border to the other without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for visas for individual member countries, thus saving time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universal definition of what makes a manufactured item an antique. Some tax agencies consider it an object that is at least 100 years old.
The definition shows geographical differences compared to the age limit, which can be lower, as in the case of North America compared to Europe.
Craft items could be defined as antiques, even if more recent than similar items produced in series.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture upon which this trade is based is also the foundation for many other professions.
Even over time, not all Sámi people were always involved in large-scale reindeer herding; some made their living from fishing, hunting, and similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the territory of the Sámi people.
Even though it's widely used, particularly among non-Roma people, the word "zingaro" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and a misperception of Roma people.
If a travel advisory is issued for the destination you will be visiting, there may be consequences for your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance.
You might also be interested in opinions from governments different from yours, but keep in mind that such opinions are aimed at the citizens of those governments.
To illustrate, American citizens in the Middle East might encounter different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The advisories simply constitute a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The opinions presented are often superficial, general, and simplistic compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
"Adverse weather conditions" is the general term used to indicate any dangerous weather phenomenon that can cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur in every part of the world, and there are various types of them, depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong gusts of wind, hail, rainfall exceeding the norm, and uncontrolled fires are manifestations and consequences of adverse weather conditions, similar to thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among the regional and seasonal high-intensity weather phenomena are storms, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are advised to check the weather conditions affecting their area, as they may impact travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country potentially considered a war zone must undergo professional training.
Searching on the Internet for 'Course on hostile environments' is likely to turn up the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually drawing on practical experience.
A course typically lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing games, as well as many first aid training activities and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines dealing with wilderness survival are widespread, whereas there are few publications that focus on war zones.
Travelers who are planning gender confirmation surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return journey.
The intention of governments to issue passports without gender indications (X) or updated documents to reflect a desired name and gender is variable.
Equally variable is the willingness of foreign governments to accept such documents.
Even security checks have become much more rigorous in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people in the pre-operative phase should not expect to pass screenings without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
Rip currents are made up of the return flow of waves breaking on the beach, often near a coral reef or similar formations.
Considering the underwater topography, the return flow concentrates in some deeper sections where a strong current towards the open sea can form.
The majority of deaths occur due to exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can become impossible.
As soon as you're out of the current, swimming back will no longer be more difficult than usual.
Try to find an area where you won't risk being trapped again, or consider waiting for rescue, depending on your abilities and whether you've been spotted.
The post-return shock manifests in a shorter timeframe compared to culture shock (due to a shorter "honeymoon" phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to the culture of their country of origin.
Upon returning home after living abroad, you will have adapted to the new culture and lost some of the customs of your culture of origin.
On their first experience abroad, it's likely one would have encountered patient and understanding people, aware that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Many people didn't imagine that patience and awareness would be necessary even for those returning home.
The sound and light show at the pyramid is the most interesting thing in the area for children.
Before the start of the show, it will be possible to admire the pyramids immersed in darkness and silence.
Normally, you always hear the noise caused by tourists and vendors. The spectacle of sounds and lights is just like a collection of short stories.
The Sphinx becomes the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and each pyramid is illuminated.
Claimed by several countries, the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have the largest number of bases, sixteen of which were active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the peninsula. King George Island is the largest and is home to the town of Villa Las Estrellas.
Among the other islands are Livingston Island and Deception; in the latter, the caldera of an active volcano, filled with water, has given rise to a magnificent natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region located south of the peninsula and facing the Bellingshausen Sea.
Here, the mountains of the peninsula merge into the plateau, before reappearing to form the Ellsworth Mountains, a 360 km chain cut in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, known as the Sentinel Range, boasts the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, which reaches 4892 m with Mount Vinson.
In remote areas with no cell phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only possible alternative.
A satellite phone generally doesn't serve as a replacement for a cell phone, because you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by pleasure craft, including leisure boats, as well as by missions that require remote data and voice communication.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
One of the increasingly popular options among those planning to take a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
It is particularly common among recent graduates, since they can take a year off before starting university without compromising their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during a gap year can actually increase the chances of resuming higher education upon returning to one's home country.
Usually, enrollment in these educational programs requires payment of a fee.
Finland is the ideal destination for those who love to sail. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes" there are also thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for archipelagos and lakes.
Even though coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are certainly sufficiently vast for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime of Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
This also happens in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but in general it is a rather singular fact (for example, the ratio is one to forty in the Netherlands).
A large portion of the various Baltic cruises includes a multi-day stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means it's possible to visit the historic town for two full days, returning to the ship in the evening to sleep.
A separate visa will not be required for disembarkation (as of 2009) when using shore excursions.
Some brochures also offer cruises to Berlin, Germany. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and furthermore, a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be frightening for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had some traumatic experience.
There's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from the personal fears and aversions that many people express towards other things.
For some people, understanding a little about how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can be helpful in overcoming a fear based on the unknown, or on the feeling of not having control.
Couriers are well-paid for delivering products quickly. Often, timing is very important in the case of business documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For some routes, larger companies use their own aircraft, but for other routes and in the case of smaller companies, problems arose.
On some routes, air shipments would have required days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to get it there faster would be to ship it as checked baggage. And this is where you come in, since airline regulations do not allow shipping baggage without a passenger.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a hefty sum for the privilege (or, even better, convince your company to do it).
However, the price to pay is high: you can expect to spend up to four times the normal economy fare for business class travel and up to eleven times the fare for first class!
In general, it's not even worth looking for discounts on first class or business class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a category of travelers willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving quickly and comfortably at their destination, and as a result, they apply certain fares.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău and the local language is Romanian. However, Russian is also very widespread.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that in the past was the site of an ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in the eastern part of Moldova, with its own government and currency, but not recognized by any member state of the UN.
Despite the failure of political negotiations, economic relations between these two regions of Moldova have been restored.
The dominant religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Smyrna is the third largest city in Turkey by size, with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants; it is the second largest port after Istanbul and an important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smyrna develops on a huge bay, is surrounded by mountains and currently constitutes a modern, developed, and active commercial center.
Although the city has an atmosphere more similar to that of Mediterranean Europe than to traditional Turkey, the wide avenues, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are dotted with characteristic red-tiled roofs, a 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches.
In the village of Haldarsvik, you can enjoy beautiful views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and visit a unique octagonal church.
On the churchyard of the church, on some of the tombs, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves.
Half an hour is enough to walk around the enchanting village.
To the north lies the romantic and enchanting city of Sintra, easily accessible. It became famous to foreign eyes thanks to the brilliant account of its splendors written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly connects with Sintra, and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Always heading north, visit the great sanctuary of the Virgin of Fatima (a place of worship), a site of famous Marian apparitions worldwide.
Remember that the site you are visiting is fundamentally a mass grave, and has a virtually incalculable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still many men and women who survived these places, and many others who saw their loved ones murdered or forced to work to death, both Jews and non-Jews.
Treat the place with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Avoid jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Avoid defacing these places by marking structures with signs or graffiti.
In the city of Barcelona, the official languages are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half the population prefers to speak Catalan, the vast majority are able to understand it; Spanish is known by practically everyone.
However, most of the signs are written exclusively in Catalan, which is the first official language by law.
Spanish, however, is also widely used for public transportation and other services.
In the subway, regular announcements are only in Catalan. Any unplanned service disruptions are communicated in a wide variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese, thanks to an automated system.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though it's often just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris continues to be to behave properly, interacting like a "well-bred" person (well-mannered). This will certainly make your travels easier.
The Parisians' rough outer appearance will quickly disappear if you display some basic manners.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is rich in forests, mainly beech, fir, and spruce, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to a multiplicity of microclimates, soils, and altitude levels, it presents a great variety of plant communities.
The area also hosts a huge variety of animal and bird species.
In these places, rare species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and great bustard live alongside various other more common animal species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and to cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries provide stoles for women who arrive unprepared, but if you already have one, especially if it's brightly colored, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long trousers that go down to below the knees.
These can also be borrowed from the depot at the entrance; however, the garments are not washed after each user, so wearing these skirts might make you feel uncomfortable. For men, one size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and makes extensive use of olive oil.
Pa amb oli is a simple, popular summer meal: bread with olive oil, tomato, and whatever toppings are available, such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, with the exception of the pronoun "Sie" used for the polite form meaning "You", always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This represents an important mechanism for distinguishing certain verbs and complements.
This aspect likely also facilitates reading, although the need to understand whether a verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form makes writing quite complex.
Italian pronunciation is relatively simple since most words are pronounced as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are 'c' and 'g', as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Also, be sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means beloved, while "carro" means carriage.
Persian possesses a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this basic grammar manual could greatly help you with Persian grammar and understanding sentences.
It goes without saying that if you already know a Romance language, learning Portuguese will be easier.
However, people with even a minimal knowledge of Spanish can jump to the hasty conclusion that Portuguese is quite similar and therefore does not need to be studied separately.
Usually nowadays, pre-modern observers are obsolete and function as museums or educational places.
Since light pollution wasn't an issue during their golden age like it is today, they are usually located in cities or on campuses, which are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas where atmospheric conditions are favorable.
The admiration of cherry blossom blooming, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated in China, where the blossoming of plum trees was favored.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were organized by the emperor only for himself and for other members of the aristocracy close to the imperial court.
Plants perform best when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to take even just one specimen.
If you visit an Italian garden, even collecting a few specimens of plants will cost you expulsion from this place, no arguments.
In general, Singapore is a very safe and easy city to get around in; you can buy practically anything once you arrive.
But being in the "high tropics," only a few degrees north of the equator, you'll have to contend with the heat (always) and strong sun (more rarely, when the sky is clear).
Some buses also head north towards Hebron, the traditional place where the patriarchs of the Bible – Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives – were buried.
Make sure the bus you wish to take reaches inside Hebron and doesn't stop at the nearby Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The inland waterways can be a great theme around which to organize a vacation.
For example, you can visit the castles in the Loire Valley and the Rhine Valley, you can take a cruise to visit the interesting cities of the Danube, or you can sail on the Erie Canal.
Furthermore, they define well-known hiking trails and bike paths.
Christmas represents one of the most important holidays in Christianity and celebrates the birth of Jesus.
A large part of the traditions associated with this holiday have also been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
A tradition involves spending Easter night staying awake in an outdoor location to watch the sunrise.
There are naturally Christian theological explanations behind this tradition, but it could very well be a pre-Christian ritual linked to spring and fertility.
In the most traditional churches, an Easter vigil is often held on the night of Saturday of Easter weekend, with the congregations often beginning the ceremony at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands got there by swimming, flying, or floating.
Since the distance from the continent was considerable, the mammals were unable to undertake the journey. This allowed the giant tortoise to become the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Numerous mammals, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, dogs, and cats, have been introduced to the Galapagos Islands after the arrival of humans.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic territories during winter, you will be able to experience the polar night, when the sun remains below the horizon.
This phenomenon offers the opportunity to witness the aurora borealis, because the sky remains dark for almost the entire day.
Since the territories are sparsely populated, light pollution often isn't an issue and you can also enjoy the stars.
In Japan, the work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners tend to be accustomed to.
Office attire typically consists of a jacket and tie or a suit, and colleagues are addressed by surname or professional title.
The harmony of the workplace is crucial, as it prioritizes the commitment of the group rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers often need to receive approval from their superiors regarding every decision, and it is expected that they follow instructions without asking questions.
