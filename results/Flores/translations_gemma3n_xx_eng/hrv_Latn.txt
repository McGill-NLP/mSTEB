Although it has been shown that one experimental vaccine can reduce mortality from Ebola, no drug has yet been proven suitable for treating existing infections.
The antibody cocktail, ZMapp, was initially promising in that field. However, official studies have shown that it had less than the desired benefit in preventing death.
In the PALM clinical trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared the remaining three drugs to it.
American gymnastics supports the letter from the US Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute need for the Olympic family to promote a safe environment for all our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the greater interest of our athletes and clubs, and their sports, lies in progressing within our organization, with meaningful changes, rather than dissolving the organization.

Time is confirming that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a widely accepted theory, but it allows for details that fossils usually don't provide, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists claim that the upper side of this animal's feathers was chestnut brown, and the underside pale or carotenoid.
This discovery also provides insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, the central shaft of feathers called the rachis, but possess other feather features – pennaceous (I and II order) feathers – researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later in evolutionary history than those other features.
Based on the feather structure, it can be concluded that it wasn't used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers claim that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of the color of adult specimens, not juvenile plumage.
The research showed that despite it being a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample is part of feathers the color of an adult bird, not chicken down.
A car bomb exploded near the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey yesterday morning, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

The work was mainly theoretical, but the program was intended to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team aimed for is caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon pulls the earth and causes tides, so too does the Milky Way pull the galaxy Sagittarius.
Scientists have proven that dark matter influences each other just like ordinary matter.
According to that theory, most of the dark matter around galaxies forms a sort of halo around the galaxy, which consists of a multitude of small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he stated that the new variant is "very concerning and alarming" due to a very high mortality rate.
Dr. Moll believes that some patients may have become ill during their hospital stay, and at least two more were healthcare workers.
In one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
However, it appears that the proportion of XDR-TB cases in the population of patients with tuberculosis remains low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 patients who are suffering from tuberculosis at any given time in South Africa.

In 1956, Słania moved to Sweden where, three years later, he began working for Swedish Post and became their chief engraver. **Note:** The provided Croatian sentence seems to be a mix of Croatian and Polish words. I've interpreted it based on the common Croatian word "Słania" (which is Polish for "Elephant") and the context of the sentence. I've translated it as accurately as possible, assuming the intended meaning. If "Słania" is a typo or a different word, the translation might need adjustment. Also, it's strange to have "Słania" in a Croatian sentence, so there might be an error in the original input.

All entrances to the cave, which are called "Seven Sisters," range in diameter from at least 100 to 250 meters (328 to 820 feet).
Temperature differences between night and day visible on infrared recordings suggest that these are likely caves.
During the day they are cooler than surrounding surfaces, and warmer at night.
The warmth of the cave isn't as uniform as in large caves on Earth which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it's consistent given that these are large openings in the ground,” says Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, high technology is traditionally not used during voting: voters are isolated in booths where a pre-printed slip of paper with the name of the chosen candidate is inserted into an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter places the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
The procedure is strictly regulated by French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that there are no ballots in them at the beginning of the voting process and that no ballots are added to them except those inserted by properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates may send representatives to testify to every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Schneider testified via video link from a base of the U.S. Air Force in his home country.
Apart from Wednesday, Carpanedo competed in two individual races at the championship.
First, she competed in the slalom, where she failed to finish the first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her second giant slalom race, she finished in tenth place in women's seated skiing with a combined time of 4:41.30 – 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four female skiers from the women's group were unable to finish the course, and 45 out of a total of 117 skiers in the Giant Slalom failed to qualify for the race.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five individuals suspected of raping a woman from Switzerland, and we have found her mobile phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused arrived at court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when a car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred is temporarily closed while emergency services free the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya is now in the primary court in Edinburgh on trial for the murder of his son.
In custody, she awaits the indictment and trial, but there is a possibility that eyewitness testimony will be tainted because many media outlets have published her photograph.
It's a standard practice throughout the United Kingdom, but the justice system in Scotland operates differently, and courts have deemed the publication of photographs potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that "it seems journalists are walking a tightrope by publishing photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Office, which oversees all criminal proceedings, announced to journalists that it would not be giving further comments until charges are filed.
According to leaked information, the document will refer to the border dispute, for which Palestine wants to be based on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics that were allegedly discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands a continuous military presence for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence lasting only five years.
Hunters in a controlled hunt aimed at controlling invasive species would be under strict supervision by park rangers who would monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the hunt.
Qualified volunteers were recruited as part of the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association, as part of a partnership between NPWS and the Australian hunting association Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for conservation and heritage of the park at NPWS, the four snipers selected to carry out the first cull operation have received extensive safety guidelines and undergone training.
Martelly yesterday took an oath in the Temporary Electoral Council (CEP), which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth temporary electoral board in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission cited CEP's prior resignation as part of a package of measures towards new elections.
The committee was Martelly's response to widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the lack of elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of faulty iPods overheating have been reported, causing six fires and resulting in minor burns for four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it is aware of 27 accidents related to devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which Apple claims are "not serious."
The Ministry called Apple's report delay "truly regrettable."
An earthquake hit the Marijański Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT on Friday).
The Office for Emergency Management in the Northern Mariana Islands announced that no damage has been reported in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center announced that there are no signs of a tsunami.
A former Philippine policeman held Hong Kong tourists captive by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired a shot at tourists from his M16 rifle.
So far, several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an older woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He was trained as a radiographer and began working at the national women's hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liggins started to research premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that the application of hormones accelerates the maturation of the fetus's lungs.
Xinhua Agency reported that government investigators found two flight data recorders from the "black box" on Wednesday.
Colleagues wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated: "Luna was the first queen of extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away two months ago. Quite uniquely, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnells stated, "Luna was as strange as I was, if not stranger... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place."
Of 1400 respondents prior to the 2010 federal elections, the number of those opposing the proposal for Australia to become a republic since 2008 has increased by 8 percent.
The interim Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of survey participants share the same viewpoint and believe that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of those surveyed believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The gold Olympic medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle races and in three Commonwealth Games relays, but their health is in question due to complaints.
He couldn't take pain medication because it's prohibited at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number known as of January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software at the beginning of February, and it was published on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of the origin of water on Earth, along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists are interested in how planets are formed, especially how Earth came to be, and how it collided with comets long ago.
Cuomov (53) term began earlier this year, and the governor signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
It is assumed that he/she will run for president in 2016.
The FAA claims that the NextGen system would allow for shorter flight routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and reducing carbon emissions.
Unlike older technology that relies on radar, this system uses satellite technology so that air traffic controllers can more precisely locate aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation options will be organized, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. Furthermore, vehicle parking facilities and ground-level parking and public transport will not be available.
Due to fears of insufficient transportation, the possibility has arisen that the match may have to be moved to a closed venue without fans.
Research published on Thursday in the journal Science reported on the development of a new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that new species have evolved within just two generations, despite it being believed that this process takes much longer, due to hybridization between the endemic Darwin's fox, Geospiza fortes, and the newcomer from the genus Geospiza, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be shaped into any imaginable form. It can be rolled into fine shapes.
It can be pulled into a thin wire, which can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled flat.
It can be very thin and adhere to another metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
That's called chemical pH. Red cabbage can be your indicator.
The brine changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH value indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H in short pH) in a tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons without electrons (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix together two dry powders, then squeeze them into a ball with clean, damp hands.
Moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, and the reaction will tingle and cause the formation of a sheath.
In Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, every house was equipped with at least one flush toilet connected to a sophisticated drainage system.
Remnants of sewage systems have been found in buildings of Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. During the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women mingled.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, and then almost immediately reflects it back down.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists in space use a telescope because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light and view.
A colossal rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel brought unimaginable changes to the world. The biggest change was that the invention of the wheel enabled much easier and faster transportation for us.
He enabled the invention of trains, automobiles, and many other modes of transportation.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Ultimately, many small cats (including domestic cats) eat a much more diverse range of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in the niche concept, that is, a special position occupied by each cat, so it doesn't have to compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called prides.
Prides of lions consist of one to three closely related adult males and up to thirty females and cubs.
Females are usually closely related and form a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a complete athlete, a tiger can climb (though not well), swim, jump long distances, and pull with five times the strength of a human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (the panther genus) as the lion, leopard, and jaguar. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather more like a series of unintelligible, shouted words.
Ocelots eat small animals. They love monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find prey by scent, sniffing out where the prey has moved on the ground.
They have very good night vision and move very stealthily in the dark. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings, and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originated from (for example, during a crossing of a mountain or river, or if they migrate to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment.
The new environment means different resources and different competition, so the new population needs features or adaptations that differ from the previous ones in order to compete for resources.
The indigenous population hasn't changed at all; they still have to make the same adjustments as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, it increasingly becomes less like the original population.
Over time, after thousands and even millions of years, the two populations will diverge so much in appearance that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe in and then take in carbon dioxide that people breathe out.
Plants create food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shelter.
We make houses and clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Animals couldn't survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the top predator of its time, so it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaw had more than 70 sharp teeth along with an additional set on the palate, meaning there was no help for anyone who crossed his path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible he had a toothed tongue. His diet consisted of turtles, large fish, and other mosasaurs, and he may have been cannibalistic as well.
It attacked anything that entered the water; even colossal dinosaurs like the T. rex would not be a match for it.
Although most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had a certain number of unusual or uncommon delicacies that included wild boars, peacocks, snails, and sea urchins.
The second difference was that the poor and women ate sitting on chairs, while the wealthy men enjoyed communal feasts where they would dine lying down on their sides.
The meals of ancient Romans could not contain ingredients that arrived in Europe from America or Asia during the following centuries.
For example, they did not know corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no one in ancient Rome ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the gods.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs by staging ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests could enter.
Sometimes, special pyramids shaped towers, called ziggurats, which were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a particularly divine sanctuary.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not as important.
Most of the lives of Jewish families took place outdoors.
Women cooked in the yard; shops were stalls facing the road. Stone was used for building houses.
In the land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was exceptionally expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norwegian sagas tell of how Erik the Red, after being exiled from Iceland for murder, discovered Greenland on his way west and named it so.
Despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes were already living there.
Although every country was "Scandinavian," there are many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might think there was a map to treasure on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not correct. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence it read: "Original Declaration of Independence July 4, 1776." The text is at the bottom of the document, printed on the reverse side.
No one knows for certain who wrote this large document on parchment (measuring 29¾ by 24½ inches), but it is known that it was soon rolled up for storage.
Therefore, that entry was likely added simply as a label.
The landings as part of D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
There reigned the French from the "Vichy France". These were the French who, in 1940, made a peace treaty with the Germans and worked together with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies attacked southern France. The attack is known as "Operation Dragoon."
In just two weeks, the Americans and Free French forces liberated southern France and advanced towards Germany.
Civilization is a unique culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together – society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word *civilis*, meaning civil, and refers to the Latin *civis*, meaning citizen, and *civitas*, meaning city or city-state, which also determines the size of society in a way.
City-states are precursors to states. Civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge from one generation to the next, a trace in culture, and an equal spread.
Often, lesser cultures disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence, so we don't recognize them as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, thirteen states initially established a weak central government composed solely of a congress through a constitutional act called the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes and, since there was no state or judicial authority, it relied on relevant bodies for the implementation of all acts, which often did not cooperate.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and customs between states.
Mutual agreement of all states was required to amend the Agreement, but the states did not take the central authority seriously, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were champions at the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include soccer (football), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions where Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Since it consists of a cluster (group) of islands, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The history of Taiwan begins in the 15th century, when European sailors, while sailing along the island, recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, "beautiful island."
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan in 1624 and initiated a transformation of indigenous agricultural practices in grain production, employing Chinese workers to work on rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) forcibly took over administration of Taiwan's western and northern coastal areas and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better introduction to how they were originally created.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues.
For example, the most common photograph format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size towards the end of the era of analog film.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, the same aspect ratios are used for image sensor formats in digital cameras.
It's a bit confusing that the 35-millimeter format is actually 36 mm wide and 24 mm tall.
The ratio of width to height of this format (divided by twelve to obtain a ratio expressed in whole numbers) is therefore 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, formats from the APS group) are equal to or closest to this aspect ratio of the image width and height.
The rule of thirds, which is often broken and ridiculed, is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a certain order in the image.
It states that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church became the subject of criticism.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has connected European states with different languages and customs.
The strong power of Christianity influenced everyone from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and reduce poverty, and that the financial resources of the church exist specifically for that reason.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for more than a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether they adhere to this principle.
Shortly after the outbreak of armed conflict, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy worked because it prevented German access to vital military and civilian supplies, but the blockade violated widely accepted international law codified in numerous international treaties over the past two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering large parts of the ocean, which posed a danger even to ships of neutral nations.
Given that there was not much interest in this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a pacifist stance and separation prevailed among most citizens and the people.
After experiencing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the peoples wanted to avoid such a situation from repeating in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 to accept a job with Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former employer) addressed to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there was a unique way of depicting different time periods; each phase of China or each family that held power was a recognizable dynasty.
Between each dynasty followed an unstable period of divided regions. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce wars took place among the nobles in a struggle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history; thousands of people died fighting for the top position in the grand palace of Xi'an.
The consequences are of a social and political nature, such as the adoption of the metric system, the shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not to the ruler.
Moreover, after the Revolution, employment was available to all men, and the most ambitious and successful were given the opportunity to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as positions were awarded after the revolution based on ability, not social status.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed people of the working class from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammed was very interested in questions beyond the confines of his mundane life. He would visit a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) so that he could think better.
The cave that has endured throughout history offers a clear picture of Muhammad's spiritual values.
The cave is located on the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find her at all, even if you're certain she exists. Once you find yourself in a cave, you are completely isolated.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and many surrounding mountains. Very little of the outside world can be seen or heard from the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and numerous smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu's wives and members of his family.
"The notation ""thumping motion upwards"" looks like a V, and ""thumping motion downwards"" is like a paper clip or a square without a bottom side."
The sign for upwards means to start from the top and push the ramming tool, while the sign for downwards means to start from the frog (where we hold the ramming tool with our hand) and pull the ramming tool.
Raising the throttle usually creates a softer sound, while lowering it results in a louder and more intrusive one.
Feel free to add your own tags, but remember that the tags for the butt wiggle movement are printed for musical reasons, so they should usually be followed.
A mob of women forced the terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two children (11-year-old Marie Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister Elizabeth to return from Versailles to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats at the king and queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows open.
At one point, a member of the mob swung the head of the royal guard killed in Versailles before the horrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves paid for the war expenses of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs, and the interest on the bonds was exchanged through Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofit derived from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos will form the basic profit of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, we must understand the context in which the order arose.
The period of those events is usually called the developed Middle Ages, and it is a period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 – 1300 AD).
The early Middle Ages preceded the developed High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages followed, which, according to convention, ends around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological driving force or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology follows a path that is largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, it can be said that the invention of the automobile necessarily leads to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country isn't cost-effective for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership leads to a higher number of road accidents, which results in the development of new techniques in healthcare for treating injuries.
In Romanticism, there was a strong element of cultural determinism among writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shapes the individual, and over time customs and culture related to geography emerge which are in harmony with the physical environment of society, and are therefore better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
As Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
It was known as the epicenter of luxury from 400 BC to approximately 1100 AD.
The situation worsened in the 12th century mainly because the Crusaders returned with silk and spices that had greater value than what the Byzantine market offered.
At this time, the title of the capital of fashion was transferred from Constantinople to Paris.
The peak of Gothic style was in the period from the 10th to the 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
The dress was initially strongly influenced by Byzantine culture from the East.
However, due to slow communication, Western styles lagged behind by 25 to 30 years.
At the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest discoveries of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was the use of buttons on clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture for the production of enough food to satisfy the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple and often organic system that uses locally adapted seeds in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, which still holds true for many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded people who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ based on generation, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of their members.
Qualities that make a subculture special can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of subcultures often demonstrate their affiliation through distinctive and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite examples of unhappy cases of children who, during their upbringing, did not undergo socialization by adults, whether as a result of neglect, accident, or intentional abuse.
Such children are called uncultured or feral. Some feral children are therefore captured by people (most often their own parents). In some cases, the abandonment of a child is a consequence of parents' refusal to accept that their child has a severe intellectual or mental disability.
Orphaned or runaway children can experience severe abuse or trauma before they are abandoned or run away.
Some assume they were raised by animals, and some are said to have lived in the wild on their own.
If animals raised him completely, the feral child displays behaviors (within physical limits) that are almost entirely similar to the behaviors of the animal that raised him, such as fear of people or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should facilitate learning and make it more engaging, setting up scaffolding goes a step further.
Setting up scaffolding, i.e. providing support (eng. scaffolding), is not an educational method, but rather support for individuals facing new learning experiences, e.g., using new computer software or starting a new project.
Skeletons can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a type of skeleton, as is the animated clip art that appears in Microsoft Office programs.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software and is intended for testing, guidance, and explanation of procedures that may be too challenging for the student to solve independently.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even coercion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, yet this still happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe space for these children.
Our foster care system is obligated to ensure safe homes, caring caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should meet all the needs that are lacking in the home from which the child was removed.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive features of the Internet open up additional dimensions in terms of usage and access.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are cited as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"In their research on visitor reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) also identified "personal engagement" and "continuing relationships" as new motivational aspects."
The use of video recordings has enabled important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that it is possible to discern whether a person is lying through the correct interpretation of microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The President's Speech," argues that people who cannot understand speech due to brain injury can still accurately assess its sincerity.
He hinted that even animals like domestic dogs have the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century showed that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the set of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination in each generation transfer variability between these two sources.
In savannas, primates with digestive systems similar to humans struggle to satisfy their amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Indeed, failure has serious consequences: slower growth, poor nutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most readily available plant resources were proteins from leaves and legumes, but they are difficult for primates like us to digest raw.
Conversely, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also contain large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved the "protein intake puzzle" in almost the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then going back to sleep sometime later (10–60 minutes).
It's possible to become aware without fully waking up by using a relatively quiet alarm clock.
If you realize you're turning off your alarm clock in your sleep, you can move it to the other side of the room, which will force you to get out of bed and turn it off.
Other biorhythmic options include consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before bed, which forces you to get up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive the life force present. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can experience enlightenment. The only thing standing in our way to that goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana path of loving-kindness and many techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Kundalini yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
Divine yoga is at the center of Tibetan meditation. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, differences in systems, actions, and cultures led to hostility between the two countries.
Two years before the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last the next 40 years and would lead truly empowered armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other locations.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had collapsed, and the only hope was a retreat and reorganization along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, those plans collapsed almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered Poland and created the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of eastern Polish regions, thus violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Shipping goods by ship is certainly the most efficient way for a large number of people and a large quantity of goods to cross an ocean.
The navy's traditional role has been to ensure your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously preventing the enemy from moving their people and goods.
One of the most important recent examples is the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid the British.
At the same time, the German navy, which mainly used submarines, was trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies had not succeeded, Germany would likely have succeeded in conquering Britain, as it succeeded with the rest of Europe.
Goats were first domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them for easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
The goats were typically kept in herds that roamed the hills and other pastures, and they were guarded by so-called goat herders, usually children or adolescents, which is a term for shepherds who tend goats. These livestock methods are still used today.
The rails for horse-drawn carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the first wooden wagon planks were made of only parallelly arranged boards, they allowed horses pulling the wagons to achieve greater speed and haul heavier loads than would have been possible on the somewhat uneven roads of that time.
Thresholds were introduced quite early on to keep the rails in place. However, it gradually became apparent that the rails could be more effective with iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron has caused greater wear and tear on wooden cart wheels.
Finally, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known method of transport was walking. People began to walk upright two million years ago when Homo erectus (upright man) appeared.
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, typically did not walk upright.
Bipedal walking appeared in Australopithecus around 4.2 - 3.9 million years ago, and it is possible that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more in harmony with the environment, we can join ecological movements, and we can even be activists to somewhat reduce suffering in the future.
In many cases, it's like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't seek a solution that is only temporary, we must find the root of these problems and neutralize them.
Clearly, the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological advancements of humankind, and problems are becoming increasingly severe due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of people.
After the Congress adopted the handwritten draft on July 4th, signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, it was then sent a few streets further to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were produced, which are now known as the "Dunlap broadsides."
John Nixon first publicly read the document on July 8th in the courtyard of Independence Hall.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 known surviving copies of Dunlap are the oldest preserved copies of the document. The handwritten original is not preserved.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and that they still live today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
Many features of birds resemble those of dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on two back legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on processing information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
Perhaps the best indicator of internal poisoning is the presence of an open container of medication or household chemicals.
On the label, look for special first aid instructions specific to that poison.
Entomologists use the term "beetle" in the formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from well-known mites, insects that have adapted very well to parasitizing humans.
Cockroaches, both assassin and common ones, depend on their hosts, living in their nests or living spaces.
In the United States, approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are known, making it the leading neurological disease in people of younger and middle age.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may conclude that raising a newborn is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
Such couples may offer their child for adoption.
In adoption, biological parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method is essentially a guideline for most scientific research.
Besides this method, experimentation, or rather tests that represent elimination of one or more possible hypotheses, asking questions and observation also guide scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greeks declined, the West severed ties with the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Cyclical rhythms, which are not only a response to external cyclical stimuli, have been discovered in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue periods of free cycles even if there are no external cues.
The experiment conducted by Hershey and Chase was one of the leading proposals that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments that revealed DNA in the phage with radioactive phosphorus or phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the cells affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas for the purpose of enjoying the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities available on the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small towns and drive to work, passing by those whose destination is the place these people have just left.
In this dynamic transport scenario, everyone is somehow connected to and supports the road transport system based on private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rare.
Why are traffic systems the cause of so many complaints; why do they fail every day? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is there something much bigger at play?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually behave relatively consistently, so traffic flows have a certain reasonable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help in planning, designing, and working on road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly enabled them to escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more effectively.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings backward along their body.
This allows them to have a greater number of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the fairyfly and the water flower.
Thousands of years ago, Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some thought she was right, but many were convinced of the opposite - that the solar system, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable because we don't feel the Earth moving, don't we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river on Earth. It contains more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes six miles wide.
Even 20 percent of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main flow of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although stone pyramids were built until the collapse of the Old Kingdom, none surpassed the size and technical excellence of the pyramids at Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The Vatican uses Italian in legislation and official communication.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people who work in the country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known about the basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle had a theory that everything is composed of one or a mixture of more than four elements. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four aggregate states (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also theorized about them transforming into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially mixtures of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table contains numerous elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Also, there may be alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. Matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into a dot at the end of this sentence.
The pencil thus became a close companion to a large number of people when it was introduced.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the pencil has lost status and is used less and less.
People today write messages on computer screens, so they don't need a quill anymore.
We can only guess what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
A physical bomb works on the principle of taking energy to assemble a core with numerous protons and neutrons.
It's roughly like pushing heavy strollers uphill. By splitting the core, a portion of that energy is released again.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with a slight push or without any push at all.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the crust is approximately 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
It is thinner in the lunar seas region and thicker in the plateau region.
On the closer side, there might be more dark areas because the crust is thinner. The lava reached the surface more easily.
Content theories focus on discovering what motivates or attracts people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized with maturation and growing up.
These theories examine what motivates people to want what they want and which environmental stimuli encourage them to do or not do something.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two behaviors can emerge when leaders begin managing former colleagues. At one end of the spectrum are attempts to remain "part of the team."
This type of leader encounters difficulties when making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, some people transform into unrecognizable individuals who believe they must change everything the team has done so far and do things their own way.
The team leader is ultimately the one responsible for its success or failure.
This behavior often leads to a rift between the leader and the others.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Members of virtual teams often represent a point of contact for the closest physical group.
They are often more autonomous than classic team members because their teams can be located in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The Invisible Team" represents a management team to which each member is accountable. The Invisible Team sets standards for every member.
Why would an organization go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization again? Innovation is one of the goals of putting learning organizational concepts into practice.
After effective use of all available resources in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity come to the forefront.
As a result, the organization process that seeks to overcome obstacles through collaboration can lead to a new, innovative process for fulfilling customer needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, shared knowledge, and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) defines continuous access as a method through which organizations can achieve a higher level of efficiency.
Neurobiological data represent physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. This makes the field of research narrower and much more precise.
The connection between brain pathology and behavior is confirmed by scientific research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in specific mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and explore previously unseen brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a wealth of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction connotation, it constitutes a very important branch of information science dealing with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Artificial intelligence research involves the creation of machines for the purpose of automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to customer diagnoses and questions, and recognizing handwriting, voice, and faces.
Such things have become distinct disciplines focusing on providing solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, construction, and the military because they are integrated into some software applications for home computers and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class. The teacher often wishes she could take her students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Technology offers a solution for virtual excursions. Students can tour museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual field trips are also an excellent way to think about the journey and share the experience with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the page changes every year, but old versions are kept online as a kind of scrapbook.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. When students start keeping a blog, they often make mistakes in grammar and spelling, but the presence of an audience usually corrects them.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger starts striving to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Writing a blog also "forces students to become more resourceful in the world around them." The need to engage the audience inspires them to be inventive and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend learning beyond the traditional classroom.
"The appropriate use of blogs can encourage students to think analytically and critically; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their stance in the context of others' writings and present their own perspective on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming capital of Canada and offers a range of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
The Niagara Falls are situated a bit further south, while the north is home to untouched natural beauties in the Muskoka region and beyond.
Because of all those things, foreign visitors to Ontario experience Canada in its essence.
Large areas further north are sparsely populated, and in some places, virtually uninhabited wilderness prevails.
For comparison of population that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the USA than citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest and can be considered a continent when it comes to plant and animal life.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or have ties to France and are known luxury resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, which took deep root in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonization began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area is surrounded by the Sahel to the north, and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: it is recommended that women traveling state they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can result in something that could be considered harassment, and it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their arm, etc.
Resolutely reject men and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (it's not okay regardless of cultural differences!).
The city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and during the time of the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, the city was known as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it as Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city called Dar l-Bayda, and the name Casablanca was given to it by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pots, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole array of trinkets, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the far east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, the lava from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed the rubber, burying most of the city's streets, especially the center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the nature of the conflicts taking place in the North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and offers some of the cheapest gorilla trekking options in Africa.
To get around Gome, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). A normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short ride.
Due to its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" is today used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it possesses an airport, Timbuktu is today a impoverished city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites due to the threat of sandstorms.
That was one of the main locations where Henry Louis Gates stopped during the filming of the PBS special, Wonders of the African World.
The city is essentially the opposite of other cities in the country because it has more Arab influences than African influences.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park's area of 19,500 km² is divided into 14 different eco-zones, and each one is inhabited by a different species of wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African national park (SANParks).
As in other South African national parks, it is necessary to pay daily conservation fees and entrance tickets.
Someone might also find it useful to buy a wildcard card that allows entry to certain parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The territory of Hong Kong got its name from the island of Hong Kong, which is a main center for many tourists.
The exhibition of buildings that make up the panorama of Hong Kong is comparable to a glittering bar graph, which is even more noticeable thanks to the sea in Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely packed on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
British colonizers seized that place, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove coastal zone, extending 80 km (50 miles) from the coast all the way to Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. Part of the forest located on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, forests are not just mangrove swamps. They include some of the last remaining places of powerful jungles that once covered the Ganges Valley.
The Sundarbans stretches over an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by waterlogged areas.
The Sundarbans has been a refuge for wild animals since 1966, and it is estimated that around 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer now live there.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) all day long, but most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Given that the local buses are often crowded, it is recommended to buy a ticket a couple of days in advance.
In most counties, small Japanese Toyota Coaster buses are used, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Sharing a taxi is a quick and pleasant way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (150 Nu.) and Punakha (200 Nu.).
A suspension bridge spans the Oyapock River. The bridge across the Oyapock River connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters. It is 378 meters long and has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and the bridge was opened to traffic in March 2017.
The opening of the bridge is scheduled for September 2017, pending the completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous community settled in present-day eastern Paraguay. They were semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who lived by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
After the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous population in the 16th century, Paraguay came into being, previously known as the "Great Province of the Indies."
The Spanish initiated a three-century period of colonization.
Paraguay has largely managed to retain its indigenous character and identity since the founding of Asunción in 1537.
The Argentinian national team and its players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and matches are also held at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and information on where to buy tickets for matches, please check the website of the Asociacion Argentina de Polo association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands pound (FKP), which has the same value as the British pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged in the only bank on the islands, which is located in Stanley across from the FIC West shopping center.
British pounds are generally accepted anywhere on the islands, and credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted in Stanley.
On remote islands, they likely don't accept credit cards, but they might accept British and US currency; it's best to inquire with the owner beforehand to find out what payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone; typical temperatures in the summer months are around +30°C.
Winter can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity creates the feeling that it's colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is generally the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to human visits, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park administration instructions, maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
Regardless of how docile they may appear, bison, deer, reindeer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they didn't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. It is located on the island of Upolu and has just slightly less than 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and served as the official capital of Samoa from 1959.
An inglorious naval battle took place in the harbor in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships sank except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 German and American citizens lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence led by the Mau movement, an assassination occurred during a peaceful gathering in the city of Tupua Tamasese Lealof III, the supreme leader.
As Auckland boasts two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches on the northern coast (in the North Harbour district) on the Pacific Ocean stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, it's safe to swim on them, and many of them offer shade from the Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in the heart of Auckland.
These are family beaches that can sometimes be crowded with a long row of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One." The beer isn't complex, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines you must try, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might suit you better.
Tap water is safe to drink locally, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
The concept of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black coffee is called "espresso," cappuccino has a lot of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is on par with Belgian chocolate. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many people visit the ridge throughout the year, and injuries resulting from any of the aforementioned causes are rare.
However, listen to the authorities' advice, respect all signs, and follow safety warnings.
Starfish appear near beaches and river mouths north of the city from October to April, starting in 1770. They occasionally appear in other months as well.
Starfish exist, but they often attack people. Most starfish are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their main habitat is in the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking accommodation in advance relieves travelers of a burden because they know they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although it may be possible to book other types of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, organized transportation to/from the airport, or even combination packages of flight and hotel.
I can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or gather any other documents required for your trip (e.g., a visa).
However, all amendments or requests should first be directed to the travel agency, and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of participants camp at the festival venue, and most of them consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the stage as possible, you will have to come early to secure a seat.
Please keep in mind that even if the music on the main stages ends, some parts of the festival will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals offer special camping areas designed for families with young children.
If you travel through the northern Baltic region in winter, be careful when choosing a cabin because passing through ice creates a terrible noise that is more audible in certain cabins.
Cruises in Saint Petersburg include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises do not need a visa (check the requirements).
Casinos typically try to maximize the amount of time and money guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually offer special food, drinks, and entertainment to maintain the guests' good mood and keep them at the property.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers are aware of how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snow-covered roads, there's little traction, and you can't drive as if you were on clear asphalt.
During a blizzard, enough snow can fall in a short time to get you stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling snow or snow carried by the wind, condensation, or ice on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow conditions are common in many countries, but traffic generally continues without interruption throughout the year.
Safari is likely the biggest draw for tourists in Africa and the best experience for many visitors.
The concept of a safari in everyday use refers to a land journey with the purpose of observing impressive African wildlife, especially in savannas.
Individual animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often come close to cars, and a good view is possible with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and you're better off seeing them with binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "walking safari") consists of walking that can last from several hours to several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will take place at other locations across Japan.
Tokyo, host of the 1964 Games, will become the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics.
If you booked flights and accommodation for the Games 2020 before they were postponed, you might find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation rules due to the coronavirus were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to be held.
Tickets for most events are expected to cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, while regular tickets will cost around 7,000 ¥.
You can dry damp clothes by ironing them. Many hotels will lend you an iron and ironing board even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can also use a hairdryer if you have one handy.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can lead to shrinkage or, in extreme cases, cause burns).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it's enough for water to boil for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters differ in effectiveness, and if you have any doubts, buy bottled water from reputable companies.
Passengers may encounter pests they are not used to in their region.
Pests can spoil food, cause itching, or in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, transmit poison, or infections.
Infectious diseases or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people through the use of force are usually not classified as plagues.
Shopping in duty-free shops offers the opportunity to purchase products免税 and免关税 at specific locations.
Passengers traveling to countries with high taxes can save a significant amount of money, especially when purchasing alcoholic beverages and tobacco products.
The stretch of road between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo – Pittsburgh highway, often passing through isolated wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be prepared for anything: steep inclines, narrow passages, and sharp turns are prevalent.
The posted speed limits are visibly lower than in the preceding and following sections, typically 35-40 mi/h (56-64 km/h), and strict adherence to the limits is more important than usual.
It's interesting, however, that the mobile service here is better than on many other stretches of the road, e.g., Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakery products are quite good and diverse in Bavaria, just like with the southern neighbors, the Austrians.
Common pastries made with fruit are available, for example apples which are added to pastries year-round, as well as cherries and plums which are used in the summer.
Many German bakery products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. A cup of strong coffee often goes well with popular cakes.
If you fancy small but generous bites, try what is known as a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Curry is a dish based on herbs and spices with meat or vegetables.
Depending on the amount of liquid, curry can be "dry" or "wet."
Yogurt is a common ingredient in curries in the inland areas of northern India and Pakistan; coconut milk is most commonly used in southern India and some coastal parts of the subcontinent.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term for a multitude of regional cuisines across the country.
However, if used without further additions, the term refers to food that is originally from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is widely available throughout the archipelago and consists of a range of simply seasoned dishes dominated by flavors favored by the people of Java: peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are footrests for a rider that hang on either side of the saddle.
They provide greater stability for the rider, but also involve certain safety risks because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If the rider falls from the horse but their leg is stuck in the stirrup, the horse could drag them if it escapes. To reduce the risk, certain safety measures should be taken.
First, most drivers wear high-heeled boots with smooth, narrow soles.
To those who are interested, let them saddle up, and especially English saddles, which contain safety bars that allow the girth of the stirrup to detach from the saddle if the rider pulls it backward in a fall.
The Cochamó Valley is the main climbing destination in Chile, also known as the South American Yosemite thanks to the variety of large granite cliffs and spires.
Views from the summits are breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world constantly establish new routes among the endless possibilities it offers.
Snow sports involving gliding down a snow-covered slope, including skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending a snowy slope using skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a popular recreational activity, and many people known as "ski enthusiasts" plan their annual vacations around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – images in caves depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing dates back to at least the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians in Australia opened the first recreational ski club.
Traveling with a backpack and skis is also called ski touring, ski expedition, or ski mountaineering.
It is related to alpine skiing or hiking, although it usually doesn't include them. Hiking usually takes place on steep terrain and requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski slope as similar to a hiking trail.
You will be able to cover somewhat greater distances in good conditions than by walking, but you will very rarely achieve the speed of ski running without a heavy backpack on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it consists of numerous independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would mean applying for a visa multiple times and going through passport controls.
The Schengen area, however, functions as one country in this regard.
As long as you are in that zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you possess a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa in each member state of the Schengen area individually, which saves time, money, and reduces the amount of paperwork.
There is no universal definition of antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods older than 100 years.
There are geographical differences in the definition, so the age limit in places like North America might be lower than in Europe.
Handmade products can be called antiques even though they were created later than similar mass-produced goods.
Managing livestock is an important source of income for members of the Sami people, and the culture associated with trading is also important for many people in other professions.
However, traditionally, not all members of the Sámi people were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, and the reindeer mainly served them for pulling sleds.
Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern crafts. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region, Sápmi.
Although the word "Ciganin" is widely used, especially among non-Romani peoples, it is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma.
If the country you are traveling to is on a list of countries with travel advisories issued, this may affect your travel health insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You can consult with other governments besides your own, but their advice is tailored to their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East can find themselves in different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Tips are a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The stated positions are often short, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any hazardous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world in various forms, depending on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of dangerous weather conditions, as well as thunderstorms, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather phenomena include thunderstorms, blizzards, ice storms, and dust storms.
Passengers are advised to be aware of the potential risk of bad weather in their area, as it may affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a territory that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
If you perform a web search with the keywords "course for hostile areas," you will find the address of a local company.
The course largely covers all the topics discussed here in more detail, usually with practical experience.
The course usually lasts 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing, many lessons related to first aid, and sometimes firearms training.
Many books and journals deal with wilderness survival, but publications that cover war zones are rare.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must bring valid travel documents for their return.
Readiness to issue passports that do not list sex (X) or documents updated to reflect the desired name and sex varies from government to government.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect such documents also varies from government to government.
Screening at checkpoints has also become more drastic in the post-9/11 era.
Transgender people who have not undergone surgery are likely to not pass through a scanner without a violation of their privacy and dignity.
The tidal bore is a return wave surge that breaks against the shore, often against a reef or similar feature.
Due to the underground topology, the return flow is concentrated in a few deeper sections, and the formation of a fast current towards greater depths is possible.
Death mostly occurs when a person tires while trying to swim against the current, which is often impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to swim so that the current doesn't catch you again, or, depending on your skills and whether someone has noticed you, you can wait for help.
The shock of returning to one's culture occurs before the cultural shock. The honeymoon phase is shorter, the shock lasts longer, and it can be more serious.
Passengers who easily adapt to a new culture sometimes have difficulty readjusting to their own.
When you return home after living abroad, you've adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits that belong to your own culture.
When you first traveled abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers in a new country need time to adjust.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are necessary upon the return of travelers to their homes.
The sound and light show on the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in that area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and silence before the start of the show.
Usually, the sounds of tourists and vendors can be heard. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The Sphinx acts as both backdrop and narrator of a long tale.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and host the most bases – sixteen active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, where the settlement Villa Las Estrellas is located.
The others include Livingston and Deception Islands, where a flooded crater of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
The Ellsworth Land region is south of the island, surrounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge into plateaus, and then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth mountain range, which is crossed by the Minnesota Glacier.
On the northern part of the Sentinel range are the highest Antarctic mountains, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak is Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations where there is no signal coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
Satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you have to call outdoors and the satellite must be in sight to make a call.
The service is often used in freight forwarding, on recreational vessels, but also on expeditions that require remote data and voice transmission.
The telephone service provider should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
Traveling and learning is an increasingly popular option for those planning to take a year off.
It's particularly popular with those who drop out of school because it allows them to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during your gap year can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your home country.
There is usually an enrollment fee for these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands on the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
A yacht isn't necessarily needed for the archipelago and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are large enough for yachting, traveling in smaller boats or by kayak offers a completely different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, which has one boat for every seven or eight residents.
A similar situation exists in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands, that number is one in forty).
Most well-known Baltic cruises include an extended stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic town for a few days and return at night to sleep on the boat.
If you are traveling to the mainland as part of a boat trip, you will not need a separate visa (since 2009).
Brochures for some cruises also include Berlin in Germany. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or if they have experienced a traumatic event.
There's no need to be ashamed of that: it's no different from the fears and prejudices that many people feel towards other things.
Understanding how an aircraft works and what happens during flight can help some people overcome fear based on the unknown or lack of control.
Courier companies are well-compensated for prompt delivery of shipments. Time is often of paramount importance when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but a problem arose on other routes with smaller companies.
If cargo is shipped by air, unloading and customs procedures could take days on some routes.
The only way to get through this faster is to send the items as checked baggage. According to the airline's rules, luggage cannot travel without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
It goes without saying that you'll be able to fly first or business class if you set aside a thicker wad of banknotes for the privilege (or, even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: generally speaking, expect it to cost you up to four times more than the usual price of an economy class seat, that is, eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts on seats in business or first class on direct flights from point A to point B.
Airline companies are well aware that a certain group of passengers is willing to pay a large sum of money for the privilege of fast and comfortable travel, and accordingly, they set prices.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The language of the population is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has faced ethnic conflicts.
That conflict in 1994 led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member state of the UN.
Economic ties between these two parts of Moldova have been re-established despite the failure of political negotiations.
Orthodox Christianity is the majority religion in Moldova.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million. It is the second largest port after Istanbul and a very important transportation hub.
The ancient city of Smirna (Izmir), once a historic place, is today a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center surrounded by mountains and situated around a large bay.
Wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are dotted with classic red-tiled roofs, an 18th-century marketplace, old mosques and churches, although the city's atmosphere is more reminiscent of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, you can see the nearby island of Eysturoy, and in it is also an unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves placed above individual tombs.
It's worth taking a half hour to stroll through the intriguing village.
To the north lies the easily accessible, romantic and fascinating city of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after a splendid depiction of its beauties recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly runs to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
Also, in the north, visit the large sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (the Altar), a place of world-renowned Marian apparitions.
Please be aware that you are visiting a mass grave site that holds almost immeasurable significance for a significant portion of the world's population.
There are still a large number of men and women who survived it, as well as those whose loved ones were killed there or died from overwork, whether Jews or not.
Treat this place with the dignity and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place with painted or carved graffiti on existing structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Approximately half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, a large majority understands it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan because it is legally established as the first official language.
Yes, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other infrastructure.
Regular announcements in the subway are in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced via an automated system in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisi are known for being impolite, arrogant, and egocentric.
Although it's often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is to be polite, or to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will significantly ease your stay.
The unpleasant exterior of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show some basic kindness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is densely wooded, with beech, spruce, and fir trees being the most common. The park is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
The park is home to a particularly wide range of plant communities thanks to the diverse microclimates, soil types, and variations in altitude within the park.
In that area live exceptionally diverse species of animals and birds.
Here, you can find rare animal species such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and the bearded vulture, along with many other more common species.
During a visit to the monastery, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and clothing that covers their shoulders.
Most monasteries have headscarves for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own headscarf, especially in bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that cover the knees.
You can borrow them at the entrance, but the clothes aren't washed after every visitor, so you might not be comfortable wearing them. The sizes are universal!
Majorcan cuisine, like those in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil in everything.
Well, olive oil is a favorite simple dish especially eaten in the summer: it's bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available addition, like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "Sie" which means "You," always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It certainly makes reading easier, although writing is somewhat complicated by the need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used in a nominal form.
The pronunciation in Italian is relatively simple because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters that require special attention are c and g because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also, be careful to pronounce 'r' and 'rr' differently: 'caro' means dear, and 'carro' means wheels.
The grammar of the Persian language is relatively simple and mostly regular.
This grammar primer will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
Of course, if you know a Romance language, you will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know some Spanish can easily conclude that Portuguese is similar enough that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Predominantly pre-modern observatories are today most often outdated and are used as museums or educational venues.
Mild pollution in their prime wasn't a problem like it is today. They are usually found in cities or campuses and are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
The most modern research telescopes are enormous objects located in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Watching cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated from China, where the plum blossom was the favorite flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held only by the emperor himself and other members of the nobility around the imperial palace.
Plants look best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden, you will be ejected without further discussion due to the collection of "specimens."
Singapore is generally an exceptionally safe place and it's very easy to get around. Once you arrive, you can buy almost anything.
Situated in the tropics, just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with both the heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
Several buses run north to Hebron, the cemetery where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Check if the bus you want to take goes all the way to Hebron, and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good option for a vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire or Rhine valleys, cruising through interesting cities on the Danube, or sailing along the Erie Canal.
They also establish routes for popular hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important Christian holidays and is celebrated as the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions characteristic of this holiday have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
As is tradition, Easter night is spent at some open place to watch the sunrise.
For this tradition, of course, there are Christian theological explanations, but it might be a pre-Christian fertility ritual in honor of the arrival of spring.
In more traditional churches, the Easter Vigil is often held on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and communities begin celebrating the Resurrection of Christ when the clock strikes midnight.
Most animals originally arrived on islands by swimming, flying, or rafting.
Due to the great distance from the mainland, mammals were unable to reach the islands, so the giant tortoise became the primary survivor on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic region in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights because the sky will be more or less constantly dark.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is often not a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is significantly more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are accustomed to.
At the workplace, suits are worn, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Unity in the workplace is of crucial importance – the emphasis is on collective effort, not on glorifying the achievements of individuals.
Workers must often seek approval from their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their superiors' instructions without question.
