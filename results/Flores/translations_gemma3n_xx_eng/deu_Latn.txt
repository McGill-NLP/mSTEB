USA Gymnastics supports the letter from the United States Olympic Committee and accepts it as an absolute necessity that the Olympic family advocate for a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that the interests of our athletes and clubs and their sport are better served by driving meaningful change within our organization, rather than pursuing decertification.

This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widely accepted, but also provides details that fossils generally cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper side and light- or carotinoid-colored on the underside.
The find also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft called the rachis, but possess other feather characteristics – barbules and hooklets – the researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. The researchers hypothesized that the specimen, although the tail of a young dinosaur, shows the plumage of an adult rather than the down of a chick.
The researchers claimed that, although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows the plumage of an adult and not chick down.
An Autobomb detonated on the morning of yesterday at the Turkish police headquarters in Gaziantep, killing two police officers and injuring over twenty other people.
According to the governor's office, nineteen of the injured are police officers.
The police said that they suspect a militant supporter of Daesh (ISIL) was behind the attack.
They have discovered that the sun functions based on the same basic principles as other stars: It has been found that the activity of all stars in the system is driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing else.
To determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow, both luminosity and rotation are taken into account.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in terms of reversed magnetic field configurations.

The work was largely theoretical in nature, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius Galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and causes the tides, the Milky Way also exerts gravitational forces on the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy.
The scientists concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter resides in a sort of halo around a galaxy and consists of many small particles.

Extremely drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB) was discovered by Dr. Tony Moll in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant is "extremely worrying and alarming due to its very high mortality rate."
Dr. Moll suggests that some patients may have contracted the pathogen in the hospital, and at least two were medical hospital staff.
Within one year, an infected person can infect 10 to 15 close contacts.
Nevertheless, the proportion of XDR-TB in the entire group of people with tuberculosis appears to be low; 6,000 out of a total of 330,000 people who were infected in South Africa at some point in time.

"Its thermal behavior is not as uniform as that of large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with it being deep holes in the ground," said Glen Cushing of the Astrogeology Team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, casting a vote is traditionally a low-tech experience: Voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper with the candidate of their choice written on it into an envelope.
After the officials have confirmed the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
The French electoral law lays down the process quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can attest that at the beginning of the election, no envelopes are present and that no envelopes are inserted, except those of properly counted and authorized voters.
Candidates can send representatives who can attend every part of the process as witnesses. In the evening, the votes will be counted by volunteers under strict supervision and according to special procedures.

Their first event was the slalom, in which she received a "Did not Finish" in her first run. 36 of the 116 participants achieved the same result in this race.
She finished her other race, the giant slalom, in 10th place in the women's group with a combined run time of 4:41.30. This was 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Lösch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary, who finished ninth.
Four para-alpine skiers did not finish the race, and 45 of the 117 female skiers in the giant slalom did not place in the competition.
The police of Madhya Pradesh have recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and her mobile phone and laptop have been seized."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanja, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police commissioner Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident had occurred was temporarily closed while the emergency services freed the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially admitted to the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was meanwhile charged at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court with the murder of her son.
She remains in pre-trial detention pending indictment and trial, but eyewitness accounts could be unreliable, as her image has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in Great Britain, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts have deemed the publication of photos potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes: "Journalists seem to be crossing a dangerous line when they publish photos, etc., of suspects."
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is leading the prosecution, has indicated to journalists that no further comments will be made until at least the indictment.
According to the leak, the document refers to the border dispute in which Palestinians are demanding a return to the borders as they existed before the Six-Day War of 1967.
Other topics that are supposedly covered include the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a military presence in the Jordan Valley for ten years following the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is only willing to accept such a presence for five years.
The shooters participating in the accompanying experiment to contain the plague should be closely supervised by rangers, as the experiment is being monitored and its effectiveness is being evaluated.
As part of a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the managing director of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the first hunting operation received comprehensive safety and training.
Martelly swore in a new provisional election commission (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP within four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to steer the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread regime-critical protests that began in October.
The trigger for the sometimes violent protests was the failure to hold elections, some of which have been pending since 2011.
Over 60 cases of overheating in defective iPods have been reported. A total of six fires were triggered as a result, and four people sustained minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) stated that it was aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that it had been informed by Apple of over 34 further overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable."
The earthquake shook Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Office of Disaster Prevention said no damage has been reported in the territory.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center had also announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at the tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and there are currently at least six confirmed deaths.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released early, as were the Filipino photographers.
The photographers took the seat of an elderly woman when she had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a medical career.
He trained as an obstetrician and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work at the hospital, Liggins began to study premature labor in his free time.
His research showed that the application of a hormone accelerated lung maturation in the fetus.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. Very unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels made the following comment: "Luna was just as crazy as I was... maybe even crazier... I love her and will miss her... hopefully she is in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal elections in 2010, the proportion of those who are against Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the campaign for the 2010 federal election that, in her opinion, Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those surveyed share this view and want Elisabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
29 percent of respondents indicated that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle, as well as three medley relays, at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his numerous complaints.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome his pain because it is banned at the Commonwealth Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number.
Numerous people confirmed the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water for Earth, along with organic material that can form proteins and enable life.
Since comets collided with the Earth a long time ago, scientists hope to gain insights into how planets, especially Earth, formed.
Cuomo (53) took office as governor earlier this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he might run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, save millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reduce carbon emissions.
It relies on satellite-based technology instead of the older ground radar-based technology to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and to provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation will be set up, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley. There are no parking spaces or Park-and-Ride facilities available on site.
Concern about insufficient transportation options increased the likelihood that the game would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science reported the emergence of a new bird species on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden reported that the new species had evolved in just two generations, despite previous assumptions that this process would take much longer due to the interbreeding between a native Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the introduced cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be processed into a wide variety of forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and braided. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be manufactured very thinly and glued onto other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate hand-painted images, called miniature paintings, in books that are also called miniature paintings.
This is what is called the pH value of a chemical. One can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or basic (alkaline).
The pH level indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the tested chemicals.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then shape them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, which feels strange and forms a kind of protective layer.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remnants of wastewater systems were found in the houses of the Minoan cities on Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were toilets. In Roman culture, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, which men and women visited in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, then use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was launched into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and our view somewhat.
A gigantic rocket with a height of more than 100 feet is needed to shoot a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an unbelievable way. The greatest service the wheel has rendered us is much simpler and faster transportation.
The railway, the car, and many other modes of transport have brought us this.
Among them are medium-sized cats that prey on medium-sized animals, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are still many small cats (including free-roaming domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to her success is the concept of the niche, a specific task that every cat has and which ensures that it doesn't compete with others.
Lions are the most social cats. They live in large groups called prides.
The packs consist of one to three related adult males, as well as up to thirty females and juveniles.
Women usually have a close relationship with each other when they live in a large family with sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave similarly to wolf or dog packs, animals that surprisingly resemble lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior and are equally deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (though not particularly well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger doesn't sound like the full-throated roar of a lion, but rather like a series of growling, shouted words.
Ocelots eat small animals. When they can, they prey on monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are significantly smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to track and locate prey. They sniff out where their prey has been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision and move unnoticed. Ocelots hunt their prey by visually blending into their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
If a small group of organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population it originated from (e.g. if it migrates over a mountain range or a river or if it colonizes a new island so that it cannot easily return), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor than what it needed before.
The original population has changed not at all. It still needs the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, and it then becomes increasingly dissimilar to the other population.
After thousands or even millions of years, two populations may then look so different that they can no longer be classified as the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants generate oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce their food through the sun via photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses from plants and make clothing from plants. We mainly subsist on plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, and therefore feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
Its long jaws were equipped with more than 70 razor-sharp teeth, plus another set in the palate, which meant there was no escape for any animal that crossed its path.
We're not sure for certain, but he may have had a forked tongue. He fed on turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and may have even been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that came into the water; even a large dinosaur like the T. Rex was no match for him.
While most of their food is likely familiar to us, the Romans did have their share of strange or unusual feasts, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called the dormouse.
Another difference was that the poor people and women ate their food sitting on chairs. The wealthy men, on the other hand, preferred to hold joint banquets where they lay on their sides while eating their meals.
Dishes in ancient Rome could not contain foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
Offerings were made to the gods, and the priests attempted to appease the gods' will through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary that was only to be entered by priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses were not given such great importance.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard. Shops simply consisted of counters open to the street. Stone was used for house construction.
In the Land of Canaan, there were no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to Old Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder. As he continued to travel west, he discovered Greenland and named it as such.
However, regardless of their discovery, Inuit tribes had already lived there at that time.
Although all the countries were "Scandinavian," there were many differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the film "The Legacy of the Knights Templar," you might think that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's not correct, however. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776" written. The text is located upside down on the underside of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment document (which measures 29¾ inches x 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning of its life.
So it is possible that the note was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
He was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who, in 1940, had made peace with the Germans and worked with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies landed in Southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
After only two weeks, the Americans and the French liberation troops had liberated the south of France and turned towards Germany.
A civilization is an independent culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together, forming a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," related to the Latin "civis," which means "citizen," and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and which also defines the size of a society in some way.
City-states are the precursors of nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and appropriate dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as proper civilizations.
During the revolutionary wars, the 13 states initially formed a weak central government based on the Articles of Confederation, consisting only of the Congress.
The Congress was not authorized to levy taxes, and since there was neither a national executive nor a national judiciary, it relied on the state authorities to enforce all of its laws, which often did not cooperate.
He also lacked the authority to override state tax laws and customs duties between states.
The articles required the unanimous consent of all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful in the world and was FIFA World Champion in 2006.
Popular sports include soccer (football), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 motorsport.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians participate in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (of which Honshu is the largest), making it the seventh-largest island in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands, Japan is frequently referred to geographically as an "archipelago."
Taiwan's history dates back to the 15th century, when European seafarers passed by and documented the island's name as Ilha Formosa, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company founded a settlement in southwestern Taiwan, thereby initiating a change in the indigenous people's grain cultivation methods and employing Chinese workers on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, forces of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) took control of Taiwan's western and northern coastal regions and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu mainly consists of three structures, namely the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex were rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most widely used still image format worldwide is 35 mm, which corresponds to the prevailing film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, its image format has been adopted from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
Strictly speaking, the so-called 35mm format measures 36 mm wide and 24 mm high.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest integer ratio) is thus described as 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the APS format family, for example) have exactly the same or a very similar aspect ratio.
The much-maligned and often mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while also preserving a degree of order in an image.
She states that the intersection point of the lines that divide an image vertically and horizontally is the most effective place for the main motif (see example).
During this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion had held the European states together despite their different languages and customs.
His omnipotence governed everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the important Christian tenets states that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that this is precisely why churches have financial resources.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years. This concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved effective in isolating the country from vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violated generally recognized international law, which had been codified in numerous international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from penetrating entire sea areas, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic had been limited, Germany expected a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, pacifism and isolationism were the prevailing attitudes of most citizens and countries.
After the experience of the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid another such situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States of America to take a position at the Edison Company in New York City.
He came to the USA with 4 cents to his name, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his superior at his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of denoting different eras. Each period in Chinese history and every ruling family was a dynasty in its own right.
Between the individual dynasties, there were also periods of instability and divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
In these times, bitter wars raged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the highest throne in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are a lot of social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, a move away from absolutism towards republicanism and nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, all professions were open to all male applicants, allowing the most ambitious and best candidates to succeed.
The same applies to the military, because instead of being based on social class, the army's ranking lists now depended on gun caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many oppressed people of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was very interested in things that went beyond everyday life. He often visited a cave known as "Hira" on the mountain of "Nur" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself has endured the ages and offers a vivid picture of Mohammed's spiritual inclinations.
The cave is located at the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, she is not at all easy to find, even if you know that she exists. Once you are in the cave, you are completely isolated.
You see nothing but the clear, beautiful sky above and the numerous surrounding mountains. From inside the cave, very little of this world is visible or audible.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings comprises several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Cheops, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected in honor of Cheops' wives and family members.
The "addition" symbol looks like a V and the "subtraction" symbol like a parenthesis or a square with the bottom stroke missing.
Moving upwards means you start at the top and should pull the bow back. Moving downwards means you start at the frog (that's where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Applying the varnish typically generates a softer sound, while wiping it on is more powerful and expressive.
You are welcome to add your own pencil markings; however, please remember that the printed page markings are located there for musical reasons and should generally be respected.
King Louis XIV, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a mob of market women in Versailles on October 6, 1789, to return to Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a screaming mob of people shouting threats against the King and Queen.
The mob forced the king and queen to open the windows of their carriages wide.
At some point, a member of the enraged crowd paraded the head of a royal guard killed in Versailles before the horrified queen.
The war expenses of the US imperialists during the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the U.S. to cover the bulk of the expenses, and the interest from bonds flowed through the banks of Wall Street in the name of the Philippine government.
Of course, the superprofits stemming from the ongoing exploitation of the Filipino people represented the basic profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that led to the founding of the Order.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, an era in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, followed by the Late Middle Ages, which unanimously ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a wide range of ideas in practice, from technology push or the technological imperative to the strict sense that human destiny is determined by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas. Firstly, that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely lies beyond cultural or political influence, and secondly, that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are more inherent than socially conditioned.
One can claim that the passenger car inevitably brings about the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for just a small number of cars. Therefore, new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs of car ownership.
The widespread ownership of automobiles also leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn drives the invention of new techniques in healthcare for repairing damaged bodies.
The Romantic movement had a strong, culturally deterministic element, drawing on writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, it was geography that shaped individuals. Over time, customs and cultures arose in relation to this geography, and these, being in harmony with the societal placement, were better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, so Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined throughout the 12th century, primarily due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were considered more valuable than the offerings of the Byzantine markets.
At this time, the title of fashion capital of the world shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the clothing was strongly influenced by the culture of Byzantium in the East.
However, the styles in the West lag 25 to 30 years behind due to slow communication channels.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe gradually began to develop its own style. One of the most important developments of the time was that, as a result of the Crusades, people started using buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture that aims to produce just enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic cultivation method that utilizes saved, locally adapted seeds and combines it with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
In the past, most farmers practiced subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring like-minded people together who feel neglected by societal norms, and enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differentiate themselves from others in terms of the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that distinguish a subculture as such can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, or geographical in nature, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their affiliation through a distinctive and symbolic style that encompasses fashion, habits, and jargon.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the importance of socialization is to rely on the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their childhood, were not socialized by adults.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were kept captive by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, the neglect of the child was due to the parents' inability to accept the child's significant intellectual or physical limitations.
Wolf children may have experienced severe child abuse or traumatic experiences before being abandoned or running away.
Others are said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived alone in the wilderness.
If a child is raised completely by animals, the feral child exhibits behaviors (within the limits of its physical capabilities) that are almost entirely in accordance with those of its specific foster animal, such as its fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make the learning process simpler and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
Scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather an aid that supports individuals in a novel learning situation, such as when using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, as is the small bracket in Microsoft Office.
Virtual aids are integrated into the software and are intended to question, suggest, and explain work steps that students may not be able to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to exploitation.
No child should be forced to grow up in an environment that is not caring, loving, and education-oriented, but many are forced to do so.
For us, the system of care accommodation is a measure of security for these children.
Our foster family system aims to provide a safe home, loving caregivers, a stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The foster home should cover all the needs that the animal didn't receive in the home it was taken from.
The internet connects both elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The specific peculiarities of the internet have led to additional dimensions regarding the utility and reward approach.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are presented as important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and "lasting relationships" were also identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings led to important insights for interpreting microexpressions, facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that one can tell if someone is lying by correctly interpreting minimal changes in facial expression.
In his article "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrated how people who have lost the ability to understand language due to brain damage can still accurately assess the honesty of others.
He even claims that the ability to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research in the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation causes new genetic variations, and selection removes these from the pool of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle the variation between the two pools back and forth with each generation.
Out in the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs from available plant sources.
Furthermore, it has severe consequences if one neglects it: growth retardation, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would have been the proteins in leaves and legumes, but these are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
In contrast, animal-based food sources (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide large amounts of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Overall, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of targeted awakening during normal sleep periods and falling back asleep shortly afterwards (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you're someone who snoozes the alarm clock in your sleep, you can put it on the other side of the room, so you're forced to get out of bed to turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based approach is to drink a lot of fluids (especially water or tea known for its diuretic effect) before bed, forcing you to get up to urinate.
The degree of inner peace a person possesses correlates inversely with the degree of tension in body and mind.
The less tension there is, the more positive the existing life force is. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can attain enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but has been expanded by the path of loving-kindness of Mahayana and numerous techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing compassion.
Kundalini yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
At the center of Tibetan meditation lies Deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are opened, and enlightened consciousness arises.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, the clash of systems, the course of events, and culture led the countries to become adversaries.
Two years after the end of the war, the former Allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It was expected to last for the next 40 years and would in reality be fought by proxy armies on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already completely collapsed, and the only hope lay in a retreat and regrouping along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union invaded the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts and created them, having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties.
The use of ships for freight transport is by far the most efficient method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The Navy's traditional task was to ensure that a country remained capable of transporting people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's ability to transport people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this is the Battle of the Atlantic in World War II. The Americans attempted to transport personnel and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop this traffic mainly with submarines.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain just as it did the rest of Europe.
Goats were apparently domesticated approximately 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them as livestock to easily obtain their milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Goats were usually kept in herds that roamed on hills or other pastureland. The goats were tended by goat herders, much like the more familiar sheep herders; often these were children or young people. These grazing methods are still used today.
As early as the 16th century, railway tracks were built in England.
Although the railway tracks were made of only parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled the wagons to reach higher speeds and haul heavier loads than on the somewhat rougher roads of that time.
Bolsters were introduced quite early on to secure the position of the rails. However, the realization gradually took hold that rails supporting a band of iron are more efficient.
This became common, but the iron caused more wear on the wooden wheels of the carts.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were introduced.
The first known method of locomotion was walking. Humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means "upright man").
Their predecessors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright as regularly.
Bipedal species are found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can live more environmentally friendly, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to alleviate future suffering somewhat.
That is often merely symptomatic treatment. However, if you don't just want temporary solutions, then we should find and treat the root of the problem.
It is really obvious that the world has changed a great deal due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and that problems stemming from overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people have become more serious.
After its approval by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few blocks away to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the course of the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
John Nixon gave the first public reading of the document in the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had it read aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25 remaining Dunlap broadsides are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The original manuscript did not survive the ages.
Many paleontologists believe today that there is a group of dinosaurs that survived and still live today. We call them birds.
Many don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, many things about birds still look like those of a dinosaur.
They have feet with scales and claws, lay eggs, and walk on both hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the processing of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, to use computer jargon.
An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. The symptoms, for example vomiting, are so general that a diagnosis cannot be made immediately.
The best sign of ingestion poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
Look on the label for specific first aid instructions for this particular poison.
The term "Wanze" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term originates from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs. These are insects that are very adaptable in parasitizing humans.
Both assassin bugs and bed bugs are nidicolous, i.e., adapted to living in the nest or dwelling of their hosts.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the most prevalent neurological disease in adults of younger and middle age.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their own interest or in the interest of their child to raise a baby.
These couples can decide on an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents give up their parental rights, allowing another couple to assume parenthood.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works with the help of the scientific method. This method is indeed the basis of most scientific investigations.
However, it's not just about experimentation, where an experiment is a test designed to rule out one or more of the possible hypotheses. Scientific research is also guided by posing questions and conducting observations.
Natural scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were respected.
The West was cut off from its philosophical and scientific roots in Greece with the loss of Greek language skills.
Many observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often depend largely on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Behavioral patterns determined by cycles, which are not merely reactions to signals of external cycles, are known in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to oscillate for a while, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the key pieces of evidence that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to insert their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they either labeled the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or a protein in the phage with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a wide range of effects, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected piece of genetic material, and whether the cells in question are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations elsewhere can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including wild plants and animals.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and studying orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave small provincial towns by car to go to their workplaces and are passed by others whose workplace is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shuttle traffic, everyone is in a way connected to a transport system based on the private car and supports it.
Science is now pointing out that this massive carbon cycle has pushed the biosphere out of one of its stable states, which has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone complains about the transport systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear about as many complaints regarding water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems lead to such problems, why do they fail daily? Are civil engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental going on here?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that take place between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flows is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with absolute certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently; therefore, traffic flows exhibit a certain constancy and can be represented mathematically in a rough way.
To better represent traffic flow, the relationships between the three most important characteristics were defined: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships aid in the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the sky. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects can fold their wings along their body.
This allows them to have a wider selection of small hiding places where they can hide from predators.
Today, dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects that cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the sun was at the center of the movements of the solar system.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite: that the solar system, including the sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, as it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second-longest and the most water-rich river in the world. It carries more than eight times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river in the world, in some places up to six miles wide.
A whole 20 percent of the water that flows from the planet's rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
Egyptians in the ancient New Kingdom marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then about a thousand years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian for its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work in the state, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper have been known to humans since antiquity, as they can all be found in their original form in nature and mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that all things consist of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This corresponded more to the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. However, he also put forward the theory that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are other metals too, like silver and gold.
There are also alloys that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
The universe, in its entirety, consists of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so tiny that trillions of them could fit into the period at the end of this sentence.
Consequently, after its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the pencil has faded into the background with the rise of newer writing methods, resulting in a decline in its status and use.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever having to go near a pencil sharpener.
One can be curious to see what will become of the keyboard when something newer comes along.
The atomic bomb is based on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Approximately like rolling a heavy cart uphill. If the core splits again, a part of this energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they decay even with slight or no impact.
The surface of the Moon consists of rock and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner in the valleys and thicker in the highlands.
On the near side, there might be more Maria because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Substantive theories focus on finding what motivates or appeals to people.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that are internalized throughout their development into adulthood.
These theories deal with what motivates certain people to want exactly what they do, and what influences in their environment lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular content theories are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is the attempt to "stay one of the guys" (or one of the girls).
This type of manager has trouble making unpopular decisions, administering disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who must do everything differently than the team did and appropriates everything for themselves.
Ultimately, the team leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to discord between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are led to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have more autonomy than traditional team members, as their teams may convene in different time zones that local management may not take into account.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"The "invisible team" is the leadership team that each member reports to. The invisible team sets the standards for every member."
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of implementing a learning organization? A goal for the practical implementation of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are effectively utilized across all departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
As a result, the collaborative work of an organization in overcoming an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative approach that addresses customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must develop a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum concept as a method to help organizations become more effective.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to studying cognition. Thus, they narrow the scope of research and make it considerably more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, such as trauma, injuries, and tumors, influence behavior and lead to changes in some brain functions.
Emerging technologies allow us, for the first time, to see and explore certain brain structures and processes.
This provides us with a lot of information and materials to build simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although AI is strongly associated with science fiction, it is an important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of AI encompasses the creation of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of this include control, developing strategies and schedules, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become autonomous disciplines focused on finding solutions to real-life problems.
The AI system is being used increasingly today in sectors such as economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and has also been integrated into numerous software applications for home computers and video games.
Excursions are an important part of every school class. It's not uncommon for a teacher to want to take their students to places that are not accessible by bus.
Virtual excursions represent a technological solution. Students can view museum pieces, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art from the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also a great way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, students at the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the previous versions remain online and serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also contribute to improving students' writing skills. While students often have sloppy grammar and spelling at the beginning of their blogging experience, this usually changes when there is an audience.
Since students are often a very critical audience, the blog author makes an effort to improve their writing style in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging "also compels students to learn more about the world around them." The need to pique the audience's interest inspires students to write cleverly and engagingly (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to continue learning far beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can empower students to become more analytical and critical; through actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of others' texts and present their own perspectives on specific topics" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming, bilingual capital and is distinguished by a number of art galleries and museums that present Canada's past and present.
Further south are the Niagara Falls, and to the north, the unspoiled beauty of nature extends across Muskoka and beyond.
All these things and more characterize Ontario as what outsiders typically consider typical Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
A population comparison that surprises many: There are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and, when it comes to wildlife, a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or belong to France and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam into the country, and it was very successful in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese seafarer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region is bordered by the Sahel zone, and in the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers claim to be married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring can also be helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what they would consider harassment, and that it is not uncommon to be followed, have your arm grabbed, etc.
Be consistent when you reject men, and don't hesitate to defend your position (cultural differences or not; that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The present-day Casablanca was founded in the 10th century before the Common Era by Berber fishermen and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merinid dynasty as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar el Beida, and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather goods, water pipes, and a whole range of tinnef, but that's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's roads, particularly the downtown area.
While Goma is relatively safe, any stay outside of Goma should be carefully planned to be aware of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking tours in Africa.
You can use Bodabodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is around 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
This, in combination with its relative inaccessibility, has made "Timbuktu" a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although Timbuktu is considered a tourist attraction and has an airport due to its reputation, it is a impoverished city nowadays.
In 1990, it was added to the list of endangered World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the most important segments of Louis Gates' PBS special "Wonders of the African World".
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has more of an Arab than an African flair.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa. It borders Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each of which supports a different fauna.
It is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, the park charges daily conservation and entrance fees.
It may also be worthwhile to buy a Wild Card, which grants access to either selected parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the namesake of the territory of Hong Kong and is a focal point for many tourists.
The buildings that make up the Hong Kong skyline were compared with a dazzling bar chart, made visible by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best views of Hong Kong, you should leave the island and drive to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development is densely concentrated on newly reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is the place that the British colonists made their own. If you are looking for traces of the area's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the world's largest mangrove forest, extending over 80 km from the hinterlands of Bangladesh and India to the coast.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The part of the forest that lies within Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they also encompass some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungle that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The Sundarbans stretch over an area of 3,850 km², one-third of which is covered by water and marshes.
The Sundarbans have been a nature reserve since 1966, and estimates suggest that around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 spotted deer now reside there.
Buses run all day from the district-wide bus station (on the other side of the river), with most buses, especially those heading east and towards Jakar/Bumthang, departing between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the buses are often full between districts, it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses that are comfortable and stable.
Ride-sharing taxis offer a fast and convenient way to reach nearby locations such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Their two towers are 83 meters high, their length is 378 meters, and they have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The bridge clearance is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017. It is expected that the Brazilian customs checkpoints will be completed by then.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous group inhabiting present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was also home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the Grand Province of West India, emerged in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the Las Cañitas Polo Fields.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be viewed at other times of the year here.
Information about competitions and points of sale for polo match tickets can be found at the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to the value of the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located across from the FIC West Store in Stanley.
The British pound is generally accepted everywhere on the islands and with Stanley credit cards. US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the remote islands, although British and US currency may be accepted; inquire in advance with the owners about which payment method is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange the currency of the Falkland Islands outside of the islands themselves, so you should exchange money before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics. In the summer months, temperatures above +30 °C are typical.
Winter can be deceptively cool: Temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but wind and humidity make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There are no distinct rainy or dry seasons: The amount of precipitation remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife is still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authority's instructions, visitors are required to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful bison, wapiti, elk, bears, and practically all large animals may appear, they can still attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep a sufficient distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them enough space.
Also be aware that smells can attract bears and other wildlife. So avoid carrying or cooking strongly scented food, and make sure to keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital city of the island of Upolu in Samoa and has a population of just under 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1750s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The harbor was the setting for a disgraceful standoff between the navies in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All ships with the exception of a British cruiser were sunk. Almost 200 Americans and Germans perished.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau Movement, a peaceful assembly in the city led to the killing of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
Since Auckland extends over two harbors, there are many beaches. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) lie on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of them are sandy beaches with safe swimming opportunities, and most offer shade provided by Pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located on the harbor of Waitemata, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
There are family beaches that are sometimes overcrowded, with a beautiful promenade along the coast. Swimming is safe here.
The most important local beer is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to drink, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might be more digestible.
The local tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but if you're concerned, you can easily find bottled water as well.
The idea of a "Flat White" is foreign to Australians. A "Black Coffee" is "Espresso," cappuccino is topped generously with cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips to the reef take place throughout the year, and injuries due to any of these causes on the reef are rare.
Nevertheless, you should follow the advice of authorities, observe all signs, and pay particular attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths north of 1770 from October to April. They can occasionally also occur outside of this period.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the sea; their primary habitat is in river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
A reservation in advance gives the traveler the assurance that they will have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can also book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agency.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to and from the airport, or even a combination of flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need time to reconsider the offer or to obtain further documents for your destination (e.g., visas).
However, any changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the vast majority of visitors decide to camp on site, and most attendees consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you need to arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that music will continue to be played on some parts of the festival late into the night, even after the music on the main stages has stopped.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location, as breaking through ice causes a rather terrifying noise for those most affected.
The cruises to St. Petersburg also offer time to spend in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions).
Casinos generally make a strong effort to keep guests on the premises for as long as possible and to encourage them to spend a lot of money. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are sometimes difficult to find.
They typically have a special offer of food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests happy and ensure they stay.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages free of charge. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good players know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone who wants to drive in high altitudes or over mountain passes should expect snow, ice, and temperatures below freezing.
On icy and snowy roads, traction is poor and you shouldn't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, so much snow can fall in a very short time that you can get stuck.
Visibility can also be impaired by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic largely continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safaris are perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the highlight for many visitors.
In common language, the term "safari" refers to a land trip to observe the overwhelming African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars closely, and the standard equipment allows for good visibility.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are often shy, and you can observe them better with binoculars.
A foot safari (also called a "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of a hike that lasts from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held at other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Olympic Summer Games, having previously been the venue for the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but most cancellation policies did not apply until July 2020 due to the coronavirus, which was the planned date for the Olympic Games.
It is assumed that most tickets for the event will cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with an average ticket costing around 7,000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels lend out irons and ironing boards, even if you're not in the room.
If no iron is available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't get too hot (this could cause it to shrink or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various methods for purifying water. Some of these prove to be more effective in counteracting certain hazards.
In some areas, it's enough to boil water for a minute, while in others it needs to be several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies greatly, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that they are unfamiliar with from their home regions.
Pests can destroy food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, administer toxins, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases as such, or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people, are usually not classified as pests.
Duty-free shopping is the opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from duties and consumption taxes in certain places.
Travelers whose destination country has high taxation can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The section between Point Marion and Fairmount on Highway Buffalo-Pittsburgh is arguably the biggest driving challenge, as it frequently leads through remote, undeveloped terrain.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be careful: steep descents, narrow lanes, and sharp curves are prevalent here.
The speed limits indicated are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and their strict observance is even more important than usual.
Interestingly, the mobile phone coverage here is much better than in many other areas of the track, for example, the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German baked goods are quite delicious. In Bavaria, they are quite rich and varied, as are those of the southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit pastries are widely popular, with apples being used in pastries year-round and cherries and plums being used in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, or other nuts. Popular cakes often go particularly well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want to make small but rich pastries, then try what is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A curry is a dish based on herbs and spices, together with either meat or vegetables.
A curry can be either "dry" or "saucy" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the interior of North India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in South India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a great diversity of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if the term is used without further attributes, it generally refers to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, which is now widespread throughout the island group, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The Javanese people prefer to use peanuts, chilies, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar) and a range of aromatic spices as flavor enhancers.
Stirrups are aids for the rider's feet that hang down on both sides of the saddle.
They provide the rider with more stability, but there are safety concerns because the rider's feet could potentially get caught in them.
If a rider falls from the horse and gets their foot caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged along if the horse walks on. To keep this risk as low as possible, a number of safety precautions can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, rather narrow sole.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety billets that allow a stirrup strap to fall off the saddle if it is pulled backward by a falling rider.
The Cochamó Valley – Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite National Park of South America, with a variety of large granite walls and cliffs.
The peaks offer a breathtaking view. Climbers from all over the world repeatedly discover new routes along the walls, which offer endless possibilities.
Downhill sports like skiing and snowboarding are popular sports where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and descend a snow-covered slope.
Skiing is a popular travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes also known as "skiholics," who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old – cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
The origins of downhill skiing as a sport date back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861, the first recreational ski club in Australia was opened by Norwegians.
Ski touring with a backpack: This activity is also called ski touring or ski hiking.
It resembles alpine touring or mountaineering, but doesn't necessarily include these, as the latter are performed on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Consider the ski route as a comparable hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you are able to cover somewhat larger distances than when hiking – only very rarely will you achieve the speed of cross-country skiing on well-maintained trails without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but it has numerous independent countries. Normally, you would have to apply for multiple visas and go through several passport checks if you wanted to travel through several countries.
However, the Schengen Area functions in this regard a bit like a country.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can usually cross the borders without having to go through passport control again.
Accordingly, you do not need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen member states individually with a Schengen visa, which saves time, money, and bureaucracy.
There is no universally accepted definition of what manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define goods over 100 years old as antiques.
The definition shows geographical variations, where the age limit may be lower in regions like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products could be described as "antique," even though they are younger than similar products from mass production.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sámi people, and the culture surrounding trade is also significant for many who work in other professions.
Even in the past, not all Sámi people bred reindeer on a large scale, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities. They mainly kept reindeer as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.
Even though the term "Gypsy" is primarily used by non-Roma people, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If a travel advisory is issued for the country you will be visiting, your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance may be affected.
You can also consult the advice of other governments besides your own. However, their suggestions are tailored to their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may be confronted with different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Consultations are merely a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The views presented are often superficial, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information that can be found elsewhere.
Severe weather is the umbrella term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, severe social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are various types of it that depend on the geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and wildfires are forms and consequences of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and whirlwinds.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include, among others, blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and dust storms.
Travelers are strongly warned to pay attention to any kind of severe weather that affects their area, as this can impact all travel plans.
Anyone planning to travel to a country considered a war zone should undergo professional training for it.
An internet search for "course on hostile environments" will likely display the address of a local company.
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, typically in combination with practical experience.
A course is typically between 2 and 5 days long and includes role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid training, and sometimes weapons training.
There are numerous books and journals on wilderness survival, but only a few publications on war zones.
Travelers planning gender-affirming surgery abroad must ensure they have valid identification documents for their return journey.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with no specified gender (X) or documents updated with the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to recognize these documents is also very varied.
Security checks have also become much more intrusive since the events of September 11, 2001.
Transgender people before their surgery should not expect their privacy and dignity to remain intact while passing through scanners.
Rip currents are the returning flow of water from waves that have broken near the shore, often found near reefs or similar structures.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates in a few deeper areas, and a rapid current can form there even in deep water.
Most deaths occur due to exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can prove impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than normal.
Try to get somewhere you won't be caught again. Alternatively, depending on your abilities and whether you've been noticed, you might as well wait for rescue.
The reverse culture shock comes earlier than the culture shock (the honeymoon phase isn't as pronounced), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who found it easy to adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When one returns home after a stay abroad, one has adapted to a different culture and shed some of the behaviors of one's home culture.
When you traveled abroad for the first time, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers have to adjust to a new country.
One might not expect that patience and understanding are also required when dealing with returning travelers.
The sound and light show at the pyramids is one of the most interesting attractions for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the darkness and while it's quiet, before the show begins.
Normally, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of the sounds and the light is just like a storybook.
The Sphinx is used as a backdrop and narrator for a long story.
The scenes are depicted on the pyramids, with the different pyramids being illuminated.
The Southern Shetland Islands, which were discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most stations. In 2020, sixteen were active.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
Further islands are Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of a still active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the peninsula, bounded by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula transition into a plateau here and then rise again to form the 360 km-long Ellsworth Mountains range, which is bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or the Sentinel Range, holds the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, whose highest peak, Mount Vinson, reaches a height of 4892 m.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be the only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors and have a clear line of sight to a satellite to make a call.
The service is frequently used by ships, including pleasure boats, as well as by expeditions that require data and voice communication links.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide further information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for people planning to take a year off is studying and taking courses abroad.
This is particularly popular with high school graduates, as it allows them to take a year off before university without affecting their studies.
In many cases, participating in a gap year abroad program can actually improve your chances of pursuing higher education in your home country.
Generally, there is a tuition fee for registering for these educational programs.
Finland is a wonderful destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands – in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht for the archipelagos and lakes.
Even though the coastal island groups and the largest lakes are actually big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is the national pastime in Finland; one in six or eight people owns a boat.
While this is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, it's otherwise quite unique (the ratio is, for example, one to forty in the Netherlands).
Most purely Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historic city for several full days, returning in the evenings to spend the night on the ship.
If you only go ashore as part of organized shore excursions, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises promote Berlin, Germany as a destination in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Air travel can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and from all walks of life, especially for those who have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
There's no need to be ashamed of that: It's nothing more than the personal fears and antipathies that many people have.
Learning more about how airplanes work and the procedures during a flight can help some people overcome the fear that is associated with the unknown or the feeling of having no control.
Courier companies are well paid for the fast delivery of things. Often, time is a very important factor when it comes to company documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies use their own aircraft, but difficulties arose on other routes and with smaller companies.
When they shipped things via air freight, unloading and customs clearance could take several days on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster was to ship it as lost luggage. Airline regulations do not allow luggage to be sent without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly First or Business Class is to shell out a lot of money for the privilege (or, even better, to get your own company to cover the costs).
That's not cheap, though: As a rough guideline, you can expect to pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class and eleven times the normal economy fare for first class!
Generally, it's pointless to even look for discounts on Business or First Class seats on direct flights from A to B.
The airlines are very well aware that there is a specific core group of flyers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving at their destination quickly and comfortably, and they demand accordingly high prices.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but many people also speak Russian.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any UN member state.
Despite the failure of the political negotiations, economic relations between these two parts of the Republic of Moldova were able to be restored.
The most important religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third-largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second-largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
The once ancient city of Smyrna is today a modern, progressive, and bustling business center situated on a vast bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide boulevards, glass buildings, and modern shopping centers are characterized by classic red-tiled roofs, a 18th-century market, as well as old mosques and churches, although the city radiates an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than that of traditional Turkey.
The village of Haldarsvík offers views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
On the cemetery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on some of the graves.
It's worth strolling through the fascinating village for half an hour.
In the north, in the immediate vicinity, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became known to foreigners after Lord Byron described its splendor in vivid colors.
The Scotturb bus 403 runs regularly between Cabo da Roca and Sintra.
Also visit the large Sanctuary of Our Lady of the Rosary of Fatima (pilgrimage site) in the north – a place world-famous for its Marian apparitions.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass grave and a place that holds almost immeasurable significance for a large portion of the world's population.
Many men and women still live who survived their time here, and many more with relatives who were murdered there or worked themselves to death, Jews and non-Jews alike.
Please treat this site with the dignity, reverence, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Don't deface the site by attaching or scratching graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the inhabitants prefer to speak Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone can speak Spanish.
Most signs are, however, only provided in Catalan, as it is legally established as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely spoken in public transportation and other institutions.
Normal announcements in the metro are exclusively in Catalan, but unforeseen disruptions are reported by an automated system in a variety of languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are said to be egoistic, impolite, and arrogant.
Even though this is often just an inaccurate cliché, you get along best in Paris by presenting your best self and behaving like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make getting by considerably easier.
The Parisians' gruff exterior quickly disappears if you show basic manners.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is heavily wooded, with mainly beech, spruce, and fir trees, and it offers a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to its numerous microclimates, diverse soils, and varying altitudes, it boasts a remarkably high diversity of plant communities.
The area is also home to an extremely large diversity of animal and bird species.
There is rare fauna there, such as European brown bears, wolves, eagles, owls, lynx, wildcats, and black grouse, as well as many species that occur more frequently in general.
When visiting the monasteries, women must wear skirts that reach below the knee and also cover their shoulders.
While most monasteries have wrap skirts available for women who come unprepared, bringing your own, especially one in bright colors, will earn you a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men must wear trousers that go over the knee.
These can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothing is not washed after each user, so you may not feel comfortable in these skirts. There is a one-size-fits-all for all men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like that in similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and always uses olive oil.
A simple and popular dinner, especially in the summer, is Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available ingredient like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, besides the word "Sie" (you), always begin with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and objects.
It probably also makes reading easier, but writing is somewhat difficult because you have to determine whether a verb or adjective is used as a noun.
The Italian pronunciation is relatively simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The most important letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowel.
Also pay attention to pronouncing "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means "dear," whereas "carro" means "chariot."
The Persian language has a relatively simple and largely regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this introductory grammar would help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and understand formulations better.
If you speak a Romance language, it is naturally easier to learn Portuguese.
People who speak some Spanish might prematurely conclude that Portuguese is so similar that it doesn't need to be learned separately.
Pre-modern observatories are usually no longer in operation today and serve as museums or educational centers.
Since light pollution wasn't as problematic during its peak as it is today, they typically are located in cities or on university campuses, which are easier to access than those built in more recent times.
Most modern research telescopes are colossal facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The viewing of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where plum blossoms were the flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom festivals were held by the Emperor only for himself and other members of the nobility within the circle of the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally laid out garden and collect "samples," you will also be thrown out without question.
Singapore is generally a very safe place where you can easily get around and buy almost anything after you arrive.
Since you are located in the extreme tropics and only a few degrees north of the equator, you should expect both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are also a few buses that travel northward to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Make sure that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can provide a good basis for holiday planning.
For example, castle tours in the Loire Valley, in the Rhine Valley, or a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube, or a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also feature popular hiking and cycling routes.
In Christianity, Christmas is one of the most important holidays and is considered the birthday of Jesus.
Many of the traditions surrounding the festival have also been adopted worldwide by non-believers in Christian and non-Christian countries.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night awake in some open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian-theological explanations for this tradition, but it could very well also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday evening, with the celebrations for the congregations often beginning around midnight, where the Resurrection of Christ is celebrated.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands came here either by swimming, flying, or being washed ashore.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to undertake the journey, which made the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal on the Galapagos Islands.
Since the first humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark more or less around the clock.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, you can also enjoy the starry sky.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might be accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, with a focus on group performance rather than praise for individual achievements.
Often, employees have to obtain the approval of their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow their bosses' instructions without question.
