This is a challenging sentence due to its complexity and potential for multiple interpretations. Here's a translation aiming to capture the likely meaning, keeping in mind Umbundu's nuances: "This is how the season passes. The planting of a single seed helps with the growth of a fertile field." **Explanation of Choices:** * "Eci kaykakala ongusiko" - This directly translates to "This is how the season passes". "Eci" is "this", "kaykakala" implies "it passes", "ongusiko" means "season." * "Eyi okuyika kwotembo imwe" - This translates to "The planting of a single seed". "Eyi" refers to "this", "okuyika" means "planting", "kwotembo" is a seed, "imwe" means "one". * "kwenda okwikula kulima wokaliye" - This translates to "helps with the growth of a fertile field." "kwenda" means "helps", "okwikula" means "growth", "kulima" means "field", "wokaliye" means "fertile." **Important Note:** Umbundu, like many African languages, is highly context-dependent. This translation is the most likely interpretation, but a deeper understanding of the specific cultural context would refine it further.

This is a difficult sentence to translate directly due to the specific cultural and linguistic nuances of Umbundu. However, a possible translation is: "This is a serious issue that affects the Gothic heart, and it is greatly felt within the realm of the 10th, 11th, and 14th books." **Explanation of choices:** * **Oku sonehã kumue:** This signifies "This is a serious issue" or "This is a significant problem." "Sonehã" implies seriousness and "kumue" suggests a matter or issue. * **kutukuliha hati gótico:** "Kutukuliha" means "affects" or "impacts." "Hati gótico" refers to "Gothic heart." This is likely metaphorical, representing a core feeling or element. * **kuafetika oku kulihiwa vali enene:** "Kuafetika" means "is greatly felt" or "is strongly experienced." "Kulihiwa" means "felt" or "experienced." "Vali enene" emphasizes the intensity - "greatly" or "very." * **ko tembo yovita 10, 11 kuenda 14:** "Ko tembo yovita" refers to "within the realm of books" or "within the scope of these books". "Yovita" can mean "of" or "belonging to". "10, 11 kuenda 14" are the numbers 10, 11, and 14. **Important Note:** This is an interpretation, and a completely accurate translation would require deeper cultural context. The metaphorical use of "Gothic heart" is particularly challenging without knowing the specific context the speaker is referring to.

It seems to mean "were examined" or "were investigated" but the word order is unusual. * "okuseleka momo kuly ondo yo kuteleka tu sanga vo feka" - This is the most difficult part. "okuseleka momo" likely refers to "left unresolved" or "unresolved cases." "ondo yo kuteleka" seems to describe the reason for the unresolved status, and "tusa nga vo feka" indicates a conclusion or belief based on this. * I've interpreted "feeka" as "unreliable" because it seems to imply the information gathered from those unresolved cases is not trustworthy. **Important Note:** Without more context about the specific Umbundu dialect and the source of the sentence, this translation is an educated approximation. There might be other valid interpretations.
