News reports mention the official toll of deaths at eighty, and official reports confirm that more than 30 have occurred; however, the definitive numbers are not yet known.
Cyanuric acid has been found in the bile of animals that died after seemingly consuming food contaminated with it.
Two components react with each other and form crystals that can block excretory function, according to the university researchers.
I searched and observed the crystals, which were formed in the cat's meow from melamine and cyanuric acid.
The composition of these crystals is similar to that found in the essence of animals when they are compared with the infrared spectrometer (FTIR).
I don't know if you're aware, but many goods from Central America come into this country without paying duty.
Eighty percent of our goods have been seized with documents in the countries of Central America. We will deal with it.
This thing doesn't make any sense; and furthermore, it's not right.
All I'm saying to you is that you treat us the way we treat you.
Governor of California Arnold Schwarzenegger has signed a decree banning the sale of violent video games to minors.
The decree stipulated that violent videos, classified as such by the State of California, must be flagged with an advisory bearing the inscription "18" and their sale is made punishable by a fine of $1000 for each violation.
The Director of Public Prosecutions, Keir Starmer QC, has made a statement this morning announcing the charges against both Huhne and Pryce.
The Huhne has resigned and been replaced in government by Ed Davey MP. Norman Lamb MP is thought to be taking over the ministry for Pensions and Work. Davey has been given the task.
O Huhne and o Pryce are scheduled to appear before Westminster Magistrates' Court on the 16th of February.
I'm sorry to report the deaths of Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old. Cuddeback is suspected of the murder.
Edgar Veguilla had to undergo surgery on his arm and jaw, so much so that Kristoffer Schneider needed reconstructive surgery on his face.
Uka's weapon missed so badly that it ended up hitting a fifth man in the head. Schneider is two feet taller, has one eye, a missing section of his skull, and a titanium reconstruction.
Either Schneider witnessed it via video link from a USAF base in his homeland.
Regarding the event of Tuesday, two individual goats participated in the championships in Carpanedo.
It was either a slalom, where someone got a Did Not Finish in their first run. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the best result in that race.
The other was, or giant slalom, in sight finished in the tenth place into the women's starting group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first placed Austrian Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth placed Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani.
Four skiers in a women's group were unable to finish their race, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom were unable to qualify for the overall standings.
The Madhya Pradesh police recovered the laptop and the stolen phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said: "Emmo arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her phone and laptop."
I accuse myself of being all the Kanjars: Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Superintendent of Police Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared before the court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house, when the car crashed, none of them were hurt.
All my goodness, the driver had a terrible headache.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed, so much so that emergency services were freeing or extracting the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge quite late.
A Adekoya was brought to the Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of having fostered his son.
He is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but the testimonial evidence could be contaminated, it is approved that his image is published where it was taken.
It's a common practice elsewhere within the United Kingdom, but the Scottish justice system functions differently and the courts considered the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee observes that "journalists who tread a dangerous line often publish photos, etc., of suspects."
O Crown Office, which is responsible for criminal proceedings, has instructed the journalists not to make any further comments, not even regarding the indictment.
The document, according to the leak of news, refers to the dispute over borders that Palestine wants to base on the borders before the 1967 war in the Middle East.
The main topics discussed include the future state of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the people of the Valley of the Jordan.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, provided by a signed agreement, so much so that the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow this presence only for five years.
I was told that the supplementary disinfection test had to be strictly supervised by the rangers, so that the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a collaboration between the NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the director in charge of Park Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four teams selected for the first operation this year have received complete safety instructions and training.
Martelly, he has appointed him to a new temporary electoral college (CEP) of nine members.
It's the first CEP of Martelly in four years.
The council passed a presidential commission to recommend and dismiss the previous CEC as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
A commission was established in response to Martelly to the widespread anti-government protests, which began in the suburbs.
And protests, sometimes violent, have been prompted by the lack of proper election conduct, which is due since 2011.
It was reported that a few hundred iPods were overheating, which caused a total of six fires and left four people with minor burns.
Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) Japan, he said to be warned of 27 accidents related to the instrument.
A week ago, METI announced that Apple had reported 34 overheating incidents, which the company is calling "not serious."
The minister responded to the report's delay from Apple with "it should be reproved."
The earthquake occurred in Mariana at 07:19 AM, local time (09:19 AM GMT on Friday).
The office for managing emergencies in the north of Italy has stated that no emergencies were reported in that region.
Also, the Center for Attention for Tsunamis in the Pacific has said that there is no tsunami risk.
A Filipino police officer, while not on duty, took tourists from Hong Kong hostage after taking control of their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Ronaldo Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Varri are hostages in a state of sorrow, and indeed, you are no less in a state of death than those who have died.
You are one of the hostages, among other women and an old man, set free in advance, just like the Filipino photographers.
Late, the photographers took the place of an old woman who was going to the bathroom. Mendoza was shot with firearms.
Either Liggins is already feeling the effects of his past deeds, or he has begun his career in earnest.
She studied obstetrics and began working at Auckland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
So much did he work in the workshop that Liggins has started to study the work of premature babies in his free time.
In his research on fava beans, he saw that if a hormone was administered, it accelerated the fetal respiratory maturation of the chicks.
Xinhua reports that government investigators retrieved data from the "black box" recorders yesterday.
The wrestling companions made a reissued tribute to Luna.
Oh Tommy Dreamer, she said: “The Moon was the first queen of the farthest reaches. My first manager. The Moon has gone away into the night of two moons. Beautiful and unique, just like her. A strong woman.”
Oh Dustin "Goldust" Runnels, he commented that "The moon is strange like me... never more dark... I love her and lose her... hopefully she's in a better place."
In the 2010 federal elections, 1,400 people were surveyed, and those who opposed Australia becoming a republic grew from 8% in 2008.
Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that it was believed Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
About 34 people in this survey share the opinion that Queen Elizabeth II should be the last monarch of Australia.
Of the extreme ends of the survey, 29 percent of those interviewed believed that Australia should become a republic or as soon as possible, while 31 percent think Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his problems with his form, his participation was in doubt.
Oh no, he couldn't have taken it and put it in, because it's needed to overcome his weakness, I'm glad that they were forbidden by the games.
Oh Curtis Cooper, mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, he has discovered the largest prime number known to date as of October 25th.
Well, people have verified the discovery with various hardware and software from the beginning, and it was announced on Monday.
And the dark soil was a source of water. It arrived in the earth together with the same organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets formed, especially how they formed on Earth, when a small object crashed into Earth a long time ago.
Oh Cuomo, 53 years old, he began his governorship at the beginning of this year and last month he signed a law legalizing marriage between people of the same sex.
He/She defined it as "of petty and narrow political factions."
It is hypothesized that he/she/it ran in the 2016 elections. (Note: "o" is a pronoun that can be gender-neutral, and "se" here acts as a reflexive pronoun often used in Ligurian.)
NextGen is a system that aims to support aircraft to fly on shorter routes and save more than 1000 gallons of fuel annually, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
Oh, how satellite technology, in contrast to the old technology based on ground radar, allows them to control air traffic, locate aircraft with greater precision, and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No transport in or out has been put into operation, and overground trains do not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride are not available on-site.
I fear that the transport situation has created the possibility that we will be forced to play games behind closed doors, without the support of the team.
A study, stated in the public journal *Science*, has reported on the formation of a new species of finch on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
I researched at the University of Princeton in the United States and at the University of Uppsala in Sweden regarding the new species that evolved in just two generations, even though it was believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between a Darwin's finch endemic to the Galapagos, *Geospiza fortes*, and the cactus finch immigrant, *Geospiza conirostris*.
The dough can be worked into all sorts of shapes. The dough can be molded into small shapes.
It can be a little difficult, as it's very tangled and confusing. It can be twisted and perplexing. It can be hammered or hit in the midst of leaves.
This little piece was well and truly soldered onto another metal. It was often made of that same metal, which was sometimes used for decoration and images painted by hand in books that are called "miniature manuscripts".
I'm showing you how to test the pH of a chemical substance. You can make an indicator with red beet juice.
The color of the sauce changes with the acidity or alkalinity (chemical product).
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (H in pH) in the tested chemical substance.
The ions of hydrogen are protons that have removed their electrons (meaning that hydrogen atoms are composed of a proton and an electron).
Marrows and dried beans, both wet and dry, rinse them in a basin.
The humidity in the stone walls reacts to the outside air, which feels strange and forms a shimmering film on the surface.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Evidence of ancient pottery has been found in the houses of the smaller cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Public baths existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were often part of public baths where men and women stood together in mixed company.
When it's so far that it's better to have a satellite, it's that you need a satellite.
O satellite, into space, or receive a call, and the air will reflect it, immediately.
Oh satellite, you were sent into space by a rocket. Scientists have sent telescopes into space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts our light and vision.
I don't want a strong cable that's 100 feet long, to send a satellite or a telescope into space.
A lot has changed in the world in a way we can't believe. The most important thing, what we have done for others, is that we have given them easier and faster transport.
It brought the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
In the woods, there are a lot of medium-sized lynx that prey on medium-sized animals, going after rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
In the fields, there are many small cats (domestic cats) that eat very well, many small prey like insects, rodents, lizards, and shrews.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special behavior that every feline adopts, which sets them apart from others.
Ligurian cats are very social and live in large groups, called troops.
A large group was gathered when three men were baptized, along with thirty women and children.
Generally, women are closely related to each other and form a large family of their own and of their children.
The paws of lions act very much like the paws of dogs or cats, surprisingly well suited to their hunting (but not other felines) in behavior, and equally deadly for their prey as well.
From all athletes, a tiger can leap (more than a little), can run, and covers a great distance and does it with five times the strength of a human being.
The tiger is the largest group (Genus Panthera) of lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
Oh, you tiger cub, you are not like a cub with the voice of a lion, but more like a chicken clucking and squawking.
The ocelot likes to eat small animals. They hunt monkeys, hares, rodents, and birds, if they can. All the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than the two beautiful ones.
Scientists have found that ocelots can smell and track prey through the scent, following the trail on the ground where they were.
They went to school for the night vision, and mixed themselves very stealthily as well. The ocelots hunt their prey by blending into their environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main population from which it originates (as if they were mixed across a mountain range or a river, or mixed on a new island, in such a way that one cannot reach the other), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were previously in.
This new environment offers both resources and competing demands, so the new population will need to possess characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what it will need in the future.
The original population hasn't changed for anything, and still needs the greatest adaptations of the past.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to resemble more and more the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even fewer years, the two populations may become so estranged that they could no longer be called the same species.
We are talking about the process of speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
And they make the oxygen that humans breathe, and they release carbon dioxide that humans exhale (meaning, they spew out fire).
And they create their food from their own through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We built our houses with stone and we made clothes with wool. The food we ate was mostly grain. Without stone, and animals could not survive.
The mosasaur was the greatest predator of its time, consequently it was capable of everything, unlike other mosasaurs.
He had long whiskers, curved and with more than 70 teeth as sharp as razors, with a snaggletooth placed into the roof of his mouth, as if he had no escape for anything that crossed or walked through him.
No, we weren't very successful, but he certainly had a strong tongue. His diet included snails, large fish, other shellfish, and he might have even been a cannibal.
It was stirring up everything that entered the water; even a giant dinosaur like the T. Rex could not have battled with it.
To the point that for much of their food they were familiar, the Romans had for their part dishes from the strange or curious feast, like wild boar, peacock, and dormice and a type of rodent called gî.
Another difference was that while the men and women were sitting and eating their food on chairs, the rich had their servants run around where they were welcomed on a bench, so much so that they consumed their meals.
The dishes of ancient Romans did not include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the centuries after.
For example, they didn't have wheat, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever got enough of a drink.
I built in Babylon for each of his elders a principal temple, which he had considered the house of the god.
People used to make sacrifices and the priests sought to satisfy the needs of the gods through ceremonies and festivals.
All the temples had a courtyard with an open temple and then an inner sanctuary, into which could enter only the priests.
Historically, ziggurats, special pyramid-shaped towers, were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the god.
In the climate of the Middle East, the house is not very important.
At first, she came from the life of a Jewish family and used to keep the door open.
And the women were gathering firewood into the courtyard; and the shops were only with small doorways opening onto the street. At first, they had to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. In Norwegian sagas it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But, regardless of their discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at that time.
I know that all the countries are "Scandinavian," but there are big differences between the people, the kings, the customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think a treasure map was written on the back of the "Declaration of Independence."
Do the rest, I won't see it. They know that there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
In the back of the "Declaration of Independence" there are the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776". The text can be seen in the lower part of the document, on the contrary.
I know that no one knows for sure who wrote it; it is said that at the beginning of its life it was a large parchment document (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) and it was folded to be preserved.
So, it's likely that the notation was added only as a label.
The landing in Normandy and the battles that followed had liberated the North of France, but the South was not yet free.
It was governed by the French "of Vichy". You know that the French had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and had collaborated with the invasion, in exchange for fighting.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France. The invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
After the joy of two suns, seven weeks, the Americans and perhaps from France, having liberated Southern France, approved to direct towards Germany.
A civilization is a culture characterized by a significantly large group of people who live and work in a cooperative manner, and it has a society.
The word "civil" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means "civil," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and which in a way also defines the dimension of society.
City-states were precursors to nations. A civil culture allows for the transmission of knowledge across generations, a persistent cultural imprint, and an equitable diffusion.
And so, they are often lacking relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as distinct and original civilizations.
During the revolutionary period, the thirteen states formed, for the first time, a weak central government – with the Congress as the sole component – according to the Statute of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since it had no executive or judiciary, it either submitted to the central authorities, who often didn't cooperate, to ensure all its acts were respected.
They don't even have the authority to annul fiscal laws and tariffs between states.
The Statute required the unanimous consent of all states before it could be amended, and the states never took the central government lightly, so their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national team, is the second most successful team in the world and won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), volleyball, basketball, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are those most practiced in the northern regions, with Italians competing in international games and Olympic events.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan a country of seven thousand islands, the largest in the world!
On the map, there's a group of islands that are or were part of Japan; Japan is often described, from a geographical point of view, as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as "Beautiful Island" or "Lovely Island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a transformation of indigenous rice production practices and employing Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugarcane plantations.
In 1683, and perhaps from the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912), they took or gained control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and from 1885 they declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire.
In 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu develops with principal stone structures, such as Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Doors.
A good portion of the buildings adjacent to the complex have been reconstructed to give tourists a clearer idea of how they appeared originally.
In 1976, about thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues even now.
For example, the most common image format in the world was formed by still photography, and it is 35 mm, which was the dominant film dimension until the end of the era of analog film.
They are still produced today, but especially their proportions have been inherited from the forms of sense and image of digital photocameras.
It's formed from a 35mm, it's actually a rather confused little thing: 36mm wide by 24mm high.
Therefore, I said that the proportion of this form (divided by twelve, to obtain a ratio of whole numbers or a simpler one) is 3:2.
Many common forms (for example, a family of APS forms) are quite or very close to these proportions.
Because of the frequent and often overlooked rule of the rule of thirds, it's a simple guiding line that creates dynamism, while maintaining a sense of order within an image.
He states that the most effective position for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into three vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful, was put to the test.
For over a thousand years, the Christian religion has kept European states together despite differences in language and customs.
His power that pervaded the whole body and filled all the air commanded the king to the person.
One of the primary Christian principles is that money should be given to alleviate suffering and need, and that the funds of the Church are so specifically intended for this reason.
The central authority has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth led many to question whether this principle was just.
Just a warning or a sign of hostility, Great Britain has initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy has proven effective, with vital military and civilian supplies, given that this blockade either violates or respects international law accepted in the air, and codified in various international agreements of the last two centuries.
In Great Britain, they've established international patrols to prevent warships from entering certain areas of the ocean, also posing a danger to neutral ships.
Since there was a response limited to this tactic, Germany was expecting a response similar to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
In the post-war years, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and the nation was one of pacifism and isolation.
After having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to accept a job offer from Edison in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four patents in his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (or his recommendation from the first year) to Thomas Edison.
The ancient Ciña had a unique way of showing periods of time in the future; each phase of the Ciña or each family had the power to establish a distinct dynasty.
Between one dynasty and the other, there was an unstable age of divided provinces. The most famous of these periods is the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years, between the Han dynasty and the Jin dynasty.
In those times, there was a long war between two different nobles fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying in battle vying for power in the highest seat of the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are definitely social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, or the transition from absolutism to republicanism, or nationalism and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even the revolution and occupations were open to all male candidates, thus allowing ambition and success to move forward.
The maximum speech for the military, because it concerns the basing of the ranks of the army on certain classes, should be based on their importance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other people oppressed by the working class in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
He was deeply interested in questions beyond this earthly life. He frequented a cave that became famous by the name of "Hira," in the mountain of "Noor" (light for contemplation).
In the greatest cave, surviving the ages, there is an incredibly vivid depiction of the spiritual inclinations of Moma.
It welcomes in the shadow of the highest peak north of Mecca, a cave isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not at all easy to find a way out, even though it's known that it exists. Once inside the cave, it's total isolation.
You can't see how incredibly beautiful it is, the way the sky is, and the many mountains that are in it. So little of this world can be seen or felt, from inside a cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that is still standing.
Built in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza necropolis, or "Necropolis of Giza," is located in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead and contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, monuments of great antiquity, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid is famous for Pharaoh Khufu and many other pyramids and smaller tombs were built to honor and accompany the members of Khufu's family.
The mark "erco in erto" or "V" and the mark "erco in basso" or a paperclip, are a drawing without a bottom side.
“Sciù” means you have to start from the tip and roll up the cuff, and “zu” means you have to start from the little end (which is where your hand holds the cuff) and roll it up.
A high-pitched sound usually generates a softer tone, so that a low-pitched sound is stronger and more assertive.
Listen freely to write your signs with the chalk, but remember that the sounds of the stamped signs are there for a musical reason, so usually they should be respected.
Oh King Louis XVI, you terrorized Queen Marie Antoinette, her two small children (Maria Theresa, one year old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and her mother, Madame Elisabeth. On October 6, 1789, they were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of women from the marketplace.
In a cart they return to Paris, surrounded by a swarm of people who shout and fling threats against the king and queen.
A huge crowd forced the king and queen to drive the open carriages themselves.
At a certain moment, one of these scoundrels brandished the head of a royal guard beloved at Versailles, then the queen was terrified.
The costs of the war of US imperialism for the conquest of the Philippines have been paid by the Filipino people to the maximum extent.
They were forced by taxes and fees of the colonial regime of the United States to pay for most of their expenses, and the interests in these obligations fluctuated in the name of the Philippine Government, through the banking institutions of Wall Street.
Naturally, the natural resources derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people constituted the primary profit of Filipino imperialism.
On their heads, the Templars wore symbols that spoke of the context which had spurred the creation of the order.
The age in which the events unfolded is usually indicated by the name of the High Middle Ages, the period in European history of the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The Middle Ages were preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological driver or the technological imperative in the narrow sense, where the destiny of humankind is guided by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
And there are many interpretations of technological determinism that share some general ideas: that technological development either proceeds on a path beyond the influence of cultural and political factors, and that technology inherently has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that the engine of the car provides the power for the development of roads.
All the main roads, a national road is not economically sustainable for only a few vehicles, and therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a machine.
The ownership of machinery mass also leads to a certain incidence of misfortune on roads, which causes the invention of new techniques of rescue in the health field, to give refuge to damaged bodies.
Romanticism, or rather, idealism, was a major element of cultural determinism, drawn from writers like Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time it reflected the customs and cultures linked to that geography, and these, being in harmony with the local social structure, are better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Indeed, Paris is known as the world's capital, while Constantinople was considered the capital of feudal Europe.
Its ambition to be a center of luxury began little by little in the 400s A.D. and flourished little by little until the 1100s A.D.
Its condition was flourishing in the twelfth century, especially because the Greeks came bearing gifts like silks and drugs, which were considered among the most valuable of those displayed by the Byzantine merchants.
It was at that time that the title of Capital of the World passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style had its peak between the 10th-11th century and the 14th century.
Initially, the Ligurian dress was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
Otherwise, due to slow communication channels, Western styles could be delayed for 25-30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop a new style. One of the greatest developments of the era was the cross-back, and people began to use buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence agriculture is farming done to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological, system that relies on the recovery of original seeds from the ecoregion, combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques, to maximize yield.
Historically, much of the population was engaged in subsistence agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
And subcultures bring together individuals who think in the best way, and who feel neglected by social standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures are often distinctive depending on age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic style, which includes clothing, hairstyles, and piercings.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to take examples from the few cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortune, or voluntary abuse, have not been socialized by adults during their development.
These children are called "bestial" or "Salvage". Some Salvage children have been confined by people (usually their parents); in certain cases, these children are abandoned or have been subjected to abuse by the parents due to a serious intellectual or physical disability of the child.
I experienced serious abuse or childhood trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others think you were left to be devoured by beasts; they say that someone lived alone in nature.
When a child is raised completely by animals and not by humans, their behavior (within certain limits) tends to resemble that of a particular animal that has bonded with them, as if they had developed indifference towards humans.
So much so that entrepreneurial activity was based on projects that had to be easier and more interesting to undertake, and scaffolding is taking another step forward.
Scaffolding is not a method of entrepreneurship, but rather an addition that provides support to people who are open to facing a new entrepreneurial experience, such as the use of new computer software or the start of a new project.
I scaffold both virtual and real spaces; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but also the little staple guy from Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolds are internalized into software and for the purpose of facilitating discussion, suggesting, and explaining procedures that could be difficult for a student to manage alone.
I understand that people are often placed in a difficult position for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse to extortion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not stimulating, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We should consider that the system of trust provides a zone of safety for these children.
Our system of support should provide for the following needs of families: stable education and reliable healthcare assistance, also for educators.
I was supposed to provide everything necessary that was lacking in the house that had been taken from them previously.
The internet combines mass media elements with interpersonal communication.
Distinct characteristics of the Internet lead to added dimensions in terms of scope and approach to gratification.
For example, "imprendere" (to undertake) and "socializzare" (to socialize) are proposed as important motivations for the use of the Internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "continuous relationships" are also identified as nine aspects of motivation from Eighmey and McCord (1998) when investigating audience reactions to web content.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, subtle facial movements that last only a few seconds.
In particular, if I maintain that it's possible to detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting and analyzing microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article “The President’s Speech,” indicated that people who are not able to understand a speech because of damage to their brain are in every way able to assess its sincerity.
It suggests that these abilities in interpreting or human behavior can not be compartmentalized from beasts like domestic dogs.
Research in the twentieth century has shown that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and manifest.
A mutation is a new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination, along with mutation before and during the pairing of the two parents in each generation, vary.
It is difficult for a primate, with a digestive system like that of humans, to satisfy its needs with the available plant resources or its requirement for amino acids.
Indeed, the impossibility of doing so has serious consequences: growth problems, malnutrition, and, in the end, death.
And the plant resources that were easily accessible were starches and proteins that are in the leaves of legumes, but they are difficult to digest for humans like us, unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not digested by the tongue, but provide the body with proteins containing all the essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a way somewhat like how chimps do in the savanna.
The interruption of the day is the process of when someone adapts to the normal daytime period and falls asleep again right after (10-60 minutes).
This could be made by lengthening a small, rather silent resonance to bring back consciousness without any further disturbance.
If you find yourself dozing off or falling asleep so much that you fall asleep, you might be moved to the other side of the room, forced thus to get out of bed to wake yourself up.
Another option is based on the well-known prediction or consumption of many liquids (mainly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to bed, with the constraint of having to stay awake for urination.
The amount of inner peace that a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and spirit.
With tension low, with vital force present, it is positive. Every person has or possesses the potential to find peace and absolute satisfaction.
Everyone values enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded by the Mahayana concept of love and various Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love that embraces everything.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the divinity of Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, the energetic channels are purified, the chakras become activated, and consciousness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in the Second World War, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the United States. Since the end of the war, clashes of system, process, and culture have led to division between these countries.
Two years I've been accustomed since the war to seeing the roads filled with enemies, and the Great War has begun.
She had already turned 40 and had fought bravely in many wars, in various battlefields in Africa, Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
Before September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
Despite everything, these old clichés kept repeating day after day when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army and the Soviet Union entered and created the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts, after having invaded the eastern regions from Poland in violation of the peace treaty of Riga and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The ship is the most efficient way to transport large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of a maritime power is traditionally to guarantee that your country maintains the ability to mix and your people and your goods, interfering at the same time with the ability of your enemy to move and their people and their goods.
One recent example worthy of attention was the campaign in the North Atlantic during World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
For a long time now, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, has been trying to intercept this traffic at sea.
If the Ligurian cities had fallen, Germany would probably have been able to conquer Great Britain as it did with the rest of Europe.
The tribe that was originally settled around twelve years ago in the Zagros mountains of Iran.
Ancient tribes cultivated and maintained easy access to wool, flax, meat, and hides.
Sheep are usually kept in flocks that graze on the hills or other pastures, often tended by shepherds who are often children of more or less different ages, similar to the shepherds we know. These methods of shepherding are still used today.
I wander about, these walls were built in England during the 16th century.
I know that the cart was simply made of parallel wooden planks, allowing the horses that pulled it to achieve greater speeds and to haul heavier loads, compared to the somewhat rougher roads of those times.
And therefore it was introduced rather carefully to maintain and stay in position. In all respects, in many ways it was evident that the rails would have been more efficient if they had had an iron point on the side of the active part.
It's becoming a common practice, but either it creates or causes much more use of credit cards.
In the past, wooden oars were replaced by those made of iron. In 1767, iron oars were introduced and became the only ones used.
The first means of transport was walking. Humans began walking upright two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo Erectus (which means upright man).
I am the predecessor, the Australopithecus, who usually did not walk upright.
Bipedalism first appears in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although some scientists believe that Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
Let's compose a poem about living in a more respectful way towards the environment; let's join the environmentalist movement and let's also become activists to reduce, in a certain way, future suffering.
I'm saying that, many times, it's just like a symptomatic treatment. However, if we don't want a purely temporary solution, we would have to find and deactivate the root causes of the problems.
It seems clear that the world has changed greatly thanks to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and that problems have become more numerous due to overpopulation and the strange lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by the Congress, on July 4th, a handwritten bundle sent by the president of the Congress John Hancock and the secretary Charles Thomson to a few houses at a distance was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap.
It was realized between 150 and 200 copies, known today as the "Dunlap board".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon in the halls of Independence Hall on July 8th.
It was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who then read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
And 25 “Dunlap board” which are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten copy has not survived.
Several paleontologists also believe that a group of dinosaurs may have survived and are still living today. We call them öxelli.
Some people don't consider us dinosaurs because we are full of flaws and always complaining.
But there are many things in the heavens that are older than even the dinosaurs.
They went with a grunt and a groan, they climbed and walked up a slope until they reached the top, like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers in the world today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, that is to say 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits – or bits, for the computer world.
Internal poisoning might not be immediately evident. The symptoms, like vomiting, are never so general as to make an immediate diagnosis impossible.
A diagnosis of internal poisoning due to ingestion is the presence of a warning label from pharmaceuticals or domestic chemical products.
Check the antidote according to specific first aid instructions for that specific poison.
The term "scimixa" (monkey) has been adopted by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of animals.
I am finishing or I am coming from the ancient familiarity with the deer-like creatures, which are beasts strongly adapted to hunting men.
Both the Barbary macaque and the Egyptian monkey are beasts that do harm, and are good to live in a dwelling or in the house of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), which makes it the main neurological disease in older adults and middle-aged people.
The SM is a malformation that affects the central nervous system, which is composed of the brain, the spinal cord, and the optic nerve.
Research has discovered that females have twice the probability of having Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) from male parents.
Whether it is in his own best interest, or in the interest of his son, to raise a child.
He gave a good education to his son.
With a parent's natural rights being terminated in such a way that another couple can be able to act as parents to the child.
The primary goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method is the guide to most scientific research.
It's not just experimentation, however; an experiment is a test that serves to eliminate one or more hypotheses, poses questions, and makes observations that also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers have focused on studying classical texts and, above all, on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views and opinions on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
With the rediscovery of knowledge of Greek, the West found itself cut off from its roots of philosophical and scientific thought.
Well, we observe rhythms within physiology and behavior, often crucially depending on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological regulators.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic signals, have been documented in most living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological rhythms are oscillating, self-sufficient cycles that continue for a free-running period, even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence for the fact that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase showed that viruses, little organisms, can insert their DNA into bacteria.
One can do experiments with marking or DNA into a phage with a radioactive phosphate or a phage protein with two radioactive sulfur atoms.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, the cell affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism is based on enjoying nature and attracting people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities available in the area include hunting, fishing, photography, or birdwatching, as well as visiting the parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
He has visited, photographed, and knows the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning people leave in cars and small towns to return to their workplace, and they are overtaken by others, whose work destination is either the place that those ones recently left or their own.
In Liguria, the discussion of dynamic transport sees everyone in some way connected and supporting a system of transport based on private machines.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that sustained human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the society and the systems of transport. Everyone complains about the transport systems.
The peace of this land is felt through the echoes of different levels of wood found in the quality of the water or in the calmness of the bridges.
Why do these transport systems generate these problems, why do they fail every day? Are the transport experts simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamentally happening?
Traffic flow is the study of movement between two railway bridges and vehicles, and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Generally, people tend to exhibit behaviors within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a reasonable consistency and can be largely represented mathematically.
To better represent the traffic flow, relationships between three main characteristics have been established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
These relationships are important in planning, design, and management of roads.
Insects have been among the first creatures to be able to fly or swim. According to their ability, they have adapted to avoid enemies, to find food and companions in a more efficient way.
Many insects come to seek advantage and along the way, this provides a wider range of small places where they can hide from predators.
I'm trying to find a wider range of small hiding places where they can hide from predators.
Even the only insects that don't have wings are grasshoppers and mayflies.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarco said that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many people believed the contrary; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars).
This is a strange feeling, because in Tæra it doesn't seem as if it tastes good when mixed, isn't it?
The Amassoni River is the second longest and largest river in Liguria. It carries more than 8 times the water of the second largest river.
The Amassoni River is also the widest river from Genoa, sometimes six miles wide.
A good 20 percent of the water comes from the rivers of the planet into the oceans or comes from the Amazon River.
The Amasso River originates at 6,387 km (3,980 miles). It gathers water from thousands of smaller streams.
I know that the construction of pyramids in ancient times goes back even before the end of the Old Kingdom, and the pyramids of Giza have never been surpassed in dimensions and in technical excellence since their construction.
The ancient cities of the New Kingdom were filled with monuments of their predecessors, which were then well over a thousand years old.
The population of the State of the Vatican City is about 800 inhabitants. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City has introduced Italian into its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most of those who work in the State, so much so that Latin has been used often in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of Città del Vaticano are Catholic.
People knew the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, or copper, because these could all be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to obtain with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is composed of a mixture of four elements or fewer. These are earth, water, air, and fire.
I'm saying that all matter is composed of the four states: solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, even though he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Metals are fundamentally a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver or gold.
You can also have alloys that include small quantities of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles, like all those we call atoms.
The atoms are so much smaller than the billion-dollar period contained within this sentence.
So, he was a good friend to many people when he was lucky.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the quill has been relegated to a lesser status and use.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, without ever having to approach a typewriter.
A little bit I only wonder what will become of things when something new arrives.
The bomb works according to the principle that it needs energy to put together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's a bit like bringing a heavy load up a small hill. By dividing it back to its core, you release part of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break down with very little or a small amount of spontaneous fission.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. Its outer layer is called the crust.
The crust is about 70km on the near side and 100km on the far side.
It's cooler under the sea and drier under the olive trees.
The reason why the dough rises more in the oven is because the crust is thinner. It's easier to wash it up to the surface.
Theories of constraints are centered on the search for what causes and directs people in a certain way, or attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or decisions that have been internalized through mechanisms that extend to adulthood.
His theories are based on what he has seen with certain people that make him desire things and things that they do, and what and things they do or don't make him do certain things within his environment.
The two most popular content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
In the workplace, several behaviors emerge when managers begin to guide their fellow colleagues. On one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "a good child" (or a "good girl").
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, carrying out disciplinary actions, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
At the other extreme of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels the duty to change everything they have done, and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often translates into a split between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the highest standards of excellence of traditional teams, but there are subtle differences.
The members of the virtual team serve as points of contact for your immediate fixed group.
Often we ask for more autonomy for team members because their teams need to meet based on the variable schedules that cannot be understood by their local management.
The presence of an "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto 1989, p109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
Either the "invincible team" or the management group is what all members refer to. The invincible team establishes standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to undertake the lengthy process of establishing an organization that undertakes? The objective is to put into practice the concepts of organizational entrepreneurship or innovation.
When all available resources are effectively deployed within the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome a challenge or even lead to a new innovative process to satisfy customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as knowledge sharing and organizational entrepreneurship.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method developed to improve and organize, at a higher level, performance.
Neurobiological data should provide proof of a theoretical method of investigation into cognition. Therefore, narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and aggressive behavior is a field of study in science.
It is known for some time that different types of brain damage – trauma, lesions, or tumors – influence behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes never before seen.
I am giving you a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand the processes of our mind.
I know that AI has a strong science fiction connotation; AI constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with intelligent behavior, planning, and adaptation in a machine.
The research in AI involves the creation of machines to automate and perform activities that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate disciplines, which concentrate on solutions to real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence has been used often in sectors of the economy, from medicine, to engineering and the military, because it has been constituted in various software applications for home computers and video games.
Going on field trips is an important part of the class experience. Very often a teacher would like to take their students to places for which a trip by bus is not an option.
Technology offers solutions with virtual journeys. Students can examine objects in a museum, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art alongside their class.
Virtually organize a school trip, or it's also a way to reflect on a journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students from Bennet School on the Carolina in the North project a website during their trip to the capital of the State; every year the website is redesigned, but older versions are kept online to serve as a memory album.
I blog to help improve students' writing. So much so that students often start sharing their experiences on the blog with poor grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience in the area to change things, and so on.
Since students are often either very public or very critical, or blog writers, they start to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Even the blog "constrains" students to become experts of the world that is happening. The necessity to feed the public's interest inspires students to be intelligent and interesting (Toto, 2004).
This blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages extending entrepreneurship far beyond traditional daytime hours.
The use of blogs appropriates to give students more analytical and critical skills; through an active response to materials on the internet, students can define their position within the context of other people's writings and outline their perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the fascinating bilingual capital of Canada, and it features a series of art galleries and museums that show the past and present of Canada.
Down south are the Niagara Falls, and the north hosts the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and more besides.
All these things still highlight Ontario as what foreigners typically consider Canadian.
From the border towards the north, there are quite a few small towns and some are abandoned villages and deserted hamlets.
On a population comparison that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
It is located in East Africa, situated in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is bigger than the United Kingdom, and a continent to be admired when it comes to endemic fauna.
Many of the small Ligurian islands are independent nations, or associated with France and known as luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought Islam to distant lands, and it had great success in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and European colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found a route from the Cape of Europe to India.
North of it is a region delimited by the Sahel, and to the south and west by the Atlantic Ocean.
Ladies: it is recommended to all women traveling to say they are getting married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It's useful to bring a ring (only one, or no, if it doesn't cost too much).
And women had to be aware that cultural differences could result in something that could be considered harassment, and it's not uncommon to be followed, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Stay still and maintain your position; otherwise, you won't be able to keep your place (cultural differences or otherwise, it won't work!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen from the 10th century BC and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port, called Anfa.
They Portuguese it destroyed and they were rebuilding under the name of White House, to abandon it to the ravages of the 1755 earthquake.
Oh, Moroccan sultan, he built it and returned to the city like Daru I-Badya, and it was given the name Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places that sell traditional products like taxidermy, ceramics, leather goods, narghiles, and a whole range of trinkets here, but it's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the western part of the country, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's streets, especially those in the center.
I know that goma is quite accessible, and aerial surveys of goma fields could help understand the ongoing state of conflict in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a departure point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as for good routes in Africa for gorilla viewing.
In Goma, you can earn money driving (or working as a passenger on a motorcycle). The usual price for a risky run is around 500 Congolese francs at most.
In combination with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for exotic and distant lands.
Even Timbuktu is a somewhat small town, even though it has a reputation that makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desertification.
It was one of the principal segments in the special PBS Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is in stark contrast to the rest of the country, because it has a more Arab than African atmosphere.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and has a long border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km2 and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting a different wild fauna.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and has been considered for the relocation of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are these daily fees for conservation and park entry.
It might be advantageous to get a Wild Card, which provides access to a selection of parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main objective.
The row of wedding boats composing Hong Kong's skyline was compared to a shimmering code of lights reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get to Hong Kong, leave the island and then head straight towards the long side of Kowloon.
The vast majority of Hong Kong's urban development is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is precisely the place where the British colonizers didn't take it as their own, and therefore if you are looking for testimonies of the colonial past, this is a good starting point.
I Sundarbans is the biggest area of mangrove coastline in the world, which extends for 80km (50 miles) from the coast towards the inland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest, located within the Indian territory, is called Sundarbans National Park.
Even so, the forests are not just mangrove swamps: they include certain of the last remaining towering jungles that once thrived in the Ganges delta.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km2, of which a large portion is covered by water or swamp.
In 1966, the Sundarbans became a sanctuary for diverse fauna, and it is estimated that there are 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer in the air. **Note:** There seems to be a slight anomaly in the Ligurian sentence, specifically the phrase "oua inte l’aria ghe segge". While I've translated it literally, it might be a transcription error. It is unlikely that deer would be "in the air". I have translated it as literally as possible while maintaining grammatical correctness.
The buses leave from the inter-district bus station (on the other side of the river) all day long, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
In many districts, small Japanese buses are used, as they are comfortable and robust.
Taxis in Paro are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a cable-stayed bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges in French Guiana.
It has a tower that rises 83 meters, it is 378 meters long and has two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The free vertical artress (or arch) under the bridge is 15 meters high. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
A final operational bridge opening is planned for September 2017, when Brazilian customs controls are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní are an indigenous group considered the most significant among those who inhabited what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Gran Chaco region hosted other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guayacurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called the "giant province of India," arose from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the original indigenous groups.
Initially, the period of colonization lasted two or three centuries.
Since the foundation of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its character and its indigenous identity.
Argentiña was known for having one of the best polo teams and some of the best players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields of Las Cañitas.
It occurs in the minor key and can also be seen in other periods of the year.
Please check with the Argentine Polo Association for information on tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is pegged to that of the British Pound.
Okay, here's the English translation of the Ligurian sentence: Return only the translated sentence: **Go to that place that is located at Stanley, then to the FIC West store.**
British sterling coins are accepted at airports everywhere on the island, and inside Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
In some peripheral establishments and credit cards are not accepted, even if British and American currencies could theoretically be used; check with the owners beforehand to determine which payment method is acceptable.
It's extremely unwise to exchange Falkland dollars for fire stones, so exchange your money beforehand before leaving the island.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is when the Northern Hemisphere is in winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics, with average summer temperatures around 30 degrees Celsius.
Winter can be deceptively cold: and temperatures hardly drop below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't any particular "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of water remains roughly the same throughout the year.
I know that many of the souls in this park are accustomed to seeing humans; it is always common to serve them, and they should not be nourished or disturbed.
According to the author of the park, stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
It doesn't matter how many animals graze: bison, deer, elk, bears, and wild boars can all attack.
Every year, the beaches are closed because people haven't maintained the proper distance. These animals are large, aggressive, and potentially dangerous, so give them space.
Basically, keep in mind that hatred stirs up bears and other savage animals, so avoid transporting or preparing food that smells strongly and keep your camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a famous naval blockade in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk by a British cruiser. 200 American and German victories were lost.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peace rally in the city led to the gathering of the supreme leader Tupua Tamanese Lealofi III.

Usually, to enroll in these training programs, you need to pay an enrollment fee.
Finland is an important destination for boats. "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands, in lakes and in coastal archipelagos.
Those archipelagos and lakes really don't need a yacht.
Even though the coastal archipelagos and the large lakes are more than enough for all yachts, smaller boats like a kayak offer a special experience.
Sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with a boat every seven or eight people.

Regarding the trade of information, how things function like an airplane and what happens when one tries or could possibly be helpful to earn a little money based on something one doesn't know or doesn't have control over.
I go well paid to deliver and things to be shipped. Many times the time is very important when dealing with business papers, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
For the largest companies and their airlines, things are good, but for smaller businesses and companies, there's a problem.
If it were the case that the state had taken to air travel, in some routes they might have saved days in transit and at customs.
Alone, I went to the post office to send a package as registered baggage. Airline regulations do not allow the shipment of baggage without a ticket, and this is where other issues come into play.
Look, he's in first class or in business class, and it's really your fault for spending a lot of money (or, even better, let your fingers do the talking about where you work).
But the convenience isn't worth the good price: it's usually or costs as much as business class or is up to four times larger than economy class, first class, in exchange, only a fraction of the price!
As a matter of principle, there's no reason to aim for promotions to first-class or business-class positions just to go from A to B.

I know that, to some extent, this is an inaccurate stereotype, but to better enjoy visiting Paris without problems, it's best to behave as well as possible, according to the behavior of a "well-bred" person (well-educated). Likewise, the city will be much easier to navigate.
The harsh appearance of people who are very knowledgeable suggests they lack the desire to show any kind of courteousness.

During the visit to the monastery, I was told that men and women had to do work that came all the way from Genoa and that they also carried their burdens on their shoulders.
Often, the monastery provides shelter for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring yourself, especially if you have something to offer, you will receive a smile from the monk or the nun at the entrance.
