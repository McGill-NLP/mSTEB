This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widely accepted, but also offers details that fossils normally cannot, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the plumage of this animal was chestnut brown on the upper part with a light background or carotenoid color.
The discovery also offers a view of the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers do not have a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but do have other feather characteristics – barbs and barbules – researchers deduce that the rachis was certainly a more recent evolutionary development than these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests that they weren't used for flying, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers have suggested that, even though it's the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen exhibits the plumage of an adult and not a chick.
Researchers suggest that, even though it is the tail of a young dinosaur, the sample reveals adult feathers, not down.
Yesterday morning, a car bomb exploded at the headquarters of the police in Gaziantep, Turkey, killing two police officers and injuring more than twenty people.

They have discovered that the Sun operates under the same basic principles as other stars: it has been seen that the activity of all the stars in the system depends on their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing more.
Brightness and rotation are used together to determine the Rossby number of a star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star will be with respect to magnetic inversions.

The work done has been mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the moon exerts an attraction on the Earth, which causes the tides, the Milky Way exerts an attraction on the Andromeda galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that regular matter does.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located in a sort of halo around the galaxy, and is made up of many tiny particles.

Its thermal behavior is not as stable as large caves on Earth, which often have a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the hypothesis that they are deep shafts in the ground, said Glen Cushing of the astrogeology team at the United States Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University located in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, elections have traditionally been a rather non-technological experience: voters isolate themselves in a booth and put a pre-printed piece of paper with their chosen candidate inside an envelope.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter drops the ballot in the ballot box and signs the voter's slip.
The French electoral law strictly codifies the procedures.
Since 1988, the ballot boxes must be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes at the start of the voting and that no other envelopes are added that are not those of the voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to witness each part of the procedure. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Beyond Wednesday's event, Carpanedo competed in 2 individual races at the Championship.
The first was the slalom, in which she received a "Did Not Finish" on the first run. Thirty-six of the remaining 116 competitors finished with the same result.
The other race she participated in, the giant slalom, ended with her in tenth position in the seated women's group, with a combined time for all the runs of 4:41.30; 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first to finish, Austria's Claudia Loesch, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-placed Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary.
Four female skiers from the seated group did not finish their races, and 45 of the total 117 giant slalom skiers failed to qualify for the race.
The laptop and mobile phone that had been stolen were recovered thanks to the work of the Madhya Pradesh police.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who assaulted the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and her computer."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police superintendent Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with his face covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crash occurred, no one was injured.
Despite this, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first hospitalized at the James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya has been charged at the Sheriff's Court of Scotland with the murder of her son.
He is under judicial supervision pending trial, but any eyewitness testimony could be rejected because his image has been published everywhere.
This is a common practice in any other part of the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have viewed the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee points out that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line if they publish photos, etc. of suspects."
The Crown Office, responsible for the accusations, has told journalists that it will not make further statements, at least not until the verdict.
According to the leak, the document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine wants to establish according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Among other matters discussed, as recorded, there is the future status of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both nations, and the dispute over the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands an uninterrupted military presence in the valley for ten years once an agreement is signed, while the PA only commits to accepting it for five years.
The pest control supplementary pilot project hunters had to be closely supervised by the forest rangers, as the pilot project was monitored and its effectiveness was evaluated.
In an association of NPWS and the Australian SportShooting Association (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers were recruited under the SportShooting Association Association program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Interim Director of the Conservation and Heritage Park with the NPWS, the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation will receive safety training and adequate preparation.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of new members.
It is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures aimed at moving the country forward towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
The protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of elections, some of which were planned for 2011.
Nearly 60 cases of iPod malfunction and overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Industry (METI) announced that Apple had reported 34 additional incidents related to overheating, which the company described as "not serious".
In response, the ministry described Apple's postponement of the report as "frankly unfortunate."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM local time (9:19 PM GMT on Friday).
The North Mariana Islands' emergency management office said no damage has been reported in the territory.
Likewise, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center indicated that there had been no tsunami warning.
An ex-Filipino police officer has held Hong Kong tourists hostage to hijack their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot his M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have been rescued, and so far, at least six deaths have been confirmed.
A few hours ago, six hostages were released, including children, the elderly, and Filipino photographers.
The photographers then took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot dead.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
She trained as an obstetrician and began working at the Auckland Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature birth during his free time.
Her research showed that if a hormone was administered, fetal lung maturation in the baby would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government researchers recovered two "black boxes" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Fellow fighters also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the full moon. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels has commented that "Luna was as freaky as me... maybe even more... I love her and I'll find her at the altar... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, those who oppose Australia becoming a republic grew by 8% since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34% of those surveyed want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist at the Olympic Games had to swim the 100 and 200 meters freestyle and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but their physical condition has been in doubt due to their complaints.
He hasn't been able to take the necessary medication to manage his pain because it is prohibited in the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest prime number found as of January 25th.
Many people verified the discovery using different hardware and software in early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets could have been a source of water sent to Earth along with organic matter that can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, especially how Earth was formed, since comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and signed a law last month to legalize same-sex marriage.
He dismissed the rumors as "political gossip and nonsense."
It is speculated that he/she/it will run in the 2016 presidential elections.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow planes to fly shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite-based technology, unlike the old radar-based technology, so that air traffic controllers can locate pilots with much greater precision and send them more accurate information.
Reinforcing transport is not planned, and commuter trains will not stop at Wembley. There are also no on-street parking spaces or park-and-ride facilities.
The concern over a lack of transport has led to the possibility that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science described the formation of a new species of bird in the Ecuadorian islands of the Galapagos.
Researchers at the University of Princeton in the United States and the University of Uppsala in Sweden have reported that the new species has evolved in just two generations, despite it being thought that much more time was needed for this process, due to the interbreeding between a Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes (endemic), and a Galapagos finch with a conical beak, Geospiza conirostris (invasive).
Gold can be worked in all kinds of ways. It can be molded into the smallest figures.
It can be inserted into fine wires, which can be twisted. It can be hammered or flattened into sheets.
It can be made very thin and stacked on other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the images painted by hand in books called "illustrated manuscripts".
That's what the pH of a substance is called. You can make an indicator using red cabbage juice.
Red cabbage juice changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) a substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the quantity of hydrogen ions (the H in pH) in the analyzed substance.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (since hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, form a ball.
The humidity of the hands reacts with the outer layers, which causes a strange sensation and forms a kind of barrier.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of drains have been discovered in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
There were also washbasins in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, washbasins sometimes formed part of public bathhouses where men and women gathered together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then reflects it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent to space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts part of our light and our view.
A giant rocket taller than 100 feet is needed to place a satellite or telescope in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most outstanding thing the wheel has done for us has been to make transportation much faster and simpler.
The train, the car, and many other means of transport have brought us here.
Beneath them, there are more medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small felines (including feral domestic cats) that eat the small prey which are much more abundant, such as small insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of a niche, a specific job that each cat has and that prevents them from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines and live in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three adult males related to each other, along with up to thirty females and calves.
Females are often closely related, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
Schools of lions behave largely like packs of dogs or wolf packs, which are animals with a surprisingly similar behavior to that of lions (although not to other large felines) and equally deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a complete athlete, can climb (although not very well), swim, jump great distances, and exert five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (Panthera genus) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of the tiger is not like the full-throated roar of the lion, but rather more like a phrase shouted with words of anger.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they hunt monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find the animals they eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing out the traces they leave on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with night vision, and they can also move very stealthily. Ocelots hunt their prey by camouflaging themselves with their surroundings and then pouncing on them.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) separates from the main, original group (for example, by crossing a mountain range or a river, or by migrating to a new island and being unable to return) they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they had before.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations than it needed before to be a strong competitor.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it starts to look less and less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations were so different that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that humans breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale (that is, that we breathe out).
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and make clothes with plants. Most of what we eat are plants. Without plants, most animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the alpha predator of its time, which is why it feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
Its long jaws had more than seventy sharp teeth like knives, accompanied by an additional play in the roof of its mouth, so that there was no escape route for anything that stood in its way.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue. Its diet included turtles, long fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water as well; not even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could rival him.
Although most of their foods would be familiar to us, the Romans had some rare or unusual dishes at their banquets, such as wild boars, peacocks, snails, and rodents called dormice.
Another difference was that, while the poor and women ate seated on a chair, the wealthy men enjoyed attending banquets where they liked to gorge themselves huddled together while eating.
The ancient Roman meals could not have included foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they had no corn, no tomatoes, no potatoes, no cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted a turkey.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered the house of the god.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to satisfy the gods' needs with ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and then a closed sanctuary to which only the priests could access.
Sometimes special tower-shaped pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, housing was not so important.
The majority of the family life of Hebrews took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the courtyard; the shops were simple open counters facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
There were no large forests in the land of Canaan, so wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. The Norse sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland due to a murder and, traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Now, despite their discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living there at that time.
Despite all being "Scandinavian" countries, there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie National Treasure, you might imagine that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
Now, that's not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
Written on the back of the Declaration of Independence were the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text is located at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Although no one knows for certain who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its creation the long parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Thus, it seems that notation was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landings and the battles that followed liberated northern France, but the south was still not free.
He was governed by the "Vichy" France. These were French people who had signed an armistice with the Germans in 1940 and who collaborated with the invaders instead of confronting them.
The allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940; the invasion was called "Operation Dragon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated the south of France and were advancing towards Germany.
A civilization is a unique culture shared by a significant group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin *civilis*, which means civil, related to the Latin *civis*, which means citizen, and *civitas*, with the meaning of city or city-state, and that also defines the dimensions of society in a way.
City-states preceded nations. A civilized culture implies the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a persistent cultural legacy, and an equitable diffusion.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving clear historical traces and are not recognized as civilizations proper.
During the War of Independence, the thirteen states initially formed a weak central government – with the Congress as its sole component – under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial body, it fell to the authorities of the state, who were often uncooperative, to enforce all its acts.
He also had no authority to invalidate tax laws and tariffs between states.
The Articles required the unanimous approval of all the states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives often absented themselves.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and they were the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
The most popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
The most popular sports in the northern regions are winter sports, and they have the presence of Italians who participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest), making it the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to the archipelago that Japan is, it is often called, in geographical terms, an "archipelago".
Taiwan's beginnings date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by coined the name Formosa for the island, meaning "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southeastern Taiwan, where it began transforming indigenous grain production practices and turned to Chinese laborers for rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, by which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which would govern the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main buildings: the Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of how they originally appeared.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common film frame format in the world is 35 mm, which was the main film size at the close of the analog film era.
It still occurs today, but even more importantly, its aspect relationship has been inherited in the formats of the sensors of digital image cameras.
The 35mm format actually creates a bit of confusion, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
It is said that the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of whole numbers) is, therefore, 3:2.
Many common formats (the APS format family, for example) are the same or very similar to this aspect relationship.
The rule of thirds, which has been overused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while also maintaining order in an image.
It says that the most effective place for the main subject is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds, both vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period, the history of Europe saw the Catholic Church questioned, which had become rich and powerful.
For more than a thousand years, the Christian religion united the European states despite differences in language and customs.
His omnipresent power affected everyone, from kings to commoners.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth must be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources exist precisely for this reason.
The principal authority of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many people to question whether this dogma was being upheld.
Shortly after the start of hostilities, Brittany initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, cutting off vital supplies to military personnel and civilians, although this blockade violated generally accepted international laws that had been codified by various international agreements in the last two centuries.
Brittany mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering complete segments of the ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since there was a limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and nations was one of pacifism and isolation.
After having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations desired to avoid a similar situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York.
He arrived in the United States with four cents to his name, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his boss from his last job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying different historical periods: each stage of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Also between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period that took place for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient China, with thousands of people dying fighting to secure the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, a shift from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people and not to a single ruler.
Equally, after the Revolution, occupations were opened to all men who requested them, allowing the most ambitious and successful to achieve them.
This also applies to the military, because instead of basing the ranks of the army on classes, from this point on they were based on relevance.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in matters that transcend this worldly life. He would often frequent a cave known as "Hira" on Mount "Noor" (light) for contemplation.
The cave itself, which has survived the passage of time, provides a rather clear image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
At the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, and even knowing it exists, it's not easy to find. The isolation is absolute once you get inside the cave.
You can't see anything except a clear and beautiful sky overhead, and the abundant mountains that surround it. There is very little of this world that can be seen or felt from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands.
Built by the Egyptians during the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased Pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau, or "Giza Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Dead contains various pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), various small tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the pyramids, tombs, and smaller temples were erected in honor of the pharaoh's wives and family members.
The "upward arc" sign resembles the letter V (upside down) and the "downward arc" sign looks like a staple or a square without the bottom side.
When it points upwards, it means you should start at the tip and push the bow upwards, and when it points downwards, it means you should start at the heel (where the hand holds the bow) and pull the bow downwards.
Rubbing the ropes from right to left creates a softer sound, while doing it the other way produces a louder and more assertive sound.
Feel free to take notes of your own indications, but keep in mind that the chord markings are there for a musical reason, so they should be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, four years old), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced by a crowd of merchant women to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In a carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and waved threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, a member of the crowd showed the head of a murdered royal guard from Versailles to the horrified Queen.
The war expenses of North American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the United States colonial regime, in order to cover a good part of the expenses and interest of the bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Of course, the great gains derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would constitute the basic profits of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that fostered the creation of the order.
The period in which the events took place is popularly known as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history during the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000-1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages was preceded by the Early Middle Ages and followed by the Late Middle Ages, which, by convention, ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strict sense in which human destiny is guided by a hidden logic associated with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology, at the same time, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that motor cars necessarily lead to the development of roads.
Nevertheless, a network of roads throughout the country for a handful of cars is not economically viable, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The widespread ownership of cars also leads to a higher incidence of road accidents, which leads to the invention of new medical assistance techniques to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism had an important component of cultural determinism, shaped by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures related to that geography emerged that were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, because they were in harmony with the place and with society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the contemporary world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began in the year 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Their status declined during the twelfth century, mainly because the Croats had returned bringing gifts such as silks and spices that were worth more than those offered by the Byzantine markets.
It was at this moment that the title of capital of fashion moved from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak popularity during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, and due to the slowness of communication channels, styles could reach the West with a delay of 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the major developments of the period was that, as a result of the crusades, people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence agriculture is that which is carried out to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses locally adapted native seeds from the ecoregion combined with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers were dedicated to subsistence agriculture, and it is still the case in many developing nations.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ideas who feel abandoned by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can differ due to the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that determine a subculture as different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of a subculture are often distinguished from those of other subcultures by the distinctive and symbolic use of a style, which includes fashion, customs, and slang.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to refer to the few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized by adults during their upbringing, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
These children are called "wild" or feral. Some feral children have been isolated by people (usually their parents); in some cases, this child abandonment was due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have suffered child abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Others are supposedly said to have been raised by animals; some are said to have lived in the wild all alone.
The wild child, when raised only by non-human animals, exhibits behaviors (always within physical limits) almost identical to those of the animal that raises it, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes a step further.
The scaffolding theory is not a learning method, but a support that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as learning to use new software or starting a project.
Scaffolding can be virtual or real: in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little assistant clip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is designed to question, show, and explain procedures that may have been too complicated for the student to manage on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, ranging from abandonment to abuse, and including extortion.
No child should grow up in an environment where they are not fed, loved, and educated, but there are those who do.
We believe that the foster family system is a form of security for these children.
Our foster care system must provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
It is assumed that the reception provides for all the needs that were not covered in the home from which they were originally taken.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinctive characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of the approach to uses and gratifications.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important reasons for the use of the internet (James et al., 1995).
Personal involvement and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivating factors by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated public reaction to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to detect if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The Emperor of All Maladies," pointed out how people who are unable to understand discourse due to brain damage are nonetheless capable of accurately assessing sincerity.
It even suggests that these capacities for interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals such as domestic dogs.
In the 20th century, research has shown that there are two sets of genetic variation: hidden and exposed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection eliminates it from the pool of variation that is expressed.
Segregation and recombination combine forward and backward variation between the two genetic pools in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans' to satisfy its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, failing to achieve this has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant resources that were easiest to obtain should have been the proteins provided by leaves and legumes, but unless they are cooked, these are difficult to digest for primates like ourselves, humans.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only digest easily, but they also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Nevertheless, we shouldn't be surprised that our ancestors solved their "protein problem" as chimpanzees in the savanna do today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of waking up and falling back asleep during a normal sleep period, typically after a short period (10-60 minutes).
This is easy to do using a quiet alarm clock that gently wakes you up without fully waking you.
If you're one of those people who reset the clock while sleeping, try putting it at the other end of the room, so you'll have to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, so that one is forced to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely proportional to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force present. Each person has the potential to find peace and full satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it spread through the path of Mahayana love and many Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (illuminated energy) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Through visualizing various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is cultivated.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which facilitated collaboration between the Soviet Union and the United States. With the armistice came a clash of systems, processes, and cultures, and both countries became enemies.
Two years after the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War began.
It extended for the following forty years, and a serious fight was waged, with deployed armies, on battlefields ranging from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defenses had already been penetrated, and the only hope was to withdraw and reorganize at the Romanian bridgehead.
Nevertheless, these plans became obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered and created fronts in Belarus and Ukraine after invading the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international, bilateral, or multilateral treaties.
Using ships to transport goods is, by far, the most efficient method of moving large numbers of people and goods across the oceans.
The job of the marines has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the ability of your enemy to move their people and their goods.
One of the most significant recent examples was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
Contemporary German navy, primarily using submarines, was attempting to stop this trafficking.
If the allies had failed, it is probable that Germany could have conquered Great Britain, just as it did with the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains, in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them to easily obtain milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were often kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other pasture areas, often guarded by shepherds who were usually children or adolescents. These grazing methods are still used today.
The wagons were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Even though the tracks consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they pulled wagons with horses to achieve higher speeds and haul larger loads in the most difficult sections.
The crossbeams will be inserted quite soon to keep the rails in place. However, it soon became apparent that the rails would be more efficient if they had an iron cover on top.
This became a common practice, but the iron wore down the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
Eventually, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. The first completely iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first means of transport was walking; humans began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not habitually walk upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs at most 7 million years ago.
We can start living more respectfully with the environment, we can join the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to partially reduce the suffering that might exist in the future.
This only works as a symptomatic treatment in most cases. However, if we don't want just a temporary solution, we should find the root cause of the problems and disable them.
It is quite evident that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and that problems have grown due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humans.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary Charles Thompson, was sent to the printing house of John Dunlap located a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, which are now known as "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was held by John Nixon in the courtyard of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who had his troops read it in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap broadsides that are still known to exist are the oldest surviving copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many features of birds that resemble those of a dinosaur.
They have scaly feet and claws, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a tyrannosaurus.
Practically all the computers we use today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, that is to say, 0 or 1, and these numbers are known as binary digits or bits, according to computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are common enough that an immediate diagnosis cannot be made.
The best sign of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open medicine container or toxic household chemicals.
Look for first aid instructions specific to the specific poison on the label.
The term insect is used by entomologists formally for this group of insects.
This term derives from the ancient association with lice, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both reduviid bugs and stink bugs are nidicolous, adapted to seeing inside the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research has concluded that women are twice (2 times more likely) to develop multiple sclerosis than men.
A couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interests or in the best interests of their child.
These couples can choose to make an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to find out how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method guides most scientific research.
Now, experimentation is not the only thing, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses; the formulation of questions and observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts and, in particular, on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's opinions on all matters of science, including psychology, were accepted.
As the knowledge of the Greeks declined, the East found itself disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often crucially depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simple responses to periodic external stimuli, have been documented in the majority of living beings, such as bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are autonomous oscillators that follow a period of inertia even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the first indications that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into a bacterium.
They performed two experiments labeling the virus's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the virus's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have a variety of different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the piece of genetic material affected, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be transmitted to offspring; mutations in any other location can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the wildlife of plants and animals.
Among the examples of on-site activities are hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information centers about the ecosystem.
One example is to visit, photograph, and learn about the orangutans of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive from the small rural villages to their workplaces, passing by others whose workplace is the one they have just left.
In this dynamic vehicle, everyone is, in some way, connected with and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Science shows us today that this colossal coal economy has uncoupled one of the stable states of the biosphere, which has supported the evolution of humans for the last two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear so many complaints about water quality or bridge collapses.
Why do transport systems generate this kind of complaints, why do they fail daily? Are transport engineers incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic Flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions that are established between them.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a considerably constant range; therefore, the flow of traffic tends to have considerable consistency and can be approximately represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, relationships have been established between its three main characteristics: (1) flow rate, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings around their body.
This provides them with a great variety of small places where they can hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are the gladiator beetle and the mayfly.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
There were people who thought what he said was true, but many people believed the opposite; that the Solar System was moving towards the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
That seems reasonable, because we don't have the sensation that the Earth is moving, or do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries eight times more water than the second longest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet to the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom period were fascinated by the monuments of their predecessors, which were then more than a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language used by the majority of people living in the east, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper have been known since ancient times, as they can all be found in nature in native form and are relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of a total of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It resembled the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although, furthermore, according to his theory, they changed into new substances that form what we see.
Alloys are basically a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that the periodic table has many elements.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also other metals like silver and gold.
One can also have alloys that include small quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
The entire Universe is made up of matter. All matter is formed from tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of atoms could fit inside the period at the end of this sentence.
In this way, the pencil became a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, with the appearance of new writing methods, the pencil has been relegated to a lesser status and uses.
Nowadays, people write messages on computer screens without ever needing a pencil sharpener.
A man can only wonder what the keyboard will become when something new emerges.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to combine a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Similar to pushing a heavy cart uphill. Separating the nucleus releases some of this energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with a small or even no collision.
The surface of the Moon is made of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The bark measures 70 km thick in the closest part and 100 km thick in the furthest part.
It is thinner under the lunar seas and thicker under the mountainous zones.
It may be that there are more lunar seas on the visible side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for lava to come to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out what people like or are interested in.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized and therefore mature towards adulthood.
These theories examine what makes certain people want the things they do and what aspects of their environment will cause them to do or not do certain things.
Two famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
In general, two behaviors may appear, so administrators begin to lead their former colleagues. One extreme of the spectrum is to try to fit in like "just another guy" (or girl).
This type of manager has problems making unpopular decisions, applying disciplinary actions, conducting evaluations, assigning responsibilities, and holding others accountable for their actions.
In the opposite case, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels the need to change everything the team has been doing and make it their own.
After all, the leader is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often ends in clashes between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are subject to the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but with some minor differences.
Members of a virtual group often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They tend to have more autonomy than members of conventional teams, since their teams can meet according to different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p.109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administrative team that each member turns to. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization go through the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are utilized efficiently within the functional departments of an organization.
Consequently, a joint effort by an organization to overcome adversity can lead to an innovative process to meet the client's needs.
For an organization to be innovative, leadership must create a culture of innovation as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains continuous approximation as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provided physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, it narrows the area of research and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathologies and behavior supports the research of scientists.
It is well known that for a long time now, different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes never before seen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material to build simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has strong science-fiction connotations, it forms a very important branch of computer science that studies the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machines.
AI research involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples of these include control, planning and programming, the ability to respond to client diagnoses and questions, as well as the recognition of handwriting, voice, and face.
These things have become separate disciplines that focus on providing solutions to real-world problems.
The AI system is now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military, as it has been built into various domestic computer applications and video games.
The thematic outings are an important part of any class. Very often, a teacher would love to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or contemplate the beauty of art while sitting with their class.
Sharing a virtual trip is also an excellent way to reflect on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, each year the students of the Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the State Capital; each year the site is updated, but older versions are kept online as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often begin their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, this usually changes with the presence of an audience.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger starts to strive to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Moreover, blogs "force students to be more astute with the world around them." The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and curious (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to expand their learning beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can help students become more analytical and critical; they can define their positions within the context of what others write and also highlight their own perspectives on specific topics by actively responding to online materials (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
To the south lie the Niagara Falls, and the north is home to the pristine natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
It is all these elements, among others, that make Ontario stand out in the eyes of foreigners as a Canadian city of excellence.
The population of the large areas in the north is rather scarce, and some areas are almost wild, uninhabited lands.
For comparison of populations, which is often surprising: there are more African Americans living in the USA than Canadian citizens.
The Islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest by far, and a continent in itself when it comes to wildlife.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and are known as luxury beach tourist destinations.
The Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it embarked on a great journey to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is advisable for any female traveler to say that she is married, regardless of her actual marital status.
It's also useful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women should realize that cultural differences can cause what they would consider harassment, and it is not uncommon to be pursued, grabbed by the arm, etc.
Reject men firmly, and don't be afraid to defend your position (with or without cultural differences, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Amazigh fishermen in the 10th century BC, and Phoenicians, Romans, and Benimerins used it as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city with the name Daru l-Badya; the name Casablanca comes from the Spanish merchants who established commercial bases there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in Morocco.
Around the old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a wide range of souvenirs, but it's all geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the easternmost part, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
While Goma is considerably safe, it would be advisable to investigate before making any trip outside the city to assess the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the most affordable mountain gorilla tracking experiences in Africa.
You can use the boda-boda (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is around 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuctoo" has ended up being used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger, due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during the special program "Africa: Henry Louis Gates' Journey" on PBS.
The city stands in stark contrast to the rest of the country's cities because it has a more Arab feel than African.
Kruger National Park is located in northeastern South Africa and follows the border with Mozambique to the east and with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River marks the southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting diverse wildlife.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the benchmark for South African national parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, a daily conservation and entry fee must be paid.
It may also be beneficial to buy a Wild Card, which allows entry either to a selection of South African parks or to all of South Africa's National Parks.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that many tourists consider the main center.
The complex of buildings that make up the urban silhouette of Hong Kong has been associated with a bright bar graph that becomes evident with the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the other side of Kowloon's waterfront promenade.
The vast majority of urban development on the island of Hong Kong is densely populated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonizers occupied, therefore it's a good spot to start if you're looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 mi) inland in Bangladesh and India from the coast.
UNESCO has declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. The part of the forest within Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not only mangrove swamps, but they also include some of the last remaining stops of the powerful jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
The Sundarbans cover an area of 3,850 km², of which around one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have become a wildlife sanctuary, and it is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the buses between districts are often full, it is advisable to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses, which are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a quick and comfortable way to get around nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Panakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River bridge is a cable-stayed bridge. It spans the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers have a height of 83 meters, a length of 378 meters, and have two lanes with a width of 3.50 meters.
The open space vertically under the bridge is 15 meters. Although the construction was completed in August 2011, it was not possible to access it until March 2017.
It is expected that the bridge will be fully functional in September 2017, when it is hoped that the Brazilian customs will be ready.
The Guaranis were the most important indigenous group inhabiting what is now eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as "The Giant Province of the Indies," was created in the 16th century as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish initiated a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to maintain a large part of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The most important annual tournament of this sport takes place in December at the Las Cañitas polo fields.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be seen here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments or where to buy tickets for polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), with a value equivalent to a British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank in the islands, which is located in Stanley, in front of the FIC West shop.
Generally, British pounds are accepted throughout the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the peripheral islands, although they may accept British and US currency; check with the owners in advance to determine which method of payment is accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange currency from the Falkland Islands outside the islands, so you have to do it before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above 30 °C are common.
Winter can be falsely cold: temperatures rarely reach below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make the feeling colder than what the thermometer indicates.
There are no particularly "rainy" or "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is more or less invariable throughout the year.
Even though many of the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, they are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, please stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may seem, bison, elk, bears, wolves, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors end up injured for not leaving enough distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so give them their space.
Moreover, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of almost 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a famous act of insubordination in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruise liner. Furthermore, nearly 200 lives were lost from the United States and Germany.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city resulted in the death of supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
The beaches are abundant, as Auckland is situated between two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Most of them are sandy beaches where swimming is safe, and most have shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are sometimes family-friendly beaches with a good range of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most well-known local beer is "Number One"; it's not a complex beer, but it's pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta".
You can drink many French wines there, but wines from New Zealand and Australia don't quite tolerate travel well.
It's definitely safe to drink tap water locally, but if you're worried, bottled water is easy to find.
For Australians, the concept of a cut (coffee) is foreign. A short coffee is an espresso, a cappuccino comes loaded with cream (without foam), and tea is served without milk.
The melted chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juices are expensive, but the quality is excellent.
Throughout the year, many trips are made to the cliff and injuries due to any of these causes are rare.
Despite this, follow the recommendations of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish are found near beaches and river estuaries from October to April in northern 1770. Occasionally, they can also be found outside of these months.
Sharks exist, although they rarely attack humans. Most sharks fear humans and avoid them.
Saltwater crocodiles are not actively found in the ocean; their main habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the peace of mind of knowing they will have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer, or even combined packages with flight and hotel.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or to submit other documents for your destination (such as a visa).
Any request or suggestion should first be sent to the travel agency and not to the hotel.
In some festivals, the vast majority of attendees decide to camp there, and most attendees consider it a vital part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you'll need to arrive well in advance to get a spot to camp near the music.
It should be remembered that even though the music has ended on the main stages, there may still be sections of the festival continuing to play well into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
If you cross the Baltic Sea in winter, check the location of the ice floe, because crossing the ice generates a terrible noise in the most affected areas.
Cruises to Saint Petersburg include time in the city. Passenger cruises are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos often strive to maximize the time and money their visitors spend there. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits can be difficult to find.
They often have special foods, drinks, and entertainment offers to encourage guests to stay at the establishment.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages inside the house. However, intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know it's important to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or in mountainous areas should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
Friction is low on icy and snowy roads, and you can't drive as if you were on bare asphalt.
During snowstorms, a quantity of snow can fall sufficient to get you trapped in a very short time.
Visibility can also be reduced by falling snow or snow displaced by the wind, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues without many disruptions throughout the year.
Probably safaris are the main tourist attraction in Africa and the most relevant for many tourists.
The term "safari" in popular usage refers to a land journey to see the fantastic African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants or giraffes, tend to approach cars, and the standard equipment will allow for good views.
Animals like lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and that's why you'll be able to see them better using binoculars.
A walking safari (also known as a "rural hike," "hiking safari," or going "for a walk") involves hiking, for a few hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the first Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympic Games, having hosted the games in 1964.
If you booked your flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might find yourself in a delicate situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but since the end of March, most cancellation policies due to the coronavirus no longer extend to July 2020, when the Olympic Games were supposed to be held.
Most tickets for the event are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with a typical ticket costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help dry them. In many hotels, you can ask for an iron and an ironing board, even if there isn't one in the room.
If there isn't an ironing board available or if you don't like wearing ironed hosiery, then you can try using a hairdryer, if one is available.
Be careful not to let the fabric overheat (it could shrink or, in extreme cases, scorch).
There are different ways to purify water, and some are more effective against certain dangers.
In some areas, boiling the water for a minute is enough; in others, a few minutes are needed.
Effectiveness varies from filter to filter, and if you have concerns, you should consider buying bottled water from a well-known brand in sealed bottles.
Travelers may encounter animal plagues that they are not familiar with in their regions of origin.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in worse cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases, or animals capable of hurting or killing people by force, are not normally considered plagues.
Duty-free shopping is an opportunity to buy goods exempt from taxes and duties in certain locations.
Travelers tied to countries with high taxation can sometimes save a considerable amount of money, especially on products such as alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which frequently passes through isolated wooded areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: they are characterized by steep slopes, narrow stretches, and sharp curves.
The indicated speed limits are notably lower than those of previous and subsequent sections – generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence to these limits is even more important than usual.
Even though it's curious, the mobile phone service is stronger here than in many other parts of the route, such as Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastry is quite good, and Bavarian pastry is plentiful and very diverse, similar to that of Austria, its southern neighbors.
Fruit pastries are common, with cooked apples inside the pastries all year round and cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German oven-baked products also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other dried fruits. The most well-known cakes often pair well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want small pastries, but full of flavor, try what is known as a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
A stew is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
The dough can be either "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries; in southern India and other coastal regions of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian food is a generic term to cover a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if it is used without any other qualification, the term usually means the native food of the central and eastern regions of the main island of Java.
Nowadays, Javanese cuisine is easy to find everywhere in the archipelago and offers a great variety of simply seasoned dishes. The favorite flavors of the Javanese people are those of peanuts, shrimp paste, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang on each side of the saddle.
They are more stable for the rider, but they can pose safety problems because the rider's feet could get caught in them.
If a rider falls from a horse but has a foot caught in the stirrup, they could be dragged if the horse runs away. Various safety precautions can be taken to minimize this risk.
To begin with, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and a thin sole and are quite thin.
Furthermore, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the saddle leather to fall away from the saddle if a rider pulls it back when falling.
The Cochamó Valley: Chile's most prominent climbing destination, also known as the Yosemite of South America, boasts many large granite walls and cliffs.
The views are impressive from the peaks. Climbers from all over the world continuously establish new routes along their endless expanse of cliffs.
Alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that consist of sliding down snow-covered slopes on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an important travel activity with many enthusiasts, often known as "ski bums," who plan their entire vacation around skiing in a particular location.
The concept of skiing is very old – there are cave paintings symbolizing skiers from before 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, but it was in 1861 that some Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Traveling with a backpack while skiing: this activity is also known as ski touring, ski tourism, or ski hiking.
He is related to it, but it generally doesn't imply alpine skiing or mountaineering, the latter executed on rugged terrain and requiring much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine a ski route that is like a hiking trail.
In good condition, you'll be able to cover slightly longer distances than walking – although on few occasions you'll achieve the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on flat trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling between several countries would involve having to make many visa applications and passport checks.
The Schengen Area, nevertheless, functions as a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having to go through passport control again.
Similarly, having a Schengen visa means you don't need to apply for a visa for each of the Schengen countries separately, saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition for manufactured articles that are considered antiques. Some tax agencies determine that goods older than 100 years are antiques.
The definition has geographical differences, where the age limit may be lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
Handicraft products can be classified as antiques, even though they are more recent than other similar articles produced in mass.
Reindeer herding is an important means of subsistence among the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trading market is also important to many with other professions.
Even in tradition, however, not all the Sami people have been associated with large-scale reindeer herding, but rather they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, keeping reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern professions. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi territory.
Although it is widely used, especially among non-Romani people, the word "Gitano" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of the Romani people.
If the country you will visit is subject to any traffic alerts, your travel or cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might find it interesting to hear the recommendations of different governments than yours, but their recommendations are intended for their citizens.
For example, US citizens in the Middle East could be exposed to different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
The councils are simply a brief summary of the political situation of a country.
The considerations presented are usually brief, general, and overly simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Extreme weather condition is the general term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, significant social disruption, or loss of human life.
Extreme weather conditions can occur worldwide, and there are different types that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and uncontrolled fires are forms and effects of adverse climate phenomena, such as storms, tornadoes, waterspouts, and cyclones.
Among severe regional and seasonal atmospheric phenomena are hailstorms, snowstorms, and sandstorms.
It is strongly recommended that travelers be aware of any adverse weather risks that may affect their area, as this could alter their travel plans.
Anyone intending to visit a country that could be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
A web search for "Hostile Environment Course" will probably offer the address of a local company.
A course will normally cover all the problems that have been discussed here in more detail, usually with practical experience.
A course will normally last from 2 to 5 days and will include role-playing games, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines about survival in the wilderness are common, but there are few publications that deal with war zones.
Travelers planning to have gender reassignment surgery in another country must ensure they bring valid documents for their return trip.
The availability of governments to issue passports that do not specify gender (X) or updated documents to show the desired name or gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to honor these documents can vary widely.
Records at security checkpoints have also become increasingly intrusive in the post-9/11 era.
Pre-operative transsexual people should not have to wait to be scanned with their privacy and dignity intact.
Rip currents are the flow that returns after waves crash against the beach, often at a reef or similar structure.
Due to the topology of the water, the return flow concentrates in a few deeper stations, and a strong current towards deep waters can form there.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of fatigue when attempting to swim back against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you get out of the current, swimming backward isn't any more difficult than usual.
Try to head somewhere you won't be captured again, or, depending on your skills or whether you've been informed, perhaps you'd prefer to wait for a rescue.
The backlash comes before the culture shock (with a smaller honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who have easily adapted to a new culture often find it particularly difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you've already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits of your native culture.
When you went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding at first, knowing that travelers in a new country need to adapt.
Sometimes people don't anticipate that patience and understanding are also needed when travelers return home.
The sound and light show of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for children.
You can see the pyramids in the dark and in silence before the show begins.
Generally, you can hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is almost a fairy tale.
The Sphinx establishes itself as a backdrop and the narrator of a long story.
The scenes from the story are shown above the pyramids, which are illuminated at the same time.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by many nations and have the majority of bases, with sixteen active as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among others, there are the Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano still provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the southern region of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula here merge and form a plateau, then reemerge to form the 360 km Ellsworth Mountains range, originating from the Minnesota Glacier.
The northern part, or Sentinel Range, has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with a maximum of 4,892 m at Mount Vinson.
In remote locations with no phone coverage, satellite telephony may be your only option.
A satellite phone is not always a substitute for a mobile phone, as you need to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to make a phone call.
The service is often used on vessels, including recreational boats, as well as on expeditions that require remote data and imagery.
Your local phone service provider should be able to give you more information on how to connect to this service.
A growingly popular option among people considering a sabbatical year is to travel and learn.
This is especially popular among students who haven't finished their studies, giving them the opportunity to take a year off before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
Enrolling in a gap year course abroad can often improve your chances of restarting higher education in your home country.
Typically, there will be enrollment fees to sign up for these educational programs.
Finland is an important sailing destination. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, within the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht in archipelagos and lakes.
Although any yacht can sail through the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Competitive sailing is a national pastime in Finland, with one boat for every 7 or 8 people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but it is equally quite special (for example, in the Netherlands the figure is one in forty).
The majority of the various Baltic cruises have a prolonged stay in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
This means it's possible to visit the city's historic center by spending a couple of full days back on the overnight ship.
If you only disembark with excursions on board, you don't need any independent visa (as of 2009).
Some cruises feature Berlin, Germany, in their brochures. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is nowhere near the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a terrifying experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, particularly if they haven't flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.
It's not a reason for shame: there's no difference between it and the fears and anxieties that many people express towards other things.
For some, having an understanding of how an airplane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome a fear that is based on the unknown or on not having control.
Courier companies charge well for delivering things quickly. Often, time is very important for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On some routes, the larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem with other routes and smaller companies.
If they sent things by plane, there are routes where unloading and passing through customs can take days.
The only way to send it faster was to check it as baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger carrying it, and that's where you come in.
The obvious way to fly first class or business class is to pay a lot of money for this privilege (or, even better, get your company to do it for you).
Now, this isn't cheap: generally, you can expect to pay up to four times the price of the economy fare for business class, and up to eleven times for first class!
In general, it doesn't make sense to look for discounts on business or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airline companies know well that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay more for the privilege of arriving at a destination quickly and comfortably, and to pay accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is commonly used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered ethnic conflicts.
In 1994, the conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria, in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, although it is not recognized by any member state of the United Nations.
Economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey, with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transport hub.
The former city of Smyrna is now a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center, situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades, and modern shopping centers are dotted with traditional red-tiled roofs, the 18th-century market, and ancient mosques and churches, although the city exudes an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, you can enjoy views of the neighboring island of Eysturoy. There is also a very unusual octagonal church.
In the churchyard, there are some interesting sculptures of doves made of marble on some tombs.
It's worth taking a walk for half an hour to an hour and a half through the interesting town.
Northward, easily accessible, lies the romantic and fascinating town of Sintra, which became famous to foreigners after a brilliant account of its splendors was recorded by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb 403 bus goes to Sintra regularly, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
You can also visit the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fátima in the north, a place of Marian apparitions known throughout the world.
Please remember that you are essentially visiting a mass cemetery and a place with a significance that is almost incalculable to a significant portion of the world's population.
Many men and many women remain who survived their stay here, and many more who had loved ones who were murdered or died there from overwork, both Jewish and non-Jewish.
Please treat the place with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or the Nazis.
Do not damage the place by painting or scratching graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Close to half prefer to speak in Catalan, a large majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
Now, most of the signs are only in Catalan because it is, by law, the official priority language.
Nevertheless, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the metro are made only in Catalan, but unexpected disruptions are announced with an automated system in many languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians have a reputation for being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although this is usually just an imprecise stereotype, the best way to behave in Paris is to act as well as you can, act like someone who is "well-bred" (well-educated). This will allow you to get around much more easily.
The brusque appearance of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show a minimum of courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is very wooded, with firs, spruces, and pines, and it shelters a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Enjoy a remarkable variety of plant communities, thanks to its range of microclimates, different soils, and diverse altitudes.
The area is also home to a vast variety of animal and bird species.
You can find peculiar fauna there, such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, nightjar, lynx, wildcat, and wild partridge, along with many other more common species.
During visits to the monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries offer headscarves to women who don't bring their own, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, you'll get a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should also wear trousers that cover their knees.
This item can also be requested at the front desk, but it's clothing that isn't washed after each use, so you might find wearing these skirts uncomfortable. The size is one size only!
Mallorcan cuisine, like that of other similar Mediterranean regions, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
A simple and popular meal, especially in summer, is Pa amb oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and any condiment available such as cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, as well as the pronoun "you," always begin with a capital letter, even if they appear in the middle of a sentence.
This is a good way to distinguish some verbs with objects.
It can be stated that it facilitates reading, although the writing is a bit complicated because you have to figure out if a verb or adjective is used in a nominalized way.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to watch out for are c and g, as their pronunciation varies depending on the vowels that follow them.
Furthermore, make sure to pronounce the "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means cart.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading these basic concepts about grammar will greatly help you learn Persian grammar and better understand its sentences.
It goes without saying that if you know a Romance language, you will find it easier to learn Portuguese.
However, people who know how to speak a little Spanish can hastily conclude that Portuguese resembles it so much that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are mostly obsolete today, and remain as museums, or places of education.
Because light pollution wasn't a problem at the time it is today, they are normally found in cities or on campuses, which are easier to access than those built currently.
Most modern research telescopes are enormous installations in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The contemplation of cherry blossoms, an activity known as hanami, has been part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where the cherry blossom was the most prized.
In Japan, the first celebrations of the cherry blossoms were organized by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally arranged garden and pick up any "specimen," you will also be expelled without hesitation.
Generally, Singapore is an extremely safe place and very easy to get around, and you can buy practically anything after arriving.
However, by situating yourself in the "high tropics" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to contend with both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are also some buses that travel north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you want to take goes to Hebron and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways could be a good theme for basing a vacation on.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to the interesting cities of the Danube, or sailing through the Erie Canal.
They also establish routes for well-known hiking and cycling trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it celebrates the birth of Jesus.
Also, non-believers from Christian and non-Christian countries around the world have adopted many of the traditions surrounding the festival.
There is a tradition of spending Easter night holding vigil in some open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it is very plausible that it is a spring and fertility ritual predating Christianity.
The most traditional churches often celebrate an Easter Vigil on the Saturday night during the Easter weekend, and the congregations usually begin the celebrations at midnight to celebrate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
The great distance from the continent prevented mammals from traveling there, and this led to the giant tortoise becoming the first grazing animal in the Galápagos.
Since the arrival of humans in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced there, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, during which the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a great opportunity to see the aurora borealis, as the sky will remain dark practically all day.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is not usually a problem, you will also be able to enjoy the stars.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Westerners are accustomed to seeing.
The suits are the standard attire in businesses, and colleagues address each other by their last names or job titles.
Peace in the workplace is crucial, emphasizing the group's effort more than congratulating individual successes.
Workers often need the approval of their superiors for any decision they make, and it is expected that they obey their superiors' instructions without questioning them.
