This not only confirms the long-held theory that some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides further details that general fossils cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say the fur of this animal is brown like a chestnut on top and has a pale or carotene-like color on the bottom.
The discoveries regarding the aforementioned matter also further illuminate the deep evolution of feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft called a rachis, but possessed other bird feather characteristics such as down and barbs, researchers concluded that the rachis likely evolved later than these other features.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or primarily for display. Researchers point out that even though this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the specimen shows it's fully grown bird plumage, not down feathers.
Researchers pointed out that even though it is a tail from a relatively young dinosaur, the specimen shows that this is the plumage of a fully grown bird, not the down of a chick.

Most of the completed work aligns with theory, but this program was created to simulate the observation of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team anticipates should arise from tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
The Milky Way exerts a gravitational pull on the Sagittarius galaxy, just as the Moon pulls on the Earth, causing tides.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory states that the dark matter around one galaxy is distributed in a spherical manner around that galaxy and arises from a large number of small particles.

The infrared image shows temperature changes between day and night, suggesting these are likely caves.
During the day, the caves will be cooler than the surrounding surface, while at night they will be warmer.
"The heat they emit isn't as stable as large caves on Earth, which tend to maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it makes sense given that the lava tubes go deep into the ground," said Glen Cushing of the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) team, the Astrophysical Research Group, and Northern Arizona University, based in Flagstaff, Arizona.
In France, voting relies on very little technology, sticking to old methods. Voters go alone to a booth, take a pre-printed ballot paper with the candidate names, and put it in an envelope.
After the officials verify the identity of voters, voters must deposit their ballot into the ballot box and sign the voter registry.
French election law has a rather strict code outlining the procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have been required to be transparent so that voters and observers can testify that no envelopes are in the box before voting begins, and no envelopes are added, except for those of eligible voters, which will be counted appropriately.
Applicants may send a representative to act as a witness in every step. In the evening, volunteers will count the votes under strict supervision according to specific procedures.

Kier Starmer QC, Director for Public Prosecutions, announced charges this morning regarding both Huhne and Pryce.
Huhne has resigned and Ed Davey MP will replace him in the cabinet. It is expected that Norman Lamb MP will take over as Business Secretary, replacing Davey, who is about to step down.
Huhne and Pryce are scheduled to appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on February 16th.
The deceased are Nicholas Alden, 25 years old, and Zachary Cudderback, 21 years old, with Cudderback being the driver.
Edgar Vegiella sustained injuries to his arm and jaw, while Christopher Schneider required facial reconstructive surgery.
Ouka's weapon missed its target while aiming for the fifth man's head. Schneider suffered continuous pain, was blinded in one eye, had a portion of his skull removed, and underwent facial surgery using titanium.
Schneider testified via video link from a US Air Force base in his hometown.
Following the Wednesday event, Carpanedo participated in two races to compete for the title of speed champion.
Her first event was the slalom race, which she didn't finish on her first attempt. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In another competition, Giant Slalom, she finished in 10th place in the women's seated category with a total time of 4:41.30 minutes, 2:11.60 minutes slower than Claudia Loesch who finished first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary who took 9th place.
Four sit-ski racers in the women's category were unable to reach the finish line, and a total of 45 skiers out of 117 competitors in the Giant Slalom race were unable to place in the rankings.
Police in the state of Madhya Pradesh were able to recover stolen laptops and cell phones.
Deputy Inspector D. K. Arya stated, "We have arrested five individuals for the rape of a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The suspects are Baba Kanjar, Buddha Kanjar, Ramprop Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Chandra Shekhar Solanki, the police superintendent, said that the accused appeared in court while covering their face.
Even though there were three people in the house when the car crashed, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained severe head injuries.
The road is temporarily closed due to a car accident involving two vehicles, while emergency services extract the driver from a red Audi TT.
Initially, he received treatment at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been detained at Edinburgh Sheriff Court on charges of murdering his son since then.
She was detained while awaiting trial, but eyewitness testimony may be unreliable due to the widespread dissemination of her image.
In other parts of the United Kingdom, this is a common practice, but the justice system in Scotland does not operate this way, and the courts view the dissemination of photographs as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee said, "It seems that journalists are walking a dangerous path if they release all the images of suspects to the public."
The Office of the Attorney General, which is responsible for bringing lawsuits in general, clearly told reporters that there will be no further comment until legal proceedings are underway.
According to leaked reports, this document will refer to the border dispute that Palestine seeks, citing the pre-1967 Middle East War borders.
It is reported that other topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is a holy land for both countries, and issues concerning the Jordan Valley.
Israel is demanding a continued military presence for 10 years following the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian National Authority has agreed to a presence for only 5 years.
The sharpshooter team in the experimental project will receive close supervision from the forest rangers because this experimental project will be monitored and its effectiveness will be evaluated.
In collaboration with NPWS and the Australian Shooting Sports Association (NSW), suitable volunteers are selected under the hunting program of the Shooting Sports Association.
Quoting Mick O'Flannery, Acting Director of Conservation and Heritage of the National Park, along with NPWS, the marksmen who were selected for the inaugural shooting session received comprehensive training and safety briefings.
Yesterday, Martelli took an oath before the new Special Electoral Commission (CEP) with nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, the Presidential Committee recommended that the previous resignation of CEP be part of measures to lead the country to new elections.
Martelli appointed the aforementioned committee to counter the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, have been fueled by failures in election management, which have at times been the norm since 2011.
There are reports of approximately 60 cases of iPod malfunction resulting in overheating, which led to a total of 6 fires and 4 minor injuries.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan announced that they are aware of 27 accidents involving the equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had reported an additional 34 cases of overheating, which the company described as "non-serious."
The Ministry responded by stating that the postponement of Apple's report presentation "is highly unlikely."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 AM local time (21:19 UTC on Friday).
The Northern Mariana Islands Emergency Management Office reported no domestic damage.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signals indicating a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer has taken a group of Hong Kong tourists hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired an M16 rifle at tourists.
Many hostages have received assistance, and at least 6 deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released, including a Filipino photographer.
Subsequently, several photographers replaced the elderly woman because she had to go to the restroom. Mendoza was shot and defeated.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and embarked on a career in medicine.
He trained to become an obstetrician and gynecologist and began working at the Auckland Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, in his spare time, Liggins began collecting data on preterm labor.
His research shows that the use of hormones can accelerate the growth of a fetus's lungs.
Xinhua News Agency reports that government investigators have retrieved two 'black boxes,' which are flight data recorders, on Wednesday.
Luna's fellow wrestlers also expressed their admiration and praise.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Queen of Extreme, my first manager. Luna passed away on a night with two moons, a unique occurrence just like her. She was a strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Rannells commented, "Luna is just as crazy as I am... maybe even crazier... I love her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place now."
From the 1,400 people who voted before the 2010 federal election, the number who opposed making Australia a republic increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Julia Gillard, acting prime minister, said during the 2010 election campaign that she believed Australia would become a republic upon the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of those who took the opinion poll want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Queen of Australia.
According to a survey of extreme viewpoints, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should absolutely not become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist will have to swim 100m and 200m freestyle, and also participate in four relay races at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have raised doubts about his physical abilities.
He was unable to take the necessary medication to overcome the pain because these medications were prohibited during the competition.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor from Central Missouri University, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Many people have verified the accuracy of the discovery using different hardware and software by early February, and the matter was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets are a source of water delivered to Earth, along with organic compounds that can create proteins and help sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, particularly the formation of Earth, since its collision with a comet long ago.
Cuomo, 53, took office as governor earlier this year, and last month signed into law a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called this rumor "political nonsense and stupidity."
It was predicted that he would run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will enable aircraft to travel on shorter routes and also save millions of gallons of fuel each year, while also reducing carbon emissions.
The technology used is satellite-based, which differs from older ground-based radar technology. This helps air traffic controllers pinpoint aircraft positions more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
There will be no additional transport services, and trains will not stop at Wembley. There will be no parking on the ground and no parking places with connections to public transport.
The fear of transportation shortages makes it possible that this game will be forced to be played quietly without team sponsors.
The study results, published in a scientific journal on Thursday, report on the emergence of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that this new subspecies evolved within just two generations, despite it being believed that this process would take longer. This is because it resulted from a hybridisation between the endemic Darwin's finch (Geospiza fortes) and the Cactus finch (Geospiza conirostris).
We can shape gold into various forms and can also roll it into miniature shapes.
Gold can be drawn into thin wires, which can then be twisted and woven into patterns, and it can also be hammered or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made into extremely thin sheets and applied to other metals. It can be made so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted illustrations in books, which are called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can create an indicator by using red cabbage water.
Cabbage water changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemicals.
The pH value will be determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H⁺ in pH) present in the tested chemical.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has had an electron removed (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two types of dry powder together. Then, using clean, damp hands, squeeze and shape it into a ball.
The moisture on your hand will react with the outer layer, giving a strange feeling and forming in the form of a crust.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets connected to a sophisticated sewage disposal system.
The remains of wastewater treatment systems have been discovered in houses in various cities of the Minoan civilization of Crete and on Santorini in Greece.
In ancient Egypt, Persia, and China, there were also toilets. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses that were used by both men and women.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, that means you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space receive signals and reflect them back to Earth almost instantly.
Satellites are launched into space using rockets. Scientists need to use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere refracts and distorts some of our view of light.
A giant rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
Wheels have changed the world in an unbelievable way. The greatest thing wheels have given us is the convenience and speed of transportation.
It has enabled us to have trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Following them are medium-sized tigers and lions, which prey on medium-sized animals ranging from rabbits to wild boar and deer.
Ultimately, there are many small cats (including feral domestic cats) that eat much smaller prey such as insects, rodents, reptiles like geckos, and birds.
Their secret to success lies in the concept of a personal life purpose, which each cat adheres to in order to avoid competing with others.
Lions are cats and are the most social felines, living in large groups called prides.
A pride of lions consists of one to three adult male lions, along with many lionesses and cubs, up to 30 in number.
Because it's a large family consisting of older sisters and daughters, the females often have close relationships with each other.
A pride of lions behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, which are surprisingly similar to lions in terms of their behavior (but not as much as other large cat species), and they are also extremely dangerous to their prey.
The tiger is a skilled athlete, capable of climbing, swimming, jumping long distances, and pulling with five times the strength of a strong human.
Tigers are in the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (genus Panthera). These four cat species are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is different from the full-throated roar of a lion, but it's more like a series of growls and threats, word by word.
Wild cats like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rats, and birds, with nearly all the prey that wild cats hunt being smaller than themselves.
Scientists believe that wild cats track and search for prey by sniffing to determine where their prey has been on the ground.
They can see well in the dark due to their nocturnal vision, and they move cautiously. Ocelot wild cats hunt prey by camouflaging themselves with their surroundings and then pouncing.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population (such as by moving to a mountain range or river, or moving to a new island so that they cannot easily return to where they once were), those living things often find themselves in an environment different from the original.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population must possess different qualities or have the ability to adapt to become stronger competitors than before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need to adapt in the same way as before.
As time passes, the new population will gradually blend in with their new environment, appearing less distinct from other populations.
After hundreds of thousands, or even millions, of years, the two populations had diverged so much that they could no longer be considered the same species.
We call this process speciation, which refers to the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and is considered an important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which humans use to breathe, and absorb carbon dioxide, which humans exhale (that is, breathing out).
Plants create food from the sun through photosynthesis and also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothing and food, which are the majority of what we eat. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the ultimate predator of its era. It feared nothing except another mosasaur.
Its long jaw was filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with a special set of teeth on the roof of its mouth, meaning nothing that entered would escape.
We don't know for sure, but it may have had a forked tongue, and its diet consisted of turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have even been cannibalistic.
It also attacks anything that enters the water, even giant dinosaurs like the Tyrannosaurus Rex are no match for it.
Although most of the Romans' food was familiar to us, they also had strange or peculiar dishes for feasts, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormouse.
Another difference is that while the poor and the women eat while sitting on chairs, the rich prefer to eat lavishly together, reclining lazily to the side while dining.
It is not possible to include foods originating from America or Asia that came to Europe in many centuries later as Roman food.
For example, ancient Romans had no corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or even cocoa, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built the main temple, considered the dwelling place for each deity.
People will bring offerings to the gods, and the priests will strive to fulfill the gods' wishes through various ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open courtyard, followed by inner temples accessible only to monks.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The top of the tower is a special dwelling place for the gods.
The climate in the Middle East is warm, so houses don't hold much importance.
Jewish families largely live in the open.
The women will cook in the field. The shop is just an open counter facing the road. Stones were used to build houses.
The land of Canaan had no large forests, so wood was extremely expensive.
There were only scattered settlers in Finland. Norse legends say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and on his westward voyage, he discovered Greenland and named it as such.
Even though he was the discoverer, the Eskimo tribe was already living there at that time.
Even though each country is "Scandinavian," the people, royalty, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland are very different from one another.
If you've seen the movie "The Boondock Saints," you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even though something is written on the back of the document, it's still not a treasure map.
The text written on the back of the Declaration of Independence is the phrase "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776," and the text appears at the bottom of the document when it is turned over.
Although no one knows for sure who the author is, we do know that in the early part of its life, this large hide document (measuring 29¾ inches × 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage.
Therefore, it is possible that notes have been added to the label format.
The landings in Normandy and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but the south remained free.
This place was ruled by the French from "Vichy," which was a group of French people who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded the southern part of France. This invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
American and Free French forces liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany within just two weeks.
Civilization is a distinct culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together in society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," meaning citizen. It is related to the Latin word "civis," meaning citizen, and the word "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and also defines the size of a society.
City-states serve as displays of a nation's advanced culture, demonstrating the transmission of knowledge across generations, enduring cultural footprints, and equitable expansion.
Subcultures often fade away without leaving any related historical evidence and are not recognized as appropriate civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first established a provisional national government under the Articles of Confederation, with a Congress as its sole component.
The Congress has no power to levy taxes, and because there are no national executives or judges, it must rely on government agencies which often do not cooperate in enforcing all of the actions of the legislature.
Moreover, the U.S. Congress still lacks the authority to repeal tax laws and interstate tariff rates.
Legislation must receive unanimous consent from all states before it can be amended, and the states don't pay much attention to the federal government. Even the representatives of each state don't frequently attend.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are considered the two most successful teams in the world, and both teams were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, with Italians participating in international and Olympic-level competitions.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (Honshu is the largest). This results in Japan being the 7th largest island country in the world!
Due to the fact that Japan's territory is full of groups or islands, Japan is often called "the archipelago" based on its geographical characteristics.
Taiwan originated in the 15th century when European sailors who passed by recorded the name of this island as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a shift in traditional grain production methods and employing Chinese laborers to work on rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan, and declared Taiwan a prefecture of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), in 1895, the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan. This allowed Japan to rule the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu, the ruins of the ancient Inca civilization, consists of three main structural components: the Intihuatana stone (a solar clock), the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings in the area along the cluster of buildings have been rebuilt to give tourists the opportunity to see what they originally looked like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored and repaired, and the restoration work continues to this day.
For example, the most common still camera format in the world is 35mm, which was an important film size during the end of the analog film era.
Currently, this type of film is still being produced, but the more important issue is that the aspect ratio is derived from the image sensor format of digital cameras.
Actually, the 35mm format, which is 33mm wide and 24mm high, is quite confusing.
The ratio of this form (divided by 12 to become the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore 3:2.
Various common formats (such as formats in the APS family, etc.) have approximately equal or similar values to the image ratio.
The often-underestimated and frequently ridiculed rule of thirds is a simple guideline for creating dynamism while maintaining a sense of order in an image.
Which specifies that the most effective position for the main object is at the intersection of the lines that divide the image into three parts both vertically and horizontally (see example).
In this period of European history, the wealthy and powerful Catholic Church is being thoroughly scrutinized.
It has been over a thousand years that Christianity has linked various states in Europe together, despite differences in language and tradition.
The power that spreads out affects all sectors, from the monarchy to the common people.
One of the key principles of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and extreme poverty, and church funds are specifically intended for this purpose.
The central authority of the church was in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth has led many to question whether this religious belief has been practiced authentically.
Shortly after the war broke out, Britain blockaded Germany's sea lanes of communication.
It has been proven that the strategy is effective by depriving the area of vital military and civilian supplies, even though such a blockade violates generally accepted international law, codified in numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
Britain laid mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering various parts of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a response similar to an unrestricted submarine warfare campaign.
In the 1920s, most citizens and countries desired peace and independence.
After witnessing the horrors and brutality of World War I, nations no longer wanted such a situation to occur again in the future.
In 1884 (B.E. 2427), Tesla moved to the United States to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States with 4 cents, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batcheller (his manager from a previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had unique and special ways of depicting different periods, dividing them into eras of Chinese history or by each ruling family that held power as a dynasty with distinct characteristics.
During the periods between dynasties, it was an era when various provinces were isolated and lacked stability. The best-known period is the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
A fierce war between many nobles fighting to seize the throne took place during these times.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history, with tens of thousands of people dying in the battles for the throne in the imperial palace of Xi'an.
The social and political impacts have been numerous, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolute monarchy to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
After the revolution, various careers remained open to all male applicants, providing opportunities for the most ambitious and successful individuals to thrive.
For the military, it is the same. Instead of appointing ranks according to hierarchy, they appoint based on the caliber of the barrel.
Furthermore, the French Revolution inspired the oppressed working classes in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond ordinary life. He often went to a cave later known as "Hira" on Mount "Nour" (Light) to meditate.
The cave itself, having survived the passage of time, reveals a clear image of inclination regarding spiritual matters.
This cave is located on a peak, one that is north of Mecca and completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find it, even if you know it exists. Once you enter the cave, it's like being completely cut off from the outside world.
Besides the bright and beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains surrounding it, there is nothing else to be seen. You can barely see or hear anything from the outside world when inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still exists today.
This Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of the many large pyramid structures erected to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, or the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings of Egypt, consists of numerous pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the largest), many smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The large pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The "inverted bow" symbol looks like a V, while the "upside-down bow" symbol looks like a staple or a square with no bottom.
Up means you should start at the tip of the handle, then the handle goes up. Down means you should start at the horsehair grip of the handle (the position where your hand is holding the handle), then the handle goes down.
Normally, drawing the bow upwards on the violin produces a softer sound, while drawing it downwards produces a more powerful and resonant sound.
You can draw your own markings, but remember that the printed bar lines are for musical reasons, so normally you should respect them.
King Louis XVI, his fearful queen Marie Antoinette, their children (Marie Thérèse, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and Madame Elizabeth, the king's sister, were forced by a mob of market women to leave Versailles and return to Paris on October 6, 1789.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage surrounded by a mob shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd pressured the king and queen to remain visible by keeping their carriage windows open throughout.
At one point, one person in the crowd swung the head of the royal guard who had been murdered at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The Filipino people themselves had to bear the costs of the war to conquer the Philippines for American imperialism.
They were compelled to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover most of the expenses and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Certainly, the high profits derived from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people will be counted as a fundamental benefit of the United States' imperialistic ideology.
To understand the Knights Templar, we must first understand the context that led to their founding.
The era in which this event occurred is generally called the High Middle Ages, which spans the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000-1300) of European history.
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which is generally considered to have ended around 1500.
Defining the direction of technology is a comprehensive term encompassing a wide range of ideas that are put into practice, from driving technological advancement or technological necessity to the more literal meaning that the fate of humanity is driven by fundamental logic related to scientific laws and expressed in the form of technology.
Generally speaking, interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that technology develops along paths largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology has a "impact" on existing society naturally, rather than being shaped by social conditions.
For example, we can say that cars inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, the nationwide road network will not be economically viable if only a few cars are in use. Therefore, new manufacturing methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Furthermore, the sheer number of car owners contributes to an increase in road accidents, which has led to the development of new techniques for repairing damaged car bodies.
Idealism has a large component of objective cultural elements, which were derived from many writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time, traditions and cultures related to that geography emerge. These, being congruent with the location of society, are preferable to arbitrary laws.
Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of Europe during the feudal era, just as Paris is renowned as the global fashion capital in contemporary times.
The reputation as the center of luxury began around the 4th century AD and persisted until around the 11th century AD.
This place declined in status during the twelfth century, primarily due to the Crusaders returning gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was then that the fashion capital shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style was most popular between the 10th and 11th centuries, and the 14th century.
In the early period, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the East.
However, slow communication channels may cause Western styles to be 25 to 30 years behind.
As the Middle Ages drew to a close, Western Europeans began to develop their own distinct styles. One of the most significant developments during this period was the adoption of buttons by Crusaders for fastening clothing.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple system that often involves organic farming, utilizing locally adapted seeds and crop rotation or other simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers have engaged in agriculture for their livelihood, and this remains the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals with similar ways of thinking who feel overlooked by societal norms, and help them develop a deeper sense of self.
Subcultures may have distinct differences due to the age, ethnicity, social class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The various attributes that define one subculture's distinctiveness may be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender-related, geographical, or a combination of many factors.
Members of subcultures often express their membership through distinctive styles that are specific symbols, such as fashion, manners, and specialized vocabulary, etc.
One of the most commonly used methods to demonstrate the importance of socialization is to utilize the cases of unfortunate children who have been abandoned, deprived, or intentionally abused, and who have not received proper socialization from adults during their upbringing.
Children of this type are called "violent" or delinquents. Some violent children are confined by people (who are often their own parents). In some cases, abandoning a child results from parents being unable to accept the child's intellectual or physical disabilities.
Children from troubled backgrounds may have experienced severe abuse in childhood or had emotional wounds before being abandoned or fleeing.
Other people are said to be cared for by pets, and some even say they live in the forest on their own.
When raised by non-human animals, children in a feral state will exhibit (within physical limitations) almost all the behaviors of the animals that raised them, such as fear or indifference toward humans.
Although project-based learning is likely to make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding instruction can do even more.
Scaffolding is not a method of learning, but rather a support system for individuals learning new things, such as using new computer programs or starting new projects.
Scaffolding can be in both physical and virtual forms. For example, a teacher is one form of scaffolding, but even a small paperclip in Microsoft Office is scaffolding as well.
Virtual Scaffolds are integrated within the software itself and are designed to pose questions, stimulate thinking, and explain steps that students might find difficult to manage independently.
Children are placed with foster families for a variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment, abuse, or even coercion.
No child should have to grow up in an environment devoid of care, attention, and education, yet they did grow up in such an environment.
We understand that the foster family system is a safe haven for these children.
Our family care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should include providing all necessary items that were lacking in the home where the child previously lived before being taken into care.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The distinct characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and ways to create satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "social interaction" are considered important motivators for internet use (James et al., 1995).
When they examined audience reactions to the Eighmey and McCord (1998) website, they also identified "personalized engagement" and "long-term relationships" as new motivators.
The adoption of video recording has led to significant discoveries about the interpretation of fleeting facial expressions—facial movements occurring in milliseconds.
Especially, there are claims that we can detect whether a person is lying or not by correctly interpreting subtle facial expressions that flash for a moment.
Oliver Sacks stated in his research paper titled "On the Neurology of Political Speech" that how can individuals who are unable to understand speech due to brain injury assess sincerity?
He further pointed out that certain types of animals, such as domestic dogs, may also possess these abilities in interpreting human behavior.
Research during the 20th century indicates that there are two groups of genetic changes: those that are silent and those that are expressed.
Mutation has increased genetic diversity, and the process of selection has filtered those out of the expressed diversity.
Separation and recombination alternate between the two generations.
In savanna grasslands, mammals with a human-like digestive system are able to meet their amino acid requirements from the scarce plant resources available.
Furthermore, the inability to do so could lead to severe consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The most easily accessible plant resources would likely be the protein found in leaves and legumes, but primates like us have difficulty digesting these unless they are cooked.
On the other hand, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) not only digest easily but also provide protein containing all essential amino acids in high quantities.
Considering everything, it's not surprising at all if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a way similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna do it today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of waking up intentionally during your normal sleep period and then falling back asleep for a short period (10-60 minutes).
You can easily do this by using an alarm clock with a soft sound to wake you up without fully waking you.
If you tend to snooze your alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it far away on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biological rhythms include drinking large amounts of fluids (especially water or teas known to be diuretics) before bed, which will necessitate getting up to urinate.
A person's internal level of peace is inversely proportional to the level of tension in their body and mind.
The less stress you have, the more positive life energy you will have. Every person has the potential to find true peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacle to this goal is our stress and negative outlook on the world.
Buddhism in Tibet is rooted in the teachings of the Buddha, but it has incorporated Mahayana teachings and numerous yogic techniques from India.
In principle, Buddhism in Tibet is very simple, consisting of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and a path of love that embraces all things.
Kundalini yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (the energy of awakening) through yoga postures, breathwork, chanting, and visualization.
The core of Tibetan meditation is deity yoga. Energy channels are purified, chakras become active, and enlightenment arises through visualizing various deities.
Germany was a common enemy of the Soviet Union and the United States in World War II, which led to cooperation between the two countries. After the war ended, conflicts arose between countries due to systemic, procedural, and cultural differences.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
It will persist for the next 40 years, and there will be genuine battles fought by proxy armies in various battlegrounds from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defensive forces collapsed, and the only hope remaining was to retreat and re-organize along the Romanian Bridgehead line.
However, overnight these plans became obsolete when over 800,000 soldiers from the Red Army of the Soviet Union entered to establish the Belarussian and Ukrainian front lines after invading the eastern territories of Poland in violation of the Treaty of Riga, the non-aggression treaty between the Soviets and Poland, and other international treaties, whether bilateral or multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods is considered the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Originally, the Royal Thai Navy's duties involved ensuring the country's ability to move people and goods, as well as hindering the enemy's ability to do the same.
One notable example recently is the Atlantic campaign of World War II, in which Americans attempted to move troops and supplies across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy, which mainly used U-boats, also attempted to stop this transport.
If the Allied forces fail, Germany might be able to conquer Britain, as it would have already successfully conquered the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began domesticating them to easily access milk, hair, meat, and hides.
Generally, goats are raised in herds that roam the hills or other pastures, similar to the more widely known method of raising sheep. Goat herders are often children or teenagers, and this method of herding animals is still commonly used today.
The cart was built in England in the early 16th century.
Even though the cart track consisted only of parallel wooden planks, it allowed the draft horse to accelerate and pull more weight compared to on the slightly rougher roads of that era.
The use of sleepers (or railroad ties) began relatively quickly to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually realized later that the rails would be more efficient with steel on top.
This has become a commonly used practice, but iron causes the wooden wheels of the cart to wear out even faster.
Finally, steel wheels replaced wooden wheels, and in 1767, steel rails were used for the first time.
The first method of transportation that humans knew was walking. Humans began to walk upright 2 million years ago with the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning "upright man").
Australopithecus, their ancestor, did not walk upright normally.
Skillful bipedalism has been found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, however, Sahelanthropus may have walked upright as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in a more environmentally friendly way by joining environmental movements and even becoming activists to mitigate future suffering to some extent.
This is similar to treating symptoms in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary fix, we should find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is clear that the world has changed significantly due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and problems have also increased because of overpopulation and the wasteful lifestyles of people.
After being approved by the Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by John Hancock, President of the Congress, and Charles Thomson, Secretary of the Congress, was sent to John Dunlap's printing house, just a few blocks away.
Throughout the night, approximately 150 to 200 copies were created, which are currently known as the "Dunlap broadside."
John Nixon first read this document publicly at Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, which he read to the troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving declarations of independence are the oldest copies of this document that remain. The handwritten original is no longer available.
Many paleontologists today believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and lives today. We call those dinosaurs birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But birds have many things that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet and claws. They lay eggs and walk on two hind legs, just like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers currently in use rely on data management, which is written in the form of binary code.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values: 0 or 1. These numbers are called binary digits, or bits, in computer terminology.
Internal poisoning may not manifest immediately. Various symptoms, such as vomiting, are commonly observed and not readily diagnosable.
One of the best indicators of potential poisoning may be the presence of open containers of household poisonous medications or chemicals.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that poison.
An entomologist formally calls this group of insects beetles.
This word comes from familiarity with the "reud" boat since ancient times, as the "reud" is an insect that has adapted very well to live on the bodies of humans.
Both the golden stick insect and the flea are species that cannot take care of themselves when they hatch. They must adapt to living in the nest or dwelling of their caretaker.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 people with multiple sclerosis (MS), making it one of the leading countries in the diagnosis of neurological disorders in adolescents and young adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
Research has found that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis (MS) as men.
The couple decided that raising a baby was not something they or their child wanted.
These couples may choose to have children by planning to adopt.
In adopting a child, the biological parents will terminate their parental rights so that another married couple can raise the child.
A key goal of science is to find ways to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method is the standard approach for almost all scientific research.
However, it's not just one thing. Experiments and tests are verification methods used to eliminate at least one possible hypothesis by asking questions, and observation is also a guideline in scientific research.
Natural scientists and philosophers are interested in ancient Greek and Roman texts, and especially the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's perspective is accepted in all branches of science, including psychology.
When Greek knowledge declined, the Western nations found themselves cut off from the philosophical and scientific foundations of Greece.
Many rhythms in biological mechanisms and behaviors that have been observed often depend on the presence of internal cycles and function through the circadian clocks of those cycles.
The rhythmic occurrences (which are not just responses to periodic external signals) have been recorded as being present in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is an oscillator that operates autonomously, continuing to function independently even when there is no external cue.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was a key clue indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments, either identifying the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or identifying the phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The impact of mutation varies depending on the type of mutation, the characteristics of the affected genetic element, and whether the affected cell is a germ cell.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other cells may cause cell death or lead to cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including trees and wildlife.
Examples of activities that can be done at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, garden tours, and studying the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, taking photos, and learning about Orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small rural town towards work, going in the opposite direction of those heading to work in the place they just left.
In this dynamic public transportation landscape, everyone contributes to or supports private vehicle travel in one way or another.
Modern science indicates that this economic system, which relies on the massive use of carbon, has caused an imbalance in the Earth's land and atmosphere – the environment that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone is a part of society and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you'll hardly ever hear complaints of this level about water quality or collapsed bridges.
Why does the transportation system cause such complaints? Why do errors occur daily? Are the engineers of the transportation system incompetent, or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement between two points of a single driver and vehicle, and the interaction between the two parties.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior is inherently unpredictable.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave somewhat similarly, so traffic flow is likely to be reasonably consistent, allowing for a rough mathematical estimation.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been defined between the three main attributes: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of roadside facilities.
Insects were the first type of animal to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helps them evade predators more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings along the length of their body.
Help them have more diverse small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and mayflies.
Many thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolved around the sun.
Some people agree with his idea, but many others believe the opposite – that the solar system, including the sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
It does seem logical because the world doesn't give the feeling of actually moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world, carrying more water than the world's second largest river by more than eight times.
Furthermore, the Amazon River is the widest river in the world, with some sections reaching up to six miles wide.
Twenty percent of the water flowing into the world's rivers into that ocean comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River, the main channel, is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long and collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though pyramid construction with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical excellence of the construction of the Great Pyramid of Giza are still considered superior.
The ancient Egyptians in the New Kingdom were all amazed to see the memorial of their ancestors, which was over a thousand years old.
Vatican City has a population of around 800 people, making it the smallest and least populous independent state in the world.
The Vatican City uses Italian for enacting laws and official communication.
Most people who work in the state use Italian as their everyday language, while Latin is frequently used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they could be found naturally in their original forms and were also relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, proposed a theory that everything is composed of at least one of four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the states of matter (in the same order), which are solids, liquids, gases, and plasma, but he also theorized that they would transform into new substances to form the things we see.
Generally, an alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Various elements such as calcium and potassium are considered metals, and of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
In addition, you may have an alloy containing non-metallic elements such as carbon, present in small amounts.
Everything in the universe arises from matter. All matter arises from incredibly tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so small that trillions upon trillions of them could fit at the very end of this sentence.
Therefore, pencils have been well-received by many people upon their release to the market.
Sadly, as new writing methods emerge one after another, the pencil is gradually losing its importance and usage.
People today can write messages on computer screens without needing to get near a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes along.
Fission bombs work on the principle that the fusion of nuclei with a large number of protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's similar to pushing a mortar up a mountain. Separating the nucleus again will release some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei. This means they are prone to breaking apart from even slight movements or may not move at all.
The surface of the moon consists of rock and dust. The outermost layer of the moon is called the crust.
The inner shell is approximately 70 km thick, while the outer shell is approximately 100 km thick.
The lunar crust is thinner in the mare (seas) and thicker in the highlands.
The closer side may have more lava because it has a thinner crust, allowing the lava to erupt onto the surface more easily.
The theoretical content focuses on exploring what motivates people to choose or be interested in something.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that arise as they grow into adulthood.
These theories consider what motivates people to pursue what they have done and what aspects of their environment will lead them to act or not act on certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, there might be two behaviors that occur when a manager brings in a former colleague. On one hand, they try to "fit in" (or with them).
This type of manager has difficulty with unpopular decision-making, disciplinary action, performance appraisals, assigning accountability, and holding individuals responsible.
Conversely, one person transforms into someone unrecognizable who feels they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
No matter what, the leader must take responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to discord between the leader and the rest of the team.
The virtual team has a standard of excellence similar to traditional teams, but there's a subtle difference.
Virtual team members often serve as a point of contact for nearby physical groups.
They often have team members who are self-starters rather than following traditional blueprints, as their teams may be in different time zones, which local management may not understand.
The existence of a true "phantom team" (Larson & Lafasto, 1989, p. 109) is still a distinctive component of virtual teams.
"The Invisible Team" is an executive team where all members must report. The Invisible Team will set standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the lengthy process of establishing a learning organization? One of the goals in implementing the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently across different departments throughout the organization, creativity and ingenuity can emerge.
Therefore, the organization's process of collaborating to overcome obstacles can lead to new, innovative processes that meet customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must cultivate a culture of creativity alongside knowledge sharing and internal learning.
Angel (2006) describes the Continuum approach as a way to successfully help organizations achieve higher levels of performance.
Neuroscience data provides physical evidence for theoretical research on cognitive processes. This information therefore helps to narrow the scope of research and make it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior will help support scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, including injuries, lesions, and tumors, affect behavior and lead to changes in certain aspects of mental functioning.
The increasing availability of new technologies allows us to visualize and examine the structure and functioning of the brain in previously unseen ways.
This allows us to have a wealth of data and content for creating scenario models, which helps us understand processes within the mind.
Although AI systems clearly hold implications for science fiction novels, they are also a very important branch of computer science in managing the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of machinery.
Research on AI involves enabling machines to automatically perform tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning, and scheduling. The ability to respond to customer feedback and questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and faces.
These things have become distinct fields of study, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems.
Currently, AI systems are often used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military applications, just as they are in software applications for home computers and various video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class. Often, teachers take their students to various places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution to problems through virtual reality field trips. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting with others in the classroom.
Sharing experiences from virtual field trips is a very good way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future studies.
For example, students from Bennett School in North Carolina designed their travel website to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are still available online for use as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with not-so-accurate grammar and spelling, having an audience usually helps correct those errors.
Since students are often the most important group of readers, the blogger began to work hard to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogging also "helps students understand the world around them better." The desire to respond to readers' interests inspires students to be intelligent and interesting people (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that supports collaboration and encourages students to learn more outside of regular class time.
Appropriate use of blogs "can promote students' ability to analyze and critique more, enabling students to position themselves within the context of others' writing through active engagement with online content, as well as summarizing their own perspectives on given issues (Orreவாக, 2002)."
Ottawa is the bilingual capital of Canada, charmingly lined with art galleries and museums showcasing Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, while the north boasts the pristine natural beauty of Muscogee and other places.
These and other things make Ontario stand out, becoming the heart of Canada in the eyes of outsiders.
A large area located far to the north has a relatively sparse population, and some areas are abandoned with almost no people living there.
The surprising comparison is that African Americans living in the United States outnumber citizens of Canada.
The East African islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa.
With Madagascar being the largest island and significantly bigger than others, it's often considered a continent when talking about plant and animal species.
Small islands are mostly independent nations or have ties to France and are renowned for their luxurious beachfront resorts.
Furthermore, Arabs spread Islam to various lands and it became very popular in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism began in the 15th century when Vasco da Gama, a Portuguese explorer, discovered sea routes from Europe to India via the Cape.
The northern area borders the Sahel, while the southern and western areas border the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: I would like to advise all female tourists to say that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
Wearing a ring would also be beneficial (but not one that looks overly expensive).
Women should be aware that cultural differences may lead others to perceive actions as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, have their arms grabbed, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (cultural differences are no excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century, and was used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenid dynasties, known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed this place and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake of 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt this city, naming it Daru l-Badya, and the Spanish merchants who established a trading post there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop for goods in Morocco.
Around the old Medina of Fez, you can easily find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and many other trinkets. However, all of this is mainly for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, located in the far east, close to Rwanda.
In 2002 (B.E. 2545), the town of Komagata was destroyed by lava from Mount Irago, burying almost all the roads in the town, especially in the downtown area.
Although Komma is relatively safe, if you plan to travel outside the Komma area, it's advisable to research the situation beforehand to understand the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
This city remains a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, as well as for gorilla trekking, which is the most affordable in Africa.
You can travel around Kinshasa by Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi), with a regular (local) fare being approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Combined with its inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" has become a metaphor for a distant and exotic land.
Currently, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its reputation has made it a tourist destination and it has an airport.
In 1990, this site was added to the List of World Heritage in Danger due to the threat of desert sand.
This is one of the key stopping points during Henry Louis Gates' special Wonders of the World Africa series on PBS.
This city is completely different from other cities in the country because it has a more Arab atmosphere than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
This national park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers, divided into 14 distinct ecological zones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of the main tourist destinations in South Africa and is considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Conservation fees and entrance fees to the park are collected daily, similar to other national parks in South Africa.
Furthermore, purchasing a Wild Card might be more worthwhile as it allows access to all national parks in South Africa, where you can choose to visit only some or all, depending on your preferences.
Hong Kong has made the territory famous and is also a destination that many tourists consider a priority.
The buildings lining up to create the Hong Kong skyline are likened to a glowing bar graph, made easily visible by the water in Victoria Harbour.
If you want to see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the waterfront on the Kowloon side directly across.
The development and progress of most cities on Hong Kong Island are concentrated in the densely populated coastal areas in the north that were reclaimed.
This is the place that the English colonists seized as their own. Therefore, if you are looking for evidence that indicates the history of this colony, then this is a good starting point.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching approximately 80 km (50 miles) along the coast of Bangladesh and India, located away from the shoreline.
UNESCO has declared Sundarbans a World Heritage Site. A portion of the forest located within India's borders is known as Sundarbans National Park.
The forest isn't just mangrove forest; there are also remnants of a large forest that once covered the plains of the Ganges River.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 sq km, of which approximately one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Sukhothai National Park has been a protected wildlife area since 1966, and it is estimated that there are currently around 400 Bengal tigers and approximately 30,000 deer in the park.
The interprovincial bus departs from the station throughout the day. Mostly, buses heading east and to Jakar/Bumthang depart between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
It is recommended to buy your ticket in advance by a few days because inter-district buses are often full.
In most areas, there are small Japanese coaster buses that are comfortable and stable, providing service.
Taxis going in the same direction can be a convenient and fast way to travel to nearby destinations. For example, going to Paro (150 minutes) and going to Punakha (200 minutes).
The Oiapoque River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge spanning the Oiapoque River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two tower columns soar to a height of 83 meters, with a length of 378 meters, and consist of 2 lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The bridge is 15 meters high above the ground. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened for use until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, which is expected to coincide with the completion of Brazilian customs facilities.
Guaraní are the most significant indigenous group residing in what is now eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunter-gatherers who practice agriculture.
The Chaco region was once inhabited by other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, once known as the "Giant Province of the Indies," emerged from the clash between Spanish conquistadors and indigenous groups.
The Spanish people were the instigators of a colonial era that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has retained many characteristics and identities of its indigenous people.
Argentina is renowned for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The largest tournament of the year is held in December at the polo field in Las Canitas.
You can watch smaller tournaments and competitions here at other times of the year.
For news and information regarding the polo tournament and ticket purchasing locations, please check with the Asociacion Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official currency used in the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent to one British Pound (GBP).
You can exchange money only at the bank located in Stanley, across from theific West store.
Generally, British pounds are widely accepted throughout the islands, including Stanley cheque cards, and US dollars are also often accepted.
It's possible that the outer islands may not accept credit cards, even though they accept British and US currency. Please check with the owner in advance to determine acceptable payment methods.
It's almost impossible to exchange currency in the Falkland Islands outside of the main island, so exchange money before leaving the island.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, when the Northern Hemisphere is in winter, it is summer there, and when the Northern Hemisphere is in summer, it is winter there.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region. In the summer months, temperatures above 30°C are considered normal.
Winter can be unexpectedly cold. That is to say, even though the temperature itself doesn't drop below freezing, you'll feel colder than the thermometer indicates due to the wind and humidity.
There isn't a distinct rainy season and a dry season, especially because the amount of rainfall is relatively consistent throughout the year.
Even though many animals in the park are accustomed to seeing humans, wild animals are still wild animals and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park officials have announced that you should maintain a distance of at least 100 yards or meters from bears and wolves, and 25 yards or meters from all other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may appear, bulls, bison, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Each year, dozens of visitors get injured for not maintaining a proper distance. These animals are large, ferocious, and potentially dangerous, so it's necessary to keep a distance to give them space.
Furthermore, please be aware that various scents will attract bears and other wildlife. Therefore, avoid carrying or cooking food with strong odors, and always keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa, located on the island of Upolu, and has a population of just nearly 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port is the location where a scandalous naval conflict occurred in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and England refused to leave the port.
Every ship sank, with only one British patrol boat surviving. Nearly 200 lives were lost – Americans and Germans.
During the struggle for independence initiated by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city led to the killing of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III, the supreme leader.
There are many beaches due to Auckland having two harbors on opposite sides. The most popular beaches are located in three areas.
North Shore Beach (in North Harbor district) is located on the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devenport in the south.
These beaches are mostly sandy and safe for swimming, with plenty of shade from the coconut palm trees.
Tamarindo Beach Drive is located in Viaduct Harbour in the upscale suburban areas of Mission Bay and St. Helier in central Auckland.
Sometimes these beaches can be crowded family beaches with shops lined up along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The leading local beer brand is 'Number One', which isn't a complex beer, but it has a pleasant taste and a refreshing feeling. Another local beer brand is called "Manta" (1).
There are many French wines you shouldn't miss, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might be more suitable for travel.
The local tap water is safe to drink, but if you're concerned, bottled water is readily available.
For Australians, a 'flat white' is considered strange, while a short black is 'espresso'. A cappuccino must have a generous mound of cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is considered to be Belgian standard. The fruit juice is expensive but tastes very good.
Throughout the year, there are many diving trips to the coral reefs, and injuries from these causes are rarely encountered on the reefs.
However, please seek guidance from staff, follow all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near the beaches and river mouths in the north of the city from October to April. They can occasionally be found outside of these months.
There are sharks in reality, but they rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and often swim away to other places.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily reside in the ocean. Their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking gives tourists peace of mind knowing they'll have a place to stay upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often already have agreements with hotels, but you can still book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through the travel agency.
Typically, travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast and transportation to/from the airport, or even packages that include flights and hotels.
They can also hold the booking for you if you need time to consider the offer or arrange other documents for your trip (for example, a visa).
If you need to make any changes or request anything, please do so through the travel agent. Do not contact the hotel directly.
At some music festivals, attendees camp on site because many consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to have an intimate experience, you'll need to arrive early to find a campsite close to the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage may end, some parts of the festival will continue playing music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with young children.
It is advisable to check the location of the cabin in case of traveling across the North Baltic Sea during winter, as navigating through ice can create a rather frightening noise for those most likely to be affected.
A St. Petersburg river cruise also includes time spent in the city. Passengers are visa-exempt (please check the conditions).
Generally, casinos try very hard to ensure all guests spend as much money and time as possible, often by having no windows or clocks and making it difficult to find exits.
They often provide food, drinks, and entertainment to ensure guests are in good spirits and stay at the venue.
Some venues serve alcoholic beverages, but intoxication impairs judgment, and good gamblers understand the importance of maintaining clear-headedness.
Anyone who needs to drive in mountainous areas or across mountains should prepare for snow, ice, or temperatures as low as freezing.
On icy roads with heavy snow, the friction will be low, making it impossible to drive as you would on a dry asphalt road.
During a blizzard, snow can fall to a depth sufficient to make it impossible to go anywhere in a very short time.
Visibility may be limited by falling snow or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the car windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy weather is normal in many countries, and traffic is usually smooth year-round.
Safari could be the greatest tourist attraction and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term "safari" refers to a land-based journey to admire the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna grasslands.

Stirrups are designed to support the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
This makes the driver more stable, but there may be safety concerns because the driver's feet could get stuck inside.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their feet remain in the stirrups, they may be dragged along by the horse if it bolts. Several safety measures can be implemented to reduce this risk.
First, most drivers wear heeled boots with flat and narrow soles.
Next, in some saddles, particularly English saddles, there is a safety strap that helps prevent the leather girth from coming loose if the rider falling off the horse pulls on it.

Europe is a relatively small continent, yet it has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries means applying for visas several times and going through passport checks repeatedly.
However, the Schengen Area will function somewhat like a single country in this regard.
As long as you are within this area, you will generally be able to cross the border without going through passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for separate visas for each member country within the Schengen area, which saves both time and money and reduces the amount of paperwork required.
There is no universal definition to indicate which manufactured item qualifies as an antique. Some tax authorities define goods older than 100 years as antiques.

Transgender individuals should not be required to undergo screening in a way that compromises their privacy and dignity prior to surgery.
Backwash is the water current from waves crashing onto the shore that flows back, which often occurs in coral reef areas or similar locations.
Underwater topography causes backflow currents to be more intense at greater depths, and fast-flowing currents into deeper water may form there.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion while trying to swim against the current. This is often unsuccessful.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.

Your local phone provider should be able to provide information about connecting to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a one-year break is to travel and study.
This is something that high school graduates particularly like, as it allows them to take a year off before entering university without affecting their studies.

Generally, there are tuition fees for registration in these study programs.
Finland is a fantastic destination for kayaking. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also boasts thousands of islands, both within the lakes and along the coastline.
You don't need to use a yacht in the islands and lakes.
Even though the largest islands along the coast and in the lakes are wide enough for yachts to sail through, smaller boats or even kayaks give you a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, with approximately one boat for every seven or eight Finns.
Which is similar to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but also quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the number is 1 to 40).
Most of the prominent Baltic cruise ships are moored for extended periods in Saint Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit the historical city for a full day, two to three days, and return to sleep on the boat at night.
If you arrive by sea solely for tourism purposes, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise ships feature images of Berlin, Germany in their brochures, as you can see from the map above. Berlin is not near the sea at all, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.

The common way to travel in first class or business class is to spend a lot of money to get these privileges (or even better, if your company pays for it).
However, these services don't come cheap. Based on a rough calculation using general principles, you can expect to pay up to four times the regular economy fare for business class, and eleven times for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in trying to find discounts for business class or first-class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines know well that there is a segment of travelers willing to pay a premium for exclusive travel privileges to a destination quickly and comfortably. Therefore, they charge accordingly for the services provided.
