That doesn't just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that's been around for a while, but also provides details that fossils normally can't offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were a chestnut brown on top with a bright or carotenoid-colored underside.
The fund also reflects the evolution of feathers in birds.
While dinosaurs didn't have a well-developed shaft (called a spindle), researchers have concluded that other feather characteristics – barbs and vanes – likely evolved earlier compared to the spindle.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathers are from adult feathers and not from the down of a chick.
The researchers have suggested that although this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the feathers are not derived from the plumes of a pygmy.

The work was largely theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team observed would be caused by forces across time between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon exerts a force of attraction on the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the Sagittarius Galaxy.
Scientists were able to conclude that dark matter affects other dark matter in the same way that normal matter is affected.
This theory posits that most dark matter exists in a sort of halo around a galaxy and is composed of many small particles.

Her other race, the Giant Slalom, ended in tenth place in the women's Giant Slalom with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place Gyöngyi Dani from Hungary.
Four drivers in the women's group were unable to complete their run, and 45 of the 117 women drivers in the Riesel slalom were unable to qualify.
The Police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
The Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said, "We have arrested five people who raped the Swiss woman, and we have recovered their mobile phone and laptop."
The Baba Kanjar, the Bhutha Kanjar, the Rampro Kanjar, the Gaza Kanjar, and the Vishnu Kanjar were all exhausted.
Police President Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with concealed faces.
Although there were three people in the house when the car was connected, none of them were injured.
The driver sustained serious head injuries, however.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while the rescue service freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
He was first delivered to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was subsequently transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was charged in the Sheriff Court Edinburgh with the murder of her boyfriend.
She is being held in pre-trial detention until she is charged and brought before court, but all witness statements could be unreliable because her photo was widely published.
That is common in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish justice system works differently, and courts have viewed the publication of photos as potentially harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes, "that journalists seem to be walking a tightrope when they publish photos of suspects."
The Crown Office, which is responsible for prosecution, has informed journalists that no further comments will be made until the investigation is complete.
The document refers to the disputed border region that Palestine claims based on the borders of 1967, according to the leaked file.
Further reportedly addressed topics include the future status of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the Jordan issue.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in the valley for ten years upon signing an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority is only willing to allow this presence for five years.
The shooters in the supplementary pest control study should be supervised by rangers, as the study was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are recruited within the framework of the Sporting Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Deputy Director for Park Protection and Heritage of the NPWS (National Parks and Wildlife Service), the four selected rangers received comprehensive training on safety and techniques for the initial shooting phase.
De Martelly christened a new, adorable walrus (CEP) with nine members yesterday.
It's Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a Presidential Commission recommended the resignation of the former CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The Commission was given Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime in October.
The occasionally violent protests were triggered by the failed elections, some of which have been overdue since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of iPod overheating were reported, resulting in a total of six fires and four people with minor burns.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) has stated that it is aware of 27 accidents involving the devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple shared 34 more overheating incidents with them, which the company described as "not concerning."
The Ministry has reacted to Apple's revelations by calling them "deeply regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 local time (Friday 9:19 GMT).
The Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Agency said that no damage has been reported across the entire island.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six have now been confirmed dead.
Six hostages, including children and elderly people, were released early, much to the delight of the Filipino photographers.
The photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was not shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and started a career in medicine.
He trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
During his work in the hospital, Liggins began to examine premature babies during his free time.
Her research showed that when a hormone is released, it would accelerate fetal lung maturation.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes on Wednesday.
Other wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna has passed away on the night of the two moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as crazy as I am... maybe even a little more... I loved her and miss her... hopefully she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 respondents in front of the Bundeswal in 2010, those who are against Australia as a republic have increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The interim prime minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believes Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of the survey participants share this view and would like Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent think that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness was questioned due to his complaints.
He was unable to get medication to overcome his pain because they are prohibited during the game.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, has discovered the largest known prime number to date on January 25th.
Some people verified the discovery with the help of different hardware by the beginning of February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have carried organic substances, which can form proteins and support life, as a source for water delivery to Earth.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo took office as governor earlier this year at age 53 and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He referred to the rumors as "polite chatter and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run in the presidential elections in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims would enable aircraft to fly shorter routes and save millions of tons of fuel and reduce CO₂ emissions.
It utilizes satellite-based technology, in contrast to the older ground-radar-based technology, to enable air traffic controllers to locate aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport will be used, and overground trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking spaces and Park-and-Ride facilities are not available on the ground.
The fear of lacking transportation has increased the possibility that the game will have to be held behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published on Thursday in Science reported on the emergence of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galápagos Islands.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have reported that the new species evolved in just two generations, although the process likely took much longer due to the interbreeding between the endemic Darwin's finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the introduced cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be processed in all possible forms. It can be rolled into tiny shapes.
It can be made into a thin thread that can be twisted and stretched. It can be processed with lobster and rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and plated onto other metals. It can be so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate handmade pictures and books, called "picture script".
That refers to the pH value of a chemical. You can make an indicator using juice from red cabbage.
The litmus paper changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical is.
The pH level is determined by the number of hydrogen (H in pH value) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost their electrons (as hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then press them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, causing them to swell and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro had a flush toilet in almost every house, connected to an elaborate drainage system.
In the buildings of the human cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, relics of wastewater systems were found.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. Among the Romans, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses, where men and women met in mixed company.
When you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost immediately back down.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of the light.
A huge rocket over 30 meters high is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The bicycle has changed the world in an indescribable way. The greatest advantage we owe to the bicycle is much faster and easier transport options.
It has brought us the train, the car, and many other means of transport.
Among them are medium-sized foxes that eat medium-sized prey ranging from rabbits to deer and wild boar.
Finally, there are many small cats (including free-roaming house cats) that eat a much larger number of small prey than insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to her success is the niche concept, a special task that every cat has which prevents her from competing with others.
Siamese cats are the most sociable cats, living in large groups, also called packs.
A herd consists of one to four adult males, together with up to thirty females and young.
Women are usually a close-knit family because they are a large family of sisters and daughters.
Weasels behave similarly to those of wolves or dogs – animals that, to the lover (but not other large cats), are surprisingly similar in behavior – and they are also quite deadly for their prey.
As a well-trained athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not very well), swim, jump far, and pull with five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's glasses aren't like the perfect glasses of a lover, but rather like a sentence mangled, stammering words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. They catch rodents, snakes, reptiles, and birds when they can. Almost all the animals that an ocelot eats are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that otters are animals that follow and find prey by sniffing where they have been on the ground.
They can see and move quite well in the dark with night vision. Ozelots hunt by camouflaging themselves and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which they originated (such as if they move over a mountain or a river, or if they colonize a new island and cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that is different from the one in which they were previously.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so the new population needs new skills or adjustments to be a stronger competitor than they were before.
The original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adjusts to their new surroundings, they begin to look less like the other population.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, these two populations will look so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which only means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable form and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe, and they take in carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants produce their food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses and produce our clothes from plants. The largest part of the food we eat are plants. Without plants, animals could not survive.
The Mosasaurus was the largest predator of its time, so it had no fear except for other Mosasaurs.
Its long fangs were lined with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, along with an additional row of teeth on the gums, which meant there was no escape for anything that crossed its path.
We are not sure, but it could have had a patchy coat. Its diet included shells, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it could have even been a cannibal.
It also absorbed everything that came into the water; even a giant dinosaur like a T-Rex couldn't hold a candle to it.
Although most of their food was familiar to us, the marmots had some strange or unusual meals on occasion, including wild boar, grouse, squirrels, and a type of rodent called sleep mouse.
Another difference lies in the fact that while the poor and women were surviving on meager rations, the wealthy men gladly held banquets where they lounged and ate on the side.
Polders in the Old Realm could not contain foodstuffs that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
They didn't have, for example, any corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and no old gardener ever poured gravy on the dumplings.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of their gods, which was considered their dwelling place.
People brought offerings to the gods, and priests tried to fulfill the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
The Jewish temple had an open temple court and then an inner sanctuary, which only the priests were allowed to enter.
Occasionally, specially pyramid-shaped structures – called ziggurats – were built to be part of the temples.
The top of the tower had a special shrine for God.
In the warm climate of the Near East, houses were not as important.
The majority of the Hebrew family's life took place outdoors.
The women were picking herbs in the garden; the shops were only open during the day. Stone was used for the construction of houses.
There were no large forests in Canaan, therefore wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the Norse sagas, Erik the Red was banished from Iceland for murder and, as he continued further west, he discovered Greenland and named it so.
However, independent of their discovery, Inuit tribes had already been living there at that time.
Although every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences in terms of people, languages, customs, and the history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
When you have seen the film 'The Legacy of the Templars', you might think that a treasure map was written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
That's absolutely not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence dated 4th July 1776" were written. The text is located at the bottom of the reversed document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the largest parchment document (it measured 75.57 cm x 62.23 cm) was rolled up early in its life for storage.
So, it's likely that the note was simply added as a label.
The D-Day landing and the subsequent battles liberated Northern France, but the South was still occupied.
It was ruled by the "Vichy" French. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon."
And in less than two weeks, the Americans and the Free French forces had liberated Southern France and turned their attention to Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared by a significantly large group of people who live and work together in a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," meaning citizenly, related to the Latin "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and also somehow determines the greatness of society.
City-states are precursors to nations. A civilization culture implies the continuation of knowledge over several generations, a sustained cultural footprint, and an orderly dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving important historical evidence and are not recognized as proper civilizations.
During the Revolutionary Wars, thirteen states formed a weak central government under the Constitution of the Confederation for the first time – with the Congress being its sole component.
The Congress had no power to levy taxes, and since there was no national executive or judiciary, it relied on state agencies, which were often uncooperative, to implement all its actions.
He also has no authority to nullify tax laws and excise duties between states.
The clauses require unanimous consent from all states before they can be amended, and the states have shrugged off the central government, so that their representatives were often dismissive.
The Italian national football team, along with the German team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the 2006 FIFA World Cup champion.
Popular sports are football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and F1 motorsport.
Winter sports are very popular in the northern regions, with Italians competing against international players and at Olympic events.
Japan encompasses almost 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making Japan the seventh-largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan comprises, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the southwest of Taiwan, initiating a transformation of the indigenous core production and employing Chinese laborers to work on their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, troops of the Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which sovereignty over Taiwan was ceded to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures, namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the room with the three windows.
Most of the buildings on the perimeter of the complex were rebuilt to offer tourists a better idea of what they used to look like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
The most widely used photo format for still images worldwide is, for example, 35mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
Nowadays, it is still produced, but primarily its aspect ratios are surpassed by the formats of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually what one can a bit distort, 36mm wide and 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (divided by twelve, to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore indicated as 3:2.
Common formats (e.g., the APS format family) correspond to or approximate this aspect ratio.
The frequently used and sometimes mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamics while at the same time maintaining a sense of order within an image.
It is apparent that the most effective place for the main motif is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was challenged.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has held European states together despite differences in language and custom.
Her all-pervading power affected everyone, from the king to the ordinary citizen.
One of the most important Christian teachings is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are specifically there for that reason.
The central authority of the Church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and wealth contributed greatly to the doubts about whether this principle was fulfilled.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Great Britain imposed a naval blockade on Germany.
The strategy has proven effective by cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, even though this blockade violates generally accepted international law, which has been codified through numerous international agreements over the last two centuries.
Great Britain has established international waters to prevent ships from traversing entire sections of the ocean, which has even endangered neutral vessels.
Well, only a limited reaction to this tactic was observed, Germany had anticipated a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitude of most citizens and nations was pacifism and isolation.
Having witnessed the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the nations wanted to avoid a repetition of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States of America to seek employment with the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived at Thomas Edison's in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager and former employer).
Ancient China had a unique way of marking different eras: each phase of China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Between every dynasty, there was also an uncertain time with fragmented provinces. The most well-known of these eras was the Epoch of the "Three Kingdoms", which lasted for 60 years and lay between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, a fierce war broke out among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient China. Thousands of people died in the fight for the highest seat in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the metric system, the evolution from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
During the revolution, there were job opportunities for all male applicants, which enabled the most ambitious and successful to seize them.
The same applies to the military, because instead of army ranks based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired other oppressed workers and in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Mohammed was strongly interested in things beyond this earthly life. He repeatedly visited a hermitage, known as "Hira" on Mount Noor (Light), for contemplation.
The very core itself, which has endured for centuries, provides a quite clear picture of Mohammed's ascending inclinations.
The Hell lies on a mountain north of Mecca and is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if you know it exists. Once you're in Hell, you're completely isolated.
You can only see the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding people. When one is in hell, one can see or hear very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the dead pharaoh.
On the Giseh Plateau, or "Giseh Necropolis," in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings, there are a few pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), a few small tombs, a few temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Cheops, and a number of smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were erected to honor his wives and family members.
The "Boumark up" looks like a V, and the "Boumark down" looks like a parenthesis or a square with the bottom missing.
Up means you should start at the top and push the branch down, and down means you should start at the fresh (where your hand holds the branch) and pull the branch.
A spread typically generates a softer tone, while a smear is stronger and more assertive.
Don't hesitate to draw your own markings with a pencil, but don't forget that the printed score markings are there for musical reasons, so they should normally be adhered to.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Élisabeth, were forced to return to Paris by a mob of market women from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a mob of people who shouted threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd of people forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, a participant in the mob lifted the head of a royal guard from Versailles before the terrified Queen, who had been driven to death.
The war expenses of US imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay tribute to the Austrian colonial regimes, as a large portion of the expenses and interest on the bonds flowed in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Naturally, the super profits resulting from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people represent the fundamental achievements of US imperialism.
For the Knights Templar to be understood, one must understand the context that led to their creation.
The period in which the events took place is generally referred to as the High Middle Ages, the era of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages followed the Early Middle Ages, which generally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice; from technology-push or a technological necessity to a strong sense that human destiny is driven by an underlying logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common ideas: that the development of technology follows a path largely independent of cultural or political influence, and that technology has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
It can, for example, be seen that the car was necessarily used for the development of roads.
However, a nationwide road network is not economically viable for a large number of cars, so new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs for vehicle owners.
Motorization also leads to a higher frequency of accidents on the roads, which leads to the invention of new techniques in healthcare for the repair of damaged bodies.
Romance had a significant element of cultural determinism in writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In connection with romanticism, geography has shaped individuals and, over time, customs and cultures have arisen that are connected to this geography and were such because they stood in harmony with the place of society, better than arbitrary imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the main city of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the main city of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
The feudal status was primarily established during the 12th century due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with goods such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than what Byzantine markets offered.
It was at this point that the title of Imperial capital of Constantinople was transferred to Paris.
The Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
In the beginning, Byzantine culture had a very strong influence on the Codex.
The styles in the West could fall 25 to 30 years behind due to the limited communication channels in Luxembourg.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using rivets to fasten the armor.
Subsistence farming is agriculture carried out to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, sometimes organic system that combines seeds from the local ecosystem with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to optimize yields.
Historically, most farmers were active in subsistence farming, and that is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who feel neglected by societal standards, and they enable them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be irrevocably defined by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The characteristics that define a subculture as distinct can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often signal their membership through an unmistakable and symbolic use of style that encompasses fashion, language, and slang.
One of the most common methods for illustrating the meaning of socialization involves looking at a few unfortunate cases of children who were not socialized during their upbringing due to neglect, bad luck, or intentional abuse by adults.
These children are called "willow" children. Some willow children are rescued by people (usually their own parents); and in some cases, this task of the child was to relieve the parents of the burden of severe emotional or physical distress.
Young people who run away may have experienced severe child abuse or trauma before they were given up or ran away.
Others are to be taken from animals; some have lived alone in the wilderness.
When a child of non-human animals is raised, it exhibits behavioral patterns (within physical limits) that are almost completely similar to those of the respective bird species, such as fear of or indifference towards humans.
Although project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding goes an extra step further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather support for people who are experiencing a new learning experience, such as using a new computer program or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be both virtual and real; in other words, a schoolmaster is a form of scaffolding, but that also applies to the small office cubicle and Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is embedded in the software and should prompt, challenge, and explain procedures that might be too difficult for students to manage on their own.
Children are taken into foster care and care facilities that range from neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
No child should ever have to grow up in an environment that is not supportive, social, and educational, but unfortunately, that's just the way it is now.
We see the childcare system as a safety zone for these children.
The healthcare system should offer a safe home, caring staff with a very warm manner, stable training, and reliable healthcare.
Nursing care should provide all the necessities that were lacking in the home from which the patient was discharged.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The inherent characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions and in relation to the increase in usage and gratification.
For example, 'learning' and 'socialization' are considered important motivations for internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and "non-binding relationships" were identified by Eighmey and McCord (1998) as new motivational aspects, as they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to relevant discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions – facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds.
Above all, it is claimed that one can recognize whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his paper "The President's Speech" that people who do not understand language due to brain damage are still able to accurately judge sincerity.
He even suggests that such abilities in interpreting human behavior in animals, like domestic dogs, are shared.
Research of the 20th century has shown that there are two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
A mutation introduces a new advantageous variation while selection removes it from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination drive variation between the two gene pools with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to meet its amino acid needs with the available plant resources.
Furthermore, it has grave consequences if you don't do that: wasting disease, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based resources would have been proteins and leaves in legumes, but these are difficult for primates like us to digest if they are not cooked.
In contrast, certain animal-based foods (insects, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a wealth of proteins, containing all the necessary amino acids.
I should not be surprised at all if our own methods had solved their "protein problem" in almost the same way that chimpanzees do it today in the savanna.
Sleep interruption is the process of targeted arousal during normal sleep time and falling back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes later).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to rouse you to consciousness, but not fully wake you up.
When you set your clock back, it can be placed on the other side of the room so that you are forced to get up to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based options include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a known diuretic) before going to sleep, which forces one to get up to urinate.
The extent of inner peace a person possesses is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The less tension, the more positive the existing life force. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that stands in the way of this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded through the Mahayana tradition of love and through many techniques of Indian Yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of all-encompassing love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The central point of Tibetan meditation is Guruyoga. By visualizing various deities, the energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and enlightenment consciousness is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, the clashes of systems, processes, and culture led to the overthrow of the countries.
Two years after the war, the former Allies developed into enemies, which led to the Cold War.
It should last the next 40 years and be deployed from substitute positions on battlefields in Africa to Asia, and Afghanistan, Cuba, and other remote locations.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were almost ruined overnight when 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Soviet Union marched in and created a white Russian and Ukrainian front, after having invaded the eastern regions of Poland in violation of the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for freight transport is the most efficient option available for transporting many people and goods across oceans.
The traditional task of the navy is to ensure that its country retains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously disrupting the ability of its enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most remarkable examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans attempted to get men and materials across the Atlantic to support Great Britain.
Simultaneously, the German Navy attempted, mainly with submarines, to stop this traffic.
Had the Allies failed, Germany would likely have been in a position to conquer Great Britain and the rest of Europe.
Geese were apparently first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
All cultures and peoples have historically valued easy access to milk, hair, meat, and leather.
Geese were generally kept in enclosures, on pastures or other grazing areas, often tended by farmhands, who were frequently children and young people, similar to the well-known shepherds. This method of herding is still used today.
Dune houses were already built in England in the 16th century.
Although the roads were mainly made of parallel wooden logs, they allowed horses to pull wagons faster and with heavier loads than on the slightly rougher roads of the time.
Stockings were introduced quite early on to keep the rails in place. However, it gradually became apparent that the rails would be more efficient with an insulating strip on top.
That was common practice, but the iron caused more wear and tear on the wooden runners of the wagons.
Finally, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. The first complete iron railways were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking; humans began walking upright with the emergence of Homo Erectus (upright man) approximately 2 million years ago.
Her ancestors, the Australopithecus, did not walk upright in the way we are used to.
Bipedal specializations are found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2–3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can join an environmental movement, and we can even become activists to mitigate future suffering to some extent.
That is like a symptomatic treatment in many cases. But if we don't just want a temporary solution, we should find the root of the problems and eliminate them.
It is obvious enough that the scientific and technological advancements of humanity have strongly changed the world, and the problems are becoming greater due to overpopulation and the excessive lifestyle of humanity.
Although it was approved by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten draft signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a few more glances down to the printing house of John Dunlap.
Copies were made between 150 and 200, which are known today as "Dunlap Broadsides".
The first public reading of the document was by John Nixon at the Hall of Independence on July 8th.
It was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who released his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy reached London on August 10th.
The 25-Dunlap broadsides, of which we know that they still exist, are the oldest copies of the document. The handwritten original copy has not survived.
Nowadays, many paleontologists are convinced that a group of dinosaurs survived and still lives today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see it as a dinosaur because it had feathers and could fly.
But there are many things in tulle that still look like a dinosaur.
It has feet with scales and claws, lays eggs and stands on its hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e. 0 or 1, and these numbers are considered binary digits – or bits (to be used in computer language).
An internal poisoning may not be immediately recognizable. Symptoms like vomiting are so common that a direct diagnosis cannot be made.
The best indication of a possible poisoning can be the presence of an open container of medication or toxic household chemicals.
On the label you will find specific first aid instructions for the relevant poison.
The term "Kiewerlek" is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This concept stems from the old familiarity with bed bugs, which are insects highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Both bed bugs and carpet beetles are nocturnal creatures that have adapted to life in the nest or dwelling of their host.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have found that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple may decide that it is not in their best interest – or that of their child – to have a baby.
These couples can decide to make an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their parental rights, allowing another couple to become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to clarify how the world functions through the scientific method. This method forms the basis of most scientific research.
But it doesn't do that alone. Experimenting – and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses – asking questions and making observations are also part of conducting scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers concentrate on classical texts and especially on the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's views were accepted in all fields of science, including psychology.
As knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West lost its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Rhythm observed in physiology and behavior are often crucially dependent on the existence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic cues, have been documented for most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological oscillators are autonomous oscillators that can continue to run for a long time even in the absence of external signals.
The Hershey-Chase experiment was one of the leading proposals that DNA was the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to implant their own DNA into a bacterium.
She conducted two experiments, either labeling the phage's DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage's protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other cells can lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature tourism attracts people who want to visit natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visits to parks, as well as the study of information about the ecosystem.
An example is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
All mothers leave people in small towns by car to go to their workplaces and drive past those whose destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic transport shuttle, everyone is somehow connected to a transport system based on and supported by private cars.
Science now indicates that this massive carbon cycle has disrupted the stable states of the biosphere, which have supported the evolution of humanity over the last 2 million years.
Almost everyone is part of society and uses transport systems. Almost everyone can complain about transport systems.
In industrialized countries, you often hear complaints about water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why do transport systems generate so many complaints, and what are they trying to do every day? Are transport planners simply incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental going on?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, analyzing traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers usually remain within a more or less consistent area; therefore, traffic flows have a reasonable consistency and can be mathematically represented.
To better ensure traffic flow, relationships are established between the three main properties: (1) Flow, (2) Density, and (3) Speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of roads.
Insects were the first animals to conquer the air. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage that they can retract their wings along their body.
It offers them a larger variety of small places where they can hide from predators.
Currently, water striders and mayflies, as solitary insects, cannot fold their wings back.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus claimed that the solar system revolved around the Sun.
Some people thought he might have been right, but quiet people disagreed; that the solar system revolved around the Earth, including the Sun (and even other stars).
That seems reasonable, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, does it?
The Amazon is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times as much water as the second largest river.
The Amazon River is the widest river on Earth, reaching almost 9.7 kilometers wide in places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers worldwide into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river of the Amazon is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical achievement of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom inhabited the monuments of their predecessors, which were thousands of years old.
The Vatican City has approximately 800 residents. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the everyday language of most people who work for the state, while Latin is often used at religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
Even in ancient times, people were familiar with basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper, because they could be discovered naturally in nature and relatively easily mined with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything consists of a mixture of one or more of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
That was more than the 4 aggregate states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma; although he also theorized that they would transform into new substances to form what we see.
Alloys are mainly a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Naturally, metals like silver and gold also exist.
There are also layers with small quantities of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the universe consists of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that billions of them could fit at the end of this sentence.
The pencil was therefore a good friend to many people when it was invented.
Unfortunately, the pencil is becoming less important and used with the development of new writing methods.
People now write messages on computer screens and no longer need a boss.
One can only wonder what happened to the keyboard when something new comes along.
The atomic bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to force a nucleus of many protons and neutrons to combine.
As a heavy burden is rolled up a hill. The renewed splitting of the cell nucleus then releases a part of this energy.
A few atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they break apart with little or no trigger.
The lunar surface consists of stones and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The forest is approximately 70 km thick on the near side and approximately 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the marshes and thicker over the highlands.
More lava can occur on the leeward side because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to cling to the surface.
Content theories focus on finding out how people think or what they say.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that change as they come into adulthood.
This theory considers what it does with certain people who want what they want, and how things in their environment lead them to want or not want certain things.
Two prominent theories of content are Maslow's theory of the hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two narrative patterns can emerge when managers start mentoring their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum aims to "remain a colleague" (or colleague).
This type of leadership struggles to make unpopular decisions, implement disciplinary measures, conduct performance reviews, delegate responsibility, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable person who feels they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Nevertheless, the boss is ultimately responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This story has often led to a rift between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same quality standards as conventional teams, but there are subtle differences.
Virtual team members sometimes act as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
She often has more autonomy than conventional team members, because her teams can meet according to the respective time zones, which is not always understood by local management.
The cohesion of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989 p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the management team to which each individual member reports. The invisible team sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization undertake the time-consuming process of building a learning organization? One of the goals of implementing organizational learning concepts is innovation.
When all available resources are effectively deployed within a company's functional areas, creativity and ingenuity can be expressed.
Here, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new, innovative process that meets the needs of clients.
In order for an organization to be innovative, it must first create a culture of innovation and shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Den Engels (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the field of research and make it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain disorders, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
New technologies enable us to see and examine brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
That provides us with valuable information and materials to create simulation models that help us understand processes in our minds.
Although AI has a strong connotation with science fiction, it forms a very important area of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of a machine.
KI research encompasses the development of machines for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include tax management, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial recognition.
These things have become separated into distinct disciplines, each focusing on offering solutions for real-world problems.
AI systems are increasingly used today in the fields of economy, medicine, technology, and the military, but are also built into many home computers and video game software applications.
Field trips make up a large part of every class. Sometimes a teacher would like to take their students to places where a bus trip is not an option.
Technology offers the solution with virtual tours. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
A virtual excursion is a good opportunity to reflect on the trip and share experiences with future classes.
Every year, the students of Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital; the website is redesigned every year, but the old versions are kept online to serve as a scrapbook.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the expectations of an audience change in general.
Well students are often the most critical audience, the blog author starts striving to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Blogs "also compel students to become more aware of the world around them." The necessity to gain the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that promotes collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the traditional school day.
A moderate use of blogs "can enable students to become more analytical and critical. By actively responding to online material, students can define their positions in the context of comments from others and also highlight their own perspectives on certain topics (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital of Canada and boasts a variety of art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south lie Niagara Falls, and to the north lies the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka, and beyond that.
All these things and more are what Ontario is known for, as being typically Canadian from the perspective of foreigners.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some are almost uninhabited wilderness.
For comparison of population, which is quite surprising: More African Americans live in the USA than Canadians.
The East African islands lie in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest continent for itself, when it comes to flora and fauna.
The majority of the smaller islands are independent nations or affiliated with France and known as luxury beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the countries, and it was a long way to the Comoros and Mayotte.
The European flow and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama found the sea route from Europe to India.
In the north, the region borders the Sahel zone, and in the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: It is recommended that traveling women state that they are single, regardless of their actual family status.
It also helps to plant a vine (but not one that looks too expensive).
People should recognize that cultural differences can lead to what is perceived as harassment, and it is not uncommon to be followed, to be cornered, etc.
Don't be timid when rejecting men, and don't be afraid to assert yourself (cultural differences or not, it's not really right because of that!).
The ancient city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen and used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar-al-Bayda, and the Spanish merchants who established trading posts there called it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most interesting places to shop all over Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, you can easily find places where traditional Moroccan goods such as tagines, ceramics, leather goods, hookahs, and a variety of carpets are sold, but that's all for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the area of Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's roads, especially the city center.
While it is generally safe to go to Goma, all visits outside of Goma should be coordinated to understand the situation of the ongoing conflict in the North Kivu province.
The city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and for some of the cheapest mountain gorilla trekking trips in Africa.
You can take a Boda-Boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around in Goma. The normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese Francs for a short ride.
The combination with its proportionate inaccessibility led to "Timbuktu" being used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway countries.
Timbuktu is a poor city nowadays, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the List of World Heritage Sites due to the threat from the sand dunes.
It was one of the most important stations during the PBS Special Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
The city stands in stark contrast to the other cities in the country because it has more Arab than African flair.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern border.
The park extends over 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each providing for different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the flagship of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
As is the case in all South African national parks, there are daily conservation and entrance fees here for the park.
It might be advantageous to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to either a selection of parks in South Africa or all South African National Parks.
Hong Kong Island gives the region of Hong Kong its name and is the place that many tourists consider the main focus.
The evolution of the buildings that form the skyline of Hong Kong was compared with a shimmering bar chart, clearly depicted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head towards the Kowloon waterfront promenade.
A large part of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated along reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is the place that the British colonists claimed for themselves, and if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, this is a good starting point.
The Sundarbans are the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending over 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the Bangladeshi and Indian hinterland.
The Sundarbans were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not only mangrove swamps – they encompass some of the last remaining stands of the mighty jungles that once stretched across the Ganges Delta.
The Sundarbans stretch over an area of 3,850 km², of which approximately one-third is covered by water/wetland areas.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that there are now 400 royal tigers and over 30,000 axis deer in the area.
The buses run throughout the day from the Interdistrict Bus Station (on the other side of the river), where most buses, especially those heading east towards Jakar/Bumthang, continue between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
The district-wide buses are often full, so it is recommended to buy a ticket a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese coaster buses that are comfortable and robust.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient way to travel to nearby places such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.5-meter-wide walkways.
The vertical distance under the bridge is 15 meters. The building was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge should be fully operational in September 2017, provided that the Brazilian customs controls are foreseen to be completed.
The Guarani were the most significant indigenous group that lived in present-day Paraguay and as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was the homeland of other groups of indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survived through hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Province of the Indies," came into being as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquerors and the indigenous native groups.
For Spain, the colonization period began, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has largely lost much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is known for having the best polo team and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December at the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
Smaller tournaments and players can also be watched here at other times of the year.
For news about tournaments and where you can buy tickets for polo players, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is equivalent in value to a British Pound (GBP).
Currency can only be exchanged at the only bank on the island located opposite the "FIC West" business in Stanley.
The British Pound is normally accepted everywhere on the islands, and US dollars are also sometimes accepted in Stanley.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the islands, even though British and US currency are accepted; it is advisable to check in advance with the owners what a suitable payment method is.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Well, since Montevideo is south of the Equator, it's summer there when it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; in the summer months, temperatures usually exceed +30 degrees Celsius.
The winter can be deceptively cold: The temperatures rarely fall below freezing, but the wind and humidity combine to make it feel colder than the thermometer indicates.
There isn't a distinct rainy and dry season: The amount of rainfall remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although the animals in the park are used to seeing people, the wildlife still prefers to be left alone, and you should not feed or disturb them.
According to the park authorities, you should keep a minimum distance of 100 meters from bears and wolves and 25 meters from all other wild animals.
No matter how they look, bison, moose, elk, bears, and even all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't keep enough distance. These animals are large and potentially dangerous; so please respect their distance.
You should be aware that food odors attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid leaving food scraps or containers with strong smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa with just under 40,000 inhabitants. It is located on the island of Upolu.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the scene of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Great Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Almost 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the independence struggle organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city led to the assassination of the highest chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches due to the two harbors of Auckland. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The "North Shore" (in the "North Harbour" district) lies on the Pacific and extends from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
It is a beautiful place on all beaches where one can swim safely, and most are shaded by pohutukawa trees.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located at Waitemata Harbour and in the suburbs of Mission Bay and St. Heliers in Central Auckland.
Those are sometimes overcrowded family beaches with a good selection of beach bars along the coast. Swimming is definitely a must.
There are two local beers, the most important one is 'Number One', it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing; the other one is called "Manta".
There are many French wines that one must have tried, but the New Zealand and Australian wines might potentially go further there.
The local tap water can be drunk with complete safety, but mineral water is easily available if you don't trust it.
The idea of "Flat White" coffee is exotic for Australians. A short black coffee is called "Espresso," cappuccino has a dollop of whipped cream (not foam) on top, and tea is served without milk.
The hot cocoa meets Belgian standards. Fruit juice is expensive but excellent.
Many excursions to the cliff are made throughout the year, and injuries due to one of these causes on the cliff are rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the authorities' advice, follow all signs and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish come to the beaches and river mouths from October to April since 1770. Occasionally, they are also found outside of that time.
Yes, there are them, but they don't attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not actively live in the ocean; their primary habitat is in estuaries north of Rockhampton.
When booked in advance, the traveler can be completely reassured that they can sleep soundly once they have reached their destination.
Travel agents often have offers for certain hotels, although you can potentially book other types of accommodation such as campsites through a travel agent.
Travel agents typically offer packages that include coffee, airport transfers, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation for you if you need more time to consider the offer or to obtain other documents for your travel destination (e.g. visa).
Changes or requests should first be addressed to the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of music festival participants choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be right in the middle of the action, you have to get up early to get a campsite close to the music.
Pay attention, even when the music on the main stage ends, there may still be areas of the festival that play music late into the night.
Some festivals have special camping areas for families with small children.
When you cross the northern east side in winter, check the condition of the cabin, because driving through ice can cause quite a comical situation for those most affected.
Cruises to St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos strictly focus on maximizing the time spent and money spent by clients. Windows and outdoor areas are typically hard to find.
She typically offers special food, drinks, and entertainment to guests at the hotel and on the grounds to keep them there.
Some venues offer alcoholic beverages on tap. But alcohol impairs judgment, and every good player knows how important it is to stay in control.
Anyone driving in high latitudes or over a mountain pass should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the grip is low and you can't drive as you would on tarmac.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a very short time to get someone stuck.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or blowing snow, condensation, or ice on the vehicle windows.
In many countries, icy and snowy conditions are normal, and traffic usually continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the greatest tourist attraction in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" in common usage refers to overland trips to see the amazing African wildlife, especially the savanna.
Some animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to run into cars, and standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes difficult to see and you see them better with a telescope.
A trekking safari (other terms are "bush walk", "hiking safari" or "on foot") consists of hikes, lasting either a few hours or days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. A few events will be held at various locations outside of Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, after already hosting the Games in 1964.
If you booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation terms vary, but since the end of March, most Coronavirus-related cancellation guidelines are not valid until July 2020, when the Olympic Games were planned.
It is expected that most event tickets will cost between 2,500 ¥ and 130,000 ¥, with typical tickets costing around 7,000 ¥.
To help track expenses, it can assist in calculating them. Many hotels have a mileage log and a mileage sheet that you can borrow, even if you are not in the room.
If no stockings are available, or if you don't feel like wearing them, you can try using a hair dryer if one is available.
Be careful that the material doesn't get too hot (which could cause it to ignite or, in extreme cases, lead to burns).
There are various possibilities for water purification, some of which are more effective against specific contaminants.
In some areas, it takes just one minute to boil water, while in others it takes a few minutes.
Filters have different effectiveness, and if you have concerns, you should buy your water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
Travelers can encounter animal pests in their home regions that they are not familiar with.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that can violently injure or kill people are not normally considered pests.
Duty-free shopping is the possibility to buy goods in certain places that are exempt from taxes and excise duties.
Travelers entering countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont offers the most difficult driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway, which frequently passes through secluded forests.
Once you get used to driving on country roads, keep your speed down: avoid inclines, narrow alleys, and sharp curves.
The speed limits in the tunnel are noticeably lower than in the preceding and following sections – normally 56–64 km/h (35–40 mph) – and it is even more important to observe them strictly than usual.
In terms of mobile service, it's here but much stronger than along other stretches, for example, in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite hearty and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor Austria.
Pastries are everyday fare; apples are available all year round, and pastries are baked, and in the summer, tarts and plum preserves are added.

With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide selection of regional cuisines from across the nation.
However, when used without further specification, the term normally refers to food from central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
The Javanese cuisine is currently widely spread throughout the archipelago and offers a range of simply spiced dishes, with the prevailing aromas of Javanese cooking being peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar) and various aromatic spices.
Stirrups are supports for the rider's feet and hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer more stability for the rider, but they can raise safety concerns because the rider's feet can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but gets a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged along if the horse continues to run. To reduce this risk, appropriate safety measures can be implemented.
First, all riders must wear riding boots with a heel and a smooth, quite narrow sole.
Next, there are a few safety harnesses, primarily English harnesses, that allow a climber to fall from the saddle if they are caught behind by a falling rider.
Cochamó Valley – Chile's most important climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, with towering granite walls and rocks.

The descent as a sport dates back to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first leisure club of Norwegians in Australia was founded.
Backcountry skiing on Schi (ski): This activity is also called ski touring, ski tours, or ski mountaineering.
It's linked to that, but it's usually not connected to alpine skiing-like tours or mountaineering, whereby the latter takes place on challenging terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the schist trail as a similar hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover slightly longer distances than on foot – but only with a lot of effort do you reach the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on prepared trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through more countries would mean having to apply for a few visas and go through passport controls.
The Schengen Area functions in this respect similarly to a country.
As long as you stay in this zone, you can generally cross the border without having to go through passport control again.
With a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa separately for each Schengen member state, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of what constitutes an antique. Some tax authorities define goods that are older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be lower in countries like North America than in Europe.
Handcrafted products can be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than similar mass-produced goods.
Animal husbandry is an important way of life for the farmers and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for many other professions.

Travelers are often advised to be aware of the risk of storms that may occur in their area, as they can disrupt travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
During a search on the internet for a "hostile environment course", the address of a local company likely appears.
A course usually covers all the problems discussed here in much more detail, typically combined with practical experience.
A course normally lasts 2–5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and magazines dealing with survival in the wilderness are commonly found, but there are only few publications that address war prayers.

Rip currents are the recurring currents of waves that break on the shore, often near a reef or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the backflow concentrates on a few deeper sections and a strong current and deep water can form there.
Most fatalities are the result of exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to come back to a place where you won't get upset again, or depending on your abilities and whether you notice it, it might be advisable to wait for rescue.
The wedding shock occurs earlier and longer than the culture shock (there's less of a honeymoon phase), lasts longer and can be difficult.
Those who travel and can easily adapt to the new culture sometimes find it particularly difficult to readjust to their home culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to the new culture and lost some habits from your home culture.
When you went abroad for the first time, people were likely patient and understanding because they knew that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.
The Pyramiden Tower and light show is one of the most interesting things for children in the area.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in peace before the show starts.
Normally you always hear the comedy of tourists and traders. The story of sound and light is like a bestiary.
The Sphinx is seen as a backdrop and narrator of a lengthy tale.
The scenes are projected onto the pyramids and the various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several nations and host a number of bases, with 16 active in 2020.

Another is Livingston Island and Deception, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano offers a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Halfinsel, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The inhabitants of the Isthmus here merge with the plateau, then rise again to form the 360 km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, which are divided in two by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part, also called the Sentinel Range, are located the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with Mount Vinson as the highest point at 4,892 m.
In remote areas, without mobile phone coverage, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A satellite phone is generally not a replacement for a mobile phone because you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service is sometimes used by shipping companies, including pleasure boats, as well as expeditions that require external data and speech recognition.
Your local telephone service provider should be able to provide you with further information on how to connect with this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning a gap year is to travel and study.
That is particularly popular with school dropouts, allowing them to have a year off before university without interrupting their education.
A year abroad can actually improve your chances of higher education when you return home.
Normally, prospective students apply to enroll in these study programs.
Finland is a wonderful travel destination for boat trips. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has a few thousand islands in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the archipelago and bays, you don't necessarily need a yacht.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are actually large enough for yachts, smaller boats or simply a kayak offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland with boats carrying seven to eight people.
That can be found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but is otherwise quite unique (e.g., the number in the Netherlands is one in forty).
Most of the various Baltic cruises offer a longer stay in St. Petersburg (Russia).
That means you can visit the historic city for a few days while sleeping on the ship.
If you only arrive in the country by boat trip, you do not need a separate visa (from 2009).
A few cruises are listed with Berlin (Germany) in the brochures. As you can see on the map above, however, Berlin is not on the sea and the price of the cruise does not include a visit to the city.
Traveling by plane can be an intimidating experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have experienced a traumatic event.

For some, understanding how a plane works and what happens during a flight can help overcome anxiety about something unknown or a lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for quickly delivering things. Often, time is critical when it comes to business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, the largest companies have their own planes, but for other routes and smaller companies, it was a problem.
When goods were shipped by air freight, it could take days on some routes before everything was unloaded and cleared through customs.
The only possibility to get it faster was to send it as checked baggage. The regulations of the airlines do not allow you to send baggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The downside of flying in first or business class is having to pay a lot of money for the privilege (or even better, having your company pay for it for you).
But that won't be cheap: As a rough rule of thumb, you can count on paying up to four times as much as for Business class and eleven times as much as for First Class!
Generally, it's pointless to look for discounts only on Business or First Class seats on direct flights from A to B.
Smuggling organizations are well aware that there is a core group of people who want to travel illegally – who are willing to pay a lot of dollars for the privilege of getting there quickly and conveniently – and they demand accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The official language is Romanian, but Russian is widely spoken.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflicts.

Economic ties were re-established between the two parts of Moldova despite the failure of the political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Christian Orthodox.

Remember that you are essentially visiting a place of mass significance, as well as a site that has a practically incalculable importance for another part of the world's population.
Many men and women who survived their time here, and many more who were murdered or perished through hard labor, both Jewish and non-Jewish, still live on.
Treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not vandalize the site by marking or defacing the structures with graffiti.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half the people speak Catalan, a large portion understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.

The Parisian outrage quickly fades when you're a little higher up.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has many forests – mainly beech, fir, and spruce – and displays a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a remarkable diversity of plant communities, due to its range of microclimates, different soils, and varying altitudes.

Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, lynx, wildcat, and owl can be found there, along with many other species.
During visits to the monastery, women must cover their legs with stockings that go over the knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries keep a covering for women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially a headscarf, you will be greeted with a smile by the monk or nun at the entrance.
That's how men have to box, with knees above the hips.
You can also borrow these from the cloakroom at the entrance, but the signs are not washed after every use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing the jackets. One size fits all for men!
The Mallorcan cuisine, like that of similar areas in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork) and uses olive oil everywhere.
Simply beloved cold cuts, especially in the summer, are the "Pa amb Oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes and all available ingredients like cheese, tuna, etc.
All main verbs never precede the word "Sie" (they/you formal) for "Dir" (you informal) and always begin with a capital letter, even at the start of a sentence.
That's a very important opportunity to distinguish between several verbs and objects.
It probably also simplifies reading, although writing is a bit complicated due to the necessity of determining whether a verb or adjective is used in a nominalized form.
The pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian, because most words are pronounced just as they are written.
The most important letters to know are c and g, because their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.

Singapore is generally a very safe place to live and very easy to navigate, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
However, since it is located in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you must be prepared for both heat (always) and strong sun (when the sky is clear, less often).
There are also a few buses going north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.

Many of the traditions surrounding the holiday were also adopted by non-believers and non-Christian countries and non-Christians worldwide.
There is a tradition to spend Easter Eve awake on an exposed spot to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are naturally Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it can easily be about a pre-biblical spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold an Easter Vigil on Saturday during the Easter weekend, where the communities often celebrate the Resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All the animals that originally came to the island either swam, flew, or drifted on the water.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammalians were not in a position to undertake the journey, which is why the giant tortoises were the first living creatures in the Galapagos.
Since humans set foot on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including cattle, horses, sheep, rats, goats, and dogs.
When you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, you experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
That's a great opportunity to see the Northern Lights, because the sky is more or less dark around us.
Well, since the regions are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore often not a problem, are you also able to enjoy the stars?
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and more formal than the one people from the West are used to.
Costumes are standard business attire, and employees address each other by family name or job title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial and emphasizes the efforts of the team rather than individual achievements.
Workers often need to seek approval from their superiors for all decisions they make, and it is expected of them that they follow the instructions of their superiors without asking questions.
