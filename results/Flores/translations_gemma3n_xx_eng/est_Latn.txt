Besides proving that at least some dinosaurs had feathers – a widely accepted theory – it allows us to see details that are usually not visible in fossils, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
According to scientists, the animal's plumage was chestnut brown, and the underside was light or yellowish-red.
The find allows us to take a look at the evolution of bird feathers.
Since dinosaur feathers lack the developed quill knobs, known as quill follicles, but possess other feather parts – the plumule and vane, a downy feather base – scientists concluded that quill knobs likely evolved from the other parts later.
The structure of the feathers suggests they were not used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers suggested that the specimen is an example of adult plumage, not juvenile down feathers, although it is a young dinosaur's tail.
Scientists hypothesized that although this is a juvenile dinosaur tail, the sample shows adult plumage, not downy feathers like a chick.

The work done was mostly theoretical, but the program was written to stimulate observations of Ambur from the galaxy.
The effect the team was looking for would be caused by the tidal forces between the galaxy's dark matter and the Milky Way's dark matter.
Just as the moon exerts a pulling force on the Earth, causing tides, the Milky Way exerts a force on the Ambur galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter affects other dark matters in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located around the galaxy as a halo and consists of many small particles.

Candidates may send representatives to observe every part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision who follow specific instructions.

Police Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who assaulted a Swiss woman and recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
When the car hit the house, there were three people there, but none of them were injured.
The leader still suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services freed the driver of the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was taken to the hospital at James Paget's Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since that time, Adekoya has been accused at the Edinburgh Sheriff Court of his son's murder.
He has been taken into custody pending charges and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be of questionable value, as his image has been published in many places.
Elsewhere in Great Britain, this is standard practice, but in Scotland, the legal approach is different, and courts consider the publication of photos to be potentially damaging.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee noted that "journalists seem to be walking a dangerous line when publishing photos, etc., based on suspicions."
The State Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for accusations, has informed journalists that no further comments will be given until at least charges are filed.
According to the leak, the document refers to a border dispute in which Palestine wants it to be based on the 1967 border before the Six-Day War.
Among the other topics discussed were the future of Jerusalem, which is holy to both peoples, and the Jordan Valley issue.
Israel demands that a ten-year military presence be guaranteed in the valley after the signing of the agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow the military to remain for only five years.
Forest rangers closely monitored the shooters participating in the additional pest control test because the test was being monitored and its effectiveness was being evaluated.
Qualified volunteers were recruited within the association of the National Park and Wildlife Service (NPWS) and the New South Wales (NSW) Shooters Union, under the association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of the protected area and cultural heritage of the NPWS park, the four snipers selected for the first shooting operation received thorough safety instructions and training.
Martelly swore in a new temporary election council of nine members yesterday.
This is Martelly's fifth Temporary Electoral College (CEP) over four years.
Last month, the presidential commission recommended the resignation of the outgoing president as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread regime-opposed protests that began in October.
In some cases, the trigger for violent protests was the breakdown of the electoral process, some of which had been anticipated since 2011.
Approximately 60 iPod malfunctions due to overheating have been reported, collectively causing six fires and resulting in minor burns for four people.
According to data from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan, there were 27 accident cases related to equipment.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating cases, which the company described as "not serious."
In response, the ministry called the postponement of Apple's report "truly regrettable."
An earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday evening).
The Northern Mariana Islands Crisis Management Office said that no damage had been reported in the islands.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there were no indications of a tsunami forming.
A former Philippine policeman took Hong Kong tourists hostage, hijacking their bus in the Philippine capital, Manila.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and in at least six cases, it has been confirmed that they are dead.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, were released earlier together with Filipino photographers.
Photographers later took the place of an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was saved by a lucky shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and made a career in medicine.
She studied to become an obstetrician and started working at Auckland産婦人科病院 (Auckland産婦人科病院) in 1959.
While Liggins was working at the hospital, he started to study premature birth in his spare time.
Her studies showed that if the fetus is administered a certain hormone, it accelerates the development of the fetal lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators recovered two black boxes from the plane's flight recorder on Tuesday.
Even the wrestling colleagues paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said: "Luna was the first queen of extremism. My first manager. Luna left us two months ago. Truly unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented that "Luna was just as strange as I am... maybe even stranger... I love her and miss her... hopefully she is now in a better place."
Out of 1400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number opposed to the Australian Federation increased by 8 percent compared to 2008.
Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard stated during the 2010 federal election campaign that in her opinion, upon the monarchy's end, Queen Elizabeth II should come to Australia as a commoner.
34 percent of respondents in the survey share the sentiment that Queen Elizabeth II should remain Australia's last monarch.
At the extremes of the results, 29% of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic at the first opportunity, while 31% believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in 100m and 200m freestyle swimming and three relay races at the Games of the Peoples, but his readiness is in doubt due to complaints.
He hasn't been able to take the medication he needs to recover from the pain because it is prohibited during the Olympic Games.
Mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, Curtis Cooper, discovered the largest prime number known to date on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery using various tools and software at the beginning of February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets supplied the Earth with water, along with organic materials that could form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, as comets collided with Earth for a period of time in the past.
Cuomo, 53, became governor earlier this year and signed the law legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He called rumors political spin and foolishness.
It is speculated that he will run in the 2016 presidential election.
NextGen is a system that, according to the FAA, would allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon dioxide emissions.
Instead of using older terrestrial radar-based technology, this utilizes satellite-based technology, which allows air traffic controllers to more precisely determine aircraft locations and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transport is offered, and above-ground trains do not stop at Wembley. Furthermore, there are no above-ground car parks or "park and ride" facilities.
Out of fear of a lack of transport, the possibility was raised that the match would have to be played behind closed doors without the team's supporters.
A study published Thursday in the journal Science announced the discovery of a new bird species on the Galápagos Islands, which belong to Ecuador.
Researchers from the University of Princeton in the USA and the University of Uppsala in Sweden reported that the new species evolved within just two generations, although it was thought that the process would take much longer. The species resulted from a cross between the endemic dark-ground finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the invasive ground finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be rolled into tiny designs.
It is possible to stretch it into a thin wire, which can be twisted or woven into a braid. It is possible to unravel it or roll it into thin sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to other metals. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-painted pictures in books, which were called illuminated manuscripts.
This is called the chemical's pH. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on whether the chemical is acidic or alkaline (basic).
The pH level of a studied chemical indicates the amount of hydrogen ions (H represents hydrogen in pH) present.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders together and then squeeze them into a ball with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with external layers, creating a funny sensation and forming a kind of crust.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, a water closet was found in almost every house, connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of canalization systems have been found in Crete, in the houses of Minoan cities, and in Santorini, Greece.
Toilets existed in Ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public bathhouses where men and women were mixed together.
If you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives the call and reflects it almost instantly back.
A rocket sent the satellite into space. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere slightly distorts the light and view.
A gigantic rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The most significant change the wheel has brought us is much easier and faster transportation.
Thanks to that, we have a train, a car, and many other transport devices.
On the lower rung of this scale are medium-sized predators that feed on medium-sized prey, ranging from rabbits to antelopes and goats.
Finally, there are many small predators (including stray cats) that eat a significantly larger number of small prey animals, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a specific task that each cat does, which keeps them from competing with each other.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Herds consist of one to three adult males related by blood, and up to thirty females and calves.
Females are usually very closely bonded with each other, forming large families consisting of sisters and daughters.
Lion herds behave in many ways like wolf and dog herds – animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other large predators) and are also very deadly to their prey.
The tiger, a versatile athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, cover large distances by jumping, and pull five times the strength of a strong human.
The tiger belongs to the same genus (Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. Only these four cats can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like a lion's booming voice, but rather like words growling from a sentence.
Opossums like to eat small animals. They try to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Almost all of the animals that opossums hunt are significantly smaller than them.
Scientists believe that badgers track and locate prey (victims) by scent, sniffing out places where they have been.
Their night vision is excellent, and they also move very stealthily. The ocelot blends into its surroundings to hunt prey and then pounces on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes separated from the main population they originate from (for example, by moving over a mountain range or river, or migrating to a new island, and returning is not easy), they often find themselves in a different environment than before.
In a new environment, there are different resources and different competitors, so the new population needs different characteristics than previously required and must adapt to be a strong competitor.
The initial population has not changed at all; they still require the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to its new environment, they look less and less like the other population.
As a result, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they cannot be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which simply means the emergence of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that people breathe, and they absorb carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants make their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make our houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is made from plants. Animals couldn't survive without plants.
Mosaurus was the top predator of its time and therefore feared nothing except other Mosasaurs.
His long jawbones held over 70 ultra-sharp teeth, and in addition, he had extra teeth in the palate, meaning nothing that crossed his path escaped.
It's not known for sure, but mosasaurs may have had a bifid tongue. Their diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and they may have even been man-eaters.
He attacked anyone who went into the water, even a gigantic dinosaur like a T-Rex wouldn't be an opponent for him.
While most of their food would be familiar to us, the Romans had their share of strange or unusual delicacies, including wild boar, peacock, dormice, and a rodent called the unihiir.
The second difference was that while poor people and women ate sitting on stools, rich men enjoyed feast meals where they rested in a reclining position.
Ancient Roman diets could not include foods that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa, and not a single Roman ever tasted turkey.
Babylonians built a temple for each of their gods, which was considered the home of the god.
People brought offerings to the gods, and priests took care of the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple has an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary, which is accessible only to priests.
Sometimes, special pyramid-shaped towers called ziggurats were built as part of temples.
The tower top was a special shrine to a god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house was not so important.
The Jewish family conducted most of their lives outdoors.
The women cooked outdoors; the shops were simply open counters facing the street. The house was built of stone.
In Canaan, there wasn't a single large forest, which is why wood was extremely expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. According to the sagas of the early Norse settlers, Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he discovered Greenland and named it.
Despite his discovery, Inuit tribes already lived there at that time.
Although each country was Scandinavian, there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might assume that a treasure map was drawn on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But that's not true. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776". The text is located at the bottom of the document, reversed.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that in its earliest years it was wound into a scroll for storage of a large parchment document (measuring 29 ¾ by 24 ½ inches).
So it is likely that the mark was simply added as a label.
D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not free.
There reigned the Vichy French. These were the people of France who made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting them.
Allied forces landed in southern France on August 15, 1940; this operation came to be known as Operation Dragoon.
Within just two weeks, American and liberated French forces had liberated the southern part of France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization is the only culture shared by a significantly large group of living and working people, or society.
The word civilization comes from the Latin word *civilis*, which means "citizen-," and is related to the Latin words *civis*, "citizen," and *civitas*, which means "city or state," and this to some extent also defines the size of a society.
City-states are pioneers of nations. Civilized culture means the transmission of knowledge across many generations, a lasting cultural footprint, and sufficient cultural dissemination.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies first formed a confederation based on the Articles of Confederation, which consisted solely of a Congress as its central government.
The Congress lacked the power to establish taxes, and since there was no national executive or judicial power, it relied on the powers of the regional authorities for the enactment of all legal acts, which were often not very cooperative.
He also did not have the authority to abolish tax laws and inter-state tariffs.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team is the second most successful team in the world after the German national football team, and they won the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Talisport is the most popular sport in northern regions, and Italians compete in it at international competitions and the Olympic Games.
Japan has approximately 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the world's seventh-largest island country!
Due to the chain/group of Japanese islands, Japan is often referred to as an archipelago in a geographical sense.
Taiwan was mentioned as early as the 15th century, when European sailors sailing by wrote the name of the island down as Ilha Formosa, or "beautiful island".
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in the south of Taiwan, initiating a reshaping of the indigenous people's grain production practices and employing Chinese workers in rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) brought the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan under its control and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following its defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894–1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding the right to govern Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures – namely Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what they originally looked like.
By 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic film format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
This product is still manufactured today, but even more importantly, its proportions were inherited from the dimensions of image sensors in digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusingly 36mm wide and 24mm long.
Therefore, the aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is considered to be 3:2.
Many common formats (such as the group of APS formats) are equal to or very close to this aspect ratio.
The often-misunderstood and frequently mocked rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism, maintaining a measure of order in the composition.
According to this, the most effective location for the main subject is at the intersection of lines, dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, began to be carefully controlled.
For over a thousand years, Christianity had united European states, despite differences in their languages and customs.
This all-encompassing power affected everyone, from the king to the common citizen.
One of the main beliefs of Christians is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's financial resources are intended for that very purpose.
The center of ecclesiastical power had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money raised questions for many about whether this principle was upheld.
Soon after the start of the war, Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective – it cut off vital supplies for both military and civilian personnel, although this blockade violated generally recognized international law, which has been codified in numerous international treaties over the last two centuries.
Great Britain deployed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering healthy ocean areas, endangering even neutral vessels.
Since this tactic didn't elicit a special reaction, Germany was waiting for a similar response to its limitless submarine warfare.
In the 1920s, a large portion of the citizens and people were inclined towards pacifism and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, countries desired to avoid such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at the Edison Company in New York City.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents, a poetry book, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his supervisor at his last place of work) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of describing different periods; each stage of Chinese history or each ruling family had a separate dynasty.
Also, there was a period of unstable division of provinces between each dynasty. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce battles took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
The era of the Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in ancient Chinese history – thousands of people died in their struggles for dominance, hoping to gain the highest power in the grand palace of Xi'an.
There have been many social and political impacts, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just the ruler.
Even after the Revolution, all fields of activity were open to all male candidates, which allowed the most ambitious and successful to achieve success.
The same applies to the military, as instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on military merit.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class representatives in various countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad felt a great interest in worldly life compared to deeper matters. He had a habit of often going to the cave in the Young (Light) Mountain, which became known as Hira, to contemplate.
A cave that has weathered the ages offers an evocative image of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The Koobas is completely isolated from the rest of the world, located at the summit of a mountain north of Mecca.
Actually, it's not easy to find at all, even if one were to announce its existence. If you are already in the cave, it is completely isolated.
There is nothing to see except for the clear, beautiful sky and the numerous surrounding mountains. Inside the cave, very little of the world is heard and seen.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, is one of many gigantic pyramid structures erected in honor of the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings, contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), numerous small tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wives and family members.
The sign "vöör püsti" resembles the letter V, and the sign "vöör all" resembles parentheses or a square with the bottom side missing.
"Up" means you should start from the top and push the handle, and "down" means you should start from the base of the handle (the place where your hand holds the handle) and pull the handle.
An upward stroke creates a softer sound, while a downward stroke is stronger and more forceful.
You are welcome to include your markings, but please remember that the printed lines are added for musical reasons and should be respected.
Frightened Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Therese and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Madame Elizabeth, were forced to leave Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a mob of market women from Paris.
They traveled back to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a rabble that shouted and screamed threats towards the king and queen.
The people's power compelled the king and queen to keep the windows open.
At one point, a member of the crowd, horrified before the queen, decapitated the royal guard who had been killed at Versailles.
The war costs of US imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid for by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States of America to cover expenses incurred on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions, including expenses and interest on bonds.
Of course, the superprofits earned from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people formed the elementary profits of US imperialism.
To understand the Knights Templar, one must understand the context that motivated the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is called the High Middle Ages and it was a period in European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The early Middle Ages preceded the High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages followed, with the year 1500 being considered the end according to agreement.
Technological determinism is a concept that encompasses various ideas in practice, ranging from technological impetus or technological imperative to a firm belief that the destiny of humankind is guided by the logic associated with the laws of science and its manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that is largely culturally or politically influenced, and that technology itself exerts an influence on society that is rather internal than socially determined.
For example, one could say that the existence of motor vehicles certainly necessitates the development of roads.
However, the domestic road network is not economically viable for a small number of cars, therefore new production methods are being developed to reduce the costs associated with car ownership.
Widespread car ownership leads to a higher number of accidents on the roads, which in turn leads to the development of new repair techniques for injured bodies in healthcare.
A significant aspect of Romanticism was cultural determinism, which relied on writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time, customs and culture associated with geography arose. These, being in harmony with the community's location, were superior to arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known today as the fashion capital of the world, Constantinople was seen as the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its fame as a place where all luxuries were concentrated began around 400 AD and lasted until approximately 1100 AD.
Its status declined primarily in the 12th century due to the fact that the crusaders had returned with gifts such as silks and spices, which were more valuable than those offered in the markets of Byzantium.
At that time, the title of fashion capital passed from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, Byzantine culture, characteristic of the East, strongly influenced the dress.
However, due to slow communication channels, styles in the West could lag behind by as much as 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the most significant developments stemming from the Crusades during this time was the adoption of buttons for fastening clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture in which food is produced in such quantities as to be sufficient to meet the needs of only the farmer and his family.
Organic farming is a simple, often nature-friendly system where seeds obtained from the ecological region are used to increase yields, or crop rotations, or other relatively simple methods such as...
Historically, most farmers made their living from agriculture, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar ideas who feel that societal norms do not apply to them, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished based on the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
Characteristics that allow a subculture to be distinguished can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of certain subcultures often signal their affiliation through the use of a distinctive and symbolic style, encompassing fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to focus on the few unfortunate cases where adults failed to socialize children, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse.
Children like this are called feral or wild children. People (often their parents) have kept them in the wild; in some cases, parents abandoned the child due to a serious intellectual or physical disability.
Wild children may have experienced severe mistreatment or trauma before being abandoned or running away.
Allegedly, others were raised by animals, and in some cases, it is said they lived wild in nature on their own.
If a child is raised entirely by animals, a feral child (within physical limits) behaves almost entirely like the animal that raised them, for example, fearing humans or being indifferent to them.
Although project-based learning should simplify and make acquisition more interesting, the approach of educational scaffolding is a step further.
Scaffolding (support) is not a teaching method, but rather a way to support people who are gaining new learning experiences, such as learning to use new computer software or starting a new project.
Support can be both virtual and real, or in other words, support can come from a teacher as well as the little pencil-shaped figure in Microsoft Office.
Virtual steps are integrated into the software, with the aim of questioning, referencing, and explaining procedures that may be too complex for a student to accomplish alone.
Children are placed in orphanages for various reasons, ranging from neglect to abuse and even coercion.
No child should grow up in an environment that is nurturing, caring, and educational, yet this happens.
We find that the foster family system creates a safe zone for these children.
The goal of our foster care system is to provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable medical care.
A foster family should ensure all the needs that were lacking in the home from which the children were previously removed are met.
The internet combines elements of both mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The unique aspects of the internet bring additional dimensions in terms of usability and satisfaction.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are highlighted as important drivers of internet use (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal engagement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivating aspects when they studied audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting facial movements lasting only a few milliseconds, also known as microexpressions.
First of all, it is claimed that it is possible to detect whether a person is lying by correctly interpreting microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks highlighted in his article "The President's Speech" that people who cannot understand a speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately recognize sincerity.
He even suggested that the ability to interpret such human behavior exists in animals, such as domesticated dogs.
Studies conducted in the 20th century have shown that there are two sets of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
With a mutation, a new genetic variation is added, and selection removes the accumulation of expressed variations.
During segregation and recombination, diversity oscillates back and forth between the two populations in each generation.
The baboon is a primate with a digestive system similar to humans, and it has difficulty fulfilling its amino acid needs using the available plants.
Furthermore, if it fails to be done, there will be serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based sources to access would have been the proteins in leaves and vegetables, but primates like us can only digest them easily when cooked.
On the other hand, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but also provide a large amount of protein containing all the essential amino acids.
Considering all of this, we shouldn't be surprised that our predecessors solved their lighting problem in roughly the same way that chimpanzees do today on the savanna.
Sleep disruption is a purposeful process of waking up during a normal sleep period and falling back asleep shortly after (10–60 minutes).
It's easy if you use a relatively quiet alarm clock that brings you to consciousness but doesn't fully wake you up.
If you find that you are turning off your alarm clock while sleeping, you can place it on the other side of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based choices include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or diuretic teas) before going to bed to force yourself to wake up and urinate.
The amount of a person's inner peace is inversely related to the amount of tension in the body and soul.
The less tension, the more positive the present vitality is. Every person is able to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only obstacles to reaching this goal are tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of Buddha, but it was expanded with the Mahayana Path of Love and various Indian yoga techniques.
Basically, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses the path of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and all-encompassing love.
Through yogic breathing exercises (pranayama), mantras, and visualizations, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened in Kundalini yoga.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the yoga of deities. Through visualizing various deities, energy channels are purified, chakras are activated, and a light-filled consciousness is created.
Germany was the common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, the countries fell out due to clashes in systems, processes, and culture.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies were already enemies, and the Cold War began.
This was supposed to last for the next 40 years, and authorized armies were supposed to actually fight on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defense had already been broken, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian bridgeheads.
These plans collapsed almost overnight when more than 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and broke through the Valdivostok and Ukrainian fronts after the conquest of eastern Polish territories, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
The use of ships for transporting goods is undoubtedly the most efficient way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the navy has been to ensure that the state can move people and goods, while at the same time preventing the enemy from moving those people and goods.
One of the most notable recent examples of this was the North Atlantic campaign during World War II. The Americans attempted to transport men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid Great Britain.
At the same time, the German navy, which primarily used submarines, tried to stop this traffic.
If the allies had failed, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Great Britain as well, just like the rest of Europe.
It seems that goats were initially domesticated about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to keep them in order to gain easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Tamed goats were generally kept in herds that grazed on hillsides or other pastures and were often herded by children or teenagers, similar to known sheep herders. These herding methods are still used today.
Railway lines were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the railway tracks consisted of nothing more than parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses pulling them to achieve greater speeds and haul larger quantities than could be done on the slightly uneven roads of the time.
Fish plates were adopted quite early on to keep the rails in place. Gradually, however, it became clear that rails are more effective with iron bars on them.
This became the usual method, but iron consumed more wooden wheels from the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first completely iron rails were put into use.
The first known mode of transport was walking – Homo erectus (or upright man) began to walk upright two million years ago.
Walking upright was not habitual for their ancestor, the australopithecus.
Examples of specialization for bipedalism can be found in the fossils of Australopithecus, dating back to 4.2–3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have been able to walk on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
In order to reduce future suffering to some extent, we can start living more environmentally friendly, join the environmental movement, and even become activists.
Often, it's just like treating symptoms. But if we don't want just a temporary solution, we have to find the root cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It is quite clear that the world has changed significantly due to humanity's scientific and technological advancements, and problems have grown larger due to overpopulation and humanity's unsustainable lifestyle.
After the Congress had adopted it on July 4th, the bill, signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was sent to John Dunlap's printing shop a few quarters away.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, now known as the Dunlap copies.
The first public reading of the document was conducted by John Nixon on July 8th in the Independence Hall.
One was sent on July 6th to George Washington, who had it read aloud to his soldiers on July 9th in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 copies made by Dunlap are the oldest surviving copies of the declaration. The original handwritten copy is not preserved.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs has survived to the present day. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, birds still have several characteristics that make them look like dinosaurs.
They have scaled and clawed feet, lay eggs, and walk on two back legs like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the binary format.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are also called binary numbers or – when using computer terminology – bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general and do not allow for immediate diagnosis.
A clear sign of ingested or ingested poison may be an open medicine package or poisonous household chemicals located nearby.
Look at the label for first aid instructions for the specific poison.
Entomologists officially use the term lutiklarid for this group of insects.
This term comes from a long acquaintance with lice, which have adapted extremely well to living as parasites on humans.
Both bedbugs and dust mites are troglobiotic, adapted to life in nests or in the host's dwelling.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease affecting the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research found that the occurrence of multiple sclerosis is twice as likely in women as in men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not in their or the child's best interests.
These couples may choose to give their child up for adoption.
During adoption, biological parents relinquish their parental rights so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The primary goal of science is to elucidate how the world works using the scientific method. In fact, this method forms the basis of most scientific research.
Scientific research is not guided solely by experimentation – an experiment is a test used to rule out one or more possible hypotheses – but also by asking questions and observing.
Scientists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin Bible.
Aristotle's scientific views, including those in psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language decreased, the Western world felt disconnected from the Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Several physiological and behavioral rhythms often depend on endogenous cycles and their generation through biological clocks.
The occurrence of periodic rhythms, which are not simply reactions to external periodic factors, has been documented in most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillatory system that continues its free-running periodicity even in the absence of external cues.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence indicating that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They performed two assays, labeling the DNA phage with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children; mutations elsewhere may cause cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in visiting natural sites to enjoy the views and even wild plants and animals.
Examples of local activities include yachting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Boreno.
Every morning, people leave the small towns by car to go to work, and others pass by them who work where they just came from.
In this dynamic transport hub, everything is connected in some way to the transport system based on private vehicles and supports it.
Science has now shown that this enormous carbon dioxide-producing economy has displaced one of the biosphere's most stable states, which has been favorable to human evolution for the last 2 million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you rarely hear complaints of water quality or collapsing bridges to the same extent.
Why do transport systems generate complaints about everyday failures? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is a study that examines the movement of individual vehicles between two points and their mutual interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic flow analysis is complicated because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave reasonably consistently, so traffic flows tend to be reasonably consistent as well and can be largely represented mathematically.
To better describe traffic flow, relationships have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These connections contribute to the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to start moving with the help of air. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies, find food, and find a mate much more easily.
Most insects are able to fold their wings against their body.
This gives them more opportunities to find small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that are unable to fold their wings backwards are stick insects and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some thought he was right, but many thought the opposite – the solar system, along with the Sun (and even other stars), moved around the Earth.
That seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, do you?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the largest river in the world. It carries eight times as much water as the second largest river in the world.
Amazon is also the widest river on the planet, sometimes six miles wide.
20% of the water flowing from the world's rivers into the oceans originates from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids from stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, nothing surpassed the size of the Giza pyramids or the technical knowledge of their construction.
The old Egyptians of the new state admired the monuments of their predecessors, which were then considerably over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
The Vatican uses the Italian language in law-making and official communication.
Italian is also a daily language used by most people working in the country, while Latin is used in religious services.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have been aware of the basic chemical elements, such as gold, silver, and copper, since ancient times, as they can be found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to mine with rudimentary tools.
The philosopher Aristotle assumed that everything is formed from one or more mixtures of four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
It was more like four aggregate states (in the same order) – solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma – although he also speculated that they form new substances that we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You may also have melts that contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit in the period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was, when it was first introduced, a good friend to many.
The importance and use of pens have decreased, as unfortunately newer writing methods have emerged.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to use a sharpener.
It can only be speculated what will happen to the keyboard when something new emerges.
A nuclear bomb works on the principle of taking energy to force a nucleus to come together with many protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Re-splitting the atom releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with the slightest disturbance or spontaneously.
The Moon's surface consists of rocks and dust. The Moon's outer layer is called the crust.
The coral is about 70 km thick on the front side and 100 km thick on the back side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the highlands.
On the closer side, there might be more seas because the crust is thinner. It was easier for the lava to rise to the surface.
Achievement needs theories attempt to understand what motivates people to act and what they enjoy.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted during the process of maturing into adulthood.
These theories address what motivates certain people to do the things they do, and what environmental factors cause these people to do or not do certain things.
The two most popular needs-based theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
When managers start leading their former peers, this can generally elicit two-fold behavior. One extreme tries to stay "one of the guys (or girls)."
It is difficult for this type of manager to make unpopular decisions, enforce rules, conduct appraisals, assign duties, and hold employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum is a person who transforms beyond recognition, feeling that they must change everything the team has done so far and make it their own.
Ultimately, the manager is responsible for the team's success or failure.
Such behavior often causes discord between management and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are held to the same high standards as traditional teams, but there are still some minor differences.
Virtual team members are often the point of contact for their direct real-world team.
They typically have more autonomy than regular team members because their teams may encounter different time zones that their local management may not understand.
The existence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is a unique component of a virtual team as well.
The invisible team is the management team, to whom each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
What would be the reason for a company to undertake the initiative of creating a time-relevant learning organization? One of the goals of involving business learning concepts in activity is innovation.
When all available resources are efficiently utilized by all functional departments throughout the organization, creativity and ingenuity begin to emerge.
As a result, the company's cooperation in overcoming obstacles may lead to a new innovative process that meets the customer's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, management must create an innovation culture, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help companies reach higher levels of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, it defines the scope of the field and makes it more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists' research.
It has long been known that different types of brain damage, traumas, injuries, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This gave us a lot of information and material to create simulation models that help us better understand the processes taking place in our brains.
Although AI is strongly associated with science, AI is a very important branch of computer science that deals with machine behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation.
AI research encompasses the automation of machines to solve tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include verification, planning, and schedule creation, the ability to answer client diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines that focus on finding solutions for real-life problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields, and they are also built into many personal computers and video game software applications.
Excursions are a part of every class. Often, teachers would like to take students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers a solution through virtual excursions. Students can view museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Sharing a virtual excursion is also an excellent way to reflect on one trip and share the experience with future classes.
For example, the students of Bennett School in North Carolina design a website every year about their trip to the state capital. The website is redesigned every year, but old versions are kept as a memento.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with sloppy grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger tries to improve their writing skills to avoid criticism.
"Blogging also "forces students to better understand the world around them."" Grabbing readers' attention encourages students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that provides inspiration for collaboration and encourages students to extend learning beyond the traditional school day.
Appropriate use of blogs can help students become more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can determine their position in relation to other people's writings and provide an overview of their own perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, and it boasts a wide selection of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Further south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north stretches Muskoka, beyond which lies the untouched natural beauty of the more distant regions.
All of the aforementioned, and more, highlights what is characteristic of Canada for foreigners in Ontario.
The areas further north are quite sparsely populated and in places are wild, almost uninhabited nature.
A surprising population comparison: There are more African Americans living in the United States than citizens in Canada.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest landmass and, faunally, practically a continent unto itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or affiliated with France, and they are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs brought Islam to these lands, and it became very popular in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: Regardless of marital status, female travelers are advised to say they are married.
It's also helpful to wear a ring (but not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that due to cultural differences, something may be done that they consider harassment, and stalking, grabbing, etc., are not unusual.
Tell the men firmly no, and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded in the 10th century BC by Berber fishermen. Phoenicians, Romans, and Maronites used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city of Dar I-Badyana, and Spanish merchants who established trading centers there named it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
In the Old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather products, hookahs, and a whole range of trinkets, but it's all just for tourists.
Goma is a tourist town in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, near Rwanda.
In 2002, lava originating from the Nyiragongo volcano destroyed much of the city's streets, especially the downtown area.
If Goma is relatively safe, all visits outside of Goma should be researched and understood beforehand, to understand the current state of the conflict in North Kivu province.
The city also serves as a base for ascending Mount Nyiragongo volcano, and moreover, it offers the most affordable opportunities for tracking African mountain gorillas.
To get around Goma, you can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). A typical (local) fare for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
Combined with its relatively inaccessibility, Timbuktu has begun to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway places.
Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its fame makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites due to the threat of desert sand.
This was one of the most important stops in Henry Louis Gates' PBS special "Africa's Amazing Wonders."
Compared to other cities in the country, it is completely different, as it has more of an Arabian than an African feel.
Kruger National Park (KRP) is located in the southeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forming its southern boundary.
The area of the park is 19,500 km² and it is divided into 14 different ecological regions, each supporting a different type of wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions, considered the flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like in all South African nature parks, daily nature conservation and entrance fees also apply in this park.
Also, it may be useful to buy a Wild Card tourist pass, which allows entry to certain South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the Hong Kong territory and is a place that many tourists consider a main attraction.
The row of buildings forming the Hong Kong skyline has been compared to sparkling bar charts reflected in the waters of Victoria Harbour.
In order to see Hong Kong at its best, leave the island and head to the Kwun Tong coastline on the opposite side.
A large portion of Hong Kong Island's urban development projects are located densely on the land along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonizers claimed for themselves. Therefore, it is a good place to start if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest coastal mangrove forest, extending up to 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans is inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List. The part of the forest located on Indian territory is called the Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just mangrove swamps, however – they include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Ganges delta.
The area of Sundarbans is 3850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water or swamps.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has also been a nature reserve, and it is estimated that approximately 400 Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer currently live in the area.
Buses depart from the inland bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakari/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30.
Since the buses between city districts are often full, it is advisable to buy your ticket a couple of days in advance.
Most areas are served by small Japanese beach buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
Shared taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby locations, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Oiapoque bridge is a marvel. It spans the Oiapoque River, connecting the city of Oiapoque in Brazil and the city of Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
Two towers reach a height of 83 meters, the bridge is 378 meters long and has two 3.5-meter-wide lanes.
The bridge's clearance height is 15 meters. Construction work was completed in August 2011, but it was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
According to plans, the bridge will be fully open for operation in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs points are expected to be completed.
The Guarani indigenous people were the most significant group of natives who inhabited the present-day eastern Paraguay region and lived a semi-nomadic lifestyle as hunters who also practiced agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous groups, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived thanks to hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the giant province of the Indies, came into being as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous population.
The Spanish began the colonization period, which lasted three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its native character.
It is well known that Argentina's water polo teams and players are among the best in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the Las Cañitas grounds.
Smaller tournaments and competitions can also be seen here at other times of the year.
Please check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo website for tournament news and semi-final ticket information.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP) at an equal value.
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island, which is located opposite the FIC West store in Stanley.
Generally, British pounds are accepted everywhere on the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are often accepted as well.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the remote islands, although British and US currency may be; consult with the owners beforehand to determine the appropriate method of payment.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands is nearly impossible, so exchange money before leaving the islands.
Since Montevideo is located south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics; temperatures above +30 °C are typical in the summer months.
Winter can be deceptively cool: temperatures rarely drop below zero, but the wind and humidity together create a colder feeling than the thermometer indicates.
There are no specific rainy or dry seasons: the amount of rain remains approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many of the park animals are used to seeing people, it is still wild nature and should not be disturbed.
According to park authorities, you should keep at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how peaceful they may appear, bison, elk, deer, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a safe distance. These are large, wild animals that are potentially dangerous, so please give them the necessary space.
You should also know that smells attract bears and other forest animals, so do not carry strongly scented food with you or cook pungent dishes, and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In the port, the infamous 1889 port blockade took place, in which seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships except for one, a British cruiser, sank. Approximately 200 Americans and Germans died.
During the freedom fight led by the movement of the masses, a peaceful gathering in the capital city of Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III ended with the killing of the ruler.
Because Auckland is bordered by two harbors, there are many beaches there. The most popular of these are located in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (in the North Harbor area) are located in the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay (north) to Devonport (south).
These are almost all the sandy beaches where you can swim safely, and most of them offer shade thanks to the abundant juniper bushes.
The beaches of Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the affluent suburbs of Mission Bay and in St Heliers in the heart of Auckland.
These are family-friendly beaches that are a bit overcrowded, but boast a good selection of shops. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is Number One, which isn't complex in taste, but pleasant and refreshing. The name of the second local beer is Manta.
French wines can be plentiful, but wines from New Zealand and Australia might be more suitable for travel.
Local tap water is perfectly suitable for drinking, but if you're worried, it's easy to find bottled water as well.
"Flat white" coffee is a foreign concept for Australians. A "short black" is an espresso, but cappuccino is served piled high with cream (not foam), and tea is offered without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but excellent.
Many trips are made to the coral reef throughout the year, and it is rare for some of them to cause injuries at the coral reef.
However, heed official instructions, follow all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The box jellyfish is found near beaches and river mouths from October to April north of a city called 1770. They can occasionally be found outside of this period as well.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of humans and swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles don't live entirely in the ocean; their primary habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Pre-booking gives the traveler peace of mind, knowing they will have accommodation upon arrival.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, but you can also find other accommodation options through a travel agency, such as campsites.
Travel agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They may also hold your booking if you want to consider the offer further or obtain other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests should first be discussed with the tour operator, not directly with the hotel.
For some music festivals, the majority of participants decide to camp on-site and consider it a very important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the mosh pit, you need to arrive early to get a camping spot near the music.
Keep in mind that even though music may no longer be played on the main stage, there may be other stages at the festival where music is played until late in the evening.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas designed for families with small children.
If you cross the northern part of the Baltic Sea in winter, check where your cabin is located, because passing through ice creates quite a bit of noise for nearby cabins.
St. Petersburg cruises include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually go to great lengths to keep guests there as long as possible and spend as much money as possible. Typically, there are no windows or clocks, and it's hard to find exits.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment to ensure guests are in a good mood and don't leave.
Some places offer alcoholic beverages on the house. However, being intoxicated impairs decision-making, and all good gamblers know it's important to stay sober.
Anyone driving at high latitudes or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you can't drive the same way as you would on bare asphalt.
During a snowstorm, enough snow can fall in a short amount of time to get stranded.
Visibility can also be limited by falling or drifting snow, condensation, or ice on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, icy and snowy conditions are common in several countries, and traffic continues throughout the year for the most part continuously.
Safaris are probably Africa's biggest tourism magnet and a highlight of many visitors' trips.
The popularly used term "safari" refers to land trips with the aim of discovering African wildlife, especially savannas.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, come close to cars, and their observation is sufficient with standard equipment.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and easier to spot with binoculars.
A safari walk (also referred to as "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing" in English) consists of a trek that can be a couple of hours or several days long.
The Paralympic Games will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will be held in other locations in Japan.
Tokyo, where the 1964 Games were held, is the only Asian city to have hosted the Olympic Games twice.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation rules vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation rules related to the coronavirus no longer apply beyond July 2020, when the Olympic Games were scheduled to take place.
As expected, most ticket prices will be in the range of 2500 ¥ to 13000 ¥, and regular tickets will cost around 7000 ¥.
Ironing damp clothes helps them dry. Some hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they aren't in your room.
If an iron isn't available, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if you have one.
Be careful that the fabric doesn't get too hot (which can cause shrinkage or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for a minute is enough, while in others it needs to be boiled for several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a trusted manufacturer in a sealed bottle.
Travelers may encounter animal pests that are not known in their home region.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.
Infectious diseases themselves or dangerous animals that may physically injure or kill people are not usually classified as pests.
Tax-free shopping is the opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties from certain locations.
Travelers heading to countries with high taxes may sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The Lõik Point between Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often traversing landscapes with often isolated forest thickets.
If you're not used to driving on rural roads, please drive carefully: steep inclines, narrow roads, and sudden curves are common.
Speed limits are significantly lower than in the previous and following sections – typically 35–40 mph (56–64 km/h) – and strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
Curiously, however, mobile service here is much stronger than in many other parts of the route, e.g., in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are really good, and Bavaria is quite rich and diverse in them, similar to those of its southern neighbor, Austria.
Fruit buns are common, with apples being baked into buns throughout the year and cherries and plums making their appearance in the summer.
Many German baked goods also contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes often go well with a cup of strong coffee.
If you'd like some delicious, rich pastries, try a baked good that is called a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.

Indonesian cuisine is a general term encompassing a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country, offering a choice from among 17,000 islands.
But if it is used without additional specifications, the term tends to refer to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of Java Island.
Javanese cuisine, widely available throughout the archipelago, offers a variety of simply seasoned dishes. Peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices are staples of Javanese palates.
The footrests hanging on either side of the saddle are designed to support the rider's feet.
These help the rider maintain better balance, but can be dangerous because the rider's legs can get caught in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their leg gets caught in the stirrup, the horse can drag them along while running. To reduce this risk, precautions should be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear riding boots with a heel and smooth, rather narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety bars that allow the girth to release from the saddle when a falling rider pulls backwards.
In the Cochamo Valley, Chile's primary climbing destination, known as the Yosemite of South America, there are various large granite cliffs and rock faces.
Breathtaking views open up from the mountain peaks. Mountaineers from all over the world are constantly forging new routes on these endlessly promising granite walls.
Winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports that involve descending along snow-covered terrain on skis or a snowboard attached to the feet.
Skiing is a major travel activity among many enthusiasts, who are sometimes known as "ski-bums," who plan to revolve their entire vacation around skiing in one specific location.
Skiing is very old – skiers are depicted in cave paintings dating back to 5000 BC!
Hill skiing was practiced as a sport as early as the 17th century, and in 1861, Norwegians opened the first recreational ski club in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called ski mountaineering, a ski tour, or a ski trek in the wild.
It is related to ski touring or ski mountaineering, but it usually doesn't include them. Ski touring or ski mountaineering is usually done on steep terrain and requires much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of the ski track as a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you can cover somewhat greater distances than walking, but despite groomed trails, you very rarely achieve a cross-country skiing speed that is comparable to riding without a backpack.
Europe is a relatively small continent, yet it still has many independent countries. Usually, traveling through several countries means applying for a visa and undergoing passport control multiple times.
However, in this matter, the Schengen Area functions somewhat like one country.
As long as you stay within the boundaries of this zone, you can essentially cross borders without going through passport control points again.
If you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which manufactured goods are antiques. Some tax authorities define antiques as goods older than 100 years.
The definition varies in different geographical regions; for example, in places like North America, the age limit may be lower than in Europe.
Handicraft items can be called antique objects, even though they are not as old as similar mass-produced items.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for many Sami people, and the culture associated with trade is also important for many other professionals.
But even traditionally, not all Sámi people engaged in extensive reindeer herding; rather, they lived off fishing, hunting, and other similar activities, using reindeer primarily as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people work in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in the Sámi region of Lapland.
Although the word "mustlane" is used widely, especially by those who are not Roma, it is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and an inaccurate portrayal of the Roma people.
If there are travel advisories in place for the country you are visiting, this may affect your travel health insurance or travel cancellation insurance.
Perhaps you would like to consult with another government instead of yourself, but their advice is intended for the citizens there.
As one example, American citizens may face different situations in the Middle East compared to Europeans or Arabs.
The country's travel advice is just a brief summary of a country's political situation.
The presented views are often superficial, generalized, and overly simplified, compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather conditions are a general term for any dangerous weather phenomena with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather conditions can occur anywhere in the world, and there are different types of them that can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are extreme weather phenomena, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods, and waterspouts.
Regional and seasonal severe weather phenomena include gales, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Travelers are strongly advised to be aware of all the dangers of severe weather conditions affecting the area, as this may affect travel plans.
Everyone planning a trip to a country that can be considered a war zone should undergo professional training.
An internet search for a hostile environment course will likely result in the address of a local company.
The course usually addresses the problems discussed here in much more detail, typically with practical experience.
The course typically lasts 3-5 days and includes role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines dealing with the sustainability of wild nature are common, but publications dealing with the war zone are rare.
Travelers planning to undergo a medical tourism surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
Governments' willingness to issue passports without a gender marker (X), or documents that would be updated to reflect the desired name or sex, differs.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents also varies greatly.
Security checks have become much more thorough since the September 11, 2001 attacks.
Pre-operative transgender individuals should not assume they will undergo security checks without their privacy and dignity being respected.
In the case of backwater currents, the water flow bounces back from the shore, often creating a whirlpool or something similar.
Due to underwater landforms, the returning water flow moves to a slightly deeper area, and a rapid flow can form there, heading towards deeper waters.
In most drowning deaths, fatigue caused by struggling against the current is the cause, as it can be an impossible task.
As soon as you're out of the pool, it's no harder to swim back than usual.
Try to move somewhere where it won't drag you down again, or if you don't have the skills and you've been noticed, you might have to wait for rescue.
The shock associated with returning comes earlier than culture shock (the honey week phase is shorter), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who adapt easily to new cultures sometimes find it very difficult to readjust to their own local culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and have lost some of your native cultural habits.
Initially, people were likely patient and understanding towards those who had arrived from abroad, knowing that travelers needed time to adjust to a new country.
People may not anticipate that travelers returning home may need patience and understanding.
For children, the pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most interesting things in this area.
Before the start of the performance, you can see the pyramids in the dark and watch them in silence.
Usually, you always hear the voices of tourists and merchants. Sound and light tell a story just like a picture book.
The Sphinx has served as a spectacular backdrop and storyteller for a long tale.
Scenes are projected onto the pyramids, and different pyramids are illuminated with lights.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several countries and host the most bases – 16 active bases as of 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, with the settlement Villa Las Estrellas.
Among these are Livingston Island and Deception Island, where a crater flooded by an active volcano forms a prominent natural harbor.
Ellsworth County is a region on the southern part of the peninsula, bordered by the Bering Sea.
The hills of the peninsula here merge with the plains, then rise again to form the 360 km long Ellsworth Mountains, bisected by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, with Vinson Peak being its highest point at 4892 m.
In remote areas where there is no mobile network, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones don't usually replace mobile phones, as you need to be outdoors in a clear view of the satellite to make a call.
The service is often used by shipping companies, including pleasure boats, but also by expeditions that require long-range communication and voice.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about establishing a connection with this service.
An increasingly popular option for gap year planners is to travel and study.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before university without negatively impacting their academic path.
In many cases, studying abroad on a gap year in a certain course can improve your chances of continuing your higher education in your home country.
Tuition fees are generally charged for registration in these educational programs.
Finland is a great destination for boating. In this so-called land of a thousand lakes, there are also a thousand islands, located in both the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht to travel between islands and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and larger lakes are indeed large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, and there is one boat for every seven to eight people.
The indicators are comparable in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise this is a unique phenomenon (e.g., in the Netherlands the number is one in forty).
Most different Baltic Sea cruises include a longer stop in Russia, in St. Petersburg.
This means you have a couple of full days to visit the historical town, while you can take a boat back at night and sleep there.
If you only go to the beach on boat excursions, you do not need a separate visa (since 2009).
In the brochures of some guided tours, the city of Berlin in Germany is highlighted. As you can see on the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and a visit to this city is not included in the tour price.
Flying can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if it's their first flight or they have had traumatic incidents in the past.
You shouldn't be ashamed of that; it's not unlike the personal fears and aversions many people have towards other things.
For some, understanding the principles of operation of aircraft and what happens during flight can help overcome fear based on ignorance or lack of control.
Couriers are paid well for the fast delivery of packages. Often, time is critical for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
On some routes, large companies have their own planes, but on other routes, and for smaller companies, there were problems.
If things were shipped by air freight, it could take days for unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to get through this faster was to send it as registered baggage. The airline's rules don't allow them to ship baggage without the passenger, which is where you come in.
The easiest way to fly first class is to shell out a large sum of money for this luxury (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, it's not cheap: as a rule of thumb, you can expect to pay four times as much for business class and 11 times more for first class than for the regular tourist class!
Generally, there's no point even looking for discounts on business or first-class tickets for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines know very well that there is a group of pilots who are willing to pay a lot of money for the luxury of flying somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly for it.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multi-ethnic republic that has suffered under ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic, which has its own government and currency, but which has not been recognized by any UN member state.
Economic ties have been re-established between Moldova's two parts, despite failures in political negotiations.
Moldova's main religion is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.

Even today, there are still men and women alive who survived the time spent here, and even more are those whose loved ones were killed or forced to work to death here, whether they were Jews or not.
Treat this place with all the dignity, reverence, and respect it deserves. Do not joke about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place by marking the buildings with markers or scratching them.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak in Catalan, the vast majority understand it, and practically everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most signs are only in Catalan, because according to the law, it is the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transport and other facilities.
Announcements on the metro are regularly broadcast only in Catalan, but in case of unplanned disruptions, an automated system will notify passengers in multiple languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
It's a common opinion that Parisians are self-centered, arrogant, and full of themselves.
Although it is often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to get by in Paris is still to behave as politely as possible, acting like a "bien élevé" (well-bred) person. This makes getting around significantly easier.
The Parisians' cynical attitude quickly disappears if you show basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is covered in dense forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and it is home to a mix of mountain and Mediterranean flora.
There is a notably wide variety of plant species due to its diverse microclimates, soils, and altitudes.

Here, besides many common species, you can also find rare animals such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, lynx, wildcat, and forest cat.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts that cover their knees and their shoulders must also be covered.
Most monasteries do offer covering garments to unprepared women, but if you have something of your own, especially if it is brightly colored, the monk or nun at the entrance will smile at you.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed at the entrance, but clothing items are not washed after each user, so wearing their skirts may not be pleasant. For men, one size fits all!
Mallorcan cuisine, similar to other Mediterranean cuisines, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses a lot of olive oil.

All nouns, including the word "Sie" (you), always begin with a capital letter, even if they are in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between a verb and an object.
Allegedly, it makes reading easier, although writing is again more complicated, as you need to determine whether a verb or an adjective is used as a noun.
Pronunciation in Italian is quite simple, as most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The key letters to pay attention to are c and g, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.

Pre-modern observatories are now typically outdated and are used as museums or educational facilities.
Since light pollution wasn't such a problem during their peak, they usually settle in cities or university towns, and it's easier to access them than the ones built nowadays.
Most modern scientific telescopes are extremely large facilities located in remote areas with favorable weather conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea originates from China, where plum blossoms were the chosen flowers.
The first cherry blossom viewing parties were hosted by the Emperor in Japan and were intended only for him and other aristocrats of the imperial court.
Plants look their best in their natural habitat, so refrain from taking "just one" specimen.
If you visit the officially designed garden, you will be thrown out without discussion for collecting "samples."
Singapore is generally a very safe place to be, and it's very easy to get around, and you can buy almost anything there after arriving.

It is a tradition to spend Easter Eve awake in an open place to watch the sunrise.
Of course, there are Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian spring and fertility ritual.
More traditional churches often hold Easter Vigil services on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, after which congregations often celebrate into the heart of the night to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the island got here by swimming, flying, or rafting.
Because the mainland is far away, mammals could not undertake this journey, which is why giant tortoises are the primary herbivores on the Galapagos Islands.
Since humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced there, including goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This gives a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky is dark for almost a whole day.
Since these areas are sparsely populated and therefore light pollution is rare there, it is also possible to enjoy the stars there.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners may be accustomed to.
