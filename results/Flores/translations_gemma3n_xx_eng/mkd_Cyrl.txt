This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory that is already widespread, but also provides details that fossils mainly cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional appearance.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal were bone-brown at the tip, and pale or carotenoid in color on the underside.
The find also allows insight into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed shaft, called the main axis, but possess other feather characteristics – soft fibers and soft filaments – researchers concluded that the main axis most likely represented a later evolutionary development from these other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests they weren't used for flying, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers pointed out that, although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the specimen shows adult feathers, not ones like those on a chicken.

They have determined that the Sun functions based on the same fundamental principles as other stars: the activity of all stars in the system is found to be driven by their luminosity, rotation, and nothing more.
Brightness (luminosity) and rotation are used together to determine Rossby number of the star, which is related to the plasma flow.
The smaller the Rossby number, the less active the star is in relation to the reversal of its magnetic poles.

The completed work is mainly theoretical, but the program was written to simulate observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect that the team expects should be triggered by the forces of the tide and the interaction between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon influences the Earth, causing tides, so too does the Milky Way influence the Sagittarius galaxy.
Scientists have concluded that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
This theory states that most of the dark matter around a galaxy is located around it in a kind of halo, and is composed of many small particles.

Candidates may send representatives to testify about each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Schneider testified via video link from a base of the ABV in his homeland.
Besides the event on Wednesday, Karpanedo competed in two individual races at the Championships.
First, she had Slalom, where she didn't finish the first race. 36 of the 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
At her next race, the Veleslalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes faster than the ninth-place Jinjing Dani from Hungary.
Four women skiers from the seated group did not finish the race, and 45 of the total 117 skiers in the Slalom did not qualify for the race.
The police in Madhya Pradesh found and returned the stolen laptops and mobile phones.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five individuals who raped a woman from Switzerland and returned her mobile phone and laptop."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Chief Chandra Shekhar Solanki said that the accused arrived at court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people in the house when the car hit it, no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
Then they transferred him to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has since appeared in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court as an accused in the murder of her son.
She is in custody awaiting indictment and trial, but any evidence from eyewitnesses may be called into question because her picture has been published everywhere.
This is common everywhere in the United Kingdom, but the Scottish legal system is different and the courts consider publishing images to be a potential prejudice.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee highlights that "it really seems that journalists are walking a tightrope when publishing photos, etc. of suspects."
The office of the State Prosecutor, who has full jurisdiction over the judicial proceedings, informed journalists that no further comments will be given until the indictment.
According to the source, the document refers to the border dispute in which Palestine wants the borders to be restored to the state they were in before the 1967 Middle East war.
Like other topics, reportedly, the future state of Jerusalem is also, which is a holy place for both peoples and the dispute over the Jordan River Valley.
Israel is seeking a permanent military presence in the valley for a period of 10 years following the signing of an agreement, while the Palestinian Authority agrees to allow that presence for only a period of five years.
The shooters in the additional pest control trial should be under strict supervision by rangers, as the trial was being monitored and its effectiveness was being assessed.
According to the hunting program of the Association of Sport Hunters, in cooperation with NPWS and the Association of Sport Hunters of Australia (AJW), qualified volunteers have been enrolled.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the acting director of Conservation of Parks and Heritage in NPWS, the four selected marksmen for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Martel yesterday took the oath for a new nine-member Temporary Electoral Commission (SEC).
This is Martelli's fifth temporary electoral commission in 4 years.
Last month, a parliamentary committee proposed that SER (State Election Commission) resign in advance as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
With the Martell commission, he actually reacted to the widespread anti-government protests that began in October.
Sometimes violent protests were triggered by the non-holding of elections, and some date back as far as 2011.
Around 60 cases of faulty iPod devices overheating have been reported, causing a total of six fires, and four people suffered minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) of Japan announced that they are aware of 27 accidents related to the devices.
Last week, METI announced that they received notification from Apple about 34 more overheating cases, which the company considers "unserious".
In its response, the Ministry called the postponement of the Apple report "truly regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 7:19 AM (9:19 AM GMT Friday).
Representatives of the Northern Mariana Islands' Emergency Management Office said that no damage has been reported in the country.
Also, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center announced that there was no indication of a tsunami.
An ex-Filipino police officer held Hong Kong tourists hostage, seizing their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Several hostages were rescued, and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six hostages, including children and adults, were released earlier, as were the Filipino photographers.
Later, the photographers replaced the location with an older woman who had to go to the toilet. Mendoza was shot.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
She studied to be a midwife and started working at the National Women's Hospital in Auckland in 1959.
While working at Ligins Hospital, she began to research premature birth in her free time.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, the maturation of the fetus's lungs in the baby would be accelerated.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" for recording flights on Wednesday.
Luna was honored by her colleagues.
Tomi Drimer said, "Luna was the first Queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna passed away in the evening with two crescent moons. Quite unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Rance gave a comment that "Luna was out there like me... maybe even more... I loved her and I'll miss her... I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the federal elections in 2010, the number of those against Australia becoming a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The incumbent Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections, stated that she believes Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
34 percent of those surveyed share this opinion, wishing for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
According to the extremes observed in the survey, 29 percent of respondents believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim 100 meters and 200 meters freestyle, and three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, there is doubt about his physical readiness.
He couldn't get the medication he needed to overcome the pain, because it was banned by the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the University of Central Missouri, on January 25th discovered the largest known prime number to date.
Several researchers confirmed the discovery using different hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, in addition to organic matter that could have created proteins and supported life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, specifically how Earth was created, because long ago comets collided with Earth.
Cuomo, 53, began his term as governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed the bill for same-sex marriage approval.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and foolishness."
It is speculated that he/she will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that the FAA claims will allow aircraft to fly shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year and reducing carbon emissions.
He uses technology based on satellite, compared to the old technology based on ground radar, to help air traffic controllers more precisely determine the aircraft and provide pilots with more accurate information.
There is no organized additional transport, and the underground trains will not stop at Wembley and the parking lots, and the interchange parking for public transport is not available at the stadium.
The fear of not having transportation has increased the possibility of the match being held behind closed doors without the team's fans.
Research published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the formation of a new species of bird on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
Researchers at Princeton University in the USA and Uppsala University in Sweden report that the new species evolved in just two generations, despite it being believed that this process would take much longer, due to reproduction between the endemic Galapagos finches, *Geospiza fortis* and the large cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be worked into any shape. It can be coiled into small forms.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can be bent and interwoven. It can be hammered with a hammer or pulled into layers.
It can be made very thin and glued to another metal. It can be made so thin that it was sometimes used for decorating hand-made pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH value. An indicator can be made with the help of red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H+ in pH) in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together and then, with clean, damp hands, squeeze them into a ball.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, which you will feel unusually and will form a kind of coating.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with running water in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses in cities from the Minoan era on Crete and Santorini, in Greece.
Toilets existed in the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, in some situations toilets were part of the public baths where men and women went together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives a call and then reflects it back almost at the same moment.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
A colossal rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to send a satellite or telescope into space.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. The best thing the wheel did for us is that it enabled easier and faster transport.
It enabled us the train, the car, and many other vehicles. **Note:** While grammatically awkward, this is the most direct translation preserving the original word order. A more natural English phrasing would be: "It enabled us to have the train, car, and many other vehicles." or "It provided us with trains, cars, and many other vehicles."
Beneath them are several medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, which ranges from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
In the end, there are many small cats (including stray domestic cats) that eat a large number of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of domain, a unique aspect that every cat has which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social cats that live in large groups called prides.
The herd consists of one to three blood-related males, along with a maximum of thirty females and young.
Women are typically closely connected to each other, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
A pride of lions behaves similarly to a pack of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in behavior (but not other large cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, the tiger can climb (although not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of the strongest man.
The tiger is in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are the only ones that can roar.
The tiger's roar is not like the loud roar of a lion, but rather more like a sentence of words that resemble 'neighing and loud shouting'.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are significantly smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and find animals to eat (prey) by scent, sniffing the ground where they were.
They have good eyesight in the dark and nocturnal vision and move stealthily as well. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings and then pouncing on it.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) is separated from the main population from which it originated (for example, if it migrates over a mountain range or a river or if it migrates to a new island from which it cannot easily return), the same is often found in an environment different from the one in which it was previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population will need different traits or adaptations to be a strong competitor, compared to what it needed previously.
The initial population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, the new population begins to adapt to its new environment and starts to resemble the other population less and less.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will look so different that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very significant part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen which people breathe, and absorb the carbon dioxide which people exhale.
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
Our dwellings are made from plants, and our clothes are also made from plants. Plants represent a large part of the food that we eat. Animals could not survive without plants.
The mosasaurus was a top predator of its time, and feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
His long tusks were lined with more than 70 sharp teeth, along with another row in the upper part of his mouth, meaning there was no escape for whatever came in his path.
We don't know for sure, but it's possible he had a saw-toothed tongue. He fed on shellfish, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it's even possible he was a cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water; even a gigantic dinosaur like a Tyrannosaurus Rex was not too big for him.
Although most of our food is familiar, the Romans also had strange or unusual dishes, such as wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a "polb."
Another difference was that while the poor people and women ate their food sitting on stools, the wealthy people liked to have communal feasts, where they would rest while eating their meals.
The dishes from Ancient Rome certainly did not contain products that came to Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have any corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted bulgur.
The Babylonians built a primary temple for each of the gods, which was considered their home.
People offered sacrifices to the gods, and priests tried to serve the gods' needs through rituals and celebrations.
Every temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests could enter.
Sometimes, separate elevated structures in the form of pyramids, called ziggurats, were built as part of the temples.
The peak of the elevation represented a special sanctuary for the god.
In the conditions of a warm climate in the Middle East, houses were not so important.
Most of the life of the ancient Jewish family took place outdoors.
The women cooked in the yard; the shops were just outdoor stalls facing the street. Stone was used for building houses.
In the country of Canaan, there were no dense forests, so wood was very expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Old Norse sagas say that Eric the Red was driven from Iceland for murder, and when he sailed west, he discovered Greenland and named it so.
Regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already been living there at that time.
Despite each of the countries being "Scandinavian," there were many differences among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might believe that there is a map of hidden treasure on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Even though there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a wealth card.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence are written the words "Original Declaration of Independence of July 4, 1776". The text is printed upside down and is located at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the large parchment (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up for storage at the beginning.
So, the note could have been added simply as a label.
The landings on D-Day and the subsequent battles liberated the northern part of France, but the southern part was still not liberated.
He was managed by the "Vishiyevan" French. They were Frenchmen who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies invaded Southern France, and the invasion was called Operation Dragoon.
In just two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the Free French liberated Southern France and turned towards Germany.
Civilization represents a distinct culture shaped by a significant large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civil," related to the Latin word "civis," which means "citizen," and "civitas," which means "city" or "city-state," and that somehow defines the size of society.
City-states are harbingers of nations. Civilizational culture indicates the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a lasting cultural imprint, and considerable spread.
Small cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen states first formed a weak central government – where the Congress was the sole constituent part – according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to introduce taxes and, since it lacked national executive or judicial bodies, it relied on the state authorities, which often did not cooperate, to implement all of its laws.
Furthermore, there was no authority to reject the laws on taxes and customs between states.
The articles required unanimous consent from all states before they could be amended, but the states regarded the central government with such a lack of seriousness that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and was the champion of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Among the most popular sports are: football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, wrestling, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), making it the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the group of islands that Japan has, it is often called an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan, initiating a change in local grain processing practices and employing Chinese laborers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took over the coastal areas of western and northern Taiwan and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures, namely "Intihuatana", "Temple of the Sun", and "Room of the Three Windows".
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a glimpse of how they looked originally.
By 1976, restoration work had been completed on thirty percent of Machu Picchu, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format for a still photograph in the world is 35mm, which was the film size that dominated at the end of the era of analog film.
Today it is still produced, but more importantly, its ratio is inherited from the sensor formats of an image from a digital camera.
The 35mm format is actually quite confusing, 36mm wide by 24mm high.
The aspect ratio of this format (which is divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of a whole number) is therefore considered to be 3:2.
Very common formats (for example, the APS format group) are identical or significantly close to the ratio.
The most abused and frequently ridiculed right of thirds represents a simple rule that creates dynamics while maintaining order in the image.
It highlights that the most effective placement of the main subject is at the intersection of the lines dividing the image into thirds both vertically and horizontally (see example).
During this period of European history, the Roman Catholic Church, which had become rich and powerful, was subject to criticism.
Despite the differences in languages and customs, Christianity united European states for over a thousand years.
Her comprehensive power influenced everyone, from the king to the common person.
One of the main Christian principles is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's financial resources are intended solely for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been located in Rome for over a thousand years, and such a concentration of power and money has led many to question whether its principles are being upheld.
Shortly after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy proved to be effective, disrupting the necessary supply to the army and civilians, although the blockade violated generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the last two centuries.
Great Britain mined international waters to prevent ships from entering parts of the ocean, posing a danger even to neutral vessels.
Because there were few options for responding to this tactic, Germany had expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
During the 1920s, attitudes of pacifism and isolation prevailed among most citizens and nations.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid such a situation again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to begin working for Edison's company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the United States with $4 in his name, a collection of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Bachelor (his manager from his previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of portraying different historical periods; each era of China or any ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Also, between each dynasty there was an unstable period of divided provinces. The most well-known of these phases was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han Dynasty and the Jin Dynasty.
During this period, fierce battles were fought between many nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period is one of the bloodiest eras in the history of ancient China, when thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest position in the imperial palace in Xi'an.
There are numerous social and political influences, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to all people, not just a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the Revolution, job opportunities were opened for all male candidates, allowing the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the army, because instead of ranking in the army being based on class, it is now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed people of the working class in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in matters beyond this earthly life. He often went to a cave that became known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) to contemplate.
He retreated into a cave that has endured through time, offering a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
Located at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find, even if someone knows that it exists. Once you enter the cave, it's complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and the multitude of surrounding mountains. Only a small part of this world can be seen or heard from the interior of the cave.
Of the seven wonders, only the Great Pyramid of Giza still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of the many large pyramidal structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza Plateau or the Giza Necropolis in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings contains several pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and most of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The symbol "overstrike" resembles the letter V, and the symbol "understrike" resembles a connector or a square missing its bottom side.
Up means you should start at the top and push the bow, while down means you should start at the frog (where your palm holds the bow) and pull the bow.
Moving the bow upwards produces a softer sound, while moving it downwards produces a more forceful and aggressive sound.
Feel free to write your markings, but remember that the printed notes are there for musical reasons, so they should generally be respected.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forcibly returned to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789, by a group of women from the market.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by crowds of people who were shouting and threatening the king and queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open the carriage windows.
At one point, a man from the crowd shook his head at the royal guard killed at Versailles before the terrified queen.
The military costs of American imperialism in the conquest of the Philippines were borne by the Filipinos themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime to cover the majority of the costs, and the interest on the bonds fluctuated on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the substantial profit gained from the long-term exploitation of Filipinos represented a key advantage of American imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order.
The time when these events occurred is usually called the High Middle Ages, during the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000 - 1300 AD).
The Early Middle Ages preceded the Developed Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages followed, which conventionally ends around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a concept encompassing a wide range of ideas in practice, from technological impetus or technological imperative to a strong feeling that human destiny is guided by a fundamental logic connected to scientific laws and their manifestation in technology.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two general ideas: that the development of technology, by itself, follows a path that largely transcends cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has "effects" on societies that are inherent, rather than socially conditioned.
For example, someone might say that motor vehicles necessitate the development of roads.
However, a network of roads at the state level is not economically worthwhile just for a few cars, so work is being done on new production methods to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to an increased frequency of road accidents, which results in the development of new medical techniques for treating injured bodies.
Romanticism contained a significant element of cultural determinism, adopted by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture connected to geography emerged, being better than arbitrarily imposed laws in harmony with the place of society.
Just as Paris is known as the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
Its reputation as a center of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status deteriorated during the 12th century primarily due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts, such as silk and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
During this period, the title of "Capital of Fashion" passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style culminated between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
At the beginning, clothing was under great influence of Byzantine culture in the East.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western fashion knew how to lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments during that time, as a result of the Crusades, was people starting to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Existential agriculture is farming carried out to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Existential agriculture is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seed originating from the bioregion in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize production.
In the past, most farmers cultivated land for their own needs, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals with similar beliefs who feel marginalized by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be diverse as a result of the age, ethnic group, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that define a subculture as characteristic can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often mark their membership through a characteristic and symbolic use of style encompassing fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to look back at several unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, hardship, or intentional abuse by adults, remained unsocialized while growing up.
Such children are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children were kept by people (most often by their parents); in some cases, this abandonment of the child was a result of the parents' refusal to accept the child's serious mental or physical disability.
Rough children may have experienced severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or escaping.
Others are supposedly grown from animals; it is said that some lived in the wild on their own.
When a feral child is fully grown, it exhibits (within physical limits) behaviors almost identical to the animal that cared for it, such as fear of or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning is intended to facilitate and make learning more engaging, the technique called "scaffolding" goes a step further.
The technique called "scaffolding" is not a learning method, but rather a support tool that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is a type of scaffold, but so is a person with a connector in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into the software and is intended for querying, prompting, and explaining procedures that might be too difficult for a student to master on their own.
Children are placed in orphanages or foster families for reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even exploitation.
No child should grow up in an environment that is not nurturing, caring, and educational, yet they still grow.
We believe that the care system is a safe zone for these children.
Our care system should provide safe homes, caring foster parents, stable education, and a secure healthcare system.
Care should provide for all the needs that were lacking in the home from where they were previously taken.
The internet contains elements from both mass and interpersonal communication.
The specific characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of uses and access to satisfactions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Amy and McCord (1998) identify "personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" as new motivational aspects, researching audience reactions to websites.
The use of video footage led to significant discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
More specifically, it is claimed that it may be possible to detect if someone is lying through the accurate interpretation of micro-expressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his book "The Talking Patient," noted that people who are unable to understand speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess sincerity.
He even points to the fact that such abilities to interpret human behavior may be shared with animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century has proven that there are two groups of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection allows for the removal of it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination shift the allele variation back and forth between the two groups in each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like humans' to satisfy its amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Furthermore, if it is not successful, there will be serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The most readily available plant resources would be the proteins found in leaves and shoots, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless prepared.
Contrary to that, animal food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible but also provides a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering all the circumstances, we should not be surprised if our ancestors solved their "protein problem" in almost the same way that chimpanzees do in the savanna today.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentional awakening during your normal sleep and falling back asleep shortly thereafter (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm to wake you up without fully waking you.
If you happen to stop your clock while sleeping, you can put it in the other room so that you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
The other options based on biorhythms include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, which is known as a diuretic) before bed, which means a person has to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is inversely related to the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the pressure, the more positive the vital life force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us on the path to our goal is the pressure and negativity within ourselves.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, which were expanded with the path of Mahayana love and numerous techniques from Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
With Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) awakens through postures in yoga, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is "divine yoga." Through visualization of several deities, energy channels are cleansed, the chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is formed.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. After the war, differences in systems, processes, and culture led to disagreements between these two countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies and the Cold War began.
It was supposed to last for the next 40 years and involve a real struggle, with proxy armies, on military fronts from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense force had already been defeated, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize beyond the Romant Bridgehead.
However, these plans quickly became obsolete when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army invaded and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of the eastern parts of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Non-Aggression Pact between the Soviet Union and Poland, and other international bilateral and multilateral agreements.
Transporting goods by ships is definitively the most efficient way to transport a large number of people and goods across the ocean.
The work of the navy, by tradition, is to ensure that your state maintains the ability to transport your people and goods, while at the same time hindering the enemy's ability to transport his people and goods.
One of the most important examples of this recently was the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Britain.
Simultaneously, the German navy, mainly using U-boats, attempted to stop this traffic.
If the allies had suffered a defeat, Germany would likely have been able to conquer Britain just as it did with the rest of Europe.
Probably, goats were first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to preserve them in order to easily obtain milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were usually kept in herds that grazed along rows or pastures, guarded by goat herders who were most often children or adolescents, similar to the better-known sheep herders. These breeding methods are still used today.
Horse-drawn trams were made in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriages were mainly built of parallel wooden planks, they could be pulled by horses for greater speed and to haul a heavier load than what was carried on the then-poor roads.
Railway sleepers were used from the beginning to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually determined that the rails would be more efficient if they had a piece of iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron caused greater wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the carriages.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron ones. In 1767, the first train with completely iron wheels was put into service.
The first known method of transportation was walking; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the Australopithecus, were not accustomed to walking upright.
Bipedal adaptations have been found in fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years, although Sahelanthropus may have walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can start behaving more friendly towards the environment, adhere to the ecological movement, and we could even be activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
In many cases, this is like symptomatic treatment. However, if a temporary solution is not sought, then the root of the problems should be identified and eradicated.
It is quite clear that the world has changed greatly due to the scientific and technological progress of humankind, and problems have become more significant because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After its adoption by the Congress on July 4th, the manuscript draft, signed by the President of the Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary Charles Thomas, was sent a few streets down to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, between 150 and 200 specimens were made, now known as "Dunlap's pages."
John Nixon publicly read the document for the first time in the courtyard of the Independence Building on July 8th.
A sample was sent to George Washington on July 6th, from which he read to his soldiers in New York on July 9th. A sample also arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Danlup documents that still exist are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The handwritten original is not preserved.
These days, many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. They are called birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
But there are many things about birds because of which they still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and talons, lay eggs, and move on their two back legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on managing information encoded with binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits, or, using computer jargon, they are called bits.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. The symptoms, such as vomiting, are quite general, so a diagnosis cannot be made right away.
The best indicator of internal poisoning can be the presence of an open medicine box or toxic chemicals for the household.
See the label for specific first aid instructions for the specific poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term larva in a formal sense.
This term originates from the ancient similarity to lice, which are insects well adapted for parasitizing humans.
Both lice and parasites are nidicolous, adapted to living in a nest or inhabiting their host.
There are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) in the United States, making it the leading neurological disease among younger and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that attacks the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Research has shown that women are twice as likely to have multiple sclerosis as men.
The couple may decide that raising a baby is not in their best interest or in the best interest of their child.
These couples have the opportunity to create an adoption plan for their baby.
When adopting, the biological parents terminate their parental rights so that another couple can have parental rights over the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, most scientific research is conducted using this method.
But, however, it's not just that, but also experimentation, and an experiment is a trial used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, posing questions, as well as observation, also leads scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, with a particular emphasis on the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As knowledge of the Greek language diminished, the West remained disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Numerous observed rhythms in physiology and behavior often significantly depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their generation via biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not just reactions to external periodic signals, have been documented for most living organisms, encompassing bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that will continue with a period of free cyclic movement even in the absence of external signals.
The experiment of Hershey and Chase was one of the leading postulates that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phages or viruses to incorporate their own DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which either the DNA in the phage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein in the phage was labeled with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutated genetic cells can be passed on to children, while mutated cells in any other location can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including flora and fauna.
Examples of activities on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting parks and studying information about the ecosystem.
An example of this is visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the small towns by car to go to work and pass by others whose work destination is the place they have just left.
In this dynamic shared mobility environment, everyone is connected in some way and supports the private car-based transportation system.
Science now points to the fact that this massive economy based on carbon has displaced the biosphere from its state of stability that has sustained human evolution over the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, such complaints about water quality or bridge collapses are rarely heard.
Why do transport systems cause such floods of complaints and disappoint us daily? Are transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more significant happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with 100% certainty.
Fortunately, drivers know how to maintain a reasonably constant pace; therefore, traffic flows tend to have a certain reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better illustrate traffic flow, relationships have been established between the three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These regulations assist in the planning, design, and operation of road infrastructure.
Insects were the first animals to fly in the air. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and partners more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings back against their body.
This provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
Today, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are fairyflies and mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many believed the opposite; that the solar system revolves around the Earth, including the Sun (and even the other stars).
This seems reasonable, because you don't feel the Earth moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It carries more than 8 times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, being up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers around the world originates from the Amazon oceans.
The main flow of the Amazon River is 6387 km (3980 miles). It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in their size and the technical excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom admired the monuments of their ancestors, which were then already over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800 people. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the smallest population.
Legislation and official communication of the Vatican are in Italian.
People who work in the country use Italian daily, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People knew about the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because all of these can be found in nature in their native form and are relatively easy to excavate with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle believed that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements, namely earth, water, air, and fire.
That's something like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also thought they changed into new substances to create what we see.
Legumes are actually a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic system is composed of many elements.
Metals include elements such as calcium and potassium. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
There may also be slags that encompass small quantities of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is created from matter. All matter is made up of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could be gathered at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil became a good friend to many when it appeared.
Unfortunately, with the advent of new writing methods, the pencil's status and use have diminished.
People now write messages on computers and never have to approach a sharp object again.
Someone can only wonder what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The physical bomb functions on the principle that energy is needed to create a nucleus from a multitude of protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Then, with the repeated division of the core, some of that energy is released.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with or without external influence.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the "crust".
The crust is thick about 70 km on the near side and 100 km on the far side.
The nettle is better under the seas, and thicker under the highlands.
There might be a more extensive basalt plain on the near side because the crust is thinner. This makes it easier for lava to reach the surface.
Cognitive theories focus on discovering what motivates people or what they enjoy.
According to these theories, people have certain needs and/or desires that are adopted as they mature from childhood to adulthood.
These theories explore what makes some people want what they do and what aspects of their environment will compel them to do or not do certain things.
The two popular content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally speaking, there are two ways of behaving when managers start leading their former colleagues. On the one hand, there's the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance reviews, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable for their actions.
At the other end of the spectrum, a person transforms into an unrecognizable individual who believes they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
However, the leader bears ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
Such behavior often leads to conflict between leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams work according to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are minor differences.
Virtual team members often function as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
They often have greater autonomy than members of a conventional team because their teams may meet depending on different time zones, which may not be understood by their local management.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is also an exceptional component of a virtual team.
The management team is the "invisible team" to which every member is accountable. It is the visible team that sets the standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating a learning organization? One goal of putting concepts of organizational learning into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively in all functional departments of the organization, creativity and genius emerge.
As a result, the organization's collaboration process to overcome obstacles can lead to a new and innovative process for serving customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, its leadership must create a culture of innovation, along with shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of consciousness. Therefore, it narrows the scope of research and makes it much more precise.
The relationship between brain pathology and behavior is the basis of scientists' research.
It has been known for a long time that different types of brain damage, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to view and explore previously unseen structures and processes in the brain.
This is how a lot of information and materials are secured for the creation of simulation models that will help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong connotation of science fiction, it represents a very important branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in artificial intelligence involves making machines automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to respond to user diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to real-life problems.
After being integrated into several software applications for home computers and video games, the VI system is now often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and the military.
Field trips are a significant part of every classroom. Often, the teacher would like to take her students to places where bus travel is not an option.
Technology offers a solution with virtual tours. Students can explore museum artifacts, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful works of art while sitting in class.
Even a virtual shared excursion is a good way to remind about a trip and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students from Bennett High School in North Carolina design a website for their trip to the state capital; every year the website is reconstructed, but the old versions are kept online to serve as an album.
Blogs also help improve students' writing. Although students often start their blogging experience with weak grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience mainly changes that.
Since students are the most critical audience, the blogger starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogging "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to feed the audience's interest inspires students to be clever and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that encourages collaboration and motivates students to extend their learning far beyond the traditional school day.
Correct use of blogs "can encourage students to be more analytical and critical; by actively responding to online materials, students can define their positions in the context of the written texts of others, and also highlight their own views on specific questions (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is the charming, bilingual capital city of Canada, characterized by a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
The Niagara Falls are in the south, while the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and the surrounding area.
All of these things, and much more, make Ontario perfectly Canadian, as foreigners believe.
The large areas to the north are sparsely populated, and parts of them are almost uninhabited wilderness.
Compared to the population, which surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the US than Canadians.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean, off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is convincingly the largest continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or are united with France, and are known as luxurious seaside resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to the islands, and it quickly spread to the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and colonialism began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: All female passengers are advised to state that they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It also helps to wear a ring (just not a ring that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can lead to what they might consider abuse, and it's not uncommon to be followed, have your hand grabbed, etc.
Be firm when rejecting men and don't be afraid to stick to your beliefs (with or without cultural differences, that doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and the Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids used it as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and built it under the name Casa Branca, but abandoned it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Daru l-Badi, but it was given the name Casablanca by the Spanish merchants who established trading posts here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around old Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagine dishes, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of cheap decorations, but everything is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of Congo, in the most remote eastern parts, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from the Nyiragongo volcano, which buried most of the city's streets, especially the city center.
While Goma is relatively safe, any trip outside of Goma should be checked to ascertain the state of unrest that persists in North Kivu province.
The city is also the jumping-off point for the Nyiragongo volcano, as well as some of the cheapest mountain gorilla treks in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to bypass Goma. The usual (local) price is ~500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
Along with its relative inaccessibility, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for exotic, faraway lands.
Although the city is a tourist attraction and has an airport, today Timbuktu is a poor city.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
He was one of the main contributors during the PBS special program, "The Wonders of the African World" by Henry Louis Gates.
The city is a complete contrast to the other cities in the country, because it has more Arabic charm than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of the Republic of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River forms its southern boundary.
The park extends over an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into 14 different eco-zones, each with a different animal world.
It is one of the biggest attractions in South Africa and is considered the leader of South African National Parks (SANParks).
As with all South African national parks, there are daily conservation fees and park entrance fees.
Also, it may be useful to buy a "Wild Card" with which you can enter any park in South Africa or all the national parks of South Africa.
The name of the territory of Hong Kong comes from Hong Kong Island and it is the place that is the main focus for many tourists.
The layout of the buildings that make up Hong Kong's skyline is compared to a dazzling graph highlighted by the presence of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head away from the Kowloon shoreline.
The majority of urban development on Hong Kong Island is concentrated on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
That is the place that the British colonizers occupied, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, it's a good place to start.
Sundarbans is the world's largest tidal mangrove forest, spreading 80 km (50 miles) along the coast in the interiors of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The part of the forest on Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
But the forests are not just swamps with rhizomes – they encompass some of the last remaining strongholds of the great jungles that once covered the Great Floodplains of Ganja.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/wetlands.
Since 1966, Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that today 400 royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer live in that area.
Buses depart from the Intercity Bus Station (across the river) all day, although most, especially those traveling east and towards Dzhakar/Bumtlang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the intercity buses are often full, it is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
In most areas, small Japanese minibuses are used, which are comfortable and sturdy.
Taxi sharing is a fast and efficient way to travel to nearby destinations, such as Paro (150 ngultrums) and Punakha (200 ngultrums).
The bridge over the Oiapoque River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oiapoque River and connects the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
The two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two paths, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it wasn't opened to traffic until March 2017.
The plan is for the bridge to be fully functional in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs points are expected to be completed.
The Guaranis were the most significant indigenous group that lived in present-day eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for sustenance.
The Chaco region was home to other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Guayкуру and Payaguas, who survived by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly known as the "Greater Province of Southeast Asia," arose as a result of the encounter between the Spanish conquistadors and the indigenous groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted more than three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its native character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for some of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year is in December at the Las Canitas polocrosse grounds.
Smaller tournaments and matches can also be viewed here, and in other parts of the year.
For news about the tournaments and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, check the Asociacion Argentina de Polo (Argentine Polo Association).
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which has the same value as a British Pound (GBP).
Money is exchanged at the only bank on the islands located in Stanley, directly opposite the "FIC West" store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and Stanley credit cards are also accepted, while American dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on the remote islands, although you might be able to pay with British and American currency; check with the owners in advance to determine acceptable payment methods for you.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Montevideo is located south of the Equator, so it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo has a subtropical climate; in the summer months, temperatures are usually above +30 degrees Celsius.
Winter knows how to be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the wind and humidity together make it feel colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no specific "rainy" or "dry" periods: the amount of rainfall remains relatively constant throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are used to seeing people, they are still wild animals, so they should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park service guidelines, maintain at least a 100-yard/meter distance from bears and wolves, and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
No matter how tame they look, bison, elk, bears, and almost all large animals could attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please give them their space.
Also, keep in mind that smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking food with a strong odor and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of just under 40,000 people.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
In 1889, the infamous port blockade occurred at the port when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships sank, except for one British battleship. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
In the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of the supreme chief Tuputu Tamasese Lialofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the fact that Auckland encompasses two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three areas.
The beaches on the northern shore (in North Harbor district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Beach to the north to Davenport to the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and most of them have shade from the trees in the afternoon.
The Tamaki Drive beaches are located in Viitiomata, in the affluent suburbs of the Hauraki Gulf and St Helier's in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches that can sometimes get crowded, with a good selection of shops along the coast. Swimming is safe.
The most well-known local beer is called "Nambur One," which is not a difficult, but rather pleasant and refreshing beer. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that can be enjoyed, but wines from New Zealand and Australia travel better.
Tap water is perfectly safe to drink, but bottled water can be easily found if you're concerned.
The idea of "regular white" coffee is not typical for the residents of Australia. Short black coffee is "espresso," cappuccino is with a lot of whipped cream (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is made according to British standards. Although expensive, the fruit juices are excellent.
Trips to the spine are common throughout the year and injuries to the spine rarely occur from these causes.
However, follow the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay attention to safety warnings.
The jellyfish appears along the beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of 1770. It can occasionally be seen outside of this timeframe as well.
Sharks really exist, but, nonetheless, they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and just swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live constantly in the ocean; their original habitat is in river estuaries, north of Rockhampton.
With advance booking, the traveler can be assured of having a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents usually have agreements with certain hotels, although you can book accommodation elsewhere, such as a campsite, through a travel agency.
Tourist agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transfer to/from the airport, or even combined packages with flight and hotel.
They can hold your reservation if you need some time to consider the offer or to provide other documents for your destination (for example, a visa).
All changes and additions or requests should first be checked with the travel agent, and not directly with the hotel.
At some festivals, the majority of visitors to music festivals decide to camp on site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be as close to the center of the action as possible, you will have to arrive early and get a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stages has ended, there are parts of the festival where music is played until late at night.
At some festivals, there are special camping zones for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin's location because passing through ice creates a terrible noise for the most endangered.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include city tours. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the conditions).
Casinos typically put a lot of effort into maximizing the time and money spent by their guests. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are hard to find.
They usually have special offers on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep guests in good spirits and make them stay.
Some places offer homemade alcoholic beverages. However, drunkenness impairs judgment, and all good players know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or through mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or very low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low and you cannot drive as you would on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall in a very short time to trap you.
Visibility can be limited by falling or drifting snow, or by condensation or freezing on the vehicle's windows.
On the other hand, frost and snow are normal conditions in many countries, and traffic proceeds almost unimpeded throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the biggest tourist attraction in Africa and the most prominent for many visitors.
The popular meaning of the term safari refers to a land journey for observing the beautiful African animal world, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach vehicles closely, so even standard equipment allows for a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy and are best viewed with binoculars.
Hiking safaris (also known as "wilderness walks," "mountain trekking safaris," or "hiking") consist of walking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some of the events will take place at other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to host two Summer Olympics, having previously hosted the Games in 1964.
If you booked a flight and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you may find yourself in an awkward situation.
There are differences in cancellation policies, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies triggered by the coronavirus are not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled to take place.
Most tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, with standard tickets costing around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for loan, even if they are not in the room.
If you don't have an iron, or if you don't want to wear ironed socks, then you can try using a hair dryer, if you have one.
Be careful not to overheat the material (which could cause shrinking, or in extreme cases, burning).
Although there are various ways to purify water, some of them are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, it is enough for the water to boil for one minute, while in others, several minutes are needed.
Filters differ in efficiency, which you should consider, and you should think about buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Passengers may encounter pests or harmful animals that are not present in the regions they come from.
Parasites can spoil food, cause inflammation, or in more serious cases, allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit infections.

Tax-free shopping is an opportunity to purchase goods exempt from taxes and excise duties in certain locations.
Passengers traveling to countries with high taxes can sometimes save a lot of money, especially on goods like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch from Point Marion to Fairmont on Interstate 70 offers some of the most exciting driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, passing through isolated forested areas.
If you are not used to driving on country roads, be careful: there are steep inclines, a narrow road, and sharp curves.
The posted speed limits are significantly lower than in the preceding and following sections, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), so strict adherence to them is even more important than usual.
However, surprisingly, the mobile signal is much stronger here than in other areas, such as the Divines in Pennsylvania.
German pastries are very good, and in Bavaria they are very rich and varied, similar to those in their southern neighbor, Austria.
Usually, pastries with fruit are made, with apples in the dough throughout the year, and during the summer, you can find them with cherries and plums.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes go excellently with a cup of strong coffee.
If you like small but rich donuts, try these, which are called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the region.
Kari is a dish of herbs and spices, which contains meat or vegetables.
The dough can be "dry" or "sticky," depending on the amount of liquid.

The term Indonesian cuisine is a general term that encompasses diverse regional cuisines found throughout the nation of 17,000 islands.
However, if used without additional attributes, the term usually means food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Now widely available throughout the archipelago, Javanese cuisine offers a selection of simply seasoned meals. The most dominant flavors of Javanese cuisine are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
The stirrups are support for the rider's feet that hang on both sides of the saddle.
They offer greater stability for the walker, but there may also be safety concerns due to the likelihood of their feet getting caught in them.
If a horse throws off its rider, but the rider's foot gets caught in the bridle, or if the horse escapes, it is possible that it will drag the rider. To minimize the risk, a number of precautionary measures can be taken.
First, most motorcyclists wear boots with heels and a smooth, very narrow sole.
Next, some saddles, especially English saddles, have safety hand grips that allow the girth of the bridle to fall off the saddle if the rider pulls on it during a fall.
The Kohami Valley – the main hiking destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America, with diverse large granite walls and fissures.
The peaks offer views that steal your breath away. Climbers from all over the world constantly create new routes through the endless potential of the mountain slopes.
Winter alpine sports, which include skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you glide over snowy terrain on skis or a snowboard on your feet.
Skiing is a main activity for many enthusiasts traveling, often known as "ski wanderers," whose vacation revolves around skiing in a specific location.
The concept of skiing is very old - there are pictures in caves of skiers dating back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Ski touring: This activity is also called backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
It's related, but doesn't always include alpine skiing or hiking in the mountains, which are done on steep terrain and require much more robust skis and boots.
Consider the ski path as a similar path for hiking.
Under favorable conditions, you could cover greater distances than by walking, but you would rarely achieve the speeds of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack and on well-maintained trails.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would mean repeatedly submitting visa applications and passport control.
The Schengen Area, however, functions somewhat like a single state in this regard.
As long as you are in this zone, in principle, you can cross borders without constantly passing through passport control points.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa to each member state of the Schengen area individually, thus saving time, money, and documentation.
There is no universal definition according to which manufactured objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define objects as antiques as items older than 100 years.
The definition varies according to the geographical location, where the age limit can be shorter in North America than in Europe.
Crafts can be defined as antiquities, although they are newer than similar mass-produced goods.
Hunting is the most important means of survival for the Ainu people, and the culture associated with trade is also important for many other professions.
But even traditionally, not all Laplanders were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, while the reindeer were usually used as working animals.
Today, many Sami people work in modern professions. Tourism is a significant source of income in Sápmi, in the Sápmi region.
Although widely used, especially among those who are not Roma, the word "Gypsy" is usually considered offensive because it evokes negative stereotypes and a false perception of the Roma people.

The presented viewpoints are often superficial, general, and far too simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any adverse weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social unrest, and loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and there are several types, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, heavy rains, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as are thunderstorms, tornadoes, flash floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal phenomena of severe weather conditions include snowfall, snowstorms, severe frost, and strong dust-laden winds.
Passengers are advised to be aware of the risk of bad weather conditions that may affect the area they are in, as this could impact their plans.

Books and magazines about wilderness survival are often encountered, but publications on dealing with war are very rare.
Passengers planning gender affirmation surgery abroad must ensure they bring valid travel documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue passports with an unspecified gender (X) or documents updated with the desired name or gender varies.
The will of foreign governments to bestow recognition upon these documents is equally variable.
Security checkpoint searches became much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not expect to go through scanners without their privacy and dignity being compromised.
The return flow of waves breaking on the beach is fast, most often from a reef or similar structure.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow collects in the deeper sections, and a rapid current can form in the deep water here.
Most deaths occur as a result of exhaustion while attempting to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
Once you're out of the current, swimming back isn't any more difficult than usual.
Try to aim somewhere where you won't get stuck again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been spotted, you might want to wait for rescue services.
The shock upon returning appears earlier than the cultural shock (with a shorter period of bliss), lasts longer, and can be more difficult.
Passengers who easily adapt to the new culture sometimes have a particularly difficult time readjusting to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you've adapted to the new culture and have forgotten some habits from your home culture.
When you go abroad for the first time, people will likely be patient and understanding, knowing that travelers need to adapt to the new country.
Many people wouldn't assume that patience and understanding are also needed for travelers returning home.
The sound and lighting presentation of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things for children in this area.
The pyramids can be viewed in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the start of the performance.
Usually, there's a constant sound of tourists and vendors. The scene with the sound and light is like something out of a fairy tale.
The Sphinx is positioned as a backdrop and narrator of an endless story.
Images are displayed on the pyramids, and various pyramids are illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, have been claimed by several nations and have the most bases, with sixteen of them active in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George, with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
The others include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where the flooded caldera of the active volcano creates a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellesworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bordering the Bering Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here converge into a plateau, and then rise again to form a crown of the Ellsworth Mountains, 360 km long, intersected by the Minnesota Glacier.
On the northern part of the Sentinel Range are located the highest mountains of Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the highest peak of Mount Vinson at 4892 m.
In remote locations, where there is no mobile phone network, a satellite phone may be your only option.
A regular satellite phone is not a replacement for a mobile phone because to make a call, you must be in the open with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
The service is often used by ships, both for cargo and yachts, as well as expeditions that need data and voice messages from a distance.
The local phone operator should be able to provide you with more information about connecting to this service.
A much more popular option for those planning to pause their education is travel learning.
This is especially popular among high school graduates, giving them the chance to take a gap year before university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, taking a course abroad during the gap year can improve your chances of getting into university when you return to your home country.
Typically, there will be tuition fees for enrolling in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for a boat trip. In the "Land of a Thousand Lakes," there are also thousands of islands in both the lakes and the coastal archipelagos.
You don't have to have a yacht in the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelago and the largest lakes are really big enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a completely different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland, and every seventh or eighth person has a boat.
A similar sight can be found in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, and otherwise it is very unique (for example, in Holland the number is one in forty).
Most cruises after the impressive Baltic Sea include a longer stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for several days and return to the ship for overnight stays.
If you go to the coast by tourist boat, you will not need a special visa (since 2009).
Some cruises in the brochures also include Berlin in Germany. As you can see above on the map, Berlin is not close to the sea, so a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or have had a traumatic experience.

Courier services are well-paid for fast delivery of parcels. Time is often very important for business documents, goods, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
For some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but there was a problem for other routes and smaller companies.
If they send shipments by air, some routes require days for unloading and customs clearance.
The only way to transport them faster was to send them as checked baggage. Aviation regulations do not allow baggage to be sent without a passenger. This is where you come in.
The obvious way to travel first or business class is to pay a hefty sum of money for that privilege (or even better, have your company do it for you).
However, this isn't cheap: however it is considered the rule, expect to pay four times more than economy class for a business class price, and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point in looking for discounts for seats in business or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are prepared to pay a large amount of dollars for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and accordingly they charge more.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has experienced ethnic conflict.
In 1994, the conflict spurred the creation of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency, but is not recognized by any member state of the UN.
Despite the unsuccessful political negotiations, economic ties have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova.
The largest religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.

Please view the site with all the dignity, seriousness, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the place by marking or scratching graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Roughly half of the people prefer to speak Catalan, and the vast majority understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are written only in Catalan because it is the first official language by law.
However, the Spanish language is widely used in public transport and other institutions.
Standard announcements in the metro are published only in Catalan, while unplanned disruptions are announced by an automated system in a large number of languages such as Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for being self-absorbed, unfriendly, and arrogant.
While often an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to enjoy yourself in Paris is to be as cultured as possible, to act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-mannered). That will make your stay much easier.
The rough exterior of Parisians quickly disappears if you show a little basic kindness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is abundant with forested areas, mainly of beech, spruce, and fir, and is characterized by a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
There are significantly many variations in plant communities due to the different microclimates, diverse soil, and variable altitude.
The region is also home to an extremely wide diversity of animal species and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, buzzard, lynx, wild cat, and peacock can be found there, as well as many other less common species.
When visiting monasteries, women are required to wear long skirts that cover their knees, and their shoulders should also be covered.
Most monasteries offer headscarves for women who come unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially one in light colors, you'll earn a smile from the monk or nun at the entrance.
Similarly, men should wear trousers that cover their knees.
And this can also be borrowed from what is available at the entrance, but that clothing is not washed after everyone wears it, so you might be uncomfortable wearing those skirts. For men, there is a universal size!
The Majorcan cuisine, like that of similar regions in the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is present in everything.
A simple popular dinner, especially in summer, is "pa amb oli": bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any seasonings, like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "You" (Sie), always start with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.

The Persian language is relatively easy and has a mainly systematic grammar.
Therefore, reading the grammar book will help you learn a lot about the grammar of the Persian language and better understand its expressions.
It should be emphasized that if you know a Romance language, you will learn Portuguese more easily.
However, people who know a little Spanish may quickly conclude that Portuguese is close enough, and therefore doesn't need to be studied separately.
Observatories built before the modern era are usually outdated today and continue to be used as museums or educational sites.
Because when they were most popular, light pollution in them was not a problem as it is today, they are usually found in cities or in boarding schools and are more easily accessible than those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge structures located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The observation of cherry blossoms, known as hanami, is a part of Japanese culture dating back to the 8th century.
The concept originates from China, where the plum blossom is the most beloved flower.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing parties were held by the emperor only for himself and the members of the aristocracy around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when they are in a natural environment. Therefore, resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, you may be mistaken for collecting "specimens" without question.
Generally speaking, Singapore is an extremely safe place to visit and very easy to get around in, and you can buy almost anything upon arrival.
However, considering its location in the "most tropical place" just a few degrees north of the equator, you will also have to deal with the heat (constantly) and the strong sun (less often when the sky is clear).
There are also several buses that go north to Hebron, the place where, according to tradition, the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.

Of course, there are Christian theological interpretations of this tradition, but it is also possible that it is a pre-Christian ritual for spring and fertility.
Traditional churches often hold Easter vigils on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, with a gathering that transitions into a midnight celebration to commemorate the resurrection of Jesus.
All animals that initially came to the islands did so by swimming, flying, or drifting.
Due to their remoteness from the continent, pinnipeds were unable to travel, which made the Galapagos a primary habitat for the giant tortoise.
After humans arrived on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals were introduced, including goats, horses, cows, sheep, cats, and dogs.
You can experience polar night if you visit the Arctic or Antarctica in winter, which essentially means that the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the aurora borealis since the sky will be dark for almost the entire night.
Since the areas are sparsely populated and light pollution is therefore usually not a problem, you will be able to enjoy the stars as well.
The work culture in Japan is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners are used to.
Suits are considered standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
