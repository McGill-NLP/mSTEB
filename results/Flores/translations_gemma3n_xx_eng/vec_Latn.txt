This doesn't just confirm that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already widespread, but provides details that fossils usually don't, like color and three-dimensional arrangement.
I was told that the feathers of this beast were chestnut brown on top with a pale carrot color on the bottom.
The discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers didn't have a well-developed trunk, called a rachis, but did have other feather characteristics like barbs and barbules, scientists have thought that the rachis was probably a subsequent evolutionary development with respect to the other characteristics.
The structure of the feathers suggests it wasn't used for flying but rather to regulate temperature or to show off. Scientists suggest that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers from an adult and not the down of a chick.
The scholars suggested that even if this is the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows features of an adult and not the fur of a chick.

I'm glad you were able to conclude that dark matter has an effect on other dark matter in the same way that normal matter does.
This theory says that a large part of dark matter is found around a galaxy like a halo, and is made up of many tiny particles.

Dr. Tony Moll has discovered a Strains of Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said that the new variant was "truly very problematic and alarming due to the very high mortality rate."
Doctor Moll thinks that some patients can catch the bacteria in the hospital, and at least two hospital nurses are infected.

In France, voting has usually been a rather un-technological experience: voters go into a booth, put a pre-printed sheet in an envelope indicating their preferred candidate.
After the officials verify the identity of the voter, the elector casts the ballot into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.

Since 1988, the ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can see that there are no envelopes present at the beginning of the vote and that no envelopes are added separately except for those of voters duly counted and authorized.
Candidates can send representatives to monitor every part of the process. In the evening, the votes are counted by volunteers under strict control, following specific procedures.

Uka's weapon went off while she had pointed it at the head of a fifth man. Schneider experiences continuous pain, has lost sight in one eye, a part of his skull is missing, and his face has been refashioned with titanium.
Schneider testified with video link from the USAF base in his country.
Apart from the Mercury event, Carpanedo finished two individual races at the Championships.
His first run was the slalom, where the first race didn't finish. 36 of the 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In the other race, the giant slalom, she finished tenth in the women's group with a combined time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the Austrian Claudia Loesch who came in first, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Gyöngyi Dani of Hungary who came in ninth place.
Four of the female competitors in the group did not finish the race, and 45 of the 117 total competitors in the giant slalom were not able to qualify.
The police of Madhya Pradesh recovered the stolen computer and telephone.
The deputy inspector general D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people who violently assaulted the Swiss woman and recovered her telephone and computer."
The names of the accused are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The Superintendent of Poliscia, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, has said that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Even though there were three people inside the house when the car crashed, no one was hurt.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the accident happened was closed for a while while rescuers pulled the driver from the red Audi TT.
He/She was first taken to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
After he/she was taken to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya was at the Edinburgh Sheriff's Court at the moment, accused of having killed his son.
It is currently in custody awaiting a trial date and proceedings, but any testimonial evidence could be contaminated because its image has been made so public.
This is something that happens often in the United Kingdom, but justice in Scotland functions differently, and the courts have seen that publishing photos can be prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee says "journalists seem to be walking on a dangerous line by publishing photos, etc., of suspects."
The Office of the Crown, which is generally responsible for proceedings, has told journalists that there will no longer be any statements at least until the postponement of the trial.
According to the reports, the document will refer to the dispute over the borders, which Palestine wants to be based on the borders before the Six-Day War of 1967.
As far as other topics are concerned, it's the future of Jerusalem, which is sacred to both countries, and the problem of the Jordan Valley.
Israel requests a continued military presence in the valleys every ten years when an agreement is signed, while the PA agrees that this presence should only be for a period of five years.
Those who participated in the supplementary pest control test should be carefully checked by the rangers, while the test was monitored and its effectiveness evaluated.
In association with the NSW (New South Wales) Sporting Shooters Association Inc., qualified volunteers were selected under the hunting program of the Sporting Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the current director of Park Conservation and Heritage of the NPWS, the four selected shooters for the first shooting operation received comprehensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday Martelly swore in a new Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) of nine people.
It's the fifth CEP of Martelly in four years.
Last month, a committee headed by someone recommended the resignation of the previous CEP as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
The sometimes violent protests arose from the fact that elections hadn't been held, some of which were supposed to take place as early as 2011.
It is estimated to be around 60 cases of overheating iPod malfunction, which caused fires with four people suffering minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Commerce and Industry of Japan has said that it is aware of 27 incidents linked to the devices.
Last week, METI indicated that Apple was aware of 34 other overheating incidents that the company defined as "not serious."
The ministry replied saying that the delay of the Apple report is "really regrettable".
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT).
The emergency office of Northern Municipality has said that there was no damage in the nation.
Anca the Pacific tsunami center has said that there were no signs of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer took Hong Kong tourists hostage by seizing his bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot at tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several obstacles have been overcome and at least some of them have been confirmed dead so far.
They hostages, including young people and elderly, were also freed together with the Filipino photographers.
The photographer took the spot from an elderly lady who urgently needed to use the restroom. Mendoza is closed.
Liggins continued in the footsteps of his father and began a career in medicine.
He studied to be a nurse and started working at the Auckland Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at Liggins Hospital, she took the time to study premature birth in her free time.
Their research has shown that giving a hormone would mask the maturation of the child's lungs.
Xinhua reported that government investigators have recovered two "black boxes" from the flight recorders.
The fellow wrestlers paid homage to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer declared, "Luna is the Queen of the East. My first manager. Luna died on the night of the two moons. A truly unique thing, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin “Goldust” Runnels commented saying, “Luna is gone, like me...maybe even more...I love her and I miss her...I hope she's in a better place.”
Of the 1400 people interviewed before the 2010 federal elections, those who do not want Australia to be a republic increased by 8 percent since 2008.
The provisional prime minister Julia Gillard said during the campaign for the 2010 federal elections that she believed Australia should become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
Thirty-four percent of those who participated in the survey agree with this idea and want Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
At the extremes of the survey, 29 percent of those interviewed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to compete in the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays for the Commonwealth, but due to her complaints, her health was put in doubt.
It wasn't good to take the medicine to overcome their pain because they were forbidden by the Jews.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Missouri-Central, on January 25th found the largest known prime number.
Many people have checked the source using various tools and programs since the beginning of February and it was communicated on Tuesday.
Comets could potentially bring water and organic matter to Earth, which forms proteins and supports life.
I am eager to understand how the planets are formed, particularly how the Earth was formed, given that comets have struck the Earth a long time ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, left office at the beginning of the year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
By the way, you said that it's "hello and political money".
I said that he/she/it will run for president in 2016. (Note: "chel" is a Venetian contraction of "che", meaning "that". The gender of "chel" depends on the context, so it could refer to a male, female, or even an organization.)
NextGen is a system that the FAA says will allow planes to fly with shorter runways and save millions of gallons of fuel each year and reduce carbon dioxide emissions.
It utilizes a satellite technology different from the old technology based on ground radar that allows air traffic controllers to point aircraft with greater precision and give pilots more precise information.
No special transportation has been put into operation and the surface trains will not stop at Wembley, and parking and park-and-ride facilities are not available on the ground.
My fears of few transports have made it seem impossible that the match will be played behind closed doors without the team's fans.
A study published in the magazine Science discusses the birth of a new species of iguana on the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
The scholars of Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden have said that the new species evolved in only two generations, even though it is thought that this process lasted much longer, due to the crosses between the endemic finches of Darwin's finches, Geospiza fortes, and the migratory cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Gold can be worked in all forms. It can be rolled into small shapes.
It can be pulled like a thin thread that can be twisted and crushed. It can be beaten or rolled on stones.
It must have been made so subtle and applied to other metals. It must have been made so fine that it was sometimes used to decorate the hand-drawn figures in books called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator with red cabbage juice.
The juice of cabbage changes color depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemical substance is.
The pH level is indicated by the number of hydrogen ions (the H+ of pH) present in the substance being examined.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have lost electrons (since a hydrogen atom is made of one proton and one electron).
Mix the flour together and then with clean, wet hands knead it to make a dough.
The dampness will cause a reaction with the outer layers, which will create a strange sensation and form a kind of bump.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a toilet in almost every house connected to a complex sewage system.
Remnants of sewers have been found in the houses of the smaller cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of the buildings of public baths where men and women used to go together, mixing.
When someone calls you from so far away, you'd really have to use a satellite.
The satellite in space picks up the call and sends it back almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space with a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts the light and our view.
Do you want a large rocket more than 100 feet to put a satellite or a telescope into space?
The wheel has changed the world in an incredible way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us has been to provide us with a means of transportation that is more comfortable and faster.
It brought the train, the automobile, and many other means of transportation.
Among the trees, there are feline creatures of medium size that eat prey of medium size such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including house cats) that eat many smaller animals as food, such as lizards, snakes, rodents, and birds.
The secret to its success is the niche concept, a special place that every feline has and that keeps it away from competition with others.
Lions are the most social felines, and they live in large groups called prides.
Branches are made up of one to three related adult males and up to thirty females and young.
Women are usually closely related to each other; it's a large family of sisters and daughters.
The packs of lions are somewhat like packs of wolves or dogs, animals incredibly similar to lions (but not to other felines) in behavior, and equally deadly to their prey.
A complete athlete, the tiger can climb (even if not very well), leap, make great jumps, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is of the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four felines are the only ones that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like that of a powerful lion, but more like a string of ugly, twisted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can catch them, they eat weasels, rabbits, squirrels, and birds. Almost all the animals that the ocelot hunts are smaller than it.
I'm sure you're thinking the ocelot follows and finds animals to eat (prey) by scent, sensing where it has been on the ground.
I can see quite well in the dark with night vision, and they also move in silence. The ocelot hunts its prey by camouflaging itself with the environment and then jumping on it.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) is separated from the main population from where it came (as if they moved beyond a mountain or a river, or moved to a new island in such a way that they are no longer able to easily return), they will often find themselves in an environment different from the one where they were before.
This new environment has so many resources and so much competition, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a strong competitor compared to what served them before.
The original afternoon hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adjustments as before.
While the new population tries to adapt to the new environment, they increasingly resemble another population.
Finally, after countless and countless years, the populations will be so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
Let's call this process speciation, which practically means the formation of a new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants make oxygen that people breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that people exhale (or, breathe out).
Plants get nourished by the sun through photosynthesis. And they also make shade.
We build our houses and clothes with plants, and much of what we eat is plants. Animals cannot live without plants.
The mosasaur was the strongest predator of its time, and feared nothing except other mosasaurs.
In his mouth he had more than 70 teeth, honed like daggers, and in a flash they were on the palate; there was no escape for anyone who was caught.
We're not sure, but he might have been a double-tongued one. He ate turtles, fish, other prehistoric creatures, and perhaps he was even a cannibal.
The sea swallowed everything that entered the water; even a beast like a T-Rex would have met a nasty end.
Even though many of their food items might seem normal, the Romani had a few strange or unusual things like wild boar, pheasant, limes, and a kind of drink called ghiro.
Another difference arises in that while the poor and women work and carry their burdens, the lords held banquets, reclining on their sides while they ate.
The food eaten by the ancient Romans could not compare to the food that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in the centuries afterward.
For example, they didn't have gooseberries, tomatoes, potatoes, or coconut, and no ancient Roman ever ate the *tachìn*.
The Babylonians, for all their deities, built a primary temple which was the house of the god.
The people brought sacrifices to the gods, and the priests tried to appease the gods with ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had a green courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priest could enter.
Occasionally, special towers in the shape of pyramids, called ziggurats, used to be built as part of the temples.
The top of the tower gives rise to the sanctuary of the god.
In the mild climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
Much of a Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
The women were preparing food in the courtyard; the shops were only stalls along the street. The houses were made of stone.
There wasn't much foreign timber in the land of Canaan, so the wood is expensive.
In Greenland, few people lived. There are Norwegian legends about Erik the Red, who was banished from Iceland for killing someone, and traveling west, he found Greenland and named it Greenland.
But even though they had made their discovery, there were already Inuit tribes living there at that time.
Even though every country was 'Scandinavian', there were many differences between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you watch the movie National Treasure, you might think there's a treasure map written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
But no, that's not true. Even if there's something written on the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the front of the Declaration of Independence were written the words "Declaration of Independence Original of July 4, 1776." These words are visible at the bottom of the document, upside down.
Even though no one knows who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning this large document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up so as to be put away.
Therefore, it's likely that this note was added like a label.
The D-Day landings and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south was not yet free.
It was governed by the Vichy France. These were French people who had made peace with the Germans in 1940 and worked for the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allies had invaded southern France; the invasion was called "Operation Dragon."
In just seven weeks, the Americans and perhaps the liberated France were freeing southern France and were on their way towards Germany.
A civilization is a single culture shared among a nice group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "civilization" comes from the Latin "civilis," which means citizen, in relation to the Latin "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, and which in some way defines the greatness of society.
The city-states are ancestors of nations. A culture of civilization means to transmit knowledge through the various generations, a cultural imprint that lasts and a just diffusion.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving significant historical traces and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the War of the Revolution, the thirteen states at the beginning had formed a weak central government, with the Congress as its only component, under the Articles of the Confederation.
The Congress did not have the power to demand taxes, and since there was no executive or national magistracy, to ensure all its laws were respected, it relied on the authorities of the state, which often did not cooperate.
No one had the authority to enact fiscal laws and tariffs between the states.
The Articles require unanimous consent of all states before being amended, and the states seized the central government with such carelessness that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national team is with the Czech national team the second team that has won the most at the world and has won the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports are football, basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and Formula One races.
Winter sports were famous, especially in the northern regions, with Italians participating in international competitions and the Olympics.
Japan has almost 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest), making Japan the seventh-largest island country in the world.
Because of the groups of islands it has, Japan is often called, from a geographical point of view, an "archipelago".
The beginnings of Taiwan date back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by called the island Formosa Island or the most beautiful island.
In 1624, the East India Company established a base in the southeastern part of Taiwan, beginning to change the indigenous practices of grain production and employing Chinese laborers in rice paddies and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) perhaps took control of the western and northern parts of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, after the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, with which it ceded control of Taiwan to Japan, which governed the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu was made up of three main structures called Inti Watana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of the Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt so that tourists can get a better idea of what they used to be like.
In 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu was restored, and the restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic film format in the world is 35mm, which was the standard film format par excellence at the end of the analog film era.
Even so, the most important thing is that its aspect ratio has been inherited from the image sensor formats of digital cameras.
The 35mm format is actually, somewhat confusingly, 36mm wide and 24mm tall.
The aspect ratio of this format (dividing by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio with an integer) is consequently said to be 3:2.
Many common legal entities (for example, the group of APS entities) are equal or very similar in terms of their appearance/structure.
The often abused and criticized rule of thirds is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining a sense of order within an image.
She says that the best place for the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the image into vertical and horizontal thirds (see the example).
During this period in European history, the Holy Roman Empire, which had become rich and powerful, was under scrutiny.
For more than many years, the Christian faith has kept European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
His power reaches everyone, from kings to beggars.
One of the main doctrines of Christians is that abundance should be used to alleviate suffering and misery, and that the treasures of the Church are there for this purpose.
The center of control of the church has been in Rome for more than a hundred years, and all this power and these keys have led many to ask if the doctrine had been respected.
Shortly after the beginning of hostilities, the English launched a naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy has succeeded, cutting off essential civil and military supplies, even if this blockade is a violation of an internationally accepted and codified law in numerous international agreements from the two centuries prior.
Great Britain has deployed naval mines in international waters to block entire sections of the ocean to all ships, causing damage even to neutral vessels.
Since there was little to do against this tactic, Germany was expected to give a response similar to its unlimited submarine war.
During the 1920s, the attitude of almost all citizens and countries was one of pacifism and isolation.
After having seen the horrors and atrocities of the First World War, the nations wanted to avoid something similar in the future.
In 1884, Tesla went to the United States to work with Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the United States without luggage, with a book of poetry and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his first employer) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of displaying the various periods of the year: today, each phase of China or every family that was in command was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there was a rather turbulent period with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was that of the Three Kingdoms, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, there were terrible wars between the various nobles who were fighting for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China; thousands of people died fighting to sit in the highest position in the grand palace of Xi'an.
Venice has many social and political effects, such as the adoption of the decimal metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the conviction that the country belongs to the people and not to a single sovereign.
Even after the Revolution and occupation, things turned in favor of all candidates, allowing the most ambitious to achieve success.
The same is true for the militias, because instead of classifying the army based on class, it was based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers in other countries to begin their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond this worldly life. He frequented a cave that became famous as "Hira'," his mountain of "Light" for contemplation.
The same grotto, surviving the times, offers a very vivid image of the spiritual inclinations of Muhammad.
The lodge is at the top of one of the mountains north of Mecca, the cave is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Indeed, it's not at all easy to find it even though one knew it existed. Once inside the cave, there is total isolation.
One can see nothing but the clear and most beautiful sky above and the many mountains around. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from within the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the seven wonders that still exists today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid was one of many large pyramidal structures built to honor the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Kings of Egypt, has many pyramids (with the Great Pyramid being the most imposing), several small tombs, various temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The great pyramid was built to honor the Pharaoh Cheops, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor the wives and family members of Cheops.
The mark "arch upwards" looks like a V, and the mark "arch downwards" looks like a bracket or a square without the bottom side.
That means you should take the bow from the foot and pull back the arc, and that already means you should take the bow from the grip (where your hand holds the arc) and draw the bow.
A higher bow usually produces a softer sound, while a lower bow usually produces a louder and more decisive sound.
Feel free to write your pencil marks, but remember that the bowing marks are there for a musical reason, so they should usually be respected.
The royal family – King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, and their two young sons (Maria Teresa at 11 years old and Louis-Charles at four years old), as well as the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth – were forced to return to Paris by a crowd of women from the market on October 6, 1789, in Versailles.
I have returned to Paris in a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people who shouted and made threats against the king and queen.
The crowd of people forced the king and queen to keep the carriage windows wide open.
At one point, someone from the crowd showed the head of a royal guard beheaded at Versailles to the terrified queen.
The costs of US imperialism's conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
I was forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover the majority of its expenses and interest on its debts, converted in the name of the Philippine government through the banks of Wall Street.
Naturally, the superprofits derive from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people, which constituted the fundamental achievements of United States imperialism.
To understand the Templars, one must understand the context that incentivized the creation of the order.
The period in which these events took place is commonly referred to as the High Middle Ages, a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The middle phase of the Middle Ages came after the early Middle Ages and was followed by the Late Middle Ages, which conventionally ended around 1500.
Technological determinism has so many ideas, from technological drive or technological imperative to the narrow sense that human destiny is guided by a basic logic along with scientific laws and their manifestation in technology itself.
Many interpretations of technological determinism share two ideas: the development of technology itself follows a path that is independent of cultural or political influence, and conversely, technology has "effects" on society that are inherent rather than socially conditioning.
For example, one could say that the car engine provides power for the development of roads.
However, a network of national roads isn't economically vital solely for a few cars, so there are new methods of production being developed to lower the cost of owning a car.
Having so many machines also leads to many accidents on its roads, and this leads to the invention of new medical techniques to heal injured bodies.
Romanticism possessed a great element of cultural determinism, as treated by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and cultures linked to that geography emerged. These, being in harmony with society, proved better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Even now, Paris is known for being the center of fashion; Constantinople was the center of fashion for feudal Europe.
Xé was known to have been the center of luxury from the 1400s to the 1700s.
It is greatly esteemed in the twelfth century, especially because the Crusaders returned with riches and goods that were valued more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It's in this period that the title of Capital of Luxury passed from Constantinople to Paris.
The Gothic style had its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
At the beginning, the wardrobe was strongly influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow communication channels, Western styles would likely remain 25-30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the greatest developments of the era was that, following the Crusades, people began to use buttons on their clothes.
Subsistence farming is agriculture aimed at producing enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence agriculture is a simple, often biological system that uses preserved native seeds from the combined ecoregion along with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, the majority of farmers have been engaged in subsistence farming, and this is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together individuals who have similar thoughts, who feel neglected by social standards, and it allows them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished according to age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or the gender of the members.
The qualities that determine a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or generated by a specific combination of factors.
Members of an subculture often signal their belonging through a distinctive and symbolic use of style that includes fashion, mannerisms, and speech.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialisation is to look at the few unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, neglect, or voluntary abuse, were not followed from a social perspective by adults during their upbringing.
These strays were called "wild dogs." Some of them were placed within boundaries by people (usually their parents); in some cases, the abandonment of the dog was due to the parents' refusal of a serious intellectual or physical disability of the stray.
The young children of the forest have likely suffered serious abuse or trauma before being abandoned or before being rescued.
If one thinks that others have risen from animals; it is said that some lived in a wild state.
When a child is raised completely by non-human animals, the child displays behaviors (within physical limits) almost entirely similar to those of the animal that raised them, such as their fear or indifference towards humans.
While learning based on projects should make learning more effective and more interesting, scaffolding goes one step further.
What is defined as a framework is not a learning method, but rather an aid that provides support to people who are facing a new learning experience, such as the use of new computer software or the start of a new project.
Scaffolding, which we call "ste intełaiadure," can be both virtual and real. In other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is the little clip figure in Microsoft Office.
I have created virtual elements within the software, and they aim to discuss, suggest, and explain procedures that could be difficult for a single student to manage.
Juveniles are placed in foster care for a wide variety of reasons, ranging from abandonment and abuse to extortion.
No young person should ever grow up in an environment that isn't supportive, caring, and educational, but it happens.
We believe that the foster care system is a safeguard for these children.
Our care system should provide safe homes, caring assistants, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
The trust should provide everything necessary that is lacking in the house from which the wells were previously taken.
The internet unites elements of both interpersonal and mass communication.
And distinctive characteristics of the Internet have already brought other dimensions of uses and access to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are suggested as important motivations for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
"User engagement" and "continuous relationships" are identified as motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated user reactions to websites.
The use of video recording has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of microexpressions and facial movements that last only a few milliseconds.
In particular, it is claimed that it is possible to understand if a person is lying by correctly interpreting their microexpressions.
Oliver Sacks, in his article "The President's Speech," pointed out that people who are unable to understand spoken language due to brain damage are still able to accurately assess someone's sincerity.
He strongly suggested that these abilities in interpreting human behavior could be shared by animals like dogs.
Research of the 20th century has shown that there exist two pools of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
The mutation triggers a new genetic variation, and the session is cleared from the pool of expressed variation.
Segregation and recombination cause back and forth variation between the two pools with each generation.
The savanna is difficult for a primate with a digestive system like that of humans to satisfy its need for essential amino acids by relying on available plant resources.
Furthermore, the impossibility of doing so has serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The plant-based resources most easily accessible would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but for primates like us, they are difficult to digest unless they are cooked.
On the contrary, animal-derived foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
All in all, we shouldn't be surprised if our own ancestors solved their "protein problem" in a somewhat similar way to how chimpanzees of the savanna do.
The interruption of sleep is the process of intentional awakening during the normal time frame of sleep and falling asleep shortly after (10-60 minutes).
This could be done easily by using a relatively gentle awakening to bring you back to a conscious state without waking you completely.
If you happen to reposition your glasses while you're sleeping, they might be in another part of the room, forcing you to get out of bed to find them.
Other options based solely on biorhythm involve consuming plenty of liquids (particularly water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before going to sleep, forcing one to get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace that characterizes a person is related to the amount of tension present in the body and in the spirit.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital force present. Every person has the potential to find absolute peace and fulfillment.
Everyone needs to arrive at enlightenment. The only thing hindering this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has spread through the Mahayana path of love and through many typical Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of universal love.
Through Yoga Kundalini, the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination) is awakened through the postures of yoga itself, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the Divinity of Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities and energy channels, purification occurs, the chakras are activated, and the consciousness of illumination takes form.
Germany became a common enemy in the Second World War, leading the USSR and the United States to collaborate. At the end of the war, the clashes of systems, processes, and culture caused the decline of nations.
Two years had passed since the end of the war, the former allies were now enemies, and the Cold War had begun like that.
It would continue for the next 40 years and it would truly be fought by the invading armies and its battlefields would range from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the Polish defense was already collapsing, and the only hope remaining was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian front.
However, these plans had already become outdated long before 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics made advances on the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts after invading the eastern regions of Poland, thus violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international bilateral and multilateral treaties.
To use ships for transporting goods is a very long way, the most efficient way to move large quantities of people and goods across the oceans.
The task of the navy has traditionally been to ensure that the nation maintained the ability to move its people and goods, while at the same time interfering with the enemy's ability to move its people and goods.
One of the most recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign of World War II. The Americans were trying to move men and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to help Great Britain.
At the same time, the navy was bustling, which mainly used U-boats, trying to stop this traffic.
If the Allies hadn't had that success, Germany would probably have been able to conquer England as it had done with the rest of Europe.
It is said that dogs were domesticated for the first time about 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains in Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes used to keep them through milk, wool, meat, and hides.
Domestic animals were usually kept in herds that roamed the hills or other grazing areas, often supervised by shepherds who were often rough and gruff, similar to the most well-known shepherds. These methods of herding are still used today.
The wagons were already built in England in the 16th century.
Even though the carts were only made of wooden planks placed one against the other, they allowed the horses that pulled them to go faster and to haul heavier loads compared to the completely dilapidated roads of the time.
The three workers were almost immediately put to work to keep the tracks in position. However, after a while it became clear that the tracks would be better with a layer of iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but the iron wears away and gnaws at the wood of the wagons.
Finally, the wooden wheel was changed to an iron wheel. In 1767, the first all-iron railway had been built.
The first means of transport were on foot. Humans started walking on foot two million years ago when Homo Erectus emerged (which means man upright).
Those that existed before, the Australopithecus, usually did not walk upright.
The characteristic bipedalism was found in the fossils of Australopithecus from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, even though Sahelanthropus may have already walked on two legs 7 million years ago.
We can try to live better together with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can also become more active in trying to alleviate future suffering in some way.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, now we need to find the cause of the problems and solve them.
It's quite obvious that the world has changed a lot due to the scientific and technological progress of humanity, and the problems have become even greater because of overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyle of humanity.
After the reading by the Congress on July 4th, a handwritten copy signed by President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent a short distance to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, they made between 150 and 200 copies of those known as "Dunlap flyers".
The first public reading of the document was done by John Nixon on the courtyard of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
A ship is being sent to George Washington on June 6th, so he can see it displayed to his soldiers in New York on June 9th. A copy was finished in London on August 10th.
I have 25 Dunlap flyers that are known to be the oldest copies of this document. The original handwritten copy has not survived.
Many paleontologists still believe a group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
So many people don't think we are dinosaurs because we have feathers and can fly.
But there are so many bird-like things that still resemble dinosaurs.
I am covered in scales and spines, I lay eggs, and I walk on my spines like a T-Rex.
Practically all computers of yours are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number has only one of two values, for example 0 or 1, and these numbers are indicated with binary digits, or bits, using computer jargon.
Internal poisoning doesn't have to be immediately visible. Symptoms like vomiting are generally common enough to prevent an immediate diagnosis.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be the presence of an open medicine box or toxic chemical products in the house.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
A particular term is used by entomologists to describe this group of insects.
It derives from an ancient familiarity with the Semitic roots of the plagues that insects adapted to infest humans.
And the linens and the bedding are indeed delivered, given to live in the host's or guest's own home.
In all of the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), which is the most common neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
SM is a malady that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Researchers have seen that women have double the possibility of seeing the Virgin Mary compared to men.
A couple may decide that having a child is not in their interest, or in the interest of the young man/woman.
These couples could decide to try adopting a child.
The exercise of natural parental rights thus ends so that another couple can become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works using the scientific method. This method, in fact, guides almost all scientific discoveries.
However, it's not just experimentation; and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Also, asking questions and making observations guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers were concentrated on classical texts and, in particular, his Bible in Latin.
It is said that Aristotle's ideas on all matters of science, including psychology, are sour.
At one point, the knowledge of Greek fell into decline, and the West found itself cut off from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms are observed in physiology and behavior, depending crucially on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological rhythms.
Periodic rhythms, which are not simply responses to external periodic triggers, have been documented in a wide range of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
I realized that biological oscillators are self-sufficient and will send forward a period of free cycle even without external triggers.
Hershey and Chase's experiment was one of the main pieces of evidence that DNA is made of genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used some beans, or viruses, to introduce their own DNA into a bacterium.
I have done two experiments labeling the phage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have many different effects depending on the type of mutation. The importance of the genetic material's location affected germline cells and cells that were affected.
Only mutations in the germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while mutations in other parts can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism, by its nature, pleases people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including the fauna and flora.
Examples of activities to do on site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and studying information about the ecosystem.
A good example is to visit, photograph, and get to know the orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave in cars from the countryside villages to go to work and pass by others who are going to work where they have just left.
In this transportation system, everyone is in some way connected and supports a transportation system based on private cars.
The science says that this massive carbon economy has shifted the biosphere from one of its stable states that supported human evolution in the last two million years.
Everyone participates in the company and uses the means of transport. Almost everyone complains about the means of transport.
In these towns, it's rare to hear complaints similar to the quality of the water or about collapsing bridges.
Why do these means of transport bring out so many complaints, why do they have problems every day? Don't the transport engineers understand anything? Or is there something more fundamental happening?
The flow of traffic is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they have with each other.
Unfortunately, studying the flow of traffic is difficult because the behavior of drivers cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, whoever is driving tends to fit within a reasonably consistent limit; thus, the traffic flows tend to show a reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent the flow of traffic, relations have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) velocity.
You are connected to a network that helps to plan, design, and in the operation of road structures.
The vultures were the first animals to fly. Their ability to fly helped them escape enemies more easily and find food and companions more efficiently.
Many insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings against their body.
This gives it the ability to hide from predators in many small places.
Even so, the only things that cannot be bent are the nest and the ephemeral.
Many years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System moved around the Sun.
Some people thought that was right, but others thought the opposite, that the Solar System moved around the Earth, including the Sun (and other stars too).
This seems like a sensible thing, because it doesn't seem like things are changing down there, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. It has more than 8 times the water of the second longest river.
The Amazon River is also the widest river, being as wide as two miles in certain points.
A good 20 percent of the water from the rivers that ends up in the oceans of the planet comes from the Amazon River.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of stone pyramids continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in size or in the excellence of their construction.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their predecessors, which at the time had far more years than me.
The population of the City of Vatican is about 800 people. It is the smallest independent country in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses Italian in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the common language of use for almost all those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All the citizens of the City of Vatican are Roman Catholics.
People have known the basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since antiquity, because these could be found in nature in their authentic form and were relatively easy to extract with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a combination of one or more of the four elements. These were earth, water, air, and fire.
This gives rise to, much like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, even though it has also theorized that they change into new substances to form what we see.
And alloys are in practice a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Obviously, there are also metals like gold and silver.
Pol also has layers containing a small amount of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so small that billions of these could fit into the space at the end of this sentence.
Thus, the pencil was a good friend to many people when it came out.
Unfortunately, with the arrival of newer writing methods, the pencil has become obsolete and is used much less.
People now send messages on computer screens; they don't need a pencil.
One can wonder what will become of the keyboard once something new comes out.
The atomic bomb works in principle because it requires energy to bring together a nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
It's like trying to push a heavy cart up a hill. The fission of the nucleus releases a part of that energy.
Certain atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to break apart with little or no push.
The surface of the moon is made of rock and dust. The outer layer of the moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
It is thinner under the seas and thicker under the high plains.
Could you possibly be near the sea on the more sheltered side because the crust is thinner? It was easier for the lava to come out onto the surface.
Theories of content are centered on his research of what makes people angry or what they like.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they have become adults.
These theories look at what there is in certain people that makes them desire the things they do and which things in their environment make them do or not do certain things.
Some famous content theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when a manager starts to help their former colleagues. One extreme is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or "a mate").
This type of management has difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
On the other side of the spectrum, he transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels that he has to change everything the team has done and make it his own.
After all, the coach is ultimately responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of behavior often leads to disagreements between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtuous teams have to meet the same standards of excellence as regular teams, but there are subtle differences.
Members of virtuous teams often serve as a point of contact for their immediate physical group.
Often, they have more autonomy than the members of a normal team because their teams can be located in different time zones that may not be understood by the local administration.
The presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109) is a unique component of a virtual team.
The "invisible team" is the administration team to which each member reports. The invisible team sets standards for each member.
Why should an organization have to go through a process that takes time to establish an organizational learning process? Innovation is a goal to put into practice the concepts of organizational learning.
When all available resources are used well across the functional departments of an organization, creativity and ingenuity can be seen.
Consequently, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a new innovative process to serve the client's needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, the leadership must create a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) stated that the Continuum approach is a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
The neurological data provide physical proof of a theoretical strategy for investigating their knowledge. Consequently, it narrows the area of investigation and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between the pathology of the service and behavior supports the findings in this research.
It has been known for a long time that various types of damage to the nervous system, trauma, injuries, and tumors have an effect on behavior and cause changes in certain mental functions.
The new technologies allow us to see and investigate structures and processes of the sea never seen before.
This gives many information and material to make models of simulations that helps us understand the processes of our mind.
Even if Artificial Intelligence has some fantasy, it is a very important part of computer science, and it deals with intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation within a machine.
The study of AI concerns the creation of machines to automate activities that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include check-ups, planning and programming, the ability to respond to diagnoses and customer questions, and also recognizing handwriting, voice, and facial features.
These things have become distinct disciplines, centered on finding solutions to problems of real life.
The artificial intelligence system is still often used in economics, medicine, engineering, and in the military field, given that it has been installed in many home computers and video game applications.
Field trips are a very important thing for every class. Many times, the teacher would like to take their students to places where it's not possible to go by bus.
Technology gives us a solution with virtual tours. Students can view the works of a museum, visit an aquarium, or see art displayed in the classroom.
Sharing a trip virtually is also a nice way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of Bennett School in North Carolina create a website about their trip to the state capital, and every year the website is redone, but the old versions are kept online like an album of memorabilia.
Blogs can help students write better. While students often share their experiences with blogs with grammatical errors and poorly written words, the presence of an audience usually changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, whoever writes on the blog strives to write better and avoid criticism.
To better encourage students to become more knowledgeable about the world around them, the need to feed public interest inspires students to be more skilled and interesting (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend learning far beyond the normal school day.
A small group of blogs is used to encourage students to become more analytical and critical; with active responses to internet materials, students can define their positions within the context of what others write, in addition to describing their personal perspectives on particular issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a beautiful and bilingual capital of Canada and has many art galleries and museums that showcase the past and present of Canada.
Further south there are Niagara Falls, and to the north there is the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these things even more make Ontario appear as the quintessence of Canada to those who come from abroad.
Many more areas further north are populated, and some are almost entirely natural, uninhabited areas.
A comparison of populations that surprises many: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of eastern Africa are in the Indian Ocean off the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest, and as far as wild nature is concerned, it is a continent in itself.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations, or associated with France, and known for being luxury beach resorts.
The Arabs also brought their lands and Islam, which happened especially on the Comoros and Mayotte.
Influenza and European colonialism met in the 15th century, with the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovering the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, the region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it's better than all the women who travel say they are married, it doesn't matter if it's true or not.
It's better to bring a ring too (as long as it doesn't look like something from a pawn shop).
Women need to understand that cultural differences might be what they perceive as annoyances, and it's not unusual to be followed, touched, grabbed on the arm, etc.
You must be decisive in saying no to men, and don't be afraid to assert your reasons (cultural differences or not, it's not right!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used as a strategic port, called Anfa, by Phoenicians, Romans, and Marinids.
The Portuguese built and rebuilt it, calling it Casa Branca, before abandoning it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya, and the name Casablanca was given to it by the Spanish smugglers who had established a smuggling base here.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places in Morocco to go shopping.
Around the old Medina, you can find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods like tagines, ceramics, leather items, hookahs, and a whole series of trinkets, but it's all stuff for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, at the far east bordering Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by the Nyiragongo volcano, which burned most of the city's streets, particularly in the center.
While Goma is reasonably safe, every other trip to Goma must be prepared in a way to understand the state of the fighting that persists in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base to climb Mount Nyiragongo, and some of the gorilla tracking expeditions in Africa are not cheap.
I'll arrange a water taxi (mototaxi) to go around Giudecca. The price is normally (local) around 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Along with the fact that it's relatively difficult to reach, "Timbuktu" has become even more of a metaphor for exotic and distant places.
Even so, Timbuktu is a poor city, even though its fame makes it a tourist destination, and it has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
It was one of the main episodes of Henry Louis Gates' special PBS series Wonders of the African World.
The city is in strong contrast with other cities in the country, because it has a more Arab than African charm.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is in the northeast of South Africa along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the river of crocodiles.
The park has an area of 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wild animals.
It is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is considered the symbol of the South African National Parks (SANParks).
In all the National Parks of South Africa, there are daily entrance and conservation fees to the park.
It might be a good idea to buy a Wild Card, which allows you to enter a selection of parks in South Africa or all the National Parks of South Africa.
The island of Hong Kong gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is the place that tourists visit the most.
The series of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong has been compared to a glowing bar graph, recognizable by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the most beautiful views of Hong Kong, go to the island and go to Kowloon on the waterfront on the other side.
A large part of the urban development of the island of Hong Kong is built on reclaimed land on the north shore.
This is the place the British colonizers used to work, and therefore if you want to see something of the colonial past of the territory, this is a nice place to start.
The Sundarbans is the largest mangrove coastal area in the world, extending for 80 kilometers (50 miles) in the territory of Bangladesh and India along the coast.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest area in Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forests, however, are not only mangrove swamps – they also have what remains of the great jungles that once covered the Ganges plain.
I'm going to the Sundarbans, an area of 3850 km² of which a third is water/swamp.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans have been a nature reserve, and an estimate says that there are now 400 Bengal tigers and 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the interdistrict bus station (on the other side of the river) throughout the day, although most, particularly those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since the inter-district buses are often full, it's better to buy the ticket a few days in advance.
Many districts are served by small Japanese Coaster Buses, which are comfortable and durable.
Shared taxis are a fast and convenient means of transport for going to nearby places, like Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock is a remarkable bridge. It crosses the Oyapock River to connect the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
The bell towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The airlock under the bridge is 15 meters long. The construction was completed in August 2011, and it didn't open to traffic until March 2017.
The bridge has been operational since September 2017, and the customs checkpoints of the Brazilian customs have been completed.
I guarantee that the Guarani were the most significant ethnic group inhabiting Eastern Paraguay, and they lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The region of the Chaco is the home of other groups of indigenous tribes, the Guaycurú and the Payaguá, who survive hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, formerly called "the gigantic province of the Indies," emerged as the result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and native indigenous groups.
The Spaniards ended the colonization period which lasted for three centuries.
Assunción was founded in 1537, and Paraguay has managed to maintain much of its indigenous character and identity.
Argentina is well known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Cañitas.
They play tournaments more and games also in other parts of the year.
If you want to find out about tournaments and where to buy tickets for polo matches, check out the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), whose value is fixed as equivalent to that of the British Pound (GBP).
I go to deposit/withdraw money; it's the only bank on the islands that's at Stanley in front of the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted throughout the islands, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the outer islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although British and American currencies might be readily accepted; check with the relevant party in advance to see what payment method is acceptable.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the islands, so exchange money beforehand before you leave.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropics; temperatures above 30 degrees Celsius are common in the summer months.
Winter is depressingly cool; the temperatures rarely go below zero, but the wind and humidity combine to make it seem colder than the thermometer indicates.
There aren't particularly "rainy" and "dry" seasons; the amount of rain remains roughly the same throughout the year.
Even though many of the park's mammals are used to seeing humans, wildlife is nonetheless wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park authorities, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves and 25 meters from any other wild animal!
No matter how docile the beasts may be, the bison, the deer, and the hare, the bears, and any other large animal can attack.
Every year, the number of visitors decreases because they don't keep a proper distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so respect their space.
Be aware that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep your base camp clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has a population of 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia was founded around 1850 and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
The port was the site of a notorious standoff in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and the United Kingdom refused to enter the port.
All the ships have been sunk by a British transatlantic ship. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the struggle for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city resulted in the murder of the great leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are so many beaches because Auckland is between two harbors. The most famous ones are in three areas.
The beaches of North Shore (North Harbour district) face the Pacific Ocean and run from Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy, with a bit of shade thanks to the pohutukawa trees.
E spiagge di Tamaki Drive are on the port of Waitemata, in the residential areas of Mission Bay and St Heliers in central Auckland.
It's often crowded with people and many shops, but the lagoon is safe.
The main local beer is "Number One," it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to try, but the New Zealand and Australian ones might be better.
The tap water is perfectly drinkable, but the bottled water is easier to choose if you don't trust it.
Even Australians, the idea of a "flat white" coffee is foreign. A short black coffee is an "espresso," a cappuccino comes filled to the top with foam (not froth), and tea is served without milk.
The hot chocolate is Belgian quality. The fruit juices are expensive, but they are excellent.
Many trips to the coral reef are made during the whole year, and accidents due to activities on the reef are rare.
Follow nonetheless what the authorities have said, obey the signs, and pay attention to the safety signals.
Jellyfish were seen near the coast and estuaries of rivers from October to April north of 1770. Sometimes they can be found outside of these periods.
Sharks exist, but they rarely attack humans. A large part of sharks are afraid of humans and avoid them.
Crocodiles in freshwater do not live actively in the ocean; their primary habitat is the estuaries of rivers north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance gives the traveler the security and peace of mind that there will be a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, even if you can book other places to sleep, like campsites, always through a travel agency.
Travel agencies often offer packages that include breakfast, airport transfer options, or combined flight and hotel packages.
I'll wait for you while you consider the reservation or obtain the documents for your arrival (for example, a visa) if you need more time.
Any modification or request must first go through the agent and not directly with the hotel.
For many festivals, the majority of participants at music festivals decide to camp on site, and most of them consider this an integral part of the experience.
If you want to be able to see the action, you need to enter early to get a good spot near the stage.
Remember that even if the music on the main stage ends, you can still enjoy parts of the festival where it plays late into the night.
Certain festivals have special camping areas for families who want them.
If you cross the North Baltic Sea in winter, check where the cabin is, because crossing the ice causes an awful noise for everyone involved.
The cruises to San Pieroburgo include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from the visa requirement (check the regulations).
The casino spends a lot of effort to maximize the time and money spent by customers. The windows and clocks are conspicuously absent, and the exits can be difficult to find.
They usually offer special deals on food, drinks, and entertainment to keep customers in good spirits and continue making them spend money.
Certain establishments offer free alcoholic beverages. In any case, getting drunk impairs judgment, and skilled gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who wishes to travel to high latitudes or beyond the mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or sub-zero temperatures.
On the streets, which are wet and slippery, the grip is low and you can't drive as if you were on asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall to block you up in a short amount of time.
Visibility can also be restricted by falling snow, condensation, or frost on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, snow and ice conditions are normal in many countries, and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the most important tourist attraction in Africa and makes a strong impression on many visitors.
The term "safari" in its popular use refers to a trip to land to observe the incredible African wildlife, particularly in the savanna.
Certain animals, like elephants and giraffes, tend to approach the machines and standard equipment, which allows for a good view.
Sometimes the lions, cheetahs, and leopards are timid, and you'll see them better with binoculars.
A walking safari (also called "bush walk," "hiking safari," or "footing") consists of a walk, for a few hours or for several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. These events will take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, having hosted the Olympics in 1964.
If I had booked your flight and accommodation for 2020 before the announcement of the postponement, we would be in a complicated situation.
The rules regarding cancellations vary, but cancellation policies do not extend until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
If you expect that most of the events will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, with the typical ticket being sold for 7,000 yen.
Iron my clothes now and hang them up to dry. Many hotels have an iron and an ironing board available for loan, even if one isn't in the room.
If a fierce one isn't available, or if you don't want to bother pulling up your ironed socks, you can use a sugacavei, if it's available.
Be careful not to make the fabric too hot (which could make it go faster or, in extreme cases, burn it).
There are several ways to purify water, some more effective against certain types of contaminants.
In some areas, the water is enough for a minute, in others it takes several minutes.
The filters vary in effectiveness, and if you should have a problem, you could consider the fact of buying water in a sealed bottle from a reputable company.
The travelers, those parasitic beggars they weren't accustomed to in their place of origin.
Harmful animals can cause damage by biting, causing irritation, or in the worst cases triggering allergic reactions, spreading poison, or transmitting infection.
The small, fierce creatures that harm or kill people with their usual strength are not typically qualified as harmful animals.
Shopping duty-free represents the opportunity to buy tax-exempt goods and it can be done in certain specific places.
Travelers coming from countries with higher taxes sometimes like to spend a good amount of money on coins, especially for alcoholic beverages or tobacco products.
The agreement between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, which frequently passes through isolated rural areas.
If you don't get used to driving on country roads, be careful: important bends, narrow lanes, and sharp curves predominate.
Speed limits are marked and are sufficiently lower than in previous and subsequent sessions - commonly 35-40 miles per hour (56-64 km/h) - and obedience to these limits is even more important than in other circumstances.
Curiously, however, the phone signal is much stronger here than in other parts of the itinerary, like in the Pennsylvania Wilds.
German bakeries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are truly rich and varied, similar to those of their southern neighbor, Austria.
Small fruits like apples are common, with ripe apples present in the orchard all year round, and the cherries and plums that come out in summer.
They sent many German dishes from the oven: almonds, walnuts, and other nuts. Traditional cakes are often served well with a strong coffee.
If you feel like some rich little pastries, try the one that is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen depending on the place.
A curry is a dish made with herbs and spices, along with meat or vegetables.
A curry can be "dry" or "saucy" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of India and Pakistan, yogurt is commonly used in curries; in southern India and other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is commonly used.
With 17,000 islands to choose from, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide variety of regional cuisines found throughout the country.
But, if used without other adjectives, the term tends to mean the original food from the central and eastern part of the main island of Java.
Widely available throughout the archipelago, the Javanese cuisine presents a spectrum of simple, aromatic dishes, with the main aromas that the Javanese love being shallots, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar) and various aromatic spices.
The staff is supported by the feet of the knight who hangs low on both sides of the saddle.
It would provide more stability to the knight, but it could present safety problems due to the potential for a knight to get trapped.
If a knight has thrown him from a horse but he has a foot caught in the stirrup, he could be dragged away if the horse starts to run. To minimize this risk, a series of safety precautions must be taken.
As for the usual thing, most knights wore riding boots with a heel and a single, smooth, and fairly narrow sole.
Furthermore, certain saddles, particularly the English saddles, have safety bars to prevent the rider from falling off if the saddle is pulled back by a falling knight.
The valley of Cochamó - the first Chilean destination for climbing, known as the Yosemite of South America, with a great variety of granite walls and cliffs.
The ascents include views enjoyed by the small ones. Climbers from all parts of the world are continuously establishing new routes through their potential of infinite walls.
I enjoy winter sports, which include skiing and snowboarding. They are popular sports that involve gliding down snow-covered slopes on skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing is an activity that attracts many enthusiastic travelers, sometimes called "ski fanatics," who plan entire vacations to ski in a specific location.
The concept of skiing is so old – the cave paintings that depict skiers go back to 5,000 B.C.!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back at least to the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was founded by Norwegians in Australia.
Ski touring: this activity is also called ski mountaineering, ski alpinism or ski excursionism.
She is related, but usually doesn't include ski mountaineering or alpine skiing, seeing as these last two activities are done on steep terrain and require much stiffer skis and boots.
Think of a ski route as similar to a hiking route.
In good condition, I can walk faster than walking – but I will rarely reach the speed of cross-country skiing without a heavy backpack on beaten tracks.
Europe is a relatively small continent but with many independent countries. In normal circumstances, traveling through several countries would imply having to send many visa requests and having your passport checked in many situations.
The Schengen area, however, in this regard acts as a single country.
As long as you stay in this area, you can generally cross borders without having your passport checked.
In the same way, having a Schengen visa, you don't have to apply for a visa to visit each Schengen member state separately, thus saving time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition of handcrafted goods that can be defined as antiques. Certain tax agencies define goods older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographical variations, with the age limit potentially being lower in places like North America compared to Europe.
The products made by hand could be defined as antiques even if they are just as young as products made in mass from similar items.
Reindeer herding is an important means of livelihood for the Sami people, and the culture surrounding the trade is also important for other types of professions.
Traditionally, however, not all the Sami were involved in large-scale reindeer herding; they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, keeping the reindeer primarily as beasts of burden.
These days, many modern trades exist. Tourism provides an important income to Sapmi, the region of the Sami people.
Even though it's quite commonly used, especially among non-Roma people, the word "Singano" is often considered offensive due to its association with negative stereotypes and inaccurate perceptions of Roma people.
If the country you plan to visit becomes subject to a travel alert, your travel insurance or your cancellation insurance could have consequences.
I would even like to seek the advice of governments that are not your own, but these would likely be directed only at their own citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East might face different situations compared to Europeans or Arabs.
"I bołetini are only a brief summary of the political situation of a country."
The facts presented here are brief, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Bad weather is the generic term for any perilous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or the loss of human life.
Bad weather is present everywhere in the world, and there are different types, which depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive precipitation, and fires are forms of severe weather, such as storms, tornadoes, floods, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include storms, snowstorms, hail, and sandstorms.
It is strongly advised to those who travel to be aware of any risk of severe bad weather that may affect the area where they are going, as this could alter their travel plans.
Anyone planning a visit to a country that could be considered a war zone should receive professional training.
Searching on the internet for “Corso de ambiente ostiłe” will likely provide the address of a local company.
A course normally covers all the issues we discussed here in detail, much more so usually with examples of practical experiences.
A course normally lasts from 2 to 5 days and includes role-playing exercises, a lot of first aid, and sometimes training with weapons.
Books and magazines that deal with survival in the wild are common, but publications that treat war zones are rare.
Travelers who are planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they bring valid documents for their return.
The willingness of governments to issue gender-neutral passports (x) or update documents with the preferred name and gender varies.
The willingness of the governments to accept these documents is equally variable.
Security checkpoints have become much more intrusive since the events of September 11, 2001.
I, as a transgender person, shouldn't have to expect to go through scanners without my privacy and dignity intact.
The backwash is the flow that returns from the waves that break on the beach, often on a cliff or similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in certain deeper sections, and a fast current can form towards the depths.
The majority of deaths occur as a result of the fatigue of trying to row against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you resurface from the current, returning back is no more difficult than usual.
Try to head towards places where you won't find yourself or, depending on your abilities or whether you have been noticed by fate or not, you might expect a rescue.
The shock of returning home precedes the cultural shock (there isn't even a "honeymoon phase"), and it lasts longer and can be more severe.
Travelers who have adapted to the new culture of the times often find it difficult to readjust to their original culture.
You return home after having lived away, you adapt to the new culture, and you've lost some of your old cultural habits.
Since you see someone for the first time, people are probably patient and understanding, seeing as they know that travelers have to adapt to a new country.
People need patience and understanding, too, for travelers returning home.
The spectacle of lights and sounds of the pyramid is one of the most interesting things in the area for visitors.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can see them in silence before the spectacle begins.
Usually you always hear the noise of tourists and vendors. The story of the sound and the light is just like a ledger.
The Sphinx is the backdrop and narrator of a long story.
The scenes are displayed on the pyramids, and the different pyramids are illuminated.
The Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several states and have the largest number of bases, with 66 active in 2020.
The archipelago is 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with the settlement of Villa Las Estrellas.
It also includes Livingston Island, and Deception where the flooded caldera of an active volcano provides a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is the region south of the Peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the Peninsula here merge with the plateau, then re-emerge to form the 360km chain of the Ellsworth Mountains, crossed by the Giasaro Minnesota.
The northern part of the Sentinel Range has the highest mountains in Antarctica, the Vinson Massif, with the 4892 m peak of Mount Vinson.
In remote places, without cellular coverage, a satellite phone may be your only lifeline.
A satellite phone generally doesn't replace your cell phone, since to use the former, you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
The service will often be used for deliveries, including removals, and shipping that has remote data and needs your voice.
The provider should be able to give you information on how to connect to this service.
A popular option for those planning a sabbatical is to travel and learn.
This is popular especially among students who have finished school, allowing them to take a year off before university without jeopardizing their studies.
In many cases, taking a sabbatical year abroad can improve your chances of obtaining higher education in your home country.
Typically, there is a fee to register for these educational programs.
Finland is beautiful by boat. "Land of my lakes" also has many islands in its lakes and archipelagos along its coast.
In the archipelagoes and lagoons, a yacht isn't really necessary.
Even though the archipelagos have a coastline and the largest lakes are big enough for yachts, a small boat or even a kayak is a completely different experience.
Going on a boat is a national pastime in Finland; there's a boat for every seven or eight people.
It's the same thing in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but the rest is quite a unique thing (in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Many of the Baltic cruises offer an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historic center for a couple of days, returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you disembark through a cruise excursion, you do not need a separate visa (as of 2009).
These cruises show Berlin, Germany, in the brochures. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not at all close to the sea and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Traveling by plane is a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
No, it's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and aversions to many things that everyone has.
It might help to understand a little about how a plane works and what happens during a flight to overcome the fear based on the unknown and not being in control.
The couriers are well paid to deliver things quickly. Frequently, time is really important for travel documents, goods, or spare parts for an urgent repair.
On certain routes, the largest companies have their planes, but on other routes, they say there was a problem.
If I sent things by air transport, I would package them carefully for certain routes to avoid damage so they can be unloaded and cleared by customs quickly.
The only way to make it easier was to send it as registered baggage. Airline regulations don't allow you to send baggage without a passenger, which is where things get complicated.
The most obvious way to fly first class or business class is to snag a boat for the privilege (or, even better, have your company pay for it).
In any case, it's certainly not cheap: as a general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times what you pay for economy class for business, and eleven times for first class!
Generally, there's no reason to look for discounts on business class or first class on direct flights between A and B.
And the airlines know well that there is a certain group of travelers who are willing to pay a lot of money for the privilege of arriving somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
The capital of Moldova is Chisinau. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also used widely.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has suffered from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the creation of the self-proclaimed Republic of Transnistria in Eastern Moldova, which has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any UN member state.
The economic canals have been re-established between these two parts of Moldova despite the failure of political negotiations.
In Moldova, the most common religion is the Orthodox Christian one.
Smirne is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million inhabitants, the second most important port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.
Once a city of ancient Smyrna, it was once a modern, developed, and intense commercial center, situated around a large bay and surrounded by mountains.
The wide avenues stretched out, buildings with glass windows and modern commercial centers were topped by traditional roofs with red domes, the market of the 18th century, and old mosques and churches, even though the city has an atmosphere more of Mediterranean Europe than of traditional Turkey.
The landscape of Haldarsvik offers panoramic views of the nearby island of Eysturoy and has an unusual octagonal church.
In the garden of the monastery, there are interesting marble sculptures of doves on certain tombs.
Walking around the curious little garden is worth it.
To the north, the romantic and seductive city of Sintra is easily reachable, made famous to foreigners after a sensational account of its splendors was written by Lord Byron.
The Scotturb Bus 403 regularly travels to Sintra, stopping at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, visit also the great Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima (Temple), a famous place throughout the world for the apparition of the Madonna.
You are asked to remember that you are essentially going to visit a common grave, and also a site that has an incalculable meaning for a large part of the world's population.
There are still many men and women alive who spent time suffering there, and many more who have seen their loved ones being killed or working themselves to exhaustion there, both Jews and non-Jews.
Please treat the site with all the dignity, solemnity, and respect it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or about Nazis.
Don't deface the site with signs or graffiti on the structures.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. About half prefer to speak Catalan, and a large majority understand it, and virtually everyone knows Spanish.
However, for most of the signs, it is only indicated in Catalan because it has been established by law as the first official language.
Nevertheless, Spanish will also be widely used in public transportation and other services.
I announce regularly on the metro and the information is only given in Catalan, but the special announcements are made by an automatic system in various languages including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
The Parisians have the reputation of being egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Even though this is often a mistaken stereotype, the best way to adjust to Paris is to behave in the best possible way, like someone who is "well-bred" (raised well). This will make it relatively easy to get your bearings.
The Parisians' prejudices will quickly evaporate if you show basic courtesy.
The Plitvice Lakes National Park is largely forest, mainly with beech and fir trees, and it features a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
It has a particularly large variety of plant communities due to its spectrum of microclimates, diverse soils, and variable altitudes.
This area also hosts an extremely wide variety of animal and bird species.
A rare fauna can be found here: the European brown bear, the wolf, the eagle, the owl, the lynx, the wildcat, and the great horned owl, along with many other common species.
While visiting the monasteries, the women had to wear skirts that covered their knees, in addition to covering their breasts and backs.
The majority of the monasteries provided for both women and those without means, but if you bring your own, especially one with bright colors, the monk or nun at the entrance will give you a smile.
Following the same line, men are obliged to wear trousers that cover their knees.
Anca these things are usually borrowed from the shop at the entrance, but these clothes aren't washed after each use, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing them. Not a size for all men!
The Majorcan cuisine, like that of other Mediterranean areas, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and uses olive oil everywhere.
Na sena senplice e popolare, specialmente durante l’istà, ła xe la Pa amb Oli: bread with olive oil, tomato, and toppings available like cheese, tuna, etc. Simple and popular fare, especially during the summer, is "Pa amb Oli": bread with olive oil, tomato, and toppings available like cheese, tuna, etc.
All names are always capitalized, especially in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between certain verbs and their objects.
Perhaps it also makes the reading simpler, even though the writing is a little more complicated because you have to figure out whether a verb or adjective will be used with a noun form.
The pronunciation is relatively simple in Italian because almost all the words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The letters 'c' and 'g' are the most important to watch out for, as their pronunciation changes depending on the following vowel.
Remember to pronounce the "r" and "rr" differently: in Venetian they are pronounced the same, but not in Italian.
Persian has a relatively simple and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, this grammar guide will help you learn a lot of things about Persian grammar and the understanding of expressions.
You don't need to tell you that if you know a Romance language, you'll find it easy to learn Portuguese.
Anyway, people who know a little Spanish could quickly arrive at the conclusion that it doesn't need to be studied separately.
Premodern observatories are usually obsolete now and remain as museums or educational sites.
Since light pollution is at its peak, it is not the problem it once was; it is often localized in cities or university campuses, easier to reach than those built in modern times.
The majority of modern research telescopes are enormous structures located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
The sight of the flowering cherry trees, called "hanami," has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The idea came from China, where plum blossoms were preferred.
In Japan, the first flower festivals were held by the emperor only for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Court.
Plants look better when they are in their natural environment, so resist the temptation to dig up "just one" specimen.
If you're going to visit a garden formally laid out, digging up "specimens" will result in you being expelled without a discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe place and an easy place to get around in, and you can buy almost anything after you've been there.
But being in the tropics, just a few degrees north of the Equator, you'll have to deal with the heat (always) and the sun that beats down (when the sky is clear, more rarely).
We also have a few buses that go north to Hebron, the traditional burial site of the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check that the bus you're thinking of taking goes to Hebron and not just to the nearby Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
The internal canals are a good theme around which to base one's vacation.
For example, visiting castles in the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or taking a cruise to interesting cities on the Danube or sailing along the Erie Canal.
I design itineraries, even for bike paths or popular hiking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays of Christianity, and it is celebrated as the day of the birth of Jesus.
Many traditions linked to the festivity have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and by non-Christians around the world.
You have a tradition of spending Easter night at some high place to watch the dawn.
You obviously have Christian explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
Many Christian families often celebrate the Vigil of Easter on the Saturday night during the Easter weekend, with the congregations often entering to celebrate at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All the animals that originally arrived on the islands came by swimming, flying, or sailing.
Due to the long distance from the continent, mammals could not make the journey, making the giant tortoise the primary herbivore in the Galapagos.
Since the arrival of man on the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced: cattle, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic areas in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means that the sun doesn't rise above the horizon.
This offers a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, since the sky is dark more or less all day.
Since these areas are little frequented, and light pollution is often not a problem, you can also enjoy the stars.
The Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than what Westerners might expect.
The shirt and tie are the standard attire, and colleagues don't call each other by last name or title.
Harmony in the workplace is crucial, and it emphasizes group effort rather than recognizing individual achievements.
The workers have to seek approval from their superior for every decision they make, and they must obey the instructions of their superior without asking questions.
