This confirms not only that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a theory already known, but also provides details that cannot usually be obtained from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional representation.
According to scientists, in the upper part this animal had a chestnut-colored coat and, in the lower part, a coat with a pale or carotenoid color.
This discovery also gives us an idea about the evolution of populations in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed central axis called "rachis," but share other characteristics with modern feathers, such as barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis may have been a later evolutionary development than these features.
The structure of the wings makes you think they weren't used for flight, but rather for regulating temperature or for display. Researchers believe the specimen shows a wing that grew, not a bird's fluke, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur.
Researchers were of the opinion that, although this is the tail of a small dinosaur, the specimen shows a feather-like growth and not a young bird's down.

Scientists have concluded that dark matter has an influence on another dark matter in the same way as ordinary matter.
According to this theory, the majority of dark matter around a galaxy is located around the galaxy in the form of an aureole and is composed of many small particles.

Candidates can send representatives as witnesses to any part of the process. The votes are counted in the evening by volunteers under strict control, implementing the relevant procedures.

The Governor of California, Arnold Schwarzenegger, ratified a bill that prohibits the sale or rental of violent video games to minors.
The draft law requires that violent video games sold in the state of California be labeled with a label stating "18" and imposes a penalty for their sale to minors of a fine of $1000 for each violation.
The Director of the Prosecutor's Office, Kier Starmer QC, made a statement this morning stating that Huhne and Pryce were under indictment.
Huhne has resigned and will be replaced in the cabinet by Member of Parliament Ed Davey. Member of Parliament Norman Lamb is expected to take over as Minister of Trade, which will be vacated by Davey.
Huhne and Pryce have been appointed to appear before the Magistracy Court in Westminster on February 16th.
The victims were Zachary Cuddeback, 21 years old, and Nicholas Alden, 25 years old. Cuddeback had been the driver of the car.
Edgar Veguilla was wounded in the arm and cheek, while Kristoffer Schneider sustained injuries requiring surgery to reconstruct his face.
The weapon of Uka was blocked when he directed it at the head of the fifth person. Schneider has chronic pain, is blind in one eye, is missing a piece of his skull, and his face has been rebuilt with titanium.
Schneider testified through a video link from a US FA base in his homeland.
Besides Wednesday's activity, Carpanedo also competed in two individual races in the championship.
Her first was slalom, where she didn't finish in her first attempt. 36 out of 116 competitors achieved the same result in that race.
In her other race, the giant slalom, she finished in tenth place in the seated women's group, with a combined run time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the winner, Austrian Klaudia Lësh, and 1:09.02 minutes slower than the ninth-place finisher, Giongi Dani of Hungary.
Four skiers in the women's seated skiing category did not finish their race, and a total of 45 out of 117 skiers at the Alpine Skiing World Championships did not qualify.
The Madhya Pradesh Police recovered the stolen laptop and cell phone.
Deputy Inspector General D K Arya said: "We have arrested five individuals who assaulted the Swiss citizen and we have found her cell phone and laptop."
The accused are Baba Kanjar, Buta Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police inspector Çandra Shekar Solanki said that the accused arrived at court with their faces covered.
Although there were three people inside the house when the car crashed into it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered severe head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed, while emergency services freed the driver from the red "Audi TT".
He was initially admitted to James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adeko has been accused of murdering her son in the Edinburgh Sheriff Court.
She is in detention awaiting the indictment and the start of the trial, but every piece of eyewitness testimony can be corrupted because her image has been widely publicized.
This is a common practice of withholding evidence in the United Kingdom, but Scottish justice operates differently and the courts have considered the publication of photographs as potentially prejudicial to the case.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee points out that "it seems that journalists are treading a dangerous path if they publish photos etc. of suspected individuals."
The Prosecutor's Office, which is responsible for all criminal proceedings, has told journalists that no further comment will be made until the indictment is announced.
According to reports, the document will refer to the dispute over borders, which Palestine claims according to the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
It is thought that the other topics covered include the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel, until the signing of this agreement, seeks to maintain a continuous military presence in the valley for ten years, while Palestinian authorities agree to allow their presence for only five years.
The supervisors were to be closely watched by the guards during the additional test of harmful animal control, as the test was monitored and evaluated for its effectiveness.
In a partnership between the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Sports Shooters Association, qualified volunteers were recruited under the Australian Sports Shooters Association's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, Deputy Director for Protection and Heritage of the National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS), the four hunters selected for the first hunting operation have been given extensive safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, Martelly was sworn in before a new nine-member Provisional Electoral Council (CEP).
This is the fifth Provisional Electoral Council for Martell in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended the resignation of the previous Provisional Electoral Council as part of a package of measures to lead the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Protests, sometimes violent, were triggered by the lack of development of elections, some of which have been expected since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPods overheating and malfunctioning have been reported, causing a total of six fires and leaving four people with minor burns.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI) announced that it had been informed of 27 accidents related to the devices.
The Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry announced last week that "Apple" had informed them of 34 other overheating incidents, which the company called "unserious".
The Ministry reacted by calling Apple's postponement of the report "really regrettable."
The earthquake struck Mariana at 07:19 p.m. local time (on Friday at 09:19 a.m. Greenwich Mean Time).
The North Mariana Emergency Management Office stated that they had not been notified of any damage in the area.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there were no indicators of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer held tourists from Hong Kong hostage by hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza aimed his M16 rifle at the tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued and at least six deaths have been confirmed so far.
Six prisoners, including children and the elderly, were released first, along with the Filipino photographers.
The photographers seized the opportunity when an elderly woman had to go to the bathroom. They aimed their weapons at her.
Ligjini followed in his father's footsteps and began a career in medicine.
He was trained as an obstetrician and began working at the National Women's Hospital of Auckland in 1959.
While working in the hospital, Liginsi began to research premature birth in his free time.
His research showed that if a hormone is administered, it would accelerate the maturation of the fetus's lungs in infants.
Xinhua reported that state investigators found two "black box" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Even colleagues from the neighboring areas paid tribute to him.
Tomi Drimer said: "Luna was the first queen of the extreme. My first manager. Luna died the night of two moons. Quite rare, like herself. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldast" Ranelsi commented that: "Luna was so strange that I... maybe even more so... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she is in a better place."
In a survey of 1400 people before the 2010 federal elections, opponents of Australia's return to a republic had increased by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard declared during the 2010 federal election campaign that she believed the state of Australia would become a republic at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
34 percent of people in the survey share this opinion, according to which they wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In the final responses of the survey, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should never become a republic.
The gold medalist in the Olympic Games was supposed to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle, and participate in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his appeals, his physical condition was uncertain.
He hasn't been able to get the right medicine to overcome his pain because it's prohibited by the Games.
Kurtis Kuper, a mathematician and professor of computer science at the Central Missouri University, has discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
The discovery was verified by many people using various devices and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets were a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic matter that could form proteins and help sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand the formation of planets, especially how Earth was formed from the collision of comets long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, took office as governor at the beginning of this year and signed a bill last month legalizing same-sex marriages.
He called the rumors "political nonsense and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system that, according to FAA claims, will allow aircraft to travel on shorter routes and save millions of gallons of fuel each year, as well as reduce carbon emissions.
He uses satellite technology, compared to the old technology based on ground radars, to allow air traffic controllers to locate the aircraft more accurately and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional vehicles will be deployed, and the express trains will not stop at "Uembli", and the car parking facilities, as well as parking and drop-off areas, are not available for the field.
The fear of a lack of transportation increased the possibility that the game would be played with doors closed and without team supporters.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science reported the creation of a new species of birds in the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that the new species evolved in only two generations, although it was thought that this process lasted longer, due to the crossbreeding between an endemic Darwin's finch, Geospiza fortes, and the introduced cactus finch, Geospiza conirostris.
Flori can be worked in all kinds of shapes. It can be stamped into thin forms.
It can be drawn and become a thin wire, which can then be shaken and welded. It can be flattened with a hammer or laminated into sheets.
It can be finely ground and combined with other metals. It could be ground so finely that it was sometimes used for decorating hand-painted images in books called "Illuminated Manuscripts".
This is called the pH of a chemical. You can prepare an indicator using red cabbage juice.
The juice of the elderberry changes color depending on the acidic or basic (alkaline) level of the chemical.
The pH level is determined by the amount of hydrogen ions (H+ in pH) in the analyzed chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons that have had their electrons removed (after hydrogen atoms consist of one electron and one proton).
Mix the two dry powders and then, with wet and clean hands, squeeze them together to form a ball.
The moisture in your hands will react with the outer layers, which will give a strange sensation and form a kind of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had toilets with flushing systems in almost every dwelling, connected to a rather complex sewage system.
In the houses of the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece, remains of sewage systems have been found.
Toilets existed even in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths mixed for men and women.
When you make a phone call to someone thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
The satellite in space receives the call and then returns it again, almost instantly.
The satellite was sent into space by means of a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere distorts a portion of our light and image.
For placing a satellite or telescope in space, a giant rocket with a height of over 100 feet is needed.
The wheel changed the world in unbelievable ways. The most important thing the wheel has brought us is that it has provided us with a much faster and much easier means of transportation.
She brought us the train, a car, and many other means of transport.
Below them are cats larger than the average ones that feed on prey of average size, ranging from foxes to antelopes and deer.
In conclusion, there are many small cats (including domestic cats that move freely) that eat many more small animals such as insects, lizards, rodents, and birds.
The secret to their success is the concept of comfortable cornering, a special function that every cat has which prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most social felines. They live in large groups called prides.
Tufts consist of one to three closely related adult males, along with up to thirty females and offspring.
Women, being part of a large family of sisters and daughters, generally have closer ties with one another.
The packs of lynxes are brought in like wolves or dogs, animals with a behavior that strangely resembles that of lynxes (but not those of other large cats) and are also very deadly to their prey.
Like a fairly well-prepared athlete, a tiger can climb (although not as well), swim, leap long distances, and pull with the strength of five strong men.
The tiger is in a group (the panther family) with lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can purr.
The roar of a tiger is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but is more like a sentence with words that are hungry and shouted.
Ocelots prefer to feed on small animals. When they can, they catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than it.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find animals (their scent) through the air, smelling where they have been on the ground.
They can see very well in the dark with their night vision and also move very stealthily. Leopards hunt by stalking their prey, blending in with the surrounding environment and then pouncing on their prey.
When a small group of living things (a small population) separates from the main population from which they came (for example, if they cross a mountain range or river, or if they go to a new island from which they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment different from the one they were in before.
This new environment has different and diverse resources and competitors, therefore the new population will need different characteristics or adaptations to be a stronger competitor than a previously necessary one.
The original population hasn't changed at all; it still needs the same adaptations as before.
With the passage of time, with the beginning of the new population's adaptation to its new environment, it begins to appear increasingly different from the other population.
In the end, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they will no longer be considered the same kind.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the creation of new species. Speciation is a very important part and an inevitable consequence of evolution.
Plants produce the oxygen that people inhale and absorb the carbon dioxide that people exhale (that is, that they exhale through breathing).
Plants produce their own food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We build our houses with plants and create our clothes with plants. The majority of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
Mosasaurus was the ultimate predator of his time, so he was unafraid of anything, except for other mosasaurs.
His long fangs were filled with over 70 sharp, pointed teeth, along with an extra set in the palate, meaning nothing that stood in his way escaped him.
We don't know for sure, but he may have used his tongue like a fork. His diet included snails, large fish, and other reptiles, and he may have even been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water as well; even a giant dinosaur like a T. rex could not defeat it.
Although we would recognize most of their foods, the Roma had quite a few strange or unusual items for festivals, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of bird called gjer.
Another difference was that, while poor people and women ate their humble meals while sitting on chairs, wealthy men preferred to eat together at feasts, where they ate their dishes spread out on mats.
The meals of ancient Romans could not have included foods that came from America or Asia to Europe during later centuries.
They, for example, had neither corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and not even ancient Romans ever tasted seaweed.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their gods, which was called the house of the god.
The people brought offerings to the lords and the priests tried to care for the needs of the lords through ceremonies and festivals.
Every temple had an open temple courtyard and then an inner sanctuary where only the priests could enter.
Sometimes, as part of the temple complex, special towers in the form of pyramids were built, called ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a private observatory for the lord.
Housing wasn't that important in the warm climate of the Middle East.
Life in the Hebrew family mainly took place in the open air.
The women made cheese in the yard; the shops were simply open counters with views onto the street. Stone was used to build the houses.
In the land of Kanan, there were no large forests, therefore timber was exceptionally expensive.
Greenland had few settlements. In the Scandinavian sagas, it is said that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder and, on his voyages westward, he discovered Greenland and named it as such.
Nevertheless, the Eskimo tribes were already living there at that time, regardless of his discovery.
Although every state was "Scandinavian," among the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland there were quite a few differences.
If you have seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that a treasure map was hidden behind the Declaration of Independence.
However, this is not true. Although there is something written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
Behind the Declaration of Independence was written "The original Declaration of Independence, dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the end of this document, written backwards.
While no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of its existence, the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up to preserve it.
Therefore, it is possible that the marking was placed only as a label.
The landings of "D" Day and the subsequent battles had liberated northern France, but the south remained still occupied.
He was governed by the French of the Vichy regime. They were Frenchmen who, in 1940, had chosen to make peace with the Germans and had cooperated with the occupiers, instead of fighting against them.
The Allies invaded Southern France on August 15, 1940, and the invasion was called "Operation Dragoon".
Within two weeks, the Americans and the forces of the French Resistance had liberated Southern France and were advancing towards Germany.
Civilization is called a unique and shared culture of a fairly large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word "qytetërim" (civilization) derives from the Latin word "civilis," which means "civil," and is linked to the Latin word "civis," meaning "citizen," and "civitas," meaning "city" or "city-state," which in some way defines the size of society.
City-states are the precursors to states. A civilizing culture implies the transmission of knowledge across several generations, a continuous cultural trace, and a direct spread.
Smaller cultures often disappear without leaving adequate historical evidence and fail to be recognized as full-fledged civilizations.
During the American Revolutionary War, the thirteen colonies initially created a weak central government – with Congress as its sole structure – according to the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress had no power to impose taxes, and since it lacked a national executive or judicial power, it relied on the state authorities, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all of its laws.
Furthermore, he did not have the authority to violate laws regarding taxes and tariffs between states.
The mothers were seeking unanimous approval from all states before they could be changed, and they took the states' government so lightly that their representatives often didn't attend.
The Italian national football team, just like the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and, in 2006, they were champions of the FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are more popular in the northern regions, starting with Italians who compete in both international games and Olympic events.
Japan contains almost 7,000 islands (the largest of which is Honshu), making Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the grouping/cluster of islands that Japan has, Japan is often mentioned, from a geographical perspective, as an "archipelago".
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century, when European sailors passing by registered the name of the island as "Ilha Formosa" or "beautiful island."
The Dutch East India Company established a base in Southern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a transformation of local grain production practices and employing Chinese workers on its rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the forces of the Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing dynasty government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, according to which it ceded sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled it until 1945.
Machu Picchu includes three main buildings, specifically: Inti Watana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
The majority of the buildings within the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a more accurate idea of what they looked like originally.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976 and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common format of a still photograph in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant size of film at the end of the analog film era.
It continues to be produced even today, and above all, in the same inherited format from the image sensor of a digital camera.
The 35mm format is, in fact, a bit awkward, 36mm wide by 24mm tall.
The image ratio of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio with whole numbers) is thus 3:2.
Many common formats (e.g., the APS family of formats) are the same or very similar to this image ratio.
The rule of thirds, often abused and frequently mocked, is a simple guiding line that creates dynamism by maintaining a sense of order within an image.
He determines that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of the lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see the example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become powerful and wealthy, was viewed with a suspicious eye.
For over a thousand years, the Christian faith had bound European states together, despite differences in language and customs.
His power, which was felt everywhere he touched, affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the main dogmas of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds are there specifically for that reason.
The main organs of the church had been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money led many to doubt whether this principle was being applied.
Immediately after the start of the military battles, Britain began the naval blockade against Germany.
The strategy was proven to be effective, disrupting military and civilian essential supplies, although this blockade violated generally accepted international law, which was codified through several international agreements in the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to block the entry of all ships into parts of the ocean, even endangering neutral vessels.
Since the reaction to this tactic was minimal, Germany hoped for a similar reaction to its unrestricted submarine warfare.
The dominant attitudes of most citizens and nations during the 1920s were pacifism and isolation.
After the horrors and atrocities of World War I, nations wanted to avoid a repeat of such a situation in the future.
In 1884, Tesla emigrated to the United States of America to accept a job in the "Edison" company in the city of New York.
He arrived in the USA with only 4 cents in his account, a book of poems, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batcheller (his former manager) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a peculiar way of recounting different periods of time; each stage of China or each family that held power was a known dynasty.
However, between each of the dynasties there was an unstable period with divided provinces. The most well-known of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted for 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, a fierce war took place between many nobles who fought for the throne.
"The Three Kingdoms" was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China, in which thousands of people died in the fight to seize the highest position in the grand palace in Xian.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the country belongs to the people, and not to a single ruler.
After the revolution, jobs were also opened up for all male applicants, enabling the most ambitious and successful ones to succeed.
This also applies to the army because instead of military ranks being based on categories, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was most interested in matters beyond this worldly life. He often went to meditate in a cave that began to be known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (of light).
Even the very person who survived those times provides a very vivid reflection of the spiritual trends of Muhammad.
This cave, which is located on the peak of one of the mountains north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, it's not easy to find, even if you know it exists. Once you're inside the cave, you are completely isolated.
You can't see anything else except the clear and beautiful sky above and the numerous mountains that surround you. From inside the cave, you can see or hear only very little of this world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built in honor of the deceased pharaoh.
The Giza plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, has several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid of Giza), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was created in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of his wives and family members.
The "upper curve" symbol looks like a V, and the "lower curve" symbol looks like a wire loop or a square without the bottom side.
"The top" means you should start it at the top and pull the bowstring down, and "the bottom" means you should start it at the hoop (which is where your hand holds the bow) and pull the bowstring back.
The upper bow generally produces a sweeter sound, while the lower bow is stronger and more decisive.
You can keep your notes, but don't forget that the printed brackets are there for musical purposes, so they should usually be respected.
King Louis XVI, Queen Marie-Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie-Therese and 4-year-old Louis-Charles), and the king's sister, Mrs. Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
They returned to Paris with a carriage, surrounded by a crowd of people shouting and yelling threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to keep the windows of their carriage completely open.
In a flash, a member of the crowd shook the head of a royal guard who had been killed at Versailles before the horrified Queen.
The expenses of the war against American imperialism to conquer the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States to cover a significant portion of expenses, and the interest on the bonds was offered on the New York Stock Exchange on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banking institutions.
Certainly, the gains achieved through the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people would be the main victories of American imperialism.
Someone needs to understand the circumstances that prompted the creation of the order to understand the Templars.
The period in which the events occurred is usually referred to as the High Middle Ages, the period in European history from the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (years 1000-1300 AD).
Noon was preceded by early noon and followed by late noon, which, by agreement, ended around the year 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that encompasses a variety of ideas in practice, ranging from technological impetus or the necessity of technology to the narrow understanding that the fate of humanity is guided by a basic logic linked to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
The vast majority of interpretations of technological determinism have two main, common ideas: that the development of technology progresses on a path beyond cultural or political influence, and that technology, on the other hand, has "effects" on societies that are natural and unconstrained by social factors.
Someone might say, for example, that vehicles inevitably lead to the improvement of roads.
Nevertheless, a whole international road network is not economically viable for just a small number of vehicles, therefore new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a higher percentage of road accidents, which results in the development of new techniques in healthcare for repairing injured bodies.
Romanticism had a strong element of cultural determinism, brought about by writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Shelegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped people, and over time customs and cultures arose that were linked to that geography, and since they were in harmony with the land and society, they were better than laws imposed arbitrarily.
Just as Paris is recognized as the fashion capital of the world today, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His fame as the epicenter of luxury began around the 400s AD and lasted until around the 1100s AD.
His position declined during the twelfth century, especially due to the fact that the Crusaders had returned bringing such gifts as: silks and spices, which were valued more than what the Byzantine markets offered.
At this time, the transfer of the title of fashion capital from Constantinople to Paris also took place.
Gothic style reached its peak in the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was heavily influenced by the Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles may remain 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments of the time, which came as a result of the Crusades, was that people started using chests to store clothes.
Existential farming is farming practiced to produce enough food to satisfy only the needs of the farmer and his/her family.
Existential agriculture is a simple, often organic, system that uses local seeds combined through crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques for maximum yield.
Historically, the majority of farmers were engaged in subsistence farming, and the situation remains the same in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite individuals who think alike, who feel marginalized by societal standards, and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be distinguished by the ethnicity, age, location, class, and/or gender of the members.
The distinguishing criteria of a subculture can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, gender-based, geographical, or a combination of factors.
Members of a subculture often express their affiliation by specifically and symbolically using a style that encompasses fashion, mannerisms, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to base ourselves on some unfortunate cases of children who, due to negligence, misfortunes, or intentional abuse, were not socialized with adults during their upbringing.
These children are called "wild" or primitive. Some wild children have been isolated by people (usually by their parents); this abandonment of the child was in some cases due to the parents' rejection of the child's severe intellectual or physical disability.
The wild children may have been victims of severe child abuse or trauma prior to being abandoned or leaving.
For others, it is said they were raised by animals, and for some, it is said they lived alone in nature.
When a child is raised entirely by non-human animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely identical to that of the specific animal caretaker, such as fear or indifference towards people.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, scaffolding takes it a step further.
The teaching method through scaffolding is not a learning method, but rather, on the contrary, it is a supporting tool that provides support to people who are undergoing a new learning experience, such as: using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolds can be virtual and real, meaning that a teacher is a kind of scaffold, but so is the small person in the form of a paperclip in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is absorbed by the software and aims to investigate, encourage, and explain procedures that the student may have found difficult to handle on their own.
Children are sent to a children's home for a variety of reasons ranging from neglect to abuse, and even blackmail.
No child should ever grow up in an environment that is not encouraging, kind, and educational, yet they are growing up this way.
We consider the Foster Care System a safe zone for these children.
Our guardianship system is expected to ensure loving guardians, safe homes, secure healthcare, and continuous education.
Care is supposed to ensure all the missing needs of the home where they were before.
The internet integrates both mass communication elements and interpersonal ones.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to other dimensions regarding access for uses and satisfactions.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are proposed as important incentives for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
"Personal commitment" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new aspects related to motivation by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they observed how audiences reacted to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in explaining micro-expressions and facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is said that someone can tell if a person is lying through the accurate interpretation of their facial expressions.
In his "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks recounts how individuals unable to comprehend the speech due to brain damage are nevertheless able to accurately assess its sincerity.
He even thought that such abilities to explain human behavior could be possessed by animals as well, for example, domestic dogs.
Studies of the 20th century have shown that there are two groups of genetic variations: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds a new genetic variant and selection removes it from the group of expressed variants.
Segregation and recombination repeatedly mix variation between the two groups with each generation.
A primate with a digestive system similar to that of humans has difficulty meeting its amino acid needs through savanna plant sources.
Furthermore, failing to achieve this has serious consequences: reduced growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
Easily accessible plant sources would be the proteins obtained from leaves and stems, but primates like us have difficulty digesting them unless they are cooked.
Otherwise, animal-derived foods (insects, termites, eggs), not only digest easily but also provide large amounts of protein that contain all the necessary amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved "their protein problem" to some extent, just as chimpanzees act in the savanna today.
Sleep interruption is the intentional awakening process during your normal sleep period and a short nap (10-60 minutes).
This can be done easily by using a clock with a relatively low volume to bring you gently awake without fully waking you up.
If you catch yourself resetting the clock in bed, you can put it on the other side of the room to force yourself to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other biorhythm-based possibilities include drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed to force someone to wake up to urinate.
The level of inner peace that a person possesses is in direct proportion to the level of tension in their body and soul.
With the decrease in tension, the current vital force increases. Every individual has the possibility to find absolute peace and contentment.
Anyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders this goal is our own tension and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but was further enriched with the theological concept of the "way of love" of Mahayana and various Indian yoga techniques.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It encompasses Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the all-encompassing path of love.
Through Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (the energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The Tibetan meditation center is divine yoga. Through the visual representation of several deities, the energy channels are purified, the chakras are activated, and self-awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, bringing cooperation between the USSR and the USA. With the end of the war, clashes of systems, processes, and cultures led to conflict among states.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and thus the Cold War began.
It would continue for the next 40 years and would be truly fought, by authorized armies in battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and in many other places.
On September 17, 1939, the Polish defense had already collapsed, and the only hope was retreat and reorganization along the Romanian front.
Nevertheless, these plans were rendered useless within almost a night, when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army entered and formed the fronts of Belarus and Ukraine after the occupation of the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international treaties, both bilateral and multilateral.
The use of ships for transporting goods is currently the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and people across the ocean.
The duty of navies has traditionally been to ensure that your country maintains the ability to move people and goods, while simultaneously intervening in the ability of enemies to move their people and goods.
One of the most significant recent examples of this was the Arctic campaign in World War II. The Americans were trying to relocate people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to come to the aid of Britain.
Simultaneously, the German fleet was trying to stop the traffic mainly using submarines.
If the Allies had failed, Germany might have managed to conquer Britain, just as it had happened with other countries in Europe.
Apparently, sheep were initially domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Old cultures and tribes began to keep animals so they could easily obtain milk, cheese, meat, and hides.
Domestic sheep were generally kept in flocks that grazed on hills or other pastures, often under the care of shepherds who were usually children or adolescents, much like the shepherds known today. These methods of livestock management are still used today.
The roads for the train carriages were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the carts were made only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed horses to pull them to achieve greater speeds and to haul heavier loads than on the somewhat more difficult roads of that time.
The workers got in quite early to hold the rails in place. However, it was gradually understood that the rails would be more effective if they had an iron plate on top.
This became common practice, but the iron wore out the wooden wheels of the wagons more.
Finally, the wooden wheels were replaced with iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were introduced.
The first known means of transport was walking; people began to walk on foot two million years ago when Homo Erectus appeared (which means man on foot).
Their ancestors, the australopithecus, did not walk upright regularly.
Adaptations for bipedalism have been found in the fossils of Australopithecus dating back 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have walked upright as far back as seven million years ago.
We can start living by respecting the environment more, we can participate in the environmental movement, and we can even become activists to reduce future suffering to some extent.
In many cases, this is like treating the symptoms. However, we should find the cause of the problems and deactivate it if we don't want only a temporary solution.
It is very clear that the world has undergone major changes due to human advancements in science and technology, and problems have increased due to overpopulation and the extravagant way of life of humankind.
After its approval on July 4th by the Congress, a handwritten draft signed by the President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent further down the line to the printing house of John Dunlap.
During the night, 150 to 200 copies were made, which are now known as the "Dunlap Flyers".
The first public reading of the document was done on July 8th by John Nixon in the courtyard of the "Independence Hall."
One of them was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it on July 9th before his troops in New York. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap leaves known to exist to date are the oldest surviving copies of the document. The first handwritten copy has not survived.
Quite a few paleontologists today believe that a group of dinosaurs survived and are still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't see them as dinosaurs, as they are covered in feathers and can fly.
But there are many things regarding birds that are similar to dinosaurs.
They have feet with claws and scales, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a T-Rex dinosaur.
Almost all computers in use today are based on the manipulation of information, which is encoded in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two values, therefore 0 or 1, and in computer language, these numbers are referred to as binary digits or bits.
Internal bleeding may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms like vomiting are quite common, making an immediate diagnosis difficult.
The presence of an open medicine or household chemical container that is toxic may be a clearer sign of poisoning.
Review the label for specific instructions regarding first aid for that particular poison.
For this group of insects, entomologists use the term "kandërr" in its official meaning.
This term derives from the temporary resemblance to bedbugs, which are highly adapted insects to parasite humans.
Just like killer insects, bed bugs are also peripatetic, adapted to live in the nest or shelter of their host.
In all of the United States of America, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), remaining thus the most important neurological disease in young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
Studies have shown that the chances of women having multiple sclerosis are twice as high as for men.
A couple may decide that raising a child is not for their own good or for the child's own good.
These couples may decide to prepare an adoption plan for their child.
In an adoption, biological parents relinquish their rights as parents so that another couple can adopt the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides the majority of scientific research.
But it is not the only thing; scientific research is also guided by experimentation, and experimentation is the proof used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses, by asking questions and making observations.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, and especially on the Bible written in Latin.
Aristotle's views were accepted on every scientific issue, including those psychological.
When knowledge of the Greek language declined, the West found itself cut off from the Greek roots of philosophy and science.
Many rhythms observed in relation to physiology and behavior often depend mainly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production by biological clocks.
For the majority of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, irregular rhythms have been documented that are not simply a reaction to external irregular cues.
Biological clocks are independent oscillators that will continue a period of cycles with free movement, even when external signals are absent.
The experiment by Hershey and Chase was one of the main proposals that DNA was a genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used viruses, or phages, to implant their DNA into a bacterium.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the bacteriophage DNA with radioactive phosphorus or the bacteriophage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can bring about a variety of different effects, depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the genetic material that has been affected, and whether the cells that have been affected are germline cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be transmitted to children, whereas mutations in other places can cause cell death or cancer.
Tourism based on nature attracts people who are interested in visiting natural areas with the aim of enjoying the scenery, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of activities in the field include fishing, hunting, photography, birdwatching, park visits, and studying information related to the ecosystem.
One example is the development of visits, photography, and learning about orangutans in Borneo.
Every morning, people leave the villages by car to go to their workplace and pass other people on the way, whose work destination is the place from which they have just left.
In this dynamic movement of vehicles coming and going, everyone is in a way connected to and supports a transport system based on private cars.
Now science shows that the massive economy based on carbon has caused the displacement of the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the last two million years.
Everyone is a participant in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone has complaints about transportation systems.
In developed countries, it is rare to hear so many complaints about water quality or bridges collapsing.
Why do transport systems cause so much dissatisfaction, why do they fail every day? Aren't transport engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more important happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, it is difficult to study traffic flow because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to act within a consistent time interval; Therefore, traffic flows can be calculated approximately mathematically.
To better illustrate the flow of traffic, connections have been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This coordination helps in the planning, design, and use of road objects.
Animals and insects were the first to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them avoid their predators and find food and mate more easily.
The majority of insects have the ability to fold their wings backwards along their body length.
This gives them a larger number of small places to take refuge from the raiders.
The only insects that can't fold their wings backwards today are the lacewings and Mayflies.
Thousands of years ago, a person named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people thought he was right, but many others believed the opposite; that the solar system, including the Sun (and even the other stars), revolved around the Earth.
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't seem to move, or does it?
The Amazon River is the second longest river in the world and the widest, being eight times more voluminous than the second-longest river.
The Amazon is also the widest river on Earth, reaching a width of six miles in some places.
20 percent of the water that flows from the rivers of the planet into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main river, the Amazon, is 6387 km (3980 miles) long. It collects water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and technical perfection of the construction of the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were amazed by the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is approximately 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the state with the smallest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also the language used daily by the majority of those who work in the state, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have had knowledge since antiquity about basic chemical elements such as gold, silver, and copper, as all of these can be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easily extracted from mines using primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, put forward the theory that everything is composed of a mixture of one or more of the four elements. These elements were earth, air, water, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also created the theory that they transform into new matter to create whatever we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Silver and gold, undoubtedly, are also metals.
You can also obtain alloys that include small amounts of non-metallic elements like carbon.
Everything in the Universe is composed of matter. All matter is composed of small particles, which are called atoms.
Atoms are so small that trillions of them could fit in a drop at the end of this sentence.
In this way, with its invention, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and uses of the pencil have declined.
People now write messages on computer screens, without ever needing to use a pencil sharpener.
Someone can only ask themselves what will happen to the keyboard when something newer comes out.
The atomic bomb functions on the principle that the combination of several protons and neutrons into a nucleus requires energy.
Just like lifting a heavy cart up a hill. Separating the core from the front releases a portion of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to split spontaneously or with even the smallest trigger.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The lunar crust is approximately 70 km thick on the visible side and 100 km thick on the hidden side of the Moon.
She is thinner in the dark, coastal areas and thicker in the mountainous areas.
There might be more seas on the near side, because the crust is thinner. The lava had an easier time freezing to the surface.
Theories of content focus on finding what makes people choose or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires which they carry with them as they age.
These theories analyze what makes some people desire things they desire and what things in their environment will push them to do or not do certain things.
Two widely-known theories regarding content are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally, two behaviors may emerge when managers begin to lead their former colleagues. One side of the spectrum is the effort to remain "one of the guys" (or girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unusual decisions, imposing disciplinary measures, conducting performance evaluations, and assigning duties and responsibilities to everyone.
On the other side of the spectrum, such a person easily transforms into someone unfamiliar, who believes that he or she must change everything the team has done and appropriate it.
Ultimately, the manager bears ultimate responsibility for the success and failure of the team.
Often, this behavior causes discord between the leaders and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams are expected to meet the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, but there are some minor differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as the point of contact for their direct physical group.
They often have more autonomy than members of the traditional team, as their teams can meet according to different local schedules, which may not be understood by their local administration.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a real "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The invisible team" is the management team to which every member reports. The invisible team sets standards for every member.
Why would an organization want to go through the lengthy process of creating an educational organization? An objective for putting organizational learning concepts into practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used effectively across the functional sectors of an organization, creativity and capability can emerge.
As a result, the process of an organization working together to overcome an obstacle can lead to a repetitive process to serve the needs of the client.
Before an organization can become innovative, leaders must create a culture of innovation, as well as the exchange of knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum method as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance.
The neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical treatment of research into recognition. As a result, they narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The reciprocal link between brain pathology and behavior helps scientists in their studies.
It has been known for a long time that various types of brain injuries, traumas, lesions, and tumors affect behavior and cause changes in some cognitive functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to see and study brain structures and processes that we have never seen before.
This gives us a lot of information and material for building simulation models, which help us understand the processes of our mind.
Although artificial intelligence (AI) has gained significant traction in science fiction, artificial intelligence constitutes a very important branch of computer science, which deals with the intelligent behavior, learning, and adaptation of a machine.
Research in AI includes the creation of devices for automating tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include checking, planning and scheduling, the ability to provide answers to diagnoses and client questions, as well as recognition of handwriting, voice, and facial expressions.
These things have evolved into distinct disciplines that focus on ensuring solutions for real-life problems.
Artificial Intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, as they are incorporated into several software applications for personal computers and video game consoles.
Excursions take up a large part of every teaching methodology. It often happens that a teacher expresses the desire to send her students to places that cannot be reached by bus.
Technology offers solutions with virtual field trips. Students can visit museum artifacts, watch an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting with their class.
A virtual field trip is also a great way to think about a trip and to share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year the students of the "Bennet" school in North Carolina create a website dedicated to their trip to the capital; this website is modified every year, but the old versions are still kept online as a memory block.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. While students often start their blogging experience with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience generally changes this.
Since students are often the most critical audience, the blogger sets out to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
The blog post also "forces students to become more insightful about the world around them." The need to cater to the audience's interests inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to expand their knowledge beyond their traditional school day.
The proper use of blogs "can help students become more critical and analytical." Through active responses to online materials, students can define their positions regarding writings by others, as well as define their perspectives on specific issues (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is the attractive bilingual capital of Canada which has a series of art galleries and museums presenting the past and present of Canada.
To the south lies Niagara Falls, and the north shelters the unspoiled natural beauty of Muskoka and beyond.
All of these and many others present Ontario with elements considered the most typical Canadian by foreigners.
The larger areas that are located further north are very sparsely populated, and some of them are almost deserted and uninhabited regions.
For a population comparison that makes many people amazed: there are more African Americans living in the United States than Canadian citizens.
The islands of East Africa are located in the Indian Ocean, along the eastern coast of Africa.
Madagascar is the largest island and continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or affiliated with France and are known as luxurious beach resorts.
Arabs also brought Islam to these lands, and it had a significant impact on the Comoros and Mayotte islands.
The influence and colonization from Europe began in the 15th century, after the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
The region is bordered by the Sahel to the north and the Atlantic Ocean to the south and west.
Women: It is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
You'll be helped even if you come with a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women need to understand that cultural differences can cause what they consider flirting and stalking, grabbing by the arm, etc., is not uncommon.
Be resolute when you reject men and don't be afraid to hold your ground (even if cultural changes occur, it doesn't mean it's okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by the Imazighen fishermen in the 10th century BC and was used by the Phenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed and rebuilt it, naming it Casa Branca, but abandoned it after an earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru-I-Badia, and it was called Casablanca by Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to bargain in all of Morocco.
Around the Old Medina, you can easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products such as: tagine, ceramic items, leather goods, hookahs, and a whole range of decorations, but everything is for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the east, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was devastated by the lava flow of the Nyiragongo volcano, which covered most of the city's roads and especially the city center.
Although Goma is somewhat safe, you should research for each visit outside of Goma to understand the situation of the ongoing fighting in the North Kivu province.
The city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo volcano along with some mountain gorilla tracking expeditions in Africa at a lower cost.
You can use a boda-bodan (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The usual (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese francs for a short trip.
In combination with its undeniable remoteness, "Timbuktu" is now used as a metaphor for distant, exotic places.
Timbuktu is today a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction and it has an airport.
It was added to the list of World Heritage sites in danger in 1990 due to the threat from the black stork.
She was one of the main highlights during Henri Louis Gates' special broadcast for the Public Broadcasting Service program " Wonders of the African World".
The city has a strong contrast with the rest of the cities in this country, because it has more of an Arab style than an African one.
The Kruger National Park (KNP) stretches in the northeast of South Africa and runs along the border with Mozambique to the east, with Zimbabwe to the north, and its southern border is the Crocodile River.
The park covers 19,500 km² divided into 14 different eco-zones, each of which is home to different wildlife.
He is one of the most important attractions in South Africa and is called the flag bearer of South Africa's national parks (SANParks).
As in all National Parks in South Africa, the park has daily entrance and conservation fees.
You could also consider it worthwhile to buy a "Wild Card," which offers entry to any of the game reserves of South Africa or to all national parks of South Africa.
Hong Kong Island gives its name to the territory of Hong Kong and is considered the main destination by many tourists.
The parade of buildings that form the Hong Kong skyline is likened to a shimmering ribbon chart, highlighted by the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
To see the best views of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the Kowloon Pier across from it.
The majority of Hong Kong Island's urban development has been concentrated on reclaimed land along the north coast.
This is a place appropriated by the British colonizers, therefore, if you are looking for evidence of the colonial past of the territory, this is a suitable place to start.
The Sundarbans are the largest mangrove forest belt in the world, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast inland within the Bengali and Indian coastal zone.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. The forest in the Indian portion is called Sundarbans National Park.
Forests are not just forests with flowering trees; they include some of the last remaining parts of the great jungles that once covered the North Indian plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², approximately one-third of which is covered by water/lakes.
Since 1966, Sundarbans have been a refuge for wildlife, and it is estimated that around 400 Bengal tigers and about 30,000 deer are now found in the area.
Buses depart from the intercity bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although the majority, especially those traveling east towards Xhakar/Bumthang, depart from 6:30 AM to 7:30 AM.
It is advisable to buy the ticket a few days in advance, as intercity buses are often full.
Most of the regions receive services from small Japanese buses called "Coaster," which are comfortable and powerful.
Taking taxis together is a fast and comfortable way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Ojapok River bridge is a truss bridge. It spans the Ojapok River to connect the cities of Ojapock in Brazil and Saint-Georges d'Oiapoque in French Guiana.
Two towers rise to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two 3.50 m wide lanes.
The vertical space below the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but it did not open for traffic until March 2017.
The bridge is scheduled to be fully operational in September 2017, when the Brazilian customs inspection points are expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most important local group living in what is now Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced agriculture for survival.
The Chaco region was the habitat of other indigenous tribes such as the Guaykuru and Payagua, who sustained themselves by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, which was previously called the "Giant Province of India," was created as a result of the confrontation between the Spanish conquerors and the local indigenous groups.
The Spanish were the ones who started the period of colonization, a period that lasted for three centuries.
Since the founding of Asuncion in 1537, Paraguay has managed to preserve much of its indigenous identity and character.
Argentina is renowned for one of the best teams and players in polo in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year takes place in December on the polo fields in Las Canitas.
Here, smaller tournaments and matches can be seen even in other periods of the year.
For the latest information on polo tournaments and where to buy tickets for the matches, go to Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Folkland Islands is the Folkland pound (FKP), whose value is set equivalent to that of a British pound (GBP).
You can exchange money at the only bank on the island, which is located at Stanley, opposite the FIC West store.
British pounds are generally accepted everywhere on the islands, and within Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are also often accepted.
On the peripheral islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although the currency of Britain and the United States may be accepted. It is advisable to consult with owners beforehand to determine which payment method is accepted.
Outside of the Folkland Islands, it is almost impossible to exchange Folkland Island money, so exchange your money before you leave the islands.
Since Montevideo is south of the equator, it is summer there when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is in the subtropical zone. In the summer months, temperatures above +30°C are common.
Winter can have a chill that deceives you: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the air and humidity combine to make you think it's colder than it actually is, colder than the temperature the thermometer shows.
There aren't distinct seasons of "rainy" and "dry"; the level of rainfall is roughly the same throughout the year.
Although many of the animals in the park are accustomed to seeing people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park administration, you must stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from all other wild animals!
No matter how wise they may seem, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack you.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain the proper distance. These are wild animals, large and potentially dangerous, and for this reason, you should give them the necessary space.
Besides this, keep in mind that aromas attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid keeping or cooking food with strong smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is on the island of Upolu and has under 40,000 inhabitants.
Apia, founded in the 1850s, has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Porto was the site of a famous naval clash in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the United States, and Britain refused to leave the port.
All the ships were sunk, except for a British cruiser. Approximately 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the efforts for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful organization in the city brought about the assassination of the main leader Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to the stretch of Oakland between two harbors. The most popular ones are in three areas.
The beaches on North Shore (in the North Harbor district) are located on the Pacific Ocean and stretch from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
They are almost all sandy beaches and safe for swimming, and most have shade provided by pohutukaua trees.
The beaches along "Tamaki Drive" are in the Waitemata Harbour, in the elegant suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
These are family beaches, sometimes crowded with people and a variety of shops lined up along the coast. You can swim safely.
The main beer in the area is "Number One". It's not a complex beer, but it's refreshing and pleasant. The other local beer is called "Manta".
There are many French wines to enjoy, but New Zealand and Australian wines are easier to find.
Tap water from the faucet is completely safe to drink, but bottled water can be easily found if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a "simple black coffee" is something foreign. A short black coffee is an "espresso," cappuccino is served covered in cream (and not foam), and tea is served without milk.
Hot chocolate is up to Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but wonderful.
Throughout the year, many road trips are taken, and tire damage from any of these causes is rare.
However, once again, respect the advice of the authorities, respect all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
The jellyfish *Kubozoa* appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April in the Gulf of 1770, and occasionally outside of this period.
Otters exist, but they rarely attack people. The majority of otters are afraid of humans and swim away from them.
Crocodiles of saltwater do not actively live in the ocean. Their main habitat is the river mouths north of Rockhampton.
Advance booking allows the traveler to sleep soundly knowing they will have a place to sleep as soon as they arrive at their destination.
Often, travel agents have agreements with specific hotels, although you may find that it is possible to book other types of accommodation, such as campsites, through a travel agent.
Travel agents usually offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold the reservation for you if you need time to consider the offer or to arrange other documents for your destination (e.g., a visa).
However, any change or request must first go through the travel agent and not directly to the hotel.
For some festivals, the vast majority of attendees at music festivals decide to set up camp in the same place, and most attendees consider this an essential part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the activity, you will have to go early to find a campsite near the music.
Don't forget that even if the music may have ended on the main stages, there might be sections of the festival that will continue to play music late into the night.
Some festivals have designated camping areas for families with young children.
If you travel over the North Baltic Sea during winter, check where your cabin is located, as movement on the ice causes a very frightening noise for those who are more sensitive.
Cruises in St. Petersburg include time in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the time and money spent by guests. Typically, windows and hours are scarce, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment, to keep guests in good spirits and to keep them in their environment.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. But intoxication impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know how important it is to stay level-headed.
Anyone who drives a vehicle over large geographical areas or over mountain passes should be aware that there may be snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and you can't steer the vehicle as if you were on clean asphalt.

The stirrups are supports for the rider's feet that hang down on either side of the saddle.
They ensure better stability for the rider, but can be a problem for safety due to the possibility of the rider catching their feet in them.
If the rider falls from the horse but has their leg caught in the stirrup, they may be able to pull themselves out slowly if the horse moves away. To minimize this risk, several preliminary safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most motorcyclists wear heeled and polished, very tight boots.
Then, some sashes, especially English sashes, have safety ribbons that allow the belt of the saddle to fall from the sash if it is pulled back by the falling rider.

Consider the ski itinerary as a similar walking itinerary.
In good conditions, you might be able to cover slightly longer distances than by walking, but you'll rarely achieve the speeds of skiing on groomed slopes without a heavy backpack.
Europe is a continent that is relatively small, but has many independent states. Under normal circumstances, traveling to many countries would require visa applications and numerous passport checks.
Nevertheless, the Schengen area functions to a certain extent as a place in this regard.
As long as you don't leave this area, you can usually cross the borders without needing to go through passport control again.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not need to apply for a visa individually to each member state of the Schengen area, thus saving time, money, and documents.
There is no general definition of which manufactured items are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as goods older than 100 years.

Finland is a very good destination for boating. The "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelagos.
You don't necessarily need a yacht in these lakes and archipelagos.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly quite large for any yacht, smaller boats or even a kayak offer a different experience.
Boat trips are considered a national pastime in Finland, where there is a boat for every seven or eight people.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but apart from them, it's quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands this figure is one in forty).

The easiest way to get into first class or business class is to gather a large sum of money for this privilege (or, even better, to have the company do it for you).
Nevertheless, this doesn't come freely: as a rough general rule, you can expect to pay up to four times more than the normal economic rate for businesses and eleven times more for the first class!
