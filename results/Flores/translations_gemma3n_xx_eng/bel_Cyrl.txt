This not only confirms the popular theory about how at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides information that is usually impossible to obtain by studying fossils, such as information about the color and three-dimensional spatial arrangement of the feathers.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was chestnut-brown on top and had a pale or reddish-yellow hue on the other side.
This discovery allows for a better understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Because dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis (central shaft) but possess other feather features like barbs and barbules, researchers concluded that the rachis was likely a later evolutionary development compared to these other features.
Judging by the feather structure, one can conclude that it was not used for flight, but rather to regulate temperature or attract attention. Researchers suggest that even contrary to it being the tail of a young dinosaur, the samples show not down feathers of a chick, but adult plumage.
Researchers suggest that, although it was the tail of a young dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers of an adult animal, not down from a chick.

The voting process in France has traditionally not been high-tech. Voters would go into a booth to retrieve a pre-printed sheet of paper with the name of the respective candidate marked on it, and then place it in an envelope.
After the voter is identified by officials, the voter then drops the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter registry.
This entire procedure is carried out in strict accordance with French electoral law.
Since 1988, ballot boxes must be transparent. This is done so that voters and observers can verify that at the start of voting, there were no envelopes in the boxes and that no other envelopes (other than those dropped into the ballot boxes by duly authorized and counted voters) were deposited there.
To certify each stage of the process, candidates may send their representatives. In the evening, carrying out specific procedures, volunteers under strict supervision count the votes.

According to some reports, eight people have died. Official reports estimate around 30 injuries. However, the final figures are currently unknown.
In the remains of domestic animals that died after consuming contaminated feed, both cyanuric acid and melamine were found.
Researchers from the university have announced that these two compounds react with each other and form crystals that can block the function of the kidneys.
Upon the addition of melanin and cyanuric acid to feline urine, the researchers observed the formation of crystals.
As a result of the infrared spectral analysis, the structure and composition of these crystals are similar to the structures and compositions found in the muscles of the affected animals.
I don't know if it's clear to you or not, but the majority of goods delivered to this country from Central America are not subject to customs duties.
At the same time, eighty percent of our goods in Central America were subject to taxes.
It seemed pointless to me and, of course, unfair.
I always tell people – treat others as you would like to be treated.

He was eventually transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoja has been in the Sheriff Court in Edinburgh ever since, as she is accused of murdering her son.
She awaits indictment and trial while under guard. However, considering that her photographs have been published widely, any eyewitness testimony may be cast into doubt.
In other regions of Great Britain, this is an established practice, however, in Scotland the judiciary operates differently – courts believe that the publication of photographs could potentially be harmful.
"It seems that journalists are walking a dangerous path when they publish photos, etc., of suspects," notes Professor Pamela Ferguson.
The Central Chancellery of the Supreme Court, authorized to initiate criminal proceedings, informed journalists that, at the moment, no further comments can be obtained until an indictment is presented.
According to the received information, the document mentions a border dispute that Palestine wants to resolve in such a way as to maintain the borders that existed before the outbreak of the 1967 war in the Middle East.
According to the received information, among other topics covered by the document are the future status of Jerusalem, holy to both peoples, as well as the issue of the Jordan River Valley.
Israel demands that military presence in the valley be maintained for ten years after the signing of the agreement, while Palestine agrees to only five years.

Marteli yesterday swore in the new Temporary Electoral Council, which consists of nine members.
This is already the fifth Election Time Council of Marteyeva in four years.
The Presidential Commission last month recommended the early dissolution of the Temporarily Elected Council as one of several measures to prepare the country for new elections.
Martely responded with a commission to the large anti-government protests that began in October.
The cause of the protest actions, which were sometimes turbulent and fierce, was the absence of elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Approximately 60 cases of overheating defective iPods were registered. This led to the outbreak of six fires, and four people received minor burns.
According to a statement by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan (METI), information about the 27 accidents that occurred as a result of the use of the devices was included in them.
Last week, the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan announced that it had received a report from Apple regarding 34 new overheating cases, which the company deemed "minor."
In response, the ministry called the company "Apple's" postponement of its report to a later date "worthy of sincere regret."

A former Filipino police officer hijacked a bus in the capital of the Philippines, Manila, and took tourists from Hong Kong hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired on tourists with his M16.
Several hostages were rescued, and so far, according to confirmed data, at least six were killed.
Six hostages, including elderly people and children, as well as photographers from the Philippines, were released early.
An elderly woman needed to go to the restroom, so the photographers were left hostage instead of her. Mendoza was shot.
Ligins followed in his father's footsteps and became a doctor.
He studied to be an obstetrician and in 1959 began working at the National Women's Hospital of Oakland.
When Lihins worked in the hospital, in his free time he began to study the problem of premature births.
According to his research, the introduction of the hormone accelerates the maturation of the embryo's lungs.
According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, government investigators found two so-called "black boxes" - flight data recorders - on Wednesday.
The Moon's memory was also honored by her wrestling colleagues.
"Luna was the first queen of extreme. Our first manager. She left this life in the night of two months. It's quite original, like she herself. Luna was a strong woman," said Tony Dreamer.
Dustin "Goldust" Rance noted: "Luna was quite a girl, no less than me... maybe even more... I love her and I will miss her... I want to believe she is in a better place right now."
The number of people who oppose Australia becoming a republic has increased by 8 percent since 2008 (according to a survey of 1400 people conducted before the federal election in 2010).
During the 2010 federal election campaign, Julia Gillard, acting as Prime Minister, stated that, in her opinion, at the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign, Australia should become a republic.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of survey participants. They want Queen Elizabeth II to be the last Australian monarch.
The most radical views were expressed by 29 percent of those surveyed, who believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, and another 31 percent who, on the contrary, adhere to the opinion that this should never happen.
It was expected that the Olympic gold medalist in the 100m and 200m freestyle would participate in three relays during the Commonwealth Games, but his physical condition raises doubts: he has complained quite a bit about his health.
He wasn't able to take painkillers because they are prohibited at the Games.
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor from the University of Missouri–Columbia, discovered the largest prime number known to date.
This discovery was confirmed by several people with the help of various hardware and software by early February, and it was announced on Tuesday.
It is assumed that comets could have brought not only organic matter to Earth, which can form proteins and serve as a source of life support, but also water.
Considering that comets collided with Earth in the distant past, scientists hope to understand the process of planet formation, primarily that of Earth.
Slightly earlier this year, 53-year-old Cuomo was elected governor. He signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He dubbed these rumors "political babble and foolishness."
It is expected that he will run for president in 2016.
The Federal Aviation Administration announces that thanks to the NextGen system, aircraft will be able to fly on shorter routes, which will help save millions of liters of fuel each year and reduce carbon emissions.
Unlike old ground-based radar systems, it uses satellite technology, which allows air traffic controllers to determine the location of aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
The number of vehicles is not increasing, and наземные trains will not stop at Wembley; moreover, there is no parking for cars at ground level, nor is there a transit parking lot.
The probability of having to play the game behind closed doors without fans increased, as it is entirely possible that there won't be enough transportation.
A study published Thursday in the journal "Science" describes the formation of a new species of birds on the Ecuadorian Galapagos Islands.
According to reports from researchers at Princeton University (USA) and Uppsala University (Sweden), the evolution of a new species occurred in just two generations, although it was previously believed that this process required much more time. The emergence of a new species became possible thanks to the hybridization of the endemic ground finch (Geospiza fortes) with the non-native cactus ground finch (Geospiza conirostris).
Gold can be cast into various shapes. It can be rolled into thin sheets.
It can be drawn into a thin wire, which can then be easily twisted and braided. It can also be frayed or rolled into sheets.
It could be made very thin and attached to another metal. It could be so thin that, from time to time, it was used to decorate illustrated manuscripts in books – so-called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called the pH level of a certain chemical substance. You can make such an acid-base indicator yourself from red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on the level of acidity or alkalinity of a particular substance.
The pH level of a test chemical substance is determined based on the amount of hydrogen ions (the letter "H" in pH).
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (as is known, an atom of hydrogen consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix these two dry powders in a circle until they combine into one whole, and then form a ball with them using wet hands.
The moisture on your hands reacts with the outer layers, creating a strange sensation. At the same time, a kind of shell is formed.
Almost every house in the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had a flush toilet connected to a complex sewage system.
Remains of sewage systems have been found in houses of the Minoan period in the cities of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets were also used in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman Empire, toilets were sometimes installed in public baths where women and men were together.
You use a satellite when you call someone who is thousands of kilometers away from you.
In space, the satellite receives a call, after which it almost instantaneously reflects it back.
A rocket was used to launch a satellite into space. Scientists have to use telescopes in space because the light is refracted and the image is distorted due to the influence of the Earth's atmosphere.
In order for a telescope or satellite to reach space, a colossal rocket more than 100 feet tall is needed.
The wheel changed the world in an incredible way. Lighter and faster transportation – that's the greatest thing the wheel has done for us.
Thanks to it, we have trains, cars, and many other vehicles.
Below are cats of medium size. Their prey is also of medium size—they hunt both hares and antelopes with deer.
In addition to all of this, many small cats (including feral domestic cats) catch and eat a greater variety of small prey – insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret of their success lies in each person occupying their own niche, that is, having a function that is unique to them, and therefore they do not need to compete with other people.
Lions are one of the most sociable cats: they live in large groups known as prides.
A pride can consist of up to three adult males who are relatives, as well as up to thirty females and young.
In most cases, females are close relatives, forming a large family of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides and wolf or dog packs is quite similar in many respects. The latter can strongly resemble lions (but not other large cats) in how they present a mortal danger to their prey.
A tiger is capable of climbing (though not as well), jumping across large distances, swimming, and pulling with a strength five times greater than that of a very strong man, like a well-trained athlete.
The tiger belongs to the same group as lions, leopards, and jaguars (the genus Panthera). No other cats, besides these four, can roar.
The roar of a tiger is more like a sharp, loud phrase than the full-throated roar of a lion.
Ocelots eat small animals. If there is an opportunity, they catch monkeys, rodents, snakes, and birds. Almost all the animals they hunt are much smaller than an ocelot.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and find their prey by scent, sniffing out traces on the ground.
Thanks to their nocturnal vision, they see well in the dark and move very confidently. Ocelots hunt, blending in with their surroundings and attacking their prey from hiding.
When a small group of living organisms (a small population) becomes isolated from the main population from which they originated (for example, by migrating across a river or mountain range, or when these living organisms migrate to a new island, so that it will be quite difficult for them to return), they often find themselves in an environment that is significantly different from where they came from.
In this new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so in order to become a strong competitor itself, the new population will need different traits or adaptations compared to those it had before.
The original population hasn't changed at all: as before, it still needs to adapt.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to the new environment, the animals increasingly resemble the original population from which they diverged.
Thousands, or even millions, of years may pass, and sooner or later, the two aforementioned populations will look so different that no one will even think of classifying them as the same species.
This process we call speciation, which actually means the emergence of new species. Speciation is an inevitable outcome and a very important stage in evolution.
Plants produce oxygen, which people breathe. They also absorb carbon dioxide, which people exhale.
Plants "prepare" their food from sunlight through photosynthesis. In addition, they provide shade.
We build houses from plants and make clothing from them. We eat plants primarily. And animals also wouldn't survive without plants.
For their time, mosasaurs were apex predators, so they feared nothing and no one, except for other mosasaurs.
His long canines were adorned with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, and there was another additional row in the upper part of his mouth. This meant that his prey would not have been able to escape.
It is not exactly known, however it is possible that he had a bifurcated tongue. The diet of mosasaurs consisted of large fish, turtles, and other mosasaurs. It is likely that they also consumed members of their own species.
Besides that, he pounced on everything that fell into the water; his snout wasn't worthy of even a giant like Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Despite the fact that their food was mostly not surprising to us, some dishes were, to put it mildly, unusual. Among them were wild game, peacock, snails, and a rodent known as the hazel dormouse.
Another difference lay in the fact that while the poor and women ate sitting in chairs, the wealthy held banquets where they ate and rested simultaneously.
The dishes prepared in Ancient Rome could not include products that arrived in Europe from America or Asia later.
They didn't have, in particular, any potatoes, tomatoes, corn, or cocoa. It should also be added that no ancient Roman ever had the opportunity to taste turkey.
The inhabitants of Babylon built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered their home.
Worshippers brought sacrifices to their deities, and priests tried to satisfy their needs by holding various festivals and ceremonies in their honor.
Every church had its own open inner courtyard and sanctuary, which only priests could visit.
In some cases, special towers resembling pyramids were built during the construction of temples. They were known as ziggurats.
The top of the tower was a special sanctuary dedicated to a god.
In the warm climate of the Near East, the house did not have great significance.
Mostly, Jewish families' lives took place in the fresh air.
Women cooked outdoors; the shops were simply open stalls facing the street. The houses were built of stone.
In Canaan, there were no large forests, therefore timber was very valuable.
The territory of Greenland was not densely populated. According to the Scandinavian sagas, Erik the Red was expelled from Iceland for murder, and while sailing west, he came across Greenland, which he called "Greenland".
But regardless of his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already been living there at that time.
Between the peoples, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland, there were many differences, despite each of these countries being "Scandinavian."
If you watched the movie "National Treasure," you might think that the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence was a treasure map.
However, this does not correspond to reality. Even though something is really written on the reverse side of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the Declaration of Independence, on the reverse side, it was written: "The original draft of the Declaration of Independence from July 4, 1776." The inscription in reverse is located at the bottom of the document.
Who wrote it is unknown, but it is known that the large parchment document (29 3/4 inches by 24 1/2 inches) was rolled up for preservation at the beginning of its existence.
Therefore, it is entirely possible that this entry was added there simply as a note.
Thanks to the Normandy landings and subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the southern part of the country was still under occupation.
He was under the influence of the "Vichyites." These were those Frenchmen who, in 1940, made peace with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
On August 15, 1940, Operation Dragoon began - the allies landed in southern France.
Americans and the forces of "Free France" liberated the southern territories of France in just two weeks, after which they moved towards Germany.
Civilization is a single culture of a fairly large group of people who work and live together in a society.
The aforementioned term "civilization" comes from the Latin word *civilis*, meaning "citizenly." The latter is similar in meaning to the Latin noun *civis*, meaning "citizen," as well as to the noun *civitas*, i.e., "city" or "city-state." All of this, in turn, in one way or another, says something about the size of a society.
City-states are the precursors of nations. Civilizational culture implies the transmission of knowledge across generations, its even distribution, and a sustainable cultural legacy.
Often, small cultures are not considered civilizations in the full sense of the word, because they disappear without leaving significant historical evidence behind.
During the War of Independence, thirteen states initially established a weak central government in accordance with the Articles of Confederation of the thirteen United States. The Congress was the only body within this government.
Congress had no authority to introduce taxes, and since there was no national executive and judicial power, it counted on ensuring the enforcement of all laws with the support of state bodies, which were often not inclined to cooperate.
Moreover, he lacked the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs introduced by the states.
According to the Treaty of Confederation for Amendments, unanimous consent of all states was required, and the states took the central government so little seriously that their representatives often did not attend.
The Italian national football team, like the German national team, holds second place among the strongest teams in the world. In 2006, it won the FIFA World Cup.
Football, basketball, volleyball, fencing, rugby, water polo, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 racing are popular sports here.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, although Italians also participate in international games and Olympic competitions.
Japan is located on almost 7,000 islands, the largest of which is Honshu Island. Thanks to this, Japan holds the 7th place in the world among the largest islands.
Japan is often called an "archipelago" from a geographical point of view, because it consists of a cluster or group of islands.
The history of Taiwan began as early as the 15th century. It was then that its name was recorded by European sailors passing by as "Formosa," which means "beautiful island."
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and initiated a reform of primitive farming practices. To cultivate rice and sugar plantations, the company hired Chinese workers.
The Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) seized western and northern Taiwanese territories in 1683 and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government concluded the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, according to which Japan was granted sovereignty over the island, and the latter governed Taiwan until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room with Three Windows.
So that tourists could get a better idea of what most of the buildings in the complex originally looked like, the last ones were reconstructed.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored. Restoration work continues to this day.
Yes, the most popular photo format in the world for still images is the 35 mm format. During the decline of the era of analog photography, this film format was dominant.
This type of film is still produced today, however, what is more important is that its aspect ratio is now used in the formats of digital camera matrices.
This might be a little disorienting, but in fact, the 35mm format is 36mm wide and 24mm high.
Accordingly, the ratio of the sides for this format (after dividing by twelve to obtain a simpler proportion of whole numbers) is 3:2.
Similar or equal ratios of sides are found in many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats).
The rule of thirds, which is often subjected to criticism and mockery, represents simple tips that ensure dynamism and simultaneously maintain a certain degree of order in the image.
If you believe him, the best place to position the main subject is at the intersection of lines that divide the photograph into thirds in both vertical and horizontal planes (see example).
During this period of European history, the activities of the Catholic Church came under close scrutiny, as it became wealthy and powerful.
Despite all the linguistic and cultural differences that existed, Christianity united European countries for over a thousand years.
Everyone – from the king to the commoner – was under her all-pervading power.
The essence of one of the main dogmas of Christianity lies in the fact that wealth should be used to alleviate poverty and ease suffering, and that it is precisely for this purpose that the church's funds exist.
For over a thousand years, the central church authorities were located in Rome. Due to this concentration of power and money, many question whether this dogma is upheld.
Great Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany shortly after the start of hostilities.
Although the embargo on the supply of life-essential goods for military and civilian use violated generally recognized international law, which has been enshrined in legislative form by several international agreements over the last two centuries, it turned out to be an effective strategy.
The United Kingdom has mined international waters to prevent ships from entering certain areas of the ocean. In doing so, it has endangered even neutral vessels.
Due to the lack of a significant reaction to this tactic, Germany deemed that it would not face unlimited underwater military operations either.
Among the majority of citizens and countries during the 1920s, sentiments of pacifism and isolationism prevailed.
States and peoples intended to avoid such a situation in the future, having already witnessed the horrors and atrocities during the First World War.
Tesla moved to the United States of America in 1884 because he got a job at Edison's company, which was located in New York.
He had only four cents, a collection of poems and a letter of recommendation to Thomas Edison, written by Charles Béchalier (his manager from his previous place of work), in his pocket when he arrived in the US.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to denote different eras. At each stage of Chinese history or within each family under the rule, distinctive dynasties existed.
Moreover, the periods of dynasties were interspersed with periods of divided provinces, during which instability prevailed. The most famous of these was the Three Kingdoms period, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During the aforementioned periods, many nobles who fought for the throne waged relentless warfare against each other.
One of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China was the Three Kingdoms period: thousands of people died during the struggle for the opportunity to occupy the highest position in the grand palace in Xichang.
The French Revolution had many social and political consequences. Among them were the transition from absolutism to a republican system of government, the introduction of the metric system, the rise of nationalism, and the belief that the country belonged not to a single ruler, but to the entire people.
Furthermore, various positions after the Revolution became accessible to all male candidates, as a result of which the most successful and ambitious individuals climbed to the top.
The same thing happened in the army, because if earlier military ranks were awarded based on seniority, now they are based on skills and abilities.
Moreover, the French Revolution inspired many other oppressed workers from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in questions that went beyond worldly life. To engage in meditation and contemplation, he often visited a cave on Mount Nour (translated as "light"), known as "Hira".
The very past, which has stood the test of time, gives a very vivid idea of the spiritual foundations of Muhammad.
Yesterday was completely isolated from the rest of the world—it is located on the summit of one of the mountains north of Mecca.
Actually, it's very difficult to find her, even if someone knows about her existence. Inside the cave, you are in complete isolation.
You won't see anything but the clear, beautiful sky above and the many surrounding mountains from the cave. From the cave, you can see and hear very little of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World to still exist today.
The Great Pyramid is one of many pyramids that were erected to honor the memory of the deceased pharaoh. It was built in the 3rd century BC.
On the Giza plateau, also known as the "Giza Necropolis," in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, there are several pyramids (the largest of which is the Great Pyramid), a number of smaller tombs, several temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The construction of the Great Pyramid was dedicated to the memory of Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, temples, and tombs were for the wives and family members of the pharaoh.
The sign that indicates a bow stroke upwards looks like a "V", and downwards like a bracket or square without a bottom.
"Movement of the bowstring upwards" means you should start the movement from the end of the bowstring and pull it upwards, while "movement of the bowstring downwards" means you should start from the handhold (the place where your hand holds the bowstring) and pull the bowstring downwards.
A closing movement upwards usually produces a softer sound, while downwards produces a stronger and more confident one.
You can mark your answers with a pencil, but don't forget that the printed symbols of the musical notation are not there just like that, but for a specific musical reason, so you usually need to preserve them.
On October 6, 1789, the king Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (four-year-old Louis-Charles and 11-year-old Marie Therese), as well as Madame Elizabeth, the king's sister, were forced to return from Versailles to Paris due to a crowd of women from the market.
The royal family was taken to Paris in a carriage. Along the way, they were surrounded by a crowd – people in it whistled, lamented, and shouted threats at the king and queen.
The king and queen had to open the carriage windows under the influence of the crowd.
At one point, someone from the crowd waved the head of the guard killed at Versailles in front of the queen, who was already terrified to death.
The military expenses of the imperialist USA, incurred in connection with the conquest of the Philippines, had to be paid by the Filipinos themselves.
To pay a significant portion of the expenses and interest on bonds issued by Wall Street banks on behalf of the Philippine government, they had to pay taxes to the colonial regime of the United States.
Undoubtedly, the main achievement of the US imperialists would be the excessive profits brought by the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people.
To imagine who the Templars were, it's necessary to understand well what the preconditions for the creation of the order were.
Traditionally, the period in which these events occurred is called the Classical Middle Ages—this is a period in European history spanning the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
Initially came the Early Middle Ages, followed by the High Middle Ages, and then the Late Middle Ages. The latter, as it is generally accepted, ended around 1500 AD.
The term "technological determinism" encompasses a whole range of practical ideas, from the pressure to promote certain technologies or technical necessity to a precise understanding of the fact that human destiny is determined by the logic on which scientific laws are based and their embodiment in the sphere of technology.
Two common ideas characterize most interpretations of technological determinism: the development of technology largely proceeds beyond the boundaries of cultural or political influence, and technologies, in turn, exert an influence on society that is specific to them (and not socially determined).
In particular, there is an opinion that the use of cars stimulates the development of roads.
Nevertheless, if the number of vehicles is small, a national network of roads does not make economic sense. For this reason, new manufacturing methods are being developed that will allow to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Due to the large number of car owners, the number of road accidents is growing. This, in turn, leads to the development of new methods in the healthcare sector that allow for the treatment of various injuries.
A significant element of cultural determinism, influenced by the works of writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel, was characteristic of Romanticism.
When discussing the Romantic era, the geography of a place strongly influenced people. Over time, traditions and culture arose that were connected to it. They were better than arbitrarily imposed laws, because they existed in harmony with the place and circumstances that society occupied.
While Paris is considered the modern capital of fashion, Constantinople was known as the fashion capital of Europe in feudal times.
Around 400 AD, the city gained fame as a center of luxury and maintained this status until almost 1100 AD.
Throughout the 12th century, his status as a city of luxury faded. This happened mainly because the Crusaders returned with gifts, among which were spices and silk, which were valued much higher than what was offered in the markets of Byzantium.
It was then that Constantinople became the title of the fashion capital of Paris.
The flourishing of Gothic style fell within the period between the 10th and 11th centuries, as well as the 14th century.
Initially, the Eastern Byzantine culture had a strong influence on clothing style.
However, Western trends may be delayed by 25-30 years due to slow communication channels.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. The fact that people, as a result of the Crusades, began to use buttons to fasten clothes became one of the most significant events of that time.
In natural farming, the amount of food produced is sufficient only to meet the needs of the farmer and their family.
Natural farming is a simple and, as a rule, organic system. It is based on the use of locally adapted preserved seeds in combination with crop rotation or other quite simple methods. The goal of all this is to achieve maximum yield.
Many farmers historically ran traditional rural farms. Many countries in the developing world still practice this today.
Subcultures bring together people with similar views who feel deprived of attention from the perspective of social norms, and allow them to develop a sense of individuality.
Age, ethnicity, social class, location, and (or) gender of representatives can be distinctive features of subcultures.
The definition of a distinct subculture can occur based on various factors – linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or their combination.
Members of the same subculture often define their belonging to it through a distinctive and symbolic style of dress, manner of behavior, and jargon.
As an illustration of what socialization entails and how important it is, examples are most often drawn from children who haven't been fortunate enough to grow up in an atmosphere of contempt, neglect, various misfortunes, or humiliation, and who were not socialized by adults in childhood.
Children like this are called "wild." Some "wild" children spent a long time in neglect (usually this is how their own parents treated them); in some cases, the absence of parental care was the result of parents' unwillingness to notice serious physical or intellectual disorders and shortcomings in the child.
Before they were abandoned or escaped, the feral children may have suffered serious abuse or experienced trauma.
Others, it seemed, were raised by animals; rumor had it that some lived independently in the wild.
If a child was entirely raised by animals, their behavior in almost every way (taking into account physical limitations) mirrors the behavior of the animal that raised them: for example, such a child might be afraid of people or indifferent to them.
While the goal of project-based learning is to make the learning process easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes even further in this regard.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a facilitator that helps people gain new experience in learning. This can mean using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Assistants can be both real and virtual. For example, a teacher and the small clip art in the Microsoft Office program are assistants.
The software includes virtual assistants. They are needed to ask questions, provide hints, and explain procedures that students or listeners find difficult to understand on their own.
There are many reasons why children may end up in foster families. This can be due to harsh treatment, neglect, and even coercion.
It must not be allowed for children to grow up in an environment where no one cares for them, they are not raised, and their education is not pursued, but this is still happening.
In our opinion, the foster family system is a safe zone for such children.
It is estimated that thanks to our foster family system, wards will have reliable medical care, safe homes, good and caring foster parents, and stable education.
It is considered that the foster family must provide for all the child's needs that were not met in the home from which they were taken.
The internet is not only a means of mass communication, but also interpersonal communication.
Thanks to the unique characteristics of the Internet, additional opportunities for its use and meeting the needs of the audience arise.
Yes, for example, the opinion is expressed that such concepts as "education" and "socialization" are important motives for using the Internet (James et al., 1995).
The concepts of "personal involvement" and "stable relationships" were also defined by Amy and McCord (1998) as new aspects of motivation in studying audience reaction to websites.
Thanks to the video recording, important discoveries were made in the interpretation of microexpressions—specifically, the movements of facial muscles lasting only a few milliseconds.
It is claimed, among other things, that the correct interpretation of microexpressions can help determine whether a person is lying or telling the truth.
In his work "The President's Stroke," Oliver Sacks noted that people with damaged brains, who do not understand language itself, can nevertheless accurately assess sincerity.
He even speculates that animals – for example, domestic dogs – might also be capable of correctly interpreting human behavior.
The results of 20th-century research indicate that there are two pools of genetic variation, namely, apparent and hidden variations.
Under the influence of mutation, new genetic variations arise, and with the help of selection, they are eliminated from the pool of identified ones.
With each successive generation, segregation and recombination shuffle the variations within these two pools.
The plant resources available in the shroud cannot satisfy the primates' need for amino acids if their digestive system is similar to that of humans.
Moreover, if they fail, the consequences are serious. This includes malnutrition, growth depression, and inevitable death.
The most accessible plant-based resources would be proteins found in legumes and leafy greens. However, if not properly prepared, they are difficult for organisms like us to absorb.
Conversely, animal-derived food (ants, termites, eggs) provides the body with a large amount of protein, rich in all essential amino acids and is easily digestible.
Judging by everything, there's no reason to be surprised if it turns out that our ancestors solved their own "protein problem" in almost the same way that chimpanzees in the savanna do nowadays.
Sleep fragmentation refers to the intentional awakening of a sleeping person during normal sleep and subsequent falling back asleep within a short period of time (from 10 to 60 minutes).
This can be achieved with the help of a relatively quiet alarm clock that will wake you up, but not fully.
If it turns out that you are translating the clock in your sleep, try putting it at the other end of the room. This way, you will have to get out of bed to turn it off.
According to other variants based on biorhythms, it is necessary to consume a lot of fluids (primarily water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed – this forces a person to get up at night to urinate.
A person's inner peace is inversely proportional to the tension of their body and mind.
The vital force is more positive the lower the tension. Absolute peace and satisfaction are accessible to everyone.
Enlightenment can be achieved by anyone. The only obstacle on this path is our own negativity and tension.
At the core of Tibetan Buddhism lies the teaching of the Buddha, which has been supplemented by the loving-kindness of Mahayana and a series of methods from Indian yoga.
The essence of Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It combines meditation, Kundalini yoga, and love for all of humanity.
Followers of Kundalini Yoga claim that to awaken the Kundalini energy (energy of illumination), one must practice specific yoga poses, mantras, and visualizations, as well as perform breathing exercises.
Divine yoga is a key component of Tibetan meditation practice. Visualizing various deities helps to cleanse energy channels, open chakras, and achieve enlightened consciousness.
During World War II, Germany was a common enemy, thanks to which the USSR and the USA began to cooperate. After the war, systemic, industrial, and cultural contradictions led to disputes between the countries.
Two years after the end of the fighting, the Cold War begins – former allies turn into enemies.
It lasted for the next 40 years, and truly armies of friendly countries fought in it. Battlefields were located in various regions – from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
The Polish defense was broken by September 17, 1939. Retreat and regrouping along the Romanian positions remained the only hope.
Nevertheless, within a single night these plans lost their meaning, as over 800,000 soldiers of the Red Army, as part of the Belorussian and Ukrainian fronts, invaded the territory of the eastern regions of Poland, violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Pact of Non-Aggression, and other bilateral and multilateral international agreements.
Ship transport of goods is clearly the most effective way to transport large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
Traditionally, the task of the naval forces was to ensure that their country would be able to transport people and goods, and at the same time, the enemy would not be able to transport their people and goods.
The North Atlantic Company during World War II became one of the most significant examples of this idea. With the aim of helping Great Britain, the Americans tried to transport people and materials across the Atlantic Ocean.
At the same time, the German Navy tried to stop the aforementioned movement, primarily using submarines for this purpose.
Germany, it is likely, could have conquered Great Britain in the same way it conquered the rest of Europe if the allies had failed.
It's similar to the fact that goats were first domesticated in the Zagros Mountains of Iran around 10,000 years ago.
Representatives of ancient cultures and tribes began to breed them to always have milk, wool, meat, and hides on hand.
Normally, domestic goats grazed in herds that roamed the hills or other pastures. Often, they were tended to by goat herders – children or teenagers. The latter played the role of shepherds. Livestock is grazed this way even today.
Sound roads were built in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the roads were merely parallel wooden planks, they allowed draft horses to move with greater speed and haul heavier loads than on the existing uneven roads.
Sleepers began to be used to hold the rails in place quite early. However, after some time it became clear that the movement on the rails would be more efficient if they were covered with a strip of iron.
This practice became widespread, however, due to the presence of iron, the wooden wheels of the wagons wore out faster.
After some time, iron wheels replaced wooden ones. The first rails completely made of metal appeared in 1767.
The first known means of transportation was walking. Two million years ago, with the emergence of Homo erectus (which means "upright man"), people began to walk on two legs.
Australopithecus, their ancestors, typically did not walk upright.
Direct-walking individuals of Australopithecus have been found in fossils, the age of which is 4.2–3.9 million years, but it is entirely possible that Sahelanthropus already walked on two legs seven million years ago.
We can try to be more mindful of the environment, we can become a participant in the ecological movement, we can even become an activist so that the mentioned suffering in the future do not turn out to be very severe.
Often, this looks more like symptomatic treatment. However, if we need not just a temporary solution, then we must find and eliminate the root cause of the problems.
It is quite obvious that thanks to technical and scientific achievements of humanity, the world has changed significantly. As a result of overpopulation and a wasteful lifestyle, the number of problems has increased.
After the declaration was adopted by Congress on July 4th, its handwritten copy, signed by Speaker of Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was delivered to the printing house of John Dunlap, which was a few blocks away.
During the night, between 150 and 200 copies were made, now known as the "Dunlap Sheet."
On July 8th, John Nixon publicly read this document for the first time on the grounds of Independence Hall.
On July 6th, George Washington received one of the copies, which he read to his troops in New York on July 9th. On August 10th, another copy arrived in London.
By our time, 25 of the first printed copies of the Declaration of Independence (known as Dunlap broadsides) have survived. The original handwritten copy has not been preserved.
Many modern paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs managed to survive and that it even still exists, we just call them birds.
Because of their feathers and ability to fly, many people don't consider them dinosaurs.
But birds have many common features with dinosaurs by this time.
They have claws and scales on their legs, lay eggs, and, like a Tyrannosaurus Rex, walk on two back legs.
Practically all modern computers perform operations with information encoded in binary numbers.
A binary number can consist of only one of two values – 0 or 1 – and these numbers are called binary digits, or (in computer jargon) bits.
Internal poisoning may not have obvious signs. For example, vomiting is a fairly common symptom, which makes it impossible to make an immediate diagnosis.
An open container with pills or toxic household chemicals can first indicate internal poisoning.
Instructions for providing emergency medical care for this specific poison should be consulted on the label.
To designate this group of insects, entomologists use the term "cockroach" in a formal sense.
This term arose because people have long known what bedbugs are – these insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing on humans.
Like kissing bugs, bed bugs are nesting parasites; they are accustomed to living in nests or in the home of their host.
Approximately 400,000 cases of multiple sclerosis (MS) are registered in the United States of America. Accordingly, this non-neurological disease is the most common among adults of young and middle age.
рассеяны склероз is a disease that affects the nervous system. The nervous system includes the brain and spinal cord, as well as the optic nerve.
The study results showed that women are twice as likely as men to suffer from rheumatoid arthritis.
A couple may come to the conclusion that raising a baby does not align with their interests or the interests of the child they already have.
Such couples may give their child up for adoption.
Upon adoption, the biological parents of the child renounce their parental rights so that other spouses can raise and nurture them.
The main goal of science is to elucidate the way the world functions through the scientific method. In fact, the majority of scientific research is conducted using this method.
However, he is not the only one. An experiment (which is a test conducted to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses using questions and observations) also directs and stimulates scientific research.
Above all, philosophers and natural scientists paid close attention to the classical texts. First and foremost, this includes the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including the field of psychology, were generally accepted at the time.
If the number of people who spoke Greek decreased, the West found itself detached from its scientific and philosophical roots.
Many biorhythms that can be observed in the behavior and physiology of animals largely depend on the presence of endogenous cycles. The latter arise as a result of the functioning of the biological clock.
In most living organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals, periodic rhythms have been recorded that are not a direct reaction to external periodic signals.
The biological clock represents an autonomous process. Even when external signals do not arrive, the aforementioned process continues in the form of independent free-running cycles.
One of the main hypotheses, which claimed that DNA is the genetic material, was tested in the course of the Hershey-Chase experiment.
For the implantation of their own DNA into the Hershey-Chase bacteriophages, they used phages or viruses.
They conducted two experiments in which the DNA of a bacteriophage was labeled with radioactive phosphorus, or the protein of a bacteriophage with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the fragment of genetic material in which the mutation occurred, and whether the affected cells are cells of the germ line, mutations can have very different consequences.
Only mutations in germ cells can be hereditary. The result of other mutations can be cell death or cancer.
Ecotourism attracts people who are interested in visiting different natural areas and territories, because they want to enjoy the overall view and landscape, including delighting in observing flora and fauna.
As an example of what can be done in nature, one can cite fishing, hunting, bird watching, visiting parks, and studying ecosystems.
As an example, one can cite the visit, study, and photography of orangutans on the island of Borneo.
People every morning drive on their cars from small provincial towns to go to work. On the way, other people passing by them are going to the place where they just left.
In this dynamic transport cycle, everyone has some connection to the private automobile-based transport system and supports it.
Scientific data indicate that the modern high-carbon economy has disrupted the stability of the biosphere, which has significantly contributed to human evolution over the last two million years.
Transport systems are used by all people who participate in the life of society. And almost all of them are dissatisfied with these transport systems.
In developed countries, you will hardly hear so many complaints about bridge collapses or water quality.
Why are transport systems a constant source of similar complaints, why do they regularly stop functioning? Is the reason due to a lack of competent transport engineers? Or is something more fundamental happening?
The concept of "traffic" implies the analysis of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points, as well as the study of how they interact with each other.
Unfortunately, studying transport flows presents a complex problem because it is impossible to predict driver behavior with absolute certainty.
Drivers, fortunately, usually behave quite consistently; therefore, traffic flows are typically characterized by a certain rationally determined consistency and can be approximately described using mathematical models.
To more fully and accurately depict what the movement of vehicles entails, three of its main parameters were established as being interconnected: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
The availability of these connections helps to plan and design road facilities, as well as manage their operation.
Invertebrates were the first animals to take to the air. The ability to fly helped them more effectively avoid enemies, as well as find partners and food.
In most cases, the wings of insects fold along the body.
Thanks to this, they can squeeze into very small places to hide from predators.
Dragonflies and mayflies are the only insects today that cannot form wings.
A man named Aristarchus claimed several thousand years ago that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some believed he was right, however many adhered to a different view – that the Solar System (including the Sun and other stars) revolves around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable, because, being on Earth, it's hard to claim that it's moving, isn't it?
The Amazon River holds the second place in the world in terms of length among all other rivers and is the largest of them. Its water volume is 8 times greater than that of the river that holds the second place.
The Amazon is the widest river on Earth, with its width sometimes reaching six miles.
The Amazon is a source of at least 20 percent of all the water that flows into the oceans from the planet's rivers.
The Amazon River, into which waters from thousands of smaller rivers flow, is 6387 km (3980 miles) long.
Although the construction of pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, no one has ever been able to surpass the size and technical perfection of the pyramids of Giza.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were filled with admiration for the monuments erected by their ancestors, the age of which at that time exceeded a thousand years.
In the Vatican, there are only about 800 people living. It is the world's smallest independent country with the smallest population.
Italian is used in legislation and official communications of the Vatican.
Most of those who work in the public sector use Italian as their daily language, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City belong to the Roman Catholic Church.
Thanks to the fact that the main chemical elements (such as gold, silver, and copper) are found in nature in their natural form and are relatively easy to obtain with the help of primitive tools, people have known about them since ancient times.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that claimed all things are composed of one element or a mixture of the four elements (earth, water, fire, and air).
It seemed more like four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although, according to his theory, they can indeed transform into other substances to ultimately become what we observe.
In most cases, alloys are a mixture of two or more metals. Keep in mind that the periodic table contains a large number of elements.
Elements similar to calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
Furthermore, there are alloys containing a negligible amount of non-metallic components. Such a non-metallic component can be, for example, carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter consists of tiny particles - atoms.
The size of atoms is so small that trillions of them could fit into a period at the end of this sentence.
As a result, when the pencil appeared, it became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, the value of the pencil and the frequency of its use decreased as new writing methods emerged.
People nowadays write messages on computer screens, and a pencil sharpener is needed by no one.
We can only guess what fate awaits the keyboard when something fundamentally new takes its place.
The principle of operation of a plutonium bomb is based on the use of energy from nuclear synthesis, in which a nucleus with a large number of protons and neutrons is formed.
It's like rolling a very heavy stroller uphill. Repeated splitting of the nucleus will release some of this energy.
The nuclei of some atoms are unstable. This means that they tend to decay under slight external influence or even without it.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outer layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The thickness of the ice on the near side is about 70 km, and on the far side it is about 100 km.
Under the lunar mists, the Moon's crown is thinner, and under the high mountains, it is thicker.
Monthly tides can be stronger on the side of the month closest to us, because the water is shallower here, and consequently, it is easier for lava to rise to the surface.
Meaningful theories focus on what motivates people or what attracts them.
The aforementioned theories stem from the fact that people have certain needs and (or) desires that they transform into internal ones and imbue with a subjective character (in other words, internalize) during aging.
The mentioned theories describe what exactly compels individuals to desire what they do, and which factors in their environment can influence whether they will do certain things.
Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs theory" and Herzberg's "Two-Factor Theory" represent two authoritative substantive theories.
Essentially, when managers lead their former colleagues, two types of behavior may arise. At one end of the spectrum will be attempts to remain a "one of the guys" (or "one of the girls").
Managers dealing with this type may experience difficulties with assessing work effectiveness, making unpopular decisions, implementing disciplinary measures, distributing responsibility, and holding those at fault accountable.
Another extreme is the situation where a person changes beyond recognition – feeling the need to change everything the team has done up to now and claim it as their own.
Ultimately, the leader is solely responsible for the team's successes and failures.
Often, this type of behavior ends in arguments between leaders and the remaining team members.
Virtual teams should also adhere to standards of excellence as ordinary teams do, although there are some minor differences.
Normally, virtual team members perform the role of a call center contact for the corresponding real group.
Considering that such teams can meet regardless of time zones, they often have more freedom than members of traditional teams, which may not be understood by local management.
Another unique component of a distributed virtual team is the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson and LaFasto, 1989, p109).
The team of managers, to whom each member is subordinate – this is the so-called "invisible team." It sets standards for each member.
Why might an organization want to undergo a lengthy process of establishing an educational organization? Innovation is one of the goals of applying organizational learning concepts in practice.
Creativity and ingenuity can emerge when all available resources are used effectively in the functional departments of an organization.
Thus, the process used by the organization, whose employees strive to overcome some obstacle together, can lead to the emergence of a new innovative process that satisfies customer needs.
The organization's leadership must create a culture characterized by innovation, knowledge sharing, and organizational learning. Only then can the organization be called innovative.
In Angel (2006), a continuous approach is a method by which organizations can achieve higher efficiency.
A theoretical approach to the study of cognition is reinforced by physical evidence in the form of neurobiological data. This, in turn, narrows and makes the field of research more precise.
The results of the studies obtained by scientists are confirmed by the presence of a close correlation between brain pathologies and human behavior.
It has long been known that various types of traumatic brain injuries, focal lesions, formations, plaques, pathological changes, and tumors in the brain affect behavior and alter certain mental functions.
The development of new technologies makes it possible to study the structure of the brain and processes within it that remain unknown to us.
Thanks to this, we obtain a huge amount of materials and data for building simulation models, which in turn help us understand the processes taking place in our minds.
Although the term "artificial intelligence" usually evokes associations with science fiction, in reality, AI is a very important field of computer science that deals with the study of the behavior, learning process, and intellectual adaptation of computers.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence includes attempts to force machines to automate tasks that require them to behave intelligently.
As an example, one can cite planning and control, the ability to respond to customer requests and technical issues, as well as facial recognition, voice recognition, and handwriting recognition.
They have branched out into separate disciplines that study real-world problems and offer solutions to them.
Nowadays, AI is often used in economics, medicine, technical and military fields. Moreover, it is a component of software for some computer programs and video games.
Excursions make up a significant part of school education. Often, the teacher takes students to places that are inaccessible by bus.
With the help of modern technologies, virtual tours can be organized. Students can familiarize themselves with museum exhibits, visit an aquarium, or admire the beauty of works of art. And all of this – without leaving the classroom.
Joint participation in virtual excursions also represents a very good way to reflect on the trip and share experiences in future lessons.
Students at Benet School in North Carolina, for example, create a website every year about their trip to the state capital, and they revise it every year, but old versions remain on the web in album form.
Moreover, blogging can improve students' writing skills. Although their grammar and spelling are often "lacking" at the beginning of blogging, it usually improves thanks to the presence of an audience.
Considering that students are usually the most demanding audience, the blogger, in order to avoid criticism, does everything possible to improve their style.
In addition, maintaining a blog "helps students better understand the world around them." The need to maintain audience engagement inspires them and forces them to remain capable and interested (Tota, 2004).
Blogging promotes collaboration and motivates students to learn far more than a traditional school approach offers.
If students use blogs appropriately, they "will be able to develop analytical and critical thinking skills; active engagement with online materials will help students define their own position on what others have written, as well as express their own views on individual issues" (Oravec, 2002).
Ottawa is a fascinating and charming bilingual capital of Canada. Here you can find numerous art galleries and museums, which offer the opportunity to get acquainted with the country's past and present.
Niagara Falls lies further south, while Lake Muskoka, renowned for its untouched natural beauty, is located to the north.
That's precisely why, and for many other reasons, tourists, visitors, and other foreigners consider Ontario a typical Canadian province.
On significant portions of its territory, located further north, very few people live, and some are almost completely barren deserts.
To illustrate the population difference, one can cite the following fact that surprises many: the number of African Americans in the US exceeds the total number of citizens in Canada.
The East African islands are located near the eastern coast of Africa and belong to the Indian Ocean islands.
Undoubtedly, Madagascar is the largest of them. When it comes to wildlife, it can be compared to an entire continent.
Almost all the smaller islands are either independent states or belong to France. They are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
Moreover, the Arabs brought Islam with them to these lands, and this religion quickly spread to the Comoros Islands and the island of Mayotte.
By the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route to India from Europe around the Cape of Good Hope, the beginning of European influence and the politics of colonialism is attributed.
The northern border of this region is the Sahel, and the southern and western borders are the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: female tourists are advised to always say that they are married, even if they are not.
Moreover, it might be useful to wear a ring (one that doesn't look too expensive).
Women need to understand that as a result of cultural differences, they may encounter behavior that they perceive as harassment. Locals often bother tourists, grabbing their hands and so on.
Firmly reject men and boldly defend your opinion (regardless of cultural differences, this is absolutely unacceptable!).
Berber fishermen founded the modern Casablanca in the 10th century BC. The Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids used this city as a strategic port, which was called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed the city and then rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca (White House). They left this place after the 1755 earthquake.
The Moroccan Sultan restored the city and named it Dar l-Baḍja. The city received the name Casablanca from Spanish traders who established trading posts there.
In all of Morocco, Casablanca is one of the least interesting places for shopping.
Near the Old City of Medina, you can quite easily find places selling traditional Moroccan products – leather goods, ceramics, tagines, hookahs, and various trinkets; however, they are all intended exclusively for tourists.
Goma is a city in the east of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, not far from the border with Rwanda, and is popular with tourists.
In 2002, Goma was buried by a lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano. It buried most of the city's streets, mainly in the city center.
Despite the fact that the city of Gomel itself is quite safe, it is worth conducting a small investigation before leaving its borders to find out if fighting is taking place in the Northern Kivu province at a given time.
Moreover, the city serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo. Very affordable services for mountain gorilla watching are also offered here—it's hard to find more attractive prices in Africa.
To get around Gomel, you can take a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi). The standard (local) price for a short ride is around 500 Congolese francs.
As a result of Timbuktu's comparative inaccessibility, its name began to be used as a metaphor for remote, exotic places.
Despite its reputation as a tourist attraction and the presence of an airport, today Timbuktu is a city marked by poverty.
In 1990, due to a threat from the Sahara Desert, it was included in the list of World Heritage sites that are in danger.
Henry Louis Gates Jr. paid considerable attention to this city in the PBS channel program " Wonders of the African Continent."
Compared to other cities in the country, the city stands out even more because it has a more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeastern part of South Africa. To the east, it borders Mozambique, to the north – Zimbabwe, and its southern border runs along the Crocodile River.
The area of the park is 19,500 km². It has 14 ecological zones, each of which is home to different animals and different plants.
It is considered one of the most interesting places in the country and is also considered the most significant of the South African National Parks.
Like in all national parks of the Republic of South Africa, the park charges an entrance fee daily and collects an environmental levy from visitors.
Furthermore, acquiring a so-called Wild Card – a membership that allows visits to several parks in South Africa or all national parks of Zimbabwe – may prove beneficial.
The name of the country Hong Kong is borrowed from the Hong Kong Island, which is a center of attraction for many tourists.
Hong Kong's beautiful buildings, which form the city's architectural face, are compared to a dazzling column diagram, and the waters of Victoria Harbour only emphasize their presence.
The best views of Hong Kong can be enjoyed by leaving the island and heading to the opposite shore of Kowloon.
A significant portion of Hong Kong's urban development is compactly located along the northern waterfront on reclaimed land.
In the past, this place was captured by colonizers from Great Britain, so if you want to see evidence of the country's colonial past with your own eyes, you should start right here.
The Sundarbans forest is the world's largest tidal mangrove forest, extending 80 km (50 miles) inland from the coast of Bangladesh and the Indian subcontinent.
UNESCO has declared Sundarbans a World Heritage site. The part of the forest located in India is known as the "Sundarbans National Park".
Not only are mangrove swamps called forests, but they are also some of the last remaining secluded jungles that once covered the Ganges Plain and still exist.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3850 km², of which water bodies or swamps occupy about one-third.
The Sundarbans forest has been a wildlife sanctuary since 1966, and currently, according to reports, 400 royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 spotted deer are found in this region.
Buses depart from the inter-regional bus station (which is located across the river) throughout the day. However, in most cases, they leave between 6:30 and 7:30 AM, especially those heading east and to Jakar (which is located in the Bumtang area).
Due to the fact that intercity buses are often overcrowded, it is recommended to buy tickets a couple of days before the trip.
Comfortable and reliable small Coaster buses made in Japan serve most areas.
Route taxis are a comfortable and convenient way to get to nearby places – for example, to the towns of Punakha (fare: 200 ngultrums) and Paro (fare: 150 ngultrums).
The bridge spanning the Aiapoc River is a cargo bridge. It connects the banks of the Aiapoc River, on which are situated two cities – Aiapó (Brazil) and Saint-Georges-de-L'Ayoque (French Guiana).
The height of the two pylons is 83 meters. The bridge length is 378 meters. The roadway consists of two lanes, each with a width of 3.50 meters.
The vertical clearance under the bridge is 15 meters. The bridge was opened for traffic only in March 2017, despite its construction being completed in August 2011.
According to the schedule, the bridge will be fully operational in September 2017, after the completion of the construction of the Brazilian customs checkpoints.
The Guarani, who led a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle and also practiced natural agriculture, were the most significant group of indigenous inhabitants who populated the territory of modern Eastern Paraguay.
Other groups of indigenous tribes, such as the Yagua and Guayкуру, lived in the Chaco region. To survive, they engaged in hunting, fishing, and gathering.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India," essentially appeared in the 16th century when Spanish conquerors encountered the indigenous peoples.
The Spanish began a three-hundred-year period of colonization.

It's practically impossible to exchange local currency outside of the Falkland Islands, so do it before you leave.
When it's winter in the Northern Hemisphere, it's summer in Montevideo, and vice versa. This is because the city is located south of the equator.
Montevideo is located in the subtropics: temperatures above +30°C in the summer months are commonplace.
Winters there can be deceptively cold: the thermometer column rarely drops below zero, but due to wind combined with humidity, the temperature feels lower than it actually is.
The level of precipitation hardly changes throughout the year, so there are no distinct rainy or dry seasons here.
Despite many animals in the park being used to seeing people, they should not be fed or disturbed – wild animals remain wild.
Park management advises to stay at least 100 yards (meters) away from bears and wolves and 25 yards (meters) away from other wild animals!
Bison, moose, elk, bears, and almost all large animals are capable of attacking, regardless of how docile they may appear.
Dozens of visitors each year sustain injuries due to a lack of adequate distance. Do not approach closely, as these animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous.
Please also keep in mind that bears and other wild animals are attracted by smells, so do not carry or prepare food with a strong odor, and maintain cleanliness in the camp.

Stirrups hang on both sides of the saddle and serve as supports for the rider's feet.
Saddles provide greater stability, but safety problems may arise because the rider's legs could get caught.
If a rider falls from a horse, their leg can get caught in the stirrup. In this case, if the horse gets spooked and starts to run away, it can drag the rider along with it. To minimize the risk of this happening, some safety measures can be taken.
Firstly, most riders wear special boots with heels and a soft, quite narrow sole.
Moreover, some saddles, especially English ones, are equipped with protective bars. If a rider pulls back the stirrup strap during a fall, the protective bars allow him to slide off the saddle.

Foreign governments are ready to implement these documents to varying degrees.
Moreover, after September 11, 2001, the surveillance at checkpoints became much more ruthless.
It's doubtful that transgender people who haven't yet had surgery will be able to go through a scanner without their dignity and right to privacy being violated.
Rip current, often observed on a reef or similar location, is a flow of water moving away from the beach.
The return flow concentrates on several sections with great depth, which is related to the underwater topography, and rapid currents to great depths can form there.
The primary cause of most fatal accidents is drowning, which occurs when people try to swim back to shore against the current, which can be impossible.
After you get back on track, it won't be very difficult to return.
Try to head towards where you won't get caught in the current again. Also, if your skills allow or if you've been spotted, you can stay put and wait for rescue.

The archipelago separates the Peninsula by a distance of 120 km to the north. The largest island is named King George, and the settlement of Vila Las Estrelas is located on it.
Among others, Livingstone and Deception Islands can be noted, where a picturesque natural harbor formed in the crater of an active volcano.
Elswort Island, bordered by the Belingshausen Sea, is located south of the peninsula.
In this place, the mountains of the peninsula merge into a low-lying plain. Then they rise again from it, forming a chain of Elswort Mountains 360 km long. The Minnesotan Glacier cuts it in half.

On the lakes and archipelagoes, you can manage without a yacht.
Despite the fact that the largest lakes and coastal archipelagos are actually large enough for any yacht, completely different impressions can be gained on smaller boats or even kayaks.
In Finland, boating is a national pastime. Here, statistics show that there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
Something similar can be seen in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but nowhere more so (for example, in the Netherlands this indicator is at the level of one to forty).
For most memorable cruises on the Baltic Sea, a long stop in Russian Saint Petersburg is characteristic.

However, it's not cheap: practice shows that compared to the regular economy class, you can pay four times more for business class and more than eleven times for first class!
Essentially, there's no point in looking for discounts on tickets for direct flights from A to B in first or business class.
Airlines are well aware of the existence of a specific key group of passengers who are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of traveling quickly and comfortably to their destination. Therefore, they charge a corresponding fee.
The capital of Moldova is the city of Chișinău. The local population speaks Romanian, however, Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a country where several nationalities live and where an ethnic conflict took place.

As of today, most early observatories are outdated and function as museums or educational centers.
Usually, such observatories were located in cities or on university grounds, where they were easier to reach than modern observatories. The reason is simple: nowadays, light pollution poses a much greater problem than it did before.
The main part of modern research telescopes consists of grandiose objects of gigantic size, which are usually located in peripheral areas with optimal atmospheric conditions.
Hanami, which means the enjoyment of cherry blossoms, entered Japanese culture as early as the 8th century.
