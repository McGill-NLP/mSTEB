This doesn't just confirm that some dinosaurs had feathers, which is already a known theory, but it allows for details that fossils usually cannot provide, concerning colors and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the fur of this animal was chestnut-brown on top, with a pale or yellowish-orange-red underside.
The discovery also sheds light on the evolution of feathers in birds.
Since dinosaur feathers lack a well-developed rachis, called the shaft, but possess other feather characteristics – barbs and tiny spines – researchers have concluded that the rachis is likely a later evolutionary development compared to the other features.
The structure of these feathers suggests they weren't used for flight, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers note that, although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers from an adult, not a juvenile.
Research has shown that, even though this is a young dinosaur's tail, the sample shows adult feathers, not chicken feathers.
A car bomb that detonated yesterday at the police headquarters in Gaziantep, Turkey, killed two police officers and injured over twenty other people.
A statement was released from the governor's office that nineteen of the injured individuals were police officers.
The police announced that they suspect a Daesh (ISIL) militant responsible for the attack.
They discovered that the Sun functions on the same basic principles as other stars. It has been established that the activity of all stars in the system is governed by their luminosity, their rotation, and nothing else.
Luminosity and rotation are used together to determine Rozbijev's star number, which is related to plasma flow.
The smaller the Rozbijev number, the less active the star is with respect to magnetic field inversions.

The work performed was largely of a theoretical nature, but the program was written to mimic observations of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect the team was seeking would be caused by tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the Moon attracts the Earth and thus causes tides, so too does the Milky Way exert a force on the galaxy Sagittarius.
Scientists have managed to conclude that dark matter influences other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
According to this theory, most of the dark matter is located around galaxies in a sort of halo and consists of numerous small particles.

"Their thermal behavior is not as consistent as large caves on Earth which often maintain a fairly constant temperature, but it is consistent with the fact that they are deep cavities in the ground," said Glen Cushing, a member of the Astrogeology Team at the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and Northern Arizona University in Flagstaff, Arizona.
Voting in France is conducted without technology. Voters are isolated in a booth and place a pre-printed piece of paper in a ballot box, on which they mark the candidate they are voting for.
After the officials verify the voter's identity, the voter inserts the envelope into the ballot box and signs the voter list.
These procedures are quite strictly regulated by the French electoral law.

Candidates can send representatives to follow every part of the process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Her first race was a slalom, where she received a "Did Not Finish" in the first run. 36 out of 116 competitors had the same result in that race.
In her second race, the giant slalom, she took tenth place in the women's group with a combined race time of 4:41.30, 2:11.60 minutes slower than the first-place Austrian Claudia Loesch and 1:09.02 minutes slower than Hungarian Gyöngyi Dani, who finished in ninth place.
Four female para-alpine skiers failed to finish their run, and 45 of the 117 total skiers in the giant slalom race did not complete the race.
Police in the Madhya Pradesh region found and returned a stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Chief Inspector D. K. Arya stated: "We arrested five individuals who raped a Swiss woman, and we located and returned her mobile phone and laptop to her."
The accused are named Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
Police Inspector Chandra Shekhar Solanki stated that the accused appeared in court with their faces covered.
Although three people were in the house when the car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver suffered serious head injuries.
The road where the collision occurred was temporarily closed while emergency services extracted the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was first accommodated in James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was later transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Adekoya has been in the sheriff court in Edinburgh ever since, accused of murdering her son.
She is in custody while awaiting indictment and trial, but any witness evidence may be rejected because her image has been published many times.
That is standard practice in other parts of Great Britain, but the Scottish judiciary operates differently, and the courts have deemed it possible that publishing photographs could be harmful.
Professor Pamela Ferguson from the University of Dundee notes that "it seems journalists are really walking a tightrope when publishing photos of suspects."
The Crown Prosecutor's Office, which is fully responsible for criminal prosecution, announced to journalists that no further comments would be given, at least until charges are filed.
The document will, according to leaked information, refer to the dispute over borders that Palestine intends to base itself on the borders prior to the 1967 Middle East War.
Other topics are allegedly covering the future state of Jerusalem, which is holy to both nations, a problem in the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a permanent military presence in this valley for a period of ten years after the signing of the agreement, while the PA accepts a military presence for only five years.
The shooters in the supplementary trial program for pest control were to be under close supervision of rangers, since the trial program is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In partnership with the NPWS and the Australian Sports Shooters Association (NSW), qualified volunteers have been recruited in accordance with the hunting program of the Australian Sports Shooters Association.
According to Mick O'Flynn, acting director for conservation and heritage of the park within the NPWS, four marksmen selected for the initial shooting operation received detailed safety instructions and training.
Yesterday, in the new Temporary Election Commission (CEP), nine members took the oath before Martelly.
This is Martelly's fifth Temporary Electoral Council (CEP) in four years.
Last month, the presidential commission proposed that the previous CEC resign as part of a package of measures to move the country towards new elections.
The commission was Martelly's response to the widespread protests against the regime that began in October.
Violent protests erupted on occasion due to the failure to hold elections, some of which have not been held since 2011.
Around 60 cases of iPod overheating were reported, which caused a total of six fires and minor burns to four people.
The Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) reported that it had information about 27 accidents related to these devices.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating cases, which the company claims are "not serious."
The ministry responded by calling Apple's delay of the report "really regrettable."
An earthquake struck Marijana at 7:19 AM local time (Friday at 9:19 PM GMT).
The Office for Emergency Management of the Northern Mariana Islands announced that there were no reported damages in the territory.
Furthermore, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said there are no indications of a tsunami.
A former police officer from the Philippines held tourists from Hong Kong hostage after hijacking their bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza shot tourists with his M16 rifle.
Several hostages have been rescued so far, and at least six have been confirmed dead.
Earlier, six hostages were released, including children, elderly people, and photographers from the Philippines.
Photographers later took the place of the older lady when she needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Following in his father's footsteps, Liggins embarked on a medical career.
He trained to be a midwife and in 1959 started working at the State Women's Hospital in Auckland.
While working at Liggins Hospital, he researched premature birth in his spare time.
His research showed that introducing hormones will accelerate the maturation of the baby's lungs.
Xinhua Agency reported that government investigators found two "black boxes" for recording data during the flight on Wednesday.
Colleagues wrestlers also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer stated that "Luna was the first queen of extremity. My first manager. Luna passed away at two months old. Pretty unique, just like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was strange like me...maybe even more so...I love her and I'll miss her...I hope she's in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal elections, the number opposing Australia becoming a republic has risen by 8 percent since 2008.
As part of the campaign for the 2010 federal elections, Prime Minister of the interim government Julia Gillard stated that she believed Australia should become a republic after the reign of Queen Elizabeth II.
This opinion is shared by 34 percent of the surveyed individuals who wish for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch in Australia.
The survey showed two types of extreme views: 29 percent of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe Australia should never become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist was supposed to swim in the 100m and 200m freestyle events, and in three stages at the Commonwealth Games, but his fitness is in doubt due to appeals.
He was not able to take the necessary pain medication because those medications are banned at the Games.
Curtis Cooper, a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number on January 25th.
Several people confirmed the discovery by the beginning of February using various hardware and software, as announced on Tuesday.
Comets may have been a source of water delivery to Earth, along with organic matter that forms proteins and supports life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because comets collided with Earth long ago.
Cuomo, 53 years old, became governor at the beginning of this year and last month signed a law legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called the rumors political babbling and nonsense.
It is speculated that he/she will run for president in 2016.
FAA claims that the NextGen system, which would allow planes to fly shorter routes, thereby saving millions of gallons of fuel annually and simultaneously reducing carbon emissions.
Use satellite-based technology instead of outdated ground radar technology, so that air traffic controllers can locate aircraft with greater accuracy and provide pilots with more precise information.
No additional transportation will be included, and above-ground trains will not stop at Wembley, and car parks and park-and-ride bus parks are not available near the stadium.
The fear of a lack of transportation has increased the likelihood that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without fans of the team.
A study published on Thursday in the journal Science presented claims about the formation of a new species of birds on the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador.
Researchers at Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden announced that a new species has evolved in just two generations, although it was believed that the process had taken much longer, due to reproduction between the endemic Darwin's deer mouse, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant cactus mouse, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be made in various forms. It can be woven into small shapes.
It can be drawn into a thin wire that can be twisted and woven. It can be hammered or rolled into sheets.
It can be made very thin and attached to another metal. It can be so thin that it is sometimes used to decorate hand-painted pictures in books called "illuminated manuscripts".
That is called the pH value of a chemical substance. An indicator can be made using red cabbage juice.
The color of cabbage juice changes depending on how acidic or basic (alkaline) the chemicals are.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen (H⁺) ions in the tested chemical.
Hydrogen ions are protons from which electrons have been removed (because hydrogen atoms consist of one proton and one electron).
Mix two dry powders, then make a ball from them with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layers, leading to a strange sensation and creating a kind of protection.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost every house had a flush toilet connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the sewage system have been found in houses in the Minoan cities of Crete and Santorini in Greece.
Toilets existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China as well. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths where men and women would socialize together in a mixed society.
When you call someone who is miles away, use a satellite.
A satellite in space receives a call, and then reflects it back down, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists in space use telescopes because Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
A colossal rocket over 100 feet tall is needed to launch satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel changed the world in incredible ways. The most important thing the wheel provided us is much easier and faster transportation.
He brought us a car, a vehicle, and many other transportation devices.
Below them are medium-sized cats that eat medium-sized prey, ranging in size from rabbits to antelopes and deer.
Finally, there are many small cats (including lost domestic cat kittens) that eat a much larger number of small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a special skill possessed by every cat that prevents it from competing with others.
Lions are the most sociable cats and live in large groups called prides.
A pack consists of one to three adult males who are related, and up to thirty females and young.
Women are usually closely connected to each other because it's a large family of sisters and daughters.
Prides of lions behave similarly to packs of wolves or dogs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions in behavior (but not other large cats), and are also very deadly to their prey.
A tiger, like a true all-around athlete, can climb (though not well), swim, leap great distances, and pull with five times the strength of a strong man.
The tiger is in the same group (genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These are the only four cats that can roar.
A tiger's roar is not like the full-throated roar of a lion, but more like a sentence of angrily shouted words.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. If they can, they will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds. Almost all the animals that an ocelot hunts are much smaller than itself.
Scientists believe that ocelots track and locate their prey based on scent by sniffing the ground where the animals were located.
They see very well in the dark due to their night vision, and they also move very quietly. Ocelots hunt prey by blending in with their surroundings, and then pounce on their prey.
When a small group of living beings (a small population) becomes separated from the main population from which they originate (for example, during a crossing of a mountain range or river or if they migrate to a new island, so that they cannot easily return), they often find themselves in an environment that differs from the environment in which they were previously.
This new environment has different resources and different competitors, so the new population, in order to represent a strong competitor, will need different characteristics or adaptation compared to what they needed before.
The original population hasn't changed at all, and they still need adaptations as they did before.
Over time, as the new population adapts to the new environment, it begins to resemble the other population less and less.
Finally, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will diverge so much that they will no longer be able to be called the same species.
This process is called speciation, which simply means the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants create the oxygen that people breathe, and they take in the carbon dioxide that people exhale.
Plants produce food through photosynthesis using the sun. They also provide shade.
We build houses and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plant-based. Animals couldn't survive without plants.
The mosasaur was the apex predator of its time. It feared nothing, except other mosasaurs.
His long jaws contained more than 70 teeth sharp as razors, along with an additional row on the palate, meaning there was no escape for any creature that would cross his path.
We don't know for sure, but she may have had a forked tongue. Her diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and she may have even been a cannibal.
He attacked everything that entered the water. Even a gigantic dinosaur like T. Rex was not a match for him.
While most of their food was familiar to them, the Romans ate some strange or unusual food at banquets, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a woodlouse.
The second difference was that while poor men and women ate sitting in chairs, wealthy men liked to prepare banquets together, where they would lounge on their sides while eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine couldn't include foods that arrived in Europe from America or Asia in later centuries.
For example, they didn't have corn, nor tomatoes, nor potatoes, nor cocoa, and not a single ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonians built a main temple for each of their deities, which was considered the home of that deity.
People would make sacrifices to the gods, and the priests would try to satisfy the gods' needs through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple had an open courtyard and an inner sanctuary to which only priests could have access.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built to be part of temples.
The top of the tower represented a special sanctuary for the god.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, the house wasn't so important.
Most of the Jewish family's life took place outdoors.
Women were cooking in the yard; shops were just open cash registers facing the street. Stone was used to build houses.
In the land of Kanan, there were no large forests, so wood was incredibly expensive.
Greenland was sparsely populated. Norwegian sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and when he traveled further west, he found Greenland and named it so.
However, despite his discovery, Eskimo tribes had already been living there during that period.
Although each state was "Scandinavian", there were many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have seen the movie National Treasure, you might think that a treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not accurate. Although something is written on the back of the document, it's not a treasure map.
On the reverse side of the Declaration of Independence, the words "Original Declaration of Independence from July 4, 1776" were written. The text is written backward at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is known that the great document on parchment (29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was rolled up and placed in an archive right from the beginning.
Therefore, it is possible that the note was added simply as a marker.
With the landings in Normandy (D-Day) and the subsequent battles, northern France was liberated, but the south remained free.
In the north of France, the "Vichy" French ruled. These were the French who, in 1940, made a peace treaty with the Germans and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting against them.
The Allies attacked southern France on August 15, 1940, and the attack was called "Operation Dragoon".
In just two weeks, the Americans and the Free French liberated southern France and turned their attention towards Germany.
Civilization is a culture shared by a large group of people who live and work together, a society.
The word civilization originates from the Latin word "civilis," which means citizen, and relates to the Latin word "civis," which means citizen, and "civitas," which means city or city-state, thereby defining, in a way, the size of a society.
City-states were precursors to nations. Civilizational culture entails the transmission of knowledge through several generations, a lasting cultural legacy, and equitable distribution.
Often, lesser cultures disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
According to the Treaty of Confederation, during the War of Independence, thirteen of the Confederate states first formed a weak central government, the sole component of which was the Congress.
The Congress lacked the power to impose taxes, and given that there was no national executive authority or judiciary, it relied on state bodies for the enforcement of laws, which often did not cooperate.
He also did not have the authority to repeal tax laws and tariffs between states.
Members demanded complete agreement from all states before they could be amended, and the states took the central government so lightly that their representatives were often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, is the second most successful team in the world and were champions of the FIFA World Cup in 2006.
Popular sports include football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern regions, and Italians compete in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan consists of nearly 7,000 islands (the largest is Honshu), which makes Japan the 7th largest island in the world!
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan has, Japan is often called an "archipelago" from a geographical perspective.
The beginning of Taiwan dates back to the 15th century when European sailors passing by noted the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or beautiful island.
The Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan in 1624, initiating a change in the indigenous agricultural practices and employing Chinese workers to work on its rice and sugar plantations.
The Qing dynasty (1644-1912) took control of the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan in 1683 and proclaimed Taiwan a province of the Qing empire in 1885.
After the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki in 1895, ceding sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
In Machu Picchu, there are three main structures - Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edges of the complex have been restored to give tourists a better understanding of how they originally looked.
Thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored by 1976, and the restoration continued until today.
For example, the most common format for a still image in the world is 35 mm, which dominated at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced today, but even more importantly, the display format has been adopted from the sensor format of digital camera image sensors.
The 35mm format is actually somewhat confusing – 36mm wide by 24mm tall.
Therefore, for the ratio of proportions of this format (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest ratio of the total number), it is said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, the APS family of formats) are equal to or approximate this ratio of proportions.
The rule of thirds, which is often misused and often ridiculed, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while simultaneously maintaining order in the image.
It is said that the most effective spot for the main subject in an intersection of lines dividing the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During that period of European history, the Catholic Church, which had become wealthy and powerful, came under control.
Christian religion has connected European states for over a thousand years despite different languages and customs.
Her dominant power affected everyone - from the king to the ordinary man.
One of the main principles of Christianity is that wealth should be used to alleviate suffering and poverty, and that the church's funds should serve precisely for that purpose.
The central authority of the Church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and due to this concentration of power and money, many question whether this rule is respected.
Shortly after the outbreak of the conflict, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
The strategy proved effective in disrupting the supply of vital military and civilian necessities, although this blockade has violated internationally accepted law codified in several international agreements from the past two centuries.
Britain mined international waters to prevent any ship from entering parts of the ocean, posing a danger even to ships of neutral countries.
Given the limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unlimited warfare under the sea.
During the 1920s, the prevailing attitudes among most citizens and nations were pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, the countries wanted to avoid such a situation in the future.
Tesla moved to the United States in 1884 because he accepted a job at Edison's company in New York.
He arrived in the USA with 4 cents in his pocket, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from his previous job) for Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of depicting different historical periods. Each phase in Chinese history or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Furthermore, the period between each dynasty represented a period of divided provinces. The most well-known such period was the Three Kingdoms era, which lasted 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During those periods, fierce wars were waged among many nobles who fought for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest periods in the history of ancient China. Thousands of people died fighting for the top position in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There are many social and political effects, such as the use of the metric system, the transition from absolutism to republicanism, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not just a single ruler.
Also, after the professions of the revolution were opened to all male applicants, which enabled the most ambitious and successful to succeed.
The same applies to the military, as instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution inspired many other oppressed working-class people in other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammed was deeply interested in topics beyond this earthly life. He often spent time in a cave that became known as "Hira" on the mountain "Noor" (light) and contemplated.
The cave itself, which has survived all time, gives a vivid picture of Muhammad's spiritual inclinations.
The cave, located on the top of a mountain north of Mecca, is completely isolated from the rest of the world.
Actually, it's not easy to find even if someone knows it exists. Once you enter the cave, it's complete isolation.
Nothing can be seen except the clear, beautiful sky and numerous mountains. Very little of this world can be seen or heard from inside the cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World that still exists today.
The Great Pyramid, which the Egyptians built in the third century BC, is one of many great pyramidal structures built in honor of the dead pharaoh.
On the Giza plateau or "Giza Necropolis" in the Egyptian Valley of the Kings are located a number of pyramids (of which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several small tombs, temples, and the Great Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built in honor of Pharaoh Khufu, and many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built in honor of Khufu's wives and family members.
The designation "goose neck pointing upwards" looks like a V, and "goose neck pointing downwards" like a hyphen or a square with the bottom side missing.
Up means you need to start from the top and push the bobsled, while down means you need to start from the frog (where your hand holds the bobsled) and pull the bobsled.
A horn pointing upwards usually creates a softer sound, while a horn pointing downwards is louder and more declarative.
Feel free to write your markings with a pencil, but remember that the printed markings of the strings listed are for musical purposes, so they should be respected.
A mob of women from the market forced the frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (11-year-old Marie Thérèse and four-year-old Louis-Charles), and the Queen's sister, Madam Elizabeth, to return to Paris from Versailles on October 6, 1789.
In the carriage, they returned to Paris surrounded by a crowd of people who were shouting and yelling threats against the king and queen.
A mob of people forced the king and queen to have the windows of their carriages thrown wide open.
At one point, a mafia member was waving his head at the member of the royal guard killed in Versailles in front of a terrified queen.
The war costs of American imperialism during the conquest of the Philippines were paid by the Filipino people.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to cover a large portion of the costs and interest on bonds issued in the name of the Philippine government through banks on Wall Street.
Of course, the superb profits that arise from the long-term exploitation of the Filipino people would represent the basic gain of US imperialism.
To understand the Templars, it is necessary to understand the context that prompted the founding of the order.
The period in which those events occurred is usually called the medieval period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000–1300).
The early Middle Ages preceded the developed High Middle Ages, and the Late Middle Ages followed, which was agreed to have ended around 1500.
Technological determinism is a term that in practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from the technological drive or technological imperative to the strict notion that human destiny is governed by a fundamental logic connected to the laws of science and their manifestation in technology.
Two general ideas are common to most interpretations of technological determinism: that the development of technology follows a path largely beyond the influence of culture or politics, and that technology, in turn, has "effects" on societies that are specific and not socially conditioned.
For example, someone could say that motor vehicles necessarily lead to the development of roads.
However, the road network across the country is not economically sustainable for just a few cars, which has led to the development of new production methods to reduce the costs of car ownership.
Widespread car ownership also leads to a greater number of accidents on the roads, which drives the search for new techniques in healthcare to repair injured bodies.
Romanticism had a significant element of cultural determinism, adopted from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
In the context of Romanticism, geography shaped individuals, and over time customs and culture connected to these geographical regions emerged, and they were, in harmony with the society's place, better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just as Paris is known as the capital of fashion in the modern world, Constantinople was considered the fashion capital of feudal Europe.
His reputation as the epicenter of luxury began around 400 AD and lasted until around 1100 AD.
His status declined in the twelfth century, largely due to the fact that the Crusaders returned with gifts such as silk and spices, which were more valuable than anything the Byzantine market offered.
At that time, the title of the fashion capital had shifted from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak between the 10th and 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The style of dress at the beginning was strongly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, Western styles can lag behind by 25 to 30 years.
Western Europe began to develop its own style towards the end of the Middle Ages. One of the greatest developments of that time, as a result of the Crusades, was when people began to use buttons to fasten clothing.
Subsistence farming is agriculture whose goal is to produce a sufficient amount of food for the needs of the farmer and their family.
Subsistence farming is a simple, often organic system that uses preserved seed from a specific ecological region in combination with crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to increase yields.
Historically, most farmers engaged in self-sufficiency agriculture, which is still the case in many developing countries.
Subcultures bring together people with similar worldviews who feel overlooked by societal standards, allowing them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be identifiable by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The qualities that make a subculture different can be linguistic, aesthetic, religious, political, sexual, geographical, or a combination of these factors.
Members of subcultures often demonstrate their affiliation through a specific and symbolic use of style, encompassing fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is to point to several unfortunate cases of children who were not allowed to socialize during their development due to neglect, accidents, or intentional abuse.
Children like that are called "wild" children. Wild children were often imprisoned (usually done by parents); in some cases, children were abandoned because parents rejected their serious intellectual or physical shortcomings.
Abandoned children may have experienced violence or trauma before being abandoned or fleeing.
It is believed that the others raised the animals. Some are considered to have lived independently in the wild.
After being raised completely by uncivilized animals, the feral child exhibits behavior (within physical limitations) that closely resembles the behavior of the animal that cared for it, such as fear and indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning aims to make learning simpler and more engaging, the "scaffolding" method goes a step further.
"Scaffolding" (support) is not a method of learning, but a support tool that provides assistance to individuals going through a new learning experience, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Help can be both virtual and real; in other words, a teacher is one form of help, but also a small connector in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is integrated into software and designed for testing, guiding, and explaining procedures that could pose a challenge for students who need to perform them independently.
Children enter the foster care system for a variety of reasons, ranging from neglect and abuse to coercion.
No child should ever grow up in an environment where care, tenderness, and education are not expressed, but it happens.
We believe that the Foster Care system represents a safe zone for these children.
Our foster care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Foster care should fulfill all the needs that were unmet in the home from which they were previously removed.
The internet combines elements of both mass and interpersonal communication.
The various characteristics of the Internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of access to benefits and satisfaction of needs.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motivations for using the Internet (James et al. 1995).
When they investigated audience reactions to websites, Eighmey and McCord (1998) identified "personal involvement" and "continuing relationships" as new aspects of motivation.
The use of video recordings has led to important discoveries in the interpretation of micro-expressions, facial movements that last for a few milliseconds.
Specifically, it is claimed that by correctly interpreting microexpressions, it is possible to detect whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks, in his work "The Presidential Address," indicated that people who cannot understand speech due to brain damage can still correctly assess sincerity.
He even points out that such abilities in interpreting human behavior can be possessed by animals like domestic dogs.
Research from the 20th century revealed the fact that there are two types of genetic variation: hidden and expressed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, and selection removes it from the group of expressed variations.
Segregation and recombination mix variations between the two populations in each generation.
Due to a digestive system similar to humans, it can be difficult for scavengers in the savanna to meet their amino acid needs from available plant resources.
Furthermore, if this is not done, it leads to serious consequences: increased depression, malnutrition, and ultimately death.
The easiest available plant resources would be proteins found in leaves and legumes, but they are difficult to digest for primates like us unless they are cooked.
Unlike them, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible, but they also provide a huge amount of protein containing essential amino acids.
All things considered, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors solved the "protein problem" in a similar way to how chimpanzees do it today in the savannas.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking up during a normal sleep period and then sleeping again a little later (10-60 minutes).
This can be easily achieved by using a relatively quiet alarm clock that will bring you to consciousness without fully waking you up.
If you find yourself repeatedly resetting your alarm clock in your sleep, you can leave it on the other side of the room so you have to get out of bed to turn it off.
Other options based on biorhythms involve consuming plenty of fluids (especially water or tea which is a known diuretic) before bed, which will make the person get up to urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person possesses is the opposite of the amount of tension in their body and mind.
The lower the tension, the more positive the vital life force will be. Every person has the potential to find their absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only things standing in the way of this goal are our own tensions and negativity.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it has been expanded through the Mahayana path of love and numerous techniques of Indian yoga.
In principle, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini yoga, meditation, and the path of unconditional love.
In Kundalini Yoga, the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) awakens through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualizations.
The center of Tibetan meditation is the deity Yoga. Through the visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the USSR and the USA. At the end of the war, conflicts between systems, processes, and cultures led to disagreements between the countries.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies had become enemies, and the Cold War began.
It would last for the next 40 years and would be conducted really, through intermediary armies, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, the defense of Poland had already collapsed, and the only hope was to retreat and reorganize along the Romanian bridgehead.
However, these plans were practically obsolete overnight when over 800,000 soldiers from the Soviet Red Army entered and established the Belarusian and Ukrainian fronts following the invasion of eastern parts of Poland, thereby violating the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships for transporting goods is by far the most efficient way to move large quantities of goods and a large number of people across the ocean.
The navy's traditional role is to ensure the country maintains the ability to move its people and goods, while simultaneously hindering the enemy's ability to move their people and goods.
One of the most prominent recent examples of this practice is the North Atlantic campaign in World War II. The Americans attempted to transport soldiers and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to provide assistance to Britain.
Simultaneously, the German Navy was largely trying to stop this trade using U-boats.
If the Allies had failed, Germany would probably have been in a position to conquer Britain the way it conquered the rest of Europe.
It appears that goats were domesticated for the first time almost 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to cultivate them due to the easy access to milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domestic goats were most often kept in herds that roamed hillsides or other grazing areas, and they were often tended by goat herders, mainly children or adolescents, who are similar to today's shepherds. These livestock breeding methods are still used today.
Railcars were being produced in England as early as the 16th century.
Although the wagons consisted only of parallel wooden planks, they allowed the horses that pulled them to achieve greater speeds and haul more cargo than was the case on the somewhat uneven roads of that time.
Railway sleepers were introduced quite early for fixing the rails. However, it gradually became clear that the rails would be much more effective if they had a metal strip on top.
It has become a common practice, but iron caused increased wear and tear on the wooden wheels of the wagons.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced with iron wheels. The first full iron rails were introduced in 1767.
The first known mode of transport was walking; people began to walk upright two million years ago with the appearance of the Homo erectus (which means upright man).
Their ancestors, the australopithecines, did not walk upright by habit.
Bipedal adaptations have been observed in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although there is a possibility that Sahelanthropus walked on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living more friendly towards the environment, we can join the environmental protection movement, and we can even become activists to reduce suffering in the future to some extent.
This resembles symptomatic treatment in many cases. But if we don't want only a temporary solution, we should find the cause of the problem and eliminate it.
It's clear that the world has changed considerably due to the scientific and technological advancements of humanity, and that problems have become greater due to overpopulation and the extravagant lifestyles of people.
After it was adopted by the Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by Congress President John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was sent to the nearby printing house of John Dunlap.
Between 150 and 200 copies were made at night, now known as Dunlap broadsides.
John Nixon held the first public reading of that document on July 8th, in the courtyard of the Independence Hall.
One copy was sent to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The 25 Dunlap posters, the existence of which is known, are the oldest surviving specimens of that document. The original handwritten specimen is not preserved.
Many paleontologists believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and still exists today. We call them birds.
Many people don't consider them dinosaurs because they have feathers and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still resemble dinosaurs.
They have feet with chandeliers and claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information that is encrypted in the form of binary numbers.
A binary number can only have one of two possible values, i.e., 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits or bits in computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately obvious. Symptoms like vomiting are quite general, making it difficult to establish a diagnosis right away.
The best indicator of poisoning is the presence of an open medicine box or poisonous household chemical products.
Check the label for specific first aid instructions for that particular poison.
Entomologists use the term "buba" in a formal context for this group of insects.
This expression stems from a long-standing familiarity with ticks, insects that are highly adapted to parasitizing humans.
Cockroaches, both assassin and common German cockroaches, are adapted to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
In the United States, there are approximately 400,000 confirmed cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease in young adults and middle-aged individuals.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which consists of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerve.
The research showed that women are twice as likely to get MS as men.
It can hardly be decided that it is not in their best interest, or in the interest of their child, to raise a baby.
These couples may decide to make a plan to adopt a baby.
In the adoption process, biological parents renounce their parental rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to determine, through the scientific method, how the world functions. In fact, most scientific research is guided by this method.
However, it's not just experimentation; an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more possible hypotheses. Formulating questions and making observations also lead to scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's views on all scientific questions, including psychology, were accepted.
As Greek knowledge diminished, the West became disconnected from its Greek philosophical and scientific roots.
Many rhythms observed in physiology and behavior often depend on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through biological clocks.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic stimuli, have been observed in a large number of living beings, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
Biological clocks are self-sustaining oscillators that continue to operate even in the absence of external stimuli.
The Hershey-Chase experiment is one of the leading postulates that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phage or viruses to implant their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments in which they labeled the DNA of the phage with radioactive phosphorus or labeled the phage protein with radioactive sulfur.
Mutations can have different effects depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the specific part of the genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germ cells.
Only mutations in germ cells can be passed on to children, while mutations in other locations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people interested in visiting natural areas to enjoy the landscape, including plants and wildlife.
Examples of on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, visiting parks, and learning about the ecosystem.
An example is a visit, taking photographs, and learning about orangutans on Borneo.
Every morning, people leave their small towns on the outskirts by car and go to their workplaces, passing by those who work in the place they have just come from.
In this dynamic shuttle transport system, everyone is somehow connected and supportive, a transport system based on private cars.
Science now shows that this economy, with high levels of carbon emissions, has driven the biosphere out of one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses transportation systems. Almost everyone complains about the transportation systems.
In developed countries, you will rarely hear similar complaints about water quality or bridges falling apart.
Why do transport systems cause such complaints, why do they fail on a daily basis? Are traffic engineers simply incompetent? Or is something more fundamental happening?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions.
Unfortunately, traffic flow analysis is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with complete certainty.
Fortunately, drivers generally behave quite consistently. Therefore, traffic flow has a certain kind of reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
In order to better represent traffic flow, connections have been established between three basic characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
These relationships help with the planning, design, and operation of road facilities.
Insects were the first animals to take flight. Their ability to fly helped them evade enemies more easily and to more effectively find food and partners.
The advantage of most insects is that they can fold their wings along their bodies.
It provides them with a wider range of small places to hide from predators.
The only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are fairyflies and water boatmen.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the Sun.
Some thought he was right, but the majority believed the opposite claim - that the Solar System, including the Sun (and other stars), revolves around the Earth.
It sounds reasonable, because we don't feel the Earth moving, do we?
The Amazon River is the second longest and at the same time the largest river on Earth. It has more than eight times more water than the second largest river.
The Amazon is simultaneously the widest river on Earth, reaching up to six miles wide in some places.
A full 20 percent of the water that flows from rivers into the oceans comes from the Amazon.
The main Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It collects water from a thousand smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids in stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the pyramids of Giza were never surpassed in terms of their size and the technical perfection of their construction.
The New Kingdom of the ancient Egyptians marveled at the monuments of their ancestors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The Vatican has around 800 residents. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the fewest inhabitants.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language for legislation and official communication.
Italian is simultaneously the everyday language spoken by most employed people in that country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All residents of Vatican City are Roman Catholic.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their native form and can be relatively easily exploited using primitive tools.
Aristotle, the philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This was more like the four states of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma, although he also had a theory that they change into new substances and build what we see.
Alloys are essentially a mixture of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many elements in the periodic system.
Elements like calcium and potassium are considered metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have alloys that contain non-metallic elements, such as carbon, in small amounts.
Everything in the universe is made of matter. All matter is made of small particles called atoms.
Atoms are so incredibly small that trillions of them could fit into a period at the end of this sentence.
Therefore, the pencil was a good friend to many after its invention.
Unfortunately, with the development of newer writing methods, the pencil has fallen into a lower status and is used less frequently.
People now write messages on computers and never have to buy a pencil sharpener.
We can only wonder what will become of the keyboard when something newer appears.
The physical bomb works on the principle that energy is needed to assemble a core with a multitude of protons and neutrons.
Something like pushing heavy strollers uphill. The re-splitting of the core releases some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means they tend to decay with little or no stimulation.
The surface of the Moon consists of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
Thinner under the seas, and thicker under the mountains.
On the closer side, there might be more marimo because the shell is thinner. It was easier to lift the lava to the surface.
Content theories are focused on finding out what leads people to behave in a certain way or what attracts them.
These theories suggest that people have certain needs and/or desires that have evolved beyond their childhood into adulthood.
These theories examine what drives people to want what they do and what in their environment will compel them to do or not do certain things.
Two popular theories of satisfaction are Maslow's hierarchy of needs theory and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, two types of behavior can emerge when managers start managing their former peers. At one end of the spectrum is the attempt to remain "one of the guys" (or the girls).
This type of manager has difficulty making unpopular decisions, enforcing disciplinary measures, evaluating staff, assigning tasks, and holding employees accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, one transforms into an unrecognizable individual who feels they must change everything the team has done and make it their own.
Ultimately, the leader is the one who ultimately bears responsibility for both the success and failure of the team.
This kind of behavior often results in disagreement between the leader and the rest of the team.
Virtual teams adhere to the same standards of excellence as traditional teams, although there are some differences.
Members of the virtual team often function as a point of contact for their physical groups.
They often have greater autonomy than other team members because their teams may be composed of members in different time zones, which their local management may not understand.
A unique component of a virtual team is also the presence of a true "invisible team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109).
"The Invisible Team" is a management team to which every member is accountable. This team sets standards for each member.
Why would an organization want to go through a process that requires the establishment of a learning organization? One goal of implementing the concepts of organizational learning in practice is innovation.
When all available resources are used efficiently in functional departments of an organization, creativity and genius can emerge.
As a result, the organizational process in which cooperation takes place to overcome obstacles can lead to a new innovative process for meeting client needs.
Before an organization can become innovative, management must establish a culture of innovation, as well as shared knowledge and organizational learning.
Angel (2006) explains the continuum approach as a method used to help organizations reach a higher level of performance.
Neurobiological data provide physical evidence for a theoretical approach to the study of cognition. Therefore, they narrow the scope of research and make it much more precise.
The link between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that various types of brain damage, trauma, lesions, and brain tumors affect behavior and trigger changes in specific mental functions.
The advancement of new technologies allows us to observe and explore brain structures and processes that have never been seen before.
This gives us a large number of information and materials for building simulation models that help us understand the processes in our minds.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction context, it represents an exceptionally significant branch of computer science that deals with the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptation of machines.
Research in the field of artificial intelligence (AI) involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and sequencing, the ability to provide responses to diagnoses and client questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and facial recognition.
Such things have become separate disciplines focused on providing solutions to everyday problems.
Artificial intelligence systems are now frequently used in the fields of economics, medicine, engineering, and the military, and are also integrated into several home computer applications and video games.
Field trips are an important part of every class. The teacher often would like to take her students to places where traveling by bus is not an option.
Technology offers a solution in the form of virtual tours. Students can view artifacts in museums, visit an aquarium, or admire beautiful art while sitting in the classroom.
Virtual tours are also a great way to look back on a trip and share experiences with future students.
For example, every year students at Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. This website changes every year, but older versions are kept online and serve as an album.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Although students often start their experience on a blog with careless grammar and spelling, the presence of an audience usually changes that.
Considering that students are often the audience with the most criticism, the blogger starts striving to improve their writing to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, writing blogs "forces students to become more aware of the world around them." The need to cater to the interests of the audience inspires students to be smart and interesting (Toto, 2004).
Blogging is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages students to extend the learning process beyond the traditional school day.
The appropriate use of blogs "can encourage students to start thinking more analytically and critically. By actively responding to materials found on the Internet, students can define their position in the context of what others are writing and can express their own opinion on specific issues (Oravec, 2002)."
The city of Ottawa is a charming, bilingual capital of Canada, home to numerous art galleries and museums showcasing the past and present of Canada.
The Niagara Falls are located further south, while the north features the untapped natural beauty of Muskoka and other regions.
All of this and much more highlights Ontario as what outsiders consider fundamentally Canadian.
Large areas further north are quite sparsely populated, and some represent almost uninhabited wilderness.
Here's a population comparison that surprises many: more African Americans live in the US than Canadian citizens.
The East African Islands are in the Indian Ocean, along the right coast of Africa.
Madagascar is by far the largest and represents a continent unto itself when it comes to wilderness.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or are linked to France and are known as luxurious resorts with beaches.
Arabs also brought Islam to those countries, which became particularly established in the Comoros and Mayotte.
European influence and the conquest of colonies began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered a sea route from Europe to India.
The area to the north is surrounded by the Sahel, and to the south and west, the Atlantic Ocean.
Women: it is recommended that all female travelers say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
It might also help if you wear a ring (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women should understand that cultural differences can lead to things they would consider harassment, and it's not uncommon for someone to follow them, grab their hand, etc.
Be decisive in rejecting men and don't be afraid to stand your ground (regardless of cultural differences, it's not okay!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by a fisherman from the Berber tribe in the 10th century BC, and it was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it under the name Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake that occurred in 1755.
The Moroccan Sultan rebuilt the city as Dar al-Bida, and the Spanish traders who established trading posts there gave it the name Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, nargiles, and a whole spectrum of geomagics, but it's all made for tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, in the far east of the country, near Rwanda.
In 2002, gum was destroyed by a lava flow from the Nyiragongo volcano, which flooded most of the city's streets, especially in the center.
Although Goma is reasonably safe, all visits outside of Goma should be investigated to understand the state of the ongoing fighting in North Kivu province.
This city is also the starting point for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and offers one of the cheapest gorilla trekking experiences in Africa.
You can use a boda-boda (motorcycle taxi) to get around Goma. The standard (local) price for a short ride is approximately 500 Congolese francs.
Due to the fact that it is quite inaccessible, "Timbuktu" began to be used as a metaphor for an exotic, distant land.
Today, Timbuktu is a impoverished city, although it is a tourist attraction due to its reputation and has an airport.
In 1990, it was added to the list of world cultural heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sand.
It was one of the main stops during PBS's special program Wonders of the African World hosted by Henry Louis Gates.
This city completely differs from other cities in the country because it has more Arab than African style.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in the northeast of South Africa and extends along the border with Mozambique to the east and Zimbabwe to the north, with the Crocodile River forming its southern border.
The park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each of which supports different wildlife.
It represents one of the main attractions of South Africa and is considered the leading South African national park (SANParks).
As in all South African national parks, there are daily fees for conservation and entry to the park.
It might be useful to buy a Wild Card that allows entry to some parks in South Africa or to all South African national parks.
The island of Hong Kong gave its name to the territory of Hong Kong and represents a place that many tourists consider the main point of visit.
The parade of buildings that make up the skyline of Hong Kong is connected to a dazzling graphic visible thanks to the presence of the waters of Victoria Harbour.
For the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and head to Kowloon harbor on the other side.
Most of Hong Kong's urban area is densely built on reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place that the British colonizers took for themselves, so if you are looking for evidence of the territory's colonial past, you can start here.
Sundarbans is the largest coastal mangrove forest in the world, extending 80 km (50 miles) along the coast in the hinterland of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been declared a UNESCO World Heritage site. Part of the forest within the Indian territory is called Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forests are not just salty swamps - they include some of the last remaining powerful jungles that once covered the Gangetic Plain.
Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which almost one-third is covered by water/swampy areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a refuge for wildlife, and it is estimated that around 400 royal Bengal tigers and nearly 30,000 spotted deer live in this area today.
Buses depart from the bus station (across the river) throughout the day, although most, especially those going east and to Jakar/Bumthang, depart between 6:30 and 7:30 AM.
Since inter-district buses are often full, it is recommended to buy tickets several days in advance.
Most districts are served by small Japanese buses that are comfortable and sturdy.
A shared taxi ride is a quick and easy way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The bridge over the Oyapock River is a suspension bridge. It spans the Oyapock River, connecting the cities of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyjapock in French Guiana.
Two towers rise 83 meters in height, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes that are 3.50 meters wide.
The clearance height under the bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, but the bridge was not opened to traffic until March 2017.
Most should have been fully operational by September 2017, when Brazilian customs checkpoints were expected to be completed.
The Guaraní were the most significant indigenous community that inhabited the area of present-day eastern Paraguay. They lived as semi-nomadic hunters who also practiced subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region was home to other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survived by hunting, gathering fruits, and fishing.
Paraguay, formerly known as the "Giant Province of India," was founded in the 16th century after the encounter between Spanish conquerors and the indigenous native groups.
The Spanish began a period of colonization that lasted three centuries.
Since its founding in 1537, Paraguay has managed to retain much of its original character and identity.
Argentina is well-known for having some of the best teams and players in the world.
The largest annual polo tournament is held in Las Cañitas in December.
Small tournaments and matches can be followed here at any time of the year.
For news about tournaments and places where you can buy tickets for the polo matches, check with Asociacion Argentina de Polo.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falklands pound (FKP), whose value is equivalent to one British pound (GBP).
On the islands, it's possible to exchange money at the only bank located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
British pounds will be accepted almost everywhere on the islands, and in the city of Stanley, both credit cards and US dollars are also frequently accepted.
Credit cards are likely not accepted on remote islands, although it may be possible to accept British currency and US dollars; check in advance with the owners what payment methods are accepted.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside the islands, so exchange your money before you leave.
Given that Montevideo is located south of the equator, summer there occurs when it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical climate; temperatures above +30°C are common in the summer months.
Winters can be deceptively cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but due to the combination of wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer shows.
There are no distinct "wet" and "dry" seasons: the amount of rain is approximately the same throughout the year.
Although many animals in the park are used to encounters with people, wild animals are still wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
Park owners order you to stay at least 100 yards/meters away from bears and wolves and 25 yards/meters from all other wild animals!
Despite appearing docile, bison, elk, moose, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors get injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous. Therefore, give them space.
Moreover, don't forget that smells attract bears and other wild animals, so avoid carrying or cooking food that smells and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and is the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
Luka was the place where the infamous maritime deadlock occurred in 1889, when seven ships from Germany, the USA, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 American and German lives were lost.
During the fight for independence organized by the Mau movement, a peaceful gathering in the city ended with the assassination of paramount chief Tupua Tamasese Lealofia III.
There are many beaches because Auckland borders two harbors. The most famous beaches are located in three areas.
The beaches on the northern coast (in the North Harbour district) are on the Pacific Ocean and stretch along Long Bay to the north to Devonport to the south.
Almost all the beaches are sandy and safe for swimming, and many people get shade from the plane trees.
The beaches along Tamaki Drive are located in Waitemata Harbour, in the suburb of the upper part of Mission Bay and St Heliers in Central Auckland.
Those are sometimes crowded family beaches with a good assortment of shops lining the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Broj 1," and it's not a complex beer, but pleasant and refreshing. The other local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines that can be drunk, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
The local tap water is completely safe to drink, but if you're worried, you can easily find bottled water.
The idea of "flat white" coffee is foreign to Australians. A short black is an "espresso," cappuccino is topped with lots of cream (not foam), and tea is drunk without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Fruit juices are expensive, but they are excellent.
Throughout the year, trips to the ridge are organized, and injuries on the ridge are rare.
However, listen to the advice given to you by the authorities, respect all signs, and pay special attention to safety warnings.
Jellyfish appear near beaches and river mouths from October to April, north of the city, since 1770. Occasionally, they can also be seen outside of this period.
Sharks exist, however they rarely attack people. Most sharks are afraid of people and would swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles do not live permanently in the ocean. Their primary habitat is the river estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance ensures the traveler's peace of mind, knowing they will have accommodation upon arrival at their destination.
Travel agencies often have agreements with specific hotels, although you can see that it is possible to book other types of accommodation through an agency, such as campsites.
Tourist agencies usually offer packages that include breakfast, transfer to/from the airport, or even a combination of flights and hotel accommodation.
They can hold your reservation if you want to consider the offer or obtain other documents required for travel to that destination (e.g., a visa).
All changes or requests should first be directed to the travel agency, not directly to the hotel.
When it comes to certain festivals, the vast majority of music festival visitors choose to camp on site, and most visitors consider this an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the action, you will have to arrive early to secure a camping spot near the music.
Remember that even though the musical performances on the main stages are over, music might still be playing late into the night at some parts of the festival.
At some festivals, there are special camping areas for families with young children.
If you cross the Northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin position because passing through ice causes terrible noise for those who are most affected.
Cruises in St. Petersburg also include time spent in the city. Passengers on cruises are exempt from visa requirements (see conditions).
Casinos usually make great efforts to maximize the money and time guests spend. There are usually no windows or clocks, and it is difficult to find the exits.
They mainly have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to maintain the good mood of guests and keep them at the facilities.
In some places, alcoholic beverages are served on the house. However, drunkenness impairs the ability to reason, and all experienced gamblers know how important it is to stay sober.
Anyone planning to drive at high altitude or over mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, or low temperatures.
On icy and snowy roads, the friction is low, and it's not possible to drive as you would on clear asphalt.
During snowstorms, enough snow can fall very quickly to get you stuck.
Visibility can be limited by falling snow, a blizzard, condensation, or ice that forms on vehicle windows.
On the other hand, ice and snow are normal occurrences in many countries, and traffic generally continues to flow without disruption throughout the year.
Safari is perhaps the best tourist experience in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The term "safari" is commonly used to describe a land journey to view the stunning African wilderness, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, often approach cars closely, and the standard equipment will allow you a good view.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards are sometimes shy, and you can see them better if you look through binoculars.
A safari walk (also known as "bush walk," "safari hiking," or "trekking") consists of hiking for several hours or several days.
The Paralympics will be held from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Some sporting events will also take place in other locations throughout Japan.
Tokyo will be the only Asian city to have hosted two Summer Olympics, as it already hosted in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodation for 2020 before the postponement announcement, you might find yourself in an awkward situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most cancellation policies caused by the coronavirus are not being extended until July 2020, when the Olympics are scheduled to take place.
It is expected that most tickets will cost between 2,500 and 130,000 yen, and the price of standard tickets will be around 7,000 yen.
Ironing damp clothes can speed up their drying. In many hotels, it's possible to borrow an iron and ironing board, even if they aren't in the room.
If an iron isn't available or you don't like wearing ironed socks, you can try using a hairdryer if one is available.
Be careful not to overheat the fabric (which can cause shrinking or, in extreme cases, scorching).
There are different ways to purify water; some are more effective depending on the specific threats.
In some areas, it's enough to boil water for one minute, while in others it takes several minutes.
Filters vary in effectiveness, and if you're concerned, consider buying bottled water from a reputable manufacturer.
Passengers may encounter animal pests that they haven't seen in their regions.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or in the worst case, an allergic reaction, spread poison, or transmit infectious diseases.
The same infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill people by force, are usually not classified as pests.
Shopping in tax-free stores is an opportunity to buy products that are exempt from tax and excise duties in specific locations.
Passengers traveling to countries with high tax rates can sometimes save a significant amount of money, especially on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont has the most challenging highway driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh route, as the road often passes through isolated wooded areas.
If you're not used to driving on country roads, be prepared: the road is dominated by steep terrain, narrow lanes, and sharp curves.
The speed limits are noticeably lower than on the preceding and following sections – usually 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h) – and strict adherence is even more important than usual.
It's interesting that mobile reception here is much stronger than on many other sections of the route, e.g., in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German pastries are quite good, and in Bavaria they are quite rich and diverse, similar to those made by their southern neighbors, the Austrians.
Fruit pastries are common - apples are cooked in dough throughout the year, and cherries and plums appear during the summer.
Many German pastries contain almonds, hazelnuts, and other nuts. Popular cakes are often a good complement to a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a little but rich pastry, try a pastry that is called Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region.
Kari is a dish based on plants and spices, together with meat or vegetables.
Kari can be "dry" or "wet" depending on the amount of liquid.
In the inland regions of northern India and Pakistan, yogurt is often used in curries. Coconut milk is frequently used in southern India and some other coastal regions of the subcontinent.
With a selection of 17,000 islands, Indonesian cuisine is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of regional gastronomy found throughout the nation.
However, if used without additional qualifiers, the term usually refers to food that originally comes from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine, now available throughout the archipelago, features a variety of simply seasoned dishes. The dominant flavors that Javanese people enjoy are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese coconut sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Uzengis are support for the rider's feet that hang on either side of the saddle.
They offer greater stability to the rider, but can cause safety problems because the rider's feet can get stuck in them.
If a rider is thrown from a horse and their foot remains in the stirrup, the horse could drag them if it starts to run. To minimize the risk, many safety measures can be taken as a precaution.
First of all, most riders wear riding boots with both a heel and a flat, quite narrow sole.
Furthermore, saddles, especially English saddles, should have safety latches that allow leather stirrups to fall off the saddle if the rider is pulled in a fall.
In the Cochamó Valley – a top climbing destination in Chile, known as the Yosemite of South America – there are various large granite walls and cracks.
The ascents include breathtaking views from the summits. Climbers from all over the world are constantly discovering new routes through its endless potential of walls.
Snow sports that involve descending a slope, such as skiing and snowboarding, are popular sports in which you descend snow-covered terrain on skis or boards attached to your feet.
Skiing is the main recreational activity for many enthusiasts, sometimes known as "ski addicts," who plan their entire vacations around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old - pictures from caves depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Alpine skiing as a sport dates back to at least the 17th century, and the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia in 1861.
Backcountry skiing: This activity is also known as ski touring or ski mountaineering/ski hiking.
It's connected to alpine skiing or hiking, but usually doesn't include it, with the latter being done on steep terrain and requiring much more curved skis and boots.
Think of a ski slope as a trail similar to a hiking trail.
Under good conditions, you will be able to cover greater distances than on foot, but you will rarely achieve the speeds of ski running without a heavy backpack and on groomed trails.
Europe is a relatively small continent, but with many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling through multiple countries would require repeatedly going through the visa application process and passport control.
However, the Schengen area in this regard functions as one country.
As long as you are in this zone, you can cross borders without re-entering passport control.
Similarly, if you have a Schengen visa, you do not have to apply for a visa for each member country of the Schengen area separately, which saves time, money, and reduces paperwork.
There is no universal definition for determining which objects are antiques. Some tax agencies define antiques as objects older than 100 years.
The definition has geographical variations, where the age limit could be shorter in places like North America than in Europe.
Handmade products could be defined as antiques, although they are newer compared to similar goods from mass production.
Raising fallow deer is an important means of livelihood for Sami, and the culture surrounding trade is also important for many with other professions.
Even traditionally, not all Sámi were involved in large-scale reindeer herding, but rather lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, raising reindeer mainly as draft animals.
Today, many members of the Sámi people are involved in modern commerce. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, a region where the Sámi live.
Although widely used, especially among non-Romani populations, the word "Cigan" is often considered offensive because it is associated with negative stereotypes and an inaccurate perception of Roma.
If the country you plan to visit becomes the subject of a travel advisory, this may affect your travel insurance or trip cancellation insurance.
You can consult the advice of other governments, but their advice is intended for their own citizens.
One example is the fact that American citizens in the Middle East can face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice merely represents a summary of the political situation in a given country.
The presented views are often brief, general, and simplified compared to the more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a generic term for any dangerous weather phenomenon with the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of life.
Severe weather can occur anywhere in the world. Weather events can be of different types, which can depend on geography, topography, and atmospheric conditions.
Storms, cities, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of severe weather, as well as storms with thunder, tornadoes, downpours, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal weather phenomena include blizzards, snowstorms, ice storms, and sandstorms.
Passengers are advised to be aware of any risks that bad weather may pose to their area, as severe weather can affect travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country that can be considered a war zone should have professional training.
By searching the Internet for "Hostile Environment Course," you will likely find the address of a local company.
The course usually covers all the topics discussed here in far more detail, often with practical experience.
The course usually lasts from 2 to 5 days and involves role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapons training.
Books and journals dealing with wilderness survival are common, but few publications address the topic of war zones.
Passengers planning gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid documents for their return journey.
The readiness of the government to issue passports (X) that do not state gender or documents that are updated to match the desired name and gender is uneven.
The willingness of foreign governments to act in accordance with these documents also varies greatly.
Searches at checkpoints also became much more intrusive in the period after September 11, 2001.
Transgender people who have not yet had surgery should not expect to go through a scanner and maintain their privacy and dignity.
Return currents are returning currents of waves that hit the shore, often a ridge or something similar.
Due to the underwater topography, the return flow is concentrated in several deeper areas, and fast currents can occur there towards deeper water.
The majority of deaths occur due to exhaustion, which happens when a swimmer tries to swim against the current, which can be impossible.
As soon as you disconnect from the power, swimming back isn't any harder than usual.
Try to aim somewhere you won't be caught again, or, depending on your skills and whether you've been noticed, you might want to wait for rescue.
The shock of re-entry comes before culture shock (with fewer stages of the honeymoon), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Passengers who easily adapted to the new culture sometimes find it especially difficult to readjust to their native culture.
When you return home after living abroad, you've already adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you first went abroad, people were probably patient and understanding because they knew that travelers need to adapt to a new country.
People may not expect that both patience and understanding are necessary for travelers returning home.
The sound and light effects of the pyramids are some of the most interesting things in the children's section.
You can see the pyramids in the dark, and you can also see them in the silence before the start of the performance.
You usually always hear the sound of tourists and vendors. The story of sound and light is like a fairy tale.
The sphinx is placed in the background and tells a long story.
Scenes are displayed on the pyramids and various pyramids are illuminated.
Several countries lay claim to the South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, and there are the most bases on them, with as many as sixteen active bases in 2020.
The archipelago is located 120 km north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island with a settlement called Villa Las Estrellas.
The remaining islands include Livingston and Deception Islands, where the flooded caldera of an active volcano forms a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth is an area south of the peninsula, bordered by the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains of the peninsula merge into plateaus, and then rise again into a 360 km long mountain range called the Ellsworth Mountains, split by the Minnesota Glacier.
The highest mountains in Antarctica are located in the northern part of the Sentinel Range, known as the Vinson Massif, whose peak, Mount Vinson, is 4892 m high.
In remote areas not covered by mobile networks, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones generally do not replace mobile phones because you have to call in an open area with a clear line of sight to the satellite.
This service is often used in cargo shipping by ship, including recreational vessels, as well as in expeditions that require data and voice message exchange over long distances.
Your local phone service provider should provide you with more information on connecting to this service.
It's becoming an increasingly popular option for those planning to travel and study for a year.
This is very popular with graduating students, as it allows them to pause their studies for a year before starting university without jeopardizing their education.
In many cases, enrolling in a course abroad during the year can actually improve your chances of transitioning to higher education in your home country.
Tuition is usually charged for enrollment in these educational programs.
Finland is an excellent destination for boating. The "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands on its lakes and coastal archipelagos.
You don't need a yacht on the archipelagos and lakes.
Although the coastal archipelagos and the largest lakes are truly large enough for any yacht, smaller boats or even kayaks offer a different experience.
Boating is a national pastime in Finland, where there is one boat for every seven or eight people.
The activity is almost the same in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but apart from that it is quite unique (e.g., in the Netherlands, that number is from one to forty).
Most of the different cruises in the Baltic Sea include an extended stay in St. Petersburg, Russia.
That means you can visit a historical city for a few days and return to the ship at night to sleep.
If you only go to the shore as part of a boat trip, you will not need a special visa (since 2009).
Please ensure your brochures include Berlin, Germany in their itineraries. As you can see on the map, Berlin is not near the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise price.
Air travel can be a daunting experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they haven't flown before or had a traumatic experience.
That's nothing to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and aversion to other things that many people have.
Understanding how airplanes work and what happens during flight can help some people overcome fear stemming from the unknown and lack of control.
Courier companies are well-paid for fast delivery of goods. Time is often crucial for business documents, goods, or spare parts needed for urgent repairs.
For some routes, larger companies have their own planes, but for other routes, smaller companies have run into problems.
If things are shipped by air, it may take several days for unloading and customs clearance on some routes.
The only way to ship it was to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations do not allow them to send baggage without the passenger, and that's where you come in.
An obvious way to travel first or business class is to open your wallet and set aside a pile of money for the privilege (or, even better, your company does it for you).
However, it's not cheap: generally you can expect to pay up to four times more for business class than the regular price of economy class and eleven times more for first class!
Generally speaking, there's no point even trying to get discounts on seats in business or first class for direct flights from point A to point B.
Airlines are well aware that there is a certain group of passengers who are willing to pay a lot to get somewhere quickly and comfortably, and they charge accordingly.
Chișinău is the capital of Moldova. The native language is Romanian, but Russian is used in many places.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic that has gone through an ethnic conflict.
That conflict in 1994 resulted in the establishment of the self-proclaimed Pridnestrovian Moldavian Republic in eastern Moldova, which has a government and currency, but has not been recognized by any member state of the UN.
Economic ties have been established between these two parts of Moldova despite unsuccessful political negotiations.
The most widespread religion in Moldova is Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with nearly 3.7 million inhabitants, the second largest port after Istanbul, and a very good transportation hub.
Once upon a time it was the ancient city of Smyrna, but now it is a modern, developed, and bustling commercial center situated around a huge bay and surrounded by mountains.
Wide boulevards, buildings with glass facades and modern shopping centers are adorned with traditional roofs of red tiles, a 18th-century market, and old mosques and churches, although this city has more of the atmosphere of Mediterranean Europe than traditional Turkey.
From the village of Haldarsvík, there is a view of the nearby island of Eysturoy, and the village is home to an unusual octagonal church.
Above some of the graves in the churchyard, there are interesting marble dove sculptures.
It was worth taking a walk through the intriguing village for half an hour.
North and near the city lies Sintra, a romantic and fascinating city that became known to foreigners after Lord Byron noted a brilliant depiction of its splendor.
The Scotturb 403 bus regularly travels to Sintra and stops at Cabo da Roca.
In the north, visit the great shrine of Our Lady of Fatima (shrine), a place of the apparitions of Mary, which are known throughout the world.
Don't forget that you are essentially visiting a mass grave site, as well as a place of immeasurable significance for a huge part of the world's population.
There are still many living men and women who survived their time here, and many more whose loved ones were killed or worked to death here, equally Jews and non-Jews.
Please conduct yourselves with dignity, formality, and respect that it deserves. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not defile the place by painting or carving graffiti on buildings.
In Barcelona, Catalan and Spanish are the official languages. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most of them understand it, and almost everyone speaks Spanish.
However, most of the signs are listed only in Catalan, as it is the first official language according to the law.
However, the Spanish language is also used quite a bit in public transport and other establishments.
Regular announcements in the Metro are made only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced automatically by a system in several languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
Parisians are known for their reputation as egocentric, rude, and arrogant people.
Although this is often just an inaccurate stereotype, it is still the best way to get along with others in Paris – to behave politely, like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make getting around much easier.
The superficial appearance of Parisians will quickly disappear if you show basic kindness.
Plitvice Lakes National Park is located in vast forests, mainly beech, spruce, and fir, and boasts a mix of alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
Thanks to the range of microclimates, diverse soil, and varying altitudes, it has a very wide variety of plant communities.
This area is also home to a very wide variety of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wild cat, and genet can be found there, as well as many common species.
When visiting monasteries, women must wear skirts below the knee and cover their shoulders.
Most monasteries give scarves to women who arrive unprepared, but if you bring your own, especially those with light colors, you will receive a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear shorts below the knee.
And you can borrow this at the entrance, but the clothing isn't washed after each use, so you might not feel comfortable wearing these shawls. One size fits all for men!
Majorcan cuisine, like cuisines from similar regions of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and olive oil is used for everything.
A simple, popular dinner, especially during the summer, is Pa amb Oli – bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available seasonings and accompaniments like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, along with the word "Sie" for "you" (formal), are always written with a capital letter, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish certain verbs and objects.
This can undoubtedly ease reading, although writing is somewhat more complex due to the need to determine whether the verb or adjective is used in the noun form.
Pronunciation is relatively easy in Italian because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
Care should be taken with the letters c and g because their pronunciation depends on the following vowel.
Also, make an effort to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently - "caro" means dear, while "carro" means military vehicle.
The Persian language has a relatively easy and mostly regular grammar.
Therefore, reading this grammar textbook will help you learn a lot about Persian grammar and better understand phrases.
It goes without saying that you will find it easier to learn Portuguese if you speak another Romance language.
However, people who know a little Spanish might rashly conclude that Portuguese is similar enough to not need to be learned separately.
Predmodern observatories are now obsolete and are maintained as museums, or places for education.
Considering that slight pollution wasn't a problem like it is today, they are usually found in cities or campuses and it's easier to get to them than to those built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are huge objects located in remote places with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Observing the cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
That concept originated from China, where the plum blossom was the flower of choice.
The Emperor held the first cherry blossom viewing party of spring in Japan exclusively for himself and the other members of the aristocracy gathered around the imperial court.
Plants look their best when in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to remove even "just one" specimen.
If you visit a formally organized garden, you will also be ejected without question for collecting "samples."
Singapore is generally an extremely safe place to stay, where it's easy to get around and you can buy almost anything after you arrive.
However, if you are in the "high tropics," just a few degrees north of the equator, you will have to endure both heat (always) and strong sun (less often when the sky is clear).
Several buses are going north towards Hebron, a traditional site where the biblical patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives are buried.
Check if the bus you plan to take goes to Hebron, and not just to the neighboring Jewish settlement of Kiryat Arba.
Inland waterways can be a good theme around which to plan a vacation.
For example, visiting the châteaux of the Loire Valley, the Rhine Valley, or cruising to interesting cities on the Danube, or taking a boat trip along the Erie Canal.
They also define routes for popular hiking and biking trails.
Christmas is one of the most important holidays in Christianity, and it is celebrated as the day of Jesus' birth.
Many traditions associated with holidays have been adopted by non-believers in Christian countries and non-Christians around the world.
There is a tradition of not sleeping on Easter night and watching the sunrise from an open place.
There are, of course, Christian theological explanations for this tradition, but it could also be a pre-Christian ritual of spring and fertility.
More traditional churches hold Easter vigils on Saturday evening during the Easter weekend, and members of the congregation begin celebrating precisely at midnight to commemorate the resurrection of Christ.
All animals that originally arrived on the islands did so by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to the great distance from the continent, mammals were unable to reach the islands, which made the giant tortoise the primary herbivore on the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have also arrived, such as goats, horses, cows, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic during the winter, you will experience polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This is a good opportunity to see the Northern Lights, as the sky will be dark for 24 hours.
Light pollution often isn't a problem because areas are sparsely populated and you'll be able to enjoy the view of the stars.
Japanese work culture is based on hierarchy and formalities more than Westerners are accustomed to.
Suits are standard business attire, and workers address each other by last name or their positions.
Harmony in the workplace is key because it emphasizes the group's effort rather than individual achievements.
Workers often have to get approval from their superiors for all decisions they make, and they are expected to follow instructions from their superiors without complaint.
