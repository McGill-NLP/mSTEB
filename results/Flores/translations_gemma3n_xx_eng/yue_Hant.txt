This not only confirms the widely held theory that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, but also provides details that fossils usually cannot offer, such as color and three-dimensional arrangement.
Scientists say that the feathers of this animal are chestnut-colored on top and light-colored or carrot-colored on the bottom.
This discovery also allows us to gain a deeper understanding of the evolution of bird feathers.
Due to the dinosaurs' feathers lacking developed feather shafts (called "rachis"), but possessing other feather characteristics (barbs and down filaments), researchers infer that the rachis may have evolved later from other features.
The structure of the feathers shows they were not used for flight, but rather for thermoregulation or display. Researchers believe that although this is a tail from a young dinosaur, the specimen shows feathers from an adult dinosaur, not a juvenile one.
Researchers believe that although this is a tail of a young dinosaur, the sample shows feathers of an adult dinosaur, not juvenile feathers.

The effect that the team is looking for is caused by the tidal gravity between galactic dark matter and dark matter between galaxies.
Just as the Moon's gravity creates tides on Earth, the Milky Way exerts gravitational force on the Andromeda Galaxy.
Scientists can conclude that the effect of dark matter on other dark matter is the same as its effect on ordinary matter.
This theory suggests that most of the dark matter surrounding a galaxy is located in a halo-like region similar to a galaxy, and is composed of many small particles.

In France, voting has traditionally been a low-tech experience: voters alone in a polling booth fill in their chosen candidates on a pre-printed ballot and then place it in an envelope.
After the staff verifies the voter's identity, the voter will then put the envelope into the ballot box and sign the voting register.
French electoral law employs quite strict standards in drafting election procedures.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and observers can witness that there are no envelopes inside at the start of voting, and that only envelopes cast by properly verified and authorized voters are put inside, with no other envelopes being placed inside.
Candidates can send representatives to witness every part of the election process. In the evening, volunteers count the votes according to designated procedures under strict supervision.

Uka's weapon malfunctioned while pointing at the fifth person's head. Schneider continued to feel pain, with one eye blinded, a piece of his skull missing, and requiring titanium reconstruction of his face.
Schneider testified via video link from a U.S. Air Force base in his hometown.
Besides the Wednesday match, Capanedo also participated in the two individual events of the championship.
Her first event was the lap race, but she failed to complete it. Among the 116 participants, 36 people had the same result in that race.
Her other competition was the long jump, where she ranked tenth in the women's all-around event with a combined time of 4 minutes 41.30 seconds, slower than Claudia Roche of Austria, who ranked first, by 2 minutes 11.60 seconds, and slower than Gabor Dani of Hungary, who ranked ninth, by 1 minute 09.02 seconds.
None of the four female athletes in the sit ski category finished the race, and a total of 45 out of 117 athletes in the big circle jump event failed to place.
Central Bureau of Police found the stolen laptop and mobile phone.
Deputy Inspector General D. K. Arya said, "We have arrested five people in connection with the rape of the Swiss woman and have recovered her mobile phone and laptop."
The defendant's names are Baba Kanjar, Bhutha Kanjar, Rampro Kanjar, Gaza Kanjar, and Vishnu Kanjar.
The police chief, Chandra Shekhar Solanki, stated that the accused appeared in court with their face covered.
Although three people were inside the house when the car crashed into it, fortunately no one was injured.
However, the driver sustained a severe head injury.
The road at the scene of the car accident is temporarily closed to allow emergency personnel to rescue the driver from the red Audi TT.
Initially, he was hospitalized at James Page Hospital in Daye Maofu.
Subsequently, he was transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
After that, Adekoya was accused of murdering her son and stood trial at the Justice of the Peace Court in Edinburgh.
She is currently being detained, awaiting prosecution and trial, but any witness evidence may be compromised due to the widespread circulation of her photos.
This is a common practice in other parts of the UK, but Scotland's legal system is different, and the courts believe publishing photos could constitute bias.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of Dengdi University pointed out: "If reporters release photos of suspects, it seems to be a dangerous thing."
The Crown Prosecution Service in the UK, which is fully responsible for the prosecution, told reporters that it would not comment further before the indictment.
According to leaked information, this document concerns a border dispute, with Palestine hoping to base it on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
According to reports, other discussion topics include the future status of Jerusalem, holy to both countries, and the Jordan River issue.
After Israel demanded to sign a ceasefire agreement, it continued to station troops in the Jordan Valley for 10 years, while the Palestinian Authority only agreed to the Israeli military stationing troops for 5 years.
Shooting personnel participating in the supplementary trial for pest control will be under the close supervision of forest rangers, and the trial will also be monitored and the results evaluated.
The National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is collaborating with the Australian Shooting Sports Association (NSW) to recruit eligible volunteers to participate in the NSW's hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flaherty, the Director of Park Conservation and Cultural Resources for the National Parks and Recreation Department, the four marksmen selected for the first shooting operation have undergone comprehensive safety and training guidance.
Maltelli yesterday announced the establishment of a temporary election committee (CEP) composed of 9 members.
This is the fifth CEP in the four years since Martelli.
Last month, a presidential commission recommended that the former CEP resign as part of measures to push the country towards new elections.
This committee is a response to the large-scale anti-government demonstrations that began in October.
These protests were triggered by the lack of elections (some elections haven't been held since 2011), and sometimes they even escalated into violent clashes.
Approximately 60 reports of iPods malfunctioning due to overheating have been received, resulting in six fires and four people suffering minor burns.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) said authorities have noted 27 incidents related to the device.
METI announced last week that Apple had reported an additional 34 overheating incidents to them, which the company considers "not serious."
The provincial department responded, saying Apple's delay in releasing the report is "really regrettable."
The earthquake in the Mariana Islands occurred at 07:19 local time (09:19 GMT Friday afternoon).
The emergency management office of Northern Mariana Islands stated that the nation has not received any damage reports.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also stated that there were no signs of a tsunami at the time.
A former Filipino police officer in Manila, the capital of the Philippines, hijacked a bus carrying Hong Kong tourists and took them hostage.
Rolando Mendoza fired a M16 rifle at tourists.
Some hostages have been rescued, with at least six deaths confirmed so far.
Six people, including children and elderly people, and a Filipino photographer were released early.
Later, those photographers replaced an elderly woman who needed to use the restroom. Mendoza was shot.
Li Jins followed in his father's footsteps and began his medical career.
He received training from an obstetrician and began working at Oakland's National Women's Hospital in 1959.
During his time working at the hospital, Ling Si began to use his spare time to research the problem of premature birth.
His research shows that taking a certain hormone will accelerate fetal lung growth.
Xinhua News Agency reported that government investigators discovered two "black boxes" flight recorders on Wednesday.
Other wrestling athletes also paid tribute to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Empress and also my first manager. She passed away on a night of two moons, and was as unique and strong as she was."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented: "Luna and I are both mischievous... perhaps even more so than I... I love her and I will miss her... I hope she's gone to a better place."
Among the 1,400 respondents interviewed before the 2010 federal election, the number of people opposing Australia becoming a republic increased by 8% compared to 2008.
Governor-General Julia Gillard said in the 2010 federal election that she believed Australia should become a republic when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends.
34% of respondents share the same view, hoping that Queen Elizabeth II of England will be the last monarch of Australia.
From an extreme perspective, 29% of respondents believe Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31% believe Australia should never become a republic.
This Olympic gold medalist was supposed to participate in the 100-meter and 200-meter freestyle races and the 4x100-meter relay at the Commonwealth Games, but his complaints have kept his health in question.
He has一直 been unable to take the medication needed to overcome his pain because it is banned by the Olympics. (Note: "一直" is translated as "been" to convey the continuous nature of the inability.)
On January 25th, Curtis Cooper, a mathematics and computer science professor at the University of Missouri-Kansas City in the United States, discovered the largest known prime number to date.
In the second month of the lunar calendar, a few people used different hardware and software to verify this discovery, and it was announced on Tuesday.
Comets may be a source of water and organic matter on Earth, which can form proteins and sustain life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets form, especially how Earth formed, because a long time ago comets once collided with Earth.
Komo, who is 53 years old, started serving as governor earlier this year and signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage last month.
He described these rumors as "political noise and foolishness."
It is speculated that he will run for president in 2016.
The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration says that the NextGen system can shorten flight routes, save millions of gallons of fuel annually, and reduce carbon emissions.
It uses satellite technology, rather than outdated ground radar technology, enabling air traffic controllers to locate aircraft more precisely and provide pilots with more accurate information.
No additional transportation will be provided, and the shuttle bus will not stop at Wembley. There are also no parking lots or park-and-ride facilities on the ground.
Due to public concern about a lack of transportation, the competition may be forced to be held behind closed doors without fans in attendance.
A study published in the journal *Science* on Thursday reports the formation of a new bird species in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that people have long believed evolution takes a long time, but due to interbreeding between local Darwin's finches (Geospiza fortes) and introduced cactus finches (Geospiza conirostris), a new species evolved in just two generations.
Gold can be shaped into different forms, and it can also be rolled into thin shapes.
It can be drawn into fine filaments, then twisted and braided. It can also be pressed or rolled into sheets.
Gold can also be made into very thin sheets and glued onto other metals. Sometimes it is even thin enough to be used for decorating hand-drawn illustrations in books, known as "gold leaf manuscript decoration."
This is called the pH value of a chemical substance. You can use red cabbage juice to make an indicator.
The color change of coconut juice depends on the acidity or alkalinity of the chemical substances.
The pH value indicates the amount of hydrogen (H) ions in the chemical substance being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton after losing an electron (because a hydrogen atom consists of one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders well, then use clean, damp hands to squeeze them into balls.
The moisture from both hands will react with the outer layer of the substance, resulting in a strange texture and forming a shell-like structure.
In the cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro, almost all houses had flush toilets connected to sophisticated sewage systems.
Remains of sewage treatment systems have been discovered in houses in the Minoan towns on the Greek islands of Crete and Santorini.
Toilets also existed in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes part of public baths, used by both men and women together.
When you call someone thousands of miles away, you are using a satellite.
Satellites in space will almost immediately reflect the call after receiving it.
Satellites are sent to space by rockets. Scientists use space telescopes because the Earth's atmosphere distorts some of our light and view.
A huge rocket needs to reach over 100 feet tall to send satellites or telescopes into space.
The wheel changed the world in an extraordinary way. The wheel's greatest contribution is that it gave us simpler and faster transportation.
It brought us trains, cars, and many other kinds of transportation.
Beneath them are medium-sized cats, and their medium-sized prey includes rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Finally, many small carnivores (including feral domestic cats) feed on a variety of small prey, such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success lies in proper division of labor. Each cat is assigned a specific task, which avoids competition among them.
Lions are the most social feline animals, living in groups called "prides."
A pride of lions consists of one to three related adult males, plus up to thirty females and cubs.
Female animals typically have close relationships with each other, forming a large family consisting of sisters and daughters.
The behavior of lion prides is similar to that of wolf packs or dog packs. Their behavior is surprisingly similar to that of lions (but different from other large cats), and they are all very deadly to prey.
Tigers are all-around athletes; they are capable of climbing (though not very good at it), swimming, long-distance jumping, and pulling with the strength of five strong humans.
Tigers and lions, leopards and jaguars all belong to the same genus (Panthera). Among feline animals, only these four types can roar.
The roar of a tiger differs from the loud roar of a lion, and is more like a growl with bared teeth.
Leopards enjoy eating small animals. They will try to catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds whenever possible. Almost all the animals that leopards hunt are much smaller than leopards themselves.
Scientists believe that ocelots use their sense of smell to determine the location on the ground where prey was, in order to find animals (prey) to eat.
They have very good night vision in the dark, and can move silently and without a trace. The leopard cat hunts by blending into its surroundings and then pouncing on its prey.
When a small group of organisms (a small population) separates from their parent population (for example, by crossing a mountain range or river, or migrating to a new island and being unable to easily return once they reach their destination), they often find themselves in an environment different from what they were previously in.
In the new environment, there are different resources and competitors, so this new group needs to develop different habits or adaptability to become stronger competitors than before.
The original tribes have not changed at all; they still need the same adaptability as before.
As time goes by, this new group begins to adapt to the new environment, and the differences between them and the other group become increasingly larger.
Finally, after undergoing millennia, even millions of years of evolution, these two groups of organisms will look completely different and can no longer be called the same species.
We refer to this process as speciation, which is the formation of new species. Speciation is an inevitable result of evolution and a very important part of it.
Plants release oxygen that humans need to breathe and absorb the carbon dioxide that humans exhale.
Plants obtain food from the sun through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We use plants to build houses and make clothes. Most of the food we eat comes from plants. Without plants, animals would not be able to survive.
The megalodon was the apex predator of its time, so they feared nothing besides other megalodons.
Its long jaw is full of over 70 knife-like sharp teeth, and it has extra teeth on its upper jaw, meaning nothing in its path can escape.
We are not sure, but it may have a bifurcated tongue. Its diet included sea turtles, large fish, other ichthyosaurs, and may have even eaten its own kind.
It also attacks everything in the water. Even a giant dinosaur like Tyrannosaurus Rex cannot match it.
Although their diet was largely similar to ours, the Romans also had their own peculiar tastes and unusual banquet foods, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a rodent called dormice.
Another difference is that the poor and women sit on the chairs to eat, while the wealthy people prefer to recline and dine together at banquets.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not have included ingredients that were only transported to Europe from the United States or Asia in later centuries.
For example: The ancient Romans did not have millet, tomatoes, potatoes, or cocoa beans, and they also never tasted turkey.
The Babylonians would build a primary temple for each deity, which was considered the home of the deity.
People offer sacrifices to deities, and priests attempt to satisfy the deities' needs through rituals and festivals.
Every temple has an open temple courtyard and an inner sanctuary that only priests are allowed to enter.
Sometimes, triangular pyramid-shaped towers called Jinzi Xing Shen Pagodas are built as part of temples.
The top of the pagoda is a special sanctuary for deities.
Due to the warm climate in the Middle East, houses become less important.
Most Jewish families conduct their daily lives outdoors.
Women cook in the backyard; shops are just open counters facing the street. Stones are used to build houses.
Due to the lack of large forests in Canaan's territory, timber is extremely expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. According to the Nordic sagas, Erik the Red, exiled from Iceland for murder, discovered the island while sailing westward and named it Greenland.
No matter what his discoveries were, the Eskimo tribe had already been living there at that time.
Although every country was once "Scandinavian," the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland still have many differences.
If you've seen the movie "National Treasure," you might think that the back of the Declaration of Independence has a treasure map drawn on it.
But the truth is not so. Although there are some things written on the back of the document, it is not a treasure map.
On the back of the Declaration of Independence, it reads "Original Declaration of Independence, July 4, 1776." This text is displayed upside down at the bottom of the document.
Although no one knows for sure who wrote it, it is clear that the large parchment document (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) was originally rolled up for storage.
Therefore, adding symbols is likely only for labeling purposes.
The Normandy landings and the subsequent battles liberated northern France, but southern France remained unliberated.
It was ruled by the French "Vichy" regime. This group of French people made peace with the Germans in 1940 and cooperated with the invaders instead of fighting against them.
On August 15, 1940, the Allied forces invaded southern France. This offensive was known as "Operation Dragon Rider."
The American and French Liberation Forces liberated southern France in just two weeks and then moved on to Germany.
Civilization refers to a single culture shared by a large group of people (i.e., society) who live and work together in cooperation.
The term "civilization" originates from the Latin word *civilis* (meaning civil/related to citizens). It is related to the Latin words *civis* (meaning citizen) and *civitas* (meaning city or city-state), and in a certain sense, it also defines the scale of society.
City-states were the precursors to nation-states. A civilization and culture signify the inheritance of knowledge across several generations, the continuation of cultural legacies, and a certain degree of dissemination.
The cultures of minority groups often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and are not recognized as true civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, thirteen colonies first formed a weak central government under the Articles of Confederation, with only the Continental Congress as its sole component.
Congress lacked the power to levy any taxes. Moreover, since the national administrative or judicial institutions did not exist at the time, Congress could only rely on state governments, which were often uncooperative, to enforce all laws.
The national assembly also has no power to overturn the tax laws and tariffs between individual states.
Regulations need the unanimous consent of all states to be amended, and these states do not attach importance to the central government, with state representatives often absent.
The Italian national football team and the German national football team are tied for second place in the world, and they are also the champions of the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
Popular sports include: football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, roller hockey, and Formula One racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, and the Italians in that region also participate in international competitions and Olympic events.
Japan has nearly 7,000 islands (the largest being Honshu), making it the 7th largest archipelago in the world!
Because Japan has a group of islands, it is often called a "group of islands" from a geographical perspective.
Taiwan's origins can be traced back to the 15th century, when European sailors who passed through recorded the island's name as Ilha Formosa, or Beautiful Island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southwestern Taiwan and began to reform the grain production methods of the indigenous people, employing Chinese laborers to work in their rice and sugar plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) military controlled the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and announced Taiwan as a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
After the Qing government's defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), it signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki. The treaty ceded its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, and Japan's rule over the island lasted until 1945.
Machu Picchu is composed of three main structures: Inti Watana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Temple of the Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the periphery of this architectural complex have been reconstructed, allowing tourists to better understand their original appearance.
By 1976, thirty percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration work continues to this day.
For example, 35mm is the most common still image format in the world, and it was the most widely used size when analog film photography ended.
Although production still continues to this day, what's more important is that the image sensor format of subsequent digital cameras also adopted its aspect ratio.
The name for the 35mm format is a bit ambiguous; it's actually 36mm wide and 24mm high.
This format's aspect ratio (simplified to a ratio of three to two by dividing by twelve to get the simplest integer proportion) can therefore be described as three to two.
Many common formats (such as the system format of advanced photography systems) also have the same or a different aspect ratio.
The trichotomous method, often misused and mocked, is a simple guideline that can maintain order within an image while also creating a vivid sense of life.
It points out that the most effective location of the subject is at the intersection of the dividing lines that divide the image into three horizontal parts (see example).
During this period of European history, the Catholic Church was subjected to strict scrutiny due to its increasing wealth and power.
For thousands of years, although language and customs still have certain differences, Christianity has nonetheless kept the countries of Europe closely connected.
The omnipresent power affects everyone, whether they are kings or commoners.
One of the main tenets of Christianity states that the purpose of wealth should be to alleviate suffering and poverty, and the church's funds exist for this reason.
The central authority of the Roman Catholic Church has a history of a thousand years. This concentrated power and wealth lead many people to question whether it aligns with the tenets of the faith.
As the war broke out, Britain initiated a naval blockade against Germany.
This strategy has proven effective in cutting off necessary military and civilian supplies, but this blockade violates international law formulated by numerous international agreements over the past two centuries.
The UK has deployed formations in international waters, preventing any ships from entering the entire ocean area, and posing a threat to neutral vessels as well.
Due to limited response to this strategy, Germany anticipates that its unrestricted submarine warfare will also receive a similar reaction.
In the 1920s, most citizens and the nation as a whole adhered to a policy of neutrality and isolationism.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities brought about by World War I, various countries hoped to avoid such situations from happening again in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States and started working at Edison's company located in New York City.
He came to the United States with four cents in savings, a book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his former manager) written to Thomas Edison.
In ancient China, there were unique ways to signify different periods; each stage of China or each ruling family was a distinct dynasty.
Between each dynasty, there were periods of instability with divided provinces. The most famous of these periods was the Three Kingdoms period of 60 years between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During these periods, fierce wars broke out among many nobles in the struggle for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with tens of thousands of people dying in the pursuit of the highest throne in the Great Imperial Palace of Xi'an.
Numerous social and political influences emerged in succession, such as the adoption of the metric system, the transition from authoritarianism to republicanism and nationalism, and the idea that the state belongs to the people rather than a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, all professions were opened to all men for application, allowing the most ambitious and successful individuals to inherit them.
The military also has a similar situation, because now military rank is no longer linked to social class, but determined based on ability.
The French Revolution simultaneously awakened the oppressed working class in many other countries, initiating their own revolutions.
Muhammad was deeply interested in things beyond worldly life. He often meditated in a cave named Hira on Mount Noor (meaning "light").
The cave was formed over time, giving Muhammad a distinct spiritual image.
Resting on the summit of one of the mountains in the north of Mecca, this cave is secluded from the world.
Actually, even if you know it exists, it's difficult to find. When you are in the cave, you are absolutely isolated from the world.
Here, you'll only see the clear, beautiful sky and the embracing mountains. Looking out from the cave, you see and hear only a small piece of the world.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one still standing of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World.
The Great Pyramid was built by the Egyptians in the 3rd century BC and is one of the many large pyramids used to commemorate deceased pharaohs.
Located in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, the Giza Plateau (also known as the "Giza Necropolis") contains several pyramids (the Great Pyramid being the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to commemorate Pharaoh Khufu, while many smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to commemorate his wives and family members.
The symbol for "上弓" (shàng gōng) looks like a V, and the symbol for "落弓" (luò gōng) looks like a staple or a square without a bottom.
The upward motion means you should start drawing the bow from the top, and the downward motion means you should start drawing the bow from the bow's grip (where you hold it with your hand).
Drawing the bow usually produces a softer sound, while releasing the bow produces a stronger and more solid sound.
Feel free to write your own markings, but remember that the printed musical markings all have musical reasons, so generally they should be respected.
The terrified King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie-Thérèse, 11, and Louis-Charles, 4), and the King's sister, Madame Elisabeth, were forced back to Paris by a group of market women on October 6, 1789, after fleeing from the Palace of Versailles.
They returned to Paris by carriage, surrounded by a crowd furiously shouting and threatening the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the king and queen to open the carriage windows.
A commoner suddenly waved the severed head of a royal guard, beheaded at Versailles Palace, in front of a terrified queen.
American imperialism conquered the Philippines, and the war expenses were ultimately borne by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the American colonial regime, using the name of the Philippine government to pay most of the expenses and bond interest through Wall Street banks.
Of course, the surplus profit generated by the long-exploited Filipinos will constitute the basic gains of American imperialism.
Before understanding the Knights Templar, we must first understand the timing that led to their establishment.
The time when this event occurred is often considered to be the High Middle Ages in European history, specifically the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000 - 1300).
Before the High Middle Ages was the Early Middle Ages, followed closely by the Late Middle Ages. The Late Middle Ages is generally considered to have ended around 1500 BC.
Technological determinism is a term encompassing various ongoing ideas, ranging from technology driving or technologically dictating, to, in a strict sense, the belief that human destiny is driven by deep logic related to scientific laws and their technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism share two common viewpoints: the trajectory of technological development largely transcends cultural or political influence, and technology exerts an inherent "influence" on society, rather than being constrained by it.
For example, some people might say that cars inevitably lead to the development of roads.
However, if there are only a few cars, a nationwide road network is not economically feasible, so new production methods will be developed to reduce the cost of owning a car.
The large number of car owners also leads to more road accidents, which in turn brings about the invention of new medical technologies to treat injured bodies.
Romanticism has a strong element of cultural determinism, originating from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Against the backdrop of Romanticism, geographical environment shaped individuals, and customs and cultures related to the geographical environment emerged over time. These customs and cultures were in harmony with the social positioning, surpassing any imposed laws.
Just as Paris is considered the fashion capital of the modern world, Constantinople was regarded as the fashion metropolis of Europe during the feudal period.
Since 400 AD, it was renowned as a center for luxury goods and continued until approximately 1100 AD.
In the 12th century, its status gradually declined, mainly because the Crusades brought back spoils such as silk and spices, which were more popular than the goods offered in the Byzantine market.
From this time forward, Constantinople's title as the fashion capital willingly yielded to Paris.
Gothic style reached its peak of popularity in the 10th to 11th centuries and the 14th century.
The design of the initial jumpsuit was deeply influenced by Eastern Byzantine culture.
However, due to the slow communication between the east and west, the popular styles in the west lagged behind the east by 25 to 30 years.
By the late Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own clothing styles. The most significant development at the time came from the Crusades, which led people to start using buttons to fasten clothes.
Sustainable agriculture advocates for producing only enough food to feed farmers and their families.
Sustainable agriculture is a simple and mostly organic system that uses locally preserved seeds from ecological areas and combines crop rotation or other relatively simple techniques to maximize yield.
Historically, most farmers engaged in sustainable agriculture, and this is still common in many developing countries today.
Subcultures bring together individuals with shared interests. They feel ignored by societal norms, and subcultures allow them to develop a sense of identity.
The uniqueness of subcultures can stem from the age, ethnicity, class, region, and/or gender of their members.
The unique characteristics of subculture can be determined by a combination of factors such as language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexual orientation, geography, or other elements.
Members of subcultures typically express their membership through unique and symbolic means, including clothing, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common ways to illustrate the importance of socialization is to cite the cases of a few unfortunate children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse during their upbringing, did not receive social guidance from adults.
These children are generally known as "feral children." Some feral children were once confined (usually by their parents), while others were abandoned because their parents refused to accept the children's severe intellectual or physical disabilities.
Wild children may have suffered severe abuse or trauma before being abandoned or running away from home.
Some people are said to have been raised by animals, while others survived alone in the wilderness.
When feral children are raised by non-human animals, their behavior (within the limitations of their physical bodies) is almost completely similar to that of the animals who raised them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
Project-based learning should make learning easier and more interesting, and scaffolding theory goes even further.
Scaffolding theory is not a learning method, but rather a support system that assists people experiencing new learning processes, such as using new computer software or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can be virtual, and it can also be real. In other words, a teacher can be a form of scaffolding, and a collection of thousands of small files in Microsoft Office can also be a form of scaffolding.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software, aiming to facilitate questioning, stimulate thinking, and explain procedures that students find difficult to handle on their own.
There are many reasons why children are arranged to be cared for by foster families, such as: neglect, abuse, and even extortion.
Children without parents should not grow up in an environment lacking care, love, and education, but these children are experiencing all of that.
We believe that the foster care system is a safe haven for these children.
Our foster care system will provide safe homes, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Care and foster care should provide everything they lacked in their previous home.
The internet combines elements of mass communication and interpersonal communication.
The obvious characteristic of the Internet has expanded the scope of usage and ways of meeting needs.
For example, "learning" and "socialization" are considered important motivations for using the internet (James et al., 1995).
Eighmey and McCord (1998) confirmed that the "relationship between personalization and persistence" is a new motivation when studying users' responses to websites.
The use of video recordings has led to significant discoveries in interpreting fleeting microexpressions and facial movements.
Especially, it is said that accurately interpreting micro-expressions can reveal whether a person is lying.
Oliver Sacks pointed out in his article "The President's Speech" that even people who are unable to understand the content of a speech due to brain damage can still accurately judge the speaker's sincerity.
He even suggested that domestic animals, such as dogs, may also possess the ability to interpret human behavior.
Research in the 20th century shows that genetic mutations are divided into two types: recessive and dominant.
Sudden mutations have increased new genetic variations and selectively removed dominant variations from the gene pool.
Separation and recombination occur in a cycle between two gene pools in each generation.
On the savanna, primates (with digestive systems similar to humans) struggle to obtain the necessary amino acids from available plant resources.
Furthermore, failure can lead to serious consequences: stunted growth, malnutrition, and even ultimately death.
The easiest plant-based protein source is from leafy greens or legumes, but these plants are difficult for us, as primates, to digest if they are not cooked.
On the contrary, animal-based foods (ants, termites, eggs) are not only easily digestible but also provide a large amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
After considering all of this, our ancestors solved the "protein problem" using similar methods to those employed by chimpanzees on today's savannas, which is not surprising.
Sleep fragmentation is the process of intentionally waking up during normal sleep and then falling back asleep within a short period (ten to sixty minutes).
Simply using a relatively quiet alarm clock that makes you aware without fully waking you up will make it easy to achieve.
If you can reset your alarm while sleeping, you can put it on the other side of the room, forcing yourself to get up to turn it off.
Other bio-rhythm-based choices include drinking a large amount of liquid (especially diuretic drinks like water or tea) before going to sleep, forcing you to get up to urinate.
A person's inner peace and the tension in their body and mind are inversely proportional.
The less nervous you are, the more positive your life force will be. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and contentment.
Everyone is capable of awakening. The only things hindering progress towards this goal are our own nervousness and negative emotions.
Tibetan Buddhism is based on the teachings of the Buddha, but it spread through the influence of Mahayana Buddhism and many techniques originating from Indian yoga.
Tibetan Buddhism is very simple in principle. It includes Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path to great love.
Kundalini yoga awakens the Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The center of meditation in Tibet is Benzhu Yoga. It purifies energy channels, opens up the chakras, and generates a state of awakened consciousness by visualizing various deities.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, promoting cooperation between the Soviet Union and the United States. However, after the war ended, conflicts between the two countries arose in terms of systems, processes, and culture, leading to discord.
Two years after the war ended, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War officially began.
It will continue for the next forty years, and proxy armies will wage real wars on battlefields from Africa to Asia, Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
By September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses had been broken, and the only hope was to retreat along the Romanian bridgehead and reorganize.
However, these plans became obsolete almost overnight when over 800,000 soldiers of the Soviet Red Army violated the Treaty of Riga, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Treaty, and other bilateral and multilateral international treaties by invading eastern Poland and advancing into and establishing a front line in Belarus and Ukraine.
Using ship transport is currently the most effective method for transporting large numbers of people and goods across oceans.
The navy's traditional responsibilities are to ensure your country has the ability to transport its citizens and goods, while also disrupting your enemy's ability to transport their citizens and goods.
One of the most notable modern examples is the Battle of the Atlantic during World War II. The United States attempted to cross the Atlantic to transport manpower and supplies to aid Britain.
At the same time, the German Navy mainly used U-boats to try to block supply lines.
If the Allied forces fail, Germany might be able to conquer Britain, just as it conquered other European countries before.
Goats are believed to have been first domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to domesticate them for the convenience of obtaining milk, fur, meat, and hides.
Domesticated goats are typically raised in herds and allowed to graze on mountains or other pastureland, cared for by shepherds who are usually children or adolescents, similar to the shepherds we are more familiar with. These grazing methods are still in use today.
England built roadways as early as the 16th century.
Although the carriage roads were made of only parallel wooden planks, compared to the slightly rougher roads of the time, they enabled horses to travel faster and to pull heavier loads.
Ballast was introduced in the very early days to fix the rails. However, people gradually discovered that adding a small amount of iron to the rail surface was more effective.
This has evolved into a common practice, but iron will cause greater wear on the wooden wheels of trucks.
Wooden wheels were eventually replaced by iron wheels. Full iron rails were first introduced in 1767.
It is known that the earliest means of transportation was walking. With the appearance of Homo erectus (referring to upright people), humans began to walk upright two million years ago.
Their ancestors, the Southern Apes, did not have the habit of walking upright.
Specialized bipedal forms have been found in南方古猿 (Australopithecus) fossils dating from 4.2 to 3.9 million years ago, but Sahelanthropus tchadensis may have already walked on two legs as early as 7 million years ago.
We can start living more environmentally friendly, we can participate in environmental protection movements, and even become active participants to reduce harm to the future to some extent.
This is just like prescribing medicine for the symptoms in many situations. However, if we don't just want to temporarily solve the problem, then we should find the root cause of the problem and prevent it from happening again at the root.
Obviously, with the rapid advancements in human science and technology, the world has been completely changed. Due to overpopulation and humanity's excessively extravagant lifestyle, the problems have become even more severe.
After the U.S. Congress passed the bill on July 4th, the handwritten draft, signed by House Speaker John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson, was subsequently sent to John Dunlap's printing house, a few blocks away.
They worked all night to produce 150 to 200 copies, now known as the "鄧拉普 single-sided printed version."
The document was first publicly read by John Nixon in front of the Independence Hall on July 8th.
A copy was mailed to George Washington on July 6th, and he read it aloud to his troops in New York on July 9th. A duplicate was mailed to London on August 10th.
The 25 surviving single-sided printed copies of Deng Lab's work are the oldest extant versions of the document. The original handwritten manuscript no longer exists.
Nowadays, many paleontologists believe that a group of dinosaurs has survived to this day. We call them birds.
Because they have feathers and can fly, many people don't think they are dinosaurs.
However, many things about birds still resemble dinosaurs.
They have scales and claws on their feet, lay eggs, and walk on their hind legs like a Tyrannosaurus Rex.
Modern computers almost all operate based on manipulating information, and the encoding of this information is in the form of binary digits.
Binary numbers can only exist in one of two values, namely 0 or 1. These numbers are called bits or digits in computer terminology.
Internal organ poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are very common and cannot lead to an immediate diagnosis.
The most obvious sign of poisoning internally may be the presence of opened drug containers or toxic household chemicals left at the scene.
Check the label of the specific poison for designated first aid instructions.
The term "insect" used by entomologists refers to this group of insects in a formal sense.
This vocabulary originates from the ancient familiarity with bedbugs, insects that are exceptionally well-adapted to parasitizing humans.
Assassin bugs and bed bugs are both nesting animals, accustomed to living in the nests or dwellings of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 known cases of multiple sclerosis (MS), making it the leading neurological disease among young and middle-aged adults.
Multiple sclerosis is a disease that affects the central nervous system (composed of the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves).
Research shows that women are twice as likely to develop multiple sclerosis as men.
A couple might think raising a baby doesn't align with their best interests, or doesn't align with the child's best interests.
These couples can choose to develop adoption plans for their children.
During the adoption process, the biological parents terminated their parental rights so that the other couple could become the child's parents.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. In fact, this method indeed guides most scientific research.
Conducting experiments is not the only method. An experiment is simply a test used to eliminate one or more feasible hypotheses, and raising questions and making observations can also lead scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, especially the Latin version of the Bible.
Aristotle's views on all scientific matters (including psychology) are widely recognized.
As Greek knowledge declined, the Western world detached itself from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Rhythms observed in many physiological and behavioral aspects typically depend mainly on the presence of endogenous cycles and their operation through the physiological clock.
The rhythmic cycle is not only a response to external periodic cues, but is also recorded in most organisms, including bacteria, fungi, plants, and animals.
The body's internal clock is self-sustaining and oscillates, continuing to run freely for a period of time even without external cues.
The experiments of Hersey and Chase are one of the important proposals, suggesting that DNA is the genetic material.
Héxi and Cai Si used bacteriophages or viruses to inject their DNA into bacteria.
They conducted two experiments: one labeled the DNA in bacteriophages with radioactive phosphorus, and the other labeled the proteins in bacteriophages with radioactive sulfur.
Depending on the type of mutation, the importance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cells are germline cells, a mutation can have a variety of different effects.
Only mutations in germline cells can be inherited by children, while other mutations may lead to cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism offers scenic views, including wildlife, and is very attractive to nature lovers.
The on-site activities include hunting, fishing, photography, bird watching, visiting the park, and researching information about the ecosystem.
One example is visiting, photographing, and getting to know the Orang Sungai (river people) of Borneo.
Every morning, people drive out of the small town to their workplaces, often passing by others who are heading to the same destination they just left.
In this dynamic transportation system, everyone connects to and supports the transportation system to some extent through private cars.
Modern science indicates that this large-scale carbon economy has pushed the biosphere away from one of its stable states, a state that has been the cornerstone of human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in social activities and uses the transportation system, and almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
You rarely hear complaints about water quality or collapsed bridges to the same extent in developed countries.
Why do the transportation systems lead to these complaints? Why are there breakdowns every day? Are transportation engineers this incompetent? Or is it because of some more fundamental problems?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and their interactions with each other.
Unfortunately, traffic flow research is not easy because we cannot predict driver behavior with 100% accuracy.
Fortunately, the driver's behavior tended to fall within a reasonable and stable range; therefore, the traffic flow tended to exhibit a certain degree of reasonable consistency and could be roughly expressed mathematically.
In order to better express traffic flow, the relationships between three main characteristics were established: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) rate.
These relationships aid in planning, designing, and operating road facilities.
Insects are the first animals to fly in the sky. Their flying ability helps them evade enemies more easily and also find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of folding their wings backward along their bodies.
This allows them to hide in more small places to avoid predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings backward are dragonflies and flies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the solar system revolves around the sun.
Some people think he is right, but many people believe the opposite: the solar system (including the sun and even other celestial bodies) revolves around the Earth.
It seems reasonable, after all, it doesn't feel like the Earth is moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second-longest and largest river in the world. Its river water is more than 8 times that of the second-largest river.
The Amazon is also the world's widest river, sometimes reaching six miles wide.
Of the water flowing from rivers to the ocean on Earth, a full 20 percent comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River's main channel is 6,387 kilometers (3,980 miles) long. It gathers the waters of thousands of smaller rivers.
Even though the construction of pyramids using stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the scale and superb construction techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The ancient Egyptians of the New Kingdom were astonished by monuments that commemorated a thousand years of history from the previous period.
The population of Vatican City is about 800 people. It is the world's smallest and least populous independent state.
The official language of law and official communication in the Vatican City is Italian.
Italian is also the everyday language used by most people working in that country, while Latin is more commonly used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens within the Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
Humans have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times, because they can all be discovered in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
The philosopher Aristotle proposed a theory that all things are composed of one or more combinations of four elements. Those four elements are earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like the four states of matter (arranged in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma. But his theory also points out that these elements can transform into new matter, forming what we see before us.
Alloys are basically mixtures composed of two or more metals. Don't forget that there are many more elements on the periodic table.
Calcium and potassium and other elements are also considered metals. Of course, there are other metals, such as silver and gold.
Some alloys also contain small amounts of non-metallic elements, such as carbon.
Everything in the universe is composed of matter. All matter is composed of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are very tiny, so tiny that the periods in this sentence can accommodate trillions of them.
Therefore, when pencils were first introduced, many people regarded them as good friends.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of new writing methods, the status and usage frequency of pencils have declined.
People now input messages on computer screens and no longer need pencils and sharpeners.
People can only be curious about what will happen to the keyboard when something new appears.
The operating principle of a fission bomb is that combining nuclei that contain many protons and neutrons requires energy.
It's a bit like pushing a heavy handcart uphill. Split the nucleus again and release some energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, which means that even with slight vibrations or no vibrations, they tend to split apart.
The surface of the Moon is composed of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The Earth's crust is about 70 kilometers thick on the front side and 100 kilometers thick on the back side.
The crust is thinner under the sea and thicker on land.
Due to the thinner crust, there may be more lunar mare on the front side, allowing lava to rise to the surface more easily.
The theory of content focuses on identifying the reasons why people do certain things or how to pique their interest.
These theories propose that as people grow into adulthood, certain needs and/or desires become internalized.
These theories explore what's behind certain people's desire to do certain things, and what factors in their environment lead them to do or not do certain things.
Two well-known content theories are Maslow's hierarchy of needs and Herzberg's two-factor theory.
Generally speaking, when a manager begins leading colleagues who were previously peers, two types of behaviors may emerge. One end of the spectrum is an attempt to maintain the status of "one of the team."
Managers of this type will have difficulties when making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, evaluating performance, assigning work responsibilities, and holding people accountable.
The other end of the spectrum is that the manager becomes a completely different person, believing that everything in the team must be changed and that they are solely responsible for it.
After all, a leader ultimately must be responsible for the success or failure of the team.
This kind of behavior can sometimes lead to disagreements between the leader and other members of the team.
Virtual teams need to adhere to the same excellent standards as traditional teams, but there are still slight differences between the two.
Virtual team members typically function as the point of contact for their direct physical teams.
Because their teams can meet across different time zones, and local management may not understand, they often have more autonomy than traditional team members.
The existence of the "invisible team" (Larson & Raffasto, 1989, p109) is also a unique component of virtual teams.
"Invisible teams" are management teams that each member reports to. Invisible teams set standards for each member.
Why would an organization be willing to invest time in becoming a learning organization? One goal of organizations that practice the concept of organizational learning is innovation.
Creativity and uniqueness will be further enhanced after all available resources are fully utilized by the functional departments within the organization.
Ultimately, the process of internal cooperation within the organization to overcome difficulties can bring about innovative processes to meet customer needs.
Before organizational renewal, leaders must establish a culture of innovation and promote knowledge sharing and organizational learning.
An Qi (2006) explained that the continuous method is a way to help organizations improve performance.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for the theoretical approaches in cognitive research. This narrows its scope of study and makes it more accurate.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior confirms the researchers' findings.
Long ago, people already knew that various types of brain injuries, trauma, damage, and tumors could all affect behavior and lead to changes in some psychological functions.
The rise of new technologies allows us to observe and study unprecedented brain structures and operational processes.
This provides a lot of information and materials, allowing us to build a simulation model to help us understand how the brain works.
Although artificial intelligence has a strong science fiction feel, it still constitutes a very important branch of computer science, focusing on the behavior, learning, and intelligent adaptability of machines.
Research on artificial intelligence involves automating tasks that require intelligent behavior from machines.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting recognition, voice, and facial recognition.
The aforementioned aspects have now become independent fields, focusing on providing solutions to problems encountered in real life.
Artificial intelligence systems are now commonly applied in economics, medicine, engineering, and military fields, and have already been established in software applications on some home computers and electronic games.
Field trips are an important part of all teaching. Teachers often hope to take students to places inaccessible by bus for on-site investigation.
Technology provides virtual field trip solutions. Students can sit comfortably in the classroom to visit museum artifacts, explore aquariums, or admire beautiful artwork.
Virtual field trips are also a good way to reflect on and share experiences regarding investigations in future teaching.
For example, students at Bennett School in North Carolina design a website each year about their trip to the state capital, which is updated annually, but older versions are also kept online as a keepsake.
Blogs can also improve students' writing skills. Students often have careless grammatical and spelling errors when they first start writing blogs, but the presence of readers usually can change this.
Because students are usually the pickiest audience, blog writers will start striving to improve their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, the blog "Enhancing Students' Understanding of the Surrounding Environment" satisfies readers' interests and inspires students to become smarter and more engaging (Toto, 2004).
Blogs are tools that inspire student collaboration and encourage students to extend their learning beyond traditional school days.
Appropriately using blogs can enhance students' analytical skills and critical thinking. By actively responding to online materials, students can define their own positions based on the context of others' articles and outline their views on specific issues (O'Reilly, 2002).
Ottawa is Canada's charming bilingual capital, featuring a series of art galleries and museums that showcase Canada's past and present.
Southward is Niagara Falls, while northward lies the undeveloped natural beauty of the Masgoqa River and other areas.
This all further highlights Ontario and is considered a typical Canadian provincial area by outsiders.
Most of the areas in the north are sparsely populated, with some even being uninhabited wilderness.
This is a surprising population comparison: the number of African Americans living in the United States is even greater than the number of citizens in Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest continent so far and is also a habitat for wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent nations or affiliated with France, and are also renowned as luxurious beach resort destinations.
Arabs also brought Islam to this land and carried out large-scale occupations in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence of Europe and colonialism originated in the 15th century when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the sea route from Europe to India via the Cape of Good Hope.
The northern area is surrounded by the Sahara Desert, while the southern and western areas are surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean.
Female: I suggest that any female traveler, regardless of marital status, should say she is married.
Bringing a ring with you can also help (just don't make it look too expensive).
Women should understand that certain cultural differences can lead to incidents being perceived as harassment, such as being followed or having your arm grabbed, which are quite common.
When rejecting a man, your attitude must be firm; don't be afraid to express your position (cultural differences are not an excuse!).
The modern city of Casablanca was established by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC and used as a strategic port by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids, known as Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it in the name of the Branca family, but abandoned it after the 1755 earthquake.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt this city as Dar-al-Bayda, and Spanish merchants established a trading post there, naming it Casablanca.
Casablanca is one of the most boring shopping places in all of Morocco.
It's easy to find places selling traditional Moroccan goods near Old Mac's, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets, but they are all aimed at tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It is located in the easternmost part, close to Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo. The volcanic lava buried most of the town's streets, especially the town center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, research should be conducted in any location outside of Goma to understand the ongoing conflict situation in North Kivu province.
This city also serves as a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo, and offers Africa's most affordable mountain gorilla trekking service.
You can take a Boda motorcycle taxi to tour Goma. The normal (local) price for short distances is about 500 Congolese francs.
Adding to its relatively difficult accessibility, "Timbuktu" became a metaphor for a faraway, exotic locale.
Today, Timbuktu is a poor town, but its historical fame makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, due to desert sandstorms, this place was listed as a World Heritage Site in danger.
Henry Louis Gates Jr.'s American public broadcaster (PBS) special "Africa Worlds Wonders" features this place as one of its major stops.
This city stands in stark contrast to other cities in the country, as it has a more Arab flavor compared to cities in Africa.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa, bordering Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the Crocodile River to the south.
The park covers an area of 19,500 square kilometers and is divided into fourteen different ecological zones, each providing habitat for different wildlife.
It is one of the main attractions in South Africa and is considered a flagship park within South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African national parks, there are daily conservation fees and park entrance fees.
If you buy a Wild Card, there are also benefits; it allows you to enter designated South African parks or all South African national parks.
Hong Kong Island is the representative of Hong Kong and also a popular destination for many tourists.
The numerous skyscrapers that compose Hong Kong's skyline are like a glittering bar graph, appearing particularly dazzling against the reflection of Victoria Harbour's waters.
If you want to enjoy the most beautiful scenery of Hong Kong, leave Hong Kong Island and head to Kowloon's waterfront on the other side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is concentrated on the reclaimed land on the north side.
This place was once occupied by the British colonizers and is a good starting point for finding evidence of the colonial history on this land.
Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, extending 80 kilometers (50 miles) along the coast into the inland areas of Bangladesh and India.
Sundarbans has been declared a World Heritage site by UNESCO. The forest located in India is known as Sundarbans National Park.
However, the forest here is not just mangrove swamps; it also includes the last remaining area of the vast forest that once covered the Ganges Plain.
The area of Sudabang is 3,850 square kilometers, of which about one-third is water/swamp area.
Since 1966, Sudabang has been a wildlife reserve. It is estimated that there are now 400 Royal Bengal tigers and about 30,000 Sambar deer in the area.
Buses run all day from the district bus stops (across the river), but most operate between 6:30 and 7:30 AM (especially those heading east and towards Jiaka/Bumtang).
Due to the frequent full buses between districts, it is recommended to purchase your tickets in advance a few days.
Most areas have small Japanese Coaster buses for shuttle service, comfortable and stable.
Riding a shared taxi is a fast and comfortable way to get to nearby locations, such as Paro (150 Nu) and Punakha (200 Nu).
The Aukapawk River Bridge is a cable-stayed bridge that spans the Aukapawk River to connect Aukapawk City in Brazil and Saint-Georges-de-l'Oyapock City in French Guiana.
The twin towers are 83 meters high, the bridge is 378 meters long, and has two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical space under the bridge is 15 meters high. It was completed in August 2011 and opened to traffic in March 2017.
The Great Bridge is scheduled to be fully operational when the Brazilian customs inspection station is completed, expected in September 2017.
The Guarani people reside in eastern Paraguay today and are the largest indigenous group in the region. They live a semi-nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle and also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is the homeland of other indigenous tribes, such as the Guaycuru and Payagua. They make a living by hunting, gathering food, and fishing.
Paraguay was born in the 16th century from the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and local indigenous people, originally known as the "Province of the Indian Giants."
The Spanish began a colonial period lasting three centuries.
Since the founding of Asunción in 1537, Paraguay has successfully preserved many of its indigenous characteristics and identity.
Argentina is famous for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The grandest polo tournament of the year will be held in Las Canitas' polo grounds in December.
The remaining time of the year can also be spent watching smaller championship tournaments and competitions.
Regarding competition news and the location to purchase tickets for polo matches, please refer to the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Currency can only be exchanged at the only bank on the islands, which is located across from the Stanley FIC West store.
Pounds sterling can be used anywhere on the island, and in Stanley, credit cards and US dollars are usually accepted.
Credit cards are usually not accepted on outlying islands, but they may accept British and American currency; it's best to confirm accepted payment methods with the shop owner beforehand.
It's almost impossible to exchange Falkland Islands currency outside of the island, so you should exchange your money before you leave.
Since Montevideo is located south of the Equator, it is summer there when the Northern Hemisphere is in winter, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; in the summer months, temperatures exceeding 30 degrees Celsius are very common.
In winter, it might be mistakenly thought to be very cold: the temperature rarely drops below freezing, but with the wind and humidity, it feels colder than the thermometer shows.
There isn't a distinct "rainy season" and "dry season" there: the annual rainfall is roughly the same year-round.
Although the animals in the park are used to seeing humans, these wild animals still retain their wildness, and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to the park's regulations, you must maintain a distance of at least 100 yards/meters from bears and wolves, and at least 25 yards/meters from other wildlife!
No matter how docile they may appear, wild bulls, elk, bears, and almost all large animals may attack humans.
Every year, dozens of tourists are injured for not maintaining a proper distance from the animals. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so please keep your distance from them.
Furthermore, please note that strong smells can attract bears and other wildlife, so please avoid bringing or cooking food with strong odors and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The town is located on Upolu Island and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was founded in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
This port was the site of a notorious naval standoff in 1889, when seven warships from Germany, the United States, and Great Britain all refused to leave.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans perished.
In the struggle for independence during the Mau Movement, a peaceful gathering in the town led to the death of the supreme leader Tupua Tamasese Laloifi III.
Because Auckland spans two harbors, there are many beaches in this area. The most popular beaches are all located in three regions.
North Shore Beach (Beigang District) is located on the Pacific Ocean, extending from the northern Changwan to the southern Devonport.
Here, almost all the beaches are suitable for swimming, and most of them are planted with New Zealand Christmas trees to provide shade.
Tamariki Beach is located in the Waitematā Harbour, in the upscale suburbs of Mission Bay and St Heliers in the centre of Auckland.
This place is very popular with families, and can get crowded at times. There are many shops along the shore. Swimming is safe.
The main local beer is "Yi Hao". It's not a complex beer, but it feels pleasant and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta".
You can buy a lot of French wine here, but the wine from New Zealand and Australia might be shipped better.
The local tap water is very safe and can be drunk. However, if you're afraid, it's also easy to find bottled water.
For Australians, "white" coffee is a foreign concept. Short black coffee is "espresso," foam coffee has lots of whipped cream (not milk foam), and tea is without milk.
Hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. Although the juice is expensive, the quality is excellent.
Many people visit the coral reefs for tourism throughout the year. And on the coral reefs, injuries due to any of the aforementioned reasons are very rare.
Despite this, you should still follow the authorities' advice, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear on beaches and near estuaries from October to April of 1770. Outside of this period, they can occasionally be found.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away on their own.
Saltwater crocodiles do not primarily live in the ocean. Their main habitat is in the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance allows travelers to have accommodation upon arrival at their destination, which feels reassuring.
Travel agencies often have partnerships with specific hotels, but you can also book other types of accommodation like campsites through them.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, round-trip airport transportation, and even combination deals for flights and hotels.
If you need time to consider the quote or obtain other documents for your destination (such as a visa), they can hold your booking for you.
Any modifications or requests should first go through the travel agency, not directly with the hotel.
At many music festivals, most attendees choose to camp on-site, and they all consider this an essential part of the music festival experience.
If you want to get close to the event location, you should arrive earlier and find a campsite near the music.
Remember, even though the music on the main stage might have ended, some parts of the music festival might still play music until late at night.
Some music festivals set up special camping areas for families with children.
If you are traveling through the northern Baltic Sea in winter, check the cabin location, because the cabins most affected by crossing the ice may have very frightening noise.
The St. Petersburg cruise includes time spent in the city. Cruise passengers are exempt from visa requirements (see terms and conditions for details).
Casinos typically do everything they can to keep customers spending as much time and money as possible. There are usually no windows or clocks, and exits are difficult to find.
They usually have special food, drinks, and entertainment arrangements to keep guests in a good mood and stay at the casino.
Some venues offer free alcoholic beverages. However, getting drunk impairs judgment, and all good gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone driving at high altitudes or crossing mountain passes should consider the possibility of snow, ice, and cold temperatures.
On roads with ice and snow, the friction is lower, so you cannot drive in the same way as on ordinary asphalt roads.
In a blizzard, snowfall in a very short period of time can be enough to trap you.
Visibility may be restricted due to snowfall, blowing snow, condensation, or ice formation on car windows.
On the other hand, frost and snow are common in many countries, and transportation is rarely disrupted throughout the year.
Hunting trips might be the most attractive tourism activity in Africa and are also a highly anticipated itinerary for many travelers.
The term "safari" generally refers to a journey taken by land to view impressive African wildlife, especially on the savanna.
Some animals (such as elephants and giraffes) like to get close to cars, and with standard equipment you can see them clearly.
Sometimes lions, leopards, and cheetahs can be quite shy, and it's easier to spot them with binoculars.
Hiking and hunting trips (also known as "jungle trekking," "hunting treks," or "walking") involve hikes that can last for several hours or even days.
The 2021 Paralympic Games will be held from August 24th to September 5th. Some events will be held in other areas within Japan.
Tokyo is the only Asian city to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, the last time being in 1964.
If you have already booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the announcement of the delay, you may find yourself in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but as of the end of March, most COVID-related cancellation policies do not include July 2020 (i.e., the originally scheduled time for the Olympics).
The expected price of most event tickets ranges from 2,500 yen to 130,000 yen, with a typical price of around 7,000 yen.
Dampening clothes before ironing can help them dry faster. Many hotels, even if they don't have one in the room, will lend you an iron and ironing board.
If you don't have an iron, or you don't like wearing ironed socks, then if you have a hairdryer, you can try using it.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (this will cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, burning).
There are many different water purification methods on the market, and some of them can effectively combat specific threats.
In some places, boiling water for one minute is sufficient, while in other places it requires several minutes.
The effectiveness of filters varies. If you are concerned, you might consider purchasing sealed bottled water produced by reputable companies.
Travelers may encounter animals and pests not commonly seen in their hometowns.
Pests can spoil food, cause irritation, or, in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread venom, or transmit infections.

The road section between Marin Point and Fairmont on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh Highway presents the most challenging driving environment, often traversing remote and isolated terrain.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, please stay alert: This area mainly consists of steep slopes, narrow lanes, and sharp turns.
The speed limit is noticeably lower than in previous and subsequent sections of the road, typically 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h), and strictly adhering to the speed limit is more important than anything else.
Oddly enough, the mobile phone signal here is much stronger than in many other sections along the way, such as in the Pennsylvania wilderness.
German pastries are very delicious, and those of Bavaria are similar to those in the southern neighboring country of Austria, with a very rich and diverse selection.

However, without further modifiers, this word tends to be interpreted as food originating from central and eastern Java Island.
Currently, Javanese cuisine is ubiquitous throughout the islands, featuring a range of simple dishes. The main seasonings favored by Javanese people are peanuts, chili peppers, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
Horse stirrups are foot supports hanging on both sides of the saddle for riders.
They offer riders greater stability, but there is also a safety risk due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught inside.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but one leg gets caught in the stirrup while the horse runs away, they may be dragged. To minimize this risk, some safety precautions can be taken.
First, most riders wear riding boots with heels and smooth, relatively narrow soles.
Secondly, some saddles (especially English saddles) are equipped with safety straps that allow the rider to pull backward upon falling, causing the stirrup leather to detach from the saddle.
Chile's top climbing destination—the Cocharro Valley, also known as the Yosemite Valley of South America—boasts diverse, massive granite walls and cliffs.
The scenery of the mountain peaks is breathtaking. Climbers from all over the world are continuously exploring new routes along the valley's towering cliffs.
Downhill skiing (including alpine skiing and snowboarding) is very popular, where you attach skis or a snowboard to your feet and glide down snow-covered slopes.
Skiing is a major tourist activity, and there are many enthusiasts (sometimes also called "skiing maniacs") who plan their entire vacation around skiing at specific locations.
The concept of skiing is very ancient—cave paintings depicting skiers can be traced back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing, as a sport, can be traced back to at least the 17th century. In 1861, Norwegians established the first leisure ski club in Australia.
Skiing backpack travel: This activity is also known as backcountry skiing, ski touring, or ski hiking.
Although related to alpine skiing tourism or mountaineering, most do not involve it. The latter is done on steep slopes and requires stiffer skis and boots.
Imagine the ski route as something similar to a hiking trail.
Under favorable conditions, your cross-country skiing range can be greater than the distance you can walk. However, in rare cases, you can have the speed of cross-country skiing without needing to carry a heavy backpack and gliding on well-groomed trails.
Europe is a continent with a relatively small area, but it has many independent countries. Generally speaking, traveling to multiple countries means applying for visas multiple times and going through passport checks multiple times.
However, the way the Divine Root region operates in this regard is like a country.
As long as you stay within the Shengen area, you usually don't need to go through passport checkpoints when crossing borders.
Similarly, as long as you possess a Divine Root Visa, you won't need to apply for visas from each Divine Root member state individually, thus saving time, money, and eliminating paperwork.
There is no unified definition of which manufactured items qualify as antiques. Some tax authorities define items with a history of over a hundred years as antiques.

Handicrafts may be defined as antiques, even though they are younger than mass-produced products of the same kind.
Reindeer herding is an important livelihood for the Sami people, and the cultural importance of reindeer trade is also significant for many other professions.
Traditionally, not all Sámi people participated in large-scale reindeer herding; instead, they sustained themselves through fishing, hunting, and similar activities, with reindeer primarily serving as draft animals.
Today, many Sámi people are engaged in modern trade. Tourism is a significant source of income for the Sámi region of Sápmi.

Books and magazines about wilderness survival are very common, but those mentioning war zones are few and far between.
Travelers planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they bring valid documents required for their return.
Governments in various countries have different willingness regarding passports or documents updating to reflect required names and genders when the gender (X) is not specified.
Foreign governments' willingness to fulfill these documents also differs greatly.
After September 11, 2001, security checks became even more intrusive.
Transgender individuals before surgery should not expect to maintain their privacy and dignity while going through the scanner.
Rip currents are the return flow of waves impacting the beach, typically appearing near reefs or similar locations.
Due to the concentration of underwater topographic reflux in deeper areas, rapid currents flowing into deep water originate from these locations.
The majority of drowning cases are caused by exhaustion from attempting to swim against the current, a maneuver that is unlikely to succeed.
Once you break free from the trend, swimming back will be as simple as usual.
When you are still not being found, try aiming for other places, but this also depends on your ability and whether you have already been noticed, because you might want to wait for rescue.
The impact of returning to the workplace is faster than cultural shock (the honeymoon period is shorter), and it may also last longer and be more severe.

After living abroad and returning to your home country, you've already adapted to a new culture and lost some of the habits you had in your own culture.
When you first go abroad, people might show patience and understanding. Because they know that travelers need time to adapt to a new country.
People may not think that patience and understanding are also necessary for travelers returning home.

The lion-headed human-faced statue is set as the background and narrator of a long story.
Different pyramids light up on the display scene in the pyramid.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are currently claimed by several countries as their sovereign territory. There were 16 operational bases on the islands in 2020, making it the most heavily fortified territory.
The archipelago is located 120 kilometers north of the peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, and it is the location of Raspberry Island (Las Estrellas).
Other islands include Livingston Island and Deception Island, where an active volcanic crater is flooded, forming a spectacular natural harbor.
The Elsworth Peninsula is a region south of the peninsula and is surrounded by the Bering-Kozhakhin Sea.
The mountain ranges of the peninsula merge into the plateau, and then the 360-kilometer-long Ellsworth Mountains emerge, being bisected by glaciers from Minnesota.
In the north or Sentinel Range lies Antarctica's highest mountain range, known as Vinson Massif, with its peak at 4892 meters on Mount Vinson.
In remote areas without mobile phone coverage, satellite phones may be your only option.

Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information about connecting to this service.
For those planning a sabbatical, travel and study are becoming increasingly popular choices.
This is particularly popular among high school graduates, allowing them to take a gap year before starting university without affecting their education.

Generally speaking, attending these educational courses requires paying tuition fees.
Finland is very suitable for boating. This "Land of a Thousand Lakes" also has thousands of islands in its lakes and coastal archipelago.
Yachts are not a necessity for circumnavigating islands and lakes.
Although the coastal islands and the largest lakes are all sufficient to accommodate any yacht, small boats and even rowing offer a different experience.
Boating is a very common pastime for Finns; there's a boat for every seven or eight people.
Similar situations exist in Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but Finland is particularly unique compared to other countries (for example, in the Netherlands, this number is one in forty).
Most of the unique Baltic cruises spend a relatively long time in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can have a full two days to visit this historic city, and then return to the ship to sleep in the evening.
As of 2009, if you are only traveling by boat to come ashore, you will not need a visa.
Some cruise itineraries feature Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As can be seen from the map above, Berlin is not located near the sea, and tours of the city are not included in the cruise fare.

If they use airplanes to transport goods, it might take several days to unload and clear customs on certain routes.
The fastest way is to ship it as checked baggage. Airlines are not allowed to transport luggage without a passenger, and that's where you come in.
The most obvious way to ride first class or business class is to spend a lot of money to enjoy this privilege (a better way is to have your company do it for you).
However, this isn't cheap: based on rough experience, you can expect business class tickets to be about four times the price of economy class, and first class tickets to be 11 times the price!
Generally speaking, it's pointless to look for deals on business class or first-class seats for direct flights from A to B.
Since airlines are well aware that some business travelers are willing to pay a premium for the privilege of arriving at a destination quickly and comfortably, they accordingly charge higher fees.
Chisinau is the capital of Moldova. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is also widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflicts.

Because light pollution wasn't as severe during their flourishing period as it is now, they are typically located in cities or school campuses and are easier to access than modernly built observatories.
Most modern research telescopes are huge facilities located in remote areas with favorable atmospheric conditions.
Cherry blossom viewing, also known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
This concept comes from China. There, people choose to appreciate plum blossoms.
