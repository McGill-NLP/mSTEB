It is difficult to provide a definitive translation without more context and knowledge of the specific dialect of Mossi being used. However, here's a possible translation, keeping in mind the potential ambiguity: "The problem is that Maslow is not Hertzberg." **Explanation of possible interpretations:** * **Magb ramba bé a yiibou:** This is the most difficult part. "Magb" could be a prefix indicating a problem or issue. "Ramba" might relate to a situation or state. "Bé" could be a marker of emphasis or negation. "A yiibou" is likely a reference to a person or concept. Putting it together, it suggests a problem *is* that something related to "yiibou" is not functioning correctly, or is in a problematic state. * **A Maslow ningin la Hertzberg:** This translates to "Maslow is not Hertzberg." This likely refers to the psychological theories of Abraham Maslow and Frederick Herzberg. The sentence emphasizes that they are distinct figures and their theories are different.
