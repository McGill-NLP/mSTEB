Although there is one experimental vaccine that appears to reduce Ebola-related deaths, there is currently no clearly proven treatment for existing infections.
ZMapp, one of the antibody cocktail initially used in the field, sparked hope, but several formal studies indicate that its benefits in preventing death are less than initially anticipated.
In the PALM trial, ZMapp served as a control, meaning scientists used it as a baseline and compared three other treatments to it.
USA Gymnastics supports a letter from the United States Olympic Committee and recognizes the absolute necessity of the Olympic family's needs in promoting a safe environment for all of our athletes.
We agree with the USOC's statement that, for the benefit of our athletes and clubs, as well as their sport, it is better to make significant changes within our organization going forward, rather than cancel certifications.

This not only confirms that at least some dinosaurs had feathers, a widely held theory, but it can also provide details that are typically not available from fossils, such as color and three-dimensional structure.
Scientists say the fur of this animal is brown like chestnut on top with a pale or carotenoid-colored underside.
This discovery also provides insights into the evolution of feathers in birds.
Because dinosaur feathers lacked a well-developed shaft, called the rachis, but possessed other features—spines and barbules—researchers concluded that the rachis may have evolved later than these other characteristics.
The feather structure indicates that the feathers were not used for flying, but rather for temperature regulation or display. Researchers argue that, although this is a dinosaur tail, the sample shows feathers of an adult bird, not of a chick.

The work done is mostly theoretical, but this program was written to simulate observations made of the Sagittarius galaxy.
The effect sought by the team will be caused by the tidal forces between the dark matter of the galaxy and the dark matter of the Milky Way.
Just as the ebb and flow occurs due to the moon pulling the Earth, the Milky Way gives Sagittarius a gravitational influence.
Scientists can conclude that dark matter interacts with other dark matter in the same way that ordinary matter does.
This theory suggests that most dark matter around galaxies is located within the galaxies in the form of a halo, and is made up of many small particles.

Dr. Tony Moll discovered Extensively Drug-Resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB) in the KwaZulu-Natal region of South Africa.
In an interview, he said the new variant is "very concerning and alarming due to its very high mortality rate."

In France, voting has traditionally been an old-fashioned experience: voters lock themselves in booths, place a pre-printed ballot indicating their chosen candidate into an envelope, and deposit it.
After the officials verified the voters' identities, the voters inserted the envelopes into the ballot box and signed the poll.
The French election law regulates the process quite strictly.
Since 1988, ballot boxes have had to be transparent so that voters and supervisors can witness that there are no pre-filled envelopes at the start of voting and no envelopes are added, except for envelopes that should rightfully be counted and belong to registered voters.
Candidates may send representatives to witness each part of the process. In the evening, votes are counted by volunteers under strict supervision, following specific procedures.

Police supervisor Chandra Shekhar Solanki said the suspect appeared in court with a face covered.
Even though three people were in the house when a car hit it, none of them were injured.
However, the driver sustained a serious head injury.
The road where the accident occurred is temporarily closed, and emergency services are removing the driver from the red Audi TT.
He was initially treated at James Paget Hospital in Great Yarmouth.
He was then transferred to Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge.
Since then, Adekoya was accused at Edinburgh Sheriff Court of murdering his own child.
He/She is being held pending indictment and trial, but any eyewitness testimony may be tainted because his/her photo has been widely published.
This is common practice elsewhere in England, but the Scottish justice system works differently and the courts view the publication of photos as potentially prejudicial.
Professor Pamela Ferguson of the University of Dundee notes that journalists appear to be walking a dangerous path if they publish photos of suspects, etc.
The Crown Prosecution Service, which is overall responsible for prosecutions, has indicated to reporters that no further comment will be made at least until the charges are brought.
The document, according to that leak, will refer to the border dispute, which Palestine desires based on the borders before the 1967 Middle East War.
Another reported topic is the future of Jerusalem, holy to both countries, and the issue of the Jordan Valley.
Israel demands a continuous military presence in the valley for a period of ten years once an agreement is signed, whereas the Palestinian Authority agrees to a military presence for only a period of five years.
The shooter in the additional pest control trial must be closely supervised by guards because the trial is monitored and its effectiveness is evaluated.
In a partnership between NPWS and the Sporting Shooters Association of Australia (NSW) Inc., qualified volunteers are recruited through the Sporting Shooters Association hunting program.
According to Mick O'Flynn, the Director of Conservation and Heritage at NPWS, the four shooters selected for the initial shooting operation have received comprehensive training and safety instructions.
Martelly swore in the new Temporary Electoral Commission (CEP) yesterday, which consists of nine members.
This is Martelly's fifth CEP in four years.
Last month, a presidential commission issued a recommendation for the previous CEO's resignation as part of a settlement package to propel the country towards new elections.
The examination was Martelly's response to widespread anti-regime protests that began in October.
Protests that sometimes turn violent were triggered by the cancellation of elections that were supposed to be held since 2011.
Reportedly, 60 iPod malfunctions were reported, marked by overheating devices, causing six fires and four minor burn injuries.
Japan's Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) says they have learned of 27 accidents related to the device.
Last week, METI announced that Apple had informed them of 34 additional overheating incidents, which the company described as "not serious."
The ministry responded by stating that the delay in Apple's report is "very regrettable."
An earthquake struck the Mariana Islands at 07:19 local time (21:19 GMT Friday).
The Marianas Trench emergency management office said there were no reported damages in the country.
The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center also said there was no indication of a tsunami.
A former Filipino police officer kidnapped a Hong Kong tourist by hijacking a bus in Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
Rolando Mendoza fired his M16 at the tourists.
Several hostages have been rescued, and at least six have been confirmed dead so far.
Six hostages, including children and the elderly, have been released early, as have the Filipino photographers.
The photographers then replaced an elderly woman who wanted to use the restroom. Mendoza was also shot.
Liggins followed in his father's footsteps and entered a career in the medical field.
She was trained as an obstetrician and began working at Auckland Women's Hospital in 1959.
While working at the hospital, Liggins began to investigate premature births in his spare time.
His/Her research shows that when given fetal lung hormones, the lungs will mature faster.
Xinhua reported that government investigators found two flight recorders, also known as "black boxes," on Wednesday.
Fellow wrestlers also paid their respects to Luna.
Tommy Dreamer said, "Luna was the first Extreme Queen. My first manager. Luna passed away at two months along. Unique like her. A strong woman."
Dustin "Goldust" Runnels commented, "Luna was as scary as me... maybe even scarier... I loved her and will miss her... I hope she is now in a better place."
Of the 1,400 people surveyed before the 2010 federal election, those who opposed Australia becoming a republic grew by 8 percent since 2008.
Acting Prime Minister Julia Gillard claimed during the 2010 federal election campaign that she was convinced Australia should become a republic by the end of Queen Elizabeth II's reign.
In a poll regarding this view, 34 percent of those surveyed wished for Queen Elizabeth II to be the last monarch of Australia.
In an extreme poll, 29 percent of those surveyed believe that Australia should become a republic as soon as possible, while 31 percent believe that Australia should not become a republic.
The Olympic gold medalist is scheduled to swim the 100m and 200m freestyle and in three relays at the Commonwealth Games, but due to his complaints, his fitness status is in doubt.
He couldn't take the medication he needed to relieve his pain because the drug is banned by the Olympic Games.
Curtis Cooper, a mathematician and computer science professor at the University of Central Missouri, discovered the largest known prime number as of January 25th.
Some people verified the discovery using various hardware and software in early February, and this was announced on Tuesday.
It is possible that comets are a source of water delivery to Earth along with organic material that can form proteins and support life.
Scientists hope to understand how planets are formed, particularly how Earth was formed, since a comet collided with Earth in the past.
Cuomo, 53, began his term earlier this year and last month signed a bill legalizing same-sex marriage.
He called those rumors "political gossip and nonsense."
He speculated about running for president in 2016.
NextGen is a system claimed by the FAA to allow aircraft to fly on shorter routes, saving millions of gallons of fuel each year, and reducing carbon emissions.
This device utilizes satellite-based technology, instead of outdated ground-based radar technology, to help air traffic controllers pinpoint the exact location of aircraft with greater precision and provide pilots with more accurate information.
Additional transportation will not operate, and diesel trains will not stop at Wembley. Parking facilities, drop-offs, and car parking are not available at the stadium.
Concerns about a lack of transportation increase the likelihood that the match will have to be played behind closed doors without fans.
A study published in a scientific journal on Thursday reported the formation of a new species of bird in the Galapagos Islands, Ecuador.
Researchers from Princeton University in the United States and Uppsala University in Sweden report that a new species evolved in just two generations. Previously, this process was believed to take much longer. This was due to the breeding of Darwin's endemic finch, *Geospiza fortes*, and the immigrant cactus finch, *Geospiza conirostris*.
Gold can be processed into various forms. Among other things, it is rolled into small shapes.
Gold can be drawn into thin wires, so it can be twisted and woven. It can be forged or rolled into sheets.
Gold can be made very thin and hammered onto other metals. It can also be made extremely thin, sometimes used as a decoration for handwritten book illustrations called "illuminated manuscripts."
This is called chemical pH. You can make an indicator by using red cabbage juice.
Cabbage juice changes color depending on the acidity or alkalinity of its chemical components.
The pH level is indicated by the amount of hydrogen ions (H+ in pH) in the chemical being tested.
A hydrogen ion is a proton that has lost its electron (because a hydrogen atom has one proton and one electron).
Mix the two dry powders together, then roll them into balls with clean, wet hands.
The moisture on your hands will react with the outer layer, which will feel odd and form a sort of shell.
The cities of Harappa and Mohenjo-daro had flush toilets in almost every house, connected to a sophisticated sewage system.
Remains of the drainage system have been found in many houses in Minoan cities in Crete and Santorini in Greece.
There were also toilets in ancient Egypt, Persia, and China. In the Roman civilization, toilets were sometimes integrated with public bathhouses, where men and women used them together.
When you call someone who is thousands of miles away, you use a satellite.
Satellites in space receive a call and then reflect it back, almost instantaneously.
The satellite was sent into space by a rocket. Scientists use telescopes in space because the Earth's atmosphere changes some of the light and our view.
A giant rocket, over 100 feet tall, is needed to place satellites or telescopes in space.
The wheel has changed the world in an extraordinary way. The greatest thing the wheel has done for us is provide us with easier and faster transportation.
This leads us to trains, cars, and many other modes of transportation.
The medium-sized cat underneath preys on medium-sized animals, such as rabbits, antelopes, and deer.
Lastly, there are many small cats (including stray pets) that consume far more small prey such as insects, rodents, lizards, and birds.
The secret to their success is the niche concept, a specialized job undertaken by each cat to prevent them from competing with other cats.
Lions are the most social cats, living in large groups called prides.
Prides consist of one to three adult male siblings, along with 30 females and their offspring.
Females usually have a close bond with each other, like a large family of sisters and daughters.
Lion prides behave like wolf or dog packs, animals that are surprisingly similar to lions (but not other big cats) in their behavior, and are also very deadly to their prey.
As a versatile athlete, a tiger can climb (although not very skillfully), swim, jump long distances, and pull five times stronger than a human.
Tigers are still in the same group (Genus Panthera) as lions, leopards, and jaguars. These four cats are species that can roar.
The roar of a tiger is not like the roar of a lion, which is full of sound, but more like a sentence spoken with growls and shouts.
Ocelots like to eat small animals. Ocelots will catch monkeys, snakes, rodents, and birds if they can. Almost all the animals that ocelots hunt are much smaller than them.
Scientists believe that ocelots follow and search for animals to eat (prey) using their sense of smell, sniffing out prey tracks in the ground.
They can see clearly in the dark with night vision, and also move very silently. Ocelots hunt their prey by blending in with their surroundings, then ambushing them.
When a small group of living creatures (a small population) becomes separated from their original main population (such as if they migrate to the mountains or river, or if they migrate to a new island so they cannot easily return), they will often encounter an environment different from the one they previously inhabited.
This new environment has different resources and competitors, so the new population needs different features or adaptations to become a stronger competitor than they did before.
Their original population hasn't changed at all; they still need the same adaptations as before.
Over time, as the new population begins to adapt to its new environment, it appears to be dwindling like other populations.
Eventually, after thousands or even millions of years, the two populations will appear so different that they can no longer be called the same species.
We call this process speciation, which means the formation of new species. Speciation is an unavoidable consequence and a very important part of evolution.
Plants produce oxygen that humans breathe, and they inhale carbon dioxide that humans exhale (which means breathing).
Plants make their own food from sunlight through photosynthesis. They also provide shade.
We make houses from plants and make clothes from plants. Most of the food we eat is plants. Without plants, animals cannot survive.
Mosasaurus was an apex predator in its time, so it feared nothing except for other mosasaurs.
His long jaw was filled with over 70 razor-sharp teeth, also accompanied by an extra row on the upper part of his mouth. Meaning nothing could escape once it passed that mouth.
We don't yet know for sure, but it's likely its tongue was forked. Its diet included turtles, large fish, other mosasaurs, and it may have been a cannibal throughout its life.
That also attacks anything that enters the water, including giant dinosaurs like the T. rex, which were unable to match it.
Although most of their food is familiar to us, the Romans certainly had a hand in unusual or strange banquet fare, including wild boar, peacock, snails, and a type of rodent called a rat.
Another difference is that when poor people and women eat, they sit on chairs, whereas the wealthy enjoy elaborate meals together while relaxing and eating.
Ancient Roman cuisine could not accommodate the foods that came to Europe from America or from Asia in subsequent centuries.
For example, they did not have corn, tomatoes, potatoes, or chocolate, and no ancient Roman ever tasted turkey.
The Babylonian people built a main temple for each of their gods, which was considered the dwelling place of that god.
The people will make sacrifices to the gods, and the priests will strive to fulfill the needs of the deities through ceremonies and festivals.
Each temple has an open temple courtyard and a sanctuary inside that is only accessible to priests.
Sometimes special pyramid-shaped towers, called ziggurats, were built as part of a temple.
The top of the tower is a special sanctuary for the gods.
In the warm climate of the Middle East, houses are not that important.
Most Jewish family life takes place in the open air.
A woman is cooking in the yard; the shops used to be just open counters facing the street. Stones were used to build the house.
There were no large forests in the Land of Canaan, that's why the price of wood was very expensive.
Greenland is sparsely populated. Nordic sagas say that Erik the Red was exiled from Iceland for murder, and while traveling west, he discovered Greenland and named it as such.
However, despite their discoveries, the Eskimo tribe had already been living there at that time.
Although every country is 'Scandinavia', there are many differences between the people, kings, customs, and history of Denmark, Sweden, Norway, and Iceland.
If you have ever watched the movie National Treasure, you might think the treasure map is written on the back of the Declaration of Independence.
However, that's not true. Even though there's writing on the back, this document is not a treasure map.
At the back of the Declaration of Independence, there is the inscription "Original Declaration of Independence dated July 4, 1776." The text appears at the bottom of the document in reverse.
Although it is not known for sure who wrote it, it is known that at the beginning of the large parchment documents (measuring 29¾ inches by 24½ inches) were rolled up for storage.
So, that notation was most likely inserted just as a label.
The D-Day landings and subsequent fighting liberated northern France, but the southern part was still not free.
That region was ruled by the French "Vichy" regime. They were French people who had made a peace treaty with Germany in 1940 and collaborated with the occupiers instead of fighting them.
The allies invaded southern France on August 15, 1940. This invasion was codenamed "Operation Dragoon."
Only in two weeks, the American and French Liberation forces had liberated southern France and moved on to Germany.
Civilization is a single culture practiced together by a group of people who live and work together as a society.
The word "civilization" originates from the Latin word "civilis," which means civil, related to the Latin word "civis," meaning citizen, and "civitas," meaning city or city-state, and this also serves as a benchmark of the size of a society.
City states were pioneers of civilization. The culture of civilization means the transmission of knowledge across generations, remnants of cultural heritage, and its natural dissemination.
Minority cultures often disappear without leaving relevant historical evidence and fail to be recognized as worthy civilizations.
During the Revolutionary War, the thirteen original states first formed a weak central government—with the Congress as its sole component—under the Articles of Confederation.
The Congress has no power to levy taxes. Since there is no national executive or judiciary, the Congress relies on state authorities, which are often uncooperative, to enforce all of its actions.
He also does not have the authority to override interstate tax regulations and tariffs.
Those articles require unanimous consent from all states before they can be amended, whereas the states disregard the central government, so their representatives are often absent.
The Italian national football team, along with the German national football team, are the two most successful teams in the world and were FIFA World Cup champions in 2006.
Popular sports include: football (soccer), basketball, volleyball, water polo, fencing, rugby, cycling, ice hockey, field hockey, and Formula 1 car racing.
Winter sports are most popular in the northern region, with Italians competing in international competitions and the Olympic Games.
The Japanese have nearly 7,000 islands (with Honshu being the largest), making Japan the 7th largest island country in the world.
Due to the cluster/group of islands that Japan possesses, Japan is often referred to as an "archipelago" in geographical terms.
Taiwan's origins date back to the 15th century, when passing European sailors recorded the name of the island as Ilha Formosa, or the beautiful island.
In 1624, the Dutch East India Company established a base in southern Taiwan and initiated a transformation in local grain production practices, employing Chinese laborers to work in the rice paddies and sugar cane plantations.
In 1683, the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912) forces took over the western and northern coastal areas of Taiwan and declared Taiwan a province of the Qing Empire in 1885.
In 1895, following the defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War (1894-1895), the Qing government signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki, ceding its sovereignty over Taiwan to Japan, which ruled the island until 1945.
Machu Picchu consists of three main structures: Intihuatana, the Temple of the Sun, and the Room of Three Windows.
Most of the buildings on the edge of the complex have been rebuilt to give tourists a better idea of what the original appearance was like.
In 1976, 30 percent of Machu Picchu had been restored, and restoration continues to this day.
For example, the most common photographic format in the world is 35 mm, which was the dominant film size at the end of the analog film era.
It is still produced to this day, but more importantly, the aspect ratio has been inherited by the image sensor format of digital cameras.
The actual 35mm format is a bit confusing, with a width of 36mm and a height of 24mm.
This format's aspect ratio (divided by twelve to obtain the simplest whole number ratio) is therefore said to be 3:2.
Many common formats (for example, APS format groups) have an equivalent or near aspect ratio.
The rule of thirds, which is most often broken and underestimated, is a simple guideline that creates dynamism while maintaining order in an image.
It is mentioned that the most effective place for the main subject is the intersection of lines that divide the image into thirds vertically and horizontally (see example).
During a historic period in Europe, the Catholic Church (which became wealthy and powerful) was closely watched.
For over a thousand years, Christianity has united European nations despite their different languages and customs.
His/Her/Its pervasive power affected everyone, from the king to the common people.
One of the principles of Christian teaching is that wealth should be used to overcome suffering and poverty. The church's monetary funds are available for this purpose.
The central authority of the church has been in Rome for over a thousand years, and this concentration of power and money has led many to question whether the teachings have been fulfilled.
Immediately after hostilities broke out, Britain initiated a naval blockade of Germany.
That strategy proved effective, cutting off vital supplies to both military and civilian populations, although this blockade violates generally accepted international law codified in several international treaties over the past two centuries.
Britain has deployed mines in international waters to prevent ships from entering the entire ocean, endangering even neutral vessels.
Due to the limited response to this tactic, Germany suspected a similar response in its endless U-boat battles.
In the 1920s, the prevailing attitude among most citizens and the nation was pacifism and isolation.
After witnessing the horrors and atrocities of World War I, many countries intended to avoid similar situations in the future.
In 1884, Tesla moved to the United States to accept a job at Thomas Edison's company in New York City.
He arrived in the US with 4 cents in his name, one book of poetry, and a letter of recommendation from Charles Batchelor (his manager from a previous job) to Thomas Edison.
Ancient China had a unique way of denoting different periods of time; each stage in China or each ruling family was a different dynasty.
Furthermore, between each dynasty there were periods of instability with fragmented provinces. The most popular of this era is the epic Three Kingdoms, which took place over a 60-year period between the Han and Jin dynasties.
During this period, fierce warfare occurred among the nobles for the throne.
The Three Kingdoms period was one of the bloodiest eras in ancient Chinese history, with thousands of people dying fighting to sit in the highest seat in the grand palace in Xi'an.
There were many social and political impacts, such as the use of the metric system, the shift from absolute rule to a republic, nationalism, and the belief that the state belongs to the people, not a single ruler.
Furthermore, after the revolution, job openings were opened to all male applicants, creating opportunities for success for the most ambitious.
The same applies to the military, as instead of military ranks being based on class, they are now based on caliber.
The French Revolution also inspired many other oppressed working-class people from other countries to start their own revolutions.
Muhammad was very interested in things beyond this worldly life. He often visited a cave later known as "Hira" on Mount "Nur" (light) to contemplate.
He retreated into himself, enduring the passage of time, offering a vivid portrayal of Muhammad's spiritual inclination.
Located on the peak of one of the mountains north of the city of Mecca, the cave is truly isolated from the rest of the world.
In fact, this place is not easy to find, even when someone knows it exists. Once inside the cave, the condition is total isolation.
There's nothing to see but the beautiful and clear sky above and the mountains surrounding it. There's very little to see or hear inside this cave.
The Great Pyramid of Giza is the only one of the Seven Wonders that still stands today.
Built by Egyptians in the 3rd century BC, the Great Pyramid is one of many large pyramid structures built to honor the deceased pharaohs.
The Giza Plateau, or "Necropolis of Giza" in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt, contains several pyramids (among which the Great Pyramid is the largest), several smaller tombs, several temples, and the magnificent Sphinx.
The Great Pyramid was built to honor Pharaoh Khufu, and many of the smaller pyramids, tombs, and temples were built to honor Khufu's wife and family members.
The "rising arrow" symbol looks like a V, and the "falling arrow" symbol looks like a staple or a square without a bottom side.
Up means you have to start from the nock and pull the bow, and down means you have to start at the frog (which is where your hand holds the bow) and draw the bow.
Friction moving upwards usually produces a softer sound, while friction moving downwards is louder and more distinct.
Don't hesitate to write your own markings, but there's a musical reason for printed bow markings, so they are usually to be followed.
The frightened King Louis XVI, Queen Marie Antoinette, their two young children (Marie Therese, 11 years old, and Louis-Charles, 4 years old), and the King's sister, Madam Elizabeth, were forced to return to Paris from Versailles by a mob of market women on October 6, 1789.
With carriages, they traveled back to Paris surrounded by crowds of people shouting and making threats against the King and Queen.
The crowd forced the King and Queen to open their carriage windows wide.
At one point, one of the gang members waved the head of the royal guard who had been killed in Versailles in front of the terrified Queen.
The expenses for the US imperialist war of conquest in the Philippines were paid for by the Filipino people themselves.
They were forced to pay taxes to the US colonial regime to finance most of the expenses and interest on floating government bonds on behalf of the Philippine government through Wall Street banks.
The abundant profits gained from the prolonged exploitation of the Filipino people are, of course, a fundamental advantage for US imperialism.
To understand the Law, one must understand the context that led to the creation of the commandments.
The period during which these events took place is usually called the High Middle Ages of the European historical period in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (1000–1300 AD).
The High Middle Ages began in the Early Middle Ages and ended in the Late Middle Ages, around the year 1500 by convention.
Technological determinism is a term whose practice encompasses a wide range of ideas, from technological drive or technological necessity to the strict understanding that the fate of humanity is driven by a fundamental logic related to the laws of science and its technological manifestations.
Most interpretations of technological determinism contain two general ideas: that the development of technology itself follows a path that largely transcends the influence of culture or politics, and that technology ultimately has an inherent "effect" on society, rather than being merely socially conditioned.
For example, one could say that cars should lead to the development of highways.
Nevertheless, the national highway network is not economically viable for just a few cars, so new production methods have been developed to reduce the cost of car ownership.
Carpooling also contributes to a high number of road accidents, which has led to the discovery of new techniques in healthcare to repair damaged bodies.
Romanticism has a significant element of cultural determinism, drawing from writers such as Goethe, Fichte, and Schlegel.
Within the context of Romanticism, geography shapes individuals, and over time customs and cultures associated with that geography emerge, and this, in accordance with the place of a society, is better than arbitrarily imposed laws.
Just like Paris is known as the world's contemporary fashion capital, Constantinople was once considered the feudal capital of European fashion.
Its fame as a center of luxury dates back from around 400 to approximately 1100.
Its status declined in the twelfth century, particularly due to the return of the Crusaders bringing silk and spices worth more than what the Byzantine market offered.
It was then that the title of the Fashion Capital was moved from Constantinople to Paris.
Gothic style peaked during the period between the 10th and 11th centuries and in the 14th century.
Initially, clothing was greatly influenced by Byzantine culture in the east.
However, due to slow communication channels, the style in the West could fall 25 to 30 years behind.
Towards the end of the Middle Ages, Western Europe began to develop its own style. One of the biggest developments at the time was a consequence of the Crusades; people started wearing buttons to fasten their clothes.
Subsistence farming is farming done to produce enough food to meet the needs of the farmers and their families.
Subsistence farming is a simple, typically organic system that uses locally saved seeds from the same ecoregion, combined with crop rotation and other relatively simple techniques to maximize yields.
Historically, most farmers were involved in agricultural self-sufficiency, and this still occurs in many developing countries.
Subcultures unite like-minded individuals who feel ignored by societal norms and allow them to develop a sense of identity.
Subcultures can be differentiated by the age, ethnicity, class, location, and/or gender of their members.
The quality that distinguishes one subculture from another can be language, aesthetics, religion, politics, sexuality, geography, or a combination of several factors.
Members of a subculture typically signify their membership through the use of distinctive and symbolic styles, including fashion, behavior, and jargon.
One of the most common methods used to illustrate the importance of socialization is by examining the unfortunate cases of children who, due to neglect, misfortune, or intentional abuse, were not socialized by adults as they grew up.
Children like that are called "feral" or wild. Some feral children have been confined by people (usually their own parents); in some cases, this child neglect is caused by parents' rejection of severe intellectual or physical disabilities in a child.
Orphaned children may have experienced abuse or severe trauma before being abandoned or running away.
The others are suspected of being raised by animals; some people say they have lived in the wild on their own.
If raised entirely by non-human animals, orphaned animals exhibit behavior (within physical limits) almost entirely like the specific animal raising them, such as fear or indifference towards humans.
While project-based learning should make learning easier and more engaging, scaffolding goes even further.
Scaffolding is not a teaching method, but rather a support system that provides assistance to individuals undergoing a new learning experience, such as using new computer programs or starting a new project.
Scaffolding can take the form of virtual and real things; in other words, a teacher is a form of scaffolding, but so is a small paperclip character in Microsoft Office.
Virtual scaffolding is internalized within the software and aims to question, encourage, and explain procedures that might be too challenging for students to solve on their own.
Children are placed in foster care for various reasons, such as neglect, abuse, and even exploitation.
Children should not grow up in an environment that is uncaring, neglects, and doesn't educate them, but unfortunately, that is often the reality.
We consider the Foster Home System as a safe zone for these children.
Our care system should provide a safe home, loving caregivers, stable education, and reliable healthcare.
Caregivers should provide for all needs that were not met in their previous home.
The internet combines elements of mass and interpersonal communication.
The unique characteristics of the internet lead to additional dimensions in terms of usage and approaches to gratification.
For example, "learning" and "socializing" are recommended as important motivators for Internet use (James et al., 1995).
"Personal involvement" and "ongoing relationships" were also identified as new motivational aspects by Eighmey and McCord (1998) when they investigated audience reactions to websites.
The use of video recorders has led to the important discovery of microexpression interpretation and facial movements that occur in milliseconds.
Specifically, it is stated that we can detect whether someone is lying by correctly observing their microexpressions.
In his paper titled "The President's Speech," Oliver Sacks demonstrates how someone who doesn't understand speech due to brain damage can still accurately assess sincerity.
He even suggested that the ability to interpret human behavior like that might be possessed by animals such as pet dogs.
20th-century research indicates that there are two genetic variations: hidden and revealed.
Mutation adds new genetic variation, while selection removes it from the group of expression variations.
Segregation and recombination shuffle variations back and forth between two populations with each generation.
In the savanna, it is difficult for primates with a digestive system like humans to meet their amino acid needs from the available plant sources.
Furthermore, failure to do so has serious consequences, including stunted growth, malnutrition, and ultimately, death.
The plant-based source that is easiest to obtain is the protein found in leaves and nuts, but it is difficult to digest for primates like us, unless it has been cooked.
Conversely, insect food (ants, termites, eggs) is not only easily digestible, but also provides a high amount of protein containing all essential amino acids.
Considering everything, we shouldn't be surprised if our ancestors overcame the "protein problem" in a way that's remarkably similar to how chimpanzees in the savanna manage it today.
Sleep disturbances involve you waking up intentionally during a normal sleep period, then falling back asleep after a few moments (10–60 minutes).
This can be easily done by using a relatively quiet alarm clock to wake you up without fully waking you.
If you reset your alarm while still asleep, the clock can be placed on the other side of the room, forcing you to get up and turn it off.
Another biorhythm-based option involves drinking plenty of fluids (especially water or tea, a well-known diuretic) before bed, forcing people to wake up and urinate.
The amount of inner peace a person has is inversely correlated with the amount of tension in their body and soul.
The lower the tension, the more positive the life force. Everyone has the potential to find absolute peace and satisfaction.
Everyone can achieve enlightenment. The only thing that hinders us is our own tension and negative traits.
Tibetan Buddhism utilizes the foundation of Buddhist teachings, but then expands upon it with the emphasis of Mahayana compassion and incorporates many techniques from Indian Yoga.
Fundamentally, Tibetan Buddhism is very simple. It consists of Kundalini Yoga, meditation, and the path of love for all.
With Kundalini Yoga, Kundalini energy (energy of enlightenment) is awakened through yoga postures, breathing exercises, mantras, and visualization.
The Tibetan community's meditation center is Dewa Yoga. Through visualization of various deities, energy channels are cleansed, chakras are activated, and awareness of enlightenment is created.
Germany was a common enemy in World War II, which led to cooperation between the Soviet Union and the US. With the end of the war and systemic conflicts, processes and cultures resulted in the downfall of nations.
Two years after the end of the war, former allies became enemies, and the Cold War began.
That war lasted for the next 40 years and would be fought actively, by proxy forces, on battlefields from Africa to Asia, in Afghanistan, Cuba, and many other places.
On September 17, 1939, Poland's defenses were already breached, and the only hope was to retreat and regroup along the Romanian Bridge.
However, this plan was rendered obsolete overnight when over 800,000 troops of the Soviet Red Army entered and established a Belarusian and Ukrainian buffer zone after attacking eastern Poland, violating the Riga Peace Treaty, the Soviet-Polish Non-Aggression Pact, and other international agreements, both bilateral and multilateral.
Using ships to transport goods has so far been the most efficient way to move large numbers of people and goods across the ocean.
The navy's traditional task is to ensure that your country is able to defend its ability to move people and goods, and at the same time, to hinder your adversary's ability to move people and goods.
One of the most important and recent examples of this is the North Atlantic campaign at the PDII. America tried to move troops and materials across the Atlantic Ocean to aid England.
At the same time, the German navy, which mostly used U-boats, attempted to prevent this congestion.
If only the Allies had failed, Germany might have been able to conquer Britain just as it did with other European countries.
Goats apparently began to be domesticated around 10,000 years ago in the Zagros Mountains of Iran.
Ancient cultures and tribes began to raise goats for easy access to milk, wool, meat, and skin.
Pet goats typically watch over the herd as it wanders to hills or other grazing areas. Goats are often used by children or adults, similar to shepherds. This grazing method is still used to this day.
Wagonways were built in England in the early 16th century.
Although the railway tracks only consisted of parallel wooden planks, horses could pull carts on this track, allowing them to move faster and carry heavier loads compared to the slightly rougher roads at the time.
Rail pads were introduced from the beginning to hold the track in place. However, it was gradually realized that the track would be more efficient if it had a layer of iron on top.
This has become a common practice, but iron causes the wooden wheels on carts to break more quickly.
Ultimately, wooden wheels were replaced by iron wheels. In 1767, the first rails made entirely of iron were born.
The first known mode of transportation was walking. With the emergence of Homo Erectus (meaning upright man) two million years ago, humans began to walk upright.
Their predecessors, Australopithecus, did not walk upright as usual.
Bipedalism was first found in Australopithecus fossils from 4.2-3.9 million years ago, although Sahelanthropus may have already been walking on two legs as early as seven million years ago.
We can start living in harmony with the environment, we can join environmental movements, and we can even become activists to reduce the impact caused in the future.
This is like symptomatic treatment in many cases. However, if we don't just want a temporary solution, then we must find the root cause of the problem and disable it.
It is quite clear that the world is developing due to science and technology, and the excessive population and wasteful lifestyles of humans are becoming quite significant problems.
After being adopted by the Congress on July 4th, the handwritten draft signed by President of the Congress John Hancock and Secretary Charles Thomson was carried several blocks to the printing shop of John Dunlap.
Throughout the night, around 150 to 200 specimens were created, now known as "Dunlap broadsides."
The document was first read aloud publicly by John Nixon in the halls of Independence Hall on July 8th.
One was sent to George Washington on July 6th, who read it to his troops in New York on July 9th. A copy arrived in London on August 10th.
The known 25 Dunlap broadside is the oldest surviving copy of the document. The original handwritten copy is no longer in existence.
Many paleontologists now believe that one group of dinosaurs survived and is still alive today. We call them birds.
Many people don't think they are dinosaurs because they have fur and can fly.
However, there are many things about birds that still look like dinosaurs.
They have scaly feet with claws, lay eggs, and walk on two hind legs like a T-Rex.
Almost all computers used today are based on the manipulation of information encoded in the form of binary numbers.
Binary numbers can only have one of two values, namely 0 or 1, and these numbers are called binary digits – or bits, as computer jargon.
Internal poisoning may not be immediately apparent. Symptoms such as vomiting are quite common, making immediate diagnosis difficult.
The best indication of internal poisoning may be seen in the presence of open medication or poisonous household chemicals.
Check the first aid instructions label specific to the particular poison.
The term insect is used by entomologists in a formal sense for this group of insects.
This term comes from a past familiarity with lice, which are insects that are extremely adaptable as parasites on humans.
Both Bed Bugs and Cockroaches are nidicolous animals, adapted to live in the nests or homes of their hosts.
Across the United States, there are approximately 400,000 registered cases of Multiple Sclerosis (MS), making it a leading neurological disease in young and middle adulthood.
MS is a disease that affects the central nervous system, which is formed from the brain, spinal cord, and optic nerves.
The research found that women are twice as likely to develop MS as men.
A couple can decide that for their own good, or for the sake of their child's well-being, to raise a child.
This couple can choose to create an adoption plan for their baby.
In an adoption, the biological parents relinquish their custody rights so that another couple can raise the child.
The main goal of science is to understand how the world works through the scientific method. This method actually guides most scientific research.
This is not isolated; experimentation, and an experiment is a test used to eliminate one or more of the possible hypotheses, asking questions, and making observations also guide scientific research.
Naturalists and philosophers focused on classical texts, particularly the Bible in Latin.
Aristotle's view on all scientific problems, including psychology, has been accepted.
As interest in Greek knowledge dwindled, the West found itself disconnected from the roots of Greek philosophy and science.
Many people pay attention to rhythms in physiology, and behavior often depends on the presence of endogenous cycles and their production through the biological clock.
Periodic rhythms, which are not only responses to external periodic cues, have been recorded in most living organisms, including fungi, bacteria, animals, and plants.
The biological clock is a self-sustaining oscillator that continues to run its cycle freely even in the absence of external cues.
The Hershey and Chase experiment was one of the main proposals that stated that DNA is the genetic material.
Hershey and Chase used phage, or viruses, to inject their own DNA into bacteria.
They have conducted two experiments: labeling DNA inside the phage with radioactive phosphorus and labeling phage proteins with radioactive sulfur.
The effects of mutation can vary, depending on the type of mutation, the significance of the affected genetic material, and whether the affected cell is a bacterial stem cell.
Only mutations in germline cells can be passed on to offspring, while other mutations can cause cell death or cancer.
Nature-based tourism attracts people to visit natural areas to enjoy the scenery, including wildlife and plants.
Examples of activities at the site include hunting, fishing, photography, birdwatching, and visiting the park, as well as learning about the ecosystem.
For example, visiting, photographing, and learning about orangutans in Kalimantan.
Every morning, people leave the small town by car to go to work and encounter others whose work destination is the place they just left.
In this dynamic pick-up and drop-off service, everyone is connected to, and supports, a transportation system based on private cars.
Scientific knowledge now indicates that this massive carbon economy has destabilized the biosphere from one of its stable states that has supported human evolution for the past two million years.
Everyone participates in society and uses the transportation system. Almost everyone complains about the transportation system.
In developed countries, you rarely hear about the same level of complaints regarding water quality or collapsing bridges.
Why are complaints like this arising about the transportation system? Why do their services always fail? Are transportation engineers incompetent? Or is there something more fundamental happening right now?
Traffic flow is the study of the movement of individual drivers and vehicles between two points and the interactions they create with each other.
Unfortunately, understanding traffic flow is difficult because driver behavior cannot be predicted with one hundred percent certainty.
Fortunately, drivers tend to behave within a reasonably consistent range; therefore, traffic flow tends to have reasonable consistency and can be roughly represented mathematically.
To better represent traffic flow, a relationship has been established between three main characteristics: (1) flow, (2) density, and (3) speed.
This relationship helps in planning, designing, and operating highway facilities.
Insects were the first animals to explore outer space. Their ability to fly helped them avoid enemies more easily and find food and mates more efficiently.
Most insects have the advantage of being able to fold their wings parallel to their body.
This gives them a wider range of options for small places to hide from predators.
Currently, the only insects that cannot fold their wings are dragonflies and damselflies.
Thousands of years ago, a man named Aristarchus said that the Solar System revolves around the Sun.
Some people believe he is right, but many believe the opposite; the Solar System, including the Sun (and even other stars), revolves around the Earth.
This seems logical, because the Earth doesn't feel like it's moving, right?
The Amazon River is the second longest and largest river in the world. This river carries 8 times more water than the second largest river.
Amazon is also the widest river in the world, with a width of approximately 9.6 kilometers.
As much as 20 percent of the water flowing from various rivers into the oceans on this planet comes from the Amazon.
The Amazon River is 6,387 km (3,980 miles) long. It receives water from thousands of smaller rivers.
Although the construction of pyramids with stone continued until the end of the Old Kingdom, the size and perfection of the construction techniques of the Giza pyramids were never surpassed.
The New Kingdom of ancient Egypt admired the monuments of its predecessors, which were then over a thousand years old.
The population of Vatican City is around 800. It is the smallest independent state in the world and the country with the lowest population.
The Vatican City uses the Italian language in its legislation and official communications.
Italian is also a daily language used by most people who work in that country, while Latin is often used in religious ceremonies.
All citizens of Vatican City are Roman Catholics.
People have known about basic chemical elements like gold, silver, and copper since ancient times because they can all be found in nature in their original form and are relatively easy to mine with primitive tools.
Aristotle, a philosopher, theorized that everything is made of a mixture of one or more of the four elements: earth, water, air, and fire.
This is more like four properties of matter (in the same order): solid, liquid, gas, and plasma, although he also theorized that they transform into new substances to form what we see.
Basically, alloy is a mixture of two or more metals. Remember, there are many elements on the periodic table.
Elements like calcium and potassium are metals. Of course, there are also metals like silver and gold.
You can also have an alloy metal containing a small amount of non-metallic elements such as carbon.
Everything in the Universe is made of matter. All matter is made of tiny particles called atoms.
Atoms are incredibly small, so the period at the end of this sentence can hold several trillion atoms.
Upon its emergence, the pencil became a good friend to many people.
Unfortunately, with the emergence of newer writing methods, the status and use of pencils have declined.
People now write messages on computer screens, never needing to use a pencil sharpener.
People can only wonder what keyboards will become when something newer emerges.
A fission bomb works on the principle that energy is required to form an atomic nucleus with many protons and neutrons.
Like pushing a heavy cart uphill. Splitting the nucleus again and then releasing some of that energy.
Some atoms have unstable nuclei, meaning the atoms tend to break apart with little or no touch.
The surface of the Moon is made up of rocks and dust. The outermost layer of the Moon is called the crust.
The crust is about 70 km thick on the near side and 100 km thick on the far side.
This is thinner under Maria and thicker under the plateau.
There's a possibility of more dark areas on the near side because the crust is thinner. Lava rises more easily to the surface.
The theory of satisfaction centers on discovering what motivates people or what interests them.
These various theories suggest that humans have certain needs and/or desires that have been internalized as they mature.
This theory analyzes the characteristics of people that drive their desires, and the environmental factors that influence their actions or inactions.
Two well-known motivation theories are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs Theory and Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory.
Generally, two behaviors can emerge when a manager begins leading their former colleagues. One end of the spectrum is trying to remain "one of the guys" (or gals).
Managers like this have difficulty making unpopular decisions, taking disciplinary action, conducting performance evaluations, assigning responsibility, and holding people accountable.
At the other end of the spectrum, someone transforms into an unrecognizable individual, feeling that they must change everything the team has done and do it alone.
Ultimately, the leader is responsible for the success and failure of the team.
This behavior often leads to division between leaders and team members.
Virtual teams have the same standards of excellence as conventional teams, but there are some slight differences.
Members of virtual teams often serve as a point of contact for their physical in-person groups.
They often have more autonomy than conventional team members because their teams may meet across different time zones that local management may not understand.
The presence of the true "shadow team" (Larson & LaFasto, 1989, p. 109) is also a unique component of a virtual team.
"Stealth teams" are management teams where each member reports. These invisible teams set standards for each member.
Why do organizations want to go through a time-consuming process in establishing a learning organization? One of the goals of organizational learning concepts is innovation.
If all available resources are used effectively across all functional departments of the organization, creativity and ingenuity can thrive.
Consequently, the collaborative problem-solving process within an organization can spark new, innovative processes to serve customer needs.
Before an organization can be innovative, leadership must foster a culture of innovation and share the organization's knowledge and learning.
Angel (2006) explains the Continuum approach as a method used to help organizations achieve higher performance levels.
Neurobiological data provides physical evidence for theoretical approaches to the investigation of cognition. Therefore, this data narrows the research area and makes it much more precise.
The correlation between brain pathology and behavior supports scientists in their research.
It has long been known that brain damage, trauma, lesions, and tumors impact behavioral changes and certain mental functions.
The emergence of new technology allows us to see and investigate brain structures and processes that were previously unseen.
This provides us with a lot of information and material for constructing simulation models that help us understand the processes within our minds.
Although Artificial Intelligence has a strong connotation from science fiction, it forms a very important branch of computer science, dealing with the behavior, learning, and adaptation of intelligence in machines.
Research in Artificial Intelligence involves creating machines to automate tasks that require intelligent behavior.
Examples include control, planning and scheduling, the ability to answer customer diagnoses and questions, as well as handwriting, voice, and face recognition.
Things like this have become a separate discipline, focusing on providing solutions to real-world problems in life.
AI systems are now frequently used in fields such as economics, medicine, engineering, and military applications, as seen in various home computer applications and video game software.
Darmawisata is an important part of school. Often, a teacher will gladly take their students to places that cannot be accessed by bus.
Technology offers solutions through virtual field trips. Students can view museum artifacts, visit aquariums, or admire beautiful art while sitting in their classroom.
Sharing a virtual field trip is also a great way to reflect on the journey and share experiences with future classes.
For example, every year students from Bennet School in North Carolina design a website about their trip to the state capital. Each year the website is redesigned, but the old version is kept online as a travelogue.
Blogs can also help improve students' writing skills. Meanwhile, students usually start by gaining experience creating blogs with poor grammar and spelling, but the presence of a general audience changes that.
Because students are typically the most critical audience, bloggers have begun to strive to improve the quality of their writing in order to avoid criticism.
Furthermore, blogs also "force students to be more aware of the world around them." The necessity to satisfy an audience inspires students to be clever and engaging (Toto, 2004).
A blog is a tool that inspires collaboration and encourages learners to expand their learning beyond the regular school environment.
"The appropriate use of blogs can empower students to be more analytical and critical: by actively responding to online material, students can define their position within the context of other writings and also outline their opinions on a number of issues (Oravec, 2002)."
Ottawa is a charming capital city of Canada, operating in two languages, and featuring a variety of art galleries and museums showcasing Canada past and present.
Far to the south lies Niagara Falls, and to the north is home to the untouched natural beauty of Muskoka and its surroundings.
All of this and various other things highlight Ontario as what outsiders fundamentally perceive Canada to be.
The vast area to the north is sparsely populated, and some are even wilderness areas that are almost uninhabitable.
Here is a surprising population comparison for many: there are more African Americans living in the US than the population of Canada.
The East African Islands are located in the Indian Ocean off the east coast of Africa.
Madagascar is currently the largest and most unique continent in terms of wildlife.
Most of the smaller islands are independent states or associated with France and are known for their luxurious beach resorts.
The Arab people also brought Islam to that region, where it subsequently flourished in Comoros and Mayotte.
The influence and colonialism of Europe began in the 15th century, when the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama discovered the Cape Route from Europe to India.
To the north, this region borders the Sahel, and to the south and west it borders the Atlantic Ocean.
Woman: Female tourists are advised to say they are married, regardless of their actual marital status.
If you are also wearing a ring, it would be very helpful (just not one that looks too expensive).
Women must realize that cultural differences can lead to what they perceive as harassment, and often this is followed by grabbing of the arm, etc.
Be firm in rejecting men, and don't be afraid to stand up for your opinions (cultural differences or not, that doesn't mean it should be tolerated!).
The modern city of Casablanca was founded by Berber fishermen in the 10th century BC, and was used by the Phoenicians, Romans, and Merenids as a strategic port called Anfa.
The Portuguese destroyed it and rebuilt it as the Casa Branca, only to abandon it after the earthquake in 1755.
The Sultan of Morocco rebuilt the city as Daru I-Badya. It was later named Casablanca by Spanish traders who established a trading post there.
Casablanca is one of the least interesting places to shop in all of Morocco.
Around the old city of Medina, it's easy to find shops selling traditional Moroccan goods, such as tagines, pottery, leather goods, hookahs, and various trinkets, but all of this is geared towards tourists.
Goma is a tourist city in the Democratic Republic of the Congo in the far east region, near Rwanda.
In 2002, Goma was destroyed by lava from Mount Nyiragongo, which buried most of the city's roads, especially the city center.
Although Goma is relatively safe, every trip outside of Goma should be researched to understand the ongoing battle situation in North Kivu Province.
This city is also a base for climbing Mount Nyiragongo and some of the cheapest trips to search for Mountain Gorillas in Africa.
You can use boda-bodas (motorcycle taxis) to get around Goma. The normal (local) price is approximately 500 Congolese Francs for a short trip.
Due to its relatively difficult accessibility, "Timbuktu" has been used as a metaphor for an exotic and faraway land.
Currently, Timbuktu is a poor city, although its reputation makes it a tourist attraction, and it has an airport.
In 1990, Timbuktu was inscribed on the list of World Heritage sites in danger due to the threat of desert sands.
This site is one of the main stops on the PBS special, Wonders of the African World by Henry Louis Gates.
This city is very contrasting with other cities in the country because it has a more Arab style than African.
Kruger National Park (KNP) is located in northeastern South Africa and stretches along the border with Mozambique to the east, Zimbabwe to the north, and the southern border is the Crocodile River.
This park covers 19,500 km² and is divided into 14 different ecozones, each supporting different wildlife.
This is one of South Africa's main attractions and is considered a flagship of South African National Parks (SANParks).
Like all South African National Parks, this park implements a daily entry and conservation fee.
It might also be beneficial for someone to purchase a Wild Card, which provides access to several selected parks in South Africa or all national parks in South Africa.
Hong Kong Island is the origin of the name of the Hong Kong region and is considered by many tourists to be the main focus.
The row of buildings that make Hong Kong's skyline resemble a sparkling bar graph is further accentuated by its reflection in Victoria Harbour.
To get the best view of Hong Kong, leave the island and go to the waterfront of Kowloon on the other side.
Most of Hong Kong Island's urban development is crammed onto reclaimed land along the northern coast.
This is a place seized by the British colonizers as their property, and if you are looking for evidence of past colonial territory, this is the perfect place to start.
The Sundarbans is the world's largest mangrove forest, stretching 80 km (50 miles) from the coast into the depths of Bangladesh and India.
The Sundarbans has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The forest area in the Indian region is called Sundarbans National Park.
The forest is not just a mangrove swamp—it also includes several trees that still stand in the vast forest that once covered the Ganges plain.
The Sundarbans covers an area of 3,850 km², of which about one-third is covered by water/swamp areas.
Since 1966, the Sundarbans has been a sanctuary for wildlife, and it is estimated that there are currently 400 Royal Bengal tigers and around 30,000 spotted deer in the area.
Buses depart from the inter-district bus terminal (across the river) all day long, although most, especially those heading east and to Jakarta/Bumthang, leave between 6:30 AM and 7:30 AM.
Intercity buses are usually full, so it's best to buy tickets a few days in advance.
Most districts are served by small, comfortable, and sturdy Japanese coasters.
Ride-sharing taxis are a quick and convenient way to travel to nearby places, such as Paro (Nu 150) and Punakha (Nu 200).
The Oyapock River Bridge is a suspension bridge. Spanning the Oyapock River to connect the towns of Oiapoque in Brazil and Saint-Georges de l'Oyapock in French Guiana.
These two towers soar to a height of 83 meters, are 378 meters long, and have two lanes, each 3.50 meters wide.
The vertical space under the long bridge is 15 meters. Construction was completed in August 2011, and it was only opened for passage in March 2017.
The bridge was planned to be fully operational in September 2017, coinciding with the planned completion of the Brazilian customs checkpoint.
The Guaraní are the most significant indigenous group inhabiting the area now known as Eastern Paraguay, living as semi-nomadic hunters who also practice subsistence agriculture.
The Chaco region is home to other indigenous tribes such as the Guaycurú and Payaguá, who survive by hunting, gathering, and fishing.
In the 16th century, Paraguay, previously known as the "Giant Province of India," came into being as a result of the encounter between Spanish conquistadors and the native indigenous groups.
The Spanish nation began a period of colonization that lasted for three centuries.
Since Asunción was founded in 1537, Paraguay has successfully maintained many of its original characteristics and identity.
Argentina is known for having one of the best polo teams and players in the world.
The biggest tournament of the year will take place in December at the polo field in Las Cañitas.
Tournaments and smaller matches can also be viewed here at other times throughout the year.
For news about the tournament and where to buy tickets for the polo matches, visit the Argentine Polo Association.
The official currency of the Falkland Islands is the Falkland Pound (FKP), which is pegged to the British Pound (GBP).
Money can be exchanged at the only bank on the island located in Stanley, across from the FIC West store.
The British Pound is generally accepted throughout the island, and in Stanley town, credit cards and US dollars are also usually accepted.
On remote islands, credit cards are likely not accepted, although British and American currency might be. Ask the owner beforehand to confirm their accepted payment methods.
Exchanging Falkland Islands currency outside the islands is almost impossible, so exchange it before you leave.
Because Montevideo is located south of the Equator, its summer coincides with winter in the Northern Hemisphere, and vice versa.
Montevideo is located in a subtropical region; temperatures above 30°C are common during the summer months.
Winter can be extremely cold: temperatures rarely drop below freezing, but the combination of wind and humidity makes it feel colder than the temperature shown on the thermometer.
There are no "rainy" or "dry" seasons: because the amount of rainfall is almost always the same throughout the entire year.
Even though most of the animals in this park are used to meeting humans, wildlife remains wild and should not be fed or disturbed.
According to park authorities, stay at least 100 meters away from bears and wolves, and 25 meters away from other wildlife.
No matter how docile they may appear, bison, deer, elk, bears, and almost all large animals can attack.
Every year, dozens of visitors are injured because they don't maintain a safe distance. These animals are large, wild, and potentially dangerous, so it's best to keep your distance.
Furthermore, be aware that strong smells attract bears and other wildlife, so avoid bringing or cooking smelly food and keep your campsite clean.
Apia is the capital of Samoa. The city is located on the island of Upolu and has a population of less than 40,000.
Apia was discovered in the 1850s and has been the official capital of Samoa since 1959.
That port was the site of a famous naval deadlock in 1889 when seven ships from Germany, the US, and Britain refused to leave the harbor.
All the ships were sunk, except for one British cruiser. Nearly 200 Americans and Germans lost their lives.
During the struggle for independence managed by the Mau movement, a peaceful meeting in the city ended with the assassination of an important leader: Tupua Tamasese Lealofi III.
There are many beaches, due to Auckland's position encompassing two harbors. The most popular ones are located in three regions.
North Shore Beach (located within the North Harbour district) lies in the Pacific Ocean and stretches from Long Bay in the north to Devonport in the south.
Almost all of its beaches are sandy with safe swimming areas, and most have shaded spots provided by groves of pohutukawa trees.
Tamaki Drive Beach is located in Waitemata Harbour, on the outskirts of the upscale Mission Bay and St Heliers suburbs in Central Auckland.
These beaches are sometimes filled with families and feature nice shops lining the shore. It's safe to swim here.
The main local beer is "Number One," it's not a complex beer, but it's enjoyable and refreshing. Another local beer is called "Manta."
There are many French wines to be had, but New Zealand and Australian wines might be better for travel.
Local tap water is very safe to drink, but bottled water is easily found if you're worried.
For Australians, the idea of a 'flat white' coffee is something foreign. Black coffee is simply 'espresso', cappuccino comes with a high cream content (not foam), and tea is served without milk.
That hot chocolate meets Belgian standards. The fruit juice is expensive but delicious.
Many diving trips occur year-round, and accidents while diving due to these activities are very rare.
Nevertheless, listen to the advice of the authorities, obey all signs, and pay close attention to safety warnings.
Box jellyfish appear near the coast and river mouths from October to April, dating back to 1770. These jellyfish can sometimes be found outside of these times.
Sharks do exist, but rarely attack humans. Most sharks are afraid of humans and will swim away.
Saltwater crocodiles are inactive in the sea, their primary habitat being the estuaries north of Rockhampton.
Booking in advance puts tourists at ease because they are sure they have a place to sleep when they arrive at their destination.
Travel agents often have agreements with certain hotels, although you can book other forms of accommodation, such as campsites, through the travel agent.
Travel agencies typically offer packages that include breakfast, transportation arrangements to/from the airport, or even combined flight and hotel packages.
They can also hold your reservation if you need time to consider the offer or obtain other documents for your purpose (e.g., a visa).
Any changes or requests must be arranged through the travel agent first and not directly with the hotel.
For many festivals, a large majority of music festival attendees choose to camp on-site, and most visitors consider it an important part of the experience.
If you want to be close to the performance, you should arrive early to get a campsite near the music.
Remember that even though the music on the main stage has ended, there will be a festival section that continues to play music until late at night.
Some festivals have camping areas specifically for families with young children.
If navigating the North Baltic Sea in winter, check cabin locations, as the noise of the ice is extraordinary, especially for those most affected.
The cruise ship Saint Petersburg includes time in the city. Cruise ship passengers are exempt from visa requirements (check the requirements).
Casinos typically make many efforts to optimize the time and money spent by their guests. Windows and clocks are usually absent, and exits can be difficult to find.
They usually have special offers for food, drinks, and entertainment to maintain guests' moods and keep them at the venue.
Some places offer free alcoholic beverages. However, being drunk impairs mental clarity, and all expert gamblers know the importance of staying sober.
Anyone who will drive at high altitudes or through mountainous regions needs to consider the possibility of snow, ice, or freezing temperatures.
On a slippery and snowy highway, traction is low, and you can't drive like you would on regular asphalt.
During a blizzard, you can be trapped by rapidly falling snow.
Visibility may also be limited by falling or blowing snow, or by condensation or ice on the vehicle windows.
On the other hand, cold and snowy conditions are considered normal in many countries and traffic continues uninterrupted throughout the year.
Safari is probably the most attractive tourist activity in Africa and a highlight for many visitors.
The popular term "safari" refers to a land journey to see the amazing African wildlife, especially in the savanna.
Some animals, such as elephants and giraffes, tend to approach cars, so standard equipment already allows for good observation.
Lions, cheetahs, and leopards sometimes don't want to show themselves and are best viewed with binoculars.
A safari walk (also known as "walking in the bushes," "safari hike," or simply "walking") involves trekking, ranging from a few hours to several days.
The Paralympics will take place from August 24th to September 5th, 2021. Several sporting events will be held at various other locations in Japan.
Tokyo will be the only city in Asia to have hosted the Summer Olympics twice, following the first in 1964.
If you booked flights and accommodations for 2020 before the postponement was announced, you might be in a difficult situation.
Cancellation policies vary, but by the end of March, most coronavirus-related cancellation policies were not extended until July 2020, when the Olympics were scheduled.
Most event tickets are expected to cost between ¥2,500 and ¥130,000, while regular tickets are priced around ¥7,000.
Ironing damp clothes can help them dry quickly. Many hotels have irons and ironing boards available for borrowing, even if they aren't in the room.
If an iron is unavailable or you don't want to wear ironed socks, you can use a hairdryer, if available.
Be careful not to let the fabric get too hot (which can cause shrinkage, or in extreme cases, scorching).
There are various ways to purify water, some of which are more effective against specific threats.
In some areas, boiling water for one minute is considered sufficient, while in other areas it takes several minutes.
The effectiveness of the filter varies, and if you're concerned, you should consider buying bottled water from a reputable company.
Travelers may encounter unfamiliar pests in their hometowns.
Pests can damage food, cause irritation, or in more severe cases, trigger allergic reactions, spread toxins, or transmit diseases.
Infectious diseases, or dangerous animals that can injure or kill humans with their power, are usually not included in the category of pests.
Shopping at duty-free shops is an opportunity to buy goods that are exempt from taxes and excise duties at various locations.
Tourists traveling to high-tax countries can sometimes save money on products like alcoholic beverages and tobacco.
The stretch between Point Marion and Fairmont presents the most challenging driving conditions on the Buffalo-Pittsburgh highway, often traversing remote inland areas.
If you are not used to driving on rural roads, be careful: there are many steep inclines, narrow roads, and sharp turns.
The speed limit is lower than the preceding and following sections—generally 35-40 mph (56-64 km/h)—and it's important to adhere to it strictly, rather than the other way around.
Even though, strangely, mobile phone service is stronger here than in other places along this route, for example in Pennsylvania Wilds.
German cookies are quite tasty, and in Bavaria the cookies are quite rich and varied, similar to their southern neighbors, Austria.
Fruit shortbread is common, with apples cooked into shortbread year-round, and then there are cherries and plums that appear in the summer.
Many German grilled foods also serve almonds, hazelnuts, and other tree nuts. Popular cakes are often a good match with a cup of strong coffee.
If you want a small but flavorful pastry, try a Berliner, Pfannkuchen, or Krapfen, depending on the region you are in.
Kari is a dish consisting of spices and seasonings, accompanied by meat or vegetables.
Curry can be "dry" or "wet", depending on the amount of liquid.
In the northern Indian and Pakistani inland regions, plain yogurt is commonly used in curry dishes. In southern India and several other coastal areas of the subcontinent, coconut milk is more commonly used.
There are 17,000 islands to choose from, and Indonesian food is a general term that represents the diverse cuisines found throughout the country.
However, if used without further qualification, the term tends to mean food originating from the central and eastern parts of the main island of Java.
Javanese cuisine is now widely available throughout the archipelago, offering a variety of dishes with simple seasonings. The main seasonings favored for Javanese flavors are peanuts, chili, sugar (especially Javanese palm sugar), and various aromatic spices.
A stirrup is a support for the rider's foot that hangs on either side of the saddle.
That provides greater stability for the rider, but potentially raises safety concerns due to the possibility of the rider's feet getting caught in it.
If a rider is thrown from a horse but their foot gets caught in the stirrup, they can be dragged if the horse runs. To minimize the risk, a number of safety precautions are taken.
Firstly, most drivers wear driving boots with heels and smooth, narrow soles.
Next, some saddles, particularly English saddles, have safety bars that allow the stirrup leather to fall from the saddle if pulled backward by a falling rider.

Its highest section offers a breathtaking view of the summit. Climbers from around the world continue to create new routes among its limitless potential walls.
Snow sports, encompassing skiing and snowboarding, are popular activities involving gliding over snow-covered terrain using skis or a snowboard attached to your feet.
Skiing has become a primary travel activity with many enthusiasts, sometimes nicknamed "ski bums," which are people who plan their entire vacation around skiing at a specific location.
The idea of skiing is very old—cave paintings depicting skiers date back to 5000 BC!
Downhill skiing has existed since around the 17th century, and in 1861 the first recreational ski club was opened by Norwegians in Australia.
Backpacking by ski is also known as ski touring or ski mountaineering.
This is related, but usually not connected to ski touring or alpine climbing, the latter of which is done on steep terrain and requires much more robust boots and skis.
Think of a ski route as a familiar hiking route.
When conditions are good, you can travel further than walking – but it's rare you can be as fast as cross-country skiing without carrying a heavy backpack on a smooth trail.
Europe is a relatively small continent but has many independent countries. Under normal circumstances, traveling to several of these countries requires us to apply for a visa and go through passport checks more than once.
The Schengen Area, however, works in the same way as a single country in this regard.
As long as you stay within this zone, you can generally cross the border without going through passport checkpoints again.
Similarly, with a Schengen visa, you don't need to apply for a visa to each Schengen member state separately, which saves time, money, and paperwork.
There is no universal definition that determines which products are considered antiques. Some tax offices define items older than 100 years as antiques.
The definition has geographic variation, with shorter age limits in places like North America than in Europe.
Handicrafts can be defined as antique objects even though their age is younger than similar items produced in mass quantities.
Reindeer herding is an important source of livelihood for the Sami people. The culture related to its trade is also important to many people and professions.
Although traditionally not all Sámi herded reindeer on a large scale, they lived off fishing, hunting, and similar activities, primarily utilizing reindeer as work animals.
Currently, many Sámi people work in the modern trade. Tourism is an important source of income in Sápmi, the Sámi region.

If the country you are traveling to is subject to travel advisories, your travel health insurance or your trip cancellation insurance may be affected.
You might also want to seek advice from other governments besides your own, but their advice is designed for their citizens.
For example, American citizens in the Middle East may face different situations than Europeans or Arabs.
Advice is a brief summary of the political situation in a country.
The perspective offered is usually superficial, general, and overly simplistic compared to more detailed information available elsewhere.
Severe weather is a general term for hazardous weather phenomena that have the potential to cause damage, serious social disruption, or loss of human life.
Bad weather can occur anywhere in the world, and the types vary depending on geographical, topographic, and atmospheric conditions.
Strong winds, hail, excessive rainfall, and forest fires are forms and effects of bad weather, such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, whirlwinds, and cyclones.
Regional and seasonal adverse weather phenomena include blizzards, ice storms, hailstorms, and dust storms.
Tourists are strongly advised to be cautious of the risk of bad weather affecting their area, as this could impact any travel plans.
Anyone planning to visit a country classified as a war zone must obtain professional training.
Searching on the internet for "Unfriendly Environmental Course" might provide the address of a local company.
The lessons will generally cover all the issues discussed here in much greater detail, usually accompanied by practical experience.
The lessons last for 2-5 days and will involve role-playing, a lot of first aid, and sometimes weapon training.
Books and magazines about surviving in the wilderness are common, but publications about battlefields are relatively scarce.
People planning to undergo gender reassignment surgery abroad must ensure they have valid travel documents for their return.
The government's willingness to issue passports with gender markers that are not specified (X) or updated documents to reflect the desired name and gender varies.
The willingness of foreign governments to respect these documents varies greatly.
Security checks at checkpoints have also become much more intrusive since the 9/11 era of 2001.
Transgender individuals before surgery cannot pass through scanners with their privacy and dignity fully intact.
Rip currents are currents flowing back from breaking waves at the beach, often around rocks or similar formations.
Due to its underwater topography, back currents are concentrated in deeper areas, and fast currents to deeper waters can form there.
Most deaths are caused by exhaustion while trying to swim against the current, which is an impossible feat.
Once you get out of the current, swimming back isn't as difficult as usual.
Try to go to another place where you won't be caught again, or, depending on your ability and whether you've already been noticed, you might want to wait for help to arrive.
The shock of returning is faster than culture shock (less than the honeymoon phase), lasts longer, and can be more severe.
Travelers who easily adapt to new cultures sometimes have a difficult time readjusting to their native culture.
When returning home after living abroad, you have adapted to a new culture and lost some habits from your original culture.
When you go abroad for the first time, people may be patient and understanding because they know that tourists in a new country need to adapt.
People may not expect that understanding and patience are also needed for travelers returning home.
The pyramid's sound and light show is one of the most captivating attractions for children in this area.
You can see the pyramid in the dark, and you can see it secretly before the show starts.
Usually, you always hear the sounds of tourists and vendors. The story, which is replete with imagery of sound and light, is like a fairytale.
The Sphinx serves as both a setting and narrator for a lengthy story.
The scene was shown at the pyramid, and other pyramids were illuminated.
The South Shetland Islands, discovered in 1819, are claimed by several countries and have the most bases, with sixteen active in 2020.
These islands are located 120 km north of the Peninsula. The largest island is King George Island, which has the Villa Las Estrellas settlement.
Others like Livingston Island and Deception are flooded calderas that are still active volcanoes, forming a spectacular natural harbor.
Ellsworth Land is a region south of the Peninsula, bordering the Bellingshausen Sea.
The mountains in this peninsula merge into a plateau, then reappear to form the 360 km-long Ellsword Mountain Range, split by the Minnesota Glacier.
In the northern part of or the Sentinel Range stands Antarctica's highest mountain, Vinson Massif, which peaks at 4892 m Mount Vinson.
When in a remote location with no mobile service, a satellite phone may be your only option.
Satellite phones are usually not a replacement for cell phones because you have to be outdoors with a clear line of sight to the satellite to make a call.
That service is often used by shipping companies, including cruise ships, and also by expeditions that require long-distance voice and data communication.
Your local phone service provider should be able to provide more information on how to connect to this service.
An increasingly popular option for those planning to defer college is to travel and study.
This is very popular among school graduates, allowing them to take a year off before university without sacrificing their education.
In many cases, taking a gap year course abroad can increase your chances of advancing to a higher level of education in your home country.
Generally, there is a fee for registering for this educational program.
Finland is a great destination for boating. This "land of a thousand lakes" also has thousands of islands, both in the lakes and in the coastal archipelago.
In the islands and lakes, you don't need a cruise ship.
Although the largest coastal islands and lakes are large enough for cruise ships, smaller boats or even kayaks will offer a different experience.
Boating is a national hobby in Finland; seven out of eight people own a boat.
This is comparable to Norway, Sweden, and New Zealand, but otherwise quite unique (for example, in the Netherlands the ratio is one to forty).
Most Baltic cruise ships feature longer stays in St. Petersburg, Russia.
This means you can visit the historical city for several full days while returning and sleeping on the ship at night.
If you are traveling only by ship, you do not require a separate visa (as of 2009).
Some cruise itineraries include Berlin, Germany in their brochures. As you can see from the map above, Berlin is quite far from the sea, and a visit to the city is not included in the cruise fare.
Traveling by plane can be a frightening experience for people of all ages and backgrounds, especially if they have never flown before or have had a traumatic experience.
This is not something to be ashamed of: it's no different from personal fears and dislikes towards what others have.
For some people, understanding how airplanes work and what happens during a flight can help overcome the fear stemming from the unknown or uncontrollable.
Shipping companies are paid adequately to deliver goods quickly. Often, time is critical for business documents, merchandise, or spare parts for urgent repairs.
On some routes, larger companies have their own aircraft, but problems arise on other routes involving smaller companies.
If they ship goods using air freight, it may take several days for them to clear customs and go through cargo handling on some routes.
The only way to get it through faster is to send it as checked baggage. Airline regulations won't allow them to send baggage without a passenger, which is where your role is needed.
The surest way to fly first class or business class is to shell out a lot of money to redeem miles (or, even better, have the company pay for it for you).
However, the price is not cheap: as a rough estimate, you might pay up to four times the normal economy fare for business class, and eleven times the fare for first class.
Generally, there's no point in looking for discounts for business class or first class on direct flights from A to B.
Airlines are very aware that there is a core group of travelers willing to pay more for reaching their destinations quickly, comfortably, and at a reasonable price.
The capital of Moldova is Chișinău. The local language is Romanian, but Russian is widely used.
Moldova is a multiethnic republic suffering from ethnic conflict.
In 1994, this conflict led to the formation of the Transnistria Republic, which declared itself in eastern Moldova. It has its own government and currency but is not recognized by any member state of the UN.
Economic ties have been rebuilt between these two parts of Moldova, despite the failure of political negotiations.
The main religion in Moldova is Eastern Orthodox Christianity.
Izmir is the third largest city in Turkey with a population of approximately 3.7 million, the second largest port after Istanbul, and an excellent transportation hub.

Please treat this place with dignity, reverence, and respect. Do not make jokes about the Holocaust or Nazis.
Do not deface the site by scribbling or spraying graffiti on buildings.
The official languages of Barcelona are Catalan and Spanish. Almost half of the population prefers to speak Catalan, most of them understand it, and almost everyone knows Spanish.
However, most signs are only written in Catalan because the language is designated by law as the first official language.
However, Spanish is also widely used in public transportation and other facilities.
Regular announcements on the Metro are only in Catalan, but unplanned disruptions are announced via the automated system in various languages, including Spanish, English, French, Arabic, and Japanese.
People from Paris are known to be egocentric, rude, and arrogant.
Although often just an inaccurate stereotype, the best way to fit in in Paris is to behave well, act like someone who is "bien élevé" (well-bred). This will make your travels much easier.
The rude nature of Parisians will suddenly evaporate quickly if you show basic courtesy.
Plitvice Lakes National Park has a dense forest, mainly composed of beech, spruce, and fir trees, and features a mix of Alpine and Mediterranean vegetation.
This has a very diverse plant community due to its range of microclimates, varied soils, and different altitudes.
This region is also home to a diverse range of animal and bird species.
Rare fauna such as the European brown bear, wolf, eagle, owl, lynx, wildcat, and capercaillie can be found there, as well as a variety of other common species.
When visiting the monastery, women are required to wear skirts that cover their knees and also cover their shoulders.
Most temples provide cloths for women who don't bring their own, but if you bring your own cloth, especially one that is brightly colored, you will receive a smile from the monks or nuns at the entrance.
Similarly, men are required to wear long pants that cover the knees.
This can also be borrowed from the stock at the entrance, but the clothes are not washed after other users wear them, so you might feel uncomfortable wearing this skirt. One size fits all men.
Majorcan cuisine, like that found in similar areas of the Mediterranean, is based on bread, vegetables, and meat (especially pork), and relies heavily on olive oil.
A popular simple dinner, especially during the summer, is Pan Oli: bread with olive oil, tomatoes, and any available seasonings like cheese, tuna, etc.
All nouns, with the exception of the pronoun "Sie" for you, are always capitalized, even in the middle of a sentence.
This is an important way to distinguish between several verbs and objects.
That could be said to make reading easier, although writing is quite difficult because you need to determine whether the morphological form used is a verb or an adjective.
The pronunciation of words in Italian is relatively easy because most words are pronounced exactly as they are written.
The main letters to pay attention to are c and g, because their pronunciation varies depending on the following vowels.
Furthermore, make sure to pronounce "r" and "rr" differently: "caro" means dear, while "carro" means carriage.

Pre-modern observatories are usually outdated in the modern era and are converted into museums or educational centers.
Light pollution in their time was not the same as the problem in the present day. It was usually located in cities or on campuses and was more easily accessible than what was built in modern times.
Most modern research telescopes are colossal facilities located in remote areas with suitable atmospheric conditions.
Viewing cherry blossoms, known as hanami, has been a part of Japanese culture since the 8th century.
The concept originated from China, where the plum blossom is a flower of choice.
In Japan, the first cherry blossom viewing party was held by the emperor for himself and other members of the aristocracy around the Imperial Palace.
Plants look best when they are in a natural environment, so resist the temptation to take a specimen even if it's "just one."
Visiting formally arranged gardens and collecting "specimens" will get you ejected, without discussion.
Singapore is generally a very safe and easy place to explore. You can buy almost anything after arriving.
However, because it's located in a "tropical highlands" area, only a few degrees north of the equator, you need to contend with heat (always) and strong sunshine (when the sky is clear, less frequently).
There are also several buses heading north to Hebron, the traditional burial place of the heads of families from the Gospel stories of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and their wives.
Check if the bus you want to take passes through Hebron and doesn't just go to the Jewish settlements near Kiryat Arba.

There is a tradition to spend Easter night staying up late in an open space to wait for the sunrise.
Of course, there is a Christian theological explanation for this tradition, but it may also be a Spring and Fertility ritual predating the Christian era.
Traditional churches often hold Easter Eve services on Saturday night during the Easter weekend. Congregations of this type often spontaneously celebrate the resurrection of Christ at midnight.
All animals that initially arrived on this island came by swimming, flying, or floating.
Due to its remote location from the mainland, mammals were unable to travel there, making the giant tortoise the primary grazing animal in the Galapagos.
Since humans arrived in the Galapagos Islands, many mammals have been introduced, including goats, horses, cattle, rats, cats, and dogs.
If you visit the Arctic or Antarctic regions in winter, you will experience the polar night, which means the sun does not rise above the horizon.
This provides a good opportunity to see the Aurora Borealis, as the sky will be darker around that time.
As the population in this area becomes scarcer, light pollution is no longer an issue. You can enjoy the starlight.
Japanese work culture is more hierarchical and formal than Western cultures.
A suit is standard business attire, and colleagues address each other by last name or title.
Workplace harmony is very important, emphasizing teamwork rather than praising individual achievements.
Workers must frequently receive approval from their superiors for every decision they make, and are expected to comply with their superiors' instructions without question.
